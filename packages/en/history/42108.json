The first issue of a work of\r\nthis kind is, too, ever beset with difficulties, and the compiler was\r\nalways aware that, though under the circumstances of its production the\r\nbook was an undoubted success, it necessarily lacked many of the\r\nelements which would make that success lasting, and cause the “Slang\r\nDictionary” to be regarded as an authority and a work of reference not\r\nmerely among the uneducated, but among people of cultivated tastes and\r\ninquiring minds. For though the vulgar use of the word Slang applies to\r\nthose words only which are used by the dangerous classes and the lowest\r\ngrades of society, the term has in reality, and should have—as every\r\none who has ever studied the subject knows—a much wider significance.\r\nBearing this in mind, the original publisher of this Dictionary lost no\r\nopportunity of obtaining information of a useful kind, which could\r\nhardly find place in any other book of reference, with the intention of\r\neventually bringing out an entirely new edition, in which all former\r\nerrors should be corrected and all fresh meanings and new words find a\r\nplace. His intention always was to give those words which are familiar\r\nto all conversant with our colloquialisms and locutions, but which have\r\nhitherto been connected with an unwritten tongue, a local habitation,\r\nand to produce a book which, in its way, would be as useful to students\r\nof philology, as well as to lovers of human nature in all its phases,\r\nas any standard work in the English language. The squeamishness which\r\ntries to ignore the existence of slang fails signally, for not only in\r\nthe streets and the prisons, but at the bar, on the bench, in the\r\npulpit, and in the Houses of Parliament, does slang make itself heard,\r\nand, as the shortest and safest means to an end, understood too.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor, the original compiler, did not live to see his wish\r\nbecome an actual fact; and, failing him, it devolved upon me to\r\nundertake the task of revision and addition. How far this has been\r\naccomplished, the curious reader who is possessed of a copy of each\r\nedition can best judge for himself by comparing any couple of pages he\r\nmay select. Of my own share in the work I wish to say nothing, as I have\r\nmainly benefited by the labours of others; but I may say that, when I\r\nundertook the position of editor of what, with the smallest possible\r\nstretch of fancy, may now be called a new book, I had no idea that the\r\nalteration would be nearly so large or so manifest. However, as the work\r\nis now done, it will best speak for itself, and, as good wine needs no\r\nbush, I will leave it, in all hope of their tenderness, to those readers\r\nwho are best qualified to say how the task has been consummated.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is but fair for me to thank, as strongly as weak words\r\nwill permit, those gentlemen who have in various ways assisted me. To\r\ntwo of them, who are well known in the world of literature, and who have\r\nnot only aided me with advice, but have placed many new words and\r\netymologies at my service, I am under particular obligation. With this I\r\nbeg to subscribe myself, the reader’s most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n        The Editor.\r\n\r\n    _December 20, 1873._\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—The reader will bear in mind that this is a Dictionary of\r\n    _modern_ Slang,—a list of colloquial words and phrases in _present_\r\n    use,—whether of ancient or modern formation. Whenever _Ancient_ is\r\n    appended to a word, it means that the expression was in respectable\r\n    use in or previous to the reign of Queen Elizabeth. _Old_ or _Old\r\n    English_, affixed to a word, signifies that it was in general use as\r\n    a proper expression in or previous to the reign of Charles II. _Old\r\n    Cant_ indicates that the term was in use as a Cant word during or\r\n    before the same reign.\r\n\r\n_The Publishers will be much obliged by the receipt of any cant, slang,\r\nor vulgar words not mentioned in the Dictionary.

T. BUCKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF CANT,\r\n\r\nOR THE\r\n\r\nSECRET LANGUAGE OF VAGABONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCant and Slang are universal and world-wide. By their means is often\r\nsaid in a sentence what would otherwise take an hour to express. Nearly\r\nevery nation on the face of the globe, polite and barbarous, has its\r\ndivisions and subdivisions of various ranks of society. These are\r\nnecessarily of many kinds, stationary and wandering, civilized and\r\nuncivilized, respectable and disreputable,—those who have fixed abodes\r\nand avail themselves of the refinements of civilization, and those who\r\ngo from place to place picking up a precarious livelihood by petty\r\nsales, begging, or theft. This peculiarity is to be observed amongst the\r\nheathen tribes of the southern hemisphere, as well as in the oldest and\r\nmost refined countries of Europe. In South Africa, the naked and\r\nmiserable Hottentots are pestered by the still more abject _Sonquas_;\r\nand it may be some satisfaction for us to know that our old enemies at\r\nthe Cape, the Kaffirs, are troubled with a tribe of rascals called\r\n_Fingoes_,—the former term, we are informed by travellers, signifying\r\nbeggars, and the latter wanderers and outcasts. In South America, and\r\namong the islands of the Pacific, matters are pretty much the same.\r\nSleek rascals, without much inclination towards honesty, fatten, or\r\nrather fasten, like the insects in the famous epigram, upon other\r\nrascals, who would be equally sleek and fat but for their vagabond\r\ndependents. Luckily for respectable persons, however, vagabonds, both at\r\nhome and abroad, generally show certain outward peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish them from the great mass of law-abiding people on whom they\r\nsubsist. Observation shows that the wandering races are remarkable for\r\nan abnormal development of the bones of the face, as the jaws,\r\ncheek-bones, &c., for high-crowned, stubborn-shaped heads, quick,\r\nrestless eyes,[1] and hands nervously itching to be doing; for their\r\nlove of gambling; for sensuality of all kinds; and for their use of a\r\nCANT language with which to conceal their designs and plunderings.\r\n\r\nThe secret jargon, or rude speech, of the vagabonds who hang upon the\r\nHottentots is termed Cuze-cat. In Finland, the fellows who steal\r\nseal-skins, pick the pockets of bear-skin overcoats, and talk cant, are\r\ntermed Lappes. In France, the secret language of highwaymen,\r\nhousebreakers, and pickpockets, is named Argot. The brigands and more\r\nromantic rascals of Spain term their private tongue Germania,[2] or\r\nRobbers’ Language. Rothwälsch,[3] or foreign-beggar-talk, is synonymous\r\nwith cant and thieves’ talk in Germany. The vulgar dialect of Malta, and\r\nthe Scala towns of the Levant—imported into this country and\r\nincorporated with English cant—is known as the Lingua Franca, or\r\nbastard Italian. And the crowds of lazy beggars that infest the streets\r\nof Naples and Rome, as well as the brigands of Pompeii, use a secret\r\nlanguage termed Gergo. In England, as we all know, it is called\r\nCant—often improperly Slang.\r\n\r\nMost nations, then, possess each a tongue, or series of tongues maybe,\r\neach based on the national language, by which not only thieves, beggars,\r\nand other outcasts communicate, but which is used more or less by all\r\nclasses. There is hardly any community in this country, hardly any\r\nprofession, but has its slang, and proficiency in this is the greatest\r\ndesideratum of an aspirant to the pleasures of Society, or the honours\r\nof literature and art. The formation of these secret tongues varies, of\r\ncourse, with the circumstances surrounding the speakers. A writer in\r\n_Notes and Queries_ has well remarked that “the investigation of the\r\norigin and principles of cant and slang language opens a curious field\r\nof inquiry, replete with considerable interest to the philologist and\r\nthe philosopher. It affords a remarkable instance of lingual\r\ncontrivance, which, without the introduction of much arbitrary matter,\r\nhas developed a system of communicating ideas, having all the advantages\r\nof a foreign language.”\r\n\r\n“The terms Cant and Canting were probably derived from chaunt and\r\nchaunting,—the whining tone, or modulation of voice adopted by\r\nbeggars, with intent to coax, wheedle, or cajole by pretensions of\r\nwretchedness.”[4] For the origin of the other application of the word\r\nCant, pulpit hypocrisy, we are indebted to the _Spectator_—“Cant is by\r\nsome people derived from one Andrew Cant, who, they say, was a\r\nPresbyterian minister in some illiterate part of Scotland, who, by\r\nexercise and use, had obtained the faculty, alias gift, of talking in\r\nthe pulpit in such a dialect that ’tis said he was understood by none\r\nbut his own congregation,—and not by all of them. Since Master Cant’s\r\ntime it has been understood in a larger sense, and signifies all\r\nexclamations, whinings, unusual tones, and, in fine, all praying and\r\npreaching like the unlearned of the Presbyterians.” This anecdote is\r\ncurious, though it is but fair to assume that the preacher’s name was\r\ntaken from his practice, rather than that the practice was called after\r\nthe preacher. As far as we are concerned, however, in the present\r\ninquiry, Cant was derived from chaunt, a beggar’s whine; “chaunting”\r\nbeing the recognised term amongst beggars to this day for begging\r\norations and street whinings; and “chaunter,” a street talker and tramp,\r\nis still the term used by strollers and patterers. This race is,\r\nhowever, nearly obsolete. The use of the word Cant, amongst beggars,\r\nmust certainly have commenced at a very early date, for we find “To\r\ncante, to speake,” in Harman’s list of Rogues’ Words in the year 1566;\r\nand Harrison about the same time,[5] in speaking of beggars and\r\nGipsies, says, “they have devised a language among themselves which they\r\nname Canting, but others Pedlars’ Frenche.”\r\n\r\nNow, the word Cant in its old sense, and Slang[6] in its modern\r\napplication, although used by good writers and persons of education as\r\nsynonyms, are in reality quite distinct and separate terms. Cant, apart\r\nfrom religious hypocrisy, refers to the old secret language of Gipsies,\r\nthieves, tramps, and beggars. Slang represents that evanescent language,\r\never changing with fashion and taste, which has principally come into\r\nvogue during the last seventy or eighty years, spoken by persons in\r\nevery grade of life, rich and poor, honest and dishonest.[7] Cant is\r\nold; Slang is always modern and ever changing. To illustrate the\r\ndifference: a thief in Cant language would term a horse a “prancer” or a\r\n“prad;” while in Slang, a man of fashion would speak of it as a “bit of\r\nblood,” a “spanker,” or a “neat tit.” A handkerchief, too, would be a\r\n“billy,” a “fogle,” or a “Kent rag,” in the secret language of low\r\ncharacters; whilst amongst the modern folk who affect Slang, it would be\r\ncalled a “stook,” a “wipe,” a “fogle,” or a “clout.” Cant was formed for\r\npurposes of secrecy. Slang, though it has a tendency the same way, is\r\nstill often indulged in from a mild desire to appear familiar with life,\r\ngaiety, town-humour, and the transient nicknames and street jokes of the\r\nday. Both Cant and Slang, we have before said, are often huddled\r\ntogether as synonyms; but they are most certainly distinct, and as such\r\nshould be used.\r\n\r\nTo the Gipsies, beggars and thieves are in great measure indebted for\r\ntheir Cant language. It is supposed that the Gipsies originally landed\r\nin this country early in the reign of Henry VIII. They were at first\r\ntreated as conjurors and magicians,—indeed, they were hailed by the\r\npopulace with as much applause as a company of English performers\r\nusually receives on arriving in a distant colony. They came here with\r\nall their old Eastern arts of palmistry and second-sight, with their\r\nfactitious power of doubling money by incantation and burial,—shreds of\r\npagan idolatry; and they brought with them, also, the dishonesty of the\r\nlower-caste Orientals, and the nomadic tastes they had acquired through\r\ncenturies of wandering over nearly the whole of the then known globe.\r\nThey possessed also a language quite distinct from anything that had\r\nbeen heard in England up till their advent; they claimed the title of\r\nEgyptians, and as such, when their thievish propensities became a public\r\nnuisance, were cautioned and proscribed in a royal proclamation by Henry\r\nVIII.[8] The Gipsies were not long in the country before they found\r\nnative imitators; and indeed the imitation is much more frequently found\r\nnowadays, in the ranks of the so-called Gipsies, than is the genuine\r\narticle. Vagabondism is peculiarly catching, and the idle, the vagrant,\r\nand the criminal soon caught the idea from the Gipsies, and learned from\r\nthem to tramp, sleep under hedges and trees, tell fortunes, and find\r\nlost property for a consideration—frequently, as the saying runs,\r\nhaving found it themselves before it was lost. They also learned the\r\nvalue and application of a secret tongue; indeed, with the Gipsies came\r\nin all the accompaniments of maunding and imposture, except thieving and\r\nbegging, which were well known in this country, and perhaps in every\r\nother, long before visitors had an opportunity of teaching them.\r\n\r\nHarman, in 1566, wrote a singular, not to say droll, book, entitled, _A\r\nCaveat for commen Cvrsetors, vulgarly called Vagabones, newly augmented\r\nand inlarged_, wherein the history and various descriptions of rogues\r\nand vagabonds are given, together with their canting tongue. This book,\r\nthe earliest of the kind, gives the singular fact that within a dozen\r\nyears after the landing of the Gipsies, companies of English vagrants\r\nwere formed, places of meeting appointed, districts for plunder and\r\nbegging operations marked out, and rules agreed to for their common\r\nmanagement. In some cases Gipsies joined the English gangs; in others,\r\nEnglish vagrants joined the Gipsies. The fellowship was found convenient\r\nand profitable, as both parties were aliens to the laws and customs of\r\nthe country, living in a great measure in the open air, apart from the\r\nlawful public, and often meeting each other on the same by-path, or in\r\nthe same retired valley; but seldom intermarrying or entirely adopting\r\neach other’s habits. The common people, too, soon began to consider them\r\nas of one family,—all rogues, and from Egypt. This superstition must\r\nhave been very firmly imbedded, for it is still current. The secret\r\nlanguage spoken by the Gipsies, principally Hindoo, and extremely\r\nbarbarous to English ears, was found incomprehensible and very difficult\r\nto learn. The Gipsies naturally found a similar difficulty with the\r\nEnglish language. A rude, rough, and singular, but under the\r\ncircumstances not unnatural, compromise was made, and a mixture of\r\nGipsy, old English, newly-coined words, and cribbings from any foreign,\r\nand therefore secret, language, mixed and jumbled together, formed what\r\nhas ever since been known as the Canting Language, or Pedlar’s French;\r\nor, during the past century, St. Giles’s Greek.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of Cant; and in illustration of its blending with\r\nthe Gipsy or Cingari tongue, we are enabled to give the accompanying\r\nlist of Gipsy, and often Hindoo, words, with, in many instances, their\r\nEnglish representatives:—\r\n\r\n             _Gipsy._                            _English._\r\n\r\n  ~Bamboozle~, to perplex or mislead    ~Bamboozle~, to delude, cheat,\r\n    by hiding. _Modern Gipsy._            or make a fool of any one.\r\n\r\n  ~Bosh~, rubbish, nonsense, offal.     ~Bosh~, stupidity, foolishness.\r\n    _Gipsy and Persian._\r\n\r\n  ~Cheese~, thing or article, “That’s   ~Cheese~, or CHEESY, a\r\n    the CHEESE,” or thing. _Gipsy and     first-rate or very good\r\n    Hindoo._                              article.\r\n\r\n  ~Chive~, the tongue. _Gipsy._         ~Chive~, or CHIVEY, a shout.

Dad, in Welsh, also signifies a\r\nfather. Cur is stated to be a mere term of reproach, like Dog, which in\r\nall European languages has been applied in an abusive sense. Objections\r\nmay also be raised against Gad, Maund, and many other of these\r\nparallels. We have, however, no wish to present them as infallible; our\r\nidea is merely to call the reader’s attention to the undoubted\r\nsimilarity between both the sound and the sense in most examples.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the remarkable fact of at least a few words of pure\r\nGipsy origin going the round of Europe, passing into this country before\r\nthe Reformation, and coming down to us through numerous generations\r\npurely by the mouths of the people. They have seldom been written or\r\nused in books, and it is simply as vulgarisms that they have reached us.\r\nOnly a few are now Cant, and some are household words. The word jockey,\r\nas applied to a dealer or rider of horses, came from the Gipsy, and\r\nmeans in that language a whip. The word, used as a verb, is an instance\r\nof modern slang grown out of the ancient. Our standard dictionaries\r\ngive, of course, none but conjectural etymologies. Another word,\r\nbamboozle, has been a sore difficulty with lexicographers. It is not in\r\nthe old dictionaries, although it is extensively used in familiar or\r\npopular language for the last two centuries; and is, in fact, the very\r\nkind of word that such writers as Swift, Butler, L’Estrange, and\r\nArbuthnot would pick out at once as a telling and most serviceable term.\r\nIt is, as we have seen, from the Gipsy; and here we must state that it\r\nwas Boucher who first drew attention to the fact, although in his\r\nremarks on the dusky tongue he has made an evident mistake by concluding\r\nit to be identical with its offspring, Cant. Other parallel instances,\r\nwith but slight variations from the old Gipsy meanings, might be\r\nmentioned; but sufficient examples have been adduced to show that\r\nMarsden, a great Oriental scholar in the last century, when he declared\r\nbefore the Society of Antiquaries that the Cant of English thieves and\r\nbeggars had nothing to do with the language spoken by the despised\r\nGipsies, was in error. Had the Gipsy tongue been analysed and committed\r\nto writing three centuries ago, there is every probability that many\r\nscores of words now in common use could be at once traced to its source,\r\nhaving been adopted as our language has developed towards its present\r\nshape through many varied paths. Instances continually occur nowadays of\r\nstreet vulgarisms ascending to the drawing-rooms of respectable society.\r\nWho, then, can doubt that the Gipsy-vagabond alliance of three centuries\r\nago has contributed its quota of common words to popular speech?\r\n\r\nThomas Moore, in a humorous little book, _Tom Crib’s Memorial to\r\nCongress_, 1819, says, “The Gipsy language, with the exception of such\r\nterms as relate to their own peculiar customs, differs but little from\r\nthe regular Flash or Cant language.” But this was magnifying the\r\nimportance of the alliance. Moore, we should think, knew nothing of the\r\nGipsy tongue other than the few Cant words put into the mouths of the\r\nbeggars in Beaumont and Fletcher’s _Comedy of the Beggar’s Bush_, and\r\nBen Jonson’s _Masque of the Gipsies Metamorphosed_,—hence his\r\nconfounding Cant with Gipsy speech, and appealing to the Glossary of\r\nCant for so-called “Gipsy” words at the end of the _Life of Bamfylde\r\nMoore Carew_, to bear him out in his assertion. Still his remark bears\r\nmuch truth, and proof of this would have been found long ago if any\r\nscholar had taken the trouble to examine the “barbarous jargon of Cant,”\r\nand to have compared it with Gipsy speech. George Borrow, in his\r\n_Account of the Gipsies in Spain_, thus eloquently concludes his second\r\nvolume; speaking of the connexion of the Gipsies with Europeans, he\r\nsays:—“Yet from this temporary association were produced two results;\r\nEuropean fraud became sharpened by coming into contact with Asiatic\r\ncraft; whilst European tongues, by imperceptible degrees, became\r\nrecruited with various words (some of them wonderfully expressive), many\r\nof which have long been stumbling-blocks to the philologist, who, whilst\r\nstigmatizing them as words of mere vulgar invention, or of unknown\r\norigin, has been far from dreaming that a little more research or\r\nreflection would have proved their affinity to the Sclavonic, Persian,\r\nor Romaic, or perhaps to the mysterious object of his veneration, the\r\nSanscrit, the sacred tongue of the palm-covered regions of Ind; words\r\noriginally introduced into Europe by objects too miserable to occupy for\r\na moment his lettered attention—the despised denizens of the tents of\r\nRoma.” These words might with very little alteration be ascribed to the\r\nsubject of which this volume is supposed—indeed hoped—to be a\r\nhandbook.\r\n\r\nBut the Gipsies, their speech, their character—bad enough, as all the\r\nworld testifies, but yet not devoid of redeeming qualities—their\r\nhistory, and their religious belief, have been totally disregarded, and\r\ntheir poor persons buffeted and jostled about until it is a wonder that\r\nany trace of origin or national speech remains. On the Continent they\r\nreceived better attention at the hands of learned men. Their language\r\nwas taken down in writing and examined, their history was traced, and\r\ntheir extraordinary customs and practice of living in the open air, and\r\neating raw, and often putrid meat, were explained. They ate reptiles and\r\ntold fortunes because they had learnt to do so through their forefathers\r\ncenturies back in Hindostan; and they devoured carrion because the\r\nHindoo proverb—“That which God kills is better than that killed by\r\nman”[10]—was still in their remembrance. This is the sort of proverb,\r\nwe should imagine, that would hardly commend itself to any one who had\r\nnot an unnatural and ghoule-like tendency anxious for full development.\r\nGrellman, a learned German, was their principal historian, and to him,\r\nand those who have followed him, we are almost entirely indebted for the\r\nlittle we know of their language. The first European settlement of the\r\nGipsies was in the provinces adjoining the Danube, Moldau and\r\nTheiss, where M. Cogalniceano, in his _Essai sur les Cigains de la\r\nMoldo-Valachie_, estimates them at 200,000. Not a few of our ancient and\r\nmodern Cant and Slang terms are Wallachian and Greek words, picked up by\r\nthese wanderers from the East, and added to their common stock.\r\n\r\nGipsy, then, started, and was partially merged into Cant; and the old\r\nstory told by Harrison and others, that the first inventor of canting\r\nwas hanged for his pains, would seem to be a humorous invention, for\r\njargon as it is, it was doubtless of gradual formation, like all other\r\nlanguages or systems of speech. Most of the modern Gipsies know the old\r\nCant words as well as their own tongue—or rather what remains of it. As\r\nBorrow says, “The dialect of the English Gipsies is mixed with English\r\nwords.”[11] Those of the tribe who frequent fairs, and mix with English\r\ntramps, readily learn the new words, as they are adopted by what Harman\r\ncalls “the fraternity of vagabonds.” Indeed, the old Cant is a common\r\nlanguage to the vagrants of many descriptions and every possible origin\r\nwho are scattered over the British Isles.\r\n\r\nEnglish Cant has its mutabilities like every other system of speech, and\r\nis considerably altered since the first dictionary was compiled by\r\nHarman in 1566. A great many words are unknown in the present tramps’\r\nand thieves’ vernacular. Some of them, however, still bear their old\r\ndefinitions, while others have adopted fresh meanings. “Abraham-man” is\r\nyet seen in our modern “sham Abraham,” or “play the old\r\nsoldier”—_i.e._, to feign sickness or distress. “Autum” is still a\r\nchurch or chapel amongst Gipsies; and “beck,” a constable, is our modern\r\nCant and Slang “beak,” once a policeman, but now a magistrate. “Bene,”\r\nor “bone,” stands for good in Seven Dials and the back streets of\r\nWestminster; and “bowse” is our modern “booze,” to drink or fuddle. A\r\n“bowsing ken” was the old Cant term for a public-house; and “boozing\r\nken,” in modern Cant, has precisely the same meaning. There is little\r\ndoubt, though, that the pronunciations were always as they are now, so\r\nfar at least as these two instances are concerned. “Cassan” is both old\r\nand modern Cant for cheese; the same may be said of “chattes,” or\r\n“chatts,” the gallows. “Cofe,” or “cove,” is still a vulgar synonym for\r\na man. “Dudes” was Cant for clothes; we now say “duds.” “Flag” is still\r\na fourpenny-piece; and “fylche” means to rob. “Ken” is a house, and\r\n“lick” means to thrash; “prancer” is yet known amongst rogues as a\r\nhorse; and to “prig,” amongst high and low, is to steal. Three centuries\r\nago, if one beggar said anything disagreeable to another, the person\r\nannoyed would say, “Stow you,” or hold your peace; low people now say,\r\n“Stow it,” equivalent to “Be quiet.” There is, so far as the Slang goes,\r\nno actual difference in the use of these phrases, the variation being in\r\nthe pronouns—in fact, in the direction. “Trine” is still to hang; “wyn”\r\nyet stands for a penny. And many other words, as will be seen in the\r\nDictionary, still retain their ancient meaning.\r\n\r\nAs specimens of those words which have altered their original Cant\r\nsignification, may be instanced “chete,” now written cheat. “Chete” was\r\nin ancient Cant what _chop_ is in the Canton-Chinese—an almost\r\ninseparable adjunct. Everything was termed a “chete,” and qualified by a\r\nsubstantive-adjective, which showed what kind of a “chete” was meant;\r\nfor instance, “crashing-chetes” were teeth; a “moffling-chete,” was a\r\nnapkin; a “topping-chete,” was the gallows, and a “grunting-chete,” was\r\na pig. Cheat nowadays means to cozen or defraud, and lexicographers have\r\ntortured etymology for an original—but without success. _Escheats_ and\r\n_escheatours_ have been named, but with great doubts; indeed, Stevens,\r\nthe learned commentator on Shakspeare, acknowledged that he “did not\r\nrecollect to have met with the word cheat in our ancient writers.”[12]\r\nCheat, to defraud, then, is no other than an old Cant term somewhat\r\naltered in its meaning,[13] and as such it should be described in the\r\nnext etymological dictionary. Another instance of a change in the\r\nmeaning of the old Cant, but the retention of the word, is seen in\r\n“cly,” formerly to take or steal, now a pocket; and with the remembrance\r\nof a certain class of low characters, a curious connexion between the\r\ntwo meanings is discovered. “Make” was a halfpenny: we now say\r\n“mag,”—“make” being modern Cant for getting money by any possible\r\nmeans, their apophthegm being—“Get money the best way you can, but\r\n_make_ it somehow.” “Milling” stood for stealing; it ultimately became a\r\npugilistic term, and then faded into nothingness, “the cove wot loves a\r\nmill,” being a thing of the past. “Nab” was a head,—low people now say\r\n“nob,” the former meaning, in modern Cant, to steal or seize. “Pek” was\r\nmeat,—we still say “peckish,” when hungry. “Peckish” is though more\r\nlikely to be derived from the action of birds when eating, as all slang\r\nhas its origin in metaphor. “Prygges, dronken Tinkers or beastly\r\npeople,” as old Harman wrote, would scarcely be understood now; a\r\n“prig,” in the 19th century, is a pickpocket or thief. He is also a\r\nmean, contemptible little “cuss,” who is not, as a rule, found in low\r\nlife, but who could be very well spared from that of the middle and\r\nupper classes. “Quier,” or “queer,” like cheat, was a very common\r\nprefix, and meant bad or wicked,—it now means odd, curious, or strange;\r\nbut to the ancient Cant we are possibly indebted for the word, which\r\netymologists should remember.[14] “Rome,” or “rum,” formerly meant good,\r\nor of the first quality, and was extensively used like cheat and\r\nqueer,—indeed as an adjective it was the opposite of the latter. “Rum”\r\nnow means curious, and is synonymous with queer; thus,—“rummy old\r\nbloke,” or a “queer old man.” Here again we see the origin of an\r\nevery-day word, scouted by lexicographers and snubbed by respectable\r\npersons, but still a word of frequent and popular use. “Yannam” meant\r\nbread; “pannum” is the word now. Other instances could be pointed out,\r\nbut they will be observed in the Dictionary.\r\n\r\nSeveral words are entirely obsolete. “Alybbeg” no longer means a bed,\r\nnor “askew” a cup. “Booget,”[15] nowadays, would not be understood for a\r\nbasket; neither would “gan” pass current for mouth. “Fullams” was the\r\nold Cant term for false or loaded dice, and although used by Shakspeare\r\nin this sense, is now unknown and obsolete. Indeed, as Moore somewhere\r\nremarks, the present Greeks of St. Giles’s themselves would be\r\nthoroughly puzzled by many of the ancient canting songs,—taking, for\r\nexample, the first verse of an old favourite—\r\n\r\n    “Bing out, bien Morts, and toure and toure,\r\n      Bing out, bien Morts, and toure;\r\n    For all your duds are bing’d awast;\r\n      The bien cove hath the loure.”[16]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps we cannot do better than present to the reader at once an\r\nentire copy of the first Canting Dictionary ever compiled. As before\r\nmentioned, it was the work of one Thomas Harman, who lived in the days\r\nof Queen Elizabeth. Some writers have remarked that Decker[17] was the\r\nfirst to compile a dictionary of the vagabonds’ tongue; whilst\r\nBorrow[18] and Moore stated that Richard Head performed that service in\r\nhis _Life of an English Rogue_, published in the year 1680. All these\r\nstatements are equally incorrect, for the first attempt was made more\r\nthan a century before the latter work was issued. The quaint spelling\r\nand old-fashioned phraseology are preserved, and the initiated will\r\nquickly recognise many vulgar street words as old acquaintances dressed\r\nin antique garb.[19]\r\n\r\n    ~Abraham-men~ be those that fayn themselves to have beene mad, and\r\n    have bene kept either in Bethelem, or in some other pryson a good\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    ~Alybbeg~, a bedde.\r\n\r\n    ~Askew~, a cuppe.\r\n\r\n    ~Autem~, a churche.\r\n\r\n    ~Autem mortes~, married women as chaste as a cowe.\r\n\r\n    ~Baudye baskets~ bee women who goe with baskets and capcases on\r\n    their armes, wherein they have laces, pinnes, nedles, whyte inkel,\r\n    and round sylke gyrdels of all colours.\r\n\r\n    ~Beck~ [Beak, a magistrate], a constable.\r\n\r\n    ~Belly-chete~, apron.\r\n\r\n    ~Bene~, good. _Benar_, better.\r\n\r\n    ~Benship~, very good.\r\n\r\n    ~Bleting chete~, a calfe or sheepe.\r\n\r\n    ~Booget~, a travelling tinker’s baskete.\r\n\r\n    ~Borde~, a shilling.\r\n\r\n    ~Boung~, a purse.

And here it should be mentioned that at the\r\npresent day the most inconsistent and far-fetched terms are often used\r\nfor secret purposes, when they are known to be caviare to the million.\r\nIt is strange that such words as incongruous, insipid, interloper,\r\nintriguing, indecorum, forestall, equip, hush, grapple, &c., &c., were\r\ncurrent Cant words a century and a half ago, if we are to judge by the\r\nDictionary of Canting Words at the end of _Bacchus and Venus_,[20] 1737.\r\nIt is but fair, however, to assume that the compiler of the dictionary\r\nwas but trading on the demand for Cant phrases, and was humbugging his\r\nreaders. The terms are inserted not as jokes or squibs, but as\r\nselections from the veritable pocket dictionaries of the Jack Sheppards\r\nand Dick Turpins of the day. If they were safely used as unknown and\r\ncabalistic terms amongst the commonalty, the fact would form a very\r\ncurious illustration of the ignorance of our poor ancestors; but it\r\nwould be unfair and, indeed, idiotic to assume this without much\r\nstronger proof than the book in question gives of itself.\r\n\r\nAmongst those Cant words which have either altered their meanings, or\r\nhave become extinct, may be cited lady, formerly the Cant for “a very\r\ncrooked, deformed, and ill-shapen woman;”[21] and Harman, “a pair of\r\nstocks, or a constable.” The former is a pleasant piece of sarcasm,\r\nwhilst the latter indicates a singular method of revenge, or else of\r\nsatire. Harman was the first author who specially wrote against English\r\nvagabonds, and for his trouble his name, we are told, became synonymous\r\nwith a pair of stocks, or a policeman of the olden time.\r\n\r\nApart from the Gipsy element, we find that Cant abounds in terms from\r\nforeign languages, and that it exhibits signs of a growth similar to\r\nthat of most recognised and completely-formed tongues,—the gathering of\r\nwords from foreign sources. In the reign of Elizabeth and of King James\r\nI., several Dutch, Flemish, and Spanish words were introduced by\r\nsoldiers who had served in the Low Countries and sailors who had\r\nreturned from the Spanish Main, who, like “mine ancient Pistol,” were\r\nfond of garnishing their speech with outlandish phrases. Many of these\r\nwere soon picked up and adopted by vagabonds and tramps in their Cant\r\nlanguage. The Anglo-Norman and the Anglo-Saxon, the Scotch, the French,\r\nthe Italian, and even the classic languages of ancient Italy and Greece,\r\nbesides the various provincial dialects of England, have contributed to\r\nits list of words. Indeed, as has been remarked, English Cant seems to\r\nbe formed on the same basis as the Argot of the French and the\r\nRoth-Sprach of the Germans—partly metaphorical, and partly by the\r\nintroduction of such corrupted foreign terms as are likely to be unknown\r\nto the society amid which the Cant speakers exist. Argot is the London\r\nthieves’ word for their secret language; it is, of course, from the\r\nFrench, but that matters not, so long as it is incomprehensible to the\r\npolice and the mob. “Booze,” or “bouse,” is supposed to come from the\r\nDutch _buysen_, though the word has been in use in England for some\r\nhundreds of years. “Domine,” a parson, is from the Spanish. “Donna and\r\nfeeles,” a woman and children, is from the Latin; and “don,” a clever\r\nfellow, has been filched from the Lingua Franca, or bastard Italian,\r\nalthough it sounds like an odd mixture of Spanish and French; whilst\r\n“duds,” the vulgar term for clothes, may have been pilfered either from\r\nthe Gaelic or the Dutch. “Feele,” a daughter, from the French; and\r\n“frow,” a girl or wife, from the German—are common tramps’ terms. So\r\nare “gent,” silver, from the French _argent_; and “vial,” a country\r\ntown, also from the French. “Horrid-horn,” a fool, is believed to be\r\nfrom the Erse; and “gloak,” a man, from the Scotch. As stated before,\r\nthe dictionary will supply numerous other instances.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic languages have contributed many Cant and vulgar words to our\r\npopular vocabulary. These have come to us through the Gaelic and Irish\r\nlanguages, so closely allied in their material as to be merely dialects\r\nof a primitive common tongue. This element may arise from the Celtic\r\nportion of our population, which, from its position as slaves or\r\nservants to its ancient conquerors, has contributed so largely to the\r\nlowest class of the community, therefore to our Slang, provincial, or\r\ncolloquial words; or it may be an importation from Irish immigrants, who\r\nhave contributed their fair proportion to our criminal stock.\r\n\r\nThere is one source, however, of secret street terms which in the first\r\nedition of this work was entirely overlooked,—indeed, it was unknown to\r\nthe original compiler until pointed out by a correspondent,—the Lingua\r\nFranca, or bastard Italian, spoken at Genoa, Trieste, Malta,\r\nConstantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria, and all Mediterranean seaport towns.\r\nThe ingredients of this imported Cant are, as its name denotes, many.\r\nIts foundation is Italian, with a mixture of modern Greek, German (from\r\nthe Austrian ports), Spanish, Turkish, and French. It has been\r\nintroduced to the notice of the London wandering tribes by the sailors,\r\nforeign and English, who trade to and from the Mediterranean seaports,\r\nbut it must not be confounded with the mixture of Irish, English, and\r\nItalian spoken in neighbourhoods like Saffron Hill and Leather Lane,\r\nwhich are thronged with swarms of organ-grinders from all parts of\r\nItaly, and makers of images from Rome and Florence,—all of whom, in\r\nthese dense thoroughfares, mingle with our lower orders. It would occupy\r\ntoo much space here to give a list of the words used in either of these\r\nBabel-like tongues, especially as the principal of them are noted in the\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\n“There are several Hebrew terms in our Cant language, obtained, it\r\nwould appear, from the intercourse of the thieves with the Jew fences\r\n(receivers of stolen goods); many of the Cant terms, again, are\r\nSanscrit, got from the Gipsies; many Latin, got by the beggars from the\r\nCatholic prayers before the Reformation; and many again, Italian, got\r\nfrom the wandering musicians and others; indeed, the showmen have but\r\nlately introduced a number of Italian phrases into their Cant\r\nlanguage.”[22] The Hindostanee also contributes several words, and these\r\nhave been introduced by the Lascar sailors, who come over here in the\r\nEast Indiamen, and often lodge during their stay in the low tramps’\r\nhouses at the East-end of London. Speaking of the learned tongues, it\r\nmay be mentioned that, precarious and abandoned as the vagabonds’\r\nexistence is, many persons of classical or refined education have from\r\ntime to time joined the nomadic ranks,—occasionally from inclination,\r\nas in the popular instance of Bamfylde Moore Carew, but generally\r\nthrough indiscretions, which involve pecuniary difficulty and loss of\r\ncharacter.[23] This will in some measure account for numerous classical\r\nand learned words figuring as Cant terms in the vulgar dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the last century, when highwaymen and footpads were\r\nplentiful, and when the dangerous classes were in larger proportion to\r\nthe bulk of the population than they are now, a great many new words\r\nwere added to the canting vocabulary, whilst several old terms fell into\r\ndisuse. “Cant,” for instance, as applied to thieves’ talk, was\r\nsupplanted by the word “flash.” In the North of England the Cant\r\nemployed by tramps and thieves is known as “Gammy.” It is mainly from\r\nthe old Gipsy corrupted. In the large towns of Ireland and Scotland this\r\nsecret language is also spoken, with of course additions peculiar to\r\neach locality. All those words derived from “gammy” are inserted in the\r\ndictionary as from the North country.\r\n\r\nA singular feature, however, in vulgar language is the retention and the\r\nrevival of sterling old English words, long since laid up in ancient\r\nmanuscripts. Disraeli somewhere says, “The purest source of neology is\r\nin the revival of old words”—\r\n\r\n    “Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake;”\r\n\r\nand Dr. Latham remarks that “the thieves of London are the conservators\r\nof Anglo-Saxonisms.” A young gentleman from Belgravia, who had lost his\r\nwatch or his pocket-handkerchief, would scarcely remark to his mamma\r\nthat it had been “boned”—yet “bone,” in old times, meant, amongst high\r\nand low, to steal. And a young lady living in the precincts of dingy but\r\naristocratic Mayfair, although enraptured with a Jenny Lind or a\r\nRistori, would hardly think of turning back in the box to inform papa\r\nthat she (Ristori or Lind) “made no ‘bones’ of it”—yet the phrase was\r\nmost respectable and well-to-do before it met with a change of\r\ncircumstances. Possibly fashion, in its journey from east to west, left\r\ncertain phrases and metaphors behind, which being annexed by the\r\nnewcomers, sank gradually in the social scale until they ultimately\r\npassed out of the written language altogether, and became “flash” or\r\nSlang. “A ‘crack’ article,” however first-rate, would have greatly\r\ndispleased Dr. Johnson and Mr. Walker—yet both crack, in the sense of\r\nexcellent, and crack up, to boast or praise, were not considered\r\nvulgarisms in the time of Henry VIII. The former term is used frequently\r\nnowadays, as a kind of polite and modified Slang—as a “crack” regiment,\r\na “crack” shot, &c. “Dodge,” a cunning trick, is from the Anglo-Saxon;\r\nand ancient nobles used to “get each other’s ‘dander’ up” before\r\nappealing to their swords,—quite “flabbergasting” (also a respectable\r\nold word) the half-score of lookers-on with the thumps and cuts of their\r\nheavy weapons. “Gallivanting,” waiting upon the ladies, was as polite in\r\nexpression as in action; whilst a clergyman at Paule’s Crosse thought\r\nnothing of bidding a noisy hearer “hold his ‘gab,’” or “shut up his\r\n‘gob.’” But then the essence of preaching was to indulge in idiomatic\r\nphrases and colloquialisms—a practice now almost peculiar to itinerant\r\n“ranters.” “Gadding,” roaming about in an idle and vacant manner, was\r\nused in an old translation of the Bible; and “to do anything ‘gingerly’”\r\nwas to do it with great care. Persons of modern affected tastes will be\r\nshocked to know that the great Lord Bacon spoke of the lower part of a\r\nman’s face as his “gills,” though the expression is not more\r\nobjectionable than the generality of metaphor, and is considerably more\r\nrespectable than many words admitted to the genteel—we use the word\r\nadvisedly—vocabulary.\r\n\r\nShakspeare also used many words which are now counted dreadfully vulgar.\r\n“‘Clean’ gone,” in the sense of out of sight, or entirely away; “you\r\ntook me all ‘a-mort,’” or confounded me; “it wont ‘fadge,’” or suit, are\r\nphrases taken at random from the great dramatist’s works. These phrases\r\nare the natural outcome of the poet’s truth to life in the characters he\r\nportrayed. A London costermonger, or inhabitant of the streets, instead\r\nof saying, “I’ll make him yield,” or “give in,” in a fight or contest,\r\nwould say, “I’ll make him ‘buckle’ under.” Shakspeare in his _Henry the\r\nFourth_ (part ii. act i. scene 1), has the word; and Mr. Halliwell, one\r\nof the greatest and most industrious of living antiquaries, informs us\r\nthat “the commentators do not supply another example.” If Shakspeare was\r\nnot a pugilist, he certainly anticipated the terms of the prize-ring—or\r\nthey were respectable words before the prize-ring was thought of—for he\r\nhas “pay,” to beat or thrash, and “pepper,” with a similar meaning; also\r\n“fancy,” in the sense of pets and favourites,—pugilists are often\r\ntermed “the ‘fancy.’” The origin of the term, as applied to them, has,\r\nhowever, never been satisfactorily decided, though Pierce Egan and\r\nothers since his time have speculated ingeniously on the subject. The\r\nCant word “prig,” from the Saxon _priccan_, to filch, is also\r\nShakspearian; so, indeed, is “piece,” a contemptuous term for a young\r\nwoman. Shakspeare was not the only vulgar dramatist of his time. Ben\r\nJonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Brome, and other play-writers,\r\noccasionally, and very naturally, put Cant words into the mouths of\r\ntheir low characters, or employed old words which have since degenerated\r\ninto vulgarisms. “Crusty,” poor tempered; “two of a kidney,” two of a\r\nsort; “lark,” a piece of fun; “lug,” to pull; “bung,” to give or pass;\r\n“pickle,” a sad plight; “frump,” to mock, are a few specimens casually\r\npicked from the works of the old histrionic writers.\r\n\r\nOne old English mode of canting, simple enough, but affected only by the\r\nmost miserable impostors, was the inserting a consonant betwixt each\r\nsyllable; thus, taking _g_, “How do you do?” would be “How_g_ do_g_\r\nyou_g_ do_g_?” The name very properly given to this disagreeable\r\nnonsense, we are informed by Grose, was gibberish.\r\n\r\nAnother slang has been manufactured by transposing the initial letters\r\nof words, so that a mutton chop becomes a _ch_utton _m_op, and a pint of\r\nstout a _st_int of _p_out; but it is satisfactory to know that it has\r\ngained no ground, as it is remarkable for nothing so much as poverty of\r\nresource on the part of its inventors. This is called “Marrowskying,” or\r\n“Medical Greek,” from its use by medical students at the hospitals.\r\nAlbert Smith termed it the “Gower Street Dialect,” and referred to it\r\noccasionally in his best-known works.\r\n\r\nThe “Language of Ziph,” it may be noted, is another rude mode of\r\ndisguising English, in use among the students at Winchester College.\r\nSome notices of this method of conveying secret information, with an\r\nextensive Glossary of the Words, Phrases, Customs, &c., peculiar to the\r\nCollege, may be found in Mr. Mansfield’s _School Life at Winchester\r\nCollege_. It is certainly too puerile a specimen of work to find place\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] “Swarms of vagabonds, whose eyes were so sharp as Lynx.”—_Bullein’s\r\nSimples and Surgery_, 1562.\r\n\r\n[2] Probably from the Gipsies, who were supposed to come from Germany\r\ninto Spain.\r\n\r\n[3] From _Roter_, beggar, vagabond, and _wälsch_, foreign.

Slang and Gibberish in the Gipsy\r\nlanguage are synonymous; but, as English adoptions, have meanings very\r\ndifferent from that given to them in their original.\r\n\r\n[7] “The vulgar tongue consists of two parts; the first is the Cant\r\nlanguage; the second, those burlesque phrases, quaint allusions,\r\nand nicknames for persons, things, and places, which, from long\r\nuninterrupted usage, are made classical by prescription.”—Grose’s\r\n_Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, 1st edition, 1785.\r\n\r\n[8] “Outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians.”—1530.\r\n\r\n[9] Jabber may be, after all, only another form of GABBER, GAB, very\r\ncommon in Old English, from the _Anglo-Saxon_, GÆBBAN.\r\n\r\n[10] This very proverb was mentioned by a young Gipsy to Crabb, some\r\nyears ago.—_Gipsies’ Advocate_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[11] _Gipsies in Spain_, vol. i. p. 18.\r\n\r\n[12] Shaks. _Henry IV._, part ii. act ii. scene 4.\r\n\r\n[13] It is but fair to imagine that cheat ultimately became synonymous\r\nwith “fraud,” when we remember that it was one of the most common words\r\nof the greatest class of impostors in the country.\r\n\r\n[14] We are aware that more than one eminent philologist states that the\r\norigin of “queer” is seen in the German _quer_, crooked,—hence strange\r\nand abnormal. While agreeing with this etymology, we have reason to\r\nbelieve that the word was first used in this country in a Cant sense.\r\n\r\n[15] Booget properly signifies a leathern wallet, and is probably\r\nderived from the _low Latin_, BULGA.

Borrow further commits himself\r\nby remarking that “Head’s Vocabulary has always been accepted as the\r\nspeech of the English Gipsies.” Nothing of the kind. Head professed to\r\nhave lived with the Gipsies, but in reality filched his words from\r\nDecker and Brome.\r\n\r\n[19] The modern meanings of a few of the old Cant words are given within\r\nbrackets.\r\n\r\n[20] This is a curious volume, and is worth from one to two guineas. The\r\nCanting Dictionary was afterwards reprinted, word for word, with the\r\ntitle of _The Scoundrel’s Dictionary_, in 1751. It was originally\r\npublished, without date, about the year 1710, by B. E., under the title\r\nof _A Dictionary of the Canting Crew_.\r\n\r\n[21] _Bacchus and Venus._—1737.\r\n\r\n[22] _London Labour and the London Poor._\r\n\r\n[23] Mayhew (vol. i. p. 217) speaks of a low lodging-house “in which\r\nthere were at one time five university men, three surgeons, and several\r\nsorts of broken-down clerks.” But old Harman’s saying, that “a wylde\r\nRoge is he that is _borne_ a roge,” will perhaps explain this seeming\r\nanomaly. There is, whatever may be the reason, no disputing the truth of\r\nthis latter statement, as there is not, we venture to say, a common\r\nlodging-house in London without broken-down gentlemen, who have been\r\ngentlemen very often far beyond the conventional application of the term\r\nto any one with a good coat on his back and money in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nHIEROGLYPHICS USED BY VAGABONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular chapters in a history of vagabondism would\r\ncertainly be “An Account of the Hieroglyphic Signs used by Tramps and\r\nThieves,” and it certainly would not be the least interesting. The\r\nreader may be startled to know that, in addition to a secret language,\r\nthe wandering tribes of this country have private marks and symbols with\r\nwhich to score their successes, failures, and advice to succeeding\r\nbeggars; in fact, there is no doubt that the country is really dotted\r\nover with beggars’ finger-posts and guide-stones. The subject was not\r\nlong since brought under the attention of the Government by Mr.\r\nRawlinson.[24] “There is,” he says in his report, “a sort of\r\nblackguards’ literature, and the initiated understand each other by\r\nSlang [Cant] terms, by pantomimic signs, and by hieroglyphics. The\r\nvagrant’s mark may be seen in Havant, on corners of streets, on\r\ndoor-posts, on house-steps. Simple as these chalk-lines appear, they\r\ninform the succeeding vagrants of all they require to know; and a few\r\nwhite scratches may say, ‘Be importunate,’ or ‘Pass on.’”\r\n\r\nAnother very curious account was taken from a provincial newspaper,\r\npublished in 1849, and forwarded to _Notes and Queries_,[25] under the\r\nhead of Mendicant Freemasonry. “Persons,” remarks the writer,\r\n“indiscreet enough to open their purses to the relief of the beggar\r\ntribe, would do well to take a readily-learned lesson as to the folly of\r\nthat misguided benevolence which encourages and perpetuates vagabondism.\r\nEvery door or passage is pregnant with instruction as to the error\r\ncommitted by the patron of beggars; as the beggar-marks show that a\r\nsystem of freemasonry is followed, by which a beggar knows whether it\r\nwill be worth his while to call into a passage or knock at a door. Let\r\nany one examine the entrances to the passages in any town, and there he\r\nwill find chalk marks, unintelligible to him, but significant enough to\r\nbeggars. If a thousand towns are examined, the same marks will be found\r\nat every passage entrance. The passage mark is a cypher with a twisted\r\ntail; in some cases the tail projects into the passage, in others\r\noutwardly; thus seeming to indicate whether the houses down the passage\r\nare worth calling at or not. Almost every door has its marks; these are\r\nvaried. In some cases there is a cross on the brickwork, in others a\r\ncypher; the figures ~1, 2, 3~ are also used. Every person may for\r\nhimself test the accuracy of these statements by the examination of the\r\nbrickwork near his own doorway—thus demonstrating that mendicity is a\r\nregular trade, carried out upon a system calculated to save time, and\r\nrealize the largest profits.” These remarks refer mainly to provincial\r\ntowns, London being looked upon as the tramps’ home, and therefore too\r\n“fly” or experienced to be duped by such means. The title it obtains,\r\nthat of “the Start,” or first place in everything, is significant of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nProvincial residents, who are more likely to view the foregoing extract\r\nwith an eye of suspicion than are those who live in a position\r\nto constantly watch for and profit by evidences of the secret\r\nintercommunication indulged in by the dangerous classes, should note, in\r\nfavour of the extract given, how significant is the practice of tramps\r\nand beggars calling in unfrequented localities, and how obvious it is\r\nthat they are directed by a code of signals at once complete and\r\nimperious. It is bad for a tramp who is discovered disobeying secret\r\norders. He is marked out and subjected to all kinds of annoyance by\r\nmeans of decoy hieroglyphs, until his life becomes a burden to him, and\r\nhe is compelled to starve or—most horrible of alternatives—go to work.\r\n\r\nThe only other notice of the hieroglyphs of vagabonds worth remarking is\r\nin Mayhew’s _London Labour and the London Poor_.[26] Mayhew obtained his\r\ninformation from two tramps, who stated that hawkers employ these signs\r\nas well as beggars. One tramp thus described the method of “working”[27]\r\na small town. “Two hawkers (‘pals’[27]) go together, but separate when\r\nthey enter a village, one taking one side of the road, and selling\r\ndifferent things, and so as to inform each other as to the character of\r\nthe people at whose houses they call, they chalk certain marks on their\r\ndoor-posts.” Another informant stated that “if a ‘patterer’[27] has been\r\n‘crabbed’” (that is, offended by refusal or exposure) “at any of the\r\n‘cribs’” (houses), “he mostly chalks a signal at or near the door.”\r\nThese hawkers were not of the ordinary, but of the tramp, class, who\r\ncarried goods more as a blind to their real designs than for the\r\npurposes of sale. They, in fact, represented the worst kinds of the two\r\nclasses. The law has comparatively recently improved these nondescript\r\ngentry off the face of the country, and the hawker of the present day is\r\ngenerally a man more sinned against than sinning.\r\n\r\nAnother use is also made of hieroglyphs. Charts of successful begging\r\nneighbourhoods are rudely drawn, and symbolical signs attached to each\r\nhouse to show whether benevolent or adverse.[28] “In many cases there is\r\nover the kitchen mantelpiece” of a tramps’ lodging-house “a map of the\r\ndistrict, dotted here and there with memorandums of failure or success.”\r\nA correct facsimile of one of these singular maps is given in this book.\r\nIt was obtained from the patterers and tramps who supplied a great many\r\nwords for this work, and who were employed by the original publisher in\r\ncollecting Old Ballads, Christmas Carols, Dying Speeches, and Last\r\nLamentations, as materials for a _History of Popular Literature_. The\r\nreader will, no doubt, be amused with the drawing. The locality depicted\r\nis near Maidstone, in Kent; and it was probably sketched by a wandering\r\nScreever[29] in payment for a night’s lodging. The English practice of\r\nmarking everything, and scratching names on public property, extends\r\nitself to the tribe of vagabonds. On the map, as may be seen in the\r\nleft-hand corner, some Traveller[29] has drawn a favourite or noted\r\nfemale, singularly nicknamed Three-quarter Sarah. What were the peculiar\r\naccomplishments of this lady to demand so uncommon a name, the reader\r\nwill be at a loss to discover; but a patterer says it probably refers to\r\na shuffling dance of that name, common in tramps’ lodging-houses, and in\r\nwhich “3/4 Sarah” may have been a proficient. Above her, three beggars\r\nor hawkers have reckoned their day’s earnings, amounting to 13s., and on\r\nthe right a tolerably correct sketch of a low hawker, or cadger, is\r\ndrawn. “To Dover, the _nigh_ way,” is the exact phraseology; and “hup\r\nhere,” a fair specimen of the self-acquired education of the\r\ndraughtsman. No key or explanation to the hieroglyphs was given in the\r\noriginal, because it would have been superfluous, when every inmate of\r\nthe lodging-house knew the marks from his cradle—or rather his mother’s\r\nback.\r\n\r\nShould there be no map, in most lodging-houses there is an old man who\r\nis guide to every “walk” in the vicinity, and who can tell on every\r\nround each house that is “good for a cold tatur.” The hieroglyphs that\r\nare used are:—\r\n\r\n☓ ~No good~; too poor, and know too much.\r\n\r\n◠+ ~Stop~,—If you have what they want, they will buy. They are pretty\r\n“fly” (knowing).\r\n\r\n⊃— ~Go in this direction~, it is better than the other road. Nothing\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n◇ ~Bone~ (good). Safe for a “cold tatur,” if for nothing else. “Cheese\r\nyour patter” (don’t talk much) here.\r\n\r\n▽ ~Cooper’d~ (spoilt), by too many tramps calling there.\r\n\r\n□ ~Gammy~ (unfavourable), like to have you taken up. Mind the dog.\r\n\r\n⦿ ~Flummuxed~ (dangerous), sure of a month in “quod” (prison).\r\n\r\n⊕ ~Religious~, but tidy on the whole.\r\n\r\nWhere did these signs come from? and when were they first used? are\r\nquestions which have been asked again and again, and the answers have\r\nbeen many and various. Knowing the character of the Gipsies, and\r\nascertaining from a tramp that they are well acquainted with the\r\nhieroglyphs, “and have been as long ago as ever he could remember,”\r\nthere is little fear of being wrong in ascribing the invention to them.\r\nHow strange it would be if some modern Belzoni, or Champollion—say Mr.\r\nGeorge Smith, for instance—discovered in these beggars’ marks traces of\r\nancient Egyptian or Hindoo sign-writing!\r\n\r\nThat the Gipsies were in the habit of leaving memorials of the road they\r\nhad taken, and the successes that had befallen them, is upon record. In\r\nan old book, _The Triumph of Wit_, 1724, there is a passage which\r\nappears to have been copied from some older work, and it runs\r\nthus:—“The Gipsies set out twice a year, and scatter all over England,\r\neach parcel having their appointed stages, that they may not interfere,\r\nnor hinder each other; and for that purpose, when they set forward in\r\nthe country, they stick up boughs in the way of divers kinds, according\r\nas it is agreed among them, that one company may know which way another\r\nis gone, and so take another road.” The works of Hoyland and Borrow\r\nsupply other instances.\r\n\r\nIt would be hardly fair to close this subject without drawing attention\r\nto the extraordinary statement that, actually on the threshold of the\r\ngibbet, the sign of the vagabond was to be met with! “The murderer’s\r\nsignal is even exhibited from the gallows; as a red handkerchief held in\r\nthe hand of the felon about to be executed is a token that he dies\r\nwithout having betrayed any professional secrets.”[30] Private\r\nexecutions have of course rendered this custom obsolete, even if it\r\never existed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the first editions of this work were published, the publishers\r\nhave received from various parts of England numerous evidences of the\r\nstill active use of beggars’ marks and mendicant hieroglyphs. One\r\ngentleman writes from Great Yarmouth to say that, whilst residing in\r\nNorwich, he used frequently to see them on the houses and street corners\r\nin the suburbs. Another gentleman, a clergyman, states that he has so\r\nfar made himself acquainted with the meanings of the signs employed,\r\nthat by himself marking the characters ◻ (gammy) and ⦿ (flummuxed) on\r\nthe gate-posts of his parsonage, he enjoys a singular immunity from\r\nalms-seekers and cadgers on the tramp. This hint may not be lost on many\r\nother sufferers from importunate beggars, yet its publication may lead\r\nto the introduction of a new code.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a popular constable’s guide,[31] giving the practice of justices in\r\npetty sessions, the following interesting paragraph is found,\r\ncorroborating what has just been said on the hieroglyphs used by\r\nvagabonds:—\r\n\r\n    “Gipsies follow their brethren by numerous marks, such as strewing\r\n    handfuls of grass in the daytime at a four lane or cross roads; the\r\n    grass being strewn down the road the gang have taken; also, by a\r\n    cross being made on the ground with a stick or knife—the longest\r\n    end of the cross denotes the route taken. In the night-time a cleft\r\n    stick is placed in the fence at the cross roads, with an arm\r\n    pointing down the road their comrades have taken. The marks are\r\n    always placed on the left-hand side, so that the stragglers can\r\n    easily and readily find them.”\r\n\r\nFrom the cleft stick here alluded to, we learn the origin and use of ⊃—,\r\nthe third hieroglyph in the vagabond’s private list. And the extract\r\nalso proves that the “rule of the road” is the same with tramps as with\r\nthat body which is morally less but physically more dangerous, the\r\nLondon drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Mr. Rawlinson’s _Report to the General Board of Health, Parish of\r\nHavant, Hampshire_.\r\n\r\n[25] Vol. v. p. 210.\r\n\r\n[26] Vol. i. pp. 218 and 247.\r\n\r\n[27] See Dictionary.\r\n\r\n[28] Sometimes, as appears from the following, the names of persons and\r\nhouses are written instead. “In almost every one of the padding-kens, or\r\nlow lodging-houses in the country, there is a list of walks pasted up\r\nover the kitchen mantelpiece.

It must be admitted, however, that within the past\r\nfew years they have become almost indivisible. They are both universal\r\nand ancient, and appear to have been, with certain exceptions, the\r\noffspring of gay, vulgar, or worthless persons in every part of the\r\nworld at every period of time. Indeed, if we are to believe implicitly\r\nthe saying of the wise man, that “there is nothing new under the sun,”\r\nthe “bloods” of buried Nineveh, with their knotty and door-matty-looking\r\nbeards, may have cracked Slang jokes on the steps of Sennacherib’s\r\npalace; while the stocks and stones of ancient Egypt, and the bricks of\r\nvenerable and used-up Babylon, may be covered with Slang hieroglyphs,\r\nwhich, being perfectly unknown to modern antiquaries, have long been\r\nstumbling-blocks to the philologist; so impossible is it at this day to\r\nsay what was then authorized, or what vulgar, language. The only\r\nobjection that can be raised to this idea is, that Slang was, so far as\r\ncan be discovered, traditional, and unwritten, until the appearance of\r\nthis volume, a state of things which accounts for its many changes, and\r\nthe doubtful orthography of even its best known and most permanent\r\nforms. Slang is almost as old as speech, and must date from the\r\ncongregating together of people in cities. It is the result of crowding,\r\nand excitement, and artificial life. We have traces of this as far as we\r\ncan refer back. Martial, the epigrammatist, is full of Slang. When an\r\nuninvited guest accompanied his friend, the Slang of the day styled him\r\nhis “umbra;” when a man was trussed, neck and heels, it called him\r\njocosely “quadrupus.” Slang is nowadays very often the only vehicle by\r\nwhich rodomontade may be avoided. It is often full of the most pungent\r\nsatire, and is always to the point. Without point Slang has no _raison\r\nd’être_.\r\n\r\nOld English Slang was coarser, and depended more upon downright\r\nvulgarity than our modern Slang. It was a jesting speech, or humorous\r\nindulgence for the thoughtless moment or the drunken hour, and it acted\r\nas a vent-peg for a fit of temper or irritability; but it did not\r\ninterlard and permeate every description of conversation as now. It was\r\nconfined to nicknames and improper subjects, and encroached but to a\r\nvery small extent upon the domain of authorized speech. Indeed, it was\r\nexceedingly limited when compared with the vast territory of Slang in\r\nsuch general favour and complete circulation at the present day. Still,\r\nalthough not an extensive institution, as in our time, Slang certainly\r\ndid exist in this country centuries ago, as we may see if we look down\r\nthe page of any respectable History of England. Cromwell was familiarly\r\ncalled “Old Noll,”—in much the same way as Bonaparte was termed\r\n“Boney,” and Wellington “Conkey” or “Nosey,” only a few years ago.[32]\r\nHis Legislature, too, was spoken of in a high-flavoured way as the\r\n“Barebones” or “Rump” Parliament, and his followers were nicknamed\r\n“Roundheads,” and the peculiar religious sects of his protectorate were\r\nstyled “Puritans” and “Quakers.”[33] The Civil War pamphlets, and the\r\nsatirical hits of the Cavaliers and the Commonwealth men, originated\r\nnumerous Slang words and vulgar similes in full use at the present\r\nmoment. Here is a field of inquiry for the Philological Society, indeed\r\na territory, for there are thirty thousand of these partisan tracts.\r\nLater still, in the court of Charles II., the naughty ladies and the gay\r\nlords, with Rochester at their head, talked Slang; and very naughty\r\nSlang it was too. Fops in those days, when “over head and ears” in debt,\r\nand in continual fear of arrest, termed their enemies, the bailiffs,\r\n“Philistines”[34] or “Moabites.” At a later period, when collars were\r\nworn detached from shirts, in order to save the expense of washing—an\r\nobject, it would seem, with needy “swells” in all ages—they obtained\r\nthe name of “Jacobites.” One-half of the coarse wit in Butler’s\r\n_Hudibras_ lurks in the vulgar words and phrases which he was so fond of\r\nemploying. These Slang phrases contained the marrow of his arguments\r\nstripped of all superfluous matter, and they fell with ponderous weight\r\nand terrible effect upon his opponents. They were more homely and\r\nforcible than the mild and elegant sentences of Cowley, and the people,\r\ntherefore, hurrahed them, and pronounced Butler one of themselves,—or,\r\nas we should say, in a joyful moment, “a jolly good fellow.” Orator\r\nHenley preached and prayed in Slang, and first charmed and then ruled\r\nthe dirty mobs in Lincoln’s Inn Fields by vulgarisms. Burly Grose\r\nmentions Henley, with the remark that we owe a great many Slang phrases\r\nto him, though even the worst Slang was refinement itself compared with\r\nmany of Henley’s most studied oratorical utterances, which proves that\r\nthe most blackguard parts of a blackguard speech may be perfectly free\r\nfrom either Slang or Cant. Swift, and old Sir Roger L’Estrange, and\r\nArbuthnot, were all fond of vulgar or Slang language; indeed, we may see\r\nfrom a Slang word used by the latter how curious is the gradual adoption\r\nof vulgar terms in our standard dictionaries. The worthy doctor, in\r\norder to annihilate (or, as we should say, with a fitting respect to the\r\nsubject under consideration, to “smash”) an opponent, thought proper on\r\nan occasion to use the word “cabbage,” not in the ancient sense of a\r\nflatulent vegetable of the kitchen-garden, but in the at once Slang\r\nsense of purloining or cribbing. Johnson soon met with the word, looked\r\nat it, examined it, weighed it, and shook his head, but out of respect\r\nto a brother doctor inserted it in his dictionary, labelling it,\r\nhowever, prominently “Cant;” whilst Walker and Webster, years after,\r\nwhen all over England “to cabbage” was to pilfer, placed the term in\r\ntheir dictionaries as an ancient and very respectable word. Another\r\nSlang term, “gull,” to cheat, or delude, sometimes varied to “gully,” is\r\nstated to be connected with the Dean of St. Patrick’s. “Gull,” a dupe,\r\nor a fool, is often used by our old dramatists, and is generally\r\nbelieved to have given rise to the verb; but a curious little edition of\r\n_Bamfylde Moore Carew_, published in 1827, says that “to gull,” or\r\n“gully,” is derived from the well-known Gulliver, the hero of the famous\r\nTravels. It may be from the phrase, “You can’t come Gulliver over me,”\r\nin use while the popularity of the book was hot. How crammed with Slang\r\nare the dramatic works of the last century! The writers of the comedies\r\nand farces in those days must have lived in the streets, and written\r\ntheir plays in the public-houses, so filled are they with vulgarisms and\r\nunauthorized words. The popular phrases, “I owe you one,” “That’s one\r\nfor his nob,” and “Keep moving, dad,” arose in this way.[35] The second\r\nof these sayings was, doubtless, taken from the card-table, for at\r\ncribbage the player who holds the knave of the suit turned up counts\r\n“one for his nob,” and the dealer who turns up a knave counts “two for\r\nhis heels.” From a dramatic point of view, the use of these phrases is\r\nperfectly correct, as they were in constant use among the people\r\nsupposed to be represented by the author’s characters.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Centlivre’s admirable comedy of _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_, we\r\nsee the origin of that popular phrase, the real Simon Pure. Simon Pure\r\nis the Quaker name adopted by Colonel Feignwell as a trick to obtain the\r\nhand of Mistress Anne Lovely in marriage. The veritable Quaker, the\r\n“real Simon Pure,” recommended by Aminadab Holdfast, of Bristol, as a\r\nfit sojourner with Obadiah Prim, arrives at last, to the discomfiture of\r\nthe Colonel, who, to maintain his position and gain time, concocts a\r\nletter in which the real Quaker is spoken of as a housebreaker who had\r\ntravelled in the “leather conveniency” from Bristol, and adopted the\r\ngarb and name of the western Quaker in order to pass off as the “Real\r\nSimon Pure,” but only for the purpose of robbing the house and cutting\r\nthe throat of the perplexed Obadiah. The scene in which the two Simon\r\nPures, the real and the counterfeit, meet, is one of the best in the\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\nTom Brown, of “facetious memory,” as his friends were wont to say, and\r\nNed Ward, who wrote humorous books, and when tired drew beer for his\r\ncustomers at his alehouse in Long Acre,[36] were both great producers of\r\nSlang in the last century, and to them we owe many popular current\r\nphrases and household words.\r\n\r\nWritten Slang was checked, rather than advanced, by the pens of\r\nAddison, Johnson, and Goldsmith; although Bee, the bottle-holder and\r\nhistoriographer of the pugilistic band of brothers in the youthful days\r\nof flat-nosed Tom Cribb, has gravely stated that Johnson, when young and\r\nrakish, contributed to an early volume of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ a\r\nfew pages, by way of specimen, of a slang dictionary, the result, Mr.\r\nBee says, “of his midnight ramblings!”[37] This statement is not only\r\nimprobable, but an investigation of the venerable magazine, though\r\nstrict and searching, produces no evidence in corroboration of Mr. Bee.\r\nGoldsmith, even, certainly coined a few words as occasion required,\r\nalthough as a rule his pen was pure and graceful, and adverse to\r\nneologisms. The word “fudge,” it has been stated, was first used by him\r\nin literary composition, although it probably originated with one\r\nCaptain Fudge, a notorious fibber, nearly a century before. Street\r\nphrases, nicknames, and vulgar words were continually being added\r\nto the great stock of popular Slang up to the commencement of\r\nthe present century, when it received numerous additions from pugilism,\r\nhorse-racing, and “fast” life generally, which suddenly came into great\r\npublic favour, and was at its height in the latter part of the reign of\r\nGeorge III., and in the early days of the Regency. Slang in those days\r\nwas generally termed “flash” language. It will thus be noted that the\r\nterm “flash” has in turn represented both Cant and Slang; now the word\r\nSlang has become perfectly generic. So popular was “flash” with the\r\n“bloods” of high life, that it constituted the best paying literary\r\ncapital for certain authors and dramatists. Pierce Egan issued\r\n_Boxiana_, and _Life in London_, six portly octavo volumes, crammed with\r\nSlang; and Moncrieff wrote the most popular farce of the day, _Tom and\r\nJerry_ (adapted from the latter work), which, to use newspaper Slang,\r\n“took the town by storm,” and, with its then fashionable vulgarisms,\r\nmade the fortune of the old Adelphi Theatre, and was without exception\r\nthe most wonderful instance of a continuous theatrical run in ancient or\r\nmodern times. This also was brimful of Slang. Other authors helped to\r\npopularize and extend Slang down to our own time, and it has now taken a\r\nsomewhat different turn, dropping many of the Cant and old vulgar words,\r\nand assuming a certain quaint and fashionable phraseology—familiar,\r\nutilitarian, and jovial. There can be no doubt that common speech is\r\ngreatly influenced by fashion, fresh manners, and that general change of\r\nideas which steals over a people once in a generation. But before\r\nproceeding further into the region of Slang, it will be well to say\r\nsomething on the etymology of the word.\r\n\r\nThe word Slang is only mentioned by two lexicographers—Webster and\r\nOgilvie.[38] Johnson, Walker, and the older compilers of dictionaries\r\ngive “slang” as the preterite of “sling,” but not a word about Slang in\r\nthe sense of low, vulgar, or unrecognised language. The origin of the\r\nword has often been asked for in literary journals and books, but only\r\none man, until recently, ever hazarded an etymology—Jonathan Bee.[39]\r\nWith a recklessness peculiar to ignorance, Bee stated that Slang was\r\nderived from “the _slangs_ or fetters worn by prisoners, having acquired\r\nthat name from the manner in which they were worn, as they required a\r\nsling of string to keep them off the ground.” Bee had just been nettled\r\nat Pierce Egan’s producing a new edition of Grose’s _Dictionary of the\r\nVulgar Tongue_, and was determined to excel in a vulgar dictionary of\r\nhis own, which should be more racy, more pugilistic, and more original.\r\nHow far he succeeded in this latter particular, his ridiculous etymology\r\nof Slang will show. Slang is not an English word; it is the Gipsy term\r\nfor their secret language, and its synonym is Gibberish—another word\r\nwhich was believed to have had no distinct origin.[40] Grose—stout and\r\nburly Captain Grose—whom we may characterize as the greatest antiquary,\r\njoker, and porter-drinker of his day, was the first lexicographer to\r\nrecognise the word “Slang.” It occurs in his _Classical Dictionary of\r\nthe Vulgar Tongue_, of 1785, with the statement that it implies “Cant or\r\nvulgar language.” Grose was a great favourite with Burns, and so pleased\r\nhim by his extensive powers of story-telling and grog-imbibing, that the\r\ncompanionable and humour-loving Scotch bard wrote for his fat\r\nfriend—or, to use his own words, “the fine, fat, fodgel wight”—the\r\nimmortal poem of _Tam O’ Shanter_.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while troubling the reader with a long account of the\r\ntransformation into an English term of the word Slang, as it is easily\r\nseen how we obtained it. Hucksters and beggars on tramp, or at fairs and\r\nraces, associate and frequently join in any rough enterprise with the\r\nGipsies. The word would be continually heard by them, and would in this\r\nmanner soon become part of their vocabulary,[41] and, when carried by\r\n“fast” or vulgar fashionables from the society of thieves and low\r\ncharacters to their own drawing-rooms, would as quickly become Slang,\r\nand the representative term for all vulgar language. Modern philologists\r\ngive the word Slang as derived from the French _langue_. This is, at all\r\nevents, as likely as any other derivative.\r\n\r\nAny sudden excitement or peculiar circumstance is quite sufficient to\r\noriginate and set going a score of Slang words. Nearly every election or\r\npublic agitation throws out offshoots of excitement, or scintillations\r\nof humour in the shape of Slang terms—vulgar at first, but at length\r\nadopted, if possessing sufficient hold on the public mind, as\r\nsemi-respectable from sheer force of habit. There is scarcely a\r\ncondition or calling in life that does not possess its own peculiar\r\nSlang. The professions, legal and medical, have each familiar and\r\nunauthorized terms for peculiar circumstances and things, and it is\r\nquite certain that the clerical calling, or “the cloth”—in itself a\r\nSlang term given at a time when the laity were more distinguished by\r\ntheir gay dress from the clergy than they are now—is not entirely free\r\nfrom this peculiarity. Every workshop, warehouse, factory, and mill\r\nthroughout the country has its Slang, and so have the public schools and\r\nthe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Sea Slang constitutes the\r\nprincipal charm of a sailor’s “yarn;” and our soldiers have in turn\r\ntheir peculiar nicknames and terms for things and subjects, proper and\r\nimproper. A writer in _Household Words_ (No. 183) has gone so far as to\r\nremark, that a person “shall not read one single parliamentary debate,\r\nas reported in a first-class newspaper, without meeting scores of Slang\r\nwords,” and “that from Mr. Speaker in his chair, to the Cabinet\r\nMinisters whispering behind it—from mover to seconder, from true blue\r\nProtectionist to extremest Radical—Mr. Barry’s New House echoes and\r\nre-echoes with Slang.” This statement is most worthy of notice, as\r\nshowing how, with a very small sub-stratum of fact, a plausible, though\r\nnot the less gigantic, mis-statement may be built up.\r\n\r\nThe universality of Slang is extraordinary. Let any person for a short\r\ntime narrowly examine the conversation of his dearest and nearest\r\nfriends, or even analyse his own supposed correct talk, and he shall be\r\namazed at the numerous unauthorized, and what we can only call vulgar,\r\nwords in constant use. One peculiarity of the growth of Slang is the\r\nfinding of new meanings for old words. Take, for instance, the verbs\r\n“do,” “cut,” “go,” and “take,” and see how they are used to express\r\nfresh ideas, and then let us ask ourselves how is it possible for a\r\nFrenchman or German, be he never so well educated, to avoid continually\r\nblundering and floundering amongst our little words when trying to make\r\nhimself understood in an ordinary conversation? He may have studied our\r\nlanguage the required time, and have gone through the usual amount of\r\n“grinding,” and practised the common allotment of patience, but all to\r\nno purpose as far as accuracy is concerned. As, however, we do not make\r\nour language, nor for the matter of that our Slang, for the convenience\r\nor inconvenience of foreigners, we need not pursue this portion of the\r\nsubject further. “Jabber” and “hoax” were Slang and Cant terms in\r\nSwift’s time; so, indeed, were “mob” and “sham.”[42] Words directly from\r\nthe Latin and Greek, framed in accordance with the rules which govern\r\nthe construction of the language, are not Slang, but are good English,\r\nif not Saxon,—a term, by the way, which is as much misused as any\r\nunfortunate word that can be remembered just now. Sound contributes many\r\nSlang words—a source that etymologists frequently overlook. Nothing\r\npleases an ignorant person so much as a high-sounding term, “full of\r\nfury.” How melodious and drum-like are those vulgar coruscations\r\n“rumbumptious,” “slantingdicular,” “splendiferous,” “rumbustious,” and\r\n“ferricadouzer.” What a “pull” the sharp-nosed lodging-house-keeper\r\nthinks she has over her victims if she can but hurl such testimonies of\r\na liberal education at them when they are disputing her charges, and\r\nthreatening to “absquatulate!” In the United States the vulgar-genteel\r\neven excel the poor “stuck-up” Cockneys in their formation of a native\r\nfashionable language. How charming to a refined ear are “abskize,”\r\n“catawampously,” “exflunctify,” “obscute,” “keslosh,” “kesouse,”\r\n“keswollop,” and “kewhollux!”[43] It must not be forgotten, however,\r\nthat a great many new “Americanisms” are perfectly unknown in America,\r\nand in this respect they resemble the manners and customs of our cousins\r\nas found in books, and in books only. Vulgar words representing action\r\nand brisk movement often owe their origin to sound, as has before been\r\nremarked. Mispronunciation, too, is another great source of vulgar or\r\nSlang words, and of this “ramshackle,” “shackly,” “nary-one” for neither\r\nor neither one, “ottomy” or “atomy” for anatomy, “rench” for rinse, are\r\nspecimens. The commonalty dislike frequently-occurring words difficult\r\nof pronunciation, and so we have the street abridgments of “bimeby” for\r\nby-and-by, “caze” for because, “gin” for given, “hankercher” for\r\nhandkerchief, “ruma tiz” for rheumatism, “backer” for tobacco, and many\r\nothers, not perhaps Slang, but certainly, all vulgarisms. Whately, in\r\nhis _Remains of Bishop Copleston_, has inserted a leaf from the bishop’s\r\nnote-book on the popular corruption of names, mentioning, among others,\r\n“kickshaws,” as from the French _quelques choses_; “beefeater,” the\r\ngrotesque guardian of royalty in a procession, and the envied devourer\r\nof enormous beefsteaks, as but a vulgar pronunciation of the French\r\n_buffetier_, and “George and Cannon,” the sign of a public-house, as\r\nnothing but a corruption (although so soon!) of the popular premier of\r\nthe last generation, George Canning.[44] Literature has its Slang terms;\r\nand the desire on the part of writers to say funny and startling things\r\nin a novel and curious way contributes many unauthorized words to the\r\ngreat stock of Slang.\r\n\r\nFashionable or Upper-class Slang is of several varieties. There is the\r\nBelgravian, military and naval, parliamentary, dandy, and the reunion\r\nand visiting Slang. English officers, civilians, and their families,\r\nwho have resided long in India, have contributed many terms from the\r\nHindostanee to our language. Several of these, such as “chit,” a letter,\r\nand “tiffin,” lunch, are fast losing their Slang character, and becoming\r\nregularly-recognised English words. “Jungle,” as a term for a forest or\r\nwilderness, is now an English phrase; a few years past, however, it was\r\nmerely the Hindostanee “junkul.” This, being a perfectly legal\r\ntransition, having no other recognised form, can hardly be characterized\r\nas Slang. The extension of trade in China, and the English settlement of\r\nHong Kong, have introduced among us several examples of Canton jargon,\r\nthat exceedingly curious Anglo-Chinese dialect spoken in the seaports of\r\nthe Celestial Empire. While these words have been carried as it were\r\ninto the families of the upper and middle classes, persons in a humbler\r\nrank of life, through the sailors and soldiers and Lascar and Chinese\r\nbeggars that haunt the metropolis, have also adopted many Anglo-Indian\r\nand Anglo-Chinese phrases. As this dictionary would have been incomplete\r\nwithout them, they are carefully recorded in its pages. Concerning the\r\nSlang of the fashionable world, it has been remarked that it is mostly\r\nimported from France; and that an unmeaning gibberish of Gallicisms runs\r\nthrough English fashionable conversation and fashionable novels, and\r\naccounts of fashionable parties in the fashionable newspapers. Yet,\r\nludicrously enough, immediately the fashionable magnates of England\r\nseize on any French idiom, the French themselves not only universally\r\nabandon it to us, but positively repudiate it altogether from their\r\nidiomatic vocabulary. If you were to tell a well-bred Frenchman that\r\nsuch and such an aristocratic marriage was on the _tapis_, he would\r\nstare with astonishment, and look down on the carpet in the startled\r\nendeavour to find a marriage in so unusual a place. If you were to talk\r\nto him of the _beau monde_, he would imagine you meant the world which\r\nGod made, not half-a-dozen streets and squares between Hyde Park Corner\r\nand Chelsea Bun House. The _thé dansant_ would be completely\r\ninexplicable to him. If you were to point out to him the Dowager Lady\r\nGrimgriffin acting as _chaperon_ to Lady Amanda Creamville, he would\r\nimagine you were referring to the _petit Chaperon rouge_—to little\r\nRed-Riding Hood. He might just understand what was meant by _vis-à-vis_,\r\n_entremets_, and some others of the flying horde of frivolous little\r\nforeign slangisms hovering about fashionable cookery and fashionable\r\nfurniture; but three-fourths of them would seem to him as barbarous\r\nFrench provincialisms, or, at best, but as antiquated and obsolete\r\nexpressions, picked out of the letters of Mademoiselle Scuderi, or the\r\ntales of Crebillon “the younger.” Servants, too, appropriate the scraps\r\nof French conversation which fall from their masters’ guests at the\r\ndinner table, and forthwith in the world of flunkeydom the word “know”\r\nis disused, and the lady’s-maid, in doubt on a particular point, asks\r\nJohn whether or no he “saveys” it?[45] What, too, can be more abominable\r\nthan that heartless piece of fashionable newspaper Slang, regularly\r\nemployed when speaking of the successful courtship of young people in\r\nthe aristocratic world:—\r\n\r\n    MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.—We understand that a marriage is ARRANGED (!)\r\n    betwixt the Lady, &c. &c., and the Honourable, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n“Arranged!” Is that cold-blooded Smithfield or Mark Lane term for a sale\r\nor a purchase the proper word to express the hopeful, joyous, golden\r\nunion of young and trustful hearts? Possibly, though, the word is often\r\nused with a due regard to facts, for marriages, especially amongst our\r\nupper classes, are not always “made in heaven.” Which is the proper way\r\nto pronounce the names of great people, and what the correct authority?\r\nLord Cowper, we are often assured, is Lord _Cooper_—on this principle\r\nLord Cowley would certainly be Lord _Cooley_—and Mr. Carew, we are\r\ntold, should be Mr. _Carey_, Ponsonby should be _Punsunby_, Eyre should\r\nbe _Aire_, Cholmondeley should be _Chumley_, St. John _Sinjen_,\r\nBeauchamp should be _Beachem_, Majoribanks _Marshbanks_, and Powell\r\nshould always be _Poel_. The pronunciation of proper names has long been\r\nan anomaly in the conversation of the upper classes of this country.\r\nHodge and Podge, the clodhoppers of Shakspeare’s time, talked in their\r\nmug-houses of the great Lords _Darbie_, _Barkelie_, and _Bartie_. In\r\nPall Mall and May Fair these personages are spoken of in exactly the\r\nsame manner at the present day, whilst in the City, and amongst the\r\n_middle_ classes, we only hear of Derby, Berkeley, &c.,—the correct\r\npronunciations, if the spelling is worth aught. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that the pronunciation of the upper classes, as\r\nregards the names of places just mentioned, is a relic of old times when\r\nthe orthography was different. The middle-class man is satisfied to take\r\nmatters the modern way, but even he, when he wishes to be thought a\r\nswell, alters his style. In fact, the old rule as to proper names being\r\npronounced according to individual taste, is, and ever will be, of\r\nabsolute necessity, not only as regards the upper and middle, but the\r\nlower classes. A costermonger is ignorant of such a place as Birmingham,\r\nbut understands you in a moment if you talk of _Brummagem_. Why do not\r\nPall Mall exquisites join with the costermongers in this pronunciation?\r\nIt is the ancient one.[46]\r\n\r\n_Parliamentary Slang_, excepting a few peculiar terms connected with\r\n“_the_ House” (scarcely Slang), is mainly composed of fashionable,\r\nliterary, and learned Slang. When members get excited, and wish to be\r\nforcible, they are now and again, but not very often, found guilty of\r\nvulgarisms, and then may be not particular which of the street terms\r\nthey select, providing it carries, as good old Dr. South said, plenty of\r\n“wildfire” in it. Lord Cairns when Sir Hugh, and a member of the Lower\r\nHouse, spoke of “that homely but expressive phrase, ‘dodge.’” Out of\r\n“the House,” several Slang terms are used in connexion with Parliament\r\nor members of Parliament. If Lord Palmerston was familiar by name to the\r\ntribes of the Caucasus and Asia Minor as a great foreign diplomatist,\r\nwhen the name of our Queen was unknown to the inhabitants of those\r\nparts—as was once stated in the _Times_—it is worthy of remark that,\r\namongst the costers and the wild inhabitants of the streets, he was at\r\nthat time better known as “Pam.” The cabmen on the “ranks” in Piccadilly\r\nhave been often heard to call each other’s attention to the great\r\nleader of the Opposition in the following expressive manner—“Hollo,\r\nthere! de yer see old ‘Dizzy’ doing a stump?” A “plumper” is a single\r\nvote at an election—not a “split-ticket;” and electors who had occupied\r\na house, no matter how small, and boiled a pot in it, thus qualifying\r\nthemselves for voting, used in the good old days to be termed\r\n“potwallopers.” A quiet “walk over” is a re-election without opposition\r\nand much cost; and is obtained from the sporting vocabulary, in which\r\nthe term is not Slang. A “caucus” meeting refers to the private\r\nassembling of politicians before an election, when candidates are\r\nchosen, and measures of action agreed upon. The term comes from America,\r\nwhere caucus means a meeting simply. A “job,” in political phraseology,\r\nis a Government office or contract obtained by secret influence or\r\nfavouritism; and is not a whit more objectionable in sound than is the\r\nnefarious proceeding offensive to the sense of those who pay but do not\r\nparticipate. The _Times_ once spoke of “the patriotic member of\r\nParliament ‘potted out’ in a dusty little lodging somewhere about Bury\r\nStreet.” But then the _Times_ was not always the mildly respectable\r\nhigh-class paper it now is, as a reference to the columns devoted by it\r\nto Macaulay’s official career will alone determine. These, which\r\nappeared during the present reign, would be far below the lowest\r\njournalistic taste nowadays; yet they are in keeping with the rest of\r\nthe political references made at that time by the now austere and\r\nhigh-principled “leading journal.” The term “quockerwodger,” although\r\nreferring to a wooden toy figure which jerks its limbs about when pulled\r\nby a string, has been supplemented with a political meaning. A\r\npseudo-politician, whose strings of action are pulled by somebody else,\r\nis often termed a “quockerwodger.” From an early period politics and\r\npartyism have attracted unto themselves quaint Slang terms. Horace\r\nWalpole quotes a party nickname of February, 1742, as a Slang word of\r\nthe day:—“The Tories declare against any further prosecution, if Tories\r\nthere are, for now one hears of nothing but the ‘broad-bottom;’ it is\r\nthe reigning Cant word, and means the taking all parties and people,\r\nindifferently, into the Ministry.” Thus “broad-bottom” in those days was\r\nSlang for “coalition.” The term “rat,” too, in allusion to rats\r\ndeserting vessels about to sink, has long been employed towards those\r\nturncoat politicians who change their party for interest. Who that\r\noccasionally passes near the Houses of Parliament has not often noticed\r\nstout or careful M.P.’s walk briskly through the Hall, and on the\r\nkerb-stone in front, with umbrella or walking-cane uplifted, shout to\r\nthe cabmen on the rank, “Four-wheeler!” The term is both useful and\r\nexpressive; but it is none the less Slang, though of a better kind than\r\n“growler,” used to denominate the same kind of vehicle, or “shoful,” the\r\nstreet term for a hansom cab.\r\n\r\nMilitary Slang is on a par, and of a character, with dandy Slang.\r\nInconvenient friends, or elderly and lecturing relatives, are pronounced\r\n“dreadful bores.” This affectionate term, like most other Slang phrases\r\nwhich have their rise in a certain section of society, has spread and\r\nbecome of general application. Four-wheeled cabs are called “bounders;”\r\nand a member of the Four-in-hand Club, driving to Epsom on the Derby\r\nDay, would, using fashionable phraseology, speak of it as “tooling his\r\ndrag down to the Derby.” A vehicle, if not a “drag” (or dwag), is a\r\n“trap,” or a “cask;” and if the “turn-out” happens to be in other than a\r\ntrim condition, it is pronounced at once as not “down the road,” unless\r\nthe critic should prefer to characterize the equipage as “dickey.” Your\r\nCity swell would say it is not “up to the mark;” whilst the costermonger\r\nwould call it a “wery snide affair.” In the army a barrack or military\r\nstation is known as a “lobster-box;” to “cram” for an examination is to\r\n“mug-up” (this same term is much in vogue among actors, who regard\r\nmugging-up as one of the fine arts of the profession); to reject from\r\nthe examination is to “spin;” and that part of the barrack occupied by\r\nsubalterns is frequently spoken of as the “rookery.” In dandy or swell\r\nSlang, any celebrity, from the Poet-Laureate to the Pope of Rome, is a\r\n“swell,”—“the old swell” now occupies the place once held by the\r\n“guv’nor.” Wrinkled-faced old professors, who hold dress and fashionable\r\ntailors in abhorrence, are called “awful swells,”—if they happen to be\r\nvery learned or clever. In this upper-class Slang, a title is termed a\r\n“handle;” trousers, “inexpressibles,” and bags, or “howling bags,” when\r\nof a large pattern;—a superior appearance, or anything above the common\r\ncut, is styled “extensive;” a four-wheeled cab is called a “birdcage;” a\r\ndance, a “hop;” dining at another man’s table, “sitting under his\r\nmahogany;” anything flashy or showy, “loud;” the peculiar make or cut of\r\na coat, its “build;” full dress, “full fig;” wearing clothes which\r\nrepresent the very extreme of fashion, “dressing to death;” a dinner or\r\nsupper party, a “spread;” a friend (or a “good fellow”), a “trump;” a\r\ndifficulty, a “screw loose;” and everything that is unpleasant, “from\r\nbad sherry to a writ from a tailor,” “jeuced infernal.” The phrase, “to\r\nsend a man to Coventry,” or permit no person “in the set” to speak to\r\nhim, although an ancient saying, must still be considered Slang.\r\n\r\nThe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the great public schools,\r\nare the hotbeds of fashionable Slang. Growing boys and high-spirited\r\nyoung fellows detest restraint of all kinds, and prefer making a dash at\r\nlife in a Slang phraseology of their own to all the set forms and\r\nsyntactical rules of _Alma Mater_. Many of the most expressive words in\r\na common chit-chat, or free-and-easy conversation, are old university\r\nvulgarisms. “Cut,” in the sense of dropping an acquaintance, was\r\noriginally a Cambridge form of speech; and “hoax,” to deceive or\r\nridicule, we are informed by Grose, was many years since an Oxford term.\r\nAmong the words that fast society has borrowed from our great\r\nscholastic—not establishments (they are sacred to linendrapery and\r\n“gentlemanly assistants”)—institutions, is found “crib,” a house or\r\napartments; “dead men,” empty wine bottles; “drawing teeth,”[47]\r\nwrenching off knockers,—an obsolete amusement; “fizzing,” first-rate,\r\nor splendid; “governor,” or “relieving-officer,” the general term for a\r\nmale parent; “plucked,” defeated or turned back, now altered to\r\n“plough;” “quiz,” to scrutinize, or a prying old fellow; and “row,” a\r\nnoisy disturbance. The Slang words in use at Oxford and Cambridge would\r\nalone fill a volume. As examples let us take “scout,” which at Oxford\r\nrefers to an undergraduate’s valet, whilst the same menial at Cambridge\r\nis termed a “gyp,”—popularly derived by the Cantabs from the Greek,\r\nγὺψ, a vulture; “skull,” the head, or master, of a college; “battles,”\r\nthe Oxford term for rations, changed at Cambridge into “commons.” The\r\nterm “dickey,” a half-shirt, it is said, originated with the students of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, who at first styled it a “tommy,” from the\r\nGreek τομὴ, a section,—the change from “tommy” to “dickey” requires no\r\nexplanation. “Crib,” a literal translation, is now universal; “grind”\r\nrefers to “working up” for an examination, also to a walk or\r\n“constitutional;” “Hivite” is a student of St. Begh’s (St. Bee’s)\r\nCollege, Cumberland; to “japan,” in this Slang speech, is to ordain;\r\n“mortar board” is a square college cap; “sim,” a student of a\r\nMethodistical turn—in allusion to the Rev. Charles Simeon; “sloggers,”\r\nat Cambridge, refers to the second division of race-boats, known at\r\nOxford as “torpids;” “sport” is to show or exhibit; “trotter” is the\r\njocose term for a tailor’s man who goes round for orders; and “tufts”\r\nare privileged students who dine with the “dons,” and are distinguished\r\nby golden tufts, or tassels, in their caps. Hence we get the world-wide\r\nSlang term “tuft-hunter,” one whose pride it is to be acquainted with\r\nscions of the nobility—a sycophantic race unfortunately not confined\r\nto any particular place or climate, nor peculiar to any age or either\r\nsex. There are many terms in use at Oxford not known at Cambridge; and\r\nsuch Slang names as “coach,” “gulf,” “harry-soph,” “poker,” or\r\n“post-mortem,” common enough at Cambridge, are seldom or never heard\r\nat the great sister University. For numerous other examples of college\r\nSlang the reader is referred to the Dictionary.\r\n\r\nReligious Slang, strange as the compound may appear, exists with other\r\ndescriptions of vulgar speech at the present day. _Punch_, in one of\r\nthose half-humorous, half-serious articles, once so characteristic of\r\nthe wits engaged on that paper, who were, as a rule, fond of lecturing\r\nany national abuse or popular folly, remarked—“Slang has long since\r\npenetrated into the Forum, and now we meet it in the Senate, and even\r\nthe pulpit itself is no longer free from its intrusion.” There is no\r\nwish here, for one moment, to infer that the practice is general. On the\r\ncontrary, and in justice to the clergy, it must be said that the\r\nprincipal disseminators of pure English throughout the country are the\r\nministers of our Established Church. Yet it cannot be denied that a\r\ngreat deal of Slang phraseology and expressive vulgarism have gradually\r\ncrept into the very pulpits which should give forth as pure speech as\r\ndoctrine. This is an error which, however, has only to be noticed, to be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nDean Conybeare, in his able “Essay on Church Parties,”[48] has noticed\r\nthis addition of Slang to our pulpit speech. As stated in his Essay, the\r\npractice appears to confine itself mainly to the exaggerated forms of\r\nthe High and Low Church—the Tractarians and the “Recordites.”[49] By\r\nway of illustration, the Dean cites the evening parties, or social\r\nmeetings, common amongst the wealthier lay members of the Recordite\r\nchurches, where the principal topics discussed—one or more favourite\r\nclergymen being present in a quasi-official manner—are “the merits and\r\ndemerits of different preachers, the approaching restoration of the\r\nJews, the date of the Millennium, the progress of the ‘Tractarian\r\nheresy,’ and the anticipated ‘perversion’ of High Church neighbours.”\r\nThese subjects are canvassed in a dialect differing considerably from\r\nEnglish, as the word is generally understood. The terms “faithful,”\r\n“tainted,” “acceptable,” “decided,” “legal,” and many others,\r\nare used in a sense different from that given to any of them by the\r\nlexicographers. We hear that Mr. A. has been more “owned” than Mr. B.;\r\nand that Mr. C. has more “seals”[50] than Mr. D. Again, the word\r\n“gracious” is invested with a meaning as extensive as that attached by\r\nyoung ladies to nice. Thus, we hear of a “gracious sermon,” a “gracious\r\nmeeting,” a “gracious child,” and even a “gracious whipping.” The word\r\n“dark” has also a new and peculiar usage. It is applied to every person,\r\nbook, or place not impregnated with Recordite principles. A ludicrous\r\nmisunderstanding resulting from this phraseology is on record (this is\r\nnot a joke). “What did you mean,” said A. to B., “by telling me that\r\n---- was such a very ‘dark’ village? I rode over there to-day, and found\r\nthe street particularly broad and cheerful, and there is not a tree in\r\nthe place.” “The gospel is not preached there,” was B’s. laconic reply.\r\nThe conclusion of one of these singular evening parties is generally\r\nmarked by an “exposition”—an unseasonable sermon of nearly one hour’s\r\nduration, circumscribed by no text, and delivered from the table by one\r\nof the clerical visitors with a view to “improve the occasion.” This\r\nsame term, “improve the occasion,” is of Slang slangy, and is so mouthed\r\nby Stigginses and Chadbands, and their followers, that it has become\r\npeculiarly objectionable to persons of broad views. In the Essay to\r\nwhich reference has been made, the religious Slang terms for the two\r\ngreat divisions of the Established Church receive some explanation. The\r\nold-fashioned High Church party—rich and “stagnant,” noted for its\r\n“sluggish mediocrity, hatred of zeal, dread of innovation, abuse of\r\nDissent, blundering and languid utterance”—is called the “high and\r\ndry;” whilst the opposing division, known as the Low Church—equally\r\nstagnant with the former, but poorer, and more lazily inclined (from\r\nabsence of education) towards Dissent—receives the nickname of the “low\r\nand slow.” These terms are among persons learned in the distinctions\r\nshortened, in ordinary conversation, to the “dry” and the “slow.” The\r\nBroad Church, or moderate division, is often spoken of as the “broad\r\nand shallow.”\r\n\r\nWhat can be more objectionable than the irreverent and offensive manner\r\nin which many Dissenting ministers continually pronounce the names of\r\nthe Deity—God and Lord? God, instead of pronouncing in the plain and\r\nbeautiful simple old English way, “G‑o‑d,” they drawl out into “Gorde”\r\nor “Gaude;” and Lord, instead of speaking in the proper way, they\r\ndesecrate into “Loard” or “Loerd,”—lingering on the _u_, or the _r_, as\r\nthe case may be, until an honest hearer feels disgusted, and almost\r\ninclined to run the gauntlet of beadles and deacons, and pull the vulgar\r\npreacher from his pulpit. This is, though a Christian impulse, hardly in\r\naccordance with our modern times and tolerant habits. Many young\r\npreachers strive hard to acquire this peculiar pronunciation, in\r\nimitation of the older ministers. What, then, can more properly be\r\ncalled Slang, or, indeed, the most objectionable of Slang, than this\r\nstudious endeavour to pronounce the most sacred names in a uniformly\r\nvulgar and unbecoming manner? If the old-fashioned preacher whistled\r\nCant through his nose, the modern vulgar reverend whines Slang from the\r\nmore natural organ. These vagaries of speech will, perhaps, by an\r\napologist, be termed “pulpit peculiarities,” and the writer may be\r\nimpugned for having dared to intermeddle with a subject that is or\r\nshould be removed from his criticisms. Honesty of purpose and evident\r\ntruthfulness of remark will, however, overcome the most virulent\r\nopposition. The terms used by the mob towards the Church, however\r\nilliberal and satirically vulgar, are fairly within the province of an\r\ninquiry such as the present. A clergyman, in vulgar language, is spoken\r\nof as a “choker,” a “cushion-thumper,” a “dominie,” an “earwig,” a\r\n“gospel-grinder,” a “grey-coat parson;” a “spouter,” a “white-choker,”\r\nor a “warming-pan rector,” if he only holds the living _pro tempore_. If\r\nhe is a lessee of the great tithes, “one in ten;” or if spoken of by an\r\nAnglo-Indian, a “rook.” If a Tractarian, his outer garment is rudely\r\nspoken of as a “pygostole,” or “M. B. (mark of the beast) coat.” His\r\nprofession is termed “the cloth” (this item of Slang has been already\r\nreferred to), and his practice is called “tub-thumping.” This latter\r\nterm has of late years been almost peculiarly confined to itinerant\r\npreachers. Should he belong to the Dissenting body, he is probably\r\nstyled a “pantiler,” or a “psalm smiter,” or perhaps, a “swaddler.”[51]\r\nHis chapel, too, is spoken of as a “schism shop.” A Roman Catholic is\r\ncoarsely named a “brisket-beater.”\r\n\r\nParticular as lawyers generally are about the meanings of words, they\r\nhave not prevented an unauthorized phraseology from arising, which may\r\nbe termed legal Slang. So forcibly did this truth impress a late writer,\r\nthat he wrote in a popular journal, “You may hear Slang every day in\r\nterm from barristers in their robes, at every mess-table, at every\r\nbar-mess, at every college commons, and in every club dining-room.”\r\nSwift, in his _Art of Polite Conversation_ (p. 15), published a century\r\nand a half ago, states that “vardi” was the Slang in his time for\r\n“verdict.” A few of the most common and well-known terms used out of\r\ndoors, with reference to legal matters, are “cook,” to hash or make up a\r\nbalance-sheet; “dipped,” mortgaged; “dun” (from a famous writ or\r\nprocess-server named Dunn), to solicit payment; “fullied,” to be “fully\r\ncommitted for trial;” “land shark,” a sailor’s definition of a lawyer;\r\n“limb of the law,” a milder term for the same “professional;” “monkey\r\nwith a long tail,” a mortgage; “mouthpiece,” the thief’s term for his\r\ncounsel; “to run through the ring,” to take advantage of the Insolvency\r\nAct; “smash,” to become bankrupt; “snipe,” an attorney with a long bill;\r\nand “whitewash,” to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act. Comparatively\r\nrecent legislation has rendered many of these terms obsolete, and “in\r\nliquidation” is now the most ominous sound a creditor can hear. Lawyers,\r\nfrom their connexion with the police courts, and transactions with\r\npersons in every grade of society, have ample opportunities for\r\nacquiring street Slang, of which, in cross-questioning and wrangling,\r\nthey frequently avail themselves.\r\n\r\nIt has been said there exists a literary Slang, or the Slang of\r\nCriticism—dramatic, artistic, and scientific. This is composed of such\r\nwords as “æsthetic,” “transcendental,” “the harmonies,” “the unities,” a\r\n“myth;” such phrases as “an exquisite _morceau_ on the big drum,” a\r\n“scholarlike rendering of John the Baptist’s great toe,” “keeping\r\nharmony,” “middle distance,” “aërial perspective,” “delicate handling,”\r\n“nervous chiaroscuro,” and the like. It is easy to find fault with this\r\nsystem of doing work, whilst it is not easy to discover another at once\r\nso easily understood by educated readers, and so satisfactory to artists\r\nthemselves. Discretion must, of course, always be used, in fact always\r\nis used by the best writers, with regard to the quantity of technical\r\nSlang an article will hold comfortably. Overdone mannerism is always a\r\nmistake, and generally defeats its own end. Properly used, these\r\ntechnicalities are allowable as the generous inflections and bendings of\r\na bountiful language, for the purpose of expressing fresh phases of\r\nthought, and ideas not yet provided with representative words.[52]\r\n_Punch_ often employs a Slang term to give point to a joke, or humour to\r\na line of satire. In his best day he gave an original etymology of the\r\nschoolboy-ism “slog.” “Slog,” said the classical and then clever\r\n_Punch_, is derived from the Greek word “slogo,” to baste, to wallop, to\r\nslaughter. To show his partiality to the subject, he once amused his\r\nreaders with two columns on Slang and Sanscrit, from which the following\r\nis taken:—\r\n\r\n    “The allegory which pervades the conversation of all Eastern nations\r\n    is the foundation of Western Slang; and the increased number of\r\n    students of the Oriental languages, especially since Sanscrit and\r\n    Arabic have been made subjects for the Indian Civil Service\r\n    examinations, may have contributed to supply the English language\r\n    with a large portion of its new dialect. While, however, the spirit\r\n    of allegory comes from the East, there is so great a difference\r\n    between the brevity of Western expression and the more cumbrous\r\n    diction of the Oriental, that the origin of a phrase becomes\r\n    difficult to trace. Thus, for instance, whilst the Turkish merchant\r\n    might address his friend somewhat as follows—‘That which seems good\r\n    to my father is to his servant as the perfumed breath of the west\r\n    wind in the calm night of the Arabian summer;’ the Western\r\n    negotiator observes more briefly, ‘all serene!’”[53]\r\n\r\nBut the vulgar term, “brick,” _Punch_ remarks in illustration,\r\n\r\n    “must be allowed to be an exception, its Greek derivation being\r\n    universally admitted, corresponding so exactly as it does in its\r\n    rectangular form and compactness to the perfection of manhood,\r\n    according to the views of Plato and Simonides; but any deviation\r\n    from the simple expression, in which locality is indicated—as, for\r\n    instance, ‘a genuine Bath’—decidedly breathes the Oriental spirit.”\r\n\r\nIt is singular that what _Punch_ says unwittingly and in humour\r\nrespecting the Slang expression “bosh,” should be quite true. “Bosh,”\r\nremarks _Punch_, after speaking of it as belonging to the stock of words\r\npilfered from the Turks, “is one whose innate force and beauty the\r\nslangographer is reluctantly compelled to admit. It is the only word\r\nwhich seems a proper appellation for a great deal which we are obliged\r\nto hear and to read every day of our life.” “Bosh,” nonsense or\r\nstupidity, is derived from the Gipsy and the Persian. The universality\r\nof Slang is proved by its continual use in the pages of _Punch_. Who\r\never thinks, unless belonging to a past generation, of asking a friend\r\nto explain the stray vulgar words employed by the _London Charivari_?\r\nSome of the jokes, though, might nowadays be accompanied by explanatory\r\nnotes, in similar style to that adopted by youthful artists who write “a\r\nman,” “a horse,” &c., when rather uncertain as to whether or not their\r\nefforts will meet with due appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe _Athenæum_, the _Saturday Review_, and other kindred “weeklies,”\r\noften indulge in Slang words when force of expression or a little humour\r\nis desired, or when the various writers wish to say something which is\r\nbetter said in Slang, or so-called vulgar speech, than in the authorized\r\nlanguage. Bartlett, the compiler of the _Dictionary of Americanisms_,\r\ncontinually cites the _Athenæum_ as using Slang and vulgar expressions;\r\nbut the magazine the American refers to is not the literary journal of\r\nthe present day,—it was a smaller, and now defunct, “weekly.” The\r\npresent possessor of the classic title is, though, by no means\r\nbehindhand in its devotion to colloquialisms. Many other highly\r\nrespectable journals often use Slang words and phrases. The _Times_ (or,\r\nin Slang, the “Thunderer”) frequently employs unauthorized terms; and,\r\nfollowing a “leader”[54] of the purest and most eloquent composition, may\r\nsometimes be seen another “article”[54] on a totally different subject,\r\ncontaining, perhaps, a score or more of exceedingly questionable words.\r\nAmong the words and phrases which may be included under the head of\r\nLiterary Slang are, “balaam,” matter kept constantly in type about\r\nmonstrous productions of nature, to fill up spaces in newspapers;\r\n“balaam-box,” the term given in _Blackwood_ to the repository for\r\nrejected articles; and “slate,” to pelt with abuse, or “cut up” in a\r\nreview. “He’s the fellow to slate a piece” is often said of dramatic\r\ncritics, especially of those who through youth, inexperience, and the\r\nprocess of unnatural selection which causes them to be critics, imagine\r\nthat to abuse all that is above their comprehension is to properly\r\nexercise the critical faculty. This is, however, dangerous ground. The\r\nSlang names given to newspapers are curious;—thus, the _Morning\r\nAdvertiser_ is known as the “Tap-tub,” the “’Tizer,” and was until\r\nrecently the “Gin and Gospel Gazette.” The _Morning Post_ has obtained\r\nthe suggestive sobriquet of “Jeames;” whilst the _Morning Herald_ was\r\nlong caricatured as “Mrs. Harris,” and the _Standard_ as “Mrs.\r\nGamp.”[55]\r\n\r\nThe _Stage_, of course, has its Slang—“both before and behind the\r\ncurtain,” as a journalist remarks. The stage-manager is familiarly\r\ntermed “daddy;” and an actor by profession, or a “professional,” is\r\ncalled a “pro.” It is amusing at times to hear a young actor—who struts\r\nabout padded with copies of all newspapers that have mentioned his\r\nname—talking, in a mixed company, of the stage as _the_ profession.\r\nThis is after all but natural, for to him “all the world’s a stage.” A\r\nman who is occasionally hired at a trifling remuneration to come upon\r\nthe stage as one of a crowd, or when a number of actors are wanted to\r\ngive effect, is named a “supe,”—an abbreviation of “supernumerary.” A\r\n“surf” is a third-rate actor, who frequently pursues another calling;\r\nand the band, or orchestra between the pit and the stage, is generally\r\nspoken of as the “menagerie.” A “ben” is a benefit; and “sal” is the\r\nSlang abbreviation of “salary.” Should no money be forthcoming on the\r\nSaturday night, it is said that the “ghost doesn’t walk;” or else the\r\nstatement goes abroad that there is “no treasury,” as though the coffers\r\nthemselves had departed. The travelling or provincial theatricals, who\r\nperform in any large room that can be rented in a country village, are\r\ncalled “barn-stormers.” A “length” is forty-two lines of any dramatic\r\ncomposition; and a “run” is the continuous term of a piece’s\r\nperformance. A “saddle” is the additional charge made by a manager to an\r\nactor or actress upon his or her benefit night. To “mug up” is to paint\r\none’s face, or arrange the person, to represent a particular character;\r\nto “corpse,” or to “stick,” is to balk, or put the other actors out in\r\ntheir parts by forgetting yours. A performance is spoken of as either a\r\n“gooser” or a “screamer,” should it be a failure or a great success;—if\r\nthe latter, it is not infrequently termed a “hit.” To “goose” a\r\nperformance is to hiss it; and continued “goosing” generally ends, or\r\ndid end before managers refused to accept the verdict of audiences, in\r\nthe play or the players being “damned.” To “star it” is to perform as\r\nthe centre of attraction, with your name in large type, and none but\r\nsubordinates and indifferent actors in the same performance. The\r\nexpressive term “clap-trap,” high-sounding nonsense, is nothing but an\r\nancient theatrical term, and signified a “trap” to catch a “clap” by way\r\nof applause. “Up amongst the ‘gods,’” refers to being among the\r\nspectators in the gallery,—termed in French Slang “paradis.”\r\n\r\nThere exists, too, in the great territory of vulgar speech what may not\r\ninappropriately be termed Civic Slang. It consists of mercantile and\r\nStock Exchange terms, and the Slang of good living and wealth. A turkey\r\nhung with sausages is facetiously styled an “alderman in chains,”—a\r\nterm which has spread from the City and become general; and a\r\nhalf-crown, perhaps from its rotundity, is often termed an “alderman.” A\r\n“bear” is a speculator on the Exchange; and a “bull,” although of an\r\nopposite order, follows a like profession. There is something very\r\nhumorous and applicable in the Slang term “lame duck,” a defaulter in\r\nstock-jobbing speculations. The allusion to his “waddling out of the\r\nAlley,” as they say, is excellent. “Breaking shins,” in City Slang, is\r\nborrowing money; a rotten or unsound scheme is spoken of as “fishy;”\r\n“rigging the market” means playing tricks with it; and “stag” was a\r\ncommon term during the railway mania for a speculator without capital, a\r\nseller of “scrip” in “Diddlesex Junction” and other equally safe lines.\r\nAt Tattersall’s a “monkey” is 500_l._, and in the City a “plum” is\r\n100,000_l._, and a “marygold” is one million sterling. But before\r\nproceeding further in a sketch of the different kinds of Slang, it may\r\nbe as well to speak here of the extraordinary number of Cant and Slang\r\nterms in use to represent money—from farthings to bank-notes the value\r\nof fortunes. Her Majesty’s coin, collectively or in the piece, is known\r\nby more than one hundred and thirty distinct Slang words, from the\r\nhumble “brown” (a halfpenny) to “flimsies,” or “long-tailed ones”\r\n(bank-notes).\r\n\r\n“Money,” it has been well remarked, “the bare, simple word itself, has a\r\nsonorous, significant ring in its sound,” and might have sufficed, one\r\nwould have imagined, for all ordinary purposes, excepting, of course,\r\nthose demanded by direct reference to specific sums. But a vulgar or\r\n“fast” society has thought differently; and so we have the Slang\r\nsynonyms—“beans,” “blunt” (_i.e._, specie,—not soft or rags,\r\nbank-notes), “brads,” “brass,” “bustle,” “coppers” (copper money, or\r\nmixed pence), “chink,” “chinkers,” “chips,” “corks,” “dibbs,” “dinarly,”\r\n“dimmock,” “dust,” “feathers,” “gent” (silver,—from argent), “haddock”\r\n(a purse of money), “horse nails,” “huckster,” “loaver,” “lour” (the\r\noldest Cant term for money), “mopusses,” “needful,” “nobbings” (money\r\ncollected in a hat by street-performers), “ochre” (gold), “pewter,”\r\n“palm oil,” “pieces,” “posh,” “queen’s pictures,” “quids,” “rags”\r\n(bank-notes), “ready,” or “ready gilt,” “redge” (gold), “rhino,”\r\n“rowdy,” “shiners” (sovereigns), “skin” (a purse of money), “stiff”\r\n(checks, or bills of acceptance), “stuff,” “stumpy,” “tin” (silver),\r\n“wedge” (silver), and “yellow-boys” (sovereigns);—just forty-three\r\nvulgar equivalents for the simple word money. So attentive is Slang\r\nspeech to financial matters, that there are seven terms for bad, or\r\n“bogus,” coin (as our friends the Americans call it): a “case” is a\r\ncounterfeit five-shilling piece; “half a case” represents half that sum;\r\n“grays” are halfpence made specially for unfair gambling purposes;\r\n“queer-soft” is counterfeit or lead coin; “schofel” refers to coated or\r\nspurious coin; “sheen” is bad money of any description; and “sinkers”\r\nbears the same and not inappropriate meaning. “Snide” is now the generic\r\nterm for all bad money, whether coined or in notes; and “snide-pitching”\r\nor “schoful-tossing” is the term in use among the professors of that\r\npursuit for what is more generally known as “smashing.” “Flying the\r\nkite,” or obtaining money on bills and promissory-notes, is closely\r\nconnected with the allegorical expression of “raising the wind,” which\r\nis a well-known phrase for procuring money by immediate sale, pledging,\r\nor by a forced loan. In winter or in summer any elderly gentleman who\r\nmay have prospered in life is pronounced “warm;” whilst an equivalent is\r\nimmediately at hand in the phrase “his pockets are well lined,” or “he\r\nis well breeched.” Each separate piece of money has its own Slang term,\r\nand often half a score of synonyms. To begin with that extremely humble\r\ncoin, a farthing: first we have “fadge,” then “fiddler;” then “gig,” and\r\nlastly “quartereen.” A halfpenny is a “brown” or a “madzer (pronounced\r\n‘medzer’) saltee” (Cant), or a “mag,” or a “posh,” or a “rap,”—whence\r\nthe popular phrase, “I don’t care a rap.” The useful and universal penny\r\nhas for Slang equivalents a “copper,” a “saltee” (Cant), and a “winn.”\r\nTwopence is a “deuce,” and threepence is either “thrums” or “thrups.”\r\n“Thrums” has a special peculiarity; for while “thrums-buskin” represents\r\nthreepence-halfpenny, the term “buskin” is not used in connexion with\r\nany other number of pence. Fourpence, or a groat, may in vulgar speech\r\nbe termed a “bit,” a “flag,” or a “joey.” Sixpence is well represented\r\nin street talk, and some of the slangisms are very comical—for\r\ninstance, “bandy,” “bender,” “cripple,” and “downer;” then we have\r\n“buck,” “fye-b’ck,” “half a hog,” “kick” (thus “two and a ‘kick,’” or\r\n2_s._ 6_d._), “lord of the manor,”[56] “pig,” “pot” (the price of a pot\r\nof ale—thus half-a-crown is a “five ‘pot’ piece”), “snid,” “sprat,”\r\n“sow’s baby,” “tanner,” “tester,” “tizzy,”—seventeen vulgar words to\r\none coin. Sevenpence being an uncommon amount has only one Slang\r\nsynonym, “setter.” The same remark applies to eightpence and ninepence,\r\nthe former being only represented by “otter,” and the latter by the\r\nCant phrase “nobba-saltee.” Tenpence is “dacha-saltee,” and elevenpence\r\n“dacha-one,”—both Cant expressions. It is noticeable that coined\r\npieces, and sums which from their smallness or otherwise are mostly in\r\nuse, receive a commensurate amount of attention from promoters of Slang.\r\nOne shilling boasts eleven Slang equivalents; thus we have “beong,”\r\n“bob,” “breaky-leg,” “deener,” “gen” (from the back Slang), “hog,”\r\n“levy,” “peg,” “stag,” “teviss,” and “twelver.” One shilling and\r\nsixpence is a “kye,” now and then an “eighteener.” It is noticeable that\r\nso far the florin has escaped, and only receives the shilling titles\r\nwith the required numeral adjective prefixed. Half-a-crown is known as\r\nan “alderman,” “half a bull,” “half a wheel,” “half a tusheroon,” and a\r\n“madza (medzer) caroon;” whilst a crown piece, or five shillings, may be\r\ncalled either a “bull,” a “caroon,” a “cartwheel,” or a “coachwheel,”\r\nor, more generally than either, a “wheel” or a “tusheroon.” The word\r\n“dollar” is in general use among costermongers and their customers, and\r\nsignifies exactly five shillings. Any term representing this amount\r\n“takes in two,” and represents the half-crown by the addition of the\r\nusual prefix. The next advance in Slang money is ten shillings, or\r\nhalf-a-sovereign, which may be either pronounced as “half a bean,” “half\r\na couter,” “a madza poona,” “half a quid,” or “half a thick ’un.” A\r\nsovereign, or twenty shillings, is a “bean,” “canary,” “couter,”\r\n“foont,” “goldfinch,” “James” (from Jacobus), “poona,” “portrait,”\r\n“quid,” “thick-un,” or “yellow-boy.” Guineas are nearly obsolete, yet\r\nthe terms “neds” and “half neds” are still in use. Bank-notes are\r\n“flimsies,” “long-tailed ones,” or “soft.” A “fin,” or a “finnuf,” is a\r\nfive-pound note. Twenty-five pounds is a “pony,” and a hundred a\r\n“century.” One hundred pounds (or any other “round sum”), quietly handed\r\nover as payment for services performed, is curiously termed “a ‘cool’\r\nhundred.” Thus ends, with several necessary omissions, this long list of\r\nSlang terms for the coins of the realm which, for copiousness, it is not\r\ntoo much to say, is not equalled by any other vulgar or unauthorized\r\nlanguage in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of many of these Slang names is remarkable. “Winn” was the\r\nvulgar term for a penny in the days of Queen Elizabeth; and “tester,” a\r\nsixpence (formerly a shilling), was the correct name in the days of\r\nHenry VIII. The reader, too, will have remarked the frequency of\r\nanimals’ names as Slang terms for money. Little, as a modern writer has\r\nremarked, do the persons using these phrases know of their remote and\r\nsomewhat classical origin, which may, indeed, be traced to a period\r\nanterior to that when monarchs monopolized the surface of coined money\r\nwith their own images and superscriptions. They are identical with the\r\nvery name of money among the early Romans, which was _pecunia_, from\r\n_pecus_, a flock. The collections of coin-dealers amply show that the\r\nfigure of a “hog” was anciently placed on a small silver coin; and that\r\nthat of a “bull” decorated larger ones of the same metal. These coins\r\nwere frequently deeply crossed on the reverse; this was for the\r\nconvenience of easily breaking them into two or more pieces, should the\r\nbargain for which they were employed require it, and the parties making\r\nit had no smaller change handy to complete the transaction. Thus we find\r\nthat the “half bull” of the itinerant street-seller, or “traveller,” so\r\nfar from being a phrase of modern invention, as is generally supposed,\r\nis in point of fact referable to an era extremely remote. This remark\r\nwill safely apply to most descriptions of money; and it must not be\r\nforgotten that farthing is but a corruption of fourthing, or, literally,\r\nfourth part of a penny. The representative coin of the realm was often\r\nin olden times made to break up,—but this by the way. It is a reminder,\r\nhowever, that the word “smash,” as used by the classes that speak Slang\r\nfrom motives other than those of affectation, has nothing whatever to do\r\nwith base coin, as is generally supposed. It simply means to give\r\nchange. Thus:—“Can you smash a thick ’un for me?” means simply, “Can\r\nyou give me change for a sovereign?” We learn from Erizzo, in his\r\n_Discorso_, a further illustration of the proverb “that there is nothing\r\nnew under the sun;” for he says that the Roman boys at the time of\r\nHadrian tossed up their coppers and cried, “Head or ship;” of which\r\ntradition our “heads or tails,” and “man or woman,” or “a tanner I heads\r\n’em,” is certainly a less refined version. We thence gather, however,\r\nthat the prow of a vessel would appear to have been the more ordinary\r\ndevice of the reverse of the brass coin of that ancient period. There\r\nare many other Cant words directly from a classic source, as will be\r\nseen in the dictionary.\r\n\r\nShopkeepers’ Slang is perhaps the most offensive of all Slang, though\r\nthis is not intended to imply that shopkeepers are perhaps the most\r\noffensive of people. This kind of Slang is not a casual eyesore, as\r\nnewspaper Slang, neither is it an occasional discomfort to the ear, as\r\nin the case of some vulgar byword of the street; but it is a perpetual\r\nnuisance, and stares you in the face on tradesmen’s invoices, on labels\r\nin the shop-windows, and placards on the hoardings, in posters against\r\nthe house next to your own—if it happen to be empty for a few\r\nweeks—and in bills thrust into your hand, as you peaceably walk through\r\nthe streets. Under your door, and down your area, Slang handbills are\r\ndropped by some “pushing” tradesman; and for the thousandth time you are\r\ncalled upon to learn that an “alarming sacrifice” is taking place in the\r\nnext street; that prices are “down again;” that, in consequence of some\r\nother tradesman not “driving a roaring trade,” being in fact, “sold up,”\r\nand for the time being a resident in “Burdon’s Hotel” (Whitecross-Street\r\nPrison), the “pushing” tradesman wishes to sell out at “awfully low\r\nprices,” to “the kind patrons, and numerous customers,” &c. &c., “that\r\nhave on every occasion,” &c. &c. These are, though, very venial\r\noffenders compared with those ghouls, the advertising undertakers, who\r\nemploy boys, loaded with ghastly little books, to follow up the parish\r\ndoctor, and leave their horrible wares wherever he calls. But what can\r\nbe expected of ignorant undertakers when a London newspaper of large\r\ncirculation actually takes out the death records from the _Times_, and\r\nsends a circular to each address therein, informing the bereaved persons\r\nthat the “----” charges so much per line for similar notices, and that\r\nits circulation is most extensive? Surely the typical “death-hunter,”\r\nhardened though he may be, is hardly down to that level. In shopkeeping\r\nSlang any occupation or calling is termed a “line,”—thus, the “building\r\nline.” A tailor usurps to himself a good deal of Slang. Amongst\r\noperatives he is called a “snip,” a “steel-bar driver,” a “cabbage\r\ncontractor,” or a “goose persuader;” by the world, a “ninth part of a\r\nman;” and by the young collegian, or “fast” man, a “sufferer.” If he\r\ntakes army contracts, it is “sank work;” if he is a “slop” tailor, he is\r\na “springer up,” and his garments are “blown together.” Perquisites with\r\nhim are “spiffs,” and remnants of cloth “peaking, or cabbage.” The\r\nper-centage he allows to his assistants (or “counter jumpers”) on the\r\nsale of old-fashioned articles is termed “tinge.” If he pays his workmen\r\nin goods, or gives them tickets upon other tradesmen, with whom he\r\nshares the profit, he is soon known as a “tommy master.” If his business\r\nsucceeds, it “takes;” if neglected, it becomes “shaky,” and “goes to\r\npot;” if he is deceived by a debtor (a by no means unusual\r\ncircumstance), he is “let in,” or, as it is sometimes varied, “taken\r\nin.” It need scarcely be remarked that any credit he may give is termed\r\n“tick.”\r\n\r\nOperatives’ or workmen’s Slang, in quality, is but slightly removed from\r\ntradesmen’s Slang. When belonging to the same shop or factory, they\r\n“graft” there, and are “brother chips.” Among printers the favourite\r\nterm is “comps,”—not compositors, though the same contraction is used\r\nfor that word,—but companions, whether so in actual fact, or as members\r\nof the same “companionship.” A companionship is the number of men\r\nengaged on any one work, and this is in turn reduced to “ship:”\r\nsometimes it is a “’stab ship,” _i.e._, paid by the week, therefore on\r\nthe establishment; sometimes it is “on the piece,” and anyhow it is an\r\nextremely critical organization, so perhaps it would be better to\r\nbroaden the subject. Workmen generally dine at “slap-bang shops,” and\r\nare often paid at “tommy shops.” At the nearest “pub,” or public-house,\r\nthey generally have a “score chalked up” against them, which has to be\r\n“wiped off” regularly on the Saturday night. This is often known as a\r\n“light.” When credit is bad the “light” is said to be out. When out of\r\nwork, they describe themselves as being “out of collar.” They term each\r\nother “flints” and “dungs,” if they are “society” or “non-society” men.\r\nTheir salary is a “screw,” and to be discharged is to “get the sack,”\r\nvaried by the expression “get the bullet,” the connexion of which with\r\ndischarge is obvious, as the small lecturers—those at the Polytechnic\r\nfor instance—say, to the meanest capacity. When they quit work, they\r\n“knock off;” and when out of employ, they ask if any “hands” are, or any\r\nassistance is, wanted. “Fat” is the vulgar synonym for perquisites;\r\n“elbow grease” signifies labour; and “Saint Monday” is the favourite day\r\nof the week. Names of animals figure plentifully in the workman’s\r\nvocabulary; thus we have “goose,” a tailor’s smoothing-iron;\r\n“sheep’s-foot,” an iron hammer; “sow,” a receptacle for molten iron,\r\nwhilst the metal poured from it is termed “pig.” Many of the Slang terms\r\nfor money may have originally come from the workshop, thus—“brads,”\r\nfrom the ironmonger; “chips,” from the carpenter; “dust,” from the\r\ngoldsmith; “feathers,” from the upholsterer; “horse-nails,” from the\r\nfarrier; “haddock,” from the fishmonger; and “tanner and skin” from the\r\nleather-dresser.\r\n\r\nIf society, as has been remarked, is a sham, from the vulgar foundation\r\nof commonalty to the crowning summit of royalty, then do we perceive the\r\njustness of the remark in that most peculiar of peculiarities, the Slang\r\nof makeshifts for oaths, and sham exclamations for passion and temper.\r\nThese apologies for feeling are an addition to our vernacular, and\r\nthough some argue that they are a disgrace, for the reason that no man\r\nshould pretend to swear or curse who does not do so, it is some\r\nsatisfaction to know that they serve the purpose of reducing the stock\r\nof national profanity. “You be blowed,” or “I’ll be blowed if,” &c., is\r\nan exclamation often heard in the streets. “Blazes,” or “like blazes,”\r\ncame probably from the army, unless, indeed, it came from the original\r\nmetaphor, afterwards corrupted, to serve all turns, “to smoke like\r\nblazes.” “Blast,” too, although in general vulgar use, may have had an\r\nengineering or military origin, and the phrase, “I wish I may be shot,\r\nif,” smacks much of powder. “Blow me tight” is a very windy and common\r\nexclamation. The same may be said of “strike me lucky,” “never trust\r\nme,” and “so help me Davy;” the latter being evidently derived from the\r\ntruer old phrase, “I’ll take my Davy on’t”—_i.e._, my affidavit,\r\n“Davy,” and sometimes “Alfred Davy,” being a corruption of that word.\r\n“By Golly,” “Gol darn it,” and “so help”—generally pronounced “selp” or\r\n“swelp”—“me Bob,” are evident shams for profane oaths. “Tarnation” is\r\nbut a softening of damnation; and “od,” whether used in “od drat it,” or\r\n“od’s blood,” is but an apology for the name of the Deity. “Marry,” a\r\nterm of asseveration in common use, was originally, in Popish times, a\r\nmode of swearing by the Virgin Mary;—so also “marrow-bones,” for the\r\nknees. “I’ll bring him down upon his marrow-bones,”—_i.e._, I’ll make\r\nhim bend his knees as he does to the Virgin Mary. The Irish phrase, “Bad\r\nscran to yer!” is equivalent to wishing a person bad food. “I’m\r\nsniggered if you will,” and “I’m jiggered,” are other mild forms of\r\nswearing among men fearful of committing an open profanity, yet slily\r\nnibbling at the sin. Maybe, some day one of these adventurers will meet\r\nwith the object of his desires, and then when fairly “jiggered,”\r\nwhatever it may ultimately turn out to be, it is to be hoped he will\r\nprove a fearful example to all persons with the will, but not the pluck,\r\nto swear fierce oaths. Both “deuce” and “dickens” are vulgar old\r\nsynonyms for the devil; and “zounds” is an abbreviation of “God’s\r\nwounds,”—a very ancient oath.\r\n\r\nIn a casual survey of the territory of Slang, it is curious to observe\r\nhow well represented are the familiar wants and failings of life. First,\r\nthere is money, with one hundred and odd Slang terms and synonyms; then\r\ncomes drink, from small beer to champagne; and next as a very natural\r\nsequence, intoxication, and fuddlement generally, with some half a\r\nhundred vulgar terms, graduating the scale of drunkenness, from a slight\r\ninebriation to the soaky state which leads to the gutter, sometimes to\r\nthe stretcher, the station-house, the fine, and, most terrible of all,\r\nthe “caution.” The Slang synonyms for mild intoxication are certainly\r\nvery choice,—they are “beery,” “bemused,” “boozy,” “bosky,” “buffy,”\r\n“corned,” “foggy,” “fou,” “fresh,” “hazy,” “elevated,” “kisky,” “lushy,”\r\n“moony,” “muggy,” “muzzy,” “on,” “screwed,” “stewed,” “tight,” and\r\n“winey.” A higher or more intense state of beastliness is represented by\r\nthe expressions, “podgy,” “beargered,” “blued,” “cut,” “primed,”\r\n“lumpy,” “ploughed,” “muddled,” “obfuscated,” “swipey,” “three sheets in\r\nthe wind,” and “top-heavy.” But the climax of fuddlement is only\r\nobtained when the “disguised” individual “can’t see a hole in a ladder,”\r\nor when he is all “mops and brooms,” or “off his nut,” or with his\r\n“main-brace well spliced,” or with the “sun in his eyes,” or when he\r\nhas “lapped the gutter,” and got the “gravel rash,” or is on the\r\n“ran-tan,” or on the “ree-raw,” or when “sewed up,” and regularly\r\n“scammered,”—then, and not till then, is he entitled, in vulgar\r\nsociety, to the title of “lushington,” or recommended to “put in the\r\npin,” _i.e._, the linch-pin, to keep his legs steady.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] An outgrowth of this latter peculiarity consisted in anyone with a\r\nhigh or prominent nose being, a few years back, called by the street\r\nboys “Duke.”\r\n\r\n[33] This term, with a singular literal downrightness, which would be\r\nremarkable in any other people than the French, is translated by them as\r\nthe sect of _Trembleurs_.\r\n\r\n[34] Swift alludes to this term in his _Art of Polite Conversation_, p.\r\n14, 1738.\r\n\r\n[35] See _Notes and Queries_, vol. i. p. 185. 1850.\r\n\r\n[36] He afterwards kept a tavern at Wapping, mentioned by Pope in the\r\n_Dunciad_.\r\n\r\n[37] _Sportsman’s Dictionary_, 1825, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[38] This introduction was written in 1859, before the new edition of\r\n_Worcester_, and Nuttall’s recent work, were published.\r\n\r\n[39] Introduction to Bee’s _Sportsman’s Dictionary_, 1825.\r\n\r\n[40] The Gipsies use the word Slang as the Anglican synonym for Romany,\r\nthe Continental (or rather Spanish) term for the Cingari or Gipsy\r\ntongue. Crabb, who wrote the _Gipsies’ Advocate_ in 1831, thus mentions\r\nthe word:—“This language [Gipsy] _called by themselves_ Slang, or\r\nGibberish, invented, as they think, by their forefathers for secret\r\npurposes, is not merely the language of one or a few of these wandering\r\ntribes, which are found in the European nations, but is adopted by the\r\nvast numbers who inhabit the earth.”\r\n\r\n[41] The word Slang assumed various meanings amongst costermongers,\r\nbeggars, and vagabonds of all orders. It was, and is still, used to\r\nexpress “cheating by false weights,” “a raree show,” “retiring by a back\r\ndoor,” “a watch-chain,” their “secret language,” &c.\r\n\r\n[42] North, in his _Examen_, p. 574, says, “I may note that the rabble\r\nfirst changed their title, and were called the “mob” in the assemblies\r\nof this [Green Ribbon] club. It was their beasts of burden, and called\r\nfirst _mobile vulgus_, but fell naturally into the contraction of one\r\nsyllable, and ever since is become proper English.” In the same work, p.\r\n231, the disgraceful origin of SHAM is given.\r\n\r\n[43] I am afraid my predecessor was of a somewhat satirical turn of\r\nmind, or else he had peculiar notions of melody.—ED.\r\n\r\n[44] This latter is, as I take it, an error, as the sign was originally\r\nintended to represent the king’s head and cross guns, and may still be\r\nseen in parts of the country.—ED.\r\n\r\n[45] Savez-vous cela?—[I fancy this is from the Spanish _sabe_. The\r\nword is in great use in the Pacific States of America, and is obtained\r\nthrough constant intercourse with the original settlers.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[46] At page 24 of a curious old Civil War tract, entitled, _The Oxonian\r\nAntippodes_, by I. B., Gent., 1644, the town is called Brummidgham, and\r\nthis was the general rendering in the printed literature of the\r\nseventeenth century.—[This must have been the first known step towards\r\nthe present vulgar style of spelling, for properly the word is\r\nBromwich-ham, which has been corrupted into Brummagem, a term used to\r\nexpress worthless or inferior goods, from the spurious jewellery, plate,\r\n&c., manufactured there expressly for “duffers.”—ED.]\r\n\r\n[47] This was more especially an amusement with medical students,\r\nafter the modern Mohocks had discarded it. The students are now a\r\ncomparatively mild and quiet race, with very little of the style of a\r\ngeneration ago about them.\r\n\r\n[48] _Edinburgh Review_, October, 1853.\r\n\r\n[49] A term derived from the _Record_ newspaper, the exponent of this\r\nsingular section of the Low, or so-called Evangelical Church.\r\n\r\n[50] A preacher is said, in this phraseology, to be “owned” when he\r\nmakes many converts, and his converts are called his “seals.” This is\r\nCant in its most objectionable form.\r\n\r\n[51] “Swaddler” is also a phrase by which the low Irish Roman Catholics\r\ndenominate those of their body who in winter become Protestants, _pro\r\ntem._, for the sake of the blankets, coals, &c., given by proselytizing\r\nProtestants. It is hard to say which are the worse, those who refuse to\r\ngive unless the objects of their charity become converted, or those who\r\nsham conversion to save themselves from starving, or the tender mercies\r\nof the relieving officer. I am much afraid my sympathies are with the\r\n“swaddlers,” who are also called “soupers.”—ED.\r\n\r\n[52] “All our newspapers contain more or less colloquial words; in fact,\r\nthere seems no other way of expressing certain ideas connected with\r\npassing events of every-day life with the requisite force and piquancy.\r\nIn the English newspapers the same thing is observable, and certain of\r\nthem contain more of the class denominated Slang words than our\r\nown.”—_Bartlett’s Americanisms_, p. 10, edit. 1859.\r\n\r\n[53] When this appeared, “all serene” was one of those street phrases\r\nwhich periodically spring up, have their rage, and depart as suddenly as\r\nthey come into popularity. These sayings are generally of a most idiotic\r\nnature, as their latest specimens, “I’ll warm yer,” “All serene,” and\r\n“I’ll ’ave your hi”—used without any premonitory notice or regard to\r\ncontext, and screeched out at the top of the voice—will testify. I\r\nsuppose we shall soon have another of these “ebullitions of popular\r\nfeeling.”—ED.\r\n\r\n[54] The terms “leader” and “article” can scarcely be called Slang, yet\r\nit would be desirable to know upon what authority they were first\r\nemployed in their present peculiar sense.\r\n\r\n[55] The _Morning Herald_ was called “Mrs. Harris,” because it was said\r\nthat no one ever saw it, a peculiarity which, in common with its general\r\ndisregard for veracity, made it uncommonly like “Mrs. Gamp’s” invisible\r\nfriend as portrayed by Dickens. But the _Herald_ has long since departed\r\nthis life, and with it has gone the title of “Mrs. Gamp,” as applied to\r\nthe _Standard_, which is, though, as impulsive and Conservative as\r\never.—ED.\r\n\r\n[56] This is rhyming slang, and is corrupted into “lord” only.\r\n“Touch-me,” a common term for a shilling, is also derived from the same\r\nsource, it being short for “touch-me-on-the-nob,” which is rhyming slang\r\nfor “bob” or shilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nSLANG DICTIONARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n~A 1~, first-rate, the very best; “she’s a prime girl, she is; she is\r\nA 1.”—_Sam Slick_. The highest classification of ships at Lloyd’s; common\r\nterm in the United States; also at Liverpool and other English seaports.\r\nAnother, even more intensitive form is “first-class, letter A, No. 1.”\r\nSome people choose to say A I, for no reason, however, beyond that of\r\nbeing different from others.\r\n\r\n~Abigail~, a lady’s-maid; perhaps obtained from old comedies. Used in an\r\nuncomplimentary sense. Some think the term is derived from Abigail Hill\r\n(Mrs. Masham), lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne, and a typical ABIGAIL in\r\nthe way of intrigue.\r\n\r\n~About Right~, “to do the thing ABOUT RIGHT,” _i.e._, to do it\r\nproperly, soundly, correctly; “he guv it ’im ABOUT RIGHT,” _i.e._, he\r\nbeat him severely.\r\n\r\n~Abraham-man~, a vagabond, such as were driven to beg about the country\r\nafter the dissolution of the monasteries.—_See_ BESS O’ BEDLAM,\r\n_infra_. They are well described under the title of _Bedlam\r\nBeggars_.—_Shakspeare’s K. Lear_, ii. 3.\r\n\r\n    “And these, what name or title e’er they bear,\r\n    Jarkman, or Patrico, Cranke, or Clapper-dudgeon,\r\n    Frater, or ABRAM-MAN; I speak to all\r\n    That stand in fair election for the title\r\n    Of king of beggars.”—_Beaumont and Fletcher’s Begg. Bush._ II. 1.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been the practice in former days to allow certain\r\ninmates of Bethlehem Hospital to have fixed days “to go begging:” hence\r\nimpostors were said to “SHAM ABRAHAM” (the Abraham Ward in Bedlam having\r\nfor its inmates these mendicant lunatics) when they pretended they were\r\nlicensed beggars in behalf of the hospital.\r\n\r\n~Abraham-sham~, or SHAM ABRAHAM, to feign sickness or distress. From\r\nABRAHAM-MAN, the _ancient Cant_ term for a begging impostor, or one who\r\npretended to have been mad.—_Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy_, vol. i.\r\np. 360. When Abraham Newland was Cashier to the Bank of England, and\r\nsigned their notes, it was sung:—\r\n\r\n        “I have heard people say\r\n        That SHAM ABRAHAM you may,\r\n    But you mustn’t SHAM ABRAHAM Newland.”\r\n\r\n~Absquatulate~, to run away, or abscond; a hybrid _American_ expression,\r\nfrom the Latin _ab_, and “squat” to settle.\r\n\r\n~Acres~, a coward. From Bob Acres, in Sheridan’s _Rivals_.\r\n\r\n~Adam’s Ale~, water.—_English._ The _Scotch_ term is ADAM’S WINE.\r\n\r\n~Added to the List~, a euphuism current among sporting writers implying\r\nthat a horse has been gelded. As, “Sabinus has been ADDED TO THE LIST.”\r\nAnother form of expression in reference to this matter is that “the\r\nknife has been brought into requisition.” “ADDED TO THE LIST” is simply\r\na contraction for “added to the list of geldings in training.”\r\n\r\n~Addlepate~, a foolish fellow, a dullard.\r\n\r\n~Admiral of the Red~, a person whose very red face evinces a fondness\r\nfor strong potations.\r\n\r\n~Affygraphy.~ “It fits to an AFFYGRAPHY,” _i.e._, to a nicety—to a _T_.\r\n\r\n~Afternoon Farmer~, one who wastes his best opportunity, and drives off\r\nthe large end of his work to the little end of his time.\r\n\r\n~Against the Grain~, in opposition to the wish. “It went AGAINST THE\r\nGRAIN to do it, but I knew I must,” is a common expression.\r\n\r\n~Aggerawators~ (corruption of _Aggravators_), the greasy locks of hair\r\nin vogue among costermongers and other street folk, worn twisted from\r\nthe temple back towards the ear. They are also, from a supposed\r\nresemblance in form, termed NEWGATE KNOCKERS, and sometimes NUMBER\r\nSIXES. This style of adorning the head is, however, fast dying out, and\r\nthe everyday costermonger or street thief has his hair cut like any one\r\nelse. The yearly militia drill may have had a good deal to do with this\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n~Akeybo~, a slang phrase used in the following manner:—“He beats\r\nAKEYBO, and AKEYBO beat the devil.”\r\n\r\n~Albertopolis~, a facetious appellation given by the Londoners to the\r\nKensington Gore district. Now obsolete.\r\n\r\n~Alderman~, a half-crown—possibly from its rotundity. Also a long pipe.\r\n\r\n~Alderman~, a turkey; “ALDERMAN IN CHAINS,” a turkey hung with sausages.\r\n\r\n~All of a Hugh!~ all on one side; falling with a thump; the word HUGH\r\nbeing pronounced with a grunt.—_Suffolk._\r\n\r\n~All my Eye~, a remark of incredulity made in reference to an improbable\r\nstory; condensation of “ALL MY EYE AND BETTY MARTIN,” a vulgar phrase\r\nconstructed from the commencement of a Roman Catholic prayer to St.\r\nMartin, “Oh, mihi, beate Martine,” which in common with many another\r\nfell into discredit and ridicule after the Reformation.\r\n\r\n~All out~, by far;—“he was ALL OUT the best of the lot.”\r\n_Old_—frequently used by Burton in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_.\r\n\r\n~All-overish~, neither sick nor well; the premonitory symptoms of\r\nillness. Also the feeling which comes over a man at a critical moment,\r\nsay just when he is about to “pop the question.” Sometimes this is\r\ncalled, “feeling all over alike, and touching nowhere.”\r\n\r\n~All-rounder~, a shirt collar going all round the neck and meeting in\r\nfront. Once fashionable, but little worn now.\r\n\r\n~All Serene~, an ejaculation of acquiescence. Some years back a popular\r\nstreet cry. With or without application to actual fact, the words ALL\r\nSERENE were bawled from morning to night without any reference to the\r\nserenity of the unfortunate hearers.—_See_ SERENE.\r\n\r\n~Alls~, tap-droppings, refuse spirits sold at a cheap rate in\r\ngin-palaces.\r\n\r\n~All There~, in strict fashion, first-rate, “up to the mark;” a vulgar\r\nperson would speak of a handsome, well-dressed woman as being ALL THERE.\r\nAn artisan would use the same phrase to express the capabilities of a\r\nskillful fellow-workman. Sometimes ALL THE WAY THERE. Always used as a\r\nterm of encomium.\r\n\r\n~All to Pieces~, utterly, excessively; “he beat him ALL TO PIECES,”\r\n_i.e._, excelled or surpassed him exceedingly. Also a term much in use\r\namong sporting men and expressing want of form, or decadence. A boat’s\r\ncrew are said to “go ALL TO PIECES” when they through distress lose\r\ntheir regularity. A woman is vulgarly said to “fall to pieces,” or\r\n“tumble to pieces,” when she is confined.\r\n\r\n~All to Smash~, or “GONE ALL TO PIECES,” bankrupt, ruined.\r\n\r\n~Almighty Dollar~, an _American_ expression representing the manner in\r\nwhich money is worshipped. Modernly introduced by Washington Irving in\r\n1837. The _idea_ of this phrase is, however, far older than the time of\r\n_Irving_. _Ben Jonson’s Epistle to Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland_,\r\ncommences thus—\r\n\r\n    “Whilst that for which all virtue now is sold,\r\n    And almost every vice, _almightie gold_.”\r\n\r\nIt seems almost obvious that the term must have been applied, not to\r\ndollars certainly, but to money, long before the time of Irving.\r\n\r\n~American Tweezers~, an instrument used by an hotel-sneak which nips the\r\nwards end of a key, and enables him to open a door from the opposite\r\nside to that on which it has been locked.\r\n\r\n~Andrew Millar~, a ship of war.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Ain’t~, the vulgar abbreviation of “am not,” “are not,” or “is not.”\r\n\r\n~Anointed~, _i.e._, eminent; used to express great rascality in any one;\r\n“an ANOINTED scoundrel,” king among scoundrels.—_Irish._\r\n\r\n~Anointing~, a good beating. A case for the application of salve.\r\n\r\n~Anonyma~, a lady of the _demi-monde_, or worse; a “pretty\r\nhorsebreaker.” INCOGNITA was the term at first. Product of the\r\nsqueamishness of the age which tries to thrust away fact by the use of\r\nfine words.\r\n\r\n~Antiscriptural~, oaths, foul language. Anything unfit for ordinary\r\nsociety conversation.\r\n\r\n~Apartments to Let~, a term used in reference to one who has a somewhat\r\nempty head. As, “He’s got APARTMENTS TO LET.”\r\n\r\n~Apostle’s Grove~, the London district known as St. John’s Wood. Also\r\ncalled GROVE OF THE EVANGELIST.\r\n\r\n~Apostles~, THE TWELVE, the last twelve names on the Poll, or “Ordinary\r\nDegree” List at the Cambridge Examinations, when it was arranged in\r\norder of merit, and not alphabetically, and in classes, as at present;\r\nso called from their being _post alios_, after the others.—_See_ POLL.\r\nThe last of all was called ST. PAUL (or Saint Poll), as being the least\r\nof the apostles, and “not meet to be called an apostle” (_see_ 1 Cor.\r\nxv. 9). As in the “Honour” list (_see_ GULF), students who had failed\r\nonly slightly in one or more subjects were occasionally allowed their\r\ndegrees, and these were termed ELEGANT EXTRACTS.—_Camb. Univ. Slang._\r\n\r\n~Apple-pie Bed~, a trick played at schools on new comers, or on any boy\r\ndisliked by the rest. One of the sheets is removed, and the other is\r\ndoubled in the middle, so that both edges are brought to the top, and\r\nlook as if both sheets were there; but the unhappy occupant is prevented\r\ngetting more than half-way down, and he has to remake his bed as best he\r\ncan. This trick is sometimes played by children of a larger growth.\r\n\r\n~Apple-Cart~, the human structure, so far as the phrases with which it\r\nis connected are concerned. As “I’ll upset your APPLE-CART,” “down with\r\nhis APPLE-CART.”\r\n\r\n~Apple-pie Order~, in exact or very nice order.\r\n\r\n~Appro~, contraction of approbation, a word much in use among jewellers.\r\nMost of the extensive show of chains, watches, and trinkets in a shop\r\nwindow is obtained “ON APPRO,” _i.e._, “on sale or return.”\r\n\r\n~Area Sneak~, a thief who commits depredations upon kitchens and\r\ncellars.\r\n\r\n~Argol-bargol~, to bandy words.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Article~, derisive term for a weak or insignificant specimen of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n~Atomy~, a diminutive or deformed person. From ANATOMY, or ATOM.\r\n\r\n~Attack~, to carve, or commence operations; “ATTACK that beef, and\r\noblige!”\r\n\r\n~Attic~, the head; “queer in the ATTIC,” intoxicated or weak-minded.\r\nSometimes ATTIC is varied by “upper story.”\r\n\r\n~Attic Salt~, wit, humour, pleasantry. Partly a reference to a\r\nsuggestive portion of Grecian literature, and partly a sly hit at the\r\nwell-known poverty of many writers.\r\n\r\n~Auctioneer~, to “tip him the AUCTIONEER,” is to knock a man down. Tom\r\nSayers’s right hand was known to pugilistic fame as the AUCTIONEER.\r\n\r\n~Audit Ale~, extra strong ale supposed to be drunk when the accounts are\r\naudited.—_Camb. Univ._\r\n\r\n~Auld-Reekie~, an affectionate term for the old town of Edinburgh.\r\nDerived from its dingy appearance.\r\n\r\n~Aunt Sally~, a favourite figure on racecourses and at fairs, consisting\r\nof a wooden head mounted on a stick, firmly fixed in the ground; in the\r\nnose of which, or rather where the nose should be, a tobacco-pipe is\r\ninserted. The fun consists in standing at a distance and demolishing\r\nAUNT SALLY’S pipe-clay projection with short bludgeons, very similar to\r\nthe halves of broom-handles. The Duke of Beaufort is a “crack hand” at\r\nsmashing pipe noses; and his performances some years ago on Brighton\r\nracecourse, which brought the game into notoriety, are yet fresh in\r\nremembrance. AUNT SALLY has, however, had her day, and once again the\r\ninevitable “three shies a penny!” is chief among our outdoor amusements.\r\n\r\n~Avast~, a sailor’s phrase for stop, shut up, go away,—apparently\r\nconnected with the _old Cant_, BYNGE A WASTE; or from the _Italian_,\r\nBASTA, hold! enough.\r\n\r\n~Awake~, or FLY, knowing, thoroughly understanding. “I’m awake,” _i.e._,\r\nI know all. The phrase WIDE-AWAKE carries a similar meaning in ordinary\r\nconversation, but has a more general reference.\r\n\r\n~Awful~, a senseless expletive, used to intensify a description of\r\nanything good or bad; “what an AWFUL fine woman!” “awfully jolly,”\r\n“awfully sorry,” &c. The phrase is not confined to any section of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n~Ax~, to ask. Sometimes pronounced arks.\r\n\r\n~Babes~, the lowest order of KNOCK-OUTS (which _see_), who are prevailed\r\nupon not to give opposing biddings at auctions, in consideration of\r\ntheir receiving a small sum (from one shilling to half-a-crown), and a\r\ncertain quantity of beer. They can, however, even after this agreement,\r\nbe secured on the other side for a little longer price. There is no\r\nhonour among thieves—at all events not among auction thieves—nowadays.\r\n\r\n~Back~, to support by means of money, on the turf or otherwise.—_See_\r\nLAY.\r\n\r\n~Back~, “to get one’s BACK UP,” to annoy or enrage. Probably from the\r\naction of a cat when preparing to give battle to an enemy.\r\n\r\n~Back-end~, that portion of the year which commences with October. This\r\nphrase is peculiar to the turf, and has its origin in the fact that\r\nOctober was actually, and is now nearly, the finishing portion of the\r\nracing season. Towards BACK-END the punters and “little men” generally\r\nbegin to look forward with anxiety to their winter prospects, and “going\r\nfor the gloves” is not only a frequent phrase, but a frequently\r\nrecurring practice.\r\n\r\n~Back Out~, to retreat from a difficulty; reverse of GO AHEAD. Metaphor\r\nborrowed from the stables.\r\n\r\n~Back Slang It~, to go out the back way. Equivalent to “Sling your hook\r\nout of the back-door,” _i.e._, get away quickly.\r\n\r\n~Backslums~, the byeways and disreputable portions of a town.\r\n\r\n~Back-Hander~, a blow on the face with the back of the hand, a\r\nback-handed tip. Also a drink out of turn, as when a greedy person\r\ndelays the decanter to get a second glass. Anything done slyly or\r\nsecretly is said to be done in a back-handed manner.\r\n\r\n~Backer~, one who places his money on a particular man or animal; a\r\nsupporter of one side in a contest. The great body of betting men is\r\ndivided into BOOKMAKERS and BACKERS.\r\n\r\n~Back Jump~, a back window.—_Prison term._\r\n\r\n~Bacon~, the body, “to save one’s BACON,” to escape.\r\n\r\n~Bad~, “to go to the bad,” to deteriorate in character, to be ruined.\r\n_Virgil_ has an almost similar phrase, _in pejus ruere_, which means, by\r\nthe way, to go to the worse.\r\n\r\n~Bad~, hard, difficult. Word in use among sporting men who say, “He will\r\nbe BAD to beat,” when they mean that the man or horse to whom they refer\r\nwill about win.\r\n\r\n~Bad Egg~, a scoundrel or rascal.\r\n\r\n~Badger~, to tease, to annoy by “chaffing.” Suggestive of drawing a\r\nbadger.\r\n\r\n~Bad Lot~, a term derived from auctioneering slang, and now generally\r\nused to describe a man or woman of indifferent morals.\r\n\r\n~Badminton~, blood,—properly a peculiar kind of claret-cup invented at\r\nthe Duke of Beaufort’s seat of that name. BADMINTON proper is made of\r\nclaret, sugar, spice, cucumber peel, and ice, and was sometimes used by\r\nthe patrons of the Prize Ring as a synonym for blood.\r\n\r\n~Bad Words~, words not always bad of themselves but unpleasant to “ears\r\npolite,” from their vulgar associations.\r\n\r\n~Baffaty~, calico. Term used in the drapery trade.\r\n\r\n~Bag~, to seize or steal, equivalent to “collar.”\r\n\r\n~Bagman~, a commercial traveller. This word is used more in reference to\r\nthe old style of commercial travellers than to the present.\r\n\r\n~Bags~, trousers. Trousers of an extensive pattern, or exaggerated\r\nfashion, have sometimes been termed HOWLING-BAGS, but only when the\r\nstyle has been very “loud.” The word is probably an abbreviation of\r\nbumbags. “To have the BAGS off,” to be of age and one’s own master, to\r\nhave plenty of money. BAGS OF MYSTERY is another phrase in frequent use,\r\nand refers to sausages and saveloys. BAG OF TRICKS, refers to the whole\r\nof a means towards a result. “That’s the whole bag of tricks.”\r\n\r\n~Baked~, seasoned, “he’s only HALF-BAKED,” _i.e._, soft, inexperienced.\r\n\r\n~Baker’s Dozen~, thirteen. Originally the London bakers supplied the\r\nretailers, _i.e._, chandlers’ shopkeepers and itinerants, with thirteen\r\nloaves to the dozen, so as to make up what is known as the overweight,\r\nthe surplus number, called the _inbread_, being thrown in for fear of\r\nincurring a penalty for short weight. To “give a man a BAKER’S DOZEN,”\r\nin a slang sense, sometimes means to give him an extra good beating or\r\npummelling.\r\n\r\n~Balaam~, printers’ slang for matter kept in type about monstrous\r\nproductions of nature, &c., to fill up spaces in newspapers that would\r\notherwise be vacant. The term BALAAM-BOX has often been used as the name\r\nof a depository for rejected articles. Evidently from Scripture, and\r\nreferring to the “speech of an ass.”\r\n\r\n~Bald-Faced Stag~, a term of derision applied to a person with a bald\r\nhead. Also, still more coarsely, “BLADDER-OF-LARD.”\r\n\r\n~Bale up~, an Australian term equivalent to our “Shell out.” A demand\r\nfor instantaneous payment.\r\n\r\n~Ballambangjang.~ The Straits of BALLAMBANGJANG, though unnoticed by\r\ngeographers, are frequently mentioned in sailors’ yarns as being so\r\nnarrow, and the rocks on each side so crowded with trees inhabited by\r\nmonkeys, that the ship’s yards cannot be squared, on account of the\r\nmonkey’s tails getting jammed into, and choking up, the brace\r\nblocks.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Ballast~, money. A rich man is said to be well-ballasted. If not proud\r\nand over-bearing he is said to carry his ballast well.\r\n\r\n~Balmy~, weak-minded or idiotic (not insane).\r\n\r\n~Balmy~, sleep; “have a dose of the BALMY.”\r\n\r\n~Bamboozle~, to deceive, make fun of, or cheat a person; abbreviated to\r\nBAM, which is sometimes used also as a substantive—a deception, a sham,\r\na “sell.” _Swift_ says BAMBOOZLE was invented by a nobleman in the reign\r\nof Charles II.; but this is very likely an error. The probability is\r\nthat a nobleman then first _used_ it in polite society. The term is\r\nderived from the _Gipsies_.\r\n\r\n~Bandannah~, originally a peculiar kind of silk pocket-handkerchief, now\r\nslang used to denote all sorts of “stooks,” “wipes,” and “fogles,” and\r\nin fact the generic term for a kerchief, whether neck or pocket.\r\n\r\n~Banded~, hungry. From the habit hungry folks have of tying themselves\r\ntight round the middle.\r\n\r\n~Bandy~, or CRIPPLE, a sixpence, so called from this coin being\r\ngenerally bent or crooked; old term for flimsy or bad cloth, temp. Q.\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n~Bang~, to excel or surpass; BANGING, great or thumping.\r\n\r\n~Bang-up~, first-rate, in the best possible style.\r\n\r\n~Bank~, to put in a place of safety. “BANK the rag,” _i.e._, secure the\r\nnote. Also “to bank” is to go shares.\r\n\r\n~Bank~, the total amount possessed by any one, “How’s the BANK?” “Not\r\nvery strong; about one and a buck.”\r\n\r\n~Bantling~, a child; stated in _Bacchus and Venus_, 1737, and by\r\n_Grose_, to be a cant term. This is hardly slang now-a-days, and modern\r\netymologists give its origin as that of bands or swaddling clothes.\r\n\r\n~Banyan-Day~, a day on which no meat is served out for rations; probably\r\nderived from the BANIANS, a Hindoo caste, who abstain from animal food.\r\nQuite as probably from the sanitary arrangements which have in hot\r\nclimates counselled the eating of BANYANS and other fruits in preference\r\nto meat on certain days.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Bar~, or BARRING, excepting; in common use in the betting-ring; “Two to\r\none bar one,” _i.e._, two to one against any horse with the exception of\r\none. The Irish use of BARRIN’ is very similar, and the words BAR and\r\nBARRING may now be regarded as general.\r\n\r\n~Barber’s Cat~, a half-starved sickly-looking person. Term used in\r\nconnexion with an expression too coarse to print.\r\n\r\n~Barber’s Clerk~, an overdressed shopboy who apes the manners of, and\r\ntries to pass himself off as, a gentleman; a term of reproach applied\r\nnot to an artisan but to one of those who, being below, assume airs of\r\nsuperiority over, handicraftsmen.\r\n\r\n~Barge~, a term used among printers (compositors) to denote a case in\r\nwhich there is an undue proportion of some letters and a corresponding\r\nshortness of those which are most valuable.\r\n\r\n~Bark~, an Irish person of either sex. From this term, much in use among\r\nthe London lower orders, but for which no etymology can be found,\r\nIreland is now and then playfully called Barkshire.\r\n\r\n~Barker~, a man employed to cry at the doors of “gaffs,” shows, and\r\npuffing shops, to entice people inside. Among touting photographers he\r\nis called a doorsman.\r\n\r\n~Barking-Iron~, or BARKER, a pistol. Term used by footpads and thieves\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n~Barnacles~, spectacles; possibly a corruption of binoculi; but derived\r\nby some from the barnacle (_Lepas Anatifera_), a kind of conical shell\r\nadhering to ships’ bottoms. Hence a marine term for goggles, which they\r\nresemble in shape, and for which they are used by sailors in case of\r\nophthalmic derangement.\r\n\r\n~Barney~, an unfair race of any kind: a sell or cross. Also a lark,\r\njollification, or outing. The word BARNEY is sometimes applied to a\r\nswindle unconnected with the sporting world.\r\n\r\n~Barn Stormers~, theatrical performers who travel the country and act in\r\nbarns, selecting short and tragic pieces to suit the rustic taste.\r\n\r\n~Barrikin~, jargon, speech, or discourse; “We can’t tumble to that\r\nBARRIKIN,” _i.e._, we don’t understand what he says. “Cheese your\r\nBARRIKIN,” shut up. _Miege_ calls it “a sort of stuff;” _Old French_,\r\nBARACAN.\r\n\r\n~Bash~, to beat, thrash; “BASHING a dona,” beating a woman; originally a\r\nprovincial word, applied to the practice of beating walnut trees, when\r\nin bud, with long poles, to increase their productiveness. Hence the\r\nWest country proverb—\r\n\r\n    “A woman, a whelp, and a walnut tree,\r\n    The more you BASH ’em, the better they be.”\r\n\r\nThe word BASH, among thieves, signifies to flog with the cat or birch.\r\nThe worst that can happen to a brutal ruffian is to receive “a BASHING\r\nin, and a BASHING out,”—a flogging at the commencement and another at\r\nthe close of his term of enforced virtue.\r\n\r\n~Baste~, to beat, properly to pour gravy on roasting meat to keep it\r\nfrom burning, and add to its flavour. Also a sewing term.\r\n\r\n~Bastile~, the workhouse. General name for “the Union” amongst the lower\r\norders of the _North_. Formerly used to denote a prison, or “lock-up;”\r\nbut its abbreviated form, STEEL, is now the favourite expression with\r\nthe dangerous classes, some of whom have never heard of BASTILE,\r\nfamiliar as they are with “steel.”\r\n\r\n~Bat~, “on his own BAT,” on his own account. Evident modification of the\r\ncricket term, “off his own bat,” though not connected therewith.—_See_\r\nHOOK.\r\n\r\n~Bat~, to take an innings at cricket. To “carry out one’s BAT” is to be\r\nlast in, _i.e._, to be “not out.” A man’s individual score is said to be\r\nmade “off his own BAT.”\r\n\r\n~Bat~, pace at walking or running. As, “He went off at a good BAT.”\r\n\r\n~Bats~, a pair of bad boots.\r\n\r\n~Battells~, the weekly bills at Oxford. Probably originally wooden\r\ntallies, and so a diminutive of bâton.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Batter~, wear and tear; “can’t stand the BATTER,” _i.e._, not equal to\r\nthe task; “on the BATTER,” “on the streets,” “on the town,” or given up\r\nto roystering and debauchery.\r\n\r\n~Batty~, wages, perquisites. Derived from BATTA, an extra pay given to\r\nsoldiers while serving in _India_.\r\n\r\n~Batty-Fang~, to beat; BATTY-FANGING, a beating; also BATTER-FANG. Used\r\nmetaphorically as early as 1630.\r\n\r\n    “So _batter-fanged_ and belabour’d with tongue mettle, that he was\r\n    weary of his life.”—_Taylor’s Works._\r\n\r\n~Beach-Comber~, a fellow who prowls about the sea-shore to plunder\r\nwrecks, and pick up waifs and strays of any kind.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Beak~, originally a magistrate, judge, or policeman; now a magistrate\r\nonly; “to baffle the BEAK,” to get remanded. _Ancient Cant_, BECK.\r\n_Saxon_, BEAG, a necklace or gold collar—emblem of authority. Sir John\r\nFielding was called the BLIND-BEAK in the last century. Maybe connected\r\nwith the Italian BECCO, which means a (bird’s) _beak_, and also a\r\n_blockhead_.—_See_ WALKER.\r\n\r\n~Beaker-Hunter~, or BEAK-HUNTER, a stealer of poultry.\r\n\r\n~Beans~, money; “a haddock of BEANS,” a purse of money; formerly, BEAN\r\nmeant a guinea; _French_, BIENS, property.\r\n\r\n~Bear~, one who contracts to deliver or sell a certain quantity of stock\r\nin the public funds on a forthcoming day at a stated place, but who does\r\nnot possess it, trusting to a decline in public securities to enable him\r\nto fulfil the agreement and realize a profit.—_See_ BULL. Both words\r\nare slang terms on the Stock Exchange, and are frequently used in the\r\nbusiness columns of newspapers.\r\n\r\n    “He who sells that of which he is not possessed is proverbially said\r\n    to sell the skin before he has caught the BEAR. It was the practice\r\n    of stock-jobbers, in the year 1720, to enter into a contract for\r\n    transferring South Sea stock at a future time for a certain price;\r\n    but he who contracted to sell had frequently no stock to transfer,\r\n    nor did he who bought intend to receive any in consequence of his\r\n    bargain; the seller was, therefore, called a BEAR, in allusion to\r\n    the proverb, and the buyer a BULL, perhaps only as a similar\r\n    distinction. The contract was merely a wager, to be determined by\r\n    the rise or fall of stock; if it rose, the seller paid the\r\n    difference to the buyer, proportioned to the sum determined by the\r\n    same computation to the seller.”—_Dr. Warton on Pope._\r\n\r\nThese arrangements are nowadays called “time bargains,” and are as\r\nfairly (or unfairly) gambling as any transactions at the Victoria Club\r\nor Tattersall’s, or any of the doings which call for the intervention of\r\nthe police and the protestations of pompous City magistrates, who,\r\nduring their terms of office, try to be virtuous and make their names\r\nimmortal. Certainly BULLING and BEARING are as productive of bankruptcy\r\nand misery as are BACKING and LAYING.\r\n\r\n~Be-argered~, drunk. (The word is divided here simply to convey the\r\npronunciation.)\r\n\r\n~Bear-Leader~, a tutor in a private family. In the old days of the\r\n“grand tour” the term was much more in use and of course more\r\nsignificant than it is now.\r\n\r\n~Bear-up~ and ~Bearer-up~.—_See_ BONNET.\r\n\r\n~Beat~, the allotted range traversed by a policeman on duty.\r\n\r\n~Beat~, or BEAT-HOLLOW, to surpass or excel; also “BEAT into fits,” and\r\n“BEAT badly.”\r\n\r\n~Beat~, “DEAD-BEAT,” wholly worn out, done up.\r\n\r\n~Beater-Cases~, boots. _Nearly obsolete._ TROTTER CASES is the term\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\n~Beaver~, old street term for a hat; GOSS is the modern word, BEAVER,\r\nexcept in the country, having fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\n~Bebee~, a lady.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Be-Blowed~, a derisive instruction never carried into effect, as, “You\r\nBE-BLOWED.” Used similarly to the old “Go to.” _See_ BLOW ME.\r\n\r\n~Bed-Fagot~, a contemptuous term for a woman; generally applied to a\r\nprostitute.—_See_ FAGOT.\r\n\r\n~Bed-Post~, “in the twinkling of a BED-POST,” in a moment, or very\r\nquickly. Originally BED-STAFF, a stick placed vertically in the frame of\r\na bed to keep the bedding in its place, and used sometimes as a\r\ndefensive weapon.\r\n\r\n~Bee~, “to have a BEE in one’s bonnet,” _i.e._, to be not exactly sane;\r\nto have a craze in one particular direction. Several otherwise sensible\r\nand excellent M.P.’s are distinguished by the “BEE in his bonnet” each\r\ncarries.\r\n\r\n~Beef-Headed~, stupid, fat-headed, dull.\r\n\r\n~Beefy~, unduly thick or fat, commonly said of women’s ankles; also\r\nrich, juicy, plenteous. To take the whole pool at loo, or to have any\r\nparticular run of luck at cards generally is said by players to be “very\r\nBEEFY.”\r\n\r\n~Beeline~, the straightest possible line of route to a given point. When\r\na bee is well laden, it makes a straight flight for home. Originally an\r\nAmericanism, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Beery~, intoxicated, or fuddled with beer.\r\n\r\n~Beeswax~, poor, soft cheese. Sometimes called “sweaty-toe cheese.”\r\n\r\n~Beeswing~, the film which forms on the sides of bottles which contain\r\ngood old port wine. This breaks up into small pieces in the process of\r\ndecanting, and looks like BEES’ WINGS. Hence the term.\r\n\r\n~Beetle-Crusher~, or SQUASHER, a large flat foot. The expression was\r\nmade popular by being once used by Leech.\r\n\r\n~Beetle-Sticker~, an entomologist.\r\n\r\n~Beggars’ Velvet~, downy particles which accumulate under furniture from\r\nthe negligence of housemaids. Otherwise called SLUTS’-WOOL.\r\n\r\n~Belcher~, a blue bird’s-eye handkerchief.—_See_ BILLY.\r\n\r\n~Bell~, a song. Tramps’ term. Simply diminutive of BELLOW.\r\n\r\n~Bellows~, the lungs. BELLOWSER, a blow in the “wind,” or pit of the\r\nstomach, taking one’s breath away.\r\n\r\n~Bellowsed~, or LAGGED, transported.\r\n\r\n~Bellows to Mend~, a person out of breath; especially a pugilist is said\r\nto be “BELLOWS TO MEND” when winded. With the P.R., the word has fallen\r\ninto desuetude.\r\n\r\n~Belly-Timber~, food, or “grub.”\r\n\r\n~Belly-Vengeance~, small sour beer, apt to cause gastralgia.\r\n\r\n~Bemuse~, to fuddle one’s self with drink, “BEMUSING himself with beer,”\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n~Ben~, a benefit.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Ben Cull~, a friend, or “pal.” Expression used by thieves.\r\n\r\n~Bend~, “that’s above my bend,” _i.e._, beyond my power, too expensive or\r\ntoo difficult for me to perform.\r\n\r\n~Bender~, a sixpence. Probably from its liability to bend. In the days\r\nwhen the term was most in use sixpences were not kept in the excellent\r\nstate of preservation peculiar to the currency of the present day.\r\n\r\n~Bender~, the arm; “over the BENDER,” synonymous with “over the\r\nleft.”—_See_ OVER.\r\n\r\n~Bendigo~, a rough fur cap worn in the midland counties, called after a\r\nnoted pugilist of that name. “Hard Punchers” are caps worn by London\r\nroughs and formerly by men in training. They are a modification of the\r\ncommon Scotch cap, and have peaks.\r\n\r\n~Bene~, good.—_Ancient Cant_; BENAR was the comparative.—_See_ BONE.\r\n_Latin._\r\n\r\n~Benedick~, a married man. _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Benjamin~, coat. Formerly termed a JOSEPH, in allusion, perhaps, to\r\nJoseph’s coat of many colours.—_See_ UPPER-BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\n~Ben Joltram~, brown bread and skimmed milk; a Norfolk term for a\r\nploughboy’s breakfast.\r\n\r\n~Benjy~, a waistcoat, diminutive of BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\n~Beong~, a shilling.—_See_ SALTEE.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Bess-o’-Bedlam~, a lunatic vagrant.—_Norfolk._\r\n\r\n~Best~, to get the better or BEST of a man in any way—not necessarily\r\nto cheat—to have the best of a bargain. BESTED, taken in, or defrauded,\r\nin reality worsted. BESTER, a low betting cheat, a fraudulent bookmaker.\r\n\r\n~Better~, more; “how far is it to town?” “Oh, BETTER ’n a mile.”—_Saxon_\r\nand _Old English_, now a vulgarism.\r\n\r\n~Betting Round~, laying fairly and equally against nearly all the horses\r\nin a race so that no great risk can be run.

A big red-faced\r\nIrish servant girl is known as a Bridget.\r\n\r\n~Big~, “to look BIG,” to assume an inflated air or manner; “to talk\r\nBIG,” _i.e._, boastingly.\r\n\r\n~Big-Bird~, TO GET THE, _i.e._, to be hissed, as actors occasionally are\r\nby the “gods.” BIG-BIRD is simply a metaphor for goose.—_Theat. Slang._\r\n\r\n~Big House~, or LARGE HOUSE, the workhouse,—a phrase used by the very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n~Big-wig~, a person in authority or office. Exchangeable with “GREAT\r\nGUN.”\r\n\r\n~Bilbo~, a sword; abbrev. of “BILBAO blade.” Spanish swords were\r\nanciently very celebrated, especially those of Toledo, Bilbao, &c.\r\n\r\n~Bilk~, a cheat, or a swindler. Formerly in general use, now confined to\r\nthe streets, where it is common, and mostly used in reference to\r\nprostitutes. _Gothic_, BILAICAN.\r\n\r\n~Bilk~, to defraud, or obtain goods, &c., without paying for them; “to\r\nBILK the schoolmaster,” to get information or experience without paying\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n~Billingsgate~ (when applied to speech), foul and coarse language. Many\r\nyears since people used to visit Thames Street to hear the Billingsgate\r\nfishwomen abuse each other. The anecdote of Dr. Johnson and the\r\nBillingsgate virago is well known.\r\n\r\n~Billingsgate Pheasant~, a red herring or bloater. This is also called a\r\n“two-eyed steak.”\r\n\r\n~Billy~, a silk pocket-handkerchief.—_Scotch._—_See_ WIPE.\r\n\r\n⁂ A list of slang terms descriptive of the various patterns of\r\nhandkerchiefs, pocket and neck, is here subjoined:—\r\n\r\n    BELCHER, darkish blue ground, large round white spots, with a spot\r\n    in the centre of darker blue than the ground. This was adopted by\r\n    Jem Belcher, the pugilist, as his “colours,” and soon became popular\r\n    amongst “the fancy.”\r\n\r\n    BIRD’S-EYE WIPE, a handkerchief of any colour, containing white\r\n    spots. The blue bird’s-eye is similar to the Belcher except in the\r\n    centre. Sometimes a BIRD’S-EYE WIPE has a white ground and blue\r\n    spots.\r\n\r\n    BLOOD-RED FANCY, red.\r\n\r\n    BLUE BILLY, blue ground, generally with white figures.\r\n\r\n    CREAM FANCY, any pattern on a white ground.\r\n\r\n    KING’S MAN, yellow pattern on a green ground.\r\n\r\n    RANDAL’S MAN, green, with white spots; named after the favourite\r\n    colours of Jack Randal, pugilist.\r\n\r\n    WATER’S MAN, sky coloured.\r\n\r\n    YELLOW FANCY, yellow, with white spots.\r\n\r\n    YELLOW MAN, all yellow.\r\n\r\n~Billy~, a policeman’s staff. Also stolen metal of any kind.\r\nBILLY-HUNTING is buying old metal. A BILLY-FENCER is a marine-store\r\ndealer.\r\n\r\n~Billy-Barlow~, a street clown; sometimes termed a JIM CROW, or\r\nSALTIMBANCO,—so called from the hero of a slang song. Billy was a real\r\nperson, semi-idiotic, and though in dirt and rags, fancied himself a\r\nswell of the first water. Occasionally he came out with real witticisms.\r\nHe was a well-known street character about the East-end of London, and\r\ndied in Whitechapel Workhouse.\r\n\r\n~Billy-Cock~, a soft felt hat of the Jim Crow or “wide-awake”\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n~Bingo~, brandy.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Bingy~, a term largely used in the butter trade to denote bad, ropy\r\nbutter; nearly equivalent to VINNIED.\r\n\r\n~Bird-Cage~, a four-wheeled cab.\r\n\r\n~Birthday Suit~, the suit in which Adam and Eve first saw each other,\r\nand “were not ashamed.”\r\n\r\n~Bishop~, a warm drink composed of materials similar to those used in\r\nthe manufacture of “flip” and “purl.”\r\n\r\n~Bit~, fourpence; in America a 12-1/2 cent piece is called a BIT, and a\r\ndefaced 20 cent piece is termed a LONG BIT. A BIT is the smallest coin\r\nin Jamaica, equal to 6d. BIT usually means the smallest silver coin in\r\ncirculation; also a piece of money of any kind. Charles Bannister, the\r\nwitty singer and actor, one day meeting a Bow Street runner with a man\r\nin custody, asked what the prisoner had done; and being told that he had\r\nstolen a bridle, and had been detected in the act of selling it, said,\r\n“Ah, then, he wanted to touch the BIT.”\r\n\r\n~Bitch~, tea; “a BITCH party,” a tea-drinking. Probably because\r\nundergraduates consider tea only fit for old women.—_Oxford._\r\n\r\n~Bite~, a cheat; “a Yorkshire BITE,” a cheating fellow from that county.\r\nThe term BITE is also applied to a hard bargainer.—_North_; also _old\r\nslang_—used by _Pope_. Swift says it originated with a nobleman in his\r\nday.\r\n\r\n~Bite~, to cheat; “to be BITTEN,” to be taken in or imposed upon.\r\nOriginally a Gipsy term. CROSS-BITER, for a cheat, continually\r\noccurs in writers of the sixteenth century. Bailey has CROSS-BITE, a\r\ndisappointment, probably the primary sense; and BITE is very probably a\r\ncontraction of this.\r\n\r\n~Bit-Faker~, or TURNER OUT, a coiner of bad money.\r\n\r\n~Bit-of-Stuff~, overdressed man; a man with full confidence in his\r\nappearance and abilities; a young woman, who is also called a BIT OF\r\nMUSLIN.\r\n\r\n~Bitter~, diminutive of bitter beer; “to do a BITTER,” to drink\r\nbeer.—Originally _Oxford_, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Bittock~, a distance of very undecided length. If a North countryman be\r\nasked the distance to a place, he will most probably reply, “a mile and\r\na BITTOCK.” The latter may be considered any distance from one hundred\r\nyards to ten miles.\r\n\r\n~Bivvy~, or GATTER, beer; “shant of BIVVY,” a pot or quart of beer. In\r\nSuffolk the afternoon refreshment of reapers is called BEVER. It is also\r\nan old English term.\r\n\r\n    “He is none of those same ordinary eaters, that will devour three\r\n    breakfasts, and as many dinners, without any prejudice to their\r\n    BEVERS, drinkings, or suppers.”—_Beaumont and Fletcher’s Woman\r\n    Hater_, i. 3.\r\n\r\nBoth words are probably from the _Italian_, BEVERE, BERE. _Latin_,\r\nBIBERE. _English_, BEVERAGE.\r\n\r\n~Biz~, contraction of the word business; a phrase much used in America\r\nin writing as well as in conversation.\r\n\r\n~B. K. S.~ Military officers in _mufti_, when out on a spree, and not\r\nwishing their profession to be known, speak of their barracks as the\r\nB. K. S.\r\n\r\n~Black and White~, handwriting or print. “Let’s have it in BLACK AND\r\nWHITE,” is often said with regard to an agreement when it is to the\r\nadvantage of one or both that it should be written.\r\n\r\n~Black-a-vised~, having a very dark complexion.\r\n\r\n~Blackberry-Swagger~, a person who hawks tapes, boot-laces, &c.\r\n\r\n~Blackbirding~, slave-catching. Term most applied nowadays to the\r\nPolynesian coolie traffic.\r\n\r\n~Black Diamonds~, coals; talented persons of dingy or unpolished\r\nexterior; rough jewels.\r\n\r\n~Blackguard~, a low or dirty fellow; a rough or a hulking fellow,\r\ncapable of any meanness or cowardice.\r\n\r\n    “A cant word amongst the vulgar, by which is implied a dirty fellow\r\n    of the meanest kind, Dr. Johnson says, and he cites only the modern\r\n    authority of Swift. But the introduction of this word into our\r\n    language belongs not to the vulgar, and is more than a century prior\r\n    to the time of Swift. Mr. Malone agrees with me in exhibiting the\r\n    two first of the following examples:—The _black-guard_ is evidently\r\n    designed to imply a fit attendant on the devil. Mr. Gifford,\r\n    however, in his late edition of Ben Jonson’s works, assigns an\r\n    origin of the name different from what the old examples which I have\r\n    cited seem to countenance. It has been formed, he says, from those\r\n    ‘mean and dirty dependants, in great houses, who were selected to\r\n    carry coals to the kitchen, halls, &c. To this smutty regiment, who\r\n    attended the progresses, and rode in the carts with the pots and\r\n    kettles, which, with every other article of furniture, were then\r\n    moved from palace to palace, the people, in derision, gave the name\r\n    of _black guards_; a term since become sufficiently familiar, and\r\n    never properly explained.’”—_Todd’s Johnson’s Dictionary._\r\n\r\nBlackguard as an adjective is very powerful.\r\n\r\n~Blackleg~, a rascal, swindler, or card cheat. The derivation of this\r\nterm was solemnly argued before the full Court of Queen’s Bench upon a\r\nmotion for a new trial for libel, but was not decided by the learned\r\ntribunal. Probably it is from the custom of sporting and turf men\r\nwearing black _top-boots_. Hence BLACKLEG came to be the phrase for a\r\nprofessional sporting man, and thence for a professional sporting cheat.\r\nThe word is now in its worst sense diminished to “leg.”\r\n\r\n~Black Maria~, the sombre van in which prisoners are conveyed from the\r\npolice court to prison.\r\n\r\n~Black Monday~, the Monday on which boys return to school after the\r\nholidays. Also a low term for the Monday on which an execution took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n~Black Sheep~, a “bad lot,” “_mauvais sujet_;” sometimes “scabby sheep;”\r\nalso a workman who refuses to join in a strike.\r\n\r\n~Black Strap~, port wine; especially that which is thick and sweet.\r\n\r\n~Blackwork~, undertaking. The waiters met at public dinners are often\r\nemployed during the day as mutes, etc. Omnibus and cab drivers regard\r\nBLACKWORK as a _dernier ressort_.\r\n\r\n~Bladder-of-Lard~, a coarse, satirical nickname for a bald-headed\r\nperson. From similarity of appearance.\r\n\r\n~Blade~, a man—in ancient times the term for a soldier; “knowing\r\nBLADE,” a wide-awake, sharp, or cunning man.\r\n\r\n~Blarney~, flattery, powers of persuasion. A castle in the county of\r\nCork. It is said that whoever kisses a certain stone in this castle will\r\nbe able to persuade others of whatever he or she pleases. The name of\r\nthe castle is derived from BLADH, a blossom, _i.e._, the flowery or\r\nfertile demesne. BLADH is also flattery; hence the connexion. A more\r\nthan ordinarily persuasive Irishman is said to have “kissed the BLARNEY\r\nstone.”\r\n\r\n~Blast~, to curse. Originally a _Military_ expression.\r\n\r\n~Blaze~, to leave trace purposely of one’s way in a forest or unknown\r\npath by marking trees or other objects.\r\n\r\n~Blazes~, a low synonym for the infernal regions, and now almost for\r\nanything. “Like BLAZES” is a phrase of intensification applied without\r\nany reference to the original meaning. Also applied to the brilliant\r\nhabiliments of flunkeys, since the episode of Sam Weller and the\r\n“swarry.”\r\n\r\n~Bleed~, to victimize, or extract money from a person, to sponge on, to\r\nmake suffer vindictively.\r\n\r\n~Blest~, a vow; “BLEST if I’ll do it,” _i.e._, I am determined not to do\r\nit; euphemism for CURST.\r\n\r\n~Blether~, to bother, to annoy, to pester. “A BLETHERING old nuisance”\r\nis a common expression for a garrulous old person.\r\n\r\n~Blew~, or BLOW, to inform, or peach, to lose or spend money.\r\n\r\n~Blewed~, a man who has lost or spent all his money is said to have\r\nBLEWED it. Also used in cases of robbery from the person, as, “He’s\r\nBLEWED his red ’un,” _i.e._, he’s been eased of his watch.\r\n\r\n~Blewed~, got rid of, disposed of, spent.\r\n\r\n~Blind~, a pretence, or make-believe.\r\n\r\n~Blind-Half-Hundred~, the Fiftieth Regiment of Foot; so called through\r\ntheir great sufferings from ophthalmia when serving in Egypt.\r\n\r\n~Blind-Hookey~, a game at cards which has no recommendation beyond the\r\nrapidity with which money can be won and lost at it; called also WILFUL\r\nMURDER.\r\n\r\n~Blind-Man’s-Holiday~, night, darkness. Sometimes applied to the period\r\n“between the lights.”\r\n\r\n~Blind Monkeys~, an imaginary collection at the Zoological Gardens,\r\nwhich are supposed to receive care and attention from persons fitted by\r\nnature for such office and for little else. An idle and useless person\r\nis often told that he is only fit to lead the BLIND MONKEYS to evacuate.\r\nAnother form this elegant conversation takes, is for one man to tell\r\nanother that he knows of a suitable situation for him. “How much a week?\r\nand what to do?” are natural questions, and then comes the scathing and\r\nsarcastic reply, “Five bob a week at the doctor’s—you’re to stand\r\nbehind the door and make the patients sick. They wont want no physic\r\nwhen they sees your mug.”\r\n\r\n~Blinker~, a blackened eye.—_Norwich._ Also a hard blow in the eye.\r\nBLINKERS, spectacles.\r\n\r\n~Blink-Fencer~, a person who sells spectacles.\r\n\r\n~Bloated Aristocrat~, a street term for any decently dressed person.\r\nFrom the persistent abuse lavished on a “bloated and parasitical\r\naristocracy” by Hyde Park demagogues and a certain unpleasant portion of\r\nthe weekly press.\r\n\r\n~Bloater.~—_See_ MILD.\r\n\r\n~Blob~ (from BLAB), to talk. Beggars are of two kinds—those who SCREEVE\r\n(introducing themselves with a FAKEMENT, or false document) and those\r\nwho BLOB, or state their case in their own truly “unvarnished” language.\r\n\r\n~Block~, the head. “To BLOCK a hat,” is to knock a man’s hat down over\r\nhis eyes.—_See_ BONNET. Also a street obstruction.\r\n\r\n~Block Ornaments~, the small dark-coloured and sometimes stinking pieces\r\nof meat which used to be exposed on the cheap butchers’ blocks or\r\ncounters; matters of interest to all the sharp-visaged women in poor\r\nneighbourhoods. Since the great rise in the price of meat there has been\r\nlittle necessity for butchers to make block ornaments of their odds and\r\nends. They are bespoke beforehand.\r\n\r\n~Bloke~, a man; “the BLOKE with the jasey,” the man with the wig,\r\n_i.e._, the Judge. _Gipsy_ and _Hindoo_, LOKE. _North_, BLOACHER, any\r\nlarge animal.\r\n\r\n~Blood~, a fast or high-mettled man. Nearly obsolete, but much used in\r\nGeorge the Fourth’s time.\r\n\r\n~Blood-money~, the money that used to be paid to any one who by\r\ninformation or evidence led to a conviction for a capital offence.\r\nNowadays applied to all sums received by informers.\r\n\r\n~Blood-Red Fancy~, a particular kind of handkerchief sometimes worn by\r\npugilists and frequenters of prize fights.—_See_ BILLY and COLOUR.\r\n\r\n~Bloody~, an expletive used, without reference to meaning, as an\r\nadjective and an adverb, simply for intensification.\r\n\r\n~Bloody Jemmy~, an uncooked sheep’s head.—_See_ SANGUINARY JAMES. Also\r\nMOUNTAIN PECKER.\r\n\r\n~Blow~, to expose, or inform; “BLOW the gaff,” to inform against a\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n    “‘As for that,’ says Will, ‘I could tell it well enough, if I had\r\n    it, but I must not be seen anywhere among my old acquaintances, for\r\n    I am BLOWN, and they will all betray me.’”—_History of Colonel\r\n    Jack_, 1723.\r\n\r\nThe expression would seem to have arisen from the belief that a flower\r\nmight be blighted if “BLOWN upon” by a foul wind or a corrupted breath.\r\nSee the condition of the flowers on a dinner-table by the time the\r\ncompany rise. In _America_, “to BLOW” is slang for to lie in a boasting\r\nmanner, to brag or “gas” unduly.\r\n\r\n~Blow a Cloud~, to smoke a cigar or pipe—a phrase used two centuries\r\nago. Most likely in use as long as tobacco here—an almost evident\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n~Blow Me~, or BLOW ME TIGHT, a vow, a ridiculous and unmeaning\r\nejaculation, inferring an appeal to the ejaculator; “I’m BLOWED if you\r\nwill” is a common expression among the lower orders; “BLOW ME UP” was\r\nthe term a century ago.—_See Parker’s Adventures_, 1781.—The\r\nexpression BE-BLOWED is now more general. Thomas Hood used to tell a\r\nstory:—\r\n\r\n    “I was once asked to contribute to a new journal, not exactly\r\n    gratuitously, but at a very small advance upon nothing—and avowedly\r\n    because the work had been planned according to that estimate.\r\n    However, I accepted the terms conditionally—that is to say,\r\n    provided the principle could be properly carried out. Accordingly, I\r\n    wrote to my butcher, baker, and other tradesmen, informing them that\r\n    it was necessary, for the sake of cheap literature and the interest\r\n    of the reading public, that they should furnish me with their\r\n    several commodities at a very trifling per-centage above cost price.\r\n    It will be sufficient to quote the answer of the\r\n    butcher:—‘Sir,—Respectin’ your note, Cheap literater BE BLOWED!\r\n    Butchers must live as well as other pepel—and if so be you or the\r\n    readin’ publick wants to have meat at prime cost, you must buy your\r\n    own beastesses, and kill yourselves.—I remane, etc.\r\n\r\n    “‘JOHN STOKES.’”\r\n\r\n~Blow Out~, or TUCK IN, a feast. Sometimes the expression is, “BLOW OUT\r\nyour bags.” A BLOW OUT is often called a tightener.\r\n\r\n~Blow Up~, to make a noise, or scold; formerly a cant expression used\r\namong thieves, now a recognised and respectable phrase. BLOWING UP, a\r\njobation, a scolding.\r\n\r\n~Blowen~, originally a showy or flaunting female, now a prostitute only.\r\nIn _Wilts_, a BLOWEN is a blossom. _Germ._ BLÜHEN, to bloom. In\r\n_German_, also, BUHLEN is to court, and BUHLE, a sweetheart.\r\n\r\n    “O du _blühende_ Mädchen, viel schöne Willkomm!”—_German Song._\r\n\r\nPossibly, however, the street term BLOWEN may mean one whose reputation\r\nhas been BLOWN UPON or damaged.\r\n\r\n~Blower~, a girl; a contemptuous name in opposition to JOMER.—_Gipsy._\r\n\r\n~Blowsey~, a word applied to a rough wench, or coarse woman.\r\n\r\n~Bludger~, a low thief, who does not hesitate to use violence, literally\r\none who will use a bludgeon.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, said of talk that is smutty or indecent. Probably from the\r\nFrench, “Bibliothèque Bleu.” When the conversation has assumed an\r\nentirely opposite character, it is then said to be BROWN or Quakerish.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, a policeman; otherwise BLUE BOTTLE. From the colour of his\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, or BLEW, to pawn or pledge. Actually to get rid of.\r\n\r\n~Blue~, confounded or surprised; “to look BLUE,” to look astonished,\r\nannoyed, or disappointed.\r\n\r\n~Blue Bellies~, a term applied by the Confederate soldiers during the\r\ncivil war in America to the Federals, the name being suggested by the\r\nskyblue gaberdines worn by the Northern soldiers. On the other hand, the\r\n“filthy BLUE BELLIES,” as the full title ran, dubbed the Confederates\r\n“Greybacks,” the epithet cutting both ways, as the Southern soldiers not\r\nonly wore grey uniforms, but “greyback” is American as well as English\r\nfor a louse.\r\n\r\n~Blue Billy~, the handkerchief (blue ground with white spots) sometimes\r\nworn and used as a colour at prize-fights. Also, the refuse ammoniacal\r\nlime from gas factories.\r\n\r\n~Blue Blanket~, a rough overcoat made of coarse pilot cloth.\r\n\r\n~Blue Bottle~, a policeman. This well-known slang term for a London\r\nconstable is used by _Shakspeare_. In Part ii. of _King Henry IV._, act\r\nv. scene 4, Doll Tearsheet calls the beadle, who is dragging her in, a\r\n“thin man in a censer, a BLUE-BOTTLE rogue.” This may at first seem\r\nsingular, but the reason is obvious. The beadles of Bridewell whose duty\r\nit was to whip the women prisoners were clad in blue.\r\n\r\n~Blue Butter~, mercurial ointment used for the destruction of parasites.\r\n\r\n~Blued~, or BLEWED, tipsy, or drunk. Now given way to SLEWED.\r\n\r\n~Blue Devils~, the apparitions supposed to be seen by habitual\r\ndrunkards. Form of _del. trem._\r\n\r\n~Blue Moon~, an unlimited period. “Once in a blue moon.”\r\n\r\n~Blue Murders.~ Probably from desperate or alarming cries. A term used\r\nmore to describe cries of terror or alarm than for any other purpose.\r\nAs, “I heard her calling BLUE MURDERS.”—MORBLEU.\r\n\r\n~Blue-Pigeon-Flyer~, sometimes a journeyman plumber, glazier, or other\r\nworkman, who, when repairing houses, strips off the lead, and makes away\r\nwith it. This performance is, though, by no means confined to workmen.\r\nAn empty house is often entered and the whole of the roof in its\r\nvicinity stripped, the only notice given to the folks below being\r\nreceived by them on the occasion of a heavy downfall of rain. The term\r\nFLYER has, indeed, of late years been more peculiarly applied to the man\r\nwho steals the lead in pursuance of his vocation as a thief, than to him\r\nwho takes it because it comes in the way of his work.\r\n\r\n~Blue Ruin~, gin.\r\n\r\n~Blues~, a fit of despondency.—_See_ BLUE DEVILS.\r\n\r\n~Blues~, the police. Sometimes called the Royal Regiment of Foot-guards\r\nBLUE.\r\n\r\n~Bluey~, lead.—German, BLEI. Most likely, though, from the colour, as\r\nthe term is of the very lowest slang.\r\n\r\n~Bluff~, an excuse; also the game at cards known as euchre in America.\r\n\r\n~Bluff~, to turn aside, stop, or excuse.\r\n\r\n~Blunt~, money. It has been said that this term is from the _French_\r\nBLOND, sandy or golden colour, and that a parallel may be found in BROWN\r\nor BROWNS, the slang for half-pence. Far-fetched as this etymology\r\nseems, it may be correct, as it is borne out by the analogy of similar\r\nexpressions. Cf. BLANQUILLO, a word used in Morocco and Southern Spain\r\nfor a small Moorish coin. The “asper” (ἄσπρον) of Constantinople is\r\ncalled by the Turks AKCHEH, _i.e._, “little white.”\r\n\r\n~Blurt Out~, to speak from impulse, and without reflection, to let out\r\nsuddenly.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~B.N.C.~, for Brasenose, initials of Brazen Nose College. In spite of\r\nthe nose over the gate the probability is the real name was Brasinium.\r\nIt is still famous for its beer.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Board-of-Green-Cloth~, a facetious synonym for a card or billiard\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n~Boat~, originally to transport; the term is now applied to penal\r\nservitude. To “get the BOAT,” or to “be BOATED,” is to be sentenced to a\r\nlong term of imprisonment equivalent to transportation under the old\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n~Bob~, a shilling. Formerly BOBSTICK, which may have been the original.\r\nBOB-A-NOB, a shilling a-head.\r\n\r\n~Bob~, “s’help me BOB,” a street oath, equivalent to “so help me God.”\r\nOther words are used in street language for a similarly evasive purpose,\r\n_i.e._, CAT, GREENS, TATUR, &c., all equally ridiculous. Ignorant people\r\nhave a singular habit of saying “so help _my_,” instead of “_me_,”\r\nwhatever the following words may be. This shows how little they think of\r\nthe meanings of the phrases most in use among them. The words “so help”\r\nare almost invariably pronounced “swelp.”\r\n\r\n~Bobbery~, a squabble, tumult.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Bobbish~, very well, clever, spruce. “How are you doing?” “Oh! pretty\r\nBOBBISH.”—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Bobby~, a policeman: both BOBBY and PEELER were nicknames given to the\r\nnew police, in allusion to the Christian name and surname of the late\r\n_Sir Robert Peel_, who was the prime mover in effecting their\r\nintroduction and improvement. The term BOBBY is, however, older than the\r\nintroduction of the new police. The official square-keeper, who is\r\nalways armed with a cane to drive away idle and disorderly urchins, has,\r\ntime out of mind, been called by the said urchins, “BOBBY the beadle.”\r\n\r\n~Bodkin~, any one sitting between two others in a carriage, is said “to\r\nride BODKIN.” Amongst sporting men, applied to a person who takes his\r\nturn between the sheets on alternate nights, when the hotel has twice as\r\nmany visitors as it can comfortably lodge; as, for instance, during a\r\nrace-week.\r\n\r\n~Body-Snatcher~, a bailiff or runner: SNATCH, the trick by which the\r\nbailiff captures the delinquent. These terms are now almost obsolete, so\r\nfar as the pursuits mentioned are concerned.\r\n\r\n~Bog~, or BOG-HOUSE, a privy, as distinguished from a water-closet.\r\nOriginally printers’ slang, but now very common, and not applied to any\r\nparticular form of _cabinet d’aisance_. “To BOG” is to ease oneself by\r\nevacuation.\r\n\r\n~Bog-Oranges~, potatoes. A phrase perhaps derived from the term “Irish\r\nfruit,” which, by some strange peculiarity has been applied to potatoes;\r\nfor even the most ignorant Cockney could hardly believe that potatoes\r\ngrow in a bog. As, however, the majority of the lower classes of London\r\ndo believe that potatoes were indigenous to, and were first brought from\r\nthe soil of Ireland, which is also in some parts supposed to be capable\r\nof growing nothing else, they may even believe that potatoes are\r\nactually BOG-ORANGES.\r\n\r\n~Bog-Trotter~, satirical name for an Irishman.—_Miege._ _Camden_,\r\nhowever, speaking of the “debateable land” on the borders of England and\r\nScotland, says, “both these dales breed notable BOG-TROTTERS.”\r\n\r\n~Bogus~, an American term for anything pretending to be that which it is\r\nnot—such as BOGUS degrees, BOGUS titles, &c.\r\n\r\n~Boilers~, or BROMPTON BOILERS, a name originally given to the New\r\nKensington Museum and School of Art, in allusion to the peculiar form of\r\nthe buildings, and the fact of their being mainly composed of, and\r\ncovered with, sheet iron. This has been changed since the extensive\r\nalterations in the building, or rather pile of buildings, and the words\r\nare now the property of the Bethnal Green Museum.—_See_ PEPPER-BOXES.\r\n\r\n~Boko~, the nose. Originally pugilistic slang, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Bolt~, to run away, decamp, or abscond. Also to swallow without\r\nchewing. To eat greedily.\r\n\r\n~Bolus~, an apothecary. Origin evident.\r\n\r\n~Bombay Ducks;~ in the East India Company’s army the Bombay regiments\r\nwere so designated. The name is now given to a dried fish (_bummelow_),\r\nmuch eaten by natives and Europeans in Western India.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Bone~, to steal or appropriate what does not belong to you. BONED,\r\nseized, apprehended.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Bone~, good, excellent. ◇, the vagabonds’ hieroglyphic for BONE, or\r\ngood, chalked by them on houses and street corners as a hint to\r\nsucceeding beggars.—_French_, BON.\r\n\r\n~Bone-Grubber~, a person who hunts dust-holes, gutters, and all likely\r\nspots for refuse bones, which he sells at the rag-shops, or to the\r\nbone-grinders. The term was also applied to a resurrectionist. Cobbett\r\nwas therefore called “a BONE GRUBBER,” because he brought the remains of\r\nTom Paine from America.\r\n\r\n~Bone-Picker~, a footman.\r\n\r\n~Bones~, to rattle the BONES, to play at dice: also called St. Hugh’s\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\n~Bones~, “he made no BONES of it,” he did not hesitate, _i.e._,\r\nundertook and finished the work without difficulty, “found no BONES in\r\nthe jelly.”—_Ancient, vide Cotgrave._\r\n\r\n~Boniface~, landlord of a tavern or inn.\r\n\r\n~Bonnet~, or BONNETER, a gambling cheat. Sometimes called a “bearer-up.”\r\nThe BONNET plays as though he were a member of the general public, and\r\nby his good luck, or by the force of his example, induces others to\r\nventure their stakes. Bonneting is often done in much better society\r\nthan that to be found in the ordinary gaming rooms. A man who persuades\r\nanother to buy an article on which he receives commission or per-centage\r\nis said to BONNET or bear-up for the seller. Also, a pretence, or\r\nmake-believe, a sham bidder at auctions, one who metaphorically blinds\r\nor BONNETS others.\r\n\r\n~Bonnet~, to strike a man’s cap or hat over his eyes. Also to “bear-up”\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n~Booby-Trap~, a favourite amusement of boys at school. It consists in\r\nplacing a pitcher of water on the top of a door set ajar for the\r\npurpose; the person whom they wish to drench is then made to pass\r\nthrough the door, and receives the pitcher and its contents on his\r\nunlucky head. Books are sometimes used.\r\n\r\n~Book~, an arrangement of bets against certain horses marked in a\r\npocket-book made for that purpose. “Making a BOOK upon it,” is a common\r\nphrase to denote that a man is prepared to lay the odds against the\r\nhorses in a race. “That does not suit my BOOK,” _i.e._, does not accord\r\nwith my other arrangements. The principle of making a BOOK, or betting\r\nround, as it is sometimes termed, is to lay a previously-determined sum\r\nagainst every horse in the race, or as many horses as possible; and\r\nshould the bookmaker “get round,” _i.e._, succeed in laying against as\r\nmany horses as will more than balance the odds laid, he is certain to be\r\na winner. The BOOKMAKER is distinguished from the backer by its being\r\nhis particular business to bet against horses, or to lay, while the\r\nbacker, who is also often a professional gambler, stands by the chance\r\nof a horse, or the chances of a set of horses about which he supposes\r\nhimself to be possessed of special information. A bookmaker rarely backs\r\nhorses for his own particular fancy—he may indeed put a sovereign or a\r\nfiver on an animal about which he has been told something, but as a rule\r\nif he specially fancies a horse, the bookmaker lets him “run for the\r\nBOOK,” _i.e._, does not lay against him. When a bookmaker backs a horse\r\nin the course of his regular business, it is because he has laid too\r\nmuch against him, and finds it convenient to share the danger with other\r\nbookmakers.\r\n\r\n~Booked~, caught, fixed, disposed of.—Term in _Book-keeping_.\r\n\r\n~Bookmaker’s Pocket~, a breast-pocket made inside the waistcoat, for\r\nnotes of large amount.\r\n\r\n~Books~, a pack of cards. Term used by professional card-players.—_See_\r\nDEVIL’S BOOKS.\r\n\r\n~Boom~, “to top one’s BOOM off,” to be off or start in a certain\r\ndirection.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Boom-Passenger~, a sailor’s slang term for a convict on board ship.\r\nDerived from the circumstance that prisoners on board convict ships were\r\nchained to, or were made to crawl along or stand on the booms for\r\nexercise or punishment.\r\n\r\n~Boon-Companion~, a comrade in a drinking bout. BOON evidently\r\ncorruption of BON.\r\n\r\n~Booze~, drink. _Ancient Cant_, BOWSE. BOOZE, or SUCK-CASA, a\r\npublic-house.\r\n\r\n~Booze~, to drink, or more properly, to use another slang term, to\r\n“lush,” viz., to drink continually, until drunk, or nearly so. The term\r\nis an old one. _Harman_, in Queen Elizabeth’s days, speaks of “BOUSING\r\n(or boozing) and belly-cheere.” _Massinger_ also speaks of BOUSE. The\r\nterm was good English in the fourteenth century, and came from the\r\n_Dutch_, BUYZEN, to tipple.\r\n\r\n~Boozing-Ken~, a beer-shop, a low public-house.—_Ancient._\r\n\r\n~Boozy~, intoxicated or fuddled.\r\n\r\n~Bore~, a troublesome friend or acquaintance, perhaps so called from his\r\nunvaried and pertinacious pushing; a nuisance; anything which wearies or\r\nannoys. The _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_ suggests the derivation of BORE\r\nfrom the _Greek_ Βάρος, a burden. _Shakspeare_ uses it, _King Henry\r\nVIII._, i. 1—\r\n\r\n            “----at this instant\r\n    He BORES me with some trick.”\r\n\r\n_Grose_ speaks of this word as being much in fashion about the year\r\n1780-81, and states that it vanished of a sudden without leaving a trace\r\nbehind. That this was not so, the constant use of the word nowadays will\r\nprove. The late Prince Consort spoke as follows on the subject of BORES\r\nin his address to the British Association, at Aberdeen, September 14,\r\n1859—\r\n\r\n    “I will not weary you by further examples, with which most of you\r\n    are better acquainted than I am myself, but merely express my\r\n    satisfaction that there should exist bodies of men who will bring\r\n    the well-considered and understood wants of science before the\r\n    public and the Government, who will even hand round the begging-box,\r\n    and expose themselves to refusals and rebuffs, to which all beggars\r\n    are liable, with the certainty besides of being considered great\r\n    BORES. Please to recollect that this species of BORE is a most\r\n    useful animal, well adapted for the ends for which nature intended\r\n    him. He alone, by constantly returning to the charge, and repeating\r\n    the same truths and the same requests, succeeds in awakening\r\n    attention to the cause which he advocates, and obtains that hearing\r\n    which is granted him at last for self-protection, as the minor evil\r\n    compared to his importunity, but which is requisite to make his\r\n    cause understood.”\r\n\r\n~Bore~ (_Pugilistic_), to press a man to the ropes of the ring by\r\nsuperior weight. In the world of athletics to BORE is to push an\r\nopponent out of his course. This is a most heinous crime among rowers,\r\nas it very often prevents a man having the full use of the tide, or\r\ncompels him to foul, in which case the decision of the race is left to\r\nindividual judgment, at times, of necessity, erroneous.\r\n\r\n~Bosh~, nonsense, stupidity.—_Gipsy_ and _Persian_. Also pure\r\n_Turkish_, BOSH LAKERDI, empty talk. The term was used in this country\r\nas early as 1760, and may be found in the _Student_, vol. ii. p. 217. It\r\nhas been suggested, with what reason the reader must judge for himself,\r\nthat this colloquial expression is from the _German_ BOSH, or BOSSCH,\r\nanswering to our word “swipes.”\r\n\r\n~Bosh~, a fiddle. This is a _Gipsy_ term, and so the exclamations\r\n“Bosh!” and “Fiddle-de-dee!” may have some remote connexion.\r\n\r\n~Bosh-Faker~, a violin player. Term principally used by itinerants.\r\n\r\n~Bos-Ken~, a farmhouse. _Ancient._—_See_ KEN.\r\n\r\n~Bosky~, inebriated. Not much in use now.\r\n\r\n~Bosman~, a farmer: “faking a BOSMAN on the main toby,” robbing a farmer\r\non the highway. BOSS, a master.—_American._ Both terms from the\r\n_Dutch_, BOSCH-MAN, one who lives in the woods; otherwise _Boschjeman_,\r\nor _Bushman_.\r\n\r\n~Boss-Eyed~, said of a person with one eye, or rather with one eye\r\ninjured, a person with an obliquity of vision. In this sense sometimes\r\nvaried by the term “swivel-eyed.”\r\n\r\n~Bostruchyzer~, a small kind of comb for curling the whiskers.—_Oxford\r\nUniversity._\r\n\r\n~Botany Bay~, Worcester Coll. Oxon., so called from its remote\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n~Bother~, trouble or annoyance. Any one oppressed with business cares is\r\nsaid to be BOTHERED. “Don’t BOTHER,” is a common expression. BLOTHER, an\r\nold word, signifying to chatter idly.\r\n\r\n~Botheration!~ trouble, annoyance; “BOTHERATION to it!” “confound it!”\r\nor “deuce take it!”—an exclamation when irritated.\r\n\r\n~Bottle-Holder~, originally a term in prize ring parlance for the second\r\nwho took charge of the water-bottle, which was an essential feature in\r\nall pugilistic arrangements. This second used to hold the combatant on\r\nhis knee between the rounds, while the other or principal second\r\nsponged, instructed, and advised; an abettor; also the bridegroom’s man\r\nat a wedding. Slang term for Lord Palmerston, derived from a speech he\r\nmade some years ago when foreign secretary, in which he described\r\nhimself as acting the part of a judicious BOTTLE-HOLDER among the\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\n~Bottom~, stamina in a horse or man. Power to stand fatigue; endurance\r\nto receive a good beating and still fight on. “A fellow of pluck, sound\r\nwind, and good BOTTOM is fit to fight anything.” This was an old axiom\r\namong prize fighters. Pierce Egan was very fond of the word.\r\n\r\n~Bottom~, spirit placed in a glass before aërated water is poured in.\r\nAs, “a soda and a BOTTOM of brandy,” “soda and dark BOTTOM,” is American\r\nfor soda and brown brandy.\r\n\r\n    “BOTTOMED well with brandy.”—_Bon Gaultier Ballads._\r\n\r\n~Botts~, the colic or bellyache.—_Stable Slang._ _Burns_ uses it. _See\r\nDeath and Dr. Hornbook._\r\n\r\n~Botty~, conceited, swaggering.—_Stable._ An infant’s\r\nposteriors.—_Nursery._\r\n\r\n~Bounce~, impudence, cheek. A showy swindler, a bully.\r\n\r\n~Bounce~, to boast, cheat, or bully.—_Old Cant._ Also to lie.\r\n\r\n~Bounceable~, prone to bouncing or boasting.\r\n\r\n~Bouncer~, a person who steals whilst bargaining with a tradesman, a\r\nswindler, or a lie of more than ordinary dimensions.\r\n\r\n~Bounder~, a four-wheeled cab. Because of its jumping motion over the\r\nstones. Also a University term for a TRAP, which generally has a very\r\nrough time of it on the country roads.\r\n\r\n~Bow-Catcher~, or KISS-CURL, a small curl which a few years back used to\r\nbe, and probably will be again some day, twisted on the cheeks or\r\ntemples of young—and often old—girls, adhering to the face as if\r\ngummed or pasted. Evidently a corruption of BEAU-CATCHER. In old times\r\nthis was called a lovelock, when it was the mark at which all the\r\nPuritan and ranting preachers levelled their pulpit pop-guns, loaded\r\nwith sharp and virulent abuse. Hall and Prynne looked upon all women as\r\nstrumpets who dared to let the hair depart from a straight line\r\nupon their cheeks. The French prettily termed these adornments\r\n_accroche-cœurs_, whilst in the United States they were plainly and\r\nunpleasantly called “spit-curls.” Bartlett says: “Spit-curl, a detached\r\nlock of hair curled upon the temple; probably from having been at first\r\nplastered into shape by the saliva.” It is now understood that the\r\nmucilage of quince seed is used by the ladies for this purpose. When men\r\ntwist the hair on each side of their faces into ropes they are sometimes\r\ncalled “bell-ropes,” as being wherewith to _draw the belles_. Whether\r\nBELL-ROPES or BOW-CATCHERS, it is singular they should form part of a\r\nprisoner’s adornment, and that a jaunty little kiss-curl should, of all\r\nthings in the world, ornament a jail dock; yet such was formerly the\r\ncase. Hunt, “the accomplice after the fact and King’s evidence against”\r\nthe murderer of Weare, on his trial appeared at the bar with a highly\r\npomatumed love-lock sticking tight to his forehead. In the days of the\r\nCivil Wars, the very last thing a Cavalier would part with was his\r\nlove-lock.\r\n\r\n~Bowdlerization~, a term used in literary circles to signify undue\r\nstrictness of treatment caused by over-modesty in editing a classic. To\r\nBOWDLERIZE is to emasculate through squeamishness. From the name\r\n(Bowdler) of one of Shakspeare’s “purifiers.”\r\n\r\n~Bowlas~, round tarts made of sugar, apple, and bread, sold in the\r\nstreets, especially at the East-end of London.\r\n\r\n~Bowles~, shoes.\r\n\r\n~Bowl Out~, to put out of the game, to remove out of one’s way, to\r\ndetect.—Originally a _Cricketing term_, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Box-Harry~, a term with bagmen or commercial travellers, implying\r\ndinner and tea at one meal; also dining with “Duke Humphrey,” _i.e._,\r\ngoing without—which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Box the Compass~, to repeat the thirty-two points of the compass either\r\nin succession or irregularly. The method used at sea to teach boys the\r\npoints of the mariner’s compass.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Boy~, a hump on a man’s back. In low circles it is usual to speak of a\r\nhumpbacked man as two persons—“him and his BOY,” and from this much\r\ncoarse fun and personality are at times evolved.\r\n\r\n~Bracelets~, handcuffs.\r\n\r\n~Brace up~, to pawn stolen goods.\r\n\r\n~Brads~, money. Properly a small kind of nails used by\r\ncobblers.—_Compare_ HORSE NAILS.\r\n\r\n~Brain-Pan~, the skull, and BRAIN-CANISTER, the head. Both pugilistic\r\nand exchangeable terms.\r\n\r\n~Bramble-Gelder~, a derisive appellation for an\r\nagriculturist.—_Suffolk._\r\n\r\n~Brandy Pawnee~, brandy and water.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Brandy Smash~, one of the 365 American drinks, made of brandy and\r\ncrushed ice.\r\n\r\n~Bran-New~, quite new. Properly _Brent_, BRAND or _Fire new_, _i.e._,\r\nfresh from the anvil, or fresh with the manufacturer’s brand upon it.\r\n\r\n~Brass~, money. “Tin” is also used, and so are most forms of metal.\r\n\r\n~Brass~, impudence. In 1803 some artillerymen stationed at Norwich were\r\ndirected to prove some brass ordnance belonging to the city. To the\r\nreport delivered to the corporation was appended this note:—“_N.B._—It\r\nis customary for the corporal to have the old metal when any of the\r\npieces burst.” _Answer._—“The corporation is of opinion that the\r\ncorporal does not want BRASS.”\r\n\r\n~Brass-Knocker~, broken victuals. Used by tramps and cadgers.\r\n\r\n~Brat~, a child of either sex. Generally used in an offensive sense.\r\n\r\n~Brazen-Faced~, impudent, shameless. From BRASS. Such a person is\r\nsometimes said “to have rubbed his face with a brass candlestick.”\r\n\r\n~Brazil~, a hard red wood; “HARD AS BRAZIL,” a common expression.\r\n_Quarles_ in his _Emblems_ says—\r\n\r\n    “Thou know’st my brittle temper’s prone to break.\r\n    Are my bones BRAZIL or my flesh of oak?”\r\n\r\n~Bread-Bags~, a nickname given in the army and navy to any one connected\r\nwith the victualling department, as a purser or purveyor in the\r\nCommissariat.\r\n\r\n~Bread Basket~, DUMPLING-DEPOT, VICTUALLING-OFFICE, &c., were terms\r\nwhich in the old pugilistic days were given by the “Fancy” to the\r\ndigestive organs. Blows in this region were called “porridge\r\ndisturbers,” and other fancy names, which were supposed to rob them of\r\ntheir hardness—to those who did not receive them.\r\n\r\n~Break-Down~, a noisy dance, almost violent enough to break the floor\r\ndown; a jovial, social gathering, a “flare up;” in Ireland, a\r\nwedding—_American_ so far as the dance is concerned.\r\n\r\n~Break One’s Back~, a figurative expression, implying bankruptcy, or the\r\ncrippling of a person’s means.\r\n\r\n    “A story is current of a fashionable author answering a late and\r\n    rather violent knock at his door one evening. A coal-heaver wanted\r\n    to know if the gentleman would like a cheap ton of coals; he was\r\n    sorry for troubling him so late, but ‘the party as had a-ordered the\r\n    two ton and a-half couldn’t be found,’ although he had driven his\r\n    ‘waggon for six blessed hours up and down the neighbourhood.\r\n    Five-and-twenty is the price, but yer shall have them for 20s.’ Our\r\n    author was not to be tempted, he had heard of the trick before; so\r\n    bidding the man go away from his house, he shut the door. The man,\r\n    however, lingered there, expatiating on the quality of his\r\n    coals—‘Acterly givin’ ’em away, and the gent wont have ’em,’ said\r\n    he, addressing the neighbourhood in a loud voice: and the last that\r\n    was heard of him was his anything but sweet voice whistling through\r\n    the keyhole, ‘Will eighteen _bob_ BREAK YER BACK?’”\r\n\r\n~Break Shins~, to borrow money. Probably from an older slang phrase,\r\n“kick,” to ask for drink-money.\r\n\r\n~Break the Ice~, to make a commencement, to plunge _in medias res_.\r\n\r\n~Break Up~, the conclusion of a performance of any kind—originally a\r\nschool term.\r\n\r\n~Breaky-Leg~, strong drink; “he’s been to Bungay fair, and broke both\r\nhis legs,” _i.e._, got drunk. In the ancient Egyptian language the\r\ndeterminative character in the hieroglyphic verb “to be drank,” has the\r\nsignificant form of the leg of a man being amputated. “Tangle Leg” is\r\nthe name given to New England rum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~Breeched~, or TO HAVE THE BAGS OFF, to have plenty of money; “to be\r\nwell BREECHED,” to be in good circumstances. Also among schoolboys to be\r\nwell flogged.\r\n\r\n~Breeches~, “to wear the BREECHES,” said of a wife who usurps the\r\nhusband’s prerogative. Equivalent to the remark that “the grey mare is\r\nthe better horse.”\r\n\r\n~Breeching~, a flogging. Term in use among boys at several private\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n~Breef~, probably identical with BRIEF, a shortened card used for\r\ncheating purposes; thus described in an old book of games of about\r\n1720—\r\n\r\n    “Take a pack of cards and open them, then take out all the honours\r\n    ... and cut a little from the edges of the rest all alike, so as to\r\n    make the honours broader than the rest, so that when your adversary\r\n    cuts to you, you are certain of an honour. When you cut to your\r\n    adversary cut at the ends, and then it is a chance if you cut him an\r\n    honour, because the cards at the ends are all of a length. Thus you\r\n    may make breefs end-ways as well as sideways.”\r\n\r\nModern card-players of a certain kind have considerably improved on\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n~Breeks~, breeches.—_Scotch_, now common.\r\n\r\n~Brick~, a “jolly good fellow;” “a regular BRICK,” a staunch fellow.\r\nAbout the highest compliment that in one word can be paid one man. Said\r\nto be derived from an expression of Aristotle’s—τετραγωνος ἀνηρ.\r\n\r\n~Bridge~, a cheating trick at cards, by which any particular card is cut\r\nby previously curving it by the pressure of the hand. Used in France as\r\nwell as in England, and termed in the _Parisian Argot_ FAIRE LE PONT.\r\n\r\n~Brief~, a pawnbroker’s duplicate; a raffle card, or a ticket of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n~Briefs~, cards constructed on a cheating principle. See BRIDGE,\r\nCONCAVES and CONVEXES, LONGS, and SHORTS, REFLECTORS, &c. From the\r\n_German_, BRIEFE, which Baron Heinecken says was the name given to the\r\ncards manufactured at Ulm. BRIEF is also the synonym for a card in the\r\nGerman _Rothwälsch_ dialect, and BRIEFEN to play at cards. “Item—beware\r\nof the Joners, (gamblers,) who practice Beseflery with the BRIEF,\r\n(cheating at cards,) who deal falsely and cut one for the other, cheat\r\nwith Boglein and spies, pick one BRIEF from the ground, and another from\r\na cupboard,” &c.—_Liber Vagatorum_, ed. by Martin Luther, in 1529.\r\nEnglish translation, by J. C. Hotten, 1860, p. 47. _See_ BREEF.\r\n\r\n~Brim~, a violent irascible woman, as inflammable and unpleasant as\r\nbrimstone, from which the word is contracted.\r\n\r\n~Briney~, the sea. A “dip in the BRINEY” once a year is a great\r\nattraction to Cockney excursionists. A story is told of one excursionist\r\nsaying to another, as they stripped in a double machine, “Why, ’Arry,\r\nwhat dirty feet you’ve got!” “’Ave I; well yer see I wasn’t down last\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\n~Bring-up~, or BRING-TO, to stop suddenly, as a team of horses or a\r\nvessel. To BRING-UP also means to feed, clothe, and educate a child. To\r\nBRING-UP by hand is to bring up a newly-born child or animal without\r\nassistance from the natural fount.\r\n\r\n~Brisket-Beater~, a Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\n~Broad and Shallow~, an epithet applied to the so-called “Broad Church,”\r\nin contradistinction to the “High” and “Low” Churches. _See_ HIGH and\r\nDRY.\r\n\r\n~Broad-Brim~, originally applied to a Quaker only, but now used in\r\nreference to all quiet, sedate, respectable old men.\r\n\r\n~Broad-Cooper~, a person employed by brewers to negotiate with\r\npublicans.\r\n\r\n~Broad-Faking~, playing at cards. Generally used to denote “work” of the\r\nthree-card and kindred descriptions.\r\n\r\n~Broad-Fencer~, a “k’rect card” seller at races.\r\n\r\n~Broads~, cards. BROADSMAN, a card-sharper. _See_ BROAD-FAKING.\r\n\r\n~Broadway Swell~, a New York term for a great dandy, Broadway being the\r\nprincipal promenade in the “Empire City.”\r\n\r\n~Broady~, cloth. Evidently a corruption of broadcloth. BROADY workers\r\nare men who go round selling vile shoddy stuff under the pretence that\r\nit is excellent material, which has been “got on the cross,” _i.e._\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\n~Brolly~, an umbrella. Term used at both Oxford and Cambridge\r\nUniversities.\r\n\r\n~Brosier~, a bankrupt.—_Cheshire._ BROSIER-MY-DAME, school term,\r\nimplying a clearing of the housekeeper’s larder of provisions, in\r\nrevenge for stinginess.—_Eton._\r\n\r\n~Brother-Chip~, originally fellow carpenter. Almost general now as\r\nbrother tradesman of any kind. Also, BROTHER-WHIP, a fellow coachman;\r\nand BROTHER-BLADE, of the same occupation or calling—originally a\r\nfellow-soldier.\r\n\r\n~Brother-Smut~, a term of familiarity. “Ditto, BROTHER SMUT,” _tu\r\nquoque_.\r\n\r\n~Broth of a Boy~, an Irish term for a jolly good fellow.\r\n\r\n~Brown~, a halfpenny.—_See_ BLUNT.\r\n\r\n~Brown~, “to do BROWN,” to do well or completely, “doing it BROWN,”\r\nprolonging the frolic, or exceeding sober bounds; “done BROWN,” taken\r\nin, deceived, or surprised.\r\n\r\n~Brown Bess~, the old Government regulation musket; a musket with a\r\nbrowned barrel; also BLACK BESS. A suggestion has been made that BESS\r\nmay be from the _German_ BUSCHE, or BOSCHE, a barrel. It is much more\r\nlikely, however, that the phrase is derived from the fact that “the\r\nsoldier is wedded to his weapon.”\r\n\r\n~Brown-papermen~, low gamblers.\r\n\r\n~Brown Study~, a reverie. Very common even in educated society, but\r\nhardly admissible in writing, and therefore considered a vulgarism. It\r\nis derived, by a writer in _Notes and Queries_, from BROW STUDY, and he\r\ncites the old German BRAUN, or AUG-BRAUN, an eye-brow.—_Ben Jonson._\r\n\r\n~Brown Talk~, conversation of an exceedingly proper character,\r\nQuakerish. Compare BLUE.\r\n\r\n~Brown to~, to understand, to comprehend.\r\n\r\n~Bruiser~, a fighting man, a pugilist. _Shakspeare_ uses the word\r\nBRUISING in a similar sense.\r\n\r\n~Brum~, a counterfeit coin. _Nearly obsolete._ Corruption of\r\n_Brummagem_, for meaning of which _see_ Introductory Chapter.\r\n\r\n~Brush~, a fox’s tail, a house-painter. Also a scrimmage.\r\n\r\n~Brush~, or BRUSH-OFF, to run away, or move on quickly.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Bub~, drink of any kind.—_See_ GRUB. _Middleton_, the dramatist,\r\nmentions BUBBER, a great drinker.\r\n\r\n~Bub~, a teat, woman’s breast, plural BUBBIES; no doubt from BIBE. _See_\r\n_ante_.\r\n\r\n~Bubble~, to over-reach, deceive, to tempt by means of false\r\npromises.—_Old._ (_Acta Regia_, ii. 248, 1726.)\r\n\r\n~Bubble-and-Squeak~, a dish composed of pieces of cold roast or boiled\r\nmeat and greens, afterwards fried, which have thus first BUBBLED in the\r\n_pot_, and then SQUEAKED or hissed in the _pan_.\r\n\r\n~Bubble-Company~, a swindling association.\r\n\r\n~Buckled~, to be married. Also to be taken in custody. Both uses of the\r\nword common and exchangeable among the London lower classes.\r\n\r\n~Bubbley-Jock~, a turkey, or silly boasting fellow; a prig.—_Scottish._\r\nIn the north of England the bird is called a BOBBLE-COCK. Both names, no\r\ndoubt, from its cry, which is supposed by imaginative persons to consist\r\nof the two words exactly.\r\n\r\n~Buck~, a gay or smart man; an unlicensed cabman; also a large marble\r\nused by schoolboys.\r\n\r\n~Buck~, sixpence. The word is rarely used by itself, but generally\r\ndenotes the sixpence attached to shillings in reference to cost, as,\r\n“three and a BUCK,” three shillings and sixpence. Probably a corruption\r\nof Fyebuck.\r\n\r\n~Buckhorse~, a smart blow or box on the ear; derived from the name of a\r\ncelebrated “bruiser” of that name. Buckhorse was a man who either\r\npossessed or professed insensibility to pain, and who would for a small\r\nsum allow anyone to strike him with the utmost force on the side of the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n~Buckle~, to bend; “I can’t BUCKLE to that.” I don’t understand it; to\r\nyield or give in to a person. _Shakspeare_ uses the word in the latter\r\nsense, _Henry IV._, i. 1; and _Halliwell_ says that “the commentators do\r\nnot supply another example.”\r\n\r\n~Buckle-Beggar~, a COUPLE-BEGGAR, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Buckle-to~, to bend to one’s work, to begin at once, and with great\r\nenergy—from buckling-to one’s armour before a combat, or fastening on a\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n~Buckley~, “Who struck BUCKLEY?” a common phrase used to irritate\r\nIrishmen. The story is that an Englishman having struck an Irishman\r\nnamed Buckley, the latter made a great outcry, and one of his friends\r\nrushed forth screaming, “Who struck Buckley?” “I did,” said the\r\nEnglishman, preparing for the apparently inevitable combat. “Then,” said\r\nthe ferocious Hibernian, after a careful investigation of the other’s\r\nthews and sinews, “then, sarve him right.”\r\n\r\n~Buckra~, a white man. The original of this term is a “flogging man,”\r\nfrom the Hebrew, and the application of it to the whites by the West\r\nIndian negroes is, therefore, rather interesting. They probably first\r\nlearned it from a missionary.\r\n\r\n~Buckshish~, BUCKSHEESH or BACKSHEESH, a present of money. Over all\r\nIndia, and the East generally, the natives lose no opportunity of asking\r\nfor BUCKSHISH. The usage is such a complete nuisance that the word is\r\nsometimes answered by a blow; this is termed BAMBOO BUCKSHISH. BUCKSHISH\r\nhas taken up a very firm residence in Europe—may, in fact, on a much\r\nlarger scale than that of Asia, be said to have always had an existence\r\nhere. BUCKSHISH is a very important item in the revenues of officials\r\nwho hold positions of considerable importance, as well as in those of\r\ntheir humbler brethren. During the recent visit of the Shah of Persia,\r\nthat potentate discovered that BUCKSHISH was by no means peculiar to the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n~Budge~, to move, to “make tracks.”\r\n\r\n~Budge~, strong drink; BUDGY, drunk; BUDGING-KEN, a public-house; “cove\r\nof the BUDGING-KEN,” the landlord. Probably a corruption of BOOZE.\r\nProbably also, on the lucus a non lucendo principle, because its use\r\nmade one incapable of budging.\r\n\r\n~Buff~, the bare skin; “stripped to the BUFF.”\r\n\r\n~Buff~, to swear to, or accuse; generally used in reference to a\r\nwrongful accusation, as, “Oh, BUFF it on to him.” _Old_ word for\r\nboasting, 1582.\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a navy term for a boatswain’s mate, one of whose duties it\r\nis—or was—to administer the “cat.”\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a familiar expression for a jolly acquaintance, probably from\r\nthe _French_ BOUFFARD, a fool or clown; a “jolly old BUFFER,” said of a\r\ngood-humoured or liberal old man. In 1737, a BUFFER was a “rogue that\r\nkilled good sound horses for the sake of their skins, by running a long\r\nwire into them.”—_Bacchus and Venus._ The term was once applied to\r\nthose who took false oaths for a consideration; but though the word has\r\nfallen into disuse there is no particular reason for imagining that the\r\npractice has.\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a woman employed in a Sheffield warehouse to give the final\r\npolish to goods previously to their being plated.\r\n\r\n~Buffer~, a dog. Dogs’ skins were formerly in great request—hence the\r\nterm BUFF, meaning in old English _to skin_. It is still used in the\r\nring, BUFFED meaning stripped naked, though the term BUFF, as applied to\r\nthe skin, is most likely due to its resemblance to the leather so\r\ncalled. “Stripped to the BUFF,” cannot have any reference to dog\r\nskinning, though it may have originally referred to the BUFF jerkins\r\nworn under defensive armour. In Irish cant, BUFFER is a _boxer_. The\r\nBUFFER of a railway-carriage doubtless received its very appropriate\r\nname from the old pugilistic application of this term.\r\n\r\n~Buffle-Head~, a stupid or obtuse person.—_Miege._ _German_,\r\nBUFFELHAUPT, buffalo-headed. Occurs in _Plautus’ Comedies made English_,\r\n1694.\r\n\r\n~Buffs~, the Third Regiment of Foot in the British army. From their\r\nfacings.\r\n\r\n~Buffy~, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~Buggy~, a gig, or light chaise. Common term in America and in India, as\r\nwell as in England.\r\n\r\n~Bug-Hunter~, a low wretch who plunders drunken men.\r\n\r\n~Bug-Walk~, a coarse term for a bed.\r\n\r\n~Build~, applied in fashionable slang to the make or style of dress, &c.\r\n“It’s a tidy BUILD, who made it?” A tailor is sometimes called a\r\n“trousers’ BUILDER.”\r\n\r\n~Bulger~, large; synonymous with BUSTER.\r\n\r\n~Bulky~, a constable.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Bull~, one who agrees to purchase stock at a future day, at a stated\r\nprice, but who simply speculates for a rise in public securities to\r\nrender the transaction a profitable one. Should stocks fall, the BULL is\r\nthen called upon to pay the difference. _See_ BEAR, who is the opposite\r\nof a BULL, the former selling, the latter purchasing—the one operating\r\nfor a _fall_, the other for a _rise_.\r\n\r\n~Bull~, a crown-piece, formerly BULL’S EYE. _See_ WORK.\r\n\r\n~Bull~, term amongst prisoners for the meat served to them in jail. Also\r\nvery frequently used instead of the word beef. The costermonger often\r\nspeaks of his dinner, when he has beef, as a “bit o’ BULL,” without any\r\nreference to its being either tough or tender, but he never speaks of\r\nmutton as “sheep.”\r\n\r\n~Bull-Beef~, a term of contempt; “as ugly as BULL-BEEF,” “go to the\r\nbilly-fencer, and sell yourself for BULL-BEEF.” Sometimes used to\r\nindicate full size of anything. “There was he, as big as BULL-BEEF.”\r\n\r\n~Bulldogs~, the runners who accompany the proctor in his perambulations,\r\nand give chase to runaways.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Bullet~, to discharge from a situation. To shake the BULLET at anyone,\r\nis to threaten him with “the sack,” but not to give him actual notice to\r\nleave. To get the BULLET is to get notice, while to get the instant\r\nBULLET is to be discharged upon the spot. The use of the term is most\r\nprobably derived from a fancied connexion between it and the word\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n~Bullfinch~, a hunting term for a large, thick, quickset hedge,\r\ndifficult alike to “top” or burst through. Probably a corruption of\r\nBULL-FENCE, a fence made to prevent cattle straying either in or out.\r\n\r\n~Bull the Cask~, to pour hot water into an empty rum puncheon, and let\r\nit stand until it extracts the spirit from the wood. The mixture is\r\ndrunk by sailors in default of something stronger.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Bully~, a braggart; in the language of the streets, a man of the most\r\ndegraded morals, who protects fallen females, and lives off their\r\nmiserable earnings.—_Shakspeare_, in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_, uses\r\nthe word in its old form, as a term of endearment. This epithet is often\r\napplied in a commendable sense among the vulgar; thus—a good fellow or\r\na good horse will be termed “a BULLY fellow,” “a BULLY horse;” and “a\r\nBULLY woman” signifies a right, good motherly old soul. Among Americans,\r\n“BULLY for you,” is a commendatory phrase, and “that’s BULLY” is a\r\nhighly eulogistic term.\r\n\r\n~Bullyrag~, to abuse or scold vehemently; to swindle one out of money by\r\nintimidation and sheer abuse.\r\n\r\n~Bum~, the part on which we sit.—_Shakspeare._ BUMBAGS, trousers;\r\n_Gael._ BUN, a base or bottom; _Welsh_, BON, the lowest or worst part of\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n~Bum-Bailiff~, a sheriff’s-officer—a term, some say, derived from the\r\nproximity which this gentleman generally maintains to his victims.\r\nBlackstone says it is a corruption of “bound bailiff.” A BUM-BAILIFF was\r\ngenerally called “bummy.”\r\n\r\n~Bumble~, to muffle. BUMBLE-FOOTED, club-footed, or awkward in the gait.\r\n\r\n~Bumble~, a beadle. Adopted from _Dickens’s_ character in _Oliver\r\nTwist_. This and “BUMBLEDOM” are now common.\r\n\r\n~Bumble-Puppy~, a game played in public-houses on a large stone, placed\r\nin a slanting direction, on the lower end of which holes are excavated,\r\nand numbered like the holes in a bagatelle-table. The player rolls a\r\nstone ball, or marble, from the higher end, and according to the number\r\nof the hole it falls into the game is counted. It is undoubtedly the\r\nvery ancient game of _Troule-in-madame_.\r\n\r\n~Bumbles~, coverings for the eyes of horses that shy in harness.\r\n\r\n~Bumbrusher~, an usher at a school.\r\n\r\n~Bumclink~, in the Midland counties the inferior beer brewed for\r\nhaymakers and harvest labourers. Derivation obvious.\r\n\r\n~Bum-Curtain~, an old name for academical gowns when they were worn\r\nscant and short, especially those of the students of St. John’s\r\nCollege.—_Camb. Univ._ Any ragged or short academical gown.\r\n\r\n~Bummarees~, a term given to a class of speculating salesmen at\r\nBillingsgate market, not recognised as such by the trade, but who get a\r\nliving by buying large quantities of fish from the salesmen and\r\nre-selling them to smaller buyers. The word has been used in the\r\nstatutes and bye-laws of the market for upwards of 200 years. It has\r\nbeen variously derived. Some persons think it may be from the _French_\r\nBONNE MARÉE, good fresh fish! “Marée signifie toute sorte de poisson de\r\nmer qui n’est pas sale; bonne marée—_marée fraîche_, vendeur de\r\nmarée.”—_Dict. de l’Acad. Franc._ The BUMMAREES are accused of many\r\ntrade tricks. One of them is to blow up codfish with a pipe until they\r\nlook double their actual size. Of course when the fish come to table\r\nthey are flabby, sunken, and half dwindled away. In Norwich, to BUMMAREE\r\none is to run up a score at a public-house just open, and is equivalent\r\nto “running into debt with one.” One of the advertisements issued by Hy.\r\nRobinson’s “Office,” over against Threadneedle Street, was this:—\r\n\r\n    “Touching Advice from the OFFICE, you are desired to give and take\r\n    notice as followeth:—\r\n\r\n    “OF Monies to be taken up, or delivered on _Botto-maria_, commonly\r\n    called _Bomarie_.\r\n\r\n    “OF money to be put out or taken upon interest,” &c.\r\n\r\n    —_The Publick Intelligencer_, numb. 17, 25th June, 1660.\r\n\r\n~Bummer~, literally one who sits or idles about; a loafer; one who\r\nsponges upon his acquaintances. In California, men who profess to be\r\njournalists, and so obtain free dinners and drinks, are called “literary\r\nBUMMERS.” Although the term is not much in use in this country, the\r\nprofession of bumming, both literary and otherwise, is freely practised.\r\n\r\n~Bumper~, according to Johnson from “bump,” but probably from _French_\r\nBON PÈRE, the fixed toast in monastic life of old, now used for “full\r\nmeasure.” A match at quoits, bowls, &c., may end in a “BUMPER game,” if\r\nthe play and score be all on one side. BUMPER is used in sporting and\r\ntheatrical circles to denote a benefit which is one in reality as well\r\nas in name.\r\n\r\n~Bumptious~, arrogant, self-sufficient. One on very good terms with\r\nhimself is said to be BUMPTIOUS.\r\n\r\n~Bunce~, costermongers’ perquisites; the money obtained by giving light\r\nweight, &c.; costermongers’ goods sold by boys on commission. In fact\r\nanything which is clear profit or gain is said to be “all BUNCE.”\r\nProbably a corruption of _bonus_; BONE, or BONER, being the slang for\r\ngood. BUNCE, _Grose_ gives as the cant word for money.\r\n\r\n~Bunch-of-Fives~, the hand, or fist.\r\n\r\n~Bundle~, “to BUNDLE a person off,” _i.e._, to pack him off, send him\r\nflying.\r\n\r\n~Bundling~, men and women sleeping together, where the divisions of the\r\nhouse will not permit of better or more decent accommodation, with all\r\ntheir clothes on. BUNDLING was originally courting done in bed, the\r\nlovers being tied or bundled up to prevent undue familiarities. The\r\npractice still obtains in some parts of Wales.\r\n\r\n~Bung~, the landlord of a public-house. Much in use among sporting men.\r\n\r\n~Bung~, to give, pass, hand over, drink, or to perform almost any\r\naction. BUNG up, to close up, as the eyes.—_Pugilistic._ “BUNG over the\r\nrag,” hand over the money.—_Old_, used by _Beaumont_ and _Fletcher_,\r\nand _Shakspeare_. Also, to deceive one by a lie, to CRAM, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Bunk~, to decamp. “BUNK it!” _i.e._, be off.\r\n\r\n~Bunker~, beer.\r\n\r\n~Bunkum~, an American importation, denoting false sentiments in\r\nspeaking, pretended enthusiasm, &c. The expression arose from a speech\r\nmade by a North Carolina senator named Buncombe.\r\n\r\n~Bunter~, a prostitute, a street-walking female thief.\r\n\r\n~Burdon’s Hotel~, Whitecross Street Prison, of which the Governor was a\r\nMr. Burdon. Almost every prison has a nickname of this kind, either from\r\nthe name of the Governor, or from some local circumstance. The Queen’s\r\nBench has also an immense number of names—SPIKE PARK, &c.; and every\r\nChief-Justice stands godfather to it.\r\n\r\n~Burerk~, a lady, a showily-dressed woman.\r\n\r\n~Burke~, to kill, to murder, secretly and without noise, by means of\r\nstrangulation. From Burke, the notorious Edinburgh murderer, who, with\r\nan accomplice named Hare, used to decoy people into the den he\r\ninhabited, kill them, and sell their bodies for dissection. The wretches\r\nhaving been apprehended and tried, Burke was executed, while Hare,\r\nhaving turned king’s evidence, was released. Bishop and Williams were\r\ntheir London imitators. The term BURKE is now usually applied to any\r\nproject that is quietly stopped or stifled—as “the question has been\r\nBURKED.” A book suppressed before publication is said to be BURKED.\r\n\r\n~Burra~, great; as BURRA SAIB, a great man; BURRA KHANAII, a great\r\ndinner.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Bury a Moll~, to run away from a mistress.\r\n\r\n~Bus~, or BUSS, an abbreviation of “omnibus,” a public carriage. Also, a\r\nkiss, abbreviation of _Fr._ BAISER. A Mr. Shillibeer started the first\r\nBUS in London. A shillibeer is now a hearse and mourning coach all in\r\none, used by the very poorest mourners and shabbiest undertakers.\r\n\r\n    Why is Temple Bar like a lady’s veil? Because it wants to be removed\r\n    to make way for the BUSSES.\r\n\r\n~Bus~, business (of which it is a contraction) or action on the stage,\r\nso written, but pronounced BIZ.—_Theatrical._ _See_ BIZ.\r\n\r\n~Business~, the action which accompanies dialogue. “His BUSINESS was\r\ngood.” Generally applied to byplay.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Busk~, to sell obscene songs and books at the bars and in the tap-rooms\r\nof public-houses. Sometimes it implies selling other articles. Also to\r\n“work” public-houses and certain spots as an itinerant musician or\r\nvocalist.\r\n\r\n~Busker~, a man who sings or performs in a public-house; an itinerant.\r\n\r\n~Bust~, or BURST, to tell tales, to SPLIT, to inform. BUSTING, informing\r\nagainst accomplices when in custody.\r\n\r\n~Buster~ (BURSTER), a small new loaf; “twopenny BUSTER,” a twopenny\r\nloaf. “A penn’orth o’ BEES-WAX (cheese) and a penny BUSTER,” a common\r\nsnack at beershops. A halfpenny loaf is called a “starver.”\r\n\r\n~Buster~, an extra size; “what a BUSTER,” _i.e._, what a large one; “in\r\nfor a BUSTER,” determined on an extensive frolic or spree. _Scotch_,\r\nBUSTUOUS; _Icelandic_, BOSTRA.\r\n\r\n~Bustle~, money; “to draw the BUSTLE.”\r\n\r\n~Busy-Sack~, a carpet-bag.\r\n\r\n~Butcha~, a Hindoo word in use among Englishmen for the young of any\r\nanimal. In England we ask after the children; in India the health of the\r\nBUTCHAS is tenderly inquired for.\r\n\r\n~Butcher~, the king in playing-cards. When card-playing in public houses\r\nwas common, the kings were called butchers, the queens bitches, and the\r\nknaves jacks. The latter term is now in general use.\r\n\r\n~Butcher’s Mourning~, a white hat with a black mourning hatband.\r\nProbably because, under any circumstances, a butcher would rather not\r\nwear a black hat. White hats and black bands have, however, become\r\ngenteel ever since the late Prince Consort patronized them, though they\r\nretain a deal of the old sporting leaven.\r\n\r\n~Butter~, or BATTER, praise or flattery. To BUTTER, to flatter, cajole.\r\nSame as “soft soap” and “soft sawder.” Soft words generally. Maybe from\r\nthe old proverb, “Fine words butter no parsneps.”\r\n\r\n~Butter-Fingered~, apt to let things fall; greasy or slippery-fingered.\r\n\r\n~Button~, a decoy, sham purchaser, &c. At any mock or sham auction seedy\r\nspecimens may be seen. Probably from the connexion of buttons with\r\nBrummagem, which is often used as a synonym for a sham.—_See_ BONNET.\r\n\r\n~Buttoner~, a man who entices another to play.\r\n\r\n~Buttons~, a page,—from the rows of gilt buttons which adorn his\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n~Buttons~, “not to have all one’s BUTTONS;” to be deficient in\r\nintellect. To “make BUTTONS” means for some occult reason to look sorry\r\nand sad. “He was making BUTTONS,” _i.e._, he was looking sorrowful.\r\nPerhaps because button-making is a sorry occupation.\r\n\r\n~Butty~, a word used in the mining districts to denote a kind of\r\noverseer. Also used by the Royal Marines in the sense of comrade; a\r\npoliceman’s assistant, one of the staff in a _mêlée_.\r\n\r\n~Buz~, to share equally the last of a bottle of wine, when there is not\r\nenough for a full glass to each of the party.\r\n\r\n~Buz~, a well-known public-house game, played as follows:—“The chairman\r\ncommences saying “one,” the next on the left hand “two,” the next\r\n“three,” and so on to _seven_, when “BUZ” must be said. Every seven and\r\nmultiple of 7, as 14, 17, 21, 27, 28, &c., must not be mentioned, but\r\n“BUZ” instead. Whoever breaks the rule pays a fine, which is thrown on\r\nthe table, and the accumulation expended in drink for the company. _See_\r\n“SNOOKS and WALKER” for more complicated varieties of a similar game.\r\nThese “parlour pastimes” are often not only funny, but positively\r\ningenious. But the Licensing Act and a zealous police are fast clearing\r\nthem all out.\r\n\r\n~Buz~, to pick pockets; BUZZING or BUZ-FAKING, robbing.\r\n\r\n~Buz-Bloke~, a pickpocket who principally confines his attention to\r\npurses and loose cash. _Grose_ gives BUZ-GLOAK, an ancient cant word.\r\nGLOAK was old cant for a man. BUZ-NAPPER, a young pickpocket.\r\n\r\n~Buz-man~, an informer; from BUZ, to whisper, but more generally a\r\nthief.\r\n\r\n~Buz-napper’s Academy~, a school in which young thieves were trained.\r\nFigures were dressed up, and experienced tutors stood in various\r\ndifficult attitudes for the boys to practise upon. When clever enough\r\nthey were sent on the streets. Dickens gives full particulars of this\r\nold style of business in _Oliver Twist_.\r\n\r\n~Buzzer~, a pickpocket. _Grose_ gives BUZ-COVE and, as above mentioned,\r\nBUZ-GLOAK.\r\n\r\n~Byblow~, an illegitimate child.\r\n\r\n~By George~, an exclamation similar to BY JOVE. The term is older than\r\nis frequently imagined—vide _Bacchus and Venus_ (p. 117), 1737. “’Fore\r\n(or by) GEORGE, I’d knock him down.” Originally in reference to Saint\r\nGeorge, the patron saint of England, or possibly to the House of\r\nHanover.\r\n\r\n~By Golly~, an ejaculation, or oath; a compromise for “by God.” BY GUM\r\nis another oblique oath. In the United States, small boys are permitted\r\nby their guardians to say GOL DARN anything, but they are on no account\r\nallowed to commit the profanity of G--d d----n anything. A manner of\r\n“sailing close to the wind” which is objectionable to the honest mind. A\r\nspecimen ejaculation and moral waste-pipe for interior passion or wrath\r\nis seen in the exclamation—BY THE EVER-LIVING JUMPING-MOSES—a harmless\r\nand ridiculous phrase, that from its length is supposed to expend a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fiery anger.\r\n\r\n~By Jingo~, an oath or exclamation having no particular meaning, and no\r\npositive etymology, though it is believed by some that JINGO is derived\r\nfrom the Basque _jenco_, the devil.\r\n\r\n~Cab~, in statutory language, “a hackney carriage drawn by one horse.”\r\nAbbreviated from the _French_ CABRIOLET; originally meaning “a light low\r\nchaise.” The wags of Paris playing upon the word (quasi _cabri_ au lait)\r\nused to call a superior turn-out of the kind a _cabri au crême_. Our\r\nabbreviation, which certainly smacks of slang, has been stamped with the\r\nauthority of the Legislature, and has been honoured by universal custom.\r\n\r\n~Cab~, to stick together, to muck, or tumble up.—_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Cabbage~, pieces of cloth said to be purloined by tailors. Any small\r\nprofits in the way of material.\r\n\r\n~Cabbage~, to pilfer or purloin. Termed by _Johnson_ a “cant word,” but\r\nadopted by later lexicographers as a respectable term. Said to have been\r\nfirst used in the above sense by _Arbuthnot_.\r\n\r\n~Cabbage-Head~, a soft-headed person.\r\n\r\n~Cabby~, popular name for the driver of a cab. This title has almost\r\nsupplanted the more ancient one of jarvey.\r\n\r\n~Caboose~, the galley or cook-house of a ship; a term used by tramps to\r\nindicate a kitchen.\r\n\r\n~Cackle-Tub~, a pulpit.\r\n\r\n~Cackling-Cove~, an actor. Also called a MUMMERY-COVE.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Cad~, or CADGER (from which it is shortened), a mean or vulgar fellow;\r\na beggar; one who would rather live on other people than work for\r\nhimself; a man who tries to worm something out of another, either money\r\nor information. _Johnson_ uses the word, and gives _huckster_ as the\r\nmeaning, in which sense it was originally used. Apparently from CAGER,\r\nor GAGER, the _old Cant_ term for a man. The exclusives at the English\r\nUniversities apply the term CAD to all non-members. It has also been\r\nsuggested that the word may be a contraction of the _French_ CADET.\r\n\r\n~Cad~, an omnibus conductor. Of late years the term has been generically\r\napplied to the objectionable class immortalized by Thackeray under the\r\ntitle of snob. A great deal of caddism is, however, perpetrated by those\r\nwho profess to have the greatest horror of it—the upper classes—a fact\r\nwhich goes far to prove that it is impossible to fairly ascribe a\r\ndistinctive feature to any grade of society.\r\n\r\n~Cadge~, to beg in an artful, wheedling manner.—_North._ In Scotland to\r\nCADGE is to wander, to go astray. _See_ under CODGER.\r\n\r\n~Cadging~, begging, generally with an eye to pilfering when an\r\nopportunity occurs. To be “on the cadge” is almost synonymous with “on\r\nthe make.”\r\n\r\n~Cag~, to irritate, affront, anger. Schoolboy slang.\r\n\r\n~Cage~, a minor kind of prison. A country lock-up which contained no\r\noffices.\r\n\r\n~Cagmag~, bad food, scraps, odds and ends; or that which no one could\r\nrelish. _Grose_ give CAGG MAGGS, old and tough Lincolnshire geese, sent\r\nto London to feast the poor cockneys. _Gael._, _French_, and _Welsh_,\r\nCAC, and MAGN. A correspondent at Trinity College, Dublin, considers\r\nthis as originally a University slang term for a _bad cook_, κακὸς\r\nμάγειρος. There is also a _Latin_ word used by Pliny, MAGMA, denoting\r\ndregs or dross.\r\n\r\n~Cake~, a “flat;” a soft or doughy person, a fool.\r\n\r\n~Cakey-Pannum-Fencer~, or PANNUM-FENCER, a man who sells street pastry.\r\n\r\n~Calaboose~, a prison.—_Sea_ slang, from the Spanish.\r\n\r\n~Calculate~, a word much in use among the inhabitants of the Western\r\nStates U.S., as “I CALCULATE you are a stranger here.” New Englanders\r\nuse the word “guess” instead of CALCULATE, while the Virginians prefer\r\nto say “reckon.”\r\n\r\n~Caleb Quotem~, a parish clerk; a jack of all trades. From a character\r\nin _The Wags of Windsor_.\r\n\r\n~California~, or CALIFORNIANS, money. Term generally applied to gold\r\nonly. Derivation very obvious.\r\n\r\n~Call~, a notice of rehearsal, or any other occasion requiring the\r\ncompany’s presence, posted up in a theatre. “We’re CALLED for eleven\r\nto-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n~Call-a-Go~, in street “patter,” is to leave off trying to sell anything\r\nand to remove to another spot, to desist. Also to give in, yield, at any\r\ngame or business. Probably from the “GO” call in cribbage.\r\n\r\n~Cameronians~, THE, the Twenty-sixth Regiment of Foot in the British\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n~Camesa~, shirt or chemise.—_Span._ _See_ its abbreviated form, MISH,\r\nfrom the _ancient Cant_, COMMISSION. Probably re-introduced by the\r\nremains of De Lacy Evans’s Spanish Legion on their return. _See_\r\nSomerville’s account of the Span. Leg., for the curious facility with\r\nwhich the lower classes in England adopt foreign words as slang and cant\r\nterms. _Italian_, CAMICIA. This latter is the more likely etymology, as\r\nanyone who visits the various quarters where Irish, Italians, and a\r\nmongrel mixture of half-a-dozen races congregate and pig together, will\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\n~Camister~, a preacher, clergyman, or master.\r\n\r\n~Canary~, a sovereign. From the colour. Very old slang indeed.\r\n\r\n~Canister~, the head.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Canister-Cap~, a hat.\r\n\r\n~Cannibals~, the training boats for the Cambridge freshmen, _i.e._,\r\n“CANNOT-PULLS.” The term is applied both to boats and rowers.—_See_\r\nSLOGGERS. Torpids is the usual term for the races in which these men and\r\nmachines figure.\r\n\r\n~Cannikin~, a small can, similar to PANNIKIN. “And let the CANNIKIN\r\nclink.”\r\n\r\n~Cant~, a blow or toss; “a CANT over the kisser,” a blow on the mouth;\r\n“a CANT over the buttock,” a throw or toss in wrestling.\r\n\r\n~Cantab~, a student at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n~Cantankerous~, litigious, bad-tempered. An American corruption probably\r\nof contentious. A reviewer of an early edition of this book derives it\r\nfrom the _Anglo-Norman_ CONTEK, litigation or strife. Others have\r\nsuggested “cankerous” as the origin. _Bailey_ has CONTEKE, contention as\r\na Spenserian word, and there is the _O.E._ CONTEKORS, quarrelsome\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n~Cant of Togs~, a gift of clothes.\r\n\r\n~Canvasseens~, sailors’ canvas trousers.\r\n\r\n~Cap~, a false cover to a tossing coin. The term and the instrument are\r\nboth nearly obsolete. _See_ COVER-DOWN.\r\n\r\n~Cap~, “to set her CAP.” A woman is said to set her CAP at a man when\r\nshe makes overt love to him.\r\n\r\n~Cap~, to outdo or add to, as in capping jokes.\r\n\r\n~Cape Cod Turkey~, salt fish.\r\n\r\n~Caper-Merchant~, a dancing-master. Sometimes a hop-merchant.\r\n\r\n~Capers~, dancing, frolicking; “to cut CAPER-SAUCE,” _i.e._, to dance\r\nupon nothing—be hanged. Old thieves’ talk.\r\n\r\n~Capper-Clawing~, female encounter, where caps are torn and nails freely\r\nused. Sometimes it is pronounced CLAPPER-CLAW. The word occurs in\r\n_Shakspeare_, _Troilus and Cressida_, act v. sc. 4.\r\n\r\n~Caravan~, a railway train, especially a train expressly chartered to\r\nconvey people to a prize fight.\r\n\r\n~Caravansera~, a railway station. In pugilistic phraseology a tip for\r\nthe starting point might have been given thus. “The SCRATCH must be TOED\r\nat sharp five, so the CARAVAN will start at four from the CARAVANSERA.”\r\n\r\n~Carboy~, a general term in most parts of the world for a very large\r\nglass or earthenware bottle.\r\n\r\n~Card~, a character. “A queer CARD,” _i.e._, an odd fish.\r\n\r\n~Cardinal~, a lady’s red cloak. A cloak with this name was in fashion in\r\nthe year 1760. It received its title from its similarity in shape to one\r\nof the vestments of a cardinal. Also mulled red wine.\r\n\r\n~Cardwell’s Men~, officers promoted in pursuance of the new system of\r\nnon-purchase.\r\n\r\n~Carney~, soft hypocritical language. Also, to flatter, wheedle, or\r\ninsinuate oneself.—_Prov._\r\n\r\n~Carnish~, meat, from the _Ital._ CARNE, flesh; a _Lingua Franca_\r\nimportation; CARNISH-KEN, a thieves’ eating-house; “cove of the\r\nCARNISH-KEN,” the keeper thereof.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Caroon~, five shillings. _French_, COURONNE; _Gipsy_, COURNA;\r\n_Spanish_, CORONA.\r\n\r\n~Carpet~, “upon the CARPET,” any subject or matter that is uppermost for\r\ndiscussion or conversation. Frequently quoted as _sur le tapis_, or more\r\ngenerally “on the _tapis_,” but it does not seem to be at all known in\r\nFrance. Also servants’ slang. When a domestic is summoned by the master\r\nor mistress to receive a warning or reprimand, he or she is said to be\r\nCARPETED. The corresponding term in commercial establishments is a\r\nWIGGING.\r\n\r\n~Carpet-Knight~, an habitué of drawing-rooms, a “ladies’ man.”\r\n\r\n~Carrier-Pigeon~, a swindler, one who formerly used to cheat\r\nlottery-office keepers. Now used among betting men to describe one who\r\nruns from place to place with “commissions.”\r\n\r\n~Carriwitchet~, a hoaxing, puzzling question, not admitting of a\r\nsatisfactory answer, as—“How far is it from the first of July to London\r\nBridge?” “If a bushel of apples cost ten shillings, how long will it\r\ntake for an oyster to eat its way through a barrel of soap?”\r\n\r\n~Carrot.~ “Take a CARROT!” a vulgar insulting phrase.\r\n\r\n~Carrots~, the coarse and satirical term for red hair. An epigram gives\r\nan illustration of the use of this term:—\r\n\r\n    “Why scorn red hair? The Greeks, we know,\r\n      (I note it here in charity)\r\n    Had taste in beauty, and with them\r\n      The graces were all Χάριται!”\r\n\r\nOf late years CARROTY hair in all its shades has been voted beautiful,\r\n_i.e._, fashionable.\r\n\r\n~Carry Corn~, to bear success well and equally. It is said of a man who\r\nbreaks down under a sudden access of wealth—as successful horse-racing\r\nmen and unexpected legatees often do—or who becomes affected and\r\nintolerant, that “he doesn’t CARRY CORN well.”\r\n\r\n~Carry me Out!~ an exclamation of pretended astonishment on hearing news\r\ntoo good to be true, or a story too marvellous to be believed. Sometimes\r\nvaried by “Let me die,” _i.e._, I can’t survive that. Profanely derived\r\nfrom the _Nunc dimittis_ (Luke xi. 29). The Irish say, “CARRY ME OUT,\r\nand bury me decently.”\r\n\r\n~Carry-on~, to joke a person to excess, to CARRY ON a “spree” too far;\r\n“how we CARRIED ON, to be sure!” _i.e._, what fun we had. _Nautical\r\nterm_—from carrying on sail.\r\n\r\n~Carts~, a pair of shoes. In Norfolk the carapace of a crab is called a\r\n_crab cart_; hence CARTS would be synonymous with CRAB SHELLS, which\r\n_see_.\r\n\r\n~Cart-wheel~, a five-shilling piece. Generally condensed to “WHEEL.”\r\n\r\n~Ca-sa~, a writ of _capias ad satisfaciendam_.—_Legal slang._\r\n\r\n~Casa~, or CASE, a house, respectable or otherwise. Probably from the\r\nItalian CASA.—_Old Cant._ The Dutch use the word KAST in a vulgar sense\r\nfor a house, _i.e._, MOTTEKAST, a brothel. CASE sometimes means a\r\nwater-closet, but is in general applied to a “house of accommodation.”\r\nCASA is generally pronounced _carzey_.\r\n\r\n~Cascade~, to vomit.\r\n\r\n~Case.~ Some years ago the term CASE was applied generally to persons or\r\nthings; “what a CASE he is,” _i.e._, what a curious person; “a rum CASE\r\nthat,” or “you are a CASE,” both synonymous with the phrase “odd fish,”\r\ncommon half a century ago. This would seem to have been originally a\r\n“case” for the police-court; drunkenness, &c. Among young ladies at\r\nboarding-schools a CASE means a love-affair. CASE now means any\r\nunfortunate matter. “I’m afraid it’s a CASE with him.”\r\n\r\n~Case~, a bad crown-piece. HALF-A-CASE, a counterfeit half-crown. There\r\nare two sources, either of which may have contributed this slang term.\r\nCASER is the Hebrew word for a crown; and silver coin is frequently\r\ncounterfeited by coating or CASING pewter or iron imitations with\r\nsilver. Possibly from its being “a CASE” with the unfortunate owner.\r\n\r\n~Cask~, fashionable slang for a brougham, or other private carriage. Not\r\nvery general. “PILLBOX” is the more usual term.\r\n\r\n~Cassam~, cheese—not CAFFAN, which Egan, in his edition of _Grose_, has\r\nridiculously inserted.—_Ancient Cant._ _Latin_, CASEUS. _Gael._ and\r\n_Irish_, CAISE.\r\n\r\n~Cast~, to assist by lightening labour. Men in small boats who want to\r\nbe towed behind steamers or sailing vessels, say “Give us a CAST.” Also\r\nused by waggoners and others, who sometimes vary the performance by\r\nasking, when stuck on a hill, for a pound, possibly a pound of flesh,\r\nhorse or human.\r\n\r\n~Cast up Accounts~, to vomit.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Castor~, a hat. Mostly used in pugilistic circles. Indeed many\r\nhangers-on of the P.R. have considered that the term arose from the\r\ncustom of casting the hat into the ring, before entering oneself. CASTOR\r\nwas the _Latin_ name for the animal now known as the BEAVER; and,\r\nstrange to add, BEAVER was the slang for CASTOR, or hat, many years ago,\r\nbefore gossamer came into fashion.\r\n\r\n~Cat~, a lady’s muff; “to free a CAT,” _i.e._, steal a muff.\r\n\r\n~Cat~, to vomit like a cat. Perhaps from CATARACT; but _see_ SHOOT THE\r\nCAT.\r\n\r\n~Cat~—CAT O’ NINE TAILS, a whip with that number of lashes used to\r\npunish refractory sailors.—_Sea._ The “cat” is now a recognised term\r\nfor the punishmental whip.\r\n\r\n~Catamaran~, a disagreeable old woman.—_Thackeray._\r\n\r\n~Cat and Kitten Sneaking~, stealing pint and quart pots and small pewter\r\nspirit measures from public-houses.\r\n\r\n~Cataract~, once a black satin scarf arranged for the display of\r\njewellery, much in vogue among “commercial gents.” Now quite out of\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n~Catchbet~, a bet made for the purpose of entrapping the unwary by means\r\nof a paltry subterfuge. _See_ CHERRY COLOUR.\r\n\r\n~Catch-’em-Alive~, a humane trap; also a small-tooth comb. A piece of\r\npaper smeared with a sweet sticky substance which is spread about where\r\nflies most abound, and in this sense not particularly humane. The\r\nCATCH-’EM-ALIVE trap for rats and other such animals is humane compared\r\nwith the gin trap.\r\n\r\n~Catch-penny~, any temporary contrivance to obtain money from the\r\npublic; penny shows, or cheap exhibitions. Also descriptions of murders\r\nwhich have never taken place.\r\n\r\n~Catchy~ (similar formation to _touchy_), inclined to take an undue\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n~Caterwauling~, applied derisively to inharmonious singing; also\r\nlove-making, from the noise of cats similarly engaged.\r\n\r\n~Catever~, a queer, or singular affair; anything poor, or very bad. From\r\nthe _Lingua Franca_, and _Italian_, CATTIVO, bad. Variously spelled by\r\nthe lower orders.—_See_ KERTEVER.\r\n\r\n~Cat-faced~, a vulgar and very common expression of contempt in the\r\nNorth of England.\r\n\r\n~Catgut-Scraper~, a fiddler.\r\n\r\n~Cat-in-the-Pan~, a traitor, a turncoat—derived by some from the\r\n_Greek_, καταπαν, altogether; or—and more likely—from _cake in pan_, a\r\npan-cake, which is frequently turned from side to side.\r\n\r\n~Cat-lap~, a contemptuous expression for weak drink. Anything a cat will\r\ndrink is very innocuous.\r\n\r\n~Cats and Dogs.~ It is said to rain cats and dogs when a shower is\r\nexceptionally heavy. Probably in ridicule of the remarkable showers\r\nwhich used to find their way into the papers during the “silly season.”\r\n\r\n~Cat’s-meat~, a coarse term for the lungs—the “lights” or lungs of\r\nanimals being usually sold to feed cats.\r\n\r\n~Cat’s-paw~, a dupe or tool. From the old story of the monkey who used\r\nthe cat’s-paw to remove his roast chestnuts from the fire. A sea term,\r\nmeaning light and occasional breezes occurring in calm weather.\r\n\r\n~Cat’s-water~, “old Tom,” or gin.\r\n\r\n~Cattle~, a term of contempt applied to the mob, or to a lot of lazy,\r\nhelpless servants.\r\n\r\n~Caucus~, a private meeting held for the purpose of concerting measures,\r\nagreeing upon candidates for office before an election, &c. This is an\r\nAmerican term, and a corruption of CAULKER’S MEETING, being derived from\r\nan association of the shipping interest at Boston, previous to the War\r\nof Independence, who were very active in getting up opposition to\r\nEngland.—_See Pickering’s Vocabulary._\r\n\r\n~Caulk~, to take a surreptitious nap; sleep generally, from the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the term; stopping leaks, repairing damages, so as to come\r\nout as good as new.—_Sea term._\r\n\r\n~Caulker~, a dram. The term “caulker” is usually applied to a stiff\r\nglass of grog—preferably brandy—finishing the potations of the\r\nevening. _See_ WHITEWASH.\r\n\r\n~Caulker~, a too marvellous story, a lie. CHOKER has the same sense.\r\n\r\n~Caution~, anything out of the common way. “He’s a CAUTION,” is said of\r\nan obdurate or argumentative man. The phrase is also used in many ways\r\nin reference to places and things.\r\n\r\n~Cavaulting~, a vulgar phrase equivalent to “horsing.” The _Italian_\r\nCAVALLINO, signifies a rake or debauchee.—_Lingua Franca_, CAVOLTA.\r\nFrom this comes the Americanism “cavorting,” running or riding round in\r\na heedless or purposeless manner.\r\n\r\n~Cave~, or CAVE IN, to submit, shut up.—_American._ Metaphor taken from\r\nthe sinking of an abandoned mining shaft.\r\n\r\n~Chaff~, to gammon, joke, quiz, or praise ironically. Originally “to\r\nqueer” represented our modern word “CHAFF.” CHAFF-bone, the\r\njaw-bone.—_Yorkshire._ CHAFF, jesting. In _Anglo-Saxon_, CEAF is chaff;\r\nand CEAFL, bill, beak, or jaw. In the _Ancren Riwle_, A.D. 1221, CEAFLE\r\nis used in the sense of idle discourse.\r\n\r\n~Chaffer~, the mouth; “moisten your CHAFFER,” _i.e._, take something to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n~Chal~, old Romany term for a man; CHIE was the name for a woman.\r\n\r\n~Chalk out~, or CHALK DOWN, to mark out a line of conduct or action; to\r\nmake a rule or order. Phrase derived from the _Workshop_.\r\n\r\n~Chalk up~, to credit, make entry in account books of indebtedness; “I\r\ncan’t pay you now, but you can CHALK IT UP,” _i.e._, charge me with the\r\narticle in your day-book. From the old practice of chalking one’s score\r\nfor drink behind the bar-doors of public-houses.\r\n\r\n~Chalks~, “to walk one’s CHALKS,” to move off, or run away. An ordeal\r\nfor drunkenness used on board ship, to see whether the suspected person\r\ncan walk on a chalked line without overstepping it on either side.\r\n\r\n~Chalks~, degrees, marks; so called from being made by a piece of chalk;\r\n“to beat by long CHALKS,” _i.e._, to be superior by many degrees.\r\n“Making CHALKS” is a term connected with the punishment of boys on board\r\nship, and in the Naval School at Greenwich. Two chalk lines are drawn\r\nwide apart on the deck or floor, and the boy to be punished places a\r\nfoot on each of these lines, and stoops, thereby presenting a convenient\r\nportion of his person to the boatswain or master.\r\n\r\n~Chance the Ducks~, an expression signifying come what may. “I’ll do it,\r\nand CHANCE THE DUCKS.”\r\n\r\n~Chancery~, a pugilistic phrase for difficulties; “to get a man’s head\r\ninto CHANCERY,” _i.e._, to get an opponent’s head firmly under one’s\r\narm, where it can be pommelled with immense power, and without any\r\npossibility of immediate extrication. From the helplessness of a suitor\r\nin Chancery. This opportunity was of very rare occurrence when the\r\ncombatants were at all evenly matched.\r\n\r\n~Change~, small money. The overplus returned after paying for a thing in\r\na round sum. Hence a slang expression used when a person receives a\r\n“settler” in the shape of either a repartee or a blow—“Take your CHANGE\r\nout of that!”\r\n\r\n~Chap~, a fellow, a boy; “a low CHAP,” a low fellow—abbreviation of\r\nCHAPMAN, a huckster. Used by _Byron_ in his _Critical Remarks_.\r\n\r\n~Chapel~, a printers’ assembly, held for the purpose of discussing\r\ndifferences between employer and workmen, trade regulations, or other\r\nmatters. The term is scarcely slang, but some “comps” ask its insertion\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\n~Chapel.~ An undergrad is expected to attend seven out of the fourteen\r\nservices in chapel each week, and to let four or five be morning\r\nchapels. Occasionally a Don—the Dean as a rule—will “CHAPEL” him, that\r\nis, order him to attend to worship his Creator twice daily. The Bible\r\nclerk “pricks the list,” _i.e._, marks down the names of all\r\npresent.—_Univ._\r\n\r\n~Chapel-of-ease.~ _French_, CABINET D’AISANCE, a house of office.\r\n\r\n~Chariot-buzzing~, picking pockets in an omnibus.\r\n\r\n~Charley~, a watchman, a beadle.

A CHATTY DOSSER or a CRUMMY DOSSER is a filthy\r\ntramp or houseless wanderer.\r\n\r\n~Chaunt~, to sing the contents of any paper in the streets. CANT, as\r\napplied to vulgar language, may have been derived from CHAUNT.\r\n\r\n~Chaunt~, “to CHAUNT the play,” to explain the tricks and manœuvres of\r\nthieves.\r\n\r\n~Chaunter-culls~, a singular body of men who used to haunt certain\r\nwell-known public-houses, and write satirical or libellous ballads on\r\nany person, or body of persons, for a consideration. 7_s._ 6_d._ was the\r\nusual fee, and in three hours the ballad might be heard in St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, or other public spot. Strange as it may appear, there are\r\nactually two men in London at the present day who gain their living in\r\nthis way. Very recently they were singing before the establishment of a\r\nfashionable tailor in Regent Street; and not long since they were\r\nbawling their doggrel rhymes outside the mansion of a Norfolk M.P., in\r\nBelgravia.[57]\r\n\r\n~Chaunters~, those street sellers of ballads, last copies of verses, and\r\nother broadsheets, who sang or bawled the contents of their papers. They\r\noften termed themselves PAPER WORKERS. Cheap evening papers and private\r\nexecutions have together combined to improve these folks’ occupations\r\noff the face of the earth. _See_ HORSE-CHAUNTERS.\r\n\r\n~Chaw~, to chew; CHAW UP, to get the better of one, finish him up;\r\nCHAWED UP, utterly done for.\r\n\r\n~Chaw-bacon~, a rustic. Derived from the popular idea that a countryman\r\nlives entirely on bread and fat bacon. A country clown, a joskin, a\r\nyokel, a clodcrusher. These terms are all exchangeable.\r\n\r\n~Chaw over~, to repeat one’s words with a view to ridicule.\r\n\r\n~Cheap~, “doing it on the CHEAP,” living economically, or keeping up a\r\nshowy appearance with very little means.\r\n\r\n~Cheap Jacks~, or JOHNS, oratorical hucksters and patterers of hardware,\r\nwho put an article up at a high price, and then cheapen it by degrees,\r\nindulging all the time in volleys of coarse wit, until it becomes to all\r\nappearance a bargain, and as such it is bought by one of the crowd. The\r\npopular idea is that the inverse method of auctioneering saves them\r\npaying for the auction licence.—_See_ DUTCH AUCTION.\r\n\r\n~Checks~, counters used in games at cards. In the Pacific States of\r\nAmerica a man who is dead is said to have handed (or passed) in his\r\nchecks. The gamblers there are responsible for many of the\r\ncolloquialisms current.\r\n\r\n~Chee-Chee~, this word is used in a rather offensive manner to denote\r\nEurasians,[58] or children by an English father and native mother. It\r\ntakes its origin in a very common expression of half-caste females,\r\n“CHEE-CHEE,” equivalent to our Oh, fie!—Nonsense!—For\r\nshame!—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Cheek~, share or portion; “where’s my CHEEK?” where is my allowance?\r\n“All to his own CHEEK,” all to himself.\r\n\r\n~Cheek~, impudence, assurance; CHEEKY, saucy or forward.\r\n\r\n~Cheek~, to irritate by impudence, to accuse.\r\n\r\n~Cheek by Jowl~, side by side—said often of persons in such close\r\nconfabulation that their faces almost touch.\r\n\r\n~Cheese~, anything good, first-rate in quality, genuine, pleasant, or\r\nadvantageous, is termed the CHEESE. The _London Guide_, 1818, says it\r\nwas from some young fellows translating “c’est une autre CHOSE” into\r\n“that is another CHEESE.” But the expression CHEESE may be found in the\r\nGipsy vocabulary, and in the Hindostanee and Persian languages. In the\r\nlast CHIZ means a thing—that is the thing, _i.e._, the CHEESE.\r\n\r\n~Cheese~, or CHEESE IT (evidently a corruption of _cease_), leave off,\r\nor have done; “CHEESE your barrikin,” hold your noise. Term very common.\r\n\r\n~Cheesecutter~, a prominent and aquiline nose. Also a large square peak\r\nto a cap. Caps fitted with square peaks are called cheesecutter caps.\r\n\r\n~Cheesemongers~, once a popular name for the First Lifeguards. Until the\r\nPeninsular War the First Lifeguards, from their almost exclusive service\r\nat home, were nicknamed CHEESEMONGERS. This term then fell into\r\ndesuetude; but at Waterloo the commanding officer of the regiment had\r\nnot forgotten it, and when leading his men to the charge, called out,\r\n“Come on, you damned CHEESEMONGERS!” an invitation complied with so\r\nreadily, that the title was restored, with the difference that it was no\r\nlonger a word of reproach.\r\n\r\n~Cheesy~, fine or showy. The opposite of “dusty.”\r\n\r\n~Cherry-bums~, or CHERUBIMS, a nickname given to the 11th Hussars, from\r\ntheir crimson trousers.\r\n\r\n~Cherry-colour~, either red or black, as you wish; a term used in a\r\ncheating trick at cards. When the cards are being dealt, a knowing one\r\noffers to bet that he will tell the colour of the turn-up card. “Done!”\r\nsays Mr. Green. The sum being named, Mr. Sharp affirms that it will be\r\nCHERRY-COLOUR; and as cherries are either black or red, he wins, leaving\r\nhis victim a wiser man, it is to be hoped, and not a _better_ for the\r\nfuture. It may be as well for the habitually unfortunate to know that\r\nwagers of this kind are not recoverable even according to the sporting\r\ncode, which disacknowledges all kinds of catch-bets.\r\n\r\n~Cherry-merry~, a present of money. CHERRY-MERRY-BAMBOO, a\r\nbeating.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Cherubs~, or still more vulgarly, CHERUBIMS, the chorister boys who\r\nchaunt in the services at the abbeys and cathedrals. Possibly because in\r\nsome places their heads alone are visible.\r\n\r\n~Cheshire Cat~, to grin like a CHESHIRE CAT, to display the teeth and\r\ngums when laughing. Formerly the phrase was “to grin like a CHESHIRE CAT\r\neating cheese.” A hardly satisfactory explanation has been given of this\r\nphrase—that Cheshire is a county palatine, and the cats, when they\r\nthink of it, are so tickled with the notion that they can’t help\r\ngrinning.[59]\r\n\r\n~Chicken~, a term applied to anything young, small, or insignificant;\r\nCHICKEN STAKES, small paltry stakes; “she’s no CHICKEN,” said of an old\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\n~Chicken-hearted~, cowardly, fearful. With about the amount of pluck a\r\nchicken in a fright might be supposed to possess.\r\n\r\n~Chi-ike~, to hail in a rough though friendly manner; to support by\r\nmeans of vociferation.\r\n\r\n~Chi-ike~, a hail; a good loud word of hearty praise; term used by the\r\ncostermongers, who assist the sale of each other’s goods by a little\r\nfriendly, although noisy, commendation.\r\n\r\n~Children’s Shoes~ (to make), to be made nought of.—_See_ SHOES.\r\n\r\n~Chill~, to warm, as beer. This at first seems like reversing the order\r\nof things, but it is only a contraction of “take the CHILL off.”\r\n\r\n~Chimney-Sweep~, the aperient mixture commonly called a _black draught_.\r\n\r\n~Chin-chin~, a salutation, a compliment.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Chink~, or CHINKERS, money.—_Ancient._ Derivation obvious.\r\n\r\n~Chin-wag~, officious impertinence.\r\n\r\n~Chip of the Old Block~, a child which physically or morally resembles\r\nits father. BROTHER CHIP, one of the same trade or profession.\r\nOriginally brother carpenter, now general.\r\n\r\n~Chips~, money; also a nickname for a carpenter.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Chirp~, to give information, to “peach.”\r\n\r\n~Chisel~, to cheat, to take a slice off anything. Hence the old\r\nconundrum: “Why is a carpenter like a swindler?—Because he chisels a\r\ndeal.”\r\n\r\n~Chit~, a letter; corruption of a _Hindoo_ word.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Chitterlings~, the shirt frills once fashionable and worn still by\r\nancient beaux; properly the _entrails of a pig_, to which they are\r\nsupposed to bear some resemblance. _Belgian_ SCHYTERLINGH.\r\n\r\n~Chivalry~, coition. Probably a corruption from the _Lingua Franca_.\r\nPerhaps from CHEVAULCHER.\r\n\r\n~Chive~, or CHIVEY, a shout, a halloo, or cheer; loud tongued. Probably\r\nfrom CHEVY-CHASE, a boy’s game, in which the word CHEVY is bawled aloud.\r\nDickens uses the word CHIVEY in _Bleak House_ rather freely, but there\r\nit is from the other phase of CHEVY-CHASE which follows.\r\n\r\n~Chive~, a knife; also used as a verb, to knife. In all these cases the\r\nword is pronounced as though written CHIV or CHIVVY.\r\n\r\n~Chive-Fencer~, a street hawker of cutlery.\r\n\r\n~Chivey~, to chase round, or hunt about. Apparently from\r\nCHEVY-CHASE.—_See_ above.\r\n\r\n~Choakee~, or CHOKEY, the black hole.—_Military Anglo-Indian._ Chokey\r\nis also very vulgar slang for prison.\r\n\r\n~Chock-Full~, full till the scale comes down with a shock. Originally\r\nCHOKE-FULL, and used in reference to theatres and places of amusement.\r\n\r\n~Choke Off~, to get rid of. Bulldogs can only be made to loose their\r\nhold by choking them.[60] Suggestively to get rid of a man by saying\r\nsomething to him which “sticks in his gizzard.”\r\n\r\n~Choker~, a cravat, a neckerchief. WHITE-CHOKER, the white neckerchief\r\nworn by mutes at a funeral, waiters at a tavern, and gentlemen in\r\nevening costume. Clergymen and Exeter Hallites are frequently termed\r\nWHITE-CHOKERS.\r\n\r\n~Choker~, or WIND-STOPPER, a garotter.\r\n\r\n~Chonkeys~, a kind of mincemeat, baked in a crust, and sold in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n~Choops~, a corruption of CHOOPRAHO, keep silence.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Chootah~, small, insignificant.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Chop~, in the Canton jargon of _Anglo-Chinese_, this word has several\r\nsignifications. It means an official seal, a permit, a boat load of\r\nteas. FIRST CHOP signifies first quality; and CHOP-CHOP, to make haste.\r\n\r\n~Chop~, to exchange, to “swop.” To CHOP and change, to be as variable as\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n~Chops~, properly CHAPS, the mouth, or cheeks; “down in the CHOPS,” or\r\n“down in the mouth,” _i.e._, sad or melancholy.\r\n\r\n~Chouse~, to cheat out of one’s share or portion. _Hackluyt_, CHAUS;\r\n_Massinger_, CHIAUS. From the _Turkish_, in which language it signifies\r\nan interpreter. _Gifford_ gives a curious story as to its origin:—\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1609 there was attached to the Turkish embassy in\r\n    England an Interpreter, or CHIAOUS, who, by cunning, aided by his\r\n    official position, managed to cheat the Turkish and Persian\r\n    merchants, then in London, out of the large sum of £4000, then\r\n    deemed an enormous amount. From the notoriety which attended the\r\n    fraud, and the magnitude of the swindle, any one who cheated or\r\n    defrauded was said to _chiaous_, or _chause_, or CHOUSE; to do, that\r\n    is, as this _Chiaous_ had done.”—_See Trench, Eng. Past and\r\n    Present._\r\n\r\nCHIAUS, according to _Sandys_ (_Travels_, p. 48), is “one who goes on\r\nembassies, executes commandments,” &c. The particular Chiaus in question\r\nis alluded to in _Ben Jonson’s Alchymist_, 1610.\r\n\r\n    “_D._ What do you think of me?\r\n            That I am a CHIAUS?\r\n    _Face._                        What’s that?\r\n    _D._ The Turk [who] was here.\r\n            As one would say, do you think I am a Turk?”\r\n\r\n~Chout~, an entertainment.—_East-end of London._\r\n\r\n~Chovey~, a shop.—_Costermonger._\r\n\r\n~Chow-Chow~, a mixture, food of any kind. Also chit-chat and\r\ngossip.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Chowdar~, a fool.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Christening~, erasing the name of the maker, the number, or any other\r\nmark, from a stolen watch, and inserting a fictitious one in its place.\r\n\r\n~Chubby~, round-faced, plump. Probably from the same derivative as CHUB,\r\nwhich means literally a fish with a big head.\r\n\r\n~Chuck~, bread or meat; in fact, anything to eat. Also a particular kind\r\nof beefsteak.\r\n\r\n~Chuck~, a schoolboy’s treat.—_Westminster School._ Provision for an\r\nentertainment. Hard CHUCK is sea biscuit.\r\n\r\n~Chuck~, to throw or pitch.\r\n\r\n~Chuck a Jolly~, to bear up or bonnet, as when a costermonger praises\r\nthe inferior article his mate or partner is trying to sell. _See_\r\nCHI-IKE.\r\n\r\n~Chuck a Stall~, to attract a person’s attention while a confederate\r\npicks his pockets, or otherwise robs him.\r\n\r\n~Chuck in~, to challenge—from the pugilistic custom of throwing a hat\r\ninto the ring; a modern version of “throwing down the gauntlet.” This\r\nterm seems to have gone out of fashion with the custom which gave rise\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n~Chuckle-head~, much the same as “buffle head,” “cabbage head,” “chowder\r\nhead,” “cod’s head,”—all signifying that large abnormal form of skull\r\ngenerally supposed to accompany stupidity and weakness of intellect; as\r\nthe Scotch proverb, “muckle head and little wit.”—Originally\r\nDevonshire, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Chucks!~ Schoolboy’s signal on the master’s approach.\r\n\r\n~Chuck up~, to surrender, give in—from the custom of throwing up the\r\nsponge at a prize-fight in token of yielding. This is very often\r\ncorrupted into “jack up.”\r\n\r\n~Chuff it~, _i.e._, be off, or take it away, in answer to a street\r\nseller who is importuning you to purchase. _Halliwell_ mentions CHUFF as\r\na “term of reproach,” surly, &c.\r\n\r\n~Chull~, make haste. An abbreviation of the _Hindostanee_ CHULLO,\r\nsignifying “go along.” CHULL is very commonly used to accelerate the\r\nmotions of a servant, driver, or palanquin-bearer.\r\n\r\n~Chum~, an intimate acquaintance. A recognised term, but in such\r\nfrequent use with slangists that it almost demands a place here. Stated\r\nto be from the _Anglo-Saxon_, CUMA, a guest.\r\n\r\n~Chum~, to occupy a joint lodging with another person. _Latin_, CUM.\r\n\r\n~Chumming-up~, an old custom amongst prisoners before the present\r\nregulations were in vogue, and before imprisonment for debt was\r\nabolished; when a fresh man was admitted to their number, rough music\r\nwas made with pokers, tongs, sticks, and saucepans. For this ovation the\r\ninitiated prisoner had to pay, or “fork over,” half-a-crown—or submit\r\nto a loss of coat and waistcoat.\r\n\r\n~Chummy~, a chimney-sweep—probably connected with _chimney_; also a\r\nlow-crowned felt hat. Sometimes, but rarely, a sweep is called a\r\nclergyman—from his colour.\r\n\r\n~Chump~, the head or face. Also one end of a loin of mutton. A\r\nhalf-idiotic or daft person is said to be off his chump.\r\n\r\n~Chunk~, a thick or dumpy piece of any substance, as a CHUNK of bread or\r\nmeat.—_Kentish._\r\n\r\n~Church a yack~ (or watch), to take the works of a watch from its\r\noriginal case, and put them into another one, to avoid detection.—_See_\r\nCHRISTEN.\r\n\r\n~Churchwarden~, a long pipe, “a yard of clay;” probably so called from\r\nthe dignity which seems to hedge the smoker of a churchwarden, and the\r\nresponsibility attached to its use. Sometimes called an Alderman.\r\n\r\n~Cinder~, any liquor used in connexion with soda-water, as to “take a\r\nsoda with a CINDER in it.” The cinder may be sherry, brandy, or any\r\nother liquor.\r\n\r\n~Circumbendibus~, a roundabout way, a long-winded story.\r\n\r\n~Clack-box~, a garrulous person, so called from the rattle formerly used\r\nby vagrants to make a rattling noise and attract attention.—_Norfolk._\r\n\r\n⁂ A common proverb in this county is, “your tongue goes like A BAKER’S\r\nCLAP-DISH,” which is evidently a modern corruption of the beggars’ CLAP\r\nor CLACK-DISH mentioned in _Measure for Measure_. It was a wooden dish\r\nwith a movable cover.\r\n\r\n~Claggum~, boiled treacle in a hardened state, hardbake.—_See_ CLIGGY.\r\n\r\n~Clam, or clem~, to starve.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Clap~, to place; “do you think you can CLAP your hand on him?” _i.e._,\r\nfind him out. CLAP is also a well-known form of a contagious disease.\r\n\r\n~Clapper~, the tongue. Said of an over-talkative person, to be hung in\r\nthe middle and to sound with both ends.\r\n\r\n~Clap-trap~, high-sounding nonsense.

The term as used\r\nthis way obtains to a certain extent among turfites.\r\n\r\n~Clawhammer coat~, an American term for a tail-coat used in evening\r\ncostume. Also known as a steel-pen coat.\r\n\r\n~Clean~, quite, or entirely; “CLEAN gone,” entirely out of sight, or\r\naway.—_Old_, see Cotgrave and Shakspeare. CLEAN CONTRARY, quite\r\ndifferent, opposite.\r\n\r\n~Clean out~, to ruin, or make bankrupt any one; to take all he has got,\r\nby purchase, chicane, or force. De Quincey, in his article on Richard\r\nBentley, speaking of the lawsuit between that great scholar and Dr.\r\nColbatch, remarks that the latter “must have been pretty well CLEANED\r\nOUT.” The term is very general.\r\n\r\n~Click~, a knock or blow. CLICK-HANDED, left-handed.—_Cornish._ A term\r\nin Cumberland and Westmoreland wrestling for a peculiar kind of throw,\r\nas “an inside CLICK,” or “an outside CLICK.”\r\n\r\n~Click~, to snatch, to pull away something that belongs to another.\r\n\r\n~Clicker~, a female touter at a bonnet shop. In Northamptonshire, the\r\ncutter out in a shoemaking establishment. In the _Dictionary of the\r\nTerms, Ancient and Modern, of the Canting Crew_, Lond. n. d. (but prior\r\nto 1700), the CLICKER is described as “the shoemaker’s journeyman or\r\nservant, that cutts out all the work, and stands at or walks before the\r\ndoor, and saies—‘What d’ye lack, sir? what d’ye buy, madam?’” In a\r\nprinting-office, a man who makes up the pages, and who takes work and\r\nreceives money for himself and companions.\r\n\r\n~Clift~, to steal.\r\n\r\n~Cliggy~, or CLIDGY, sticky.—_Anglo-Saxon_, CLÆG, clay.—_See_\r\nCLAGGUM.\r\n\r\n~Clinch~ (to get the), to be locked up in jail.\r\n\r\n~Clincher~, that which rivets or confirms an argument, an\r\nincontrovertible position. Also a lie which cannot be surpassed, a\r\nstopper-up, said to be derived as follows:—Two notorious liars were\r\nbacked to outlie each other. “I drove a nail through the moon once,”\r\nsaid the first. “Right,” said the other; “I recollect the circumstance\r\nwell, for I went round to the back part of the moon and _clinched_\r\nit”—hence CLINCHER.\r\n\r\n~Cling-rig~, stealing tankards from public-houses, &c.\r\n\r\n~Clipper~, a fine fast-sailing vessel. Applied also as a term of\r\nencomium to a handsome woman.\r\n\r\n~Clipping~, excellent, very good. CLIPPER, anything showy or first-rate.\r\n\r\n~Clock~, a watch. Watches are also distinguished by the terms “red\r\nclock,” a gold watch, and “white clock,” a silver watch.

Probably St. Giles’s satire, having\r\nreference to the fact that few women there possess a second gown.\r\n\r\n~Clout~, an intentional heavy blow.\r\n\r\n~Clover~, happiness, luck, a delightful position—from the supposed\r\nextra enjoyment which attends cattle when they suddenly find their\r\nquarters changed from a barren field to a meadow of clover. Among\r\nbetting men he who has arranged his wagerings so satisfactorily before\r\nan event that he cannot possibly lose, and may win a good deal, is said\r\nto be in clover, a phrase which is sometimes varied by the remark that\r\n“he stands on velvet.” Any one who is provided for, so that he can look\r\nforward to a term of ease and enjoyment for the rest of his life, is\r\nalso said to be in clover.\r\n\r\n~Club~, in manœuvring troops, so to blunder in giving the word of\r\ncommand that the soldiers get into a position from which they cannot\r\nextricate themselves by ordinary tactical means. Young officers\r\nfrequently “CLUB” their men, and get consequently “wigged” by the\r\ninspecting general.\r\n\r\n~Clump~, to strike, to beat.—_Prov._\r\n\r\n~Cly~, a pocket.—_Old Cant_ for to steal. A correspondent derives this\r\nword from the _Old English_, CLEYES, claws; _Anglo-Saxon_, CLEA. This\r\npronunciation is still retained in Norfolk; thus, to CLY would mean to\r\npounce upon, to snatch.—_See_ FRISK. _Gael._, CLIAH (pronounced CLEE),\r\na basket.\r\n\r\n~Cly-faker~, a pickpocket.\r\n\r\n~Coach~, a private tutor. Originally University, but now general. Any\r\nman who now trains or teaches another, or others, is called a coach. To\r\ncoach is to instruct as regards either physical or mental acquirements.\r\nA private tutor is sometimes termed a RURAL COACH when he is not\r\nconnected with a college. At Rugby a flogging is termed a “coaching.”\r\n\r\n~Coach-wheel~, or TUSHEROON, a crown-piece, or five shillings.\r\n\r\n~Coal~, money; “post the COAL,” put down the money. The phrase was used\r\nby Mr. Buckstone at the Theatrical Fund Dinner of 1863. From this is\r\nderived the theatrical term COALING, profitable, very good, which an\r\nactor will use if his part is full of good and telling speeches—thus,\r\n“my part is full of COALING lines.” This term was used in the sporting\r\nworld long anterior to Mr. Buckstone’s speech. _See_ COAL.\r\n\r\n~Coals~, “to haul (or pull) over the COALS,” to take to task, to scold.\r\nSupposed by Jamieson to refer to the ordeal by fire. To “take one’s\r\ncoals in,” is a term used by sailors to express their having caught the\r\nvenereal disease. It means that they have gotten that which will keep\r\nthem hot for a good many months.\r\n\r\n~Cobbing~, a punishment inflicted by sailors and soldiers among\r\nthemselves. _See_ Grose and Captain Marryat’s novels. A hand-saw is the\r\ngeneral instrument of punishment.\r\n\r\n~Cock~, a familiar term of address; “jolly old COCK,” a jovial fellow,\r\n“how are you, old COCK?” Frequently rendered nowadays, COCK-E-E, a\r\nvulgar street salutation—probably a corruption of COCK-EYE. The latter\r\nis frequently heard as a shout or street cry after a man or boy.\r\n\r\n~Cock~, a smoking term; “COCKING a Broseley,” _i.e._, smoking a pipe.\r\nBroseley in Shropshire is famous for “churchwardens.” A “COCK” is an\r\napocryphal story, generally, of a murder or elopement bawled about the\r\nstreets by the Seven Dials’ “patterers.”\r\n\r\n~Cock~, a pugilistic term for a man who is knocked out of time. “Knocked\r\nhim a reg’lar COCK.” Sometimes used to signify knocked out of shape, as,\r\n“Knocked him A-COCK,” probably connected with “cocked-hat shape.” A\r\nhorse who has been backed by the public, but who does not run, or,\r\nrunning, does not persevere.\r\n\r\n~Cock~, “to COCK your eye,” to shut or wink one eye, to make\r\n“sheep’s-eyes.”\r\n\r\n~Cock-a-hoop~, in high spirits. Possibly the idea is from the fact that,\r\nif a cock wins a fight, he will mount on anything near, and crow lustily\r\nand jubilantly. It is noticeable that under these circumstances a cock\r\nalways gets off the ground-level if he can.\r\n\r\n~Cockalorum~, or COCKYLORUM, amplification of cock or cocky.\r\n\r\n~Cock and bull story~, a long, rambling anecdote.—_See_ Peroration to\r\n_Tristram Shandy_.\r\n\r\n~Cock-and-hen-club~, a free and easy gathering, or “sing-song,” where\r\nfemales are admitted as well as males.\r\n\r\n~Cock-and-pinch~, the old-fashioned beaver hat, affected by “swells” and\r\n“sporting gents” forty years ago—COCKED back and front, and PINCHED up\r\nat the sides.\r\n\r\n~Cock-a-wax~, an amplification of the simple term COCK, sometimes “Lad\r\nof WAX,” originally applied to a cobbler, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Cocked-hat-club~, the principal clique amongst the members of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries, who virtually decide whether any person proposed\r\nshall be admitted or not. The term comes from the “cocked-hat” placed\r\nbefore the president at the sittings. There was another cocked-hat club\r\nin London not many years back, which had nothing peculiar about it\r\nbeyond the fact that every member wore during club sittings, a\r\n“fore-and-aft” cocked-hat. Otherwise the proceedings were of the most\r\nordinary kind.\r\n\r\n~Cocked-hat-shaped~, shapeless: Anything which has been altered beyond\r\nrecognition, or any man who has been put completely _hors de combat_, is\r\nsaid to have been knocked into a COCKED-HAT.\r\n\r\n~Cocker~, “It is all right, according to Cocker,” meaning that\r\neverything has been done in accordance with the present system of\r\nfigures. The phrase refers to the celebrated writing-master of Charles\r\nII.’s time, whose Arithmetic, Dictionary, &c., were long the standard\r\nauthorities. The Arithmetic was first published in 1677-8, and, though\r\nit reached more than sixty editions, is considered a very scarce book.\r\nProfessor de Morgan says that the main goodness of Cocker’s _Tutor_\r\nconsists in his adopting the abbreviated system of division; and\r\nsuggests that it became a proverbial representative of arithmetic from\r\nMurphy’s farce of _The Apprentice_, 1756, in which the strong point of\r\nthe old merchant, Wingate, is his extreme reverence for Cocker and his\r\narithmetic. A curious fact may here be mentioned in connexion with this\r\nsaying. It has been stated, and very well proved, that many words\r\npopular in Shakspeare’s time, and now obsolete in this country, are\r\nstill in every-day use in the older English settlements of North\r\nAmerica. The original compiler of this work was surprised, when\r\ntravelling through Western Canada, to find that, instead of the renowned\r\nCocker, the people appealed to another and more learned authority.\r\n“According to Gunter,” is a phrase in continual Transatlantic use. This\r\nscientific worthy invented the sector in 1606; and in 1623, about the\r\ntime of the great Puritan exodus to North America, he brought out his\r\nfamous _Rule of Proportion_. This was popularly known as Gunter’s\r\nProportion, or _Gunter’s Line_, and the term soon became a vulgar\r\nstandard of appeal in cases of doubt or dispute.\r\n\r\n~Cock-eye~, a term of opprobrium often applied to one that squints.\r\n\r\n~Cockles~, “to rejoice the COCKLES of one’s heart,” a vulgar phrase\r\nimplying great pleasure. Also, to “warm one’s COCKLES,” said of any hot,\r\nwell-spiced drink, taken in cold weather. COCKLES altogether seem to be\r\nan imaginary portion—of great importance—in the internal economy of\r\nthe human frame.\r\n\r\n~Cockney~, a native of London. Originally, a spoilt or effeminate boy,\r\nderived from COCKERING, or foolishly petting a person, rendering him of\r\nsoft and luxurious manners. Halliwell states, in his admirable essay\r\nupon the word, that “some writers trace the word with much probability\r\nto the imaginary land of COCKAYGNE, the lubber land of the olden times.”\r\nGrose gives Minsheu’s absurd but comical derivation:—A citizen of\r\nLondon being in the country, and hearing a horse neigh, exclaimed,\r\n“Lord! how that horse laughs!” A bystander informed him that the noise\r\nwas called neighing. The next morning when the cock crowed, the citizen,\r\nto show that he had not forgotten what was told him, cried out, “Do you\r\nhear how the COCK NEIGHS?”—_See_ MARE’S NEST.\r\n\r\n~Cock of the walk~, a master spirit, head of a party. Places where\r\npoultry are fed are called WALKS, and the barn door cocks invariably\r\nfight for the supremacy till one has obtained it. At schools where this\r\nphrase was originally much used, it has been diminished to “COCK” only.\r\n\r\n~Cock one’s toes~, to die. Otherwise “turn-up one’s toes.”\r\n\r\n~Cock-robin shop~, a small printing-office, where cheap and nasty work\r\nis done and low wages are paid.\r\n\r\n~Cocks~, fictitious narratives, in verse or prose, of murders, fires,\r\nand terrible accidents, sold in the streets as true accounts. The man\r\nwho hawks them, a patterer, often changes the scene of the awful event\r\nto suit the taste of the neighbourhood he is trying to delude. Possibly\r\na corruption of _cook_, a cooked statement, or maybe “the story of a\r\ncock and a bull” may have had something to do with the term.\r\nImprovements in newspapers, especially in those published in the\r\nevening, and increased scepticism on the part of the public, have\r\ndestroyed this branch of a once-flourishing business.\r\n\r\n~Cockshy~, a game at fairs and races, where trinkets are set upon\r\nsticks, and for one penny three throws at them are accorded, the thrower\r\nkeeping whatever he knocks off. From the ancient game of throwing or\r\n“shying” at live cocks. Any prominent person abused in the newspapers is\r\nsaid to be a common COCKSHY.\r\n\r\n~Cocksure~, certain.\r\n\r\n~Cocky~, pert, saucy.\r\n\r\n~Cocoa-nut~, the head. A pugilistic term. Also, when anything is\r\nexplained to a man for the first time, it is not unusual for him to say,\r\n“Ah, that accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nut”—a remark which has\r\nits origin in a clever but not very moral story.\r\n\r\n~Cocum~, shrewdness, ability, luck; “Jack’s got COCUM, he’s safe to get\r\non, he is,”—viz., he starts under favourable circumstances; “to fight\r\nCOCUM” is to be wily and cautious. Allied perhaps to the Scottish KEEK,\r\n_German_, GUCKEN, to peep or pry into.\r\n\r\n~Cod~, to hoax, to take a “rise” out of one. Used as a noun, a fool.\r\n\r\n~Coddam~, a public-house game, much affected by medical students and\r\ncabmen, generally three on each side. The game is “simplicity itself,”\r\nbut requires a great amount of low cunning and peculiar mental\r\ningenuity. It consists in guessing in which of the six hands displayed\r\non the table, a small piece of marked money lies hid. If the guesser\r\n“brings it home,” his side takes the “piece,” and the centre man “works”\r\nit. If the guess is wrong, a chalk is taken to the holders, who again\r\nsecrete the coin. Great fun is to be obtained from this game when it is\r\nproperly played.\r\n\r\n~Codds~, the “poor brethren” of the Charter House. In _The Newcomes_,\r\nThackeray writes, “The Cistercian lads call these old gentlemen CODDS; I\r\nknow not wherefore.” A probable abbreviation of CODGER.\r\n\r\n~Codger~, or COGER, an old man; “a rum old CODGER,” a curious old\r\nfellow. CODGER is sometimes used as synonymous with CADGER, and then\r\nsignifies a person who gets his living in a questionable manner.\r\n“COGERS,” the name of a debating society, formerly held in Shoe Lane,\r\nFleet Street, and still in existence. The term is probably a corruption\r\nof COGITATORS.\r\n\r\n~Coffee-Shop~, a watercloset, or house of office.\r\n\r\n~Cog~, to cheat at dice.—_Shakspeare._ Also, to agree with, as one\r\ncog-wheel does with another, to crib from another’s book, as schoolboys\r\noften do. This is called “cogging over.”\r\n\r\n~Cogged~, loaded like false dice. Any one who has been hocussed or\r\ncheated is sometimes said to have been COGGED.\r\n\r\n~Coin~, “to post the COIN”—sometimes “post the coal”—a sporting phrase\r\nmeaning to make a deposit of money for a match of any kind.\r\n\r\n~Cold blood~, a house licensed for the sale of beer “NOT to be drunk on\r\nthe premises.”\r\n\r\n~Cold coffee~, misfortune; sometimes varied to COLD GRUEL. An unpleasant\r\nreturn for a proffered kindness is sometimes called COLD COFFEE.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Cold coffee~, an Oxford synonym for a “sell,” which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Cold cook~, an undertaker. Cold cook’s shop, an undertaker’s.\r\n\r\n~Cold meat~, a corpse. COLD-MEAT BOX, a coffin.\r\n\r\n~Cold meat train~, the last train at night by which officers can reach\r\nAldershot per South Western Railway. So called because by this train\r\ncorpses are often conveyed on account of the Necropolis Company to\r\nWoking.\r\n\r\n~Cold shoulder~, “to show or give any one the COLD SHOULDER” is to “cut”\r\nin a modified form, to assume a distant manner towards anybody, to\r\nevince a desire to cease acquaintanceship. Sometimes termed “COLD\r\nSHOULDER of mutton.”\r\n\r\n~Colfabias~, a Latinized Irish phrase signifying the closet of decency,\r\napplied as a slang term to a place of resort in Trinity College, Dublin.\r\n\r\n~Collar~, “out of COLLAR,” _i.e._, out of place, no work. Probably a\r\nvariation of the metaphorical expressions, “in, or out of harness,”\r\n_i.e._, in or out of work—the horse being in collar when harnessed for\r\nhis work. COLLAR work is any very hard work, from the expression among\r\ndrivers. Any uphill journey is said to be all “COLLAR work” for the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n~Collar~, to seize, to lay hold of. Thieves’ slang, _i.e._, to steal.\r\n\r\n~Collar and elbow~, a term for a peculiar style of wrestling—the\r\nCornwall and Devon style.\r\n\r\n~Collections~, the College examinations at the end of each term, when\r\nundergraduates wear white ties and bands, and are trotted through the\r\nsubjects of the term’s lecture. These are the occasions when the dons\r\nadminister reproof or advice on the conduct of each individual\r\nundergrad.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Collogue~, to conspire, talk mysteriously together in low tones, plot\r\nmischief. Connected with “colloquy” or “colleague.” Maybe mixture of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n~Colly-wobbles~, the stomach-ache, a person’s bowels,—supposed by many\r\nto be the seat of feeling and nutrition.—_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Colour~, complexion, tint; “I’ve not seen the COLOUR of his money,”\r\n_i.e._, he has never paid me any. In fortune-telling by cards, a\r\n_diamond colour_ is the fairest; _heart-colour_, fair, but not so fair\r\nas the last; _club colour_, rather dark; _spade colour_, an extremely\r\nswarthy complexion.\r\n\r\n~Colour~, a handkerchief worn by each of the supporters of a\r\nprofessional athlete on the day of a match, so as to distinguish them\r\nfrom the partizans of the other side. The professional chooses his\r\ncolours, and his backers, and as many of the general public as can be\r\npersuaded to do so, take one each to wear on the eventful day, the\r\nunderstanding being that the man is to be paid, say, a guinea if he\r\nwins, and nothing if he loses. Some of these handkerchiefs used to be,\r\nin the palmy days of pugilism and professional rowing on the Thames,\r\nvery fine specimens of work; but as their purveyors expected to be paid\r\nwhether they won or lost, and as the price was generally about four\r\ntimes the intrinsic value, colours are rather shyly dealt with now. The\r\ncustom is, however, a very ancient one, and such men as Tom Sayers, Tom\r\nKing, Harry Kelley, and Bob Chambers have, even in these degenerate\r\ndays, received very large sums for their winning colours.\r\n\r\n~Colt~, a murderous weapon, formed by slinging a small shot to the end\r\nof a rather stiff piece of rope. It is the original of the misnamed\r\n“life-preserver.”\r\n\r\n~Colt~, a person who sits as juryman for the first time. In Cork an\r\noperative baker who does not belong to the union.\r\n\r\n~Colt~, a professional cricketer during his first season. From the best\r\ncolts in the annual match are selected new county players.\r\n\r\n~Colt~, to fine a new juryman a sum to be spent in drink, by way of\r\n“wetting” his office; to make a person free of a new place, which is\r\ndone by his standing treat, and submitting to be struck on the sole of\r\nthe foot with a piece of board.\r\n\r\n~Colt’s tooth~, elderly persons of juvenile tastes are said to have a\r\nCOLT’S TOOTH, _i.e._, a desire to shed their teeth once more, to see\r\nlife over again.\r\n\r\n~Comb-cut~, mortified, disgraced, “down on one’s luck.”—_See_ CUT.\r\n\r\n~Come~, a slang verb used in many phrases; “Aint he COMING IT?” _i.e._,\r\nis he not proceeding at a great rate? “Don’t COME TRICKS here,” “don’t\r\nCOME THE OLD SOLDIER over me,” _i.e._, we are aware of your practices,\r\nand “twig” your manœuvre. COMING IT STRONG, exaggerating, going ahead,\r\nthe opposite of “drawing it mild.” COMING IT also means informing or\r\ndisclosing. Also, in pugilistic phraseology, to COME IT means to show\r\nfear; and in this respect, as well as in that of giving information, the\r\nexpression “COME IT” is best known to the lower and most dangerous\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n~Come down~, to pay down.\r\n\r\n~Commemoration~, the end of Lent term at Oxford, when honorary degrees\r\nare conferred and certain prizes given, and when men have friends “up.”\r\n\r\n~Commission~, a shirt.—_Ancient Cant._ _Italian_, CAMICIA.\r\n\r\n    “As from our beds, we doe oft cast our eyes,\r\n    Cleane linnen yeelds a shirt before we rise,\r\n    Which is a garment _shifting_ in condition;\r\n    And in the _canting tongue_ is a COMMISSION.\r\n    In weale or woe, in joy or dangerous drifts,\r\n    A _shirt_ will put a man unto his _shifts_.”\r\n\r\n        —_Taylor’s Works_, 1630.\r\n\r\nFor further particulars, _see_ CAMESA.\r\n\r\n~Commister~, a chaplain or clergyman.—Originally _Old Cant_.\r\n\r\n~Common sewer~, a DRAIN,—vulgar equivalent for a drink.\r\n\r\n~Commons~, the allowance of anything sent out of the buttery or kitchen.\r\n“A COMMONS of bread,” or “of cheese,” for instance.—_University._ SHORT\r\nCOMMONS (derived from the University slang term), a scanty meal, a\r\nscarcity.\r\n\r\n~Competition wallah~, one who entered the Indian Civil Service by\r\npassing a competitive examination.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Compo~, a sailor’s term for his monthly advance of wages.\r\n\r\n~Comprador~, a purveyor, an agent.—_Originally Spanish, now\r\nAnglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Concaves and convexes~, a pack of cards contrived for cheating, by\r\ncutting all the cards from the two to the seven concave, and all from\r\nthe eight to the king convex. Then by cutting the pack breadthwise a\r\nconvex card is cut, and by cutting it lengthwise a concave is\r\nsecured.—_See_ LONGS AND SHORTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~Conjee~, a kind of gruel made of rice.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Conk~, a nose. Possibly from the _Latin_, CONCHA, a shell. _Greek_,\r\nκόγχη—hence anything hollow. Somewhat of a parallel may be found in the\r\n_Latin_, TESTA, an earthenware pot, a shell, and in later _Latin_, a\r\n_skull_; from whence the _French_ TESTE, or TÊTE, head. CONKY, having a\r\nprojecting or remarkable nose. The first Duke of Wellington was\r\nfrequently termed “Old CONKY” in satirical papers and caricatures.\r\n\r\n~Connaught Rangers~, the Eighty-eighth Regiment of Foot in the British\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\n~Conshun’s price~, fair terms, without extortion. Probably conscience\r\nprice.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Constable~, “to overrun the CONSTABLE,” to exceed one’s income, or get\r\ndeep in debt. The origin of this phrase is unknown, but its use is very\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n~Constitutional~, a walk, or other exercise taken for the benefit of the\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n~Consumah~, a butler.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Contango~, among stockbrokers and jobbers, is a certain sum paid for\r\naccommodating a buyer or seller, by carrying the engagement to pay money\r\nor deliver shares over to the next account day.\r\n\r\n~Continuations~, coverings for the legs, whether trousers or breeches. A\r\nword belonging to the same squeamish, affected family as unmentionables,\r\ninexpressibles, &c.\r\n\r\n~Convey~, to steal; “CONVEY, the wise it call.”\r\n\r\n~Conveyancer~, a pickpocket. Shakspeare uses the cant expression\r\nCONVEYER, a thief. The same term is also French slang.\r\n\r\n~Cooey~, the Australian bush-call, now not unfrequently heard in the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\n~Cook~, a term well known in the Bankruptcy Courts, in reference to\r\naccounts that have been meddled with, or COOKED, by the bankrupt; also\r\nto form a balance-sheet from general trade inferences; stated by a\r\ncorrespondent to have been first used in reference to the celebrated\r\nalteration of the accounts of the Eastern Counties Railway, by George\r\nHudson, the Railway King. Any unfair statements of accounts or reports\r\nare now said to be COOKED.\r\n\r\n~Cook~, in artistic circles, to dodge up a picture. Artists say that a\r\npicture will not COOK when it is excellent and unconventional, and\r\nbeyond specious imitation.\r\n\r\n~Cook one’s goose~, to kill or ruin a person.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Cooler~, a glass of porter as a wind up, after drinking spirits and\r\nwater. This form of drinking is sometimes called “putting the beggar on\r\nthe gentleman.”\r\n\r\n~Coolie~, a soldier, in allusion to the Hindoo COOLIES, or day\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\n~Coon~, abbreviation of racoon.—_American._ A GONE COON—_ditto_, one\r\nin an awful fix, past praying for. This expression is said to have\r\noriginated in the first American war with a spy, who dressed himself in\r\na racoon skin, and ensconced himself in a tree. An English rifleman\r\ntaking him for a veritable coon, levelled his piece at him, upon which\r\nhe exclaimed, “Don’t shoot, I’ll come down of myself, I know I’m a GONE\r\nCOON.” The Yankees say the Britisher was so “flummuxed,” that he flung\r\ndown his rifle and “made tracks” for home. The phrase is pretty general\r\nin England. [There is one difficulty about this story—How big was the\r\nman who dressed himself in a racoon skin?]\r\n\r\n~Cooper~, “stout half-and-half,” _i.e._, half stout and half porter.\r\nDerived from the coopers at breweries being allowed so much stout and so\r\nmuch porter a day, which they take mixed.\r\n\r\n~Cooper~, to destroy, spoil, settle, or finish. COOPERED, spoilt, “done\r\nup,” synonymous with the Americanism caved in, fallen in, ruined. The\r\nvagabonds’ hieroglyph ▽, chalked by them on gate posts and houses,\r\nsignifies that the place has been spoilt by too many tramps calling\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n~Cooper~, to forge, or imitate in writing; “COOPER a monniker,” to forge\r\na signature.\r\n\r\n~Cooter~, “a sovereign.”—_See_ COUTER. Gipsy, CUTA.\r\n\r\n~Cop~, to seize or lay hold of anything unpleasant; used in a similar\r\nsense to _catch_ in the phrase “to COP (or catch) a beating.” “To get\r\nCOPT,” is to be taken by the police. Probable contraction of Lat.\r\n_capere_.\r\n\r\n~Cop~, beware, take care. A contraction of COPRADOR.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Coper~, properly HORSE-COUPER, a Scotch horse-dealer,—used to denote a\r\ndishonest one. COPING, like jockeying, is suggestive of all kinds of\r\ntrickery.\r\n\r\n~Copper~, a policeman, _i.e._, one who COPS, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Copper~, a halfpenny. COPPERS, mixed pence.\r\n\r\n~Coppernose~, a nose which is supposed to show a partiality on its\r\nowner’s part for strong drink. Synonymous with “jolly nose.”\r\nGrog-blossoms are the jewels often set in a jolly nose.\r\n\r\n~Copus~, a Cambridge drink, consisting of ale combined with spices, and\r\nvaried by spirits, wines, &c. Corruption of HIPPOCRAS.\r\n\r\n~Corduroy roads~, an American term for the rough roads made by simply\r\nlaying logs along a clearing.\r\n\r\n~Corinthianism~, a term derived from the classics, much in vogue some\r\nyears ago, implying pugilism, high life, “sprees,” roystering,\r\n&c.—Shakspeare, 1 _Hen. IV._ ii. 4. The immorality of _Corinth_ was\r\nproverbial in Greece. Κορινθιάζεσθαι, to _Corinthianize_, indulge in\r\nthe company of courtezans, was a Greek slang expression. Hence the\r\nproverb—\r\n\r\n    Οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἰς Κόρινθον ἔσθ᾿ ὁ πλοῦς;\r\n\r\nand _Horace_, Epist. lib. 1, xvii. 36—\r\n\r\n    “Non cuivis hommi contingit adire Corinthum,”\r\n\r\nin allusion to the spoliation practised by the “hetæræ” on those who\r\nvisited them. Pierce Egan, in his _Life in London_, is responsible for a\r\ndeal of the modern use of this word; and after him _Bell’s Life_, as the\r\noracle of Corinthian sport, was not idle.\r\n\r\n~Cork~, a broken man, a bankrupt. Probably intended to refer to his\r\nlightness, as being without “ballast.”\r\n\r\n~Cork~, “to draw a CORK,” to give a bloody nose.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Corkage~, money charged when persons at an hotel provide their own\r\nwine—sixpence being charged for each “cork” drawn.\r\n\r\n~Corked~, said of wine which tastes of cork, from being badly decanted,\r\nor which has lost flavour from various other obvious causes.\r\n\r\n~Corker~, “that’s a CORKER,” _i.e._, that settles the question, or\r\ncloses the discussion.\r\n\r\n~Corks~, a butler. Derivation very obvious.\r\n\r\n~Corks~, money; “how are you off for CORKS?” a sailors’ term of a very\r\nexpressive kind, denoting the means of “keeping afloat.”\r\n\r\n~Corned~, drunk or intoxicated. Possibly from soaking or pickling\r\noneself like CORNED beef.\r\n\r\n~Corner~, “the CORNER,” Tattersall’s famous horse repository and betting\r\nrooms, so called from the fact of its situation, which was at Hyde Park\r\nCorner. Though Tattersall’s has been removed some distance, to Albert\r\nGate, it is still known to the older habitués of the Subscription Room\r\nas “the CORNER.”\r\n\r\n~Cornered~, hemmed in a corner, placed in a position from which there is\r\nno escape.\r\n\r\n~Corner-man~, the end singer of a corps of Ethiopian or nigger\r\nminstrels. There are two corner men, one generally plays the bones and\r\nthe other the tambourine. Corner-men are the grotesques of a minstrel\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n~Corn in Egypt~, a popular expression which means a plentiful supply of\r\nmaterials for a dinner, &c., or a good supply of money. Its origin is of\r\ncourse Biblical.\r\n\r\n~Corporation~, the protuberant front of an obese person. Probably from\r\nthe old announcements which used to be made, and are made now in some\r\ntowns where improvements are made by the municipal authorities, “Widened\r\nat the expense of the CORPORATION.”\r\n\r\n~Corpse~, to stick fast in the dialogue; to confuse, or put out the\r\nactors by making a mistake.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Cosh~, a neddy, a life-preserver; any short, loaded bludgeon.\r\n\r\n~Cossack~, a policeman.\r\n\r\n~Costard~, the head.

COSTERING, _i.e._,\r\ncostermongering, acting as a costermonger would.\r\n\r\n~Costermonger~, a street seller of fish, fruit, vegetables, poultry,\r\n&c. The London costermongers number more than 30,000. They form a\r\ndistinct class, occupying whole neighbourhoods, and were at one time cut\r\noff from the rest of metropolitan society by their low habits, general\r\nimprovidence, pugnacity, love of gambling, total want of education,\r\ndisregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar\r\nslang language. They have changed a good deal of this, though, now.\r\nCOSTERMONGER _aliter_ COSTARDMONGER, _i.e._, an apple-seller. In Nares’s\r\n_Glossary_ (Ed. H. & W.) they are said to have been frequently Irish.\r\nSo, Ben Jonson—\r\n\r\n    “Her father was an Irish COSTAR-MONGER.”\r\n\r\n        _Alchym._, iv. x.\r\n\r\n    “In England, sir, troth I ever laugh when I think on ’t,\r\n    ----Why, sir, there all the COSTER-MONGERS are Irish.”\r\n\r\n        _2 P. Hen. IV., O. Pl._, iii. 375.\r\n\r\nTheir noisy manners are alluded to in Beaumont and Fletcher’s _Scornful\r\nLady_, iv. I.\r\n\r\n    “And then he’ll rail like a rude COSTER-MONGER\r\n    That school-boys had couzened of his apples,\r\n    As loud and senseless.”\r\n\r\n~Cotton~, to like, adhere to, or agree with any person; “to COTTON on to\r\na man,” to attach yourself to him, or fancy him, literally, to stick to\r\nhim as cotton would. _Vide_ Bartlett, who claims it as an Americanism,\r\nand Halliwell, who terms it an archaism; also _Bacchus and Venus_, 1737.\r\n\r\n    “Her heart’s as hard as taxes, and as bad;\r\n    She does not even COTTON to her dad.”\r\n\r\n        _Halliday and Lawrance_, _Kenilworth Burlesque_.\r\n\r\n~Cotton Lord~, a Manchester manufacturer.\r\n\r\n~Cottonopolis~, Manchester. A term much in use among the reporters of\r\nthe sporting press engaged in that locality.\r\n\r\n~Council-of-ten~, the toes of a man who turns his feet inward.\r\n\r\n~Counter~, to hit back, to exchange blows. A cross COUNTER is a blow\r\nwith the right hand given in exchange for one with the left, the\r\ncounterer preferring to strike rather than to “stop” the\r\nblow.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Counter-jumper~, a shopman, a draper’s assistant.\r\n\r\n~Country-captain~, a spatch-cocked fowl, sprinkled with curry-powder.

Since\r\nshort hair has become fashionable the expression has fallen somewhat\r\ninto disuse. In the times when long hair was worn, a man with his hair\r\ncut as described was said to have had it done with a knife and fork.\r\n\r\n~Couple-beggar~, a degraded person, who officiated as a clergyman in\r\nperforming marriages in the Fleet Prison.\r\n\r\n~Couter~, a sovereign. HALF-A-COUTER, half-a-sovereign. From the\r\nDanubian-gipsy word CUTA, a gold coin.\r\n\r\n~Cove~, or COVEY, a boy or man of any age or station. A term generally\r\npreceded by an expressive adjective, thus a “flash COVE,” a “rum COVE,”\r\na “downy COVE,” &c. The feminine, COVESS, was once popular, but it has\r\nfallen into disuse. Originally ancient cant (temp. Henry VII.), COFE, or\r\nCUFFIN, altered in Decker’s time to COVE. _See Witts’ Recreations_,\r\n1654: “there’s a gentry-COVE here,” _i.e._, a gentleman. Probably\r\nconnected with CUIF, which, in the North of England, signifies a lout or\r\nawkward fellow. Amongst Negroes, CUFFEE.\r\n\r\n~Coventry~, “to send a man to COVENTRY,” not to speak to or notice him.\r\nCoventry was one of those towns in which the privilege of practising\r\nmost trades was anciently confined to certain privileged persons, as the\r\nfreemen, &c. Hence a stranger stood little chance of custom, or\r\ncountenance, and “to send a man to COVENTRY” came to be equivalent to\r\nputting him out of the pale of society.\r\n\r\n~Cover-down~, a tossing coin with a false cover, enabling either head or\r\ntail to be shown, according as the cover is left on or taken off. The\r\ncover is more generally called a CAP. This style of cheating is now\r\nobsolete. A man who cannot manage to cheat at tossing without machinery\r\nis a sorry rogue.\r\n\r\n~Cowan~, a sneak, an inquisitive or prying person. _Greek_, κύων, a dog.\r\nTerm given by Freemasons to all uninitiated persons. Used in Anderson’s\r\n_Constitutions_, edit. 1769, p. 97. If derived from κύων, its use was\r\nprobably suggested by such passages in the N. T. as Matt. vii. 6, and\r\nPhil. iii. 2. The Moslems apply dog in a similar manner. It is probably\r\nOriental. Other authorities say it is from COWAN, or KIRWAN, a Scottish\r\nword signifying a man who builds rough stone walls without mortar—a man\r\nwho, though he builds, is not a practical mason.\r\n\r\n~Cow-cow~, to be very angry, to scold or reprimand\r\nviolently.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Cow-hocked~, clumsy about the ankles; with large or awkward feet.\r\n\r\n~Cow-lick~, the term given to the lock of hair which costermongers and\r\ntramps usually twist forward from the ear; a large greasy curl upon the\r\ncheek, seemingly licked into shape.

From the crab-like or sprawling appearance of the man when in\r\nthe bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n~Crab~, to offend, or insult; to expose or defeat a robbery, to inform\r\nagainst. CRAB, in the sense of “to offend,” is _Old English_.\r\n\r\n    “If I think one thing and speak another,\r\n    I will both CRAB Christ and our Ladie His mother.”\r\n\r\n        _Packman’s Paternoster._\r\n\r\n~Crabs~, in dicing, a pair of aces.\r\n\r\n~Crabshells~, or TROTTER-CASES, shoes.—_See_ CARTS.\r\n\r\n~Crack~, the favourite horse in a race. Steeplechase and hunting CRACKS\r\nhave been made the subjects of well-known pictures, and “the gallops of\r\nthe CRACKS” is a prominent line in the sporting papers.\r\n\r\n~Crack~, first-rate, excellent; “a CRACK HAND,” an adept; a “CRACK\r\narticle,” a good one. “A CRACK regiment,” a fashionable one.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Crack~, dry firewood.—_Modern Gipsy._\r\n\r\n~Crack~, “in a CRACK (of the finger and thumb),” in a moment.\r\n\r\n~Crack~, to break into a house; “CRACK A CRIB,” to commit burglary.\r\n\r\n~Crack a bottle~, to drink. Shakspeare uses CRUSH in the same slang\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n~Cracked up~, penniless or ruined.\r\n\r\n~Cracking a crust~, rubbing along in the world. CRACKING A TIDY CRUST,\r\nmeans doing very well. This is a very common expression among the lower\r\norders.\r\n\r\n~Crackle~, or CRACKLING, the scored rind on a roast leg or loin of pork;\r\nhence applied to the velvet bars on the gowns of the students at St.\r\nJohn’s College, Cambridge, long called “Hogs,” and the covered bridge\r\nwhich connects one of the courts with the grounds, Isthmus of Suez\r\n(SUES, _Lat._ SUS, a swine).\r\n\r\n~Cracksman~, a burglar, _i.e._, the man who CRACKS.\r\n\r\n~Crack up~, to boast or praise.—_Ancient English._\r\n\r\n~Cram~, to lie or deceive, implying to fill up or CRAM a person with\r\nfalse stories; to impart or acquire learning quickly, to “grind” or\r\nprepare for an examination.\r\n\r\n~Crammer~, one skilled in rapidly preparing others for an examination.\r\nOne in the habit of telling lies.\r\n\r\n~Crammer~, a lie.\r\n\r\n~Cranky~, foolish, idiotic, rickety, capricious (not confined to\r\npersons). _Ancient cant_, CRANKE, simulated sickness. _German_, KRANK,\r\nsickly.

Sometimes topped. “May I be topped.”\r\n\r\n~Cropper~, a heavy fall, a decided failure. Term originally used in the\r\nhunting-field, but now general, and not at all confined to physical\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n~Cropper~, “to go a CROPPER,” or “to come a CROPPER,” _i.e._, to fail\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n~Croppie~, a person who has had his hair cut, or CROPPED, in prison.\r\nFormerly those who had been CROPPED (_i.e._, had their ears cut off and\r\ntheir noses slit) by the public executioner were called CROPPIES, then\r\nthe Puritans received the reversion of the title.\r\n\r\n~Crop up~, to turn up in the course of conversation. “It CROPPED UP\r\nwhile we were speaking.”\r\n\r\n~Cross~, a deception—two persons pretending hostility or indifference\r\nto each other, being all the while in concert for the purpose of\r\ndeceiving a third. In the sporting world a CROSS is an arrangement made\r\nbetween two men that one shall win without reference to relative merits.\r\nThis is sometimes done with the backer’s consent for the public benefit,\r\nat other times a backer is himself the sufferer, the men having “put\r\nsome one in to lay,” according to instructions.—_See_ DOUBLE CROSS.\r\n\r\n~Cross~, a general term amongst thieves expressive of their plundering\r\nprofession, the opposite of square. “To get anything on the CROSS” is to\r\nobtain it surreptitiously. “CROSS-FANNING in a crowd,” robbing persons\r\nof their scarf-pins, so called from the peculiar position of the arms.\r\nThis style of thieving is not confined to the conveying of scarf-pins.\r\nCROSSMAN, a thief, or one who lives by dishonest practices.\r\n\r\n~Cross.~—For not paying his term bills to the bursar (treasurer), or\r\nfor cutting chapels, or lectures, or other offences, the undergrad can\r\nbe “CROSSED” at the buttery, or kitchen, or both, _i.e._, a CROSS is put\r\nagainst his name by the Don, who wishes to see him, or to punish him. Of\r\ncourse it is easy to get one’s buttery commons out in some one else’s\r\nname, and to order dinner in from the confectioner’s. The porter is\r\nsupposed to allow no dinners to be sent in, but, between his winking and\r\na little disguise, it is possible. As another instance, a barrel of beer\r\nwill not be admitted; but if it is in a hamper it will pass!—_Oxford\r\nUniversity._\r\n\r\n~Cross-buttock~, an unexpected fling down or repulse; from a peculiar\r\nthrow practised by wrestlers.\r\n\r\n~Cross cove and molisher~, a man and woman who live by thieving.\r\n\r\n~Cross-crib~, a house frequented by thieves.\r\n\r\n~Crossed~, prohibited from taking food from the buttery.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Crow~, or COCK-CROW, to exult over another’s abasement, as a\r\nfighting-cock does over his vanquished adversary.\r\n\r\n~Crow~, “a regular CROW,” a success, a stroke of luck,—equivalent to a\r\nFLUKE.\r\n\r\n~Crow~, one who watches whilst another commits a theft, a confederate in\r\na robbery. The CROW looks to see that the way is clear, whilst the\r\nSNEAK, his partner, commits the depredation.\r\n\r\n~Crow~, “I have a CROW to pick with you,” _i.e._, an explanation to\r\ndemand, a disagreeable matter to settle. Sometimes the article picked is\r\nsupposed to be a bone.\r\n\r\n~Crowsfeet~, wrinkles which gather in the corners of the eyes of old or\r\ndissipated people.\r\n\r\n~Crug~, food. Christ’s Hospital boys apply it only to bread.\r\n\r\n~Crumbs~, “to pick up one’s CRUMBS,” to begin to have an appetite after\r\nan illness; to improve in health, circumstances, &c., after a loss\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n~Crummy~, fat, plump.—_North._ In London street slang, lousy.\r\n\r\n~Crummy-doss~, a lousy or filthy bed.\r\n\r\n~Crumpet-face~, a face pitted with small-pox marks.\r\n\r\n~Crunch~, to crush.

A cup or goblet, however, is the old\r\nmystic symbol of a juggler. _French_, JOUEUR DE GOBELET.\r\n\r\n~Cure~, an odd person; a contemptuous term, abridged from CURIOSITY,\r\nwhich was formerly the favourite expression. The word cure, as\r\noriginally applied, was London street slang, and was, as just stated, an\r\nabbreviation of curiosity, or, more correctly, of curious or queer\r\nfellow. Of late years it has, however, been used to denote a funny,\r\nhumorous person, who can give and receive chaff.\r\n\r\n~Curios~, a corruption of “curiosities;” any articles of vertu brought\r\nfrom abroad. Used by naval and military travellers and others.\r\n\r\n~Currency~, persons born in Australia are there termed CURRENCY, while\r\nnatives of England are termed STERLING. The allusion is to the\r\ndifference between colonial and imperial moneys, which it may be as well\r\nto remark have no difference so far as actual value is concerned.\r\n\r\n~Curse~, anything worthless. Corruption of the _Old English_ word KERSE,\r\na small sour wild cherry; _French_, CERISE; _German_, KIRSCH. _Vision of\r\nPiers Ploughman_:—\r\n\r\n    “Wisdom and witt nowe is _not worth_ a KERSE,\r\n    But if it be carded with cootis as clothers\r\n    Kembe their woole.”\r\n\r\nThe expression “not worth a CURSE,” used frequently nowadays, is\r\ntherefore not properly profane, though it is frequently intensified by a\r\nprofane expletive. Horne Tooke says from KERSE, or CRESS. The expression\r\n“not worth a tinker’s CURSE,” may or may not have arisen from\r\nmisapplication of the word’s origin, though as now used it certainly\r\nmeans curse in its usual sense. Tinkers do curse, unfortunately, and it\r\nwill take a good deal of school-board work to educate them out of it, as\r\nwell as a fair amount of time. The phrase “not worth a tinker’s damn,”\r\nis evidently a variation of this, unless indeed it should be spelt\r\n“dam,” and used as a reference to the general worthlessness of the wives\r\nand mothers of tinkers. This latter is merely offered to those who are\r\nspeculative in such matters, and is not advanced as an opinion.\r\n\r\n~Curse of Scotland~, the Nine of Diamonds. Various hypotheses have been\r\nset up as to this appellation—that it was the card on which the\r\n“Butcher Duke” wrote a cruel order with respect to the rebels after the\r\nbattle of Culloden; that the diamonds are the nine lozenges in the arms\r\nof Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, detested for his share in the Massacre of\r\nGlencoe; that it is a corruption of Cross of Scotland, the nine diamonds\r\nbeing arranged somewhat after the fashion of a St. Andrew’s Cross. The\r\nfirst supposition is evidently erroneous, for in Dr. Houston’s Memoirs\r\nof his own Lifetime, 1747, p. 92, the Jacobite ladies are stated to have\r\nnicknamed the Nine of Diamonds “the Justice Clerk,” after the rebellion\r\nof 1715, in allusion to the Lord Justice-Clerk Ormistone, who, for his\r\nseverity in suppressing it, was called the Curse of Scotland. Gules a\r\ncross of lozenges were also the arms of Colonel Packer, who attended\r\nCharles I. on the scaffold, and commanded in Scotland afterwards with\r\ngreat severity.—_See_ Chatto on the _Origin and History of Playing\r\nCards_, p. 267. The most probable explanation is, that in the game of\r\nPope Joan the nine of diamonds is the POPE, of whom the Scotch have an\r\nespecial horror.\r\n\r\n~Curtail~, to cut off. Originally a Cant word—vide _Hudibras_, and\r\n_Bacchus and Venus_, 1737. Evidently derived from the French _court\r\ntailler_.\r\n\r\n~Cushion~, to hide or conceal.\r\n\r\n~Cushion-smiter~, polite rendering of tub-thumper, a clergyman, a\r\npreacher.\r\n\r\n~Cushmawaunee~, never mind. Sailors and soldiers who have been in India\r\nfrequently say—\r\n\r\n    “CUSHMAWAUNEE,\r\n    If we cannot get arrack,\r\n    We must drink pawnee.”\r\n\r\n        _Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Customer~, synonymous with CHAP, a fellow; “a rum CUSTOMER,” _i.e._, a\r\nman likely to turn the tables on any one who attacked him, and therefore\r\nbetter be let alone, or very warily proceeded with; an “odd fish,” or\r\ncurious person.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Customhouse-officer~, an aperient pill.\r\n\r\n~Cut~, to run away, move off quickly; to cease doing anything; CUT AND\r\nRUN, to quit work, or occupation, and start off at once—_Sea_ phrase,\r\n“CUT the cable and RUN before the wind;” to CUT DIDOES, synonymous with\r\nto CUT CAPERS; CUT A DASH, make a show; CUT A CAPER, to dance or show\r\noff in a strange manner; CUT A FIGURE, to make either a good or bad\r\nappearance; CUT IT, desist, be quiet, go away, leave what you are doing\r\nand run; CUT IT SHORT, cease being prolix, “make short work” of what you\r\nhave in hand; CUT OUT, to excel, thus in affairs of gallantry one Adonis\r\nis said to CUT the other out in the affections of the wished-for\r\nlady—_Sea_ phrase, from CUTTING out a ship from the enemy’s port. CUT\r\nTHAT! be quiet, or stop; CUT OUT OF, done out of; CUT OF ONE’S JIB, the\r\nexpression or cast of his countenance [_see_ JIB]; TO CUT ONE’S COMB, to\r\ntake down a conceited person, from the practice of cutting the combs of\r\ncapons [_see_ COMB CUT]; CUT AND COME AGAIN, plenty, if one cut does not\r\nsuffice, plenty remains to come at again; CUT UP, to mortify, to\r\ncriticise severely, or expose; CUT UP SHINES, to play tricks; CUT ONE’S\r\nSTICK, to be off quickly, _i.e._, to be in readiness for a journey,\r\nfurther elaborated into AMPUTATE YOUR MAHOGANY [_see_ STICK]; CUT IT\r\nFAT, to exaggerate or show off in an extensive manner; to CUT UP FAT, or\r\nCUT UP WELL, to die, leaving a large property; CUT UNDER, to undersell;\r\nCUT YOUR LUCKY, to run off; CUT ONE’S CART, to expose unfair tricks; CUT\r\nAN ACQUAINTANCE, to cease friendly intercourse with him; “CUT UP ROUGH,”\r\nto become obstreperous and dangerous; to have “CUT ONE’S EYE-TEETH,”\r\n_i.e._, to be wide awake, knowing; to DRAW CUTS, to cast lots with\r\npapers of unequal lengths.\r\n\r\n~Cut~, to take cards from a pack, with a view to decide by comparison\r\nwhich persons shall be partners, or which players shall deal. Not less\r\nthan four cards must be picked up by the cutter, and the bottom one is\r\nthe CUT. When cutting for a “turn-up,” the residuum is called the CUT.\r\n\r\n~Cut~, in theatrical language, means to strike out portions of a\r\ndramatic piece, so as to render it shorter for representation. A late\r\ntreasurer of one of the so-called Patent Theatres when asked his opinion\r\nof a new play, always gave utterance to the brief but safe piece of\r\ncriticism, “Wants cutting.”\r\n\r\n~Cut~, tipsy.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Cut~, to compete in business; “a CUTTING trade,” one conducted on\r\ncompetitive principles, where the profits are very closely shaved.\r\n\r\n~Cut-throat~, a butcher, a cattle-slaughterer; a ruffian.\r\n\r\n~Cute~, sharp, cunning.

Of Robin Hood it was said—\r\n\r\n    “So being outlaw’d (as ’tis told),\r\n      He with a crew went forth\r\n    Of lusty CUTTERS, bold and strong,\r\n      And robbed in the north.”\r\n\r\nCUTTER, a swashbuckler—_balaffreux taillebras, fendeur de\r\nnaseaux._—_Cotgrave._\r\n\r\n    “He’s out of cash, and thou know’st by CUTTER’S LAW,\r\n    We are bound to relieve one another.”\r\n\r\n        _Match at Midn._, O. Pl., vii. 553.\r\n\r\nThis ancient cant word now survives in the phrase, “to swear like a\r\nCUTTER.”\r\n\r\n~Cutting-shop~, a place where cheap rough goods are sold.\r\n\r\n~Cutty-pipe~, a short clay pipe. _Scotch_, CUTTY, short.\r\n\r\n~Cutty-sark~, a short chemise.—_Scotch._ A scantily-draped lady is so\r\ncalled by Burns.\r\n\r\n        “‘Weel done, CUTTY-SARK!’\r\n    And in an instant all was dark.”\r\n\r\n~Dab~, or DABSTER, an expert person. Most probably derived from the\r\nLatin _adeptus_.\r\n\r\n~Dab~, street term for small flat fish of any kind.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Dacha-saltee~, tenpence. Probably from the _Lingua Franca_. _Modern\r\nGreek_, δέκα; _Italian_, DIECI SOLDI, tenpence; _Gipsy_, DIK, ten. So\r\nalso DACHA-ONE (oney), _i.e._, _dieci uno_, elevenpence.—_See_ SALTEE.\r\n\r\n~Daddle~, the hand; “tip us your DADDLE,” _i.e._, shake hands.\r\n\r\n~Daddy~, a stage manager.—_Theatrical._ Also the person who gives away\r\nthe bride at a wedding.\r\n\r\n~Daddy;~ at mock raffles, lotteries, &c., the DADDY is an accomplice,\r\nmost commonly the getter-up of the swindle, and in all cases the person\r\nthat has been previously selected to win the prize.\r\n\r\n~Daddy~, the old man in charge—generally an aged pauper—at casual\r\nwards. Most people will remember “kind old DADDY.”\r\n\r\n~Daffy~, gin. A term with monthly nurses, who are always extolling the\r\nvirtues of Daffy’s Elixir, and who occasionally comfort themselves with\r\na stronger medicine under Daffy’s name. Of late years the term has been\r\naltered to “soothing syrup.”\r\n\r\n~Dags~, feat or performance; “I’ll do your DAGS,” _i.e._, I will do\r\nsomething that you cannot do. Corruption of DARINGS.\r\n\r\n~Dairies~, a woman’s breasts, which are also called CHARLIES.\r\n\r\n~Daisy-cutter~, a horse that trots or gallops without lifting its feet\r\nmuch from the ground.\r\n\r\n~Daisy-kicker~, the name ostlers at large inns used to give each other,\r\nnow nearly obsolete. DAISY-KICKER, or GROGHAM, was likewise the cant\r\nterm for a horse. The DAISY-KICKERS were sad rogues in the old posting\r\ndays; frequently the landlords rented the stables to them, as the only\r\nplan to make them return a profit.\r\n\r\n~Damage~, in the sense of recompense; “what’s the DAMAGE?” _i.e._, what\r\nis to pay? or actually, what is the DAMAGE to my pocket?\r\n\r\n~Damper~, a shop till; to DRAW A DAMPER, _i.e._, rob a till. A till is\r\nmore modernly called a “lob,” and stealing from tills is known as\r\n“lob-sneaking.”\r\n\r\n~Dancer, or dancing-master~, a thief who prowls about the roofs of\r\nhouses, and effects an entrance by attic windows, &c. Called also a\r\n“garreter.”\r\n\r\n~Dance upon nothing~, to be hanged.\r\n\r\n~Dander~, passion or temper; “to get one’s DANDER up,” to rouse his\r\npassion.—_Old_, but now much used in America.\r\n\r\n~Dando~, a great eater, who cheats at hotels, eating shops,\r\noyster-cellars, &c., from a person of that name who lived many years\r\nago, and who was an enormous oyster-eater. According to the stories\r\nrelated of him, Dando would visit an oyster-room, devour an almost\r\nfabulous quantity of bivalves, with porter and bread and butter to\r\nmatch, and then calmly state that he had no money.\r\n\r\n~Dandy~, a fop, or fashionable nondescript. This word, in the sense of a\r\nfop, is of modern origin. Egan says it was first used in 1820, and Bee\r\nin 1816. Johnson does not mention it, although it is to be found in all\r\nlate dictionaries. DANDIES wore stays, studied a feminine style, and\r\ntried to undo their manhood by all manner of affectations which were not\r\nactually immoral. Lord Petersham headed them. At the present day dandies\r\nof this stamp have almost entirely disappeared, but the new school of\r\nmuscular Christians is not altogether faultless. The feminine of DANDY\r\nwas DANDIZETTE, but the term only lived for a short season.\r\n\r\n~Dandy~, a small glass of whisky.—_Irish._ “Dimidium cyathi vero apud\r\nMetropolitanos Hibernicos dicitur DANDY.”—_Father Tom and the Pope_, in\r\n_Blackwood’s Magazine_ for May 1838.\r\n\r\n~Dandy~, a boatman.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Dandypratt~, a funny little fellow, a mannikin; originally a\r\nhalf-farthing of the time of Henry VII.\r\n\r\n~Danna~, human ordure; DANNA DRAG, a nightman’s or dustman’s cart;\r\nhence DUNNA-KEN, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Darbies~, handcuffs.—_Old Cant._—_See_ JOHNNY DARBIES. Sir Walter\r\nScott mentions these, in the sense of fetters, in his _Peveril of the\r\nPeak_—\r\n\r\n    “‘Hark ye! Jem Clink will fetch you the DARBIES.’ ‘Derby!’\r\n    interrupted Julian, ‘has the Earl or Countess’”----\r\n\r\nHad Sir Walter known of any connexion between them and this family he\r\nwould undoubtedly have mentioned it. The mistake of Julian is corrected\r\nin the next paragraph. It is said that handcuffs were, when used to keep\r\ntwo prisoners together, called DARBIES and JOANS—a term which would\r\nsoon be shortened as a natural consequence.\r\n\r\n~Darble~, the devil. _French_, DIABLE.\r\n\r\n~Dark~, “keep it DARK,” _i.e._, secret. A DARK horse is, in racing\r\nphraseology, a horse of whom nothing positive is known, but who is\r\ngenerally supposed to have claims to the consideration of all\r\ninterested, whether bookmakers or backers.\r\n\r\n~Darky~, twilight; also a negro. DARKMANS, the night.\r\n\r\n~Darn~, vulgar corruption of DAMN.—_American._\r\n\r\n~Dash~, to jot down suddenly. “Things I have DASHED off at a moment’s\r\nnotice.”\r\n\r\n~Dash~, fire, vigour, manliness. Literary and artistic work is often\r\nsaid to be full of DASH.\r\n\r\n~Dash~, an ejaculation, as “DASH my wig!” “DASH my buttons!” A relic of\r\nthe attempts made, when cursing was fashionable, to be in the mode\r\nwithout using “bad words.”\r\n\r\n~Dashing~, showy, fast.\r\n\r\n~Daub~, in low language, an artist. Also a badly painted picture.\r\n\r\n~David’s sow~, “as drunk as DAVID’S sow,” _i.e._, beastly drunk. _See_\r\norigin of the phrase in Grose’s _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n~Davy~, “on my DAVY,” on my affidavit, of which it is a vulgar\r\ncorruption. Latterly DAVY has become synonymous in street language with\r\nthe name of the Deity; “so help me DAVY,” generally rendered, “swelp my\r\nDAVY.” Slang version of the conclusion of the oath usually exacted of\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n~Davy’s locker~, or DAVY JONES’S LOCKER, the sea, the common receptacle\r\nfor all things thrown overboard;—a nautical phrase for death, is “gone\r\nto DAVY JONES’S LOCKER,” which there means the other world.—_See_\r\nDUFFY.\r\n\r\n~Dawdle~, to loiter, or fritter away time.\r\n\r\n~Dawk~, the post.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Daylights~, eyes; “to darken his DAYLIGHTS,” to give a person black\r\neyes. Also the spaces left in glasses between the liquor and the\r\nbrim,—not allowed when bumpers are drunk. The toast-master in such\r\ncases cries “no DAYLIGHTS or heeltaps!”\r\n\r\n~Daze~, to confound or bewilder; an ancient form of dazzle used by\r\nSpenser, Drayton, &c. This is more obsolete English than slang, though\r\nits use nowadays might fairly bring it within the latter category.\r\n\r\n~Dead-against~, decidedly opposed to.\r\n\r\n~Dead-alive~, stupid, dull.\r\n\r\n~Dead-amiss~, said of a horse that from illness is utterly unable to run\r\nfor a prize.\r\n\r\n~Dead-beat~, utterly exhausted, utterly “done up.”\r\n\r\n~Dead-heat~, when two horses run home so exactly equal that the judge\r\ncannot place one before the other; consequently, a DEAD-HEAT is a heat\r\nwhich counts for nothing, so far as the even runners are concerned, as\r\nit has to be run over again. When a race between dead-heaters has been\r\nunusually severe, or when the stake is sufficiently good to bear\r\ndivision, it is usual to let one of the animals walk over the course so\r\nas to make a deciding heat, and to divide the money. In such case all\r\nbets are divided. Sometimes, however, when no arrangement can be made,\r\nan owner will withdraw his horse, in which case the animal that walks\r\nover wins the whole of the stake, and his backers the whole of their\r\nmoney. Where the course is short and the money of small amount, the\r\nDEAD-HEAT is run off, the second essay being called the decider, though\r\non certain occasions even the decider has resulted in a\r\nDEAD-HEAT.—_See_ NECK AND NECK.\r\n\r\n~Dead-horse~, “to draw the DEAD-HORSE;” DEAD-HORSE work—working for\r\nwages already paid; also any thankless or unassisted service.\r\n\r\n~Dead-letter~, an action of no value or weight; an article, owing to\r\nsome mistake in its production, rendered utterly valueless,—often\r\napplied to any instrument in writing, which by some apparently trivial\r\nomission, becomes useless. At the general and large district\r\npost-offices, there is a department for letters which have been\r\nerroneously addressed, or for which, from many and various causes, there\r\nare no receivers. These are called DEAD-LETTERS, and the office in\r\nconnexion with them is known as the DEAD-LETTER office.\r\n\r\n~Dead-lock~, a permanent standstill, an inextricable entanglement.\r\n\r\n~Dead-lurk~, entering a dwelling-house during divine service.\r\n\r\n~Dead-man~, a baker. Properly speaking, it is an extra loaf smuggled\r\ninto the basket by the man who carries it out, to the loss of the\r\nmaster. Sometimes the DEAD-MAN is charged to a customer, though never\r\ndelivered. Among London thieves and low people generally a “dead’un” is\r\na half-quartern loaf.\r\n\r\n~Dead-men~, the term for wine bottles after they are emptied of their\r\ncontents.—_Old._—_See_ MARINES.\r\n\r\n~Dead-men’s shoes~, property which cannot be claimed until after decease\r\nof present holder. “To wait for a pair of DEAD-MEN’S SHOES,” is\r\nconsidered a wearisome affair. It is used by Fletcher:—\r\n\r\n    “And ’tis a general shrift, that most men use,\r\n    But yet ’tis tedious waiting DEAD MEN’S SHOES.”\r\n\r\n        _Fletcher’s Poems_, p. 256.\r\n\r\n~Dead-set~, a pointed and persistent attack on a person.\r\n\r\n~Dead’un~, a horse which will not run or will not try in a race, and\r\nagainst which money may be betted with safety.—_See_ SAFE UN.\r\n\r\n~Deaner~, a shilling. From DENIER.\r\n\r\n~Death~, “to dress to DEATH,” _i.e._, to the very extreme of fashion,\r\nperhaps so as to be killing.\r\n\r\n~Death-hunter~, a running patterer, who vends last dying speeches and\r\nconfessions. More modernly the term is supposed to mean an undertaker,\r\nor any one engaged in or concerned with burials.\r\n\r\n~Deck~, a pack of cards. Used by Shakspeare, 3 _K. Hen. VI._, v. 1.\r\nProbably because of DECKING or arranging the table for a game at cards.\r\nGeneral in the United States.\r\n\r\n~Dee~, a pocket-book; term used by tramps.—_Gipsy._ DEE (properly D), a\r\ndetective policeman. “The DEES are about, so look out.”\r\n\r\n~Delicate~, a false subscription-book carried by a LURKER.\r\n\r\n~Demirep~ (or DEMIRIP), a courtezan. Contraction of DEMI-REPUTATION,\r\nwhich is, in turn, a contraction for _demi-monde_ reputation.\r\n\r\n~Derby-dog~, a masterless animal, who is sure to appear as soon as the\r\nEpsom course is cleared for the great race of the season. No year passes\r\nwithout a dog running between the two dense lines of spectators and\r\nsearching in vain for an outlet, and he is almost as eagerly looked for\r\nas are the “preliminary canters.” It is said that when no DERBY-DOG\r\nappears on the course between Tattenham Corner and the judge’s box, just\r\nbefore the start, a dead-heat will take place between all the placed\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n~Derrick~, an apparatus for raising sunken ships, &c. The term is\r\ncuriously derived from a hangman of that name frequently mentioned in\r\nOld Plays, as in the _Bellman of London_, 1616.\r\n\r\n    “He rides circuit with the devil, and DERRICK must be his host, and\r\n    Tyborne the inn at which he will light.”\r\n\r\nThe term is now almost general for all cranes used in loading ships, or\r\ndoing similar work of a heavy nature.\r\n\r\n~Despatchers~, false dice with two sets of numbers, and, of course, no\r\nlow pips. So called because they bring the matter to a speedy issue.\r\nGreat skill in palming is necessary for their successful use.\r\n\r\n~Deuce~, the devil.—_Old._ Stated by _Junius_ and others to be from\r\nDEUS or ZEUS.\r\n\r\n~Deuce~, twopence; DEUCE at cards or dice, one with two pips or spots.\r\n\r\n~Devil~, among barristers, to get up the facts of a case for a leader;\r\nto arrange everything in the most comprehensive form, so that the Q.C.\r\nor Serjeant can absorb the question without much trouble. DEVILLING is\r\njuniors’ work, but much depends on it, and on the ability with which it\r\nis done.\r\n\r\n~Devil~, a printer’s youngest apprentice, an errand-boy in a\r\nprinting-office.\r\n\r\n~Devil dodger~, a clergyman; also a person who goes sometimes to church\r\nand sometimes to meeting.\r\n\r\n~Devil-may-care~, reckless, rash.\r\n\r\n~Devil’s bed-posts~, the four of clubs.

Generally used\r\nthus:—“They kicked up the DEVIL’S DELIGHT.”\r\n\r\n~Devil’s dung~, the fetid drug assafœtida.\r\n\r\n~Devil’s dust~, a term used in the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire\r\nto denote shreds of old cloth torn up to re-manufacture; also called\r\nSHODDY. Mr. Ferrand, in his speech in the House, March 4, 1842, produced\r\na piece of cloth made chiefly from DEVIL’S DUST, and tore it into shreds\r\nto prove its worthlessness.—_See Hansard’s Parliamentary Debates_,\r\nthird series, vol. lxi. p. 140.\r\n\r\n~Devil-scolder~, a clergyman.\r\n\r\n~Devil’s livery~, black and yellow. From the mourning and quarantine\r\nuses of the colours.\r\n\r\n~Devil’s teeth~, or DEVIL’S BONES, dice.\r\n\r\n~Devotional habits~, horses weak in the knees, and apt to stumble and\r\nfall, are said to have these.—_Stable._\r\n\r\n~Dew-beaters~, feet; “hold out your DEW-BEATERS till I take off the\r\ndarbies.”—_Peveril of the Peak._ Forby says the word is used in Norfolk\r\nfor heavy shoes to resist wet.\r\n\r\n~Dew-drink~, a morning draught, such as is served out to labourers in\r\nharvest time before commencing work.\r\n\r\n~Dewskitch~, a good thrashing, perhaps from catching one’s due.\r\n\r\n~Dibbs~, money; so called from the huckle bones of sheep, which have\r\nbeen used from the earliest times for gambling purposes when money was\r\nnot obtainable—in one particular game being thrown up five at a time\r\nand caught on the back of the hand like halfpence.\r\n\r\n~Dick~, a riding whip; gold-headed DICK, one so ornamented.\r\n\r\n~Dick~, abbreviation of “Dictionary,” but often euphemistically rendered\r\n“Richard,”—fine language, long words. A man who uses fine words without\r\nmuch judgment is said to have “swallowed the DICK.”\r\n\r\n~Dickens~, synonymous with devil; “what the DICKENS are you after?” what\r\nthe devil are you doing? Used by Shakspeare in the _Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor_. In many old stories his Satanic Majesty is called the DICKENS,\r\nand by no other name, while in some others the word is spelt “diconce.”\r\n\r\n~Dickey~, bad, sorry, or foolish; food or lodging is pronounced DICKEY\r\nwhen of a poor description; “very DICKEY”, very inferior; “it’s all\r\nDICKEY with him,” _i.e._, all over with him.\r\n\r\n~Dickey~, formerly the cant for a worn-out shirt, but nowadays used for\r\na front or half-shirt. DICKEY was originally “tommy” (from the Greek,\r\nτομή, a section), a name which was formerly used in Trinity College,\r\nDublin. The students are said to have invented the term, and love of\r\nchange and circumlocution soon changed it to DICKEY, in which dress it\r\nis supposed to have been imported into England.\r\n\r\n~Dickey~, a donkey.—_Norfolk._\r\n\r\n~Dickey Sam~, a native of Liverpool.\r\n\r\n~Dicking;~ “look! the bulky is DICKING,” _i.e._, the constable has his\r\neye on you.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Diddle~, old cant word for geneva, or gin.\r\n\r\n~Diddle~, to cheat, or defraud.—_Old._ In _German_, DUDELN is to play\r\non the bagpipe; and the ideas of piping and cheating seem to have been\r\nmuch connected. “Do you think I am easier played on than a pipe?” occurs\r\nin _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\n~Diddler~, or JEREMY DIDDLER, an artful swindler. A diddler is generally\r\none who borrows money without any intention of ever repaying it; the\r\nsort of man who, having asked for half-a-crown and received only a\r\nshilling, would consider that eighteenpence was owing to him.—From\r\n_Raising the Wind_.\r\n\r\n~Diddling~, cheating or swindling. Borrowing money without any intention\r\nof repaying it. Edgar Allan Poe wrote a very amusing article once on\r\nDIDDLING, which he seemed to regard as a rather high art.\r\n\r\n~Didoes~, pranks or capers; “to cut up DIDOES,” to make pranks.\r\n\r\n~Dig~, a hard blow. Generally in pugilistic circles applied to a\r\nstraight “left-hander,” delivered under the guard on the “mark.”\r\n\r\n~Diggers~, spurs; also the spades on cards.\r\n\r\n~Diggings~, lodgings, apartments, residence; an expression probably\r\nimported from California, or Australia, with reference to the gold\r\ndiggings. It is very common nowadays for a man moving in very decent\r\nsociety to call his abode or his office, or anyplace to which he\r\nfrequently resorts, his “DIGGINGS.”\r\n\r\n~Dilly~, originally a coach, from _diligence_. Now a night-cart.\r\n\r\n~Dilly-dally~, to trifle.\r\n\r\n~Dimber~, neat or pretty.—_Worcestershire_, but old cant.\r\n\r\n~Dimber-damber~, very pretty; a clever rogue who excels his fellows;\r\nchief of a gang. _Old Cant_ in the latter sense.\r\n\r\n~Dimmock~, money; “how are you off for DIMMOCK?” diminutive of DIME, a\r\nsmall foreign silver coin, in the United States 10 cents.\r\n\r\n~Dinarly~, money; “NANTEE DINARLY,” I have no money, corrupted from the\r\n_Lingua Franca_, “NIENTE DINARO,” not a penny. _Turkish_, DINARI;\r\n_Spanish_, DINERO; _Latin_, DENARIUS.\r\n\r\n~Dine out~, to go without dinner. “I DINED OUT to-day,” would express\r\nthe same among the very lower classes that “dining with Duke Humphrey”\r\nexpresses among the middle and upper.\r\n\r\n~Ding~, to strike; to throw away, or get rid of anything; to pass to a\r\nconfederate by throwing. _Old_, used in old plays.\r\n\r\n    “The butcher’s axe (like great Alcides’ bat)\r\n      _Dings_ deadly downe ten thousand thousand flat.”\r\n\r\n        _Taylor’s Works_, 1630.\r\n\r\n~Dingy~, a small boat. Generally the smallest boat carried by a ship.\r\nThe _g_ in this is pronounced hard.\r\n\r\n~Dipped~, mortgaged.\r\n\r\n~Dirt~, TO EAT, an expression derived from the East, nearly the same as\r\n“to eat humble (_Umble_) pie,” to put up with a mortification or insult.\r\n\r\n~Dirty Half-hundred~, a nickname given to the 50th Regiment on account\r\nof their tattered and soiled appearance during the Peninsular War. A\r\nterm to be proud of, as it implies much work and little reward.\r\n\r\n~Disguised~, intoxicated. A very old term is that of “DISGUISED in\r\ndrink.”\r\n\r\n    “Some say drinking does DISGUISE men.”—_Old Song._\r\n\r\n    “The saylers and the shipmen all,\r\n      Through foul excesse of wine,\r\n    Were so DISGUISED that at the sea\r\n      They shew’d themselves like swine.”\r\n\r\n        _Thos. Deloney’s Strange Histories_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n~Dish~, to stop, to do away with, to suppress; DISHED, done for,\r\nfloored, beaten, or silenced. To “do brown” and to “DISH,” both verbs\r\nwith very similar meanings, have an evident connexion so far as origin\r\nis concerned, and most likely were both first used in the kitchen as\r\nsynonymous with “done for.” The late Lord Derby made the word “DISH”\r\nfamous by his latest public act, that of “DISHING the Whigs.”\r\n\r\n~Dithers~, nervous or cold shiverings; “it gave me the DITHERS.”\r\n\r\n~Dittoes~, A SUIT OF, coat, waistcoat, and trousers of the same\r\nmaterial.—_Tailor’s term._\r\n\r\n~Ditty-bag~, the bag or huswife in which sailors keep needles, thread,\r\nbuttons, &c., for mending their clothes.\r\n\r\n~Diver~, a pickpocket. Also applied to fingers, no doubt from a similar\r\nreason. To DIVE is to pick pockets.\r\n\r\n~Do~, this useful and industrious verb has for many years done service\r\nas a slang term. To DO a person is to cheat him. Sometimes another tense\r\nis employed, such as “I DONE him,” meaning, I cheated or “paid him out;”\r\nthis is only used in the lowest grades of society. DONE BROWN, cheated\r\nthoroughly, befooled; DONE OVER, upset, cheated, knocked down, ruined.\r\nAmong thieves DONE OVER means that a man’s pockets have been all quietly\r\nsearched; the term also means among low people seduced; DONE UP, used\r\nup, finished, or quieted. DONE also means convicted, or sentenced; so\r\ndoes DONE-FOR. To DO a person in pugilism is to beat him. Humphreys, who\r\nfought Mendoza, a Jew, wrote this laconic note to his supporter—“I have\r\nDONE the Jew, and am in good health.—Rich. Humphreys.” Tourists use the\r\nexpression, “I have DONE France and Italy,” meaning I have been through\r\nthose countries.\r\n\r\n~Dobie~, an Indian washerman; and though women wash clothes in this\r\ncountry, Anglo-Indians speak of a washerwoman as a DOBIE.\r\n\r\n~Doctor~, to adulterate or drug liquor; to poison, to hocus; also to\r\nfalsify accounts. A publican who sells bad liquors is said to keep the\r\nDOCTOR in his cellars. On board ship the cook is always termed “the\r\nDOCTOR.”—_See_ COOK.\r\n\r\n~Doddy~, a term applied in Norfolk to any person of low stature.\r\nSometimes HODMANDOD and “HODDY-DODDY, all head and no body.” DODMAN in\r\nthe same dialect denotes a garden snail.\r\n\r\n~Dodge~, a cunning trick. “DODGE, that homely but expressive\r\nphrase.”—Sir Hugh Cairns on the Reform Bill, 2nd March, 1859.\r\n_Anglo-Saxon_, DEOGIAN, to colour, to conceal. The TIDY DODGE, as it is\r\ncalled by street-folk, consists in dressing up a family clean and tidy,\r\nand parading in the streets to excite compassion and obtain alms.\r\n\r\n~Dodger~, a dram. In Kent, a DODGER signifies a nightcap; which name is\r\noften given to the last dram at night.\r\n\r\n~Dodger~, a tricky person, or one who, to use the popular phrase, “knows\r\ntoo much.” Also one who knows all phases of London life, and profits by\r\nsuch knowledge.\r\n\r\n~Dogberry~, a foolish constable.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Dog cheap~, or DOG-FOOLISH, very or singularly cheap, or foolish.\r\nLatham, in his _English Language_, says:—“This has nothing to do with\r\ndogs. The first syllable is god = _good_, transposed, and the second,\r\nthe ch‑‑p, is chapman, merchant: compare EASTCHEAP.”—_Old term._\r\n\r\n~Doggery~, nonsense, transparent attempts to cheat.\r\n\r\n~Dog gone~, a form of mild swearing used by boys.\r\n\r\n~Dog in a blanket~, a kind of pudding, made of preserved fruit spread on\r\nthin dough, and then rolled up and boiled. This pudding is also called\r\n“rolly-polly” and “stocking.”\r\n\r\n~Dog in the manger~, a scurvy, ill-conditioned, selfish fellow. From the\r\nfable of that title.\r\n\r\n~Dog Latin~, barbarous Latin, such as was formerly used by lawyers in\r\ntheir pleadings. Now applied to medical Latin.\r\n\r\n~Dogs~, TO GO TO THE, to be commercially or socially ruined. Originally\r\na stable term applied to old or worthless horses, sold to feed hounds.\r\n\r\n~Dog’s body~, a kind of pease pudding.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Dog’s ears~, the curled corners of the leaves of books, which have been\r\ncarelessly treated. The use of this term is so common that it is hardly\r\nto be considered slang.\r\n\r\n~Dog’s nose~, gin and beer, so called from the mixture being _cold_,\r\nlike a dog’s nose.\r\n\r\n~Dog stealer~, a DOG DEALER. There is sometimes less difference between\r\nthe two trades than between “d” and “st.”\r\n\r\n~Doing time~, working out a sentence in prison. “He’s done time,” is a\r\nslang phrase used in reference to a man who is known to have been in\r\ngaol.\r\n\r\n~Doldrums~, difficulties, low spirits, dumps.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Dollop~, a lump or portion.—_Norfolk._ _Anglo-Saxon_, DALE, _dole_.\r\n\r\n~Dollop~, to _dole up_, to give up a share.—_Ibid._\r\n\r\n~Dolly~, a very mild gambling contrivance, generally used in sweetmeat\r\nand other child’s-ware shops, until stopped by the authorities a few\r\nyears back, and consisting of a round board and the figure of an old man\r\nor “DOLLY,” down which was a spiral hole. A marble dropped “down the\r\nDOLLY,” would stop in one of the small holes or pits (numbered) on the\r\nboard. The bet was decided according as the marble stopped on a high or\r\nlow figure. _See_ DOLLY-SHOP.\r\n\r\n~Dollymop~, a tawdrily-dressed maid-servant, a semi-professional\r\nstreet-walker.\r\n\r\n~Dolly shop~, an illegal pawnshop,—where goods, or stolen property, not\r\ngood enough for the pawnbroker, are received, and charged at so much per\r\nday. If not redeemed the third day the goods are forfeited. Originally\r\nthese shops were rag shops as well, and were represented by the _black\r\ndoll_, the usual sign of a rag shop. Twenty years ago, a DOLLY SHOP was,\r\namong boys, a small sweetstuff and fruit shop where a hollow wooden\r\nfigure, of the kind described above, was kept. A wager was made, and the\r\ncustomer got double quantity for his money, or nothing. A paternal\r\nlegislature, and a police system worthy of the task, have long since\r\nwiped this blot from a nation’s face. The amount at stake was generally\r\na halfpenny, sometimes less.\r\n\r\n~Dominie~, a parson, or master at a grammar school.\r\n\r\n~Domino~, a common ejaculation of soldiers and sailors when they receive\r\nthe last lash of a flogging. The allusion may be understood from the\r\ngame of dominoes. A DOMINO means either a blow, or the last of a series\r\nof things, whether pleasant or otherwise, so the ejaculation savours\r\nsomewhat of wit.\r\n\r\n~Dominoes~, the teeth.\r\n\r\n~Don~, a clever fellow, the opposite of a muff; a person of distinction\r\nin his line or walk. At the English Universities, the Masters and\r\nFellows are the DONS. DON is also used as an adjective, “a DON hand at a\r\nknife and fork,” _i.e._, a first-rate feeder at a dinner-table.\r\n\r\n~Dona and feeles~, a woman and children. _Italian_ or _Lingua Franca_,\r\nDONNE E FIGLIE. The word DONA is usually pronounced DONER.\r\n\r\n~Done!~ the expression used when a bet is accepted. To be DONE, is to be\r\nconsiderably worsted.—_See_ also DO.\r\n\r\n~Done up~, an equivalent expression to “dead beat.”\r\n\r\n~Donkey~, “tuppence more and up goes the DONKEY,” a vulgar street phrase\r\nfor extracting as much money as possible before performing any task. The\r\nphrase had its origin with a travelling showman, the finale of whose\r\nperformance was the hoisting of a DONKEY on a pole or ladder; but this\r\nconsummation was never arrived at unless the required amount was first\r\npaid up, and “tuppence more” was generally the sum demanded.\r\n\r\n~Donkey~, in printers’ slang, means a compositor. In the days before\r\nsteam machinery was invented, the men who worked at press—the\r\npressmen—were so dirty and drunken a body that they earned the name of\r\npigs. In revenge, and for no reason that can be discovered, they\r\nchristened the compositors DONKEYS.\r\n\r\n~Don Pedro~, a game at cards. It is a compound of All Fours, and the\r\nIrish game variously termed All Fives, Five and Ten, Fifteen,\r\nForty-five, &c. It was probably invented by the mixed English and Irish\r\nrabble who fought in Portugal in 1832-3.\r\n\r\n~Dookin~, fortune-telling. _Gipsy_, DUKKERIN.\r\n\r\n~Dose~, three months’ imprisonment with hard labour.\r\n\r\n~Doss~, a bed. Probably from DOZE, though quite as likely from DORSE,\r\nthe back. Least likely of all, as any one who knows aught about the\r\nsurrounding circumstances of those who use the term will admit, is it\r\nfrom the Norman, DOSSEL, a hanging or bed canopy, from which some have\r\nprofessed to derive it.\r\n\r\n~Doss~, to sleep, formerly spelt DORSE. _Gael._, DOSAL, slumber. In the\r\nold pugilistic days a man knocked down, or out of time, was said to be\r\n“sent to DORSE,” but whether because he was senseless, or because he lay\r\non his back, is not known, though most likely the latter.\r\n\r\n~Dossing-ken~, a lodging-house.\r\n\r\n~Dot and go one~, a lame or limping man.\r\n\r\n~Do the high~, to walk up and down High Street on Sunday evenings,\r\nespecially just after Church.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Double~, “to tip (or give) the DOUBLE,” to run away from any person; to\r\ndouble back, turn short round upon one’s pursuers, and so escape, as a\r\nhare does.—_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Double cross~, a CROSS in which a man who has engaged to lose breaks\r\nhis engagement, and “goes straight” at the last moment. This proceeding\r\nis called “doubling” or “putting the double on,” and is often productive\r\nof much excitement in athletic circles.—_See_ CROSS.\r\n\r\n~Double lines~, ship casualties. So called at Lloyd’s from the manner of\r\nentering in books kept for the purpose.\r\n\r\n~Double-shuffle~, a low, shuffling, noisy dance, common amongst\r\ncostermongers. Sometimes called “cellar flap,” from its being danced by\r\nthe impecunious on the cellar-flaps of public-houses, outside which they\r\nmust perforce remain.\r\n\r\n~Doublet~, a spurious diamond, made up of two smaller stones for pawning\r\nor duffing purposes. These articles are cleverly manufactured and\r\nexcellently set, and a practised eye can alone detect the\r\nimposition.—_See_ MOSKENEER.\r\n\r\n~Double up~, to pair off, or “chum” with another man; to beat severely,\r\nso as to leave the sufferer “all of a heap.”\r\n\r\n~Doughy~, a sufficiently obvious nickname for a baker.\r\n\r\n~Douse~, to put out; “DOUSE that glim,” put out that candle. In Norfolk\r\nthis expression is DOUT, which is clearly for DO OUT. Sometimes DOUSE\r\nmeans to rinse; and sometimes to throw water, clean or dirty, over any\r\none, is to “DOUSE it.”\r\n\r\n~Dovercourt~, a noisy assemblage; “all talkers and no hearers, like\r\nDOVERCOURT.” At Dovercourt, in Essex, a court is annually held; and as\r\nthe members principally consist of rude fishermen, the irregularity\r\nnoticed in the proverbial saying frequently prevails. Bramston in his\r\n_Art of Politics_ says:—\r\n\r\n    “Those who would captivate the well-bred throng,\r\n    Should not too often speak, nor speak too long;\r\n    Church, nor church matters, ever turn to sport,\r\n    Nor make St. Stephen’s Chapel DOVER COURT.”\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be more properly applied to a Court of Dover people,\r\na DOVER COURT, not a DOVERCOURT COURT.\r\n\r\n~Dove-tart~, a pigeon pie. A snake tart is an eel pie.\r\n\r\n~Dowd~, a woman’s nightcap.—_Devonshire_: also an American term;\r\npossibly from DOWDY, a slatternly woman.\r\n\r\n~Dowlas~, a linendraper. DOWLAS is a sort of towelling.\r\n\r\n~Down~, to be aware of, or awake to, any move—in this meaning,\r\nexchangeable with UP; “DOWN upon one’s luck,” unfortunate; “DOWN in the\r\nmouth,” disconsolate; “to be DOWN on one,” to treat him harshly or\r\nsuspiciously, to pounce upon him, or detect his tricks.\r\n\r\n~Downer~, a sixpence; apparently the Gipsy word, TAWNO, “little one,” in\r\ncourse of metamorphosis into the more usual “tanner.”\r\n\r\n~Downs~, Tothill Fields’ Prison.\r\n\r\n~Down the road~, stylish, showy, after the fashion.\r\n\r\n~Down to the ground~, an American rendering of the word entirely; as,\r\n“that suits me DOWN TO THE GROUND.”\r\n\r\n~Downy~, knowing or cunning; “a DOWNY COVE,” a knowing or experienced\r\nsharper. Literally, a DOWNY person is one who is “DOWN to every move on\r\nthe board.” In Norfolk, however, it means low-spirited, _i.e._, DOWN in\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\n~Dowry~, a lot, a great deal; “DOWRY of parny,” lot of rain or\r\nwater.—_See_ PARNY. Probably from the Gipsy.\r\n\r\n~Dowsers~, men who profess to tell fortunes, and who, by the use of the\r\ndivining rod, pretend to be able to discover treasure-trove.—_Cornish._\r\n\r\n~Doxy~, the female companion of a tramp or beggar. In the West of\r\nEngland, the women frequently call their little girls DOXIES, in a\r\nfamiliar or endearing sense. _Orthodoxy_ has been described as being a\r\nman’s own DOXY, and _heterodoxy_ another man’s DOXY.—_Ancient Cant._\r\n\r\n~Drab~, a vulgar or low woman.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Drab~, poison.—_Romany._\r\n\r\n~Draft on Aldgate Pump~, an old mercantile phrase for a fictitious\r\nbanknote or fraudulent bill.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, a cart of any kind, term generally used to denote any\r\nparticularly well-appointed turnout, drawn by a pair or four horses,\r\nespecially at race meetings.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, feminine attire worn by men. A recent notorious impersonation\r\ncase led to the publication of the word in that sense.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, a street, or road; BACK-DRAG, back street.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, or THREE MOON, three months in prison.\r\n\r\n~Drag~, THE, a favourite pursuit with fast-hunting sets; as, THE DRAG\r\ncan be trailed over very stiff country.\r\n\r\n~Dragging~, robbing carts, &c., by means of a light trap which follows\r\nbehind laden vehicles. Cabs are sometimes eased of trunks in this way,\r\nthough it is hard to say whether with or without the complicity of the\r\ncabmen.\r\n\r\n~Dragging time~, the evening of a country fair day, when the young\r\nfellows begin pulling the wenches about.\r\n\r\n~Draggletail~, a dirty, dissipated woman; a prostitute of the lowest\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n~Drain~, a drink; “to do a DRAIN,” to take a friendly drink—“do a wet;”\r\nsometimes called a “common sewer.”\r\n\r\n~Draw~, used in several senses:—1, of a theatre, new piece or\r\nexhibition, when it attracts the public and succeeds; 2, to induce—as,\r\n“DRAW him on;” 3, of pocket-picking—as, “DRAW his wipe,” “DRAW his\r\nticker.” In sporting parlance it is used with an ellipsis of “trigger,”\r\n“I DREW on it as it rose.” In America to “DRAW on a man” is to produce\r\nknife or pistol, and to use it as well. Where lethal weapons are used in\r\nthe States, no man raises his weapon till he means to use it, and a\r\ncelebrated American writer has recently given a dissertation on the\r\nrelative advantages of cocking and firing a pistol by an almost\r\nsimultaneous action as it is raised, and of cocking as the instrument is\r\nraised, and of then dropping the muzzle slightly as the trigger is\r\npulled. The former way is more speedy, the latter more effective. “Come,\r\nDRAW it mild!” _i.e._, don’t exaggerate; opposite of “come it strong,”\r\nfrom the phraseology of the bar (of a “public”), where customers desire\r\nthe beer to be “drawn mild.”\r\n\r\n~Draw-boy~, a cunning device used by puffing tradesmen. A really good\r\narticle is advertised or ticketed and exposed for sale in the shop\r\nwindow at a very low price, with a view of drawing in customers to\r\npurchase other and inferior articles at high prices. These gentry have\r\nfortunately found to their cost, on one or two occasions, by means of\r\nmagisterial decisions, that DRAW-BOYS have drawn for their owners\r\nsomething other than profit.\r\n\r\n~Drawers~, formerly the ancient cant name for very long stockings.\r\n\r\n~Drawing teeth~, wrenching off knockers.—_Medical Student slang._\r\n\r\n~Drawlatch~, a loiterer.\r\n\r\n~Draw off~, to throw back the body to give impetus to a blow; “he DREW\r\nOFF, and delivered on the left drum.”—_Pugilistic._ A sailor would say,\r\n“he hauled off and slipped in.”\r\n\r\n~Draw the long bow~, to tell extravagant stories, to exaggerate\r\novermuch; same as “throw the hatchet.” From the extremely wonderful\r\nstories which used to be told of the Norman archers, and more\r\nsubsequently of Indians’ skill with the tomahawk.\r\n\r\n~Dress a hat~, TO, to rob in a manner very difficult of detection. The\r\nbusiness is managed by two or more servants or shopmen of different\r\nemployers, exchanging their master’s goods; as, for instance, a\r\nshoemaker’s shopman receives shirts or other articles from a hosier’s,\r\nin return for a pair of boots. Another very ingenious method may be\r\nwitnessed about eleven o’clock in the forenoon in any of the suburban\r\ndistricts of London. A butcher’s boy, with a bit of steak filched from\r\nhis master’s shop, or from a customer, falls in with a neighbouring\r\nbaker’s man, who has a loaf obtained in a similar manner. Their mutual\r\nfriend, the potboy, in full expectation of their visit, has the tap-room\r\nfire bright and clear, and not only cooks the steak, but again, by means\r\nof collusion, this time with the barman or barmaid, “stands a shant of\r\ngatter” as his share. So a capital luncheon is improvised for the three,\r\nwithout the necessity of paying for it; and this practical communistic\r\noperation is styled DRESSING A HAT. Most likely from the fact that a hat\r\nreceives the attention of three or four people before it is properly fit\r\nfor wear.\r\n\r\n~Dripping~, a cook.\r\n\r\n~Drive~, a term used by tradesmen in speaking of business; “he’s DRIVING\r\na roaring trade,” _i.e._, a very good one; hence, to succeed in a\r\nbargain, “I DROVE a good bargain,” _i.e._, got the best end of it. To\r\n“LET DRIVE at one,” to strike out. A man snoring hard is said to be\r\n“DRIVING his pigs to market.”\r\n\r\n~Drive at~, to aim at; “what is he DRIVING AT?” “what does he intend to\r\nimply?” a phrase often used when a circuitous line of argument is\r\nadopted by a barrister, or a strange set of questions asked, the purport\r\nof which is not very evident.\r\n\r\n~Driz~, lace. In a low lodging-house this singular autograph inscription\r\nappeared over the mantelpiece. “Scotch Mary, with DRIZ [lace], bound to\r\nDover and back, please God.” It is a common thing for ignorant or\r\nsuperstitious people to make some mark or sign before going on a\r\njourney, and then to wonder whether it will be there when they return.\r\n\r\n~Driz-fencer~, a person who sells lace.\r\n\r\n~Drop~, “to DROP an acquaintance,” to relinquish a connexion, is very\r\npolite slang. DROPPING is distinguished from cutting by being done\r\ngradually and almost imperceptibly, whereas cutting has outward and\r\nvisible signs which may be unpleasantly resented. To “DROP money” at any\r\nform of speculation or gambling, is to lose it.\r\n\r\n~Drop~, to quit, go off, or turn aside; “DROP the main Toby,” go off the\r\nmain road.\r\n\r\n~Drop~, “to DROP a man,” to knock him down; “to DROP into a person,” to\r\ngive him a thrashing. _See_ SLIP and WALK. “To DROP on a man,” to accuse\r\nor rebuke him suddenly.\r\n\r\n~Drop it~, synonymous with “cut it” or “cheese it.” Probably from the\r\nsignal given in the good old hanging days by the culprit, who used\r\ngenerally to drop a handkerchief when he was ready for the cart to be\r\nmoved from under him.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, a house, a lodging, a street; HAZARD-DRUM, a gambling-house;\r\nFLASH-DRUM, a house of ill-fame.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, the ear.—_Pugilistic._ An example of slang synecdoche.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, as applied to the road, is doubtless from the Wallachian gipsy\r\nword “DRUMRI,” derived from the _Greek_, δρόμος.\r\n\r\n~Drum~, old slang for a ball or rout; afterwards called a hop.\r\n\r\n~Drummer~, a robber who first makes his victims insensible by drugs or\r\nviolence, and then plunders them.\r\n\r\n~Drumsticks~, legs; DRUMSTICK CASES, trousers. The leg of a fowl is\r\ngenerally called a DRUMSTICK.\r\n\r\n~Dryasdust~, an antiquary. From Scott.\r\n\r\n~Dry lodging~, sleeping and sitting accommodation only, without board.\r\nThis is lodging-house keepers’ slang, and is generally used in reference\r\nto rooms let to lodgers who take their meals at their clubs, or in the\r\nCity, according to their social positions.\r\n\r\n~Dry nurse~, when an inferior officer on board ship carries on the duty,\r\non account of the captain’s ignorance of seamanship, the junior officer\r\nis said to DRY-NURSE his captain. Majors and adjutants in the army also\r\nnot unfrequently DRY-NURSE the colonels of their regiments in a similar\r\nmanner. The sergeant who coaches very young officers, is called a “wet\r\nnurse.” The abolition of purchase has, however, considerably modified\r\nall this.\r\n\r\n~D.T.~, a popular abbreviation of delirium tremens; sometimes written\r\nand pronounced _del. trem._ D.T. also often represents the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_.\r\n\r\n~Dub~, to pay or give; “DUB UP,” pay up.\r\n\r\n~Dubash~, a general agent.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Dubber~, the mouth or tongue; “mum your DUBBER,” hold your tongue.\r\n\r\n~Dubsman~, or SCREW, a turnkey.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Ducats~, money.—_Theatrical Slang._\r\n\r\n~Duck~, a bundle of bits of the “stickings” of beef sold for food to the\r\nLondon poor.—_See_ FAGGOT.\r\n\r\n~Ducket~, a ticket of any kind. Generally applied to pawnbroker’s\r\nduplicates and raffle cards. Probably from DOCKET.\r\n\r\n~Ducks~, trousers. _Sea_ term. The expression most in use on land is\r\n“white DUCKS,” _i.e._, white pantaloons or trousers.\r\n\r\n~Ducks and Drakes~, “to make DUCKS AND DRAKES of one’s money,” to throw\r\nit away childishly—derived from children “shying” flat stones on the\r\nsurface of a pool, which they call DUCKS AND DRAKES, according to the\r\nnumber of skips they make.\r\n\r\n~Dudder~, or DUDSMAN, a person who formerly travelled the country as a\r\npedlar, selling gown-pieces, silk waistcoats, &c., to countrymen. In\r\nselling a waistcoat-piece, which cost him perhaps five shillings, for\r\nthirty shillings or two pounds, he would show great fear of the revenue\r\nofficer, and beg the purchasing clodhopper to kneel down in a puddle of\r\nwater, crook his arm, and swear that it might never become straight if\r\nhe told an exciseman, or even his own wife. The term and practice are\r\nnearly obsolete. In Liverpool, however, and at the East-end of London,\r\nmen dressed up as sailors, with pretended silk handkerchiefs and cigars\r\n“only just smuggled from the Indies,” are still to be plentifully found.\r\n\r\n~Dudeen~, or DUDHEEN, a short tobacco-pipe. Common term in Ireland and\r\nthe Irish quarters of London.\r\n\r\n~Duds~, clothes, or personal property. _Gaelic_, DUD; _Ancient Cant_;\r\nalso _Dutch_.\r\n\r\n~Duff~, to cheat, to sell spurious goods, often under pretence of their\r\nbeing stolen or smuggled.\r\n\r\n~Duff~, pudding; vulgar pronunciation of dough.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Duffer~, a hawker of “Brummagem” or sham jewellery, or of shams of any\r\nkind, a fool, a worthless person. DUFFER was formerly synonymous with\r\nDUDDER, and was a general term given to pedlars. It is mentioned in the\r\n_Frauds of London_ (1760) as a word in frequent use in the last century\r\nto express cheats of all kinds.\r\n\r\n~Duffer~, anything of no merit. A term applied by artists to a picture\r\nbelow mediocrity, and by dealers in jewellery to any spurious article.\r\nIt is now general in its application to a worthless fellow.\r\n\r\n~Duffing~, false, counterfeit, worthless.\r\n\r\n~Duffy~, a term for a ghost or spirit among the West Indian negroes. In\r\nall probability the DAVY JONES of sailors, and a contraction thereof\r\noriginally.\r\n\r\n~Duke~, gin, a term amongst livery servants.\r\n\r\n~Duke Humphrey.~ “To dine with DUKE HUMPHREY” is a euphuism for dining\r\nnot at all. Many reasons have been given for the saying, and the one\r\nmost worthy of credence is this:—Some visitors were inspecting the\r\nabbey where the remains of Humphrey Duke of Gloucester lie, and one of\r\nthem was unfortunately shut in, and remained there _solus_ while his\r\ncompanions were feasting at a neighbouring hostelry. He was afterwards\r\nsaid to have dined with DUKE HUMPHREY, and the saying eventually passed\r\ninto a proverb.\r\n\r\n~Dukes~, or DOOKS, the hands, originally modification of the rhyming\r\nslang, “Duke of Yorks,” forks = fingers, hands—a long way round, but\r\nquite true. The word is in very common use among low folk. “Put up your\r\nDOOKS” is a kind invitation to fight.\r\n\r\n~Dukey~, or DOOKEY, a penny gaff, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Dumbfound~, to perplex, to beat soundly till not able to speak.\r\nOriginally a cant word. Johnson cites the _Spectator_ for the earliest\r\nuse. _Scotch_, DUMBFOUNDER.\r\n\r\n~Dummacker~, a knowing or acute person.\r\n\r\n~Dummies~, empty bottles, and drawers in an apothecary’s shop, labelled\r\nso as to give the idea of an extensive stock. Chandlers’ shop keepers\r\nand small general dealers use dummies largely, half-tubs of butter,\r\nbladders of lard, hams, cheeses, &c., being specially manufactured for\r\nthem. Dummies in libraries generally take the form of “Hume and\r\nSmollett’s History of England” and other works not likely to tempt the\r\ngeneral reader.\r\n\r\n~Dummy~, a deaf-and-dumb person; a clumsy, awkward fellow; any one\r\nunusually thick-witted.\r\n\r\n~Dummy~, in three-handed whist the person who holds two hands plays\r\nDUMMY.\r\n\r\n~Dummy~, a pocket-book. In this word the derivation is obvious, being\r\nconnected with DUMB, _i.e._, that which makes no sound. As a thieves’\r\nterm for a pocket-book, it is peculiarly applicable, for the contents of\r\npocket-books, bank-notes and papers, make no noise, while the money in a\r\npurse may betray its presence by chinking.\r\n\r\n~Dump fencer~, a man who sells buttons.\r\n\r\n~Dumpish~, sullen or gloomy.\r\n\r\n~Dumpy~, short and stout.\r\n\r\n~Dun~, to solicit payment.—_Old Cant_, from the French DONNEZ, give; or\r\nfrom JOE DIN, or DUN, a famous bailiff; or simply a corruption of DIN,\r\nfrom the _Anglo-Saxon_ DUNAN, to clamour.\r\n\r\n~Dunderhead~, a blockhead.\r\n\r\n~Dundreary~, an empty swell.\r\n\r\n~Dung~, an operative who works for an employer who does not give full or\r\n“society” wages.\r\n\r\n~Dungaree~, low, common, coarse, vulgar.—_Anglo-Indian._ DUNGAREE is\r\nthe name of a disreputable suburb of Bombay, and also of a coarse blue\r\ncloth worn by sailors.\r\n\r\n    “As smart a young fellow as ever you’d see,\r\n    In jacket and trousers of blue DUNGAREE.”\r\n\r\n~Dunkhorned~, sneaking, shabby. DUNKHORN in Norfolk is the short, blunt\r\nhorn of a beast, and the adjective is applied to a cuckold who has not\r\nspirit to resist his disgrace.\r\n\r\n~Dunnage~, baggage, clothes. Also, a sea term for wood or loose faggots\r\nlaid at the bottom of ships, upon which is placed the cargo.\r\n\r\n~Dunnyken~, originally DANNAKEN, a watercloset.—From DANNA and KEN,\r\nwhich _see_.\r\n\r\n~Durrynacking~, offering lace or any other article as an introduction to\r\nfortune-telling; generally practised by women.\r\n\r\n~Dust~, money; “down with the DUST,” put down the money.—_Ancient._\r\nDean Swift once took for his text, “He who giveth to the poor lendeth to\r\nthe Lord.” His sermon was short. “Now, my brethren,” said he, “if you\r\nare satisfied with the security, down with the DUST.”\r\n\r\n~Dust~, a disturbance, or noise, “to raise a DUST,” to make a row.\r\n\r\n~Dust~, to beat; “DUST one’s jacket,” _i.e._, give him a beating.\r\n\r\n~Dust-hole~, Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge.—_Univ. Slang._\r\n\r\n~Dust-hole~, the Queen’s Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, was so called\r\nuntil comparatively recently, when it was entirely renovated and\r\nrenamed, and now, as the Prince of Wales’s, it is one of the most\r\nfortunate and fashionable theatres in London.\r\n\r\n~Dustoorie~, commission, douceur, bribe.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Dusty~, a phrase used in answering a question where one expects\r\napprobation. “What do you think of this?” “Well, it’s not so DUSTY,”\r\n_i.e._, not so bad; sometimes varied to “none so DUSTY.”\r\n\r\n~Dutch~, or DOUBLE DUTCH, gibberish, or any foreign tongue. “To talk\r\nDOUBLE DUTCH backwards on a Sunday” is a humorous locution for\r\nextraordinary linguistic facility.\r\n\r\n~Dutch auction~, a method of selling goods, adopted by “CHEAP JOHNS,” to\r\nevade the penalties for selling without a licence. The article is\r\noffered all round at a high price, which is then dropped until it is\r\ntaken. DUTCH AUCTIONS need not be illegitimate transactions, and their\r\neconomy (as likewise that of puffing) will be found minutely explained\r\nin Sugden (Lord St. Leonards) “On Vendors and Purchasers.”\r\n\r\n~Dutch concert~, where each performer plays a different tune. Sometimes\r\ncalled a DUTCH MEDLEY when vocal efforts only are used.\r\n\r\n~Dutch consolation~, “thank God it is no worse.” “It might have been\r\nworse,” said a man whom the devil was carrying to hell. “How?” asked a\r\nneighbour. “Well, he’s carrying me—he might have made me carry him.”\r\n\r\n~Dutch courage~, false courage, generally excited by drink—pot-valour.\r\n\r\n~Dutch feast~, where the host gets drunk before his guest.\r\n\r\n~Dutch uncle~, a personage often introduced in conversation, but\r\nexceedingly difficult to describe; “I’ll talk to him like a DUTCH\r\nUNCLE!” conveys the notion of anything but a desirable relation.\r\n\r\n~Earl of Cork~, the ace of diamonds.—_Hibernicism._\r\n\r\n    “‘What do you mean by the Earl of Cork?’ asked Mr. Squander. ‘The\r\n    ace of diamonds, your honour. It’s the worst ace, and the poorest\r\n    card in the pack, and is called the EARL OF CORK, because he’s the\r\n    poorest nobleman in Ireland.’”—_Carleton’s Traits and Stories of\r\n    the Irish Peasantry._\r\n\r\n~Early~, “to get up EARLY,” to prepare for a difficult task. “You’ll\r\nhave to get up very EARLY in the morning to beat that.” Early rising and\r\nability seem also closely connected by certain modifications of this\r\nexpression. Possibly the belief is that a man who rises early for early\r\nrising’s sake deserves to be clever. Perhaps the greatest enjoyment a\r\nday labourer—whose work commences at six in the winter mornings, and\r\nwho may have to rise at half-past four and trudge off—can have, is a\r\n“quiet snooze” after the usual time of rising. The early rising in “the\r\nsteel” is the chief terror of that institution in the minds of habitual\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n~Earwig~, a clergyman, also one who prompts another maliciously and\r\nprivately.\r\n\r\n~Earwigging~, a private conversation; a rebuke in private; an attempt to\r\ndefame another unfairly, and without chance of appeal; a WIGGING is more\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n~Ease~, to rob; “EASING a bloke,” robbing a man.\r\n\r\n~Eat his head off.~ A horse who is kept idle in the stable is said to\r\nEAT HIS HEAD OFF. Of late the phrase has been applied to servants who\r\nhave little to do but constantly “dip their noses in the manger.”\r\n\r\n~Eavesdropper~, a listener. The name is derived from the punishment\r\nwhich, according to Oliver, was directed in the Lectures, at the revival\r\nof Masonry in 1717, to be inflicted on a detected Cowan [g. v.], and\r\nwhich was\r\n\r\n    “To be placed under the eaves of the house in rainy weather, till\r\n    the water runs in at his shoulders and out at his heels.”—_Mackey’s\r\n    Lexicon of Freemasonry._\r\n\r\n~Efter~, a thief who frequents theatres.\r\n\r\n~Egg~, or EGG ON, to excite, stimulate, or provoke one person to quarrel\r\nwith another, &c. From the Anglo-Saxon _eggian_; or possibly a\r\ncorruption of EDGE, or EDGE ON, or even from _agere_, to\r\ndrive.—_Ancient._\r\n\r\n~Egg-flip~, or EGG-HOT, a drink made after the manner of purl and\r\nbishop, with beer, eggs, and spirits made hot and sweetened.\r\n\r\n~Elbow~, “to shake one’s ELBOW,” to play with dice; “to crook one’s\r\nELBOW,” to drink.\r\n\r\n~Elbow grease~, labour, or industry. Anything that is rusty, or in\r\nhousehold work dirty or dingy, is said to require ELBOW GREASE.\r\n\r\n~Elegant extracts~, a Cambridge University title for those students who\r\nhaving failed only slightly in some one subject, and being “plucked”\r\naccordingly, were allowed their degrees. This applied to the “Poll”\r\nlist, as the “Gulf” did to the “Honours.”\r\n\r\n~Elephant~, “to have seen the ELEPHANT,” to be “_up_ to the latest\r\nmove,” or “_down_ to the last new trick;” to be knowing, and not\r\n“green,” &c. Possibly a metaphor taken from the travelling menageries,\r\nwhere the ELEPHANT is the finale of the exhibition.—Originally an\r\nAmericanism. Bartlett gives conflicting examples. General now, however.\r\nA modification of this is “having seen the king.” When a man becomes\r\naware that he has been cheated or imposed on, and does not mean to stand\r\nit any longer, he is said to have seen the king, _i.e._, to have seen\r\nhis adversary’s best card, and to be prepared for it.\r\n\r\n~Elevated~, intoxicated. ELEVATION is the name of a drug-mixture much\r\nused in the fen-counties for keeping up the spirits and preventing ague.\r\nIt consists mainly of opium.\r\n\r\n~Enemy~, time, a clock, the ruthless enemy and tell-tale of idleness and\r\nof mankind generally; “what says the ENEMY?” _i.e._, how goes the time?\r\n\r\n~Essex lion~, a calf. A calf is probably the only lively animal to be\r\nseen in a journey through Essex.\r\n\r\n~Essex stile~, a ditch. A jocular allusion to the peculiarities of the\r\n“low county.”\r\n\r\n~Evaporate~, to go, or run away.\r\n\r\n~Everlasting shoes~, the feet. The barefooted children about the Seven\r\nDials, and other low quarters of London, are said to wear EVERLASTING\r\nSHOES and stockings. Another expression in connexion with this want is,\r\n“the shoes and stockings their mothers gave them.”\r\n\r\n~Everlasting staircase~, the treadmill. Sometimes, but very rarely now\r\ncalled “Colonel Chesterton’s EVERLASTING STAIRCASE,” from the gallant\r\ninventor or improver. Also known as “the STEPPER.”\r\n\r\n~Exasperate~, to over-aspirate the letter H, or to aspirate it whenever\r\nit commences a word, as is commonly done by under-educated people who\r\nwish to show off their breeding. EXASPERATION does not refer to an\r\nomission of the aspirate.\r\n\r\n~Exes~, expenses. “Just enough to clear our exes.”\r\n\r\n~Extensive~, frequently applied in a slang sense to a person’s\r\nappearance or talk; “rather EXTENSIVE that!” intimating that the person\r\nalluded to is showing off, or “cutting it fat.”\r\n\r\n~Extracted~, placed on the list of “ELEGANT EXTRACTS.”—_Camb. Univ._\r\n\r\n~Eye teeth~, supposed evidences of sharpness. A man is said to have, or\r\nhave not, cut his EYE TEETH, according to possession or want of\r\nshrewdness.\r\n\r\n~Eye water~, gin. Term principally used by printers.\r\n\r\n~Face~, credit at a public-house, impudence, confidence, brass; thus a\r\nBRAZEN-FACE. “To run one’s FACE,” is to obtain credit in a bounceable\r\nmanner. “He’s got some FACE,” _i.e._, he has got lots of impudence.\r\n\r\n~Face entry~, the entrée to a theatre. From the FACE being known, as\r\ndistinguished from free-list entry.\r\n\r\n~Facer~, a blow on the face. In Ireland, a dram.\r\n\r\n~Facer~, a tumbler of whisky-punch. Possibly from the suffusion of blood\r\nto the face caused by it.\r\n\r\n~Fad~, a hobby, a favourite pursuit.\r\n\r\n~Fadge~, a farthing.\r\n\r\n~Fadge~, a flat loaf.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Fadge~, to suit or fit; “it wont FADGE,” it will not do. Used by\r\nShakspeare, but now heard only in the streets.\r\n\r\n~Fadger~, a glazier’s frame. Otherwise called a “frail,” perhaps in\r\nreference to the fragile nature of its contents.\r\n\r\n~Fag~, a schoolboy who performs a servant’s offices to a superior\r\nschoolmate. From FAG, to become weary or tired out. _Low German_, FAKK,\r\nwearied.\r\n\r\n~Fag~, to beat.\r\n\r\n~Faggot~, a bundle of bits of the “stickings” (hence probably its name)\r\nsold for food to the London poor. It is sometimes called a duck. In\r\nappearance it resembles a Scotch “haggis,” without, however, being\r\nnearly so good as that fragrant article. Probably the FAG-END of a\r\nthing, the inferior or remaining part, the refuse.\r\n\r\n~Faggot~, a term of opprobrium used by low people to children and women;\r\n“you little FAGGOT, you!” FAGGOT was originally a term of contempt for a\r\ndry shrivelled old woman, whose bones were like a bundle of sticks, only\r\nfit to burn.—Compare the French expression for a heretic, _sentir le\r\nfagot_.\r\n\r\n~Faggot briefs~, bundles of worthless papers tied up with red tape,\r\ncarried by unemployed barristers in the back rows of the courts to\r\nsimulate briefs.\r\n\r\n~Faggot vote~, a phrase which belongs to the slang of politics, and\r\nwhich was applied to a class of votes, by no means extinct even now,\r\nthough not so common as in the days preceding the first Reform Bill,\r\nwhen constituencies were smaller, and individual votes were consequently\r\nmore valuable. FAGGOT VOTES were thus created:—A large landowner who\r\nwas blessed with, say, seven sons and seven brothers, and had also on\r\nhis estate fourteen labourers’ cottages worth about a shilling a week\r\neach, would go through the form of sale of one cottage to each son and\r\neach brother, it being perfectly understood that the title-deeds would\r\nbe returned when the occasion for their use was at an end. And thus the\r\nsquire would command fifteen votes instead of one. In a famous election\r\nfor the West Riding of Yorkshire during the third decade of the present\r\ncentury, which cost upwards of half a million sterling, and ruined the\r\nsuccessful candidate, it was said that six hundred FAGGOT VOTES were\r\ncreated by three noble lords. The origin of the term has been variously\r\nexplained. One ingenious writer has suggested that as a FAGGOT may be\r\nsplit into a bundle of sticks, so was one estate thus split into a\r\nbundle of votes. It is, however, more reasonable to suppose that it was\r\nderived from the old word “FAGGOT,” which was used to describe a\r\n“nominal soldier,” one, that is, whose name appeared on the muster-roll,\r\nand for whom the colonel drew pay, but who was never to be found in the\r\nranks. The connexion is evident enough.\r\n\r\n~Fake~, in the sporting world, means to hocus or poison. Fake is also a\r\nmixture supposed to be used for purposes of “making safe.”\r\n\r\n~Fake~, to cheat, or swindle; to do anything; to go on, or continue; to\r\nmake or construct; to steal or rob,—a verb variously used. FAKED, done,\r\nor done for; “FAKE away, there’s no down;” go on, there is nobody\r\nlooking. From the _Latin_ FACERE.\r\n\r\n~Fakement~, a false begging petition, any act of robbery, swindling, or\r\ndeception. FAKEMENT is a word of most general application among the\r\nlower classes. Any things strange, and most things not strange, are\r\ncalled FAKEMENTS, particularly if there is anything peculiar or artistic\r\nin their production.\r\n\r\n~Fakement Charley~, the owner’s private mark. FAKER, is one who makes or\r\nFAKES anything. To “fake a cly,” is to pick a pocket.\r\n\r\n~Fal-lals~, trumpery ornaments, gewgaws. Forby suggests as a derivation\r\nthe _Latin_ PHALERÆ, horse trappings.\r\n\r\n~Fambles~, or FAMMS, the hands.—_Ancient Cant._ _German_, FANGEN.\r\n\r\n~Family men~, or PEOPLE, thieves, or burglars.\r\n\r\n~Fan~, a waistcoat.—_Houndsditch term._\r\n\r\n~Fancy~, the favourite sports, pets, or pastime of a person, the ton of\r\nlow life. Pugilists are sometimes termed the FANCY. Shakspeare uses the\r\nword in the sense of a favourite or pet; and the paramour of a\r\nprostitute is still called her FANCY MAN.\r\n\r\n~Fancy bloak~, a fancy or sporting man.\r\n\r\n~Fanning~, a beating. FANNING is also stealing; CROSS-FANNING is\r\nstealing with the arms crossed so as to distract attention, as in\r\nstealing breast-pins, &c.\r\n\r\n~Fanqui~, a European, literally foreign devil.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Fantail~, a dustman’s or coalheaver’s hat. So called from the shape.\r\n\r\n~Farm~, to contract, after the manner of those who engage to feed and\r\nlodge children belonging to the parish, at so much a head; a fruitful\r\ncause of starvation and misery. _See Oliver Twist._ The baby farmings,\r\nunconnected with the parishes in which they occurred, which ultimately\r\nresulted in the trial and execution of Margaret Waters, on the 11th\r\nOctober, 1870, have caused the word FARM as applied to any dealings with\r\nchildren, parish or private, to be one of obloquy and reproach.\r\n\r\n~Farmer.~ In Suffolk this term is applied to the eldest son of the\r\noccupier of the farm. In London it is used derisively of a countryman,\r\nand denotes a farm-labourer or clodpole. Both senses are different from\r\nthe proper meaning.\r\n\r\n~Fast~, gay, spreeish, unsteady, thoughtless,—an Americanism that has\r\nof late ascended from the streets to the drawing-room. The word has\r\ncertainly now a distinct meaning, which it had not thirty years ago.\r\nQUICK is the synonym for FAST, but a QUICK MAN would not convey the\r\nmeaning of a FAST MAN,—a person who, by late hours, gaiety, and\r\ncontinual rounds of pleasure, lives too fast, and wears himself out. In\r\npolite society a FAST young lady is one who affects mannish habits, or\r\nmakes herself conspicuous by some unfeminine accomplishment,—talks\r\nslang, drives about in London, smokes cigarettes, is knowing in dogs,\r\nhorses, &c. An amusing anecdote is told of a fast young lady, the\r\ndaughter of a right reverend prelate, who was an adept in horseflesh.\r\nBeing desirous of ascertaining the opinion of a candidate for\r\nordination, who had the look of a bird of the same feather, as to the\r\nmerits of some cattle just brought to her father’s palace for her to\r\nselect from, she was assured by him they were utterly unfit for a lady’s\r\nuse. With a knowing look at the horses’ points, she gave her decision in\r\nthese choice words, “Well, I agree with you; they _are_ a rum lot, as\r\nthe devil said of the ten commandments.” Charles Dickens once said that\r\n“fast,” when applied to a young man, was only another word for loose, as\r\nhe understood the term; and a fast girl has been defined as a woman who\r\nhas lost her respect for men, and for whom men have lost their respect.\r\n\r\n~Fast~, embarrassed, wanting money, tied up. Sometimes synonymous with\r\n“hard up.”—_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Fast and loose~, to play FAST AND LOOSE with a man, is to treat him as\r\na fast friend in the days while he is useful, and to cast him loose\r\nwhen he is no longer necessary; also, to equivocate or vacillate. In old\r\ndays it was the name of a vulgar pastime. _See_ PRICK THE GARTER.\r\n\r\n~Fat~, a printer’s term signifying the void spaces on a page, for which\r\nhe is paid at the same rate as for full or unbroken pages. Occasionally\r\ncalled “grease,” and applied variously, but always as showing some undue\r\nor uncommon amount of advantage.\r\n\r\n~Fat~, rich, abundant, &c.; “a FAT lot;” “to cut it FAT,” to exaggerate,\r\nto show off in an extensive or grand manner, to assume undue importance;\r\n“cut up FAT,” see under CUT. As a theatrical term, a part with plenty of\r\nFAT in it is one which affords the actor an opportunity of effective\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\n~Father~, or FENCE, a buyer of stolen property.\r\n\r\n~Favourite~, the horse that has the lowest odds laid against it in the\r\nbetting list. When the FAVOURITE wins, the public or backers of horses\r\ngenerally are the gainers. When an outsider wins, the ring, that is to\r\nsay, the persons who make a business of laying against the chances of\r\nhorses, are the gainers.\r\n\r\n~Fawney~, a finger ring. _Irish_, FAINEE, a ring.\r\n\r\n~Fawney bouncing~, selling rings for a pretended wager. This practice is\r\nfounded upon the old tale of a gentleman laying a wager that if he were\r\nto offer “real gold sovereigns” at a penny a-piece at the foot of London\r\nBridge, the English public would be too incredulous to buy. The story\r\nstates that the gentleman stationed himself with sovereigns on a\r\ntea-tray, and sold only two within the hour, thus winning the bet. This\r\ntale the FAWNEY BOUNCERS tell the public, only offering brass,\r\ndouble-gilt rings, instead of sovereigns.\r\n\r\n~Fawney rig~, the ring-dropping trick. A few years ago this practice was\r\nvery common. A fellow purposely dropped a ring, or a pocket-book with\r\nsome little articles of jewellery, &c., in it, and when he saw any\r\nperson pick it up, ran to claim half. The ring found, the question of\r\nhow the booty was to be divided had then to be decided. The sharper\r\nsays, “If you will give me eight or nine shillings for my share, the\r\nthings are yours.” This the “flat” thinks very fair. The ring of course\r\nis valueless, and the swallower of the bait discovers the trick too\r\nlate. For another way of doing this trick, _see_ RING-DROPPING.\r\n\r\n~Feathers~, money, wealth; “in full FEATHER,” rich. FEATHERS is also a\r\nterm applied to dress; “in full FEATHER,” means very often in full\r\ncostume. It also means, at times, in high spirits.\r\n\r\n~Feed~, a meal, generally a dinner. Originally stable slang, now pretty\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n~Feele~, a daughter, or child.—Corrupted _French_.\r\n\r\n~Fellow-commoner~, uncomplimentary epithet used at Cambridge for an\r\nempty bottle.\r\n\r\n~Felt~, a hat.—_Old term_, in use in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n~Fence~, a purchaser or receiver of stolen goods; also, the shop or\r\nwarehouse of a FENCER.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Fen-nightingales~, toads and frogs, from their continued croaking at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n~Feringee~, a European—that is, a Frank.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Ferricadouzer~, a knock-down blow, a good thrashing. Probably derived,\r\nthrough the _Lingua Franca_, from the _Italian_, “far’ cader’ douser,”\r\nto knock down. “Far’ cader’ morto,” is to knock down dead.\r\n\r\n~Few~, used to signify the reverse, thus:—“Don’t you call this\r\nconsiderably jolly?” “I believe you, my bo-o-oy, A FEW.” Sometimes the\r\nreply is, “just a FEW.” Another expression of the same kind is RATHER,\r\nwhich _see_.\r\n\r\n~Fib~, to beat or strike.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Fib~, to lie, to romance.\r\n\r\n~Fibbing~, a series of blows delivered quickly, and at a short\r\ndistance.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Fiddle~, a sharper, “a street mugger.” In America, a swindle or an\r\nimposture.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle~, “to play second FIDDLE,” to act subordinately, or follow the\r\nlead of another. From the orchestral practice.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle-face~, a person with a wizened countenance.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle-faddle~, twaddle, or trifling discourse.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Fiddler~, a sharper, a cheat; also a careless, negligent, or dilatory\r\nperson. On board some ocean steamers the FIDDLER is the capstan-house,\r\nthe only place on board where passengers are permitted to smoke. The\r\nterm FIDDLER is easily traceable to the fact that, while the seamen are\r\nworking the capstan-bars, a man sometimes plays on the fiddle to cheer\r\nthem at their toil.\r\n\r\n~Fiddler~, a sixpence. Fiddler’s money is small money; generally from\r\nthe old custom of each couple at a dance paying the fiddler sixpence.\r\n\r\n~Fiddler~, or FADGE, a farthing.\r\n\r\n~Fiddlers’ green~, the place where sailors expect to go when they die.\r\nIt is a place of fiddling, dancing, rum, and tobacco, and is undoubtedly\r\nthe “Land of Cocaigne,” mentioned in mediæval manuscripts. A story is\r\ntold of a drunken sailor who heard a street preacher threatening all\r\nlisteners with eternal damnation, and who went up and asked where he\r\n(the sailor) was going after death. “To hell, of course,” replied the\r\npreacher. “No, you lubberly son of a sea-cook!” shouted the seaman,\r\nknocking the itinerant down; “I’m going to FIDDLER’S GREEN; and if you\r\nsay I’m not, I’ll throttle you.” Under compulsion, the preacher admitted\r\nthe existence of FIDDLER’S GREEN, _pro tempore_.\r\n\r\n~Fiddles~, transverse pieces of wood used on shipboard to protect the\r\ndishes at table during stormy weather. Swing tables obviate the use of\r\nFIDDLES.\r\n\r\n~Fiddle-sticks!~ an exclamation signifying nonsense. Sometimes\r\n“Fiddle-de-dee.”\r\n\r\n~Fiddling~, doing any odd jobs in the streets, holding horses, carrying\r\nparcels, &c., for a living. Among the middle classes, FIDDLING means\r\nidling away time, or trifling, and amongst sharpers it means gambling.\r\n\r\n~Fid-fad~, a game similar to chequers, or drafts, played in the West of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n~Field~, the whole of the runners in a race of any kind. “A FIELD of\r\nfourteen runners was placed in care of the starter.” In betting\r\nphraseology the FIELD represents the bulk of the horses, as opposed to\r\nthe favourite. “The FIELD for a pony,” means that the offerer will lay\r\n25_l._ against the favourite, preferring the chances of a winner turning\r\nup amongst the others. “Ten to one on the FIELD,” means that the price\r\nnamed can be obtained about any horse in the race, that being the lowest\r\nfigure or favourite’s price. Laying against favourites is called\r\nFIELDING, and bookmakers are often known as FIELDERS.\r\n\r\n~Field~, “to look out,” at cricket. In the outings of an eleven the\r\nFIELDERS are those who stand away from the wickets with a view to\r\nchecking the progress of the ball. FIELDING is a great essential to\r\ncricket, and to be “a good FIELD” is no slight honour. Also to lay\r\nagainst favourites in the betting.\r\n\r\n~Field-lane duck~, a baked sheep’s head. Field Lane was a low London\r\nthoroughfare leading from the foot of Holborn Hill to the purlieus of\r\nClerkenwell. It was formerly the market for stolen pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\nHolborn Viaduct improved all but a small portion of Field Lane off the\r\nface of the earth. There is but the smallest vestige of this famous (or\r\ninfamous) thoroughfare left. The neighbourhood has received an upheaval\r\nwithin the past few years, and from one end the pedestrian must descend\r\nto the remains of Field Lane by means of a flight of steps.\r\n\r\n~Fieri-facias.~ A red-faced man is often jocularly said to have been\r\nserved with a writ of FIERI-FACIAS.\r\n\r\n~Fi-fa~, a writ of Fieri-Facias.—_Legal._\r\n\r\n~Fi-fi~, Thackeray’s term for Paul de Kock’s novels, and similar modern\r\nFrench literature.\r\n\r\n~Fig~, “in full FIG,” _i.e._, full-dress costume, “extensively got up.”\r\nPossibly an allusion to the dress assumed by our first parents after\r\nthey were naked and not ashamed, or else an abbreviation of figure, in\r\nthe references to plates in books of fashions.\r\n\r\n~Fig~, “to FIG a horse,” to play improper tricks with one in order to\r\nmake him lively. The FIG is a piece of wet ginger placed under a horse’s\r\ntail for the purpose of making him appear lively, and enhance his price.\r\n\r\n~Figaro~, a barber; from _Le Nozze di Figaro_.\r\n\r\n~Fig-leaf~, a small apron worn by ladies.\r\n\r\n~Figure~, “to cut a good or bad FIGURE,” to make good or indifferent\r\nappearance; “what’s the FIGURE?” how much is to pay? FIGURE-HEAD, a\r\nperson’s face.—_Sea term._\r\n\r\n~Filch~, to steal, or purloin. Originally a cant word, derived from the\r\nFILCHES, or hooks, thieves used to carry, to hook clothes, or any\r\nportable articles from open windows.—_Vide_ Decker. It was considered a\r\ncant or gipsy term up to the beginning of the last century. Harman has\r\n“FYLCHE, to robbe.” Probably from “FILICHI,” Romany for a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n~File~, a deep or artful man, a jocose name for a cunning person.\r\nOriginally a term for a pickpocket, when to FILE was to cheat or rob.\r\nFILE, an artful man, was used in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. To deal with an artful man is sometimes said to be like\r\nbiting a FILE.\r\n\r\n~Filibuster~, an American adventurer, who, if successful, helps to\r\nextend the boundaries of the United States, becomes a General, and\r\nreceives high honours, but who remains a FILIBUSTER, and is despised as\r\nsuch, if he fails. The Texan, Nicaraguan, and kindred expeditions were\r\nof a FILIBUSTERING order.\r\n\r\n~Fillibrush~, to flatter, praise ironically.\r\n\r\n~Fimble-famble~, a lame, prevaricating excuse.—_Scandinavian._\r\n\r\n~Fin~, a hand; “come, tip us your FIN,” viz., let us shake\r\nhands.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Finder~, one who FINDS bacon and meat at the market before they are\r\nlost, _i.e._, steals them.\r\n\r\n~Finnuf~, a five-pound note. DOUBLE FINNUF, a ten-pound note.—_German_,\r\nFUNF, five.\r\n\r\n~Fire-eater~, a quarrelsome man, a braggadocio or turbulent person who\r\nis always ready to fight.\r\n\r\n~Firkytoodle~, to cuddle or fondle.\r\n\r\n~First flight~, the first lot to finish in a foot or horse race, in a\r\nfox hunt, &c.\r\n\r\n~Fish~, a person; “a queer FISH,” “a loose FISH.” Term never used except\r\nin doubtful cases, as those quoted.\r\n\r\n~Fishfag~, originally a Billingsgate fishwife; now any scolding,\r\nvixenish, foul-mouthed woman.\r\n\r\n~Fishy~, doubtful, unsound, rotten; used to denote a suspicion of a\r\n“screw being loose,” or “something rotten in the state of Denmark,” in\r\nreferring to any proposed speculation.\r\n\r\n~Fit~, an Americanism denoting the preterite of the verb to fight. A\r\nYankee once came upon the words _nihil fit_, and he immediately wrote\r\noff to the editor of the paper to which he subscribed to know “Who was\r\nNihil, who he fit, what amount he fit for, and if he won.”\r\n\r\n~Five fingers~, the five of trumps, at the game of Five-cards, or Don.\r\n\r\n~Fives~, “bunch of FIVES,” the fist.\r\n\r\n~Fix~, a predicament, or dilemma; “an awful FIX,” a terrible position;\r\n“to FIX one’s flint for him,” _i.e._, to “settle his hash,” to “put a\r\nspoke in his wheel.”\r\n\r\n~Fixings~, an Americanism, equivalent to our word “trimmings,” which\r\n_see_.\r\n\r\n~Fiz~, champagne; any sparkling wine.\r\n\r\n~Fizzing~, first-rate, very good, excellent; synonymous with “stunning.”\r\n\r\n~Flabbergast~, or FLABBERGHAST, to astonish, or strike with wonder;\r\nliterally, to strike aghast.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Flag~, a groat, or 4_d._—_Ancient Cant._\r\n\r\n~Flag~, an apron. People who wear their aprons when not at work, are\r\ncalled “flag-flashers.”\r\n\r\n~Flag of distress~, any overt sign of poverty; the end of a person’s\r\nshirt when it protrudes through his trousers.\r\n\r\n~Flam~, nonsense, blarney, a lie, humbug. “A regular FLAM,” a tale\r\ndevoid of truth.\r\n\r\n~Flame~, a sweetheart.\r\n\r\n~Flannel~, or HOT FLANNEL, the old term for gin and beer, drunk hot,\r\nwith nutmeg, sugar, &c.; a play on the old name “lambswool.” Also called\r\n“flip.” There is an anecdote told of Goldsmith helping to drink a quart\r\nof FLANNEL in a night-house, in company with George Parker, Ned Shuter,\r\nand a demure, grave-looking gentleman, who continually introduced the\r\nwords “crap,” “stretch,” “scrag,” and “swing.” Upon the Doctor asking\r\nwho this strange person might be, and being told his profession, he\r\nrushed from the place in a frenzy, exclaiming, “Good God! and have I\r\nbeen sitting all this while with a hangman!”\r\n\r\n~Flap~, lead used for the coverings of roofs.\r\n\r\n~Flapper~, or FLIPPER, the hand.\r\n\r\n~Flare up~, a jovial social gathering, a “breakdown,” a “row.”\r\n\r\n~Flash~, showy, smart, knowing; a word with various meanings. A person\r\nis said to be dressed FLASH when his garb is showy, and after a fashion,\r\nbut without taste. A person is said to be FLASH when he apes the\r\nappearance or manners of his betters, or when he is trying to be\r\nsuperior to his friends and relations. FLASH also means “fast,” roguish,\r\nand sometimes infers counterfeit or deceptive—and this, perhaps, is its\r\ngeneral signification. As it is used by those who best understand it\r\nnowadays, the word means that which is not what it appears to\r\nbe—anything spurious, as jewellery and shoddy clothes. “FLASH, my young\r\nfriend, or slang, as others call it, is the classical language of the\r\nHoly Land; in other words, St. Giles’s Greek.”—_Tom and Jerry_, by\r\nMoncreiff. Vulgar language was first termed FLASH in the year 1718, by\r\nHitchin, author of “_The Regulator of Thieves, &c., with account of\r\nflash words_.” “FLASH” is sometimes exchangeable with “fancy.”\r\n\r\n    “My FLASH man’s in quod,\r\n    And I’m the gal that’s willin,\r\n    So I’ll turn out to-night,\r\n    And earn an honest shillin’.\r\n\r\n    “Tooral, looral la,\r\n    What are wealth’s possessions?\r\n    Bless the man we love,\r\n    And blow the b---- Sessions.”—_Lyra Flagitiosa._\r\n\r\n~Flash it~, show it—said when any bargain is offered.\r\n\r\n~Flash o’ lightning~, the gold band on an officer’s cap.—_Sea._ Also in\r\nstreet slang, a glass of gin.\r\n\r\n~Flat~, a fool, a silly or “soft” person; the opposite of “sharp.” The\r\nterms appear to be shortenings for “sharp-witted” and “flat-witted.” Or,\r\nmaybe, from musical notes.\r\n\r\n~Flat-feet~, the battalion companies in the Foot Guards.\r\n\r\n~Flats~, playing cards; sometimes called “broads.” Also the storeys of\r\nlarge houses, built on the “independent” principle, each flat having\r\nits separate and peculiar offices, street-door, &c.\r\n\r\n~Flatty~, a rustic, or uninitiated person.\r\n\r\n~Flatty-ken~, a public-house the landlord of which is ignorant of the\r\npractices of the thieves and tramps who frequent it.\r\n\r\n~Flay the fox~, to vomit. Now replaced by the more popular “shoot the\r\ncat.”\r\n\r\n~Flemish account.~—_Old._ Still used by sailors for a tangled and\r\nunsatisfactory account or reckoning.\r\n\r\n~Flesh and blood~, brandy and port in equal quantities.\r\n\r\n~Flesh bag~, a shirt. American humourists call a white shirt a “clean\r\nbiled rag.” In the mining camps, and rough parts generally, a white\r\nshirt is called a “biled shirt” to distinguish it from the usual woollen\r\ngarment, which cannot be boiled.\r\n\r\n~Flick~, or OLD FLICK, a comical old chap or fellow. Term of endearment\r\namong low people.\r\n\r\n~Flick~, or FLIG, to whip by striking, and drawing the lash back at the\r\nsame time, which causes a stinging blow. A flicking is often\r\nadministered by schoolboys with a damp towel or pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n~Flies~, trickery, nonsense. “There are no FLIES about me, sir.”\r\nSoftening of lies.\r\n\r\n~Flim-flamn~, idle story.—_Beaumont and Fletcher._\r\n\r\n~Flimp~, to hustle, or rob.\r\n\r\n~Flimsy~, a bank-note. Bank of Elegance notes are sometimes called soft\r\nflimsies. In this particular case two good terms make a bad one, as both\r\n“soft” and “flimsies” used separately refer to good notes.\r\n\r\n~Flimsy~, the thin prepared copying-paper used by newspaper reporters\r\nand “penny-a-liners” for making several copies at once, which enables\r\nthem to supply different papers with the same article without loss of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n~Flint~, an operative who works for a “society” master, _i.e._, for full\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n~Flip~, corruption of FILLIP, a light blow. Also a hot drink. _See_\r\nFLANNEL.\r\n\r\n~Flip-flap~, a peculiar rollicking dance indulged in by costermongers\r\nwhen merry or excited—better described, perhaps, as the “double-shuffle”\r\ndanced with an air of extreme _abandon_. Also, a kind of somersault,\r\nin which the performer throws himself over on his hands and feet\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\n~Flipper~, the hand; “give us your FLIPPER,” give me your hand.—_Sea._\r\nMetaphor taken from the flipper or paddle of a turtle.\r\n\r\n~Floater~, a small suet dumpling put into soup.—_Whitechapel._\r\n\r\n~Floating academy~, the hulks.\r\n\r\n~Flog~, to whip. Cited both by Grose and the author of _Bacchus and\r\nVenus_ as a cant word. Many efforts have been made to ascertain the\r\nearliest use; Richardson cites Lord Chesterfield. From _Flagellum_.\r\n“Flawged,” for whipped, occurs in “The Presbyterian Lash, or Nockhoff’s\r\nMaid Whipt,” published in 1663. Nockhoff was the anagram for the name\r\nof the Rev. Zachary Crofton, who had scandalized the town by subjecting\r\nhis servant-maid to the discipline of the nursery. There is a good story\r\non the proper orthography of the convertible term for castigation\r\nrelated in a newspaper of 1841. A county magistrate, who had sentenced a\r\nboy to be birched, wrote in his warrant that the boy was to be “floged.”\r\nThe scrupulous gaoler hesitated to inflict the punishment, and sent back\r\nthe warrant to the justice for amendment, who thereupon drew his pen\r\nthrough “floged,” and ordered the boy to be “wiped.”\r\n\r\n~Flogger~, a whip.—_Almost obsolete._ FLOGGER is still the term applied\r\nto a number of strips of cloth attached to a handle, and used in\r\ntheatrical painting rooms to beat off the dust of the charcoal used in\r\nsketching a scene.\r\n\r\n~Flogster~, one addicted to flogging. William IV., who was accused of\r\nunduly and excessively punishing the sailors whom he commanded when in\r\nthe navy, was nicknamed in the newspapers “Prince William Henry\r\nFLOGSTER.”\r\n\r\n~Floor~, to knock down.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Floored~, when a picture is hung on the lowest row at the Exhibition of\r\nthe Royal Academy, it is, in artistic slang, said to be FLOORED, in\r\ncontradistinction to “skyed,” which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Floorer~, a blow sufficiently strong to knock a man down, or bring him\r\nto the floor. Often used in reference to sudden and unpleasant news.\r\n\r\n~Flop~, to plump; “to go FLOP down,” to fall suddenly, with violence and\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n~Flowery~, lodging, or house entertainment; “square the omee for the\r\nFLOWERY,” pay the master for the lodging.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Flue-faker~, a chimney-sweep.\r\n\r\n~Fluff it~, a term of disapprobation, implying “take it away, I don’t\r\nwant it.”\r\n\r\n~Fluff~, railway ticket clerks’ slang for short change given by them.\r\nThe profits thus accruing are called “fluffings,” and the practice is\r\nknown as “fluffing.”\r\n\r\n~Fluke~, at billiards, playing for one thing and getting another. Hence,\r\ngenerally what one gets accidentally, as an unexpected advantage, “more\r\nby luck than judgment.”\r\n\r\n~Flummery~, flattery, gammon, genteel nonsense. In American ships a\r\npeculiar kind of light sweet pudding.\r\n\r\n~Flummux~, to perplex or hinder.\r\n\r\n~Flummuxed~, done up, sure of a month in quod, or prison. In mendicant\r\nfreemasonry, the sign chalked by rogues and tramps upon a gate-post or\r\nhouse corner, to express to succeeding vagabonds that it is unsafe for\r\nthem to call there, is known as ⦿, or FLUMMUXED, which signifies that\r\nthe only thing they would be likely to get upon applying for relief\r\nwould be a “month in quod.”—_See_ QUOD.\r\n\r\n~Flunkey~, a footman or other man-servant.\r\n\r\n~Flunkeyism~, blind worship of rank, birth, or riches, or of all three;\r\ntoadyism.\r\n\r\n~Flush~, the opposite of “hard up,” in possession of money, not\r\npoverty-stricken.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Flush~, to whip; “FLUSHED on the horse,” to be privately whipped in\r\ngaol; to deluge with water, as in “FLUSHING the sewers;” to come upon\r\nsuddenly and completely,—“I came FLUSH upon him.”\r\n\r\n~Flush~, a term in cribbage, signifying a hand of cards composed\r\nentirely of one suit.\r\n\r\n~Flutter~, to try hard in defence or pursuit of an object. “I’ll have a\r\nFLUTTER for it,” means I’ll have a good try for it. Also to toss for\r\nanything. Probably from the spinning of the coin.\r\n\r\n~Fly~, knowing, wide-awake, fully understanding another’s meaning.\r\n\r\n~Fly~, TO BE ON THE, to be out for a day’s drink or pleasure.\r\n\r\n~Fly~, to lift, toss, or raise; “FLY the mags,” _i.e._, toss up the\r\nhalfpence; “to FLY a window,” _i.e._, to lift one for the purpose of\r\nstealing.\r\n\r\n~Fly-boys~, men employed to clear the printed copies from the Hoe\r\nmachines, on which daily papers are “worked.” So called to distinguish\r\nthem from the “machine boys,” a superior grade of labourers who “lay on”\r\nthe sheets.\r\n\r\n~Flying mare~, a throw in wrestling.\r\n\r\n~Flying mess~, “to be in FLYING MESS” is a soldier’s phrase for being\r\nhungry and having to mess where he can.\r\n\r\n~Flying stationer~, a paper-worker, hawker of penny ballads; “Printed\r\nfor the Flying Stationers” is the _imprimatur_ on hundreds of penny\r\nhistories and sheet songs of the last and present centuries.\r\n\r\n~Flymy~, knowing, cunning, roguish.—_Seven Dials and Low Life._\r\n\r\n~Fly the kite~, or RAISE THE WIND, to obtain money on bills, whether\r\ngood or bad, probably in allusion to tossing paper about as children do\r\nkites.\r\n\r\n~Fly the kite~, to evacuate from a window,—term used in padding-kens,\r\nor low lodging-houses.\r\n\r\n~Fobbed~, old slang for robbed. From FOB, the ancient breeches-pocket\r\nfor the watch.\r\n\r\n~Fogey~, or OLD FOGEY, a dullard, an old-fashioned or singular person.\r\nGrose says it is a nickname for an invalid soldier, from the French\r\n_fougueux_, fierce or fiery, but it has lost this signification now.\r\n\r\n~Fogger~, old word for a huckster.\r\n\r\n~Fogger~, a farm servant who feeds cattle. Probably a corruption of\r\nfodderer.\r\n\r\n~Foggy~, tipsy.\r\n\r\n~Fogle~, a silk handkerchief,—not a clout, which is of cotton. It has\r\nbeen hinted that this may have come from the German _Vogel_, a bird,\r\nfrom the bird’s-eye spots on some handkerchiefs, but a more probable\r\nderivation is the Italian slang (_Fourbesque_), FOGLIA, a pocket, or\r\npurse; or from the French Argot, FOUILLE, also a pocket.\r\n\r\n~Fogus~, tobacco.—_Ancient Cant._ FOGO, old word for stench.\r\n\r\n~Follow-me-lads~, curls hanging over a lady’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n~Foont~, a sovereign, or 20_s._ Probably a corruption of vingt.\r\n\r\n~Footing~, “to pay FOOTING.” _See_ SHOE.\r\n\r\n~Forakers~, the closet of decency, or house of office. Term used by the\r\nboys at Winchester School. Very likely from “four acres,” the original\r\nnecessary having been in all likelihood a field behind the school.\r\n\r\n~Force the voucher~, a term in use among sporting tricksters, who\r\nadvertise to send certain winners, and on receipt of letters enclose\r\nvouchers similar to those sent out by respectable commission agents, but\r\nwith double or treble the current odds marked thereon, in reference to\r\nthe horse named. A plausible letter is sent with the voucher, and the\r\nvictim is informed that on account of early investments made by the\r\nfirm, which has of course a high-sounding title, the extra odds can be\r\nlaid by them, and a remittance to the amount named, or part of it, is\r\nrequested. Of course the firm “dries up” when claims become heavy, and,\r\nwith a new name and new address, appears in the next week’s advertising\r\ncolumns. FORCING THE VOUCHER was a fine game when it was first started,\r\nbut it was soon overdone, as it required no particular ingenuity, and\r\noffered special immunities, theft of this kind being rather favoured\r\nthan otherwise by the authorities. Certainly the law that punishes\r\nhonest betting men seems powerless with regard to these plunderers,\r\notherwise we should hardly be treated as often as we are to the\r\nspectacle of one man being fined for honest dealing, while another\r\nescapes simply because he is not a betting man, but a welcher.\r\n\r\n~Fork out~, to bring out one’s money, to pay the bill, to “stand for” or\r\ntreat a friend; to hand over what does not belong to you—old cant term\r\nfor picking pockets, and very curious in its origin. In the early part\r\nof the last century, a little book was published on purloining, and of\r\ncourse it had to give the latest modes. FORKING was the newest mode, and\r\nit consisted in thrusting the fingers stiff and open into the pocket,\r\nand then quickly closing them and extracting any article thus caught.\r\n\r\n~Forks~, or GRAPPLING-IRONS, fingers. Costermongers and other clumsy\r\nfeeders have a proverb which seems to justify their taking bones and\r\nchoice morsels in their hands during the progress of a meal. It is,\r\n“Fingers were the first FORKS;” sometimes varied to “Fingers were made\r\nbefore FORKS.”\r\n\r\n~Form~, condition, training. “In good FORM” or “in bad FORM” refers to a\r\nman’s or horse’s state of being in the sporting world. FORM has also had\r\na moral significance of late years, and with the qualifying adjectives\r\nattached as occasion requires, is extensively used in general\r\nconversation. As, “It was bad FORM of Brown to do that.” “That article\r\nwas bad FORM.” In the latter cases the word “in” rarely appears.\r\n\r\n~Forty foot~, a derisive appellation for a very short person.\r\n\r\n~Forty guts~, vulgar term for a fat man.\r\n\r\n~Forty-twa~, the common place of retirement on a well-known French plan\r\nat Edinburgh, so called from its accommodating that number of persons at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n~Forty winks~, a short sleep or nap.\r\n\r\n~Fou~, rather more than slightly intoxicated.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n    “We are na’ FOU, we are na’ FOU.”\r\n\r\n~Foul~, to jostle or bore unfairly in a race. _See_ BORE. To touch any\r\nforeign substance during a race—particularly a boat-race—is to FOUL\r\nit.\r\n\r\n~Foul~, a touch, no matter how slight, of bodies or machinery in a race\r\nof any kind. FOULS in boat-racing are often inevitable, and are not\r\nalways the result of boring or any other malicious practice.\r\n\r\n~Foul riding~, riding which after a horse-race is made the subject of\r\ncomplaint, such as refusing to let a competitor pass, boring him against\r\nthe rails, &c. Some jockeys are great adepts at this work, and are\r\ninvaluable to a confederacy as a means, not so much of attaining victory\r\nthemselves, as of preventing its attainment in others. Of course unless\r\nproof of jostling can be given, or evidence of malicious intent shown,\r\njockeyship of this kind is not considered foul riding.\r\n\r\n~Four-and-nine~, or FOUR-AND-NINEPENNY GOSS, a cheap hat, so called from\r\n4_s._ 9_d._, the price at which a once noted advertising hat-maker sold\r\nhis hats—\r\n\r\n    “Whene’er to slumber you incline,\r\n    Take a short nap at 4 and 9.”\r\n\r\n~Four-eyes~, a man or woman who habitually wears spectacles.\r\n\r\n~Four kings~, HISTORY OF THE, an old name for a pack of playing cards.\r\n_See_ Sir Thomas Urquhart’s _Translation of Rabelais_. In _Argot_, LIVRE\r\nDES QUATRE ROIS.\r\n\r\n~Fourth~, or FOURTH COURT, the court appropriated to the waterclosets at\r\nCambridge; from its really being No. 4 at Trinity College. A man leaving\r\nhis room to go to the FOURTH COURT, writes on his door, in algebraic\r\nnotation, GONE^4, which expresses the Cambridge slang phrase, “gone to\r\nthe FOURTH.”\r\n\r\n~Fourth estate~, the complete body of journalists of all descriptions.\r\nThis term is much in use among “liners.”\r\n\r\n~Fox~, to cheat or rob.—_Eton College._ In London to watch closely and\r\nnarrowly.\r\n\r\n~Foxed~, a term used by print and book collectors to denote the brown\r\nspotted appearance produced by damp on paper.\r\n\r\n~Foxing~, when one actor criticises another’s\r\nperformance.—_Theatrical._ Also in street slang FOXING means watching\r\nslyly.\r\n\r\n~Fox’s Sleep~, or FOXING, a purposely assumed indifference to what is\r\ngoing on. A fox, as well as a weasel, is said to sleep with one eye\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n~Foxy~, rank, tainted, from the odour of the animal.—_Lincolnshire._\r\n\r\n~Foxy~, said also of a red-haired person.\r\n\r\n~Frapping~, a beating. _French_, FRAPPER.\r\n\r\n~Free-and-easy~, a club held at a low public-house, the members of which\r\nmeet in the tap-room or parlour for the purpose of drinking, smoking,\r\nand hearing each other sing. These gatherings are generally called\r\nharmonic meetings by the landlord, but FREE-AND-EASY best indicates the\r\ncharacter of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n~Free fight~, a fight conducted on the Irishman’s principle—“Sure,\r\nwherever you see a head, hit it.” The term is, however, American, so the\r\npractice may be considered fairly general.\r\n\r\n~Freeman’s quay~, “drinking at FREEMAN’S QUAY,” _i.e._, at another’s\r\ncost. This quay was formerly a celebrated wharf near London Bridge, and\r\nthe saying arose from the beer which was given gratis to porters and\r\ncarmen who went there on business.\r\n\r\n~French cream~, brandy.\r\n\r\n~French gout~, a certain disease, which is also known as “ladies’\r\nfever.”\r\n\r\n~French leave~, TO TAKE, to leave or depart slyly, without saying\r\nanything; or obtaining permission.\r\n\r\n~Fresh~, said of a person slightly intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~Freshman~, a University man during his first year. The official\r\nappellation for the students until they have passed the Previous or\r\nFirst Cambridge Examination, otherwise called the Smalls or Little Go,\r\nis Junior Sophs or Sophisters. After this they are Senior Sophs until\r\ntheir last term, when they are Questionists, or preparing “_ad\r\nrespondendum quæstioni_.” At Oxford the title FRESHMAN lasts for the\r\nfirst term.\r\n\r\n~Friday-face~, a gloomy-looking man. Most likely from FRIDAY being a day\r\nof meagre fare among Catholics and High Church Protestants.\r\n\r\n~Frisk~, to search; FRISKED, searched by a constable or other officer.\r\n\r\n~Frisk a cly~, to empty a pocket.\r\n\r\n~Frog~, a policeman. Because, by a popular delusion, he is supposed to\r\npounce suddenly on delinquents.\r\n\r\n~Frog’s march~, the manner in which four or more policemen carry a\r\ndrunken or turbulent man to the station-house. The victim is held face\r\ndownwards, one constable being at each shoulder, while the others hold\r\non above the knees. Often there is another active and intelligent\r\nofficer who beats time to the march on the recalcitrant hero’s\r\nposteriors.\r\n\r\n~Frontispiece~, the face.\r\n\r\n~Frow~, a girl, or wife. _German_, FRAU; _Dutch_, VROUW.\r\n\r\n~Frummagemmed~, annihilated, strangled, garrotted, or spoilt.—_Old\r\nCant._\r\n\r\n~Frump~, a slatternly woman, a gossip.—_Ancient._ In modern slang it is\r\nthe feminine of FOGEY, and means a prim old lady, who is generally\r\ntermed “a regular old FRUMP.”\r\n\r\n~Frump~, to mock or insult.—_Beaumont and Fletcher._\r\n\r\n~F sharps~, fleas. Compare B FLATS.\r\n\r\n~Fudge~, nonsense, stupidity. Todd and Richardson only trace the word to\r\nGoldsmith. Disraeli, however, gives the origin to a Captain Fudge, a\r\ngreat fibber, who told monstrous stories, which made his crew say in\r\nanswer to any improbability, “You FUDGE it!”—_See Remarks on the Navy_,\r\n1700. At page 87 of a collection of some papers of William Crouch (8vo,\r\n1712), the Quaker, we find a mention of this Captain. Degory Marshall\r\ninformed Crouch that—\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1664 we were sentenced for banishment to Jamaica by\r\n    Judges Hyde and Twisden, and our number was 55. We were put on board\r\n    the ship Black Eagle; the master’s name was FUDGE, by some called\r\n    LYING FUDGE.”\r\n\r\nSome persons believe that the word comes from the _Gaelic_, FFUG,\r\ndeception.\r\n\r\n~Fuggies~, hot rolls.—_School._\r\n\r\n~Full against~, opposed to. As, “I’m FULL AGAINST him,” I decidedly\r\nobject to, or dislike him, or I am opposed to him. The term originated\r\nwith the bookmakers; who, when they have laid all their money against a\r\ncertain horse, put a mark against his name, and reply to all inquiries,\r\n“FULL AGAINST him.” This grew to “FULL AGAINST his winning,” and was\r\nthus taken, when shortened, to express feeling the reverse of friendly.\r\n\r\n~Fullams~, false dice, which always turn up high.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Full blast~, a term evidently borrowed from the technology of the\r\nengine-room, and now frequently used to express the heyday or apogee of\r\nanything. As, “By the middle of the day matters were in FULL BLAST, and\r\nproceedings generally were very satisfactory.”\r\n\r\n~Full feather~, good condition, high spirits. Also any one gaily dressed\r\nis said to be in FULL FEATHER.\r\n\r\n~Full fig~, full costume, male or female uniform or evening dress.\r\n\r\n~Full of beans~, arrogant, purseproud. A person whom sudden prosperity\r\nhas made offensive and conceited, is said to be too “FULL OF BEANS.”\r\nOriginally stable slang.\r\n\r\n~Fully~, “to be FULLIED,” to be committed for trial. Term in general use\r\namong thieves. Possibly from the reports which, in the slang of the\r\npenny-a-liner, say “the prisoner was FULLY committed for trial.” The\r\nmagistrates often say FULLY committed also, whatever that may mean.\r\n\r\n~Funk~, trepidation, nervousness, cowardice. To FUNK, to be afraid or\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\n~Funk~, to smoke out, or terrify.\r\n\r\n~Funking the cobbler~, a bold schoolboy trick, performed with assafœtida\r\nand cotton stuffed into a hollow tube or cow’s horn. The cotton being\r\nlighted, the smoke is blown in through the keyhole of a door, or the\r\ncrannies of a cobbler’s stall. A funny song, much in vogue some years\r\nback, gave all the agonies of a drunken cobbler, who believed the devil\r\nhad come for him, with all sorts of accessories, till\r\n\r\n            “He was told by a shout\r\n    That ’twas only some boys who’d been FUNKING him out.”\r\n\r\n~Funny~, a rowing boat with both ends pointed and out of the water.\r\n\r\n~Funny-bone~, the extremity of the elbow—or rather, the muscle which\r\npasses round it between the two bones, a blow on which causes painful\r\ntingling in the fingers. Facetiously derived, from its being the\r\nextremity of the _humerus_ (humorous).\r\n\r\n~Fye-buck~, a sixpence.—_Nearly obsolete._\r\n\r\n~Gab~, GABBER or GABBLE, talk; “gift of the GAB,” loquacity, or natural\r\ntalent for speech-making.—_Anglo-Norman_; GAB is also found in the\r\n_Danish_ and _Old Norse_.\r\n\r\n~Gaby~, a simpleton, a country bumpkin. Probably from gape.\r\n\r\n~Gad~, a trapesing slatternly woman.—_Gipsy._ _Anglo-Saxon_, GÆDELING.\r\n\r\n~Gadding the hoof~, going without shoes. GADDING, roaming about,\r\nalthough used in an old translation of the Bible, is now only heard\r\namongst the lower orders.\r\n\r\n~Gaff~, a penny play-house, in which talking is not permitted on the\r\nstage. _See_ PENNY GAFF.\r\n\r\n~Gaffer~, a master, or employer; term used by “navvies,” and general in\r\nLancashire and North of England. Early English for an old man. _See_\r\n“BLOW THE GAFF.”\r\n\r\n~Gaffing~, tossing halfpence, or counters.—_North_, where it means\r\ntossing up three halfpennies. One man tosses, and another calls.\r\nSometimes the coins are tossed from a stick, and the tosser keeps those\r\nwhich fall heads uppermost.\r\n\r\n~Gag~, a lie; “a GAG he told to the beak.”—_Thieves’ Cant._\r\n\r\n~Gag~, language introduced by an actor into his part. In certain pieces\r\nthis is allowed by custom, and these are called GAG-PIECES. _The Critic,\r\nor a Tragedy Rehearsed_, is chief among these. Many actors, however,\r\ntake French leave in this respect with most pieces.—_Theatrical slang._\r\n\r\n    MR. ROBSON AT BELFAST.—We (_Northern Whig_) suspected a little bit\r\n    of what is professionally termed GAG in Mr. Robson’s _Daddy\r\n    Hardacre_ last night. He had occasion to say that one of the\r\n    characters in the piece “understands me well enough,” to which he\r\n    added—“I wish some other people did the same,” with an expressive\r\n    glance at the pit; which we interpreted as having special reference\r\n    to those appreciative persons in the audience whom we have already\r\n    mentioned, who think it absolutely needful to roar with laughter at\r\n    every sentence Mr. Robson utters, without the least regard to\r\n    whether it be humorous or pathetic—only because Mr. Robson has fame\r\n    as a comic actor.\r\n\r\nWhen another Robson shall arise, no one will object to his GAGGING a\r\nlittle. The public could afford that to such a man in these days of\r\n“creations.”\r\n\r\n~Gag~, to hoax, “take a rise” out of one; to “cod.”\r\n\r\n~Gage~, a small quantity of anything; as “a GAGE of tobacco,” meaning a\r\npipeful; “a GAGE of gin,” a glassful. GAGE was, in the last century, a\r\nchamber utensil.\r\n\r\n~Galeny~, old cant term for a fowl of any kind; now a respectable word\r\nin the West of England, signifying a Guinea fowl.—_Vide_ Grose.\r\n_Latin_, GALLINA.\r\n\r\n~Gallanty show~, an exhibition in which black figures are shown on a\r\nwhite sheet to accompanying dialogue. Generally given at night by “Punch\r\nand Judy” men.\r\n\r\n~Gallimaufry~, a kind of stew, made up of scraps of various kinds. Sea\r\nterm, and probably meaning the galley scraps.\r\n\r\n~Gallipot~, an apothecary.\r\n\r\n~Gallivant~, to wait upon the ladies.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Gallows~, or GALLUS, very, or exceedingly—an unpleasant exclamation;\r\n“GALLOWS poor,” very poor. Term originally applied to anything bad\r\nenough to deserve hanging.\r\n\r\n~Gallows bird~, an incorrigible thief; often applied to denote a\r\nruffian-like appearance.\r\n\r\n~Gallowses~, in the North of England a pair of braces.\r\n\r\n~Gally-yarn~, a sailor’s term for a hoaxing story. He expresses\r\ndisbelief by saying only “G. Y.”\r\n\r\n~Galoot.~—_See_ GEELOOT.\r\n\r\n~Galore~, abundance. _Irish_, GO LEOR, in plenty.\r\n\r\n~Gamb~, a leg. Still used as an heraldic term, as well as by thieves,\r\nwho probably get it from the _Lingua Franca_. _Italian_, GAMBA;\r\n_French_, JAMBE, a leg.\r\n\r\n~Game~, a term variously applied; “are you GAME?” have you courage\r\nenough? “what’s your little GAME?” what are you going to do? “come, none\r\nof your GAMES,” be quiet, don’t annoy me; “on the GAME,” out thieving.\r\nTo “play the GAME” is among sporting men to do a thing thoroughly and\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n~Game leg~, a lame or wounded leg.\r\n\r\n~Gameness~, pluck, endurance, courage generally.\r\n\r\n~Gammon~, deceit, humbug, a false and ridiculous story. _Anglo-Saxon_,\r\nGAMEN, game, sport.\r\n\r\n~Gammon~, to hoax, to deceive merrily, to laugh at a person, to tell an\r\nuntrue but plausible story, to make game of, or, in the provincial\r\ndialect, to make GAME on;—“who’s thou makin’ thy GAM’ on?” _i.e._, of\r\nwhom are you making a fool?—_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Gammy~, bad, unfavourable, poor tempered. Those householders who are\r\nknown enemies to the street folk and tramps are pronounced by them to be\r\nGAMMY. GAMMY sometimes means forged, as “GAMMY-MONNIKER,” a forged\r\nsignature; GAMMY STUFF, spurious medicine; GAMMY LOWR, counterfeit coin.\r\n_Hants_, GAMY, dirty. The hieroglyphic used by beggars and cadgers to\r\nintimate to those of the tribe coming after that things are not very\r\nfavourable is known as □, or GAMMY. _Gaelic_, _Welsh_, and _Irish_, CAM\r\n(GAM), crooked.\r\n\r\n~Gammy-vial~ (Ville), a town where the police will not let persons hawk.\r\n\r\n~Gander Month~, the period when the monthly nurse is in the ascendant,\r\nand the husband has to shift for himself. Probably from the open choice\r\nhe has during that period.\r\n\r\n~Ganger~, the person who superintends the work of a gang, or a number of\r\nnavigators.\r\n\r\n~Gape~, to stare about in an astonished manner. “GAPING about like a\r\ncountry bumpkin.” Sometimes pronounced GARP. There is no reference in\r\nthe use of this phrase by Cockneys to GAPE in its correct sense.\r\n\r\n~Gape-seed~, something to look at, cause for astonishment; a lazy\r\nfellow, unmindful of his work, is said to be “looking for GAPE-SEED.”\r\nRustics are said to find plenty of “GAPE-SEED” in London streets.\r\n\r\n~Gar~, euphuistic rendering of the title of the Deity; “be GAR, you\r\ndon’t say so!”—_Franco-English._\r\n\r\n~Garden~, among tradesmen signifies Covent GARDEN Market; among\r\ntheatrical performers, Covent GARDEN Theatre.\r\n\r\n~Gardener~, an awkward coachman; an insinuation that he is both coachman\r\nand gardener, and understands the latter branch of service better than\r\nthe first; “get on, GARDENER,” is a most insulting expression from a\r\ncabby to a real coachman. Men who in small families do the coach,\r\ngarden, and general work, are sometimes called “teakettle grooms,” or\r\n“teakettle coachmen.”\r\n\r\n~Gargle~, medical-student slang for drinkables.\r\n\r\n~Garnish~, the douceur or fee which, before the time of Howard the\r\nphilanthropist, was openly exacted by the keepers of gaols from their\r\nunfortunate prisoners for extra comforts. The practice of garnishing is\r\nby no means so defunct as some folk seem to think, and its influence may\r\noften be traced by those who wish.\r\n\r\n~Garnish~, footing money.—_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Garreter~, a thief who crawls over the tops of houses, and enters\r\ngarret-windows. Called also a “dancer,” or “dancing-master,” from the\r\nlight and airy nature of his occupation.\r\n\r\n~Garrotte~, a system of robbery with violence much practised on dark\r\nwinter nights by ruffians who during summer infest racecourses and\r\nfairs. Their victims are generally weak men and delicate women. From the\r\nSpanish GARROTTE, because the practice generally commences with a\r\nthrottling attack. Procedure is, however, various, these gentlemen being\r\npossessed of much ingenuity in the way of torture. “The cat” has within\r\nthe past year or so done much to modify this offensive state of things,\r\nbut the sympathetic appeals of certain tenderhearted M.P.’s and other\r\nphilanthropists, who are not themselves likely to be garrotted, on\r\nbehalf of the garrotters, will probably before long result in a\r\nwithdrawal of the _lex talionis_, and a natural resumption of the\r\ngarrotte system, with new adornments.\r\n\r\n~Garrotting~, a mode of cheating practised amongst card-sharpers, by\r\nconcealing certain cards at the back of the neck.\r\n\r\n~Gas~, to give off superfluous conceit, to bounce or brag; “his game is\r\nGAS.” “To give a person GAS,” is to scold him or give him a good\r\nbeating. Synonymous with “to give him Jessie.”\r\n\r\n~Gassy~, or GASEOUS, liable to “flare up” at any offence.\r\n\r\n~Gate~, THE, Billingsgate. Sometimes Newgate, according to the\r\noccupation and condition of the speaker. In the same way Paternoster Row\r\nis by publishers known as “the Row.”\r\n\r\n~Gate~, to order an undergrad not to pass beyond the college GATE. As a\r\nrule, the GATE begins after hall, but in extreme cases the offender is\r\nGATED for the whole day.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Gate-race~, among pedestrians a mock race, got up not so much for the\r\nbest runner to win, as for the money taken from spectators, at the gate.\r\nThis sort of business is not peculiar to pedestrians; there are such\r\nthings as gate-money meetings at horse-racing.\r\n\r\n~Gatter~, beer; “shant of GATTER,” a pot of beer. A curious slang street\r\nmelody, known in Seven Dials as _Bet the Coaley’s Daughter_, thus\r\nmentions the word in a favourite verse:—\r\n\r\n    “But when I strove my flame to tell,\r\n      Says she, ‘Come, stow that patter,\r\n    If you’re a cove wot likes a gal,\r\n      Vy don’t you stand some GATTER?’\r\n    In course I instantly complied—\r\n      Two brimming quarts of porter,\r\n    With sev’ral goes of gin beside,\r\n      Drain’d Bet the Coaley’s daughter.”\r\n\r\n~Gaudy~, the annual dinner of the Fellows of a College, in memory of\r\nfounders and benefactors. From GAUDEAMUS.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Gawfs~, cheap red-skinned apples, a favourite fruit with costermongers,\r\nwho rub them well with a piece of cloth, and find ready purchasers.\r\n\r\n~Gawky~, a lanky, or awkward person; a fool. _Saxon_, GEAK; _Scotch_,\r\nGOWK.\r\n\r\n~Gay~, loose, dissipated; “GAY woman,” a kept mistress or prostitute.\r\nMany people will remember Leech’s celebrated caricature of two wretched\r\nfemales on an equally wretched night, and the question asked by one\r\nwoman of the other, “How long have you been GAY?”\r\n\r\n~Gay tyke boy~, a dog-fancier.\r\n\r\n~Gee~, to agree with, or be congenial to a person.\r\n\r\n~Geeloot~, or GALOOT, a recruit, or awkward soldier. A clumsy person,\r\nalso a term of contempt in America.\r\n\r\n~Gen~, a shilling. _See_ back-slang article.\r\n\r\n~Gent~, a contraction of “gentleman,”—in more senses than one. A\r\ndressy, showy, foppish man, with a little mind, who vulgarizes the\r\nprevailing fashion.\r\n\r\n~Gent~, silver. From the _French_, ARGENT.\r\n\r\n~Gentleman of four outs;~ in Ireland when a vulgar, blustering fellow\r\nasserts that he is a gentleman, the retort generally is, “Yes, a\r\nGENTLEMAN OF FOUR OUTS”—that is, without wit, without money, without\r\ncredit, and without manners.\r\n\r\n~Gentleman of three ins~,—that is, in debt, in danger, and in poverty.\r\n\r\n~Geordie~, general term in Northumberland and Durham for a pitman, or\r\ncoal-miner. From the _Greek_, GEORGE meaning one who works the earth,\r\noriginally a cultivator; the term has been in use more than a century.\r\n\r\n~German Duck~, a sheep’s-head stewed with onions; a favourite dish among\r\nthe German sugar-bakers in the East-end of London.\r\n\r\n~German Ducks~, bugs.—_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Get up~, a person’s appearance or general arrangements. Probably\r\nderived from the decorations of a play.\r\n\r\n    “There’s so much GETTING UP to please the town,\r\n    It takes a precious deal of coming down.”\r\n\r\n        _Planché’s Mr. Buckstone’s Ascent of Parnassus._\r\n\r\n~Ghost~, “the GHOST doesn’t walk,” a theatrical term which implies that\r\nthere is no money about, and that there will be no “treasury.”\r\n\r\n~Gibberish~, unmeaning jargon; the language of the gipsies, synonymous\r\nwith SLANG, another Gipsy word. Somner says, “_French_, GABBER; _Dutch_,\r\nGABBEREN; and our own GAB, GABBER; hence also, I take it, our GIBBERISH,\r\na kind of canting language used by a sort of rogues we vulgarly call\r\ngipsies, a gibble-gabble understood only among themselves.” _See\r\nIntroduction._ The GIBBERISH of schoolboys is formed by placing a\r\nconsonant between each syllable of a word, and is called the GIBBERISH\r\nof the letter inserted. Thus, if F were the letter, it would be termed\r\nthe F GIBBERISH; if L, the L GIBBERISH—as in the sentence, “How do you\r\ndo?—_Howl dol youl dol?_” A GIBBERISH is sometimes formed by adding\r\n_vis_ to each word, in which the previous sentence would be—“_Howvis\r\ndovis youvis dovis?_” These things are worthy of schoolboys, as they are\r\nin ability far below the rhyming, the back, or the centre slang, each of\r\nwhich is constructed by people possessing no claim to literary\r\nexcellence whatever. Schoolboys in France form a GIBBERISH, in a\r\nsomewhat similar manner, by elongating their words two syllables, in the\r\nfirst of which an _r_, in the second a _g_, predominates. Thus the words\r\n_vous êtes un fou_ are spoken, _vousdregue esdregue undregue foudregue_.\r\nFast persons in Paris, of both sexes, frequently adopt terminations of\r\nthis kind, from some popular song, actor, exhibition, or political\r\nevent. In 1830, the favourite termination was _mar_, saying _épicemar_\r\nfor épicier, _cafémar_ for café. In 1823, when the diorama created a\r\nsensation in Paris, the people spoke in _rama_ (_on parlait en rama_.)\r\nIn Balzac’s beautiful tale, _Le Père Goriot_, the young painter at the\r\nboarding-house dinner-table mystifies the landlady by saying, “What a\r\nbeautiful _soupeaurama_!” To which the old woman replies, to the great\r\nlaughter of the company, “I beg your pardon, sir, it is _une soupe à\r\nchoux_.” These adaptations can hardly be called slang, or we shall have\r\neverybody making a slang of his own, and refusing to believe in any\r\none’s else—a sort of secondhand edition of the Tower of Babel.\r\n\r\n~Gib-face~, a heavy, ugly face; GIB is properly the lower lip of a\r\nhorse; “to hang one’s GIB,” to pout the lower lip, to be angry or\r\nsullen.\r\n\r\n~Gibus~, an opera hat. From the inventor of the crush hat.\r\n\r\n~Giffle-gaffle~, or GIBBLE-GABBLE, nonsense. _See_ CHAFF. _Icelandic_,\r\nGAFLA.\r\n\r\n~Gig~, a farthing. Formerly GRIG.\r\n\r\n~Gig~, fun, frolic, a spree. _Old French_, GIGUE, a jig, a romp.\r\n\r\n    “In search of lark, or some delicious GIG,\r\n    The mind delights on, when ’tis in prime twig.”\r\n\r\n        _Randall’s Diary_, 1820.\r\n\r\n    “‘No heirs have I,’ said mournful Matt;\r\n      But Tom, still fond of GIG,\r\n    Cried out, ‘No hairs? don’t fret at that,\r\n      When you can buy a wig.’”\r\n\r\n~Gig lamps~, spectacles; also a person who wears spectacles is often\r\ncalled GIG-LAMPS. Connexion obvious. This term has been in use probably\r\nas long as GIG-LAMPS themselves—if GIG-LAMPS were invented after\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n~Gill~, or JILL, a homely woman; “Jack and Gill,” &c.\r\n\r\n~Gills~, the lower part of the face.—_Bacon._ “To grease one’s GILLS,”\r\n“to have a good feed,” or make a hearty meal. A man suffering from the\r\neffects of a previous night’s debauch, is said to “look queer about the\r\ngills.”\r\n\r\n~Gills~, overlarge shirt collars.\r\n\r\n~Gilt~, money. _German_, GELD; _Dutch_, GELT.\r\n\r\n~Gimcrack~, a bijou, a slim piece of mechanism. Old slang for “a spruce\r\nwench.”—_New Bailey._ Any things which are gaudy and easily breakable,\r\nare known now as GIMCRACKS.\r\n\r\n~Ginger~, a showy, fast horse—as if he had been figged with GINGER\r\nunder his tail; a red-haired man. Term commonly used in depreciation of\r\na person’s appearance.\r\n\r\n~Ginger hackled~, having flaxen, light yellow hair. Term originally used\r\nto describe a certain colour or colours in game-cocks.—_See_ HACKLE.\r\n\r\n~Gingerly~, to do anything with great care.—_Cotgrave._\r\n\r\n~Gingham~, an umbrella. Term very common in London.\r\n\r\n~Gingumbob~, a bauble.\r\n\r\n~Gin-spinner~, a distiller, or rectifier of gin.\r\n\r\n~Give~, to strike, to scold; “I’ll GIVE it to you,” _i.e._, I will\r\nthrash you. To lead to, in the sense of directions. Thus, in one of the\r\nChristmas numbers of _All the Year Round_ we are told that “a side\r\nportal and a passage, dark at noon, GAVE upon Paradise Alley.” This\r\nusage of the word, from the French idiomatic use of _donner_, is\r\nbecoming by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\n~Give in~, to admit oneself defeated, to “throw up the sponge,” or\r\n“strike one’s flag.”\r\n\r\n~Give it mouth~, a rude request to an actor or orator, which means,\r\nspeak up. Low folk can fancy nothing higher in the way of encomium on an\r\nactor than, “He’s the cove to GIVE IT MOUTH—rather!”\r\n\r\n~Gladstone~, cheap claret. GLADSTONE reduced the duty on French wines.\r\n\r\n~Glasgow magistrate~, a salt herring. When George IV. visited Scotland,\r\na wag placed some salt herrings on the iron guard of the carriage\r\nbelonging to a well-known GLASGOW MAGISTRATE, who made one of a\r\ndeputation to receive his Majesty.\r\n\r\n~Glaze~, glass; generally applied to windows. To “star the GLAZE” is to\r\nbreak a window.\r\n\r\n~Glib~, a tongue; “slacken your GLIB,” _i.e._, “loosen your tongue.”\r\n\r\n~Glim~, a light, a lamp; “dowse the GLIM,” put out the candle. _Sea and\r\nOld Cant._ GLIMS, spectacles. _Gaelic_, GLINN, light. _German_\r\n(provincial), GLIMM, a spark.\r\n\r\n~Glim lurk~, a begging paper, giving a circumstantial account of a\r\ndreadful fire—which never happened.\r\n\r\n~Gloak~, a man. Term much used in old thieves’ cant.\r\n\r\n~Glum~, sulky, stem; “to look GLUM,” to appear annoyed or disconcerted.\r\n\r\n~Glump~, to sulk.\r\n\r\n~Glumpish~, of a stubborn, sulky temper.\r\n\r\n~Go~, a GO of gin, a quartern of that liquor. (This word, as applied to\r\na measure of liquor, is stated to have arisen from the following\r\ncircumstance:—Two well-known actors once met at the bar of a tavern to\r\nhave a “wet” together. “One more glass and then we’ll GO,” was repeated\r\nso often on either hand, that in the end GO was out of the question with\r\nboth of them, and so the word passed into a saying.) GO is also\r\nsynonymous with circumstance or occurrence; “a rummy GO,” and “a great\r\nGO,” signify curious and remarkable occurrences; “all the GO,” when\r\nanything creates unusual interest, “no GO,” no good; “here’s a pretty\r\nGO!” here’s a trouble; GO, a term in the game of cribbage; “to GO the\r\njump,” to enter a house by the window.—_See_ LITTLE GO; also\r\nCALL-A-GO.\r\n\r\n    “Gemmen (says he), you all well know\r\n    The joy there is whene’er we meet;\r\n    It’s what I call the primest GO,\r\n    And rightly named, ’tis—‘quite a treat,’”\r\n\r\n        _Jack Randall’s Diary_, 1820.\r\n\r\n~Go along~, a fool, a cully, one of the most contemptuous terms in a\r\nthieves’ vocabulary.\r\n\r\n~Gob~ or GOBBET, a portion. Generally applied to meat by schoolboys.\r\n\r\n~Gob~, the mouth, as in pugilistic slang “a spank on the GOB, drawing\r\nthe gravy.” Also mucus, or saliva. Sometimes used for GAB, talk—\r\n\r\n    “There was a man called Job,\r\n      Dwelt in the land of Uz;\r\n    He had a good gift of the GOB;\r\n      The same case happen us.”\r\n\r\n        ZACH. BOYD.\r\n\r\n_Gaelic_—GAB and GOB, a mouth. _See_ GAB.\r\n\r\n~God bless the Duke Of Argyle!~ a Scottish insinuation made when one\r\nshrugs his shoulders, of its being caused by parasites or cutaneous\r\naffections.—_See_ SCOTCH FIDDLE, SCOTCH GREYS. It is said to have been\r\noriginally the thankful exclamation of the Glasgow folk, at finding a\r\ncertain row of iron posts, erected by his grace in that city to mark the\r\ndivision of his property, very convenient to rub against. Some say the\r\nposts were put up purposely for the benefit of the good folk of Glasgow,\r\nwho were at the time suffering from the “Scotch fiddle.” This is,\r\nhowever, but a Southern scandal.\r\n\r\n~Gods~, the people in the upper gallery of a theatre; “up amongst the\r\nGODS,” a seat amongst the persons in the gallery—so named from the high\r\nposition of that part, and the blue sky generally painted on the ceiling\r\nof the theatre; termed by the French, “paradis.”\r\n\r\n~Gods~, the quadrats used by printers in throwing on the imposing stone,\r\nsimilar to the movement in casting dice.—_Printers’ term._\r\n\r\n~Go due north~, to become bankrupt, to go to Whitecross Street.—_Nearly\r\nobsolete._\r\n\r\n~Go for the gloves~, to lay against a horse on the chance of its losing,\r\nwithout having the wherewithal to pay if it wins. Probably from the\r\ncustom of ladies who bet GLOVES, and expect, as the racing men say, to\r\n“stand them to nothing,” _i.e._, to be paid if they win, but not to pay\r\nif they lose. This is a last resource of the bankrupt turfite;\r\nand the big handicaps at the end of the year, the Cesarewitch and\r\nCambridgeshire, offer both temptation and opportunity to those who can\r\nonly hope to recoup themselves for their previous losses by “GLOVING IT”\r\nsuccessfully. When, in the sporting papers it is stated that a settling\r\nat Tattersall’s was more than usually unsatisfactory, it may be fairly\r\nassumed that the GLOVES have not been won by those who most desired\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n~Go in~, to enter for, to apply oneself in pursuit of. Men at the\r\nUniversities are said to GO IN for honours, aquatics, or whatever their\r\nchief desire or employment may be. The expression is now general.\r\n\r\n~Go it~, a term of encouragement, implying, “keep it up!” Sometimes\r\namplified to “GO IT, ye cripples;” said to have been a facetious\r\nrendering of the last line of Virgil’s _Eclogues_—\r\n\r\n    “Ite domum saturæ, venit Hesperus, _ite capellæ_;”\r\n\r\nor, “GO IT, ye cripples, crutches are cheap.”\r\n\r\n~Goldbacked uns~, body lice. Sometimes called greybacked uns.\r\n\r\n~Goldfinches~, sovereigns. Similar to Canaries.\r\n\r\n~Gold-mine~, any profitable investment, from a fried-fish shop to a\r\nremunerative speculation involving millions.\r\n\r\n~Golgotha~, a hat, “place of a skull.” Hence the “Don’s gallery,” at St.\r\nMary’s, Cambridge, and that part of the theatre at Oxford where the\r\nheads of houses sit.\r\n\r\n~Gol-mol~, noise, commotion.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Golopshus~, splendid, delicious, luscious.—_Norwich._\r\n\r\n~Gonnof~, an expert thief, a master of his craft; one of the greatest\r\ncompliments a London pickpocket can pay another is to say, “he’s a\r\nreglar GONNOF.”—_See_ GUN. The word GONNOF is very old. During Kett’s\r\nrebellion in Norfolk, in the reign of Edward VI., a song was sung by the\r\ninsurgents in which the term occurs—\r\n\r\n    “The country GNOFFES, Hob, Dick, and Hick,\r\n      With clubbes and clouted shoon,\r\n    Shall fill up Dussyn dale\r\n      With slaughter’d bodies soone.”\r\n\r\n~Good people~, the name given by country folk, evidently from fear of\r\noffending by any less decided term, to fairies, brownies, pixies, &c.\r\nMothers often say to querulous children, “I wish the GOOD PEOPLE would\r\nrun away with you.”\r\n\r\n~Goods~, in the sporting world, men or horses. A horse or man of\r\nexceptionable quality is called “good GOODS,” and a backer will speak of\r\neither as being in his opinion “best GOODS,” as compared with others in\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\n~Good time~, an expressive phrase, which means all earthly bliss to the\r\nAmerican mind. The finest reminiscence a Yankee can have is that of a\r\nGOOD TIME, wherever it may have been spent. No moderate amount of\r\nhappiness is ever recorded in the register which denotes how often its\r\npossessor has “had a GOOD TIME.”\r\n\r\n~Good woman~, a not uncommon public-house sign, representing a woman\r\nwithout a head,—the ungallant allusion is that she cannot scold. Maybe,\r\nthe publican does not think that it means also that she cannot drink.\r\nThe Honest Lawyer, another sign, is depicted in the same manner.\r\n\r\n~Goose~, a tailor’s pressing iron. Originally a slang term, but now in\r\nmost dictionaries.\r\n\r\n~Goose;~ “Paddy’s GOOSE,” _i.e._, the White Swan, a celebrated\r\npublic-house in Ratcliff Highway.\r\n\r\n~Goose~, “to cook his GOOSE,” to kill him; the same as “to give him his\r\ngruel,” or “settle his hash.”\r\n\r\n~Goose~, “to get the GOOSE,” “to be GOOSED,” signifies to be hissed\r\nwhile on the stage. The big-bird, the terror of actors. _See_ BIG\r\nBIRD.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Goose~, to ruin, or spoil; to hiss a play.—_Theatrical._ To be “sound\r\non the GOOSE” is in America to be orthodox in one’s political creed.\r\n\r\n~Gooseberry~, to “play up old GOOSEBERRY” with any one, to defeat or\r\nsilence a person in a quick or summary manner.\r\n\r\n~Gooseberry-pickers~, sharp children, who are ostensibly placed in\r\ncharge of their elder sisters, when the latter go out shopping, but who\r\nare in reality a check on any chance of flirtation.\r\n\r\n~Goosecap~, a simpleton, a booby, or noodle.—_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Gooser~, a settler, or finishing blow.\r\n\r\n~Go over~, in clerical slang, signifies to join the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\n~Gorge~, to eat in a ravenous manner. “Rotten GORGERS” are those hungry\r\nlads who hang about Covent Garden Market, and devour the discarded\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n~Gorger~, a swell, a well-dressed, or gorgeous man—probably derived\r\nfrom the latter adjective. Sometimes used to denote an employer, or\r\nprincipal, as the manager of a theatre.\r\n\r\n~Gormed~, a Norfolk corruption of a profane oath. So used by Mr.\r\nPeggotty in _David Copperfield_.\r\n\r\n~Gospel grinder~, a City missionary, or tract-distributor.\r\n\r\n~Gospel Shop~, an irreverent term for a church or chapel of any\r\ndenomination. Mostly in use among sailors.\r\n\r\n~Goss~, a hat—from the gossamer silk of which modern hats are made.\r\n\r\n~Goss~, “to give a man GOSS,” to requite an injury, to beat, or kill.\r\nThis is an Americanism, and is applied variously. A steamboat captain on\r\nthe Mississippi, determined to pass his rival, called out, so the story\r\ngoes, to the fireman, “Give her GOSS and let her rip, as I mean to pass\r\nthat boat, or bust.”\r\n\r\n~Goth~, an uncultivated person. One who is ignorant of the ways of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n~Go the whole pile~, to put all one’s bank on a solitary chance. An\r\nAmericanism which had its origin in the PILES of gold dust used as\r\ncirculating medium by gambling miners.\r\n\r\n~Gourock ham~, a salt herring. GOUROCK, on the Clyde, about twenty-five\r\nmiles from Glasgow, was formerly a great fishing village.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Government sign-post~, the gallows. This is necessarily almost\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n~Governor~, a father, a master or superior person, an elder; “which way,\r\nGUV’NER, to Cheapside?”\r\n\r\n~Gowler~, a dog.—_North Country Cant._ _Query_, GROWLER.\r\n\r\n~Gownsman~, a student at one of the universities, as distinguished from\r\na TOWNSMAN.\r\n\r\n~Grab~, to clutch, or seize; GRABBED, caught, apprehended.\r\n\r\n~Grace-card~, the six of hearts, so termed in Ireland. A Kilkenny\r\ngentleman, named GRACE, being solicited, with promises of royal favour,\r\nto espouse the cause of William III., gave the following answer, written\r\non the back of the six of hearts, to an emissary of Marshal Schomberg’s,\r\nwho had been commissioned to make the proposal to him:—“Tell your\r\nmaster I despise his offer; and that honour and conscience are dearer to\r\na gentleman than all the wealth and titles a prince can bestow.” This\r\nwould have been a much better story had James II. been a better King,\r\nand had he not earned for himself, even among Catholic Irishmen, a\r\ndisgraceful name, through his craven conduct at the Battle of the Boyne.\r\n\r\n~Graft~, work; “where are you GRAFTING?” _i.e._, where do you work?\r\n“What GRAFT are you at?” what are you doing? Perhaps derived from\r\ngardening phraseology; or a variation of _craft_.\r\n\r\n~Granny~, a knot which will not hold, from its being wrongly and\r\nclumsily tied.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Granny~, to know, or recognise; “do ye GRANNY the bloke?” do you know\r\nthe man?\r\n\r\n~Grappling irons~, fingers.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Grass~, “gone to GRASS,” dead,—a coarse allusion to burial; absconded,\r\nor disappeared suddenly; also, gone to waste; it is said of wasted limbs\r\nthat they have “gone to GRASS;” “oh, go to GRASS,” a common answer to a\r\ntroublesome or inquisitive person,—possibly a corruption of “go to\r\nGRACE,” meaning, of course, a directly opposite fate.\r\n\r\n~Grass~, to knock down. Also to throw in a wrestling-match. “He GRASSED\r\nhis man with a heavy righthander,” or “He brought his man to GRASS by\r\nmeans of a swinging hipe.”\r\n\r\n~Grass-comber~, a country fellow, a haymaker.\r\n\r\n~Grasshopper~, a waiter at a tea-garden.\r\n\r\n~Grass widow~, an unmarried mother; a deserted mistress. In the United\r\nStates, during the gold fever in California, it was common for an\r\nadventurer to put both his wife (termed in his absence a GRASS-WIDOW)\r\nand his children to school during his absence. Also a married woman,\r\nresident in England, whose husband is in India or the colonies.\r\n\r\n~Gravel~, to confound, to bother; “I’m GRAVELLED,” _i.e._, perplexed or\r\nconfused.—_Old._ Also, to prostrate, to beat to the ground.\r\n\r\n~Gravel-rash~, a scratched face,—telling its tale of a drunken fall. A\r\nperson subject to this is called a GRAVEL-GRINDER.\r\n\r\n~Gravesend sweetmeats~, shrimps. GRAVESEND TWINS are solid particles of\r\nsewage.\r\n\r\n~Gray~, a halfpenny, with either two “heads” or two “tails”—both sides\r\nalike. They are used for cheating the unwary at “Tommy Dodd,” or pitch\r\nand toss. They are often “rung in” with a victim’s own money, so that\r\nthe caller of “heads” or “tails” cannot lose. Thus if A has to call, he\r\nor a confederate manages to mix the selected GRAYS with B’s tossing\r\nhalfpence. There are various and almost obvious uses for them.\r\n\r\n~Gray-coat parson~, a lay impropriator, or lessee of great tithes.\r\n\r\n~Gray mare~, a wife who “wears the breeches.” From an old story in which\r\nthe point is to show that the “GRAY MARE,” the wife’s choice, “is the\r\nbetter horse,” and by parity of reasoning that the wife is superior to\r\nthe husband.\r\n\r\n~Grays~, or SCOTCH GRAYS, lice. These pretty little things are called by\r\nmany names, among others by those of GRAY-BACKS, and GOLD-BACKED UNS,\r\nwhich are popular among those who have most interest in the matter.\r\n\r\n~Grease spot~, a minute remnant, humorously the only distinguishable\r\nremains of an antagonist after a terrific contest.\r\n\r\n~Greasing~, bribing.

The\r\nGreeks had no KALENDS.\r\n\r\n~Greeks~, the low Irish. St. Giles’s GREEK, slang or cant language.\r\nCotgrave gives merrie GREEK as a definition for a roystering fellow, a\r\ndrunkard. The GREEKS have always been regarded as a jolly, luxurious\r\nrace; so much so, that the Latins employed the verb _Græcari_ (lit. to\r\nplay the GREEK) to designate fine living and free potations, a sense in\r\nwhich Horace frequently uses it; while Shakspeare often mentions the\r\nmerry GREEKS; and “as merry as a grig” (or GREEK) was long a favourite\r\nallusion in old English authors. It is said by some that grig is in this\r\nsense intended to represent the small eel of that name which from its\r\nlively movements is supposed to be always merry; while others incline to\r\nthe belief that the cricket, which is also in some parts of the\r\nprovinces known as a grig, is meant. Readers may take their choice.\r\n\r\n~Green~, ignorant, not wide-awake, inexperienced.—_Shakspeare._ “Do you\r\nsee any GREEN in my eye?” ironical question in a dispute.\r\n\r\n~Greenbacks~, the paper money issued in the United States during the\r\nwar. The term was at first applied only to the notes for small amounts,\r\nwhich were backed with green, but eventually the one word represented\r\nall descriptions of what is now known in America as “currency.”\r\n\r\n~Green-horn~, a fresh, simple, or uninitiated person.\r\n\r\n~Greenlander~, an inexperienced person, a spoon. Sometimes an Irishman.\r\n\r\n~Greenwich goose~, a pensioner of the Naval Hospital.\r\n\r\n~Griddler~, a person who sings in the streets without a printed copy of\r\nthe words.—_Seven Dials._\r\n\r\n~Gridiron~, a County Court summons. Originally a summons to the Court of\r\nWestminster only; from the GRIDIRON arms. The Grafton Club is nearly\r\nalways known as the GRID or GRIDIRON, that instrument being brought into\r\nrequisition whenever possible in the cuisine.\r\n\r\n~Gridiron and dough boys~, the flag of the United States, in allusion to\r\nthe stars and stripes.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Grief~, “to come to GRIEF,” to meet with an accident, to be ruined.\r\n\r\n~Griffin~, in India, a newly-arrived cadet; general for an inexperienced\r\nyoungster.\r\n\r\n~Grind~, “to take a GRIND,” _i.e._, a walk, or constitutional. The daily\r\ngrind is a term representing employment containing much routine. At\r\nOxford college sports are called sometimes the GRIND.\r\n\r\n~Grind~, to work up for an examination, to cram by oneself, or with a\r\nprivate tutor.\r\n\r\n~Grinder~, private tutor, a coach.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Grinder~, a tooth.\r\n\r\n~Grindoff~, a miller. From _The Miller and his Men_.\r\n\r\n~Gripes~, the stomach-ache. _See_ TRIPES.\r\n\r\n~Grist to the mill~, money to the pocket, food to the family; anything\r\nwhich is supposed to add to a man’s immediate prospects, to his income,\r\nor to his benefit in any way, is said to “bring GRIST TO THE MILL.”\r\n\r\n~Grizzle~, to fret or cry continuously.\r\n\r\n~Grog blossoms~, pimples on the face, caused by hard drinking. Of such a\r\nperson it is often said, “He bears his blushing honours thick upon him.”\r\n\r\n~Grog-fight~, a drinking party.—_Military._\r\n\r\n~Groggy~, tipsy; when a prize-fighter becomes “weak on his pins,” and\r\nnearly beaten, he is said to be GROGGY. The same term is applied to\r\nhorses that are overworked and unsteady. From similarity of appearance\r\nto the peculiarity of gait consequent on imbibing too much GROG.\r\n\r\n~Grove of the Evangelist~, a facetious name for St. John’s Wood.\r\n\r\n~Growler~, a four-wheeled cab. It is generally supposed that drivers of\r\nthese vehicles take a less favourable view of life than do their Hansom\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n~Grub and bub~, victuals and drink of any kind,—GRUB signifying food,\r\nand BUB, drink.\r\n\r\n~Grubbing ken~, or SPINIKIN, a workhouse; a cook-shop.\r\n\r\n~Grubby~, musty, or old-fashioned.—_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Gruel~, “to give a person his GRUEL,” to kill him. An expression in all\r\nprobability derived from the report of a trial for poisoning, or from\r\nthe easiest manner of administering a dose of poison. In the old days a\r\nsimilar phrase was “to drug a posset.” Compare “to settle his hash,” and\r\n“cook his goose.”\r\n\r\n~Guardevine~, a cellaret.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Guinea pigs~, habitual directors of public companies; special jurymen;\r\nand engineer officers doing civil duty at the War Office, and paid a\r\nGUINEA per diem.\r\n\r\n~Guinea to a goose~, a sporting phrase, meaning long odds in favour of,\r\nor against, anything under notice. In the City this state of things is\r\nrepresented by the phrase, Lombard Street to a China orange. There are\r\nalso other colloquialisms on this subject, but their power is, as a\r\nrule, mainly dependent upon their indecency.\r\n\r\n~Gulfed~, originally a Cambridge term, denoting that a man is unable\r\nto enter for the classical examination from having failed in the\r\nmathematical. These men’s names appeared in the list of “Degrees\r\nAllowed.” The name GULF for this list is said to have arisen from the\r\nboast of a former “wooden spoon.” “I would have you to know there is a\r\ngreat GULF between _me_ and the captain of the poll.” Candidates for\r\nclassical honours were compelled to go in for both examinations. From\r\nthe alteration of the arrangements, the term as thus applied is now\r\nobsolete. The expression is common now in Oxford as descriptive of a man\r\nwho goes in for honours, and only gets a pass. An Honorary Fourth is\r\nwhen a candidate who only tries for a pass does so well that he is\r\nraised to the honours’ list.\r\n\r\n~Gull~, to cheat, to deceive; also one easily cheated. From the easy\r\nmanner in which the bird of that name is deceived.\r\n\r\n~Gullyfluff~, the waste—coagulated dust, crumbs, and hair—which\r\naccumulates imperceptibly in the pockets of schoolboys.\r\n\r\n~Gully rakers~, cattle thieves in Australia, the cattle being stolen out\r\nof almost inaccessible valleys, there termed GULLIES.\r\n\r\n~Gulpin~, a weak, credulous fellow, who will GULP down anything.\r\n\r\n~Gummy~, thick, fat—generally applied to a woman’s ankles, or to a man\r\nwhose flabby person betokens him a drunkard.\r\n\r\n~Gumption~, or RUMGUMPTION, comprehension, capacity. From GAUM, to\r\ncomprehend; “I canna gauge it, and I canna GAUM it,” as a Yorkshire\r\nexciseman said of a hedgehog.\r\n\r\n~Gun~, a magsman or street thief. Diminutive of gonnuf or gunnof. A\r\nGUN’S practice is known as GUNOVING.\r\n\r\n~Gunner’s daughter~, a term facetiously applied to the method of\r\npunishing boys in the Royal Navy by tying them securely to the breech of\r\na cannon, so as to present the proper part convenient for the cat, and\r\nflogging them. This is called “marrying” or “kissing” the GUNNER’S\r\nDAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n~Gup~, gossip.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Gurrawaun~, a coachman, a native Indian corruption of the English word\r\ncoachman. For another curious corruption of a similar kind, _see_\r\nSIMPKIN.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Gusher~, one overflowing with sentiment, a rhapsodizer. Romance-reading\r\nyoung ladies are generally described as GUSHING, and of late years the\r\nword GUSH has done duty as representing the newspaper work necessary for\r\na continuance of the “largest circulation.”\r\n\r\n~Gut scraper~, a fiddler.\r\n\r\n~Gutter blood~, a low or vulgar man.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Gutter lane~, the throat. Probably from GUTTUR.\r\n\r\n~Guttle~, _see_ GUZZLE.\r\n\r\n~Guy~, a fright, a dowdy, an ill-dressed person. Derived from the effigy\r\nof Guy Fawkes carried about by boys on Nov. 5. “Hollo, boys, another\r\nGUY!”\r\n\r\n~Guy~, to get away. Same as HEDGE in street phraseology, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Guzzle~, to eat or drink to excess; to eat loudly, hastily, and\r\nclumsily.\r\n\r\n~Gyp~, an undergraduate’s servant at Cambridge. Popularly derived by\r\nCantabs from the _Greek_, GYPS, (γύψ), a vulture, from the dishonest\r\nrapacity peculiar to GYPS. At Oxford servants are called scouts.\r\n\r\n~Hackle~, pluck; “to show HACKLE,” to be willing to fight. HACKLES are\r\nthe long feathers on the back of a cock’s neck, which he erects when\r\nangry,—hence the metaphor.\r\n\r\n~Hackslaver~, to stammer in one’s speech, like a dunce at his lesson.\r\n\r\n~Haddock~, a purse.—_See_ BEANS.\r\n\r\n~Hair of the dog~, a “modest quencher,” taken the morning following a\r\ndebauch. Originally a “HAIR OF THE DOG that bit you.” This is very old,\r\nand seems to show that homœopathy is by no means new, so far as topers,\r\nat all events, are concerned.\r\n\r\n~Half-a-bean~, half-a-sovereign.\r\n\r\n~Half-a-bull~, two shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\n~Half-a-couter~, half-a-sovereign.\r\n\r\n~Half-a-hog~, sixpence; sometimes termed HALF-A-GRUNTER.\r\n\r\n~Half-and-half~, a mixture of ale and porter, much affected by medical\r\nstudents; occasionally Latinized into “dimidium dimidiumque.” Cooper is\r\nHALF-AND-HALF, made of stout and porter. The term of HALF-AND-HALF is\r\nalso applied to the issue of marriages between gipsies and “white\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n~Half-a-stretch~, six months in prison.\r\n\r\n~Half-a-tusheroon~, half-a-crown.\r\n\r\n~Half-baked~, soft, doughy, half-witted, silly. HALF-ROCKED has a\r\nsimilar meaning.\r\n\r\n~Half-foolish~, ridiculous; means often wholly foolish.\r\n\r\n~Half Jack.~ _See_ JACKS.\r\n\r\n~Half-mourning~, to have a black eye from a blow. As distinguished from\r\n“whole-mourning,” two black eyes.\r\n\r\n~Half-rocked~, silly, half-witted. Derived from a vulgar idea that in\r\nthe Westcountry children are nursed in a peculiar manner, which in\r\nafterlife affects their wits. They are said to be nursed bottom upwards,\r\nso as to sleep without much rocking. If this is inconsequent it is the\r\nfault of the saying and not of the dictionary. Compare HALF-BAKED.\r\n\r\n~Half-seas-over~, reeling drunk.—_Sea._ Used by Swift.\r\n\r\n~Hall~, THE, Leadenhall Market, among folk who get their livings there,\r\nin the same way as “The Garden” refers to Covent Garden.\r\n\r\n~Hand~, a workman or helper, a person. “A cool HAND,” explained by Sir\r\nThomas Overbury to be “one who accounts bashfulness the wickedest thing\r\nin the world, and therefore studies impudence.”\r\n\r\n~Hander~, a second, or assistant. At some schools blows on the hand\r\nadministered with a cane are so called.\r\n\r\n~Handicap~, an arrangement by which, in any description of sport, every\r\ncompetitor in a race is supposed to have a chance of winning equal to\r\nthe chances of his opponents. HANDICAPPING, in horse-racing signifies\r\nthe adjudgment of various weights to horses differing in age, power, and\r\nspeed, so as to place them as much as possible on an equality. At other\r\nsports this equalization is managed by means of starts.\r\n\r\nThe old game of HANDICAP (hand i’ the cap) is a very different affair;\r\nand, as it is now almost obsolete, being only played by gentlemen in\r\nIreland, after hunting and racing dinners, when the wine has circulated\r\npretty freely, merits a description here. It is played by three persons,\r\nin the following manner:—A wishes to obtain some article belonging to\r\nB, say a horse; and offers to “challenge” his watch against it. B\r\nagrees; and C is chosen as HANDICAPPER to “make the award”—that is, to\r\nname the sum of money that the owner of the article of lesser value\r\nshall give with it, in exchange for the more valuable one. The three\r\nparties, A, B, and C, put down a certain stake each, and then the\r\nHANDICAPPER makes his award. If A and B are both satisfied with the\r\naward, the exchange is made between the horse and watch, and the\r\nHANDICAPPER wins, and takes up the stakes. Or if neither be satisfied\r\nwith the award, the HANDICAPPER takes the stakes; but if A be satisfied\r\nand B not, or _vice versâ_, the party who declares himself satisfied\r\ngets the stakes. It is consequently the object of the HANDICAPPER to\r\nmake such award as will cause the challenger and challenged to be of the\r\nsame mind; and considerable ingenuity is required and exhibited on his\r\npart. The challenge having been made, as stated, between A’s watch and\r\nB’s horse, each party puts his HAND into a CAP or hat [or into his\r\npocket] while C makes the award, which he purposely does in as rapid and\r\ncomplex a manner as possible. Thus, after humorously exaggerating the\r\nvarious excellences of the articles, he may say—“The owner of the\r\nsuperior gold lever watch shall give to the owner of the beautiful\r\nthoroughbred bay horse, called Flyaway, the watch and fifteen\r\nhalf-crowns, seven crowns, eighteen half-guineas, one hundred and forty\r\ngroats, thirteen sovereigns, fifty-nine pence, seventeen shillings and\r\nsixty-three farthings. Draw, gentlemen!” A and B must instantly then\r\ndraw out and open their hands. If money appears in both, they are\r\nagreed, and the award stands good; if money be in neither hand, they are\r\nalso agreed, but the award is rejected. If money be only in one hand,\r\nthey are not agreed, the award is off, and the stakes go as already\r\nstated. Very frequently, neither A nor B is sufficiently quick in his\r\nmental calculation to follow the HANDICAPPER, and not knowing on the\r\ninstant the total of the various sums in the award, prefers being “off,”\r\nand, therefore, “draws” no money. As in this event the HANDICAPPER gets\r\nthe stakes, the reason for the complex nature of his award is obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen HANDICAPPING has once commenced in a convivial party, it is\r\nconsidered unsportsmanlike to refuse a challenge. So when the small\r\nhours draw on, and the fun becomes fast and furious, coats, boots,\r\nwaistcoats, even shirts are challenged, HANDICAPPED, and exchanged,\r\namidst an almost indescribable scene of good humoured joviality and\r\nstentorian laughter. This is the true HANDICAP. The application of the\r\nterm to horse-racing has arisen from one or more persons being chosen to\r\nmake the award between persons, who put down equal sums of money, on\r\nentering horses unequal in power and speed for the same race. So that\r\nthe HANDICAP has ultimately come to be regarded as an arrangement of a\r\npurely business-like nature, by which means affairs, no matter how much\r\nthey may differ in degree, may be arranged satisfactorily by all\r\nparties. The use of the word is spreading rapidly, and it has already a\r\nsense beyond that of mere sporting.\r\n\r\n~Handicap~, to make even, as a Roland for an Oliver. Not long since in a\r\npedestrian enclosure, a pugilist who had been specially retained on one\r\nside struck a member of the other party, who not being a fighting-man\r\nreceived the blow with apparent contentment. The injured person had,\r\nhowever, determined on being revenged, and about an hour afterwards he\r\nknocked the professional down with a big stick, using the words at the\r\nsame time, “that HANDICAPS us” (that makes us even). The word is often\r\nused thus also: A man finding himself inferior to another at fisticuffs\r\nwill, seizing a weapon, exclaim, “I’ll HANDICAP you,” _i.e._, I’ll bring\r\nyou to my level (or “level myself up”) with this.\r\n\r\n~Handle~, a nose; the title appended to a person’s name; also a term in\r\nboxing, “to HANDLE one’s fists,” to use them against an adversary.\r\n\r\n~Handling~, a method of concealing certain cards in the palm of the\r\nhand, or in fashionable long wristbands; one of the many modes of\r\ncheating practised by sharpers.\r\n\r\n~Hand-me-downs~, second-hand clothes. _See_ REACH-ME-DOWNS.\r\n\r\n~Hand-saw~, or CHIVE FENCER, a man who sells razors and knives in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n~Handseller~, or CHEAP JACK, a street or open-air seller, a man who\r\ncarries goods to his customers, instead of waiting for his customers to\r\nvisit him.\r\n\r\n~Hanging~, in difficulties. A man who is in great straits, and who is,\r\ntherefore, prepared to do anything desperate to retrieve his fortunes,\r\nis said, among sporting men, to be “a man HANGING,” _i.e._, a man to\r\nwhom any change must be for the better.\r\n\r\n~Hangman’s wages~, thirteenpence halfpenny.—_Old. 17th century._\r\n\r\n    “’Sfoot, what a witty rogue was this to leave this fair\r\n    thirteenpence halfpenny, and this old halter,” intimating aptly—\r\n\r\n    “Had the hangman met us there, by these presages\r\n    Here had been his work, and here his wages.”\r\n\r\n        _Match at Midnight._\r\n\r\nThe clothes of the culprit were also the hangman’s wages. See one of\r\nLord Bacon’s aphorisms, beginning “A cursed page.”\r\n\r\n~Hang out~, to reside,—in allusion to the ancient custom of hanging out\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\n~Hang up~, to rob with violence, to garrotte. Most likely from\r\nthrottling associations in connexion with the practice of garrotting.\r\n\r\n~Hannah~, “that’s the man as married HANNAH,” a Salopian phrase to\r\nexpress a matter begun or ended satisfactorily. Meaning actually,\r\n“that’s the thing.”\r\n\r\n~Hansel~, or HANDSEL, the lucky money, or first money taken in the\r\nmorning by a pedlar.—_Cocker’s Dictionary_, 1724. “Legs of mutton\r\n(street term for sheep’s trotters, or feet) two for a penny; who’ll give\r\nme a HANSEL? who’ll give me a HANSEL?” Hence, earnest money,\r\nfirst-fruits, &c. In Norfolk, HANSELLING a thing is using it for the\r\nfirst time, as wearing a new coat, taking seisin of it, as it were.\r\nDanish, HANDSEL; _Anglo-Saxon_, HANDSELEN.\r\n\r\n~Ha’porth o’ coppers~, Habeas Corpus.—_Legal slang._\r\n\r\n~Ha’porth o’ liveliness~, the music at a low concert, or theatre. Also a\r\ndilatory person.\r\n\r\n~Happy-go-lucky~, careless, indifferent as to the favours or reverses of\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n~Haramzadeh~, a very general Indian term of contempt, signifying\r\nbase-born.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Hard lines~, hardship, difficulty. Soldiers’ term for hard duty on the\r\nlines in front of the enemy. LINES was formerly synonymous with _Lot_,\r\n_see_ Ps. xvi. 6.—_Bible version_—“The LINES are fallen unto me in\r\npleasant places;” _Prayer-Book do._—“The LOT is fallen unto me in a\r\nfair ground.”\r\n\r\n~Hard mouthed un~, any one difficult to deal with, a sharp bargainer, an\r\nobstinate person. Derivation obvious.\r\n\r\n~Hard tack~, ship biscuits. This is a term used by sailors to\r\ndistinguish their ordinary sea-bread from that obtained on shore, which\r\nis called soft TACK, or soft tommy. HARD TACK is also a phrase used by\r\nthe London lower classes to signify coarse or insufficient food.\r\n\r\n~Hard-up~, a cigar-end finder, who collects the refuse pieces of smoked\r\ncigars from the gutter, and having dried them, smokes them, or sells\r\nthem as tobacco to the very poor. _See_ TOPPER.\r\n\r\n~Hard-up~, in distress, poverty-stricken.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Hardy~, a stone.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Harebrained~, reckless, unthinking.\r\n\r\n~Harry~, or OLD HARRY, (_i.e._, Old Hairy?) the Devil; “to play OLD\r\nHARRY with one,” _i.e._, ruin or annoy him.\r\n\r\n~Harry-soph~, (ἐρίσοφος, very wise indeed), a student of law or physic\r\nat Cambridge who, being of the same standing as the students in arts in\r\nhis year, is allowed to wear a full-sleeved gown when they assume their\r\nB.A. gowns, though he does not obtain his actual degree so soon. An\r\nundergraduate in his last year is a Senior Soph, in his last term a\r\nQuestionist.\r\n\r\n~Harum-scarum~, wild, dissipated, reckless; four horses driven in a\r\nline. This is also called SUICIDE. _See_ TANDEM, RANDEM, UNICORN, &c.\r\n\r\n~Hash~, a mess, confusion; “a pretty HASH he made of it;” to HASH UP, to\r\njumble together without order or regularity. The term also occurs in the\r\nphrase “to settle his HASH,” which is equivalent to “give him his\r\ngruel,” or “cook his goose,” _i.e._, to kill him.\r\n\r\n~Hatchet~, “to throw the HATCHET,” to tell lies. Same as “to draw the\r\nlong bow.”\r\n\r\n~Hatchet~, “to sling the HATCHET,” to skulk.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Hawbuck~, a vulgar, ignorant, country fellow, but one remove from the\r\nclodpole.\r\n\r\n~Hawse holes~, the apertures in a ship’s bows through which the cables\r\npass; “he has crept in through the HAWSE-HOLES,” said of an officer who\r\nhas risen from the grade of an ordinary seaman, whose original position\r\nin the vessel was forward—before the mast.—_Navy._\r\n\r\n~Hay bag~, a woman.\r\n\r\n~Haymarket Hectors~, bullies who, in the interest of prostitutes, affect\r\nthe neighbourhood of Leicester Square and the Haymarket.\r\n\r\n~Haze~, to confuse and annoy a subordinate by contradictory,\r\nunnecessary, and perplexing orders.\r\n\r\n~Hazy~, intoxicated, also dull and stupid.\r\n\r\n~Head-beetler~, the bully of the workshop, who lords it over his\r\nfellow-workmen by reason of superior strength, skill in fighting, &c.\r\nSometimes applied to the foreman.\r\n\r\n~Header~, a plunge head foremost into water, or a fall in the same\r\nposture from accident. Nowadays a theatrical expression for any\r\nsupposedly daring jump of hero or heroine in sensational dramas.\r\n\r\n~Head or tail~, “I can’t make HEAD OR TAIL of it,” _i.e._, cannot make\r\nit out. Originally a gambling phrase.\r\n\r\n~Head-rails~, the teeth.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Head-serag~, a master, overseer, or other important personage; from\r\nSERANG, a boatswain.—_Bengalee_, and _Sea_.\r\n\r\n~Heap~, “a HEAP of people,” a crowd; “struck all of a HEAP,” suddenly\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n~Heat~, a bout, or turn, in horse or foot racing. By means of heats the\r\nfield is gradually reduced.\r\n\r\n~Heavy dragoons~, bugs, in contradistinction from fleas, which are\r\n“light infantry.”—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Heavy wet~, malt liquor—because the more a man drinks of it, the\r\nheavier and more stupid he becomes.\r\n\r\n~Hedge~, to get away from any dangerous spot. “We saw the slop coming,\r\nand HEDGED at once.”\r\n\r\n~Hedge~, to secure oneself from loss over one bet by making others.\r\nHEDGING, as a system of betting, is entirely dependent upon what happens\r\nin the market after a horse has been backed. From information, or good\r\njudgment, a backer selects, say, three horses, A, B, and C, whom he\r\nthinks likely to advance in the betting, and takes 50 to 1—say £1000 to\r\n£20—against each of them. As the race-day approaches the horse A may\r\nfall out of the betting, from accident or other cause, and have to be\r\nwritten off as a dead loss of £20. But the other two horses, as\r\nanticipated, improve in public favour, and the backer, who now becomes a\r\nHEDGER, succeeds in laying 5 to 1—say £500 to £100—against B, and 2 to\r\n1—say 500 to £250—against C. The account then stands thus:—A is a\r\ncertain loss of £20; but if B wins, the HEDGER will receive £1000 and\r\npay £500; balance in favour, £500. If B loses, the HEDGER will receive\r\n£100 and pay £20; balance in favour, £80. If C wins, the hedger will\r\nreceive £1000 and pay £500; balance in favour, £500. If C loses, the\r\nHEDGER will receive £250 and pay £20; balance in favour, £230.\r\nDeducting, then, the loss of £20 on A, the HEDGER’S winnings will be\r\nconsiderable; and he cannot lose, providing his information or judgment\r\nlead to the required result. It must be borne in mind that very often a\r\nman who feels inclined to go in for a HEDGING speculation, may back half\r\na dozen horses, not one of which sees a short price or goes to the post;\r\nbesides which it must never be forgotten, that, however well turf\r\nspeculations may look on paper, they are subject to the contingency of\r\nthe bets being honourably paid on settling-day—the Monday after a\r\nrace—when unfortunately there are often more “receivers” than “payers”\r\nat the clubs. However, turf transactions are among professionals\r\nconducted at least as honourably as are any other business matters; and\r\nit is only the fledgling swell, to whom the Legislature gives special\r\nopportunities of losing his money, who is generally _non est_ when\r\npaytime comes. “The Druid” in _Post and Paddock_ has remarked:—\r\n\r\n    “The term HEDGING has been quite superseded by “laying off;” and we\r\n    had, in fact, quite forgotten it till we saw it stated in the papers\r\n    lately, by a clergyman, who did not answer a question on doctrine as\r\n    the Bishop of Exeter exactly liked, that his lordship addressed him\r\n    to this effect: ‘You are HEDGING, sir; you are HEDGING!’”\r\n\r\nUsually correct as “The Druid” was, he seems to have fallen into an\r\nerror here, as HEDGING, and “laying off,” have been exchangeable terms,\r\nas far as the oldest turfite can say. It should be remembered that\r\nHEDGING is generally done with the man who has originally laid the odds;\r\nfor as a natural consequence, when the backer finds it convenient to\r\nhedge, the layer finds it equally so to back the horse back,—the first\r\nloss being considered always the best by bookmakers who _are_\r\nbookmakers. Besides which, the layer has generally a lot of “dead\r\nmoney”—money to the good over horses he has laid against, which have\r\nsince been struck out—and this he profitably expends in backing certain\r\nhorses back for the purpose of levelling up the book.\r\n\r\n~Hedge-popping~, shooting small birds about the hedges, as boys do;\r\nunsportsmanlike kind of shooting.\r\n\r\n~Heel-tap~, the small quantity of wine or other beverage left in the\r\nbottom of a glass, considered as a sign that the liquor is not liked,\r\nand therefore unfriendly and unsocial to the host and the company. _See_\r\nDAY-LIGHT.\r\n\r\n~Heigh-ho!~ a cant term for stolen yarn, from the expression used to\r\napprize the dishonest shopkeeper that the speaker had stolen yarn to\r\nsell.—_Norwich Cant._\r\n\r\n~Hell~, a fashionable gambling-house. Small places of this kind are\r\ncalled “silver hells.” Reason obvious.\r\n\r\n~Hell and Tommy~, utter destruction.\r\n\r\n~Helter-skelter~, anyhow, without regard to order or precedence.\r\n\r\n~Hempen cravat~, the hangman’s noose.\r\n\r\n~Hen and Chickens~, large and small pewter pots.\r\n\r\n~Hen-pecked~, said of one whose wife “wears the breeches.” From the\r\naction of the hen in paired cage-birds.\r\n\r\n~Herring-pond~, the sea; “to be sent across the HERRING-POND,” to be\r\ntransported.\r\n\r\n~Hiding~, a thrashing. Webster gives this word, but not its root, HIDE,\r\nto beat, to flay by whipping. Most likely from the part attacked. The\r\nthreat of thrashing is sometimes conveyed thus:—“I’ll tan (or dress)\r\nyour HIDE.”\r\n\r\n~Higgledy-piggledy~, confusedly, all together,—as pigs lie.\r\n\r\n~High and dry~, an epithet applied to the _soi-disant_ “orthodox” clergy\r\nof the last century, for whom, while ill-paid curates did the work, the\r\ncomforts of the Establishment were its greatest charms.\r\n\r\n    “Wherein are various ranks, and due degrees,\r\n    The Bench for honour, and the Stall for ease.”\r\n\r\nThough often confounded with, they are utterly dissimilar to, the modern\r\nHigh Church or Anglo-Catholic party, who now receive the title at times;\r\nwhile their opponents receive the corresponding appellation of “Low and\r\nSlow,” and the so-called “Broad Church” is defined with equal felicity as\r\nthe “Broad and Shallow.” Humourists have divided these three portions of\r\none Church into Attitudinarians, Platitudinarians, and Latitudinarians.\r\n\r\n~High Church~, term used in contradistinction from “Low Church.”\r\n\r\n~Highfalutin’~, showy, affected, tinselled, affecting certain pompous or\r\nfashionable airs, stuck up; “come, none of yer HIGHFALUTIN’ games,”\r\n_i.e._, you must not show off or imitate the swell here.—_American_\r\nslang, now common in Liverpool and the East-end of London. From the\r\n_Dutch_, VERLOOTEN. Used generally now in the sense of fustian,\r\nhigh-sounding, unmeaning eloquence, bombast.\r\n\r\n~High-flier~, anything above the common order. Apt students, fast\r\ncoaches, and special trains are sufficient instances of the extreme\r\nopenness of the qualification.\r\n\r\n~High-fly~, “ON THE HIGH-FLY,” on the genteel or letter-bearing begging\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n~High-flyer~, a genteel beggar or swindler. A begging-letter impostor.\r\n\r\n~High-flyer~, a large swing, in frames, at fairs and races. The first\r\nfast coaches were called high-flyers on account of their desperate\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n~High jinks~, “ON THE HIGH JINKS,” taking up an arrogant position,\r\nassuming an undue superiority. Scott explains this game in _Guy\r\nMannering_. Nowadays HIGH JINKS is often used to mean a jollification.\r\n\r\n~High-lows~, laced boots reaching a trifle higher than ankle-jacks.\r\n\r\n~High-strikes~, corruption of _Hysterics_.\r\n\r\n~Hipped~, bored, offended, crossed, low-spirited, &c. This may have been\r\noriginally hypped, and have had some connexion with hypochondriacal\r\naffections.\r\n\r\n~Hitched~, an Americanism for married. From the word HITCH, used in\r\nAmerica in the sense of to harness.\r\n\r\n~Hittite~, a facetious sporting term for a prize-fighter. Derived from\r\nthe Bible.\r\n\r\n~Hivite~, a student of St. Begh’s College, Cumberland, which is\r\npronounced and generally written St. Bee’s. Literally, Hive-ite.\r\n\r\n~Hoax~, to deceive, or ridicule,—Grose says this was originally a\r\nUniversity cant word. Corruption of HOCUS, to cheat.\r\n\r\n~Hob and nob~, to act in concert with another; to lay “heads together;”\r\nto touch glasses in drinking; to fraternize in a convivial meeting or\r\nmerry-making. Originally meaning “foot and head,”—the touching of the\r\ntop of one glass with the bottom of another, and then reversing the\r\norder. Nowadays it means simply to clink glasses together as a\r\nsalutation before imbibing.\r\n\r\n~Hobbadehoy~, a youth who has ceased to regard himself as a boy, and is\r\nnot yet regarded as a man.\r\n\r\n~Hobble~, trouble of any kind. A man is said to be in a HOBBLE when he\r\nhas offended the proprieties in any way, “from pitch and toss to\r\nmanslaughter.”\r\n\r\n~Hobbled~, committed for trial; properly said of animals fed by the\r\nwayside, with their forelegs fastened together. Hence people who gather\r\nburdens about them are said to get into HOBBLES.\r\n\r\n~Hob Collingwood~, according to Brockett, a north country term for the\r\nfour of hearts, considered an unlucky card.\r\n\r\n~Hobson’s choice~, “this or none.” Hobson was a carrier at Cambridge,\r\nand also a letter-out of horses for hire; and is said to have always\r\ncompelled his customers to take the horse that stood in the stall next\r\nthe stable-door or none at all. He was a benefactor to the town, and\r\nHobson’s Conduit still stands as a memorial of him.\r\n\r\n~Hock-dockies~, shoes.\r\n\r\n~Hocks~, the feet and ankles; CURBY HOCKS, round or clumsy feet and\r\nankles. Term originating with horsey men.\r\n\r\n~Hocus~, to drug a person for purposes of robbery. The potion generally\r\nconsists of snuff and beer among rogues of the lowest class, and is by\r\nthem called “snuffing a bloke;” or sometimes, when the drug is\r\nadministered to a woman for purposes other than those of robbery,\r\n“snuffing a blowen.”\r\n\r\n~Hocus pocus~, gipsy words of magic, similar to the modern “presto fly.”\r\nThe gipsies pronounce “_Habeas Corpus_,” HAWCUS PACCUS (_see_ Crabb’s\r\n_Gipsies’ Advocate_, p. 18); can this have anything to do with the\r\norigin of HOCUS POCUS? Turner gives OCHUS BOCHUS, an old demon. Pegge,\r\nhowever, states that it is a burlesque rendering of the words of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church service at the delivery of the host, HOC EST\r\nCORPUS, which the early Protestants considered as a species of\r\nconjuring, and ridiculed accordingly.\r\n\r\n~Hodge~, a countryman or provincial clown. Most country districts in\r\nEngland have one or more families in the name of HODGE; indeed, GILES\r\nand HODGE appear to be the favourite hobnail nomenclature. HODGE is said\r\nto be simply an abbreviation of Roger.\r\n\r\n~Hog~, a shilling.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Hog~, “to go the whole HOG;” “the whole HOG or none,” to do anything\r\nwith a person’s entire strength, not “by halves;” realized by the phrase\r\n“in for a penny in for a pound.” Bartlett claims this to be a pure\r\nAmerican phrase; whilst Ker, of course, gives it a Dutch origin.—_Old._\r\n“To go the whole HOG” is frequently altered by those people who believe\r\nthere is wit in circumlocution, into “the entire animal,” or “the\r\ncomplete swine!”\r\n\r\n~Hoga~, do. “That wont HOGA,” _i.e._, that wont do, is one of the very\r\ncommonest of the Anglo-Indian slang phrases.\r\n\r\n~Hogmagundy~, the process by which the population is increased.\r\n\r\n    “There’s many a job that day begun\r\n    That ends in Hogmagundy.”—_Burns._\r\n\r\n~Hogmany night~, New Year’s Eve, when presents are solicited by the\r\nyoung folk.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Hogo~, a tremendous stench. From _haut goût_. Now often pronounced\r\nFOGO.\r\n\r\n~Hoisting~, shoplifting.\r\n\r\n~Hold hard~, an exclamation made when a sudden stoppage is desired.\r\nOriginally an expression used in riding or driving, now general.\r\n\r\n~Hollow~, “to beat HOLLOW,” to excel.\r\n\r\n~Holy Joe~, a sea-term for a parson.\r\n\r\n~Holy Land~, a very old term for the Seven Dials,—where St. Giles’s\r\nGreek is spoken.\r\n\r\n~Homo~, a man. _Lingua Franca_; but _see_ OMEE, the more usual Cockney\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\n~Hondey~, a Manchester name for an omnibus, and the abbreviation of\r\nHONDEYBUSH, the original Lancashire pronunciation of the word.\r\n\r\n~Honest Shilling~, a shilling earned by a process actually immoral, but\r\nnot positively illegal. The money earned by a prostitute is said to be\r\nhonest, as distinguished from that obtained by a thief. Probably from\r\nthe story of the converted burglar, who determined to sin no more\r\nhimself, and who lectured against dishonesty, but sent his wife out\r\nregularly every evening with instructions to earn an HONEST SHILLING.\r\n\r\n~Honey blobs~, a Scotch term for large ripe, yellow gooseberries.\r\n\r\n~Honour bright~, an asseveration which means literally, “by my honour,\r\nwhich is bright and unsullied.” It is often still further curtailed to\r\n“HONOUR!” only.\r\n\r\n~Hook~, an expression at Oxford, implying doubt, either connected with\r\nHookey Walker, or with a note of interrogation (?) “Yes, with a HOOK at\r\nthe end of it!” _i.e._, with some reservation, generally that of doubt,\r\nby the speaker.\r\n\r\n~Hook~, to steal or rob. _See_ the following.\r\n\r\n~Hook or by crook~, by fair means or foul—in allusion to the hook with\r\nwhich footpads used to steal from open windows, &c., and from which\r\nHOOK, to take or steal, has been derived. Mentioned in _Hudibras_ as a\r\ncant term.\r\n\r\n~Hook it~, “get out of the way,” or “be off about your business;”\r\ngenerally varied by “take your HOOK.” “To HOOK it,” to run away, to\r\ndecamp; “on one’s own HOOK,” dependent upon one’s own exertions.\r\nOriginally connected with the preceding, but now perfectly “on its own\r\nHOOK.”\r\n\r\n~Hookey walker!~ ejaculation of incredulity, usually shortened to\r\nWALKER!—which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Hooks~, “dropped off the HOOKS,” said of a deceased person—possibly\r\nderived from the ancient practice of suspending on hooks the quarters of\r\na traitor or felon sentenced by the old law to be hung, drawn, and\r\nquartered, which dropped off the hooks as they decayed.\r\n\r\n~Hook um snivey~ (formerly “HOOK and SNIVEY”), a low expression, meaning\r\nto cheat by feigning sickness or other means. Also a piece of thick iron\r\nwire crooked at one end, and fastened into a wooden handle, for the\r\npurpose of undoing from the outside the wooden bolt of a door. Sometimes\r\nused as an irrelevant answer by street boys. As, “who did that?”—“HOOK\r\nUM SNIVEY”—actually no one.\r\n\r\n~Hop~, a dance.—_Fashionable slang._\r\n\r\n~Hop merchant~, a dancing master.\r\n\r\n~Hop o’ my thumb~, an undersized person. From the story of that name.\r\nPortion of a set of phrases established for the benefit of the small, in\r\nwhich Tomtit, Little Breeches, Daniel Lambert, Sixfoot, Twentystun, &c.,\r\nplay a prominent part.\r\n\r\n~Hopping Giles~, a cripple. St. Ægidius or Giles, himself similarly\r\nafflicted, was the patron saint of lazars and cripples. The ancient\r\nlazar houses were dedicated to him.\r\n\r\n~Hoppo~, custom-house officer, or custom-house. Almost anything\r\nconnected with custom-house business.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Hop the twig~, to run away; also, a flippant expression meaning to die.\r\nMany similar phrases are used by the thoughtless and jocose, as “laying\r\ndown one’s knife and fork,” “pegging out,” from the game of cribbage,\r\nand “snuffing it.” A new form of this phraseology is to say that a man\r\nhas “given up” or “given in.”\r\n\r\n~Hornswoggle~, nonsense, humbug. Believed to be of American origin.\r\n\r\n~Horrors~, the low spirits, or “blue devils,” which follow intoxication.\r\nIncipient _del. trem._\r\n\r\n~Horse~, contraction of Horsemonger-Lane Gaol, also a slang term for a\r\nfive-pound note.\r\n\r\n~Horse~, to flog. From the old wooden horse or flogging-stool.\r\n\r\n~Horsebreaker.~ _See_ PRETTY HORSEBREAKER.\r\n\r\n~Horse chaunter~, a dealer who takes worthless horses to country fairs\r\nand disposes of them by artifice. He is generally an unprincipled\r\nfellow, and will put in a glass eye, fill a beast with shot, plug him\r\nwith ginger, or in fact do anything so that he sells to advantage. _See_\r\nCOPER.\r\n\r\n~Horse marine~, an awkward person. In ancient times the “jollies,” or\r\nRoyal Marines, were the butts of the sailors, from their ignorance of\r\nseamanship. “Tell that to the MARINES, the blue jackets wont believe\r\nit!” was a common rejoinder to a “stiff yarn.” A HORSE MARINE (an\r\nimpossibility) was used to denote one more awkward even than an ordinary\r\n“jolly.” Nowadays the MARINES are deservedly appreciated as one of the\r\nfinest regiments in the service.\r\n\r\n~Horse nails.~ At the game of cribbage, when a player finds it his\r\npolicy to keep his antagonist back, rather than push himself forward,\r\nand plays accordingly, he is sometimes said “to feed his opponent on\r\nHORSE NAILS.”\r\n\r\n~Horse nails~, money.—_Compare_ BRADS.\r\n\r\n~Horse’s nightcap~, a halter; “to die in a HORSE’S NIGHTCAP,” to be\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n~Horsey~, like a groom or jockey. Applied also to persons who affect the\r\nturf in dress or conversation.\r\n\r\n~Hot coppers~, the feverish sensations experienced in the morning by\r\nthose who have been drunk over-night.\r\n\r\n~Hot tiger~, an Oxford mixture of hot-spiced ale and sherry.\r\n\r\n~House of Commons~, a humorous term for the closet of decency.\r\n\r\n~Houses;~ “safe as HOUSES,” an expression to satisfy a doubting person;\r\n“Oh! it’s as safe as HOUSES,” _i.e._, perfectly safe, apparently in\r\nallusion to the paying character of house property as an investment. It\r\nis said the phrase originated when the railway bubbles began to burst,\r\nand when people began to turn their attention to the more ancient forms\r\nof speculation, which though slow were sure.\r\n\r\n~Housewarming~, the first friendly gathering in a new or\r\nfreshly-occupied house.\r\n\r\n~How-came-you-so?~ intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~How much?~ A facetious way of asking for an explanation of any\r\ndifficult or pedantic expression. “Why don’t you cook your potatoes in\r\nan anhydrohepsaterion?” A waggish listener might be excused for asking,\r\n“An anhydro—HOW MUCH!”\r\n\r\n~How’s your poor feet?~ an idiotic street cry with no meaning, much in\r\nvogue a few years back.\r\n\r\n~Hoxter~, an inside pocket.—_Old English_, OXTER. Probably the low\r\nslang word HUXTER, money, is derived from this. OXTER is, among the\r\nIrish, an armpit.\r\n\r\n~Hubble bubble~, the Indian pipe termed a hookah is thus designated,\r\nfrom the noise it makes when being smoked.\r\n\r\n~Huey~, a town or village.—_Tramps’ term._\r\n\r\n~Huff~, a dodge or trick; “don’t try that HUFF on me,” or “that HUFF\r\nwont do.” Also a term in the game of draughts,—the penalty for failing\r\nto take an opponent’s piece when an opportunity occurs.\r\n\r\n~Huff~, to vex, to offend; a poor temper. HUFFY, easily offended.\r\nHUFFED, annoyed, offended. Some folk are tersely and truly described as\r\neasily HUFFED.\r\n\r\n~Hugger-mugger~, underhand, sneaking. Also, “in a state of\r\nHUGGER-MUGGER” means to be muddled.\r\n\r\n~Hulk~, to hang about in hopes of an invitation. _See_ MOOCH.\r\n\r\n~Hulky~, extra-sized.—_Shropshire._ From this and from hulk we probably\r\nget our adjective HULKING, as applied to the great lazy ruffians who\r\ninfest low neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\n~Hum and haw~, to hesitate, or raise objections.—_Old English._\r\n\r\n~Humble pie~, to “eat HUMBLE PIE,” to knock under, to be submissive. The\r\nUMBLES, or entrails, and other unprime parts of a deer, were anciently\r\nmade into a dish for servants, while their masters feasted off the\r\nhaunch.\r\n\r\n~Hum-box~, a pulpit. This is a very old term.\r\n\r\n~Humbug~, an imposition, or a person who imposes upon others. A very\r\nexpressive but slang word, synonymous at one time with HUM AND HAW.\r\nLexicographers for a long time objected to the adoption of this term.\r\nRichardson uses it frequently to express the meaning of other words,\r\nbut, strange to say, omits it in the alphabetical arrangement as\r\nunworthy of recognition! In the first edition of this work, 1785 was\r\ngiven as the earliest date at which the word could be found in a printed\r\nbook. Since then HUMBUG has been traced half a century further back, on\r\nthe title-page of a singular old jest-book—“_The Universal Jester_; or\r\na pocket companion for the Wits: being a choice collection of merry\r\nconceits, facetious drolleries, &c., clenchers, closers, closures,\r\nbon-mots, and HUMBUGS,” by Ferdinando Killigrew. London, about 1735-40.\r\n\r\nThe notorious Orator Henley was known to the mob as ORATOR HUMBUG. The\r\nfact may be learned from an illustration in that exceedingly curious\r\nlittle collection of _Caricatures_, published in 1757, many of which\r\nwere sketched by Lord Bolingbroke—Horace Walpole filling in the names\r\nand explanations. Halliwell describes HUMBUG as “a person who hums,” and\r\ncites Dean Milles’s MS., which was written about 1760. In the last\r\ncentury, the game now known as double-dummy was termed HUMBUG. Lookup, a\r\nnotorious gambler, was struck down by apoplexy when playing at this\r\ngame. On the circumstance being reported to Foote, the wit said—“Ah, I\r\nalways thought he would be HUMBUGGED out of the world at last!” It has\r\nbeen stated that the word is a corruption of Hamburgh, from which town\r\nso many false bulletins and reports came during the war in the last\r\ncentury. “Oh, that is _Hamburgh_ [or HUMBUG],” was the answer to any\r\nfresh piece of news which smacked of improbability. Grose mentions it in\r\nhis Dictionary, 1785; and in a little printed squib, published in 1808,\r\nentitled _Bath Characters_, by T. Goosequill, HUMBUG is thus mentioned\r\nin a comical couplet on the title-page:—\r\n\r\n    “Wee Thre Bath Deities bee,\r\n    HUMBUG, Follie, and Varietee.”\r\n\r\nGradually from this time the word began to assume a place in periodical\r\nliterature, and in novels written by not over-precise authors. In the\r\npreface to a flat, and most likely unprofitable poem, entitled, _The\r\nReign of HUMBUG, a Satire_, 8vo, 1836, the author thus apologizes for\r\nthe use of the word:—“I have used the term HUMBUG to designate this\r\nprinciple [wretched sophistry of life generally], considering that, it\r\nis now adopted into our language as much as the words dunce, jockey,\r\ncheat, swindler, &c., which were formerly only colloquial terms.” A\r\ncorrespondent, who in a number of _Adversaria_ ingeniously traced\r\nbombast to the inflated Doctor Paracelsus Bombast, considers that HUMBUG\r\nmay, in like manner, be derived from Homberg, the distinguished chemist\r\nof the court of the Duke of Orleans, who, according to the following\r\npassage from Bishop Berkeley’s _Siris_, was an ardent and successful\r\nseeker after the philosopher’s stone!\r\n\r\n    “§194.—Of this there cannot be a better proof than the experiment\r\n    of Monsieur Homberg, who made gold of mercury by introducing light\r\n    into its pores, but at such trouble and expense that, I suppose,\r\n    nobody will try the experiment for profit. By this injunction of\r\n    light and mercury, both bodies became fixed, and produced a\r\n    third different to either, to wit, real gold. For the truth\r\n    of which fact I refer to the memoirs of the French Academy of\r\n    Sciences.”—_Berkeley’s Works_, vol ii. p. 366 (Wright’s edition).\r\n\r\nAnother derivation suggested is that of AMBAGE, a Latin word adopted\r\ninto the English language _temp._ Charles I. (_see_ May’s translation\r\nof Lucan’s _Pharsalia_), and meaning conduct the reverse of\r\nstraightforward. Again, in the (burlesque) _Loves of Hero and Leander_\r\n(date 1642), we find “MUM-BUG, quoth he, ’twas known of yore,” a cant\r\nexpression, no doubt, commanding a person to “shut up,” or hold his\r\ntongue, and evidently derived from the game of _mum-budget_ or\r\n_silence_, upon which Halliwell (_Dict. Arch_.) has descanted.\r\n\r\n    AMBAGE is also used in the sense of “circumlocution.” “Without any\r\n    long studie or tedious AMBAGE.”—_Puttenham_, _Art of Poesie_.\r\n\r\n    “Umh! y’ are full of AMBAGE.”—_Decker’s Whore of Babylon_, 1607.\r\n\r\n    “Thus from her cell Cumæan Sibyl sings\r\n    Ambiguous AMBAGES, the cloyster rings\r\n    With the shrill sound thereof, in most dark strains.”\r\n\r\n        _Vicar’s Virgil_, 1632.\r\n\r\nDe Quincey thus discourses upon the word:—\r\n\r\n    “The word HUMBUG, for instance, rests upon a rich and comprehensive\r\n    basis; it cannot be rendered adequately either by German or by\r\n    Greek, the two richest of human languages; and without this\r\n    expressive word we should all be disarmed for one great case,\r\n    continually recurrent, of social enormity. A vast mass of villany,\r\n    that cannot otherwise be reached by legal penalties, or brought\r\n    within the rhetoric of scorn, would go at large with absolute\r\n    impunity were it not through the stern Rhadamanthean aid of this\r\n    virtuous and inexorable word.”—_Article on “Language.”_\r\n\r\nThe original collater of these notes purchased the collection of essays\r\nknown as the _Connoisseur_ at the sale of Thackeray’s library. At the\r\nend of vol. i. he found a memorandum in the great humourist’s\r\nhandwriting—“p. 108, ‘HUMBUG,’ a new-coined expression.” On referring\r\nto that page (in the 3rd edition, 1757) this paragraph was noted:—\r\n\r\n    “The same conduct of keeping close to their ranks was observed at\r\n    table, where the ladies seated themselves together. Their\r\n    conversation was here also confined wholly to themselves, and seemed\r\n    like the mysteries of the _Bona Dea_, in which men were forbidden to\r\n    have any share. It was a continued laugh and whisper from the\r\n    beginning to the end of dinner. A whole sentence was scarce ever\r\n    spoken aloud. Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; such\r\n    as, odious, horrible, detestable, shocking, HUMBUG. This last\r\n    new-coined expression, which is only to be found in the nonsensical\r\n    vocabulary, sounds absurd and disagreeable whenever it is\r\n    pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it is ‘shocking,’\r\n    ‘detestable,’ ‘horrible,’ and ‘odious.’”\r\n\r\nThe use of this term is almost universal; in California there is a town\r\ncalled Humbug Flat—a name which gives a significant hint of the\r\nacuteness of the first settler.\r\n\r\n~Humdrum~, monotonous, tedious, tiresome, boring; “a society of\r\ngentlemen who used to meet near the Charter House, and at the King’s\r\nHead, St. John’s Street, Clerkenwell. They were characterized by less\r\nmystery and more pleasantry than the Freemasons.”—_Bacchus and Venus_,\r\n1737. In the West the term applies to a low cart.\r\n\r\n~Humming~, strong as applied to drink. Extra strong ale is often\r\ncharacterized as “HUMMING October.” Maybe from its effect on heads not\r\nquite so strong.\r\n\r\n~Hump~, low spirits. A costermonger who was annoyed or distressed about\r\nanything would describe himself as having “the HUMP.”\r\n\r\n~Hump~, to botch, or spoil.\r\n\r\n~Hump up~, “to have one’s HUMP UP,” to be cross or ill-tempered—like a\r\ncat with its back set up. _See_ BACK and MONKEY.\r\n\r\n~Humpty-dumpty~, short and thick; all of a heap; all together, like an\r\negg.\r\n\r\n    “HUMPTY-DUMPTY sat on a wall.”\r\n\r\nAlso a hunchback. HUMPTY is an abbreviated form of the expression.\r\n\r\n~Hunch~, to shove, or jostle.\r\n\r\n~Hunks~, a miserly fellow, a curmudgeon.\r\n\r\n~Hunky~, an American term which means good, jolly, &c. As, “a HUNKY\r\nboy,” a good jovial fellow; and “everything went off HUNKY.”\r\n\r\n~Hunter pitching~, the game of cockshies—three throws a penny.—_See_\r\nCOCKSHY.\r\n\r\n~Hurdy-gurdy~, a droning musical instrument shaped like a large fiddle,\r\nand turned by a crank, used by Savoyards and other itinerant foreign\r\nmusicians in England, now nearly superseded by the hand-organ. From the\r\npeculiar noise made by the instrument, which in Italy is called “viola.”\r\n\r\n~Hurkaru~, a messenger.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Husbands’ boat~, the Saturday afternoon packet to Margate during the\r\nsummer season. So called for obvious reasons. The passengers by this\r\nboat come in for an unusual share of attention from the cads peculiar to\r\nthis watering-place.\r\n\r\n~Husbands’ tea~, very weak tea. _See_ WATER BEWITCHED.\r\n\r\n~Hush-money~, a sum given to quash a prosecution or stay evidence. Money\r\ngiven to any one for the purpose of quieting him.\r\n\r\n~Hush-shop~, or CRIB, a shop where beer and spirits are sold “on the\r\nquiet”—no licence being paid.\r\n\r\n~Huxter~, money. Term much in use among costermongers and low sharpers.\r\nProbably from OXTER or HOXTER.\r\n\r\n~Hyps~, or HYPO, the blue devils. From HYPOCHONDRIASIS.—_Swift._\r\n\r\n~Hy-yaw!~ an interjectional exclamation of\r\nastonishment.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Ikey~, a Jew “fence.” Corruption of Isaac, a common Hebrew name.\r\n\r\n~Imperence~, servant-girl currency for impudence or impertinence. “Now,\r\nthen, Mr. IMPERENCE, leave off now, do,” seems, however, to have faded\r\naway with Greenwich, Bartlemy, and kindred fairs.\r\n\r\n~Improve the occasion~, a slang term much in use among Chadbands and\r\nStigginses, who never lose an opportunity of IMPROVING the condition of\r\neither pockets or stomachs at the expense of the credulous.\r\n\r\n~In~, “to be IN with a person,” to be even with, or up to him; also, to\r\nbe on intimate terms, or in partnership, with him.\r\n\r\n~Inexpressibles~, UNUTTERABLES, UNMENTIONABLES, UNWHISPERABLES, or SIT\r\nUPONS, trousers, the nether garments. All affected terms, having their\r\norigin in a most unpleasant squeamishness.\r\n\r\n~Infantry~, nursery term for children; LIGHT INFANTRY, fleas.\r\n\r\n~In for it~, in trouble or difficulty of any kind. As, “You’re IN FOR\r\nIT, I wouldn’t stand in your shoes for a trifle.”\r\n\r\n~In for patter~, waiting for trial, referring to the speeches of\r\ncounsel, the statements of witnesses, the summing up of the judge,\r\n&c.,—the fuss of which the prisoner sets down as “all so much PATTER.”\r\n\r\n~Innings~, earnings, good fortune; “he’s had a long INNINGS,” _i.e._, a\r\ngood run of luck, with plenty of cash flowing in. From the distinction\r\nbetween INNINGS and outings at cricket and kindred games.\r\n\r\n~Inside lining~, dinner, &c.\r\n\r\n~Interesting~, “to be in an INTERESTING situation,” applied to females\r\nwhen _enceinte_.\r\n\r\n~Interview~, to inspect privately with a view to obtaining information\r\nwhich shall be afterwards published. Both the verb and its use have\r\ntheir origin with our Transatlantic cousins, and “interviewing” by means\r\nof special reporters, who question most minutely, is of frequent\r\noccurrence,—of occurrence whenever opportunity offers. Should a man be\r\nfound guilty of murder, or start as a candidate for the Presidency, he\r\nwill be INTERVIEWED by “our special correspondent,” and there are\r\nalready signs of this objectionable form of newspaper work finding its\r\nway here. Should a visitor of importance arrive in New York, the\r\nconversation which passes, or is supposed to pass, between him and the\r\nreporter will be found minutely described, with an elaborate\r\nintroduction. It is but fair to Americans, however, to say that the\r\ngentleman to whom the credit, or discredit, of the invention of this\r\nsystem belongs was a native of Great Britain, who invented many other\r\nstartling Americanisms during his residence in New York.\r\n\r\n~Into~, “hold my hat, Jim, I’ll be INTO him,” _i.e._, I will fight him.\r\nIn this sense equivalent to pitch INTO, or slip INTO.\r\n\r\n~Invite~, an invitation—a corruption used by stuck-up people of\r\nmushroom origin. Often used, also, by people who know better, from their\r\ndesire for slang of any kind.\r\n\r\n~Ipsal dixal~, Cockney corruption of _ipse dixit_—said of one’s simple\r\nuncorroborated assertion.\r\n\r\n~Irish American~, an Irishman who has been for some time resident in the\r\nStates; sometimes a man born in America of Irish parents. The Irish\r\nAmerican body is a power in the United States, and is the fount-spring\r\nas well as the maintaining power of all Fenianism.\r\n\r\n~Irish apricots~, potatoes.\r\n\r\n~Irish Cockney~, a child born of Irish parents in any part of the\r\nsouthern counties of England. It is a singular fact that Irishmen born\r\nprofess great abhorrence of IRISH COCKNEYS, while the latter despise all\r\nIrish, and use the word as one of reproach. IRISH COCKNEYS were\r\noriginally only Cockneys born of an Irish strain, but the term has\r\nproved very elastic, and threatens soon to mean any English-born person\r\nwhose descent is Hibernian. Liverpool will, however, always prove an\r\nexception to the rule, as the name “Liverpool Irishmen” is given to\r\nthose who would in any southern part be called Cockneys.\r\n\r\n~Irish theatre~, the temporary prison, guard-room, or lock-up in a\r\nbarracks. The fond fancy of the soldier supplies it with other\r\nfigurative appellations, as “the mill,” “the jigger,” “the house that\r\nJack built.” In Edinburgh Castle it is termed “the dryroom.”\r\n\r\n~Irons in the fire~, a man is said to have too many IRONS IN THE FIRE\r\nwhen he turns his attention to too many occupations or enterprises at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n~Isthmus of Suez~, the covered bridge at St. John’s College, Cambridge,\r\nwhich connects the college with its grounds on the other side of the\r\nriver.—_See_ CRACKLE.\r\n\r\n~Ivories~, teeth; “a box of IVORIES,” a set of teeth, the mouth; “wash\r\nyour IVORIES,” _i.e._, “drink.” The word is also used to denote dice.\r\n\r\n~Jabber~, to talk, or chatter. A cant word in Swift’s time. Probably\r\nfrom GIBBER.\r\n\r\n~Jack~, the knave of trumps, at the game of all-fours.\r\n\r\n~Jack-at-a-pinch~, one whose assistance is only sought on an emergency.\r\nJack-in-the-water, an attendant at the watermen’s stairs on the river\r\nand sea-port towns, who does not mind wetting his feet for a customer’s\r\nconvenience, in consideration of a douceur.\r\n\r\n~Jacked-up~, ruined, done for. To JACK-UP is to leave off doing anything\r\nsuddenly. _See_ CHUCK-UP.\r\n\r\n~Jacket~, the skin of a potato which has not been pared before cooking.\r\nIn Ireland potatoes are generally served “with their JACKETS on.”\r\n\r\n~Jacketing~, a thrashing. Similar term to leathering, cowhiding, &c.\r\n\r\n~Jackey~, gin. _Seven Dials_ originally. Nearly general now.\r\n\r\n~Jack-in-the-box~, a small but powerful kind of screw, used by burglars\r\nto break open safes.\r\n\r\n~Jack Ketch~, the public hangman.—_See_ KETCH.\r\n\r\n~Jack Nasty-face~, a sailor.—_Sea._ NASTY-FACE is a term applied often\r\nin London streets to an ugly or unpleasant-looking person.\r\n\r\n~Jacks~, AND HALF-JACKS, card counters, resembling in size and\r\nappearance sovereigns and half-sovereigns, for which they are\r\noccasionally passed to simple persons. In large gambling establishments\r\nthe “heaps of gold” are frequently composed of JACKS. JACKS are not, as\r\nthey are sometimes supposed to be, counterfeit coins; they are simply\r\nlittle medals, and so “magsmen” and “street muggers” carry them with\r\nless concern than they would feel were their pockets loaded with\r\nspurious money.\r\n\r\n~Jack Sprat~, a diminutive boy or man.\r\n\r\n~Jack Tar~, a sailor.\r\n\r\n~Jacob~, a ladder. Grose says, from Jacob’s dream.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Jacob’s ladder~, a longitudinal flaw in the leg of a ballet-girl’s\r\ntights.\r\n\r\n~Jagger~, a gentleman. _German_, JAGER, a sportsman.\r\n\r\n~Jail-bird~, a prisoner, one who has been in jail.\r\n\r\n~James~, a sovereign, or twenty shillings. From JACOBUS, the James II.\r\nguinea.\r\n\r\n~Jannock~, sociable, fair dealing.—_Norfolk._ Generally now JONNICK,\r\nwhich _see_.\r\n\r\n~Japan~, to ordain. Having evident reference to the black clothes which\r\nfollow ordination.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Jark~, a “safe-conduct” pass.—_Oxford._ Old cant for a seal.\r\n\r\n~Jarvey~, the driver of a hackney-coach; “JARVEY’S upper Benjamin,” a\r\ncoachman’s overcoat, with many capes. An ingenious etymology has been\r\nfound for JARVEY, thus:—JARVEY, vernacular for Geoffrey, which was\r\noften written Geo. (gee-ho), hence JARVEY. This is open to considerable\r\nobjection, as George is shortened in similar manner to that shown above.\r\nStill it is worthy of record, independently of its ingenuity, being as\r\nexact as many accepted derivations.\r\n\r\n~Jaw~, speech, or talk; “hold your JAW,” don’t speak any more; “what are\r\nyou JAWING about?” _i.e._, what are you making a noise about?\r\n\r\n~Jaw~, to talk without cessation, to scold vehemently.\r\n\r\n~Jawbone~, credit.\r\n\r\n    “We have a few persons whose pockets are to let—men who have more\r\n    complaints than dollars—individuals who, in digger’s parlance, live\r\n    on JAWBONE (credit), and are always to be found at saloons; a class\r\n    of men who, when they are here, wish themselves yonder, and when\r\n    yonder, wish themselves back.”—_Times Correspondent, San Francisco,\r\n    Oct. 21, 1862._\r\n\r\n~Jaw-breaker~, a hard or excessively long word. Also, in pugilistic\r\nsense, a hard blow on the side of the face.\r\n\r\n~Jaw-twister~, a hard or many-syllabled word. Elaboration of preceding.\r\n\r\n~Jazey~, a wig. A corruption of JERSEY, the name for flax prepared in a\r\npeculiar manner, of which common wigs were formerly made; “the cove with\r\nthe JAZEY,” _i.e._, the judge.\r\n\r\n~Jeames~ (a generic for “flunkeys”), the _Morning Post_ newspaper—the\r\norgan of Belgravia and the “Haristocracy.”\r\n\r\n~Jehu~, old slang term for a coachman, or one fond of\r\ndriving.—_Biblical._\r\n\r\n~Jeminy O!~ a vulgar expression of surprise.\r\n\r\n~Jemmy~, a sheep’s-head.—_See_ SANGUINARY JAMES.\r\n\r\n~Jemmy~, a short crowbar, which generally takes to pieces, for the\r\nconvenience of housebreakers.\r\n\r\n~Jemmy ducks~, the man whose business it is to look after the poultry on\r\nboard a ship.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Jemmy Jessamy~, a dandy.\r\n\r\n~Jemmy-John~, a jar for holding liquor; probably a corruption of\r\ndemi-gallon, by means of DEMI-JOHN.\r\n\r\n~Jeremiad~, a lament; derived, of course, from the Book of Lamentations,\r\nwritten by the Prophet Jeremiah.\r\n\r\n~Jeremy Diddler~, an adept at raising the wind, _i.e._, at borrowing,\r\nespecially at borrowing with no intention of repaying. _See_ the farce\r\nof _Raising the Wind_.\r\n\r\n~Jericho~, an improper quarter of Oxford. A lady visitor once writing\r\nher name down in the visitors’ book at the Bodleian or elsewhere, for a\r\njoke put down her residence as “Jericho,” to the no small disgust of her\r\nundergraduate friend.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Jerry~, a chamber utensil; abbreviation of JEROBOAM.—_Swift._\r\n\r\n~Jerry~, a watch. “JERRY nicking” or “JERRY sneaking” is watch-stealing,\r\nwhich is a distinct form of street robbery, and requires both courage\r\nand dexterity; for it is done, as the thieves say, “right afore a\r\nbloke’s face.”\r\n\r\n~Jerry~, to jibe or chaff cruelly. Development of jeer.\r\n\r\n~Jerry-go-nimble~, the diarrhœa. Derivation apparent.\r\n\r\n~Jerry Lynch~, a pig’s head pickled. Term usually applied to the long\r\nIrish heads which are sent over here for sale in the poorer districts of\r\nLondon, and which are vastly different from the heads of “dairy-fed”\r\nporkers.\r\n\r\n~Jerry shop~, a beer-house. Contraction of “Tom and Jerry.”\r\n\r\n~Jerry Sneak~, a hen-pecked husband,—a character in the _Mayor of\r\nGarret_. Also, a stealer of watches.\r\n\r\n~Jerusalem pony~, a donkey.\r\n\r\n~Jessie~, “to give a person JESSIE,” to beat him soundly. _See_ GAS.\r\n\r\n~Jew fencer~, a Jew street salesman.\r\n\r\n~Jew’s eye~, a popular simile for anything valuable. Probably a\r\ncorruption of the _Italian_, GIOJE; _French_, JOAILLE, a jewel. In\r\nancient times, when a king was short of cash, he generally issued orders\r\nfor so many JEWS’ EYES, or equivalent sums of money. The Jews preferred\r\npaying the ransom, although often very heavy. It is notorious that in\r\nthis country the order often went forth to draw Jews’ teeth in the\r\nevent of their refusing to contribute so much to the Exchequer. A\r\nprobable idea is, that as a Jew’s teeth brought in so much money, the\r\nvalue of a JEW’S EYE must be something fabulous. Possibly, also, from\r\nthe _lex talionis_ so strongly believed in by Jews,—an eye for an eye,\r\nand nothing less. The term is used by Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n~Jezebel~, a showily-dressed woman of suspected character; derived, of\r\ncourse, from 2 Kings ix. 30, but applied in this sense from the time of\r\nthe Puritans. Also, a hot-tempered female.\r\n\r\n~Jib~, a first-year man.—_Dublin University._\r\n\r\n~Jib~, or JIBBER, a horse that starts or shrinks. Shakspeare uses it in\r\nthe sense of a worn-out horse.\r\n\r\n~Jib~, the face, or a person’s expression; “the cut of his JIB,” _i.e._,\r\nhis peculiar appearance. That sail of a ship, which in position and\r\nshape, corresponds to the nose on a person’s face.—_Sea._ A vessel is\r\noften known by the cut of the JIB sail; hence the popular phrase, “to\r\nknow a man by the cut of his JIB.”\r\n\r\n~Jibb~, the tongue.—_Gipsy_ and _Hindoo_. (Tramps’ term.) Thence\r\nextended to mean language.\r\n\r\n~Jiffy~, “in a JIFFY,” in a moment.\r\n\r\n~Jigger~, a door; “dub the JIGGER,” shut the door. _Ancient cant_,\r\nGYGER. In billiards, the bridge or rest is often termed the JIGGER.\r\nAlso, the curtain of a theatre. JIGGER has many meanings, the word being\r\napplied to any small mechanical contrivance. Printers use the word for a\r\nlittle machine which guides the eye when copy is minute.\r\n\r\n~Jigger~, a secret still for the manufacture of illicit spirits.\r\n\r\n~Jigger~, “I’m JIGGERED if you will,” a common form of mild swearing.\r\n_See_ SNIGGER.\r\n\r\n~Jigger-dubber~, a term applied to a gaoler or turnkey.\r\n\r\n~Jiggot o’ mutton~, a leg of mutton. From _Fr._ GIGOT.\r\n\r\n~Jilt~, a crowbar or house-breaking implement.\r\n\r\n~Jingo~, “by JINGO,” a common form of oath, said to be a corruption of\r\nST. GINGOULPH. _Vide_ Halliwell.\r\n\r\n~Jo~, Scotticism for a man or lover. As “John Anderson, my JO, John.”\r\n\r\n~Job~, “a JOB lot,” otherwise called a “sporting lot,” any miscellaneous\r\ngoods purchased at a cheap rate, or to be sold a bargain. Frequently\r\nused to conceal the fact of their being stolen, or otherwise dishonestly\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n~Job~, a short piece of work, a prospect of employment. Johnson\r\ndescribes JOB as a low word, without etymology. It is, and was, however,\r\na cant word; and a JOB, two centuries ago, was an arranged robbery. Even\r\nat the present day it is mainly confined to the streets, in the sense of\r\nemployment for a short time. Amongst undertakers a JOB signifies a\r\nfuneral; “to do a JOB,” conduct any one’s funeral; “by the JOB,” _i.e._,\r\npiece-work, as opposed to time-work. A JOB in political phraseology is a\r\nGovernment office or contract, obtained by secret influence or\r\nfavouritism. Any unfair arrangement is now called a JOB.\r\n\r\n~Job~, a sudden blow, as “a JOB in the eye.” Also used as a verb, “I’ll\r\nJOB this here knife in your ribs.”\r\n\r\n~Jobation~, a chiding, a reprimand, a trial of the hearer’s patience.\r\n\r\n~Jobbery~, the arrangement of jobs, or unfair business proceedings.\r\n\r\n~Job’s comfort~, reproof instead of consolation.\r\n\r\n~Job’s comforter~, one who brings news of additional misfortunes. Both\r\nthese words are of Biblical origin.\r\n\r\n~Job’s turkey~, “as poor as JOB’S TURKEY,” as thin and as badly fed as\r\nthat ill-conditioned and imaginary bird.\r\n\r\n~Jocteleg~, a shut-up knife. Corruption of Jacques de Liège, a famous\r\ncutler.\r\n\r\n~Joe~, a too marvellous tale, a lie, or a stale joke. Abbreviated from\r\nJOE MILLER. The full name is occasionally used, as in the phrase “I\r\ndon’t see the JOE MILLER of it,” _i.e._, I don’t perceive the wit you\r\nintend, or I don’t see the fun of doing it,—whatever may have been the\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n~Joey~, a fourpenny piece. The term is derived (like BOBBY from Sir\r\nRobert Peel) from Joseph Hume. The explanation is thus given in\r\nHawkins’s _History of the Silver Coinage of England_:—\r\n\r\n    “These pieces are said to have owed their existence to the pressing\r\n    instance of Mr. Hume, from whence they, for some time, bore the\r\n    nickname of JOEYS. As they were very convenient to pay short cab\r\n    fares, the hon. M.P. was extremely unpopular with the drivers, who\r\n    frequently received only a groat where otherwise they would have\r\n    received a sixpence without any demand for change.”\r\n\r\nThe term, therefore, was originated by the London cabmen, who have\r\ninvented many other popular phrases. Fancy offering a modern hansom\r\ncabman a JOEY!\r\n\r\n~Jog-trot~, a slow but regular trot, or pace.\r\n\r\n~Jogul~, to play up, at cards or other game. _Spanish_, JUGAR.\r\n\r\n~John Blunt~, a straightforward, honest, outspoken man.\r\n\r\n~Johnny~, half-a-glass of whisky.—_Irish._\r\n\r\n~Johnny Darbies~, a nickname for policemen, an evident corruption of the\r\n_French_ GENSDARMES. Also, a term applied to handcuffs.—_See_ DARBIES.\r\n\r\n~Johnny Raw~, a newly-enlisted soldier.\r\n\r\n~John Orderly~, the signal to shorten the performance at a show.\r\nWhenever the master, who remains on the platform outside to take the\r\nmoney and regulate the performance, desires to refill the booth, he\r\npokes his head inside and shouts, “Is JOHN ORDERLY there?” The actors\r\ninstantly cut the piece short, the curtain falls, and the spectators are\r\nbundled out at the back, to make room for the fresh audience. According\r\nto tradition, JOHN ORDERLY was a noted showman, who taught this move to\r\nthe no less noted Richardson. This is like the old story of the publican\r\nwho used to call out to his waiter, “A pot of ale, Robert,” when he\r\nwished his customers to be served with the best; but “A pot of ale,\r\nBob,” when they had been drinking long enough not to distinguish good\r\nstuff from the bad the latter order meant. One day after calling for Bob\r\nmany times, he reluctantly, at the request of a visitor, tasted the ale,\r\nand found it was the best. Rushing out immediately afterwards, and\r\ncalling for Bob with all his voice, he was answered by his wife, who\r\nsaid, “Why, Bob’s been out these three hours.”\r\n\r\n~John Thomas~, a generic for “flunkeys,”—more especially footmen with\r\nlarge calves and fine bushy whiskers.\r\n\r\n~Jolly~, a Royal Marine.—_See_ HORSE MARINE.\r\n\r\n~Jolly~, a word of praise, or favourable notice; “chuck Harry a JOLLY,\r\nBill,” _i.e._, go and praise up his goods, or buy of him, and speak well\r\nof the article, that the crowd standing around his stall may think it a\r\ngood opportunity for laying out their money. This is called JOLLYING.\r\n“Chuck a JOLLY,” lit. translated, is, throw “a shout” or “good word.”\r\n\r\n~Jolly~, to abuse or vituperate, sometimes to “bear up” or “bonnet.” To\r\nJOLLY a man often means to give him a piece of one’s mind. To JOLLY\r\n“for” any one is another phase of the business mentioned in the\r\nforegoing paragraph.\r\n\r\n~Jomer~, a sweetheart, or favourite girl. _See_ BLOWER.\r\n\r\n~Jonnick~, right, correct, proper. Said of a person or thing.\r\n\r\n~Jordan~, a chamberpot. To throw the contents of a chamberpot over any\r\none is to christen him.\r\n\r\n~Jorum~, a capacious vessel from which food is eaten, as broth or stew.\r\n\r\n~Joskin~, a countryman.\r\n\r\n~Jossop~, the syrup or juice in a fruit pie or pudding. Also, sauce or\r\ngravy.—_School._\r\n\r\n~Jow~, be off, be gone immediately. If the word Jehanum be added, it\r\nforms a peremptory order to go to a place unmentionable to ears\r\npolite.—_Anglo-Indian._ Our phrase, “Go to Jericho,” is probably a\r\nmodification of the Jehanum business.\r\n\r\n~Judas~, a deceitful person; JUDAS-HAIRED, red-haired, deceitful. It is\r\ngenerally believed that JUDAS ISCARIOT was red-haired. Painters seem to\r\nhave accepted this idea, with modifications as to the exact amount of\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n~Jug~, a prison of any kind. Contraction of “stone jug.”\r\n\r\n~Julep~, one of a set of drinks peculiar to America. Generally prepared\r\nwith mint, and called a MINT-JULEP. Originally JULEP was a pleasant\r\nliquid, in which nauseous medicines were taken. Its literal meaning is\r\nrosewater, and it is derived from the Arabic.\r\n\r\n~Jump~, to seize, or rob; to “JUMP a man,” to pounce upon him, and\r\neither rob or maltreat him; “to JUMP a house,” to rob it.\r\n\r\n~Jumped-up~, conceited, arrogant, setting full value on oneself.\r\n\r\n~Jump-up-behind~, to endorse an accommodation-bill.\r\n\r\n~Juniper~, gin. Derivation obvious.\r\n\r\n~Junk~, salt beef.—_See_ OLD HORSE.\r\n\r\n~Juwaub~, literally, in Hindostanee, an answer; but in Anglo-Indian\r\nslang signifying a refusal. If an officer asks for leave and is refused,\r\nhe is said to be JUWAUBED; if a gentleman unsuccessfully proposes for\r\nthe hand of a lady, he is said to have got the JUWAUB.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Karibat~, food, literally rice and curry; the staple dish of both\r\nnatives and Europeans in India.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Keel-hauling~, a good thrashing or mauling, rough treatment,—from the\r\nold nautical custom of punishing offenders by throwing them overboard\r\nwith a rope attached, and hauling them up from under the ship’s keel.\r\nSee full description of this barbarous practice in Marryat’s\r\n_Snarleyyow_.\r\n\r\n~Keep a pig~, an Oxford University phrase, which means to have a lodger.\r\nA man whose rooms contain two bedchambers has sometimes, when his\r\ncollege is full, to allow the use of one of them to a Freshman, who is\r\ncalled under these circumstances a PIG. The original occupier is then\r\nsaid to KEEP A PIG.\r\n\r\n~Keep it up~, to prolong a debauch, or the occasion of a rejoicing,—a\r\nmetaphor drawn from the game of shuttlecock. People suffering from the\r\neffects of drink are said to have been KEEPING IT UP.—_Grose._\r\n\r\n~Kelter~, coin, money. Probably from GELT.\r\n\r\n~Ken~, a house.—_Ancient cant._ KHAN, _Gipsy_ and _Oriental_.\r\n\r\n⁂ All slang and cant words which end in KEN, such as SPIELKEN, SPINIKEN,\r\nor BOOZINGKEN, refer to houses, and are mainly of Gipsy origin.\r\n\r\n~Kennedy~, a poker; to “give KENNEDY” is to strike or kill with a poker.\r\nA St. Giles’s term, so given from a man of that name being killed by a\r\npoker.\r\n\r\n~Kent rag~, or CLOUT, a cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\n~Kervorten~, a Cockneyism for QUARTERN or quarter-pint measure.\r\n“KERVORTEN and three houts,” a quartern of liquor and glasses, each\r\nholding a third of the quantity.\r\n\r\n~Ketch~, or JACK KETCH, the popular name for a public hangman; derived\r\nfrom a person of that name who officiated in the reign of Charles\r\nII.—_See Macaulay’s History of England._\r\n\r\n~Kettle of fish~, a mess or muddle of any kind. As, “Here’s a pretty\r\nKETTLE OF FISH!”\r\n\r\n~Key of the street~, an imaginary instrument said to be possessed by any\r\none locked out of doors.\r\n\r\n~Kibosh~, nonsense, stuff, humbug; “it’s all KIBOSH,” _i.e._, palaver or\r\nnonsense; to “put on the KIBOSH,” to run down, slander, degrade, &c. To\r\nput the KIBOSH on anything is, latterly, to put an effectual end or stop\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n~Kick~, a moment; “I’ll be there in a KICK,” _i.e._, in a moment.\r\n\r\n~Kick~, a pocket; _Gaelic_, CUACH, a bowl, a nest; _Scotch_, QUAIGH.\r\n\r\n~Kick~, a sixpence; “two and a KICK,” two shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\n~Kick the bucket~, to die.—_Norfolk._ According to Forby, a metaphor\r\ntaken from the descent of a well or mine, which is of course absurd. The\r\nRev. E. S. Taylor supplies the following note from his MS. additions to\r\nthe work of the East-Anglian lexicographer:—\r\n\r\n    “The allusion is to the way in which a slaughtered pig is hung\r\n    up—viz., by passing the ends of a bent piece of wood behind the\r\n    tendons of the hind legs, and so suspending it to a hook in a beam\r\n    above. This piece of wood is locally termed a BUCKET, and so by a\r\n    coarse metaphor the phrase came to signify to die.”\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent says the real signification of this phrase is to\r\ncommit suicide by hanging, from a method planned and carried out by an\r\nostler at an inn on the Great North Road. Standing on a bucket, he tied\r\nhimself up to a beam in the stable; he then KICKED THE BUCKET away from\r\nunder his feet, and in a few seconds was dead. The natives of the West\r\nIndies have converted the expression into “kickeraboo.”\r\n\r\n~Kick over the traces~, to be over-extravagant. Any one who has come to\r\ngrief by fast living is said to have KICKED OVER THE TRACES.\r\n\r\n~Kick up~, a noise or disturbance.\r\n\r\n~Kick up~, “to KICK UP a row,” to create a tumult.\r\n\r\n~Kickeraboo~, dead. A West Indian negro’s phrase. _See_ KICK THE BUCKET,\r\nof which phrase it is a corruption.\r\n\r\n~Kickseys~, or KICKSIES, trousers.\r\n\r\n~Kickshaws~, trifles; made, or French dishes—not English or\r\nsubstantial. Anything of a fancy description now. Corruption of the\r\n_French_ QUELQUES CHOSES.\r\n\r\n~Kicksy~, troublesome, disagreeable. _German_, KECK, bold.\r\n\r\n~Kid~, an infant, or child. From the German _kind_; or possibly from the\r\nname for the young of a goat. Also, a shallow dish in which sailors\r\nreceive their portions of food.\r\n\r\n~Kid~, to joke, to quiz, to hoax anybody. “No KID, now?” is a question\r\noften asked by a man who thinks he is being hoaxed.\r\n\r\n~Kidden~, or KIDKEN, a low lodging-house for boys.\r\n\r\n~Kiddier~, a pork-butcher.\r\n\r\n~Kiddily~, fashionably or showily; “KIDDILY togg’d,” showily dressed.\r\n\r\n~Kiddleywink~, a small shop where are retailed the commodities of a\r\nvillage store. Originally KIDDLE-A-WINK, from the offer made, with a\r\nwink, to give you something out of the kettle or kiddle. In the west\r\ncountry an alehouse. Also, a woman of unsteady habits.\r\n\r\n~Kiddy~, a man, or boy. Formerly a low thief.\r\n\r\n~Kiddyish~, frolicsome, jovial.\r\n\r\n    “Think, on the KIDDYISH spree we had on such a day.”\r\n\r\n        _Randall’s Diary, 1820._\r\n\r\n~Kidment~, humbug, coarse chaff or jocularity.\r\n\r\n~Kidnapper~, originally one who stole children. Now applied without\r\nreference to the age or sex of those stolen. From “kid,” a child, and\r\n“nab” (corrupted to “nap”), to steal, or seize.\r\n\r\n~Kidney~, “of that KIDNEY,” of such a stamp; “strange KIDNEY,” odd\r\nhumour; “two of a KIDNEY,” two persons of a sort, or as like as two\r\npeas, _i.e._, resembling each other like two kidneys in a bunch.—_Old._\r\n“Attempt to put their hair out of KIDNEY.”—_Terræ Filius_, 1763.\r\n\r\n~Kid-on~, to entice or incite a person to the perpetration of an act.\r\n\r\n~Kidsman~, one who trains boys to thieve and pick pockets successfully.\r\n\r\n~Kilkenny cat~, a popular simile for a voracious or desperate animal or\r\nperson, from the story of the two cats in that county, who are said to\r\nhave fought and bitten each other until a small portion of the tail of\r\none of them alone remained.\r\n\r\n~Killing~, bewitching, fascinating. The term is akin to the phrase\r\n“dressing to death.”\r\n\r\n~Kilt~, an Irishism for badly beaten, but by no means equivalent with\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n~Kimbo~, or A-KIMBO, holding the arms in a bent position from the body,\r\nand resting the hands upon the hips, in a bullying attitude. Said to be\r\nfrom A SCHIMBO, bandy-legged, crooked, _Italian_; but more probably from\r\nKIMBAW, the old cant for beating or bullying. _See Grose._ _Celtic_,\r\nCAM, crooked.\r\n\r\n~Kimmer~, a gossip, an acquaintance, same as CUMMER.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n    “What’s a’ the steer, KIMMER?”\r\n\r\n~Kinchin~, a child.—_Old Cant._ From the _German_ diminutive, KINDCHEN,\r\na baby.\r\n\r\n~Kinchin cove~, a man who robs children; a little man.—Ancient Cant.\r\n\r\n~Kincob~, uniform, fine clothes, richly embroidered dresses. Really,\r\ncloth of gold or silver.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Kingsman~, a handkerchief with yellow patterns upon a green ground, the\r\nfavourite coloured neckerchief of the costermongers. The women sometimes\r\nwear KINGSMAN kerchiefs thrown over their shoulders. A coster will often\r\nimagine his caste, or position, is at stake, if his KINGSMAN is not of\r\nthe most approved pattern. When he fights, his KINGSMAN is tied around\r\nhis waist as a belt. This partiality for a peculiar-coloured neckcloth\r\nis part of the fondness for gaudy colours which at all times and in all\r\ncountries has been shown by the uncultivated. A strange similarity of\r\ntaste for certain colours exists amongst the Hindoos, Gipsies, and\r\nLondon lower classes. Red and yellow (or orange) are the great\r\nfavourites, and in these hues the Hindoo selects his turban and his\r\nrobe; the gipsy his breeches, and his wife her shawl or gown; and the\r\ncostermonger, his plush waistcoat and favourite KINGSMAN. Among either\r\nclass, when a fight takes place, the greatest regard is paid to the\r\nfavourite coloured article of dress. The Hindoo lays aside his turban,\r\nthe gipsy folds up his fancy breeches or coat, whilst the pugilistic\r\ncostermonger of Covent Garden or Billingsgate removes his favourite\r\nneckerchief to a part of his body, by the rules of the “ring,”\r\ncomparatively out of danger.\r\n\r\n~King’s pictures~ (now, of course, QUEEN’S PICTURES), money.\r\n\r\n~Kisky~, drunk, fuddled.\r\n\r\n~Kiss-curl~, a small curl twisted on the temple. _See_ BOWCATCHER.\r\n\r\n~Kisser~, the mouth.—_Pugilistic term._\r\n\r\n~Kissing-crust~, the soft crust which marks where one loaf has been\r\nbroken from another.\r\n\r\n~Kiss-me-quick~, the name given to the very small bonnets which have of\r\nlate years become fashionable.\r\n\r\n~Kit~, a person’s baggage. Also, a collection of anything, “the whole\r\nKIT of ’em,” the entire lot. _Anglo-Saxon_, KYTH.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Kite~,—_see_ FLY THE KITE.\r\n\r\n~Kitmegur~, an under-butler, a footman.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Kitna~, how much?—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Knacker~, an old horse; a horse-slaughterer. Originally\r\n_Gloucestershire_, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Knap~, _i.q._, NAP, to break.—_Old English_, but nearly obsolete. _See\r\nPs_. xlvi. 9 (Prayer-book version), “He breaketh the bow, and KNAPPETH\r\nthe spear in sunder;” probably sibilated into “snap.”\r\n\r\n~Knap~, to receive, to take. Generally applied to the receipt of\r\npunishments; “oh, my! wont he just KNAP it when he gets home!”\r\n\r\n~Knap~, to steal.—_Prison Cant._\r\n\r\n~Knapping-jigger~, a turnpike gate; “to dub at the KNAPPING-JIGGER,” to\r\npay money at the turnpike.\r\n\r\n~Knark~, a hard-hearted or savage person. The word is now usually spelt\r\nNARK, and is applied to the lowest class of informers.\r\n\r\n~Knife~, “to KNIFE a person,” to stab; an un-English custom, but a very\r\ncommon expression.\r\n\r\n~Knife-board~, the seat running along the roof of an omnibus.\r\n\r\n            “On ’busses’ KNIFEBOARDS stretch’d,\r\n    The City clerks all tongue-protruded lay.”\r\n\r\n        _A Summer Idyll, by Arthur Smith._\r\n\r\n~Knife it~, “cut it,” cease, stop, don’t proceed.\r\n\r\n~Knight~, a common and ironical prefix to a man’s calling—thus, “KNIGHT\r\nof the whip,” a coachman; “KNIGHT of the thimble,” a tailor.\r\n\r\n~Knobstick~, a non-society workman. One who takes work under price.\r\n\r\n~Knock about the bub~, to hand or pass about the drink. BUB is a very\r\nold cant term for drink.\r\n\r\n~Knock-down~, or KNOCK-ME-DOWN, strong ale.\r\n\r\n~Knocked-up~, tired, jaded, used up, done for. In the United States,\r\namongst females, the phrase is equivalent to being _enceinte_, so that\r\nEnglishmen often unconsciously commit themselves when amongst our Yankee\r\ncousins.\r\n\r\n~Knock-’em-downs~, the game of skittles.\r\n\r\n~Knocker~, “up to the KNOCKER,” means finely or showily dressed, in the\r\nheight of fashion; proficient, equal to the task.\r\n\r\n~Knocker-face~, an ugly face, _i.e._, like an old-fashioned\r\ndoor-knocker.\r\n\r\n~Knock-in~, the game of loo.\r\n\r\n~Knocking-in~, coming into college after time. A habit of KNOCKING-IN\r\nlate generally leads to some unpleasantness.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Knocking-out.~ All visitors, on leaving a college after time, have to\r\nstate in whose rooms they have been, that his gate-bill may be scored up\r\nfor them. When a rackety party takes place, the visitors, or “out\r\ncollege men,” are generally supplied with a list of the names of the\r\nquietest men in college, so that the whereabouts of the party may not be\r\nbetrayed.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Knock-it-down~, to show, in the “free and easy” style, approval of a\r\nsong or toast, by hammering with pot or glass on the table.\r\n\r\n~Knock off~, to give over, or abandon. A saying used by workmen in\r\nreference to dinner or other meal times, for upwards of two centuries.\r\n\r\n~Knock out~, in racing parlance, to drive out of the quotations; as a\r\nKNOCKED-OUT favourite. Also to make bankrupt; as a KNOCKED-OUT backer or\r\nbookmaker. When a man cannot meet his engagements on the turf, he is\r\nsaid to be KNOCKED OUT.\r\n\r\n~Knock-outs~, or KNOCK-INS, disreputable persons who visit auction rooms\r\nand unite to purchase the articles at their own prices. One of their\r\nnumber is instructed to buy for the rest, and after a few small bids as\r\nblinds to the auctioneer and bystanders, the lot is knocked down to the\r\nKNOCK-OUT bidders, at a nominal price—the competition to result from an\r\nauction being thus frustrated and set aside. At the conclusion of the\r\nsale the goods are paid for, and carried to a neighbouring public-house,\r\nwhere they are re-sold or KNOCKED-OUT among the confederates, and the\r\ndifference between the first purchase and the second—or tap-room\r\nKNOCK-OUT—is divided amongst the gang. As generally happens with\r\nill-gotten gains, the money soon finds its way to the landlord’s pocket,\r\nand the KNOCK-OUT is rewarded with a red nose and a bloated face.\r\nCunning tradesmen join the KNOCK-OUTS when an opportunity for\r\nmoney-making presents itself. The lowest description of KNOCK-OUTS,\r\nfellows with more tongue than capital, are termed BABES. Within the past\r\nfew years a few respectable auctioneers, assisted much by one or two\r\njust and admirable magisterial decisions, have succeeded in considerably\r\nlimiting the efforts of the KNOCK-OUT fraternity.\r\n\r\n~Knock-under~, to submit.\r\n\r\n~Knowing~, sharp, shrewd, artful; “a KNOWING codger,” or “a KNOWING\r\nblade,” one who can take you in, or cheat you, in any transaction you\r\nmay have with him. It implies also deep cunning and foresight, and\r\ngenerally signifies dishonesty.\r\n\r\n    “Who, on a spree with black-eyed Sal, his blowen,\r\n    So swell, so prime, so nutty, and so KNOWING?”—_Don Juan._\r\n\r\nKNOW, in this sense, enters into several slang phrases. “I KNOW\r\nsomething,” expresses that I am not to be taken in by any shallow\r\ndevice. “He KNOWS a thing or two,” _i.e._, he is a cunning fellow.\r\n\r\n~Knowledge-box~, the head.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Knuckle~, to fight with fists, to pommel.\r\n\r\n~Knuckle-duster~, a large, heavy, or over-gaudy ring; a ring which\r\nattracts attention from its size.\r\n\r\n~Knuckle-duster~, an iron or brass instrument which covers the knuckles\r\nso as to protect them from injury when striking a blow, adding force to\r\nit at the same time. Sometimes a KNUCKLE-DUSTER has knobs or points\r\nprojecting, so as to mutilate and disfigure the person struck. This\r\nbrutal invention is American, but has been made familiar here.\r\n\r\n~Knuckle to~, or KNUCKLE UNDER, to yield or submit.\r\n\r\n~Knuller~, old term for a chimney-sweep, who solicited jobs by ringing a\r\nbell. From the _Saxon_, CNYLLAN, to knell, or sound a bell. _See_\r\nQUERIER.\r\n\r\n~Kootee~, a house.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Kotoo~, to bow down before, to cringe, to flatter. From a Chinese\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\n~Kubber~, news.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Kudos~, praise; KUDIZED, praised. _Greek_, κύδος.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Kye~, eighteenpence.\r\n\r\n~Kypsey~, a basket. A term generally used by gipsies.\r\n\r\n~La!~ a euphuistic rendering of LORD! common amongst females and very\r\nprecise persons; imagined by many to be a corruption of LOOK! but this\r\nis a mistake. Sometimes pronounced LAW, or LAWKS.\r\n\r\n~Lac~, one hundred thousand.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Laced~, strengthened with ardent spirits. Tea or coffee in which brandy\r\nis poured is said to be LACED.\r\n\r\n~Lacing~, a beating. From the phrase, “I’ll lace your\r\njacket.”—_L’Estrange._ Perhaps to give a beating with a lace or lash.\r\nPerhaps, also, a figurative phrase for ornamenting the article in\r\nquestion with stripes.\r\n\r\n~Ladder~, “can’t see a hole in a LADDER,” said of any one who is\r\nintoxicated. It was once said that a man was never properly drunk until\r\nhe could not lie down without holding, could not see a hole through a\r\nLADDER, or went to the pump to light his pipe.\r\n\r\n~Ladies’ mile~, that part of Hyde Park where the feminine beauty, rank,\r\nand fashion most do congregate during the airing hours of the London\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n~Lag~, a returned transport, or ticket-of-leave convict.\r\n\r\n~Lag~, to void urine.—_Ancient Cant._ In modern slang to transport, as\r\nregards bearing witness, and not in reference to the action of judge or\r\njury.\r\n\r\n~Lagged~, imprisoned, apprehended, or transported for a crime. From the\r\nOld Norse, LAGDA, “laid,”—laid by the leg.\r\n\r\n~Lagger~, a sailor. Also, one who gives evidence; an informer.\r\n\r\n~Lagging gage~, a chamber-pot.—_Ancient Cant._\r\n\r\n~Lambasting~, a beating. Perhaps LUMB-BASTING, from the lumbar-regions.\r\n\r\n~Lamb’s wool~, spiced ale, of which the butler at Brasenose every Shrove\r\nTuesday supplies as much as is required at Hall, with a copy of verses\r\non the subject, generally written by a Brasenose man. One of these poems\r\nbegan:—\r\n\r\n    Antiquum et vetus est {Ale Æn Nas} dicere laudes.\r\n                          {alienas   }\r\n\r\n        _Oxford University._\r\n\r\nLAMB’S WOOL is also a hot drink, well known to the community for\r\ncenturies. Supposed by some to be derived from Lammas, at which time it\r\nwas drunk, and by others to be derived from the similarity between the\r\nfoam of the drink and the white wool obtained from lambs.\r\n\r\n~Lame duck~, a stockjobber who speculates beyond his capital, and cannot\r\npay his losses. Upon retiring from the Exchange he is said to “waddle\r\nout of the Alley.”\r\n\r\n~Lamming~, a beating.—_Old English_, LAM; used by Beaumont and\r\nFletcher.

LAP is the term invariably used in the ballet\r\ngirls’ dressing-room for gin.\r\n\r\n~Lap~, one circuit of a pedestrian enclosure. In running a race of any\r\ndistance one man is said to LAP another when he is one entire circuit in\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n~Lap.~ LAP THE GUTTER, to get beastly and helplessly drunk. LAP means to\r\ndrink. LAP THE GATTER, to drink up the beer; a “rare LAPPER,” a hard\r\ndrinker.\r\n\r\n~Lark~, a frolic, a joke; “let’s have a jolly good LARK,” let us have a\r\npiece of fun.—_Anglo-Saxon_, LAC, sport; but more probably from the\r\nnautical term SKYLARKING, _i.e._, mounting to the highest yards and\r\nsliding down the ropes for amusement, which is allowed on certain\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n~Lark~, to sport boisterously, to show a disposition for “going on the\r\nspree.”\r\n\r\n~Larrence~, an imaginary being, supposed by the Scottish peasantry to\r\nhave power over indolent persons. Hence laziness is often called\r\nLARRENCE.\r\n\r\n~Larrup~, to beat or thrash.\r\n\r\n~Larruping~, a good beating or hiding.—_Irish._\r\n\r\n~Lashins~, large quantities; as, “LASHINS of whisky.” An Irishism in\r\ncommon use.\r\n\r\n~Latchpan~, the lower lip—properly a dripping-pan; “to hang one’s\r\nLATCHPAN,” to pout, be sulky.—_Norfolk._\r\n\r\n~Lavender~, “to be laid up in LAVENDER;” to be in pawn; to be out of the\r\nway for an especial purpose.

Also, used for giving any one a chance\r\nof succeeding in a difficult undertaking by allowing him so much grace\r\nor preliminary notice.\r\n\r\n~Lay~, a pursuit or practice, a dodge. Term in this sense much used by\r\nthieves.\r\n\r\n~Lay~, in wagering, to bet against a man or animal. Betters are divided\r\nin racing slang into layers and takers; they are otherwise known as\r\nbookmakers and backers.\r\n\r\n~Lay~, some, a piece. “Tip me a LAY of pannum,” _i.e._, give me a slice\r\nof bread.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Lay~, to watch; “on the LAY,” on the look-out.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Lay down the knife and fork~, to die. Compare PEGGING-OUT, HOPPING THE\r\nTWIG, and similar flippancies.\r\n\r\n~Lead~, or FRIENDLY LEAD, a gathering at a low public-house, for the\r\npurpose of assisting some one who is “in trouble” (in these cases\r\ntrouble always means imprisonment), who has just “come out of trouble,”\r\nor who is in want of a “mouthpiece.” A LEAD is different from a raffle,\r\ninasmuch as no article is put up or thrown for, but in the course of the\r\nevening some friend of the troubled one LEADS OFF by putting a certain\r\nsum in a plate, and the remainder of the party follow the LEAD with\r\nwhatever they can spare. Sometimes people pay as they enter the room,\r\nbut this does not alter the title or character of the meeting. In every\r\nother respect a LEAD is similar to a raffle; songs, dances, drinking,\r\nand a general desire to increase the bastardy averages being the most\r\nconspicuous features of the entertainment. Irish LEADS and raffles are\r\ncharacterized by less vice and more quarrelling than those of the lower\r\norders of English people.\r\n\r\n~Leary~, flash, knowing, artful, sly.\r\n\r\n~Leary bloke~, a clever or artful person.\r\n\r\n~Leather~, to beat or thrash. Probably from allusion to the skin, which\r\nis often called LEATHER. Some think the term is from the LEATHER belts\r\nworn by soldiers, which are often used as weapons in street rows. Most\r\nlikely from there being “nothing like LEATHER” with which to administer\r\na thrashing.\r\n\r\n~Leathern conveniency~, a carriage. A Quaker being reprimanded by the\r\nSociety of Friends for keeping a carriage, “contrary to the ancient\r\ntestimonies,” said, “it is not a carriage I keep, but merely a\r\nLEATHERN-CONVENIENCY.” _See_ under SIMON PURE, in the Introduction.\r\n\r\n~Leaving shop~, or DOLLY SHOP, an unlicensed house where goods are taken\r\ninto pawn at exorbitant rates of interest.\r\n\r\n~Led captain~, a fashionable spunger, a “swell” who by artifice\r\ningratiates himself into the favours of the master of the house, and\r\nlives at his table. Probably from the fact that a real captain leads,\r\nbut that a sham one is led—to the dinner-table.\r\n\r\n~Leer~, empty.—_Oxfordshire._ Pure _German_, as is nearly so the next\r\nword.\r\n\r\n~Leer~, print, newspaper. _German_, LEHREN, to instruct; hence _Old\r\nEnglish_, LERE, “spelt in the LEER.” _See_ SPELL.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Leg~, a part of a game. In some old games there are so many LEGS to the\r\nchalk, and so many chalks to the game. Sometimes the LEGS are called\r\nchalks, and the chalks LEGS—one word is as good as another, provided an\r\nagreement is made beforehand.\r\n\r\n~Leg~, or BLACKLEG, a disreputable sporting character and racecourse\r\n_habitué_; that is, one who is disreputable among sporting men.\r\n\r\n~Leg-and-leg~, the state of a game when each player has won a LEG. In\r\nIreland a LEG is termed a horse, LEG-AND-LEG being there termed\r\n“horse-and-horse.”\r\n\r\n~Leg bail~, the bail or security given by absence. To give LEG BAIL is\r\nto run away.\r\n\r\n~Leg it~, to run; “to give a LEG,” to assist, as when one mounts a\r\nhorse; “making a LEG,” a countryman’s bow,—projecting the LEG from\r\nbehind as a balance to the head bent forward.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Leg-of-mutton~, humorous street term for a sheep’s trotter, or foot.\r\n\r\n~Leg of mutton fist~, a large, muscular or bony hand.\r\n\r\n~Length~, forty-two lines of a dramatic composition.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Length~, six months’ imprisonment. _See_ STRETCH.\r\n\r\n~Let alone~, an expression which signifies “much less” as used in\r\ncomparative statement or argument. “I cannot afford five shillings, LET\r\nALONE five pounds.” Barham, in one of the Ingoldsby Legends, says:—\r\n\r\n    “I have not had, this livelong day, one drop to cheer my heart,\r\n    Nor brown to buy a bit of bread with—LET ALONE a tart.”\r\n\r\n~Let drive~, to strike at, or attack with vigour.\r\n\r\n~Let in~, to cheat or victimize. “He let me in heavily.”\r\n\r\n~Let on~, to give an intimation of having some knowledge of a subject.\r\nRamsay employs the phrase in the _Gentle Shepherd_.

It was formerly the\r\ncustom to give out to the creditors, when a person was in pecuniary\r\ndifficulties, and it was convenient for him to keep away, that he was\r\ngone to the East, or the LEVANT; hence, when one loses a bet, and\r\ndecamps without settling, he is said to LEVANT. The LEVANT was also a\r\nnotorious place for queer customers, who would do anything rather than\r\npay. Its reputation is not particularly odorous even now.\r\n\r\n~Levy~, a shilling.—_Liverpool._ Among labourers a LEVY is a sum\r\nobtained before it is due, something to keep a man going till\r\nSaturday-night comes, or his task is finished.\r\n\r\n~Liberty~, ground let in parts of Yorkshire for shooting purposes.\r\n\r\n~Lick~, a blow; LICKING, a beating; “to put in big LICKS,” a curious and\r\ncommon phrase, meaning that great exertions are being made.—_Dryden_;\r\n_North_.\r\n\r\n~Lick~, to excel, or overcome; “if you ain’t sharp, he’ll LICK you,”\r\n_i.e._, be finished first.

SHOPLIFTER is a recognised term. _Old Gothic_,\r\nLLIFAN, to steal; _Lower Rhenish_, LÖFTEN.\r\n\r\n~Lig~, a lie, a falsehood.—_Lancashire._ In old ballads the word “lie”\r\nis often spelt “LIG.” In old Saxon, LIG is to lie, but to lie as in a\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n~Light~, credit, trust; “to get a LIGHT at a house” is to get credit.\r\nWhen a man’s credit is stopped, his LIGHT is said to be put out.

Visitors taken round at Cambridge to see\r\nthe sights are, or were, called LIONS. The origin of the Tower\r\ncollection was the three leopards sent by the Emperor Frederic to Henry\r\nIII., as a living illustration of the royal arms of England. In the roll\r\nof John de Cravebeadell, constable of the Tower (_B. M. Top.\r\nCollections_, iii. p. 153), is a charge of 3_d._ per day “in support of\r\nthe leopard of our lord the king.” Edward III., when Prince of Wales,\r\nappears to have taken great interest in the animals; and after he became\r\nking, there was not only the old leopard, but “one lion, one lioness,\r\nand two cat-lions,” says Stowe, “in the said Tower, committed to the\r\ncustody of Robert, son of John Bowre.” The menagerie was only abolished\r\nin 1834; and the practice was to allow any person to enter gratis who\r\nbrought with him a little dog to be thrown to the lions!—_Dr. Doran’s\r\nPrinces of Wales._\r\n\r\n~Lip~, talk, bounce, impudence; “come, none o’ yer LIP!”\r\n\r\n~Lip~, to sing; “LIP us a chant,” sing a song.\r\n\r\n~Liquor~, or LIQUOR UP, to drink drams.—_Americanism._ In LIQUOR,\r\ntipsy, or drunk.\r\n\r\n~Little go~, the old term for the examination now called SMALLS.\r\n\r\n~Little snakes-man~, a little thief, who is generally passed through a\r\nsmall aperture to open a door and let in the rest of the gang.\r\n\r\n~Liverpool Irishman~, any man born in Liverpool of Irish parents.

Generally considered an Americanism. LOPER,\r\nor LOAFER, however, was in general use as a cant term in the early part\r\nof the last century. LANDLOPER was a vagabond who begged in the attire\r\nof a sailor; and the sea-phrase, LAND-LUBBER, was doubtless synonymous.\r\n\r\n~Loaver~, money. _See_ LOUR.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Lob~, a till, or money-drawer.\r\n\r\n~Lob-sneaking~, stealing money from tills; occasionally stealing tills\r\nand all.\r\n\r\n~Lobb~, the head.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Loblolly~, gruel.—_Old_: used by Markham as a sea-term for grit gruel,\r\nor hasty pudding.\r\n\r\n~Loblolly boy~, a derisive term for a surgeon’s mate in the navy.\r\n\r\n    “LOB-LOLLY-BOY is a person who on board of a man-of-war attends the\r\n    surgeon and his mates, and one who knows just as much of the\r\n    business of a seaman as the author of this poem.”—_The Patent, a\r\n    Poem_, 4to, 1776.\r\n\r\n~Lobs!~ schoolboys’ signal on the master’s approach.

Sometimes called\r\n“lamp-post.”\r\n\r\n~Long-headed~, far-seeing, clever, calculating.\r\n\r\n~Long-hundred~, a Billingsgate expression for 120 fresh herrings, or\r\nother small fish, the long-hundred being six score.\r\n\r\n~Long-odds~, the odds which denote that the man or animal laid against\r\nhas, or is supposed to have, little or no chance.\r\n\r\n~Long-shore butcher~, a coast-guardsman.—_Sea._ All people who get\r\ntheir livings by the side of the Thames below bridge are called\r\nLONG-SHORE folk.\r\n\r\n~Long-tailed beggar~, a cat. The tale that hangs thereby runs thus:—A\r\nboy, during his first very short voyage to sea, had become so entirely a\r\nseaman, that on his return he had forgotten the name of the cat, and was\r\nobliged, pointing to puss, to ask his mother “what she called that ’ere\r\nLONG-TAILED BEGGAR?” Accordingly, sailors, when they hear a freshwater\r\ntar discoursing too largely on nautical matters, are very apt to say,\r\n“But how, mate, about that ’ere LONG-TAILED BEGGAR?”\r\n\r\n~Long-tailed-one~, a bank-note or “flimsy” for a large amount.\r\n\r\n~Long-tails~, among shooters, are pheasants; among coursers and\r\ndog-fanciers they are greyhounds.\r\n\r\n~Longs~, the latrine at Brasenose, so called because built by LADY\r\nLONG.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Longs-and-shorts~, cards made for cheating.\r\n\r\n~Looking-glass~, a facetious synonym for a _pot de chambre_. This is\r\nvery old. The term arose from the fact that in ancient times this\r\nutensil was the object of very frequent examination by the medical\r\nfraternity. There is an old story of a lady who called at an inn, and\r\ncalled for a LOOKING-GLASS to arrange her hair, and who was presented\r\nwith a chamber utensil.\r\n\r\n~Loony~, a silly fellow, a natural.

The word came much into\r\nvogue during the latest Chinese campaign.\r\n\r\n~Lope~, this old form of leap is often heard in the streets. To LOPE is\r\nalso to steal. _German_, LAUFEN.\r\n\r\n~Lop-sided~, uneven, one side larger than the other. _See Jacob\r\nFaithful._\r\n\r\n~Lord~, a humpbacked man. _See_ MY LORD.\r\n\r\n~Lord~, “drunk as a LORD,” a common saying, probably referring to the\r\nfacilities a man of fortune has for such a gratification; perhaps a sly\r\nsarcasm at the supposed habits of the aristocracy. This phrase had its\r\norigin in the old hard drinking days, when it was almost compulsory on a\r\nman of fashion to get drunk regularly after dinner.\r\n\r\n~Lord-mayor’s-fool~, an imaginary personage who likes everything that is\r\ngood, and plenty of it.\r\n\r\n~Lothario~, a “gay” deceiver; generally a heartless, brainless villain.\r\n\r\n~Loud~, flashy, showy, as applied to dress or manner. _See_ BAGS.\r\n\r\n~Lour~, or LOWR, money; “gammy LOWR,” bad money.

The term is also used at whist, “six LOVE,” “four\r\nLOVE,” when one side has marked up six, four, or any other number, and\r\nthe other none. A writer in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for July, 1780,\r\nderives it either from LUFF, an old Scotch word for the hand, or from\r\nthe _Dutch_, LOEF, the LOOF, weather-gauge (_Sewell’s Dutch Dictionary_,\r\n4to, 1754); but it more probably, from the sense of the following,\r\ndenotes something done without reciprocity.\r\n\r\n~Love~, “to do a thing for LOVE,” _i.e._, for nothing. A man is said to\r\nmarry for LOVE when he gets nothing with his wife; and an Irishman, with\r\nthe bitterest animosity against his antagonist, will fight him for LOVE,\r\n_i.e._, for the mere satisfaction of beating him, and not for a stake.\r\n\r\n~Loveage~, tap droppings, a mixture of stale spirits, sweetened and sold\r\nto habitual dram-drinkers, principally females.

Among seamen an\r\nawkward fellow, a landsman.\r\n\r\n~Lubber’s hole~, an aperture in the maintop of a ship, by which a timid\r\nclimber may avoid the difficulties of the “futtock shrouds;” hence as a\r\nsea-term the LUBBER’S HOLE represents any cowardly way of evading duty.\r\n\r\n~Luck~, “down on one’s LUCK,” wanting money, or in difficulty.\r\n\r\n~Lucky~, “to cut one’s LUCKY,” to go away quickly. _See_ STRIKE.\r\n\r\n~Ludlam’s dog.~ An indolent, inactive person is often said to be “as\r\nlazy as LUDLAM’S DOG, which leaned its head against the wall to bark.”\r\nSailors say “as lazy as Joe the Marine, who laid down his musket to\r\nsneeze.”\r\n\r\n~Lug~, “my togs are in LUG,” _i.e._, in pawn.\r\n\r\n~Lug~, to pull, or slake thirst.—_Old._\r\n\r\n~Lug chovey~, a pawnbroker’s shop.\r\n\r\n~Luke~, nothing.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Lully~, a shirt.\r\n\r\n~Lully prigger~, a rogue who steals wet clothes hung on lines to dry.\r\n\r\n~Lumber~, to pawn or pledge.

What you don’t like must be reckoned with the LUMP.\r\nTo LUMP IT is also to take off at a draught, as medicine or a dram. “He\r\nLUMPED IT down at once.”\r\n\r\n~Lump the lighter~, to be transported.\r\n\r\n~Lump work~, work contracted for, or taken by the LUMP.\r\n\r\n~Lumper~, a contractor. On the river more especially a person who\r\ncontracts to deliver a ship laden with timber.\r\n\r\n~Lumper~, a low thief who haunts wharves and docks, and robs vessels,\r\nalso a person who sells old goods as new.\r\n\r\n~Lumpy~, intoxicated. Also used to signify _enceinte_.\r\n\r\n~Lunan~, a girl.—_Gipsy._\r\n\r\n~Lurch~, a term at the game of cribbage. A is said to LURCH B when the\r\nformer attains the end, or sixty-first hole, of the board before the\r\nlatter has pegged his thirty-first hole; or, in more familiar words,\r\nbefore B has turned the corner. A LURCH sometimes, and then only by\r\nagreement, counts as a double game or rub.\r\n\r\n~Lurk~, a sham, swindle, or representation of feigned distress. An\r\nimposition of any kind is a LURK.\r\n\r\n~Lurker~, an impostor who travels the country with false certificates of\r\nfires, shipwrecks, &c. Also, termed a SILVER BEGGAR, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Lush~, intoxicating drinks of all kinds, but generally used for beer.\r\nIt is generally allowed, as has been stated, that LUSH and its\r\nderivatives claim Lushington, the brewer, as sponsor.\r\n\r\n~Lush~, to drink, or get drunk.\r\n\r\n~Lush-crib~, a public-house.\r\n\r\n~Lushington~, a drunkard, or one who continually soaks himself with\r\nlush. Some years since there was a LUSHINGTON CLUB in Bow Street, Covent\r\nGarden.\r\n\r\n~Lushy~, intoxicated. Johnson says, “opposite to pale,” so red with\r\ndrink. He must, however, have been wrong, as the foregoing derivation\r\nshows.\r\n\r\n~Lylo~, come hither.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Lynch-law~, summary punishment. From an American judge famous for\r\nhanging first and trying afterwards.\r\n\r\n~Mab~, a cab, or hackney-coach.\r\n\r\n~Mace~, to sponge, swindle, or beg, in a polite way: “give it him (a\r\nshopkeeper) on the MACE,” _i.e._, obtain goods on credit and never pay\r\nfor them; also termed “striking the MACE.”\r\n\r\n~Mace~, to welsh, to obtain money without any expectation of being able\r\nto pay or intention of paying.\r\n\r\n~Maceman~, or MACER, a welcher, magsman, or general swindler; a\r\n“street-mugger.”\r\n\r\n~Madza~, half. _Italian_, MEZZA. This word enters into combination with\r\nvarious cant phrases, mainly taken from the _Lingua Franca_, as MADZA\r\nCAROON, half-a-crown, two-and-sixpence; MADZA SALTEE, a halfpenny [_see_\r\nSALTEE]; MADZA POONA, half-a-sovereign; MADZA ROUND THE BULL, half a\r\npound of steak, &c. This word is, in street phraseology, invariably\r\npronounced MEDZER.\r\n\r\n~Mag~, a halfpenny.—_Ancient Cant_, MAKE. MEGS were formerly\r\nguineas.—_B. M.

To MAG in thieves’ slang is to talk well\r\nand persuasively.\r\n\r\n~Maggoty~, fanciful, fidgety. Whims and fancies were formerly termed\r\nMAGGOTS, from the popular belief that a maggot in the brain was the\r\ncause of any odd notion or caprice a person might exhibit. Deer are\r\nsometimes found to have maggots in their brains, which, perhaps,\r\naccounts for the origin of the term.\r\n\r\n~Magsman~, a street swindler, who watches for countrymen and “gullible”\r\npersons, and persuades them out of their possessions. MAGSMEN are\r\nwonderful actors. Their work is done in broad daylight, without any\r\nstage accessories; and often a wink, a look, or a slip of the tongue\r\nwould betray their confederacy. Their ability and perseverance are truly\r\nworthy of a better cause. MAGSMEN are very often men of superior\r\neducation. Those who “work” the tidal trains and boats are often\r\nfaultlessly dressed and highly accomplished.\r\n\r\n~Mahcheen~, a merchant. Chinese pronunciation of the English\r\nword.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Mahogany~, “to have one’s feet under another man’s MAHOGANY,” to sit at\r\nhis table, be supported on other than one’s own resources; “amputate\r\nyour MAHOGANY,” _i.e._, go away, elaboration of “cut your stick.”\r\n\r\n~Mahogany flat~, a bug.\r\n\r\n~Mail~, to post a letter; “this screeve is mailed by a sure hand.”\r\n\r\n~Main-toby~, the highway, or the main road. _See_ TOBY.\r\n\r\n~Make~, any one is said to be “on the MAKE” who asks too high a price\r\nfor his goods, or endeavours in any way to overreach.\r\n\r\n~Make~, to steal, a successful theft or swindle.

Mrs. Partington afterwards succeeded to the mantle of Mrs.\r\nMalaprop; but the phrase Partingtonism is as yet uncoined, for the\r\nsimple reason that Mrs. Malaprop was the original, Mrs. Partington the\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\n~Malley~, a gardener.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Manablins~, broken victuals.\r\n\r\n~Man a-hanging~, a man in difficulties. _See_ HANGING.\r\n\r\n~Mandozy~, a term of endearment among East-end Jews; probably from the\r\nvaliant fighter named Mendoza.\r\n\r\n~Mang~, to talk.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Man-handle~, to use a person roughly, as to take him prisoner, turn him\r\nout of a room, or give him a beating.\r\n\r\n~Man in the moon~, the gentleman who is supposed to find the “pieces” to\r\npay election expenditure and electors’ expenses, so long as the latter\r\nvote his way. _See_ ELECTION INQUIRIES.\r\n\r\n~Marbles~, furniture, movables; “money and MARBLES,” cash and personal\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n~Marchioness~, a little, dirty, old-fashioned maid-of-all-work; a title\r\nnow in regular use, but derived from the remarkable character in the\r\n_Old Curiosity Shop_.\r\n\r\n~Mare’s nest~, a supposed discovery of marvels, which turn out no\r\nmarvels at all; from a story similar to that about the cock neighing.\r\nThree Cockneys, out ruralizing, had determined to find out something\r\nabout nests. Accordingly, when they ultimately came upon a dungheap,\r\nthey judged by the signs therein that it must be a MARE’S NEST,\r\nespecially as they could see the mare close handy. An old preacher in\r\nCornwall up to very lately employed a different simile, as, “It’s like a\r\ncow calving up in a tree.”\r\n\r\n~Marine~, or MARINE RECRUIT, an empty bottle. This expression having\r\nonce been used in the presence of an officer of marines, he was at first\r\ninclined to take it as an insult, until some one adroitly appeased his\r\nwrath by remarking that no offence could be meant, as all that it could\r\npossibly imply was, “one who had done his duty, and was ready to do it\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n~Mark~, to make one’s MARK is to achieve a success literary, artistic,\r\nor otherwise. Men of eminence are said to leave their MARKS on the\r\nearth’s surface. An American poet has described this ambitious, albeit\r\nsomewhat rare, proceeding as leaving “footprints on the sands of time.”\r\n\r\n~Marketeer~, a betting man who devotes himself, by means of special\r\ninformation, to the study of favourites, and the diseases incident to\r\nthat condition of equine life.

So called from the fact that, as in all fair games you must win\r\nonce, you have a safe hold of fortune. The difficulty is to obtain a\r\nbank large enough to do this effectively, or having the bank to find any\r\none who will follow you far enough, in a fair game.\r\n\r\n~Mary Ann~, the title of the dea ex machinâ evolved from trades-unionism\r\nat Sheffield, to the utter destruction of recalcitrant grinders.

Foster, on altering the time\r\nof the legislative sessions.—_Parliamentary Slang._\r\n\r\n~Master of the Mint~, a gardener.\r\n\r\n~Master of the Rolls~, a baker.\r\n\r\n~Mate~, the term a coster or low person applies to a friend, partner, or\r\ncompanion; “me and my MATE did so and so,” is a common phrase with a low\r\nLondoner.

MAUND, however,\r\nis pure Anglo-Saxon, from MAND, a basket. Compare BEG, which is derived\r\nfrom BAG—a curious parallel.\r\n\r\n~Maw~, the mouth; “hold your MAW,” cease talking.\r\n\r\n~Mawworm~, a hypocrite of the most unpleasant kind. From Bickerstaff’s\r\nplay of _The Hypocrite_.

A specious liar is\r\nsaid to be MEALY-MOUTHED.\r\n\r\n~Mean white~, a term of contempt among negroes, in the old slavery days,\r\nfor white men without landed property. A white man in the Southern\r\nStates had no _locus standi_ unless he possessed property, and the\r\nblackest of niggers would have felt insulted at any “poor white trash”\r\nclaiming to be “a man and brother.”\r\n\r\n~Measley~, mean, miserable-looking, “seedy;” “what a MEASLEY-looking\r\nman!” _i.e._, what a wretched, unhappy fellow.\r\n\r\n~Medical Greek~, the slang used by medical students at the hospitals. At\r\nthe London University they have a way of disguising English, described\r\nby Albert Smith as the Gower Street Dialect, which consists in\r\ntransposing the initials of words, _e.g._, “poke a smipe”—smoke a pipe;\r\n“flutter-by”—butterfly, &c. This disagreeable nonsense, which has not\r\neven the recommendation of a little ability in its composition, is often\r\ntermed Marrowskying. _See_ GREEK, ST. GILES’S GREEK, or the “_Ægidiac_”\r\ndialect, Language of ZIPH, &c.\r\n\r\n~Meisensang~, a missionary, Chinese pronunciation of the English\r\nword.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Menagerie~, the orchestra of a theatre.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Menavelings~, odd money remaining after the daily accounts are made up\r\nat a railway booking-office,—usually divided among the clerks. _See_\r\nOVERS and SHORTS.\r\n\r\n~Men of Kent~, men born in that portion of the “garden of England” which\r\nlies east of the Medway, as distinguished from Kentish men born the\r\nother side. The MEN OF KENT are entitled to the benefit of the old laws\r\nof the county, that of gavelkind particularly.\r\n\r\n~Merkin~, a term usually applied to a woman’s privities. Originally\r\nfalse hair for those parts.\r\n\r\n~Merry Dun of Dover~, a large ship figuring in sailors’ yarns. She was\r\nso large that when passing through the Straits of Dover her flying\r\njib-boom knocked down Calais steeple; while, at the same time, the fly\r\nof her ensign swept a flock of sheep off Dover cliffs. She was so lofty\r\nthat a boy who attempted to go to her mast-head found himself a grey old\r\nman when he reached the deck again. This yarn is founded on a story in\r\nthe Scandinavian mythology. There is also a legend among sailors of the\r\ngallant Thunderbomb, which had “ninety-nine decks and no bottom.”\r\n\r\n~Mesopotamia~, a name given to Eaton Square and neighbourhood when first\r\nbuilt. This part was also called Cubitopolis.—_Fashionable slang._\r\n\r\n~Mess~, to interfere unduly. Costermongers refer to police supervision\r\nas MESSING.

IV._, ii. 4.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its origin, there can be now no doubt that the\r\nword is supposed to have particular reference to the habits of the Irish\r\nMIKES, or labourers, though now and again it is borrowed in the\r\ninterests of others.\r\n\r\n~Mild~, second-rate, inferior. _See_ DRAW IT MILD. Also feeble,\r\ninefficient, as “a MILD attempt.” Weak young men who keep bulldogs, and\r\ndress in a “loud” stable style, from a belief that it is very becoming,\r\nare sometimes called “MILD bloaters.”\r\n\r\n~Milk~, a term used in connexion with racing; when a horse is entered in\r\na race for which his owner does not intend him to run, or at all events\r\nin which he does not intend him to win, and bets against him, the animal\r\nis said to “be MILKED.” MILKING, is keeping a horse a favourite, at\r\nshort odds, for a race in which he has no chance whatever, or in which\r\nhe will not be allowed to try, for the purpose of laying against him.\r\n\r\n~Milky ones~, white linen rags.\r\n\r\n~Mill~, a fight, or set to. _Ancient Cant_, MYLL, to rob. Probably\r\nfrom the special opportunities afforded to pickpockets when the ring was\r\na “national institution.”\r\n\r\n~Mill~, to fight or beat.\r\n\r\n~Mill~, the old Insolvent Debtors’ Court. “To go through the MILL” was\r\nequivalent to being “whitewashed.”\r\n\r\n~Mill~, the tread-MILL.\r\n\r\n~Miller.~ To drown the MILLER is to put too much water in anything. The\r\nphrase was originally “to drown the MILLER’S thumb,” or go over the\r\nspecified mark, _i.e._, the thumb-mark, in adding water to ardent\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n~Miller.~ “To give the MILLER” is to engage a person in conversation of\r\nan apparently friendly character, when all at once the bystanders\r\nsurround and pelt him with flour, grease, and filth of various kinds,\r\nflour predominating. This mode of punishing spies, informers, and other\r\nobnoxious individuals, is used by cabmen, omnibus conductors, _et hoc\r\ngenus omne_. Eggs are useful missiles in an engagement of this\r\ndescription. If rotten eggs are not obtainable, ordinary ones will do.\r\n\r\n~Miller.~ This word is frequently called out when a person relates a\r\nstale joke. _See_ JOE.\r\n\r\n~Milvader~, to beat.\r\n\r\n~Mish~, a shirt, or chemise. From COMMISSION, the ancient cant for a\r\nshirt, afterwards shortened to K’MISH or SMISH, and then to MISH.\r\n_French_, CHEMISE; _Italian_, CAMICIA.\r\n\r\n    “With his snowy CAMESE and his shaggy capote.”—_Byron._\r\n\r\n~Mitey~, a cheesemonger.\r\n\r\n~Mitten.~ “To get the MITTEN” is, in Canadian slang, to be jilted.\r\n\r\n~Mittens~, the boxing gloves.\r\n\r\n~Mizzle~, a frequentative form of MIST in both senses; as applied to\r\nweather, it is used by John Gadbury in his _Ephemeris_ in 1695—MISTY\r\nand MIZZLING—to come down as mist; while the other sense may be\r\nexpressed as to fade away like a mist.\r\n\r\n~Mizzle~, to run away, or decamp; to disappear as in a mist. From\r\nMIZZLE, a drizzling rain; a Scotch mist.\r\n\r\n    “And then one MIZZLING Michaelmas night,\r\n    The Count he MIZZLED too.”—_Hood._\r\n\r\n~Mizzler~, or RUM-MIZZLER, a person who is clever at effecting an\r\nescape, or getting out of a difficulty.\r\n\r\n~Moab~, a name applied to the turban-shaped hat which was some\r\nfew years back fashionable among ladies, and ladylike swells of\r\nthe other sex. From the Scripture phrase, “MOAB is my washpot”\r\n(Ps. lx. 8), which latter article the hat in question was supposed\r\nto resemble.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Mob.~ Swift informs us, in his _Art of Polite Conversation_, that MOB\r\nwas, in his time, the slang abbreviation of “mobility,” just as NOB is\r\nof “nobility,” at the present day. _See_ SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n    “It is perhaps this humour of speaking no more words than we needs\r\n    must which has so miserably curtailed some of our words, that in\r\n    familiar writings and conversation they often lose all but their\r\n    first syllables, as in MOB., red., pos., incog., and the\r\n    like.”—_Addison’s Spectator._\r\n\r\n~Mob~, a thief’s immediate companions, as,—“our own MOB;” MOBSMAN, a\r\ndressy swindler or pickpocket.\r\n\r\n~Mob~, to hustle, crowd round, and annoy, necessarily the action of a\r\nlarge party against a smaller one, or an individual. Mobbing is\r\ngenerally a concomitant of street robbery.\r\n\r\n~Mobility~, the populace; or, according to Burke, the “great unwashed.”\r\nJohnson calls it a cant term, although Swift notices it as a proper\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n~Mockered~, holey, marked unpleasantly.

A\r\n“coster” and his “moke” are almost inseparable terms. Probably derived\r\noriginally from the Arabic _al mocreve_, a carrier.\r\n\r\n~Moko~, a name given by sportsmen to pheasants killed by mistake during\r\nSeptember, before the pheasant-shooting comes in.

Costermongers are not alone,\r\neven in the present day, in this belief.\r\n\r\n~Molrowing~, “out on the spree,” in company with so-called “gay women.”\r\nIn allusion to the amatory serenadings of the London cats. Another form\r\nof this is, “out on the tiles.”\r\n\r\n~Mondayish~, or Mondayfied, disinclined for work. “St. Monday” is a\r\ngreat institution among artizans and small tradesmen.\r\n\r\n~Monk~, a term of contempt; probably an abbreviation of MONKEY.\r\n\r\n~Monkey~, spirit or ill temper; “to get one’s MONKEY up,” to rouse his\r\npassion. A man is said to have his MONKEY up or the MONKEY on his back,\r\nwhen he is “riled,” or out of temper; this is old, and was probably in\r\nallusion originally to the evil spirit which was supposed to be always\r\npresent with a man; also under similar circumstances a man is said to\r\nhave his back or hump up.\r\n\r\n~Monkey~, the instrument which drives a rocket.—_Army._\r\n\r\n~Monkey~, 500_l._-_-Sporting Slang._\r\n\r\n~Monkey~, the vessel in which a mess receives its full allowance of\r\ngrog.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Monkey-board~, the place or step attached to an omnibus, on which the\r\nconductor stands.\r\n\r\n~Monkey-boat~, a peculiar, long, narrow, canal boat.\r\n\r\n~Monkey with a long tail~, a mortgage.—_Legal._\r\n\r\n~Monkey’s allowance~, to get blows instead of alms, more kicks than\r\nhalfpence.\r\n\r\n~Monkery~, the country, or rural districts.

Also a period of intoxication. “To be on\r\nthe MOP” is to be on the drink from day to day—to be perpetually\r\n“stale drunk.”\r\n\r\n~Mop up~, to drink, or empty a glass.—_Old Sea term._\r\n\r\n~Mops and brooms~, intoxicated.

There are, in various parts of the country, men who make\r\nMOSKENEERING a profession—that is, they buy jewellery which, though\r\nfairly good, is not so good as it seems, and pawn it as opportunity\r\noccurs. It is notorious that some men can obtain a much larger sum\r\non a given article than others can; though the smallest of these\r\nprofessionals generally manage to get good livings, which does not say\r\nmuch for the judgment of those constant inspectors of personal\r\nproperty—pawnbrokers’ assistants.\r\n\r\n~Mot~, a girl of indifferent character. Formerly, _Mort_. _Dutch_,\r\nMOTT-KAST, a harlotry. MOT-CART, _see_ LOOSE-BOX.\r\n\r\n~Mouchey~, a Jew.\r\n\r\n~Mouldy~, grey-headed.

HARRIS in attestation of the superiority of her\r\nqualifications, and the infallibility of her opinions; and thus afforded\r\na parallel to the two newspapers, which appealed to each other as\r\nindependent authorities, being all the while the production of the same\r\neditorial staff. _See_ introductory article.\r\n\r\n~Mrs. Jones~, the house of office, a water-closet.\r\n\r\n~M.T.~, railway slang used by porters and pointsmen for empties, or\r\nempty carriages. _See_ MOLL THOMSON’S MARK.\r\n\r\n~Much of a muchness~, alike, very much the same thing.\r\n\r\n~Muck~, to beat, or excel. “It’s no use, his luck’s dead in; he’d MUCK a\r\nthousand;” “he MUCKED me clean out,” &c.

Spanish_, MONDONGO, black pudding.\r\n\r\n~Mungarly~, bread, food. MUNG is an old word for mixed food, but\r\nMUNGARLY is doubtless derived from the _Lingua Franca_, MANGIAR, to eat.\r\n_See_ the following.\r\n\r\n~Mungarly casa~, a baker’s shop; evidently a corruption of a Lingua\r\nFranca phrase for an eating-house. The well-known “Nix Mangiare” stairs\r\nat Malta derive their name from the endless beggars who lie there and\r\nshout, “Nix mangiare,” _i.e._, “Nothing to eat,” to excite the\r\ncompassion of the English who land there,—an expression which exhibits\r\nremarkably the mongrel composition of the _Lingua Franca_, MANGIARE\r\nbeing Italian, and _Nix_ (_German_, NICHTS), an evident importation from\r\nTrieste, or other Austrian seaport.\r\n\r\n~Munging~, or MOUNGING, whining, begging, muttering.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Muns~, the mouth. _German_, MUND.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Murerk~, the mistress of the house. _See_ BURERK.\r\n\r\n~Murkarker~, a monkey,—vulgar Cockney pronunciation of MACAUCO, a\r\nspecies of monkey.

This word is very generally used in commercial transactions\r\nall over the world.\r\n\r\n~Mutton~, a contemptuous term for a woman of bad character; sometimes\r\nvaried to LACED MUTTON. The expression was used as a cant term for a\r\n“wild duck” in the reign of James I. As a slang term it was employed by\r\nBen Jonson in his masque of _Neptune’s Triumph_, which was written for\r\ndisplay at Court on Twelfth Night, 1623; “a fine LACED MUTTON or two,”\r\nare the words applied to wantons. Shakspeare has the term. In that class\r\nof English society which does not lay any claim to refinement, a fond\r\nlover is often spoken of as being “fond of his MUTTON,” which, by the\r\nway, in this place does not mean the woman so much as something else.\r\n\r\n~Mutton chops~, a sheep’s-head. A man who has dined off sheep’s-head\r\ndignifies his meal by calling it MUTTON CHOPS (chaps).\r\n\r\n~Mutton-fist~, an uncomplimentary title for any one having a large and\r\nmuscular, bony, or coarse hand.\r\n\r\n~Mutton-walk~, the saloon at Drury Lane Theatre. A vulgar appellation\r\napplied to this place early in the last century, still in use in the\r\nneighbourhood of Covent Garden, which was formerly the great resort for\r\nthe gay and giddy of both sexes.\r\n\r\n~Muzzle~, the mouth.\r\n\r\n~Muzzle~, to fight or thrash; to throttle or garrotte.\r\n\r\n~Muzzler~, a blow in the mouth; a dram of spirits.\r\n\r\n~Muzzy~, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~My aunt~, AUNT JONES, or MRS.

It is worthy of remark that\r\nthe French call this useful relative “ma tante,” my aunt.\r\n\r\n~Nab~, to catch, to seize; “NAB the rust,” to take offence.—_Ancient_,\r\nfourteenth century. _See_ NAP.\r\n\r\n~Nab the rust~, to take offence.\r\n\r\n~Nabob~, an Eastern prince, a retired Indian official,—hence a slang\r\nterm for a capitalist. From Nawaub.\r\n\r\n~Nabs~, self; my NABS, myself; his NABS, himself.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Nag~, to persistently talk in a scolding manner, after the manner of\r\nMrs. Caudle. NAGGING is supposed to be persistent, persevering,\r\npassionless scolding.\r\n\r\n~Nail~, to steal, or capture; “paid on the NAIL,” _i.e._, paid ready\r\nmoney; NAILED, taken up, or caught,—probably in allusion to the\r\npractice of NAILING bad money to the counter. We say, “as dead as a\r\ndoor-NAIL;” most possibly because of “apt alliteration.” Shakspeare has\r\nthe expression in _Henry IV._—\r\n\r\n    “_Falstaff._ What! is the old king dead?\r\n\r\n    _Pistol._ As NAIL in door.”\r\n\r\nDickens, in that marvellous little book, _A Christmas Carol_, says:—\r\n\r\n    “Old Marley was as dead as a DOOR-NAIL.\r\n\r\n    “Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge what\r\n    there is particularly dead about a DOOR-NAIL. I might have been\r\n    inclined myself to regard a COFFIN-NAIL as the deadest piece of\r\n    ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the\r\n    simile: and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the\r\n    country’s done for. You will, therefore, permit me to repeat,\r\n    emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a DOOR-NAIL.”\r\n\r\n~Nail in one’s coffin~, a dram, “a drop o’ summat’ short,” a jocular,\r\nbut disrespectful phrase, used by the lower orders to each other at the\r\nmoment of lifting a glass of spirits to their lips. “Well, good luck!\r\nhere’s another NAIL IN MY COFFIN.” This is probably in ridicule of\r\nteetotal or temperance preachers, and the arguments adduced by them.\r\nAnother phrase with old topers is “shedding a tear,” also “wiping an\r\neye.”\r\n\r\n~Namby-pamby~, particular, over-nice, effeminate. This was possibly of\r\nPope’s invention, and first applied by him to the affected short-lined\r\nverses addressed by Ambrose Phillips to Lord Carteret’s infant children.\r\n_See Johnson’s Life of Pope._\r\n\r\n~Nammus~, or NAMOUS, to be off, to get away; “let’s NAMMUS, somebody’s\r\ncoming.” _See_ VAMOS.\r\n\r\n~Nanny-shop~, a disreputable house.\r\n\r\n~Nantee~, not any, or “I have none.” NANTEE also means “shut up!” or\r\n“leave off!” _Italian_, NIENTE, nothing. _See_ DINARLY.—_Lingua\r\nFranca._\r\n\r\n~Nantee palaver~, no conversation, _i.e._, hold your tongue.

There is no nicety in NINEPENCE!”\r\nEvidently this correspondent does not know how nice it is to have\r\nninepence, after being without money.

Used in America to express a\r\nwife’s imaginations with regard to her husband’s doings.\r\n\r\n~Nouse~, comprehension, perception.—_Old_, apparently from the _Greek_,\r\nνοῦς. _Gaelic_ and _Irish_, NOS, knowledge, perception.\r\n\r\n~Nowhere~, horses not placed in a race—that are neither first, second,\r\nnor third—are said to be NOWHERE, especially when this lack of position\r\nhappens to favourites.\r\n\r\n~Number of his mess~, when a man dies in the army or navy, he is said to\r\n“lose the NUMBER OF HIS MESS.”\r\n\r\n~Nurse~, a curious term applied to competition in omnibuses. Two\r\nomnibuses are placed on the road to NURSE, or take care of, each\r\nopposition “bus,” one before, the other behind. Of course the central or\r\nNURSED bus has very little chance, unless it happens to be a favourite\r\nwith the public. Recent legislation and tramways have done much to do\r\naway with NURSING. NURSE also means to cheat or swindle; trustees are\r\nsometimes said to NURSE property, _i.e._, gradually eat it up\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n~Nut~, the head, in pugilistic slang. Used as an exclamation at a fight,\r\nit means to strike on the head. In tossing it is a direction to hide the\r\nhead; to be “off one’s NUT,” to be crazed or idiotic.\r\n\r\n~Nut-cut~, roguish, mischievous. A good-natured term of\r\nreproach.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Nuts~, to be NUTS on anything or person is to be pleased with or fond\r\nof it or him; a self-satisfied man is said to be NUTS on himself.\r\nNUTTED, taken in by a man who professed to be NUTS on you.\r\n\r\n~Nux~, the “plant,” or object in view. “Stoll up to the NUX?” “Do you\r\nfully comprehend what is wanted?”—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Oaf~, a lumbering, awkward fellow.\r\n\r\n~Oak~, the outer door of college rooms; to “sport one’s OAK,” to be “not\r\nat home” to visitors. _See_ SPORT.—_University._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A “Sporting Door,” or “Oak.”]\r\n\r\n~Oar~, “to put in an OAR,” to interfere.\r\n\r\n    “I put my OAR in no man’s boat.”—_Thackeray._\r\n\r\n~Oat~, an atom. Probable corruption of iota, or perhaps from the small\r\nsize of an oat. “I never got an OAT of it,” I never received the\r\nsmallest portion.\r\n\r\n~Oat-stealer~, an ostler.\r\n\r\n~Obfuscated~, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~Obliquitous~, oblivious of distinction between right and\r\nwrong.—_American._\r\n\r\n~Obstropolous~, Cockney corruption of obstreperous.\r\n\r\n~Ochre~, money, generally applied to gold, for a very obvious reason.\r\n\r\n~O’clock~, “like ONE O’CLOCK,” a favourite comparison with the lower\r\norders, implying briskness; otherwise “like winkin’.” “To know what’s\r\nO’CLOCK” is to be wide-awake, sharp, and experienced.\r\n\r\n~Odd man out~, a street or public-house game at tossing. The number of\r\nplayers is three or more. Each tosses up a coin, and if two come down\r\nhead, and one comes tail, or _vice versâ_, the ODD MAN loses or wins, as\r\nmay have been agreed upon. Frequently used to victimize a “flat.” If all\r\nbe alike, then the toss goes for nothing, and the coppers are again\r\n“skied.” It is easy for two men to arrange matters beforehand at this\r\ngame, and so swindle a third.\r\n\r\n~Odd man~, a man who trains in company with a boat’s crew, so that in\r\nthe event of any one falling ill the seat will be fairly occupied.\r\n\r\n~Odds~, a phrase equivalent to “consequence;” “what’s the ODDS?” _i.e._,\r\nwhat is the expected result? “It’s no ODDS,” _i.e._, of no consequence.\r\nODDS, in sporting phraseology, refers to the proportions or differences\r\nof a bet. One bookmaker will lay ODDS of “six to one” against such a\r\nhorse winning; whilst another, more speculative, or in the receipt of a\r\nfirst-rate “tip” (information about the horse in question) will lay\r\n“eight,” or even “ten to one.”\r\n\r\n~Od rot it~ (_Colman’s Broad Grins_), DRAT IT, OD’S BLOOD, and all other\r\nexclamations commencing with OD, are nothing but softened or suppressed\r\noaths. OD is a corruption of GOD, and DRAT of ROT.\r\n\r\n~Off and on~, vacillating; “an OFF AND ON kind of a chap,” one who is\r\nalways undecided.\r\n\r\n~Off at the head~, crazy.—_Oxfordshire._\r\n\r\n~Off one’s chump.~ To be crazy is to be OFF ONE’S CHUMP; this is varied\r\nby the word CHUMPY. A mild kind of lunatic is also said to be “off his\r\nhead,” which means of course exactly the same as the first phrase.\r\n\r\n~Off one’s feed.~ To be unable to eat is to be OFF ONE’S FEED.\r\nOriginally stable slang.\r\n\r\n~Off the horn~, a term used in reference to very hard steak, which is\r\nfancifully said to be OFF THE HORN.\r\n\r\n~Office~, “to give the OFFICE,” to give a hint dishonestly to a\r\nconfederate, thereby enabling him to win a game or bet, the profits\r\nbeing shared. Also in sporting phraseology to give any information worth\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\n~Offish~, distant, not familiar. Corruption of STAND-OFFISH.\r\n\r\n~Ogle~, to look, or reconnoitre.\r\n\r\n~Ogles~, eyes.—_Old Cant. French_, ŒIL.\r\n\r\n~Oil of palms~, or PALM OIL, money.\r\n\r\n~Ointment~, medical student slang for butter.\r\n\r\n~O. K.~, a matter to be O. K. (OLL KORRECT, _i.e._, all correct), must\r\nbe on the “square,” and perfectly in order. This is an Americanism, and\r\nis derived from the initials O. K., said to have been marked on a\r\ndocument by an official to signify that all was right and proper.\r\n\r\n~Old boots~, a simile as general in its application as it is irrelevant.\r\n“Like OLD BOOTS” means like anything. “As cheeky as OLD BOOTS;” “As\r\nquick as OLD BOOTS,” seem a little more reasonable, new boots being\r\nsomewhat unfavourable to speedy locomotion.\r\n\r\n~Old dog~, a knowing blade, an experienced person. Butler uses the\r\nphrase, _Hudibras_, part ii. canto iii. 208, where it was said of\r\nSidrophel, “And was OLD DOG at physiology.” An Irish proverb says, “OLD\r\nDOG for hard road,” meaning that it requires an experienced person to\r\nexecute a difficult undertaking.\r\n\r\n~Old gentleman~, the devil. Also a card almost imperceptibly longer than\r\nthe rest of the pack, used by sharpers for the purpose of cheating.\r\n\r\n~Old gooseberry~ (_see_ GOOSEBERRY), OLD HARRY (_Old Hairy_), OLD\r\nSCRATCH, all synonyms for the devil.\r\n\r\n~Old gown~, smuggled tea.\r\n\r\n~Old horse~, salt junk, or beef.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Old hoss~, a term of endearment, originally an Americanism, but now in\r\ncommon use here among friends.\r\n\r\n~Old Lady in Threadneedle Street~, the Bank of England.\r\n\r\n~Old man~, in American merchant ships, the master. The phrase is\r\nbecoming common in English ships.\r\n\r\n~Old salt~, a thorough sailor.\r\n\r\n~Old Tom~, extra strong gin; sometimes termed CAT’S WATER. Various\r\nreasons are given for the use of the words OLD TOM. The distillers have\r\nthe sign of a tom cat on their illuminated placards. The origin of the\r\nphrase is, however, in the fact that the managing clerk of a once\r\ncelebrated “gin-spinning” firm, who was known as OLD TOM, used to keep a\r\nspecial bottle of extra good stuff with which to regale customers when\r\nthey settled their accounts. To get a drink of OLD TOM’S was then a\r\ngreat favour. Gradually the title became popular as representing very\r\ngood strong gin.\r\n\r\n~Oliver~, the moon; “OLIVER don’t widdle,” _i.e._, the moon does not\r\nshine. _Nearly obsolete._\r\n\r\n~Ollapod~, a country apothecary. From George Coleman’s comedy of _The\r\nPoor Gentleman_.\r\n\r\n~Omee~, a master or landlord; “the OMEE of the carsey’s a nark on the\r\npitch,” the master of the house will not let us perform. _Italian_,\r\nUOMO, a man; “UOMO DELLA CASA,” the master of the house. _Latin_,\r\nHOMO.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Omnium gatherum~, an indiscriminate collection of articles; a numerous\r\nand by no means select assemblage.\r\n\r\n~On~, “to be ON,” in public-house or vulgar parlance, is synonymous with\r\ngetting “tight” or tipsy; “it’s St. Monday with him, I see he’s ON\r\nagain,” _i.e._, drunk as usual, or on the road to it. “I’m ON” also\r\nexpresses a person’s acceptance of an offered bet. To GET ON a horse or\r\na man is to make bets on it or him. “Try it ON,” a defiant challenge to\r\na person.\r\n\r\n~On the fly~, getting one’s living by thieving or other illegitimate\r\nmeans; the phrase is applied to men the same as “on the loose” is to\r\nwomen. ON THE FLY also means on the drink.\r\n\r\n~On the loose~, obtaining a living by prostitution; in reality, on the\r\nstreets. The term is applied to females only, excepting in the case of\r\n“sprees,” when men carousing are sometimes said to be ON THE LOOSE.\r\n\r\n~On the nose~, on the watch or look-out. _See_ NOSE.\r\n\r\n~On the shelf~, transported. With old maids it has another and very\r\ndifferent meaning.\r\n\r\n~On the tiles~, out all night “on the spree,” or carousing,—in allusion\r\nto the London cats on their amatory excursions. _See_ CATERWAULING.\r\n\r\n~One-er~, that which stands for ONE, a blow that requires no repeating.\r\nIn _The Old Curiosity Shop_, the “Marchioness” tells Dick Swiveller that\r\n“her missus is a ONE-ER”—there a variation of “stunner.”\r\n\r\n~One in ten~, a parson. In allusion to the tithing system.\r\n\r\n~Onion~, a watch-seal.\r\n\r\n~O. P.~ Publishers’ reply to an inquiry for a book or paper that is OUT\r\nOF PRINT.\r\n\r\n~Open the ball~, to commence anything.\r\n\r\n~Oracle~, “to work the ORACLE,” to plan, manœuvre, to succeed by a wily\r\nstratagem.\r\n\r\n~Orate~, an Americanism, which means, to speak in public, or make an\r\noration.\r\n\r\n~Organ-grinder~, an itinerant who is supposed to “GRIND” music out of a\r\nbarrel-organ.\r\n\r\n~Originator~, an inventor of plans for the formation of joint-stock\r\ncompanies. The originator submits his schemes to the promoter, who\r\naccepts or rejects them.\r\n\r\n~Otter~, eightpence. _Italian_, OTTO, eight.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Ottomy~, a thin man, a skeleton, a dwarf. Vulgar pronunciation of\r\nANATOMY. Shakspeare has ATOMY.\r\n\r\n~Out~, a dram glass. These glasses are two-OUT (half-quartern),\r\nthree-OUT, and four-OUT. An _habitué_ of a gin-shop, desirous of\r\ntreating a brace of friends, calls for “a quartern of gin and three\r\nOUTS,” by which he means three glasses which will exactly contain the\r\nquartern. Really, the word glasses is understood. The man actually\r\nmeans, and one or more three-OUT glasses.\r\n\r\n~Out~, in round games, where several play, and there can be but one\r\nloser, the winners in succession STAND OUT, while the others PLAY OFF.\r\n\r\n~Out and out~, prime, excellent, of the first quality; beyond measure.\r\nOUT-AND-OUTER, one who is of an OUT-AND-OUT description, “up” to\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nAn ancient MS. has this couplet, which shows the antiquity of the\r\nphrase:—\r\n\r\n    “The Kyng was good alle aboute,\r\n    And she was wycked OUTE AND OUTE.”\r\n\r\n~Outcry~, an auction.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Outing~, a day’s holiday. The Oxford and Cambridge boatrace, the Derby,\r\nand other events of a like character, are each said to be simply excuses\r\nto the Cockneys for a day’s OUTING.\r\n\r\n~Out of collar~, out of place,—in allusion to servants. When in place,\r\nthe term is IN COLLAR. Most likely from “head in the COLLAR,” said of\r\nhorses when hard at work.\r\n\r\n~Out on the loose~, “on the spree,” in search of adventures. _See_ ON\r\nTHE LOOSE.\r\n\r\n~Out on the pickaroon.~ PICARONE is Spanish for a thief, but this phrase\r\ndoes not necessarily mean anything dishonest, but is often used to mean\r\nreadiness for anything in the way of excitement. It also means to be in\r\nsearch of anything profitable, without much care as to honesty or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n~Outsider~, a person who does not habitually bet, or is not admitted to\r\nthe “ring,” a duffer or good-for-nothing fellow. Also, a horse whose\r\nname does not appear among the “favourites.”—_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Over!~ or OVER THE LEFT, _i.e._, the left shoulder—a common\r\nexclamation of disbelief in what is being narrated,—sometimes implying\r\nthat the results of a proposed plan will be OVER THE LEFT, _i.e._, in\r\nthe wrong direction, loss instead of gain.\r\n\r\n~Over~, generally used in connexion with come, as, “He came it rather\r\nstrong OVER me,” _i.e._, tried to intimidate or compel me. The same\r\nphrase would also be used to imply that an excess of flattery or praise\r\nwas being employed for a similar purpose, but that the adulation was\r\nbeing “laid on a little too thick” to be considered genuine. Also used\r\nthus sometimes: “You mustn’t come Shakspeare OVER me,” _i.e._, “you\r\nmustn’t assume an air of immeasurable literary superiority OVER me.”\r\n“You mustn’t come Rothschild OVER me,” &c.\r\n\r\n~Over~, in cricket, four balls delivered from one end to another. After\r\nan OVER has been bowled, the fielders, wicket-keepers, &c., change ends,\r\nand the bowling goes on from the recent batting wicket. A MAIDEN-OVER is\r\nan OVER from which no runs are obtained. Four balls is the regulation\r\nnumber to an OVER in all important matches; but little clubs and\r\npractice elevens suit their own convenience.\r\n\r\n~Overs~, the odd money remaining after the daily accounts are made up at\r\na banking-house,—usually divided amongst the clerks. _See_ MENAVELINGS\r\nand SHORTS.\r\n\r\n~Owned~, a slang expression used by the ultra-Evangelicals when a\r\npopular preacher makes many converts. The converts themselves are called\r\nhis “seals.”\r\n\r\n~P. P.~, an expression much in use among racing men, which means play or\r\npay, _i.e._, either go on with the arrangement or forfeit the money. The\r\nfollowing is a law of the turf on the subject:—\r\n\r\n    The following races shall be considered “play or pay”:—The Derby\r\n    and Oaks at Epsom, the St. Leger at Doncaster, the Two Thousand\r\n    Guineas, the One Thousand Guineas, the Cesarewitch and\r\n    Cambridgeshire, at Newmarket, the Ascot, Goodwood, and Doncaster\r\n    Cups, and all handicaps above 200 sovs. value with two forfeits, the\r\n    minor of which shall not be less than 5 sovs.; and the Committees of\r\n    Tattersall’s, and of the Subscription Room at Newmarket, will take\r\n    no cognisance of any disputes respecting “play or pay” bets on any\r\n    other races, or of any bets made upon handicap races before the\r\n    weights are published.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact law on the subject, but as a rule all bets on\r\nhorse-racing are considered P. P. unless otherwise arranged. In all\r\nmatches, though, whether turf, pedestrian, aquatic, or otherwise, a run\r\nis given for the money in ordinary betting transactions.\r\n\r\n~P’s and q’s~, particular points, precise behaviour; “mind your P’S and\r\nQ’S,” be very careful. Originating, according to some, from the\r\nsimilarity of P’S and Q’S in the hornbook alphabet, and therefore the\r\nwarning of an old dame to her pupils, or, according to others, of a\r\nFrench dancing-master to his pupils, to mind their _pieds_ (feet) and\r\n_queues_ (wigs) when bowing.\r\n\r\n~Pack~, to go away; “now, then, PACK off there,” _i.e._, be off, don’t\r\nstop here any longer.—_Old._ “Make speede to flee, be PACKING\r\nawaie.”—_Baret’s Alvearie_, 1580. Contraction of “PACK up and be off.”\r\nSometimes the term “sent PACKING” is used to indicate a sudden\r\ndischarge, as of a servant or mistress.\r\n\r\n~Packets~, hoaxing lies. Sometimes used as an exclamation of\r\nincredulity.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Pad~, “to stand PAD,” to beg with a small piece of paper pinned on the\r\nbreast, inscribed, “I am starving.”\r\n\r\n~Pad~, the highway; also a tramp or itinerant musician.\r\n\r\n~Pad the hoof~, to walk; “PADDING THE HOOF, on the high toby,” tramping\r\nor walking on the high road.\r\n\r\n    “Trudge, plod away o’ the HOOF.”—_Merry Wives_, i. 3.\r\n\r\n~Padding~, the light articles in the monthly magazines, of which the\r\nserial stories are the main attraction. Publishers of magazines seem to\r\nthink that if they get a serial story from a popular novelist they can\r\npack any amount of rubbish into the remaining pages. This is not so in\r\nAmerica, as magazines like the _Atlantic Monthly_ and the _Overland\r\nMonthly_ show.\r\n\r\n~Padding-ken~, or CRIB, tramps’ and boys’ lodging-house.\r\n\r\n~Paddle~, to go or run away.—_American._\r\n\r\n~Paddy~, PAT, or PADDY WHACK, an Irishman. A nickname of PATRICK.\r\n\r\n    “I’m PADDY WHACK, from Ballyhack,\r\n      Not long ago turn’d soldier;\r\n    In storm and sack, in front attack,\r\n      None other can be boulder.”—_Irish Song._\r\n\r\n~Paddy’s goose~, the sign of the White Swan, a noted flash public-house\r\nin the east of London, supposed to be Paddy’s idea of a GOOSE.\r\n\r\n~Paddy’s land~, “ould Ireland.”\r\n\r\n~Padre~, a clergyman. From the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n~Pal~, a partner, acquaintance, friend, an accomplice. _Gipsy_, a\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n~Palampo~, a quilt or bed-cover. Probably from PALANPORE, a town in\r\nIndia, renowned for its manufacture of chintz\r\ncounterpanes.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Palaver~, to ask, or talk—deceitfully or otherwise, as occasion\r\nrequires; “PALAVER to his nibs for a shant of bivvy,” ask the master for\r\na pot of beer. NANTEE PALAVER (pronounced PERLARVER), cease talking. In\r\nthis sense used by tramps. Derived from the Portuguese.\r\n\r\n~Pall~, to stop; “PALL that,” spoken authoritatively, means, cease what\r\nyou are doing. From PALL, a small instrument which is used to stop the\r\nwindlass or capstan at sea. When a man says, “I am PALLED,” he\r\nmeans he cannot or dare not say any more. A sailor, on receiving any\r\nextraordinary intelligence, will say, “You PALL me,” _i.e._, you\r\nconfound me. Most likely from the order frequently given on board ship,\r\n“Ease and PALL.”\r\n\r\n~Palm~, to impose upon. “You can’t PALM that off upon me,” is said when\r\nan intending purchaser is suspicious of the quality of the article\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n~Palm oil~, or PALM SOAP, money; also, a bribe.\r\n\r\n~Palmer~, a swindler who used to visit shops under the pretence of\r\ncollecting harp halfpence. To induce shopkeepers to search for them, he\r\noffered thirteenpence for one shilling’s-worth, when many persons were\r\nsilly enough to empty a large quantity of copper on their counters. The\r\nPALMER, a proficient with his fingers, generally contrived to conceal\r\nsome before he left the shop.\r\n\r\n~Palming~, robbing shops by pairs—one thief bargaining with apparent\r\nintent to purchase, whilst the other watches his opportunity to steal.\r\nThe following anecdote will give an idea of their _modus operandi_. A\r\nman once entered a “ready-made” boot and shoe shop, and desired to be\r\nshown a pair of boots—his companion staying outside and amusing himself\r\nby looking in at the window. The one who required to be fresh shod was\r\napparently of a humble and deferential turn, for he placed his hat on\r\nthe floor directly he stepped into the shop. Boot after boot was tried\r\non until at last a fit was obtained, when in rushed a man, snatched up\r\nthe customer’s hat left near the door, and ran down the street as fast\r\nas his legs could carry him. Away went the customer after his hat, and\r\nCrispin, standing at the door, clapped his hands, and shouted, “Go it,\r\nyou’ll catch him!”—little thinking that it was a concerted trick, and\r\nthat neither his boots nor the customer would ever return. Instances of\r\nthis kind of work frequently occur. PALMING sometimes refers to\r\nsecreting money or rings in the hand, as well as to bribing. PALMING is\r\nalso the generic term for all that kind of conjuring which depends on\r\nmanual dexterity, and which is totally distinct from the\r\nmechanical-contrivance department.\r\n\r\n~Pam~, the knave of clubs at the game of loo; or, in street phraseology,\r\nwhile the “Judicious Bottleholder” was alive, Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\n~Pannikin~, a small pan.\r\n\r\n~Pannum~, food, bread.—_Lingua Franca_, PANNEN; _Latin_, PANIS;\r\n_Ancient Cant_, YANNAM.\r\n\r\n~Pannum-bound~, said of a pauper or prisoner when his food is stopped.\r\nPANNUM-STRUCK, very hungry, starving.\r\n\r\n~Panny~, a house—public or otherwise; “flash PANNY,” a public-house\r\nused by thieves; PANNY-MEN, housebreakers. PANNY, in thieves’ cant, also\r\nsignifies a burglary.\r\n\r\n~Pantalettes~, the drawers worn in America by little girls.\r\n\r\n~Pantile~, a hat. The term PANTILE is properly applied to the mould into\r\nwhich the sugar is poured which is afterwards known as “loaf sugar.”\r\nThus, PANTILE, from whence comes the phrase, “a sugar-loaf hat,”\r\noriginally signified a tall, conical hat, in shape similar to that\r\nusually represented as the head-gear of a bandit. From PANTILE the more\r\nmodern slang term TILE has been derived. Halliwell gives PANTILE SHOP, a\r\nmeeting-house, from the steeple-crowned or PANTILE hats of its\r\nfrequenters. PANTILE also means a flat cake with jam on it, given to\r\nboys at boarding-schools instead of pudding.\r\n\r\n~Pantiler~, a Dissenting preacher. Probably from the practice of the\r\nQuakers, and many Dissenters, of not removing their hats in a place of\r\nworship; or from the sugar-loaf hats originally worn by Puritans.\r\nAnother derivation is from the earthen tiles, technically PANTILES\r\n(tiles hollowed in the middle, as distinguished from “pintiles,” the\r\nolder sort, which are flat, smaller, and pinned or nailed to the\r\nrafters), with which meeting-houses of Dissenters are usually covered;\r\nhence the meeting-house came to be called a PANTILE, and its frequenters\r\nPANTILERS.\r\n\r\n~Pants~, American term for trousers. Here used to represent the long\r\ndrawers worn underneath.\r\n\r\n~Panupetaston~, a loose overcoat with wide sleeves, now out of\r\nfashion.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Paper-maker~, a rag-gatherer, or gutter-raker—similar to the\r\nchiffonnier of Paris. Also, a man who tramps through the country, and\r\ncollects rags on the pretence that he is an agent to a paper mill.\r\n\r\n~Paper-Worker~, a wandering vendor of street literature; one who sells\r\nballads, dying speeches, and confessions, sometimes termed a “running\r\nstationer.”\r\n\r\n~Parachute~, a parasol.\r\n\r\n~Paradise~, French slang for the gallery of a theatre, “up amongst the\r\nGODS,” which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Parish lantern~, the moon.\r\n\r\n~Parish prig~, or PARISH BULL, a parson.—_Thieves’ cant._\r\n\r\n~Parney~, rain; “dowry of PARNEY,” a quantity of rain. _Anglo-Indian_\r\nslang from the _Hindoo_, PANI, water; _Gipsy_, PANE. Old Indian officers\r\nalways call brandy-and-water “brandy PAWNEE.”\r\n\r\n~Parson~, a signpost. Common term in the north, where they say that the\r\nPARSON points, but does not lead. This is given, as the lawyers say,\r\n“without prejudice.”\r\n\r\n~Parson Trulliber~, a rude, vulgar, country clergyman, devoted to\r\nagricultural pursuits; the race is most probably now extinct. From the\r\npig-feeding and pig-headed parson in _Joseph Andrews_.\r\n\r\n~Parson’s nose~, the hind part of a goose—a savoury mouthful. Sometimes\r\ncalled the POPE’S NOSE.\r\n\r\n~Part~, to pay, restore, or give up; “he’s a right un, he is; I know’d\r\nhe’d PART,” _i.e._, he is a liberal (or punctual) person, and pays his\r\ndebts, or bestows gratuities. The term is in general use in sporting\r\ncircles, and is very commonly employed when speaking of the settlement\r\nof bets after a race. It is probably derived from the very common\r\nreference to stingy people, who are described as not liking to PART with\r\ntheir money.\r\n\r\n~Parter~, a free, liberal person. Sometimes called a “good PARTER.” Any\r\none who looks twice at his money, or who doesn’t pay it at all, is\r\ncalled a “bad PARTER.”\r\n\r\n~Party~, a person—term in very general use, similar in application to\r\nthe German pronoun, MAN, a person, people; “where’s the PARTY as ’ad a’\r\norter be lookin’ after this ’ere ’oss?” policeman’s inquiry of the wrong\r\ncabman; “old PARTY,” an elderly person. The term is said to have arisen\r\nin our old justice courts, where, to save “his worship” and the clerk of\r\nthe court any trouble in exercising their memories with the names of the\r\ndifferent plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses, the word PARTY was\r\ngenerally employed. Dean Alford remarked:—\r\n\r\n    “The word PARTY for a man is especially offensive. Strange to say,\r\n    the use is not altogether modern. It occurs in the English version\r\n    of the Apocryphal book of Tobit, vi. 7. ‘If an evil spirit trouble\r\n    any, one must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and\r\n    the PARTY shall be no more vexed.’”\r\n\r\nIn Shakspeare we find the term:—\r\n\r\n    “_Stephano._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to\r\n    the PARTY?”—_Tempest_, iii. 2.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only instance of the word being used by the immortal\r\nbard. “I once heard,” said the Dean just quoted, “a venerable dignitary\r\npointed out by a railway porter as an old PARTY in a shovel.” The last\r\nword is the vulgar term applied to the peculiar hat worn by clerical\r\ndignitaries.\r\n\r\n~Pash~, to strike; now corrupted to BASH, which _see_.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Paste~, to beat, to thrash vigorously.\r\n\r\n~Pasteboard~, a visiting card; “to PASTEBOARD a person,” to drop a card\r\nat an absent person’s house.\r\n\r\n~Paste-horn~, the nose. Shoemakers nickname any shopmate with a large\r\nnose “old PASTE-HORN,” from the shape of the horn in which they keep\r\ntheir paste.\r\n\r\n~Pasty~, a bookbinder.\r\n\r\n~Patch.~ This old English term of reproach, long obsolete in polite\r\nlanguage, may yet occasionally be heard in sentences like these:—“Why,\r\nhe’s not a PATCH upon him,” _i.e._, he is not to be compared with him;\r\n“one’s not a PATCH on the other,” &c. Shakspeare uses the word in the\r\nsense of a paltry fellow:—\r\n\r\n    “What a pied ninny’s this? thou scurvy PATCH!”\r\n\r\nIn old English PATCH meant a fool, a wearer of patched clothes of\r\nmotley.\r\n\r\n~Patent coats~, the first coat, with the pockets inside the skirt, were\r\nso termed.\r\n\r\n~Patter~, a speech or discourse, a pompous street oration, a judge’s\r\nsumming up, a trial. Ancient word for muttering. Probably from the\r\n_Latin_, PATERNOSTER, or Lord’s Prayer. This was said, before the\r\nReformation, in a “low voice” by the priest, until he came to “and lead\r\nus not into temptation,” to which the choir responded, “but deliver us\r\nfrom evil.” In the reformed Prayer Book this was altered, and the Lord’s\r\nPrayer directed to be said “with a _loud voice_.” Dr. Pusey takes this\r\nview of the derivation in his _Letter to the Bishop of London_, p. 78,\r\n1851. Scott uses the word twice, in _Ivanhoe_ and the _Bride of\r\nLammermoor_.\r\n\r\n~Patter~, to talk. PATTER FLASH, to speak the language of thieves, talk\r\ncant.\r\n\r\n~Patteran~, a gipsy trail, made by throwing down a handful of grass\r\noccasionally, especially where they have turned off from the main road.\r\n\r\n~Patter-crib~, a flash house.\r\n\r\n~Patterer~, one of a race now nearly defunct, who cried last dying\r\nspeeches, &c., in the streets. The term is also applied to those who\r\nhelp off their wares by long harangues in the public thoroughfares.\r\nThese men, to use their own term, “are the aristocracy of the street\r\nsellers,” and despise the costermongers for their ignorance, boasting\r\nthat they live by their intellect, which, as they do not live\r\nwonderfully well, is no particularly wise boast.\r\n\r\n~Pattern~, a common vulgar phrase for “patent.”\r\n\r\n~Paul Pry~, an inquisitive person. From the well-known comedy.\r\n\r\n~Paw~, the hand. PAW-CASES, gloves. Boots are in some parts of Ireland\r\ncalled “gloves for the feet.”\r\n\r\n~Pay~, to beat a person, or “serve him out.” Originally a nautical term,\r\nmeaning to stop the seams of a vessel with pitch (_French_, POIX);\r\n“here’s the d‑‑‑‑l to PAY, and no pitch hot,” said when any catastrophe\r\noccurs which there is no means of averting; “to PAY over face and eyes,\r\nas the cat did the monkey;” “to PAY through the nose,” to give a\r\nridiculous price,—an expressive phrase of which no one seems to know\r\nthe origin. Shakspeare uses PAY in the sense of to beat or thrash.\r\n\r\n~Pay~, to deliver. “PAY that letter to Mr. So-and-so” is a very common\r\ndirection to a Chinese servant.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Pay-away~, “go on with your story, or discourse.” From the nautical\r\nphrase PAY-AWAY, meaning to allow a rope to run out of a vessel. When\r\nthe hearer considers the story quite long enough, he, carrying out the\r\nsame metaphor, exclaims “hold on.”\r\n\r\n~Peach~, an informer against omnibus conductors and drivers, one\r\nespecially hired by the proprietors to count passengers and stoppages.\r\nThe term is in frequent use amongst omnibus-men. This is about the only\r\ninstance known of the verb being used as a substantive.\r\n\r\n~Peach~, to inform against or betray. Webster states that the word\r\n“impeach” is now mostly used, and that PEACH is confined principally to\r\nthe conversation of thieves and the lower orders. The word was\r\noriginally “impeach,” though it was never until lately used in the same\r\nway as its abridgment.\r\n\r\n~Peacock horse~, amongst undertakers, is one with a showy tail and mane,\r\nwhich holds its head up well. PEACOCKY refers to an objectionable high\r\naction among racehorses.\r\n\r\n~Peaking~, remnants of cloth. Term amongst drapers and cloth\r\nwarehousemen.\r\n\r\n~Peaky~, sickly, delicate.\r\n\r\n~Pec~, a term used by the Eton boys for money, an abbreviation, of\r\ncourse, of the _Latin_ PECUNIA.\r\n\r\n~Peck~, food; “PECK and boose,” meat and drink.—_Lincolnshire._\r\n_Ancient Cant_, PEK, meat.\r\n\r\n~Peck~, to eat voraciously. A hearty eater is generally called “a rare\r\nPECKER.” Originally PECK was to eat delicately, “but we have changed all\r\nthat now.”\r\n\r\n~Peck-alley~, the throat.\r\n\r\n~Pecker~, “keep your PECKER up,” _i.e._, don’t get down in the\r\nmouth,—literally, keep your beak or head well up, “never say die!”\r\n\r\n~Peckham~, a facetious usage of the name of this district, implying a\r\ndinner; “all holiday at PECKHAM,” _i.e._, nothing to eat.\r\n\r\n~Peckish~, hungry. _Old Cant_, PECKIDGE, meat.\r\n\r\n~Peel~, to strip, or disrobe.—_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Peeler~, a policeman; so called from Sir Robert Peel (_see_ BOBBY);\r\nproperly applied to the Irish Constabulary rather than the Metropolitan\r\nPolice, the former force having been established by Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\n~Peepers~, eyes; “painted PEEPERS,” eyes bruised or blackened from a\r\nblow.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Peery~, suspicious, or inquisitive.\r\n\r\n~Peg~, brandy and soda-water. A PEG by which to pull oneself up again.\r\nAlso, a shilling.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Peg~, “to PEG away,” to strike, run, or drive away; “PEG a hack,” to\r\ndrive a cab; “to take him down a PEG or two,” to check an arrogant or\r\nconceited person,—possibly derived from the use of PEG tankards. _See_\r\nPIN.\r\n\r\n~Peg~, to drink frequently; generally used in reference to devotees of\r\n“S. and B.”\r\n\r\n~Peggers~, people who constantly stimulate themselves by means of brandy\r\nand soda-water.\r\n\r\n~Pegtops~, the loose trousers in fashion some years back, small at the\r\nankle and swelling upwards, in imitation of the Zouave costume.\r\n\r\n~Penang-lawyer~, a long cane, sometimes carried by a footman.\r\nPENANG-LAWYERS are also bludgeons which are carried by all classes in\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n~Pencil-fever~, a supposititious disease among racehorses, the\r\npreliminary symptoms of which show that an animal has been pretty\r\nconsiderably “milked.” PENCIL-FEVER sets in when, despite the efforts of\r\nthe “marketeers,” a horse can no longer be kept at a short price in the\r\nlists, through his actual condition being discovered, and when every\r\nlayer of odds is anxious to write his name down. This disorder is also\r\ncalled “milk-fever,” “market-fever,” and other suggestive names.\r\n\r\n~Penny-a-liner~, a contributor of local news, accidents, fires, and\r\nscandals to a newspaper; a man not regularly “on the paper;” one who is\r\npopularly believed to be paid for each contribution at the rate of a\r\npenny a line, and whose interest is, therefore, that his articles should\r\nbe stuffed with fine words and long sentences. This wonderful person, to\r\nwhom so much is daily attributed, is now generally called a LINER.\r\n\r\n~Penny dreadfuls~, an expressive term for those penny publications which\r\ndepend more upon sensationalism than upon merit, artistic or literary,\r\nfor success.\r\n\r\n~Penny gaff~, a shop turned into a temporary theatre (admission one\r\npenny), at which dancing and singing take place every night. Sometimes\r\nrude pictures of the performers are arranged outside to give the front a\r\ngaudy and attractive look, and at night-time coloured lamps and\r\ntransparencies are displayed to draw an audience. Zest is given to these\r\nentertainments by the fact that now and again the police make raids upon\r\nthe houses, and carry off both actors and spectators. These places are\r\nalso called “dukeys,” for no reason that can be discovered. _See_ GAFF.\r\n\r\n~Penny starver~, a penny roll. _See_ BUSTER.\r\n\r\n~Pen’orth~, value for money; as, “I’ll have my PEN’ORTH,”—given\r\nirrespective of the actual amount.\r\n\r\n~Pensioner~, a man of the most degraded condition who lives off the\r\nmiserable earnings of a prostitute. There is an unmentionable prefix to\r\nthe word PENSIONER. _See_ PONCE.\r\n\r\n~Pepper~, to thrash, or strike.—_Pugilistic_, but used by\r\nShakspeare.—_Eastern Counties._\r\n\r\n~Pepper-boxes~, the buildings of the Royal Academy and National Gallery\r\nin Trafalgar Square. The name was first given by a wag, in allusion to\r\nthe cupolas erected by Wilkins, the architect, upon the roof, which,\r\nfrom their form and awkward appearance, at a distance suggest to the\r\nstranger the fact of their being enlarged PEPPER-BOXES. _See_ BOILERS.\r\n\r\n~Perch~, or ROOST, a resting-place; “I’m off to PERCH,” _i.e._, I am\r\ngoing to bed.\r\n\r\n    “Nor yet a single perch, for which my lucky stars to thank,\r\n    Except the _perch_ I’ve taken on this damp rheumatic bank.”\r\n\r\n        _Lay of the Unsuccessful Angler._\r\n\r\n~Perform~, to carry out a design, generally a dishonest one. To “PERFORM\r\non a flat” is to cozen a fool.\r\n\r\n~Perkin~, beer. Dandy or affected shortening of the widely-known firm,\r\nBarclay and Perkins.\r\n\r\n~Perpendicular~, a lunch taken standing-up at a tavern bar. It is usual\r\nto call it lunch, often as the PERPENDICULAR may take the place of\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n~Persuaders~, spurs.\r\n\r\n~Pesky~, an intensitive expression, implying annoyance; as, “A PESKY,\r\ntroublesome fellow.” Corruption of PESTILENT; or, _Irish_, PEASGACH,\r\nrough, rugged. PESKY has now become more American than English. _Pesky\r\nIke_ is the name of a popular American drama.\r\n\r\n~Peter~, a partridge.—_Poacher’s term._\r\n\r\n~Peter~, a bundle, or valise. Also, a cash-box.\r\n\r\n~Peter~, to run short, or give out.—_American._\r\n\r\n~Peter Funk~, an American term for a spurious auction or “knock-out.”\r\n\r\n~Peter Grievous~, a miserable, melancholy fellow; a croaker.\r\n\r\n~Petticoat~, a woman.\r\n\r\n~Pewter~, money, like “tin,” used generally to signify silver; also a\r\ntankard. “Let me have my beer in the PEWTER,” is a common request to\r\nwaiters, made by “City” men, and others who affect habits of rude\r\nhealth. The pots for which rowing men contend are often called PEWTERS.\r\n\r\n~Philadelphia-lawyer~, a Transatlantic limb of the law considered to be\r\nthe very acme of acuteness. Sailors relate many stories of his artful\r\nabilities, none, however, short enough to find a place here. The phrase,\r\n“Enough to puzzle a PHILADELPHIA-LAWYER,” means, enough to puzzle the\r\nsharpest man in the world.\r\n\r\n~Philander~, to ramble on incoherently; to write discursively and\r\nweakly.\r\n\r\n~Philip~, a policeman. The word is loudly given as a signal that the\r\npolice are approaching.\r\n\r\n~Philiper~, a thief’s accomplice, one who stands by and looks out for\r\nthe police while the others commit a robbery, and who calls out\r\n“Philip!” when any one approaches.\r\n\r\n~Philistine~, a policeman. The German students call all townspeople not\r\nof their body “Philister,” as ours say “cads.” The departing student\r\nsays, mournfully, in one of the Burschenlieder—\r\n\r\n    “Muss selber nun PHILISTER sein!”\r\n\r\n_i.e._, “I must now myself PHILISTINE be!” Also, a man who is of a set\r\nopposed to one’s own. Society is supposed to regard all outside its\r\nbounds as belonging to the PHILISTINE world. Bohemians regard all\r\ncleanly, orderly people who conform to conventionality as PHILISTINES.\r\n\r\n~Physog~, or PHIZ, the face. Swift uses the latter word. Corruption of\r\nPHYSIOGNOMY.\r\n\r\n~Picaroon~, a pirate or buccaneer originally; now an ordinary thief.\r\n\r\n~Piccadilly butchers~, a satirical name applied by the crowd to the\r\nregiment of Horse Guards, known as the “Royal Blues,” from their savage\r\nonslaught upon the crowd on the occasion of the arrest of Sir Francis\r\nBurdett at his house in Piccadilly, by order of the Speaker of the House\r\nof Commons. _See_ CHEESEMONGERS.\r\n\r\n~Piccadilly weepers~, long carefully combed-out whiskers of the\r\nDundreary fashion.\r\n\r\n~Pick~, “to PICK oneself up,” to recover after a beating or illness,\r\nsometimes varied to “PICK up one’s crumbs;” “to PICK a man up,” “to do,”\r\nor cheat him.\r\n\r\n~Pickaninny~, a young child is thus styled by the West Indian negroes.\r\nThe word is now completely naturalized among sailors and water-side\r\npeople in England.\r\n\r\n~Pickers~, the hands.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Pickle~, a miserable or comical position; “he is in a sad PICKLE,” said\r\nof any one who has fallen into the gutter, or got besmeared. “A PICKLE\r\nherring,” a comical fellow, a merry-andrew.—_Old._ Also, a mischievous\r\nboy; “what a PICKLE he is, to be sure!” Derived from his always getting\r\ninto a PICKLE, or mess.\r\n\r\n~Pickles!~ gammon; also a jeering and insulting exclamation.\r\n\r\n~Pick-me-up~, a revivifying drink taken after a debauch; a tonic.\r\n\r\n~Piece~, a contemptuous term for a woman; a strumpet.—_Shakspeare._ Not\r\nalways objectionable nowadays. A “barber’s clerk” does not object to\r\nhear his sweetheart or wife called “a nice PIECE;” and gentlemen of the\r\ncounter-jumping fraternity describe their “young ladies” as “nice PIECES\r\nof goods.”\r\n\r\n~Pieman.~ In tossing, the man who cries is called the PIEMAN. In the old\r\ndays when the itinerant PIEMAN’S duty was to toss or sell, and his call\r\nwas, “Hot pies, toss or buy, toss or buy,” he was always supposed to be\r\nentitled to the cry, the intending eater “skying the copper.” An active\r\nand efficient police have, however, improved tossing—so far, at all\r\nevents, as PIEMEN and poor people are concerned—off the face of the\r\nearth, and gaming of all descriptions is now a luxury confined to the\r\nrich.\r\n\r\n~Pig~, a mass of metal,—so called from its being poured in a fluid\r\nstate from a SOW, which _see_.—_Workman’s term._\r\n\r\n~Pig~, a policeman; an informer. The word is now almost exclusively\r\napplied by London thieves to a plain-clothes man, or a “nose.”\r\n\r\n~Pig~, a pressman in a printing office. _See_ DONKEY.\r\n\r\n~Pig~, or SOW’S BABY, a sixpence.\r\n\r\n~Pig~, to live in a crowded, filthy manner. The lower orders of Irish\r\nare said to PIG together. A suggestive, if not elegant, expression.\r\n\r\n~Pig and Tinder-box~, the vulgar rendering of the well-known tavern\r\nsign, “Elephant and Castle.”\r\n\r\n~Pigeon~, a gullible or soft person. The _French_ cant, or _Argot_, has\r\nthe word PIGEON, dupe—“PECHON, PESCHON DE RUBY, apprenti gueux, enfant\r\n(sans doute dérobé)”. The vagabonds and brigands of Spain also used the\r\nword in their _Germania_, or robbers’ language, PALOMO (PIGEON),\r\nignorant, simple. In the sporting world sharps and flats are often\r\ncalled “rooks and PIGEONS” respectively—sometimes “spiders and flies.”\r\n\r\n~Pigeon~, business, simply the Chinese pronunciation of the English\r\nword.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Pigeon-English~, the English spoken by the natives of Canton and other\r\nparts of China.\r\n\r\n~Pigeon-flying~, or BLUEY CRACKING, breaking into empty houses and\r\nstealing lead.\r\n\r\n~Pigeon’s milk~, an imaginary fluid for which boys and simpletons are\r\nfrequently sent on the 1st of April.\r\n\r\n~Pig-headed~, obstinate.\r\n\r\n~Pig’s eye~, the ace of diamonds in cards.\r\n\r\n~Pig’s whisper~, a low or inaudible whisper; also a short space of time,\r\nsynonymous with “cockstride,” _i.e._, cock’s tread.\r\n\r\n~Pike~, a turnpike; “to bilk a PIKE,” to cheat the keeper of the\r\ntoll-gate. Mr. Tony Weller makes many amusing remarks on PIKES and\r\nPIKE-keepers. Since the first edition of this work was published, PIKES\r\nand PIKE-keepers have departed from amongst us, so far as London and its\r\nimmediate vicinity are concerned.\r\n\r\n~Pike~, to run, to be off with speed.\r\n\r\n~Pike it~, is said as a hasty and contemptuous, if not angry, dismissal,\r\n“if you don’t like it, take a short stick and PIKE it.” This is but a\r\nform of the attempts at rhyming smartness common in London.\r\n\r\n    “Joe quickly his sand had sold, sir,\r\n      And Bess got a basket of rags;\r\n    Then up to St. Giles’s they roll’d, sir;\r\n      To every bunter Bess brags.\r\n    Then unto the gin-shop they PIKE IT,\r\n      And Bess was admitted, we hear;\r\n    For none of the crew dare but like it,\r\n      As Joey, her kiddy, was there,”\r\n\r\n        _The Sand-man’s Wedding_, a Cantata.\r\n\r\n    “’Twas not our fault, dear Jack; we saw the watch going into the\r\n    house the moment we came there, and we thought it proper to PIKE\r\n    OFF.”—_The Prison Breaker_, a Farce.\r\n\r\n~Pikey~, a tramp or gipsy. A PIKEY-cart is in various parts of the\r\ncountry one of those habitable vehicles suggestive of a wandering life.\r\nPossibly the term has reference to one who constantly uses the PIKE, or\r\nturnpike road.\r\n\r\n~Pile~, a sum of money; generally the whole of a man’s private means. A\r\nterm originally peculiar to Californian miners, in reference to their\r\naccumulated dust and nuggets. American gamblers speak of “putting all\r\nthe PILE on” when they fancy anything very much. “To go the whole PILE”\r\nruns level with our sporting phrase, “To go a raker.”\r\n\r\n~Pill~, a doctor.—_Military._ PILL-DRIVER, a peddling apothecary.\r\n\r\n~Pill~, to blackball a man at a club. Sometimes a man who is blackballed\r\nis described as having received too much medicine.\r\n\r\n~Pill-box~, a doctor’s carriage.\r\n\r\n~Pin~, “to put in the PIN,” to refrain from drinking. From the ancient\r\npeg tankard, which was furnished with a row of PINS, or pegs, to\r\nregulate the amount which each person was to drink. Drunken people are\r\noften requested to “put in the PIN,” from some remote connexion between\r\ntheir unsteadiness and that of a carriage wheel which has lost its\r\nlinch-PIN. The popular cry, “Put in the PIN,” can have no connexion with\r\nthe drinking PIN or peg now, whatever it may originally have had. A\r\nMERRY PIN, a roysterer. _See_ PEG.\r\n\r\n~Pinch~, to steal or cheat; also, to catch, or apprehend.\r\n\r\n~Pinchbeck~, inferior, deteriorated. Anything pretending to more than\r\nits proper value is said to be PINCHBECK.\r\n\r\n    “Where, in these PINCHBECK days, can we hope to find the old\r\n    agricultural virtue in all its purity?”—_Framley Parsonage._\r\n\r\nPINCHBECK was an inferior metal, compounded of copper and zinc, to\r\nresemble gold. It was very fashionable in the last century, and derived\r\nits name from a Mr. PINCHBECK, a well-known London tradesman, who\r\nmanufactured watches, buckles, and other articles out of it. PINCHBECK\r\nfirst obtained his notoriety by the invention of an ingenious\r\ncandle-snuffers, which the author of _The Heroic Epistle to Sir William\r\nChambers_ made the vehicle of a facetious Ode that went through eight\r\neditions. The title of this _jeu d’esprit_ ran thus:—\r\n\r\n    “_Ode to Mr. Pinchbeck, upon his Newly-invented Candle-Snuffers, by_\r\n    MALCOLM M’GREGOR, Esq., 1776.\r\n\r\n    “Illustrious PINCHBECK! condescend,\r\n    Thou well-beloved, and best king’s friend,\r\n    These lyric lines to view;\r\n    Oh, may they prompt thee, ere too late,\r\n    To snuff the candle of the State,\r\n    That burns a little blue!”\r\n\r\nPINCHBECK published a poetical reply, and the two pamphlets were for a\r\nlong time the talk of the town.\r\n\r\n~Pink~, the acme of perfection. The scarlet garb worn in the\r\nhunting-field.\r\n\r\n~Pink~, to stab, or pierce. In the days of rapier-wearing a professed\r\nduellist was said to be “a regular PINKER and driller.”\r\n\r\n~Pinnel~, or PENNEL,—corruption of penal servitude. As, “four-year\r\nPINNEL.”\r\n\r\n~Pinner-up~, a seller of old songs, pinned against a wall or framed\r\ncanvas. Formerly many of these street salesmen carried on their little\r\n“paper trade” in London. There are but one or two now left.\r\n\r\n~Pins~, legs.\r\n\r\n~Pipe~, to follow or dog a person; to watch, to notice.\r\n\r\n~Pipe~, to shed tears, or bewail; “PIPE one’s eye.”—_Sea term._\r\n\r\n    “He first began to eye his pipe.\r\n    And then to PIPE his eye.”—_Hood._\r\n\r\nMetaphor from the boatswain’s pipe, which calls to duty.\r\n\r\n~Pipe~, “to put one’s PIPE out,” to traverse his plans, “to take a rise”\r\nout of him. When any one meets with a rebuff or a sharp answer, he is\r\noften told to “put that in his PIPE and smoke it,” _i.e._, to digest it\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n~Piper~, a person employed by an omnibus proprietor to act as a spy on\r\nthe conductor.\r\n\r\n~Piper~, a broken-winded hack horse.\r\n\r\n~Pipkin~, the stomach,—properly, an earthen round-bottomed\r\npot—_Norwich._\r\n\r\n~Pips~, the marks, no matter of what suit, on playing cards. The ace is\r\noften called “single PIP.”\r\n\r\n~Pit~, a breast-pocket.\r\n\r\n~Pitch~, a fixed locality where a patterer can hold forth to a gaping\r\nmultitude for at least some few minutes continuously; “to do a PITCH in\r\nthe drag,” to perform in the street. An itinerant is said to “make a\r\nPITCH” whenever he attempts to do any business.\r\n\r\n~Pitch~, to utter base coin. Smashers are known to themselves and their\r\nfriends, the rest of the dangerous classes, as “snide PITCHERS.” The\r\nconfederacy is divided into makers, buyers, holders, and pitchers. The\r\nmaker probably never sees the actual passers of base money, the buyer\r\nbeing generally the intercommunicating medium. The holder is generally a\r\nman who carries the bulk of the “snides,” and waits about; while the\r\npitcher, often a woman—indeed, more often than not—runs the actual\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n~Pitch~, to go to bed for less than the ordinary period. Journeymen\r\nbakers, and others whose work is disjointed, call any short interval of\r\nsleep a PITCH. Probably from the action.\r\n\r\n~Pitch into~, to fight; “PITCH INTO him, Bill,” _i.e._, give him a\r\nthrashing.\r\n\r\n~Pitch the fork~, to tell a pitiful tale.\r\n\r\n~Pitch the nob~, PRICK THE GARTER, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Place~, to name the first three horses in a race. This is the duty of\r\nthe judge, who sees nothing of the race but the finish. Sometimes an\r\nofficial will place more than the first three, but this in no way\r\ninterferes with the meaning of the word as generally received. To run\r\n“nowhere” is to be unplaced.\r\n\r\n~Place~, first, second, or third position in a race. Sometimes a PLACE\r\nis called a “situation” or a “shop.”\r\n\r\n~Plant~, a dodge, a preconcerted swindle; a position in the street to\r\nsell from. All bearings-up, bonnetings, and such like arrangements, are\r\nthe results of preconcerted schemes or PLANTS.\r\n\r\n~Plant~, to mark a person out for plunder or robbery; to conceal or hide\r\nmoney, &c.—_Old Cant._ In the sense of conceal, there is a similar word\r\nin _Argot_, PLANQUER.\r\n\r\n~Plant~, a hidden store of money or variables. To “spring a PLANT” is to\r\nunearth another person’s hoard.\r\n\r\n~Platform~, a standpoint in an argument, a statement of political or\r\ngeneral opinion. “Home rule’s my PLATFORM!” Originally _American_, but\r\nnow general.\r\n\r\n~Play~, to strike for higher wages, to be out of work.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Plebs~, a term used to stigmatize a tradesman’s son at Westminster\r\nSchool. _Latin_, PLEBS, the vulgar.\r\n\r\n~Plough.~ To be PLOUGHED is to fail to pass an examination. About\r\ntwenty years ago “pluck,” the word then used, began to be superseded\r\nby PLOUGH. It is said to have arisen from a man who could not supply\r\nthe examiner with any quotation from Scripture, until at last he\r\nblurted out, “And the ploughers ploughed on my back, and made long\r\nfurrows.”—_University._\r\n\r\n~Ploughed~, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Pluck~, the heart, liver, and lungs of an animal,—all that is PLUCKED\r\naway in connexion with the windpipe, from the chest of a sheep or hog.\r\n\r\n~Pluck~, to turn back at a University examination. The supposed origin\r\nof PLUCK is, that when, on degree day, the proctor, after having read\r\nthe name of a candidate for a degree, walks down the hall and back, it\r\nis to give any creditor the opportunity of plucking his sleeve, and\r\ninforming him of the candidate’s being in debt.\r\n\r\n~Pluck~, courage, valour, stoutness. _See following._\r\n\r\n~Plucked un~, a stout or brave fellow; “he’s a rare PLUCKED UN,” _i.e._,\r\nhe dares face anything.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny PLUCKY, signifying\r\ncourageous, became a favourite term even among ladies; and the term\r\nBritish PLUCK will probably live—slangy as is its origin—as long as\r\nthe language into which it has been adopted, for the history of the\r\ndeeds with which it is associated can never die, while, indeed, a\r\nhistory remains to this country. The word met with great disfavour at\r\nfirst from the “genteel,” but of course they followed when aristocracy\r\ndeigned to use it.\r\n\r\n~Plum~, £100,000, usually applied to the dowry of a rich heiress, to a\r\nlegacy, or to a sum made in business or by a lucky speculation.\r\n\r\n~Plum-cash~, prime cost.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Plummy~, round, sleek, jolly, or fat; excellent, very good, first-rate.\r\n\r\n~Plumper~, a single vote at an election, not a “split ticket.”\r\n\r\n~Plunder~, a common word in the horse trade to express profit.

The Manchester merchants are often\r\ntermed a millocracy, and words of a similar character are mobocracy and\r\nmoneyocracy.\r\n\r\n~Pocket~, to put up with.

So called from a\r\nwell-known enthusiast of this name.\r\n\r\n~Poke~, a bag, or sack; “to buy a pig in a POKE,” to purchase anything\r\nwithout seeing it. POKE was originally a pocket. Shakspeare says—\r\n\r\n    “And then he pulled a dial from his POKE.”\r\n\r\n~Poke.~ “Come, none of your POKING fun at me,” _i.e._, you must not\r\nlaugh at me.\r\n\r\n~Poker.~ “By the holy POKER and the tumbling Tom!” an Irish oath.\r\n\r\n~Pokers~, or SILVER POKERS, the Bedels of the Vice-Chancellor, who carry\r\nsilver maces, and accompany him through the streets. They are also\r\nofficers of his court.—_University._\r\n\r\n    “Around, around, all, all around.\r\n      On seats with velvet lined,\r\n    Sat Heads of Houses in a row,\r\n      And Deans and College Dons below,\r\n    With a POKER or two behind.”\r\n\r\n        _Rime of the New-made Baccalere_, 1841.\r\n\r\n~Poky~, confined or cramped; “that corner is POKY and narrow.”\r\nHousewives describe a small uncomfortable room as “a POKY hole.”\r\n_Saxon_, POKE, a sack.\r\n\r\n~Policeman~, a fly—more especially the kind known as “blue bottle.”\r\nAlso, among the dangerous classes, a man who is unworthy of confidence,\r\na sneak or mean fellow.\r\n\r\n~Polish off~, to finish off anything quickly—a dinner, for instance;\r\nalso to finish off an adversary.—_Pugilistic._\r\n\r\n~Poll~, at Cambridge, the “ordinary degree” candidates for the B.A.\r\nExamination, who do not aspire to the “Honours” list. From the _Greek_,\r\nοἱ πόλλοι, “the many.”\r\n\r\n~Poll~, to beat or distance, as in a race; to utterly vanquish in\r\ncompetition. Term much used by printers.\r\n\r\n~Poll~, a female of unsteady character; “POLLED up,” means living with a\r\nwoman in a state of unmarried impropriety.

In\r\nuse in ancient times, _vide Hall’s Union_, 1548.\r\n\r\n~Poll parrot~, a talkative, gossiping woman. A term much used about\r\nRatcliff Highway.\r\n\r\n~Polony~, Cockney shortening and vulgar pronunciation of Bologna\r\n(sausage). The sausages which are sold under the name of POLONIES have,\r\nhowever, no nearer connexion with Bologna sausages than that of the\r\nword’s derivation.\r\n\r\n~Pompadours~, the Fifty-sixth Regiment of Foot in the British army.\r\n\r\n~Ponce~, a degraded man who lives upon a woman’s prostitution. Low-class\r\nEast-end thieves even will “draw the line” at PONCES, and object to\r\ntheir presence in the boozing-kens.\r\n\r\n~Pond~, or HERRING-POND, the sea; so called by those who were sent\r\nacross it at the national expense.\r\n\r\n~Ponge~, or PONGELOW, beer, half-and-half; the term is also used as a\r\nverb, as in the Cockney phrase, “let’s PONGELOW, shall we?”\r\n\r\n~Pony~, twenty-five pounds.—_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Poona~, a sovereign. Corruption of “pound;” or from the _Lingua\r\nFranca_.\r\n\r\n~Pop~, to pawn or pledge; “to POP up the spout,” to pledge at the\r\npawnbroker’s,—an allusion to the spout up which the brokers send the\r\nticketed articles until such times as they shall be redeemed.

Modification of “Queen’s picture.”\r\n\r\n~Posa~, a treasurer. A corruption of “purser,” the name given\r\nto the treasurer in the large Anglo-Chinese mercantile\r\nestablishments.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Posh~, a halfpenny, or trifling coin.

Probably so called because\r\nit is usual to say that a heavily-backed horse carries “a POT of money.”\r\nWhen a favourite is beaten the POT is said to be upset.\r\n\r\n~Pot~, a sixpence, _i.e._, the price of a POT or quart of half-and-half.\r\nA half-crown, in medical student slang, is a FIVE-POT piece.\r\n\r\n~Pot~, TO GO TO POT, to die; from the classic custom of putting the\r\nashes of the dead in an urn; also, to be ruined or broken up,—often\r\napplied to tradesmen who fail in business. “Go to POT!” _i.e._, go and\r\nhang yourself, shut up and be quiet.—_L’Estrange._ “To put the POT on,”\r\nto overcharge or exaggerate. “To go to POT” most probably means to go\r\nout of all shape, as metal in the melting-pot.\r\n\r\n~Pot~, to finish; “don’t POT me,” term used at billiards, when a player\r\nholes his adversary’s ball—generally considered shabby play. This word\r\nwas much used by our soldiers in the Crimea in reference to shots from a\r\nhole or ambush. These were called POT-SHOTS. The term is still used to\r\ndenote a shot taken sitting or at ease.\r\n\r\n~Pot-boiler~, a picture hurriedly painted for the purpose of “keeping\r\nthe POT BOILING.”—_Artistic slang._\r\n\r\n~Pot-faker~, a hawker of crockery and general earthenware.\r\n\r\n~Pot-hat~, a low-crowned hat, as distinguished from the soft wideawake\r\nand the stove-pipe.\r\n\r\n~Pot-hunter~, a sportsman who shoots anything he comes across, having\r\nmore regard to filling his bag than to the rules which regulate the\r\nsport. A man who fires at anything, regardless of the rules which govern\r\ntrue sportsmen.\r\n\r\n~Pot-hunter~, a man who gives his time up to rowing or punting, or\r\nany sort of match in order to win the “pewters” which are given as\r\nprizes.—_University._ The term is now much used in aquatic and athletic\r\ncircles; and is applied, in a derogatory sense, to men of good quality\r\nwho enter themselves in small races they are almost sure to win, and\r\nthus deprive the juniors of small trophies which should be above the\r\nattention of champions, though valuable to beginners. Also an unwelcome\r\nguest, who manages to be just in time for dinner.\r\n\r\n~Pot-luck~, just as it comes; to take POT-LUCK, _i.e._, one’s chance of\r\na dinner, or of what there is for dinner. A hearty term, used to signify\r\nthat whatever the pot contains the visitor is welcome to.\r\n\r\n~Pot-valiant~, courageous through application to the bottle. Possessed\r\nof Dutch courage.\r\n\r\n~Pot-walloper~, an elector in certain boroughs before the passing\r\nof the first Reform Bill, whose qualification consisted in being a\r\nhousekeeper,—to establish which it was only necessary to boil a pot\r\nwithin the limits of the borough, by the aid of any temporary erection.\r\nThis implied that he was able to provide for himself, and not\r\nnecessitated to apply for parochial relief. Honiton, Tregoney,\r\nIlchester, Old Sarum, &c., had this privilege before the passing of the\r\nfirst Reform Bill. Also, a scullion.\r\n\r\n~Potato-trap~, the mouth.—Originally a Hibernicism.\r\n\r\n~Potheen~, whisky made in an illicit still, once a favourite drink in\r\nIreland, now almost unattainable. People resident in England who read of\r\nthe charms of POTHEEN would be rather astonished if they were to taste\r\nit. It is real “fire-water” flavoured with peat-smoke.\r\n\r\n~Potted~, or POTTED OUT, cabined, confined, figurative of crammed into a\r\ngarden-pot. Also applied to burial,—a horticultural allusion.\r\n\r\n~Potter~, to meddle without much judgment. Application various. A\r\ngentleman may describe himself as “POTTERING about in his garden,” and\r\nthink the phrase pleasant. The gardener, who has to do the work all over\r\nagain, may, however, use the word in quite a different sense.\r\n\r\n~Power~, a large quantity; “a POWER of money.”—_Irish_ at first, but\r\nnow general.\r\n\r\n~Pow-wow~, a conference. Originally an Indian term.\r\n\r\n~Prad~, a horse. PRAD-NAPPING was horse-stealing. Both these terms are\r\nold cant.\r\n\r\n~Prancer~, a horse.—_Ancient Cant._ In modern slang an officer of\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\n~Praties~, potatoes.—_Irish._\r\n\r\n~Precious~, used, in a slang sense, like very or exceeding; “a PRECIOUS\r\nlittle of that,” _i.e._, a very little indeed; a PRECIOUS humbug,\r\nrascal, &c., _i.e._, an eminent one.\r\n\r\n~Pretty horsebreakers~, a phrase adopted some years back, in deference\r\nto common squeamishness, to denote the _demi-monde_, who dress so well\r\nand ride so daintily. Really, pretty heartbreakers.\r\n\r\n~Prial~, a corruption of PAIR-ROYAL, a term at the game of cribbage,\r\nmeaning three cards of a similar description. Often used metaphorically\r\nfor three persons or things of a kind. DOUBLE-PRIAL, a corruption of\r\nDOUBLE PAIR-ROYAL, means four cards, persons, or things of a similar\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n~Prick the garter~, or PITCH THE NOB, a gambling and cheating game\r\ncommon at fairs, and generally practised by thimble-riggers. It consists\r\nof a GARTER or a piece of list doubled, and then folded up tight. The\r\nbet is made upon your asserting that you can, with a pin, PRICK the\r\npoint at which the garter is doubled. The garter is then unfolded, and\r\nnine times out of ten you will find that you have been deceived, and\r\nthat one of the false folds has been pricked. The owner of the GARTER\r\nholds the ends tightly with one hand, and there is little doubt that he\r\ncan make the “flat” lose and the “bonnet” win at pleasure. This was,\r\ndoubtless, originally a gipsy game, and we are informed by Brand that it\r\nwas much practised by the gipsies in the time of Shakspeare. In those\r\ndays it was termed PRICKING AT THE BELT, or FAST AND LOOSE.\r\n\r\n~Prig~, a thief. Used by Addison in the sense of a coxcomb.—_Ancient\r\nCant_, probably from the _Saxon_, PRICC-AN, to filch, &c.—_Shakspeare._\r\nPRIG, to steal or rob. PRIGGING, thieving. In Scotland the term PRIG is\r\nused in a different sense from what it is in England. In Glasgow, or at\r\nAberdeen, “to PRIG a salmon” would be to cheapen it, or seek for an\r\nabatement in the price. A story is told of two Scotchmen, visitors to\r\nLondon, who got into sad trouble a few years ago by announcing their\r\nintention of “PRIGGING a hat” which they had espied in a fashionable\r\nmanufacturer’s window, and which one of them thought he would like to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n~Prig~, a conceited, stuck-up, over-knowing person; one who appropriates\r\nor adopts a manner or costume not suited to him.\r\n\r\n~Priggish~, conceited.\r\n\r\n~Primed~, said of a person in that state of incipient intoxication that\r\nif he took more drink it would become evident. Also, crammed for an\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n~Pro~, a professional.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Pro~, the proproctor, or second in command in the proctorial police.\r\nThe two proctors generally appoint a certain number of proproctors\r\neach.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Proctorized~, TO BE, to be stopped by the Proctor, and told to call on\r\nhim.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Prog~, meat, food, &c. Johnson calls it “a low word.” He was fond of\r\n“prog,” however.\r\n\r\n~Proof~, the best ale at Magdalen College, Oxford.\r\n\r\n~Prop~, a blow. As, “a PROP on the nose,”—more street slang than\r\npugilistic.\r\n\r\n~Prop~, a scarf pin.\r\n\r\n~Prop-nailer~, a man who “sneaks,” or rather snatches, pins from\r\ngentlemen’s scarves.\r\n\r\n~Proper~, very, exceedingly, sometimes used ironically; “you are a\r\nPROPER nice fellow,” meaning a great scamp. A “PROPER man” generally\r\nmeans a perfect man, as far as can be known.\r\n\r\n~Props~, crutches.\r\n\r\n~Props~, stage properties.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Pros~, a water-closet. Abbreviated form of πρὸς τινα τόπον. Some say,\r\nπρὸς τον τόπον.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Pross~, to break in or instruct a stage-infatuated youth. Also, to\r\nspunge upon a comrade or stranger for drink. In this latter capacity the\r\nword is in connexion with prostitute, a PROSSER being considered a most\r\ndegraded being, and the word being supposed by many to represent a man\r\nwho lives on a woman’s prostitution.\r\n\r\n~Psalm-smiter~, a “Ranter,” one who sings at a conventicle. _See_\r\nBRISKET-BEATER.\r\n\r\n~Pub~, or PUBLIC, a public-house; “what PUB do you use?” _i.e._, which\r\ninn or public-house do you frequent?\r\n\r\n~Public patterers~, swell mobsmen who pretend to be Dissenting\r\npreachers, and harangue in the open air to attract a crowd for their\r\nconfederates to rob.\r\n\r\n~Pucker~, poor or bad temper, difficulty, _déshabillé_. PUCKER UP, to\r\nget in a bad temper.\r\n\r\n~Puckering~, talking privately.\r\n\r\n~Puckerow~, to seize, to take hold of. From the _Hindostanee_,\r\nPUCKERNA.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Pudding-snammer~, one who robs a cook-shop.\r\n\r\n~Puff~, to blow up, or swell with praise; declared by a writer in the\r\n_Weekly Register_, as far back as 1732, to be illegitimate.\r\n\r\n    “PUFF has become a cant word, signifying the applause set forth by\r\n    writers, &c. to increase the reputation and sale of a book, and is\r\n    an excellent stratagem to excite the curiosity of gentle readers.”\r\n\r\nLord Bacon, however, used the word in a similar sense a century before.\r\nSheridan also seems to have remembered the use of the word, _vide_ Mr.\r\nPUFF.\r\n\r\n~Pug~, a fighting man’s idea of the contracted word to be produced from\r\npugilist.\r\n\r\n~Pull~, an advantage, or hold upon another; “I’ve the PULL over (or of)\r\nyou,” _i.e._, you are in my power—perhaps an oblique allusion to the\r\njudicial sense. See the following.\r\n\r\n~Pull~, to have one apprehended; “to be PULLED up,” or more recently “to\r\nbe PULLED” only, to be taken before a magistrate. The police are\r\nconstantly “pulling” loitering, furiously driving, or drunken cabmen.\r\n\r\n~Pull~, to drink; “come, take a PULL at it,” _i.e._, drink up.\r\n\r\n~Pull~, to prevent a horse from winning, that is, so far as the rider’s\r\naction is concerned.\r\n\r\n~Pullet~, a young girl. Filly is an exchangeable term.\r\n\r\n~Pummel~, to thrash,—from POMMEL.\r\n\r\n~Pump~, to extract information by roundabout questioning.\r\n\r\n~Pundit~, a person who assumes to be very grave and\r\nlearned.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Punkah~, a fan, usually a fan of very large size, worked with a string,\r\nand used to ventilate rooms.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Punt~, to gamble; PUNTING-SHOP, a gambling-house. Common in ancient\r\nwriters, but now disused. The word seems confined to playing for\r\n“chicken stakes.” PUNT means now in the sporting world to back horses\r\nfor small stakes.\r\n\r\n~Punter~, a small professional backer of horses.\r\n\r\n~Pup and ringer~, _i.e._, the “Dog and Bell,” the sign of a flash\r\npublic-house.\r\n\r\n~Purdah~, a curtain.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Pure finders~, street-collectors of dogs’ dung.—_Humorous._\r\n\r\n~Purl~, to spill; PURLED is a hunting and steeplechasing term synonymous\r\nwith “foaled,” or “spilt” (thrown); “he’ll get PURLED at the rails.”\r\n\r\n~Purl~, a mixture of hot ale and sugar, with wormwood infused in it, a\r\nfavourite morning drink to produce an appetite; sometimes with gin and\r\nspice added:—\r\n\r\n    “Two penn’orth o’ PURL—\r\n    Good ‘early PURL,’\r\n    ’Gin all the world\r\n    To put your hair into a curl,\r\n    When you feel yourself queer of a mornin’.”\r\n\r\n~Purler~, a heavy fall from a horse in the hunting or steeplechasing\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n~Push~, a robbery or swindle. “I’m in this PUSH,” the notice given by\r\none magsman to another that he means to “stand in.”\r\n\r\n~Push~, a crowd.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Pussey-cats~, corruption of Puseyites, a name constantly, but\r\nimproperly, given to the Tractarian party in the Church, from the Oxford\r\nRegius Professor of Hebrew, who by no means approved of the Romanizing\r\ntendencies of some of its leaders. The name still sticks, however, to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n~Put~, a game at cards, once fashionable, but now played among thieves\r\nand costermongers only.\r\n\r\n~Put~, an obsolete slang term representing the modern “bloke” or “cove.”\r\nIt was generally applied to elderly persons.\r\n\r\n~Put on~, to promise another money or valuables in the event of an\r\nanticipated success. “You’re ON a quid if Kaiser wins,” might often have\r\nbeen heard before last St. Leger. Many hangers-on of the turf live\r\nalmost entirely by what they are PUT ON, by bookmakers and backers for\r\nwhom they do odd work.\r\n\r\n~Put that in your pipe and smoke it~, said of a blow or repartee, and\r\nequivalent to take that and think over it, or digest it, or let it be a\r\nwarning to you.\r\n\r\n~Put the pot on~, to put too much money upon one horse.—_Sporting._\r\n\r\n~Put up~, to suggest, to incite, “he PUT me UP to it;” he prompted me to\r\ndo it.

To obtain full\r\nparticulars with regard to a house and its occupants, so that danger\r\nshall be reduced to a minimum, and the chances of success enlarged.\r\n\r\n~Put upon~, cheated, victimized, oppressed.\r\n\r\n~Putter up~, a man who travels about for the purpose of obtaining\r\ninformation useful to professional burglars. A man of this description\r\nwill assume many characters, sometimes ingratiating himself with the\r\nmaster of a house, sometimes with the servants, but all to one end, that\r\nof robbery. He rarely or never joins in the actual burglary, his work\r\nbeing simply to obtain full particulars as to how, when, and where, for\r\nwhich he receives his full share of the “swag.”\r\n\r\n~Puttun~, regiment.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Pyah~, weak, useless, paltry. This word, much in use among sailors, is\r\nevidently derived from the Indian term PARIAH, signifying the lowest\r\ncaste of Hindoos. Thus the Pariah dogs in India are termed PYAH dogs;\r\nand the Pariah descendants of the old Portuguese settlers are called\r\nPYAH Portuguese. Sailors term the natives of St. Helena—a\r\nwretched-looking set of individuals—PYAH Englishmen.\r\n\r\n~Pygostole~, the least irreverent of names for the peculiar M. B. coats\r\nworn by Tractarian curates:—\r\n\r\n    “It is true that the wicked make sport\r\n      Of our PYGOSTOLES, as we go by;\r\n    And one gownsman, in Trinity Court,\r\n      Went so far as to call me a ‘Guy.’”\r\n\r\n_See_ M. B.\r\n\r\n~Pyjands~, a kind of drawers or loose pantaloons.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Quad.~ _See_ QUOD.\r\n\r\n~Quaker~, a lump of excrement.\r\n\r\n~Quality~, gentry, the upper classes.\r\n\r\n~Quandary~, described in the dictionaries as a “low word,” may fittingly\r\nbe given here. It illustrates, like “hocus-pocus,” and other compound\r\ncolloquialisms, the singular origin of slang expressions. QUANDARY, a\r\ndilemma, a doubt, a difficulty, is from the French, QU’EN\r\nDIRAI-JE?—_Skinner._\r\n\r\n~Quartereen~, a farthing.—_Gibraltar term._ _Italian_, QUATTRINO.\r\n\r\n~Quaver~, a musician.\r\n\r\n~Quean~, a strumpet. In Scotland, a lower-class woman. _Saxon_, CWEAN, a\r\nbarren old cow.\r\n\r\n~Queen Bess~, the Queen of Clubs,—perhaps because that queen, history\r\nsays, was of a swarthy complexion.—_North Hants._ _See Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine for 1791_, p. 141.\r\n\r\n~Queen’s tobacco-pipe~, the kiln in which all contraband tobacco seized\r\nby the Custom-house officers is burned.\r\n\r\n~Queer~, an old cant word, once in continual use as a prefix, signifying\r\nbase, roguish, or worthless,—the opposite of RUM, which signified good\r\nand genuine. QUEER, in all probability, is immediately derived from the\r\ncant language. It has been mooted that it came into use from a _quære_\r\n(?) being set before a man’s name; but it is more than probable that it\r\nwas brought into this country, by the gipsies, from Germany, where QUER\r\nsignifies “cross” or “crooked.” At all events it is believed to have\r\nbeen first used in England as a cant word.\r\n\r\n~Queer~, “to QUEER a flat,” to puzzle or confound a “gull,” or silly\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n    “Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,\r\n      Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?\r\n    Who QUEER a flat,” &c.—_Don Juan_, xi. 19.\r\n\r\n~Queer bail~, worthless persons who for a consideration formerly stood\r\nbail for any one in court. Insolvent Jews generally performed this\r\noffice, which gave rise to the term JEW-BAIL, otherwise STRAW BAIL.\r\n\r\n~Queer-bit-makers~, coiners.\r\n\r\n~Queer cuffen~, a justice of the peace, or magistrate,—a very ancient\r\nterm, mentioned in the earliest slang dictionary. In this sense, as well\r\nas in that of the verb just given, the term is evidently derived from\r\n_quæro_, to inquire, to question. Quiz and _quis?_ have also an\r\nundoubted connexion.\r\n\r\n~Queer-soft~, bad notes.\r\n\r\n~Queer-street~, “in QUEER STREET,” in difficulty or in want.\r\n\r\n~Querier~, a chimney-sweep who calls from house to house soliciting\r\nemployment,—formerly termed KNULLER, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Qui-hi~, an English resident at Calcutta.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Quick sticks~, in a hurry, rapidly; “to cut QUICK STICKS,” to start off\r\nhurriedly, or without more ado. _See_ CUT ONE’S STICK.\r\n\r\n~Quid~, or THICK UN, a sovereign; “half a QUID,” half a sovereign;\r\nQUIDS, money generally; “QUID for a QUOD,” one good turn for another.\r\nThe word is used by old French writers:—\r\n\r\n    “Des testamens qu’on dit le maistre\r\n    De mon fait n’aura QUID ne QUOD.”\r\n\r\n        _Grand testament de Villon._\r\n\r\n~Quid~, a small piece of tobacco—one mouthful. _Quid est hoc?_ asked\r\none, tapping the swelled cheek of another; _Hoc est quid_, promptly\r\nreplied the other, exhibiting at the same time a “chaw” of the weed. CUD\r\nis probably a corruption. Derivation, _O. F._, or _Norman_, QUIDER, to\r\nruminate.\r\n\r\n~Quid-nunc~, an inquisitive person, always seeking for news.

The term would, therefore, with\r\ngreater propriety, be applied to a spy than to a solicitor.\r\n\r\n~Quiz~, a prying person, an odd fellow. Originally Oxford slang, but now\r\ngeneral, and lately admitted into some dictionaries. _See_ QUEER CUFFEN.\r\n\r\n~Quiz~, to pry, or joke; to hoax.\r\n\r\n~Quizzical~, jocose, humorous.\r\n\r\n~Quizzing-glass~, an eyeglass.

The term is used in a slang sense, to signify a\r\npseudo-politician, one whose strings of action are pulled by somebody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n~Quod~, a prison, a lock-up; QUODDED, put in prison. QUOD is really a\r\nshortening of quadrangle; so to be QUODDED is to be within four walls.\r\nThe expression is, however, seldom used now except to mean in prison. At\r\nOxford, where it is spelt QUAD, the word has its original signification.\r\n\r\n~Quodger~, a contraction, or corruption rather, of the _Latin_ law\r\nphrase, QUO JURE? by what law?—_Legal._\r\n\r\n~R. M. D.~, cash down, immediate payment. The initial letters of READY\r\nMONEY DOWN. Another version of this is P. Y. C.

C., and 6_s._ 6_d._ for the account.”\r\n\r\n~Rabbit~, when a person gets the worst of a bargain, he is said “to have\r\nbought the RABBIT.” From an old story about a man selling a cat to a\r\nforeigner for a rabbit.\r\n\r\n~Racket~, a dodge, manœuvre, exhibition; a disturbance.\r\n\r\n~Rackety~, wild or noisy.\r\n\r\n~Racks~, the bones of a dead horse.

Corrupted from RAM-SHATTER, or possibly from RANSACK.\r\n\r\n~Rancho~, originally a Spanish-American word, signifying a\r\nhunting-lodge, or cattle-station, in a wood or desert far from the\r\nhaunts of men. A hunting or fishing station in the Highlands or\r\nelsewhere. In Washington, with their accustomed ingenuity in corrupting\r\nwords and meanings, the Americans use the appellation for a place of\r\nevil report. The word is generally pronounced RANCH now.\r\n\r\n~Randals-man.~ _See_ BILLY.\r\n\r\n~Randan~, a boat impelled by three rowers, the midship man sculling, and\r\nthe bowman and strokesman rowing with oars.\r\n\r\n~Random~, three horses driven in line. _See_ TANDEM, SUDDEN DEATH,\r\nHARUM-SCARUM.\r\n\r\n~Randy~, rampant, violent, warm.—_North._ RANDY-BEGGAR, a gipsy tinker.\r\n\r\n~Rank~, to cheat.

Originally a species of counterfeit coin used for small change in\r\nIreland, against the use of which a proclamation was issued, 5th May,\r\n1737. Small copper or base metal coins are still called RAPPEN in the\r\nSwiss cantons. Irish robbers were formerly termed RAPPAREES.\r\n\r\n~Rap~, to utter rapidly and vehemently; “he RAPPED out a volley of\r\noaths.”\r\n\r\n~Rapping~, enormous; “a RAPPING big lie.”\r\n\r\n~Rapscallion~, a low tattered wretch—not worth a RAP.\r\n\r\n~Raree-show~, a collection of curiosities.\r\n\r\n~Rat~, a sneak, an informer, a turn-coat, one who changes his party for\r\ninterest.

Equivalent to “stunning.”\r\n\r\n~Rise~, “to take a RISE out of a person.” A metaphor from fly-fishing,\r\nthe silly fish RISING to be caught by an artificial fly; to mortify,\r\noutwit, or cheat him, by superior cunning.\r\n\r\n    “There is only one thing, unfortunately, of which Oxford men are\r\n    economical, and that is, their University experience. They not only\r\n    think it fair that Freshmen should go through their ordeal unaided,\r\n    but many have a sweet satisfaction in their distresses, and even\r\n    busy themselves in obtaining elevations, or, as it is vulgarly\r\n    termed, in ‘getting RISES out of them.’”—_Hints to Freshmen_,\r\n    Oxford, 1843.\r\n\r\n~Rise, or raise, a Barney~, to collect a mob; term used by patterers and\r\n“schwassle-box” (Punch and Judy) men.\r\n\r\n~Roarer~, a broken-winded horse; or, in the more polite speech of the\r\nstable, “a high blower.” ROARING, as applied to horses, is often termed\r\n“talking” by turf-men.

As the\r\noutcome of transpontine delicacy it must, however, be respected.\r\n\r\n~Rooter~, anything good, or of a prime quality; “that is a ROOTER,”\r\n_i.e._, a first-rate one of the sort.\r\n\r\n~Rope~, to lose a race of any kind purposely, to swindle one’s backers\r\nor the public by means of a “cross” or pre-arranged race, in which the\r\nbest man or best horse is made to ROPE, or run behind.\r\n\r\n~Roper~, MISTRESS, “to marry MRS.

The\r\nRose of Venus was given, says the classic legend, to Harpocrates, the\r\nGod of Silence, by Cupid, as a bribe to keep silent about the goddess’s\r\namours. It was commonly sculptured on the ceilings of banqueting rooms,\r\nas a sign that what was said in free conversation there was not\r\nafterwards to be divulged; and about 1526 was placed over the Roman\r\nconfessionals as an emblem of secrecy. The White Rose was also an emblem\r\nof the Pretender, whose health, as king, his secret adherents used to\r\ndrink “under the ROSE.”\r\n\r\n~Rosin~, beer or other drink given to musicians at a dancing party.\r\n\r\n~Rosin-the-bow~, a fiddler.

Sometimes\r\nknown as a “whacker.”\r\n\r\n~Roundabout~, a large swing with four compartments, each the size, and\r\nvery much the shape, of the body of a cart, capable of seating six or\r\neight boys and girls, erected in a high frame, and turned round by men\r\nat a windlass. Fairs and merry-makings generally abound with these\r\nswings. The frames take to pieces, and are carried in vans from fair to\r\nfair by miserable horses.\r\n\r\n~Roundem~, a button.\r\n\r\n~Row~, “the ROW,” _i.e._, Paternoster Row. The notorious Holywell Street\r\nis now called by its denizens “Bookseller’s Row.”\r\n\r\n~Row~, a noisy disturbance, tumult, or trouble. Originally Cambridge,\r\nnow universal. Seventy years ago it was written ROUE, which would almost\r\nindicate a French origin, from _roué_, a profligate or disturber of the\r\npeace.—_Vide_ George Parker’s _Life’s Painter_, 1789, p. 122. This is,\r\nhowever, very unlikely, as the derivation of the French word shows.\r\n\r\n~Rowdy~, money. In America, a ruffian, a brawler, a “rough.” Rowdyism is\r\nthe state of being of New York roughs and loafers.\r\n\r\n~Rowdy-dow~, low, vulgar “not the CHEESE,” or thing.\r\n\r\n~Rub~, a quarrel or impediment; “there’s the RUB,” _i.e._, that is the\r\ndifficulty.—_Shakspeare and L’Estrange._\r\n\r\n~Rubbed out~, dead,—a melancholy expression, of late frequently used in\r\nfashionable novels.

A faction fight.\r\n\r\n~Ruggy~, fusty, frowsy.\r\n\r\n~Rule.~ “To run the RULE over,” is, among thieves, to try all a person’s\r\npockets quietly, as done by themselves, or to search any one thoroughly,\r\nas at the police-station.\r\n\r\n~Rule the roast~, to be at the head of affairs, to be “cock of the\r\nwalk.”\r\n\r\n~Rum~, like its opposite, QUEER, was formerly a much-used prefix,\r\nsignifying fine, good, gallant, or valuable; perhaps in some\r\nway connected with ROME. Nowadays it means indifferent, bad, or\r\nquestionable, and we often hear even persons in polite society use such\r\na phrase as, “What a RUM fellow he is, to be sure,” in speaking of a man\r\nof singular habits or appearance. The term, from its frequent use, long\r\nsince claimed a place in our dictionaries; but, with the exception of\r\nJohnson, who says RUM, a cant word for a clergyman(!), no lexicographer\r\nhas deigned to notice it.\r\n\r\n    “Thus RUMLY floor’d, the kind Acestes ran,\r\n    And pitying, raised from earth the game old man.”\r\n\r\n        _Virgil’s Æneid_, book v., Translation _by Thomas Moore_.\r\n\r\n~Rum cull~, the manager of a theatre, generally the master of a\r\ntravelling troop.\r\n\r\n~Rumbler~, a four-wheeled cab. Not so common as BOUNDER. _See_ GROWLER.\r\n\r\n~Rumbowling~, anything inferior or adulterated.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Rumbumptious~, haughty, pugilistic.\r\n\r\n~Rumbustious~, or RUMBUSTICAL, pompous, haughty, boisterous, careless of\r\nthe comfort of others.\r\n\r\n~Rumgumption~, or GUMPTION, knowledge, capacity, capability,—hence,\r\nRUMGUMPTIOUS, knowing, wide-awake, forward, positive, pert, blunt.\r\n\r\n~Rum-mizzler~, Seven Dials cant for a person who is clever at making his\r\nescape, or getting out of a difficulty.\r\n\r\n~Rump~, to turn the back upon any one. A still more decided “cut direct”\r\nthan the “cold shoulder.”\r\n\r\n~Rumpus~, a noise, disturbance, a “row.”\r\n\r\n~Rum-slim~, or RUM SLING, rum punch.\r\n\r\n~Rumy~, a good woman or girl.—_Gipsy Cant._ In the Continental _Gipsy_,\r\nROMI, a woman, a wife, is the feminine of RO, a man.\r\n\r\n~Run~ (good or bad), the success or duration of a piece’s\r\nperformance.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Run~, to comprehend, &c.; “I don’t RUN to it,” _i.e._, I can’t do it, I\r\ndon’t understand; also not money enough, as, “I should like to, but it\r\nwont RUN to it.”\r\n\r\n~Run~, “to get the RUN upon any person,” to have the upper hand, or be\r\nable to laugh at him. RUN down, to abuse or backbite any one; to “lord\r\nit,” or “drive over” him. Originally stable slang.\r\n\r\n~Run for the money~, TO HAVE A, to have a start given in with a bet. As\r\n20 to 1 against Doncaster, with a RUN given. _See_ P.P. To have a RUN\r\nFOR ONE’S MONEY is also to have a good determined struggle for anything.\r\n\r\n~Run-in~, to lock up in the station-house. The police are very fond of\r\nthreatening to RUN-IN any person to whom they may take exception, and,\r\nas recent revelations have shown, are by no means averse from putting\r\ntheir threats into execution.\r\n\r\n~Running patterer~, a street seller who runs or moves briskly along,\r\ncalling aloud his wares.\r\n\r\n~Running stationer~, a hawker of books, ballads, dying speeches, and\r\nnewspapers. Persons of this class formerly used to run with newspapers,\r\nblowing a horn, when they were sometimes termed FLYING STATIONERS.\r\nNowadays, in the event of any political or social disturbance, the\r\nmiserable relics of these peripatetic newsmen bawl the heads of the\r\ntelegram or information in quiet London thoroughfares, to the\r\ndisturbance of the residents. The race is very nearly extinct, the\r\nevening-paper boys having run them to earth.\r\n\r\n~Rush~, to come upon suddenly, generally for the purpose of borrowing.\r\nTo “give a man the RUSH,” is to spunge upon him all day, and then borrow\r\nmoney at the finish, or pursue some such similar mode of procedure.\r\n\r\n~Rush~, “doing it on the RUSH,” running away, or making off.\r\n\r\n~Rust~, “to nab the RUST,” to take offence.

Corruption of RUSTICUS.\r\n\r\n~Rye.~ Gipsy term for a young man. In the same parlance “rawnie” is a\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\n~Sack~, to “get the SACK,” to be discharged by an employer. Varied in\r\nthe North of England to “get the BAG.” In London it is sometimes spoken\r\nof as “getting the EMPTY.” It is common now to speak of “getting the\r\nBULLET,” an evident play on the word discharge.\r\n\r\n~Sad dog~, a merry fellow, a joker, a “gay” or “fast” man.\r\n\r\n~Saddle~, an additional charge made by the manager to a performer upon\r\nhis benefit night.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Safe~, trusty, worthy of confidence. A SAFE card is a man who knows\r\n“what’s o’clock.” A SAFE man among betters is one who is sure to fulfil\r\nhis engagements.\r\n\r\n~Safe un~, a horse which will not run, or will not try, in a race. The\r\nbookmakers in London have the information sent them by the touts in\r\ntheir pay, and lay against the SAFE UN, who is also called a “stiff un,”\r\na “dead un,” or a “shtumer,” as often as they can, irrespective of the\r\nstate of their books. Sometimes a SAFE UN will win, owing to the owner\r\nor trainer having, for various reasons, altered his mind. Such a result\r\nthen goes to prove the “glorious uncertainty of the turf,” a phrase in\r\nvery common use among sporting writers whenever a favourite is beaten,\r\nor whenever a horse runs slow one day and loses, and very fast the next\r\nday and wins.\r\n\r\n~Sails~, nickname for the sail-maker on board ship.\r\n\r\n~St. Martin’s lace~, imitation gold lace; stage tinsel.\r\n\r\n~Saint Monday~, a holiday most religiously observed by journeymen\r\nshoemakers and other mechanics. An Irishman observed that this saint’s\r\nanniversary happened every week. In some parts of the country Monday is\r\ntermed Cobblers’ Sunday.\r\n\r\n~Sal~, a salary.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Salaam~, a compliment or salutation.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Salamander~, a street acrobat and juggler who eats fire.\r\n\r\n~Saloop~, SALEP, or SALOP, a greasy-looking beverage, formerly sold on\r\nstalls at early morning, prepared from a powder made of the root of the\r\n_Orchis mascula_, or Red-handed Orchis. Coffee-stands have superseded\r\nSALOOP stalls; but, in addition to other writers, Charles Lamb, in one\r\nof his papers, has left some account of this drinkable, which he says\r\nwas of all preparations the most grateful to the stomachs of young\r\nchimney-sweeps. The present generation has no knowledge of this drink,\r\nexcept that derived from books. The word “slops”—as applied to weak,\r\nwarm drink—is very likely derived from the Cockney pronunciation of\r\nSALOOP.\r\n\r\n~Salt~, a sailor.\r\n\r\n~Salt~, “it’s rather too SALT,” said of an extravagant hotel bill. Also,\r\na sort of black mail or tribute levied on visitors or travellers by the\r\nEton boys, at their triennial festival called the “Montem,” by ancient\r\ncustom and privileges. It is now abolished. A periodical published at\r\nEton many years ago for circulation amongst the boys was called “_The\r\nSALT-box_.” When a person about to sell a business connexion makes\r\nfictitious entries in the books of accounts, to simulate that a much\r\nmore profitable trade is carried on than there really is, he is said to\r\nSALT the books—SALTING and COOKING being somewhat similar operations.\r\nAt the gold diggings of Australia, miners sometimes SALT an unproductive\r\nhole by sprinkling a few grains of gold-dust over it, and thus obtain a\r\ngood price from a “green hand.” Unpromising speculations are frequently\r\nthus SALTED to entrap the unwary, the wildest ideas being rendered\r\npalatable _cum grano salis_. And though old birds are not readily caught\r\nby chaff, the efficacy of SALT in bird-catching, so far as the young are\r\nconcerned, is proverbial.\r\n\r\n~Salt-box~, the condemned cell in Newgate.\r\n\r\n~Salt junk~, navy salt beef. _See_ OLD HORSE.\r\n\r\n~Saltee~, a penny. Pence, &c., are thus reckoned:—\r\n\r\n ONEY SALTEE, a penny, from the _Italian_,             UNO SOLDO.\r\n DOOE SALTEE, twopence                                 DUE SOLDI.\r\n TRAY SALTEE, threepence                               TRE SOLDI.\r\n QUARTERER SALTEE, fourpence                           QUATTRO SOLDI.\r\n CHINKER SALTEE, fivepence                             CINQUE SOLDI.\r\n SAY SALTEE, sixpence                                  SEI SOLDI.\r\n SAY ONEY SALTEE, or SETTER SALTEE, sevenpence         SETTE SOLDI.\r\n SAY DOOE SALTEE, or OTTER SALTEE, eightpence          OTTO SOLDI.\r\n SAY TRAY SALTEE, or NOBBA SALTEE, ninepence           NOVE SOLDI.\r\n SAY QUARTERER SALTEE, or DACHA SALTEE, tenpence       DIECI SOLDI.\r\n SAY CHINKER SALTEE, or DACHA ONEY SALTEE, elevenpence DIECI UNO SOLDI, &c.\r\n ONEY BEONG, one shilling.\r\n A BEONG SAY SALTEE, one shilling and sixpence.\r\n DOOE BEONG SAY SALTEE, or MADZA CAROON, half-a-crown, or two\r\n shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\n⁂ This curious list of numerals in use among the London street folk is,\r\nstrange as it may seem, derived from the _Lingua Franca_, or bastard\r\n_Italian_, of the Mediterranean seaports, of which other examples may be\r\nfound in the pages of this Dictionary. SALTEE, the cant term used by the\r\ncostermongers and others for a penny, is no other than the _Italian_,\r\nSOLDO (plural, SOLDI), and the numerals—as may be seen by the _Italian_\r\nequivalents—are a tolerably close imitation of the originals. After the\r\nnumber six, a curious variation occurs, which is peculiar to the London\r\ncant, seven being reckoned as SAY ONEY, _six-one_, SAY DOOE, _six-two_\r\n= 8, and so on. DACHA is perhaps from the _Greek_ δέκα, ten, which, in\r\nthe Constantinopolitan _Lingua Franca_, is likely enough to have been\r\nsubstituted for the _Italian_. MADZA is clearly the _Italian_ MEZZA. The\r\norigin of BEONG has not yet been discovered, unless it be the _French_\r\nBIEN, the application of which to a shilling is not so evident; but\r\namongst costermongers and other street folk it is quite immaterial what\r\nforeign tongue contributes to their secret language. Providing the terms\r\nare unknown to the police and the public generally, they care not a rush\r\nwhether the polite French, the gay Spaniards, or the cloudy Germans help\r\nto swell their vocabulary. The numbers of low foreigners, however,\r\ndragging out a miserable existence in our crowded neighbourhoods, organ\r\ngrinders and image sellers, foreign seamen from the vessels in the\r\nriver, and our own connexion with Malta and the Ionian Isles, may\r\nexplain, to a certain extent, the phenomenon of these Southern phrases\r\nin the mouths of costers and tramps. Professor Ascoli, in his _Studj\r\nCritici_, absurdly enough derives these words from the ancient\r\ncommercial importance of Italian settlers in England, when they gave a\r\nname to Lombard Street!\r\n\r\n~Salve~, praise, flattery, chaff.\r\n\r\n~Sam~, _i.e._, DICKY-SAM, a native of Liverpool.\r\n\r\n~Sam~, to “stand SAM,” to pay for refreshment or drink, to stand\r\npaymaster for anything. An Americanism, originating in the letters U.S.\r\non the knapsacks of the United States’ soldiers, which letters were\r\njocularly said to be the initials of Uncle Sam (the Government), who\r\npays for all. In use in this country as early as 1827.\r\n\r\n~Sammy~, a stupid fellow.\r\n\r\n~Sampan~, a small boat.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Samshoo~, a fiery, noxious spirit, distilled from rice. Spirits\r\ngenerally.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~Samson and Abel~, a group of wrestlers in the centre of Brasenose\r\nquadrangle. Some said it represented Samson killing a Philistine; others\r\nCain killing Abel. So the matter was compromised as above.—_Oxford\r\nUniversity._\r\n\r\n~Sandwich~, a human advertising medium, placed between two boards\r\nstrapped, one on his breast the other on his shoulders. A “toad in the\r\nhole” is the term applied to the same individual when his person is\r\nconfined by a four-sided box. A gentleman with a lady on each arm is\r\nsometimes called a SANDWICH. The French phrase for this kind of\r\nSANDWICH, _l’âne à deux pannières_, is expressive.\r\n\r\n~Sanguinary James~, a raw sheep’s-head. _See_ BLOODY JEMMY.\r\n\r\n~Sank work~, tailors’ phrase for soldiers’ clothes. Perhaps from the\r\n_Norman_ SANC, blood,—in allusion either to the soldier’s calling, or\r\nthe colour of his coat.\r\n\r\n~Sap~, or SAPSCULL, a poor green simpleton, with no heart for work.\r\n\r\n~Sappy~, soft, foolish, namby-pamby, milk-and-watery. “It’s such a SAPPY\r\nbook.”\r\n\r\n~Satin~, gin; “a yard of SATIN,” a glass of gin. Term used by females on\r\nmake-believe errands, when the real object of their departure from home\r\nis to replenish the private bottle. With servants the words “tape” and\r\n“ribbon” are more common, the purchase of these feminine requirements\r\nbeing the general excuse for asking to “run out for a little while.”\r\n_See_ WHITE SATIN.\r\n\r\n~Saucebox~, a pert young person. In low life it also signifies the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n~Save~, to give part of one bet for part of another. A. and B. have\r\nbacked different horses, and they agree that in the event of either one\r\nwinning he shall give the other, say, £5. This is called “SAVING a\r\nfiver,” and generally is done when scratchings and knockings-out have\r\nleft the field so that one of the two speculators must be a winner. The\r\npractice also obtains much in competitions decided in heats or rounds,\r\nin the course of which backers and layers comparing their prospects\r\noften “SAVE a bit” with each other. Saving is, therefore, a form of\r\nhedging.\r\n\r\n~Saveloy~, a sausage of bread and chopped beef smoked, a minor kind of\r\nPOLONY, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Savvey~, to know; “do you SAVVEY that?” _Spanish_, SABE. In the nigger\r\nand _Anglo-Chinese patois_, this is SABBY, “me no SABBY.” It is a\r\ngeneral word among the lower classes all over the world. It also means\r\nacuteness or cleverness; as, “That fellow has plenty of SAVVEY.”\r\n\r\n~Saw~, a term at whist. A SAW is established when two partners\r\nalternately trump a suit, played to each other for the express purpose.\r\n\r\n~Saw your timber~, “be off!” equivalent to “cut your stick.”\r\nOccasionally varied, with mock refinement, to “amputate your mahogany.”\r\n_See_ CUT.\r\n\r\n~Sawbones~, a surgeon.\r\n\r\n~Sawney~, or SANDY, a Scotchman. Corruption of Alexander.\r\n\r\n~Sawney~, a simpleton; a gaping, awkward lout.\r\n\r\n~Sawney~, bacon. SAWNEY HUNTER, one who steals bacon.\r\n\r\n~Scab~, a worthless person.—_Old._ Shakspeare uses “scald” in a similar\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n~Scab-raiser~, a drummer in the army, so called from one of the duties\r\nformerly pertaining to that office, viz., inflicting corporal punishment\r\non the soldiers.—_Military._\r\n\r\n~Scabby neck~, a native of Denmark.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Scabby-sheep~, epithet applied by the vulgar to a person who has been\r\nin questionable society, or under unholy influence, and become tainted.\r\nAlso a mean disreputable fellow.\r\n\r\n~Scaldrum dodge~, a dodge in use among begging impostors of burning the\r\nbody with a mixture of acids and gunpowder, so as to suit the hues and\r\ncomplexions of any accident to be deplored by a confiding public.\r\n\r\n~Scaly~, shabby, or mean. Perhaps anything which betokens the presence\r\nof the “Old Serpent,” or it may be a variation of “fishy.”\r\n\r\n~Scamander~, to wander about without a settled purpose;—possibly in\r\nallusion to the winding course of the Homeric river of that name.\r\n\r\n~Scammered~, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Scamp~, a graceless fellow, a rascal; a wandering vagabond; scamping\r\nwas formerly the cant term for plundering and thieving. A ROYAL-SCAMP\r\nwas a highwayman, whilst a FOOT-SCAMP was an ordinary thief with nothing\r\nbut his legs to trust to in case of an attempt at capture. Some have\r\nderived SCAMP from _qui ex campo exit_, one who leaves the field, a\r\ndeserter.\r\n\r\n~Scamp~, to give short measure or quantity; applied to dishonest\r\ncontractors. Also to hurry through a task in a way which precludes the\r\npossibility of its being done well. Probably the same as SKIMP and\r\nSCRIMP.\r\n\r\n~Scandal-water~, tea; from old maids’ tea-parties being generally a\r\nfocus for scandal.\r\n\r\n~Scaramouch~, properly a tumbler, or SALTIMBANCO. Also a disreputable\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n~Scarborough-warning~, a warning given too late to be taken advantage\r\nof. When a person is driven over, and then told to keep out of the way,\r\nhe receives SCARBOROUGH-WARNING. Fuller says the proverb alludes to an\r\nevent which happened at that place in 1557, when Thomas Stafford seized\r\nupon Scarborough Castle before the townsmen had the least notice of his\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n~Scarce~, TO MAKE ONESELF; to be off; to decamp.\r\n\r\n~Scarlet fever~, the desire felt by young ladies to flirt with officers\r\nin preference to civilians.\r\n\r\n~Scarlet-town~, Reading, in Berkshire. As the name of this place is\r\npronounced Redding, SCARLET-TOWN is probably a rude pun upon it.\r\n\r\n~Scarper~, to run away; _Spanish_, ESCAPAR, to escape, make off;\r\n_Italian_, SCAPPARE. “SCARPER with the feeley of the donna of the\r\ncarzey,” to run away with the daughter of the landlady of the house;\r\nalmost pure _Italian_, “SCAPPARE COLLA FIGLIA DELLA DONNA DELLA\r\nCASA.”—_Seven Dials and Prison Cant_, from the _Lingua Franca_.\r\n\r\n~Schism-shop~, a Dissenters’ meeting-house.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Schofel~, bad money. _See_ SHOFUL.\r\n\r\n~School~, a knot of men or boys; generally a body of idlers or street\r\ngamblers.

Used by Dons as well as undergrads. The Dons fined or\r\nSCONCED for small offences; _e.g._, five shillings for wearing a\r\ncoloured coat in hall at dinner-time. Among undergrads a pun, or an\r\noath, or an indecent remark, was SCONCED by the head of the table. If\r\nthe offender could, however, floor the tankard of beer which he was\r\nSCONCED, he could retort on his SCONCER to the extent of twice the\r\namount he was SCONCED in.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Score~, a reckoning, “to run up a SCORE at a public-house,” to obtain\r\ncredit there until pay-day, or a fixed time, when the debt must be\r\n“wiped off.” From the old practice of scoring a tippler’s indebtedness\r\non the inside of a public-house door.\r\n\r\n~Scorf~, to eat voraciously.\r\n\r\n~Scot~, a quantity of anything, a lot, a share.—_Anglo-Saxon_, SCEAT,\r\npronounced SHOT.\r\n\r\n~Scot~, temper, or passion,—from the irascible temperament of the\r\nScotch; “Oh! what a SCOT he was in,” _i.e._, what temper he showed.\r\n\r\n~Scotch coffee~, biscuits toasted and boiled in water. A gross calumny\r\non the much-enduring Scotians; a supposed joke on their\r\nparsimony.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Scotch fiddle~, the itch; “to play the SCOTCH FIDDLE,” to work the\r\nindex finger of the right hand like a fiddlestick between the index and\r\nmiddle finger of the left. This provokes a Scotchman in the highest\r\ndegree, as it implies that he is afflicted with the itch. It is supposed\r\nthat a continuous oatmeal diet is productive of cutaneous affection.\r\n\r\n~Scotch greys~, lice. Our northern neighbours were calumniously\r\nreported, in the “good old times” of ignorance and prejudice, to be\r\npeculiarly liable to cutaneous eruptions and parasites.\r\n\r\n~Scotches~, the legs; also synonymous with notches.\r\n\r\n~Scout~, a college valet, or waiter.—_Oxford._ _See_ GYP.\r\n\r\n~Scout~, the male servant, who generally has a staircase under his\r\ncharge, and waits on the men in each set of rooms. The female servant\r\n(not unfrequently his wife or daughter) is the bedmaker.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Scrag~, the neck.—_Old Cant._ _Scotch_, CRAIG. Still used by butchers.\r\nHence, SCRAG, to hang by the neck, and SCRAGGING, an execution,—also\r\n_Old Cant_.\r\n\r\n~Scran~, pieces of meat, broken victuals. Formerly the reckoning at a\r\npublic-house. SCRANNING, or “out on the SCRAN,” begging for broken\r\nvictuals. Also, an Irish malediction of a mild sort, “Bad SCRAN to yer!”\r\n_i.e._, bad food to you.\r\n\r\n~Scran-bag~, a soldier’s haversack.—_Military Slang._\r\n\r\n~Scrap~, to fight. Also used as a substantive. Prize-fighters are often\r\nknown as SCRAPPERS.\r\n\r\n~Scrape~, a difficulty; SCRAPE, low wit for a shave.\r\n\r\n~Scrape~, cheap butter; also butter laid on bread in the thinnest\r\npossible manner, as though it had been laid on and scraped off again.\r\n“Bread and SCRAPE,” the bread and butter issued to schoolboys,—so\r\ncalled from the manner in which the butter is laid on.\r\n\r\n~Scratch~, an imaginary meeting-point in a fight, or verbal contest;\r\n“coming up to the SCRATCH,” preparing to fight—literally approaching\r\nthe line which used to be chalked on the ground to divide the ring.\r\nAccording to the rules of the prize ring, the toe should be placed at\r\nthe SCRATCH, so the phrase often is “toeing the SCRATCH.”\r\n\r\n~Scratch~, “no great SCRATCH,” of little worth.\r\n\r\n~Scratch~, to strike a horse’s name out of the list of runners in a\r\nparticular race. “Tomboy was SCRATCHED for the Derby at 10 a.m. on\r\nWednesday, from which period all bets made in reference to him are\r\nvoid.” _See_ P.P.—_Turf._ One of Boz’s characters asks whether horses\r\nare “really made more lively by being SCRATCHED.”\r\n\r\n~Scratch-race~ (on the turf), a race at which the horses run at catch\r\nweights, a race without restrictions. In boating, a race in which the\r\ncrew are picked up anyhow. A SCRATCH crew is a crew of all sorts.\r\n\r\n~Screaming~, first-rate, splendid. Believed to have been first used in\r\nthe Adelphi play-bills; “a SCREAMING farce,” one calculated to make the\r\naudience scream with laughter. Now a general expression.\r\n\r\n~Screed~, an illogical or badly-written article or paper upon any\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n~Screeve~, a letter, a begging petition.\r\n\r\n~Screeve~, to write, or devise; “to SCREEVE a fakement,” to concoct, or\r\nwrite, a begging letter, or other impostor’s document. From the\r\n_Dutch_, SCHRYVEN; _German_, SCHREIBEN, to write.\r\n\r\n~Screever~, a man who draws with coloured chalks on the pavement figures\r\nof our Saviour crowned with thorns, specimens of elaborate writing,\r\nthunderstorms, ships on fire, &c. The men who attend these pavement\r\nchalkings, and receive halfpence and sixpences from the admirers of\r\nstreet art, are not always the draughtsmen. The artist or SCREEVER\r\ndraws, perhaps, in half-a-dozen places in the course of a morning, and\r\nrents the spots out to as many cadaverous-looking men, who, when any one\r\nlooks hard at them, will commence to dabble clumsily with the short\r\npieces of chalks they always keep at hand. There are impostors of this\r\nkind in higher walks of art.\r\n\r\n~Screw~, an unsound or broken-down horse, that requires both whip and\r\nspur to get him along. So called from the screw-like manner in which his\r\nribs generally show through the skin.\r\n\r\n~Screw~, a mean or stingy person.\r\n\r\n~Screw~, salary, or wages.\r\n\r\n~Screw~, “to put on the SCREW,” to limit one’s credit, to be more exact\r\nand precise; “to put under the SCREW;” to compel, to coerce, to\r\ninfluence by strong pressure.\r\n\r\n~Screw~, a small packet of tobacco. A “twist” of the “weed.”\r\n\r\n~Screw~, a key—skeleton, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n~Screw~, a turnkey.\r\n\r\n~Screw loose.~ When friends become cold and distant towards each other,\r\nit is said there is a SCREW LOOSE betwixt them; the same phrase is also\r\nused when anything goes wrong with a person’s credit or reputation.\r\n\r\n~Screwed~, intoxicated or drunk.\r\n\r\n~Scrimmage~, or SCRUMMAGE, a disturbance or row.—_Ancient._ Probably a\r\ncorruption of SKIRMISH.\r\n\r\n~Scrimshaw.~ Anything made by sailors for themselves in their leisure\r\nhours at sea is termed SCRIMSHAW-WORK.\r\n\r\n~Scrouge~, to crowd or squeeze.—_Wiltshire._\r\n\r\n~Scruff~, the back part of the neck seized by the adversary in an\r\nencounter. “I seized him by the SCRUFF of the neck, and chucked him\r\nout.” Originally SCURF.\r\n\r\n~Scrumptious~, nice, particular, beautiful.\r\n\r\n~Scufter~, a policeman.—_North Country._\r\n\r\n~Scull~, or SKULL, the head, or master of a college.—_University_, but\r\nnearly obsolete; the gallery, however, in St. Mary’s (the Oxford\r\nUniversity church), where the “Heads of Houses” sit in solemn state, is\r\nstill nicknamed the “Golgotha” by the undergraduates.\r\n\r\n~Scurf~, a mean fellow. Literally a scurvy fellow.\r\n\r\n~Sea-connie~, the steersman of an Indian ship. By the insurance laws he\r\nmust be either a PYAH Portuguese, a European, or a Manilla man,—Lascars\r\nnot being allowed to be helmsmen.\r\n\r\n~Sea-cook~, “son of a SEA-COOK,” an opprobrious phrase used on board\r\nship, differing from “son of a gun,” which is generally used admiringly\r\nor approvingly.\r\n\r\n~Seals~, a religious slang term for converts. Also a Mormon term for\r\nwives. _See_ OWNED.\r\n\r\n~See.~ Like “go” and “do,” this useful verb has long been supplemented\r\nwith a slang or unauthorized meaning. In street parlance, “to SEE” is to\r\nknow or believe; “I don’t SEE that,” _i.e._, “I don’t put faith in what\r\nyou offer, or I know what you say to be untrue.”\r\n\r\n~See it out~, to stay out late or early, and see the gas put out. Also\r\nto complete an undertaking.\r\n\r\n~See the king.~ _See_ ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n~Seedy~, worn-out, poverty-stricken, used-up, shabby. Metaphorical\r\nexpression from the appearance of flowers when off bloom and running to\r\nSEED; hence said of one who wears clothes until they crack and become\r\nshabby. “How seedy he looks,” said of any man whose clothes are worn\r\nthreadbare, with greasy facings, and hat brightened up by perspiration\r\nand continual polishing and wetting. When a man’s coat begins to look\r\nworn-out and shabby he is said to look SEEDY and ready for cutting. This\r\nterm has been in common use for nearly two centuries, and latterly has\r\nfound its way into most dictionaries. Formerly slang, it is now a\r\nrecognised word, and one of the most expressive in the English language.\r\nThe French are always amused with it, they having no similar term.\r\n\r\n    “Oh, let my hat be e’er sae brown,\r\n      My coat be e’er sae SEEDY, O!\r\n    My whole turn-out scarce worth a crown,\r\n      Like gents well-bred, but needy, O!”\r\n\r\n        _Fisher’s Garland for 1835._\r\n\r\n~Seeley’s pigs~, blocks of iron in Government dockyards. Mr. Seeley,\r\nM.P., was the first to call attention in the House of Commons to the\r\nscandalous waste of pig-iron in the dockyards. Some of the yards were\r\nfound to be half paved with blocks of metal, which were thence called\r\n“SEELEY’S PIGS.”\r\n\r\n~Sell~, a deception, or disappointment; also a lying joke.\r\n\r\n~Sell~, to deceive, swindle, or play a practical joke upon a person. A\r\nsham is a SELL in street parlance. “SOLD again, and got the money,” a\r\npatterer cries after having successfully deceived somebody. Shakspeare\r\nuses SELLING in a similar sense, viz., blinding or deceiving.\r\n\r\n~Sensation~, a quartern of gin.\r\n\r\n~Serene~, all right; “it’s all SERENE,” a street phrase of very modern\r\nadoption, the burden of a song. SERENE, ALL SERENE! from the _Spanish_\r\nSERENO, equivalent to the English “all’s well;” a countersign of\r\nsentinels, supposed to have been acquired by some filibusters who were\r\nimprisoned in Cuba, and liberated by the intercession of the British\r\nambassador. The Sereno, the Spanish night watchman, cries out, with the\r\nhour, the state of the atmosphere. He was called the Sereno (clear),\r\nfrom his announcing the usual fine (sereno) night—quite different from\r\nthe work of our old “Charlies,” whose usual call was one of foul\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n~Serve out~, to punish, or be revenged on any one.\r\n\r\n~Setter~, sevenpence. _Italian_, SETTE. _See_ SALTEE.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Setter~, a person employed by the vendor at an auction to run the\r\nbidding up; to bid against _bona-fide_ bidders. Also the man who takes\r\nthe box at hazard, and “sets a go.”\r\n\r\n~Setting jewels~, taking the best portions of a clever book not much\r\nknown to the general public, and incorporating them quietly with a new\r\nwork by a thoroughly original author. The credit of this term belongs to\r\nMr. Charles Reade, who explained that the process is accountable for the\r\npresence of some writing by one Jonathan Swift, in a story published at\r\nChristmas, 1872, and called _The Wandering Heir_.\r\n\r\n~Settle~, to kill, ruin, or effectually quiet a person.\r\n\r\n~Settled~, transported, or sent to penal servitude for life; sometimes\r\nspoken of as WINDED-SETTLED.\r\n\r\n~Set-to~, a sparring match, a fight; “a DEAD SET” is a determined\r\nopposition in argument, or in movement.\r\n\r\n~Sevendible~, a very curious word, used only in the North of Ireland, to\r\ndenote something particularly severe, strong, or sound. It is, no doubt,\r\nderived from sevendouble—that is, sevenfold—and is applied to linen\r\ncloth, a heavy beating, a harsh reprimand, &c.\r\n\r\n~Seven-pennorth~, transportation for seven years.\r\n\r\n~Seven-sided animal~, a one-eyed man, as he has an inside, outside, left\r\nside, right side, foreside, backside, and blind side.\r\n\r\n~Seven-up~, the game of all-fours, when played for seven chalks—that\r\nis, when seven points or chalks have to be made to win the game.\r\n\r\n~Sewed-up~, done up, used up, intoxicated. _Dutch_, SEEUWT, sick.\r\n\r\n~Sewn-up~, quite worn-out, or “dead beat.”\r\n\r\n~Shack~, a “chevalier d’industrie.” A scamp, a\r\nblackguard.—_Nottingham._\r\n\r\n~Shack-per-swaw~, every one for himself,—a phrase in use amongst the\r\nlower orders at the East-end of London, derived apparently from the\r\n_French_, CHACUN POUR SOI.\r\n\r\n~Shackly~, loose, rickety.—_Devonshire._\r\n\r\n~Shady~, an expression implying decadence. On “the SHADY side of forty”\r\nimplies that a person is considerably older than forty. SHADY also means\r\ninferiority in other senses. A “shady trick” is either a shabby one,\r\nmean or trumpery, or else it is one contemptible from the want of\r\nability displayed. The SHADY side of a question is, and fairly enough\r\ntoo, that which has no brightness to recommend it.\r\n\r\n~Shake~, a disreputable man or woman.—_North._ In London a SHAKE is a\r\nprostitute.\r\n\r\n~Shake-down~, an improvised bed.\r\n\r\n~Shake-lurk~, a false paper carried by an impostor, giving an account of\r\na “dreadful shipwreck.”\r\n\r\n~Shake the elbow~, TO, a roundabout expression for dice-playing. To\r\n“crook the ELBOW” is an Americanism for “to drink.”\r\n\r\n~Shaker~, a shirt.\r\n\r\n~Shakers~, a Puritanical sect, almost peculiar to America, and not\r\nsimilar to our Quakers, as is generally believed. They have very strange\r\nnotions on things in general, and especially on marriage and the\r\nconnexion of the sexes.\r\n\r\n~Shakes~, a bad bargain is said to be “no great SHAKES;” “pretty fair\r\nSHAKES” is anything good or favourable.—_Byron._ In America, a fair\r\nSHAKE is a fair trade or a good bargain.\r\n\r\n~Shakes~, “in a brace of SHAKES,” _i.e._, in an instant.\r\n\r\n~Shakester~, or SHICKSTER, a female. Amongst costermongers this term is\r\ninvariably applied to ladies, or the wives of tradesmen, and females\r\ngenerally, of the classes immediately above them. Amongst Jews the word\r\nsignifies a woman of shady antecedents. Supposed to be derived from the\r\n_Hebrew_, SHIKTZA. It is generally pronounced “shickser.”\r\n\r\n~Shaky~, said of a person of questionable health, integrity, or\r\nsolvency; at the Universities, of one not likely to pass his\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n~Shaler~, a girl. Corrupt form of _Gaelic_, CAILLE, a young woman.\r\n\r\n~Shalley-gonahey~, a smock-frock.—_Cornish._\r\n\r\n~Shallow~, the peculiar barrow used by costermongers.\r\n\r\n~Shallow~, a weak-minded country justice of the peace.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Shallow-cove~, a begging rascal, who goes about the country half naked,\r\nwith the most limited amount of rags upon his person, wearing neither\r\nshoes, stockings, nor hat.\r\n\r\n~Shallow-mot~, a ragged woman,—the frequent companion of the\r\nSHALLOW-COVE.\r\n\r\n~Shallows~, “to go on the SHALLOWS,” to go half naked.\r\n\r\n~Sham~, contraction of champagne. In general use among the lower class\r\nof sporting men. Sometimes extended to SHAMMY.\r\n\r\n~Sham Abraham~, to feign sickness. _See_ ABRAHAM.\r\n\r\n~Shandrydan~, an old-fashioned or rickety conveyance of the “shay”\r\norder.\r\n\r\n~Shandy-gaff~, ale and gingerbeer. Origin unknown, but use very common.\r\n\r\n~Shanks~, legs.\r\n\r\n~Shanks’s mare~, “to ride SHANK’S MARE,” to go on foot.\r\n\r\n~Shant~, a pot or quart; “SHANT of bivvy,” a quart of beer.\r\n\r\n~Shanty~, a rude, temporary habitation. The word is principally employed\r\nto designate the huts inhabited by navigators, when constructing large\r\nlines of railway far distant from towns. It is derived from the _French_\r\nCHANTIER, used by the Canadians for a log hut, and has travelled from\r\nthence, by way of the United States, to England.\r\n\r\n~Shanty~, a song. A term in use among sailors. From CHANTER.\r\n\r\n~Shapes~, “to cut up” or “show SHAPES,” to exhibit pranks, or\r\nflightiness.\r\n\r\n~Shark~, a sharper, a swindler. Bow Street term in 1785, now in most\r\ndictionaries.—_Friesic_ and _Danish_, SCHURK. _See_ LAND-SHARK.\r\n\r\n~Sharp~, or SHARPER, a cunning cheat, a rogue,—the opposite of FLAT.\r\n\r\n~Sharp~, a similar expression to “TWO PUN’ TEN” (which _see_), used by\r\nassistants in shops to signify that a customer of suspected honesty is\r\namongst them. The shopman in this case would ask one of the assistants,\r\nin a voice loud enough to be generally heard, “Has Mr. SHARP come in\r\nyet?” “No,” would probably be the reply; “but he is expected every\r\nminute.” The signal is at once understood, and a general look-out kept\r\nupon the suspected party.\r\n\r\n~Sharp’s-alley blood-worms~, beef sausages and black puddings. Sharp’s\r\nAlley was, until City improvements caused it to be destroyed, a noted\r\nslaughtering-place near Smithfield.\r\n\r\n~Shave~, a false alarm, a hoax, a sell. This term was much in vogue in\r\nthe Crimea during the Russian campaign,—that is, though much used by\r\nthe military before then, the term did not, until that period, become\r\nknown to the general public.\r\n\r\n~Shave~, a narrow escape. At Cambridge, “just SHAVING through,” or\r\n“making a SHAVE,” is just escaping a “pluck” by coming out at the bottom\r\nof the list.\r\n\r\n    “My terms are anything but dear,\r\n    Then read with me, and never fear;\r\n    The examiners we’re sure to queer,\r\n    And get through, if you make a SHAVE on’t.”\r\n\r\n        _The Private Tutor._\r\n\r\n~Shave;~ “to SHAVE a customer,” charge him more for an article than the\r\nmarked price. Used in the drapery trade. When the master sees an\r\nopportunity of doing this, he strokes his chin, as a signal to his\r\nassistant who is serving the customer.\r\n\r\n~Shaver~, a sharp fellow; there are young and old SHAVERS.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Shebeen~, an unlicensed place where spirituous liquors are illegally\r\nsold. A word almost peculiar to Ireland.\r\n\r\n~Shed a tear~, to take a dram, or glass of neat spirits; jocular phrase\r\nused, with a sort of grim earnestness, by old topers to each other. “Now\r\nthen, old fellow, come and SHED A TEAR!” an invitation to take “summat\r\nshort.” The origin may have been that ardent spirits, taken neat by\r\nyounger persons, usually bring water to their eyes. With confirmed\r\ndrinkers, however, the phrase is used with an air of mingled humour and\r\nregret at their own position. A still more pathetic phrase is—“putting\r\na NAIL IN ONE’S COFFIN,” which _see_. The term SHED A TEAR is probably\r\nderived from “eye-water.”\r\n\r\n~Sheen~, bad money.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Sheeny~, a Jew. This word is used by both Jew and Gentile at the\r\nEast-end of London, and is not considered objectionable on either side.\r\n\r\n~Sheep’s eyes~, loving looks, “to make SHEEP’S EYES at a person,” to\r\ncast amorous glances towards one on the sly.\r\n\r\n    “But he, the beast, was casting SHEEP’S EYES at her\r\n      Out of his bullock head.”\r\n\r\n        _Colman, Broad Grins._\r\n\r\n~Shelf~, “on the SHELF,” not yet disposed of; young ladies are said to\r\nbe so situated when they cannot meet with husbands. “On the SHELF” also\r\nmeans pawned, or laid by in trust.\r\n\r\n~Shell out~, to pay or count out money. Also a game played on a billiard\r\ntable, a variation of pool.\r\n\r\n~Shepherd~, to look after carefully, to place under police surveillance.\r\n\r\n~Shice~, nothing; “to do anything for SHICE,” to get no payment. The\r\nterm was first used by the Jews in the last century. Grose gives the\r\nphrase CHICE-AM-A-TRICE, which has a synonymous meaning. _Spanish_,\r\nCHICO, little; _Anglo-Saxon_, CHICHE, niggardly; or perhaps connected\r\nwith the _German_, SCHEISSEN.\r\n\r\n~Shicer~, a mean man, a humbug, a “duffer,”—a worthless person, one who\r\nwill not work. This is the worst term one Jew can use to another. At the\r\ndiggings it means a hole which yields nothing.\r\n\r\n~Shickery~, shabby, bad. From SHAKY, SHAKERY.\r\n\r\n~Shickster~, a lady. _See_ SHAKESTER.\r\n\r\n~Shickster-crabs~, ladies’ shoes.—_Tramps’ term._\r\n\r\n~Shigs~, money, silver.—_East London._\r\n\r\n~Shikaree~, a hunter, a sportsman.—_Anglo-Indian._ An English sportsman\r\nwho has seen many ups and downs in jungles of the East styles himself\r\n“an OLD SHIKAREE.”—_Anglo-Indian._ Also spelt SHEKARRY.\r\n\r\n~Shilly-shally~, to trifle or fritter away time; to be irresolute.\r\nCorruption of “Shall I, shall I?”\r\n\r\n~Shin~, an Americanism for walking. “I’m tired of SHINNING around.”\r\n\r\n~Shindy~, a row, or noise. A SHINDY generally means a regular mêlée.\r\n\r\n~Shine~, a row, or disturbance.\r\n\r\n~Shine~, “to take the SHINE out of a person,” to surpass or excel him.\r\n\r\n~Shiners~, sovereigns, or money.\r\n\r\n~Shiney rag~, “to win the SHINEY RAG,” to be ruined,—said in gambling,\r\nwhen any one continues betting after “luck has set in against him.”\r\n\r\n~Shin-plaster~, a bank-note. Originally an Americanism.\r\n\r\n~Shins.~ “To break one’s SHINS,” figurative expression meaning to borrow\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n~Ship-shape~, proper, in good order; sometimes the phrase is varied to\r\n“SHIP-SHAPE and Bristol fashion.”—_Sea._ The latter portion of the\r\nexpression went out with Bristol’s fame as a seaport.\r\n\r\n~Shirty~, ill-tempered, or cross. When one person makes another in an\r\nill-humour he is said to have “got his SHIRT out.”\r\n\r\n~Shivering Jemmy~, the name given by street-folk to any cadger who\r\nexposes himself, half naked, on a cold day, to obtain alms. The “game”\r\nis unpleasant, but was, before exposure of a different kind spoilt it,\r\nexceedingly lucrative.\r\n\r\n~Shockhead~, a head of long, unkempt, and rough hair.\r\n\r\n~Shoddy~, old cloth worked up into new; made from soldiers’ and\r\npolicemen’s coats. The old cloth is pulled to pieces, the yarn\r\nunravelled and carded over again. This produces shoddy, which is very\r\nshort in the fibre, and from it are produced, on again twisting and\r\nweaving, cloth fabrics used for ladies’ mantles, &c. Also, a term of\r\nderision applied to workmen in woollen factories.—_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Shoddy~, the plutocracy created out of bogus contracts during the civil\r\nwar in the United States. The SHODDYITES enriched themselves at the\r\nexpense of their country in the most shameless manner, having most\r\nlikely studied under those contractors who should have supplied our\r\nsoldiers with necessaries during the Crimean War.\r\n\r\n~Shoe~, to free or initiate a person,—a practice common in most trades\r\nto a new-comer. The SHOEING consists in paying for beer, or other\r\nliquor, which is drunk by the older hands. The cans emptied, and the\r\nbill paid, the stranger is considered properly SHOD. SHOEING is a\r\nvariation of “paying one’s footing.”\r\n\r\n~Shoe leather!~ a thief’s warning cry when he hears footsteps. This\r\nexclamation is used in the spirit which animated the friend who, when he\r\nsuspected treachery towards Bruce at King Edward’s court, in 1306, sent\r\nhim a purse and a pair of spurs, as a sign that he should use them in\r\nmaking his escape.\r\n\r\n~Shoes~, “to die in one’s SHOES,” to be hanged. In the old hanging days\r\na highwayman would often kick off his shoes when the rope was round his\r\nneck, so as—oh, vain and impotent attempt!—to defeat the prophecy that\r\nhad foreshadowed his present position.\r\n\r\n~Shoes, children’s, to make~, to suffer oneself to be made sport of, or\r\ndepreciated. Commonly used in Norfolk.—_Cf._ Mrs. Behn’s comedy, _The\r\nRoundheads_.\r\n\r\n    _Hews._ “Who, pox! shall we stand MAKING CHILDREN’S SHOES all the\r\n    year? No: let’s begin to settle the nation, I say, and go\r\n    through-stitch with our work.”\r\n\r\n~Shoful~, a Hansom cab. This favourite carriage was the invention of a\r\nMr. Hansom, afterwards connected with the _Builder_ newspaper. It has\r\nbeen asserted that the term SHOFUL was derived from “shovel,” the\r\nearliest slang term applied to Hansoms by other cab-drivers, who\r\nconceived their shape to be after the fashion of a scoop or shovel. A\r\nlogical friend of the present Editor’s argues thus:—SHOFUL, full of\r\nshow, _ergo_, beautiful—handsome—Hansom. This is clever, but it\r\ncertainly never entered into the heads of those who gave the name of\r\nSHOFUL to the Hansom cabs.\r\n\r\n~Shoful~, bad or counterfeit money. Perhaps, as some think, from the\r\n_Danish_, SKUFFE, to shove, to deceive, cheat; _Saxon_, SCUFAN,—whence\r\nthe _English_, SHOVE. The term, however, is possibly one of the many\r\nstreet words from the _Hebrew_ (through the low Jews); SHEPHEL, in that\r\nlanguage, signifying a low or debased estate. _Chaldee_, SHAPHAL.—_See_\r\nPsalm cxxxvi. 23, “in our low estate.” A correspondent suggests a very\r\nprobable derivation, from the _German_, SCHOFEL, trash, rubbish,—the\r\n_German_ adjective, SCHOFELIG, being the nearest possible translation\r\nof our shabby. SHOFUL means anything mock, as SHOFUL jewellery. A SHOFUL\r\nis also a humbug, an impostor.\r\n\r\n~Shoful-pitcher~, a passer of bad money. SHOFUL-PITCHING, passing bad\r\nmoney. “Snide-pitcher” and “Snide-pitching” are terms exchangeable with\r\nthe preceding.\r\n\r\n~Shoful pullet~, a “gay” or unsteady woman, especially a young woman.\r\n\r\n~Sholl~, to bonnet one, or crush a person’s hat over his eyes.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Shool~, to saunter idly, to become a vagabond, to beg rather than\r\nwork.—_Smollett’s Roderick Random_, vol. i., p. 262.\r\n\r\n~Shool~, Jews’ term for their synagogue.\r\n\r\n~Shoot the cat~, to vomit. From a story of a man being sick in the back\r\nyard, and suffocating a cat and all her kittens.\r\n\r\n~Shoot the moon~, to remove furniture from a house in the night without\r\npaying the landlord.\r\n\r\n~Shop.~ In racing slang, to secure first, second, or third position in a\r\nrace, is to get a SHOP. This is also known as a place, and as a\r\nsituation. _See_ PLACE.\r\n\r\n~Shop~, a house. “How are they all at your SHOP?” is a common question\r\namong small tradesmen.\r\n\r\n~Shop~, the House of Commons. The only instance we have met with of the\r\nuse of this word in literature occurs in Mr. Trollope’s _Framley\r\nParsonage:_—\r\n\r\n    “‘If we are merely to do as we are bid, and have no voice of our\r\n    own, I don’t see what’s the good of our going to the SHOP at all,’\r\n    said Mr. Sowerby.”\r\n\r\n~Shop~, to discharge a shopman. In military slang, to SHOP an officer is\r\nto put him under arrest in the guard-room. In pugilistic slang, to\r\npunish a man severely is “to knock him all over the SHOP,” _i.e._, the\r\nring, the place in which the work is done.\r\n\r\n~Shop-bouncer~, or SHOP-LIFTER, a person generally respectably attired,\r\nwho, while being served with a small article at a shop, steals one of\r\nmore value. Shakspeare has the word LIFTER, a thief.\r\n\r\n~Shop-walker~, a person employed to walk up and down a shop, to hand\r\nseats to customers, and see that they are properly served. Contracted\r\nalso to WALKER.\r\n\r\n~Shopping~, purchasing at shops. Termed by Todd a slang word, but used\r\nby Cowper and Byron.\r\n\r\n~Shoppy~, to be full of nothing but one’s own calling or profession; “to\r\ntalk SHOP,” to converse of nothing but professional subjects.\r\n\r\n~Short~, when spirit is drunk without any admixture of water, it is said\r\nto be taken “SHORT;” “summat SHORT,” a dram. A similar phrase is used at\r\nthe counters of banks; upon presenting a cheque, the clerk asks, “How\r\nwill you take it?” _i.e._, in gold, or notes. If in notes, long or\r\nshort? Should it be desired to receive it in notes for the largest\r\npossible amount, the answer is, SHORT. A conductor of an omnibus, or any\r\nother servant, is said to be SHORT when he does not give all the money\r\nhe receives to his master.\r\n\r\n~Short~, hard-up; a polite term for impecuniosity used in clubs and\r\namong military men.\r\n\r\n~Short commons~, short allowance of food. _See_ COMMONS.\r\n\r\n~Shorter~, one who makes a dishonest profit by reducing the coin of the\r\nrealm by clipping and filing. From a crown-piece a SHORTER could gain\r\n5d. Another way was by chemical means: a guinea laid in aquafortis\r\nwould, in twelve hours, precipitate 9d.-worth of sediment; in\r\ntwenty-four, 1s. 6d.-worth.—_Rommany Rye._\r\n\r\n~Shot~, from the modern sense of the word to SHOOT,—a guess, a random\r\nconjecture; “to make a bad SHOT,” to expose one’s ignorance by making a\r\nwrong guess, or random answer, without knowing whether it is right or\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n~Shot~, from the once general, but now provincial word, to SHOOT, to\r\nsubscribe, contribute in fair proportion;—a share, from the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon_ word, SCEAT; “to pay one’s SHOT,” _i.e._, share of the\r\nreckoning, &c.\r\n\r\n    “Yet still while I have got\r\n    Enough to pay the SHOT\r\n    Of Boniface, both gruff and greedy O!”\r\n\r\n        _Fisher’s Garland_ for 1835.\r\n\r\n~Shot~, “I wish I may be SHOT, if,” &c., a common form of mild swearing.\r\n\r\n~Shot~, a term used among horse chaunters. To SHOT a horse, is to give\r\nhim a lot of small shot, which will for a short time effectually “open\r\nhis pipes,” and make him appear sound in wind.\r\n\r\n~Shot in the locker~, money in pocket, resource of any kind in\r\nstore.—_Navy._\r\n\r\n~Shoulder~, when a servant embezzles his master’s money, he is said to\r\nSHOULDER his employer.\r\n\r\n~Shout~, to pay for drink round. “It’s my SHOUT,” says he who pays.\r\nPossibly because the payer originally SHOUTED to the bar-keeper of an\r\nhotel to score the drink to him.—_Australian_, but now general.\r\n\r\n~Shove-halfpenny~, a gambling pot-house pastime, played on a table. A\r\nvery old game, originally called push-penny.\r\n\r\n~Shove in the mouth~, a glass of spirits, which is taken off quickly and\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n~Shovel~, a term applied by the vulgar crowd to the inelegant twisted\r\nhats worn by the dignitaries of the Church. Dean Alford says, “I once\r\nheard a venerable dignitary pointed out by a railway porter as “an old\r\nparty in a SHOVEL.”—_Queen’s English._\r\n\r\n~Shrimp~, a diminutive person.—_Chaucer._\r\n\r\n~Shtumer~, a horse against which money may be laid without risk. _See_\r\nSAFE UN.\r\n\r\n~Shunt~, to avoid, to turn aside from. From the railway term.\r\n\r\n~Shut of~, or SHOT OF, _i.e._, rid of. A very common expression amongst\r\nthe London lower orders. One costermonger will say to another:—“Well,\r\nIke, did yer get SHUT O’ them there gawfs [apples]?” _i.e._, did you\r\nsell them all?\r\n\r\n~Shut up!~ be quiet, don’t make a noise; to stop short, to cease in a\r\nsummary manner, to silence effectually. The following is from a literary\r\npaper:—“Only the other day we heard of a preacher who, speaking of the\r\nscene with the doctors in the Temple, remarked that the Divine disputant\r\ncompletely SHUT THEM UP!” SHUT UP, utterly exhausted, done for.\r\n\r\n~Shy~, a throw. _See_ the following:—\r\n\r\n~Shy~, to fling; COCK-SHY, a game at fairs, consisting of throwing short\r\nsticks at trinkets or cocoanuts set upon other sticks,—both name and\r\npractice derived from the old game of throwing or SHYING at live cocks.\r\nThis game is best known to the London public as “three shies a penny.”\r\n\r\n~Shy.~ “To fight SHY of a person,” to avoid his society either from\r\ndislike, fear, or other reason. SHY has also the sense of flighty,\r\nunsteady, untrustworthy.\r\n\r\n~Shy~, to stop suddenly, or turn off, as a horse does when frightened.\r\n\r\n~Shyster~, a duffer, a vagabond. Variation of “shicer.”\r\n\r\n~Sices~, or SIZES, a throw of sixes at dice.\r\n\r\n~Sick as a horse~, a popular simile,—curious, because a horse never\r\nvomits.\r\n\r\n~Sickener~, a dose too much of anything. Too much of even a good thing\r\nwill make a man sick.\r\n\r\n~Side~, an affirmative expression in the cant language of the northern\r\ntowns. “Do you stoll the gammy?” (Do you understand cant?) “SIDE, cove”\r\n(yes, mate).\r\n\r\n~Side-boards~, or STICK-UPS, shirt collars. Name applied some years ago,\r\nbefore the present style of collars came into fashion.\r\n\r\n~Sift~, to embezzle small coins, those which might pass through a\r\nsieve—as threepennies and fourpennies—and which are, therefore, not\r\nlikely to be missed.\r\n\r\n~Sight~, “to take a SIGHT at a person,” a vulgar action employed by boys\r\nand others to denote incredulity, or contempt for authority, by placing\r\nthe thumb against the nose and extending the fingers, which are agitated\r\nin token of derision.\r\n\r\n    “The sacristan he says no word that indicates a doubt,\r\n    But he puts his finger to his nose, and spreads his fingers out.”\r\n\r\n        _Nell Cook._\r\n\r\n~Silly season~, the period when nobody is supposed to be in London, when\r\nthere are no parliamentary debates to publish, and when editors are at\r\ntheir wits’-ends to fill their papers with readable matter. All kinds of\r\ncrazes on political and social subjects are then ventilated, gigantic\r\ngooseberries, monstrous births, and strange showers then become\r\nplentiful, columns are devoted to matters which would not at any other\r\ntime receive consideration, and, so far as the newspapers are concerned,\r\nsilliness is at a premium.\r\n\r\n~Silver beggar~, or LURKER, a vagabond who travels through the country\r\nwith “briefs” containing false statements of losses by fire, shipwrecks,\r\naccidents, &c. Forged documents are exhibited with signatures of\r\nmagistrates and clergymen. Accompanying these are sham subscription\r\nbooks. The former, in beggar parlance, is termed “a sham,” whilst the\r\nlatter is denominated “a delicate.”\r\n\r\n~Sim~, one of a Methodistical turn in religion; a Low Churchman;\r\noriginally a follower of the late Rev. Charles Simeon.—_Cambridge._\r\n\r\n~Simon~, a sixpenny-piece.\r\n\r\n~Simon~, or SIMPLE SIMON, a credulous, gullible person. A character in a\r\nsong, but now common.\r\n\r\n~Simon Pure~, “the real SIMON PURE,” the genuine article. Those who have\r\nwitnessed Mr. Charles Mathews’s performance in Mrs. Centlivre’s\r\nadmirable comedy of _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_, and the laughable\r\ncoolness with which he, the false SIMON PURE, assuming the Quaker dress\r\nand character of the real one, elbows that worthy out of his expected\r\nentertainment, will at once perceive the origin of this phrase.—_See_\r\nact v. scene i.\r\n\r\n~Simpkin~, or SIMKIN, champagne.—_Anglo-Indian._ Derived from the\r\nmanner in which native servants pronounce champagne.\r\n\r\n~Simpson~, water used in the dilution of milk. Term in use among\r\ncow-keepers. From this the parish pump has been called Mrs. SIMPSON.\r\n\r\n~Sing out~, to call aloud.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Sing small~, to lessen one’s boasting, and turn arrogance into\r\nhumility.\r\n\r\n~Sing-song~, a harmonic meeting at a pot-house, a free-and-easy.\r\n\r\n~Sinkers~, bad money,—affording a man but little assistance in “keeping\r\nafloat.”\r\n\r\n~Sinks~, a throw of fives at dice. _French_, CINQ.\r\n\r\n~Si quis~, a candidate for “orders.” From the notification commencing SI\r\nQUIS—if any one.\r\n\r\n~Sir Harry~, a close stool.\r\n\r\n~Sir Reverence~, a corruption of the old phrase, SAVE YOUR REVERENCE, a\r\nsort of apology for alluding to anything likely to shock one’s sense of\r\ndecency. _Latin_, SALVÂ REVERENTIÂ. _See_ Shakspeare’s _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_, act i. scene iv. From this it came to mean the thing\r\nitself—human ordure generally, but sometimes other indecencies.\r\n\r\n~Siserara~, a hard blow.—_Suffolk._ Many derive this term from the\r\nstory of Sisera in the Old Testament, but it is probably a corruption of\r\nCERTIORARI, a Chancery writ reciting a complaint of hard usage.\r\n\r\n~Sit under~, a term employed in Dissenters’ meeting-houses, to denote\r\nattendance on the ministry of any particular preacher.\r\n\r\n~Sit upon~, to overcome or rebuke, to express contempt for a man in a\r\nmarked manner. Also, to chaff or “roast” a man consumedly.\r\n\r\n~Sit-upons~, trousers. _See_ INEXPRESSIBLES.\r\n\r\n~Sivvy~, “’pon my SIVVY,” _i.e._, upon my soul or honour. Corruption of\r\n“asseveration,” like DAVY, which is an abridgment of “affidavit.”\r\n\r\n~Sixes and sevens~, articles in confusion are said to be all SIXES AND\r\nSEVENS. The Deity is mentioned in the _Towneley Mysteries_ as He that\r\n“set all on seven,” _i.e._, set or appointed everything in seven days. A\r\nsimilar phrase at this early date implied confusion and disorder, and\r\nfrom these, Halliwell thinks, has been derived the phrase “to be at\r\nSIXES AND SEVENS.” A Scotch correspondent, however, states that the\r\nphrase probably came from the workshop, and that amongst needle-makers,\r\nwhen the points and eyes are “heads and tails” (“heeds and thraws”), or\r\nin confusion, they are said to be SIXES AND SEVENS, because those\r\nnumbers are the sizes most generally used, and in the course of\r\nmanufacture have frequently to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n~Sixty~, “to go along like SIXTY,” _i.e._, at a good rate, briskly.\r\n\r\n~Sixty-per-cent~, a bill-discounter. From the rate of interest generally\r\ncharged. If bill-discounters profess to do the business for less, they\r\ngenerally make up the level sixty by extras.\r\n\r\n~Six-water grog~, a sea-term for the weakest grog possible—six portions\r\nof water to one of rum—hardly enough spirit to “swear by.”\r\n\r\n~Size~, to order extras over and above the usual commons at the dinner\r\nin college halls. Soup, pastry, &c., are SIZINGS, and are paid for at\r\na certain specified rate per SIZE, or portion, to the college cook.\r\nPeculiar to Cambridge. Minsheu says, “SIZE, a farthing which schollers\r\nin Cambridge have at the buttery, noted with the letter _s_.”\r\n\r\n~Sizers~, or SIZARS, certain poor scholars at Cambridge, annually\r\nelected, who got their dinners (including “sizings”) from what was left\r\nat the upper, or Fellows’ table, free, or nearly so. They paid rent of\r\nrooms, and some other fees, on a lower scale than the “Pensioners” or\r\nordinary students, and were equal with the “battlers” and “servitors” at\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n~Sizings.~ _See_ SIZE.\r\n\r\n~Skedaddle~, to go off in a hurry. The American war introduced this new\r\nand amusing word. A Northerner who retreated “retired upon his\r\nsupports,” but a Southerner was said to SKEDADDLE. The _Times_ remarked\r\non the word, and Lord Hill wrote to prove that it was excellent Scotch.\r\nThe Americans only misapply the word, which means, in Dumfries, “to\r\nspill”—milkmaids, for example, saying, “You are SKEDADDLING all that\r\nmilk.” The Yankees therefore adopted the term, and altered the\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n~Skid~, a sovereign. Fashionable slang. Occasionally SKIV.\r\n\r\n~Skid~, or SKIDPAN, an instrument for locking the wheel of a coach when\r\ngoing down hill. It is often said that a talkative person might put the\r\nSKID on, with advantage to his listeners, if not to himself.\r\n\r\n~Skied~, or SKYED, thrown upwards, as “coppers” in tossing.\r\n\r\n~Skied.~ Artists say that a picture is SKIED when it is hung on the\r\nupper line at the Exhibition of the Royal Academy. _See_ FLOORED.\r\n\r\n~Skilligolee~, prison gruel. Also sailors’ soup of many ingredients. The\r\nterm is occasionally used in London workhouses.\r\n\r\n~Skilly~, abbreviation of SKILLIGOLEE.\r\n\r\n~Skimmery~, St. Mary Hall, Oxford.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Skin~, a purse. This term is mostly in use among thieves.\r\n\r\n~Skin~, to abate, or lower the value of anything; “thin-SKINNED,”\r\nsensitive, touchy, liable to be “raw” on certain subjects.\r\n\r\n~Skin-the-lamb~, a game at cards, a very expressive corruption of the\r\nterm “lansquenet,” also a racing term. When a non-favourite wins a race,\r\nbookmakers are said to SKIN THE LAMB, under the supposition that they\r\nwin all their bets, no person having backed the winner. This has been\r\ncorrupted into SKINNER.\r\n\r\n~Skinflint~, an old and popular simile for a “close-fisted,” stingy\r\nperson. Sternberg, in his _Northamptonshire Glossary_, says the Eastern\r\nlanguages have the same expression. Abdul-Malek, one of the Ommeyade\r\nKhaliphs, noted for his extreme avarice, was surnamed Raschal-Hegiarah,\r\nliterally, “the SKINNER of a FLINT.”\r\n\r\n~Skinner~, a term among bookmakers. “May we have a SKINNER,” _i.e._, may\r\nwe SKIN THE LAMB, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Skipper~, the master of a vessel. _Germ._, SCHIFFER, from SCHIFF, a\r\nship; sometimes used as synonymous with “governor.”\r\n\r\n~Skipper~, a barn.—_Ancient Cant._ From the _Welsh_, YSGUBOR,\r\npronounced SCYBOR, or SCIBOR, the proper word in that language for a\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\n~Skipper-birds~, or KEYHOLE-WHISTLERS, persons who sleep in barns or\r\nouthouses from necessity or in preference to sleeping in lodging-houses.\r\n\r\n~Skipper-it~, to sleep in the open air, or in a rough way.\r\n\r\n~Skit~, a joke, a squib. Term generally used in reference to any pungent\r\nor pointed political allusion.\r\n\r\n~Skittles~, a game similar to that of Ten Pins, which, when interdicted\r\nby the Government, was altered to Nine Pins, or SKITTLES. The pins are\r\nset up in an alley, and thrown (not bowled) at with a round piece of\r\nhard wood, shaped like a small flat cheese. The costers used to consider\r\nthemselves the best players in London, but they have been frequently\r\nundeceived. SKITTLES has within the past few years received an awful\r\nblow—quite a floorer—from “the powers that be.”\r\n\r\n~Skow-banker~, a fellow who loiters about the premises of any one\r\nwilling to support him, and who objects to the necessity of working for\r\nhis living; a rogue, a rascal. Common in Melbourne, Australia.\r\n\r\n~Skrouge~, to push or squeeze.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Skull-thatcher~, a straw-bonnet-maker,—sometimes called “a\r\nbonnet-BUILDER.”\r\n\r\n~Skunk~, a mean or paltry fellow, one whose name stinks.\r\n\r\n~Sky~, a disagreeable person, an enemy.—_Westminster School._ The word\r\nderived its origin from a corruption of the last syllable of the word\r\n“VOLSCI:” Westminster boys being of course understood to be the Romans.\r\n\r\n~Sky~, to toss up towards the SKY. Term used in tossing with halfpence;\r\n“It’s all right, Jim SKIED the browns,” _i.e._, threw them up, a proof\r\nthat there could have been no collusion or cheating.\r\n\r\n~Sky-blue~, London milk much diluted with water, or from which the cream\r\nhas been too closely skimmed.\r\n\r\n    “Hence, Suffolk dairy wives run mad for cream,\r\n    And leave their milk with nothing but the name;\r\n    Its name derision and reproach pursue,\r\n    And strangers tell of three-times-skimm’d—SKY-BLUE.”\r\n\r\n        _Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy._\r\n\r\nThe recent Adulteration Act has done away with SKY-BLUE, and made\r\nSimpson a relic of the past. SKY-BLUE formerly meant gin.\r\n\r\n~Sky-lark.~ _See under_ LARK.\r\n\r\n~Sky-parlour~, the garret.\r\n\r\n~Sky-scraper~, a tall man; “Are you cold up there, old SKY-SCRAPER?”\r\nProperly a sea-term. The light sails, which some adventurous skippers\r\nset above the royals in calm latitudes, are termed SKY-SCRAPERS and\r\nMOON-RAKERS.\r\n\r\n~Sky-wannocking~, unsteady frolicking.—_Norfolk._\r\n\r\n~Slab~, thick, as gruel, porridge, &c.\r\n\r\n~Slack~, “to hold on the SLACK,” to skulk; a slack rope not requiring to\r\nbe held.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Slam~, a term at the game of whist. When two partners gain the whole\r\nthirteen tricks, they win a SLAM, which is considered equal to a\r\nrubber.\r\n\r\n~Slam~, to talk fluently. “He’s the bloke to SLAM.” From a term in use\r\namong birdsingers at the East-end, by which they denote a certain style\r\nof note in chaffinches.\r\n\r\n~Slammock~, a slattern or awkward person.—_West_, and _Norfolk_.\r\n\r\n~Slang~, low, vulgar, unwritten, or unauthorized language. _Gipsy_,\r\nSLANG, the secret language of the gipsies, synonymous with GIBBERISH,\r\nanother gipsy word. The word is only to be found in the dictionaries of\r\nWebster and Ogilvie. It is given, however, by Grose, in his _Dictionary\r\nof the Vulgar Tongue_, 1785. SLANG, since it has been adopted as an\r\nEnglish word, generally implies vulgar language not known or recognised\r\nas CANT; and latterly, when applied to speech, it has superseded the\r\nword FLASH. Latterly, however, SLANG has become the generic term for all\r\nunauthorized language. The earliest instance of the use of the word that\r\ncan be found, is the following:—\r\n\r\n    “Let proper nurses be assigned, to take care of these babes of\r\n    grace, [young thieves].... The master who teaches them should be a\r\n    man well versed in the cant language commonly called the SLANG\r\n    patter, in which they should by all means excel.”—_Jonathan Wild’s\r\n    Advice to his Successor._ LONDON, _J. Scott_, 1758.\r\n\r\n~Slang~, a travelling show.\r\n\r\n~Slang~, to cheat, to abuse in foul language.\r\n\r\n~Slang~, counterfeit or short weights and measures. A SLANG quart is a\r\npint and a half.

SUPER and SLANG, a watch and chain.\r\n\r\n~Slang~, “out on the SLANG,” _i.e._, to travel with a hawker’s licence.\r\n\r\n~Slang-whanger~, a long-winded speaker.—_Parliamentary._\r\n\r\n~Slangy~, flashy, vulgar; loud in dress, manner, and conversation.\r\n\r\n~Slantingdicular~, oblique, awry,—as opposed to PERPENDICULAR.\r\nOriginally an Americanism, now a part of the vocabulary of London “high\r\nlife below stairs.”\r\n\r\n~Slap~, paint for the face, rouge.\r\n\r\n~Slap~, exactly, precisely; “SLAP in the wind’s eye,” _i.e._, exactly to\r\nwindward.\r\n\r\n~Slap-bang~, suddenly, violently. From the strike of a ball being felt\r\nbefore the report reaches the ear,—the SLAP first, the BANG afterwards.\r\n\r\n~Slap-bang-shops~, originally low eating-houses where the ready-money\r\nwas paid down with a SLAP-BANG.—_Grose._ A SLAP-BANG-SHOP is now a very\r\npretentious eating-house.\r\n\r\n~Slap-dash~, immediately, or quickly; at a great rate.\r\n\r\n~Slap-up~, first-rate, excellent, very good.\r\n\r\n~Slasher~, a powerful roysterer, a game and clever pugilist.\r\n\r\n~Slashers~, the Twenty-eighth Regiment of Foot in the British army.\r\n\r\n~Slate~, “he has a SLATE loose,” _i.e._, he is slightly crazy.\r\n\r\n~Slate~, to pelt with abuse, to beat, to “lick;” or, in the language of\r\nthe reviewers, to “cut up.” Also, among bettors, to lay heavily against\r\na particular man or animal in a race.\r\n\r\n~Slate~, to knock the hat over one’s eyes, to bonnet.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Slavey~, a maid-servant.\r\n\r\n~Slawmineyeux~, a Dutchman. Probably a corruption of the Dutch, _ja,\r\nmynheer_; or German, _ja, mein Herr_.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Sleepless-hats~, those of a napless character, better known as\r\nWIDE-AWAKES.\r\n\r\n~Slender~, a simple country gentleman.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Slewed~, drunk, or intoxicated.—_Sea term._ When a vessel changes the\r\ntack, she, as it were, staggers, the sails flap, she gradually heels\r\nover, and the wind catching the waiting canvas, she glides off at\r\nanother angle. The course pursued by an intoxicated, or SLEWED, man, is\r\nsupposed to be analogous to that of the ship.\r\n\r\n~Slick~, an Americanism, very prevalent in England since the publication\r\nof Judge Haliburton’s facetious stories, which means rapidly,\r\neffectually, utterly.\r\n\r\n~Slick~, smooth, unctuous; abbreviation of sleek.\r\n\r\n~Sling~, a drink peculiar to Americans, generally composed of gin,\r\nsoda-water, ice, and slices of lemon. At some houses in London\r\nGIN-SLINGS may be obtained.\r\n\r\n~Sling~, to pass from one person to another. To blow the nose with the\r\nnaked fingers.\r\n\r\n~Sling your hook~, a polite invitation to move-on. “Sling your Daniel”\r\nhas the same meaning. The pronouns may be altered to suit the context.\r\n\r\n~Slip~, “to give the SLIP,” to run away, or elude pursuit. Shakspeare\r\nhas, “You gave me the counterfeit,” in _Romeo and Juliet_. Giving the\r\nSLIP, however, is a sea phrase, and refers to fastening an anchor and\r\nchain cable to a floating buoy, or water-cask, until a time arrives when\r\nit is convenient to return and take them on board. In fastening the\r\ncable, the home end is SLIPPED through the hawse-pipe. Weighing anchor\r\nis a noisy task, so that giving the SLIP infers leaving quietly.\r\n\r\n~Slip~, or let SLIP; “to SLIP into a man,” to give him a sound beating,\r\n“to let SLIP at a cove,” to rush violently upon him, and assault with\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\n~Slipping~, a trick of card-sharpers, in the performance of which, by\r\ndexterous manipulation, they place the cut card on the top, instead of\r\nat the bottom of the pack. It is the _faire sauter la coupe_ of the\r\nFrench. In pugilistic parlance, “to SLIP a man,” is to “duck and get\r\naway” with great dexterity.\r\n\r\n~Slips~, the sides of the gallery in a theatre are generally so called.\r\n\r\n~Slog~, to beat or baste, to fight. _German_, SCHLACHTEN; or perhaps\r\nfrom some connexion with the _Gaelic_ SLOGAN. The pretended _Greek_\r\nderivation from σλογω is humbug, there being no such word in the\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n~Slogdollager~, an Americanism, meaning the same as our STOCKDOLLAGER,\r\nwhich _see_.\r\n\r\n~Sloggers~, _i.e._, SLOW-GOERS, the second division of race-boats at\r\nCambridge. At Oxford they are called TORPIDS.—_University._ A hard\r\nhitter at cricket is termed a SLOGGER; so is a pugilist.\r\n\r\n~Slogging~, a good beating.\r\n\r\n~Slop~, a policeman. At first back slang, but now modified for general\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n~Slop~, cheap, or ready-made, as applied to clothing, is generally\r\nsupposed to be a modern appropriation; but it was used in this sense in\r\n1691, by Maydman, in his _Naval Speculations_; and by Chaucer two\r\ncenturies before that. SLOPS properly signify sailors’ working clothes,\r\nwhich are of a very cheap and inexpensive character.\r\n\r\n~Slope~, to decamp, to run, or rather slip away. Some persons think it\r\ncame originally from LOPE, to make off; and that the _s_ probably became\r\naffixed as a portion of the preceding word, as in the case of “Let’s\r\nlope,” let us run. It is purely an Americanism, and is possibly but an\r\nemendation of our own word elope. Lope, leap, and elope are kindred. A\r\nhumorous correspondent says that Tennyson is decidedly partial to slang,\r\nand instances amongst other proofs a passage from the laureate’s famous\r\n_Locksley Hall_:—\r\n\r\n    “Many a night, from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,\r\n    Did I look on great Orion SLOPING slowly to the west.”\r\n\r\nThough this correspondent may not have intended it, his joke has given\r\nthe key to the situation, and has shown how our cousins most probably\r\ncame to use the word in its present sense. “The sun is SLOPING fast.”\r\n\r\n~Slops~, any weak, wet, and warm mixture. Hard drinkers regard all\r\neffeminate beverages as SLOPS.\r\n\r\n~Slops~, chests or packages of tea; “he shook a slum of SLOPS,” _i.e._,\r\nstole a chest of tea. Also ready-made clothes—the substantive of SLOP.\r\n\r\n~Slops~, liquid house-refuse.\r\n\r\n~Slopshop~, a tailor’s shop where inferior work is done, and where cheap\r\ngoods are sold.\r\n\r\n~Slour~, to lock, or fasten.—_Prison Cant._\r\n\r\n~Sloured~, buttoned up; SLOURED HOXTER, an inside pocket buttoned up.\r\n\r\n~Slowcoach~, a lumbering, dull person; one slow of comprehension.\r\n\r\n~Slowed~, to be locked up (in prison).\r\n\r\n~Slubberdegullion~, a paltry, dirty, sorry wretch.\r\n\r\n    “Quoth she, although thou hast deserved,\r\n    Base SLUBBERDEGULLION, to be served\r\n    As thou didst vow to deal with me,\r\n    If thou hadst got the victory”----\r\n\r\n        _Hudibras._\r\n\r\n~Sluicery~, a gin-shop or public-house.\r\n\r\n~Sluicing one’s bolt~, drinking.\r\n\r\n~Slum~, a chest, or package. _See_ SLOPS.\r\n\r\n~Slum~, a letter.—_Prison Cant._\r\n\r\n~Slum~, an insinuation, a discreditable innuendo.\r\n\r\n~Slum~, gammon, “up to SLUM,” wide awake, knowing.\r\n\r\n    “And this, without more SLUM began,\r\n    Over a flowing pot-house can,\r\n    To settle, without botheration,\r\n    The rigs of this here tip-top nation.”\r\n\r\n        _Jack Randall’s Diary_, 1820.\r\n\r\n~Slum~, or BACK SLUM, a dark retreat, a low neighbourhood; as\r\nWestminster and East-end SLUMS, favourite haunts for thieves.\r\n\r\n~Slum~, to hide, to pass to a confederate.\r\n\r\n~Slum~, to saunter about, with a suspicion, perhaps, of immoral\r\npursuits.—_Cambridge University Slang_.\r\n\r\n~Slum the gorger~, to cheat on the sly, to be an eye-servant. SLUM in\r\nthis sense is old cant.\r\n\r\n~Slumgullion~, any cheap, nasty, washy beverage. An Americanism best\r\nknown in the Pacific States.\r\n\r\n~Slumming~, passing bad money.\r\n\r\n~Slush~, the grease obtained from boiling the salt pork eaten by seamen,\r\nand generally the cook’s perquisite.\r\n\r\n~Slushy~, a ship’s cook.\r\n\r\n~Sluter~, butter.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Smack smooth~, even, level with the surface, quickly.\r\n\r\n~Small-beer;~ “he doesn’t think SMALL-BEER of himself,” _i.e._, he has a\r\ngreat opinion of his own importance. SMALL COALS is also used in the\r\nsame sense.\r\n\r\n~Small hours~, the early hours after midnight.\r\n\r\n~Small potatoes~, a term of contempt. “He’s very SMALL POTATOES,” he’s a\r\nnobody. Yet no one thinks of calling an important personage “large\r\nPOTATOES.”\r\n\r\n~Smalls~, a University term for the first general examination of the\r\nstudent.

From the peculiar dense cloud which overhangs London.\r\nThe metropolis is by no means so smoky as Sheffield, Birmingham, &c.;\r\nyet country-people, when going to London, frequently say they are on\r\ntheir way to the SMOKE; and Londoners, when leaving for the country, say\r\nthey are going out of the SMOKE.\r\n\r\n~Smoke~, to detect, or penetrate an artifice. Originally used by London\r\ndetectives, probably on account of their clouded intellects.\r\n\r\n~Smudge~, to smear, obliterate, daub.

Also a mild form of\r\nswearing,—“I’m SNIGGERED if you will.” Another form of this latter is\r\nJIGGERED.\r\n\r\n~Sniggering~, laughing to oneself.—_East._\r\n\r\n~Snip~, a tailor,—apparently from SNIPES, a pair of scissors, or from\r\nthe snipping sound made by scissors in cutting up anything.\r\n\r\n~Snipe~, a long bill or account; also a term for attorneys,—a race with\r\na remarkable propensity for long bills.\r\n\r\n~Snipes~, “a pair of SNIPES,” a pair of scissors.

In\r\n_Scotland_, SNITCHERS signify handcuffs.\r\n\r\n~Snob~, a low, vulgar, or affected person. Supposed to be from the\r\nnickname usually applied to a cobbler or maker of shoes; but believed\r\nby many in its later sense to be a contraction of the _Latin_, SINE\r\nOBOLO. Others go to work for an etymology thus:—They assume that NOBS,\r\n_i.e._, _nobiles_, was appended in lists to the names of persons of\r\ngentle birth, whilst those who had not that distinction were marked down\r\nas S NOB, _i.e._, _sine nobilitate_, without marks of gentility,—thus,\r\nby a simple transposition, quite reversing the meaning. Others, again,\r\nremark that, as at college sons of noblemen wrote after their names in\r\nthe admission lists, _fil. nob._, son of a lord, and hence all young\r\nnoblemen were called NOBS, and what they did NOBBY, so those who\r\nimitated them would be called _quasi-nobs_, “like a nob,” which by a\r\nprocess of contraction would be shortened to _si-nob_, and then SNOB,\r\none who pretends to be what he is not, and apes his betters. The short\r\nand expressive terms which many think fitly represent the three great\r\nestates of the realm—NOB, SNOB, and MOB—were all originally slang\r\nwords. The last has safely passed through the vulgar ordeal of the\r\nstreets, and found respectable quarters in the standard dictionaries.\r\nFor fuller particulars of the genus SNOB, in all its ramifications, the\r\nreader cannot do better than apply to the general works of that great\r\nmaster of the subject, William Makepeace Thackeray, though it may be as\r\nwell to remark that the SNOB for whom the novelist had such an aversion\r\nis now very widely known as “cad.”\r\n\r\n~Snobbish~, stuck up, proud, make-believe.\r\n\r\n~Snob-Stick~, a workman who refuses to join in strikes, or trade-unions.\r\nAmplification of KNOB-STICK.\r\n\r\n~Snooks~, an imaginary personage often brought forward as the answer to\r\nan idle question, or as the perpetrator of a senseless joke. Said to be\r\nsimply a shortening or abbreviation of “Sevenoaks,” the Kentish village.\r\n\r\n~Snooze~, or SNOODGE (vulgar pronunciation), to sleep or doze.\r\n\r\n~Snooze-case~, a pillow-slip.\r\n\r\n~Snorter~, a blow on the nose. A hurry is sometimes called a “reg’lar\r\nSNORTER.”\r\n\r\n~Snot~, a term of reproach applied to persons by the vulgar when vexed\r\nor annoyed, meaning really a person of the vilest description and\r\nmeanest capacity. In a Westminster school vocabulary for boys, published\r\nin the last century, the term is curiously applied. Its proper meaning\r\nis the glandular mucus discharged through the nose.\r\n\r\n~Snot~, a small bream, a slimy kind of flat fish.—_Norwich._\r\n\r\n~Snotter~, or WIPE-HAULER, a pickpocket whose chief fancy is for\r\ngentlemen’s pocket-handkerchiefs.—_North._\r\n\r\n~Snottinger~, a coarse word for a pocket-handkerchief. The German\r\n_Schnupftuch_ is, however, nearly as plain. A handkerchief was also\r\nanciently called a “muckinger” or “muckender,” and from that a\r\nneckerchief was called a “neckinger.”\r\n\r\n~Snow~, wet linen, or linen hung out to dry.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Snow-gatherer~, or SNOW-DROPPER, a rogue who steals linen from hedges\r\nand drying-grounds.\r\n\r\n~Snuff~, “up to SNUFF,” knowing and sharp; “to take SNUFF,” to be\r\noffended. Shakspeare uses SNUFF in the sense of anger, or passion.\r\n\r\n~Snuff it~, to die. Term very common among the lower orders of London. A\r\nfanciful variation of “putting one’s light out,” and used simply in\r\nreference to the action of the person dying. Thus any one threatening to\r\nmurder another says, “I’ll put your light out,” or any one committing\r\nsuicide is said to “put his own light out;” but to “SNUFF IT” is always\r\nto die from disease or accident. To “lay down one’s knife and fork,” to\r\n“peg out,” or “give up,” are variations of this form of euphemism.\r\n\r\n~Snuffy~, tipsy, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Snuggle~, to lie closely and cosily.\r\n\r\n~Snyder~, a tailor. _German_, SCHNEIDER.\r\n\r\n~Soaker~, an habitual drunkard.\r\n\r\n~Soap~, flattery. _See_ SOFT SOAP.\r\n\r\n~Sober-water~, a jocular allusion to the uses of soda-water.\r\n\r\n~Social evil~, a name for some years applied to our street-walking\r\nsystem, in consequence of the articles in the newspapers which treat on\r\nthe evils of prostitution being so headed. A good story has been often\r\ntold on this subject, which will bear repeating:—“A well-known divine\r\nand philanthropist was walking in a crowded street at night in order to\r\ndistribute tracts to promising subjects. A young woman was walking up\r\nand down, and he accosted her. He pointed out to her the error of her\r\nways, implored her to reform, and tendered her a tract with fervent\r\nentreaties to go home and read it. The girl stared at him for a moment\r\nor two in sheer bewilderment; at last it dawned on her what he meant,\r\nand for what he took her, and looking up in his face with simple\r\namazement, she exclaimed, ‘Lor’ bless you, sir, I ain’t a SOCIAL EVIL;\r\nI’m waitin’ for the ’bus!’” The enthusiasm which was felt in this\r\ndirection a few years back has received considerable modification, as it\r\nhas been proved that the efforts of the promoters of midnight meetings\r\nand other arrangements of a similar nature, praiseworthy though they\r\nare, have little or no effect; and that the early-closing movement in\r\nthe Haymarket has done more to stamp out the SOCIAL EVIL than years of\r\npreaching, even when accompanied by tea and buns, could ever have done.\r\n\r\n~Sock~, the Eton College term for a treat, synonymous with “chuck” used\r\nat Westminster and other schools. Believed to be derived from the\r\nmonkish word SOKE. An old writer speaks of a pious man “who did not SOKE\r\nfor three days,” meaning that he fasted. The word is still used by the\r\nboys of Heriot’s Hospital School at Edinburgh, and signifies a\r\nsweetmeat; being derived from the same source as sugar, _suck_, SUCRE,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n~Sock~, credit. As, “He gets his goods on SOCK, while I pay ready.”\r\n\r\n~Sock into him~, _i.e._, give him a good drubbing; “give him SOCK,”\r\n_i.e._, thrash him well.\r\n\r\n~Sockdolager.~ _See_ STOCKDOLLAGER.\r\n\r\n~Socket-money~, money extorted by threats of exposure. To be applied to\r\nfor SOCKET-MONEY is perhaps one of the most terrible inflictions that\r\ncan befall a respectable man. SOCKETERS, as the applicants are called,\r\nshould be punished with the utmost possible severity.\r\n\r\n~Sodom~, a nickname for Wadham, due to the similarity of the\r\nsounds.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Soft~, foolish, inexperienced. A term for bank-notes.\r\n\r\n~Soft-horn~, a simpleton; literally a donkey, whose ears, the\r\nsubstitutes of horns, are soft.\r\n\r\n~Soft-sawder~, flattery easily laid on or received. Probably introduced\r\nby Sam Slick.\r\n\r\n~Soft-soap~, or soft-sawder, flattery, ironical praise.\r\n\r\n~Soft-tack~, bread.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Soft-tommy~, loaf-bread, in contradistinction to hard biscuit.\r\n\r\n~Soiled doves~, the “Midnight Meeting” term for prostitutes and “gay”\r\nladies generally.\r\n\r\n~Sold~, “SOLD again! and got the money,” gulled, deceived. _Vide_ SELL.\r\n\r\n~Sold up~, or OUT, broken down, bankrupt.\r\n\r\n~Soldier~, a red herring. Common term in seaport towns, where exchange\r\nis made, a soldier being called by the fishy title.\r\n\r\n~Something damp~, a dram, a drink.\r\n\r\n~Son of a gun~, a familiar term for a man. Sometimes applied\r\neulogistically, never contemptuously. Generally said of an artful\r\nperson, and perhaps, originally, son of a “gun,” (or “gonnof”). In the\r\narmy it is sometimes applied to an artilleryman.\r\n\r\n~Sonkey~, a clumsy, awkward fellow.\r\n\r\n~Soor~, an abusive term. _Hindostanee_, a pig.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Soot-bag~, a reticule.\r\n\r\n~Sop~, a soft or foolish man. Abbreviation of MILKSOP.\r\n\r\n~Soph~ (abbreviation of “sophister”), a title peculiar to the University\r\nof Cambridge. Undergraduates are junior SOPHS before passing their\r\n“Little Go,” or first University examination,—senior SOPHS after that.\r\n\r\n~Sort~, used in a slang sense thus—“That’s your SORT,” as a term of\r\napprobation. “Pitch it into him, that’s your SORT,” _i.e._, that is the\r\nproper kind of plan to adopt.\r\n\r\n~So-so~, not particularly reputable. “A very SO-SO sort of a person,” a\r\nperson whom it is no advantage to know. “It was very SO-SO” (said of a\r\npiece of work or an entertainment), it was neither good nor bad.\r\n\r\n~Sound~, to pump, or draw information from a person in an artful manner.\r\n\r\n~Souper~, an Irish Roman Catholic who pretends conversion—or\r\nperversion—so as to obtain a share of the soup and blankets provided\r\nfor Protestants only by Christian missionaries. These recalcitrants are\r\nalso called “swaddlers.”\r\n\r\n~Sou’-wester~, a hat with a projection behind. Much worn at sea in\r\n“dirty” weather. A hat similar to that of a dustman or coalheaver, which\r\nis called a “fantail.”\r\n\r\n~Sov~, contraction of sovereign; much used in sporting parlance to\r\ndenote the amount of entrance money, forfeit, and added coin in\r\nconnexion with a race. In the published conditions of a race the word\r\nSOVS is almost invariably used in preference to pounds, though in\r\nreckoning the net value of a big stake, after its decision, the common £\r\nis used.\r\n\r\n~Sow~, the receptacle into which the liquid iron is poured in a\r\ngun-foundry. The melted metal poured from it is termed PIG.\r\n\r\n~Sow’s baby~, a pig; sixpence.\r\n\r\n~Spanish~, money. Probably a relic of buccaneering days.\r\n\r\n    “Save its synonyms SPANISH, blunt, stumpy, and rowdy.”—_Barham._\r\n\r\n~Spank~, a smack, or hard slap.\r\n\r\n~Spank~, to move along quickly; hence a fast horse or vessel is said to\r\nbe “a SPANKER to go.”\r\n\r\n~Spanking~, large, fine, or strong; _e.g._, a SPANKING pace, a SPANKING\r\nbreeze, a SPANKING fellow.\r\n\r\n~Sparks~, diamonds. Term much in use among the lower orders, and\r\ngenerally applied to stones in rings and pins.\r\n\r\n~Specklebellies~, Dissenters.

On the turf a man will wait\r\nbefore investing on a horse until he “gets the SPEECH,” as to whether it\r\nis going to try, or whether it has a good chance.

German, SPIELEN. _See_ KEN.—_Don\r\nJuan._\r\n\r\n~Spick and span~, applied to anything that is quite new and\r\nfresh.—_Hudibras._\r\n\r\n~Spidireen~, the name of an imaginary ship, sometimes mentioned by\r\nsailors. If a sailor be asked what ship he belongs to, and does not wish\r\nto tell, he will most probably reply—“The SPIDIREEN frigate, with nine\r\ndecks, and ne’er a bottom.” _See_ MERRY DUN OF DOVER.\r\n\r\n~Spierized~, to have your hair cut and shampooed, from the shop of\r\nSpiers in High Street.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Spiff~, a well-dressed man, a “swell.”\r\n\r\n~Spiffed~, slightly intoxicated.—_Scotch Slang._\r\n\r\n~Spiffs~, the per-centages allowed by drapers to their young men when\r\nthey effect a sale of old-fashioned or undesirable stock.\r\n\r\n~Spiffy~, spruce, well-dressed, _tout à la mode_.\r\n\r\n~Spifflicate~, to confound, silence, annihilate, or stifle.

The contrivance very much resembles a sea compass, and was\r\nformerly the gambling accompaniment of London piemen. The apparatus then\r\nwas placed on the tin lids of their pie-cans, and the bets were\r\nostensibly for pies, but were frequently for “coppers,” or for beer when\r\ntwo or three apprentices or porters happened to meet. An active and\r\nefficient police have, however, changed all that now.\r\n\r\n~Spiniken~, St. Giles’s Workhouse. “Lump,” Marylebone Workhouse. “Pan,”\r\nSt. Pancras. “Pan” and “Lump” are now terms applied to all workhouses by\r\ntramps and costers.\r\n\r\n~Spinning-house~, the place in Cambridge where street-walkers are locked\r\nup, if found out after a certain time at night.\r\n\r\n~Spirt~, or SPURT, “to put on a SPIRT,” to make an increased exertion\r\nfor a brief space, to attain one’s end; a nervous effort.

Amongst workmen it is\r\nusual to tighten the apron string when no dinner is at hand. Hunters and\r\ntrappers always take in their belts when supplies are short. “An\r\nIrishman’s dinner” is a low East-end term, and means a smoke and a visit\r\nto the urinal. Sometimes the phrase is, “I’ll go out and count the\r\nrailings,” _i.e._, the park or area railings, mental instead of\r\nmaxillary exercise.\r\n\r\n~Spitfire~, a passionate person.\r\n\r\n~Splash~, complexion powder used by ladies to whiten their necks and\r\nfaces. The finest rice flour, termed in France _poudre de riz_, is\r\ngenerally employed. _See_ SLAP.\r\n\r\n~Splendiferous~, sumptuous, first-rate.

Among athletes, a man with good length of\r\nlimb is said to be “well SPLIT UP.”\r\n\r\n~Splodger~, a lout, an awkward countryman.\r\n\r\n~Spoffy~, a bustling busybody is said to be SPOFFY.\r\n\r\n~Sponge~, “to throw up the SPONGE,” to submit, to give over the\r\nstruggle,—from the practice of throwing up the SPONGE used to cleanse a\r\ncombatant’s face at a prize-fight, as a signal that the side on which\r\nthat particular SPONGE has been used has had enough—that the SPONGE is\r\nno longer required.\r\n\r\n~Spoon~, synonymous with SPOONEY. A SPOON has been defined to be “a\r\nthing that touches a lady’s lips without kissing them.”\r\n\r\n~Spooney~, a weak-minded and foolish person, effeminate or fond; “to be\r\nSPOONEY on a girl,” to be foolishly attached to one.\r\n\r\n~Spoons~, the condition of two persons who SPOON on each other, who are\r\ndeeply in love. “I see, it’s a case of SPOONS with them,” is a common\r\nphrase when lovers are mentioned.\r\n\r\n~Spoons~, a method of designating large sums of money, disclosed at the\r\nBankruptcy Court during the examination of the great leather failures of\r\nStreatfield and Laurence in 1860-61. The origin of the phrase was stated\r\nto be the reply of the bankrupt Laurence to an offer of accommodating\r\nhim with £5000,—“Oh, you are feeding me with a TEA-SPOON.” Hence, £5000\r\ncame to be known in the firm as a TEA-SPOON; £10,000, a DESSERT-SPOON;\r\n£15,000, a TABLE-SPOON; and £20,000, as a GRAVY-SPOON. The public were\r\namused at this TEA-SPOON phraseology, but were disgusted that such\r\nlevity should cover a gigantic swindle of the kind. It came out in\r\nevidence, however, that it was not the ordinary slang of the discount\r\nworld, but it may not improbably become so. To “take it with a SPOON,”\r\nis to take anything in small quantities. The counsel for the defence in\r\nthe Tichborne perjury case was reminded a short time back by one of the\r\njudges that he was using a TEA-SPOON instead of a shovel, to clear\r\nthrough the evidence.\r\n\r\n~Sport~, to exhibit, to wear, &c.,—a word which is made to do duty in a\r\nvariety of senses, especially at the Universities.—_See_ the _Gradus ad\r\nCantabrigiam_. “To SPORT a new tile;” “to SPORT an _Ægrotat_” (_i.e._, a\r\npermission from the Dons to abstain from lectures, &c., on account of\r\nillness); “to SPORT one’s oak,” to shut the outer door and exclude the\r\npublic,—especially duns and boring acquaintances.

SPRINT is in the North synonymous with SPURT, and hence the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n~Sprung~, inebriated sufficiently to become boisterous.\r\n\r\n~Spry~, active, strong, manly. Much used in America, but originally\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n~Spuddy~, a seller of bad potatoes. In lower life, a SPUD is a raw\r\npotato; and roasted SPUDS are those cooked in the cinders with their\r\nskins on.\r\n\r\n~Spun~, when a man has failed in his examination at Woolwich, he is said\r\nto be SPUN; as at the Universities he is said to be “plucked” or\r\n“ploughed.”\r\n\r\n~Spunge~, a mean, paltry fellow, sometimes called a SPUNGER.\r\n\r\n~Spunge~, to live at another’s expense in a mean and paltry manner.\r\n\r\n~Spunging-house~, the sheriff’s officer’s house, where prisoners, when\r\narrested for debt, used to be taken. As extortionate charges were made\r\nthere for accommodation, the name was far from inappropriate.\r\n\r\n~Spunk~, spirit, fire, courage, mettle, good humour.\r\n\r\n    “In that snug room, where any man of SPUNK\r\n    Would find it a hard matter to get drunk.”\r\n\r\n        _Peter Pindar_, i. 245.\r\n\r\nCommon in America, and much used in some parts of Scotland.\r\n\r\n~Spunk-fencer~, a lucifer-match seller.\r\n\r\n~Spunks~, lucifer-matches.—_Herefordshire_; _Scotland_. SPUNK, says Urry,\r\nin his MS. notes to Ray, “is the excrescency of some tree, of which they\r\nmake a sort of tinder to light their pipes with.”\r\n\r\n~Spurt.~—_Old._ _See_ SPIRT.\r\n\r\n~Squabby~, flat, short and thick. From SQUAB, a sofa.\r\n\r\n~Square~, honest; “on the SQUARE,” _i.e._, fair and strictly honest; “to\r\nturn SQUARE,” to reform, and get one’s living in an honest manner,—the\r\nopposite of “cross.” The expression is, in all probability, derived from\r\nthe well-known masonic emblem the SQUARE, the symbol of evenness and\r\nrectitude.\r\n\r\n    “You must keep within the compass, and act upon the square with all\r\n    mankind, for your masonry is but a dead letter if you do not\r\n    habitually perform its reiterated injunctions.”—_Oliver’s Lectures\r\n    on Signs and Symbols_, p. 190.\r\n\r\n~Square~, “to be SQUARE with a man,” to be even with him, or to be\r\nrevenged; “to SQUARE up to a man,” to offer to fight him. Shakspeare\r\nuses SQUARE in the sense of to quarrel.\r\n\r\n~Square cove~, an honest man, as distinguished from “cross cove.”\r\n\r\n~Square moll~, an honest woman, one who does not “batter.”\r\n\r\n~Squaring his nibs~, giving a policeman, or any official, money for an\r\nimmoral or unlawful purpose. The term HIS NIBS has no reference to any\r\nfunctionary, as the words mean simply “him,” and may be applied to any\r\none.\r\n\r\n~Square rigged~, well dressed.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Square up~, to settle, to pay a debt.\r\n\r\n~Squarum~, a cobbler’s lapstone.\r\n\r\n~Squash~, to crush; “to go SQUASH,” to collapse.\r\n\r\n~Squeak~, an escape.

A North country variation of squeak;\r\nSQUEALER, an informer, also an illegitimate baby.\r\n\r\n~Squeeze~, silk; also, by a very significant figure, a thief’s term for\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\n~Squib~, a _jeu d’esprit_, which, like the firework of that\r\ndenomination, sparkles, bounces, stinks, and vanishes.—_Grose._\r\nGenerally used in reference to political and electioneering attacks of a\r\nsmart kind, which sting for a moment and are then forgotten.\r\n\r\n~Squibs~, paint-brushes.\r\n\r\n~Squiffy~, slightly inebriated.\r\n\r\n~Squinny-eyed~, said of one given to squinting.—_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n~Squirt~, a doctor, or chemist.\r\n\r\n~Squish~, common term among University men for marmalade.\r\n\r\n~Stab~, “STAB yourself and pass the dagger,” help yourself and pass the\r\nbottle.—_Theatrical Slang._\r\n\r\n~Stab~, “on the STAB,” _i.e._, paid by regular weekly wages on the\r\n“establishment,” of which word STAB is an abridgment.—_Printer’s term._\r\n\r\n~Stab-rag~, a regimental tailor.—_Military Slang._\r\n\r\n~Stag~, a shilling.\r\n\r\n~Stag~, a term applied during the railway mania to a speculator without\r\ncapital, who took “scrip” in proposed lines, got the shares up to a\r\npremium, and then sold out. Caricaturists represented the house of\r\nHudson, “the Railway King,” at Albert Gate, with a STAG on it, in\r\nallusion to this term.\r\n\r\n~Stag~, to see, discover, or watch,—like a STAG at gaze; “STAG the\r\npush,” look at the crowd. Also, to dun, or demand payment; to beg.\r\n\r\n~Stage-whisper~, one loud enough to be heard. From the stage “asides.”\r\n\r\n~Stagger~, to surprise. “He quite STAGGERED me with the information.”\r\n\r\n~Stagger~, one who looks out, or watches.\r\n\r\n~Staggering-bob~, an animal to whom the knife only just anticipates\r\ndeath from natural disease or accident,—said of meat on that account\r\nunfit for human food. Also a newly-born calf.\r\n\r\n~Stale drunk~, unevaporated fumes of liquor. A man is said to be STALE\r\nDRUNK when he has been drunk overnight, and has doctored himself with\r\nstimulants a little too much in the morning—when he has tried too many\r\nof the “hairs of the dog that bit him.” If this state of things is long\r\ncontinued, it is often called “same OLD DRUNK,” from a well-known nigger\r\nstory. The nigger was cautioned by his master for being too often drunk\r\nwithin a given period, when the “cullud pusson” replied, “Same old\r\ndrunk, massa—same old drunk.”\r\n\r\n~Stalking-horse~, originally a horse covered with loose trappings, under\r\nwhich the mediæval sportsman concealed himself with his bow, so as to\r\napproach his game unobserved. Subsequently a canvas figure, made light,\r\nso as to be easily moved with one hand. Now used to represent any\r\nbugbear persistently paraded; any constant and unpleasant reference to\r\nthe possible consequences of an act.\r\n\r\n~Stall~, to lodge, or put up at a public-house. Also, to act a\r\npart.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Stall~, to frighten or discourage. In the days of dog-fighting and\r\npugilism, a dog or man who had originally shown great pluck would, after\r\na hard battle or two, show signs of cowardice. In such case he was said\r\nto have been STALLED by his previous encounters. A STALL is a spurious\r\nexcuse or an imposition, a dodge, &c.\r\n\r\n~Stall-off~, to put off by means of a device, to misdirect purposely.\r\n\r\n~Stall off~, to blind, excuse, hide, to screen a robbery during the\r\nperpetration of it by an accomplice.\r\n\r\n~Stall your mug~, go away; spoken sharply by any one who wishes to get\r\nrid of a troublesome or inconvenient person.\r\n\r\n~Stallsman~, sometimes STALL, an accomplice.\r\n\r\n~Stampers~, shoes.—_Ancient Cant._\r\n\r\n~Stand~, “to STAND treat,” to pay for a friend’s entertainment; to bear\r\nexpense; to put up with treatment, good or ill, as, “Will you STAND\r\nthat?” a question often asked when a man has been struck or insulted.\r\nAlso in the sense of aggregate cost, as, “This house STOOD me in £1000;”\r\n_i.e._, cost that sum; “to STAND pad,” to beg on the kerb with a small\r\npiece of paper pinned on the breast, inscribed, “I am starving.”\r\n\r\n~Stand in~, to make one of a party in a bet or other speculation; to\r\ntake a side in a dispute.\r\n\r\n~Standing~, the position at a street corner, or on the kerb of a market\r\nstreet, regularly occupied by a costermonger, or street seller.\r\n\r\n~Standing patterers~, men who take a stand on the kerb of a public\r\nthoroughfare, and deliver prepared speeches to effect a sale of any\r\narticles they have to vend. _See_ PATTERER.\r\n\r\n~Stangey~, a tailor, a person under petticoat government,—derived from\r\nthe custom of “riding the STANG,” mentioned in _Hudibras_:—\r\n\r\n    “It is a custom used of course\r\n    Where the grey mare is the better horse.”\r\n\r\n~Star~, a common abbreviation of the name of the well-known STAR AND\r\nGARTER Inn at Richmond. Clever people, who delight in altering names,\r\ncall this hostelry the “Gar and Starter.”\r\n\r\n~Star it~, to perform as the centre of attraction, with inferior\r\nsubordinates to set off one’s abilities.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Star the glaze~, to break a window. Among thieves it means to break the\r\nwindow or show-glass of a jeweller or other tradesman, take any valuable\r\narticles, and run away. Sometimes the glass is cut with a diamond, and a\r\nstrip of leather fastened to the piece of glass cut out to keep it from\r\nfalling in and making a noise. Another plan is to cut the sash.\r\n\r\n~Starchy~, stuck-up, high-notioned, showily dressed, stiff and unbending\r\nin demeanour.\r\n\r\n~Stark-naked~, originally STRIP-ME-NAKED, _vide Randall’s Diary_, 1820,\r\nraw gin.\r\n\r\n~Start~, “the START,” London,—the great starting-point for beggars and\r\ntramps. This is a term also used by many of superior station to those\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n~Start~, a proceeding of any kind; “a rum START,” an odd circumstance;\r\n“to get the START of a person,” to anticipate or overreach him.\r\n\r\n~Starvation~, though now a recognised word, was originally slang. Its\r\nderivation is composite, and it was first introduced into the English\r\nlanguage by Mr. Dundas, in a debate in the House of Commons on American\r\naffairs, in 1775. “I shall not,” he said, “wait for the advent of\r\nSTARVATION from Edinburgh to settle my judgment.” From this he was\r\nalways afterwards called STARVATION Dundas.—_Horace Walpole’s Letters._\r\n\r\n~Starve’em~, ~Rob’em~, and ~Cheat’em~, the adjoining towns of Stroud,\r\nRochester, and Chatham are so designated by soldiers and sailors; from\r\nsome fancied peculiarities of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n~Stash~, to cease doing anything, to refrain, be quiet, leave off;\r\n“STASH it, there, you sir!” _i.e._, be quiet, sir; to give over a lewd\r\nor intemperate course of life is to STASH it.\r\n\r\n~Stay~, to exhibit powers of endurance at walking, running, rowing, &c.\r\n\r\n~Stayer~, one likely to persevere, one not easily discouraged. It is\r\nusual for _laudatores temporis acti_ connected with the turf to deplore\r\nthe want of staying power which, according to their statements,\r\ncharacterizes the modern British racehorse; while others, connected and\r\ndisconnected with sport, make similar remarks with reference to the\r\nmodern British man. So far, however, both descriptions of old gentlemen\r\nhave failed signally in endeavouring to make out a good case.\r\n\r\n~Steam-engine~, potato-pie at Manchester is so termed.\r\n\r\n~Steel~, the House of Correction in London, formerly named the Bastile,\r\nbut since shortened to STEEL. _See_ BASTILE.\r\n\r\n~Steel-bar drivers~, or FLINGERS, journeymen tailors.\r\n\r\n~Stems~, the legs.\r\n\r\n~Step it~, to run away, or make off.\r\n\r\n~Stepper~, the treadmill; the “everlasting staircase.”\r\n\r\n~Stick~, a derogatory expression for a person; “a rum, or odd, STICK,” a\r\ncurious man. More generally a “poor STICK.”—_Provincial._\r\n\r\n~Stick~, “cut your STICK,” be off, or go away; either simply equivalent\r\nto a recommendation to prepare a walking staff in readiness for a\r\njourney—in allusion to the Eastern custom of cutting a STICK before\r\nsetting out—or from the ancient mode of reckoning by notches or tallies\r\non a STICK. In Cornwall the peasantry tally sheaves of corn by cuts in a\r\nSTICK, reckoning by the score. “Cut your STICK” in this sense may mean\r\nto make your mark and pass on—and so realize the meaning of the phrase,\r\n“in the nick (or notch) of time.” Sir J. Emerson Tennent considers the\r\nphrase equivalent to “cutting the connexion,” and suggests a possible\r\norigin in the prophet’s breaking the staves of “Beauty” and\r\n“Bands,”—_vide_ Zech. xi. 10, 14.\r\n\r\n~Stick~, to cheat; “he got STUCK,” he was taken in; “I’m STUCK,” a\r\ncommon phrase to express that the speaker has spent or lost all his\r\nmoney, and can neither play nor pay any longer. STICK, to forget one’s\r\npart in a performance.—_Theatrical._ STICK up, to place in an account;\r\n“STICK it up to me,” _i.e._, give me credit for it; STICK on, to\r\novercharge or defraud; STICK up for, to defend a person, especially when\r\nslandered in his absence; STICK up to, to persevere in courting or\r\nattacking, whether in fisticuffs or argument; “to STICK in one’s\r\ngizzard,” to rankle in one’s heart; “to STICK to a person,” to adhere to\r\none, to be his friend through adverse circumstances,—to “cotton” to\r\nhim; “to STICK one’s spoon in the wall,” to die.\r\n\r\n~Stick-up~, to keep any one waiting at an appointed place or time. To\r\nleave a friend or acquaintance to pay the whole or an undue share of a\r\ntavern bill.\r\n\r\n~Stick-ups~, or GILLS, shirt collars.\r\n\r\n~Sticker~, one not likely to be easily shaken off, a stayer.\r\n\r\n~Stickings~, coarse, bruised, or damaged meat sold to sausage-makers and\r\npenny pie-shops.\r\n\r\n~Sticks~, furniture, or household chattels; “pick up your STICKS and\r\ncut!” summary advice to a person to take himself and furniture away.\r\n\r\n~Sticky~, wax.\r\n\r\n~Stiff~, paper, a bill of acceptance, &c.; “how did you get it, STIFF or\r\nhard?” _i.e._, did he pay you cash or give a bill? “To do a bit of\r\nSTIFF,” to accept a bill. _See_ KITE.\r\n\r\n~Stiff-fencer~, a street-seller of writing paper.\r\n\r\n~Stiff un~, a corpse. Term used by undertakers.\r\n\r\n~Stills~, undertakers’ slang term for STILL-BORN children. The fee paid\r\nby nurses and others for their disposal is usually 2_s._ 6_d._ A\r\nseparate coffin is never given; the STILLS are quietly introduced into\r\none containing an adult about to be buried. STILLS are allowed to\r\naccumulate at an undertaker’s until they sometimes number as many as a\r\ndozen. Some little time back a very bulky coffin was opened, and found\r\nto contain a large quantity of small corpses packed carefully round a\r\nlarge corpse. This caused a little excitement, but nothing was done in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n~Stilton~, “that’s the STILTON,” or “it’s not the STILTON,” _i.e._, that\r\nis quite the thing, or that is not quite the thing;—affected rendering\r\nof “that is not the CHEESE,” which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Stingo~, strong liquor.—_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\n~Stink~, a disagreeable exposure. “To stir up a STINK” is to make a\r\ndisclosure which is generally unpleasant in its effect.\r\n\r\n~Stinkomalee~, a name given to the then New London University by\r\nTheodore Hook. Probably because some cow-houses and dunghills stood on\r\nthe original site. Some question about Trincomalee was agitated at the\r\nsame time. It is still applied by the students of the old Universities,\r\nwho regard it with disfavour from its admitting all denominations.\r\n\r\n~Stipe~, a stipendiary magistrate.—_Provincial._\r\n\r\n~Stir~, a prison, a lock-up; “in STIR,” in gaol. _Anglo-Saxon_, STYR,\r\ncorrection, punishment.\r\n\r\n~Stir-up Sunday~, the Sunday next before Advent, the collect for that\r\nday commencing with the words, “Stir up.” Schoolboys, growing excited at\r\nthe prospect of the vacation, irreverently commemorate it by stirring\r\nup—pushing and poking each other. “Crib-crust Monday” and “tug-button\r\nTuesday” are distinguished by similar tricks; while on “pay-off\r\nWednesday” they retaliate small grudges in a playful facetious way.\r\nForby says good housewives in Norfolk consider themselves reminded by\r\nthe name to mix the ingredients for their Christmas mince-pies.\r\n\r\n~Stock.~ “To STOCK cards” is to arrange cards in a certain manner for\r\ncheating purposes.\r\n\r\n~Stock~, “to take STOCK of one,” to scrutinize narrowly one whom you\r\nhave reason to suspect, or one with whom you are likely to have business\r\ntransactions; taken from the tradesmen’s term for the annual examination\r\nand valuation of their stock of goods.\r\n\r\n~Stockdollager~, a heavy blow, a “finisher.” _Italian_, STOCCADO,\r\na fencing term. Also (in a general sense), a disastrous\r\nevent.—_Americanism._\r\n\r\n~Stodge~, to surfeit, gorge, or clog with food. STODGE is in some places\r\nbread and milk.\r\n\r\n~Stoll~, to understand.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Stomach~, to bear with, to be partial to. Mostly used in a negative\r\ncharacter,—as, “I can’t STOMACH that.”\r\n\r\n~Stone-jug~, a prison.\r\n\r\n    “In a box of the stone-jug I was born.”\r\n\r\n~Stook~, a pocket-handkerchief. A STOOK-HAULER, or “buzzer,” is a thief\r\nwho takes pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n~Story~, a falsehood,—the soft synonym for a lie, allowed in family\r\ncircles and boarding-schools. A Puritanism that came into fashion with\r\nthe tirade against romances, all novels and stories being considered as\r\ndangerous and false.\r\n\r\n~Stot~, a young bullock. In Northumberland the term STOT means to\r\nrebound.\r\n\r\n~Stotor~, a heavy blow, a settler.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Stow~, to leave off, or have done; “STOW it, the gorger’s leary.” Leave\r\noff, the person is looking. _See_ STASH, with which it is\r\nsynonymous.—_Ancient Cant._\r\n\r\n~Stow~, to put away, to hide. A hungry man is said to STOW his food\r\nrapidly. He is also said to hide it.\r\n\r\n~Stow faking!~ leave off there, be quiet! FAKING means anything that may\r\nbe going on.\r\n\r\n~Straight~, an American phrase peculiar to dram-drinkers; similar to our\r\nword NEAT, which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Strap~, a barber. From _Roderick Random_.\r\n\r\n~Straw.~ Married ladies are said to be “in the STRAW” at their\r\naccouchements. The phrase is a coarse metaphor, and has reference to\r\nfarmyard animals in a similar condition. It may have originally been\r\nsuggested to the inquiring mind by the Nativity.\r\n\r\n~Strawing~, “selling” straws in the streets (generally for a penny), and\r\n“giving” the purchaser a paper (indecent or political) or a gold (!)\r\nring,—neither of which, the patterer states, he is allowed by Act of\r\nParliament to sell.\r\n\r\n~Streak~, to decamp, run away.—_Saxon._ In America the phrase is “to\r\nmake STREAKS,” or “make TRACKS.”\r\n\r\n~Streaky~, irritated, ill-tempered. Said of a short-tempered man who has\r\nhis good and bad times in STREAK.\r\n\r\n~Street-pitchers~, negro minstrels, ballad-singers, long-song men, men\r\n“working a board” on which have been painted various exciting scenes in\r\nsome terrible drama, the details of which the STREET PITCHER is bawling\r\nout, and selling in a little book or broadsheet (price one penny); or\r\nany persons who make a stand—_i.e._, a pitch—in the streets, and sell\r\narticles or contribute entertainments for a living.\r\n\r\n~Stretch~, a walk.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Stretch~, abbreviation of “STRETCH one’s neck,” to hang, to be executed\r\nas a malefactor. As, “The night before Larry was STRETCHED.”\r\n\r\n~Stretch~, twelve months,—generally used to intimate the time any one\r\nhas been sentenced by the judge or magistrate. One STRETCH is twelve\r\nmonths’ imprisonment, two STRETCH is two years, three STRETCH is three\r\nyears, and so on.\r\n\r\n~Stretcher~, a falsehood; one that requires a STRETCH of imagination or\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\n~Stretcher~, a contrivance with handles, used by the police to carry off\r\npersons who are violent or drunk.\r\n\r\n~Stretcher-fencer~, one who sells braces.\r\n\r\n~Stretching match~, an execution. Often called a “hanging match.”\r\n\r\n~Strike a jigger~, to pick a lock, or break open a door.\r\n\r\n~Strike me lucky!~ an expression used by the lower orders when making a\r\nbargain, derived from the old custom of striking hands together, leaving\r\nin that of the seller a LUCK PENNY as an earnest that the bargain is\r\nconcluded. In Ireland, at cattle markets, &c., a penny, or other small\r\ncoin, is always given by the buyer to the seller to ratify the\r\nbargain.—_Hudibras._ Anciently this was called a “God’s penny.”\r\n\r\n    “With that he cast him a God’s penny.”—_Heir of Linne._\r\n\r\nThe origin of the phrase being lost sight of, like that of many others,\r\nit is often used as a modification of “Strike me blind!” and is now and\r\nagain corrupted into “Strike me silly!” A foolish variation of this is\r\n“Strike me up a gum-tree!”\r\n\r\n~Strills~, cheating lies.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~String~, to hoax, to “get in a line.”\r\n\r\n~Stroke~, the captain of a crew, the man who sets the pace, and is\r\ngenerally the leading spirit in the boat. The coxswain usually looks\r\nafter University men when they are in training, so that they may not\r\nfall into excesses, the STROKE having quite enough to do to attend to\r\nhis own training. Of late years University crews have placed themselves\r\nunder the guidance and tuition of “coaches,” generally ex-University men\r\nof great ability and experience.\r\n\r\n~Strommel~, straw.—_Ancient Cant._ Halliwell says that in Norfolk\r\nSTRUMMEL is a name for hair.\r\n\r\n~Strong~, “to come it STRONG.” _See_ COME.\r\n\r\n~Stuck~, moneyless. _See_ STICK.\r\n\r\n~Stuck-up~, purse-proud—a form of snobbishness very common in those who\r\nhave risen in the world, especially among those who have risen rather\r\nsuddenly. Albert Smith wrote some amusing papers on the _Natural History\r\nof STUCK-UP People_.\r\n\r\n~Stuff~, money.\r\n\r\n~Stuff~, to make false but plausible statements, to praise ironically,\r\nto make game of a person,—literally, to STUFF or cram him with gammon\r\nor falsehood.\r\n\r\n~Stump~, to go on foot.\r\n\r\n~Stump~, to go about speechmaking on politics or other subjects.\r\nOriginally an Americanism applied to the lowest class of candidates for\r\nlegislatorial honours, probably because they stood on a STUMP to address\r\ntheir audiences. Maybe, also, because their utterances were short and\r\npithy. This latter reason would, however, hardly apply to our\r\nrepresentatives of the STUMP class, “the Leaguers,” who are, as a rule,\r\nas long-winded as they are illogical.\r\n\r\n~Stump up~, to give one’s share, to pay the reckoning, to bring forth\r\nthe money reluctantly.\r\n\r\n~Stumped~, bowled out, done for, bankrupt, poverty-stricken. From the\r\ncricketing term.\r\n\r\n~Stumps~, legs, or feet.\r\n\r\n~Stumpy~, money.\r\n\r\n~Stun~, to astonish.\r\n\r\n~Stunner~, a first-rate person or article.\r\n\r\n~Stunners~, feelings of great astonishment; “it put the STUNNERS on me,”\r\n_i.e._, it confounded me.\r\n\r\n~Stunning~, first-rate, very good, really, astonishing. Costermongers\r\ncall anything extra good, STUNNING. Sometimes amplified to STUNNING JOE\r\nBANKS! when the expression is supposed to be in its most intense form.\r\nJoe Banks was a noted character in the last generation. He was the\r\nproprietor of a public-house in Dyott Street, Seven Dials, and\r\nafterwards, on the demolition of the Rookery, of another in Cranbourn\r\nAlley. His houses became well-known from their being the resort of the\r\nworst characters, while at the same time the strictest decorum was\r\nalways maintained in them. Joe Banks also acquired a remarkable\r\nnotoriety by acting as a medium betwixt thieves and their victims. Upon\r\nthe proper payment to Joe, a watch or a snuff-box would at any time be\r\nrestored to its lawful owner—“no questions in any case being asked.”\r\nThe most daring depredators in London placed the fullest confidence in\r\nJoe, and it is believed (although the _Biographie Universelle_ is quiet\r\nupon this point) that he never, in any instance, “sold” them. He was of\r\nthe middle height, stout, and strongly made, and was always noted for a\r\nshowy pin and a remarkably STUNNING neck-tie. It was this peculiarity in\r\nthe costume of Mr. Banks, coupled with those true and tried qualities as\r\na friend for which he was famous, that led his customers to proclaim him\r\nas STUNNING JOE BANKS! The Marquis of Douro, Colonel Chatterley, and men\r\nof their stamp, were accustomed to resort to a private-room at his\r\nhouse, when too late (or too early) to gain admittance to the clubs or\r\nmore aristocratic establishments.\r\n\r\n~Sub~, a subaltern officer in the army.\r\n\r\n~Sub~, all.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Sub~, to draw money in advance; a term in use among workmen generally,\r\nand those with casual employment in particular. Most likely from\r\nsubsidize.\r\n\r\n~Sublime rascal~, a lawyer.\r\n\r\n~Suck~, a parasite, a flatterer of the “nobs.”—_University._\r\n\r\n~Suck~, to pump, or draw information from a person.\r\n\r\n~Suck-casa~, a public-house.—_Lingua Franca._\r\n\r\n~Suck the mop~, to be the victim of an omnibus nursing exploit. When an\r\nomnibus is being nursed, the driver of the hindmost vehicle keeps so\r\nclose to his opponent that the horses get their heads almost into the\r\ndoorway. The nursed omnibus is then said to SUCK THE MOP. Nursing is,\r\nthanks to tramways and the Metropolis Streets Act, almost a thing of the\r\npast. At the East-end, however, it still goes merrily on.\r\n\r\n~Suck the monkey~, to rob a cask of liquor by inserting a straw through\r\na gimlet-hole, and sucking a portion of the contents. Originally, as\r\nCaptain Marryatt states, to SUCK THE MONKEY, was to suck rum from\r\ncocoa-nuts, which spirit had been inserted in place of the milk, for the\r\nprivate use of the sailors. _See_ TAP THE ADMIRAL.\r\n\r\n~Suck up~, “to SUCK UP to a person,” to insinuate oneself into his good\r\ngraces.\r\n\r\n~Sudden death.~ In tossing, to be decided by the first call is to “GO\r\nSUDDEN DEATH,” as distinguished from the longer forms of “best two out\r\nof three,” and “first three.” At the Universities a crumpet, or Sally\r\nLunn, is so called.\r\n\r\n~Sufferer~, a tailor; the loser at any game.\r\n\r\n~Sugar~, money.\r\n\r\n~Suicide~, four horses driven in a line. _See_ HARUM-SCARUM.\r\n\r\n~Sulky~, a one-horse chaise, having only room for one person. Used\r\nnowadays only in trotting matches.\r\n\r\n~Sumsy~, an action of _assumpsit_.—_Legal Slang._\r\n\r\n~Sun in the eyes~, too much drink. A person who is tipsy is said to have\r\nthe SUN IN HIS EYES. He is also said to have been “standing too long in\r\nthe SUN.”\r\n\r\n~Supe~, or super, abbreviation of SUPERNUMERARY.—_Theatrical._\r\n\r\n~Super~, a watch; SUPER-SCREWING, stealing watches.\r\n\r\n~Surat~, an adulterated article of inferior quality. This word affords a\r\nremarkable instance of the manner in which slang phrases are coined. In\r\nthe report of an action for libel in the _Times_, some few years back,\r\nit was stated “that, since the American civil war, it has been not\r\nunusual for manufacturers to mix American cotton with surat, and, the\r\nlatter being an inferior article, the people in Lancashire have begun to\r\napply the term SURAT to any article of inferior or adulterated quality.\r\nThe plaintiffs were brewers, and the action was brought to recover\r\nspecial damages resulting from the publication of an advertisement in\r\nthese words:—‘All in want of beerhouses must beware of Beaumont and\r\nWhite, the SURAT brewers.’”\r\n\r\n~Surf~, an actor who frequently pursues another calling.—_Theatrical._\r\nSURF, or SERF, is also a term much in use among the lower orders to\r\ndenote a crawling or sycophantic wretch.\r\n\r\n~Suspicion~, a scarcely perceptible flavour; as, “There was just a\r\nSUSPICION of oil in the mixture.” _French_, SOUPÇON.\r\n\r\n~Swab~, an epaulet.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Swack-up~, a falsehood.\r\n\r\n~Swaddler~, a Wesleyan Methodist; a name originally given to members of\r\nthat body by the Irish mob; said to have originated with an ignorant\r\nRomanist, to whom the words of the English Bible were a novelty, and\r\nwho, hearing one of John Wesley’s preachers mention the swaddling\r\nclothes of the Holy Infant, in a sermon on Christmas-day at Dublin,\r\nshouted out in derision, “A SWADDLER! a SWADDLER!” as if the whole story\r\nwere the preacher’s invention.—_Southey’s Life of Wesley_, vol. ii. p.\r\n109. _See_ introductory article.\r\n\r\n~Swaddler~, _see_ SOUPER.\r\n\r\n~Swaddy~, or COOLIE, a soldier. The former was originally applied to a\r\ndischarged soldier, and perhaps came from SHODDY, which is made from\r\nsoldiers’ and policemen’s worn-out coats. The term was one of\r\nopprobrium, and was probably the result of a long peace, for it became\r\nobsolete as soon as the Crimean War commenced.\r\n\r\n~Swag~, a lot or plenty of anything, a portion or division of property.\r\nIn Australia the term is used for the luggage carried by diggers.\r\n_Scotch_, SWEG, or SWACK; _German_, SWEIG, a flock. Old cant for a shop.\r\n\r\n~Swag-shop~, a warehouse where “Brummagem” and general wares, fancy\r\ntrinkets, plated goods, &c., are sold. Jews are the general proprietors;\r\nand the goods are very low-priced, trashy, and showy. SWAG-SHOPS were\r\nformerly plunder depôts.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Swagsman~, one who carries the booty after a burglary.\r\n\r\n~Swank~, to boast or “gas” unduly.\r\n\r\n~Swankey~, cheap or small beer. Any weak fermented beverage.\r\n\r\n~Swap~, to exchange. Grose says it is Irish cant, but the term is now\r\nincluded in most dictionaries as an allowed vulgarism.\r\n\r\n~Swarry~, a boiled leg of mutton and trimmings. Sam Weller’s adventure\r\nwith the Bath footmen originated the term. _See_ TRIMMINGS.\r\n\r\n~Swatchel-cove~, the master of a Punch-and-Judy exhibition who “fakes\r\nthe slum,” and does the necessary squeak for the amusement of the\r\nbystanders. _See_ SCHWASSLE BOX. The orthography of many of these\r\ncolloquial expressions differs. It was thought best to give the various\r\nrenderings as collected.\r\n\r\n~Sweat~, to extract money from a person, to “bleed.” Also, to squander\r\nriches.—_Bulwer._\r\n\r\n~Sweat~, to violently shake up a lot of guineas or sovereigns in a\r\nleathern bag for the purpose of benefiting by the perspiration.\r\n\r\n~Sweater~, common term for a “cutting” or “grinding” employer,—one who\r\nSWEATS his workpeople. A cheap tailor, who pays starvation wages.\r\n\r\n~Sweep~, a contemptuous term for a low or shabby man.\r\n\r\n~Sweet~, loving or fond; “how SWEET he was upon the moll,” _i.e._, what\r\nmarked attention he paid the girl.\r\n\r\n~Sweetener~, a person who runs up the prices of articles at an auction.\r\n_See_ JOLLYING, BONNET, &c.\r\n\r\n~Swell~, a man of importance; a person with a showy, jaunty exterior, “a\r\nrank SWELL,” a very flashily dressed person, a man who by excessive\r\ndress apes a higher position than he actually occupies. Any one\r\noccupying a superior position in society is by the mob called a SWELL.\r\nAnything is said to be SWELL or SWELLISH that looks showy, or is many\r\ncoloured, or is of a desirable quality. Dickens and Thackeray were\r\ntermed great SWELLS in literature, and so are the first persons in the\r\nlearned professions SWELLS in their way.\r\n\r\n~Swell hung in chains~, said of a showy man in the habit of wearing much\r\njewellery.\r\n\r\n~Swell street~, the West-end of London.\r\n\r\n~Swig~, a hearty drink.\r\n\r\n~Swig~, to drink. _Saxon_, SWIGAN.\r\n\r\n~Swill~, to drink inordinately. SWILL, hog-wash. From which the verb has\r\npossibly been derived.—_Norfolk._\r\n\r\n~Swim~, “a good SWIM,” a good run of luck, a long time out of the\r\npoliceman’s clutches.—_Thieves’ term._ Among anglers “a good SWIM” is a\r\ngood pitch for a part where fish are plentiful—that is, because a lot\r\nof fish keeping together are called a SWIM. Thus one who is in luck, is\r\nwell connected, or is doing a good business, is said to be in a good\r\nSWIM.\r\n\r\n~Swindler~, although a recognised word in standard dictionaries,\r\ncommenced service as a slang term. It was used as such by the poor\r\nLondoners against the German Jews who set up in London about the year\r\n1762, also by our soldiers in the German war about that time.\r\nSCHWINDELN, in _German_, signifies to cheat.\r\n\r\n~Swing.~ To have one’s SWING is to have a full turn at anything.\r\n\r\n~Swing~, to be hanged; “if you don’t do what’s right, I’ll SWING for\r\nyou,” _i.e._, take your life,—a common threat in low neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\n~Swingeing~, large, huge, powerful. As a SWINGEING blow, SWINGEING\r\ndamages, &c.\r\n\r\n~Swipe~, at cricket, to hit hard with a full swing of the bat. Most\r\nprobably a condensation of “wipe swingeing” or “swinging wipe.”\r\n\r\n~Swipes~, sour or small beer. SWIPE, to drink.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Swipey~ (from SWIPES), intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~Swish~, to flog, derived perhaps from the sound. Maybe, a corruption of\r\nSWITCH.\r\n\r\n~Swished~, or SWITCHED, married.\r\n\r\n~Swivel-eye~, a squinting eye.\r\n\r\n~Swizzle~, small beer, drink.\r\n\r\n~Swot~, mathematics; also, a mathematician; as a verb, to work hard for\r\nan examination, to be diligent in one’s studies.—_Army._\r\n\r\nThis word originated at the great slang manufactory for the army, the\r\nRoyal Military College, Sandhurst, in the broad Scotch pronunciation by\r\nDr. Wallace, one of the Professors, of the word sweat. It has since\r\nbecome fashionable at the Universities.\r\n\r\n~Syce~, a groom.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~T~, “to suit to a T,” to fit to a nicety.—_Old._ Perhaps from the\r\nT-square of carpenters, by which the accuracy of work is tested.\r\n\r\n~Tabby party~, a party consisting entirely of women, a tea and tattle\r\ngathering. In America, a gathering of men only is called a “stag party.”\r\n\r\n~Tabooed~, forbidden. This word, now very common, is derived from a\r\ncustom of the South-Sea islanders, first noticed in _Cook’s Voyages_.\r\n\r\n~Tack~, a taste foreign to what was intended; a barrel may get a TACK\r\nupon it, either permanently mouldy, sour, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n~Tacked~, tied down. When a man has another vanquished, or for certain\r\nreasons bound to his service, he is said to have “got him TACKED.”\r\n\r\n~Tackle~, clothes.—_Sea._ Also to encounter a person in argument.\r\n\r\n~Taffy~ (corruption of David), a Welshman. Compare Sawney (from\r\nAlexander), a Scotchman; Paddy (from Patrick), an Irishman; and Johnny\r\n(from John Bull), an Englishman.\r\n\r\n~Tag-rag-and-bobtail~, a mixed crowd of low people, the lower orders\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n~Tail-block~, a watch.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Tail-buzzer~, a thief who picks coat-pockets.\r\n\r\n~Tail-down~, “to get the TAIL DOWN,” generally means to lose courage.\r\nWhen a professional at any game loses heart in a match he is said to get\r\nhis TAIL DOWN. “His TAIL was quite DOWN, and it was all over.” The\r\norigin is obvious.\r\n\r\n~Take~, to succeed, or be patronized. “Do you think the new opera will\r\nTAKE?” “No, because the same company TOOK so badly under the old\r\nmanagement.” “To TAKE on,” to grieve; Shakspeare uses the word TAKING in\r\nthis sense. To “TAKE up for any one,” to protect or defend a person; “to\r\nTAKE off,” to mimic; “to TAKE heart,” to have courage; “to TAKE down a\r\npeg or two,” to humiliate, or tame; “to TAKE up,” to reprove; “to TAKE\r\nafter,” to resemble; “to TAKE in,” to cheat or defraud, probably from\r\nthe lower class lodging-house-keepers’ advertisements, “Single men TAKEN\r\nin and done for,”—an engagement which is as frequently performed in a\r\nbad as a good sense; in reference to this performance, Scripture is\r\noften quoted: “I was a stranger and ye TOOK me in.” “To TAKE the field,”\r\nwhen said of a general, to commence operations against the enemy. When a\r\nracing man TAKES the field he stakes his money against the favourite,\r\nthat is, he takes the chances of the field against the chance of one\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n~Take beef~, to run away.\r\n\r\n~Take in~, a cheating or swindling transaction,—sometimes termed “a\r\ndead TAKE IN.” Shakspeare has TAKE IN in the sense of conquering. To be\r\n“had,” or to be “spoken to,” were formerly synonymous phrases with to be\r\nTAKEN IN.\r\n\r\n~Take it out~, to obtain value for money, labour, &c. A rich man is said\r\nto “TAKE IT (_i.e._, his money) OUT in fine footmen, fine feeding,” &c.\r\nA poor man “TAKES IT (_i.e._, his trouble) OUT in drink.”\r\n\r\n~Talking~, a stable term, of a milder kind, applied to those horses\r\nwhich are addicted to ROARING. _See_ the latter expression.\r\n\r\n~Talk shop~, to intrude oneself or one’s private business too freely\r\ninto conversation. Any one who does this is said to be shoppy.\r\n\r\n~Tall~, extensive, exaggerated,—generally applied to conversation, as\r\n“loud” is to dress, or personal appearance; “TALL talk that,” _i.e._,\r\nconversation too boastful or high-flown to be true. Among pedestrians a\r\ngreat rate of speed is spoken of as TALL.\r\n\r\n~Tally~, five dozen bunches of turnips.—_Costermongers’ term._\r\n\r\n~Tally~, “to live TALLY,” to live in a state of unmarried impropriety;\r\nTALLY-WIFE, a woman who cohabits with a man to whom she is not married.\r\n\r\n~Tallyman~, an accommodating salesman who takes payment by instalments\r\nto suit the convenience of the purchaser, but who is anything but\r\naccommodating when payments are irregular. TALLYMEN are the cause of\r\nmuch misfortune to the working classes, from their high and exorbitant\r\nrates, and the temptations they offer to weak-minded women, who purchase\r\nin haste and repent at leisure.\r\n\r\n~Tan~, to beat or thrash; “I’ll TAN your hide,” _i.e._, I’ll give you a\r\ngood beating.\r\n\r\n~Tan~, an order to pull.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Tanner~, a sixpence. Perhaps _Gipsy_, TAWNO, little, or _Latin_, TENER,\r\nslender.\r\n\r\n~Tanny~, or TEENY, little. _Gipsy_, TAWNO, little.\r\n\r\n~Tantrems~, pranks, capers, frolicking; from the _Tarantula_ dance.\r\n_See_ account of the involuntary frenzy and motions caused by the bite\r\nof the tarantula in Italy.—_Penny Cyclopædia._\r\n\r\n~Tantrums~, ill-tempers. “He’s in his TANTRUMS this morning,” is often\r\nsaid of a peevish, querulous man. They are not peculiar to the one sex,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n~Tap the Admiral~, to suck liquor from a cask by means of a straw, said\r\nto have been done with the rum-cask in which Lord Nelson’s body was\r\nbrought to England, to such an extent as to leave the gallant Admiral\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n~Tap-tub~, the _Morning Advertiser_,—so called by vulgar people from\r\nthe fact that this daily newspaper is the principal organ of the London\r\nbrewers and publicans. Sometimes termed the _Gin and Gospel Gazette_,\r\nthough this title is fast fading out since the paper has been in the\r\nhands of its present editor.\r\n\r\n~Tape~, gin,—term with female servants. Also, a military term used in\r\nbarracks when no spirits are allowed. _See_ RIBBON.\r\n\r\n~Taper~, to give over gradually, to run short.\r\n\r\n~Taradiddle~, a falsehood.\r\n\r\n~Tar-brush~, a person whose complexion indicates a mixture of negro\r\nblood, is said to have had a lick of the TAR-BRUSH. Sometimes a man of\r\nthis description is said to have been dipped in the black-pot, and he is\r\noften reminded that “another dip would have done it,” _i.e._, another\r\ndip would have made a negro of him.\r\n\r\n~Tar-out~, to punish, to serve out.\r\n\r\n~Tarpaulin~, a sailor.\r\n\r\n~Tartar~, a savage fellow, an “ugly customer.” To “catch a TARTAR,” is\r\nto discover somewhat unpleasantly that a person is by no means so mild\r\nor good-tempered as he or she at first appeared.\r\n\r\n~Tat-box~, a dice-box.\r\n\r\n~Tater~, “s’elp my TATER,” an evasion of a profane oath, sometimes\r\nvaried by “s’elp my greens.”\r\n\r\n~Tatler~, a watch; “nimming a TATLER,” stealing a watch.\r\n\r\n~Tats~, dice.\r\n\r\n~Tats~, old rags; milky TATS, white rags.\r\n\r\n~Tatterdemalion~, a ragged fellow.\r\n\r\n~Tatting~, gathering old rags.\r\n\r\n~Tattoo~, a pony.—_Anglo-Indian._\r\n\r\n~Taw~, a large or principal marble; “I’ll be one on your TAW,” I will\r\npay you out, or be even with you,—a simile taken from boys aiming\r\nalways at winning the TAW when playing at marbles.\r\n\r\n~Tea-fight~, an evening party, alias a “muffin-worry.”\r\n\r\n~Tea-spoon~, five thousand pounds. _See_ SPOONS.\r\n\r\n~Teagueland~, Ireland. From the national character of the name TEAGUE.\r\n\r\n~Teeth~, “he has cut his eye TEETH,” _i.e._, is old and ’cute enough.\r\n\r\n~Teeth-drawing~, wrenching off knockers. Medical students’ term.\r\n\r\n~Teddy Hall~, St. Edmund Hall.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Teetotaller~, a total abstainer from alcoholic drinks. The origin of\r\nthis term is not known. It is said to be from the expression of a\r\nfanatical and stuttering enthusiast in the cause of total abstinence. It\r\nhas nothing to do with tea.\r\n\r\n~Teetotally~, amplification of TOTALLY.\r\n\r\n~Te-he~, to titter, “Upon this I TE-HE’D.”—_Madame d’Arblay._ As an\r\ninterjection it is as old as Chaucer. _See Miller’s Tale_:—\r\n\r\n    “TE-HE, quod she, and clapt the window to.”\r\n\r\n~Tell on~, to tell about, to talk of, to inform against. (This is formed\r\nby a simple misuse of the preposition.)\r\n\r\n~Ten commandments~, a virago’s fingers, or nails. Often heard in a\r\nfemale street disturbance. “I’ll leave the TEN COMMANDMENTS marked on\r\nhis chump,” shows that the term may be applied to either the fingers or\r\nthe scratchings. It would be a strange hand, however, that, with the\r\nbest opportunity, could made five marks simultaneously.\r\n\r\n~Tench~, the Penitentiary, of which it is a contraction. _See_ STEEL.\r\n\r\n~Tenpence to the shilling~, a vulgar phrase denoting a deficiency in\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\n~Testamur~, the slip of paper on which the examiners testify\r\n(testari) to the fact that the candidate has satisfied their\r\nrequirements.—_University._\r\n\r\n~Tester~, sixpence. From TESTONE, a shilling in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., but a sixpence in the time of Queen Elizabeth.—_Shakspeare._\r\n_French_, TESTE, or TÊTE, the head of the monarch on the coin.\r\n\r\n~Teviss~, a shilling. Costermongers’ and tramps’ term.\r\n\r\n~Thatch~, the human hair. “He’s well THATCHED,” is said of a man with a\r\ngood head of hair.\r\n\r\n~The Tavern~, New Inn Hall.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~The thing~, the style, the proper proportion. Application varied. A\r\ngood appearance, a decent dinner, or a fair bottle of wine, is said to\r\nbe “the THING,” sometimes “the correct THING.”\r\n\r\n~Thick~, intimate, familiar. The Scotch use the word “chief” in this\r\nsense, as, “the two are very chief now.”\r\n\r\n~Thick;~ “to lay it on THICK,” to flatter unduly, to surfeit with praise\r\nor adulation.\r\n\r\n~Thick un~, a sovereign; originally a crown piece, or five shillings.\r\n\r\n~Thimble~, or YACK, a watch.—_Prison Cant._\r\n\r\n~Thimble-rig~, a noted cheating game some years back, played at fairs\r\nand places of great public thronging, consisting of two or three\r\nthimbles rapidly and dexterously placed over a pea. The THIMBLE-RIGGER,\r\nsuddenly ceasing, asks under which thimble the pea is to be found. Any\r\none not a practised hand would lose nine times out of ten any bet he\r\nmight happen to make with him. The pea is generally concealed under his\r\nnail. THIMBLE-RIGGING has of late years given way to “broad-working.”\r\n\r\n~Thimble-twisters~, thieves who rob persons of their watches.\r\n\r\n~Thingumy~, THINGUMBOB, expressions used for the name of a thing which\r\ncannot be recollected at the instant.\r\n\r\n~Thin-skinned~, over-nice, petulant, apt to get a “raw.” _See_ that\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n~Three-cornered scraper~, a cocked hat.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Three sheets in the wind~, unsteady from drink.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Three-up~, a gambling game played by costers and others of like grade.\r\nThree halfpennies are thrown up by one man to the call of another. If\r\nthey do not come all alike, the cry is void, and the calling and tossing\r\nare resumed. When the three coins are all alike they are said to “come\r\noff,” and then all bets are decided according to the success or failure\r\nof the caller. When two men toss, they play “up for up,” _i.e._, they\r\ntoss and cry alternately. When three or more join in, the gathering is\r\nnamed a school, and one man, who is called a pieman, cries to the\r\nhalfpence of the others until he loses, when the winner of the toss\r\nbecomes pieman in turn.\r\n\r\n~Through~, finished. In America, where this word is most used in the\r\nsense now given, a guest who has had enough will, when asked to take\r\nmore, say, “I’m THROUGH,” which is certainly preferable to the other\r\nAmericanism, “crammed.”\r\n\r\n~Thrummer~, a threepenny bit.\r\n\r\n~Thrums~, threepence. Also, in Coventry, remnants and waste pieces of\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\n~Thrups~, threepence. _See_ the preceding, which is more general.\r\n\r\n~Thud~, the dull, dead sound made by the fall of a heavy body, or the\r\nstriking of a bullet against any soft, fleshy substance.\r\n\r\n~Thumper~, a magnificently constructed lie, a lie about which there is\r\nno stint of imaginative power.\r\n\r\n~Thumping~, large, fine, or strong.\r\n\r\n~Thunderbomb~, an imaginary ship of vast size. _See_ MERRY DUN OF DOVER.\r\n\r\n~Thunderer~, the _Times_ newspaper, sometimes termed “the THUNDERER of\r\nPrinting House Square,” from the locality where it is printed.\r\n\r\n~Thundering~, large, extra-sized.\r\n\r\n~Tibbing out~, going out of bounds.—_Charterhouse._\r\n\r\n~Tibby~, the head. Street slang, with no known etymology. To drop on\r\none’s TIBBY is to frighten or startle any one, to take one unawares.\r\n\r\n~Tib’s eve~, “neither before Christmas nor after,” an indefinite period;\r\nlike the Greek Kalends, TIB’S EVE has a future application; an\r\nindefinite period of past time is sometimes said to be “when Adam was an\r\noakum-boy in Chatham Dockyard.” “The reign of Queen Dick” is another\r\nform of this kind of expression, and is used to indicate either past\r\ntime or future.\r\n\r\n~Tick~, credit, trust. Johnson says it is a corruption of\r\n“ticket,”—tradesmen’s bills being formerly written on tickets or cards.\r\nOn TICK, therefore, is equivalent to on TICKET, or on trust. In use in\r\n1668, and before, as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “No matter upon landing whether you have money or no—you may swim\r\n    in twentie of their boats over the river upon TICKET.”—_Decker’s\r\n    Gulls’ Hornbook_, 1609.\r\n\r\n~Ticker~, a watch. Formerly cant, now street slang.\r\n\r\n~Ticket~, “that’s the TICKET,” _i.e._, that’s what is wanted, or what is\r\nbest. Probable corruption of “that’s _etiquette_,” or, perhaps, from\r\nTICKET, a bill or invoice. This phrase is sometimes extended into\r\n“that’s the TICKET for soup,” in allusion to the card given to beggars\r\nfor immediate relief at soup kitchens. _See_ TICK.\r\n\r\n~Tickle~, to puzzle; “a reg’lar TICKLER” is a poser.\r\n\r\n~Tiddlywink~, slim, puny; sometimes TILLYWINK.\r\n\r\n~Tidy~, tolerably, or pretty well; “How did you get on to-day?”—“Oh,\r\nTIDY.”—_Saxon._\r\n\r\n~Tie~, a dead heat. A game of any kind, in which the possibility exists,\r\nis said to end in a tie, if the markings are level on each side at the\r\nfinish. In racing parlance, all level finishes are called dead-heats.\r\n\r\n~Tied up~, given over, finished; also married, in allusion to the\r\nhymeneal knot, unless a jocose allusion be intended to the “halter”\r\n(altar). _See_ BUCKLED, term in use among costermongers and street folk\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n~Tiff~, a pet, a fit of ill humour.\r\n\r\n~Tiffin~, a breakfast, _déjeûner à la fourchette_.—_Anglo-Indian\r\nSlang._\r\n\r\n~Tiffy~, easily offended, apt to be annoyed.\r\n\r\n~Tiger~, a parasite; also a term for a ferocious woman; a boy employed\r\nto wait on gentlemen—one who waits on ladies is a page.\r\n\r\n~Tiger~, a superlative yell. “Three cheers, and the last in\r\nTIGERS.”—_American._ To “fight the TIGER” is also American, and refers\r\nto gambling with professionals—dangerous pastime.\r\n\r\n~Tight~, close, stingy; hard up, short of cash; TIGHT, spruce, strong,\r\nactive; “a TIGHT lad,” a smart, active young fellow; TIGHT, drunk, or\r\nnearly so, generally the result of “going on the loose;” “TIGHT-laced,”\r\npuritanical, over-precise. Money is said to be TIGHT when the public,\r\nfrom want of confidence in the aspect of affairs, are not inclined to\r\nspeculate.\r\n\r\n~Tightener~, a dinner, or hearty meal. _See_ SPITALFIELDS’ BREAKFAST.\r\n\r\n~Tike-~, or BUFFER-LURKING, dog-stealing.\r\n\r\n~Tile~, a hat, a covering for the head.\r\n\r\n    “I’m a gent, I’m a gent,\r\n      In the Regent-Street style,—\r\n    Examine my costume,\r\n      And look at my TILE.”—_Popular Song._\r\n\r\nSometimes used in another sense, “having a TILE loose,” _i.e._, being\r\nslightly crazy. _See_ PANTILE.\r\n\r\n~Timber merchant~, or SPUNK FENCER, a lucifer-match seller.\r\n\r\n~Timber-toes~, a wooden-legged man. Also at the East-end one who wears\r\nclogs, _i.e._, wooden soled boots.\r\n\r\n~Time~, cabman’s slang for money. If they wish to express 9s. 9d. they\r\nsay that “it is a quarter to ten;” if 3s. 6d., half-past three; if 11s.\r\n9d. a quarter to twelve. Cab-drivers can hardly have originated a system\r\nwhich has been in existence as long as the adage, “Time is money.” They\r\nhave, however, the full use of the arrangement, which is perhaps the\r\nsimplest on record.\r\n\r\n~Time~, TO DO, to work out a sentence of imprisonment. Time is the\r\ngeneric term for all quantities of incarceration, whether short or long.\r\nSometimes stir-time (imprisonment in the House of Correction) is\r\ndistinguished from the more extended system of punishment which is\r\ncalled “pinnel (penal) time.”\r\n\r\n~Time o’ day~, a dodge, the latest aspect of affairs; “that’s your TIME\r\nO’ DAY,” _i.e._, that’s well done; to put a person up to the TIME O’\r\nDAY, or let him know “what’s o’clock,” is to instruct him in the\r\nknowledge needful for him.\r\n\r\n~Tin~, money,—generally applied to silver.\r\n\r\n~Tinge~, the per-centage allowed by drapers and clothiers to their\r\nassistants upon the sale of old-fashioned articles. _See_ SPIFFS.\r\n\r\n~Tinkler~, a bell. “Jerk the TINKLER,” ring the bell. Refined or\r\naffected slangists sometimes say, “Agitate the communicator,” which,\r\nthough it represents “ring the bell,” should more properly mean “pull\r\nthe cord.”\r\n\r\n~Tin-pot~, “he plays a TIN-POT game,” _i.e._, a low, mean, or shabby\r\ngame. In the _Contes d’Eutrapel_, a French officer at the siege of\r\nChatillon is ridiculously spoken of as Captain TIN-POT—_Capitaine du\r\nPot d’Etain_. TIN-POT, as generally used, means worthless. As applied to\r\nbilliards and kindred games, it means pretentious and inferior play.\r\n\r\n~Tip~, advice or information respecting anything, but mostly used in\r\nreference to horse-racing, so that the person TIPPED may know how to bet\r\nto the best advantage.

Of late years a “straight TIP”\r\nmeans a direct hint on any subject.\r\n\r\n~Tip~, a douceur; “that’s the TIP,” _i.e._, that’s the proper thing to\r\ndo. “To miss one’s TIP,” to fail in a scheme.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Tip~, to give, lend, or hand over anything to another person; “come,\r\nTIP up the tin,” _i.e._, hand up the money; “TIP the wink,” to inform by\r\nwinking; “TIP us your fin,” _i.e._, give me your hand; “TIP one’s boom\r\noff,” to make off, or depart.

Professor Ingledue, M.A., the mesmerist, is\r\n    silent; and if their subscribers, ‘for whose interests I have\r\n    collected my old and able staff, with many additional ones, who are\r\n    already at work in the training districts,’ could only get a sight\r\n    of the ‘old and able staff,’ they would find it consisting of a man\r\n    and a boy, at work in the back room of a London public-house, and\r\n    sending different winners for every race to their\r\n    subscribers.”—_Post and Paddock_, by the “Druid.”\r\n\r\nThere are, however, whatever non-racing men may think, many “touts”\r\nwhose information is valuable to even the “best informed” writers.\r\n\r\n~Tit~, a favourite name for a horse.\r\n\r\n    “They scorned the coach, they scorned the rails,\r\n    Two spanking tits with streaming tails,\r\n    Them swiftly onward drew.”—_End of All Things._\r\n\r\n~Tit for tat~, an equivalent.\r\n\r\n~Titivate~, to put in order, or dress up. Originally TIDY-VATE.\r\n\r\n~Titley~, drink, generally applied to intoxicating beverages.\r\n\r\n~Titter~, a girl; “nark the TITTER,” _i.e._, look at the girl.—_Tramp’s\r\nterm._\r\n\r\n~Tizzy~, a sixpence. Corruption of TESTER.\r\n\r\n~Toad-in-the-hole~, a kind of pudding, consisting of small pieces of\r\nmeat immersed in batter, and baked. Also, a term applied to\r\nperambulating advertising mediums. _See_ SANDWICH.\r\n\r\n~Toasting-fork~, a regulation sword, indicative of the general\r\nuselessness of that weapon.\r\n\r\n~Toby~, the road. The highwayman or swell robber was in old days said to\r\nbe on the high TOBY, from the high or main road, while those meaner\r\nfellows, the footpad and the cutpurse, were but “low TOBY-MEN,” from\r\ntheir frequenting the by-ways.\r\n\r\n~To-do~ (pronounced quickly, and as one word), a disturbance, trouble;\r\n“here’s a pretty TO-DO,” here is an unpleasant difficulty. This exactly\r\ntallies with the _French_, AFFAIRE (_à faire_).—_See Forby’s Vocabulary\r\nof East Anglia_.\r\n\r\n~To the nines~, to the dodges of the day. “He’s up to the NINES,” means\r\nhe’s up to everything. “Dressed to the NINES,” means dressed loudly, or,\r\nas it is more generally known now, “dressed to death.”\r\n\r\n~Toddle~, to walk as a child.\r\n\r\n~Toe~, to kick. “I’ll TOE your backside.” Common in London.\r\n\r\n~Toff~, a dandy, a swell of rank.

Possibly from a system of barter\r\ncarried on between sailors and aborigines.\r\n\r\n~Tol-lol~, or TOL-LOLLISH, tolerable, or tolerably.\r\n\r\n~Toll-shop~, a Yorkshire correspondent gives this word as denoting in\r\nthat county a prison, and also the following verse of a song, popular at\r\nfairs in the East Riding:—\r\n\r\n    “But if ivver he get out agean,\r\n    And can but raise a frind,\r\n    Oh! the divel may tak’ TOLL-SHOP,\r\n    At Beverley town-end!”\r\n\r\nThis is but a variation of the Scottish TOLBOOTH.\r\n\r\n~Tom~, _e.g._, “after TOM,” after the hour at which Big TOM of\r\nChristchurch rings. At its last stroke the gates are closed, and\r\nundergrads entering after have to pay an increasing sum for each hour up\r\nto twelve. To be out after that involves an interview with the\r\nMaster.—_Oxford University._\r\n\r\n~Tom and Jerry shop~, a low drinking shop.

From the stable term for aged horses which have lost the\r\ndistinguishing marks in their teeth.\r\n\r\n~Tootsies~, feet, those of ladies and children in particular.

TOPPER-HUNTERS are men\r\nwho pick up cigar ends and odd pieces of stale tobacco, which they mix\r\nand chop up for home consumption or sale.\r\n\r\n~Topsy-turvy~, the bottom upwards. Grose gives an ingenious etymology of\r\nthis once cant term, viz., “top-side turf-ways,”—turf being always laid\r\nthe wrong side upwards. This is so far ingenious that it creates a fact\r\nfor the purpose of arguing from it. Turfs are laid with the grass part\r\ntogether during carriage; so, anyhow, the definition could be only half\r\nright. In fact, TOPSY-TURVY is but short for “top-side t’other way.”\r\n\r\n~To-rights~, excellent, very well, or good.—_Low London slang._\r\n\r\n~Tormentors~, the large iron flesh-forks used by cooks at sea.\r\n\r\n~Torpids~, the second-class race-boats at Oxford, answering to the\r\nCambridge “sloggers.”\r\n\r\n~Toshers~, men who steal copper from ships’ bottoms in the Thames.\r\n\r\n~Toss~, a measure of sprats.—_Billingsgate._\r\n\r\n~Tot~, a small glass; a “TOT o’ whisky” is the smallest quantity sold.\r\n\r\n~Tot-up~, to add together,—as columns of figures, £ _s._ _d._ From\r\nTOTAL-UP, through the vulgarism TOTTLE.\r\n\r\n~Totting~, bone-picking, either peripatetically or at the dust-heaps.\r\n“TOT” is a bone, but chiffoniers and cinder-hunters generally are called\r\nTOT-PICKERS nowadays.

Thus, “He’s a\r\nTOUCH-AND-GO sort of fellow. Be careful of him.”\r\n\r\n~Toucher~, “as near as a TOUCHER,” as near as possible without actually\r\ntouching.—_Coaching term._ The old Jarveys, to show their skill, used\r\nto drive against things so closely as absolutely to touch, yet without\r\ninjury. This they called a TOUCHER, or TOUCH-AND-GO, which was hence\r\napplied to anything which was within an ace of ruin.\r\n\r\n~Touchy~, peevish, irritable. Johnson terms it a low word.\r\n\r\n~Tout.~ In sporting phraseology a TOUT signifies an agent in the\r\ntraining districts, on the look-out for information as to the condition\r\nand capabilities of those horses entering for a coming race. TOUTS often\r\nget into trouble through entering private training-grounds. They,\r\nhowever, are very highly paid, some making 40_l._ or 50_l._ a week\r\nduring the season. Now frequently called horse-watchers.\r\n\r\n~Tout~, to look out, or watch.\r\n\r\n~Touter~, a looker out, one who waits at railway stations and steamboat\r\npiers, and touts for customers; a hotel runner. Term in general use.\r\n\r\n~Touzle~, to romp with or rumple.—_Scotch._\r\n\r\n~Towel~, to beat or whip.

When Bruin is\r\nTREED, or is forced up a TREE by the dogs, it means that then the tug of\r\nwar begins. _See_ ’COON. Hence when an opponent is fairly run to bay,\r\nand can by no evasion get off, he is said to be TREED. These expressions\r\noriginated with Colonel Crockett, of backwoods celebrity. In Scotland\r\nthe phrase is “up a close,” _i.e._, up a passage with no outlet, a\r\n_cul-de-sac_, therefore suggestive of an unpleasant predicament.\r\n\r\n~Triangles~, a slang term for _delirium tremens_, during a fit of which\r\neverything appears out of the square.\r\n\r\n~Trimmings~, the necessary adjuncts to anything cooked, but specially\r\napplied to a boiled leg of mutton, as turnips, potatoes, bread, beer,\r\nsalt, &c. Bets are frequently made for a leg of mutton and TRIMMINGS. Or\r\none person will forfeit the mutton if another will “stand the\r\nTRIMMINGS.” It is generally a supper feast, held in a public-house, and\r\nthe rule is for the landlord to charge as TRIMMINGS everything, except\r\nthe mutton, placed on the table previous to the removal of the cloth. A\r\nboiled leg o’ mutton and TRIMMINGS will be always known as a “swarry” to\r\nadmirers of Sam Weller.\r\n\r\n~Tripes~, the bowels.\r\n\r\n    “Next morning Miss Dolly complained of her TRIPES,\r\n    Drinking cold water had given her gripes.”\r\n\r\n~Trollies~, or TROLLY-CARTS, term given by costermongers to a species of\r\nnarrow carts, which can either be drawn by a donkey or driven by hand.\r\n\r\n~Trolling~, sauntering or idling, hence TROLL and TROLLOCKS, an idle\r\nslut, a “moll,” which _see_.\r\n\r\n~Trollop~, a slatternly woman, a prostitute.\r\n\r\n~Trot~, to “run up,” to oppose, to bid against at an auction.

The phrase refers to “two eyes upon ten fingers,” shortened\r\nas a money term to TWO PUN’ TEN. When a supposed thief is present, one\r\nshopman asks the other if that TWO PUN’ (pound) TEN matter was ever\r\nsettled.

One\r\nexplanation of the phrase is this:—“Years ago there was a person named\r\nWalker, an aquiline-nosed Jew, who exhibited an orrery, which he called\r\nby the erudite name of ‘Eidouranion.’ He was also a popular lecturer on\r\nastronomy, and often, telescope in hand, invited his pupils to ‘take a\r\nsight’ at the moon and stars. The lecturer’s phrase struck his schoolboy\r\nauditory, who frequently ‘took a sight’ with that gesture of\r\noutstretched arm and adjustment to nose and eye which was the first\r\ngarnish of the popular saying. The next step was to assume phrase and\r\ngesture as the outward and visible mode of knowingness in general.” This\r\nhas been denied, however, and a statement made that HOOKEY WALKER was a\r\nmagistrate of dreaded acuteness and incredulity, whose hooked nose gave\r\nthe title of “beak” to all his successors; it is also said, moreover,\r\nthat the gesture of applying the thumb to the nose and agitating the\r\nlittle finger, as an expression of “Don’t you wish you may get it?” is\r\nconsiderably older than the first story would seem to indicate. There\r\nare many and various explanations of the term, given according to the\r\ndevelopment of fancy.—_Notes and Queries_, iv. 425.\r\n\r\n~Walking the pegs~, a method of cheating at the game of cribbage, by a\r\nspecies of legerdemain, the sharper either moving his own pegs forward,\r\nor those of his antagonist backward, according to the state of the game.\r\n\r\n~Wallflower~, a person who goes to a ball and looks on without dancing,\r\neither from choice or through not being able to obtain a partner.

When a man in Australia\r\nis “on the road” looking for employment, he is said to be on the\r\nWALLABEE-TRACK.\r\n\r\n~Wallop~, to beat, or thrash. John Gough Nichols derives this word from\r\nan ancestor of the Earl of Portsmouth, one Sir John Wallop, Knight of\r\nthe Garter, who in King Henry VIII.’s time distinguished himself by\r\nWALLOPING the French; but it is more probably connected with wheal, a\r\nlivid swelling in the skin after a blow. _See_ POT-WALLOPER.\r\n\r\n~Walloping~, a beating or thrashing; sometimes used in an adjective\r\nsense, as big, or very large.\r\n\r\n~Wapping~, or WHOPPING, of a large size, great.\r\n\r\n~Warm~, rich, or well off.\r\n\r\n~Warm~, to thrash or beat; “I’ll WARM your jacket.” To WARM the wax of\r\none’s ear is to give a severe blow on the side of the head.

(From the reports of a celebrated\r\ntrial for gold robbery on the South-Western Railway.) Other similar\r\nreplies are, “I have been making a trundle for a goose’s eye,” or a\r\n“whim-wham to bridle a goose.” Sometimes a man will describe himself as\r\n“a doll’s-eye WEAVER.”\r\n\r\n~Wedge~, silver.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Wedge-feeder~, a silver spoon.\r\n\r\n~Weed~, a cigar; _the_ WEED, tobacco generally.\r\n\r\n~Weed~, a hatband.\r\n\r\n~Weight-for-age~, a sporting phrase which, applied to a race,\r\ndistinguishes it from a handicap or catch-weight event, and informs all\r\ninterested that the animals which run carry according to their ages, and\r\nnot their abilities. Winners of certain great races generally carry\r\npenalties in addition to WEIGHT-FOR-AGE, for the purpose of equalizing\r\nmatters somewhat; but as a rule the results are fairly foreshadowed as\r\nsoon as in these races the horses are at the post, or as soon as the\r\nstarters are positively known.\r\n\r\n~Wejee~, a chimney-pot. Often applied to any clever invention, as,\r\n“That’s a regular WEJEE.”\r\n\r\n~Welcher~, a person who makes a bet without the remotest chance of being\r\nable to pay, and, losing it, absconds, or “makes himself scarce.” In the\r\nbetting ring a WELCHER is often very severely handled upon his swindling\r\npractices being discovered. The Catterick “Clerk of the Course” once\r\nprovided some stout labourers and a tar-barrel for the special benefit\r\nof the WELCHERS who might visit that neighbourhood. The word is modern,\r\nbut the practice is ancient.\r\n\r\n    “One Moore, the unworthy incumbent of the ‘Suffolk curacy,’\r\n    dedicated a book to ‘Duke Humphrey,’ and was then entirely lost\r\n    sight of by his old college friends, till one of them espied him\r\n    slung up in ‘the basket,’ for not paying his bets at a\r\n    cock-pit.”—_Post and Paddock._\r\n\r\nOne writer says the term “arose from a fellow who took deposits on\r\naccount of Welsh ponies, which he said he was importing, and never\r\ndelivered them.” It is not unfrequently suggested by irreverent persons\r\nthat the word was suggested by the dislike his gracious Majesty George\r\nthe Fourth had, when a young man, for settling. Others derive it from\r\nthe nursery rhyme,\r\n\r\n    “Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief.”\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, from the days when the stout Earl of\r\nChester and others were constantly employed in checking and cutting off\r\nthe expeditions of their neighbours till comparatively recently, the\r\nterm “Welshman” has been hardly one of kindness. It is not hard,\r\ntherefore, to imagine its use on the Roodee, and its subsequent\r\ncorruption into WELCHER. The spelling of the word, WELCHER or WELSHER,\r\nis optional.\r\n\r\n~Well~, to pocket, to save money. Any one of fair income and miserly\r\nhabits is said to “WELL it.”\r\n\r\n~Welt~, to thrash with a strap or stick. Probably meaning to raise\r\nwheals.\r\n\r\n~West central~, a water-closet, the initials being the same as those of\r\nthe London Postal District. It is said that for this reason very\r\ndelicate people refuse to obey Rowland Hill’s instructions in this\r\nparticular. An old maid, who lived in this district, was particularly\r\nshocked at having W.C. marked on all her letters, and informed the\r\nletter-carrier that she could not think of submitting to such an\r\nindecent fashion. On being informed that the letters would not be\r\nforwarded without the obnoxious initials, she remarked that she would\r\nhave them left at the Post-Office. “Then, marm,” said the fellow, with a\r\ngrin, “they will put P.O. on them, which will be more ondacenter than\r\nthe tother.”\r\n\r\n~Wet~, a drink, a drain.\r\n\r\n~Wet~, to drink. Low people generally ask an acquaintance to WET any\r\nrecently purchased article, _i.e._, to stand treat on the occasion. “WET\r\n(originally WHET, to sharpen,) your whistle,” _i.e._, take a drink; “WET\r\nthe other eye,” _i.e._, take another glass. _See_ SHED A TEAR.\r\n\r\n~Wet Quaker~, a man who pretends to be religious, and is a dram-drinker\r\non the sly.\r\n\r\n~Wet un~, a diseased cow, unfit for human food, but nevertheless sold to\r\nmake into sausages. _Compare_ STAGGERING-BOB.\r\n\r\n~Whack~, a share or lot. “Give me my WHACK,” give me my\r\nshare.—_Scotch_, SWEG, _or_ SWACK.\r\n\r\n~Whack~, or WHACKING, a blow, or a thrashing.\r\n\r\n~Whack~, to beat.\r\n\r\n~Whacker~, a lie of unusual dimensions, sometimes called a “round un.”\r\n\r\n~Whacking~, large, fine, or strong.\r\n\r\n~Whacks~, to go WHACKS, to divide equally; to enter into partnership.\r\n\r\n~Whale~, “very like a WHALE,” said of anything that is very improbable.\r\nA speech of Polonius’s in _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\n~What d’yecall’em~, a similar expression to “thingumy.”\r\n\r\n~Wheeze~, a joke, an anecdote, or dialogue, not strictly connected with\r\na piece that is being played, but introduced by an actor, sometimes with\r\nthe assistance and for the benefit of others. The dialogues which take\r\nplace between the songs at nigger entertainments are also known as\r\nWHEEZES. The word actually means a new notion as applied to dialogue.\r\n\r\n~Wherret~, or WORRIT, to scold, trouble, or annoy.—_Old English._\r\n\r\n~Whid~, a word. Sometimes, a fib, a falsehood, a word too much.—_Modern\r\nSlang_, from the ancient cant.\r\n\r\n~Whiddle~, to enter into a parley, or hesitate with many words, &c.; to\r\ninform, or discover. _See_ WHEEDLE.\r\n\r\n~Whim-wham~, an alliterative term, synonymous with fiddle-faddle,\r\nriff-raff, &c., denoting nonsense, rubbish, &c.\r\n\r\n~Whip~, after the usual allowance of wine is drunk at mess, those who\r\nwish for more put a shilling each into a glass handed round to procure a\r\nfurther supply.

Generally used to express anything\r\ndishonestly taken.\r\n\r\n~Whip~, the member of the House of Commons whose duty it is to collect\r\nand keep together his party to vote at divisions. To give him greater\r\ninfluence, the ministerial WHIP holds, or is supposed to hold, the minor\r\npatronage of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n~Whipjack~, a sham shipwrecked sailor, called also a turnpike-sailor.\r\n\r\n~Whip the cat~, when an operative works at a private house by the day.\r\nTerm used amongst tailors and carpenters.\r\n\r\n~Whipper-snapper~, a waspish, diminutive person.\r\n\r\n~Whisper~, a tip given in secret, a rumour which is spread under the\r\npretence of its being a secret.

This last is a very old expression. Chaucer says of the\r\nMiller of Trumpington’s wife (_Canterbury Tales_, 4153)—\r\n\r\n    “So was hir joly WHISTAL well y-wet.”\r\n\r\n“To WHISTLE for anything,” to stand small chance of getting it, from the\r\nnautical custom of WHISTLING for a wind in a calm, which of course comes\r\nnone the sooner for it. “To pay for one’s WHISTLE,” to pay extravagantly\r\nfor any fancy.\r\n\r\n~Whistling-Billy~, or PUFFING-BILLY, a locomotive engine.\r\n\r\n~Whistling-shop~, a place in which spirits are sold without a licence.\r\n\r\n~Whitechapel~ or WESTMINSTER BROUGHAM, a costermonger’s donkey-barrow.\r\n\r\n~Whitechapel~, anything mean or paltry.

In\r\ntimes when great attention was paid to the breeding of game-cocks, a\r\nwhite feather in the tail was considered a proof of cross-breeding.\r\n\r\n~White horses~, the foam on the crests of waves, seen before or after a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n    “Now the wild white horses play.\r\n    Champ and chafe and toss in the spray.\r\n      Children, dear, let us away,\r\n      This way, this way.”—_Matthew Arnold._\r\n\r\n~White lie~, a harmless lie, one told to reconcile people at variance.\r\n“Mistress is not at home, sir,” is a WHITE LIE often told by servants.\r\n\r\n~White-livered~, or LIVER-FACED, cowardly, much afraid, very mean.\r\n\r\n~White prop~, a diamond pin.—_East London._\r\n\r\n~White satin~, gin,—term amongst women. _See_ SATIN.\r\n\r\n~White serjeant~, a man’s superior officer in the person of his better\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n~White tape~, gin,—term used principally by female servants. _See_\r\nRIBBON.\r\n\r\n~White un~, a silver watch.\r\n\r\n~White wine~, the fashionable term for gin.\r\n\r\n    “Jack Randall then impatient rose,\r\n      And said, ‘Tom’s speech were just as fine\r\n    If he would call that first of GOES\r\n      By that genteeler name—WHITE WINE.’”\r\n\r\n        _Randall’s Diary_, 1820.\r\n\r\n~Whitewash~, to rehabilitate.

Now said of a person\r\nwho compromises with his creditors.\r\n\r\n~Whitewash~, a glass of sherry as a finale, after drinking port and\r\nclaret.\r\n\r\n~Whittle~, to nose or peach.—_Old Cant._ To cut and hack as with a\r\npocket-knife.—_American._\r\n\r\n~Whop~, to beat, or hide. Corruption of WHIP; sometimes spelt WAP.\r\n\r\n~Whop-straw~, cant name for a countryman; Johnny WHOP-STRAW, in allusion\r\nto threshing.\r\n\r\n~Whopper~, a big one, a lie. A lie not easily swallowed.\r\n\r\n~Widdle~, to shine. _See_ OLIVER.\r\n\r\n~Wide-awake~, a broad-brimmed felt or stuff hat,—so called because it\r\nnever had a nap, and never wants one.\r\n\r\n~Wido~, wide awake, no fool.\r\n\r\n~Wife~, a fetter fixed to one leg.—_Prison._\r\n\r\n~Wiffle-woffles~, in the dumps, sorrow, stomach-ache.\r\n\r\n~Wig~, move off, go away.—_North Country Cant._\r\n\r\n~Wigging~, a rebuke before comrades. If the head of a firm calls a clerk\r\ninto the parlour, and rebukes him, it is an EARWIGGING; if done before\r\nthe other clerks, it is a WIGGING.\r\n\r\n~Wild~, a village.—_Tramps’ term._ _See_ VILE.\r\n\r\n~Wild~, vexed, cross, passionate,—said to be from WILLED (SELF-WILLED),\r\nin opposition to “tamed” or “subdued.” In the United States the word\r\n“mad” is supplemented with a vulgar meaning similar to our Cockneyism\r\nWILD; and to make a man mad on the other side of the Atlantic is to vex\r\nhim, or “rile” his temper—not to render him a raving maniac, or a fit\r\nsubject for Bedlam.\r\n\r\n~Wild Irishman~, the train between Euston and Holyhead, in connection\r\nwith the Kingstown mail-boats.\r\n\r\n~Wild oats~, youthful pranks. A fast young man is said to be “sowing his\r\nWILD OATS.”\r\n\r\n~William~, a bill. The derivation is obvious.\r\n\r\n~Willow~, a cricket-bat. From the material of which it is made. The\r\ngreat batsman, W. G. Grace, is often called “champion of the WILLOW.”\r\n\r\n~Wind~, “to raise the WIND,” to procure money; “to slip one’s WIND,” a\r\ncoarse expression, meaning to die. _See_ RAISE.\r\n\r\n~Wind~, “I’ll WIND your cotton,” _i.e._, I will give you some trouble.\r\nThe Byzantine General, Narses, used the same kind of threat to the Greek\r\nEmpress,—“I will spin a thread that they shall not be able to unravel.”\r\n\r\n~Windows~, the eyes, or “peepers.”\r\n\r\n~Winey~, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n~Winged~, hurt, but not dangerously, by a bullet. Originally to be shot\r\nin the arm or shoulder. To slightly wound birds is to WING them.\r\n\r\n~Winkin~, “he went off like WINKIN,” _i.e._, very quickly. From WINK, to\r\nshut the eye quickly.\r\n\r\n~Winks~, periwinkles.\r\n\r\n~Winn~, a penny—_Ancient Cant._ _See_ introductory chapter.\r\n\r\n~Wipe~, a pocket-handkerchief.—_Old Cant._\r\n\r\n~Wipe~, a blow. Frequently sibilated to SWIPE, a cricket-term.\r\n\r\n~Wipe~, to strike; “he fetcht me a WIPE over the knuckles,” he struck me\r\non the knuckles; “to WIPE a person down,” to flatter or pacify; “to wipe\r\noff a score,” to pay one’s debts, in allusion to the slate or chalk\r\nmethods of account-keeping; “to WIPE a person’s eye,” to shoot game\r\nwhich he has missed; hence to obtain an advantage by superior activity.\r\nWith old topers “WIPING one’s eye,” is equivalent to giving or taking\r\nanother drink.\r\n\r\n~Wipe-out~, to kill or utterly destroy. This is an Americanism, but is\r\nin pretty general use here.\r\n\r\n~Wire-in~, a London street phrase in general use, which means to go in\r\nwith a will. In its original form of “WIRE-IN, and get your name up,” it\r\nwas very popular among London professional athletes. The phrase is now\r\ngeneral, and any one who has a hard task before him, knows he must\r\nWIRE-IN to bring matters to a successful issue.\r\n\r\n~Wire-pullers~, powerful political partisans, who do their work from\r\n“behind the scenes.”\r\n\r\n~With and without~, words by themselves, supposed to denote the\r\nexistence or non-existence of sugar in grog. Generally “warm WITH” and\r\n“cold WITHOUT.”\r\n\r\n~Wobble-shop~, a shop where beer is sold without a licence.\r\n\r\n~Wobbler~, a foot soldier, a term of contempt used by cavalrymen.\r\n\r\n~Wobbly~, rickety, unsteady, ill-fitting.\r\n\r\n~Wolf~, to eat greedily.\r\n\r\n~Wooden spoon~, the last junior optime who takes a University\r\ndegree; denoting one who is only fit to stay at home, and stir\r\nporridge.—_Cambridge._ The expression is also parliamentary slang, and\r\nis applied to the member of the ministry whose name appears in the\r\ndivision lists least frequently. At the ministerial dinner annually held\r\nat Greenwich, such member sometimes has a wooden spoon presented to him.\r\n\r\n~Wooden surtout~, a coffin, generally spoken of as a WOODEN SURTOUT with\r\nnails for buttons.\r\n\r\n~Wooden wedge~, the last name in the classical honours’ list at\r\nCambridge. The last in mathematical honours had long been known as the\r\nWOODEN SPOON; but when the classical Tripos was instituted in 1824, it\r\nwas debated among the undergraduates what sobriquet should be given to\r\nthe last on the examination list. Curiously enough, the name that year\r\nwhich happened to be last was WEDGEWOOD (a distinguished Wrangler).\r\nHence the title.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~Wool~, courage, pluck; “you are not half-WOOLED,” term of reproach from\r\none thief to another.\r\n\r\n~Wool~, bravery, pluck. Term much in use among pugilists and their\r\nadmirers. The highest praise that can be bestowed on a man of courage in\r\nlower-class circles is that which characterizes him as being “a reg’lar\r\nwooled un,” or “a rare WOOL-TOPPED UN.” Derived from the great pluck and\r\nperseverance shown by many pugilists of whole or partial colour, from\r\nMolyneux down to Bob Travers.\r\n\r\n~Woolbird~, a lamb; “wing of a WOOLBIRD,” a shoulder of lamb.\r\n\r\n~Wool-gathering~, said of any person’s wits when they are wandering, or\r\nin a reverie.\r\n\r\n~Wool-hole~, the workhouse.\r\n\r\n~Woolly~, out of temper.\r\n\r\n~Woolly~, a blanket.\r\n\r\n~Work~, to plan, or lay down and execute any course of action, to\r\nperform anything; “to WORK the bulls,” _i.e._, to get rid of false crown\r\npieces; “to work the oracle,” to succeed by manœuvring, to concert a\r\nwily plan, to victimize,—a possible reference to the stratagems and\r\nbribes used to corrupt the Delphic oracle, and cause it to deliver a\r\nfavourable response. “To WORK a street or neighbourhood,” to try at each\r\nhouse to sell all one can, or to bawl so that every housewife may know\r\nwhat is to be sold. The general plan is to drive a donkey-barrow a short\r\ndistance, and then stop and cry. The term implies thoroughness; to “WORK\r\na street well” is a common saying with a coster. “To WORK a benefit” is\r\nto canvass among one’s friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\n~Worm.~ _See_ PUMP.\r\n\r\n~Worm~, a policeman.\r\n\r\n~Worming~, removing the beard of an oyster or mussel.\r\n\r\n~W. P.~, or WARMING-PAN. A clergyman who holds a living _pro tempore_,\r\nunder a bond of resignation, is styled a W. P., or WARMING-PAN rector,\r\nbecause he keeps the place warm for his successor. WARMING-PAN was a\r\nterm first popularly applied to a substitute in the reign of James II.\r\n\r\n~Wrinkle~, an idea, or a fancy; an additional piece of knowledge.\r\n\r\n~Write~, as “to WRITE one’s name on a joint,” to leave the impression of\r\none’s handiwork thereon, to have the first cut at anything; to leave\r\nvisible traces of one’s presence anywhere.\r\n\r\n~Wylo~, be off.—_Anglo-Chinese._\r\n\r\n~X.~, or LETTER X, a method of arrest used by policemen with desperate\r\nruffians,—by getting a firm grasp on the collar, and drawing the\r\ncaptive’s hand over the holding arm, and pressing the fingers down in a\r\npeculiar way—the captured person’s arm in this way can be more easily\r\nbroken than extricated.\r\n\r\n~Yack~, a watch; to “church a YACK,” to take it out of its case to avoid\r\ndetection, otherwise to “christen a YACK.”\r\n\r\n~Yaffle~, to eat.—_Old English._\r\n\r\n~Yahoo~, a person of coarse or degraded habits. Derived from the use of\r\nthe word by Swift.\r\n\r\n~Yam~, to eat. This word is used by the lowest class all over the world;\r\nby the Wapping sailor, West Indian negro, or Chinese coolie. When the\r\nfort, called the Dutch Folly, near Canton, was in course of erection by\r\nthe Hollanders, under the pretence of being intended for an hospital,\r\nthe Chinese observed a box containing muskets among the alleged hospital\r\nstores. “Hy-aw!” exclaimed John Chinaman, “How can sick man YAM gun?”\r\nThe Dutch were surprised and massacred the same night.\r\n\r\n~Yappy~, soft, foolish; mostly applied to an over-generous person, from\r\nthe fact that it originally meant one who paid for everything. YAP is\r\nback slang for pay, and often when a man is asked to pay more than he\r\nconsiders correct, he says, “Do you think I’m YAPPY?” do you think I’m\r\npaying mad? Thus slang begets slang.\r\n\r\n~Yard of clay~, a long, old-fashioned tobacco pipe; also called a\r\nchurchwarden.\r\n\r\n~Yarmouth capon~, a bloater, or red herring.\r\n\r\n~Yarmouth mittens~, bruised hands.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Yarn~, a long story, or tale; “a tough YARN,” a tale hard to be\r\nbelieved; “spin a YARN,” to tell a tale.—_Sea._\r\n\r\n~Yay-nay~, “a poor YAY-NAY” fellow, one who has no conversational power,\r\nand can only answer YEA or NAY to a question.\r\n\r\n~Yellow-belly~, a native of the fens of Lincolnshire, or the Isle of\r\nEly—in allusion to the frogs and yellow-bellied eels caught there.\r\n\r\n~Yellow-boy~, a sovereign, or any gold coin.\r\n\r\n~Yellow-gloak~, a jealous man.\r\n\r\n~Yellow-Jack~, the yellow fever prevalent in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n~Yellow-man~, a yellow silk handkerchief.\r\n\r\n~Yellows~, a term of reproach applied to Bluecoat and other charity\r\nschool boys.\r\n\r\n~Yid~, or YIT, a Jew. YIDDEN, the Jewish people. The Jews use these\r\nterms very frequently.\r\n\r\n~Yokel~, a countryman. Probably from yoke, representative of his\r\noccupation. Some fancy, however, that the word was originally YOWKEL, in\r\nimitation of the broad tones of country labourers.\r\n\r\n~Yokuff~, a chest, or large box.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire~, “to YORKSHIRE,” or “come YORKSHIRE over any person,” to\r\ncheat or cozen him. The proverbial over-reaching of the rustics of this\r\ncounty has given rise to the phrase, which is sometimes pronounced\r\nYorshar. To put Yorshar to a man, is to trick or deceive him. This\r\nlatter is from a work in the Lancashire dialect, 1757.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire compliment~, a gift of something useless to the giver.\r\nSometimes called a North-country compliment.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire estates;~ “I will do it when I come into my YORKSHIRE\r\nESTATES,”—meaning if I ever have the money or the means.\r\n\r\n~Yorkshire reckoning~, a reckoning in which every one pays his own\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n~Younker~, in street language, a lad or a boy. Term in general use\r\namongst costermongers, cabmen, and old-fashioned people. Barnefield’s\r\n_Affectionate Shepherd_, 1594, has the phrase, “a seemelie YOUNKER.”\r\n_Danish_ and _Friesic_, JONKER. In the navy, a naval cadet is usually\r\ntermed a YOUNKER.\r\n\r\n~Your nibs~, yourself. _See_ NIBS.\r\n\r\n~Yoxter~, a convict returned from transportation before his time.\r\n\r\n~Ziff~, a juvenile thief.\r\n\r\n~Ziph~, LANGUAGE OF, a way of disguising English in use among the\r\nstudents at Winchester College. Compare MEDICAL GREEK. De Quincey, in\r\nhis _Autobiographic Sketches_, says that he acquired this language as a\r\nboy, from a Dr. Mapleton, who had three sons at Winchester who had\r\nimported it from thence as their sole accomplishment, and that after the\r\nlapse of fifty years he could, and did with Lord Westport, converse in\r\nit with ease and rapidity. It was communicated at Winchester to\r\nnew-comers for a fixed fee of half a guinea. The secret is this,—repeat\r\nthe vowel or diphthong of every syllable, prefixing to the vowel so\r\nrepeated the letter G, and placing the accent on the intercalated\r\nsyllable. Thus, for example, “Shall we go away in an hour?” “Shagall\r\nwege gogo agawagay igin agan hougour?” “Three hours we have already\r\nstayed,” “Threegee hougours wege hagave agalreageadygy stagayed.” De\r\nQuincey could hardly have been considered complimentary to his own\r\nmemory if he supposed that he, or for the matter of that any one\r\npossessed of brains, could forget anything so simple; or that, if\r\nforgotten until suddenly recalled, it could not be mastered by any\r\nsensible person in a minute. The language of ZIPH is far inferior to any\r\nof the slangs manufactured by the lower classes. Evidently any consonant\r\nwill answer the purpose; F or L would be softer, and so far better. This\r\nZIPH system is not confined to Winchester College, as it is recorded and\r\ndescribed amongst many other modes of cryptical communication, oral and\r\nvisual, spoken, written, and symbolic, in an _Essay towards a Real\r\nCharacter and a Philosophic Language_ (founded on or suggested by a\r\ntreatise published just before, by Geo. Dalgarne), by John Wilkins,\r\nBishop of Chester, published by order of the Royal Society, fol. 1668,\r\nand as the bishop does not speak of it as a recent invention, it may\r\nprobably at that time have been regarded as an antique device for\r\nconducting a conversation in secrecy amongst bystanders—which says very\r\nlittle for either the designers or the bystanders.\r\n\r\n~Zounds!~ a sudden exclamation—abbreviation of “God’s wounds!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] Since the first edition of this work a great alteration has taken\r\nplace in this respect. Though topical ballads are now often sung, the\r\nsingers confine themselves to low neighbourhoods, and as soon as a\r\npoliceman approaches, if ever he does, they make themselves scarce. The\r\npractice is singular. One man gets as far through a line as he can, and\r\nwhen his voice cracks his companion takes up. For this reason the\r\nbusiness is as a rule conducted by a man and woman, or sometimes by a\r\nwoman and child. The writing of these ditties is generally work of a\r\ncharacter for which even 7_s._ 6_d._ would be a high rate of pay.—ED.\r\n\r\n[58] Eurasian is not a child of mixed race, but one born of European\r\nparents in an Asiatic clime. A similar error exists with regard to the\r\nword creole, which is generally supposed to mean a man or woman in whom\r\nwhite and black strains are mixed. I need not say how wrong this is, but\r\nthe vulgar error is none the less current.—ED.\r\n\r\n[59] There is something so extremely humorous and far-fetched about this\r\nexplanation, that though it is utterly unworthy of its place in a\r\ndictionary, I, finding it there, have not the heart to cut it out.—ED.\r\n\r\n[60] Of course by those who don’t know the scientific way used in\r\n“canine exhibitions” and dog-fights—of biting their tails till they\r\nturn round to bite the biter.—ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE BACK SLANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costermongers of London number between thirty and forty thousand.\r\nLike other low tribes, they boast a language, or secret tongue, by which\r\nthey hide their designs, movements, and other private affairs. This\r\ncosters’ speech offers no new fact, or approach to a fact, for\r\nphilologists; it is not very remarkable for originality of construction,\r\nneither is it spiced with low humour, as other cant. But the\r\ncostermongers boast that it is known only to themselves; that it is far\r\nbeyond the Irish, and puzzles the Jews. This is, however, but a poor\r\nfiction; for, as will be seen, the slang current among them is of the\r\ncrudest conception, and only difficult to the most ignorant. Any one of\r\nthe smallest pretensions to ability could learn back slang—could, in\r\nfact, create it for himself—as far as the costers’ vocabulary extends,\r\nin a couple of hours. Since the early editions of this work were\r\npublished back slang has become very common; and is now mostly spoken,\r\nmixed however, with various other kinds of slang, in the public\r\nmarkets—the new dead-meat market being, perhaps, strongest in the way\r\nof pure—if the term may be used—back slang.\r\n\r\nThe main principle of this language is spelling the words backwards—or\r\nrather, pronouncing them rudely backwards. Sometimes, for the sake of\r\nharmony, an extra syllable is prefixed or annexed; and occasionally the\r\nword receives quite a different turn, in rendering it backwards, from\r\nwhat an uninitiated person would have expected. One coster told Mayhew\r\nthat he often gave the end of a word “a new turn, just as if he chorused\r\nit with a tol-de-rol.” But then costermongers, and more especially those\r\nwho confided their joys and sorrows to the gentleman just named, are not\r\nto be relied on. The coster has, of course, his own idea of the proper\r\nway of spelling words, and is not to be convinced but by an overwhelming\r\nshow of learning,—and frequently not then, for he is a very headstrong\r\nfellow. By the time a coster has spelt an ordinary word of two or three\r\nsyllables in the proper way, and then spelt it backwards, it has become\r\na tangled knot that no etymologist could unravel. The word “generalize,”\r\nfor instance, is considered to be “shilling” spelt backwards, while\r\n“genitraf” is supposed to represent farthing. Sometimes slang and cant\r\nwords are introduced, and even these, when imagined to be tolerably well\r\nknown, are pronounced backwards. Very often, instead of a word being\r\nspelt backwards right through, the syllables retain their original\r\norder; the initial _h_ is pronounced as though _c_ were before it,\r\n“tatch” being back slang for hat, and “flatch” the word supposed to\r\nrepresent half. Again, the full words are shortened, as “gen” for\r\n“generalize,” a shilling; and various other artifices are resorted to,\r\nin the hope of adding to the natural difficulties of back slang.\r\n\r\nThis back language, back slang, or “kacab genals,” as it is called by\r\nthe costermongers themselves, is supposed to be regarded by the rising\r\ngeneration of street-sellers as a distinct and regular mode of\r\nintercommunication. People who hear this slang for the first time never\r\nrefer words, by inverting them, to their originals; and the “yanneps,”\r\n“esclops,” and “nammows,” are looked upon as secret terms. Those who\r\npractise the slang soon obtain a considerable stock vocabulary, so that\r\nthey converse rather from the memory than the understanding. Amongst the\r\nsenior costermongers, and those who pride themselves on their\r\nproficiency in back slang, a conversation is often sustained for a whole\r\nevening—that is, the chief words are in the back slang—especially if\r\nany “flats” are present whom they wish to astonish or confuse.\r\n\r\nThe addition of an _s_ invariably forms the plural, so that this is\r\nanother source of complication. For instance, woman in the back slang is\r\n“nammow,” and “nammows” is “women.” The explorer, then, in undoing the\r\nback slang, and turning the word once more into English, would have a\r\nnovel and very extraordinary rendering of women. Where a word is\r\nrefractory in submitting to a back rendering, as in the case of “pound,”\r\nletters are made to change positions for the sake of harmony; thus we\r\nhave “dunop,” a pound, instead of “dnuop,” which nobody could pleasantly\r\npronounce. Also all words of one syllable which end with two\r\nconsonants—such, for instance, as cold, drunk—become dissyllables when\r\nread backwards, the vowel e being imagined between the then first and\r\nsecond consonants, as “deloc,” “kennurd.” Others take the vowel as an\r\ninitial, girl being pronounced “elrig.” This arrangement, as a\r\nmodification to suit circumstances, may remind the reader of the Jews’\r\n“Old clo’! old clo’!” instead of “Old clothes! old clothes!” which it is\r\nsupposed would tire the patience of even a Jew to repeat all day.\r\n\r\nThe back slang has been in vogue for many years. It is, as before\r\nstated, very easily acquired, and is principally used by the\r\ncostermongers and others who practise it (as the specimen Glossary will\r\nshow) for communicating the secrets of their street tradings, the cost\r\nof and profit on goods, and for keeping their natural enemies, the\r\npolice, in the dark. “Cool the esclop” (look at the police) is often\r\nsaid among them, when one of the constabulary makes his appearance. It\r\nis only fair to assume, however, that the police know as much or more\r\nabout the back slang than do the costers; and every child in a “shy”\r\nneighbourhood knows the meaning of the phrase just quoted. Those who\r\nregard the London costermonger as a fearful being are very much\r\nmistaken,—he is singularly simple-minded and innocent, and has, indeed,\r\nvery little to conceal; but he certainly does like to wrap himself up as\r\nin a garment of mystery, and sometimes believes that the few words of\r\nslang he knows, mixed as they are, and troublesome as they have been to\r\nhim, form an impenetrable barrier between him and the rest of the world.\r\nHe is fond of exhibiting what knowledge he possesses, and so talks slang\r\nin public much more than in private; but at most the slang words used\r\nbear not forty per cent. proportion to the rest of his conversational\r\nstructure, even when he exerts himself to the uttermost limits of his\r\nability and education, and even when he is a leader in his walk of life.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on no subject is the costermonger so silent as on his money\r\naffairs. All costs and profits, he thinks, should be kept profoundly\r\nsecret. The back slang, therefore, gives the various small amounts very\r\nminutely, but, as has been before remarked, these words are known\r\nwherever common folk most do congregate, and are peculiar only for their\r\nvariations from the original in the way of pronunciation:—\r\n\r\n    ~Flatch~, halfpenny.\r\n    ~Yannep~, penny.\r\n    ~Owt-yanneps~, twopence.\r\n    ~Erth-yanneps~, threepence.\r\n    ~Roaf-yanneps~, fourpence.\r\n    ~Evif, or ewif-yanneps~, fivepence.\r\n    ~Exis-yanneps~, sixpence.\r\n    ~Nevis-yanneps~, sevenpence.\r\n    ~Teaich, or theg-yanneps~, eightpence.\r\n    ~Enin-yanneps~, ninepence.\r\n    ~Net-yanneps~, tenpence.\r\n    ~Nevelé-yanneps~, elevenpence.\r\n    ~Evlénet-yanneps~, twelvepence.\r\n    ~Generalize~, one shilling.\r\n    ~Yannep-flatch~, three-halfpence.\r\n    ~Owt-yannep-flatch~, twopence-halfpenny. The word “flatch”\r\n        represents the odd halfpenny when added to any number of\r\n        “yanneps.”\r\n    ~Gen, or eno-gen~, one shilling. “Gen” is a contraction of\r\n        “generalize.”\r\n    ~Owt-gens~, two shillings.\r\n    ~Erth-gens~, three shillings.\r\n\r\nThe “gens” continue in the same sequence as the “yanneps” above; but, as\r\na rule, the _s_ is left out, and “owt” or “erth gen” represents the\r\nquantity. This is, however, matter of individual taste; and any reader\r\nwho is anxious to become proficient need not be afraid of committing a\r\nsolecism—that’s a good word for back slanging—by giving vent to any\r\npeculiarity that may strike him. Variety is the charm of nature, we are\r\ntold; and in this particular, if in no other, back slang and nature\r\napproach each other. So do extremes meet.\r\n\r\n    ~Yenork~, a crown piece, or five shillings.\r\n    ~Flatch-yenork~, half-a-crown. This is generally slurred into\r\n        “flatch-a-nock.” The crown in full rarely receives the title\r\n        “yenork” nowadays,—it is usually a “wheel” or “evif gen.”\r\n    ~Flatch a dunop~, ten shillings, _i.e._, half a pound.\r\n\r\nBeyond this amount the slangist reckons after an intricate and\r\ncomplicated mode. Fifteen shillings would be “erth-evif-gen,” or,\r\nliterally, three times 5_s._; seventeen and sixpence would be\r\n“erth-yenork-flatch,” or three crowns and a half; or, by another mode of\r\nreckoning, “erth-evif-gen flatch-yenork,” _i.e._, three times 5_s._, and\r\nhalf-a-crown.\r\n\r\n    ~Dunop~, a pound. Varied by “Dick,” back slang for “quid.”\r\n\r\nFurther than which the costermonger seldom goes in money reckoning.\r\n\r\nIn the following Glossary only those words are given which are\r\ncontinually used,—the terms connected with street traffic, the names\r\nof the different coins, vegetables, fruit, and fish, technicalities of\r\npolice courts, &c. The reader might naturally think that a system of\r\nspeech so simple as the back slang would require no Glossary; but he\r\nwill quickly perceive, from the specimens given, that a great many words\r\nin frequent use in a “back” sense, have become so twisted as to require\r\na little glossarial explanation.\r\n\r\nThis kind of slang, formed by reversing and transposing the letters of a\r\nword, is not peculiar to the London costermongers. Instances of an\r\nexactly similar secret dialect are found in the Spanish “Germania” and\r\nFrench “Argot.” Thus:—\r\n\r\n    _Spanish._   _Germania._    _English._\r\n\r\n    PLATO.       TAPLO.         PLATE.\r\n    DEMIA.       MEDIA.         STOCKINGS.\r\n\r\n    _French._    _Argot._       _English._\r\n\r\n    F’OL.        LOFFE.         FOOLISH.\r\n    LORCEFE.     LA FORCE.      LA FORCE, the prison of that name.\r\n\r\nThe Bazeegars, a wandering tribe of jugglers in India, form a back\r\nslang, on the basis of the Hindustanee, in the following manner:—\r\n\r\n    _Hindustanee._      _Bazeegar._       _English._\r\n\r\n    AG.                 GA.               FIRE.\r\n    LAMBA.              BALUM.            LONG.\r\n    DUM.                MUDU.             BREATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF THE BACK SLANG.\r\n\r\n~Birk~, a “crib,”—a house.\r\n\r\n~Cool~, to look.\r\n\r\n~Cool him~, look at him. A phrase frequently used when one costermonger\r\nwarns another of the approach of a policeman, or when any person worthy\r\nof notice passes by. When any old lady has been bargaining with a\r\ncostermonger, and leaves his barrow without purchasing, the proprietor\r\nof the barrow will call out to the rest, “COOL the delo nammow,” which,\r\nthough it means literally nothing beyond “Look at the old woman,”\r\nconveys to them an intimation that she is, from their point of view, a\r\nnuisance, and should be treated as such.\r\n\r\n~Dab~, bad.\r\n\r\n~Dab tros~, a bad sort.\r\n\r\n~Dabheno~, a bad one, sometimes a bad market. _See_ DOOGHENO.\r\n\r\n~Da-erb~, bread.\r\n\r\n~Deb~, or DAB, a bed; “I’m off to the DEB,” I’m going to bed.\r\n\r\n~Delo nammow~, an old woman.\r\n\r\n~Delog~, gold.\r\n\r\n~Doog~, good.\r\n\r\n~Doogheno~, literally “good-one,” but implying generally a good market,\r\na good man, &c.\r\n\r\n~Doogheno hit~, one good hit. A coster remarks to a mate, “Jack made a\r\nDOOGHENO HIT this morning,” implying that he did well at market, or sold\r\nout with good profit. Actually a good hit only is intended, but\r\nredundancy has its charms in the back slang as well as in more\r\npretentious literary efforts.\r\n\r\n~Dunop~, a pound.\r\n\r\n~Edgabac~, cabbage.\r\n\r\n~Edgenaro~, an orange.\r\n\r\n~E-fink~, a knife.\r\n\r\n~Ekame~, a “make,” or swindle.\r\n\r\n~Ekom~, a “moke,” or donkey.\r\n\r\n~Elrig~, a girl.\r\n\r\n~Emag~, game, “I know your little EMAG.”\r\n\r\n~Enif~, fine.\r\n\r\n~Enin gen~, nine shillings.\r\n\r\n~Enin yanneps~, ninepence.\r\n\r\n~Eno~, one.\r\n\r\n~Erif~, fire.\r\n\r\n~Erth~, three.\r\n\r\n~Erth gen~, three shillings.\r\n\r\n~Erth-pu~, three-up, a street game, played with three halfpence.\r\n\r\n~Erth sith-noms~, three months,—a term of imprisonment unfortunately\r\nvery familiar to the lower orders. Generally known as a “drag.”\r\n\r\n~Erth yanneps~, threepence.\r\n\r\n~Esclop~, police, now used to signify a constable only. ESCLOP is\r\npronounced “slop” simply, but the _c_ was never sounded. A policeman is\r\nnow and then called, by some purist or stickler for etiquette, an\r\n“esclopnam.”\r\n\r\n~Es-roch~, a horse.\r\n\r\n~Esuch~, a house.\r\n\r\n~Evif-gen~, a crown, or five shillings.\r\n\r\n~Evif-yanneps~, fivepence.\r\n\r\n~Evlenet-gen~, twelve shillings.\r\n\r\n~Evlenet sith-noms~, twelve months. Generally known as a “stretch.”\r\n\r\n~Exis-evif-gen~, six times five shillings, _i.e._, 30_s._ All moneys may\r\nbe reckoned in this manner, either with YANNEPS or GENS. It is, however,\r\nrarely or never done.\r\n\r\n~Exis-evif-yanneps~, elevenpence,—literally, “sixpence and fivepence =\r\nelevenpence.” This mode of reckoning, distinct from the preceding, is\r\nonly made by special arrangement amongst slangites, who wish to confound\r\ntheir intimates.\r\n\r\n~Exis gen~, six shillings.\r\n\r\n~Exis sith-noms~, six months.\r\n\r\n~Exis yanneps~, sixpence.\r\n\r\n~Fi-heath~, a thief.\r\n\r\n~Flatch~, half, or a halfpenny.\r\n\r\n~Flatch kennurd~, half drunk.\r\n\r\n~Flatch-yenork~, half-a-crown. _See_ preceding remarks.\r\n\r\n~Flatchyannep~, a halfpenny.\r\n\r\n~Gen~, twelvepence, or one shilling. Formerly imagined to be an\r\nabbreviation of argent, cant term for silver.\r\n\r\n~Generalize~, a shilling, almost invariably shortened to GEN.\r\n\r\n~Genitraf~, a farthing.\r\n\r\n~Gen-net~, or NET GEN, ten shillings.\r\n\r\n~Genol~, long.\r\n\r\n~Hel-bat~, a table. } The aspirate is matter of taste.\r\n\r\n~Helpa~, an apple.  }\r\n\r\n~Kanitseeno~, a stinking one. KANITS is a stink.\r\n\r\n~Kennurd~, drunk.\r\n\r\n~Kew~ (or more properly KEEU), a week.\r\n\r\n~Kews~, SKEW, or SKEEU, weeks.\r\n\r\n~Kirb~, a brick.\r\n\r\n~Kool~, to look.\r\n\r\n~Lawt~, tall.\r\n\r\n~Ler-ac-am~, mackerel.\r\n\r\n~Mottob~, bottom.\r\n\r\n~Mur~, rum. A “nettock o’ MUR” is a quartern of rum.\r\n\r\n~Nair~, rain.\r\n\r\n~Nam~, a man.\r\n\r\n~Nam esclop~, a policeman. _See_ ESCLOP.\r\n\r\n~Nammow~, a woman; DELO NAMMOW, an old woman.\r\n\r\n~Neel~, lean.\r\n\r\n~Neergs~, greens.\r\n\r\n~Net enin gen~, nineteen shillings.\r\n\r\n~Net evif gen~, fifteen shillings.\r\n\r\n~Net exis gen~, sixteen shillings.\r\n\r\n~Net gen~, ten shillings, or half a sovereign.\r\n\r\n~Net nevis gen~, seventeen shillings.\r\n\r\n~Net rith gen~, thirteen shillings.\r\n\r\n~Net roaf gen~, fourteen shillings. It will be seen by the foregoing\r\nthat the reckoning is more by tens than by “teens.” This is, however,\r\nmatter of choice, and any one wishing to be considered accomplished in\r\nthis description of slang, must do as he thinks best—must lead and not\r\nbe led.\r\n\r\n~Net theg gen~, eighteen shillings.\r\n\r\n~Net yanneps~, tenpence.\r\n\r\n~Nevele gen~, eleven shillings.\r\n\r\n~Nevele yanneps~, elevenpence.\r\n\r\n~Nevis gen~, seven shillings.\r\n\r\n~Nevis stretch~, seven years’ penal servitude.\r\n\r\n~Nevis yanneps~, sevenpence.\r\n\r\n~Nig~, gin.\r\n\r\n~Noom~, the moon.\r\n\r\n~Nos-rap~, a parson.\r\n\r\n~Occabot~, tobacco; “tib fo OCCABOT,” bit of tobacco.\r\n\r\n~Ogging ot tekram~, going to market.\r\n\r\n~On~, no.\r\n\r\n~On doog~, no good.\r\n\r\n~Owt gen~, two shillings. } OWT is pronounced OAT.\r\n\r\n~Owt yanneps~, twopence.  }\r\n\r\n~Pac~, a cap.\r\n\r\n~Pinnurt pots~, turnip tops.\r\n\r\n~Pot~, top.\r\n\r\n~Rape~, a pear.\r\n\r\n~Reeb~, beer. “Top o’ REEB,” a pot of beer.\r\n\r\n~Rev-lis~, silver.\r\n\r\n~Rof-efil~, for life—sentence of punishment.\r\n\r\n~Roaf-gen~, four shillings.\r\n\r\n~Roaf-yanneps~, fourpence.\r\n\r\n~Rutat~, or RATTAT, a “tatur,” or potato.\r\n\r\n~See-otches~, shoes.\r\n\r\n~Sey~, yes. Pronounced SEE.\r\n\r\n~Shif~, fish.\r\n\r\n~Sirretch~, cherries. Very often SIRRETCHES.\r\n\r\n~Sith-nom~, a month. This is because the slang was made from months, not\r\nmonth. Perhaps because the latter was not easy; perhaps because terms of\r\nimprisonment run longer than a month, and are often enumerated in the\r\n“kacab genals.” However it may be, “months” in this mode of speaking has\r\na double plural as it stands now.\r\n\r\n~Slaoc~, coals.\r\n\r\n~Slop~, a policeman. _See_ ESCLOP.\r\n\r\n~Sneerg~, greens.\r\n\r\n~Spinsrap~, parsnips.  }\r\n\r\n~Sret-sio~, oysters.   }\r\n\r\n~Sres-wort~, trousers. }\r\n\r\n~Starps~, sprats.      } All these will take the _s_, which is now initial,\r\n\r\n~Stoobs~, boots.       } after them, if desired, and, as may be seen, some\r\n\r\n~Storrac~, carrots.    } take it doubly.\r\n\r\n~Stun~, nuts.          }\r\n\r\n~Stunlaw~, walnuts.    }\r\n\r\n~Tach~, a hat.\r\n\r\n~Taf~, fat. A TAF ENO is a fat man or woman, literally A FAT ONE.\r\n\r\n~Taoc~, a coat. “Cool the DELO TAOC” means, “Look at the old coat,” but\r\nis really intended to apply to the wearer as well, as professors of\r\nmixed slangs might say, “Vardy his nibs in the snide bucket.”\r\n\r\n~Taoc-tisaw~, a waistcoat.\r\n\r\n~Teaich-gir~, right, otherwise TADGER.\r\n\r\n~Tenip~, a pint.\r\n\r\n~Theg~ (or TEAICH) gen, eight shillings.\r\n\r\n~Theg~ (or TEAITCH) yanneps, eightpence.\r\n\r\n~Tib~, a bit, or piece.\r\n\r\n~Tol~, lot, stock, or share.\r\n\r\n~Top-yob~, a potboy.\r\n\r\n~Torrac~, a carrot. “Ekat a TORRAC.”\r\n\r\n~Trork~, a quart.\r\n\r\n~Trosseno~, literally, “one sort,” but professional slangists use it to\r\nimply anything that is bad. TROSS, among costermongers, means anything\r\nbad. It is probably a corruption of trash. Possibly, however, the\r\nconstant use of the words “dab-tros” may have led them in their\r\nunthinking way to imagine that the latter word will do by itself.\r\n\r\n~Wedge~, a Jew. This may look strange, but it is exact back slang.\r\n\r\n~Wor-rab~, a barrow.\r\n\r\n~Yad~, a day; YADS, days.\r\n\r\n~Yadnarb~, brandy.\r\n\r\n~Yannep~, a penny.\r\n\r\n~Yannep a time~, a penny each. Costermongers say “a time” for many\r\nthings. They say a “bob a time,” meaning a shilling each for admission\r\nto a theatre, or any other place, or that certain articles are charged a\r\nshilling each. The context is the only clue to the exact meaning.\r\n\r\n~Yannep-flatch~, three halfpence,—all the halfpence and pennies\r\ncontinue in the same sequence, as for instance, OWT-YANNEP-FLATCH,\r\ntwopence-halfpenny.\r\n\r\n~Yap pu~, pay up.\r\n\r\n~Yeknod~, or JERK-NOD, a donkey.\r\n\r\n~Yenork~, a crown.\r\n\r\n~Yob~, a boy.\r\n\r\n~Zeb~, best.\r\n\r\nFrom these examples the apt student may fairly judge how to form his own\r\nback slang to his own liking and that of his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE RHYMING SLANG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere exists in London a singular tribe of men, known amongst the\r\n“fraternity of vagabonds” as chaunters and patterers. Both classes are\r\ngreat talkers. The first sing or chaunt through the public thoroughfares\r\nballads—political and humorous—carols, dying speeches, and the various\r\nother kinds of gallows and street literature. The second deliver street\r\norations on grease-removing compounds, plating powders, high-polishing\r\nblacking, and the thousand-and-one wonderful penny-worths that are\r\nretailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb-stone.\r\n\r\nThey are quite a distinct tribe from the costermongers; indeed, amongst\r\ntramps, they term themselves the “harristocrats of the streets,” and\r\nboast that they live by their intellects. Like the costermongers,\r\nhowever, they have a secret tongue or cant speech known only to each\r\nother. This cant, which has nothing to do with that spoken by the\r\ncostermongers, is known in Seven Dials and elsewhere as the “rhyming\r\nslang,” or the substitution of words and sentences which rhyme with\r\nother words intended to be kept secret. The chaunter’s cant, therefore,\r\npartakes of his calling, and he transforms and uses up into a rough\r\nspeech the various odds and ends of old songs, ballads, and street\r\nnicknames, which are found suitable to his purpose. Unlike nearly all\r\nother systems of cant, the rhyming slang is not founded upon allegory;\r\nunless we except a few rude similes, thus—“I’m afloat” is the rhyming\r\ncant for “boat,” “sorrowful tale” is equivalent to “three months in\r\njail,” “artful dodger” signifies a “lodger,” and a “snake in the grass”\r\nstands for a “looking-glass”—a meaning that would delight a fat\r\nChinaman, or a collector of Oriental proverbs. But, as in the case of\r\nthe costers’ speech and the old gipsy-vagabond cant, the chaunters and\r\npatterers so interlard this rhyming slang with their general remarks,\r\nwhile their ordinary language is so smothered and subdued, that, unless\r\nwhen they are professionally engaged, and talking of their wares, they\r\nmight almost pass for foreigners.\r\n\r\nFrom the inquiries I have made of various patterers and “paper-workers,”\r\nI learn that the rhyming slang was introduced about twelve or fifteen\r\nyears ago.[61] Numbering this class of oratorical and bawling wanderers\r\nat twenty thousand, scattered over Great Britain, including London and\r\nthe large provincial towns, we thus see the number of English vagabonds\r\nwho converse in rhyme and talk poetry, although their habitations and\r\nmode of life constitute a very unpleasant Arcadia. These nomadic poets,\r\nlike the other talkers of cant or secret languages, are stamped with the\r\nvagabond’s mark, and are continually on the move. The married men mostly\r\nhave lodgings in London, and come and go as occasion may require. A few\r\nnever quit London streets, but the greater number tramp to all the large\r\nprovincial fairs, and prefer the “monkery” (country) to town life. Some\r\ntransact their business in a systematic way, sending a post-office order\r\nto the Seven Dials’ printer for a fresh supply of ballads or penny\r\nbooks, or to the “swag shop,” as the case may be, for trinkets and\r\ngewgaws, to be sent on by rail to a given town by the time they shall\r\narrive there.\r\n\r\nWhen any dreadful murder, colliery explosion, or frightful railway\r\naccident has happened in a country district, three or four chaunters\r\nare generally on the spot in a day or two after the occurrence, vending\r\nand bawling “A True and Faithful Account,” &c., which “true and\r\nfaithful account” was concocted purely in the imaginations of\r\nthe successors of Catnach and Tommy Pitts,[62] behind the counters\r\nof their printing-shops in Seven Dials. And but few fairs are held\r\nin any part of England without the patterer being punctually at his\r\npost, with his nostrums, or real gold rings (with the story of the wager\r\nlaid by the gentleman—_see_ FAWNEY-BOUNCING, in the Dictionary), or\r\nsavealls for candlesticks, or paste which, when applied to the strop,\r\nmakes the dullest razor keen enough to hack broom handles and sticks,\r\nand after that to have quite enough sharpness left for splitting hairs,\r\nor shaving them off the back of one of the hands of a clodhopper,\r\nlooking on in amazement. And Cheap John, too, with his coarse jokes, and\r\nno end of six-bladed knives, and pocket-books, containing information\r\nfor everybody, with pockets to hold money, and a pencil to write with\r\ninto the bargain, and a van stuffed with the cheap productions of\r\nSheffield and “Brummagem,”—he, too, is a patterer of the highest order,\r\nand visits fairs, and can hold a conversation in the rhyming slang.\r\n\r\nSuch is a rough description of the men who speak this jargon; and simple\r\nand ridiculous as the vulgar scheme of a rhyming slang may appear, it\r\nmust always be regarded as a curious fact in linguistic history. In\r\norder that the reader’s patience may not be too much taxed, only a\r\nselection of rhyming words has been given in the Glossary,—and these\r\nfor the most part, as in the case of the back slang, are the terms of\r\nevery-day life, as used by this order of tramps and hucksters.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that the chaunter or patterer confines\r\nhimself entirely to this slang when conveying secret intelligence. On\r\nthe contrary, although he speaks not a “leash of languages,” yet is he\r\nmaster of the beggar’s cant, and is thoroughly “up” in street slang. The\r\nfollowing letter, written by a chaunter to a gentleman who took an\r\ninterest in his welfare, will show his capabilities in this line:—\r\n\r\n    Dear Friend,[63]\r\n\r\n    Excuse the liberty, since i saw you last i have not earned a thick\r\n    un, we have had such a Dowry of Parny that it completely Stumped\r\n    Drory the Bossman’s Patter therefore i am broke up and not having\r\n    another friend but you i wish to know if you would lend me the price\r\n    of 2 Gross of Tops, Dies, or Croaks, which is 7 shillings, of the\r\n    above-mentioned worthy and Sarah Chesham the Essex Burick for the\r\n    Poisoning job, they are both to be topped at Springfield Sturaban on\r\n    Tuesday next. i hope you will oblige me if you can, for it will be\r\n    the means of putting a James in my Clye. i will call at your Carser\r\n    on Sunday Evening next for an answer, for i want a Speel on the Drum\r\n    as soon as possible. hoping you and the family are All Square,\r\n\r\n    I remain Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\nThe numerous allusions in the Glossary to well-known places in London\r\nshow that this rude speech was mainly concocted in the metropolis. The\r\npolice have made themselves partially acquainted with the back slang,\r\nbut they are still profoundly ignorant of the rhyming slang.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written, matters have changed considerably,\r\neven, which I much doubt, if they ever were as is stated; for, as I have\r\nalready remarked, wherever opportunity has occurred, the costermonger,\r\nthe patterer, the chaunter, and the various other itinerants who “work”\r\nLondon and the provinces, delight in making themselves appear a most\r\nmysterious body; and this, when added to their natural disinclination to\r\ncommit themselves to anything like fact so far as their natural\r\nenemies—inquirers, and well-dressed inquirers in particular—are\r\nconcerned, has caused all sorts of extraordinary stories to be set\r\nafloat, which have ultimately led to an opinion becoming prevalent, that\r\nthe costermonger and his friends form a race of beings differing\r\nentirely from those who mix in the ordinary humdrum routine of\r\nrespectable life. Nothing could really be much further from fact. Any\r\none who has ever been driven by stress of circumstances or curiosity to\r\ntake up a permanent or temporary residence in any of the lodging-houses\r\nwhich abound in St. Giles’s, Saffron Hill, Turnmill Street, and in all\r\nparts of the eastern district of the metropolis, will bear me out when I\r\nsay that a more commonplace individual, so far as his inner life is\r\nconcerned, than the London itinerant cannot possibly exist. Certainly he\r\nis ignorant, and takes a very limited view of things in general, and\r\nreligion and politics in particular; but these peculiarities are held in\r\ncommon with his betters, and so cannot be regarded as the special\r\nprerogative of any class. If you ask him a question he will attempt to\r\nmislead you, because, by your asking the question, he knows you are\r\nignorant of his way of life; and when he does not mystify from love of\r\nmischief, as it appears he does from all published books I have seen\r\nabout him, he does so as a duty he owes his natural enemies, the parish\r\nauthorities and the tract distributors, the latter of whom he holds in\r\nspecial abhorrence.\r\n\r\nIf the rhyming slang was ever, during its existence, regarded as a\r\nsecret language, its secrecy has long since departed from it. Far easier\r\nof construction than even the back slang, it has been common, especially\r\nin several printing-offices I could name, for many years, while\r\nstreet-boys are great proficients in its small mysteries. The Glossary\r\nwhich follows here will explain a good deal of its mechanism; but it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the rhymes are all matters of individual\r\nopinion, and that if one man says Allacompain means rain, another is\r\nquite justified in preferring Mary Blane, if his individual fancy lies\r\nin that direction. And now, if there is any secret about the rhyming\r\nslang, it is this—the rhyme is left out. This may at first seem\r\nextraordinary; but on reflection it will be seen that there is no other\r\nway of making the proceedings of its exponents puzzling to ordinarily\r\nsharp ears which have received the slightest clue. Thus, when the first\r\nword of a series only is used, and others in the sentence are made up\r\nfrom the back, the centre and various slangs, there is some hope of\r\nfogging an intruding listener to a private conversation. When a man is\r\ndrunk, the rhyming slang would illustrate that fact by the words\r\n“Elephant’s trunk;” but the practised hand confines himself to the\r\nstatement that “Bill’s Elephants.” “Bullock’s horn” represents to pawn,\r\nbut an article is said to be “Bullocked” only; and so on through the\r\nlist, providing always that the curtailment represents two syllables; if\r\nit does not, then the entire rhyme is given.\r\n\r\nI think that this will be sufficient to guide those readers anxious to\r\nbecome proficient themselves, or to understand others who are themselves\r\nproficient at this item in the world of slang; and so I have nothing\r\nmore to say except to call attention to the fact that, in all the other\r\nintroductions, I have made my corrections, which have been neither few\r\nnor unimportant, in the text; but that I could see no way of working on\r\nthe subject of the rhyming slang fairly and explicitly other than by\r\nmeans of this note.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] This was written in 1858.\r\n\r\n[62] The famous printers and publishers of sheet songs and last dying\r\nspeeches thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n[63] The writer, a street chaunter of ballads and last dying speeches,\r\nalludes in his letter to two celebrated criminals—Thos.

As this knowledge can never be acquired in any other way than by\r\nactual observation, and is not to be obtained by hearsay, or second-hand\r\ninformation, or from books, it is rarely brought to bear upon any\r\nsubject of this kind as treated in the newspapers, and the articles on\r\nreal low and criminal life which now and again appear, though extremely\r\namusing, amuse those about whom they are written as much as they do\r\nthose for whose information they are produced. So, perhaps, those\r\nwriters who have heard centre slang, and have had opportunity of\r\nreferring to it, did not know what it was, or certainly, as an\r\ninstitution unique in its way, it would have received some little\r\nattention. There is not much in it, of course, as its origin shows, the\r\nkey being everything towards success in experimentalizing with it.\r\nCentre slang, then, is formed by making the central vowel of a word its\r\ninitial letter, and adding vowels and consonants sufficient to make the\r\nsound imposing, or, as cooks say, to flavour palatably. An occasional\r\ninfusion of back slang is now and again considered advisable, but the\r\ntaste of the speaker must decide how much is requisite. Mug is a common\r\nword to signify a fool or flat; this, in centre slang, becomes Ugmer, or\r\nHugmer, as the speaker likes, while fool and flat themselves become\r\nOolerfer and Atfler respectively. The aspirate can be added, if\r\nrelished, to any centre slang word. A welcher, by means of the new\r\nslang, becomes an Elcherwer or Elchwer, a thief is an Evethee, and a\r\nsticker-up of skittles is an Ickitser-pu. As the inventors of this slang\r\nare not particular about spelling, phonography is used extensively in\r\nits composition—that is, it would be, if it were possible to write\r\ncentre slang to any extent. However, as it is a spoken language only,\r\nand no patent has been taken out for its use, boldness is the chief\r\nessential for any one possessed of a mobile tongue and a desire to\r\nbecome expert. There is no Glossary of this slang necessary, as it is\r\nonly made up of small parcels, as occasion requires, and does not keep\r\nwell without guiding sentences attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nSLANG, CANT, AND VULGAR LANGUAGE:\r\n\r\nA LIST OF THE\r\n\r\nBOOKS CONSULTED IN COMPILING THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlang has a literary history, the same as authorized language. More than\r\none hundred works have treated upon the subject in one form or other,—a\r\nfew devoting but a chapter, whilst many have given up their entire pages\r\nto expounding its history and use. Old Harman, a worthy man, who\r\ninterested himself in suppressing and exposing vagabondism in the days\r\nof good Queen Bess, was the first to write upon the subject. Decker\r\nfollowed fifty years afterwards, but helped himself, evidently, to his\r\npredecessor’s labours. Shakspeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson,\r\nand Brome, each employed beggars’ cant as part of the machinery of their\r\nplays. Then came Head (who wrote _The English Rogue_ in 1680) with a\r\nGlossary of cant words “used by the Gipsies.” But it was only a reprint\r\nof what Decker had given sixty years before. About this time authorized\r\ndictionaries began to insert vulgar words, labelling them “cant.” The\r\nJack Sheppards and Dick Turpins of the early and middle part of the last\r\ncentury made cant popular, and many small works were published upon the\r\nsubject. But it was Grose, burly, facetious Grose, who, in the year\r\n1785, collected the scattered Glossaries of cant and secret words, and\r\nformed one large work, adding to it all the vulgar words and slang terms\r\nused in his own day. The indelicacy and extreme vulgarity of the work\r\nrenders it unfit for ordinary use, still it must be admitted that it is\r\nby far the most important work which has ever appeared on street or\r\npopular language; indeed, from its pages every succeeding work has, up\r\nto the present time, drawn its contents. The great fault of Grose’s book\r\nconsists in the author not contenting himself with slang and cant terms,\r\nbut inserting every “smutty” and offensive word that could be\r\ndiscovered. However, Harman and Grose are, after all, the only authors\r\nwho have as yet treated the subject in an original manner, or who have\r\nwritten on it from personal inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ainsworth’s~ (William Harrison) Novels and Ballads.     _London_, V. D.\r\n\r\nSome of this author’s novels, such as _Rookwood_ and _Jack Sheppard_,\r\nabound in Cant words, placed in the mouths of the highwaymen. The\r\nauthor’s ballads (especially “Nix my dolly, pals, fake away”) have long\r\nbeen popular favourites.\r\n\r\n~Amorous Gallants’ Tongue tipp’d with Golden Expressions;~ or the Art of\r\nCourtship refined, being the best and Newest ACADEMY; containing Select\r\nSentences, forms of Courtship; Choice Letters; Interpretation of Dreams:\r\nto which is added Bills, Bonds, Releases, Letters of Attorney, &c.;\r\ntogether with _A Canting Academy_, or the PEDLAR’S FRENCH DICTIONARY,\r\n13th edition.

This work\r\nis scarce, and much prized by collectors. The Canting Dictionary\r\nappeared before, about 1710, with the initials B. E. on the title. It\r\nalso came out afterwards, in the year 1751, under the title of the\r\n_Scoundrel’s Dictionary_,—a mere reprint of the two former impressions.\r\n\r\n~Bailey’s~ (Nath.)

Many words, owing to the caprices of fashion or society, have\r\nwholly disappeared in the parent country, whilst in the colonies they\r\nare yet heard. The words “skink,” to serve drink in company, and the old\r\nterm “miching” or “meeching,” skulking or playing truant, for instance,\r\nare still in use in the United States, although nearly obsolete here.\r\n\r\n~Beaumont and Fletcher’s~ Comedy of _The Beggar’s Bush_, 4to, 1661.\r\n\r\nContains numerous Cant words.\r\n\r\n~Bee’s~ (Jon.)

It was concocted by Caulfield as a\r\nspeculation, and published at _one guinea_ per copy; and, owing to the\r\nremarkable title, and the notification at the bottom that “only a few\r\ncopies were printed,” soon became scarce.

It was frequently reprinted at other places in Germany: and in\r\n1528 there appeared an edition at Wirtemberg, with a preface by Martin\r\nLuther, who says that the “Rotwelsche Sprach,” the Cant language of the\r\nbeggars, comes from the Jews, as it contains many Hebrew words, as any\r\none who understands that language may perceive. This book is divided\r\ninto three parts, or sections; the first gives a special account of the\r\nseveral orders of the “Fraternity of Vagabonds;” the second, sundry\r\n“_notabilia_” relating to the different classes of beggars previously\r\ndescribed; and the third consists of a “Rotwelsche Vocabulary,” or\r\n“Canting Dictionary.” There is a long notice of the “Liber Vagatorum” in\r\nthe “Weimarisches Jahrbuch,” 10ter Band, 1856.
