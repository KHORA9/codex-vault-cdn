The aim of each writer has been to produce a work\r\ncompiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the\r\nstudent of Archaeology and History, and yet not too technical in language\r\nfor the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist.\r\n\r\nTo specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case\r\nwould be difficult and tedious in this place. But amongst the general\r\nsources of information which have been almost invariably found useful\r\nare:--(1) the great county histories, the value of which, especially in\r\nquestions of genealogy and local records, is generally recognised; (2)\r\nthe numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the\r\nTransactions of the Antiquarian and Archaeological Societies; (3) the\r\nimportant documents made accessible in the series issued by the Master\r\nof the Rolls; (4) the well-known works of Britton and Willis on the\r\nEnglish Cathedrals; and (5) the very excellent series of Handbooks to\r\nthe Cathedrals originated by the late Mr John Murray; to which the\r\nreader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail, especially in\r\nreference to the histories of the respective sees.\r\n\r\n                                            GLEESON WHITE, E.

Professor Willis, in his\r\nlecture addressed to the meeting of the Archaeological Institute, held at\r\nGloucester in 1860, after giving various reasons for believing that the\r\ncrypt dates back no further than 1089, when the foundation-stone was\r\nlaid by Abbot Serlo, goes on to state that he was \"clearly of opinion\r\nthat when the foundations of the cathedral were laid, the crypt was\r\nplanned to receive the existing superstructure and no other.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Freeman, in his lecture published in the \"Records of\r\nGloucester Cathedral,\" says: \"The first thing we do know for certain is,\r\nthat in the year 1089, thirty-one years only after the dedication of\r\nEaldred's church, Serlo, the first Norman Abbot, began the building of a\r\nnew church, which was itself dedicated in 1100.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the record quoted by Mr W. H. Hart (\"Chartulary,\" i. 3), the first\r\nmention of the abbey is in 681, when it was founded by Osric, viceroy of\r\nKing Ethelred. It was dedicated to St. Peter, and Kyneburga (the sister\r\nof Osric) was the first Abbess of a double foundation for monks and\r\nnuns. She died in 710.\r\n\r\nOsric himself was buried in his church in 729 (Hart, i. 5), and his\r\nsister was buried near him, in front of the altar of St. Petronilla,\r\nwhich was on the north side of the then existing church.\r\n\r\nThe second Abbess was also a lady of royal descent, and widow of\r\nWulphere, King of the Mercians. She died in 735, and with Eve or Eva, or\r\nGaffa, her successor, who died in 769, the monastery came to an end.\r\n\r\nIn 823 a new _regime_ began--viz. that of secular priests, introduced by\r\nBeornwulf, King of Mercia, and the _Monasticon Anglicanum_ (Caley, i.\r\n563) says that he found the monastery \"_spoliatum et ruinosum_\" and\r\ntherefore rebuilt it. He also changed its constitution, by introducing\r\nsecular priests, of whom many were married to lawful wives, and who were\r\nvery little different in their way of living to other secular\r\nChristians. This state of things went on till 1022, when Cnut, as Leland\r\nsays, \"for ill lyvynge expellyd secular clerks, and by the counsell of\r\nWolstane (Wulfstan), Bysshope of Wurcestar, bringethe in monkes.\" The\r\nmonks introduced by Cnut were of the Benedictine rule, or Black monks,\r\nas Parker calls them in his \"Rhythmical History of the Abbey.\"\r\n\r\nThis change was effected about the same time in many other places in\r\nEngland, but was not generally popular, and certainly was not so in\r\nGloucester. Abbot Parker, in his rhyming account of the founding of the\r\nabbey, says that in 1030\r\n\r\n    \"A lord of great puissance, named Ulfine Le Rewe,\r\n      Was enjoyned by (the Pope) for ever to finde\r\n    Satisfying for the seaven priests that he slew,\r\n      7 monkes for them to pray world without minde.\"\r\n\r\nMr Hope, in his \"Notes on the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter at\r\nGloucester,\" 1897, p. 2, says: \"The Benedictines thus introduced by Cnut\r\ndo not seem to have been a success, and after an existence of\r\nthirty-seven years under a weak Abbot, whose long rule was marked by\r\ngreat decay of discipline, the '_Memoriale_' (Dugdale, i. 564) says:\r\n'God permitted them to be extirpated, and the monastery in which they\r\nwere established to be devoured by the fiercest flames, and the very\r\nfoundations and buildings to be rent asunder, razed to the ground, and\r\nutterly destroyed.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The monastery was next taken in hand by Aldred, Bishop of Worcester,\r\nwho in 1058 re-established the monks. He also began to build a new\r\nchurch from the foundations, and dedicated it in honour of St.\r\nPeter.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\"Until now the monastery seems to have occupied the same site throughout\r\nits chequered history; but the '_Memoriale_' states that Aldred began\r\nthe new church 'a little further from the place where it had first\r\nstood, and nearer to the side of the city.'\"\r\n\r\nThe language of these authorities is quite plain, but the interpretation\r\nthereof is not so evident. As Professor Freeman said: \"By the time when\r\nthe oldest church, of which we have any part remaining, came into being,\r\nthe Roman Wall, or at least this corner of it, must have pretty well\r\npassed away.\" It seems clear that the \"_side of the city_\" cannot refer\r\nto the Roman Wall. To quote Professor Freeman again: \"The existing\r\nchurch is something more than near to the Roman Wall. It actually stands\r\nover its north-west corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even under Aldred's auspices the monastery did not altogether flourish.\r\nBut this time it was through the fault of Aldred himself, for, on his\r\ntranslation to York in 1060, he retained very many of the possessions of\r\nthe abbey that had been pledged to him on account of his expenses in\r\nrepairing and re-edifying the church.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1072, Wilstan (Wulstan), the Abbot consecrated by Aldred in 1058,\r\ndied, and was succeeded by Serlo, who found the convent reduced to two\r\nmonks and eight novices. Through his energy the monastery increased to\r\nsuch an extent that in about fifteen years' time it became necessary to\r\nrebuild the monastery.\r\n\r\nThis rebuilding was begun exactly thirty-one years after Aldred had\r\nbuilt his church, _de nova_ and _a fundamentis_. Why was this necessary?\r\nProfessor Freeman says: \"The reason is not very far to seek for any one\r\nwho has really mastered the history of architecture during the eleventh\r\ncentury.... The simple fact is that the Norman prelates pulled down and\r\nrebuilt the English churches, mainly because they thought them too\r\nsmall.\" Further on he says: \"This proves that, of the two types of\r\nchurch which were in use side by side in the days of the Confessor,\r\nAldred had followed the older type. He had not conformed to the new\r\nNorman fashions, vast size among them, which were coming in after the\r\nexample of the king's own church at Westminster.... His church was built\r\nin the Primitive Romanesque style, the style common to England, with\r\nGermany, Italy, and Burgundy, not in the newly-developed style of\r\nNorthern Gaul. Therefore, neither its scale nor its style suited the\r\nideas of Abbot Serlo.[2] It was condemned, and the minster that now\r\nstands was begun.\"\r\n\r\nIn the MS. Lives of the Abbots in Queen's College Library, Oxford, it is\r\nstated that \"in A.D. 1089, on the day of the festival of the Apostles\r\nPeter and Paul, in this year were laid the foundations of the church\r\n(ecclesia) of Gloucester, the venerable man Robert, Bishop of Hereford,\r\nlaying the first stone, Serlo the Abbot being in charge of the work.\"\r\n(So, too, Hart, i. 11.)\r\n\r\nIn August 1089 there was an earthquake, which did serious damage to the\r\nthen existing building. Eleven years after this (1100), in the last year\r\nof the reign of William Rufus, \"the church,\" as Florence of Worcester\r\nwrote, \"which Abbot Serlo, of revered memory, had built from the\r\nfoundations at Gloucester, was dedicated (on Sunday, July 15th) with\r\ngreat pomp by Samson, Bishop of Worcester; Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester;\r\nGerard, Bishop of Hereford; and Herveas, Bishop of Bangor.\" This\r\ndedication under Serlo's _regime_ is the last authentic record for some\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNothing is known exactly as to how much of the building was completed by\r\n1100. Professor Freeman points out that eleven years was quite long\r\nenough for its building, and that there is no hint in the local\r\nchronicle of any additions being made to the building dedicated in 1100.\r\nProbably part of the church was finished for the dedication, such as the\r\npresbytery, choir, the transepts, the Abbot's cloister, the\r\nchapter-house, and the greater part, at any rate, of the nave.\r\n\r\nThe nave, though so different in scale as compared with the original\r\nchoir, must have been built very early in the twelfth century, and, like\r\nthe rest of the building, originally had a wooden roof.\r\n\r\nIn 1101 or 1102 damage was done to the building by fire, notably the\r\nchapter-house, and again in 1122. Possibly in this latter fire the nave\r\nroof was destroyed, and of this fire the piers in the nave show traces.\r\nOf the same date must be much of the strengthening masonry in the crypt,\r\nthe Prior's lodging, the chapel, and the slype beneath it.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Abbey buildings were surrounded by Abbot Peter with a\r\nstone wall, and the necessary gates--viz. the great gatehouse on the\r\nwest, another on the south, and a third more to the east. All these can\r\nbe identified from the small plan of the monastic buildings, reproduced\r\n(p. 103), by permission of Mr F. S. Waller. The Saxon Chronicle tells us\r\nthat in 1122, while the monks were singing mass, fire burst out from the\r\nupper part of the steeple, and burnt the whole monastery. Some time\r\nbetween 1164 and 1179 one of the western towers, probably the south-west\r\ntower, fell down. Fire in 1190 is said to have destroyed the greater\r\npart of the city, as well as almost all the buildings in the outer\r\ncourt. Helias, the sacrist, also made new stalls for the monks in the\r\nchoir. Of these Early English stalls, a fragment has been thoughtfully\r\nand carefully preserved behind the seat of the Canon in residence.\r\n\r\nIn 1222 we learn from Hart, i. 25, that the great eastern tower was\r\nbuilt under the direction of Helias of Hereford, the sacrist. Of this\r\ntower no traces now remain. Helias built his superstructure on the\r\nNorman work that we see in the nave.\r\n\r\nThe Early English Lady Chapel was said to have been built between the\r\nyears 1224-1227 by Ralph of Wylington, and Olympias his wife, and\r\nendowed with lands.\r\n\r\nThe church was dedicated again in 1239, in Abbot Foliot's time, by\r\nWalter of Cantelupe, \"the patriot prelate who, six-and-twenty years\r\nlater, stood by Earl Simon on the day of martyrdom at Evesham.\"\r\n\r\nThree years after the dedication in 1242 alterations in the triforium of\r\nthe nave were made, and the stone vaulting was done by the monks\r\nthemselves. It was a very laudable object, but they effectually spoiled\r\nthe nave. The same year saw the beginning of the rebuilding of the\r\nsouth-west tower, and it was finished before 1246. If this was the tower\r\nthat collapsed in 1170, the monks would seem to have somewhat neglected\r\ntheir duty to the fabric. The Norman refectory or \"frater\" was\r\ndemolished in 1246, and the new one begun. This building stood to the\r\nnorth of the cloisters, and was pulled down at the Dissolution. Of the\r\nEarly English infirmary or \"farmery\" traces remain near the Bishop's\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nIn this place we may refer incidentally to Gloucester Hall, Oxford,\r\nwhich college was founded in 1283 as a residence for thirteen monks, to\r\nbe chosen out of the brotherhood at Gloucester, and sent to study at\r\nOxford. The hall was empowered later on to receive students from other\r\nBenedictine foundations, and the buildings were enlarged for this\r\npurpose in 1298.\r\n\r\nFire again ravaged the Abbey and its precincts in 1300, on the feast of\r\nthe Epiphany. \"It began in a timbered house in the great court, from\r\nwhich it spread to the small bell-tower, the great camera, and the\r\ncloister\" (Hope, 36). Mr Hope thinks this bell-tower was either a single\r\nwestern tower, as formerly there was at Hereford, or else a Norman\r\nnorth-west tower, and that the great camera was part of the Abbot's\r\nhouse, now the Deanery. Professor Freeman thinks that the small\r\nbell-tower or _parvum campanile_ was so called as being less in height\r\nthan the south-west tower rebuilt in 1245-6.\r\n\r\nIn this same fire the Norman dorter or dormitory suffered considerable\r\ndamage. It was pulled down three years later, and a new one, which took\r\nten years to build, was opened for use in 1313, after being blessed and\r\nsprinkled with holy water by the Bishop of St. David's. 1318 is a date\r\nof importance in the history of the Abbey. John Thokey, Abbot from\r\n1307-1329, made many changes. He reconstructed the south aisle of the\r\nnave to save the south side from collapse. The windows on the outside\r\nhave been restored, but the buttresses have been very little touched.\r\nMost of the tracery in the windows of the aisles and chapels of the\r\nchoir, and the triforium of the choir, date back to his time.\r\n\r\nThokey, between 1316-1329 built the new camera of the Abbot, beside the\r\ninfirmary garden (Hart, i. 55).\r\n\r\nThokey's successor, Wygmore, carried out the works planned previously,\r\nand in 1331-1337 the south transept was recased, and vaulted practically\r\nas we see it to-day, in the style now known as Perpendicular. Part of\r\nthe front of the Deanery is presumably of the same date, though many\r\nlater alterations have been made in it. Wygmore also built the double\r\nscreen (_vide_ p. 44) which separated the nave from the choir. \"Parts of\r\nit,\" says Mr Hope, \"are worked up in the present screen,\" and he quotes\r\nHart, i. 47, to show that Wygmore was buried in 1337, \"before the\r\nSalutation of the Blessed Mary in the entry of the quire on the south\r\nside, which he himself constructed with the pulpitum (or loft) in the\r\nsame place.\"\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the Norman minster had thus begun. In the days of\r\nAdam de Staunton (1337-1357) the great vault of the choir was made at a\r\ngreat expense, together with the stalls on the Priors' side--_i.e._ the\r\nnorth side.\r\n\r\nThe oblations at the tomb of Edward II. rendered much of his extensive\r\nwork practicable, as the funds of the Abbey were becoming exhausted.\r\n\r\nThomas Horton (1351-1377) finished the work, comprising the high altar,\r\nwith the presbytery, the stalls on the Abbot's side, or south side of\r\nthe choir. (Hart, i. 49.)\r\n\r\nHe also caused to be made the images and tabernacle work at the entrance\r\nof the choir on the north side, and in the six years, ending with 1374,\r\nhe completed the casing of the north transept, defraying the greater\r\npart of the cost himself (L444, 0s. 2d. out of a total sum of L781, 0s.\r\n2d.).\r\n\r\nHorton also built \"the Abbot's chapel near the garden of the infirmary,\r\nthe covered camera of the monks' hostelry, and the great hall in the\r\ncourt, where the king afterwards held his Parliament in 1378.\" (Hart, i.\r\n48, 50.)\r\n\r\nThe present cloister, as far as the door of the chapter-house, is also\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nThis important work was for many years unfinished, but was completed by\r\nFroucester in the years 1381-1407. As Leland says, \"he made the cloyster\r\na right goodly and sumptuous piece of worke.\"\r\n\r\nIn the one hundred and thirty years that elapsed between the finishing\r\nof the cloisters and the Dissolution many further important changes took\r\nplace, both in the interior and in the exterior of the fabric.\r\n\r\nJohn Morwent (1421-1437), utterly destroyed the west front, with its two\r\ntowers, which, in the opinion of many, may have been counterparts of\r\nthose at Tewkesbury. To him also is credited, mainly on Leland's\r\nauthority, the insertion of the south porch.\r\n\r\nAbbot Seabroke (1450-1457) took down the tower as far as the Norman\r\npiers, and built the present beautiful structure. He died before it was\r\nfinished, and Robert Tully, one of the monks of the monastery, carried\r\nout the work, as the inscription on the wall in the interior (_vide_ p.\r\n63) testifies.\r\n\r\nBefore the tower was complete, the present Lady Chapel (which was\r\nfinished before 1500) was begun by Abbot Hanley, and finished by Abbot\r\nFarley.\r\n\r\nJohn the Baptist's Chapel is usually ascribed to Abbot John Browne (or\r\nNewton), from the similarity of his initials to those of the saint.\r\n\r\nThe eastern bay of the chapter-house dates back to Abbot Hanley's\r\ntime--_i.e._ between 1457-1472.\r\n\r\nIn 1540 Henry VIII. sent his commissioners, and they demanded the\r\nsurrender of the Abbey to the king. This cannot have been a surprise to\r\nany of the monks who were in the Abbey at the time. As far back as 1534\r\nthey had all been compelled to take the oath by which they acknowledged\r\nthe king as supreme head of the Church of England, and denied that any\r\nforeign bishop had any authority in these realms.\r\n\r\nThe monks, too, had seen the smaller monasteries in Gloucester dissolved\r\ntwo years before, and the more thoughtful of them must have foreseen\r\nthat it was a mere question of time for the greedy king to absorb the\r\nlarger monasteries as well.\r\n\r\nAbbot Parker's tomb, and also that of King Osric, practically date\r\nthemselves, and of the same period are presumably the gateway into\r\nPalace Yard, and part of the Abbot's lodging on the site of the present\r\nBishop's Palace. From Leland we learn that the south gate--_i.e._ King\r\nEdward's gate--is of the same date, having been rebuilt by Osborne the\r\ncellarer.\r\n\r\nThe library, and the set of rooms beneath it, now used as vestry and\r\npractice-room for the choir, are perhaps the latest additions to the\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nAt the Dissolution the Abbey which had \"existed for more than eight\r\ncenturies under different forms, in poverty and in wealth, in meanness\r\nand in magnificence, in misfortune and success, finally succumbed to the\r\nroyal will. The day came, and that a drear winter day, when its last\r\nmass was sung, its last censer waved, its last congregation bent in rapt\r\nand lowly adoration before the altar there; and, doubtless, as the last\r\ntones of that day's evensong died away in the vaulted roof, there were\r\nnot wanting those who lingered in the solemn stillness of the old\r\nmassive pile, and who, as the lights disappeared one by one, felt that\r\nthere was a void which could never be filled, because their old abbey,\r\nwith its beautiful services, its frequent means of grace, its\r\nhospitality to strangers, and its loving care for God's poor, had\r\npassed away like a morning dream, and was gone for ever.\" (Hart, iii.\r\n49.)\r\n\r\nThe charter of Henry VIII. founding the see is too long to quote _in\r\nextenso_, but it stated that \"Whereas the great convent or monastery,\r\nwhich, whilst still in being, was called the monastery of St. Peter of\r\nGloucester, ... and all and singular its manors, ... and possessions,\r\nfor certain special and urgent causes were, by Gabriel Moreton, Prior of\r\nthe said abbey or monastery and the convent thereof, lately given and\r\ngranted to us and our heirs for ever.... We, being influenced by divine\r\ngoodness, and desiring above all things, that true religion, and the\r\ntrue worship of God may not only not be abolished, but entirely restored\r\nto the primitive and genuine rule of simplicity; and that all those\r\nenormities may be corrected into which the lives and profession of the\r\nmonks for a long time had deplorably lapsed, have, as far as human\r\nfrailty will permit, endeavoured to the utmost that for the future the\r\npure word of God may be taught in that place, good discipline\r\npreserved....\"\r\n\r\nThe charter goes on to say that, \"considering the site of the said late\r\nmonastery in which many famous monuments of our renowned ancestors,\r\nKings of England, are erected, is a very fit and proper place ... we\r\nhave decreed that the site of the said monastery be an episcopal see....\r\nWe also will and ordain that the said Dean and Prebendaries, and their\r\nsuccessors, shall for ever hereafter be called the Dean and Chapter of\r\nthe Holy and Individed Trinity of Gloucester.\" Henry also assigned to\r\nthe Bishop all the premises formerly occupied by the Abbot.\r\n\r\nIn 1576 the fabric seems to have been in want of considerable repair,\r\nand in 1616, when Dr Laud was Dean, it was said of it that \"there was\r\nscarcely a church in England so much in decay.\" The Dean procured an Act\r\nof the Chapter, by which the sum of L60 per annum was to be allowed for\r\nrepairs.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the civil war it suffered less than might have been\r\nexpected. It was subsequently in danger of total destruction from the\r\nmachinations of some persons, who are said \"to have agreed amongst\r\nthemselves for their several proportions of the plunder expected out of\r\nit.\" The little cloisters and the Lady Chapel were begun to be pulled\r\ndown, and \"instruments and tackle provided for to take down the tower,\"\r\nbut in 1657 the church was made over by grant to the mayor and burgesses\r\nat their request, and from this it is to be assumed that they wished to\r\nprevent it from possible ruin. Mr Dorney, speaking in 1653, recommends\r\nto the officers of the city then elected, \"that they would, together\r\nwith others, join their shoulders to hold up the stately fabric of the\r\nCollege Church, the great ornament of this city, which some do say is\r\nnow in danger of falling.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1679 we find an insensate prebendary securing an order from the\r\nChapter for destroying some of the old glass in the west window of the\r\nchoir. Bishop Benson (1734-1752) spent vast sums of money on the\r\nbuilding, and to him are due the paving of the nave, and pinnacles to\r\nthe Lady Chapel, which were removed at a recent restoration. A stone\r\nscreen (removed in 1820) was erected at the entrance to the choir by\r\nthis energetic Bishop, and his architect, Kent, in whose hands he was,\r\nsuggested the fluting of the pillars of the nave.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, in 1847, under the energetic administration of Dr\r\nJeune, the Treasurer, extensive repairs and improvements were begun by\r\nMr F. S. Waller. The crypt was drained, concreted, and later on glazed.\r\nThe grounds round the cathedral have been lowered, enlarged, and laid\r\nout, and the drainage has been properly done. Of the restorations during\r\nthe last fifty years mention has been made in detail in the description\r\nof the various parts of the building that have been restored, and there\r\nis no need to repeat.\r\n\r\nRestoration is a cause of much strife, and in the hands of many\r\narchitects it means destruction of the original features of the\r\nbuilding. Gloucester has suffered somewhat at the hands of Sir Gilbert\r\nScott, but probably not a tithe of what would have been inflicted upon\r\nit had Wyatt been turned loose with an absolutely free hand. Mr Waller,\r\nwriting in 1890, said: \"Forty years ago everything not 'Gothic' (the\r\nfashion of the day) was destroyed; but were it possible now to reinstate\r\nthe Chapter-House book-cases, the Renaissance Reredos of the Choir,\r\nWygmore's pulpit, the aisle screens, the remains of the Rood Loft, and\r\nthe Choir fittings, and to put them all back--odd mixture as they would\r\nbe--to the positions they occupied in 1727, few would be found to\r\nobject, even though the replacement of the monuments on the columns of\r\nthe nave became one of the conditions.\"--Truly \"_Tempora mutantur_,\"\r\nand fortunately _nos et mutamur in illis_.\r\n\r\n#Dedication.#--The building of Osric was dedicated to St Peter by\r\nTheodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bosel, Bishop of Worcester. When\r\nBishop Wulfstan ejected the secular canons, and brought in his\r\nBenedictine monks, he reconsecrated it to St. Peter and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nBishop Aldred after building _de novo_ re-dedicated the church to St.\r\nPeter, as the chief of the apostles. Abbot Serlo seems to have\r\nremembered the earlier dedication to St. Peter and St. Paul, for he\r\ncaused the foundation-stone to be laid in 1089 on the festival of those\r\ntwo apostles in June, but his dedication in 1100 was to St. Peter. Both\r\nSt. Peter and St. Paul are now represented among the statues on the\r\nfront of the south porch. After the dissolution of the monastery Henry\r\nVIII. ascribed the Cathedral Church to the Holy and Individed Trinity.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral is traditionally by many called \"St. Peter's,\" and by some\r\n\"The Abbey Church,\" but this, of course, is quite inaccurate.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of the question of the dedication, the arms of the see may be\r\nbriefly considered.\r\n\r\nThe original arms were Azure, two keys in saltire, or.\r\n\r\nBy the fifteenth century the sword for St. Paul had become incorporated\r\nwith the crossed keys, and it is found upon the bells and also on the\r\neast side of the organ case. At the Dissolution the arms were Gules, two\r\nkeys in saltire surmounted by a sword in pale, argent. Brown Willis, in\r\n1727, wrote that \"the old arms of this see as used 100 years ago, were\r\nthree chevronels, the middle one charged with a mitre, but the bishops\r\nnow give _Azure, two keys in saltire, or._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [1] So says the MS. Lives of the Abbots in the Library of Queen's\r\n    College, Oxford.\r\n\r\n    [2] Formerly a canon of the Church of Avranches, and afterwards a\r\n    monk in the Church of Mont St. Michel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EXTERIOR\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the building as originally constructed, practically the whole, as far\r\nas the outline is concerned, may be said to remain as it was at the\r\nbeginning of the twelfth century. The massive Norman nave, the slype or\r\ncovered passage that is between the Deanery and the north-west wall of\r\nthe cathedral, the two transepts with their turrets, the choir with its\r\nvarious chapels and aisles, the chapter-house, and the Abbot's cloister,\r\nare all parts of the original building, although later additions have\r\npartly concealed them.\r\n\r\nIn Mr Waller's \"Notes and Sketches of Gloucester Cathedral\"[1] a very\r\ninteresting view is given of the cathedral stripped of every addition of\r\na later date than the original structure, and by his permission it is\r\nhere reproduced.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this sketch Mr Waller says:\r\n\r\n     \"This sketch is given to shew what is left of the old Abbey Church\r\n     of the twelfth century, and looking to the fact that it was not too\r\n     reliable a structure to begin with, as regards foundation and\r\n     settlements (not forgetting the \"earthquake\"), it certainly is\r\n     wonderful what extraordinary liberties have been taken with the old\r\n     fabric, and what really great risks have been incurred. Look at and\r\n     consider this sketch with reference to the building as it now\r\n     stands, and excepting in the aisles of the Choir, the north aisle\r\n     of the Nave, and part of the Chapter-Room, where the original\r\n     vaulting remains, it will be seen that it is a _mere shell_, the\r\n     walls have been pulled about in the most reckless manner, and in\r\n     all directions, and in the Choir they have actually been pared down\r\n     and an outer casing has been entirely removed--large pieces have\r\n     been cut out of the piers for the introduction of monuments\r\n     (mediaeval, not modern!), window heads have been removed to make way\r\n     for the more recent works, and nearly the whole of the Cathedral\r\n     has been covered with a sort of applique work of mullions and\r\n     tracery, erected chiefly in the fourteenth century (see sketch on\r\n     plate 4). The large central Tower (forty feet square on the leads)\r\n     has been built on the old Norman walls; new walls, new vaulting,\r\n     and new roofs have been erected on old foundations; and, strange to\r\n     say, scarcely a settlement of any kind can be seen in any of the\r\n     building operations which have been undertaken since 1200! It is\r\n     not too much to say that a man of the present day who would even\r\n     suggest such works as have been here successfully accomplished,\r\n     would be most severely condemned; but in those days the Abbots had\r\n     only themselves to please, there were no well-educated reporters\r\n     and writers to discuss their doings in morning papers: they felt,\r\n     therefore, quite at their ease, hoping for the best, and in this\r\n     instance succeeding admirably, not only as regards their own wishes\r\n     and intentions, but in leaving for posterity a splendid\r\n     architectural history in stone.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The plan of the building is cruciform, and consists of a Nave and\r\n     Choir, with Aisles on the north and south sides of each; North and\r\n     South Transepts, at the intersection of which with the Choir rises\r\n     the Tower; and at intervals round the Choir Aisles are four small\r\n     apsidal Chapels. At the east end is the Lady-Chapel, prior to the\r\n     erection of which, a fifth Chapel, similar in form and dimensions\r\n     to the other four, existed at the east end; as may be seen in the\r\n     plan of the Crypt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORMAN REMAINS\r\n\r\n               Remove from the Building all that has been erected since\r\n               A.D. 1200, and this sketch will be found to fairly\r\n               represent that which is left of the Church of the 11th\r\n               and 12th centuries.\r\n\r\n               From a Drawing by F. S. Waller, F.R.I.B.A.]\r\n\r\nThe whole building, according to Professor Willis, is full of peculiar\r\nfancies, which all appear to be characteristic of a school of masons who\r\nwere extremely skilful, and glad of an opportunity of showing their\r\nskill. The mediaeval masons, he thinks, were \"perfectly practical and\r\nmost ingenious men; they worked experimentally: if their buildings were\r\nstrong enough, there they stood; if they were too strong, they also\r\nstood; but if they were too weak they gave way, and they put props and\r\nbuilt the next stronger.\" That was their science--and very good\r\npractical science it was--but in many cases they imperilled their work,\r\nand gave trouble to future restorers.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the buildings differs in one very essential point\r\nfrom almost every other in the kingdom. The cloisters and the claustral\r\nbuildings were, as a rule, on the south side of the church, for the sake\r\nof shelter, and also of sunshine. At Gloucester they are on the north\r\nside of the church, the reason being (according to Mr Fosbroke) that\r\nwhen Aldred laid the new foundations farther south, the cloisters found\r\nthemselves on the north side.\r\n\r\nDallaway has said very truly that \"Few churches in England exhibit so\r\ncomplete a school of Gothic in all its gradations from the time of the\r\nConquest as the Cathedral of Gloucester.\" This is true with the\r\nexception that of \"Decorated\" architecture there are but few examples,\r\nand it is probable that very little new work was done in connection with\r\nthis cathedral until the monastery became vastly enriched by Abbot\r\nThokey's policy in causing the body of Edward II. to be brought from\r\nBerkeley Castle for interment in his abbey. It is said that the amount\r\nof offerings made at the tomb during the reign of Edward III. was enough\r\nto have entirely rebuilt the abbey. In consequence of this the Cathedral\r\nis full of some of the finest examples of the styles known as\r\n\"Transition from Decorated to Perpendicular\" (anticipative\r\nPerpendicular) and pure \"Perpendicular\"--a style which, in Professor\r\nWillis's opinion, originated at Gloucester. From every side there is\r\nsomething to interest the careful observer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE SOUTH-WEST.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, visitors see it first from the south side, and the south-west\r\ngeneral view is one of the best, equalled, but not surpassed, by that\r\nfrom the north-west. The north view from the Great Western Railway, with\r\nthe school playing-fields in the foreground, makes a striking picture,\r\nbut it is more sombre than the picture formed by the south front. Viewed\r\nfrom the north-west corner of the cloister-garth, the pile is seen\r\nperhaps at its best. From this point it is easy to study so much of the\r\nvaried architecture of the whole, and with little effort to transport\r\nthe mind back for a space of four hundred years. The eye first rests\r\nupon the turf of the garth, now tastefully laid out after many years of\r\ncomparative neglect. Flanking the garth on every side are the exquisite\r\nwindows of the Cloister--a cloister which no other can surpass. Above\r\nthe Cloister will be seen on the eastern side the sober, impressive\r\nNorman work of the Chapter-House in which so much of our English history\r\nhas been made. To the south of this is the Library, built close against\r\nthe walls of the north transept, which tower above, and lead the eye\r\nupward to the great tower which, \"in the middest of the church,\" crowns\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL, FROM THE NORTH-WEST CORNER OF THE\r\n               CLOISTERS.]\r\n\r\nLooking for a moment at the Norman windows in the north aisle, one sees\r\nhow they have been altered in their details since they were built,\r\nthough their bold outline remains the same. The windows in the\r\nclerestory tell the tale of a later time, probably that of Abbot\r\nMorwent.\r\n\r\nThe #West Front.#--Compared with many others of our cathedral fronts,\r\nthis front may seem to be of less interest, but it has the great beauty\r\nof simplicity, which prevents it, when viewed in the foreground, from\r\nkilling the rest of the picture. The buttresses of the great window are\r\ningeniously pierced, so as not to cut off the light; and the parapets,\r\nalso of pierced or open work, should be carefully noted.\r\n\r\nPlain transoms cross the lights, whereas in the inside the tracery and\r\ncusping is elaborate. This will be noted also in the east window of the\r\nchoir and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf the western towers which formerly existed no traces now remain. The\r\nnorth-west tower, owing to badly-made foundations, collapsed in the\r\nlatter half of the twelfth century between 1163-1179.\r\n\r\nA south-west tower was begun in 1242 by Walter de St. John, Prior at the\r\ntime, and subsequently Abbot for a few weeks, and it was finished by his\r\nsuccessor, John de la Feld.\r\n\r\nWhen Abbot Morwent altered the west end and front, the western towers\r\ndisappeared altogether. This front was restored carefully, where\r\nnecessary, in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe #South Porch.#--This portion of the building is the work of Morwent,\r\nwho was Abbot from 1421-1437. The rich front of what Bonner called\r\n\"Saracenic work,\" was formerly disfigured by an uninteresting dial with\r\nthe motto _Pereunt et imputantur_. This was removed at the Restoration,\r\nwhen the canopies were restored, and niches filled with statues by\r\nRedfern. Over the doorway in the centre, stand St. Peter and St. Paul,\r\nand the four Evangelists. Below are King Osric and Abbot Serlo, the two\r\nfounders of the Abbey Church. The four figures in the niches of the\r\nbuttresses represent St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St.\r\nGregory. The windows of the porch have been formed by piercing the\r\ninternal tracery. This has a very curious effect when viewed from the\r\ninside. From the outside the windows do not seem unusual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tower from the Palace-yards Drawn by E. J. Burrow.]\r\n\r\n#The Porch# was in such a very ruinous state, that it was scarcely\r\npossible to use any of the old stone on the outside. Within, the old\r\nwork can be seen, and the bosses are worthy of attention. Over the porch\r\nis an unfinished parvise. The doors are very good specimens of\r\nfifteenth-century work.\r\n\r\nThe #South Transept# (or St. Andrew's Aisle), as far as the walls are\r\nconcerned, is thought by some to have been built by Serlo, but there\r\nhave been so many alterations in the exterior that it is difficult to\r\nsay anything with certainty. Fosbroke, writing at the end of last\r\ncentury, noted that there was an inscription on the outside wall making\r\nmention of one William Pipard, who was sheriff of the county about sixty\r\nyears after Serlo's time. The windows have been enlarged and much\r\naltered, and later tracery has been inserted.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the many alterations and some restoration, the south front\r\nof this transept contains much interesting Norman work, which has been\r\nre-used in a very clever way. The square flanking towers, with their\r\nlater spires, the arcading over the head of the window, and the graceful\r\ncurve in the battlement are all worthy of attention, and will serve to\r\nconfuse visitors before they realise that the Norman architecture is\r\nconcealed under a later casing, and that there is a great deal of old\r\nwork re-used in the new.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious buttress, too, which goes across the west window of\r\nthis transept to strengthen the south-west corner of the great tower. In\r\nfact, the south side of the church is the only side that, as builders\r\nsay, has \"settled\" at all.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a Roman tesselated pavement was discovered near the south front\r\nof this transept.\r\n\r\n#The Tower.#--Of all the exterior beauties, the most striking is the\r\nbeautiful and graceful tower. Placed where it is, almost in the centre\r\nof the long line of the nave, continued in the choir and Lady Chapel, at\r\nthe point where the transept line intersects it, it is the chief feature\r\nof the massive pile. All else seems to be grouped with a view to the\r\nenhancing of the effect of the central position of the tower. The other\r\nmembers of the building seem merely to be steps, by means of which\r\napproach can be made to it. It is the grandest and most impressive\r\nfeature of the outside. No matter from whence one looks at it, the charm\r\nis there. Seen from the gardens in the side streets close by when the\r\npear-trees are in bloom, or in the full blaze of a hot summer day, or\r\nagain later in the autumn when the leaves are beginning to turn, or,\r\nbetter still, in snow time, it is always full of beauty. On a bright hot\r\nday the pinnacles seem so far off in the haze as to suggest a dream of\r\nfairyland. On a wet day, after a shower, the tower has the appearance of\r\nbeing so close at hand that it almost seems to speak. Viewed by\r\nmoonlight, the tower has an unearthly look, which cannot well be\r\ndescribed. The tower is 225 feet high to the top of the pinnacles, and\r\nthe effect of it is extremely fine. From the main cornice upwards, the\r\nwhole of the stonework is open, and composed of what at a distance\r\nappears to be delicate tracery, and mullions, and crocketed pinnacles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL IN 1727. From an old Print.]\r\n\r\nIt is, in all probability, the third tower that has been built since\r\nAldred's time. There are piers still remaining of the Norman tower\r\nerected by Serlo in the years that elapsed between 1089 and 1100; and,\r\nas we are told in the \"Saxon Chronicle,\" that in 1122 a fire which\r\noriginated in the upper part of the steeple burnt the whole monastery,\r\nit must be inferred that the superstructure was of wood. A hundred years\r\nlater it is known that the great eastern tower was built with the help\r\nof Helias of Hereford. This tower was in great part taken down by the\r\nmonk Tully, and rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in the time of Abbot\r\nSeabroke (1450-1457).\r\n\r\nThe #Bells# at Gloucester are peculiarly interesting from the fact of\r\ntheir age, and from the fact that they escaped the clutches of the\r\ndespoilers at the time of the Dissolution. The truth of the matter seems\r\nto be that all the \"Churche goods, money, juells, plate, vestments,\r\nornaments, and bells\" had been inventoried and handed over to the king's\r\ncommissioners in Bishop Hooper's time. The commissioners returned to the\r\nDean and Chapter \"to and for the use and behouf of the seid Churche, one\r\nchalys being silver and whole gilte without a paten waying xi oz. and\r\nalso one grete bell whereuppon the cloke strykithe, and eight other\r\ngrete bells whereupon the chyme goethe hangynge in the towre there\r\nwithin the seid church save and surely to be kept untill the King's\r\nMajesty's pleasure shall be therein further knowen.\" This was dated May\r\n27th, 1553, and as the king died within three months his pleasure in the\r\nmatter was never \"further knowen,\" and Gloucester rejoices still in its\r\nbells.\r\n\r\nThe chimes[2] play four tunes, which are changed every other day. The\r\nfirst tune was composed by Dr Jefferies in 1791; the second by Dr Hayes,\r\nwho died 1777; the third by Dr Malchair, 1760-1770; and the fourth by Dr\r\nStevens. The composers of the second and fourth tunes were both natives\r\nof Gloucester, and at one time choristers in the cathedral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOUTH PORCH (SINCE THE RESTORATION).]\r\n\r\n\"The shape of the east end of the old Church, as will be seen by a\r\nreference to the ground plan and plan of the Crypt, is partly round and\r\npartly polygonal; round as regards the outer wall of the main building\r\nand the inside and outside of the small Chapels in the Crypt, but\r\npolygonal in the interior walls of the main building in the Crypt;\r\nwhereas on the ground-floor the main building and the Chapels are all\r\npolygonal.[3] An examination of the remains of the Eastern Arches, as\r\nseen above the last Norman piers eastward of the Choir, shows the\r\ndirection of the lines distinctly, following as they do the lines of the\r\nCrypt below, but with less heavy construction. The whole of the edifice,\r\nwith the exception of the Lady Chapel and the Cloisters, remains, as\r\nregards general outline, as it stood in the early part of the twelfth\r\ncentury. (See illustration, p. 15.) The Nave with its large circular\r\ncolumns, the slype adjoining the Deanery (probably indicating the extent\r\nwestwards of the Norman Towers prior to the erection of the present west\r\nend), the North and South Transepts, with their Turrets at the west and\r\neast angles, the Choir and its Aisles and Chapels, the Chapter-House and\r\nAbbot's Cloister, although more or less masked by later additions, are\r\nall parts of the original building.\"\r\n\r\nThe method of joining the Lady Chapel to the choir is best noticed from\r\nthe outside. It is a piece of exceedingly clever and graceful\r\nconstruction, and there is the minimum of obstruction to the light\r\npassing through to the east window, and the maximum of support to the\r\nelliptical east window.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature in this part of the exterior is the\r\nconstruction of the two passages--chiefly of re-used Norman work--which\r\nmake up the greater part of the so-called Whispering Gallery--_i.e._ the\r\npassage connecting the north and the south triforium of the choir.\r\n\r\nOne of the distinguishing features of the exterior of the building is\r\nthe variety and arrangement of the battlements and pinnacles. Bishop\r\nBenson did his best to spoil the effect of those on the Lady Chapel by\r\nremoving the upper part of the parapet and by substituting other\r\npinnacles. These have been restored, but the east-end pinnacles do not\r\nseem quite in keeping with Gloucester. Viewing the Lady Chapel from the\r\nnorth side, the play of light through the windows on the south side has\r\na very grand effect. Under the east end of the Lady Chapel is a passage\r\nwhich has given rise to much speculation in bygone times.\r\n\r\nThe #Lady Chapel# at the time of its erection was carried out to the\r\nfarthest limit of the land possessed by the Abbey, shown on the plan at\r\nF.F. As the east wall of the chapel was actually on the western boundary\r\nwall the passage was made to give access from the north to the south of\r\nthe grounds, without the need of going right round the precincts by the\r\nwest front.\r\n\r\nModern improvements have increased the facilities for studying and\r\nadmiring the building. In 1847-8 the garden was laid out, and from it\r\nthe outside can easily be carefully examined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PISCINA IN THE TRIFORIUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [1] This is now out of print.\r\n\r\n    [2] They have lately been undergoing repair, and will soon be in\r\n    working order again.\r\n\r\n    [3] James Fergusson, writing to Mr. Waller on the above subject,\r\n    says: \"It is curious that polygonal forms should be used in this\r\n    country in the eleventh century, whilst at Caen and on the Continent\r\n    generally circular forms prevailed well into the twelfth century.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INTERIOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The most-detailed description of architectural works must fail to\r\nconvey to the mind so clear and correct an impression, as the graphic\r\nrepresentation of the objects themselves does to the eye; and the more\r\nlaboured the attempt to describe in words the position, the arrangement,\r\nthe form and magnitude of the several parts, the more the picture\r\nbecomes confused, and the less likely to answer the purpose\" (_Quart.\r\nRev._, No. 37, 179).\r\n\r\nHow far the above statement is of universal application is not a matter\r\nto be here discussed, but it will be appreciated to the full by anyone\r\nwho attempts to describe, within definite and narrow limits, the many\r\nbeauties of one of our finest cathedrals, such as Gloucester undoubtedly\r\nis.\r\n\r\nTo fully appreciate the beauty of the cathedral, it must be studied\r\nunder different aspects and at different times. Much will depend upon\r\nthe mood of the visitor, much, too, upon the time of day. The Lady\r\nChapel at 7 A.M. is quite a different thing from the Lady Chapel at\r\n10:30 or 12 noon, though always beautiful. The same holds good with the\r\nchoir and the nave. A slanting light through the south clerestory\r\nplaying fitfully upon the lace-work of the north side of the choir, or\r\nthe sturdy pillars of the ever-impressive nave, gives a charm that\r\ncannot be described.\r\n\r\nHow grand a sight, too, it is when the nave is almost in darkness--save\r\nfor eight or ten small jets of light overhead--to see the choir lighted\r\nup, with the organ standing out in strong relief against the blaze of\r\nlight below and behind it, and now and then a gleam of light showing\r\nthrough as the door under the screen is opened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NAVE, LOOKING EAST.]\r\n\r\nThen, again, note and study the marvellous effects of sound in the\r\nbuilding. Listen, if possible, from the Lady Chapel, to an anthem by\r\nsome old composer; listen to Bach's G minor fugue from the triforium of\r\nthe choir, and hear the echoes rolling from pier to pier; listen to the\r\nHallelujah Chorus sung on some great festival service in the nave, or\r\nsome simple well-known hymn sung by close upon 3000 people, and the\r\nlistener will have some idea of the effect that mere sound, taken as\r\nsuch, can produce.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Stainer's Gregorian _Miserere_, sung entirely\r\nunaccompanied, as heard from the great west door, is grand in the\r\nextreme. It needs but little imagination to take oneself back, say, four\r\nhundred years, and picture the monks singing the very same Psalm.\r\n\r\nThe tiles in an ancient building are always of interest, and Gloucester\r\ncontains many that are worth inspection. There are some in the choir and\r\nits chapels, and there are some in the Lady Chapel; others may be found\r\nnear Raikes' monument, exposed to view in the south aisle. There are\r\nalso some in the south-east chapel of the triforium of the choir. The\r\nchapter-house tiles are modern (Minton), but were made after the tiles\r\nthat were in existence there.\r\n\r\nThe nave was originally tiled, and specimens have been found when\r\nexcavations have been made. In the days that are to come, possibly, the\r\nGeorgian flooring may be taken up, and the tiles now hidden from view\r\nwill be revealed in places where they have not been broken up, where\r\ngraves have been dug in the nave and aisles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the weakest point in the cathedral is the modern glass. There is\r\nmuch that shows careful work and thought, but there has been no\r\nsystematic controlling spirit at work to suggest, to guide, or to check.\r\nThe chief blots, too, are the so-called memorial windows, and the reason\r\nis not hard to find. It is well put by Mr Ruskin, who, in his \"Seven\r\nLamps of Architecture,\" says: \"The peculiar manner of selfish and\r\nimpious ostentation, provoked by the glassmakers for a stimulus to\r\ntrade, of putting up painted windows to be records of private affection,\r\ninstead of universal religion, is one of the worst, because most\r\nplausible and proud, hypocrisies of our day.\"\r\n\r\nJust imagine the difference in the south aisle, for instance, if there\r\nhad been a scheme carefully planned beforehand for the windows, instead\r\nof the threefold, but haphazard, process of a window offered, a window\r\naccepted, a window put up, and no questions asked as to designer or\r\nartist. Imagine what the effect might, or would, have been, had the\r\nwindows, as a set, been designed by Burne-Jones and executed by William\r\nMorris, or by other competent artists. Now, unfortunately, these two\r\ngreat artists are dead, and Gloucester has not a single specimen of\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nThe #Nave# as it is (174 feet by 34 1/4 feet long, 67 feet 7 inches high)\r\nis quite unique, and differs considerably from other Norman naves, such\r\nas are to be found in the cathedrals at Ely, Norwich, or Peterborough,\r\nand in the neighbouring abbey churches at Tewkesbury, and Great Malvern.\r\n\r\nThe unique features here are the great height of the massive circular\r\ncolumns, fourteen in number, and the consequently dwarfed triforium or\r\ngallery running over the main arches. There are traces to be seen of the\r\noriginal Norman clerestory under the Perpendicular windows, and, judging\r\nfrom this, the height of the clerestory, as originally constructed, must\r\nhave been but little less than that of the piers in the nave.\r\n\r\nThis Norman clerestory was altered at the same time that the roof of the\r\nnave was vaulted--viz. in 1242, in the time of Henry Foliot. This work\r\nwas done by the monks themselves, who thought, as Professor Willis\r\nsuggests, that they could do it better than common workmen. Their work\r\nis made of a light and porous kind of stone, treated with plaster on the\r\nunder-side, and it was rendered necessary by the previous roof, which\r\nwas of wood, having been destroyed by fire in 1190. Of this fire the\r\npiers certainly show the traces to this day, all having become reddened\r\nand slightly calcined. To make the new clerestory the whole of the\r\noriginal Norman work over the arcade of the triforium was removed, with\r\nthe exception of the jambs of the side-lights (which extended beyond the\r\narches of the triforium) and the wall between them.\r\n\r\nMr. Gambier Parry has also truly said that this work \"was not an\r\nartistic success. They cut and maimed the features of the fine old\r\nNorman clerestory, and placed their thin weak work too low, destroying\r\nall the original grandeur of effect.... Here in this first pointed\r\nvaulting was a grievous and irreparable injury, destroying all sense of\r\nproportion throughout the building.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NAVE AND NORTH AISLE]\r\n\r\nThe vaulting shafts and the abaci are of Purbeck marble, and the\r\ncapitals are of stone, as are also the corbels, bases, mouldings, and\r\nbosses. All the stonework was formerly painted. Mr Waller, who carried\r\nout the repairs to the nave, had excellent opportunities of seeing what\r\nwas left of the painting underneath the many coats of whitewash; he\r\nwrote in 1856: \"The painting may be thus generally described. The hollow\r\nof the abacus of the capitals was red, the lower member of the same,\r\ngreen; the whole of the bell red, the leaves alternately green and\r\nyellow, with the stalks, running down, of the same colours, into the red\r\nbell of the capital. The vertical mouldings between the marble shafts\r\nwere red and blue alternately; the lower shafts green and blue, with red\r\nin the hollows, and the foliage on these also is green and yellow. Some\r\nof the horizontal mouldings are partly coloured also. The bosses in the\r\ngroining are yellow and green, as in the capitals. All the colouring,\r\nwhich was very rich, was effected with water colours; in one instance\r\nonly has any gold been discerned, and that was upon one of the bosses in\r\nthe roof.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourteen piers are 30 feet 7 inches in height, or about twice the\r\nheight of those at Norwich.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Norman piers have round or cushioned capitals. Their arches have\r\nzig-zag work in the outer moulding, and a double cable in the soffit. A\r\ncable moulding runs along just above the arches. The grotesque heads on\r\nthe arches in the nave are said to represent the various mummeries of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon gleemen. A frieze of such may be seen at Kilpeck Church,\r\nin Herefordshire. It will be noticed how the cable moulding above the\r\narches passes round some of the western vaulting shafts, and is cut away\r\nfor those at the eastmost end of the nave.\r\n\r\nMartin in his \"Natural History of England\" says: \"The only blemish on\r\nthe church is the enormous size of the pillars in the body of it, which\r\nare much too large in proportion to their height, and _would have been\r\nreduced to a proper size_, chiefly at the cost of the late Bishop\r\n(Benson), had it not been thought that it would have weakened them too\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Benson's architect (Mr. Kent), proposed to \"flute\" the columns,\r\nbut, finding that the pillars consisted of a stone casing filled with\r\nrubble, he changed his plans.\r\n\r\nThe #West End# of the nave, as also the corresponding portions of the\r\ntwo aisles, was pulled down and reconstructed by Abbot Morewent\r\n(1421-1437) in the style known as Perpendicular. It is uncertain whether\r\nMorwent's work was built on the same foundation line as the previously\r\nexisting Norman work. Some have thought that he lengthened the original\r\nnave to the extent of one bay. Mr. Hope considers that he curtailed it\r\nsomewhat, and that the present Deanery building was similarly shortened.\r\nAnyone who will take the trouble to space out with a compass the\r\ndistance between the centres of the piers in the nave on the plan will\r\nbe inclined to fall in with this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAbbot Morwent, according to Leland, intended, \"if he had lived, to have\r\nmade the whole body of the church of like worke.\" It is a matter for\r\nrejoicing that he was not spared to carry out his intentions. His work,\r\nthough it has been censured, is, as Mr Waller points out, exceedingly\r\ngood of its kind. Morwent may have found the west end in danger of\r\nfalling, just as the towers that flanked the Norman west front had\r\ncollapsed in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nHow Morwent would have made the whole body of the church \"of like worke\"\r\nis another matter for speculation. Would he have kept the Norman piers\r\nin their present position, and revaulted the roof after the model of his\r\nvaulting in the second bay from the west end, or would he have\r\ndiminished the number of piers so as to give a distance between them\r\nequal to the space between the west wall and the first pier he erected?\r\nIt is difficult to realise how such a herculean task would have been\r\ncarried out with safety to the fabric.\r\n\r\nAs to the work demolished by Morwent to make room for his own, it is\r\nonly possible to hazard the conjecture that the original west front of\r\nGloucester was something like that of the abbey at Tewkesbury, but with\r\nthe additional finish of two larger western towers. As the two churches\r\nwere being built almost at the same time, this conjecture seems\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH AISLE OF NAVE.]\r\n\r\nThe #South Aisle# of the nave was originally of Norman work, similar in\r\nstyle to that of the north aisle; but was remodelled and rebuilt to such\r\nan extent by Abbot Thokey, in or about the year 1318, that the piers and\r\nportions of the south wall are all that remain of the Norman work. He\r\ndesired probably to preserve the Norman vaulting (similar to that yet\r\nexisting in the north aisle of the nave), and as the south wall had\r\ninclined outwards, and the whole fabric of the aisle was from this\r\ncause in danger, he erected large buttresses to prevent further\r\nsettlement; but failing in this design, he was compelled to take down\r\nthe Norman vaulting, and he then substituted vaulting of the same style\r\nof architecture as the buttresses he had just erected. Such great care\r\ncould scarcely have been taken in those days to preserve the Norman\r\npiers only; the first object must have been to retain, for economical\r\nreasons, as much as could possibly be retained of the old aisle. It may\r\nbe remarked also that the Norman piers incline in some cases as much as\r\none foot towards the south, and the buttresses of Abbot Thokey also\r\nincline in the same direction from three to four inches in their whole\r\nheight. The Abbot's buttresses, therefore, must have gone out of the\r\nperpendicular after their first erection, or else the present vaulting\r\nwould show settlements, which it certainly does not.\r\n\r\nThe tracery of the windows is unusual in design, and is similar to that\r\nin a window of the chapel at Merton College, Oxford. Ball-flower\r\nmouldings adorn the aisle windows inside and out between the south door\r\nand the steps leading up to the south transept, and the same ornament is\r\nrepeated in the vaulting of three of the bays and in the triforium of\r\nthe choir.[2]\r\n\r\nAbbot Morwent's work at the west end of this aisle is similar to that in\r\nthe north aisle.\r\n\r\nThe #Monuments# in this aisle are not numerous, but are of modern\r\nhistoric interest. Near the west end of the nave is a statue by Silvier\r\nto Dr Jenner, who introduced the practice of vaccination. Under the west\r\nwindow of this aisle is an interesting wall-tablet in a canopy to John\r\nJones, who was registrar to eight bishops of the diocese. The background\r\nis formed of files of documents, with their seals and dates exposed to\r\nview. There is taste in the colouring, and the design is effective. John\r\nJones was M.P. for Gloucester at the exciting time of the Gunpowder\r\nPlot. He is said to have had the monument put up in his lifetime, and to\r\nhave died soon after it was completed.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the south door, a marble sarcophagus, with a bust upon it,\r\nwill be noticed. This is to the memory of Sir G. Onesiphorus Paul,\r\nBaronet, (by Sievier). His name is well-known in connection with prison\r\nreforms. Close by is a wall tablet to the widow of Sir Wm. Strachan\r\n(1770). The carving, which is very delicate and beautiful, is by Thomas\r\nRicketts, a Gloucester sculptor of considerable skill.\r\n\r\nThere is also a monument to Rev. Thomas Stock, who, with Robert Raikes,\r\nwas instrumental in opening Sunday schools.\r\n\r\n#The great West Window# contains nine lights which were glazed by Wailes\r\nof Newcastle, to the memory of Dr J. H. Monk, Bishop of Gloucester from\r\n1830 to 1856.\r\n\r\nThe #Font# is situated in the westernmost bay of the south aisle, on the\r\nsite of the old Consistory Court, formerly railed off from the rest of\r\nthe nave. The font being of red Aberdeen granite clashes rather with the\r\nprevailing grey stone of the building, is very heavy in appearance, and,\r\nin spite of the workmanship spent upon it, quite uninteresting. The\r\nnorth side contains a representation of the two prophets, Jeremiah and\r\nEzekiel, separated by the ark; the west side has figures of St. Matthew\r\nand Daniel; the south side has figures of St. Mark and St. Luke, and the\r\nbaptism of Christ in the Jordan, and the east contains the emblems of\r\nthe Trinity and of baptism.\r\n\r\nThe #Windows# in this south aisle are the least interesting in the\r\ncathedral, and would seem to have been made without much consideration\r\nof the fact that they were to go where a south light would come upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe five-light _west window_ of the aisle is in memory of Dr Jenner and\r\nhis friend Dr Baron. The subjects, appropriately enough, refer to\r\nmiracles of healing, or restoring to life.\r\n\r\nThe _first south window_ is to John Elliott, a solicitor, and the\r\nsubjects are more or less legal. The glass is by Hardman.\r\n\r\nThe _second window_ (three lights) is in memory of Miss Evans, and was\r\nput up in 1861 by Bell of Bristol. The colouring must be seen to be\r\nappreciated at its proper worth.\r\n\r\nThe _third window_ is a memorial to Sir W. G. Davy, K.C.B., who died in\r\n1856, and is buried in the cloister. The glass is by Warrington.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth window_, to the memory of Sir W. Guise, Bart., is rather\r\nkaleidoscopic in effect, owing to its being mainly an armorial window,\r\nand, secondarily, historical. The historical portion represents the\r\nCoronation of Henry III. in Gloucester Cathedral in 1216, by Gualo (the\r\nPapal legate) and Peter de Rupibus, or des Roches, Bishop of Winchester.\r\nIn the left centre light is Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, and in the\r\nright is Joceline, Bishop of Bath.\r\n\r\nThe glass is by Clayton & Bell.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth window_ is a memorial window to Mrs. Evans. In colour it\r\nresembles the third window, and is by the same artist.\r\n\r\nThe _sixth window_ is a memorial to Mrs Ellis. It is historical, but\r\nbristles with anachronisms.\r\n\r\nThe _seventh window_ is a memorial (executed by Warrington) to Jeremiah\r\nNettleton Balme.\r\n\r\nThe _eighth window_ is in memory of Lieut.-Col. Sir Harry Francis\r\nColville Darell, who died in 1853.\r\n\r\n#North Aisle.#--This aisle retains its original Norman vaulting. The\r\nNorman piers, which correspond to the piers in the nave, are divided\r\ninto several members, and their capitals are in some cases richly\r\ncarved. In each bay the jambs and heads are of old work, filled in with\r\nPerpendicular tracing. A stone bench along the wall is also\r\nPerpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe door into the cloister at the west end of the aisle contains some\r\nvery fine work. The wall is panelled on either side, and the panels are\r\nsaid to have formerly had paintings of the twelve apostles. The side\r\nniches and the canopy work over the door should be examined.\r\n\r\nThe door at the eastern end of the aisle by which access is gained to\r\nthe cloisters and the chapter-house is also of Perpendicular work. Both\r\nof these doors have fan-vaulted recesses, like the great west door of\r\nthe nave. They are so contrived that the doors may open into them and\r\noccupy the minimum of space.\r\n\r\nOver the east door in the cloisters there were blazoned some years back\r\nthe arms of the See, the Bishop, the Dean, the Canons, the Darell and\r\nNightingall families.\r\n\r\nThe west end of the aisle is the work of Abbot Morwent, and is of the\r\nsame date as his reconstructed west end of the nave--viz. 1421-1437.\r\n\r\nThe _west window_ in this aisle was filled with glass by Hardman. It is\r\na memorial to Wm. Viner Ellis of Minsterworth. Subject: Events in the\r\nlife of King Lucius, who is said to have been the first Christian king\r\nin this land, and to have been buried in the Church of St. Mary de Lode.\r\n\r\nThe scrolls contain the monkish lines--\r\n\r\n    Es merito Celebris ex quo baptisma subisti.\r\n    Lucius in tenebris prius idola qui coluisti.\r\n\r\nThe four figures represent Robert, Duke of Normandy; Thomas of\r\nWoodstock, 1397; Humphrey, 1447; William Frederick, 1534; all three of\r\nthem Dukes of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThe _first window_ (or over the west door into cloisters), of which only\r\ntwo lights are open, is a memorial window to Thomas Churchus (1870). The\r\nwindow, which is by Clayton & Bell, is very pleasing in colour.\r\n\r\nThe _second window_ is to the memory of Mr Price, who died in 1860. The\r\nglass is by Ward & Hughes.\r\n\r\nThe _third window_ contains some old glass in the upper half, restored\r\nby Hardman. Much of the lower half is new.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth window_ is a memorial window to Dr Hall, Master of Pembroke\r\nCollege, Oxford; died in 1843. The glass is by Clayton & Bell.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth window_, like the third, contains some old glass, restored by\r\nHardman.\r\n\r\nThe _sixth window_ is in memory of Bp. Hooper, second Bishop of this\r\ndiocese, and the only bishop of the united sees of Gloucester and\r\nWorcester. The glass is by Clayton & Bell.\r\n\r\nThe _seventh window_ is to the memory of Thomas Turner. The glass is by\r\nClayton & Bell.\r\n\r\nThe _eighth window_ is a memorial to members of the Darell family, as\r\nexplained in the inscription in the base.\r\n\r\nIn the windows of the clerestory are to be seen some fragments of old\r\nglass. The windows, which are of three lights, contain portions of\r\nornamental borders with quarry glazing, and some medallions, stars in\r\nthe foliations, and borders of crowns. Mr Waller thinks it was \"probable\r\nthat all these windows were originally filled with glass of this kind,\r\nwhich is similar in general design to that in the upper tiers of the\r\nclerestory windows in the choir.\"\r\n\r\nThe tracery of the windows in the clerestory is ascribed to Abbot\r\nMorwent, who rebuilt the west front.\r\n\r\nThe #Monuments# in the north aisle are of no special interest. That to\r\nBishop Warburton at the west end contains an epitaph that is worth\r\nreading. Next to it is an ungainly tomb, filling up an enormous wall\r\nspace, with a depressing effect. Farther eastwards is the tomb by\r\nFlaxman to the memory of Mrs Morley, who died at sea in 1784 (p. 121).\r\n\r\nThe tomb to Alderman Machen, his wife, and family is interesting (1615),\r\nand is one of the few tombs that has not been removed from its original\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe nave is lighted by rows of gas jets along the triforium or gallery,\r\nextending over the arches of the nave. The effect is good when the\r\nbuilding requires to be lighted by artificial light, but the fumes and\r\nsmoke from the gas have sadly discoloured the small columns and the\r\narches in the triforium, and no doubt in time to come more serious\r\nmischief to the stonework will be developed. The fumes of the gas will\r\nalso be fatal to the decorative pipes of the organ, and, with the\r\nassistance of the fumes from the radiators, will ruin any memorial brass\r\nthat may be erected in the building.\r\n\r\nWires have been stretched across the nave to prevent the excessive echo\r\nfrom marring the effect of the music, but many curious echoes are to be\r\nheard. The mocking sounds that follow upon the sounds of the voice of a\r\npreacher, especially when the attendance is small, are very weird. They\r\nmay be heard best from the last few rows of seats near the west end.\r\n\r\nThere are still to be found enthusiasts who would like to remove the\r\nscreens from our cathedrals on the ground that they interfere with the\r\nutility and the beauty of the nave and the choir. But these well-meaning\r\npeople quite overlook the fact that the beauty of the interior would be\r\nentirely marred by such a change. Firstly, the organ would have to be\r\nchopped into two and stowed away in the triforium, unless these\r\nenthusiasts would prefer to revert to an organ-gallery blocking up one\r\nof the transepts. Secondly, the stalls would have to be mutilated and\r\nrearranged. Certainly, the cathedral would resemble a parish church in\r\nsome respects, but at a tremendous cost. There would be a vista, too,\r\nbut the effect of the lofty choir would be lost entirely without the\r\npresence of the screen and the organ, and the nave would look more\r\ndwarfed in height. There is one more point, too, always forgotten by\r\nthese enthusiasts--viz. this, that the building was not designed by\r\nHenry VIII. at the Dissolution as a parish church. He laid down quite\r\nclear and simple rules for the regulation of the cathedral foundation,\r\nand he intended the choir to serve, as it had served for the monks\r\nbefore, as the private chapel of those on his new foundation.\r\n\r\nThe #Choir Screen# was erected in 1820 by Dr Griffiths, to whose memory\r\na tablet has been inserted in the north-west tower pier. Though this\r\nscreen has its defects, it superseded one by Kent, erected in Bishop\r\nBenson's time (1741), of which Bonner, who seems to have appreciated the\r\nstucco front applied by the same good bishop to the reredos in the Lady\r\nChapel, says in his \"Itinerary\" (1796) that it combined the\r\ncharacteristics of the various orders of architecture without any of\r\ntheir good points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAVE.\r\n\r\n               Drawn by F. S. Waller, F.R.I.B.A., from Brown\r\n               Willis' Survey of Gloucester Cathedral (1727).]\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the original screen arrangement, Mr Hope's\r\ndescription is here quoted:--\r\n\r\n     \"The quire proper is under the Tower, a not unusual Benedictine\r\n     arrangement. The original screens at the west end have\r\n     unfortunately been destroyed, but from plans made by Browne Willis\r\n     (_vide supra_, where Mr Waller's drawing of Browne Willis' plan,\r\n     made in 1727, is given) and Carter, while some remains of them\r\n     existed, the arrangement can be approximately recovered. I have\r\n     advisedly used the plural word 'screens' because they were two in\r\n     number. The first consisted of two stone walls--the one at the west\r\n     end of the quire, against which the stalls were returned; the other\r\n     west of it between the first pair of pillars. There was a central\r\n     door, which was called the quire door. The western wall was broader\r\n     than the other, and had in the thickness of its southern half an\r\n     ascending stair to a loft or gallery above, which extended over the\r\n     whole area between the two walls. This loft was called in Latin the\r\n     _pulpitum_, and it must not, as it often has been, be confounded\r\n     with the pulpit to preach from. It sometimes contained an altar, as\r\n     apparently here at Gloucester, and on it stood a pair of organs.\r\n     From it also on the principal feasts the Epistle was read and the\r\n     Gospel solemnly sung at a great eagle desk. On either side of the\r\n     _pulpitum_ door was probably an altar.\r\n\r\n     \"The double screen I have just described was built by Abbot\r\n     Wigmore, who is recorded to have been buried in 1337, 'before the\r\n     Salutation of the Blessed Mary in the entry of the quire on the\r\n     south side,' which he himself constructed with the _pulpitum_ on\r\n     the same place _ut nunc cernitur_ says the 'Chronicle,' and parts\r\n     of it are worked up in the present screen. The north side of the\r\n     quire entry, or perhaps the north quire door, was ornamented with\r\n     images with tabernacles by Abbot Horton.\"\r\n\r\n\"The second screen, all traces of which have long disappeared, stood\r\nbetween the second pair of piers--_i.e._ a bay west of the _pulpitum_.\r\nIt was a lofty stone wall, against which stood the altar of the holy\r\ncross, or rood-altar, as it was more commonly called, and upon it was a\r\ngallery called the rood-loft, from its containing the great rood and its\r\nattendant images. The rood usually stood on the parapet or front rail of\r\nthe loft, but sometimes on a rood-beam crossing the church at some\r\nheight above the loft. Such an arrangement seems to have existed at\r\nGloucester, for in the sixth course from the top a new stone has been\r\ninserted in both pillars exactly on the line where the ends of the rood\r\nbeam would be fitted into, or rested on corbels, in the pillars.\"\r\n\r\nOn either side of the rood altar the screen was pierced by a doorway for\r\nprocessions, and the altar itself was protected by a fence-screen a\r\nlittle farther west.\r\n\r\nAfter showing how the counterpart of these arrangements existed at\r\nDurham (_vide Arch. Journ._ liv. pp. 77-119), and describing the Durham\r\nnave altar and rood, Mr Hope points out that at Gloucester, as at\r\nDurham, \"the eastern of the two doorways between the nave and the\r\ncloister was shut off by the screen and reredos of a chapel adjoining it\r\non the west. The monks could therefore freely pass through the cloister\r\ndoor without being interrupted by strangers. This eastern door was not\r\nonly the ordinary entrance from the cloister, but through it passed the\r\nSunday and other processions that included the circuit of the cloister\r\nand buildings opening out of it. The procession always returned into the\r\nchurch by the western cloister door, and, after making a station before\r\nthe great rood, passed through the rood doors in single files, and\r\nentered the quire through the pulpitum or quire door.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapel, on the north side (which was perhaps dedicated to St.\r\nThomas the Martyr), was formerly, as shown in the plan by Brown Willis,\r\nthe Blackleech monument, now in the south transept.\r\n\r\nWhen the Benson screen was put up three Abbots were found interred in\r\ntheir robes, and another coffin with two skulls in it. This fact gave a\r\npossible clue to the identity of one of the Abbots. One probably was\r\nAbbot Gamage, and the two skulls probably belonged to his brother, Sir\r\nNicholas Gamage, and his wife, who were buried near the Abbot.\r\n\r\nThe present #Organ# was built originally during 1663-1665 by Thomas\r\nHarris, the father of the celebrated Renatus or Rene Harris, and the\r\ncost was defrayed by public subscription, to which, however, the\r\ninhabitants of Gloucester contributed but little. The contract was for\r\nthe sum of L400, exclusive of the sum for the building of the\r\norgan-loft, and the decoration of the pipes and the case. The gilding\r\nand painting was entrusted to Mr Campion in November 1664, and the work\r\nwas finished in December 1666. This artist was celebrated as a painter\r\nof heraldic subjects, and the work done by him, chiefly on the large\r\npipes of the Great, is particularly beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe shield, which has been removed from the west front of the case, was\r\nundoubtedly that of Charles II., and two of the large pipes facing the\r\nnave bear the letters C.R., with a crown over them. Other arms\r\nrepresented are those of James, Duke of York (king in 1685), and his\r\nfirst wife, Anne Hyde.\r\n\r\nThe organ was repaired by Bernhard Schmidt before 1683. It was formerly\r\nin the gallery of the south transept, over the stalls, but was placed on\r\nits present screen in 1820 by Dr Griffiths.\r\n\r\nIt was improved by Willis in 1847, and again in 1888-89, and further\r\nadditions are contemplated. The case is of oak, and is a fine piece of\r\nRenaissance work. A good view of it can be obtained from the triforium,\r\nlooking across from south-east to north-west.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specification (kindly sent by Mr A. H. Brewer, the\r\norganist of the cathedral), from which it will be seen that the\r\ninstrument is worthy of the cathedral:\r\n\r\n    GREAT ORGAN.\r\n    CC to A, 58 Notes.\r\n\r\n    1.

Its dimensions are--Length, 140 feet; breadth, 33 feet 7 inches;\r\nheight, 86 feet; east window, 38 feet wide and 72 feet in height.\r\n\r\nIt dates back to the years 1337-1377--that is, the abbacies of Adam de\r\nStaunton and Thomas Horton, in whose time so much was done to alter the\r\ncharacter of the building.\r\n\r\nLooking upwards the visitor will note the beauty of the vaulting and the\r\nbosses placed at the intersection of the ribs. These bosses at the east\r\nend of the choir chiefly represent a choir of angels playing on various\r\nkinds of musical instruments, and a figure of Our Lord in the attitude\r\nof blessing. All the roof was originally probably painted and decorated,\r\nbut the existing colour and gilding is recent work, having been done by\r\nClayton & Bell. At first sight the groining of the roof looks most\r\ncomplicated, but, if analysed and dotted down on paper, it will be seen\r\nto be in reality a simple geometrical pattern. The bosses will repay\r\ncareful examination with a glass.\r\n\r\nViewed from the door in the screen, the choir looks in very truth a\r\npiece of Perpendicular work, as the Norman substructure is then for the\r\nmost part concealed. A closer examination, however, will prove that the\r\nNorman work is all there--that it has been veiled over with tracery from\r\nthe floor level to the vaulting with open screen-work, fixed on to the\r\nNorman masonry, which was pared down to receive it. (_Vide_ page 52.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Willis points out that \"in all cathedrals ... a screen, about\r\nthe height of the present altar-screen, separated the choir from the\r\nside-aisles and transepts; but in this cathedral the screen is carried\r\nto the roof, and the result is a beautiful, if not unique choir. This\r\nscreen of tracery, which formed the sides, was, below the clerestory,\r\nmerely plastered on to the Norman wall; or the original Norman columns\r\nhad been chipped down till they harmonised with the general design.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Freeman, in writing of this casing work, said, \"Paid for by\r\nthe offerings at Edward II. shrine, ... to that abnormal worship the\r\nabbey of Gloucester owed its present form. I am half inclined to put it\r\nthe other way, and to make it a new count in the articles of deposition\r\nagainst the unworthy king that this misguided devotion has cost us the\r\nminster of Serlo in its perfect form, and hinders us from studying the\r\ncontrast which we should otherwise have been able to mark between its\r\neastern and its western limb.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOIR, LOOKING EAST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF TRIFORIUM OF THE CHOIR.\r\n               From a Drawing by F. S. Waller, F.R.I.B.A.]\r\n\r\nWe, however, have nothing to do with the question of the merits or\r\ndemerits of Edward II. The beauty of the casing work compels our\r\nadmiration. If we want to get an idea of what the choir would have been\r\nwithout the Perpendicular casing we must go to Norwich, and inspect the\r\nuncased work in the choir that is there, or else to Tewkesbury.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Feretory (High Altar) as laid bare when the new\r\n               Reredos was erected in 1873. The site of the old Norman\r\n               Piers could be as distinctly as in this sketch.\r\n\r\n               From a Drawing by F. S. Waller, F.R.I.B.A.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing left to prove the original height of the choir, though\r\nmuch of the old stonework has been re-used in the clerestory windows, a\r\npractice, as before stated, common throughout the cathedral, the Norman\r\npiers and arch-mouldings having in many cases been turned into\r\nfour-centred arches, and Norman capitals into bases. The casing of the\r\nold Norman work with the new by Staunton and Horton is very ingeniously\r\nmanaged, and attention should be given to a feature resulting from the\r\ntreatment of the ribs of the vaulting, which are very cleverly provided\r\nfor in the centre of the tower arches. The ribs are apparently supported\r\nby a light arch thrown across the lower arches. Something of this sort\r\nwas necessary, as the only alternative would have been to alter the\r\nspringing of the vaulting-ribs. These light arches are very graceful and\r\nare best seen from the transepts or else from the triforium of the\r\nchoir. Another feature worth noticing in the tower arches is the way\r\nthat the two Norman columns are run into one capital at about the level\r\nof the arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch of old Norman Choir showing how it was cased by\r\n               Abbot Staunton 1337-1351.\r\n\r\n               From a Drawing by F. S. Waller, F.R.I.B.A.]\r\n\r\nTurning eastwards we next are struck by the loveliness of the #East\r\nWindow# of the choir. It has a curious architectural effect, for it is\r\nactually 5 feet wider than the walls which seem to be its two\r\nboundaries. The architect took down the Norman east end, raised the\r\nroof, and has given us a window with lace-like tracery. Though it has\r\nsuffered much mutilation, it has suffered but little from eager\r\nrestorers, and it is possible to get some idea of its original\r\nsplendour. It is larger than the East Window at York Minster, being 72\r\nby 38 feet; York being but 78 by 33. Both are beautiful, and one wishes\r\nthat windows of such beauty could be got now at the original price\r\npaid--L138--a large sum for those days, but a sum which; making\r\nallowance for the changed value of money, would represent about L2000 of\r\nour money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHOIR. LOOKING WEST.]\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the stonework of the window was in a very unsafe condition, and\r\nabout L1400 was spent on restoring it. At the same time, acting on Mr\r\nWinston's advice, the Dean and Chapter had the glass thoroughly cleaned\r\nand releaded.\r\n\r\nOwing to Mr Winston's supervision the glass was not restored.\r\n\r\nThe window, which corresponds admirably with the casing of the choir and\r\nthe clerestory windows, consists of fourteen lights altogether, six\r\nforming the centre, with four on either side. \"It is worthy of remark\r\nthat the tracery, heads, and cusps, as seen from the inside of this\r\nwindow, are not repeated on the outside, a plain transom only crossing\r\nthe lights. This peculiarity is repeated also in the great west window,\r\nand in many other windows in the cathedral.\" (F. S. W.)\r\n\r\nThe window represents the coronation of the Virgin Mary, together with\r\nChrist, the Apostles, and various saints and kings. All the canopies,\r\nand nearly all the figures are composed of white glass enriched with\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nMr Winston's description of the window will be found in the\r\n_Archaeological Journal_, vol. xx.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic shields give a clue to the date of the window, and Mr\r\nWinston thinks that it may have been erected by Thomas, Lord Bradeston,\r\nto the memory of Sir Maurice Berkeley, who was killed at the siege of\r\nCalais, and to commemorate the glories of the campaign in France, which\r\nculminated with the Battle of Crecy. The date, therefore, of the\r\noriginal glass would be between 1347 and 1350.\r\n\r\nMr Winston further says that \"It would be impossible to meet with white\r\nglass that could be more solid and silvery in effect. The red is\r\nbeautifully varied, and is most luminous, even in its deepest parts, and\r\nthe tone of the blue can hardly be surpassed.\" Of the general design, he\r\nsays that although, \"through the size and simplicity of its parts, it is\r\ncalculated to produce a good effect at a distance; the figures are\r\nill-drawn, ungraceful, and insipid. The shading, though sufficient, both\r\nin depth and quantity, if handled with skill, to have produced a due\r\neffect of relief--an effect which obviously has been aimed at--is so\r\ninartificially employed as to be useful only so far as it serves to\r\nimpart tone and richness to the composition, and by contrast to increase\r\nits brilliancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the choir as a whole, when glazed with its original\r\npainted glass, must have been superb. We may be certain that the glass\r\nwas the best that could be obtained, for the abbey was wealthy, and\r\nglass-painting was then a living art. Glass was made at Gloucester, as\r\nis shown by the glaziers being numbered among the trade companies and\r\nguilds of Gloucester, but there is nothing definite to be said as to the\r\nplace of origin of the old glass in the cathedral.\r\n\r\nBelow is the #Reredos#, designed by Sir G. G. Scott, presented by the\r\nTreasurer of the Province. It consists of three principal compartments,\r\nin which are groups of figures (sculptured by Redfern) intended to\r\nrepresent the Birth, Burial, and Ascension of Christ. The smaller\r\nfigures in the niches are Moses and David and St. Peter and St. Paul.\r\nAbove are nine angels, bearing the various emblems of our Lord's\r\nPassion. This reredos was unveiled with much pomp and ceremony in 1873,\r\nand recently has been profusely gilded.\r\n\r\nThe commonplace and heavy-topped gas standards mar the effect, such as\r\nit is, of the ornate work of the reredos.\r\n\r\nOf Abbot Horton's reredos, which was destroyed at the Reformation, only\r\nfragments remain. They have been very carefully preserved in the\r\ntriforium, where an enclosure has been made by placing an old oak screen\r\nacross one of the Chapels. In this museum most valuable remains have\r\nbeen stored, under Mr Waller's keeping, for many years.\r\n\r\nDean Chetwood, in 1710, erected a wooden reredos containing much good\r\ncarving. Portions of this remain in the south-east chapel in the\r\ntriforium of the choir, having been brought back from the parish church\r\nat Cheltenham, whither they had been removed in 1807.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Smirke in 1807 put up work which consisted chiefly of\r\npanelling, which was affixed to the easternmost wall of the feretory.\r\nThis was removed in 1873.\r\n\r\nWhen the present reredos was erected \"the foundations of Abbot Horton's\r\nreredos were discovered, and an accurate plan was taken of the remains\r\n(_vide_ illustration, p. 51). Provision had evidently been made by him\r\nfor keeping relics or treasures here, and, in his time, the back\r\nscreen, as we now see it, and the reredos, were united together at the\r\ntop, and covered with heavy stone slabs, so as to make a perfectly\r\nsecure feretory. Great care was taken during the progress of the present\r\nnew work to preserve these remains, which can be still seen exactly as\r\nthey were when first discovered. The foundations of the Norman piers\r\nremoved by Horton were at the same time temporarily exposed to view.\"\r\n(F. S. W.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHOIR IN 1806, FROM A DRAWING BY WILD.]\r\n\r\nThe original \"#High Altar# occupied the same site as the present one,\r\nand had behind its reredos a narrow space containing cupboards for the\r\nprincipal jewels, and, beneath the altar, two large recesses for the\r\nkeeping of relics.\" (W. H. St. J. Hope.)\r\n\r\nThe #Stalls# (sixty in number), with all their graceful carving, and the\r\nmisereres, with their grotesque ornamentation underneath, have in part\r\nhad to be restored, while the sub-stalls are new, dating from Sir\r\nGilbert Scott's restoration, which was finished in 1873.\r\n\r\nAn engraving (reproduced from Wild) will show what the choir was like\r\nformerly. The woodwork here shown has been utilised in making stalls and\r\nseats in the east end of the nave for the services that are held there\r\non Sundays during a portion of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the #Presbytery#, or space between the reredos and the choir, there\r\nare some very splendid old tiles; many of them fragments only, but\r\nenough to indicate the original beauty of the pavement. From the\r\nevidence of the tiles themselves, they were laid down by Thomas\r\nSeabroke, R. Brygg (Brydges), J. Applebi, W. Farlei, Joh. Graft(on?).\r\nOthers dating back to the thirteenth century are also to be\r\nfound--_e.g._ those to Richard the King of the Romans, who died in 1271.\r\n\r\nMany tiles were transferred here from other parts of the cathedral early\r\nin the century by Mr Lysons, and this accounts for the presence of tiles\r\nof William Malvern, the last Abbot, and some others. The arms of the\r\nBrydges family: _Arg. on a cross sable, a leopard's face, or,\r\ndifferenced by a fir-cone gules_, should be noticed, as they seem\r\nclearly the same as those on the armour of the unknown knight in the\r\nSouth Transept.\r\n\r\nBeautiful tiles, bearing the arms of Edward the Confessor and the Abbey,\r\nand many a crowned M. (for Maria) will be found. These latter will be\r\nseen in plenty in Great Malvern Priory, where they have been rescued\r\nfrom the pavement, and inserted in the outside wall of the back of the\r\nreredos.\r\n\r\nOne more tile should be noticed near the sedilia. The words impressed\r\nin its surface are \"_Croys Crist me spe de +_,\" followed by _A ME_ or _A\r\nMARIA_.\r\n\r\nThese tiles had a narrow escape in the last century, about the time when\r\nthe nave was paved, when an offer was made to pave the presbytery with\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nAs part of the restoration programme, the re-paving of the choir was\r\nundertaken. New tiles, ostensibly copied from the old ones, but of a\r\ndifferent size, with an excessive glaze, and very stiff in design and\r\nexecution have been put down. It is hard to judge what the effect of the\r\ntiles would have been, as it has been quite killed by the white marble\r\nwhich has been mixed with them. The glaring white marble in the floor of\r\nthe presbytery has been inlaid with biblical scenes filled in with black\r\ncement. It is possible from the triforium to get a general idea of the\r\ncrudity and tastelessness of the pavement, which is so composed and\r\narranged that time--the softener of all things--can never make it look\r\nappreciably better.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the high altar are four #Sedilia#. These have been\r\nvery much restored, and the niches and canopies filled with figures, by\r\nRedfern, representing Abbot Edric, Bishop Wulstan, also Abbots Aldred,\r\nSerlo, Foliot, Thokey, Wygmore, Horton, Froucester, Morwent, Seabroke,\r\nand Hanley. The general effect is good, but marred by the hideous gas\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nOver the canopies are three angels playing on a tambour and trumpets.\r\nThe rod and entwined ribbon with T. O. are supposed to refer to Thomas\r\nOsborne, Sheriff of Gloucester 1512-1522, and Mayor in 1526.\r\n\r\n#Monuments in the Choir.#--On the north side of the presbytery, near the\r\nsteps to the high altar, is a monument--long supposed to be a\r\ncenotaph--to King Osric. The tomb was opened to satisfy inquisitive\r\ndesecrators some few years ago, and it was conclusively proved that\r\nsomeone had been buried inside.\r\n\r\nOn the wall is the inscription: _Osricus Rex (primus fundator) hui_\r\n(_Monasterii_ 681). From Leland, to whom is due the part of the\r\ninscription in brackets, we learn that \"Osric, Founder of Gloucester\r\nAbbey, first laye in St. Petronell's Chappell, thence removed with our\r\nLady Chappell, and thence removed of late dayes, and layd under a fayre\r\ntombe of stone on the north syde of the high aulter. At the foote of the\r\ntombe is thus written in a wall\"--_ut supra_.\r\n\r\nThis \"fayre tombe\" was erected in \"late dayes\" _i.e._ in the time of\r\nAbbot Parker, whose arms are in the spandrels of the canopy, dated (1514\r\nto 1539), and Leland must have seen the tomb in all the freshness of its\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Norman piers, which are cut away to receive the tomb, are decorated\r\nas to their capitals with the device of Richard II. _i.e._ the white\r\nhart chained and gorged, with a ducal coronet. Formerly these devices\r\nwere painted on the stone, but in 1737 they were blazoned on thin metal\r\nby the Heraldic College, and put in position. From the occurrence of the\r\ndevice in this place it was formerly held that the body of Edward II.\r\nwas drawn by stages from Berkeley Castle to the abbey.\r\n\r\nThe other coats-of-arms are those of the abbey (they are blazoned as\r\nthey should be now--azure, a sword in pale, hilted, pommelled, and\r\ncrowned, or, surmounted by two keys in saltire of the last), and of\r\nOsric as King of Northumbria. Osric is represented as crowned and\r\nsceptred (clad in tunic, laced mantle, and a fur hood or collar) bearing\r\nthe model of a church in his left hand.\r\n\r\nThe next tomb westwards is, as Leland says, that of \"King Edward of\r\nCaernarvon (who) lyeth under a fayre tombe, in an arch at the head of\r\nKing Osric tombe.\"\r\n\r\nThe #Tomb of Edward II.# was erected by Edward III., and though it\r\nawakens our recollection of a feeble-minded king, and his barbarously\r\nbrutal murder, it also compels our admiration at the beauty of the work.\r\nIt has been restored, renovated or re-edified, but in spite of that,\r\nappeals to us from the wealth of very highly ornate tabernacle work, the\r\nrichness, and at the same time the lightness and elegance of the whole.\r\nThe details too are well worth careful examination. It may be, judging\r\nfrom the expression of the face, that there has been some attempt at\r\nportraiture, but repair and restoration have practically made it\r\nimpossible to settle what would otherwise be an interesting question.\r\nThe superb canopy has suffered much at the hands of restorers--_e.g._ in\r\n1737, 1789, 1798, and in 1876.\r\n\r\nThe alabaster figure is possibly the earliest of its kind in England.\r\n\r\nThe tomb was opened in October 1855 by Dr Jeune, Canon in residence, to\r\nsatisfy the curious who doubted whether the king had been buried under\r\nhis tomb. Close by is the chantry tomb of William Malverne (or Parker),\r\nAbbot of the Abbey from 1515 up to the time of the Dissolution. It was\r\nerected in his lifetime, but he is buried elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TOMB OF EDWARD II.]\r\n\r\nOn the stone screen the carving of the vine and the grapes will be found\r\nworthy of notice. The alabaster figure has been terribly defaced, but\r\nthe chasuble and the mitre can be seen, and the broken staff. Around the\r\nbase of the tomb are panels. Both sides are alike, containing the\r\nAbbot's own arms, and the emblems of the Crucifixion. At the foot is a\r\ncross composed of a tree with its branches growing into the shape of a\r\ncross. There is a very good tile on the floor with the arms of the\r\nAbbey, and some specimens of tiles, with a very fine greenish glaze upon\r\nthem. Some of the large 7 1/2 in. tiles with the stag--the Abbot's own\r\narms--are particularly good.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the choir the bracket tomb or monument, so called\r\nfrom the effigy being placed on a corbel or projecting bracket, should\r\nbe noted. It is said by some to be Aldred's, by others to be Serlo's\r\nmonument. The date of the monument is later than either in point of\r\ntime. The mutilated effigy bears a model of a church in his left hand,\r\nand this points to its being the monument to a founder. It is more, than\r\nprobable that it is to the memory of Abbot Henry Foliot, in whose time\r\n(1228-1243) the church was re-dedicated.\r\n\r\nThe monument, which is Perpendicular and Early English, has been much\r\nbattered, but it is exceedingly graceful and of an unusual type.\r\n\r\nLeland, who visited the Abbey in 1539 or 1540, wrote as\r\nfollows:--\"Serlo, Abbot of Gloucester, lyeth under a fayre marble tombe,\r\non the south side of the Presbytery.\"\r\n\r\n#Glass in the Choir.#--Mention has been made above of the east window,\r\nand it remains to notice the others.\r\n\r\nIn the clerestory on the north side the windows have been restored by\r\nClayton & Bell. They are best seen from the triforium, but are given\r\nhere as being part of the choir. Following the example of the lights in\r\nthe east window, these clerestory windows have alternately red and blue\r\nbackgrounds. Portions of old glass remain in the heads of the windows.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the windows west to east the _first_ contains:\r\n\r\n    (1) St. Zacharias. (2) St. Elizabeth. (3) St. John Baptist.\r\n    (4) St. Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ contains:\r\n\r\n    (1) St. Anna. (2) St. Mary. (3) St. Joseph. (4) St. Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ contains:\r\n\r\n    (1) St. Peter. (2) St. John. (3) St. James (Major). (This light\r\n    is out of its place.) (4) St. Andrew.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ contains:\r\n\r\n    (1) St. Philip. (2) St. Bartholomew. (3) St. Simon. (4) St. Jude.\r\n\r\nThe clerestory windows on the south side are filled with stamped\r\nquarries with central medallions and coloured borders, made after the\r\nmodel of remains of ancient painted glass.\r\n\r\nThe choir also contains a peculiarity in its six-light west window. This\r\nwas rendered necessary by the difference in height of the nave as\r\ncompared with that of the choir. The choir vaulting is about twenty feet\r\nhigher than that of the nave. The glass at present in the window\r\nconsists chiefly of patch-work, arranged by Hardman from pieces\r\ncollected and saved at different times from other windows in the\r\ncathedral. It represents a figure of our Lord, with angels on either\r\nside. Below are angels playing on musical instruments.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to credit the Reformation or the Civil War with most\r\nchurch desecration and destruction, but this window was ruthlessly\r\ndestroyed by an order of the Chapter in 1679, nearly thirty years after\r\nthe Civil War was ended, and nearly 140 years after the dissolution of\r\nthe monastery. The order ran as follows: \"That a certain scandalous\r\npicture of y'e Holy Trinity being in y'e west window of y'e Quire of y'e\r\nsaid church, should be removed, and other glass put into y'e place.\" The\r\nglass of the window was actually broken up by one of the prebendaries\r\n(Fowler by name) with his own hands and feet. His action, considering\r\nhis views, was incomprehensible; but he was made Bishop of the diocese,\r\nafter Bishop Frampton was deprived of his see. Beneath the west window\r\nis an inscription (restored) in the panelling of the stone work:\r\n\r\n   Hoc quod | digestum | specularis | opusque | politum | Tullii haec\r\n   Ex onere | Seabroke                        | abbate  | jubente.\r\n\r\nThese two Latin verses record that \"this work (viz. the tower) which you\r\nsee built and adorned, was done by the labour of Tully, at the command\r\nof Abbot Seabroke.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Tully was a monk of Gloucester, and was Bishop of St. David's,\r\nwhere he died in 1482. There is a brassless slab to his memory there,\r\nbut the best monument is the tower that was built by him here in\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the iron gate into the last bay of the south\r\naisle, the tomb of Abbot Seabrook or Seabroke will be seen on the left,\r\ninside a stone screen, through which formerly was a doorway giving\r\naccess to the organ loft. The alabaster effigy represents the Abbot in\r\nhis alb, stole, tunic, dalmatic, chasuble, amice, and mitre, with his\r\npastoral staff on his right side. The chapel has been partially\r\nrestored. Traces of colour are to be seen in the reredos and the roof\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nAbbot Seabroke's pastoral staff was discovered in 1741 in his coffin\r\nwhile the tomb was being removed. After changing hands many times it was\r\nacquired finally by the Antiquarian Society of Newcastle-on-Tyne.\r\n\r\nIn the west end of the Seabroke Chapel, against the first pier of the\r\nnave, is a mural monument, rather florid in style, to Francis Baber,\r\n1669.\r\n\r\nClose to the Seabroke Chapel, on one of the piers supporting the tower,\r\nis a bracket with traces of very beautiful blue colour. The canopy\r\nabove--much mutilated--shows traces of red, blue, and gold.\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite to this, but nearer to the iron gate, is a recessed tomb\r\nto a knight in mixed armour of mail and plate, and by his side his lady,\r\nwith kirtle, mantle, and flowing hair. Both wear SS collars, and this\r\nhelps to give the age of the monument, by narrowing the date down to a\r\nyear not earlier than 1399. The SS collars also tend to disprove that\r\nthe monument is to Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and his\r\ncountess, seeing that he died in 1361. On the knight's belt is a badge,\r\nvery much worn down, which has been attributed to the Brydges family. Mr\r\nLysons thought it to be the tomb of Sir John Brydges who fought at\r\nAgincourt, and died in 1437, but the mail tippet is not found later than\r\n1418. The tomb may commemorate Sir Thomas Brydges, who died in 1407, and\r\nthis would agree better with the date given above.\r\n\r\nThe transepts and ambulatory of the choir are entered, as a rule, by the\r\niron gateway in the south aisle of the nave.\r\n\r\n#South Transept.#--This transept, like that on the north, underwent a\r\ncomplete transformation in the fourteenth century, under Abbot Wygmore\r\n(1329-1337). In spite of the transformation, the Norman design can\r\neasily be traced both in the inside and the outside of the transept. The\r\nwalls have been ornamented with open panelled work, consisting of\r\nmullions and transoms, with very rich tracery and foiled headings. The\r\nmethod of the casing is best seen from the triforium, where the original\r\nNorman masonry can be closely inspected. The panel work, in spite of its\r\ndate, has the appearance of being considerably later, and some have\r\nthought the work to have been executed after Wygmore's time.\r\n\r\nProfessor Willis thinks that the Perpendicular style, which\r\nelsewhere--_e.g._ in the north transept and the choir--is completely\r\ndeveloped, may have had its origin in this south transept. In any case,\r\nthe work is of the greatest architectural interest, and deserves careful\r\nstudy. \"Looking at the very early character of the clustered shafts and\r\nthe mouldings of this transept in conjunction with the vertical lines\r\nwith which they are associated, one might think (excepting Thokey's\r\nsouth aisle, the Edward II. monument, and some few examples in the\r\ntriforium of the choir) that Decorated work had never fairly taken root\r\nin Gloucester.\" (F. S. W.)\r\n\r\nThe south transept, which was also called St. Andrew's Aisle, is 47 feet\r\nlong, 35 feet broad, and 86 feet in height. The vaulting is lierne\r\nvaulting, with short ribs, which connect the main ribs together. There\r\nare no bosses in the roof. With an opera-glass it is possible to note\r\nthe clever joining of the masonry.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the south transept, between the tower piers, is an\r\ninteresting chapel, with a wooden screen--date about 1510. The panelling\r\ninside, as also that on the back of the choir-stalls here exposed to\r\nview, is covered with monograms of S and B alternately, all surmounted\r\nwith crowns.\r\n\r\nThe chapel is said to have been dedicated by John Browne (or Newton),\r\nwho was Abbot from 1510-1514, to his patron saint, St. John the Baptist,\r\nthe initials being the same.\r\n\r\nOn the step in this chapel is a slab with a mutilated cross incised in\r\nit and remains of an inscription upon a scroll. It is now almost\r\nillegible and crumbling fast away, but it was\r\n\r\n    \"Kyrie eleison anime\r\n     Fratris Johis Lyon.\"\r\n\r\nThis Johannis Lyon was the monk who made the reredos in this chapel.\r\nThere are traces of two reredoses here, both of which show traces of\r\ncolour. Older stonework has been used to make the newer reredos, and has\r\nbeen merely reversed.\r\n\r\nThe tiles here are of interest, and there are also some outside, both at\r\nthe east and at the west end of the chapel screen, well worthy of\r\nattention. They are chiefly odd tiles, similar to those in the choir,\r\nwith the name of Farley, others with oak leaves, others with\r\nfleur-de-lys, others with lions rampant.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the chapel outside is a highly lacquered brass of the\r\nusual type, in memory of Judge Sumner, 1885.\r\n\r\nJust before turning into the south transept a stone on the floor will be\r\nseen, close to the angle of the wall made by the transept and the south\r\naisle, with the inscription: \"Here lyeth under this marbell ston Robart\r\nLeigh, organist and Maister of the Choristers of this Cathedral Church.\r\nHe dyed the 6th of January 1589\"(?). No record of him survives.\r\n\r\nOn the south wall are two doorways. One, which is blocked up, is in the\r\nsouth-east corner, and is surmounted by a double-bodied monster,\r\nresembling an ape. The other doorway is usually pointed out to visitors\r\nas the \"Pilgrim's door.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this door was that in general use for pilgrims or not is an open\r\nquestion. It was for a long time blocked up and has only a makeshift\r\ndoor in it at the present time. Carter, writing in 1807, says: \"The arch\r\nof the opening, in its head, has four turns concentred by a flower.\r\nAbove the head is an ogee architrave rising from small columns, which\r\ncolumns bend forward on each hand, forming open arms or fences on each\r\nside of the steps to the doorway. On these arms recline statues (angels)\r\nacting as guardians to the doorway. Their attitudes are well conceived\r\nand pleasingly varied.\" The sculpture is extremely graceful and\r\npleasing, the expression of the faces particularly charming. The\r\ndrapery, too, is arranged in a masterly manner.\r\n\r\nThe door was thought by some to have been used to admit pilgrims to the\r\nshrine of Edward II., but others, arguing from the angels upon it, have\r\ntaken it to be the door by which penitents could retire after making\r\ntheir confession. Perhaps the most reasonable explanation is that it was\r\na door communicating with a vestry or checker for the sacrist, but there\r\nare no traces underground outside the south wall of any stone\r\nfoundation for such building.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the transept will be noted the restored #Chapel of\r\nSt. Andrew#. The paintings on the wall were executed in 1866-67 in\r\nspirit fresco by Mr Gambier Parry for Thomas Marling, Esq., in memory of\r\nhis wife, who died in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe reredos contains a central figure of the Saviour between St. Andrew\r\nand St. Peter, with eight figures of smaller size--viz. Job, Solomon,\r\nMoses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. The remainder of the\r\nfigures are intended to represent a choir of angels.\r\n\r\nThe tiles in the chapel are very bright and gaudy, contrasting\r\nunfavourably with the older tiles elsewhere in the building. The\r\narrangement of the tiles on the risers of the steps is very monotonous\r\nand unpleasing. Plain stone steps would have been far less obtrusive.\r\n\r\nAt one time a charge of sixpence was made for the privilege of\r\ninspecting the interior of this chapel, but nowadays it is kept closed.\r\nFor many years it was used as a vestry for the lay clerks. The windows\r\ncontain glass (by Hardmar) dealing with events in the life of St.\r\nAndrew.\r\n\r\nIn the east window, over St. Andrew's Chapel in the south transept, is\r\nto be seen some of the best glass now to be found in the cathedral,\r\ndating back to about 1330. It consists in the head of a white\r\nscroll-work of vine leaves, etc., on a fine ruby-coloured ground, and\r\nbelow plain quarries with very simple borders. These have been releaded\r\nby Hardman.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the chapel there are tabernacles. That on the south\r\nside contains some very fine carving, and with one boss quite complete.\r\nThe colour, judging from the traces remaining, must have been very\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the chapel is the #'Prentice's Bracket#. In shape\r\nit resembles a mason's square supporting an apprentice. Underneath it,\r\nas a supporter, is the master mason. The work was probably intended to\r\ncarry an image with a pair of lights, and also to serve as a memorial of\r\nthe workmen.\r\n\r\nThe Elizabethan monument erected in memory of Richard Pates, Esq.,\r\nfounder of the Grammar School at Cheltenham, is a poor example of its\r\ndate, 1588. The next monument was originally in the north choir chapel\r\nof the nave (_vide_ Brown Willis' plan, p. 44), and commemorates\r\nAlderman Blackleech, in cavalier costume, and his wife. The date of the\r\ntomb is 1639. Other and later memorials are on the walls, but they are\r\nof no special interest.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting tablet to Canon Evan Evans, D.D. (Master of\r\nPembroke College, Oxford), who died in 1891. The memorial consists of a\r\nbronze tablet, bordered by a frame of marble inlaid with other marbles.\r\nThe bronze at the top is inlaid with shell of an iridescent colour. The\r\ngeneral effect is good, but silver hardly seems suited for inlaying in a\r\nbuilding lighted by gas. The tablet was designed by Mr H. Wilson. The\r\nwest window is Perpendicular, and is filled with glass in memory of Mr\r\nT. G. Parry.\r\n\r\nThe south window in this transept has been filled with glass (by\r\nHardman), at the expense of Thomas Marling, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe slabs on the floor have been moved from the positions they formerly\r\noccupied, and have suffered by the change. A large slate-coloured stone,\r\nwhich used to be in front of the Blackleech monument is now placed much\r\nnearer the entrance to the crypt. It is broken in two and is covered up\r\nby matting.\r\n\r\nAnother stone slab has traces of a mill wheel. The inscription on it\r\nused to tell that \"Here lyeth buried the body of John Long, Millard and\r\nMilwright, who departed this life the 16th day of April 1596.\"\r\n\r\nA blue-coloured slab, which originally had a fine brass inlaid canopy\r\nhas been converted to the use of a Minor Canon named Deane--1755.\r\n\r\nThe large buttress which passes through the St. Andrew Chapel upwards\r\nthrough the triforium, to support the south-east pier of the tower, used\r\nformerly to bear upon it a monument to Bishop Benson, which is now in\r\nthe south triforium.\r\n\r\nThe double doorway which gives access to the choir aisle, and to the\r\ncrypt, seems to be the type of several other doorways of later date in\r\nthe building, as, for instance, in the north transept, and also in\r\ndoorways in the Deanery and cloisters.\r\n\r\nThe #Crypt#[4] is one of five English eastern crypts, founded before\r\n1085, the others being those at Canterbury, Winchester, Rochester, and\r\nWorcester, and extends underneath the whole of the choir, the\r\nambulatories or aisles of the choir, and the five chapels belonging\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nIn passing downstairs to the crypt or under-church, an inscription over\r\nthe door of the chapel on the right refers to the enormous quantity of\r\nbones which had accumulated in the crypt, and thus obtained for it the\r\nname of \"The Bone House.\" These bones had been brought in from the south\r\nprecincts outside, all of which had been formerly a burying-ground, and\r\nin 1851 were removed to the south-west chapel of the crypt, and later\r\nburied in a large grave on the north side of the cathedral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.E. CHAPEL IN THE CRYPT.\r\n               _S. B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]\r\n\r\nThe crypt consists of an apse, three small apsidal chapels--_i.e._ a\r\nN.E., an E., and a S.E. chapel, and also two chapels underneath the\r\neastern chapels of the north and south transepts.\r\n\r\n\"The outer walls of the crypt are about 10 feet thick, and the aisle\r\nfloor is on an average 8 feet below the level of the soil on the outside\r\nof the building. The centre part is divided by two rows of small\r\ncolumns, irregularly placed, from which spring arches carrying the floor\r\nof the choir above; the bases and capitals of these small capitals are\r\nmuch out of level from west to east, and from north to south, and in\r\ndesign they vary greatly as to their capitals, abaci, and bases. All of\r\nthese are strikingly different to the half columns with cushion capitals\r\nattached to the outer walls, on which rest the ribs they mutually carry.\r\nSo different, indeed, are they as to make it questionable if by far the\r\nlarger portion of these columns does not belong to our earlier church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great alterations have from time to time been made in the crypt. The\r\nlarge semi-circular columns against the walls, though of great\r\nantiquity, are not parts of the original structure, but are casings\r\nbuilt round, and enclosing the former smaller piers, and the ribs\r\nspringing from their capitals are built _under_, with a view to support\r\nthe vaulting.\" (F. S. W.)\r\n\r\nThis strengthening work was rendered necessary owing to earthquake\r\nshocks which occurred, and possibly from the fact that the originally\r\ndefective foundations on the south side of the crypt caused a slight\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here that the masons' marks found in the triforium on\r\nthe Norman work are also found in the crypt on the later strengthening\r\nwork, and not upon the Early Norman work. This fact has been considered\r\nto prove that the crypt was built by Aldred.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel--_i.e._ that below St. Andrew's Chapel--contains a\r\ndouble piscina with a shelf in good preservation. There are remains of\r\nhinge-posts (two sets), and the holes for the movable bar with which the\r\ndoors could be fastened.\r\n\r\nThe second chapel--_i.e._ that underneath St. Philip's Chapel--contains\r\nan arcade of five plain arches with ornament above. There is also a\r\ndouble piscina with shelf in good preservation, and a large altar-step,\r\n6 feet 2 inches by 4 feet.\r\n\r\nThe third or eastern chapel, which is under the vestibule leading into\r\nthe Lady Chapel, contains portions of the building which have had to be\r\nreplaced by recent work, and some fragments of tombstones, one bearing\r\nthe inscription _Gilbertus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY-CHAPEL ABOVE HALF-SECTION.\r\n               DRAWING ORIGINAL NORMAL WORK.\r\n               PLAN OF THE CRYPT.\r\n\r\n               From a Drawing by F. S. Waller, F.R.I.B.A.\r\n\r\n               The dark tint on the walls represents the Early Norman\r\n               Crypt.\r\n\r\n               The second period of Norman work is shown by the double\r\n               lines round the small shafts at A A, which denote masonry\r\n               erected some time after, to carry the ribs which\r\n               strengthen the vaulting.\r\n\r\n               The parts sectionised were for the most part built in the\r\n               fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to carry the walls\r\n               above--notably s s, as foundations for the choir piers.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapel, which is underneath Abbot Boteler's Chapel, also\r\ncontains fragments, some of them very beautiful specimens of stonework.\r\nThere is also a slab, upon which is to be read the words, _Orate pro aia\r\nfris Johis_. This slab was formerly in the south transept, and was\r\n(according to Mr Haine's transcription of the slab made thirty years\r\nago) to the memory of John Lempster, who lived in Abbot Froucester's\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA slab inscribed I STAUNT, which used to be in the cloisters at the\r\nentrance to the chapter-house, is also in the crypt. This John de\r\nStaunton was akin to Abbot Staunton, who was buried in 1351.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapel, which is underneath St. Paul's Chapel, was the chapel\r\nthrough which the Abbot had access to the crypt from the Abbot's\r\ncloister. The easternmost portion has some very good vaulting and\r\ndecoration of the thirteenth century, and contains a very mutilated\r\npiscina. The groining of the roof is, unfortunately, falling away by\r\ndegrees. There are traces of some fine bosses.\r\n\r\nThe crypt was cleared, drained, and concreted in the course of the\r\nrestoration that took place during the years 1853-1863.\r\n\r\n#Ambulatories of the Choir.#--These aisles have nothing uncommon in\r\ntheir form or arrangement below, but above occurs the great peculiarity\r\nof this church. The side aisles and eastern chapels are, in fact,\r\nincluding the crypt, three storeys high, and all vaulted, and the upper\r\nrange of chapels surrounding the choir is perhaps not to be met with in\r\nany other church in Europe.\r\n\r\nNear the entrance to the #S. Ambulatory of the Choir# a tomb and brass\r\nto the memory of Rev. John Kempthorn, B.D. (1838) will be found on the\r\nright, near the side entrance into St. Andrew's Chapel.\r\n\r\nClose to it, upon the floor, is a modern brass, by Messrs Heaton, Butter\r\n& Bayne, to the memory of Rev. H. Haines, M.A., who for twenty-three\r\nyears was second master in the cathedral school. He died in 1872. His\r\nbook on the Cathedral, which he knew so thoroughly and loved so well, is\r\none of the best guide-books to the building, but, unfortunately, no new\r\nedition has been issued since 1884.\r\n\r\nSome of the piers in the south ambulatory of the choir will be found to\r\nshow traces of colour decoration in certain lights. As a whole they\r\nretain more Norman work, unaltered, than perhaps any other portion of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nNear to the Kempthorn monument is the memorial window to Canon Harvey\r\nand his wife, who both died in the year 1889. The glass is by Kempe.\r\n\r\nThe second window, also by Kempe, is a memorial to the Rev. H. Law, who\r\nwas Dean from 1862-1884. The figure drawing in this light will attract\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe third window, glass by Kempe, is a memorial to the Rev. Sir J. H.\r\nCulme Seymour, Bart., who was Canon of Gloucester for fifty-one years,\r\nand died in 1880.\r\n\r\n#The Triforium of the Choir# is, perhaps, the finest triforium in\r\nexistence, and is worthy of special examination. \"It occupies the space\r\nover the ground floors of the aisles or ambulatory of the choir, and\r\noriginally extended of a like width round the east end of the Norman\r\nChurch, but at the time when the fourteenth-century work of the present\r\nchoir was executed, the whole of the east end of the old Norman choir,\r\nwith the corresponding part of the triforium, was removed in order to\r\nmake room for the existing large window, the small east chapel being\r\nallowed to remain.\" (F. S. W.) The original shape of this part of the\r\nbuilding will be more clearly seen by reference to the chapel (D),\r\nindicated by dotted lines on the plan, and to the extreme east chapel of\r\nthe crypt. As the means of entrance to this east chapel of the triforium\r\nwas now gone, the narrow gallery usually called the \"Whispering Gallery\"\r\nwas made, and carried by segmental arches, marked BB, from the\r\nsouth-east to the east chapel, and from the east chapel to that on the\r\nnorth-east. The external appearance of the Whispering Gallery is shown\r\non page 75. The casual observer frequently takes it to be a piece of\r\nNorman work, but it is in reality the material of Norman builders very\r\nskilfully re-used.\r\n\r\nThe triforium is reached by the staircases in the western turrets of the\r\ntwo transepts and by arcaded passages passing under the great windows of\r\nthe transepts. Excellent views across the transepts are thence to be\r\nobtained. Still better views can be got from the corner of the triforium\r\n(near the painting of the Last Judgment), both across the organ to the\r\nnorth side of the nave, down the south aisle, and also across the\r\nchoir.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel in the triforium contains two brackets with rich\r\ncanopies, and there is a very well preserved double piscina.\r\nBall-flowers in two rows will be found in the mouldings of the east\r\nwindow. Remains of two canopies in the jambs of the windows are also to\r\nbe traced.\r\n\r\nThe massive Norman piers should be carefully studied, as the way in\r\nwhich the later casing work has been applied can be more easily seen in\r\nthe triforium than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe picture on the west side of this part of the triforium was\r\ndiscovered in 1718, against the then eastern end of the nave, underneath\r\nthe panelled wainscot at the back of the seats occupied by the clergy\r\nwhen the nave was used for service.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years it has lost much of its colour; it is painted\r\n_in tempera_ on a kind of gesso ground laid on a wooden planking nearly\r\nan inch thick. From the size of it--viz. 9 feet 10 1/2 inches by 7 feet\r\n7 1/4 inches--it was formerly thought to have formed part of the reredos.\r\n\r\nPortions of the original frame remain, and they show traces of gilding\r\nupon them. The picture has been varnished to preserve it, and, although\r\nhung in a wretched situation for light, it is worth more than passing\r\nattention. Christ is represented in the centre, throned on a rainbow,\r\nattended by angels, and having a globe and a cross below Him. His mantle\r\nis red, with a jewelled border. On either side of His head are emblems\r\n--on the left a lily, emblematic of mercy; and on the right a sword,\r\nemblematic of justice. The lily inclines towards the righteous, and the\r\nsword points towards the wicked. Below on the left are six apostles, but\r\nabove these is an angel holding a T cross and the crown of thorns. To\r\nbalance this, on the right is an angel with a whipping-post, a scourge,\r\nand a spear. Over these figures are scrolls, one on the left inscribed\r\n\"Come, O you blessed ...\", and on the right, \"Go, O you cursed ...\" In\r\nthe centre, under the globe, is an angel holding an open book, \"The boke\r\nof cosciens \"--_i.e._ the book of conscience. On either side are angels\r\nblowing upon trumpets, from which extend scrolls inscribed, \"Aryse, you\r\ndede. Come to your judgement\"; and below this the Resurrection is\r\ndepicted. An angel (in the centre) is scaring away a horned demon from\r\nthe soul borne up by the angel. On the right the wicked are being\r\ncarried off by fiends; on the left the righteous are being led away by\r\nangels bearing crosses.\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand bottom corner are angels and inscriptions. \"Before man\r\nlyfe and death. In all thy workes remebre thy last, and never wilt thou\r\noffend.\" In the top corner on the left is represented the New Jerusalem.\r\nThe architecture is classic in character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH-EAST VIEW OF CATHEDRAL SHOWING WHISPERING GALLERY.\r\n               _S. B. Bolas & Co., Photo]_\r\n\r\nSt. Peter and an angel are standing close to a gate into which the\r\nrighteous are entering. A choir of angels with musical instruments are\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom corner on the right the mouth of hell is represented, into\r\nwhich the lost are being thrust by attendant demons. There is a grim\r\nfigure inside a globe, possibly intended for the Prince of this world,\r\nseizing a soul by the hair. At the bottom are other fiends helping to\r\ntorture the unhappy lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIFORIUM OF THE CHOIR, LOOKING EAST.\r\n               _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo.]_ ]\r\n\r\nSir G. Scharf, in _Archaeologia_, vol. xxxvi., says that the picture is\r\nEnglish, and is of great importance. He thinks it was painted during the\r\nlatter years of the reign of Henry VIII. or during that of Edward VI.,\r\nand points out that it is an epitome of the famous altar-piece at\r\nDantzig, painted in 1467. It is remarkable that in this picture the\r\nVirgin and St. John the Baptist, who are usually associated in pictures\r\nwith the Saviour, are altogether omitted.\r\n\r\nThe second, or south-eastern chapel, contains many interesting remains\r\nof coloured tiles, old carving, some being linenfold panels. There are\r\nalso some finely-carved pilasters, which once formed part of the Queen\r\nAnne reredos, put up by Dean Chetwood about 1710. This reredos was taken\r\ndown in 1807, and was for many years in the old church at Cheltenham.\r\nWhen, however, the church at Cheltenham fell into the hands of the\r\nrestorer, parts of the carved work were brought back to Gloucester.\r\n\r\nPassing towards the Whispering Gallery, the flying buttresses inserted\r\nto support the walls of the clerestory, which were weakened by the\r\ninsertion of the great east window of the choir, 1347-1350, should be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe #Whispering Gallery#, to which the ordinary visitor pays more\r\nattention than anything else in the building, has remarkable acoustic\r\nproperties. A whisper (the lower in tone the better) can be easily and\r\ndistinctly heard at the other end of the gallery, and to this\r\npeculiarity the following lines, by Maurice Wheeler (head-master of the\r\nKing's School, 1684-1712) have reference:\r\n\r\n    \"Doubt not but God, who sits on high,\r\n      Thy secret prayers can hear,\r\n    When a dead wall thus cunningly\r\n      Conveys soft whispers to the ear.\"\r\n\r\nLord Bacon seems to have thought over the subject of the gallery, and\r\nhis remarks are here quoted: \"I suppose there is some vault, or hollow,\r\nor isle behind the wall, and some passage to it, towards the farther end\r\nof that wall against which you speak, so as the voice of him that\r\nspeaketh slideth along the wall, and then entereth at some passage, and\r\ncommunicateth with the air of the hollow, for it is preserved somewhat\r\nby the plain wall: but that is too weak to give a sound audible till it\r\nhas communicated with the back air.\"\r\n\r\nThe gallery is a passage of Norman work, very much altered and re-used.\r\nIt is 74 feet long, 3 feet wide, 6-1/8 feet high, and is carried on\r\nsegmental arches from the east end of the south triforium to the west\r\nwall of the Lady Chapel, and from thence in the same way to the north\r\ntriforium. On page 75 will be seen the appearance of the little bridge\r\nthus made.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the gallery access is obtained to a chapel on the\r\nright, which is immediately over the entrance vestibule to the Lady\r\nChapel. From this chapel a very good general view of the Lady Chapel can\r\nbe obtained. The bosses in the roof show to greater advantage, and it is\r\npossible to see more of the colour that remains on the walls.\r\n\r\nThis chapel is smaller than the others in the triforium, and was reduced\r\nin size when the west end of the Lady Chapel was built. The altar slab\r\nis original Norman work, and has three or four [Symbol: Cross] inscribed\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH AMBULATORY OF THE CHOIR.\r\n               _S. B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]\r\n\r\nThe pieces of old glass formerly in this chapel have disappeared, and\r\nmodern ornamental quarries and medallions, by Hardman, have taken their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapel has nothing of note in it beyond the window tracery.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapel, or the one nearest to the north transept, contains a\r\ndouble piscina, in very good preservation.\r\n\r\nThe triforium contains a few monuments, chiefly those that have been\r\nremoved from the nave. Bishop Benson's monument was formerly on the face\r\nof the buttress that passes through St. Andrew's Chapel.\r\n\r\nThe triforium seems a better resting-place than the crypt for monuments\r\nwhich are rejected from the nave and elsewhere. It is to be hoped that\r\nin the years to come no restorer will lay hold upon the monuments in the\r\nLady Chapel and transepts, and consign them to oblivion in the\r\nneighbouring garden of the deanery. This was done in Dean Law's time,\r\nand may in part be the reason why the cathedral is so poor in specimens\r\nof monuments of the Queen Anne period.\r\n\r\nThe #South-East Chapel#, which is dedicated to St. Philip, contains some\r\ninteresting features. The arches are of a distinctly \"pointed\"\r\ncharacter, and there are remains of the two bases of pillars which\r\nsupported the stone altar slab.\r\n\r\nThis chapel was restored in memory of Sir C. W. Codrington, Bart., M.P.,\r\nwho died in 1864. Various incidents in the life of St. Philip have been\r\npainted on the vaulting by Burlison & Grylls, but the paintings have\r\nsuffered somewhat from damp. The window, which is by Clayton & Bell, is\r\nof no special interest, and represents saints, principally British, and\r\nstriking incidents in the life of each in the panel under each of the\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nNear the piscina, at the base of a pier, will be found some dog-tooth\r\nmoulding. This is repeated on the other side of the chapel, but not on\r\nthe corresponding pier.\r\n\r\nBefore entering the Lady Chapel, a Perpendicular arch will be noticed,\r\nwith two eye-shaped openings in the spandrels. The openings are well\r\ncarved on their bevelled edges. The arch is of later date than the front\r\nof the chapel, and seems to have been necessary to support the triforium\r\nabove. Nothing like it exists on the other side. There is an old\r\ncope-chest in this Ambulatory.\r\n\r\nThe #Lady Chapel.#--This beautiful chapel, which was built between the\r\nyears 1457-1499 by the Abbots Richard Hanley and William Farley, stands\r\non the site of a smaller building, dating back to 1224, and erected by\r\nRalph de Wylington and Olympias, his wife, the architect of the work\r\nbeing Elias or Helias the Sacrist, a monk of the Gloucester monastery.\r\nAs Mr Bazeley points out (\"Records,\" vol. iii. pt. 1, p. 14), \"The only\r\narchitectural evidences of its former existence are two Early English\r\nwindows in the crypt, in the central eastern chapel.\"\r\n\r\nMr Waller thinks that this Early English Lady Chapel was \"probably not a\r\nnew building, but simply an alteration of the old east apsidal chapels\r\non each floor to suit the 'Early English' times, just as the\r\nfourteenth-century men afterwards recased the cathedral. The inserted\r\nwindows of this date in the crypt seem to confirm this view.\"\r\n\r\nOn the site of this chapel must have stood the chapel and altar (or at\r\nany rate the altar) dedicated to St. Petronilla, as Ralph and Olympias\r\ngave rentals to provide lights to burn thereat during mass for ever.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule or entrance to the Lady Chapel is a beautiful piece of\r\nwork, and is another instance of the genius of the builders shown in\r\nmaking use of existing work. Special interest attaches to this chapel as\r\na whole, as it was the last addition to the fabric by the monks before\r\nthe Dissolution.\r\n\r\nFirstly the walls of the vestibule should be noticed: the lower portions\r\nof the west wall are parts of the old Norman apsidal chapel, and are\r\npierced by the opening for the door and by two perpendicular windows;\r\nand the west end of the chapel is contracted in breadth, as it is also\r\nin height, so as to minimise the loss of light to the great window of\r\nthe choir. The shape of the chapel will be easily understood from the\r\nplan (p. 61).\r\n\r\nThe lierne vaulting of the vestibule is very delicate (the ribs, it will\r\nbe noted, are run differently in the four quarters of the roof), and the\r\npendants form a cross. These latter, at the present time, look new, but\r\nthey have only been freed from the whitewash that was thick upon them.\r\nOne pendant has been renewed at the end. Over the vestibule is the small\r\nchapel which is entered from the Whispering Gallery (_vide_ page 77).\r\n\r\nThe open tracery of the west end over the supporting arch is\r\nparticularly graceful, especially the way in which the open lights are\r\narranged in the central portion. The Lady Chapel is 91 feet 6 inches\r\nlong, 25 feet 6 inches high, and 46 feet 6 inches high, and consists of\r\nfour compartments or bays, which, as the wall of the chapel is so low,\r\nare chiefly composed of fine tracery and glass. All the wall below the\r\nwindows is arcaded with foiled arches, with quatrefoils above them. The\r\nwall between the windows is panelled with delicate tracery like that in\r\nthe windows, and in its three chief tiers contains brackets for figures,\r\nwith richly-carved canopies overhead. Many of these canopies (like the\r\nwalls) show traces of colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LADY CHAPEL.\r\n               _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]\r\n\r\nVaulting shafts of great beauty support one of the grandest\r\nPerpendicular roofs that has ever been made. Each boss in the roof is\r\nworth minute inspection, and since the restoration (1896) it is possible\r\nto see the bosses in practically the same condition as they were when\r\nthey left the masons' hands in the fifteenth century. With three\r\nexceptions they are all representations of foliage, and it would be a\r\nhard task to arrange them in order of merit.\r\n\r\nIt has been said above that the chapel is cruciform. The arms of the\r\ncross are represented by the two side chapels, like diminutive transepts\r\non the north and south sides, with oratories above them, to which access\r\nis given by small staircases in the angles of the wall. Both these side\r\nchapels contain some exquisite fan-tracery vaulting, which is supported\r\nupon flying arches, fashioned in imitation of the graceful flying arches\r\nin the choir.\r\n\r\nOn the north side the chapel contains a full-length effigy of Bishop\r\nGoldsborough (who died in 1604) robed in his white rochet, black\r\nchimero, with lawn sleeves, scarf, ruff, and skull-cap.\r\n\r\nThe east window in this chapel is in memory of Lieut. Arthur John\r\nLawford (1885), and is dedicated to St. Martin.\r\n\r\nThe chapel above has a vaulted roof with bosses of foliage, and there\r\nare small portions of ancient glass.\r\n\r\nBishop Nicholson's tomb, which was formerly in the south chapel, where\r\nit blocked up the east window, is at present in pieces in this upper\r\nchapel. It is to be re-erected in another place.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting scribblings on the walls of this chapel. On\r\nthe shelf for books is a representation of a Cromwellian soldier with a\r\ndog, apparently in pursuit of a deer. There are also scribblings with\r\ndevices, dating to 1630-1634. One love-sick swain described an\r\nequilateral triangle with a [Symbol: Cross] rising from the vertex, and\r\nthen inscribed the initials of his _fiancee_ and also his own.\r\n\r\nThe #South Chapel# contains an altar tomb to Thomas Fitzwilliams, who\r\ndied 1579, and there is a wooden tablet, painted with an inscription to\r\ntell that it was repaired in 1648.\r\n\r\nA window has been put up in memory of S. Sebastian Wesley, a former\r\norganist of the cathedral, who died in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn the south chapel there are scribbles, dating back to 1588 and 1604.\r\nBoth of these chapels have shelves for books, but it is probable that\r\none was for a small choir and the other for an organ.\r\n\r\nThe #Lady Chapel# is one of the largest in the kingdom, and is said, at\r\nthe time of the Dissolution, to have been one of the richest. A great\r\npart of it is said to have been gilded and gloriously ornamented.\r\nTraces of the colour can be seen in the mouldings of the panellings and\r\nin the carving upon the walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEST END OF LADY CHAPEL.\r\n               _S. B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]\r\n\r\nThe #Reredos#, judging from the traces that are left, must have been a\r\ngorgeous sight, and literally a blaze of colour. Applique work has been\r\nlavishly employed in its decoration. Anyone who is privileged to\r\nexamine it very closely will note the writing on the stonework, which\r\nhas been laid bare in the niches by the ruthless removal of the figures.\r\nAt present what the present Dean, in his article on the Great Abbeys of\r\nthe Severn Lands, calls its \"pathetic scarred beauty,\" is temporarily\r\nveiled by a very modern screen. The reredos, though a ruin, has a charm\r\nall its own, and it is better to leave it frankly as it is now than to\r\npartly hide it. There are some, no doubt, who would restore it, but it\r\nis to be hoped that funds will not be forthcoming. Restoration has\r\neffectually marred the beauty of the pavement of the choir, and given us\r\na flashy reredos there, of which the less said the better; but every one\r\nwith a particle of feeling must feel that restoration and decoration of\r\nthe Lady Chapel reredos would be a crime.\r\n\r\nBishop Benson covered the reredos with stucco, and put up a huge gold\r\nsun in front of it. Portions of this are now at Minsterworth. An\r\nengraving of it may be seen in Bonnor's \"Perspective Itinerary,\"\r\npublished in 1796, and this plate also shows the long rows of pews\r\nremoved from the choir by the same bishop.\r\n\r\nThe sedilia are very fine, and worthy of careful inspection.\r\n\r\nThe #East Window# consists of nine lights, and has been terribly\r\nmutilated, partly by fanatics, partly owing to lack of care within the\r\nlast century. In design the window resembles the windows on the north\r\nand south sides of the chapel. It was erected in Abbot Farley's time\r\n(1472-1479), and possibly by a Thomas Compton, seeing that in the\r\nquatrefoiled circles in the heads of the lower lights there are\r\nrebuses--a comb with TO, and CO with a TON (for Compton), as well as two\r\nintertwining initials. Much of the glass seems to have been put in after\r\nremoval from other windows in the cathedral, and this makes the\r\ndeciphering of this window no easy undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe tiles in the Lady Chapel are of great interest, and one cannot help\r\nregretting their gradual deterioration under the feet, occasionally the\r\nhobnailed feet of visitors, and the slower but surer destruction by the\r\naccumulations of grit under the matting on the floor. They may be best\r\nexamined by turning up the matting near the Clent tablet on the south\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nOn a pattern made up of sixteen tiles, four times repeated can be read,\r\n\"_Ave Maria gra' ple' Dus tecum_\" i.e. \"_gratia plena Dominus tecum_.\"\r\nOn others similarly designed, \"_Domine Jhu (Jesu) miserere_.\" On others,\r\n\"_Ave Maria gra' ple'_\" and \"_Dne Jhu miserere_.\" These tiles in square\r\nsets of sixteen and four respectively were placed alternately, and\r\nseparated by plain dark bricks. On others again will be found \"_Orate\r\npro Aia Johis Hertlond (pro anima Johannis)_.\" Some too seem to have\r\nbeen transferred from Llanthony Priory to the south chapel. They are\r\ninscribed, \"_Timetib' deu nihil deest_,\" i.e. \"_Timentibus deum nihil\r\ndeest_.\" There are others in the chapel, \"_Letabor in mia--et sethera_,\"\r\nand \"_Deo Gracias_.\"\r\n\r\nThe monument to Sir John Powell (1713) on the north wall is not\r\nbeautiful, though a good specimen of its time. It is impossible not to\r\nregret that it was ever allowed to be erected in the chapel. Powell was\r\na judge of King's Bench, and is here represented in his gown, hood,\r\nmantle, and coif.\r\n\r\nOther monuments are those to Eliz: Williams, 1622 (the figure is raised\r\non one elbow); to Margaret Clent, 1623, with a touching epitaph. On the\r\nfloor, near the Williams monument is a small brass, concealed by\r\nmatting, to Charles Sutton, an infant seven days old. The brass contains\r\ntwo Latin lines modelled on the lines of Ovid's \"Tristia,\" and run:\r\n\r\n    \"Parve, nec invideo, sine me, puer, ibis ad astra,\r\n     Parve, nec invideas, laetus ad astra sequar.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the slabs on the floor will repay perusal, most of them being\r\nwell cut and fairly well preserved. In Brown Willis' \"Survey of\r\nGloucester\" will be found a full record of all the tombstones which in\r\nhis time (1727) were in this chapel, but have since been removed or\r\nre-used.\r\n\r\nTurning to the right on leaving the Lady Chapel, the north-east chapel,\r\nwhich is called #Abbot Boteler's Chapel#, is the next in order. It dates\r\nfrom 1437-1450. The reredos should be closely examined, as it retains\r\nmany of its original features--viz. statuettes, traces of painting on\r\nthe shields above, and a very good piscina.\r\n\r\nThe tiles in the floor are in many cases excellent specimens, especially\r\nthose with fish upon them. It seems a pity that these tiles should be\r\ndoomed to disappear under the nails of sight-seers, who as a rule look\r\nat nothing but the effigy of Robert, Duke of Normandy, and go away\r\nsatisfied when they have proved for themselves that the effigy is of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe effigy has had a curious history. As Leland says, \"Rob'tus\r\nCurthoise, sonne to William the Conquerour, lyeth in the middle of the\r\nPresbitery. There is on his tombe an image of wood paynted, made long\r\nsince his death.\" As to the date there is great uncertainty, and it\r\nwould seem that the figure and the chest upon which it lies are not of\r\nthe same date. Sir W. V. Guise in \"Records of Gloucester Cathedral,\"\r\nvol. i., part 1, p. 101 (now out of print), says, \"I am disposed to\r\nassign to the effigy a date not very remote from the period at which the\r\nduke lived. The hauberk of chain-mail and the long surcote ceased to be\r\nworn after the thirteenth century,\" and on p. 100, \"The mortuary chest\r\non which the figure rests is probably not older than the fifteenth\r\ncentury ...\" Around the chest are a series of shields bearing\r\ncoats-of-arms, ten in number, nine of which were originally intended to\r\ncommemorate the nine worthies of the world. On the dexter side: 1.\r\nHector. 2. Julius Caesar. 3. David. 4. King Arthur. On the sinister side:\r\n5. Edward the Confessor. 6. Alexander the Great. 7. Judas Maccabaeus. 8.\r\nCharlemagne. 9. (at the south end) Godfrey of Bouillon. 10. (at the\r\nnorth end) The arms of France and England, quarterly. The blazoning of\r\n10 proves the chest to be later than the time of Henry IV.\r\n\r\nThe oak figure was broken into several pieces in the civil wars of\r\nCharles I., but was bought by Sir Humphrey Tracey of Stanway, who had it\r\nrepaired, and presented it to the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nLeland says that the duke \"lyeth in the middle of the Presbitery.\" The\r\ninscription in the chapter-house says \"Hic jacet Robertus Curtus.\" The\r\nplain pavement in the choir is said to mark the site of the grave in the\r\nchoir, but it is open to question whether there would be space for\r\ninterment between the tiling and the upper side of the vaulting of the\r\ncrypt. It is to be hoped that at some future time the effigy may be\r\nmoved back to its place in the Presbytery.\r\n\r\nThe next chapel--_i.e._ the north-west chapel, is dedicated to St. Paul,\r\nand is entered by a doorway, with the initials T. C. over it, in the\r\nspandrels. T. C. may stand for Thomas Compton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF ROBERT CURTHOSE.\r\n               _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]\r\n\r\nThe windows in the north ambulatory of the choir are as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe window next to Boteler's Chapel is a memorial erected by the dean\r\nand chapter to Mrs Tinling. The glass was designed by the late J. D.\r\nSedding, Esq., and was executed by Kempe.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the tomb of Edward II. is a memorial window, also by Kempe,\r\nto the late Lieut.-General Sir Joseph Thackwell and his wife.\r\n\r\nThe third window is a memorial to Alfred George Price, who died in 1880,\r\nand it represents the four great builders of the church--viz. 1. King\r\nOsric. 2. Abbot Serlo. 3. Abbot Wygmore. 4. Abbot Seabroke.\r\n\r\nOpposite this door in the north-east corner is a doorway--Perpendicular\r\nin style--with interesting cresting and carving, giving access to the\r\nvestries and the choir practising-room.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in the other chapels, the groined edge of the Norman\r\nvaulting is carried down the piers.\r\n\r\nThe reredos in this chapel was more perfect, in point of good repair,\r\nthan any other in the building, and the chapel was repaired by the late\r\nEarl of Ellenborough in 1870, figures by Redfern representing St. Peter,\r\nSt. Paul, and St. Luke being inserted in the niches.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the reredos are windows (by Burlison & Grylls)\r\nrepresenting in the side-lights angels with instruments of music, and in\r\nthe centre Our Lord in majesty with angels bearing crowns and branches\r\nof palm.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the chapel is a brass tablet in memory of Dean Law,\r\nwho was Dean from 1862-1884. The combination of copper, brass, and\r\ngun-metal is to be regretted, as the workmanship is above the average,\r\nand the design is good. It is a mistake to paint heraldic devices on\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\nClose by the door leading into the north transept will be seen the stone\r\nreading-desk, from which it is said addresses were given to the many\r\npilgrims who came to the shrine of the unfortunate Edward II.\r\n\r\nThe #North Transept.#--This transept, like that on the south, consists\r\nof Norman work, which was cased over by Abbot Horton during the last\r\nyears of his abbacy (1368-1373) with fine Perpendicular panelling,\r\ncleverly engrafted into the original wall. It will be noticed that the\r\nwork is, though Early Perpendicular, much more fully developed than that\r\nin the south transept. Angular mouldings of great beauty are used in the\r\nplace of round mouldings; the mullions run right up to the roof, which\r\nagain is much richer than that in the south transept. The vaulting of\r\nthe north transept somewhat resembles in character the fan-tracery of\r\nthe cloisters, the junction of the main and transverse vaults being\r\nrounded rather than angular, and the smaller ribs springing from between\r\nthe larger ones a little _above_ the union with the capitals of the\r\nsupporting shafts. This transept is 8 feet lower than that on the south\r\nside. It is 2 feet shorter, and 1 foot less in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH AMBULATORY OF THE CHOIR, LOOKING EAST.\r\n              _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]\r\n\r\nOn the north side, \"under the north window, is a beautiful piece of\r\nEarly English work (c. 1240), which is supposed to have been a\r\n#Reliquary#.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH AMBULATORY OF THE CHOIR, LOOKING WEST.\r\n               _S. B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]\r\n\r\nIt is constructed in three divisions, that in the middle being a\r\ndoorway. Foiled openings enrich all the arches, and the carving of the\r\nfoliage is very beautiful. Purbeck marble shafts are placed at the\r\nangles, and corbel heads at the spring of the arches, except at the\r\nnorth-east corner, where a stone shield, with arms of Abbot Parker, are\r\nsubstituted. Much of the figure-work on the outside has been mutilated.\r\nIn the inside the roof is simply groined, with bosses, one of which in\r\nthe central division is most beautifully wrought; and there are, too,\r\nsmall heads which, fortunately, seem to have escaped notice altogether,\r\nand are almost perfect. In Bonnor's \"Perspective Itinerary,\" 1796, it is\r\ndescribed as punishment cells. Mr Bazeley thinks it was part of the\r\nEarly English Lady Chapel, built in 1227, which, being thought worthy\r\nof preservation, was taken down and re-erected here when the present\r\nLady Chapel was built.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the reliquary is a #Chapel# between the tower piers, said to\r\nbe dedicated to #St. Anthony#.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOOR FROM NORTH TRANSEPT INTO NORTH AMBULATORY OF THE\r\n               CHOIR.\r\n\r\n               From a Photograph of Miss Dawson of Cardiff]\r\n\r\nThe wood panelling on the back of the stalls of the choir shows traces\r\nof painting, representing the soul of a woman at the mouth of a hell or\r\npurgatory, praying to St. Anthony, who is depicted with his pig and a\r\nbell. Other figures are there, but they are beyond recognition. This\r\nchapel is used as the Dean's vestry, and contains some old panelling,\r\nre-used, and two old strong-boxes.\r\n\r\nBeneath the niche, near the door leading into the North Ambulatory of\r\nthe Choir, is an inscription, which is now barely legible (even with an\r\nopera-glass)--_Orate pro aia (Magistri Johannis) Schelton_; at least so\r\nBrown Willis read it in 1727. On the floor of this transept are some\r\nslabs, now brassless, under which have been buried men of note in the\r\nearly days of the history of the building. One mutilated slab, 7 feet\r\n1 inch by 3 feet 4 inches, has an inscription, of which some only is now\r\nlegible in the border. From Brown Willis' \"Survey of the Cathedral,\"\r\n1727, it can be seen that it is to Robert Stanford.\r\n\r\nThe inscription was--\r\n\r\n    _Hic jacet Robertus Stanford quondam serviens hujus monasterii et\r\n    specialis ac munificus benefactor ejusdem qui obiit vicesimo secundo\r\n    ..._\r\n\r\nA brass to Wm. Lisle, 1723, has been inserted.\r\n\r\nAbbots Horton, Boyfield, Froucester were all buried in this transept,\r\nbut beyond crediting the stone that shows a trace of a mitre to\r\nFroucester, it is a mere matter of speculation to distinguish between\r\nthe others. The stone next but one to it contains the matrix of a fine\r\ncross. The north window was filled in 1874 with glass by Hardman in\r\nmemory of Sir Michael Edward Hicks-Beach, Bart., M.P., and his wife. The\r\nsubjects are episodes in the life of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nUnder the west window of this transept is a curious painted monument to\r\nJohn Bower and his wife (1615). They had \"nyne sones and seaven\r\ndaughters,\" who are represented in perspective on the wooden panel\r\nagainst the wall. The tomb is barely characteristic of its date. On the\r\ntop is an inscription--_Memento mori_; also, _Vayne, vanytie, witnesse\r\nSoloman, all is but vayne._\r\n\r\nThe colour on the tomb has suffered from whitewashing at various times,\r\nand the tomb has been scorched by the heat generated by the warming\r\napparatus in the corner, to the detriment of the painted panel.\r\n\r\nThe west window of this transept was put up in 1894, in memory of Wm.\r\nPhilip Price, M.P. This window is too full of detail, and the canopy\r\nwork is overdone. The glass is by Kempe.\r\n\r\nThe east window contains some old glass, releaded by Clayton & Bell.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [1] They have practically been shortened 10 inches by their plinths\r\n    being concealed by the pavement put down in 1740. Their\r\n    circumference is 21 feet 7 inches, and the distance from pier to\r\n    pier about 12 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\n    [2] Similar ornament in windows may be found at Leominster, Ledbury\r\n    Church, Minsterworth, Hartbury, St. Michael's (Gloucester), and in\r\n    the tower of Hereford Cathedral.\r\n\r\n    [3] The abbey at Tewkesbury is a building which every visitor to\r\n    Gloucester ought to make a point of seeing and studying. It was\r\n    built on a similar plan, at the same time, and probably by some of\r\n    the same builders who built Gloucester.\r\n\r\n    [4] The Crypt is described here because it is, as a rule, entered\r\n    from the eastern door in the south transept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PRECINCTS AND MONASTIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the area once contained by the boundary walls of the Abbey (for\r\nwhich see the plan on p. 103) there are remains of four of the original\r\n#Gateways#. The finest of these is that which leads into St. Mary's\r\nSquare, and the best view of it is obtained from the steps of the\r\nmemorial to Bishop Hooper. It is a very typical specimen of Early\r\nEnglish work. \"It has a gate porch entered by a wide but low pointed\r\narch, with an inner arch where the doors were hung. The gatehall thus\r\nformed also had doors towards the court, and in its south wall are two\r\nrecesses. The upper storey has, towards the street, an arcade of four\r\narches, and the outer pair have each a trefoiled niche or panel in the\r\nback. The other two arches are of larger size and are both pierced with\r\ntwo interesting square-headed lights, also of the thirteenth century,\r\nwith dividing mullions. In the gable, within a large triangular panel,\r\nis a niche of three arches, originally carried by detached shafts, but\r\nthese are now broken away.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nTradition has it that Bonner watched the burning of Bishop Hooper from\r\nthe window over this gateway.\r\n\r\nThe \"inner gate gave access to the inner court, known of late years as\r\nMiller's Green, where the bakehouse, boulting-house, brew-house, stable,\r\nmill, and such-like offices were placed. It was also the way to the\r\nlater Abbot's lodging. The existing gateway is of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and has a single passage, in the west side of which is a\r\nblocked doorway. The passage is covered by a lierne vault.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gateway on the south side, towards the city, has been almost\r\nentirely destroyed, and only a fragment of the west side remains. It was\r\nknown as 'King Edward's' gate, from its having been built by Edward I.\r\nIt was afterwards restored and beautified by Abbot Malverne, _alias_\r\nParker, 1514-1539. The remaining turret of the gate, on the west side\r\ntowards the church, is probably part of Parker's work.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nOn the south side of what is left of this gateway are the arms of King\r\nOsric, as King of Northumbria. The stone bearing these arms was dug up\r\nsome seventy years ago and was placed in its present position.\r\n\r\nIn College Court, a narrow turning leading from the north side of\r\nWestgate Street into the close, is a small gateway, consisting of a\r\nflattened archway with canopied niches at the sides. This is also\r\nsupposed to have been built by Abbot Parker. The upper portion, which\r\nwas destroyed, has been converted into very commonplace offices.\r\n\r\nIn the north-west corner of the precincts was the #Vineyard#. The\r\nvineyards of Gloucestershire used formerly to be famous. William of\r\nMalmesbury, in the twelfth century, writes: \"This county\r\n(Gloucestershire) is planted thicker with vineyards than any other in\r\nEngland, more plentiful in crops, and more pleasant in flavour. For the\r\nwines do not offend the mouth with sharpness, since they do not yield to\r\nthe French (wines) in sweetness.\" The Gloucestershire vineyards survived\r\nas late as 1701. The curious terraces or step-markings on the Cotswolds\r\nin various places, locally called \"litchets\" or \"lyches,\" are by some\r\nsupposed to have been portions of the sites of these vineyards.\r\n\r\n\"The #Dorter# (says Mr Hope) and its _basement_ are now destroyed, and\r\ntheir plan and extent are at present uncertain: but owing to its south\r\nwall having been partly that of the chapter-house also, one small\r\nfragment has been preserved which ... helps to fix the position of the\r\ndorter. This fragment, which may be seen on the north-east corner of the\r\nchapter-house, is the jamb of one of the windows built between 1303 and\r\n1313, and its date is clearly shown by the little ball-flowers round the\r\ncapital of the shaft.\" The dorter then may be assumed to have occupied\r\nthe space between the chapter-house and the end of the east alley of the\r\ncloister.\r\n\r\nThe #Refectory# (or Prater), \"which was begun in 1246, on the site of\r\nthe Norman one destroyed to make room for it, was a great hall over 130\r\nfeet long and nearly 40 feet wide. It was reached by a broad flight of\r\nsteps, beginning in the cloister and passing up through the frater door.\r\nThe steps did not open directly into the frater, but ended in a\r\nvestibule screened off from the rest of the hall, and covered by a loft\r\nor gallery. Into this vestibule would also open the service doors from\r\nthe kitchen and buttery.... The west end and nearly all the north side\r\nhave been pulled down to the ground, but the south wall, being common to\r\nthe cloister, remains up to the height of its window sills. The east end\r\nis also standing to the same height.... Much of the stonework of the\r\neast and south walls is reddened by the fire that destroyed the frater\r\nin 1540.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustation: ST. MARY'S GATE.\r\n              KING EDWARD'S GATE.\r\n\r\n              Drawn by F. S. Walker, F.R.I.B.A.]\r\n\r\nThe #Little Cloisters# consist of an irregular quadrangle, with sides of\r\nvarying length. The garth wall is a good specimen of Perpendicular work.\r\nThere are five openings on each side. In the times of the Great\r\nRebellion the little cloisters were partly unroofed. The western alley\r\nis part of an interesting fifteenth-century house which is built over\r\nit, and the south alley has a lean-to roof.\r\n\r\nThe other two alleys, which are now unroofed, were formerly covered by\r\npart of a large building which was built over them, and called Babylon.\r\nAll traces of Babylon have now disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the north wall of the cloister three stone coffins have been built in\r\nwith the masonry. Mr Hope thinks it quite possible that this small garth\r\nwas used as the herbarium or herb garden.\r\n\r\n    \"On the west side of the little cloister, and partly over-riding\r\n     it, is a medieval house of several dates, from the thirteenth\r\n     century to the suppression, and later. Owing, however, to modern\r\n     partitions and fittings, and repeated alterations, it is somewhat\r\n     difficult to trace its architectural history. The oldest part of it\r\n     consists of a vaulted undercroft of Early English work extending\r\n     north and south beneath the western part of the house. It consists\r\n     of three bays, of which two now form the kitchen of the house, and\r\n     the third or northernmost is walled off to form a passage outside.\r\n     More work of the same period adjoins this on the west, including a\r\n     good doorway with moulded head. This doorway was clearly, as now,\r\n     an external one. The undercroft stops short about twelve feet from\r\n     the frater wall (or wide enough to leave a cart-way), and there is\r\n     nothing to shew that it extended further east. Looking at its\r\n     position so near the great cellar, the kitchen, and other offices,\r\n     it is very probable that the original upper floor was the\r\n     cellarer's checker, or counting-house, and the undercroft a place\r\n     for stores.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLLEGE GATEWAY.\r\n               GATEWAY INTO PALACE YARD.\r\n\r\n               Drawn by F. S. Walker, F.R.I.B.A.]\r\n\r\nClose by, to the north-east, are to be seen six graceful arches of Early\r\nEnglish work. These are a portion of the remains of the \"infirmary\" or\r\n\"farmery,\" which was \"deemed superfluous\" at the suppression, and for\r\nthe most part pulled down.\r\n\r\n     \"The chapel was destroyed and the great hall unroofed and partly\r\n     demolished, but its west end and six arches of the arcade escaped,\r\n     the latter probably because, as at Canterbury, the south aisle had\r\n     been previously cut up into sets of chambers. All these remains are\r\n     of admirable early thirteenth-century work, and it is much to be\r\n     regretted that in clearing away the old houses in 1860 it should\r\n     have been found necessary to also remove a curious vaulted lobby\r\n     and other remains on the east side of the little cloister. The main\r\n     entrance was originally in the west end of the hall, where part of\r\n     the doorway still remains, and was probably covered by a pentise or\r\n     porch with a door (still remaining) from the infirmary cloister, so\r\n     that there was a continuous covered way from the farmery to the\r\n     church.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF THE INFIRMARY.]\r\n\r\n\"The #Library# is an interesting room of the fourteenth century,\r\nretaining much of its original open roof. The north side has eleven\r\nwindows, each of two square-headed lights and perfectly plain, which\r\nlighted the bays or studies. The large end windows are Late\r\nPerpendicular, each of seven lights with a transom. There are other\r\nalterations, such as the beautiful wooden corbels from which the roof\r\nsprings, which are probably contemporary with the work of the cloister,\r\nwhen the western stair to the library was built and the room altered.\r\nNone of the old fittings now remain, but there can be no doubt that this\r\nwas the library.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDIAEVAL HOUSE. From a Drawing by E. J. Burrow.]\r\n\r\nThe library of the monastery, judging by the list given by Leland, must\r\nhave been of considerable value and of no little interest. A list of the\r\nbooks it contained is given in \"Records of Gloucester Cathedral,\" vol.\r\ni. pp. 145-6.\r\n\r\nThe books were at the time of the dissolution of the monastery\r\nconfiscated to the Crown, and the cathedral was apparently without a\r\nlibrary till the time of Bishop Godfrey Godman, who was consecrated in\r\n1624. Writing to his clergy in 1629, he says: \"I am to lett yow\r\nunderstand that I have lately erected a Librarie in Glouc'r. for the use\r\nof all our brethren throughout my Dioces, as likewise for the use of\r\nGent. and Strangers, such as are students. I conceave it will not onely\r\nbe most usefull, but likewise a great ornament to Citie and Dioces.\" He\r\ngoes on to ask the clergy to give either \"a booke or y'e price of a\r\nbooke,\" and tells them not to \"inquire what bookes we have or what are\r\nwanting, ffor if we have double we can exchange them.\" Thoroughly\r\nbusiness-like and considerate, the bishop also says: \"If any man's weake\r\nestate and povertie be such that he can neither give booke, nor price of\r\nbooke, yet in manners and courtisie (seeing his diocesan require it), I\r\ndoe expect that he should excuse himselfe, and I will take the least\r\nexcuse, without any further inquirie, as lovingly as if he had given the\r\ngreatest gift.\" He was tender-hearted to his curates, for he says,\r\n\"Neither doe I write this to Curates or Lecturers, unlesse themselves\r\nplease to bestow; only I do expect from them that they acquaint the\r\nparsons and vicars, and returne their answers unto mee.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the beginning of the Cathedral library. Later, in 1648,\r\nafter troublous times in Gloucester, when even the cathedral itself was\r\nin danger, Thomas Pury, jun., Esq., with the help of Mr Sheppard,\r\nCaptain Hemming, and others, made this library at considerable expense,\r\nand, as Sir Robert Atkyns quaintly observed, \"encouraged literature to\r\nassist reason, in the midst of times deluded with imaginary\r\ninspiration.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1658, after the \"late Cathedrall Church of Gloucester had been\r\nsettled upon the Maior and Burgesses for publique and religious uses,\r\nthe Common Council vested and settled the library on the Maior and\r\nBurgesses, and their successors _for ever_.\" The Restoration, however,\r\nin 1660, made still another change, and the library then became the\r\nproperty of the Dean and Chapter.\r\n\r\nSir Matthew Hale was a liberal benefactor to the library.\r\n\r\nOwing to the damp in the Chapter-House, which for many years had to\r\nserve as the library, the books, in 1743, were removed into the south\r\nambulatory of the choir. This was done by order of the Dean and\r\nChapter, but the Chapter-House was apparently in use as a library in\r\n1796, when Bonnor was making the drawings for his \"Perspective\r\nItinerary.\" In 1827 new and lower cases for the books were fitted, and\r\nthe Chapter-House was used up to 1857 as the Cathedral library. Since\r\nthat time the old monastic library has been restored to its original\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe #Chapter-House# is entered from the east alley of the cloister\r\nthrough a Norman archway of very good work, enriched with zig-zag\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nOriginally consisting of three bays of Norman work, it probably, like\r\nthe chapter-houses at Norwich, Reading, and Durham, terminated in a\r\nsemi-circular apse. The present east end is of Late Perpendicular work,\r\nand makes a fourth bay. Judging from the method in which the new work\r\nwas joined on to the old in the fifteenth century, it would seem as if\r\nthe builders intended to remodel the whole building. The vaulting of the\r\nlater part is well groined, and the window is good. The roof of the\r\nthree Norman bays is a lofty barrel vault supported by three\r\nslightly-pointed arches springing from the capitals of the columns,\r\nwhich are curiously set back, and separate the bays.\r\n\r\nNorman arcading of twelve arches--_i.e._ four to each bay, runs along\r\nthe three westernmost bays on the north and south walls, and in the\r\narcading are inscriptions restored from the description given by Leland.\r\nBelow the arcading \"may be traced the line of the stone bench on which\r\nthe monks sat in chapter.\" (Hope.) The floor has been considerably\r\nlowered in modern times. The tiling is modern, having been copied by\r\nMinton from the old work, both as to subject and arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"The west end is arranged in the usual Benedictine fashion, with a\r\ncentral door, flanked originally by two large unglazed window openings,\r\nwith three large windows above.... Only one of the windows flanking the\r\ndoorway can now be seen, the other having been partly destroyed and\r\ncovered by Perpendicular panelling when the new library stair was built\r\nin the south-west corner of the room.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\n\"At the south-west corner of the chapter-house is a large winding stone\r\nstaircase, with a stone handrail worked in the newel, and also in the\r\nside wall.\" (F. S. W.)\r\n\r\nThe lower part of this west wall shows distinct traces of fire, which\r\nthe upper part does not. This seems to confirm the idea that when the\r\nfire of 1102 broke out and destroyed so much, it burned down the\r\ncloister and the temporary roof of the chapter-house, both of which were\r\nprobably of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAPTER-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n               Plan of the Chapter-House, as shown--A.D. 1727--in Willis'\r\n               \"Survey of Cathedrals.\" A good general idea of the\r\n               fittings formerly in the Chapter-House may be seen in\r\n               Bonnor's work, published in 1709, but on his plan they\r\n               occupy the two bays eastward, instead of west, as here\r\n               delineated. They appear to have been excellent Renaissance\r\n               work.]\r\n\r\nWalter de Lacy was (Hart. i. 73) buried in the chapter-house with great\r\npomp in 1085, and the room must have been ready or nearly ready for use\r\nin that year. As Fosbroke naively says of the distinguished dead who are\r\nburied here, \"They could not have been buried in this room before it\r\nexisted.\"\r\n\r\nIn Leland's time the names were painted on the walls near their\r\ngravestones in Black Letter. As he says, \"These inscriptions be written\r\non the walles of the chapter-house in the cloyster of Gloucester: _Hic\r\njacet Rogerus, Comes de Hereford; Ricds Strongbowe, filius Gilberti,\r\nComitis de Pembroke; Gualterus de Lacy; Philipus de Foye Miles;\r\nBernardus de Novo Mercatu; Paganus de Cadurcis; Adam de Cadurcis;\r\nRobertus Curtus.\"_\r\n\r\nOf the names given by Leland it may be noted that Roger, Earl of\r\nHereford, Bernard de Newmarch (\"Novo Mercatu\"), and Walter de Lacy, were\r\nall contemporaries of the Conqueror, and \"much about his person.\" They,\r\ntherefore, when money was being collected for the abbey buildings,\r\nsubscribed, adding some reservation as to the places in which they\r\nwished to be interred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General sketch plan, shewing boundary walk of Abbey\r\n               Grounds as newly as they can be ascertained, and remains\r\n               of old Monastic buildings.\r\n\r\n               1 | Gateway to St. Mary's Square\r\n               2 |    \"       King Edward's\r\n               3 |    \"    in College Court\r\n               4 |    \"    to Miller's Green\r\n\r\n               A   Remains of Infirmary\r\n               B   Little Cloisters\r\n               C   Site of Refectory\r\n               D   '\r\n               E   Site of Abbot's Lodge\r\n               F   Boundary Walls\r\n               G   Cemetery\r\n\r\n               THE DEANERY IS FULL OF INTERESTING REMAINS OF THE 11TH,\r\n               12TH, 13TH, 14TH, AND 15TH CENTURIES, AND AT THE HOUSES\r\n               MARKED H MUCH OLD WORK MAY BE SEEN.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wires stretched across the building, there is a\r\nremarkable echo.\r\n\r\nThe #Cloisters# are entered from the church by a door near the organ\r\nscreen in the north aisle of the nave. They were begun by Abbot Horton\r\n(1351-1377), who built as far as the door of the chapter-house, and\r\nfinished by Abbot Froucester, 1381-1412. It will be noticed how the\r\nmouldings, the tracery of the windows, and the character of the work\r\ngenerally differ. It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that \"the\r\ncloisters are some of the finest and most perfect in the kingdom. They\r\nform a quadrangle, and are divided into ten compartments in each walk.\r\nThe vaulting is of the kind known as fan-tracery, and is considered to\r\nhave originated in Gloucester. It is found also at Peterborough, at Ely,\r\nand in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, the latter being one of\r\nthe last examples of the method.\r\n\r\n\"The outer walls are substantially of Norman date, but now overlaid and\r\nrefaced by Perpendicular panelling.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nThough the cloisters are quadrangular, the length (147 feet) of each of\r\nthe four walks is not quite the same, but the width is 12 1/2 feet and the\r\nheight 18 1/2 feet.\r\n\r\n#East Alley.#--On the right-hand side in this walk will be noticed a new\r\ndoor. This was inserted in 1874 in the wall in the same position as the\r\nformer door into the monks' _locutorium_ or parlour. The original wide\r\nopening of the doorway may be seen under the moulding of the panelling\r\non the wall.\r\n\r\nThe passage to which the glazed door gives access \"is chiefly of early\r\nNorman date, and was originally of the same length as the width of the\r\ntransept against which it is built. It was entered from the cloister by\r\na wide arch, and has a wall arcade on each side of fifteen arches on the\r\nnorth, but only eleven on the south, the space between the transept\r\npilaster-buttresses admitting no more than that number. The roof is a\r\nperfectly plain barrel vault without ribs. In the south-west corner is a\r\nhollowed bracket, or cresset stone as it was called, in which a wick\r\nfloating in tallow was kept to light the passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"It having become necessary in the fourteenth century to enlarge the\r\nvestry and library over the passage, its east end was taken down and the\r\npassage extended to double its former length. At the same time a vice,\r\nor circular stair, was built at the N.E. angle to give access to the\r\nlibrary. To prevent, however, the new stair from encroaching too much on\r\nthe apse of the chapter-house, the addition to the passage was deflected\r\na little to the south instead of being carried on in a straight line.\r\nThe vault of the added part is a simple barrel like the Early Norman\r\nwork. The use of this passage was twofold. First, it was the place where\r\ntalking was allowed at such times as it was forbidden in the cloister.\r\nHence its name of _locutorium_, or, in English, the parlour. Secondly,\r\nit was the way for the monks to go to their cemetery. When the present\r\ncloister was built the original use of the parlour seems to have passed\r\naway, and in the new works the arch of entrance was blocked up and\r\ncovered by the new panelling. Since this also cut off all access from\r\nthe cloister to the library stair, a new stair was built at the west end\r\ndirectly accessible from the cloister. For want of room this had to be\r\nintruded into the south-west corner of the chapter-house.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nAbove the passage are two floors, one being the vestry, entered from the\r\nnorth-east chapel of the choir, and the upper one, the library, now\r\nrestored to its original monastic use after many vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nThis east alley \"was used as a passage between the church and the\r\nfarmery, and the later Abbot's lodging; out of it also opened the\r\nparlour, chapter-house, and dorter door.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\n\"In the third bay from the church the southern half is pierced with a\r\ndoor below the transom. On the cloister side of the southern half of the\r\nsecond bay, and of the northern half of the fourth bay, there was, in\r\neach case, built out a little cupboard or closet, now destroyed. These\r\nmay have been used for keeping books in. This alley has no bench against\r\nthe walls.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nOpposite the fifth bay in this alley is the doorway, containing some\r\ngood Norman work, slightly restored, leading into the chapter-house.\r\n\r\n\"The construction of the outer walls of the east walk is peculiar as to\r\nthe arrangement of the buttresses and the projecting shelf of stone\r\nconnected with the transoms of the windows, which was evidently meant as\r\na protection from the weather for the lower half of the windows, at that\r\ntime not glazed.\" (F. S. W.)\r\n\r\nThe first window in this east alley or walk, beginning at the south\r\ncorner, nearest to the door into the north aisle, is one of four lights,\r\nby Hardman, to the memory of Rev. H. Burrup, a missionary, who died in\r\nAfrica in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe second window (also by Hardman) is a memorial to Rev. John Plumptre,\r\nwho was Dean from 1808-1825.\r\n\r\nThe third window (also by Hardman) is a memorial to Archdeacon Timbrill.\r\n\r\nThe fourth window (by Hardman) is a memorial to the Hon. and Very Rev.\r\nEdward Rice, who was Dean from 1824 to 1862.\r\n\r\nThe fifth window (also by Hardman) is a memorial to the Rev. T. Evans,\r\nD.D., a former Headmaster of the Cathedral Grammar School; died 1854.\r\n\r\nThe sixth window (by Hardman) is in memory of Miss Mary Davies.\r\n\r\nThe seventh window is a memorial (by Hardman) to Rev. B. S. Claxson,\r\nD.D.\r\n\r\nThe eighth window is a memorial to Rev. John Luxmoore, D.D., who, after\r\nbeing Dean of Gloucester from 1800-1808, was Bishop of Bristol, later of\r\nHereford, and finally of St. Asaph, where he died in 1830.\r\n\r\nThe ninth window is a memorial to the Ven. Henry Wetherell, B.D., a late\r\nPrebendary of Gloucester, who died in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe tenth and last window in this alley is by Clayton & Bell, and is in\r\nmemory of Rev. E. Bankes, D.C.L., late Canon of the Cathedral, who died\r\nin 1867.\r\n\r\n     \"At the north end of the east alley of the cloister, and almost\r\n     concealed by the later panelling, is an Early English doorway\r\n     opening into a vaulted passage or entry, chiefly of the thirteenth\r\n     century. This entry passes between the east gable of the frater and\r\n     what I have suggested may have been the common house-garden, and\r\n     leads straight into the infirmary cloister. The passage is covered\r\n     by a stone vault of four bays, supported by heavy moulded ribs\r\n     springing from corbels. The south half of the passage is 6 feet 10\r\n     inches wide, but the northern half of the east wall is set back so\r\n     as to increase the width to 7 1/2 feet. This passage was lighted in\r\n     the first bay by a single light with trefoiled head, with very wide\r\n     internal splay. In the wider end were two other openings now\r\n     blocked. That to the north had a transom two-thirds of the height\r\n     up, above which the rear-arch is moulded, while below it is plain.\r\n     The other is not carried above the transom level, and the sill has\r\n     been cut down and the opening made into a doorway into a house\r\n     outside; in which state it remained until within the last forty\r\n     years. That some thirteenth-century building stood here seems\r\n     evident, and the upper half of the north opening was clearly a\r\n     window above the roof to light that end of the entry.\r\n\r\n     \"The north end of the entry opens directly into the east alley of\r\n     the infirmary or \"farmery\" cloister, which is built against the\r\n     north side of the east end of the frater.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOISTER GARTH FROM THE NORTH-WEST CORNER, SHOWING THE\r\n               OLD DRAIN.]\r\n\r\n#North Alley# (east to west).--This \"north alley\" was closed at both\r\nends by screens, and must therefore have had some special use. From\r\nanalogy with the arrangements at Durham there can be little doubt that\r\nthis alley was partly appropriated to the novices.... We have curious\r\nevidence that the north alley at Gloucester was so appropriated, in the\r\ntraces of the games they played at in their idle moods. On the stone\r\nbench against the wall are scratched a number of diagrams of the forms\r\nhere represented:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3 Game Diagrams]\r\n\r\nThe first is for playing the game called \"Nine men's morris,\" from each\r\nplayer having nine pieces or men. The other two are for playing\r\nvarieties of the game of \"Fox and Geese.\"\r\n\r\n\"Traces of such games may generally be found on the bench tables of\r\ncloisters where they have not been _restored_, and excellent examples\r\nremain at Canterbury, Westminster, Salisbury, and elsewhere. At\r\nGloucester they are almost exclusively confined to the novices' alley,\r\nthe only others now to be seen in the cloister being an unfinished 'Nine\r\nmen's morris' board in the south alley, and one or two crossed squares\r\nin the west alley.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nIn the north alley wall some of the lower halves of the five easternmost\r\nwindows have been re-opened, and the bricks with which they were blocked\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe next bay contains traces of a doorway into the cloister-garth that\r\nhas been blocked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONKS' LAVATORY.]\r\n\r\nThe #Monks' Lavatory# takes up the next four bays. As Mr Hope says, \"it\r\nis one of the most perfect of its date that have been preserved. It\r\nprojects 8 feet into the garth, and is entered from the cloister alley\r\nby eight tall arches with glazed traceried openings above. Internally it\r\nis 47 feet long and 6 1/2 feet wide, and is lighted by eight two-light\r\nwindows towards the garth and by a similar window at each end. One\r\nlight of the east window has a small square opening below, perhaps for\r\nthe admission of the supply pipes, for which there seems to be no other\r\nentrance either in the fan vault or the side walls. Half the width of\r\nthe lavatory is taken up by a broad, flat ledge or platform against the\r\nwall, on which stood a lead cistern or laver, with a row of taps, and in\r\nfront a hollow trough, originally lined with lead, at which the monks\r\nwashed their hands and faces. From this the waste water ran away into a\r\nrecently discovered (1889) tank in the garth.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nA plan of this tank is here shown by permission of Mr Waller. It seems\r\nto have had a sluice at the west end in order to dam up the water if\r\nrequired in greater volume for flushing the drain.\r\n\r\nOpposite the lavatory is a groined almery or recess in which the monks\r\nkept their towels. The hooks and indications of doors to this recess are\r\nstill there. There are traces, too, of screens or partitions in the\r\nlavatory arches.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the lavatory is a \"curious arrangement. It consists of a\r\nlarge opening in the lower part of the window, occupying the space of\r\ntwo lights, with a separate chase in the head carried up vertically on\r\nthe outside. It had a transom at half its height, now broken away, as is\r\nalso the sill.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nIt is possible, as suggested by Mr J. W. Clark, F.S.A., that this chase\r\nwas lined with wood, and was the means by which a bell rope passed out\r\nto ring the bell which summoned the monks to meals.\r\n\r\nThe #North Alley.#--The windows in this alley as far as the Monks'\r\nLavatory have been filled recently, 1896-97, at the expense of Baron de\r\nFerrieres of Cheltenham.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-seven lights in all, and they constitute the lower part\r\nof five windows, a doorway taking the space of three lights. The\r\n_eighth_ contains a mitre and a crozier, an initial E and the date 1022.\r\nThis window is an anachronism, as Edric was not a mitred abbot. Abbot\r\nFroucester was the first to wear a mitre, in 1381.\r\n\r\nOver the lavatory are four windows, also given by Baron de Ferrieres.\r\nLike the windows in the lavatory, they contain subjects which are in\r\nsome way connected with water.\r\n\r\nThe small two-light windows (ten in number) in the Monks' Lavatory have\r\nbeen glazed by Hardman, at the expense of Mr B. Bonnor.\r\n\r\nA brass on the wall near the lavatory records that the masonry of the\r\nnorth walk was restored by the Freemasons of the province of Gloucester\r\nin 1896.\r\n\r\nThe #West Alley.#--The north window of three lights has been filled with\r\nglass (by Ballantyne) to the memory of members of a Gloucester family\r\nnamed Wilton.\r\n\r\nThe window was formerly an Early English doorway, which can still be\r\ntraced. \"It retains the upper pair of the iron hooks on which the doors\r\nwere hung, and was the entrance into the great dining-hall of the monks,\r\ncalled the refectorium, or, in English, the frater.\" (Hope.) The effect\r\nof the window is beyond words.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD WATER TANK IN THE CLOISTER GARTH.]\r\n\r\nThe #Slype#, or covered passage, which is entered from the south-west\r\ncorner of the cloisters, is a vaulted passage of Norman work, and is\r\nunder part of the old Abbot's lodging--_i.e._ the present Deanery.\r\n\r\nThis passage, which is on a lower level than the cloister, was \"the main\r\nentrance into the cloister from the outer court. This entrance was\r\nalways kept carefully guarded to prevent intrusion by strangers or\r\nunauthorized persons.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nThe passage served as the outer parlour, in which the monks held\r\nconversation with strangers and visitors.\r\n\r\nThe #South Alley.#--This alley has ten windows each of six lights, but\r\nbelow the transoms the lights are replaced by twenty carrels or\r\nrecesses, two to each window. This was the place to which the monks\r\nresorted daily for study (after they had dined) until evensong. The\r\nfirst window--_i.e._ the westernmost window nearest to the slype--is a\r\nmemorial to J. Francillon, Esq., a judge of the county court, who died\r\nin 1866. The glass is by Hardman.\r\n\r\nThe first two carrel windows were filled with glass of a simple and\r\ninoffensive nature, by T. Fulljames, Esq., and the rest were filled by\r\nT. Holt, Esq., to the memory of members of his family, their initials\r\nbeing inserted in the lower corners.\r\n\r\nThe last window in this south alley is a memorial to R. B. Cooper, Esq.,\r\nas the brass tablet sets forth. The glass, which is by Hardman,\r\nrepresents the conversion and the execution of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nSome of the windows in the cloister are glazed with a peculiarly\r\ncharming white glass, which admits plenty of light, but is not\r\ntransparent. The effect is most restful to the eyes after examining some\r\nof the bizarre creations in the other windows.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloister windows are entirely filled with glass they will\r\ncontain a history of the Life of our Lord.\r\n\r\nBritton, in 1828, bemoaned the conversion of the garth into a kitchen\r\ngarden, and showed how the accumulation of vegetable refuse was injuring\r\nthe stone-work. There are still residents in Gloucester who can remember\r\nDean Law digging up his own potatoes in the garth. This is now the\r\nprivate garden of the Dean, and is very simply, and therefore\r\ncharmingly, laid out. It contains the old well of the Abbey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLOISTER, SHOWING THE CARRELS OF THE MONKS.\r\n               _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]\r\n\r\nThe present #Deanery# was originally the Abbot's lodging, in which royal\r\npersons, high ecclesiastics, and nobles were entertained. When, however,\r\nin the fourteenth century, a new Abbot's lodging was built on the site\r\nwhere the episcopal palace now stands, the Abbot's old lodging was\r\nassigned to the Prior. The Deanery (which, however, is not shown to\r\nvisitors), as it now stands, \"consists of two main blocks, built on two\r\nsides of a court--the one to the south, in the angle formed by the\r\ncloister and the church; the other to the west, with the court between\r\nit and the cloister.\" The southern block, which contained the private\r\napartments of the Abbot, consists of three large Norman chambers, one\r\nabove the other, with their original windows enriched within and without\r\nwith zig-zag mouldings. Each chamber has also in the north-east corner\r\nan inserted or altered doorway into a garde-robe tower (shown in\r\nCarter's plan, 1807), but now destroyed; and the two lowest chambers\r\nhave their southern corners crossed by stone arches, moulded or covered\r\nwith zig-zag ornaments. All these chambers are subdivided by partitions\r\ninto smaller rooms. Mr. Hope says:\r\n\r\n     \"The ground storey is entered from a vaulted lobby or antechamber,\r\n     now modernized and converted into a porch. The first floor has a\r\n     similar antechamber, as had originally also the second floor, but\r\n     this has been altered. These antechambers are all of early\r\n     thirteenth-century date, with a good deal of excellent work\r\n     remaining about the windows.\r\n\r\n     \"Between the church and the rooms just described is a building of\r\n     two storeys. The ground storey consists of a vaulted passage,\r\n     already described as the outer parlour. It is on a lower level than\r\n     the cloister, which is reached from it by a flight of steps. Over\r\n     it is a lofty room, also vaulted, which was the abbot's chapel. It\r\n     is now entered by an awkward skew passage from the first-floor\r\n     antechamber.\r\n\r\n     \"Both the chapel and outer parlour were once 9 feet longer, but\r\n     were shortened, and their west ends rebuilt with the old masonry,\r\n     at the same time that, I have reason to believe, the west front of\r\n     the church was rebuilt and also curtailed of a bay in the fifteenth\r\n     century. The first floor of all this part of the house contained\r\n     the abbot's private apartments, namely, his dining-room, bedroom,\r\n     solar, and chapel. The second floor was devoted to his own special\r\n     guests, while the ground storey contained a reception-room, and\r\n     probably accommodation for one or two servants.\r\n\r\n     \"At the north-west corner of this southern block is a\r\n     semi-octagonal turret. Until this was altered a few years ago it\r\n     contained the front entrance into the deanery, and within it a\r\n     flight of stairs led to a series of landings communicating with the\r\n     antechambers on the first and second floors, as well as the rooms\r\n     on the north. Both the turret and the landings replace a much\r\n     earlier entrance tower, nearly square in form, and of the same date\r\n     as the antechambers. Many traces of this remain, and show that it\r\n     was a handsome and important structure.\r\n\r\n     \"The western block of buildings, which is connected with the\r\n     southern block by the turret and landings, has been so altered in\r\n     the fifteenth century, and further modernized and enlarged of late\r\n     years, that it is very difficult to make out the original\r\n     arrangement. The southern half is two storeys high, with a large\r\n     hall on the upper floor and the servants' department below. The\r\n     hall is now divided into two rooms, lined with good Jacobean\r\n     panelling, and its fifteenth-century roof underdrawn by plaster\r\n     ceilings.\r\n\r\n     \"At the north end of the hall is another two-storey building. The\r\n     lower floor is of stone, and now contains various domestic offices.\r\n     But originally it formed part of a building of considerable\r\n     architectural importance, as may be seen from the jamb of an\r\n     elaborate Early English window at the north-west corner. From its\r\n     position, this Early English building, which seems to have extended\r\n     westward as far as the inner gate, was most likely the abbot's\r\n     hall, and here doubtless took place the famous historical dialogue\r\n     between Edward II. and Abbot Thoky.[1] Some time before the end of\r\n     the fifteenth century this hall was cut down, and an upper storey\r\n     of wood built upon it, of which the east end still remains. At one\r\n     time it evidently extended further west. Internally it has been\r\n     gutted, and now contains nothing of interest to show its use.\"\r\n\r\n\"The court of the Abbot's house was probably enclosed by covered alleys\r\non the north and west sides to enable the Abbot to pass into the\r\ncloister under cover. In the recent alterations to the Deanery, a block\r\nof additional rooms has been built on the west side of the court against\r\nthe hall.\" (Hope.)\r\n\r\nThere is a timber-framed room on the north-west where Richard II. is\r\nreputed to have held his parliament. It had a narrow escape some years\r\nago of being destroyed by a fire caused by an overheated flue.\r\n\r\nThe new lodging for the Abbot (1316-1329, _temp_. Wygmore) was built\r\nnear the infirmary garden, on the site now occupied by the Bishop's\r\nPalace. Drawings of the plans of the old buildings (made in 1856) are in\r\nthe custody of the Bishop, and reduced reproductions of them are to be\r\nfound in the \"Records of Gloucester Cathedral,\" 1897, in the article by\r\nMr Hope. Part of the buildings remain on the south side of Pitt Street,\r\nand serve to screen the palace from the road.\r\n\r\nThe #Bishop's Palace# is a modern building, erected in 1857-1862 by\r\nChristian on the site of the abbot's lodging.\r\n\r\nThe so-called #Grove#, laid out by a distinguished head-master of the\r\nKing's School, Maurice Wheeler, 1684-1712, on the north side of the\r\nchurch, was used as a school playground till 1855, presumably to the\r\ndetriment of the windows in the Lady Chapel. It was in that year thrown\r\ninto the gardens surrounding the east end of the cathedral. These\r\ngardens had been originally the monks' cemetery, and adjoining them had\r\nbeen the lay-folks' cemetery, extending along the greater part of the\r\nsouth side.\r\n\r\nWhen all the accumulation of soil was removed, and the ground lowered,\r\nthe foundations of the old walls were discovered.\r\n\r\nThe #Cathedral#, or #King's School#, is of Henry VIII. foundation. For\r\nmany years it was held in the old monastic library. A drawing of it is\r\ngiven in Bonnor's \"Perspective Itinerary,\" 1796. The present buildings\r\ndate back to 1850.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH AISLE OF NAVE.\r\n               _Photochrom Co.

His monks seem to have been as much addicted to \"ill\r\nlyvynge\" as the secular canons. He was succeeded by #Wulstan#\r\n(1058-1072), a monk of Worcester appointed by Bishop Aldred. In his time\r\nAldred rebuilt the monastery on new foundations. Wulstan died abroad on\r\na pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1072.\r\n\r\n#Serlo# (1072-1103), the next Abbot, had been the Conqueror's chaplain,\r\nand was a man of great strength of character, and of quite a different\r\nstamp. He was buried in the abbey church, which he had raised \"from\r\nmeanness and insignificance to a glorious pitch.\"\r\n\r\n#Peter#, who had been Prior, was Abbot from 1104-1113.\r\n\r\n#William Godemon#, #Godeman#, or #Godemore#, was Abbot from 1113-1130,\r\nwhen he retired.\r\n\r\n#Walter de Lacy# was appointed by Godeman and was consecrated in 1131.\r\nIn his time, Robert, Duke of Normandy, surnamed Curthose, died at\r\nCardiff after twenty-five years' imprisonment, and was buried in the\r\nchoir. Walter de Lacy died in 1139, and was succeeded by\r\n\r\n#Gilbert Foliot# (1139-1148), a Cluniac monk, who, owing his position to\r\nhis relative Milo, Earl of Hereford, was consecrated in 1139. He was\r\nmade Bishop of Hereford in 1148, and was translated thence to London.\r\nThough he owed much to Becket, his patron and tutor, he is said to have\r\ntaken the king's side in the quarrels with Becket, and to have been\r\ninstrumental in the latter's assassination.\r\n\r\n#Hameline# or #Hammeline# (1148-1179).\r\n\r\n#Thomas Carbonel# (1179-1205).\r\n\r\n#Henry Blond# (or #Blunt#) (1205-1224). Henry III. was crowned in the\r\nAbbey in 1216.\r\n\r\n#Thomas de Bredon# (or #Bredone#) (1224-1228).\r\n\r\n#Henry Foliot# (or #Foleth#) was Abbot from 1228-1243.\r\n\r\n#Walter de St. John# died before his installation.\r\n\r\n#John de Felda# (1243-1263).\r\n\r\n#Reginald de Hamme# (or #Homme#) (1263-1283).\r\n\r\n#John de Gamages# (1284-1306).\r\n\r\n#John Thokey# (or #Toky#) (1306-1329).\r\n\r\n#John Wygmore# (or #Wygemore#) (1329-1337).\r\n\r\n#Adam de Staunton# (1337-1351).\r\n\r\n#Thomas Horton# (1357-1377).\r\n\r\n#John Boyfield# (1377-1381).\r\n\r\n#Walter Froucester# (1381-1412).\r\n\r\nThe succession of Abbots, and the dates of various works executed since\r\nSerlo's time, are taken entirely from the particulars in the Chronicles\r\n\"attributed\" to Abbot Froucester (1381-1412), who wrote of the Abbey and\r\nof twenty Abbots after the Conquest. These Chronicles are the sole\r\nfoundation up to that date on which all the histories have been made.\r\nThere are three copies of them, one in the British Museum, one in\r\nQueen's College, Oxford, and one in the Chapter Library, which latter\r\nwas lost for many years, and ultimately heard of again in 1878 as being\r\nin the possession of a book-seller at Berlin, from whom it was rescued\r\non a payment of L150 by the Dean and Chapter.\r\n\r\n#Hugh Moreton# (1412-1420).\r\n\r\n#John Morwent# (or #Marewent#) (1421-1437).\r\n\r\n#Reginald Boulers# (#Boulars# or #Butler#) (#Boteler#) (1437-1450). He\r\nbecame Bishop of Hereford and was translated to Lichfield in 1453.\r\n\r\n#Thomas Seabroke# (1450-1457).\r\n\r\n#Richard Hanley# (1457-1472). He began to build the Lady Chapel, which\r\nwas finished by\r\n\r\n#William Farley# (1472-1498).\r\n\r\n#John Malvern# or #Mulverne# was Abbot for one year (1498-1499), and was\r\nsucceeded by a monk named\r\n\r\n#Thomas Braunche# (1500-1510), who in turn was succeeded by\r\n\r\n#John Newton# or #Browne, D.D.# (1510-1514).\r\n\r\n#William Malverne# or #Parker# (1514-1539).\r\n\r\nParker wrote a Rhythmical History of St. Peter's Abbey, which was\r\nreprinted in the appendix of Hearne's \"Robert of Gloucester's\r\nChronicle.\" It was compiled from local records extending up to the time\r\nof Abbot Horton.\r\n\r\nHe subscribed in 1534 to the King's supremacy, and remained Abbot till\r\nthe dissolution of the greater monasteries. Different traditions are\r\ncurrent as to his behaviour. Willis (in \"Mitred Abbeys\") describes him\r\nas losing his pension and the chance of preferment on the score of\r\ncontumacy. Another tradition asserts that the king promised him the\r\nbishopric, but that he died before the appointment was made. The place\r\nof his burial is not known, and it is hoped that his tomb will escape\r\ndesecration for the sake of gratifying mere idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOPS OF GLOUCESTER.\r\n\r\n#John Wakeman# (1541-1549) was the last abbot of Tewkesbury, and\r\nchaplain to Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n#John Hooper# (1550-1554) was originally a monk at Cleeve; afterwards\r\nbecame a Lutheran. He could not comply with the statute of the Six\r\nArticles, and left Oxford in 1539 and went abroad. In Edward VI.'s reign\r\nhe preached the reformed doctrine in London. He was instrumental in\r\nprocuring the deprivation of Bishop Bonner in 1549, and was extremely\r\nhostile to Gardiner. He was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester and\r\nWorcester by Archbishop Cranmer. He was summoned to London in 1553, and\r\nimprisoned. In 1554 his bishopric was declared void. He refused to\r\nrecant, and was burnt as an obstinate heretic in Gloucester in 1555.\r\n\r\n#James Brookes# (1554-1558). Formerly chaplain or almoner to Bishop\r\nGardiner, and a very zealous Papist. He was delegated by the Pope for\r\nthe examination and trial of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer.\r\n\r\n#Richard Cheiney# or #Cheyney# (1561-1579).\r\n\r\n#John Bullingham# (1581-1598).\r\n\r\n#Godfrey Goldsborough# (1598-1604).\r\n\r\n#Thomas Ravis# (1604-1607), previous to his institution, had been Dean\r\nof Christ Church, Oxford. He was one of the translators of the\r\nAuthorised Version. He was translated to London.\r\n\r\n#Henry Parry# (1607-1610) was translated from Rochester in 1607, and\r\nfrom Gloucester went to Worcester.\r\n\r\n#Giles Thompson# (1611-1612).\r\n\r\n#Miles Smith# (1612-1624). He was one of the translators of the\r\nAuthorised Version, and is said to have written the preface.\r\n\r\n#Godfrey Goodman# (1624-1640).\r\n\r\n#William Nicholson# (1660-1671).\r\n\r\n#John Prickett# or #Prichard# (1672-1680).\r\n\r\n#Robert Frampton# (1680-1690) was Dean in 1673. He refused to take the\r\noath of allegiance and supremacy after the accession of William III.,\r\nand was deprived of his office.\r\n\r\n#Edward Fowler# (1691-1714).\r\n\r\n#Richard Willis# (1714-1721) was translated to Salisbury in 1721, and\r\nthence to Winchester in 1725.\r\n\r\n#Joseph Wilcocks# (1721-1731). He was translated to Rochester, which see\r\nhe held, together with the Deanery of Westminster.\r\n\r\n#Elias Sydall# (1731-1733). Translated from St. David's. He was also\r\nDean of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n#Martin Benson# (1734-1752).\r\n\r\n#William Johnson# (1752-1759) was translated to Worcester in 1759.\r\n\r\n#William Warburton# (1759-1779). The well-known editor of Pope's works.\r\n\r\n#James Yorke# (1779-1781). When Dean of Lincoln was appointed Bishop of\r\nSt. David's, then translated to Gloucester in 1779, and in 1781 from\r\nthence to Ely.\r\n\r\n#Samuel Hallifax# (1781-1789). In 1789 he was translated to St. Asaph's,\r\na curious reversal of the usual order of episcopal promotion.\r\n\r\n#Richard Beadon# (1789-1802) was Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, in\r\n1781, but resigned on being made Bishop of Gloucester. Was translated to\r\nBath and Wells in 1802.\r\n\r\n#G. J. Huntingford# (1802-1815). He was translated to Hereford in 1815.\r\n\r\n#Henry Ryder# (1815-1824). Was Dean of Wells, previously Canon of\r\nWindsor. He was made Bishop of Gloucester in 1815 and was translated to\r\nLichfield in 1824.\r\n\r\n#Christopher Bethell# (1824-1830). Formerly Dean of Chichester. Was\r\nBishop of Exeter for one year, 1830-1831, and was then translated to\r\nBangor.\r\n\r\n#James Henry Monk# (1830-1856). Dean of Peterborough in 1822.\r\nConsecrated Bishop of Gloucester 1830, and from 1836, when the sees of\r\nGloucester and Bristol were united, was Bishop till his death in 1856.\r\n\r\n#Charles Baring# (1856-1861). Translated to Durham in 1861.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO MRS. MORLEY.\r\n               _H. C. Oakden, Photo._]\r\n\r\n#William Thomson# (1861-1862). Became Archbishop of York in 1862.\r\n\r\n#Charles John Ellicott# (1863-). One of the ablest of modern divines. He\r\nwas chairman for eleven years of the New Testament Revision Committee.\r\nHe has published commentaries on various epistles; also works on\r\n\"Scripture and its Interpretation,\" \"Modern Scepticism\"; also a\r\ncommentary for English Readers on the Old and also on the New Testament.\r\n\r\nThe sees of Gloucester and Bristol were separated in 1897, and the\r\nseparation took effect as from January 1st, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF GLOUCESTER\r\n\r\nGloucester has always been a town of importance, owing to its situation.\r\nA Roman camp was formed here in A.D. 43, and later it was fortified with\r\na massive wall (of which the traces still survive), as befitted a\r\nmilitary post equal in importance to Cirencester, Winchester,\r\nChichester, and Colchester. Much of modern Gloucester rests on Roman\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D., the country suffered from the\r\nstruggles between its petty kings, and from the invading hosts of the\r\nAngles, Jutes, and Saxons. In the end Gloucester, or Gleawan-ceastre,\r\nbecame one of the chief cities of the Mercian kingdom. Alfred held a\r\nWitan in the town in 896. Athelstan--the reputed founder of St. John's\r\nchurch--died in it in 940. King Edgar resided there in 965. Hardicanute\r\nand Edward the Confessor both held Witans here, but William the\r\nConqueror must always be the central figure in the long line of notable\r\nmen connected with Gloucester. It was in Gloucester that he spent his\r\nChristmas vacations when he could, and it was in the Chapter-House that\r\nhe took \"deep speech\" with his wise men, and ordered the compilation of\r\nDomesday Book. His son and successor was often at Gloucester, and as\r\nProfessor Freeman wrote, \"in the reign of Rufus almost everything that\r\nhappened at all, somehow contrived to happen at Gloucester.\" His death\r\nwas prophesied by the Abbot of Shrewsbury in a sermon in the Abbey, and\r\nwarning was sent to the king, but it was of no effect.\r\n\r\nHenry I., Henry II., and John were frequently in the town, and the\r\nyouthful Henry III. was crowned in the Abbey in 1216. Later on he was\r\nimprisoned in Gloucester by Sir Simon de Montfort. Edward I. held a\r\nParliament, which passed the celebrated Statutes of Gloucester. Edward\r\nII., foully murdered in Berkeley Castle, was buried in the choir of the\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nRichard II., in 1378, held his famous Parliament in the Abbey precincts.\r\nIn this Parliament the House of Commons secured for itself the right of\r\ncontrolling the financial arrangements of the nation.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. and V. assembled their Parliaments in Gloucester, and from\r\nGloucester Richard III. is said to have issued the death-warrant of his\r\nnephews. Henry VII. was well received as Earl of Richmond, when he\r\npassed through the town on his way to Bosworth Field. Henry VIII., with\r\nAnne Boleyn, is said to have spent a week in what is now the Deanery.\r\nLater he visited the neighbourhood with Jane Seymour. Elizabeth visited\r\nthe town, and stayed in the old house next to St. Nicholas' Church. She\r\ngave the city the privileges of a seaport, much to the annoyance of\r\nBristol. Gloucester supplied one ship to the navy at the time of the\r\nArmada in 1588. In the disastrous Civil War the city played an important\r\npart. It is said that the unpopularity of Laud, who had been Dean of\r\nGloucester, led the citizens to side with the Parliament. They held the\r\ncity under Colonel Massie, against enormous odds, through a long siege,\r\nand the king, who had his headquarters at Matson House, was obliged,\r\nowing to the approach of Essex with relief, to raise the siege. This was\r\na most serious blow to the failing cause of Charles I.\r\n\r\nDuring the Commonwealth the citizens seem to have lost their heads\r\nsomewhat, and to have turned against the officer who had saved their\r\ncity from destruction. Some, too, had made arrangements for demolishing\r\nthe Cathedral, but fortunately were frustrated in their plans.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy the city congratulated Charles II. at the\r\nRestoration in 1660, but without much result, as the walls and gates\r\nwere ordered to be destroyed. James II. visited Gloucester, and is said\r\nto have touched over a hundred persons for the king's evil, a proceeding\r\nto which he objected on the score of expense.\r\n\r\nThe last two Georges visited the city, and Queen Victoria visited it\r\nwhen Princess Victoria, and again later, after her marriage.\r\n\r\nThe city, like Tewkesbury, is a curious admixture of the new and the\r\nold. It has long emerged from the primitive state, and is now well\r\ndrained and well supplied with water; but the heavy penalty attaching to\r\ntransition has been paid, and many old houses and historic buildings,\r\nlike the Tolsey and others, have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe history of Gloucester, commercially, is a history of progress. In\r\nDomesday Book, Gloucester is mentioned in connection with iron, the\r\nfounding of nails for the king's ships. As the ore was obtained locally,\r\nthis branch of trade flourished till the seventeenth century.\r\nBell-founding was practised as early as 1350 by John Sandre, and one of\r\nhis bells still hangs and rings in the cathedral tower. Cloth-making,\r\ntoo, was practised, but, declining in the fifteenth century, was\r\nsuperseded by pin-making, for which Gloucester was for many years\r\nfamous. Glass-making was carried on in the seventeenth century, and the\r\nRudhall family for several generations had a bell-foundry of wide\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nElizabeth made the town a seaport, and it is one still. More than that,\r\nit is the most inland port in Britain, owing to the Berkeley Ship Canal,\r\nwhich enables ships to dispense with the awkwardness of a voyage up and\r\ndown the tortuous and dangerous Severn. It is to this canal that\r\nGloucester owes much of its present trade, as, by sea-going vessels,\r\ncorn and timber, its staple commodities, are brought in to the many\r\nwharves in ever-increasing quantities. To the railways--the Great\r\nWestern and the Midland--the town also owes much of its prosperity, and\r\none great industry, that of railway waggon building, gives employment to\r\nmany pairs of hands.\r\n\r\nIn Gloucester, or its neighbourhood, will be found the following\r\nbuildings of interest:--\r\n\r\n#Llanthony Priory.#--This was formerly an Augustinian convent, with a\r\nchurch attached, founded by Milo, Earl of Hereford, in 1136. It was\r\nfounded as an asylum for the convenience of the priory in Monmouthshire\r\nof the same name, which was so liable to be harried and pillaged by the\r\nWelsh. This priory was dissolved in 1539. The church was finally\r\ndestroyed to make way for the Ship Canal. Some remains exist in a farm,\r\nof which the masonry is good. A gateway, in the Perpendicular style,\r\nstill survives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Judges' House. Westgate St. Ed Burrow 1894]\r\n\r\n#St. Oswald's Priory.#--In 909 the Princess Elfleda caused the canonised\r\nrelics of King Oswald to be removed and richly entombed at Gloucester.\r\nShe also founded a college for secular priests, but later on it was\r\nconverted into a priory for regular canons. (Refounded 1153.)\r\n\r\nAttached to this priory was a chapel dedicated to St. Catherine, which,\r\nafter the dissolution of the priory, served for a parish church until\r\nits destruction in the siege in 1643. On this site the present Church of\r\nSt. Catherine was built in 1867-69.\r\n\r\nThe #Grey Friars# (or College of Friars minor, or Franciscans).--This\r\nbuilding formerly stood at the east end of the Church of St. Mary de\r\nCrypt.\r\n\r\nThe #White Friars# (or College of Carmelites).--This building, which was\r\nsituated without Lower Northgate Street, was founded by Queen Eleanor.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Elizabeth the college was converted into a house of\r\ncorrection. During the siege in 1643, it was used as a fortress.\r\nPortions of it remain incorporated with private houses.\r\n\r\nThe #Black Friars# (or College of Friars, Preachers).--This college was\r\nestablished by Henry III. in 1237.\r\n\r\nRemains of the building are still to be seen on the south side of the\r\nthoroughfare called Blackfriars.\r\n\r\nThe college was dissolved in 1538.\r\n\r\n#St. Mary de Lode# (or St. Mary before the Abbey Gate) stands on the\r\nsite of a Roman temple. The tower and chancel are all that remain of the\r\noriginal church, the rest being very disappointing, having been built in\r\n1826. The low square tower formerly had a lofty spire, which was\r\ndestroyed by a storm. The interior of the church has been lately\r\nrestored. The pulpit is a very fine specimen of carving. In the chancel\r\nis a tomb which used to be pointed out as that of Lucius, the first\r\nBritish Christian King.\r\n\r\n#St. John the Baptist# (in Northgate Street).--The original church is\r\nsupposed to have been founded by King Athelstan.\r\n\r\nThe present building was built in 1734, the tower being all that is left\r\nof the old church. The communion plate was presented in 1659 by Sir\r\nThomas Rich.\r\n\r\n#St. Mary de Crypt# (in Southgate Street) is well worth inspection. It\r\nhas two crypts--hence its name. The church is Early English, Decorated\r\nand Perpendicular, and was built by Robert Chichester, Bishop of Exeter,\r\n1138-1155. It is cruciform in shape, and, though much restored, of great\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThere are interesting brasses to Luke Garnon, John Cooke and his wife,\r\nand a curious squint or hagioscope. In the choir vestry is a monument to\r\nR. Raikes. On the north side is a marble monument to Dorothy Snell, by\r\nScheemaker.\r\n\r\nThe communion plate is all early seventeenth century, and very good,\r\nthough it has suffered from careless handling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: House of Robert Raikes.]\r\n\r\nClose by is the old building of the Crypt Grammar School. The school has\r\nmigrated to more open quarters.\r\n\r\n#St. Nicholas# is situated at the bottom of Westgate Street, and, owing\r\nto alterations in the street, is much below the level of the road. The\r\nfloor of the church is nearly two feet higher than it was originally.\r\nThere is much good Norman work, and some good Early English with\r\nPerpendicular insertions.\r\n\r\nOn the south door is a fine (so-called) sanctuary knocker; the door is\r\nquite unworthy of the knocker. Under the tower is some good late\r\nJacobean panelling. In the chancel are two squints, four each side,\r\narranged venetian-blind fashion. Several of the tombs are worth\r\ninspecting--viz. the Window monument in the chancel, 1659, and one to\r\nthe wife of Rev. Helpe-Fox, 1657. There is a good tomb to Alderman John\r\nWalton and his wife, 1626, which, though in good preservation, is\r\nbeginning to suffer from damp. There is also a brass, 1585, to Thos.\r\nSancky; and a slab to John Hanbury, who represented Gloucester in\r\nParliament in 1626. A fine view of the cathedral can be got from the top\r\nof the tower. The spire was shortened after being damaged in a storm.\r\nThe chimes are worth hearing.\r\n\r\n#St. Michael's# is situated where the four main streets meet, and near\r\nthe church was formerly the Cross. The church was restored in 1885, and\r\nthe monuments and tablets are all grouped together. The most interesting\r\nis a brass of 1519, to William Henshawe.\r\n\r\nThe curfew is still rung from the tower every evening.\r\n\r\n#Remains of Old Gloucester.#--The New Inn was built in Abbot Seabroke's\r\ntime by John Twynning or Twining (one of the monks), to accommodate the\r\nlarge number of pilgrims who came to the shrine of Edward II.\r\n\r\nClose by, at the corner of New Inn Lane, is a beautifully carved angle\r\npost and bracket, which has been preserved for many years by being\r\nplastered over (_vide_ p. 130). The houses on the right-hand side of the\r\nlane are also old.\r\n\r\nThe Gloucestershire Seed Warehouse, 154 Westgate Street, does not look\r\nspecially interesting, but up the passage, which was formerly \"Maverdine\r\nLane,\" is a portion of the old front of the house. It is a fine specimen\r\nof domestic architecture, with very good windows, and has a distinctly\r\nFlemish look. There are some good rooms inside, with oak panelling and\r\ncarving. A chimney-piece bears the text, \"I and my house will serve the\r\nLord,\" and it is dated 1633. The house is usually called the \"Old\r\nJudge's House,\" but it is more famous as the house from which Colonel\r\nMassie issued his orders in 1643 when Gloucester was besieged by Charles\r\nI. (_vide_ p. 125).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW INN.\r\n               From a Drawing by E. J. Burrow]\r\n\r\n163 Westgate Street contains a fine panelled room (the greater part\r\ndating back from 1530-1550), which was discovered in 1890 when\r\nalterations were being made. It is shown on payment of a fee, which\r\nincludes a printed description of the house. Some of the carving--such\r\nas the Royal Arms of England--seems earlier than 1520, but the arms may\r\nhave been copied from an earlier document. Near St. Nicholas' Church is\r\nanother interesting house, where Queen Elizabeth is said to have stayed\r\nin one of her many progresses through the country. The side of the house\r\nabuts curiously on the church of St. Nicholas. Inside there is a quaint\r\novermantel, with Elizabethan carving, and E.R. in the centre panel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARVING AT NEW INN LANE ED J BURROW 1897]\r\n\r\nIn Southgate Street, opposite the Corn Exchange, is a well-known house\r\nwith a carved front. There is an elaborate over-mantel dated 1650. It\r\nbears the arms of the Yates, the Berkeley, and the Box families.\r\nOpposite St. Nicholas' Church is the Bishop Hooper Pharmacy. It is said\r\nto be the house where the Bishop was kept closely guarded on the night\r\nbefore his execution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Remains of the Roman Wall Under 36 Westgate Sr.\r\n               Ed J. Burrow dil/94.]\r\n\r\nThe house of Robert Raikes, of Sunday School fame, is a fine house of\r\nthree gables, and is well preserved.\r\n\r\nThe house where Raikes held his first Sunday School can still be seen in\r\nSt. Catherine Street, Hare Lane.\r\n\r\nThe old Roman wall can be seen in several places--_e.g._ at 36 Westgate\r\nStreet, at Messrs Lea & Co.'s furniture warehouse in Northgate Street,\r\nat Mr John Bellows' in Eastgate Street.\r\n\r\nThe #Gloucester Candlestick.#--One of the most interesting relics of the\r\nAbbey of Gloucester is a candlestick which is now in the museum at South\r\nKensington. It is a remarkably fine piece of metal work, about 16 inches\r\nin height, cast by the _cera perduta_ process in very pale bronze,\r\nrichly gilt and decorated. The upright stem is divided into two\r\ncompartments by bosses, ornamented with the emblems of the Evangelists,\r\nand supporting a cup at the top. A triangular base supports the stem,\r\nand the whole is enriched with forty-two monsters in various grotesque\r\nattitudes, wrestling and struggling with nine human beings.\r\n\r\nRound the stem is a ribbon bearing the inscription--\r\n\r\n    ABBATIS PETRI GREGIS ET DEVOTIO MITIS ME DEDIT\r\n    ECCLESIE SANCTI PETRI GLOUCESTRE.\r\n\r\nRound the cup is a ribbon, on the outside of which a couplet is\r\ninscribed--\r\n\r\n    LUCIS ONUS VIRTUTIS OPUS DOCTRINA REFULGENS\r\n      PREDICAT UT VICIO NON TENEBRETUR HOMO.\r\n\r\nInside this same ribbon are two hexameters--\r\n\r\n    HOC CENOMANNENSIS RES ECCLESIE POCIENSIS\r\n    THOMAS DITAVIT CUM SOL ANNUM RENOVAVIT.\r\n\r\nAfter its removal from Gloucester, the candlestick was given to the\r\nCathedral of Le Mans by Thomas de Poche or de Poce (POCIENSIS).\r\nSubsequently it belonged to the Marquis d'Espaulart of Le Mans, and was\r\nsold to Prince Soltykoff for about L800, and finally was bought from his\r\ncollection for L680 for the Museum at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n#Bishop Hooper's Memorial# stands in the churchyard of St. Mary de Lode,\r\nand is on the actual site of the burning. This is perhaps the chief or\r\nthe only interest in the memorial, as its architectural merit is almost\r\n_nil_. The inscriptions to prevent defacement are glazed over, and as\r\nthe glass is broken the effect is wretched. A previous monument to the\r\nBishop was erected at the other end of the churchyard.\r\n\r\nAn interesting relic of the execution of the Bishop is in possession of\r\nthe rector of St. Mary's Church--viz. the sergeant's mace, which was the\r\nauthority of the soldiers who conducted the Bishop down to Gloucester.\r\nThis mace, which is the only surviving example of a London sergeant's\r\nmace, was found in a house in Westgate Street, belonging to a Mr Ingram.\r\nIt is to be hoped that some day the mace may be deposited in some public\r\nnational museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES, ARCHITECTURAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL\r\n\r\n                               Style.
