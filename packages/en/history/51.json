She and Diana Barry had been picking\r\napples in the Green Gables orchard, but were now resting from their\r\nlabors in a sunny corner, where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by\r\non the wings of a wind that was still summer-sweet with the incense of\r\nferns in the Haunted Wood.\r\n\r\nBut everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn. The sea\r\nwas roaring hollowly in the distance, the fields were bare and sere,\r\nscarfed with golden rod, the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed\r\nwith asters of ethereal purple, and the Lake of Shining Waters was\r\nblue—blue—blue; not the changeful blue of spring, nor the pale azure of\r\nsummer, but a clear, steadfast, serene blue, as if the water were past\r\nall moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility\r\nunbroken by fickle dreams.\r\n\r\n“It has been a nice summer,” said Diana, twisting the new ring on her\r\nleft hand with a smile. “And Miss Lavendar’s wedding seemed to come as\r\na sort of crown to it. I suppose Mr. and Mrs. Irving are on the Pacific\r\ncoast now.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the\r\nworld,” sighed Anne.\r\n\r\n“I can’t believe it is only a week since they were married. Everything\r\nhas changed. Miss Lavendar and Mr. and Mrs. Allan gone—how lonely the\r\nmanse looks with the shutters all closed! I went past it last night,\r\nand it made me feel as if everybody in it had died.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll never get another minister as nice as Mr. Allan,” said Diana,\r\nwith gloomy conviction. “I suppose we’ll have all kinds of supplies\r\nthis winter, and half the Sundays no preaching at all. And you and\r\nGilbert gone—it will be awfully dull.”\r\n\r\n“Fred will be here,” insinuated Anne slyly.\r\n\r\n“When is Mrs. Lynde going to move up?” asked Diana, as if she had not\r\nheard Anne’s remark.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow. I’m glad she’s coming—but it will be another change. Marilla\r\nand I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday. Do you know,\r\nI hated to do it? Of course, it was silly—but it did seem as if we were\r\ncommitting sacrilege. That old spare room has always seemed like a\r\nshrine to me. When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful\r\napartment in the world. You remember what a consuming desire I had to\r\nsleep in a spare room bed—but not the Green Gables spare room. Oh, no,\r\nnever there! It would have been too terrible—I couldn’t have slept a\r\nwink from awe. I never _walked_ through that room when Marilla sent me\r\nin on an errand—no, indeed, I tiptoed through it and held my breath, as\r\nif I were in church, and felt relieved when I got out of it. The\r\npictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there,\r\none on each side of the mirror, and frowned so sternly at me all the\r\ntime I was in, especially if I dared peep in the mirror, which was the\r\nonly one in the house that didn’t twist my face a little. I always\r\nwondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room. And now it’s not only\r\ncleaned but stripped bare. George Whitefield and the Duke have been\r\nrelegated to the upstairs hall. ‘So passes the glory of this world,’”\r\nconcluded Anne, with a laugh in which there was a little note of\r\nregret. It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated, even\r\nwhen we have outgrown them.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be so lonesome when you go,” moaned Diana for the hundredth time.\r\n“And to think you go next week!”\r\n\r\n“But we’re together still,” said Anne cheerily. “We mustn’t let next\r\nweek rob us of this week’s joy. I hate the thought of going myself—home\r\nand I are such good friends. Talk of being lonesome! It’s I who should\r\ngroan. _You’ll_ be here with any number of your old friends—_and_ Fred!\r\nWhile I shall be alone among strangers, not knowing a soul!”\r\n\r\n“_Except_ Gilbert—_and_ Charlie Sloane,” said Diana, imitating Anne’s\r\nitalics and slyness.\r\n\r\n“Charlie Sloane will be a great comfort, of course,” agreed Anne\r\nsarcastically; whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed.\r\nDiana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane; but, despite\r\nsundry confidential talks, she did not know just what Anne thought of\r\nGilbert Blythe. To be sure, Anne herself did not know that.\r\n\r\n“The boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport, for all I\r\nknow,” Anne went on. “I am glad I’m going to Redmond, and I am sure I\r\nshall like it after a while. But for the first few weeks I know I\r\nwon’t. I shan’t even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend\r\nvisit home, as I had when I went to Queen’s. Christmas will seem like a\r\nthousand years away.”\r\n\r\n“Everything is changing—or going to change,” said Diana sadly. “I have\r\na feeling that things will never be the same again, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“We have come to a parting of the ways, I suppose,” said Anne\r\nthoughtfully. “We had to come to it. Do you think, Diana, that being\r\ngrown-up is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we\r\nwere children?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know—there are _some_ nice things about it,” answered Diana,\r\nagain caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the\r\neffect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced. “But\r\nthere are so many puzzling things, too. Sometimes I feel as if being\r\ngrown-up just frightened me—and then I would give anything to be a\r\nlittle girl again.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we’ll get used to being grownup in time,” said Anne\r\ncheerfully. “There won’t be so many unexpected things about it by and\r\nby—though, after all, I fancy it’s the unexpected things that give\r\nspice to life. We’re eighteen, Diana. In two more years we’ll be\r\ntwenty. When I was ten I thought twenty was a green old age. In no time\r\nyou’ll be a staid, middle-aged matron, and I shall be nice, old maid\r\nAunt Anne, coming to visit you on vacations. You’ll always keep a\r\ncorner for me, won’t you, Di darling? Not the spare room, of course—old\r\nmaids can’t aspire to spare rooms, and I shall be as ’umble as _Uriah\r\nHeep_, and quite content with a little over-the-porch or off-the-parlor\r\ncubby hole.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense you do talk, Anne,” laughed Diana. “You’ll marry\r\nsomebody splendid and handsome and rich—and no spare room in Avonlea\r\nwill be half gorgeous enough for you—and you’ll turn up your nose at\r\nall the friends of your youth.”\r\n\r\n“That would be a pity; my nose is quite nice, but I fear turning it up\r\nwould spoil it,” said Anne, patting that shapely organ. “I haven’t so\r\nmany good features that I could afford to spoil those I have; so, even\r\nif I should marry the King of the Cannibal Islands, I promise you I\r\nwon’t turn up my nose at you, Diana.”\r\n\r\nWith another gay laugh the girls separated, Diana to return to Orchard\r\nSlope, Anne to walk to the Post Office. She found a letter awaiting her\r\nthere, and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her on the bridge over the Lake\r\nof Shining Waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it.\r\n\r\n“Priscilla Grant is going to Redmond, too,” she exclaimed. “Isn’t that\r\nsplendid? I hoped she would, but she didn’t think her father would\r\nconsent. He has, however, and we’re to board together. I feel that I\r\ncan face an army with banners—or all the professors of Redmond in one\r\nfell phalanx—with a chum like Priscilla by my side.”\r\n\r\n“I think we’ll like Kingsport,” said Gilbert. “It’s a nice old burg,\r\nthey tell me, and has the finest natural park in the world. I’ve heard\r\nthat the scenery in it is magnificent.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it will be—can be—any more beautiful than this,” murmured\r\nAnne, looking around her with the loving, enraptured eyes of those to\r\nwhom “home” must always be the loveliest spot in the world, no matter\r\nwhat fairer lands may lie under alien stars.\r\n\r\nThey were leaning on the bridge of the old pond, drinking deep of the\r\nenchantment of the dusk, just at the spot where Anne had climbed from\r\nher sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot. The fine,\r\nempurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies, but the moon\r\nwas rising and the water lay like a great, silver dream in her light.\r\nRemembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures.\r\n\r\n“You are very quiet, Anne,” said Gilbert at last.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will\r\nvanish just like a broken silence,” breathed Anne.\r\n\r\nGilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the\r\nrail of the bridge. His hazel eyes deepened into darkness, his still\r\nboyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled\r\nhis soul. But Anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly. The spell\r\nof the dusk was broken for her.\r\n\r\n“I must go home,” she exclaimed, with a rather overdone carelessness.\r\n“Marilla had a headache this afternoon, and I’m sure the twins will be\r\nin some dreadful mischief by this time. I really shouldn’t have stayed\r\naway so long.”\r\n\r\nShe chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached the\r\nGreen Gables lane. Poor Gilbert hardly had a chance to get a word in\r\nedgewise. Anne felt rather relieved when they parted. There had been a\r\nnew, secret self-consciousness in her heart with regard to Gilbert,\r\never since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of Echo\r\nLodge. Something alien had intruded into the old, perfect, school-day\r\ncomradeship—something that threatened to mar it.\r\n\r\n“I never felt glad to see Gilbert go before,” she thought,\r\nhalf-resentfully, half-sorrowfully, as she walked alone up the lane.\r\n“Our friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense. It\r\nmustn’t be spoiled—I won’t let it. Oh, _why_ can’t boys be just\r\nsensible!”\r\n\r\nAnne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly “sensible” that she\r\nshould still feel on her hand the warm pressure of Gilbert’s, as\r\ndistinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had rested\r\nthere; and still less sensible that the sensation was far from being an\r\nunpleasant one—very different from that which had attended a similar\r\ndemonstration on Charlie Sloane’s part, when she had been sitting out a\r\ndance with him at a White Sands party three nights before. Anne\r\nshivered over the disagreeable recollection. But all problems connected\r\nwith infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the\r\nhomely, unsentimental atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an\r\neight-year-old boy was crying grievously on the sofa.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Davy?” asked Anne, taking him up in her arms.\r\n“Where are Marilla and Dora?”\r\n\r\n“Marilla’s putting Dora to bed,” sobbed Davy, “and I’m crying ’cause\r\nDora fell down the outside cellar steps, heels over head, and scraped\r\nall the skin off her nose, and—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, don’t cry about it, dear. Of course, you are sorry for her,\r\nbut crying won’t help her any. She’ll be all right tomorrow. Crying\r\nnever helps any one, Davy-boy, and—”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t crying ’cause Dora fell down cellar,” said Davy, cutting short\r\nAnne’s wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness. “I’m crying,\r\ncause I wasn’t there to see her fall. I’m always missing some fun or\r\nother, seems to me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Davy!” Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter. “Would you\r\ncall it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the steps and get hurt?”\r\n\r\n“She wasn’t _much_ hurt,” said Davy, defiantly. “’Course, if she’d been\r\nkilled I’d have been real sorry, Anne. But the Keiths ain’t so easy\r\nkilled. They’re like the Blewetts, I guess. Herb Blewett fell off the\r\nhayloft last Wednesday, and rolled right down through the turnip chute\r\ninto the box stall, where they had a fearful wild, cross horse, and\r\nrolled right under his heels. And still he got out alive, with only\r\nthree bones broke. Mrs. Lynde says there are some folks you can’t kill\r\nwith a meat-axe. Is Mrs. Lynde coming here tomorrow, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Davy, and I hope you’ll be always very nice and good to her.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be nice and good. But will she ever put me to bed at nights,\r\nAnne?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. Why?”\r\n\r\n“’Cause,” said Davy very decidedly, “if she does I won’t say my prayers\r\nbefore her like I do before you, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“’Cause I don’t think it would be nice to talk to God before strangers,\r\nAnne. Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes, but _I_ won’t. I’ll\r\nwait till she’s gone and then say ’em. Won’t that be all right, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you are sure you won’t forget to say them, Davy-boy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I won’t forget, you bet. I think saying my prayers is great fun.\r\nBut it won’t be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you. I\r\nwish you’d stay home, Anne. I don’t see what you want to go away and\r\nleave us for.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t exactly _want_ to, Davy, but I feel I ought to go.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t want to go you needn’t. You’re grown up. When _I_’m grown\r\nup I’m not going to do one single thing I don’t want to do, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“All your life, Davy, you’ll find yourself doing things you don’t want\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” said Davy flatly. “Catch me! I have to do things I don’t\r\nwant to now ’cause you and Marilla’ll send me to bed if I don’t. But\r\nwhen I grow up you can’t do that, and there’ll be nobody to tell me not\r\nto do things. Won’t I have the time! Say, Anne, Milty Boulter says his\r\nmother says you’re going to college to see if you can catch a man. Are\r\nyou, Anne? I want to know.”\r\n\r\nFor a second Anne burned with resentment. Then she laughed, reminding\r\nherself that Mrs. Boulter’s crude vulgarity of thought and speech could\r\nnot harm her.\r\n\r\n“No, Davy, I’m not. I’m going to study and grow and learn about many\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“What things?”\r\n\r\n“‘Shoes and ships and sealing wax\r\nAnd cabbages and kings,’”\r\n\r\n\r\nquoted Anne.\r\n\r\n“But if you _did_ want to catch a man how would you go about it? I want\r\nto know,” persisted Davy, for whom the subject evidently possessed a\r\ncertain fascination.\r\n\r\n“You’d better ask Mrs. Boulter,” said Anne thoughtlessly. “I think it’s\r\nlikely she knows more about the process than I do.”\r\n\r\n“I will, the next time I see her,” said Davy gravely.\r\n\r\n“Davy! If you do!” cried Anne, realizing her mistake.\r\n\r\n“But you just told me to,” protested Davy aggrieved.\r\n\r\n“It’s time you went to bed,” decreed Anne, by way of getting out of the\r\nscrape.\r\n\r\nAfter Davy had gone to bed Anne wandered down to Victoria Island and\r\nsat there alone, curtained with fine-spun, moonlit gloom, while the\r\nwater laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind. Anne had always\r\nloved that brook. Many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in\r\ndays gone by. She forgot lovelorn youths, and the cayenne speeches of\r\nmalicious neighbors, and all the problems of her girlish existence. In\r\nimagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining\r\nshores of “faery lands forlorn,” where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie,\r\nwith the evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart’s Desire. And she\r\nwas richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen pass\r\naway, but the things that are unseen are eternal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nGarlands of Autumn\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following week sped swiftly, crowded with innumerable “last\r\nthings,” as Anne called them. Good-bye calls had to be made and\r\nreceived, being pleasant or otherwise, according to whether callers and\r\ncalled-upon were heartily in sympathy with Anne’s hopes, or thought she\r\nwas too much puffed-up over going to college and that it was their duty\r\nto “take her down a peg or two.”\r\n\r\nThe A.V.I.S. gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert one\r\nevening at the home of Josie Pye, choosing that place, partly because\r\nMr. Pye’s house was large and convenient, partly because it was\r\nstrongly suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing to do with the\r\naffair if their offer of the house for the party was not accepted. It\r\nwas a very pleasant little time, for the Pye girls were gracious, and\r\nsaid and did nothing to mar the harmony of the occasion—which was not\r\naccording to their wont. Josie was unusually amiable—so much so that\r\nshe even remarked condescendingly to Anne,\r\n\r\n“Your new dress is rather becoming to you, Anne. Really, you look\r\n_almost pretty_ in it.”\r\n\r\n“How kind of you to say so,” responded Anne, with dancing eyes. Her\r\nsense of humor was developing, and the speeches that would have hurt\r\nher at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now. Josie\r\nsuspected that Anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes; but\r\nshe contented herself with whispering to Gertie, as they went\r\ndownstairs, that Anne Shirley would put on more airs than ever now that\r\nshe was going to college—you’d see!\r\n\r\nAll the “old crowd” was there, full of mirth and zest and youthful\r\nlightheartedness. Diana Barry, rosy and dimpled, shadowed by the\r\nfaithful Fred; Jane Andrews, neat and sensible and plain; Ruby Gillis,\r\nlooking her handsomest and brightest in a cream silk blouse, with red\r\ngeraniums in her golden hair; Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane, both\r\ntrying to keep as near the elusive Anne as possible; Carrie Sloane,\r\nlooking pale and melancholy because, so it was reported, her father\r\nwould not allow Oliver Kimball to come near the place; Moody Spurgeon\r\nMacPherson, whose round face and objectionable ears were as round and\r\nobjectionable as ever; and Billy Andrews, who sat in a corner all the\r\nevening, chuckled when any one spoke to him, and watched Anne Shirley\r\nwith a grin of pleasure on his broad, freckled countenance.\r\n\r\nAnne had known beforehand of the party, but she had not known that she\r\nand Gilbert were, as the founders of the Society, to be presented with\r\na very complimentary “address” and “tokens of respect”—in her case a\r\nvolume of Shakespeare’s plays, in Gilbert’s a fountain pen. She was so\r\ntaken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address,\r\nread in Moody Spurgeon’s most solemn and ministerial tones, that the\r\ntears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes. She had worked\r\nhard and faithfully for the A.V.I.S., and it warmed the cockles of her\r\nheart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely. And they\r\nwere all so nice and friendly and jolly—even the Pye girls had their\r\nmerits; at that moment Anne loved all the world.\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed the evening tremendously, but the end of it rather spoiled\r\nall. Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to\r\nher as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah; and Anne, to\r\npunish him, was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed the latter to\r\nwalk home with her. She found, however, that revenge hurts nobody quite\r\nso much as the one who tries to inflict it. Gilbert walked airily off\r\nwith Ruby Gillis, and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily\r\nas they loitered along in the still, crisp autumn air. They were\r\nevidently having the best of good times, while she was horribly bored\r\nby Charlie Sloane, who talked unbrokenly on, and never, even by\r\naccident, said one thing that was worth listening to. Anne gave an\r\noccasional absent “yes” or “no,” and thought how beautiful Ruby had\r\nlooked that night, how very goggly Charlie’s eyes were in the\r\nmoonlight—worse even than by daylight—and that the world, somehow,\r\nwasn’t quite such a nice place as she had believed it to be earlier in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n“I’m just tired out—that is what is the matter with me,” she said, when\r\nshe thankfully found herself alone in her own room. And she honestly\r\nbelieved it was. But a certain little gush of joy, as from some secret,\r\nunknown spring, bubbled up in her heart the next evening, when she saw\r\nGilbert striding down through the Haunted Wood and crossing the old log\r\nbridge with that firm, quick step of his. So Gilbert was not going to\r\nspend this last evening with Ruby Gillis after all!\r\n\r\n“You look tired, Anne,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am tired, and, worse than that, I’m disgruntled. I’m tired because\r\nI’ve been packing my trunk and sewing all day. But I’m disgruntled\r\nbecause six women have been here to say good-bye to me, and every one\r\nof the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right\r\nout of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Spiteful old cats!” was Gilbert’s elegant comment.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, they weren’t,” said Anne seriously. “That is just the trouble.\r\nIf they had been spiteful cats I wouldn’t have minded them. But they\r\nare all nice, kind, motherly souls, who like me and whom I like, and\r\nthat is why what they said, or hinted, had such undue weight with me.\r\nThey let me see they thought I was crazy going to Redmond and trying to\r\ntake a B.A., and ever since I’ve been wondering if I am. Mrs. Peter\r\nSloane sighed and said she hoped my strength would hold out till I got\r\nthrough; and at once I saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous\r\nprostration at the end of my third year; Mrs. Eben Wright said it must\r\ncost an awful lot to put in four years at Redmond; and I felt all over\r\nme that it was unpardonable of me to squander Marilla’s money and my\r\nown on such a folly. Mrs. Jasper Bell said she hoped I wouldn’t let\r\ncollege spoil me, as it did some people; and I felt in my bones that\r\nthe end of my four Redmond years would see me a most insufferable\r\ncreature, thinking I knew it all, and looking down on everything and\r\neverybody in Avonlea; Mrs. Elisha Wright said she understood that\r\nRedmond girls, especially those who belonged to Kingsport, were\r\n‘dreadful dressy and stuck-up,’ and she guessed I wouldn’t feel much at\r\nhome among them; and I saw myself, a snubbed, dowdy, humiliated country\r\ngirl, shuffling through Redmond’s classic halls in coppertoned boots.”\r\n\r\nAnne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled. With her sensitive\r\nnature all disapproval had weight, even the disapproval of those for\r\nwhose opinions she had scant respect. For the time being life was\r\nsavorless, and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle.\r\n\r\n“You surely don’t care for what they said,” protested Gilbert. “You\r\nknow exactly how narrow their outlook on life is, excellent creatures\r\nthough they are. To do anything _they_ have never done is anathema\r\nmaranatha. You are the first Avonlea girl who has ever gone to college;\r\nand you know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with\r\nmoonstruck madness.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know. But _feeling_ is so different from _knowing_. My common\r\nsense tells me all you can say, but there are times when common sense\r\nhas no power over me. Common nonsense takes possession of my soul.\r\nReally, after Mrs. Elisha went away I hardly had the heart to finish\r\npacking.”\r\n\r\n“You’re just tired, Anne. Come, forget it all and take a walk with me—a\r\nramble back through the woods beyond the marsh. There should be\r\nsomething there I want to show you.”\r\n\r\n“Should be! Don’t you know if it is there?”\r\n\r\n“No. I only know it should be, from something I saw there in spring.\r\nCome on. We’ll pretend we are two children again and we’ll go the way\r\nof the wind.”\r\n\r\nThey started gaily off. Anne, remembering the unpleasantness of the\r\npreceding evening, was very nice to Gilbert; and Gilbert, who was\r\nlearning wisdom, took care to be nothing save the schoolboy comrade\r\nagain. Mrs. Lynde and Marilla watched them from the kitchen window.\r\n\r\n“That’ll be a match some day,” Mrs. Lynde said approvingly.\r\n\r\nMarilla winced slightly. In her heart she hoped it would, but it went\r\nagainst her grain to hear the matter spoken of in Mrs. Lynde’s gossipy\r\nmatter-of-fact way.\r\n\r\n“They’re only children yet,” she said shortly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde laughed good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n“Anne is eighteen; I was married when I was that age. We old folks,\r\nMarilla, are too much given to thinking children never grow up, that’s\r\nwhat. Anne is a young woman and Gilbert’s a man, and he worships the\r\nground she walks on, as any one can see. He’s a fine fellow, and Anne\r\ncan’t do better. I hope she won’t get any romantic nonsense into her\r\nhead at Redmond. I don’t approve of them coeducational places and never\r\ndid, that’s what. I don’t believe,” concluded Mrs. Lynde solemnly,\r\n“that the students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt.”\r\n\r\n“They must study a little,” said Marilla, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Precious little,” sniffed Mrs. Rachel. “However, I think Anne will.\r\nShe never was flirtatious. But she doesn’t appreciate Gilbert at his\r\nfull value, that’s what. Oh, I know girls! Charlie Sloane is wild about\r\nher, too, but I’d never advise her to marry a Sloane. The Sloanes are\r\ngood, honest, respectable people, of course. But when all’s said and\r\ndone, they’re _Sloanes_.”\r\n\r\nMarilla nodded. To an outsider, the statement that Sloanes were Sloanes\r\nmight not be very illuminating, but she understood. Every village has\r\nsuch a family; good, honest, respectable people they may be, but\r\n_Sloanes_ they are and must ever remain, though they speak with the\r\ntongues of men and angels.\r\n\r\nGilbert and Anne, happily unconscious that their future was thus being\r\nsettled by Mrs. Rachel, were sauntering through the shadows of the\r\nHaunted Wood. Beyond, the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset\r\nradiance, under a pale, aerial sky of rose and blue. The distant spruce\r\ngroves were burnished bronze, and their long shadows barred the upland\r\nmeadows. But around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels, and\r\nin it there was the note of autumn.\r\n\r\n“This wood really is haunted now—by old memories,” said Anne, stooping\r\nto gather a spray of ferns, bleached to waxen whiteness by frost. “It\r\nseems to me that the little girls Diana and I used to be play here\r\nstill, and sit by the Dryad’s Bubble in the twilights, trysting with\r\nthe ghosts. Do you know, I can never go up this path in the dusk\r\nwithout feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver? There was one\r\nespecially horrifying phantom which we created—the ghost of the\r\nmurdered child that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours.\r\nI confess that, to this day, I cannot help fancying its little, furtive\r\nfootsteps behind me when I come here after nightfall. I’m not afraid of\r\nthe White Lady or the headless man or the skeletons, but I wish I had\r\nnever imagined that baby’s ghost into existence. How angry Marilla and\r\nMrs. Barry were over that affair,” concluded Anne, with reminiscent\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nThe woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas,\r\nthreaded with gossamers. Past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces and\r\na maple-fringed, sun-warm valley they found the “something” Gilbert was\r\nlooking for.\r\n\r\n“Ah, here it is,” he said with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“An apple tree—and away back here!” exclaimed Anne delightedly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a veritable apple-bearing apple tree, too, here in the very midst\r\nof pines and beeches, a mile away from any orchard. I was here one day\r\nlast spring and found it, all white with blossom. So I resolved I’d\r\ncome again in the fall and see if it had been apples. See, it’s loaded.\r\nThey look good, too—tawny as russets but with a dusky red cheek. Most\r\nwild seedlings are green and uninviting.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it sprang years ago from some chance-sown seed,” said Anne\r\ndreamily. “And how it has grown and flourished and held its own here\r\nall alone among aliens, the brave determined thing!”\r\n\r\n“Here’s a fallen tree with a cushion of moss. Sit down, Anne—it will\r\nserve for a woodland throne. I’ll climb for some apples. They all grow\r\nhigh—the tree had to reach up to the sunlight.”\r\n\r\nThe apples proved to be delicious. Under the tawny skin was a white,\r\nwhite flesh, faintly veined with red; and, besides their own proper\r\napple taste, they had a certain wild, delightful tang no orchard-grown\r\napple ever possessed.\r\n\r\n“The fatal apple of Eden couldn’t have had a rarer flavor,” commented\r\nAnne. “But it’s time we were going home. See, it was twilight three\r\nminutes ago and now it’s moonlight. What a pity we couldn’t have caught\r\nthe moment of transformation. But such moments never are caught, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go back around the marsh and home by way of Lover’s Lane. Do you\r\nfeel as disgruntled now as when you started out, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Not I. Those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul. I feel that I\r\nshall love Redmond and have a splendid four years there.”\r\n\r\n“And after those four years—what?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there’s another bend in the road at their end,” answered Anne\r\nlightly. “I’ve no idea what may be around it—I don’t want to have. It’s\r\nnicer not to know.”\r\n\r\nLover’s Lane was a dear place that night, still and mysteriously dim in\r\nthe pale radiance of the moonlight. They loitered through it in a\r\npleasant chummy silence, neither caring to talk.\r\n\r\n“If Gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and simple\r\neverything would be,” reflected Anne.\r\n\r\nGilbert was looking at Anne, as she walked along. In her light dress,\r\nwith her slender delicacy, she made him think of a white iris.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if I can ever make her care for me,” he thought, with a pang\r\nof self-distrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\nGreeting and Farewell\r\n\r\n\r\nCharlie Sloane, Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley left Avonlea the\r\nfollowing Monday morning. Anne had hoped for a fine day. Diana was to\r\ndrive her to the station and they wanted this, their last drive\r\ntogether for some time, to be a pleasant one. But when Anne went to bed\r\nSunday night the east wind was moaning around Green Gables with an\r\nominous prophecy which was fulfilled in the morning. Anne awoke to find\r\nraindrops pattering against her window and shadowing the pond’s gray\r\nsurface with widening rings; hills and sea were hidden in mist, and the\r\nwhole world seemed dim and dreary. Anne dressed in the cheerless gray\r\ndawn, for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train; she\r\nstruggled against the tears that _would_ well up in her eyes in spite\r\nof herself. She was leaving the home that was so dear to her, and\r\nsomething told her that she was leaving it forever, save as a holiday\r\nrefuge. Things would never be the same again; coming back for vacations\r\nwould not be living there. And oh, how dear and beloved everything\r\nwas—that little white porch room, sacred to the dreams of girlhood, the\r\nold Snow Queen at the window, the brook in the hollow, the Dryad’s\r\nBubble, the Haunted Woods, and Lover’s Lane—all the thousand and one\r\ndear spots where memories of the old years bided. Could she ever be\r\nreally happy anywhere else?\r\n\r\nBreakfast at Green Gables that morning was a rather doleful meal. Davy,\r\nfor the first time in his life probably, could not eat, but blubbered\r\nshamelessly over his porridge. Nobody else seemed to have much\r\nappetite, save Dora, who tucked away her rations comfortably. Dora,\r\nlike the immortal and most prudent Charlotte, who “went on cutting\r\nbread and butter” when her frenzied lover’s body had been carried past\r\non a shutter, was one of those fortunate creatures who are seldom\r\ndisturbed by anything. Even at eight it took a great deal to ruffle\r\nDora’s placidity. She was sorry Anne was going away, of course, but was\r\nthat any reason why she should fail to appreciate a poached egg on\r\ntoast? Not at all. And, seeing that Davy could not eat his, Dora ate it\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nPromptly on time Diana appeared with horse and buggy, her rosy face\r\nglowing above her raincoat. The good-byes had to be said then somehow.\r\nMrs. Lynde came in from her quarters to give Anne a hearty embrace and\r\nwarn her to be careful of her health, whatever she did. Marilla,\r\nbrusque and tearless, pecked Anne’s cheek and said she supposed they’d\r\nhear from her when she got settled. A casual observer might have\r\nconcluded that Anne’s going mattered very little to her—unless said\r\nobserver had happened to get a good look in her eyes. Dora kissed Anne\r\nprimly and squeezed out two decorous little tears; but Davy, who had\r\nbeen crying on the back porch step ever since they rose from the table,\r\nrefused to say good-bye at all. When he saw Anne coming towards him he\r\nsprang to his feet, bolted up the back stairs, and hid in a clothes\r\ncloset, out of which he would not come. His muffled howls were the last\r\nsounds Anne heard as she left Green Gables.\r\n\r\nIt rained heavily all the way to Bright River, to which station they\r\nhad to go, since the branch line train from Carmody did not connect\r\nwith the boat train. Charlie and Gilbert were on the station platform\r\nwhen they reached it, and the train was whistling. Anne had just time\r\nto get her ticket and trunk check, say a hurried farewell to Diana, and\r\nhasten on board. She wished she were going back with Diana to Avonlea;\r\nshe knew she was going to die of homesickness. And oh, if only that\r\ndismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping\r\nover summer vanished and joys departed! Even Gilbert’s presence brought\r\nher no comfort, for Charlie Sloane was there, too, and Sloanishness\r\ncould be tolerated only in fine weather. It was absolutely insufferable\r\nin rain.\r\n\r\nBut when the boat steamed out of Charlottetown harbor things took a\r\nturn for the better. The rain ceased and the sun began to burst out\r\ngoldenly now and again between the rents in the clouds, burnishing the\r\ngray seas with copper-hued radiance, and lighting up the mists that\r\ncurtained the Island’s red shores with gleams of gold foretokening a\r\nfine day after all. Besides, Charlie Sloane promptly became so seasick\r\nthat he had to go below, and Anne and Gilbert were left alone on deck.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad that all the Sloanes get seasick as soon as they go on\r\nwater,” thought Anne mercilessly. “I am sure I couldn’t take my\r\nfarewell look at the ‘ould sod’ with Charlie standing there pretending\r\nto look sentimentally at it, too.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’re off,” remarked Gilbert unsentimentally.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I feel like Byron’s ‘Childe Harold’—only it isn’t really my\r\n‘native shore’ that I’m watching,” said Anne, winking her gray eyes\r\nvigorously. “Nova Scotia is that, I suppose. But one’s native shore is\r\nthe land one loves the best, and that’s good old P.E.I. for me. I can’t\r\nbelieve I didn’t always live here. Those eleven years before I came\r\nseem like a bad dream. It’s seven years since I crossed on this\r\nboat—the evening Mrs. Spencer brought me over from Hopetown. I can see\r\nmyself, in that dreadful old wincey dress and faded sailor hat,\r\nexploring decks and cabins with enraptured curiosity. It was a fine\r\nevening; and how those red Island shores did gleam in the sunshine. Now\r\nI’m crossing the strait again. Oh, Gilbert, I do hope I’ll like Redmond\r\nand Kingsport, but I’m sure I won’t!”\r\n\r\n“Where’s all your philosophy gone, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all submerged under a great, swamping wave of loneliness and\r\nhomesickness. I’ve longed for three years to go to Redmond—and now I’m\r\ngoing—and I wish I weren’t! Never mind! I shall be cheerful and\r\nphilosophical again after I have just one good cry. I _must_ have that,\r\n‘as a went’—and I’ll have to wait until I get into my boardinghouse bed\r\ntonight, wherever it may be, before I can have it. Then Anne will be\r\nherself again. I wonder if Davy has come out of the closet yet.”\r\n\r\nIt was nine that night when their train reached Kingsport, and they\r\nfound themselves in the blue-white glare of the crowded station. Anne\r\nfelt horribly bewildered, but a moment later she was seized by\r\nPriscilla Grant, who had come to Kingsport on Saturday.\r\n\r\n“Here you are, beloved! And I suppose you’re as tired as I was when I\r\ngot here Saturday night.”\r\n\r\n“Tired! Priscilla, don’t talk of it. I’m tired, and green, and\r\nprovincial, and only about ten years old. For pity’s sake take your\r\npoor, broken-down chum to some place where she can hear herself think.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take you right up to our boardinghouse. I’ve a cab ready\r\noutside.”\r\n\r\n“It’s such a blessing you’re here, Prissy. If you weren’t I think I\r\nshould just sit down on my suitcase, here and now, and weep bitter\r\ntears. What a comfort one familiar face is in a howling wilderness of\r\nstrangers!”\r\n\r\n“Is that Gilbert Blythe over there, Anne? How he has grown up this past\r\nyear! He was only a schoolboy when I taught in Carmody. And of course\r\nthat’s Charlie Sloane. _He_ hasn’t changed—couldn’t! He looked just\r\nlike that when he was born, and he’ll look like that when he’s eighty.\r\nThis way, dear. We’ll be home in twenty minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Home!” groaned Anne. “You mean we’ll be in some horrible\r\nboardinghouse, in a still more horrible hall bedroom, looking out on a\r\ndingy back yard.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a horrible boardinghouse, Anne-girl. Here’s our cab. Hop\r\nin—the driver will get your trunk. Oh, yes, the boardinghouse—it’s\r\nreally a very nice place of its kind, as you’ll admit tomorrow morning\r\nwhen a good night’s sleep has turned your blues rosy pink. It’s a big,\r\nold-fashioned, gray stone house on St. John Street, just a nice little\r\nconstitutional from Redmond. It used to be the ‘residence’ of great\r\nfolk, but fashion has deserted St. John Street and its houses only\r\ndream now of better days. They’re so big that people living in them\r\nhave to take boarders just to fill up. At least, that is the reason our\r\nlandladies are very anxious to impress on us. They’re delicious,\r\nAnne—our landladies, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“How many are there?”\r\n\r\n“Two. Miss Hannah Harvey and Miss Ada Harvey. They were born twins\r\nabout fifty years ago.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t get away from twins, it seems,” smiled Anne. “Wherever I go\r\nthey confront me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they’re not twins now, dear. After they reached the age of thirty\r\nthey never were twins again. Miss Hannah has grown old, not too\r\ngracefully, and Miss Ada has stayed thirty, less gracefully still. I\r\ndon’t know whether Miss Hannah can smile or not; I’ve never caught her\r\nat it so far, but Miss Ada smiles all the time and that’s worse.\r\nHowever, they’re nice, kind souls, and they take two boarders every\r\nyear because Miss Hannah’s economical soul cannot bear to ‘waste room\r\nspace’—not because they need to or have to, as Miss Ada has told me\r\nseven times since Saturday night. As for our rooms, I admit they are\r\nhall bedrooms, and mine does look out on the back yard. Your room is a\r\nfront one and looks out on Old St. John’s graveyard, which is just\r\nacross the street.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds gruesome,” shivered Anne. “I think I’d rather have the\r\nback yard view.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, you wouldn’t. Wait and see. Old St. John’s is a darling place.\r\nIt’s been a graveyard so long that it’s ceased to be one and has become\r\none of the sights of Kingsport. I was all through it yesterday for a\r\npleasure exertion. There’s a big stone wall and a row of enormous trees\r\nall around it, and rows of trees all through it, and the queerest old\r\ntombstones, with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions. You’ll go\r\nthere to study, Anne, see if you don’t. Of course, nobody is ever\r\nburied there now. But a few years ago they put up a beautiful monument\r\nto the memory of Nova Scotian soldiers who fell in the Crimean War. It\r\nis just opposite the entrance gates and there’s ‘scope for imagination’\r\nin it, as you used to say. Here’s your trunk at last—and the boys\r\ncoming to say good night. Must I really shake hands with Charlie\r\nSloane, Anne? His hands are always so cold and fishy-feeling. We must\r\nask them to call occasionally. Miss Hannah gravely told me we could\r\nhave ‘young gentlemen callers’ two evenings in the week, if they went\r\naway at a reasonable hour; and Miss Ada asked me, smiling, please to be\r\nsure they didn’t sit on her beautiful cushions. I promised to see to\r\nit; but goodness knows where else they _can_ sit, unless they sit on\r\nthe floor, for there are cushions on _everything_. Miss Ada even has an\r\nelaborate Battenburg one on top of the piano.”\r\n\r\nAnne was laughing by this time. Priscilla’s gay chatter had the\r\nintended effect of cheering her up; homesickness vanished for the time\r\nbeing, and did not even return in full force when she finally found\r\nherself alone in her little bedroom. She went to her window and looked\r\nout. The street below was dim and quiet. Across it the moon was shining\r\nabove the trees in Old St. John’s, just behind the great dark head of\r\nthe lion on the monument. Anne wondered if it could have been only that\r\nmorning that she had left Green Gables. She had the sense of a long\r\npassage of time which one day of change and travel gives.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that very moon is looking down on Green Gables now,” she\r\nmused. “But I won’t think about it—that way homesickness lies. I’m not\r\neven going to have my good cry. I’ll put that off to a more convenient\r\nseason, and just now I’ll go calmly and sensibly to bed and to sleep.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\nApril’s Lady\r\n\r\n\r\nKingsport is a quaint old town, hearking back to early Colonial days,\r\nand wrapped in its ancient atmosphere, as some fine old dame in\r\ngarments fashioned like those of her youth. Here and there it sprouts\r\nout into modernity, but at heart it is still unspoiled; it is full of\r\ncurious relics, and haloed by the romance of many legends of the past.\r\nOnce it was a mere frontier station on the fringe of the wilderness,\r\nand those were the days when Indians kept life from being monotonous to\r\nthe settlers. Then it grew to be a bone of contention between the\r\nBritish and the French, being occupied now by the one and now by the\r\nother, emerging from each occupation with some fresh scar of battling\r\nnations branded on it.\r\n\r\nIt has in its park a martello tower, autographed all over by tourists,\r\na dismantled old French fort on the hills beyond the town, and several\r\nantiquated cannon in its public squares. It has other historic spots\r\nalso, which may be hunted out by the curious, and none is more quaint\r\nand delightful than Old St. John’s Cemetery at the very core of the\r\ntown, with streets of quiet, old-time houses on two sides, and busy,\r\nbustling, modern thoroughfares on the others. Every citizen of\r\nKingsport feels a thrill of possessive pride in Old St. John’s, for, if\r\nhe be of any pretensions at all, he has an ancestor buried there, with\r\na queer, crooked slab at his head, or else sprawling protectively over\r\nthe grave, on which all the main facts of his history are recorded. For\r\nthe most part no great art or skill was lavished on those old\r\ntombstones. The larger number are of roughly chiselled brown or gray\r\nnative stone, and only in a few cases is there any attempt at\r\nornamentation. Some are adorned with skull and cross-bones, and this\r\ngrizzly decoration is frequently coupled with a cherub’s head. Many are\r\nprostrate and in ruins. Into almost all Time’s tooth has been gnawing,\r\nuntil some inscriptions have been completely effaced, and others can\r\nonly be deciphered with difficulty. The graveyard is very full and very\r\nbowery, for it is surrounded and intersected by rows of elms and\r\nwillows, beneath whose shade the sleepers must lie very dreamlessly,\r\nforever crooned to by the winds and leaves over them, and quite\r\nundisturbed by the clamor of traffic just beyond.\r\n\r\nAnne took the first of many rambles in Old St. John’s the next\r\nafternoon. She and Priscilla had gone to Redmond in the forenoon and\r\nregistered as students, after which there was nothing more to do that\r\nday. The girls gladly made their escape, for it was not exhilarating to\r\nbe surrounded by crowds of strangers, most of whom had a rather alien\r\nappearance, as if not quite sure where they belonged.\r\n\r\nThe “freshettes” stood about in detached groups of two or three,\r\nlooking askance at each other; the “freshies,” wiser in their day and\r\ngeneration, had banded themselves together on the big staircase of the\r\nentrance hall, where they were shouting out glees with all the vigor of\r\nyouthful lungs, as a species of defiance to their traditional enemies,\r\nthe Sophomores, a few of whom were prowling loftily about, looking\r\nproperly disdainful of the “unlicked cubs” on the stairs. Gilbert and\r\nCharlie were nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n“Little did I think the day would ever come when I’d be glad of the\r\nsight of a Sloane,” said Priscilla, as they crossed the campus, “but\r\nI’d welcome Charlie’s goggle eyes almost ecstatically. At least, they’d\r\nbe familiar eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” sighed Anne. “I can’t describe how I felt when I was standing\r\nthere, waiting my turn to be registered—as insignificant as the\r\nteeniest drop in a most enormous bucket. It’s bad enough to feel\r\ninsignificant, but it’s unbearable to have it grained into your soul\r\nthat you will never, can never, be anything but insignificant, and that\r\nis how I did feel—as if I were invisible to the naked eye and some of\r\nthose Sophs might step on me. I knew I would go down to my grave\r\nunwept, unhonored and unsung.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till next year,” comforted Priscilla. “Then we’ll be able to look\r\nas bored and sophisticated as any Sophomore of them all. No doubt it is\r\nrather dreadful to feel insignificant; but I think it’s better than to\r\nfeel as big and awkward as I did—as if I were sprawled all over\r\nRedmond. That’s how I felt—I suppose because I was a good two inches\r\ntaller than any one else in the crowd. I wasn’t afraid a Soph might\r\nwalk over me; I was afraid they’d take me for an elephant, or an\r\novergrown sample of a potato-fed Islander.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the trouble is we can’t forgive big Redmond for not being\r\nlittle Queen’s,” said Anne, gathering about her the shreds of her old\r\ncheerful philosophy to cover her nakedness of spirit. “When we left\r\nQueen’s we knew everybody and had a place of our own. I suppose we have\r\nbeen unconsciously expecting to take life up at Redmond just where we\r\nleft off at Queen’s, and now we feel as if the ground had slipped from\r\nunder our feet. I’m thankful that neither Mrs. Lynde nor Mrs. Elisha\r\nWright know, or ever will know, my state of mind at present. They would\r\nexult in saying ‘I told you so,’ and be convinced it was the beginning\r\nof the end. Whereas it is just the end of the beginning.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. That sounds more Anneish. In a little while we’ll be\r\nacclimated and acquainted, and all will be well. Anne, did you notice\r\nthe girl who stood alone just outside the door of the coeds’ dressing\r\nroom all the morning—the pretty one with the brown eyes and crooked\r\nmouth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did. I noticed her particularly because she seemed the only\r\ncreature there who _looked_ as lonely and friendless as I _felt_. I had\r\n_you_, but she had no one.”\r\n\r\n“I think she felt pretty all-by-herselfish, too. Several times I saw\r\nher make a motion as if to cross over to us, but she never did it—too\r\nshy, I suppose. I wished she would come. If I hadn’t felt so much like\r\nthe aforesaid elephant I’d have gone to her. But I couldn’t lumber\r\nacross that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs. She was\r\nthe prettiest freshette I saw today, but probably favor is deceitful\r\nand even beauty is vain on your first day at Redmond,” concluded\r\nPriscilla with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“I’m going across to Old St. John’s after lunch,” said Anne. “I don’t\r\nknow that a graveyard is a very good place to go to get cheered up, but\r\nit seems the only get-at-able place where there are trees, and trees I\r\nmust have. I’ll sit on one of those old slabs and shut my eyes and\r\nimagine I’m in the Avonlea woods.”\r\n\r\nAnne did not do that, however, for she found enough of interest in Old\r\nSt. John’s to keep her eyes wide open. They went in by the entrance\r\ngates, past the simple, massive, stone arch surmounted by the great\r\nlion of England.\r\n\r\n“‘And on Inkerman yet the wild bramble is gory,\r\nAnd those bleak heights henceforth shall be famous in story,’”\r\n\r\n\r\nquoted Anne, looking at it with a thrill. They found themselves in a\r\ndim, cool, green place where winds were fond of purring. Up and down\r\nthe long grassy aisles they wandered, reading the quaint, voluminous\r\nepitaphs, carved in an age that had more leisure than our own.\r\n\r\n“‘Here lieth the body of Albert Crawford, Esq.,’” read Anne from a\r\nworn, gray slab, “‘for many years Keeper of His Majesty’s Ordnance at\r\nKingsport. He served in the army till the peace of 1763, when he\r\nretired from bad health. He was a brave officer, the best of husbands,\r\nthe best of fathers, the best of friends. He died October 29th, 1792,\r\naged 84 years.’ There’s an epitaph for you, Prissy. There is certainly\r\nsome ‘scope for imagination’ in it. How full such a life must have been\r\nof adventure! And as for his personal qualities, I’m sure human eulogy\r\ncouldn’t go further. I wonder if they told him he was all those best\r\nthings while he was alive.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s another,” said Priscilla. “Listen—\r\n\r\n‘To the memory of Alexander Ross, who died on the 22nd of September,\r\n1840, aged 43 years. This is raised as a tribute of affection by one\r\nwhom he served so faithfully for 27 years that he was regarded as a\r\nfriend, deserving the fullest confidence and attachment.’”\r\n\r\n“A very good epitaph,” commented Anne thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t wish a\r\nbetter. We are all servants of some sort, and if the fact that we are\r\nfaithful can be truthfully inscribed on our tombstones nothing more\r\nneed be added. Here’s a sorrowful little gray stone, Prissy—‘to the\r\nmemory of a favorite child.’ And here is another ‘erected to the memory\r\nof one who is buried elsewhere.’ I wonder where that unknown grave is.\r\nReally, Pris, the graveyards of today will never be as interesting as\r\nthis. You were right—I shall come here often. I love it already. I see\r\nwe’re not alone here—there’s a girl down at the end of this avenue.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I believe it’s the very girl we saw at Redmond this morning.\r\nI’ve been watching her for five minutes. She has started to come up the\r\navenue exactly half a dozen times, and half a dozen times has she\r\nturned and gone back. Either she’s dreadfully shy or she has got\r\nsomething on her conscience. Let’s go and meet her. It’s easier to get\r\nacquainted in a graveyard than at Redmond, I believe.”\r\n\r\nThey walked down the long grassy arcade towards the stranger, who was\r\nsitting on a gray slab under an enormous willow. She was certainly very\r\npretty, with a vivid, irregular, bewitching type of prettiness. There\r\nwas a gloss as of brown nuts on her satin-smooth hair and a soft, ripe\r\nglow on her round cheeks. Her eyes were big and brown and velvety,\r\nunder oddly-pointed black brows, and her crooked mouth was rose-red.\r\nShe wore a smart brown suit, with two very modish little shoes peeping\r\nfrom beneath it; and her hat of dull pink straw, wreathed with\r\ngolden-brown poppies, had the indefinable, unmistakable air which\r\npertains to the “creation” of an artist in millinery. Priscilla had a\r\nsudden stinging consciousness that her own hat had been trimmed by her\r\nvillage store milliner, and Anne wondered uncomfortably if the blouse\r\nshe had made herself, and which Mrs. Lynde had fitted, looked _very_\r\ncountrified and home-made besides the stranger’s smart attire. For a\r\nmoment both girls felt like turning back.\r\n\r\nBut they had already stopped and turned towards the gray slab. It was\r\ntoo late to retreat, for the brown-eyed girl had evidently concluded\r\nthat they were coming to speak to her. Instantly she sprang up and came\r\nforward with outstretched hand and a gay, friendly smile in which there\r\nseemed not a shadow of either shyness or burdened conscience.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I want to know who you two girls are,” she exclaimed eagerly.\r\n“I’ve been _dying_ to know. I saw you at Redmond this morning. Say,\r\nwasn’t it _awful_ there? For the time I wished I had stayed home and\r\ngot married.”\r\n\r\nAnne and Priscilla both broke into unconstrained laughter at this\r\nunexpected conclusion. The brown-eyed girl laughed, too.\r\n\r\n“I really did. I _could_ have, you know. Come, let’s all sit down on\r\nthis gravestone and get acquainted. It won’t be hard. I know we’re\r\ngoing to adore each other—I knew it as soon as I saw you at Redmond\r\nthis morning. I wanted so much to go right over and hug you both.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you?” asked Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“Because I simply couldn’t make up my mind to do it. I never can make\r\nup my mind about anything myself—I’m always afflicted with indecision.\r\nJust as soon as I decide to do something I feel in my bones that\r\nanother course would be the correct one. It’s a dreadful misfortune,\r\nbut I was born that way, and there is no use in blaming me for it, as\r\nsome people do. So I couldn’t make up my mind to go and speak to you,\r\nmuch as I wanted to.”\r\n\r\n“We thought you were too shy,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“No, no, dear. Shyness isn’t among the many failings—or virtues—of\r\nPhilippa Gordon—Phil for short. Do call me Phil right off. Now, what\r\nare your handles?”\r\n\r\n“She’s Priscilla Grant,” said Anne, pointing.\r\n\r\n“And _she’s_ Anne Shirley,” said Priscilla, pointing in turn.\r\n\r\n“And we’re from the Island,” said both together.\r\n\r\n“I hail from Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia,” said Philippa.\r\n\r\n“Bolingbroke!” exclaimed Anne. “Why, that is where I was born.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean it? Why, that makes you a Bluenose after all.”\r\n\r\n“No, it doesn’t,” retorted Anne. “Wasn’t it Dan O’Connell who said that\r\nif a man was born in a stable it didn’t make him a horse? I’m Island to\r\nthe core.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m glad you were born in Bolingbroke anyway. It makes us kind\r\nof neighbors, doesn’t it? And I like that, because when I tell you\r\nsecrets it won’t be as if I were telling them to a stranger. I have to\r\ntell them. I can’t keep secrets—it’s no use to try. That’s my worst\r\nfailing—that, and indecision, as aforesaid. Would you believe it?—it\r\ntook me half an hour to decide which hat to wear when I was coming\r\nhere—_here_, to a graveyard! At first I inclined to my brown one with\r\nthe feather; but as soon as I put it on I thought this pink one with\r\nthe floppy brim would be more becoming. When I got _it_ pinned in place\r\nI liked the brown one better. At last I put them close together on the\r\nbed, shut my eyes, and jabbed with a hat pin. The pin speared the pink\r\none, so I put it on. It is becoming, isn’t it? Tell me, what do you\r\nthink of my looks?”\r\n\r\nAt this naive demand, made in a perfectly serious tone, Priscilla\r\nlaughed again. But Anne said, impulsively squeezing Philippa’s hand,\r\n\r\n“We thought this morning that you were the prettiest girl we saw at\r\nRedmond.”\r\n\r\nPhilippa’s crooked mouth flashed into a bewitching, crooked smile over\r\nvery white little teeth.\r\n\r\n“I thought that myself,” was her next astounding statement, “but I\r\nwanted some one else’s opinion to bolster mine up. I can’t decide even\r\non my own appearance. Just as soon as I’ve decided that I’m pretty I\r\nbegin to feel miserably that I’m not. Besides, have a horrible old\r\ngreat-aunt who is always saying to me, with a mournful sigh, ‘You were\r\nsuch a pretty baby. It’s strange how children change when they grow\r\nup.’ I adore aunts, but I detest great-aunts. Please tell me quite\r\noften that I am pretty, if you don’t mind. I feel so much more\r\ncomfortable when I can believe I’m pretty. And I’ll be just as obliging\r\nto you if you want me to—I _can_ be, with a clear conscience.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” laughed Anne, “but Priscilla and I are so firmly convinced of\r\nour own good looks that we don’t need any assurance about them, so you\r\nneedn’t trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re laughing at me. I know you think I’m abominably vain, but\r\nI’m not. There really isn’t one spark of vanity in me. And I’m never a\r\nbit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve\r\nthem. I’m so glad I know you folks. I came up on Saturday and I’ve\r\nnearly died of homesickness ever since. It’s a horrible feeling, isn’t\r\nit? In Bolingbroke I’m an important personage, and in Kingsport I’m\r\njust nobody! There were times when I could feel my soul turning a\r\ndelicate blue. Where do you hang out?”\r\n\r\n“Thirty-eight St. John’s Street.”\r\n\r\n“Better and better. Why, I’m just around the corner on Wallace Street.\r\nI don’t like my boardinghouse, though. It’s bleak and lonesome, and my\r\nroom looks out on such an unholy back yard. It’s the ugliest place in\r\nthe world. As for cats—well, surely _all_ the Kingsport cats can’t\r\ncongregate there at night, but half of them must. I adore cats on\r\nhearth rugs, snoozing before nice, friendly fires, but cats in back\r\nyards at midnight are totally different animals. The first night I was\r\nhere I cried all night, and so did the cats. You should have seen my\r\nnose in the morning. How I wished I had never left home!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how you managed to make up your mind to come to Redmond\r\nat all, if you are really such an undecided person,” said amused\r\nPriscilla.\r\n\r\n“Bless your heart, honey, I didn’t. It was father who wanted me to come\r\nhere. His heart was set on it—why, I don’t know. It seems perfectly\r\nridiculous to think of me studying for a B.A. degree, doesn’t it? Not\r\nbut what I can do it, all right. I have heaps of brains.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Priscilla vaguely.\r\n\r\n“Yes. But it’s such hard work to use them. And B.A.’s are such learned,\r\ndignified, wise, solemn creatures—they must be. No, _I_ didn’t want to\r\ncome to Redmond. I did it just to oblige father. He _is_ such a duck.\r\nBesides, I knew if I stayed home I’d have to get married. Mother wanted\r\nthat—wanted it decidedly. Mother has plenty of decision. But I really\r\nhated the thought of being married for a few years yet. I want to have\r\nheaps of fun before I settle down. And, ridiculous as the idea of my\r\nbeing a B.A. is, the idea of my being an old married woman is still\r\nmore absurd, isn’t it? I’m only eighteen. No, I concluded I would\r\nrather come to Redmond than be married. Besides, how could I ever have\r\nmade up my mind which man to marry?”\r\n\r\n“Were there so many?” laughed Anne.\r\n\r\n“Heaps. The boys like me awfully—they really do. But there were only\r\ntwo that mattered. The rest were all too young and too poor. I must\r\nmarry a rich man, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Why must you?”\r\n\r\n“Honey, you couldn’t imagine _me_ being a poor man’s wife, could you? I\r\ncan’t do a single useful thing, and I am _very_ extravagant. Oh, no, my\r\nhusband must have heaps of money. So that narrowed them down to two.\r\nBut I couldn’t decide between two any easier than between two hundred.\r\nI knew perfectly well that whichever one I chose I’d regret all my life\r\nthat I hadn’t married the other.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you—love—either of them?” asked Anne, a little hesitatingly. It\r\nwas not easy for her to speak to a stranger of the great mystery and\r\ntransformation of life.\r\n\r\n“Goodness, no. _I_ couldn’t love anybody. It isn’t in me. Besides I\r\nwouldn’t want to. Being in love makes you a perfect slave, _I_ think.\r\nAnd it would give a man such power to hurt you. I’d be afraid. No, no,\r\nAlec and Alonzo are two dear boys, and I like them both so much that I\r\nreally don’t know which I like the better. That is the trouble. Alec is\r\nthe best looking, of course, and I simply couldn’t marry a man who\r\nwasn’t handsome. He is good-tempered too, and has lovely, curly, black\r\nhair. He’s rather too perfect—I don’t believe I’d like a perfect\r\nhusband—somebody I could never find fault with.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not marry Alonzo?” asked Priscilla gravely.\r\n\r\n“Think of marrying a name like Alonzo!” said Phil dolefully. “I don’t\r\nbelieve I could endure it. But he has a classic nose, and it _would_ be\r\na comfort to have a nose in the family that could be depended on. I\r\ncan’t depend on mine. So far, it takes after the Gordon pattern, but\r\nI’m so afraid it will develop Byrne tendencies as I grow older. I\r\nexamine it every day anxiously to make sure it’s still Gordon. Mother\r\nwas a Byrne and has the Byrne nose in the Byrnest degree. Wait till you\r\nsee it. I adore nice noses. Your nose is awfully nice, Anne Shirley.\r\nAlonzo’s nose nearly turned the balance in his favor. But _Alonzo!_ No,\r\nI couldn’t decide. If I could have done as I did with the hats—stood\r\nthem both up together, shut my eyes, and jabbed with a hatpin—it would\r\nhave been quite easy.”\r\n\r\n“What did Alec and Alonzo feel like when you came away?” queried\r\nPriscilla.\r\n\r\n“Oh, they still have hope. I told them they’d have to wait till I could\r\nmake up my mind. They’re quite willing to wait. They both worship me,\r\nyou know. Meanwhile, I intend to have a good time. I expect I shall\r\nhave heaps of beaux at Redmond. I can’t be happy unless I have, you\r\nknow. But don’t you think the freshmen are fearfully homely? I saw only\r\none really handsome fellow among them. He went away before you came. I\r\nheard his chum call him Gilbert. His chum had eyes that stuck out _that\r\nfar_. But you’re not going yet, girls? Don’t go yet.”\r\n\r\n“I think we must,” said Anne, rather coldly. “It’s getting late, and\r\nI’ve some work to do.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll both come to see me, won’t you?” asked Philippa, getting up\r\nand putting an arm around each. “And let me come to see you. I want to\r\nbe chummy with you. I’ve taken such a fancy to you both. And I haven’t\r\nquite disgusted you with my frivolity, have I?”\r\n\r\n“Not quite,” laughed Anne, responding to Phil’s squeeze, with a return\r\nof cordiality.\r\n\r\n“Because I’m not half so silly as I seem on the surface, you know. You\r\njust accept Philippa Gordon, as the Lord made her, with all her faults,\r\nand I believe you’ll come to like her. Isn’t this graveyard a sweet\r\nplace? I’d love to be buried here. Here’s a grave I didn’t see\r\nbefore—this one in the iron railing—oh, girls, look, see—the stone says\r\nit’s the grave of a middy who was killed in the fight between the\r\nShannon and the Chesapeake. Just fancy!”\r\n\r\nAnne paused by the railing and looked at the worn stone, her pulses\r\nthrilling with sudden excitement. The old graveyard, with its\r\nover-arching trees and long aisles of shadows, faded from her sight.\r\nInstead, she saw the Kingsport Harbor of nearly a century agone. Out of\r\nthe mist came slowly a great frigate, brilliant with “the meteor flag\r\nof England.” Behind her was another, with a still, heroic form, wrapped\r\nin his own starry flag, lying on the quarter deck—the gallant Lawrence.\r\nTime’s finger had turned back his pages, and that was the Shannon\r\nsailing triumphant up the bay with the Chesapeake as her prize.\r\n\r\n“Come back, Anne Shirley—come back,” laughed Philippa, pulling her arm.\r\n“You’re a hundred years away from us. Come back.”\r\n\r\nAnne came back with a sigh; her eyes were shining softly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always loved that old story,” she said, “and although the English\r\nwon that victory, I think it was because of the brave, defeated\r\ncommander I love it. This grave seems to bring it so near and make it\r\nso real. This poor little middy was only eighteen. He ‘died of\r\ndesperate wounds received in gallant action’—so reads his epitaph. It\r\nis such as a soldier might wish for.”\r\n\r\nBefore she turned away, Anne unpinned the little cluster of purple\r\npansies she wore and dropped it softly on the grave of the boy who had\r\nperished in the great sea-duel.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of our new friend?” asked Priscilla, when Phil\r\nhad left them.\r\n\r\n“I like her. There is something very lovable about her, in spite of all\r\nher nonsense. I believe, as she says herself, that she isn’t half as\r\nsilly as she sounds. She’s a dear, kissable baby—and I don’t know that\r\nshe’ll ever really grow up.”\r\n\r\n“I like her, too,” said Priscilla, decidedly. “She talks as much about\r\nboys as Ruby Gillis does. But it always enrages or sickens me to hear\r\nRuby, whereas I just wanted to laugh good-naturedly at Phil. Now, what\r\nis the why of that?”\r\n\r\n“There is a difference,” said Anne meditatively. “I think it’s because\r\nRuby is really so _conscious_ of boys. She plays at love and\r\nlove-making. Besides, you feel, when she is boasting of her beaux that\r\nshe is doing it to rub it well into you that you haven’t half so many.\r\nNow, when Phil talks of her beaux it sounds as if she was just speaking\r\nof chums. She really looks upon boys as good comrades, and she is\r\npleased when she has dozens of them tagging round, simply because she\r\nlikes to be popular and to be thought popular. Even Alex and\r\nAlonzo—I’ll never be able to think of those two names separately after\r\nthis—are to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all\r\ntheir lives. I’m glad we met her, and I’m glad we went to Old St.\r\nJohn’s. I believe I’ve put forth a tiny soul-root into Kingsport soil\r\nthis afternoon. I hope so. I hate to feel transplanted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\nLetters from Home\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next three weeks Anne and Priscilla continued to feel as\r\nstrangers in a strange land. Then, suddenly, everything seemed to fall\r\ninto focus—Redmond, professors, classes, students, studies, social\r\ndoings. Life became homogeneous again, instead of being made up of\r\ndetached fragments. The Freshmen, instead of being a collection of\r\nunrelated individuals, found themselves a class, with a class spirit, a\r\nclass yell, class interests, class antipathies and class ambitions.\r\nThey won the day in the annual “Arts Rush” against the Sophomores, and\r\nthereby gained the respect of all the classes, and an enormous,\r\nconfidence-giving opinion of themselves. For three years the Sophomores\r\nhad won in the “rush”; that the victory of this year perched upon the\r\nFreshmen’s banner was attributed to the strategic generalship of\r\nGilbert Blythe, who marshalled the campaign and originated certain new\r\ntactics, which demoralized the Sophs and swept the Freshmen to triumph.\r\nAs a reward of merit he was elected president of the Freshman Class, a\r\nposition of honor and responsibility—from a Fresh point of view, at\r\nleast—coveted by many. He was also invited to join the\r\n“Lambs”—Redmondese for Lamba Theta—a compliment rarely paid to a\r\nFreshman. As a preparatory initiation ordeal he had to parade the\r\nprincipal business streets of Kingsport for a whole day wearing a\r\nsunbonnet and a voluminous kitchen apron of gaudily flowered calico.\r\nThis he did cheerfully, doffing his sunbonnet with courtly grace when\r\nhe met ladies of his acquaintance. Charlie Sloane, who had not been\r\nasked to join the Lambs, told Anne he did not see how Blythe could do\r\nit, and _he_, for his part, could never humiliate himself so.\r\n\r\n“Fancy Charlie Sloane in a ‘caliker’ apron and a ‘sunbunnit,’” giggled\r\nPriscilla. “He’d look exactly like his old Grandmother Sloane. Gilbert,\r\nnow, looked as much like a man in them as in his own proper\r\nhabiliments.”\r\n\r\nAnne and Priscilla found themselves in the thick of the social life of\r\nRedmond. That this came about so speedily was due in great measure to\r\nPhilippa Gordon. Philippa was the daughter of a rich and well-known\r\nman, and belonged to an old and exclusive “Bluenose” family. This,\r\ncombined with her beauty and charm—a charm acknowledged by all who met\r\nher—promptly opened the gates of all cliques, clubs and classes in\r\nRedmond to her; and where she went Anne and Priscilla went, too. Phil\r\n“adored” Anne and Priscilla, especially Anne. She was a loyal little\r\nsoul, crystal-free from any form of snobbishness. “Love me, love my\r\nfriends” seemed to be her unconscious motto. Without effort, she took\r\nthem with her into her ever widening circle of acquaintanceship, and\r\nthe two Avonlea girls found their social pathway at Redmond made very\r\neasy and pleasant for them, to the envy and wonderment of the other\r\nfreshettes, who, lacking Philippa’s sponsorship, were doomed to remain\r\nrather on the fringe of things during their first college year.\r\n\r\nTo Anne and Priscilla, with their more serious views of life, Phil\r\nremained the amusing, lovable baby she had seemed on their first\r\nmeeting. Yet, as she said herself, she had “heaps” of brains. When or\r\nwhere she found time to study was a mystery, for she seemed always in\r\ndemand for some kind of “fun,” and her home evenings were crowded with\r\ncallers. She had all the “beaux” that heart could desire, for\r\nnine-tenths of the Freshmen and a big fraction of all the other classes\r\nwere rivals for her smiles. She was naively delighted over this, and\r\ngleefully recounted each new conquest to Anne and Priscilla, with\r\ncomments that might have made the unlucky lover’s ears burn fiercely.\r\n\r\n“Alec and Alonzo don’t seem to have any serious rival yet,” remarked\r\nAnne, teasingly.\r\n\r\n“Not one,” agreed Philippa. “I write them both every week and tell them\r\nall about my young men here. I’m sure it must amuse them. But, of\r\ncourse, the one I like best I can’t get. Gilbert Blythe won’t take any\r\nnotice of me, except to look at me as if I were a nice little kitten\r\nhe’d like to pat. Too well I know the reason. I owe you a grudge, Queen\r\nAnne. I really ought to hate you and instead I love you madly, and I’m\r\nmiserable if I don’t see you every day. You’re different from any girl\r\nI ever knew before. When you look at me in a certain way I feel what an\r\ninsignificant, frivolous little beast I am, and I long to be better and\r\nwiser and stronger. And then I make good resolutions; but the first\r\nnice-looking mannie who comes my way knocks them all out of my head.\r\nIsn’t college life magnificent? It’s so funny to think I hated it that\r\nfirst day. But if I hadn’t I might never got really acquainted with\r\nyou. Anne, please tell me over again that you like me a little bit. I\r\nyearn to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“I like you a big bit—and I think you’re a dear, sweet, adorable,\r\nvelvety, clawless, little—kitten,” laughed Anne, “but I don’t see when\r\nyou ever get time to learn your lessons.”\r\n\r\nPhil must have found time for she held her own in every class of her\r\nyear. Even the grumpy old professor of Mathematics, who detested coeds,\r\nand had bitterly opposed their admission to Redmond, couldn’t floor\r\nher. She led the freshettes everywhere, except in English, where Anne\r\nShirley left her far behind. Anne herself found the studies of her\r\nFreshman year very easy, thanks in great part to the steady work she\r\nand Gilbert had put in during those two past years in Avonlea. This\r\nleft her more time for a social life which she thoroughly enjoyed. But\r\nnever for a moment did she forget Avonlea and the friends there. To\r\nher, the happiest moments in each week were those in which letters came\r\nfrom home. It was not until she had got her first letters that she\r\nbegan to think she could ever like Kingsport or feel at home there.\r\nBefore they came, Avonlea had seemed thousands of miles away; those\r\nletters brought it near and linked the old life to the new so closely\r\nthat they began to seem one and the same, instead of two hopelessly\r\nsegregated existences. The first batch contained six letters, from Jane\r\nAndrews, Ruby Gillis, Diana Barry, Marilla, Mrs. Lynde and Davy. Jane’s\r\nwas a copperplate production, with every “t” nicely crossed and every\r\n“i” precisely dotted, and not an interesting sentence in it. She never\r\nmentioned the school, concerning which Anne was avid to hear; she never\r\nanswered one of the questions Anne had asked in her letter. But she\r\ntold Anne how many yards of lace she had recently crocheted, and the\r\nkind of weather they were having in Avonlea, and how she intended to\r\nhave her new dress made, and the way she felt when her head ached. Ruby\r\nGillis wrote a gushing epistle deploring Anne’s absence, assuring her\r\nshe was horribly missed in everything, asking what the Redmond\r\n“fellows” were like, and filling the rest with accounts of her own\r\nharrowing experiences with her numerous admirers. It was a silly,\r\nharmless letter, and Anne would have laughed over it had it not been\r\nfor the postscript. “Gilbert seems to be enjoying Redmond, judging from\r\nhis letters,” wrote Ruby. “I don’t think Charlie is so stuck on it.”\r\n\r\nSo Gilbert was writing to Ruby! Very well. He had a perfect right to,\r\nof course. Only—!! Anne did not know that Ruby had written the first\r\nletter and that Gilbert had answered it from mere courtesy. She tossed\r\nRuby’s letter aside contemptuously. But it took all Diana’s breezy,\r\nnewsy, delightful epistle to banish the sting of Ruby’s postscript.\r\nDiana’s letter contained a little too much Fred, but was otherwise\r\ncrowded and crossed with items of interest, and Anne almost felt\r\nherself back in Avonlea while reading it. Marilla’s was a rather prim\r\nand colorless epistle, severely innocent of gossip or emotion. Yet\r\nsomehow it conveyed to Anne a whiff of the wholesome, simple life at\r\nGreen Gables, with its savor of ancient peace, and the steadfast\r\nabiding love that was there for her. Mrs. Lynde’s letter was full of\r\nchurch news. Having broken up housekeeping, Mrs. Lynde had more time\r\nthan ever to devote to church affairs and had flung herself into them\r\nheart and soul. She was at present much worked up over the poor\r\n“supplies” they were having in the vacant Avonlea pulpit.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe any but fools enter the ministry nowadays,” she wrote\r\nbitterly. “Such candidates as they have sent us, and such stuff as they\r\npreach! Half of it ain’t true, and, what’s worse, it ain’t sound\r\ndoctrine. The one we have now is the worst of the lot. He mostly takes\r\na text and preaches about something else. And he says he doesn’t\r\nbelieve all the heathen will be eternally lost. The idea! If they won’t\r\nall the money we’ve been giving to Foreign Missions will be clean\r\nwasted, that’s what! Last Sunday night he announced that next Sunday\r\nhe’d preach on the axe-head that swam. I think he’d better confine\r\nhimself to the Bible and leave sensational subjects alone. Things have\r\ncome to a pretty pass if a minister can’t find enough in Holy Writ to\r\npreach about, that’s what. What church do you attend, Anne? I hope you\r\ngo regularly. People are apt to get so careless about church-going away\r\nfrom home, and I understand college students are great sinners in this\r\nrespect. I’m told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday.\r\nI hope you’ll never sink that low, Anne. Remember how you were brought\r\nup. And be very careful what friends you make. You never know what sort\r\nof creatures are in them colleges. Outwardly they may be as whited\r\nsepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves, that’s what. You’d better\r\nnot have anything to say to any young man who isn’t from the Island.\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you what happened the day the minister called here.\r\nIt was the funniest thing I ever saw. I said to Marilla, ‘If Anne had\r\nbeen here wouldn’t she have had a laugh?’ Even Marilla laughed. You\r\nknow he’s a very short, fat little man with bow legs. Well, that old\r\npig of Mr. Harrison’s—the big, tall one—had wandered over here that day\r\nagain and broke into the yard, and it got into the back porch,\r\nunbeknowns to us, and it was there when the minister appeared in the\r\ndoorway. It made one wild bolt to get out, but there was nowhere to\r\nbolt to except between them bow legs. So there it went, and, being as\r\nit was so big and the minister so little, it took him clean off his\r\nfeet and carried him away. His hat went one way and his cane another,\r\njust as Marilla and I got to the door. I’ll never forget the look of\r\nhim. And that poor pig was near scared to death. I’ll never be able to\r\nread that account in the Bible of the swine that rushed madly down the\r\nsteep place into the sea without seeing Mr. Harrison’s pig careering\r\ndown the hill with that minister. I guess the pig thought he had the\r\nOld Boy on his back instead of inside of him. I was thankful the twins\r\nweren’t about. It wouldn’t have been the right thing for them to have\r\nseen a minister in such an undignified predicament. Just before they\r\ngot to the brook the minister jumped off or fell off. The pig rushed\r\nthrough the brook like mad and up through the woods. Marilla and I run\r\ndown and helped the minister get up and brush his coat. He wasn’t hurt,\r\nbut he was mad. He seemed to hold Marilla and me responsible for it\r\nall, though we told him the pig didn’t belong to us, and had been\r\npestering us all summer. Besides, what did he come to the back door\r\nfor? You’d never have caught Mr. Allan doing that. It’ll be a long time\r\nbefore we get a man like Mr. Allan. But it’s an ill wind that blows no\r\ngood. We’ve never seen hoof or hair of that pig since, and it’s my\r\nbelief we never will.\r\n\r\n“Things is pretty quiet in Avonlea. I don’t find Green Gables as\r\nlonesome as I expected. I think I’ll start another cotton warp quilt\r\nthis winter. Mrs. Silas Sloane has a handsome new apple-leaf pattern.\r\n\r\n“When I feel that I must have some excitement I read the murder trials\r\nin that Boston paper my niece sends me. I never used to do it, but\r\nthey’re real interesting. The States must be an awful place. I hope\r\nyou’ll never go there, Anne. But the way girls roam over the earth now\r\nis something terrible. It always makes me think of Satan in the Book of\r\nJob, going to and fro and walking up and down. I don’t believe the Lord\r\never intended it, that’s what.\r\n\r\n“Davy has been pretty good since you went away. One day he was bad and\r\nMarilla punished him by making him wear Dora’s apron all day, and then\r\nhe went and cut all Dora’s aprons up. I spanked him for that and then\r\nhe went and chased my rooster to death.\r\n\r\n“The MacPhersons have moved down to my place. She’s a great housekeeper\r\nand very particular. She’s rooted all my June lilies up because she\r\nsays they make a garden look so untidy. Thomas set them lilies out when\r\nwe were married. Her husband seems a nice sort of a man, but she can’t\r\nget over being an old maid, that’s what.\r\n\r\n“Don’t study too hard, and be sure and put your winter underclothes on\r\nas soon as the weather gets cool. Marilla worries a lot about you, but\r\nI tell her you’ve got a lot more sense than I ever thought you would\r\nhave at one time, and that you’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\nDavy’s letter plunged into a grievance at the start.\r\n\r\n“Dear anne, please write and tell marilla not to tie me to the rale of\r\nthe bridge when I go fishing the boys make fun of me when she does. Its\r\nawful lonesome here without you but grate fun in school. Jane andrews\r\nis crosser than you. I scared mrs. lynde with a jacky lantern last\r\nnite. She was offel mad and she was mad cause I chased her old rooster\r\nround the yard till he fell down ded. I didn’t mean to make him fall\r\ndown ded. What made him die, anne, I want to know. mrs. lynde threw him\r\ninto the pig pen she mite of sold him to mr. blair. mr. blair is giving\r\n50 sense apeace for good ded roosters now. I herd mrs. lynde asking the\r\nminister to pray for her. What did she do that was so bad, anne, I want\r\nto know. I’ve got a kite with a magnificent tail, anne. Milty bolter\r\ntold me a grate story in school yesterday. it is troo. old Joe Mosey\r\nand Leon were playing cards one nite last week in the woods. The cards\r\nwere on a stump and a big black man bigger than the trees come along\r\nand grabbed the cards and the stump and disapered with a noys like\r\nthunder. Ill bet they were skared. Milty says the black man was the old\r\nharry. was he, anne, I want to know. Mr. kimball over at spenservale is\r\nvery sick and will have to go to the hospitable. please excuse me while\r\nI ask marilla if thats spelled rite. Marilla says its the silem he has\r\nto go to not the other place. He thinks he has a snake inside of him.\r\nwhats it like to have a snake inside of you, anne. I want to know. mrs.\r\nlawrence bell is sick to. mrs. lynde says that all that is the matter\r\nwith her is that she thinks too much about her insides.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” said Anne, as she folded up her letters, “what Mrs. Lynde\r\nwould think of Philippa.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\nIn the Park\r\n\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with yourselves today, girls?” asked\r\nPhilippa, popping into Anne’s room one Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\n“We are going for a walk in the park,” answered Anne. “I ought to stay\r\nin and finish my blouse. But I couldn’t sew on a day like this. There’s\r\nsomething in the air that gets into my blood and makes a sort of glory\r\nin my soul. My fingers would twitch and I’d sew a crooked seam. So it’s\r\nho for the park and the pines.”\r\n\r\n“Does ‘we’ include any one but yourself and Priscilla?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it includes Gilbert and Charlie, and we’ll be very glad if it\r\nwill include you, also.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Philippa dolefully, “if I go I’ll have to be gooseberry,\r\nand that will be a new experience for Philippa Gordon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, new experiences are broadening. Come along, and you’ll be able\r\nto sympathize with all poor souls who have to play gooseberry often.\r\nBut where are all the victims?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was tired of them all and simply couldn’t be bothered with any\r\nof them today. Besides, I’ve been feeling a little blue—just a pale,\r\nelusive azure. It isn’t serious enough for anything darker. I wrote\r\nAlec and Alonzo last week. I put the letters into envelopes and\r\naddressed them, but I didn’t seal them up. That evening something funny\r\nhappened. That is, Alec would think it funny, but Alonzo wouldn’t be\r\nlikely to. I was in a hurry, so I snatched Alec’s letter—as I\r\nthought—out of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript. Then I\r\nmailed both letters. I got Alonzo’s reply this morning. Girls, I had\r\nput that postscript to his letter and he was furious. Of course he’ll\r\nget over it—and I don’t care if he doesn’t—but it spoiled my day. So I\r\nthought I’d come to you darlings to get cheered up. After the football\r\nseason opens I won’t have any spare Saturday afternoons. I adore\r\nfootball. I’ve got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in Redmond\r\ncolors to wear to the games. To be sure, a little way off I’ll look\r\nlike a walking barber’s pole. Do you know that that Gilbert of yours\r\nhas been elected Captain of the Freshman football team?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he told us so last evening,” said Priscilla, seeing that outraged\r\nAnne would not answer. “He and Charlie were down. We knew they were\r\ncoming, so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all Miss\r\nAda’s cushions. That very elaborate one with the raised embroidery I\r\ndropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on. I\r\nthought it would be safe there. But would you believe it? Charlie\r\nSloane made for that chair, noticed the cushion behind it, solemnly\r\nfished it up, and sat on it the whole evening. Such a wreck of a\r\ncushion as it was! Poor Miss Ada asked me today, still smiling, but oh,\r\nso reproachfully, why I had allowed it to be sat upon. I told her I\r\nhadn’t—that it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate\r\nSloanishness and I wasn’t a match for both combined.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Ada’s cushions are really getting on my nerves,” said Anne. “She\r\nfinished two new ones last week, stuffed and embroidered within an inch\r\nof their lives. There being absolutely no other cushionless place to\r\nput them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing. They\r\ntopple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the\r\ndark we fall over them. Last Sunday, when Dr. Davis prayed for all\r\nthose exposed to the perils of the sea, I added in thought ‘and for all\r\nthose who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too\r\nwell!’ There! we’re ready, and I see the boys coming through Old St.\r\nJohn’s. Do you cast in your lot with us, Phil?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go, if I can walk with Priscilla and Charlie. That will be a\r\nbearable degree of gooseberry. That Gilbert of yours is a darling,\r\nAnne, but why does he go around so much with Goggle-eyes?”\r\n\r\nAnne stiffened. She had no great liking for Charlie Sloane; but he was\r\nof Avonlea, so no outsider had any business to laugh at him.\r\n\r\n“Charlie and Gilbert have always been friends,” she said coldly.\r\n“Charlie is a nice boy. He’s not to blame for his eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me that! He is! He must have done something dreadful in a\r\nprevious existence to be punished with such eyes. Pris and I are going\r\nto have such sport with him this afternoon. We’ll make fun of him to\r\nhis face and he’ll never know it.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless, “the abandoned P’s,” as Anne called them, did carry out\r\ntheir amiable intentions. But Sloane was blissfully ignorant; he\r\nthought he was quite a fine fellow to be walking with two such coeds,\r\nespecially Philippa Gordon, the class beauty and belle. It must surely\r\nimpress Anne. She would see that some people appreciated him at his\r\nreal value.\r\n\r\nGilbert and Anne loitered a little behind the others, enjoying the\r\ncalm, still beauty of the autumn afternoon under the pines of the park,\r\non the road that climbed and twisted round the harbor shore.\r\n\r\n“The silence here is like a prayer, isn’t it?” said Anne, her face\r\nupturned to the shining sky. “How I love the pines! They seem to strike\r\ntheir roots deep into the romance of all the ages. It is so comforting\r\nto creep away now and then for a good talk with them. I always feel so\r\nhappy out here.”\r\n\r\n“‘And so in mountain solitudes o’ertaken\r\n    As by some spell divine,\r\nTheir cares drop from them like the needles shaken\r\n    From out the gusty pine,’”\r\n\r\n\r\nquoted Gilbert.\r\n\r\n“They make our little ambitions seem rather petty, don’t they, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“I think, if ever any great sorrow came to me, I would come to the\r\npines for comfort,” said Anne dreamily.\r\n\r\n“I hope no great sorrow ever will come to you, Anne,” said Gilbert, who\r\ncould not connect the idea of sorrow with the vivid, joyous creature\r\nbeside him, unwitting that those who can soar to the highest heights\r\ncan also plunge to the deepest depths, and that the natures which enjoy\r\nmost keenly are those which also suffer most sharply.\r\n\r\n“But there must—sometime,” mused Anne. “Life seems like a cup of glory\r\nheld to my lips just now. But there must be some bitterness in it—there\r\nis in every cup. I shall taste mine some day. Well, I hope I shall be\r\nstrong and brave to meet it. And I hope it won’t be through my own\r\nfault that it will come. Do you remember what Dr. Davis said last\r\nSunday evening—that the sorrows God sent us brought comfort and\r\nstrength with them, while the sorrows we brought on ourselves, through\r\nfolly or wickedness, were by far the hardest to bear? But we mustn’t\r\ntalk of sorrow on an afternoon like this. It’s meant for the sheer joy\r\nof living, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“If I had my way I’d shut everything out of your life but happiness and\r\npleasure, Anne,” said Gilbert in the tone that meant “danger ahead.”\r\n\r\n“Then you would be very unwise,” rejoined Anne hastily. “I’m sure no\r\nlife can be properly developed and rounded out without some trial and\r\nsorrow—though I suppose it is only when we are pretty comfortable that\r\nwe admit it. Come—the others have got to the pavilion and are beckoning\r\nto us.”\r\n\r\nThey all sat down in the little pavilion to watch an autumn sunset of\r\ndeep red fire and pallid gold. To their left lay Kingsport, its roofs\r\nand spires dim in their shroud of violet smoke. To their right lay the\r\nharbor, taking on tints of rose and copper as it stretched out into the\r\nsunset. Before them the water shimmered, satin smooth and silver gray,\r\nand beyond, clean shaven William’s Island loomed out of the mist,\r\nguarding the town like a sturdy bulldog. Its lighthouse beacon flared\r\nthrough the mist like a baleful star, and was answered by another in\r\nthe far horizon.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever see such a strong-looking place?” asked Philippa. “I\r\ndon’t want William’s Island especially, but I’m sure I couldn’t get it\r\nif I did. Look at that sentry on the summit of the fort, right beside\r\nthe flag. Doesn’t he look as if he had stepped out of a romance?”\r\n\r\n“Speaking of romance,” said Priscilla, “we’ve been looking for\r\nheather—but, of course, we couldn’t find any. It’s too late in the\r\nseason, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Heather!” exclaimed Anne. “Heather doesn’t grow in America, does it?”\r\n\r\n“There are just two patches of it in the whole continent,” said Phil,\r\n“one right here in the park, and one somewhere else in Nova Scotia, I\r\nforget where. The famous Highland Regiment, the Black Watch, camped\r\nhere one year, and, when the men shook out the straw of their beds in\r\nthe spring, some seeds of heather took root.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how delightful!” said enchanted Anne.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go home around by Spofford Avenue,” suggested Gilbert. “We can\r\nsee all ‘the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell.’ Spofford\r\nAvenue is the finest residential street in Kingsport. Nobody can build\r\non it unless he’s a millionaire.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do,” said Phil. “There’s a perfectly killing little place I want\r\nto show you, Anne. _it_ wasn’t built by a millionaire. It’s the first\r\nplace after you leave the park, and must have grown while Spofford\r\nAvenue was still a country road. It _did_ grow—it wasn’t built! I don’t\r\ncare for the houses on the Avenue. They’re too brand new and\r\nplateglassy. But this little spot is a dream—and its name—but wait till\r\nyou see it.”\r\n\r\nThey saw it as they walked up the pine-fringed hill from the park. Just\r\non the crest, where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road, was\r\na little white frame house with groups of pines on either side of it,\r\nstretching their arms protectingly over its low roof. It was covered\r\nwith red and gold vines, through which its green-shuttered windows\r\npeeped. Before it was a tiny garden, surrounded by a low stone wall.\r\nOctober though it was, the garden was still very sweet with dear,\r\nold-fashioned, unworldly flowers and shrubs—sweet may, southern-wood,\r\nlemon verbena, alyssum, petunias, marigolds and chrysanthemums. A tiny\r\nbrick wall, in herring-bone pattern, led from the gate to the front\r\nporch. The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote\r\ncountry village; yet there was something about it that made its nearest\r\nneighbor, the big lawn-encircled palace of a tobacco king, look\r\nexceedingly crude and showy and ill-bred by contrast. As Phil said, it\r\nwas the difference between being born and being made.\r\n\r\n“It’s the dearest place I ever saw,” said Anne delightedly. “It gives\r\nme one of my old, delightful funny aches. It’s dearer and quainter than\r\neven Miss Lavendar’s stone house.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the name I want you to notice especially,” said Phil. “Look—in\r\nwhite letters, around the archway over the gate. ‘Patty’s Place.’ Isn’t\r\nthat killing? Especially on this Avenue of Pinehursts and Elmwolds and\r\nCedarcrofts? ‘Patty’s Place,’ if you please! I adore it.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any idea who Patty is?” asked Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“Patty Spofford is the name of the old lady who owns it, I’ve\r\ndiscovered. She lives there with her niece, and they’ve lived there for\r\nhundreds of years, more or less—maybe a little less, Anne. Exaggeration\r\nis merely a flight of poetic fancy. I understand that wealthy folk have\r\ntried to buy the lot time and again—it’s really worth a small fortune\r\nnow, you know—but ‘Patty’ won’t sell upon any consideration. And\r\nthere’s an apple orchard behind the house in place of a back\r\nyard—you’ll see it when we get a little past—a real apple orchard on\r\nSpofford Avenue!”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to dream about ‘Patty’s Place’ tonight,” said Anne. “Why, I\r\nfeel as if I belonged to it. I wonder if, by any chance, we’ll ever see\r\nthe inside of it.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t likely,” said Priscilla.\r\n\r\nAnne smiled mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t likely. But I believe it will happen. I have a queer,\r\ncreepy, crawly feeling—you can call it a presentiment, if you like—that\r\n‘Patty’s Place’ and I are going to be better acquainted yet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\nHome Again\r\n\r\n\r\nThose first three weeks at Redmond had seemed long; but the rest of the\r\nterm flew by on wings of wind. Before they realized it the Redmond\r\nstudents found themselves in the grind of Christmas examinations,\r\nemerging therefrom more or less triumphantly. The honor of leading in\r\nthe Freshman classes fluctuated between Anne, Gilbert and Philippa;\r\nPriscilla did very well; Charlie Sloane scraped through respectably,\r\nand comported himself as complacently as if he had led in everything.\r\n\r\n“I can’t really believe that this time tomorrow I’ll be in Green\r\nGables,” said Anne on the night before departure. “But I shall be. And\r\nyou, Phil, will be in Bolingbroke with Alec and Alonzo.”\r\n\r\n“I’m longing to see them,” admitted Phil, between the chocolate she was\r\nnibbling. “They really are such dear boys, you know. There’s to be no\r\nend of dances and drives and general jamborees. I shall never forgive\r\nyou, Queen Anne, for not coming home with me for the holidays.”\r\n\r\n“‘Never’ means three days with you, Phil. It was dear of you to ask\r\nme—and I’d love to go to Bolingbroke some day. But I can’t go this\r\nyear—I _must_ go home. You don’t know how my heart longs for it.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t have much of a time,” said Phil scornfully. “There’ll be one\r\nor two quilting parties, I suppose; and all the old gossips will talk\r\nyou over to your face and behind your back. You’ll die of lonesomeness,\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“In Avonlea?” said Anne, highly amused.\r\n\r\n“Now, if you’d come with me you’d have a perfectly gorgeous time.\r\nBolingbroke would go wild over you, Queen Anne—your hair and your style\r\nand, oh, everything! You’re so _different_. You’d be such a success—and\r\nI would bask in reflected glory—‘not the rose but near the rose.’ Do\r\ncome, after all, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Your picture of social triumphs is quite fascinating, Phil, but I’ll\r\npaint one to offset it. I’m going home to an old country farmhouse,\r\nonce green, rather faded now, set among leafless apple orchards. There\r\nis a brook below and a December fir wood beyond, where I’ve heard harps\r\nswept by the fingers of rain and wind. There is a pond nearby that will\r\nbe gray and brooding now. There will be two oldish ladies in the house,\r\none tall and thin, one short and fat; and there will be two twins, one\r\na perfect model, the other what Mrs. Lynde calls a ‘holy terror.’ There\r\nwill be a little room upstairs over the porch, where old dreams hang\r\nthick, and a big, fat, glorious feather bed which will almost seem the\r\nheight of luxury after a boardinghouse mattress. How do you like my\r\npicture, Phil?”\r\n\r\n“It seems a very dull one,” said Phil, with a grimace.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I’ve left out the transforming thing,” said Anne softly.\r\n“There’ll be love there, Phil—faithful, tender love, such as I’ll never\r\nfind anywhere else in the world—love that’s waiting for me. That makes\r\nmy picture a masterpiece, doesn’t it, even if the colors are not very\r\nbrilliant?”\r\n\r\nPhil silently got up, tossed her box of chocolates away, went up to\r\nAnne, and put her arms about her.\r\n\r\n“Anne, I wish I was like you,” she said soberly.\r\n\r\nDiana met Anne at the Carmody station the next night, and they drove\r\nhome together under silent, star-sown depths of sky. Green Gables had a\r\nvery festal appearance as they drove up the lane. There was a light in\r\nevery window, the glow breaking out through the darkness like flame-red\r\nblossoms swung against the dark background of the Haunted Wood. And in\r\nthe yard was a brave bonfire with two gay little figures dancing around\r\nit, one of which gave an unearthly yell as the buggy turned in under\r\nthe poplars.\r\n\r\n“Davy means that for an Indian war-whoop,” said Diana. “Mr. Harrison’s\r\nhired boy taught it to him, and he’s been practicing it up to welcome\r\nyou with. Mrs. Lynde says it has worn her nerves to a frazzle. He\r\ncreeps up behind her, you know, and then lets go. He was determined to\r\nhave a bonfire for you, too. He’s been piling up branches for a\r\nfortnight and pestering Marilla to be let pour some kerosene oil over\r\nit before setting it on fire. I guess she did, by the smell, though\r\nMrs. Lynde said up to the last that Davy would blow himself and\r\neverybody else up if he was let.”\r\n\r\nAnne was out of the buggy by this time, and Davy was rapturously\r\nhugging her knees, while even Dora was clinging to her hand.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that a bully bonfire, Anne? Just let me show you how to poke\r\nit—see the sparks? I did it for you, Anne, ’cause I was so glad you\r\nwere coming home.”\r\n\r\nThe kitchen door opened and Marilla’s spare form darkened against the\r\ninner light. She preferred to meet Anne in the shadows, for she was\r\nhorribly afraid that she was going to cry with joy—she, stern,\r\nrepressed Marilla, who thought all display of deep emotion unseemly.\r\nMrs. Lynde was behind her, sonsy, kindly, matronly, as of yore. The\r\nlove that Anne had told Phil was waiting for her surrounded her and\r\nenfolded her with its blessing and its sweetness. Nothing, after all,\r\ncould compare with old ties, old friends, and old Green Gables! How\r\nstarry Anne’s eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table,\r\nhow pink her cheeks, how silver-clear her laughter! And Diana was going\r\nto stay all night, too. How like the dear old times it was! And the\r\nrose-bud tea-set graced the table! With Marilla the force of nature\r\ncould no further go.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you and Diana will now proceed to talk all night,” said\r\nMarilla sarcastically, as the girls went upstairs. Marilla was always\r\nsarcastic after any self-betrayal.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed Anne gaily, “but I’m going to put Davy to bed first. He\r\ninsists on that.”\r\n\r\n“You bet,” said Davy, as they went along the hall. “I want somebody to\r\nsay my prayers to again. It’s no fun saying them alone.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say them alone, Davy. God is always with you to hear you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t see Him,” objected Davy. “I want to pray to somebody I\r\ncan see, but I _won’t_ say them to Mrs. Lynde or Marilla, there now!”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when Davy was garbed in his gray flannel nighty, he did\r\nnot seem in a hurry to begin. He stood before Anne, shuffling one bare\r\nfoot over the other, and looked undecided.\r\n\r\n“Come, dear, kneel down,” said Anne.\r\n\r\nDavy came and buried his head in Anne’s lap, but he did not kneel down.\r\n\r\n“Anne,” he said in a muffled voice. “I don’t feel like praying after\r\nall. I haven’t felt like it for a week now. I—I _didnt’t_ pray last\r\nnight nor the night before.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, Davy?” asked Anne gently.\r\n\r\n“You—you won’t be mad if I tell you?” implored Davy.\r\n\r\nAnne lifted the little gray-flannelled body on her knee and cuddled his\r\nhead on her arm.\r\n\r\n“Do I ever get ‘mad’ when you tell me things, Davy?”\r\n\r\n“No-o-o, you never do. But you get sorry, and that’s worse. You’ll be\r\nawful sorry when I tell you this, Anne—and you’ll be ’shamed of me, I\r\ns’pose.”\r\n\r\n“Have you done something naughty, Davy, and is that why you can’t say\r\nyour prayers?”\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t done anything naughty—yet. But I want to do it.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, Davy?”\r\n\r\n“I—I want to say a bad word, Anne,” blurted out Davy, with a desperate\r\neffort. “I heard Mr. Harrison’s hired boy say it one day last week, and\r\never since I’ve been wanting to say it _all_ the time—even when I’m\r\nsaying my prayers.”\r\n\r\n“Say it then, Davy.”\r\n\r\nDavy lifted his flushed face in amazement.\r\n\r\n“But, Anne, it’s an _awful_ bad word.”\r\n\r\n“_Say it!_”\r\n\r\nDavy gave her another incredulous look, then in a low voice he said the\r\ndreadful word. The next minute his face was burrowing against her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anne, I’ll never say it again—never. I’ll never _want_ to say it\r\nagain. I knew it was bad, but I didn’t s’pose it was so—so—I didn’t\r\ns’pose it was like _that_.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think you’ll ever want to say it again, Davy—or think it,\r\neither. And I wouldn’t go about much with Mr. Harrison’s hired boy if I\r\nwere you.”\r\n\r\n“He can make bully war-whoops,” said Davy a little regretfully.\r\n\r\n“But you don’t want your mind filled with bad words, do you, Davy—words\r\nthat will poison it and drive out all that is good and manly?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Davy, owl-eyed with introspection.\r\n\r\n“Then don’t go with those people who use them. And now do you feel as\r\nif you could say your prayers, Davy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Davy, eagerly wriggling down on his knees, “I can say\r\nthem now all right. I ain’t scared now to say ‘if I should die before I\r\nwake,’ like I was when I was wanting to say that word.”\r\n\r\nProbably Anne and Diana did empty out their souls to each other that\r\nnight, but no record of their confidences has been preserved. They both\r\nlooked as fresh and bright-eyed at breakfast as only youth can look\r\nafter unlawful hours of revelry and confession. There had been no snow\r\nup to this time, but as Diana crossed the old log bridge on her\r\nhomeward way the white flakes were beginning to flutter down over the\r\nfields and woods, russet and gray in their dreamless sleep. Soon the\r\nfar-away slopes and hills were dim and wraith-like through their gauzy\r\nscarfing, as if pale autumn had flung a misty bridal veil over her hair\r\nand was waiting for her wintry bridegroom. So they had a white\r\nChristmas after all, and a very pleasant day it was. In the forenoon\r\nletters and gifts came from Miss Lavendar and Paul; Anne opened them in\r\nthe cheerful Green Gables kitchen, which was filled with what Davy,\r\nsniffing in ecstasy, called “pretty smells.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavendar and Mr. Irving are settled in their new home now,”\r\nreported Anne. “I am sure Miss Lavendar is perfectly happy—I know it by\r\nthe general tone of her letter—but there’s a note from Charlotta the\r\nFourth. She doesn’t like Boston at all, and she is fearfully homesick.\r\nMiss Lavendar wants me to go through to Echo Lodge some day while I’m\r\nhome and light a fire to air it, and see that the cushions aren’t\r\ngetting moldy. I think I’ll get Diana to go over with me next week, and\r\nwe can spend the evening with Theodora Dix. I want to see Theodora. By\r\nthe way, is Ludovic Speed still going to see her?”\r\n\r\n“They say so,” said Marilla, “and he’s likely to continue it. Folks\r\nhave given up expecting that that courtship will ever arrive anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“I’d hurry him up a bit, if I was Theodora, that’s what,” said Mrs.\r\nLynde. And there is not the slightest doubt but that she would.\r\n\r\nThere was also a characteristic scrawl from Philippa, full of Alec and\r\nAlonzo, what they said and what they did, and how they looked when they\r\nsaw her.\r\n\r\n“But I can’t make up my mind yet which to marry,” wrote Phil. “I do\r\nwish you had come with me to decide for me. Some one will have to. When\r\nI saw Alec my heart gave a great thump and I thought, ‘He might be the\r\nright one.’ And then, when Alonzo came, thump went my heart again. So\r\nthat’s no guide, though it should be, according to all the novels I’ve\r\never read. Now, Anne, _your_ heart wouldn’t thump for anybody but the\r\ngenuine Prince Charming, would it? There must be something radically\r\nwrong with mine. But I’m having a perfectly gorgeous time. How I wish\r\nyou were here! It’s snowing today, and I’m rapturous. I was so afraid\r\nwe’d have a green Christmas and I loathe them. You know, when Christmas\r\nis a dirty grayey-browney affair, looking as if it had been left over a\r\nhundred years ago and had been in soak ever since, it is called a\r\n_green_ Christmas! Don’t ask me why. As Lord Dundreary says, ‘there are\r\nthome thingth no fellow can underthtand.’\r\n\r\n“Anne, did you ever get on a street car and then discover that you\r\nhadn’t any money with you to pay your fare? I did, the other day. It’s\r\nquite awful. I had a nickel with me when I got on the car. I thought it\r\nwas in the left pocket of my coat. When I got settled down comfortably\r\nI felt for it. It wasn’t there. I had a cold chill. I felt in the other\r\npocket. Not there. I had another chill. Then I felt in a little inside\r\npocket. All in vain. I had two chills at once.\r\n\r\n“I took off my gloves, laid them on the seat, and went over all my\r\npockets again. It was not there. I stood up and shook myself, and then\r\nlooked on the floor. The car was full of people, who were going home\r\nfrom the opera, and they all stared at me, but I was past caring for a\r\nlittle thing like that.\r\n\r\n“But I could not find my fare. I concluded I must have put it in my\r\nmouth and swallowed it inadvertently.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know what to do. Would the conductor, I wondered, stop the\r\ncar and put me off in ignominy and shame? Was it possible that I could\r\nconvince him that I was merely the victim of my own absentmindedness,\r\nand not an unprincipled creature trying to obtain a ride upon false\r\npretenses? How I wished that Alec or Alonzo were there. But they\r\nweren’t because I wanted them. If I _hadn’t_ wanted them they would\r\nhave been there by the dozen. And I couldn’t decide what to say to the\r\nconductor when he came around. As soon as I got one sentence of\r\nexplanation mapped out in my mind I felt nobody could believe it and I\r\nmust compose another. It seemed there was nothing to do but trust in\r\nProvidence, and for all the comfort that gave me I might as well have\r\nbeen the old lady who, when told by the captain during a storm that she\r\nmust put her trust in the Almighty exclaimed, ‘Oh, Captain, is it as\r\nbad as that?’\r\n\r\n“Just at the conventional moment, when all hope had fled, and the\r\nconductor was holding out his box to the passenger next to me, I\r\nsuddenly remembered where I had put that wretched coin of the realm. I\r\nhadn’t swallowed it after all. I meekly fished it out of the index\r\nfinger of my glove and poked it in the box. I smiled at everybody and\r\nfelt that it was a beautiful world.”\r\n\r\nThe visit to Echo Lodge was not the least pleasant of many pleasant\r\nholiday outings. Anne and Diana went back to it by the old way of the\r\nbeech woods, carrying a lunch basket with them. Echo Lodge, which had\r\nbeen closed ever since Miss Lavendar’s wedding, was briefly thrown open\r\nto wind and sunshine once more, and firelight glimmered again in the\r\nlittle rooms. The perfume of Miss Lavendar’s rose bowl still filled the\r\nair. It was hardly possible to believe that Miss Lavendar would not\r\ncome tripping in presently, with her brown eyes a-star with welcome,\r\nand that Charlotta the Fourth, blue of bow and wide of smile, would not\r\npop through the door. Paul, too, seemed hovering around, with his fairy\r\nfancies.\r\n\r\n“It really makes me feel a little bit like a ghost revisiting the old\r\ntime glimpses of the moon,” laughed Anne. “Let’s go out and see if the\r\nechoes are at home. Bring the old horn. It is still behind the kitchen\r\ndoor.”\r\n\r\nThe echoes were at home, over the white river, as silver-clear and\r\nmultitudinous as ever; and when they had ceased to answer the girls\r\nlocked up Echo Lodge again and went away in the perfect half hour that\r\nfollows the rose and saffron of a winter sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\nAnne’s First Proposal\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old year did not slip away in a green twilight, with a pinky-yellow\r\nsunset. Instead, it went out with a wild, white bluster and blow. It\r\nwas one of the nights when the storm-wind hurtles over the frozen\r\nmeadows and black hollows, and moans around the eaves like a lost\r\ncreature, and drives the snow sharply against the shaking panes.\r\n\r\n“Just the sort of night people like to cuddle down between their\r\nblankets and count their mercies,” said Anne to Jane Andrews, who had\r\ncome up to spend the afternoon and stay all night. But when they were\r\ncuddled between their blankets, in Anne’s little porch room, it was not\r\nher mercies of which Jane was thinking.\r\n\r\n“Anne,” she said very solemnly, “I want to tell you something. May I”\r\n\r\nAnne was feeling rather sleepy after the party Ruby Gillis had given\r\nthe night before. She would much rather have gone to sleep than listen\r\nto Jane’s confidences, which she was sure would bore her. She had no\r\nprophetic inkling of what was coming. Probably Jane was engaged, too;\r\nrumor averred that Ruby Gillis was engaged to the Spencervale\r\nschoolteacher, about whom all the girls were said to be quite wild.\r\n\r\n“I’ll soon be the only fancy-free maiden of our old quartet,” thought\r\nAnne, drowsily. Aloud she said, “Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Anne,” said Jane, still more solemnly, “what do you think of my\r\nbrother Billy?”\r\n\r\nAnne gasped over this unexpected question, and floundered helplessly in\r\nher thoughts. Goodness, what _did_ she think of Billy Andrews? She had\r\nnever thought _anything_ about him—round-faced, stupid, perpetually\r\nsmiling, good-natured Billy Andrews. Did _anybody_ ever think about\r\nBilly Andrews?\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t understand, Jane,” she stammered. “What do you\r\nmean—exactly?”\r\n\r\n“Do you like Billy?” asked Jane bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Why—why—yes, I like him, of course,” gasped Anne, wondering if she\r\nwere telling the literal truth. Certainly she did not _dis_like Billy.\r\nBut could the indifferent tolerance with which she regarded him, when\r\nhe happened to be in her range of vision, be considered positive enough\r\nfor liking? _What_ was Jane trying to elucidate?\r\n\r\n“Would you like him for a husband?” asked Jane calmly.\r\n\r\n“A husband!” Anne had been sitting up in bed, the better to wrestle\r\nwith the problem of her exact opinion of Billy Andrews. Now she fell\r\nflatly back on her pillows, the very breath gone out of her. “Whose\r\nhusband?”\r\n\r\n“Yours, of course,” answered Jane. “Billy wants to marry you. He’s\r\nalways been crazy about you—and now father has given him the upper farm\r\nin his own name and there’s nothing to prevent him from getting\r\nmarried. But he’s so shy he couldn’t ask you himself if you’d have him,\r\nso he got me to do it. I’d rather not have, but he gave me no peace\r\ntill I said I would, if I got a good chance. What do you think about\r\nit, Anne?”\r\n\r\nWas it a dream? Was it one of those nightmare things in which you find\r\nyourself engaged or married to some one you hate or don’t know, without\r\nthe slightest idea how it ever came about? No, she, Anne Shirley, was\r\nlying there, wide awake, in her own bed, and Jane Andrews was beside\r\nher, calmly proposing for her brother Billy. Anne did not know whether\r\nshe wanted to writhe or laugh; but she could do neither, for Jane’s\r\nfeelings must not be hurt.\r\n\r\n“I—I couldn’t marry Bill, you know, Jane,” she managed to gasp. “Why,\r\nsuch an idea never occurred to me—never!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose it did,” agreed Jane. “Billy has always been far too\r\nshy to think of courting. But you might think it over, Anne. Billy is a\r\ngood fellow. I must say that, if he is my brother. He has no bad habits\r\nand he’s a great worker, and you can depend on him. ‘A bird in the hand\r\nis worth two in the bush.’ He told me to tell you he’d be quite willing\r\nto wait till you got through college, if you insisted, though he’d\r\n_rather_ get married this spring before the planting begins. He’d\r\nalways be very good to you, I’m sure, and you know, Anne, I’d love to\r\nhave you for a sister.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t marry Billy,” said Anne decidedly. She had recovered her wits,\r\nand was even feeling a little angry. It was all so ridiculous. “There\r\nis no use thinking of it, Jane. I don’t care anything for him in that\r\nway, and you must tell him so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I didn’t suppose you would,” said Jane with a resigned sigh,\r\nfeeling that she had done her best. “I told Billy I didn’t believe it\r\nwas a bit of use to ask you, but he insisted. Well, you’ve made your\r\ndecision, Anne, and I hope you won’t regret it.”\r\n\r\nJane spoke rather coldly. She had been perfectly sure that the enamored\r\nBilly had no chance at all of inducing Anne to marry him. Nevertheless,\r\nshe felt a little resentment that Anne Shirley, who was, after all,\r\nmerely an adopted orphan, without kith or kin, should refuse her\r\nbrother—one of the Avonlea Andrews. Well, pride sometimes goes before a\r\nfall, Jane reflected ominously.\r\n\r\nAnne permitted herself to smile in the darkness over the idea that she\r\nmight ever regret not marrying Billy Andrews.\r\n\r\n“I hope Billy won’t feel very badly over it,” she said nicely.\r\n\r\nJane made a movement as if she were tossing her head on her pillow.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he won’t break his heart. Billy has too much good sense for that.\r\nHe likes Nettie Blewett pretty well, too, and mother would rather he\r\nmarried her than any one. She’s such a good manager and saver. I think,\r\nwhen Billy is once sure you won’t have him, he’ll take Nettie. Please\r\ndon’t mention this to any one, will you, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Anne, who had no desire whatever to publish\r\nabroad the fact that Billy Andrews wanted to marry her, preferring her,\r\nwhen all was said and done, to Nettie Blewett. Nettie Blewett!\r\n\r\n“And now I suppose we’d better go to sleep,” suggested Jane.\r\n\r\nTo sleep went Jane easily and speedily; but, though very unlike MacBeth\r\nin most respects, she had certainly contrived to murder sleep for Anne.\r\nThat proposed-to damsel lay on a wakeful pillow until the wee sma’s,\r\nbut her meditations were far from being romantic. It was not, however,\r\nuntil the next morning that she had an opportunity to indulge in a good\r\nlaugh over the whole affair. When Jane had gone home—still with a hint\r\nof frost in voice and manner because Anne had declined so ungratefully\r\nand decidedly the honor of an alliance with the House of Andrews—Anne\r\nretreated to the porch room, shut the door, and had her laugh out at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n“If I could only share the joke with some one!” she thought. “But I\r\ncan’t. Diana is the only one I’d want to tell, and, even if I hadn’t\r\nsworn secrecy to Jane, I can’t tell Diana things now. She tells\r\neverything to Fred—I know she does. Well, I’ve had my first proposal. I\r\nsupposed it would come some day—but I certainly never thought it would\r\nbe by proxy. It’s awfully funny—and yet there’s a sting in it, too,\r\nsomehow.”\r\n\r\nAnne knew quite well wherein the sting consisted, though she did not\r\nput it into words. She had had her secret dreams of the first time some\r\none should ask her the great question. And it had, in those dreams,\r\nalways been very romantic and beautiful: and the “some one” was to be\r\nvery handsome and dark-eyed and distinguished-looking and eloquent,\r\nwhether he were Prince Charming to be enraptured with “yes,” or one to\r\nwhom a regretful, beautifully worded, but hopeless refusal must be\r\ngiven. If the latter, the refusal was to be expressed so delicately\r\nthat it would be next best thing to acceptance, and he would go away,\r\nafter kissing her hand, assuring her of his unalterable, life-long\r\ndevotion. And it would always be a beautiful memory, to be proud of and\r\na little sad about, also.\r\n\r\nAnd now, this thrilling experience had turned out to be merely\r\ngrotesque. Billy Andrews had got his sister to propose for him because\r\nhis father had given him the upper farm; and if Anne wouldn’t “have\r\nhim” Nettie Blewett would. There was romance for you, with a vengeance!\r\nAnne laughed—and then sighed. The bloom had been brushed from one\r\nlittle maiden dream. Would the painful process go on until everything\r\nbecame prosaic and hum-drum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\nAn Unwelcome Lover and a Welcome Friend\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second term at Redmond sped as quickly as had the first—“actually\r\nwhizzed away,” Philippa said. Anne enjoyed it thoroughly in all its\r\nphases—the stimulating class rivalry, the making and deepening of new\r\nand helpful friendships, the gay little social stunts, the doings of\r\nthe various societies of which she was a member, the widening of\r\nhorizons and interests. She studied hard, for she had made up her mind\r\nto win the Thorburn Scholarship in English. This being won, meant that\r\nshe could come back to Redmond the next year without trenching on\r\nMarilla’s small savings—something Anne was determined she would not do.\r\n\r\nGilbert, too, was in full chase after a scholarship, but found plenty\r\nof time for frequent calls at Thirty-eight, St. John’s. He was Anne’s\r\nescort at nearly all the college affairs, and she knew that their names\r\nwere coupled in Redmond gossip. Anne raged over this but was helpless;\r\nshe could not cast an old friend like Gilbert aside, especially when he\r\nhad grown suddenly wise and wary, as behooved him in the dangerous\r\nproximity of more than one Redmond youth who would gladly have taken\r\nhis place by the side of the slender, red-haired coed, whose gray eyes\r\nwere as alluring as stars of evening. Anne was never attended by the\r\ncrowd of willing victims who hovered around Philippa’s conquering march\r\nthrough her Freshman year; but there was a lanky, brainy Freshie, a\r\njolly, little, round Sophomore, and a tall, learned Junior who all\r\nliked to call at Thirty-eight, St. John’s, and talk over ’ologies and\r\n’isms, as well as lighter subjects, with Anne, in the becushioned\r\nparlor of that domicile. Gilbert did not love any of them, and he was\r\nexceedingly careful to give none of them the advantage over him by any\r\nuntimely display of his real feelings Anne-ward. To her he had become\r\nagain the boy-comrade of Avonlea days, and as such could hold his own\r\nagainst any smitten swain who had so far entered the lists against him.\r\nAs a companion, Anne honestly acknowledged nobody could be so\r\nsatisfactory as Gilbert; she was very glad, so she told herself, that\r\nhe had evidently dropped all nonsensical ideas—though she spent\r\nconsiderable time secretly wondering why.\r\n\r\nOnly one disagreeable incident marred that winter. Charlie Sloane,\r\nsitting bolt upright on Miss Ada’s most dearly beloved cushion, asked\r\nAnne one night if she would promise “to become Mrs. Charlie Sloane some\r\nday.” Coming after Billy Andrews’ proxy effort, this was not quite the\r\nshock to Anne’s romantic sensibilities that it would otherwise have\r\nbeen; but it was certainly another heart-rending disillusion. She was\r\nangry, too, for she felt that she had never given Charlie the slightest\r\nencouragement to suppose such a thing possible. But what could you\r\nexpect of a Sloane, as Mrs. Rachel Lynde would ask scornfully?\r\nCharlie’s whole attitude, tone, air, words, fairly reeked with\r\nSloanishness. “He was conferring a great honor—no doubt whatever about\r\nthat. And when Anne, utterly insensible to the honor, refused him, as\r\ndelicately and considerately as she could—for even a Sloane had\r\nfeelings which ought not to be unduly lacerated—Sloanishness still\r\nfurther betrayed itself. Charlie certainly did not take his dismissal\r\nas Anne’s imaginary rejected suitors did. Instead, he became angry, and\r\nshowed it; he said two or three quite nasty things; Anne’s temper\r\nflashed up mutinously and she retorted with a cutting little speech\r\nwhose keenness pierced even Charlie’s protective Sloanishness and\r\nreached the quick; he caught up his hat and flung himself out of the\r\nhouse with a very red face; Anne rushed upstairs, falling twice over\r\nMiss Ada’s cushions on the way, and threw herself on her bed, in tears\r\nof humiliation and rage. Had she actually stooped to quarrel with a\r\nSloane? Was it possible anything Charlie Sloane could say had power to\r\nmake her angry? Oh, this was degradation, indeed—worse even than being\r\nthe rival of Nettie Blewett!\r\n\r\n“I wish I need never see the horrible creature again,” she sobbed\r\nvindictively into her pillows.\r\n\r\nShe could not avoid seeing him again, but the outraged Charlie took\r\ncare that it should not be at very close quarters. Miss Ada’s cushions\r\nwere henceforth safe from his depredations, and when he met Anne on the\r\nstreet, or in Redmond’s halls, his bow was icy in the extreme.\r\nRelations between these two old schoolmates continued to be thus\r\nstrained for nearly a year! Then Charlie transferred his blighted\r\naffections to a round, rosy, snub-nosed, blue-eyed, little Sophomore\r\nwho appreciated them as they deserved, whereupon he forgave Anne and\r\ncondescended to be civil to her again; in a patronizing manner intended\r\nto show her just what she had lost.\r\n\r\nOne day Anne scurried excitedly into Priscilla’s room.\r\n\r\n“Read that,” she cried, tossing Priscilla a letter. “It’s from\r\nStella—and she’s coming to Redmond next year—and what do you think of\r\nher idea? I think it’s a perfectly splendid one, if we can only carry\r\nit out. Do you suppose we can, Pris?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be better able to tell you when I find out what it is,” said\r\nPriscilla, casting aside a Greek lexicon and taking up Stella’s letter.\r\nStella Maynard had been one of their chums at Queen’s Academy and had\r\nbeen teaching school ever since.\r\n\r\n“But I’m going to give it up, Anne dear,” she wrote, “and go to college\r\nnext year. As I took the third year at Queen’s I can enter the\r\nSophomore year. I’m tired of teaching in a back country school. Some\r\nday I’m going to write a treatise on ‘The Trials of a Country\r\nSchoolmarm.’ It will be a harrowing bit of realism. It seems to be the\r\nprevailing impression that we live in clover, and have nothing to do\r\nbut draw our quarter’s salary. My treatise shall tell the truth about\r\nus. Why, if a week should pass without some one telling me that I am\r\ndoing easy work for big pay I would conclude that I might as well order\r\nmy ascension robe ‘immediately and to onct.’ ‘Well, you get your money\r\neasy,’ some rate-payer will tell me, condescendingly. ‘All you have to\r\ndo is to sit there and hear lessons.’ I used to argue the matter at\r\nfirst, but I’m wiser now. Facts are stubborn things, but as some one\r\nhas wisely said, not half so stubborn as fallacies. So I only smile\r\nloftily now in eloquent silence. Why, I have nine grades in my school\r\nand I have to teach a little of everything, from investigating the\r\ninteriors of earthworms to the study of the solar system. My youngest\r\npupil is four—his mother sends him to school to ‘get him out of the\r\nway’—and my oldest twenty—it ‘suddenly struck him’ that it would be\r\neasier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any\r\nlonger. In the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours\r\na day I don’t wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was\r\ntaken to see the biograph. ‘I have to look for what’s coming next\r\nbefore I know what went last,’ he complained. I feel like that myself.\r\n\r\n“And the letters I get, Anne! Tommy’s mother writes me that Tommy is\r\nnot coming on in arithmetic as fast as she would like. He is only in\r\nsimple reduction yet, and Johnny Johnson is in fractions, and Johnny\r\nisn’t half as smart as her Tommy, and she can’t understand it. And\r\nSusy’s father wants to know why Susy can’t write a letter without\r\nmisspelling half the words, and Dick’s aunt wants me to change his\r\nseat, because that bad Brown boy he is sitting with is teaching him to\r\nsay naughty words.\r\n\r\n“As to the financial part—but I’ll not begin on that. Those whom the\r\ngods wish to destroy they first make country schoolmarms!\r\n\r\n“There, I feel better, after that growl. After all, I’ve enjoyed these\r\npast two years. But I’m coming to Redmond.\r\n\r\n“And now, Anne, I’ve a little plan. You know how I loathe boarding.\r\nI’ve boarded for four years and I’m so tired of it. I don’t feel like\r\nenduring three years more of it.\r\n\r\n“Now, why can’t you and Priscilla and I club together, rent a little\r\nhouse somewhere in Kingsport, and board ourselves? It would be cheaper\r\nthan any other way. Of course, we would have to have a housekeeper and\r\nI have one ready on the spot. You’ve heard me speak of Aunt Jamesina?\r\nShe’s the sweetest aunt that ever lived, in spite of her name. She\r\ncan’t help that! She was called Jamesina because her father, whose name\r\nwas James, was drowned at sea a month before she was born. I always\r\ncall her Aunt Jimsie. Well, her only daughter has recently married and\r\ngone to the foreign mission field. Aunt Jamesina is left alone in a\r\ngreat big house, and she is horribly lonesome. She will come to\r\nKingsport and keep house for us if we want her, and I know you’ll both\r\nlove her. The more I think of the plan the more I like it. We could\r\nhave such good, independent times.\r\n\r\n“Now, if you and Priscilla agree to it, wouldn’t it be a good idea for\r\nyou, who are on the spot, to look around and see if you can find a\r\nsuitable house this spring? That would be better than leaving it till\r\nthe fall. If you could get a furnished one so much the better, but if\r\nnot, we can scare up a few sticks of finiture between us and old family\r\nfriends with attics. Anyhow, decide as soon as you can and write me, so\r\nthat Aunt Jamesina will know what plans to make for next year.”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s a good idea,” said Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“So do I,” agreed Anne delightedly. “Of course, we have a nice\r\nboardinghouse here, but, when all’s said and done, a boardinghouse\r\nisn’t home. So let’s go house-hunting at once, before exams come on.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid it will be hard enough to get a really suitable house,”\r\nwarned Priscilla. “Don’t expect too much, Anne. Nice houses in nice\r\nlocalities will probably be away beyond our means. We’ll likely have to\r\ncontent ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon\r\nlive people whom to know is to be unknown, and make life inside\r\ncompensate for the outside.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly they went house-hunting, but to find just what they wanted\r\nproved even harder than Priscilla had feared. Houses there were galore,\r\nfurnished and unfurnished; but one was too big, another too small; this\r\none too expensive, that one too far from Redmond. Exams were on and\r\nover; the last week of the term came and still their “house o’dreams,”\r\nas Anne called it, remained a castle in the air.\r\n\r\n“We shall have to give up and wait till the fall, I suppose,” said\r\nPriscilla wearily, as they rambled through the park on one of April’s\r\ndarling days of breeze and blue, when the harbor was creaming and\r\nshimmering beneath the pearl-hued mists floating over it. “We may find\r\nsome shack to shelter us then; and if not, boardinghouses we shall have\r\nalways with us.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to worry about it just now, anyway, and spoil this\r\nlovely afternoon,” said Anne, gazing around her with delight. The fresh\r\nchill air was faintly charged with the aroma of pine balsam, and the\r\nsky above was crystal clear and blue—a great inverted cup of blessing.\r\n“Spring is singing in my blood today, and the lure of April is abroad\r\non the air. I’m seeing visions and dreaming dreams, Pris. That’s\r\nbecause the wind is from the west. I do love the west wind. It sings of\r\nhope and gladness, doesn’t it? When the east wind blows I always think\r\nof sorrowful rain on the eaves and sad waves on a gray shore. When I\r\nget old I shall have rheumatism when the wind is east.”\r\n\r\n“And isn’t it jolly when you discard furs and winter garments for the\r\nfirst time and sally forth, like this, in spring attire?” laughed\r\nPriscilla. “Don’t you feel as if you had been made over new?”\r\n\r\n“Everything is new in the spring,” said Anne. “Springs themselves are\r\nalways so new, too. No spring is ever just like any other spring. It\r\nalways has something of its own to be its own peculiar sweetness. See\r\nhow green the grass is around that little pond, and how the willow buds\r\nare bursting.”\r\n\r\n“And exams are over and gone—the time of Convocation will come\r\nsoon—next Wednesday. This day next week we’ll be home.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad,” said Anne dreamily. “There are so many things I want to do.\r\nI want to sit on the back porch steps and feel the breeze blowing down\r\nover Mr. Harrison’s fields. I want to hunt ferns in the Haunted Wood\r\nand gather violets in Violet Vale. Do you remember the day of our\r\ngolden picnic, Priscilla? I want to hear the frogs singing and the\r\npoplars whispering. But I’ve learned to love Kingsport, too, and I’m\r\nglad I’m coming back next fall. If I hadn’t won the Thorburn I don’t\r\nbelieve I could have. I _couldn’t_ take any of Marilla’s little hoard.”\r\n\r\n“If we could only find a house!” sighed Priscilla. “Look over there at\r\nKingsport, Anne—houses, houses everywhere, and not one for us.”\r\n\r\n“Stop it, Pris. ‘The best is yet to be.’ Like the old Roman, we’ll find\r\na house or build one. On a day like this there’s no such word as fail\r\nin my bright lexicon.”\r\n\r\nThey lingered in the park until sunset, living in the amazing miracle\r\nand glory and wonder of the springtide; and they went home as usual, by\r\nway of Spofford Avenue, that they might have the delight of looking at\r\nPatty’s Place.\r\n\r\n“I feel as if something mysterious were going to happen right away—‘by\r\nthe pricking of my thumbs,’” said Anne, as they went up the slope.\r\n“It’s a nice story-bookish feeling. Why—why—why! Priscilla Grant, look\r\nover there and tell me if it’s true, or am I seein’ things?”\r\n\r\nPriscilla looked. Anne’s thumbs and eyes had not deceived her. Over the\r\narched gateway of Patty’s Place dangled a little, modest sign. It said\r\n“To Let, Furnished. Inquire Within.”\r\n\r\n“Priscilla,” said Anne, in a whisper, “do you suppose it’s possible\r\nthat we could rent Patty’s Place?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t,” averred Priscilla. “It would be too good to be true.\r\nFairy tales don’t happen nowadays. I won’t hope, Anne. The\r\ndisappointment would be too awful to bear. They’re sure to want more\r\nfor it than we can afford. Remember, it’s on Spofford Avenue.”\r\n\r\n“We must find out anyhow,” said Anne resolutely. “It’s too late to call\r\nthis evening, but we’ll come tomorrow. Oh, Pris, if we can get this\r\ndarling spot! I’ve always felt that my fortunes were linked with\r\nPatty’s Place, ever since I saw it first.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\nPatty’s Place\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next evening found them treading resolutely the herring-bone walk\r\nthrough the tiny garden. The April wind was filling the pine trees with\r\nits roundelay, and the grove was alive with robins—great, plump, saucy\r\nfellows, strutting along the paths. The girls rang rather timidly, and\r\nwere admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden. The door opened\r\ndirectly into a large living-room, where by a cheery little fire sat\r\ntwo other ladies, both of whom were also grim and ancient. Except that\r\none looked to be about seventy and the other fifty, there seemed little\r\ndifference between them. Each had amazingly big, light-blue eyes behind\r\nsteel-rimmed spectacles; each wore a cap and a gray shawl; each was\r\nknitting without haste and without rest; each rocked placidly and\r\nlooked at the girls without speaking; and just behind each sat a large\r\nwhite china dog, with round green spots all over it, a green nose and\r\ngreen ears. Those dogs captured Anne’s fancy on the spot; they seemed\r\nlike the twin guardian deities of Patty’s Place.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes nobody spoke. The girls were too nervous to find\r\nwords, and neither the ancient ladies nor the china dogs seemed\r\nconversationally inclined. Anne glanced about the room. What a dear\r\nplace it was! Another door opened out of it directly into the pine\r\ngrove and the robins came boldly up on the very step. The floor was\r\nspotted with round, braided mats, such as Marilla made at Green Gables,\r\nbut which were considered out of date everywhere else, even in Avonlea.\r\nAnd yet here they were on Spofford Avenue! A big, polished\r\ngrandfather’s clock ticked loudly and solemnly in a corner. There were\r\ndelightful little cupboards over the mantelpiece, behind whose glass\r\ndoors gleamed quaint bits of china. The walls were hung with old prints\r\nand silhouettes. In one corner the stairs went up, and at the first low\r\nturn was a long window with an inviting seat. It was all just as Anne\r\nhad known it must be.\r\n\r\nBy this time the silence had grown too dreadful, and Priscilla nudged\r\nAnne to intimate that she must speak.\r\n\r\n“We—we—saw by your sign that this house is to let,” said Anne faintly,\r\naddressing the older lady, who was evidently Miss Patty Spofford.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Miss Patty. “I intended to take that sign down today.”\r\n\r\n“Then—then we are too late,” said Anne sorrowfully. “You’ve let it to\r\nsome one else?”\r\n\r\n“No, but we have decided not to let it at all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m so sorry,” exclaimed Anne impulsively. “I love this place so.\r\nI did hope we could have got it.”\r\n\r\nThen did Miss Patty lay down her knitting, take off her specs, rub\r\nthem, put them on again, and for the first time look at Anne as at a\r\nhuman being. The other lady followed her example so perfectly that she\r\nmight as well have been a reflection in a mirror.\r\n\r\n“You _love_ it,” said Miss Patty with emphasis. “Does that mean that\r\nyou really _love_ it? Or that you merely like the looks of it? The\r\ngirls nowadays indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never\r\ncan tell what they _do_ mean. It wasn’t so in my young days. _Then_ a\r\ngirl did not say she _loved_ turnips, in just the same tone as she\r\nmight have said she loved her mother or her Savior.”\r\n\r\nAnne’s conscience bore her up.\r\n\r\n“I really do love it,” she said gently. “I’ve loved it ever since I saw\r\nit last fall. My two college chums and I want to keep house next year\r\ninstead of boarding, so we are looking for a little place to rent; and\r\nwhen I saw that this house was to let I was so happy.”\r\n\r\n“If you love it, you can have it,” said Miss Patty. “Maria and I\r\ndecided today that we would not let it after all, because we did not\r\nlike any of the people who have wanted it. We don’t _have_ to let it.\r\nWe can afford to go to Europe even if we don’t let it. It would help us\r\nout, but not for gold will I let my home pass into the possession of\r\nsuch people as have come here and looked at it. _You_ are different. I\r\nbelieve you do love it and will be good to it. You can have it.”\r\n\r\n“If—if we can afford to pay what you ask for it,” hesitated Anne.\r\n\r\nMiss Patty named the amount required. Anne and Priscilla looked at each\r\nother. Priscilla shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid we can’t afford quite so much,” said Anne, choking back her\r\ndisappointment. “You see, we are only college girls and we are poor.”\r\n\r\n“What were you thinking you could afford?” demanded Miss Patty, ceasing\r\nnot to knit.\r\n\r\nAnne named her amount. Miss Patty nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n“That will do. As I told you, it is not strictly necessary that we\r\nshould let it at all. We are not rich, but we have enough to go to\r\nEurope on. I have never been in Europe in my life, and never expected\r\nor wanted to go. But my niece there, Maria Spofford, has taken a fancy\r\nto go. Now, you know a young person like Maria can’t go globetrotting\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“No—I—I suppose not,” murmured Anne, seeing that Miss Patty was quite\r\nsolemnly in earnest.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. So I have to go along to look after her. I expect to\r\nenjoy it, too; I’m seventy years old, but I’m not tired of living yet.\r\nI daresay I’d have gone to Europe before if the idea had occurred to\r\nme. We shall be away for two years, perhaps three. We sail in June and\r\nwe shall send you the key, and leave all in order for you to take\r\npossession when you choose. We shall pack away a few things we prize\r\nespecially, but all the rest will be left.”\r\n\r\n“Will you leave the china dogs?” asked Anne timidly.\r\n\r\n“Would you like me to?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed, yes. They are delightful.”\r\n\r\nA pleased expression came into Miss Patty’s face.\r\n\r\n“I think a great deal of those dogs,” she said proudly. “They are over\r\na hundred years old, and they have sat on either side of this fireplace\r\never since my brother Aaron brought them from London fifty years ago.\r\nSpofford Avenue was called after my brother Aaron.”\r\n\r\n“A fine man he was,” said Miss Maria, speaking for the first time. “Ah,\r\nyou don’t see the like of him nowadays.”\r\n\r\n“He was a good uncle to you, Maria,” said Miss Patty, with evident\r\nemotion. “You do well to remember him.”\r\n\r\n“I shall always remember him,” said Miss Maria solemnly. “I can see\r\nhim, this minute, standing there before that fire, with his hands under\r\nhis coat-tails, beaming on us.”\r\n\r\nMiss Maria took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes; but Miss Patty\r\ncame resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“I shall leave the dogs where they are, if you will promise to be very\r\ncareful of them,” she said. “Their names are Gog and Magog. Gog looks\r\nto the right and Magog to the left. And there’s just one thing more.\r\nYou don’t object, I hope, to this house being called Patty’s Place?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed. We think that is one of the nicest things about it.”\r\n\r\n“You have sense, I see,” said Miss Patty in a tone of great\r\nsatisfaction. “Would you believe it? All the people who came here to\r\nrent the house wanted to know if they couldn’t take the name off the\r\ngate during their occupation of it. I told them roundly that the name\r\nwent with the house. This has been Patty’s Place ever since my brother\r\nAaron left it to me in his will, and Patty’s Place it shall remain\r\nuntil I die and Maria dies. After that happens the next possessor can\r\ncall it any fool name he likes,” concluded Miss Patty, much as she\r\nmight have said, “After that—the deluge.” “And now, wouldn’t you like\r\nto go over the house and see it all before we consider the bargain\r\nmade?”\r\n\r\nFurther exploration still further delighted the girls. Besides the big\r\nliving-room, there was a kitchen and a small bedroom downstairs.\r\nUpstairs were three rooms, one large and two small. Anne took an\r\nespecial fancy to one of the small ones, looking out into the big\r\npines, and hoped it would be hers. It was papered in pale blue and had\r\na little, old-timey toilet table with sconces for candles. There was a\r\ndiamond-paned window with a seat under the blue muslin frills that\r\nwould be a satisfying spot for studying or dreaming.\r\n\r\n“It’s all so delicious that I know we are going to wake up and find it\r\na fleeting vision of the night,” said Priscilla as they went away.\r\n\r\n“Miss Patty and Miss Maria are hardly such stuff as dreams are made\r\nof,” laughed Anne. “Can you fancy them ‘globe-trotting’—especially in\r\nthose shawls and caps?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose they’ll take them off when they really begin to trot,” said\r\nPriscilla, “but I know they’ll take their knitting with them\r\neverywhere. They simply couldn’t be parted from it. They will walk\r\nabout Westminster Abbey and knit, I feel sure. Meanwhile, Anne, we\r\nshall be living in Patty’s Place—and on Spofford Avenue. I feel like a\r\nmillionairess even now.”\r\n\r\n“I feel like one of the morning stars that sang for joy,” said Anne.\r\n\r\nPhil Gordon crept into Thirty-eight, St. John’s, that night and flung\r\nherself on Anne’s bed.\r\n\r\n“Girls, dear, I’m tired to death. I feel like the man without a\r\ncountry—or was it without a shadow? I forget which. Anyway, I’ve been\r\npacking up.”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose you are worn out because you couldn’t decide which\r\nthings to pack first, or where to put them,” laughed Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“E-zackly. And when I had got everything jammed in somehow, and my\r\nlandlady and her maid had both sat on it while I locked it, I\r\ndiscovered I had packed a whole lot of things I wanted for Convocation\r\nat the very bottom. I had to unlock the old thing and poke and dive\r\ninto it for an hour before I fished out what I wanted. I would get hold\r\nof something that felt like what I was looking for, and I’d yank it up,\r\nand it would be something else. No, Anne, I did _not_ swear.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say you did.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you looked it. But I admit my thoughts verged on the profane.\r\nAnd I have such a cold in the head—I can do nothing but sniffle, sigh\r\nand sneeze. Isn’t that alliterative agony for you? Queen Anne, do say\r\nsomething to cheer me up.”\r\n\r\n“Remember that next Thursday night, you’ll be back in the land of Alec\r\nand Alonzo,” suggested Anne.\r\n\r\nPhil shook her head dolefully.\r\n\r\n“More alliteration. No, I don’t want Alec and Alonzo when I have a cold\r\nin the head. But what has happened you two? Now that I look at you\r\nclosely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence. Why,\r\nyou’re actually _shining!_ What’s up?”\r\n\r\n“We are going to live in Patty’s Place next winter,” said Anne\r\ntriumphantly. “Live, mark you, not board! We’ve rented it, and Stella\r\nMaynard is coming, and her aunt is going to keep house for us.”\r\n\r\nPhil bounced up, wiped her nose, and fell on her knees before Anne.\r\n\r\n“Girls—girls—let me come, too. Oh, I’ll be so good. If there’s no room\r\nfor me I’ll sleep in the little doghouse in the orchard—I’ve seen it.\r\nOnly let me come.”\r\n\r\n“Get up, you goose.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t stir off my marrow bones till you tell me I can live with you\r\nnext winter.”\r\n\r\nAnne and Priscilla looked at each other. Then Anne said slowly, “Phil\r\ndear, we’d love to have you. But we may as well speak plainly. I’m\r\npoor—Pris is poor—Stella Maynard is poor—our housekeeping will have to\r\nbe very simple and our table plain. You’d have to live as we would.\r\nNow, you are rich and your boardinghouse fare attests the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what do I care for that?” demanded Phil tragically. “Better a\r\ndinner of herbs where your chums are than a stalled ox in a lonely\r\nboardinghouse. Don’t think I’m _all_ stomach, girls. I’ll be willing to\r\nlive on bread and water—with just a _leetle_ jam—if you’ll let me\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n“And then,” continued Anne, “there will be a good deal of work to be\r\ndone. Stella’s aunt can’t do it all. We all expect to have our chores\r\nto do. Now, you—”\r\n\r\n“Toil not, neither do I spin,” finished Philippa. “But I’ll learn to do\r\nthings. You’ll only have to show me once. I _can_ make my own bed to\r\nbegin with. And remember that, though I can’t cook, I _can_ keep my\r\ntemper. That’s something. And I _never_ growl about the weather. That’s\r\nmore. Oh, please, please! I never wanted anything so much in my\r\nlife—and this floor is awfully hard.”\r\n\r\n“There’s just one more thing,” said Priscilla resolutely. “You, Phil,\r\nas all Redmond knows, entertain callers almost every evening. Now, at\r\nPatty’s Place we can’t do that. We have decided that we shall be at\r\nhome to our friends on Friday evenings only. If you come with us you’ll\r\nhave to abide by that rule.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you don’t think I’ll mind that, do you? Why, I’m glad of it. I\r\nknew I should have had some such rule myself, but I hadn’t enough\r\ndecision to make it or stick to it. When I can shuffle off the\r\nresponsibility on you it will be a real relief. If you won’t let me\r\ncast in my lot with you I’ll die of the disappointment and then I’ll\r\ncome back and haunt you. I’ll camp on the very doorstep of Patty’s\r\nPlace and you won’t be able to go out or come in without falling over\r\nmy spook.”\r\n\r\nAgain Anne and Priscilla exchanged eloquent looks.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Anne, “of course we can’t promise to take you until we’ve\r\nconsulted with Stella; but I don’t think she’ll object, and, as far as\r\nwe are concerned, you may come and glad welcome.”\r\n\r\n“If you get tired of our simple life you can leave us, and no questions\r\nasked,” added Priscilla.\r\n\r\nPhil sprang up, hugged them both jubilantly, and went on her way\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\n“I hope things will go right,” said Priscilla soberly.\r\n\r\n“We must _make_ them go right,” avowed Anne. “I think Phil will fit\r\ninto our ’appy little ’ome very well.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Phil’s a dear to rattle round with and be chums. And, of course,\r\nthe more there are of us the easier it will be on our slim purses. But\r\nhow will she be to live with? You have to summer and winter with any\r\none before you know if she’s _livable_ or not.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, we’ll all be put to the test, as far as that goes. And we\r\nmust quit us like sensible folk, living and let live. Phil isn’t\r\nselfish, though she’s a little thoughtless, and I believe we will all\r\nget on beautifully in Patty’s Place.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\nThe Round of Life\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne was back in Avonlea with the luster of the Thorburn Scholarship on\r\nher brow. People told her she hadn’t changed much, in a tone which\r\nhinted they were surprised and a little disappointed she hadn’t.\r\nAvonlea had not changed, either. At least, so it seemed at first. But\r\nas Anne sat in the Green Gables pew, on the first Sunday after her\r\nreturn, and looked over the congregation, she saw several little\r\nchanges which, all coming home to her at once, made her realize that\r\ntime did not quite stand still, even in Avonlea. A new minister was in\r\nthe pulpit. In the pews more than one familiar face was missing\r\nforever. Old “Uncle Abe,” his prophesying over and done with, Mrs.\r\nPeter Sloane, who had sighed, it was to be hoped, for the last time,\r\nTimothy Cotton, who, as Mrs. Rachel Lynde said “had actually managed to\r\ndie at last after practicing at it for twenty years,” and old Josiah\r\nSloane, whom nobody knew in his coffin because he had his whiskers\r\nneatly trimmed, were all sleeping in the little graveyard behind the\r\nchurch. And Billy Andrews was married to Nettie Blewett! They “appeared\r\nout” that Sunday. When Billy, beaming with pride and happiness, showed\r\nhis be-plumed and be-silked bride into the Harmon Andrews’ pew, Anne\r\ndropped her lids to hide her dancing eyes. She recalled the stormy\r\nwinter night of the Christmas holidays when Jane had proposed for\r\nBilly. He certainly had not broken his heart over his rejection. Anne\r\nwondered if Jane had also proposed to Nettie for him, or if he had\r\nmustered enough spunk to ask the fateful question himself. All the\r\nAndrews family seemed to share in his pride and pleasure, from Mrs.\r\nHarmon in the pew to Jane in the choir. Jane had resigned from the\r\nAvonlea school and intended to go West in the fall.\r\n\r\n“Can’t get a beau in Avonlea, that’s what,” said Mrs. Rachel Lynde\r\nscornfully. “_Says_ she thinks she’ll have better health out West. I\r\nnever heard her health was poor before.”\r\n\r\n“Jane is a nice girl,” Anne had said loyally. “She never tried to\r\nattract attention, as some did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she never chased the boys, if that’s what you mean,” said Mrs.\r\nRachel. “But she’d like to be married, just as much as anybody, that’s\r\nwhat. What else would take her out West to some forsaken place whose\r\nonly recommendation is that men are plenty and women scarce? Don’t you\r\ntell me!”\r\n\r\nBut it was not at Jane, Anne gazed that day in dismay and surprise. It\r\nwas at Ruby Gillis, who sat beside her in the choir. What had happened\r\nto Ruby? She was even handsomer than ever; but her blue eyes were too\r\nbright and lustrous, and the color of her cheeks was hectically\r\nbrilliant; besides, she was very thin; the hands that held her\r\nhymn-book were almost transparent in their delicacy.\r\n\r\n“Is Ruby Gillis ill?” Anne asked of Mrs. Lynde, as they went home from\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n“Ruby Gillis is dying of galloping consumption,” said Mrs. Lynde\r\nbluntly. “Everybody knows it except herself and her _family_. They\r\nwon’t give in. If you ask _them_, she’s perfectly well. She hasn’t been\r\nable to teach since she had that attack of congestion in the winter,\r\nbut she says she’s going to teach again in the fall, and she’s after\r\nthe White Sands school. She’ll be in her grave, poor girl, when White\r\nSands school opens, that’s what.”\r\n\r\nAnne listened in shocked silence. Ruby Gillis, her old school-chum,\r\ndying? Could it be possible? Of late years they had grown apart; but\r\nthe old tie of school-girl intimacy was there, and made itself felt\r\nsharply in the tug the news gave at Anne’s heartstrings. Ruby, the\r\nbrilliant, the merry, the coquettish! It was impossible to associate\r\nthe thought of her with anything like death. She had greeted Anne with\r\ngay cordiality after church, and urged her to come up the next evening.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be away Tuesday and Wednesday evenings,” she had whispered\r\ntriumphantly. “There’s a concert at Carmody and a party at White Sands.\r\nHerb Spencer’s going to take me. He’s my _latest_. Be sure to come up\r\ntomorrow. I’m dying for a good talk with you. I want to hear all about\r\nyour doings at Redmond.”\r\n\r\nAnne knew that Ruby meant that she wanted to tell Anne all about her\r\nown recent flirtations, but she promised to go, and Diana offered to go\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been wanting to go to see Ruby for a long while,” she told Anne,\r\nwhen they left Green Gables the next evening, “but I really couldn’t go\r\nalone. It’s so awful to hear Ruby rattling on as she does, and\r\npretending there is nothing the matter with her, even when she can\r\nhardly speak for coughing. She’s fighting so hard for her life, and yet\r\nshe hasn’t any chance at all, they say.”\r\n\r\nThe girls walked silently down the red, twilit road. The robins were\r\nsinging vespers in the high treetops, filling the golden air with their\r\njubilant voices. The silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and\r\nponds, over fields where seeds were beginning to stir with life and\r\nthrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them. The air was\r\nfragrant with the wild, sweet, wholesome smell of young raspberry\r\ncopses. White mists were hovering in the silent hollows and violet\r\nstars were shining bluely on the brooklands.\r\n\r\n“What a beautiful sunset,” said Diana. “Look, Anne, it’s just like a\r\nland in itself, isn’t it? That long, low back of purple cloud is the\r\nshore, and the clear sky further on is like a golden sea.”\r\n\r\n“If we could sail to it in the moonshine boat Paul wrote of in his old\r\ncomposition—you remember?—how nice it would be,” said Anne, rousing\r\nfrom her reverie. “Do you think we could find all our yesterdays there,\r\nDiana—all our old springs and blossoms? The beds of flowers that Paul\r\nsaw there are the roses that have bloomed for us in the past?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t!” said Diana. “You make me feel as if we were old women with\r\neverything in life behind us.”\r\n\r\n“I think I’ve almost felt as if we were since I heard about poor Ruby,”\r\nsaid Anne. “If it is true that she is dying any other sad thing might\r\nbe true, too.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mind calling in at Elisha Wright’s for a moment, do you?”\r\nasked Diana. “Mother asked me to leave this little dish of jelly for\r\nAunt Atossa.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Aunt Atossa?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, haven’t you heard? She’s Mrs. Samson Coates of Spencervale—Mrs.\r\nElisha Wright’s aunt. She’s father’s aunt, too. Her husband died last\r\nwinter and she was left very poor and lonely, so the Wrights took her\r\nto live with them. Mother thought we ought to take her, but father put\r\nhis foot down. Live with Aunt Atossa he would not.”\r\n\r\n“Is she so terrible?” asked Anne absently.\r\n\r\n“You’ll probably see what she’s like before we can get away,” said\r\nDiana significantly. “Father says she has a face like a hatchet—it cuts\r\nthe air. But her tongue is sharper still.”\r\n\r\nLate as it was Aunt Atossa was cutting potato sets in the Wright\r\nkitchen. She wore a faded old wrapper, and her gray hair was decidedly\r\nuntidy. Aunt Atossa did not like being “caught in a kilter,” so she\r\nwent out of her way to be disagreeable.\r\n\r\n“Oh, so you’re Anne Shirley?” she said, when Diana introduced Anne.\r\n“I’ve heard of you.” Her tone implied that she had heard nothing good.\r\n“Mrs. Andrews was telling me you were home. She said you had improved a\r\ngood deal.”\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt Aunt Atossa thought there was plenty of room for\r\nfurther improvement. She ceased not from cutting sets with much energy.\r\n\r\n“Is it any use to ask you to sit down?” she inquired sarcastically. “Of\r\ncourse, there’s nothing very entertaining here for you. The rest are\r\nall away.”\r\n\r\n“Mother sent you this little pot of rhubarb jelly,” said Diana\r\npleasantly. “She made it today and thought you might like some.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thanks,” said Aunt Atossa sourly. “I never fancy your mother’s\r\njelly—she always makes it too sweet. However, I’ll try to worry some\r\ndown. My appetite’s been dreadful poor this spring. I’m far from well,”\r\ncontinued Aunt Atossa solemnly, “but still I keep a-doing. People who\r\ncan’t work aren’t wanted here. If it isn’t too much trouble will you be\r\ncondescending enough to set the jelly in the pantry? I’m in a hurry to\r\nget these spuds done tonight. I suppose you two _ladies_ never do\r\nanything like this. You’d be afraid of spoiling your hands.”\r\n\r\n“I used to cut potato sets before we rented the farm,” smiled Anne.\r\n\r\n“I do it yet,” laughed Diana. “I cut sets three days last week. Of\r\ncourse,” she added teasingly, “I did my hands up in lemon juice and kid\r\ngloves every night after it.”\r\n\r\nAunt Atossa sniffed.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you got that notion out of some of those silly magazines you\r\nread so many of. I wonder your mother allows you. But she always\r\nspoiled you. We all thought when George married her she wouldn’t be a\r\nsuitable wife for him.”\r\n\r\nAunt Atossa sighed heavily, as if all forebodings upon the occasion of\r\nGeorge Barry’s marriage had been amply and darkly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“Going, are you?” she inquired, as the girls rose. “Well, I suppose you\r\ncan’t find much amusement talking to an old woman like me. It’s such a\r\npity the boys ain’t home.”\r\n\r\n“We want to run in and see Ruby Gillis a little while,” explained\r\nDiana.\r\n\r\n“Oh, anything does for an excuse, of course,” said Aunt Atossa,\r\namiably. “Just whip in and whip out before you have time to say how-do\r\ndecently. It’s college airs, I s’pose. You’d be wiser to keep away from\r\nRuby Gillis. The doctors say consumption’s catching. I always knew\r\nRuby’d get something, gadding off to Boston last fall for a visit.\r\nPeople who ain’t content to stay home always catch something.”\r\n\r\n“People who don’t go visiting catch things, too. Sometimes they even\r\ndie,” said Diana solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Then they don’t have themselves to blame for it,” retorted Aunt Atossa\r\ntriumphantly. “I hear you are to be married in June, Diana.”\r\n\r\n“There is no truth in that report,” said Diana, blushing.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t put it off too long,” said Aunt Atossa significantly.\r\n“You’ll fade soon—you’re all complexion and hair. And the Wrights are\r\nterrible fickle. You ought to wear a hat, _Miss Shirley_. Your nose is\r\nfreckling scandalous. My, but you _are_ redheaded! Well, I s’pose we’re\r\nall as the Lord made us! Give Marilla Cuthbert my respects. She’s never\r\nbeen to see me since I come to Avonlea, but I s’pose I oughtn’t to\r\ncomplain. The Cuthberts always did think themselves a cut higher than\r\nany one else round here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, isn’t she dreadful?” gasped Diana, as they escaped down the lane.\r\n\r\n“She’s worse than Miss Eliza Andrews,” said Anne. “But then think of\r\nliving all your life with a name like Atossa! Wouldn’t it sour almost\r\nany one? She should have tried to imagine her name was Cordelia. It\r\nmight have helped her a great deal. It certainly helped me in the days\r\nwhen I didn’t like _Anne_.”\r\n\r\n“Josie Pye will be just like her when she grows up,” said Diana.\r\n“Josie’s mother and Aunt Atossa are cousins, you know. Oh, dear, I’m\r\nglad that’s over. She’s so malicious—she seems to put a bad flavor in\r\neverything. Father tells such a funny story about her. One time they\r\nhad a minister in Spencervale who was a very good, spiritual man but\r\nvery deaf. He couldn’t hear any ordinary conversation at all. Well,\r\nthey used to have a prayer meeting on Sunday evenings, and all the\r\nchurch members present would get up and pray in turn, or say a few\r\nwords on some Bible verse. But one evening Aunt Atossa bounced up. She\r\ndidn’t either pray or preach. Instead, she lit into everybody else in\r\nthe church and gave them a fearful raking down, calling them right out\r\nby name and telling them how they all had behaved, and casting up all\r\nthe quarrels and scandals of the past ten years. Finally she wound up\r\nby saying that she was disgusted with Spencervale church and she never\r\nmeant to darken its door again, and she hoped a fearful judgment would\r\ncome upon it. Then she sat down out of breath, and the minister, who\r\nhadn’t heard a word she said, immediately remarked, in a very devout\r\nvoice, ‘amen! The Lord grant our dear sister’s prayer!’ You ought to\r\nhear father tell the story.”\r\n\r\n“Speaking of stories, Diana,” remarked Anne, in a significant,\r\nconfidential tone, “do you know that lately I have been wondering if I\r\ncould write a short story—a story that would be good enough to be\r\npublished?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course you could,” said Diana, after she had grasped the\r\namazing suggestion. “You used to write perfectly thrilling stories\r\nyears ago in our old Story Club.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I hardly meant one of that kind of stories,” smiled Anne. “I’ve\r\nbeen thinking about it a little of late, but I’m almost afraid to try,\r\nfor, if I should fail, it would be too humiliating.”\r\n\r\n“I heard Priscilla say once that all Mrs. Morgan’s first stories were\r\nrejected. But I’m sure yours wouldn’t be, Anne, for it’s likely editors\r\nhave more sense nowadays.”\r\n\r\n“Margaret Burton, one of the Junior girls at Redmond, wrote a story\r\nlast winter and it was published in the _Canadian Woman_. I really do\r\nthink I could write one at least as good.”\r\n\r\n“And will you have it published in the _Canadian Woman?_”\r\n\r\n“I might try one of the bigger magazines first. It all depends on what\r\nkind of a story I write.”\r\n\r\n“What is it to be about?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know yet. I want to get hold of a good plot. I believe this is\r\nvery necessary from an editor’s point of view. The only thing I’ve\r\nsettled on is the heroine’s name. It is to be _Averil Lester_. Rather\r\npretty, don’t you think? Don’t mention this to any one, Diana. I\r\nhaven’t told anybody but you and Mr. Harrison. _He_ wasn’t very\r\nencouraging—he said there was far too much trash written nowadays as it\r\nwas, and he’d expected something better of me, after a year at\r\ncollege.”\r\n\r\n“What does Mr. Harrison know about it?” demanded Diana scornfully.\r\n\r\nThey found the Gillis home gay with lights and callers. Leonard\r\nKimball, of Spencervale, and Morgan Bell, of Carmody, were glaring at\r\neach other across the parlor. Several merry girls had dropped in. Ruby\r\nwas dressed in white and her eyes and cheeks were very brilliant. She\r\nlaughed and chattered incessantly, and after the other girls had gone\r\nshe took Anne upstairs to display her new summer dresses.\r\n\r\n“I’ve a blue silk to make up yet, but it’s a little heavy for summer\r\nwear. I think I’ll leave it until the fall. I’m going to teach in White\r\nSands, you know. How do you like my hat? That one you had on in church\r\nyesterday was real dinky. But I like something brighter for myself. Did\r\nyou notice those two ridiculous boys downstairs? They’ve both come\r\ndetermined to sit each other out. I don’t care a single bit about\r\neither of them, you know. Herb Spencer is the one I like. Sometimes I\r\nreally do think he’s _Mr. Right_. At Christmas I thought the\r\nSpencervale schoolmaster was that. But I found out something about him\r\nthat turned me against him. He nearly went insane when I turned him\r\ndown. I wish those two boys hadn’t come tonight. I wanted to have a\r\nnice good talk with you, Anne, and tell you such heaps of things. You\r\nand I were always good chums, weren’t we?”\r\n\r\nRuby slipped her arm about Anne’s waist with a shallow little laugh.\r\nBut just for a moment their eyes met, and, behind all the luster of\r\nRuby’s, Anne saw something that made her heart ache.\r\n\r\n“Come up often, won’t you, Anne?” whispered Ruby. “Come alone—I want\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Are you feeling quite well, Ruby?”\r\n\r\n“Me! Why, I’m perfectly well. I never felt better in my life. Of\r\ncourse, that congestion last winter pulled me down a little. But just\r\nsee my color. I don’t look much like an invalid, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\nRuby’s voice was almost sharp. She pulled her arm away from Anne, as if\r\nin resentment, and ran downstairs, where she was gayer than ever,\r\napparently so much absorbed in bantering her two swains that Diana and\r\nAnne felt rather out of it and soon went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n“Averil’s Atonement”\r\n\r\n\r\n“What are you dreaming of, Anne?”\r\n\r\nThe two girls were loitering one evening in a fairy hollow of the\r\nbrook. Ferns nodded in it, and little grasses were green, and wild\r\npears hung finely-scented, white curtains around it.\r\n\r\nAnne roused herself from her reverie with a happy sigh.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking out my story, Diana.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, have you really begun it?” cried Diana, all alight with eager\r\ninterest in a moment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have only a few pages written, but I have it all pretty well\r\nthought out. I’ve had such a time to get a suitable plot. None of the\r\nplots that suggested themselves suited a girl named _Averil_.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you have changed her name?”\r\n\r\n“No, the thing was impossible. I tried to, but I couldn’t do it, any\r\nmore than I could change yours. _Averil_ was so real to me that no\r\nmatter what other name I tried to give her I just thought of her as\r\n_Averil_ behind it all. But finally I got a plot that matched her. Then\r\ncame the excitement of choosing names for all my characters. You have\r\nno idea how fascinating that is. I’ve lain awake for hours thinking\r\nover those names. The hero’s name is _Perceval Dalrymple_.”\r\n\r\n“Have you named _all_ the characters?” asked Diana wistfully. “If you\r\nhadn’t I was going to ask you to let me name one—just some unimportant\r\nperson. I’d feel as if I had a share in the story then.”\r\n\r\n“You may name the little hired boy who lived with the _Lesters_,”\r\nconceded Anne. “He is not very important, but he is the only one left\r\nunnamed.”\r\n\r\n“Call him _Raymond Fitzosborne_,” suggested Diana, who had a store of\r\nsuch names laid away in her memory, relics of the old “Story Club,”\r\nwhich she and Anne and Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis had had in their\r\nschooldays.\r\n\r\nAnne shook her head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid that is too aristocratic a name for a chore boy, Diana. I\r\ncouldn’t imagine a Fitzosborne feeding pigs and picking up chips, could\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nDiana didn’t see why, if you had an imagination at all, you couldn’t\r\nstretch it to that extent; but probably Anne knew best, and the chore\r\nboy was finally christened _Robert Ray_, to be called _Bobby_ should\r\noccasion require.\r\n\r\n“How much do you suppose you’ll get for it?” asked Diana.\r\n\r\nBut Anne had not thought about this at all. She was in pursuit of fame,\r\nnot filthy lucre, and her literary dreams were as yet untainted by\r\nmercenary considerations.\r\n\r\n“You’ll let me read it, won’t you?” pleaded Diana.\r\n\r\n“When it is finished I’ll read it to you and Mr. Harrison, and I shall\r\nwant you to criticize it _severely_. No one else shall see it until it\r\nis published.”\r\n\r\n“How are you going to end it—happily or unhappily?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure. I’d like it to end unhappily, because that would be so\r\nmuch more romantic. But I understand editors have a prejudice against\r\nsad endings. I heard Professor Hamilton say once that nobody but a\r\ngenius should try to write an unhappy ending. And,” concluded Anne\r\nmodestly, “I’m anything but a genius.”\r\n\r\n“Oh I like happy endings best. You’d better let him marry her,” said\r\nDiana, who, especially since her engagement to Fred, thought this was\r\nhow every story should end.\r\n\r\n“But you like to cry over stories?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, in the middle of them. But I like everything to come right at\r\nlast.”\r\n\r\n“I must have one pathetic scene in it,” said Anne thoughtfully. “I\r\nmight let _Robert Ray_ be injured in an accident and have a death\r\nscene.”\r\n\r\n“No, you mustn’t kill _Bobby_ off,” declared Diana, laughing. “He\r\nbelongs to me and I want him to live and flourish. Kill somebody else\r\nif you have to.”\r\n\r\nFor the next fortnight Anne writhed or reveled, according to mood, in\r\nher literary pursuits. Now she would be jubilant over a brilliant idea,\r\nnow despairing because some contrary character would _not_ behave\r\nproperly. Diana could not understand this.\r\n\r\n“_Make_ them do as you want them to,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” mourned Anne. “Averil is such an unmanageable heroine. She\r\n_will_ do and say things I never meant her to. Then that spoils\r\neverything that went before and I have to write it all over again.”\r\n\r\nFinally, however, the story was finished, and Anne read it to Diana in\r\nthe seclusion of the porch gable. She had achieved her “pathetic scene”\r\nwithout sacrificing _Robert Ray_, and she kept a watchful eye on Diana\r\nas she read it. Diana rose to the occasion and cried properly; but,\r\nwhen the end came, she looked a little disappointed.\r\n\r\n“Why did you kill _Maurice Lennox?_” she asked reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“He was the villain,” protested Anne. “He had to be punished.”\r\n\r\n“I like him best of them all,” said unreasonable Diana.\r\n\r\n“Well, he’s dead, and he’ll have to stay dead,” said Anne, rather\r\nresentfully. “If I had let him live he’d have gone on persecuting\r\n_Averil_ and _Perceval_.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—unless you had reformed him.”\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t have been romantic, and, besides, it would have made the\r\nstory too long.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, it’s a perfectly elegant story, Anne, and will make you\r\nfamous, of that I’m sure. Have you got a title for it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I decided on the title long ago. I call it _Averil’s atonement_.\r\nDoesn’t that sound nice and alliterative? Now, Diana, tell me candidly,\r\ndo you see any faults in my story?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” hesitated Diana, “that part where _Averil_ makes the cake\r\ndoesn’t seem to me quite romantic enough to match the rest. It’s just\r\nwhat anybody might do. Heroines shouldn’t do cooking, _I_ think.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that is where the humor comes in, and it’s one of the best parts\r\nof the whole story,” said Anne. And it may be stated that in this she\r\nwas quite right.\r\n\r\nDiana prudently refrained from any further criticism, but Mr. Harrison\r\nwas much harder to please. First he told her there was entirely too\r\nmuch description in the story.\r\n\r\n“Cut out all those flowery passages,” he said unfeelingly.\r\n\r\nAnne had an uncomfortable conviction that Mr. Harrison was right, and\r\nshe forced herself to expunge most of her beloved descriptions, though\r\nit took three re-writings before the story could be pruned down to\r\nplease the fastidious Mr. Harrison.\r\n\r\n“I’ve left out _all_ the descriptions but the sunset,” she said at\r\nlast. “I simply _couldn’t_ let it go. It was the best of them all.”\r\n\r\n“It hasn’t anything to do with the story,” said Mr. Harrison, “and you\r\nshouldn’t have laid the scene among rich city people. What do you know\r\nof them? Why didn’t you lay it right here in Avonlea—changing the name,\r\nof course, or else Mrs. Rachel Lynde would probably think she was the\r\nheroine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that would never have done,” protested Anne. “Avonlea is the\r\ndearest place in the world, but it isn’t quite romantic enough for the\r\nscene of a story.”\r\n\r\n“I daresay there’s been many a romance in Avonlea—and many a tragedy,\r\ntoo,” said Mr. Harrison drily. “But your folks ain’t like real folks\r\nanywhere. They talk too much and use too high-flown language. There’s\r\none place where that _Dalrymple_ chap talks even on for two pages, and\r\nnever lets the girl get a word in edgewise. If he’d done that in real\r\nlife she’d have pitched him.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said Anne flatly. In her secret soul she thought\r\nthat the beautiful, poetical things said to _Averil_ would win any\r\ngirl’s heart completely. Besides, it was gruesome to hear of _Averil_,\r\nthe stately, queen-like _Averil_, “pitching” any one. _Averil_\r\n“declined her suitors.”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” resumed the merciless Mr. Harrison, “I don’t see why _Maurice\r\nLennox_ didn’t get her. He was twice the man the other is. He did bad\r\nthings, but he did them. Perceval hadn’t time for anything but\r\nmooning.”\r\n\r\n“Mooning.” That was even worse than “pitching!”\r\n\r\n“_Maurice Lennox_ was the villain,” said Anne indignantly. “I don’t see\r\nwhy every one likes him better than _Perceval_.”\r\n\r\n“Perceval is too good. He’s aggravating. Next time you write about a\r\nhero put a little spice of human nature in him.”\r\n\r\n“_Averil_ couldn’t have married _Maurice_. He was bad.”\r\n\r\n“She’d have reformed him. You can reform a man; you can’t reform a\r\njelly-fish, of course. Your story isn’t bad—it’s kind of interesting,\r\nI’ll admit. But you’re too young to write a story that would be worth\r\nwhile. Wait ten years.”\r\n\r\nAnne made up her mind that the next time she wrote a story she wouldn’t\r\nask anybody to criticize it. It was too discouraging. She would not\r\nread the story to Gilbert, although she told him about it.\r\n\r\n“If it is a success you’ll see it when it is published, Gilbert, but if\r\nit is a failure nobody shall ever see it.”\r\n\r\nMarilla knew nothing about the venture. In imagination Anne saw herself\r\nreading a story out of a magazine to Marilla, entrapping her into\r\npraise of it—for in imagination all things are possible—and then\r\ntriumphantly announcing herself the author.\r\n\r\nOne day Anne took to the Post Office a long, bulky envelope, addressed,\r\nwith the delightful confidence of youth and inexperience, to the very\r\nbiggest of the “big” magazines. Diana was as excited over it as Anne\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“How long do you suppose it will be before you hear from it?” she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“It shouldn’t be longer than a fortnight. Oh, how happy and proud I\r\nshall be if it is accepted!”\r\n\r\n“Of course it will be accepted, and they will likely ask you to send\r\nthem more. You may be as famous as Mrs. Morgan some day, Anne, and then\r\nhow proud I’ll be of knowing you,” said Diana, who possessed, at least,\r\nthe striking merit of an unselfish admiration of the gifts and graces\r\nof her friends.\r\n\r\nA week of delightful dreaming followed, and then came a bitter\r\nawakening. One evening Diana found Anne in the porch gable, with\r\nsuspicious-looking eyes. On the table lay a long envelope and a\r\ncrumpled manuscript.\r\n\r\n“Anne, your story hasn’t come back?” cried Diana incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it has,” said Anne shortly.\r\n\r\n“Well, that editor must be crazy. What reason did he give?”\r\n\r\n“No reason at all. There is just a printed slip saying that it wasn’t\r\nfound acceptable.”\r\n\r\n“I never thought much of that magazine, anyway,” said Diana hotly. “The\r\nstories in it are not half as interesting as those in the _Canadian\r\nWoman_, although it costs so much more. I suppose the editor is\r\nprejudiced against any one who isn’t a Yankee. Don’t be discouraged,\r\nAnne. Remember how Mrs. Morgan’s stories came back. Send yours to the\r\n_Canadian Woman_.”\r\n\r\n“I believe I will,” said Anne, plucking up heart. “And if it is\r\npublished I’ll send that American editor a marked copy. But I’ll cut\r\nthe sunset out. I believe Mr. Harrison was right.”\r\n\r\nOut came the sunset; but in spite of this heroic mutilation the editor\r\nof the _Canadian Woman_ sent Averil’s Atonement back so promptly that\r\nthe indignant Diana declared that it couldn’t have been read at all,\r\nand vowed she was going to stop her subscription immediately. Anne took\r\nthis second rejection with the calmness of despair. She locked the\r\nstory away in the garret trunk where the old Story Club tales reposed;\r\nbut first she yielded to Diana’s entreaties and gave her a copy.\r\n\r\n“This is the end of my literary ambitions,” she said bitterly.\r\n\r\nShe never mentioned the matter to Mr. Harrison, but one evening he\r\nasked her bluntly if her story had been accepted.\r\n\r\n“No, the editor wouldn’t take it,” she answered briefly.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison looked sidewise at the flushed, delicate profile.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose you’ll keep on writing them,” he said encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“No, I shall never try to write a story again,” declared Anne, with the\r\nhopeless finality of nineteen when a door is shut in its face.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t give up altogether,” said Mr. Harrison reflectively. “I’d\r\nwrite a story once in a while, but I wouldn’t pester editors with it.\r\nI’d write of people and places like I knew, and I’d make my characters\r\ntalk everyday English; and I’d let the sun rise and set in the usual\r\nquiet way without much fuss over the fact. If I had to have villains at\r\nall, I’d give them a chance, Anne—I’d give them a chance. There are\r\nsome terrible bad men in the world, I suppose, but you’d have to go a\r\nlong piece to find them—though Mrs. Lynde believes we’re all bad. But\r\nmost of us have got a little decency somewhere in us. Keep on writing,\r\nAnne.”\r\n\r\n“No. It was very foolish of me to attempt it. When I’m through Redmond\r\nI’ll stick to teaching. I can teach. I can’t write stories.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll be time for you to be getting a husband when you’re through\r\nRedmond,” said Mr. Harrison. “I don’t believe in putting marrying off\r\ntoo long—like I did.”\r\n\r\nAnne got up and marched home. There were times when Mr. Harrison was\r\nreally intolerable. “Pitching,” “mooning,” and “getting a husband.”\r\nOw!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\nThe Way of Transgressors\r\n\r\n\r\nDavy and Dora were ready for Sunday School. They were going alone,\r\nwhich did not often happen, for Mrs. Lynde always attended Sunday\r\nSchool. But Mrs. Lynde had twisted her ankle and was lame, so she was\r\nstaying home this morning. The twins were also to represent the family\r\nat church, for Anne had gone away the evening before to spend Sunday\r\nwith friends in Carmody, and Marilla had one of her headaches.\r\n\r\nDavy came downstairs slowly. Dora was waiting in the hall for him,\r\nhaving been made ready by Mrs. Lynde. Davy had attended to his own\r\npreparations. He had a cent in his pocket for the Sunday School\r\ncollection, and a five-cent piece for the church collection; he carried\r\nhis Bible in one hand and his Sunday School quarterly in the other; he\r\nknew his lesson and his Golden Text and his catechism question\r\nperfectly. Had he not studied them—perforce—in Mrs. Lynde’s kitchen,\r\nall last Sunday afternoon? Davy, therefore, should have been in a\r\nplacid frame of mind. As a matter of fact, despite text and catechism,\r\nhe was inwardly as a ravening wolf.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde limped out of her kitchen as he joined Dora.\r\n\r\n“Are you clean?” she demanded severely.\r\n\r\n“Yes—all of me that shows,” Davy answered with a defiant scowl.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel sighed. She had her suspicions about Davy’s neck and ears.\r\nBut she knew that if she attempted to make a personal examination Davy\r\nwould likely take to his heels and she could not pursue him today.\r\n\r\n“Well, be sure you behave yourselves,” she warned them. “Don’t walk in\r\nthe dust. Don’t stop in the porch to talk to the other children. Don’t\r\nsquirm or wriggle in your places. Don’t forget the Golden Text. Don’t\r\nlose your collection or forget to put it in. Don’t whisper at prayer\r\ntime, and don’t forget to pay attention to the sermon.”\r\n\r\nDavy deigned no response. He marched away down the lane, followed by\r\nthe meek Dora. But his soul seethed within. Davy had suffered, or\r\nthought he had suffered, many things at the hands and tongue of Mrs.\r\nRachel Lynde since she had come to Green Gables, for Mrs. Lynde could\r\nnot live with anybody, whether they were nine or ninety, without trying\r\nto bring them up properly. And it was only the preceding afternoon that\r\nshe had interfered to influence Marilla against allowing Davy to go\r\nfishing with the Timothy Cottons. Davy was still boiling over this.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was out of the lane Davy stopped and twisted his\r\ncountenance into such an unearthly and terrific contortion that Dora,\r\nalthough she knew his gifts in that respect, was honestly alarmed lest\r\nhe should never in the world be able to get it straightened out again.\r\n\r\n“Darn her,” exploded Davy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Davy, don’t swear,” gasped Dora in dismay.\r\n\r\n“‘Darn’ isn’t swearing—not real swearing. And I don’t care if it is,”\r\nretorted Davy recklessly.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you _must_ say dreadful words don’t say them on Sunday,”\r\npleaded Dora.\r\n\r\nDavy was as yet far from repentance, but in his secret soul he felt\r\nthat, perhaps, he had gone a little too far.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to invent a swear word of my own,” he declared.\r\n\r\n“God will punish you if you do,” said Dora solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Then I think God is a mean old scamp,” retorted Davy. “Doesn’t He know\r\na fellow must have some way of ’spressing his feelings?”\r\n\r\n“Davy!!!” said Dora. She expected that Davy would be struck down dead\r\non the spot. But nothing happened.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, I ain’t going to stand any more of Mrs. Lynde’s bossing,”\r\nspluttered Davy. “Anne and Marilla may have the right to boss me, but\r\n_she_ hasn’t. I’m going to do every single thing she told me not to do.\r\nYou watch me.”\r\n\r\nIn grim, deliberate silence, while Dora watched him with the\r\nfascination of horror, Davy stepped off the green grass of the\r\nroadside, ankle deep into the fine dust which four weeks of rainless\r\nweather had made on the road, and marched along in it, shuffling his\r\nfeet viciously until he was enveloped in a hazy cloud.\r\n\r\n“That’s the beginning,” he announced triumphantly. “And I’m going to\r\nstop in the porch and talk as long as there’s anybody there to talk to.\r\nI’m going to squirm and wriggle and whisper, and I’m going to say I\r\ndon’t know the Golden Text. And I’m going to throw away both of my\r\ncollections _right now_.”\r\n\r\nAnd Davy hurled cent and nickel over Mr. Barry’s fence with fierce\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n“Satan made you do that,” said Dora reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“He didn’t,” cried Davy indignantly. “I just thought it out for myself.\r\nAnd I’ve thought of something else. I’m not going to Sunday School or\r\nchurch at all. I’m going up to play with the Cottons. They told me\r\nyesterday they weren’t going to Sunday School today, ’cause their\r\nmother was away and there was nobody to make them. Come along, Dora,\r\nwe’ll have a great time.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to go,” protested Dora.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to,” said Davy. “If you don’t come I’ll tell Marilla that\r\nFrank Bell kissed you in school last Monday.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help it. I didn’t know he was going to,” cried Dora,\r\nblushing scarlet.\r\n\r\n“Well, you didn’t slap him or seem a bit cross,” retorted Davy. “I’ll\r\ntell her _that_, too, if you don’t come. We’ll take the short cut up\r\nthis field.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid of those cows,” protested poor Dora, seeing a prospect of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n“The very idea of your being scared of those cows,” scoffed Davy. “Why,\r\nthey’re both younger than you.”\r\n\r\n“They’re bigger,” said Dora.\r\n\r\n“They won’t hurt you. Come along, now. This is great. When I grow up I\r\nain’t going to bother going to church at all. I believe I can get to\r\nheaven by myself.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll go to the other place if you break the Sabbath day,” said\r\nunhappy Dora, following him sorely against her will.\r\n\r\nBut Davy was not scared—yet. Hell was very far off, and the delights of\r\na fishing expedition with the Cottons were very near. He wished Dora\r\nhad more spunk. She kept looking back as if she were going to cry every\r\nminute, and that spoiled a fellow’s fun. Hang girls, anyway. Davy did\r\nnot say “darn” this time, even in thought. He was not sorry—yet—that he\r\nhad said it once, but it might be as well not to tempt the Unknown\r\nPowers too far on one day.\r\n\r\nThe small Cottons were playing in their back yard, and hailed Davy’s\r\nappearance with whoops of delight. Pete, Tommy, Adolphus, and Mirabel\r\nCotton were all alone. Their mother and older sisters were away. Dora\r\nwas thankful Mirabel was there, at least. She had been afraid she would\r\nbe alone in a crowd of boys. Mirabel was almost as bad as a boy—she was\r\nso noisy and sunburned and reckless. But at least she wore dresses.\r\n\r\n“We’ve come to go fishing,” announced Davy.\r\n\r\n“Whoop,” yelled the Cottons. They rushed away to dig worms at once,\r\nMirabel leading the van with a tin can. Dora could have sat down and\r\ncried. Oh, if only that hateful Frank Bell had never kissed her! Then\r\nshe could have defied Davy, and gone to her beloved Sunday School.\r\n\r\nThey dared not, of course, go fishing on the pond, where they would be\r\nseen by people going to church. They had to resort to the brook in the\r\nwoods behind the Cotton house. But it was full of trout, and they had a\r\nglorious time that morning—at least the Cottons certainly had, and Davy\r\nseemed to have it. Not being entirely bereft of prudence, he had\r\ndiscarded boots and stockings and borrowed Tommy Cotton’s overalls.\r\nThus accoutered, bog and marsh and undergrowth had no terrors for him.\r\nDora was frankly and manifestly miserable. She followed the others in\r\ntheir peregrinations from pool to pool, clasping her Bible and\r\nquarterly tightly and thinking with bitterness of soul of her beloved\r\nclass where she should be sitting that very moment, before a teacher\r\nshe adored. Instead, here she was roaming the woods with those\r\nhalf-wild Cottons, trying to keep her boots clean and her pretty white\r\ndress free from rents and stains. Mirabel had offered the loan of an\r\napron but Dora had scornfully refused.\r\n\r\nThe trout bit as they always do on Sundays. In an hour the\r\ntransgressors had all the fish they wanted, so they returned to the\r\nhouse, much to Dora’s relief. She sat primly on a hencoop in the yard\r\nwhile the others played an uproarious game of tag; and then they all\r\nclimbed to the top of the pig-house roof and cut their initials on the\r\nsaddleboard. The flat-roofed henhouse and a pile of straw beneath gave\r\nDavy another inspiration. They spent a splendid half hour climbing on\r\nthe roof and diving off into the straw with whoops and yells.\r\n\r\nBut even unlawful pleasures must come to an end. When the rumble of\r\nwheels over the pond bridge told that people were going home from\r\nchurch Davy knew they must go. He discarded Tommy’s overalls, resumed\r\nhis own rightful attire, and turned away from his string of trout with\r\na sigh. No use to think of taking them home.\r\n\r\n“Well, hadn’t we a splendid time?” he demanded defiantly, as they went\r\ndown the hill field.\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t,” said Dora flatly. “And I don’t believe you\r\nhad—really—either,” she added, with a flash of insight that was not to\r\nbe expected of her.\r\n\r\n“I had so,” cried Davy, but in the voice of one who doth protest too\r\nmuch. “No wonder you hadn’t—just sitting there like a—like a mule.”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t going to, ’sociate with the Cottons,” said Dora loftily.\r\n\r\n“The Cottons are all right,” retorted Davy. “And they have far better\r\ntimes than we have. They do just as they please and say just what they\r\nlike before everybody. _I_’m going to do that, too, after this.”\r\n\r\n“There are lots of things you wouldn’t dare say before everybody,”\r\naverred Dora.\r\n\r\n“No, there isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“There is, too. Would you,” demanded Dora gravely, “would you say\r\n‘tomcat’ before the minister?”\r\n\r\nThis was a staggerer. Davy was not prepared for such a concrete example\r\nof the freedom of speech. But one did not have to be consistent with\r\nDora.\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” he admitted sulkily.\r\n\r\n“‘Tomcat’ isn’t a holy word. I wouldn’t mention such an animal before a\r\nminister at all.”\r\n\r\n“But if you had to?” persisted Dora.\r\n\r\n“I’d call it a Thomas pussy,” said Davy.\r\n\r\n“_I_ think ‘gentleman cat’ would be more polite,” reflected Dora.\r\n\r\n“_You_ thinking!” retorted Davy with withering scorn.\r\n\r\nDavy was not feeling comfortable, though he would have died before he\r\nadmitted it to Dora. Now that the exhilaration of truant delights had\r\ndied away, his conscience was beginning to give him salutary twinges.\r\nAfter all, perhaps it would have been better to have gone to Sunday\r\nSchool and church. Mrs. Lynde might be bossy; but there was always a\r\nbox of cookies in her kitchen cupboard and she was not stingy. At this\r\ninconvenient moment Davy remembered that when he had torn his new\r\nschool pants the week before, Mrs. Lynde had mended them beautifully\r\nand never said a word to Marilla about them.\r\n\r\nBut Davy’s cup of iniquity was not yet full. He was to discover that\r\none sin demands another to cover it. They had dinner with Mrs. Lynde\r\nthat day, and the first thing she asked Davy was,\r\n\r\n“Were all your class in Sunday School today?”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m,” said Davy with a gulp. “All were there—’cept one.”\r\n\r\n“Did you say your Golden Text and catechism?”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m.”\r\n\r\n“Did you put your collection in?”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m.”\r\n\r\n“Was Mrs. Malcolm MacPherson in church?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.” This, at least, was the truth, thought wretched Davy.\r\n\r\n“Was the Ladies’ Aid announced for next week?”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m”—quakingly.\r\n\r\n“Was prayer-meeting?”\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ should know. You should listen more attentively to the\r\nannouncements. What was Mr. Harvey’s text?”\r\n\r\nDavy took a frantic gulp of water and swallowed it and the last protest\r\nof conscience together. He glibly recited an old Golden Text learned\r\nseveral weeks ago. Fortunately Mrs. Lynde now stopped questioning him;\r\nbut Davy did not enjoy his dinner.\r\n\r\nHe could only eat one helping of pudding.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you?” demanded justly astonished Mrs. Lynde.\r\n“Are you sick?”\r\n\r\n“No,” muttered Davy.\r\n\r\n“You look pale. You’d better keep out of the sun this afternoon,”\r\nadmonished Mrs. Lynde.\r\n\r\n“Do you know how many lies you told Mrs. Lynde?” asked Dora\r\nreproachfully, as soon as they were alone after dinner.\r\n\r\nDavy, goaded to desperation, turned fiercely.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care,” he said. “You just shut up, Dora\r\nKeith.”\r\n\r\nThen poor Davy betook himself to a secluded retreat behind the woodpile\r\nto think over the way of transgressors.\r\n\r\nGreen Gables was wrapped in darkness and silence when Anne reached\r\nhome. She lost no time going to bed, for she was very tired and sleepy.\r\nThere had been several Avonlea jollifications the preceding week,\r\ninvolving rather late hours. Anne’s head was hardly on her pillow\r\nbefore she was half asleep; but just then her door was softly opened\r\nand a pleading voice said, “Anne.”\r\n\r\nAnne sat up drowsily.\r\n\r\n“Davy, is that you? What is the matter?”\r\n\r\nA white-clad figure flung itself across the floor and on to the bed.\r\n\r\n“Anne,” sobbed Davy, getting his arms about her neck. “I’m awful glad\r\nyou’re home. I couldn’t go to sleep till I’d told somebody.”\r\n\r\n“Told somebody what?”\r\n\r\n“How mis’rubul I am.”\r\n\r\n“Why are you miserable, dear?”\r\n\r\n“’Cause I was so bad today, Anne. Oh, I was awful bad—badder’n I’ve\r\never been yet.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m afraid to tell you. You’ll never like me again, Anne. I\r\ncouldn’t say my prayers tonight. I couldn’t tell God what I’d done. I\r\nwas ’shamed to have Him know.”\r\n\r\n“But He knew anyway, Davy.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what Dora said. But I thought p’raps He mightn’t have noticed\r\njust at the time. Anyway, I’d rather tell you first.”\r\n\r\n“_What_ is it you did?”\r\n\r\nOut it all came in a rush.\r\n\r\n“I run away from Sunday School—and went fishing with the Cottons—and I\r\ntold ever so many whoppers to Mrs. Lynde—oh! ’most half a\r\ndozen—and—and—I—I said a swear word, Anne—a pretty near swear word,\r\nanyhow—and I called God names.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Davy didn’t know what to make of it. Was Anne so\r\nshocked that she never would speak to him again?\r\n\r\n“Anne, what are you going to do to me?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, dear. You’ve been punished already, I think.”\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t. Nothing’s been done to me.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been very unhappy ever since you did wrong, haven’t you?”\r\n\r\n“You bet!” said Davy emphatically.\r\n\r\n“That was your conscience punishing you, Davy.”\r\n\r\n“What’s my conscience? I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“It’s something in you, Davy, that always tells you when you are doing\r\nwrong and makes you unhappy if you persist in doing it. Haven’t you\r\nnoticed that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I didn’t know what it was. I wish I didn’t have it. I’d have\r\nlots more fun. Where is my conscience, Anne? I want to know. Is it in\r\nmy stomach?”\r\n\r\n“No, it’s in your soul,” answered Anne, thankful for the darkness,\r\nsince gravity must be preserved in serious matters.\r\n\r\n“I s’pose I can’t get clear of it then,” said Davy with a sigh. “Are\r\nyou going to tell Marilla and Mrs. Lynde on me, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“No, dear, I’m not going to tell any one. You are sorry you were\r\nnaughty, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“You bet!”\r\n\r\n“And you’ll never be bad like that again.”\r\n\r\n“No, but—” added Davy cautiously, “I might be bad some other way.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t say naughty words, or run away on Sundays, or tell\r\nfalsehoods to cover up your sins?”\r\n\r\n“No. It doesn’t pay,” said Davy.\r\n\r\n“Well, Davy, just tell God you are sorry and ask Him to forgive you.”\r\n\r\n“Have _you_ forgiven me, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Davy joyously, “I don’t care much whether God does or\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“Davy!”\r\n\r\n“Oh—I’ll ask Him—I’ll ask Him,” said Davy quickly, scrambling off the\r\nbed, convinced by Anne’s tone that he must have said something\r\ndreadful. “I don’t mind asking Him, Anne.—Please, God, I’m awful sorry\r\nI behaved bad today and I’ll try to be good on Sundays always and\r\nplease forgive me.—There now, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, run off to bed like a good boy.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Say, I don’t feel mis’rubul any more. I feel fine. Good\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Good night.”\r\n\r\nAnne slipped down on her pillows with a sigh of relief. Oh—how\r\nsleepy—she was! In another second—\r\n\r\n“Anne!” Davy was back again by her bed. Anne dragged her eyes open.\r\n\r\n“What is it now, dear?” she asked, trying to keep a note of impatience\r\nout of her voice.\r\n\r\n“Anne, have you ever noticed how Mr. Harrison spits? Do you s’pose, if\r\nI practice hard, I can learn to spit just like him?”\r\n\r\nAnne sat up.\r\n\r\n“Davy Keith,” she said, “go straight to your bed and don’t let me catch\r\nyou out of it again tonight! Go, now!”\r\n\r\nDavy went, and stood not upon the order of his going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\nThe Summons\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne was sitting with Ruby Gillis in the Gillis’ garden after the day\r\nhad crept lingeringly through it and was gone. It had been a warm,\r\nsmoky summer afternoon. The world was in a splendor of out-flowering.\r\nThe idle valleys were full of hazes. The woodways were pranked with\r\nshadows and the fields with the purple of the asters.\r\n\r\nAnne had given up a moonlight drive to the White Sands beach that she\r\nmight spend the evening with Ruby. She had so spent many evenings that\r\nsummer, although she often wondered what good it did any one, and\r\nsometimes went home deciding that she could not go again.\r\n\r\nRuby grew paler as the summer waned; the White Sands school was given\r\nup—“her father thought it better that she shouldn’t teach till New\r\nYear’s”—and the fancy work she loved oftener and oftener fell from\r\nhands grown too weary for it. But she was always gay, always hopeful,\r\nalways chattering and whispering of her beaux, and their rivalries and\r\ndespairs. It was this that made Anne’s visits hard for her. What had\r\nonce been silly or amusing was gruesome, now; it was death peering\r\nthrough a wilful mask of life. Yet Ruby seemed to cling to her, and\r\nnever let her go until she had promised to come again soon. Mrs. Lynde\r\ngrumbled about Anne’s frequent visits, and declared she would catch\r\nconsumption; even Marilla was dubious.\r\n\r\n“Every time you go to see Ruby you come home looking tired out,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“It’s so very sad and dreadful,” said Anne in a low tone. “Ruby doesn’t\r\nseem to realize her condition in the least. And yet I somehow feel she\r\nneeds help—craves it—and I want to give it to her and can’t. All the\r\ntime I’m with her I feel as if I were watching her struggle with an\r\ninvisible foe—trying to push it back with such feeble resistance as she\r\nhas. That is why I come home tired.”\r\n\r\nBut tonight Anne did not feel this so keenly. Ruby was strangely quiet.\r\nShe said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and “fellows.”\r\nShe lay in the hammock, with her untouched work beside her, and a white\r\nshawl wrapped about her thin shoulders. Her long yellow braids of\r\nhair—how Anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldays!—lay\r\non either side of her. She had taken the pins out—they made her head\r\nache, she said. The hectic flush was gone for the time, leaving her\r\npale and childlike.\r\n\r\nThe moon rose in the silvery sky, empearling the clouds around her.\r\nBelow, the pond shimmered in its hazy radiance. Just beyond the Gillis\r\nhomestead was the church, with the old graveyard beside it. The\r\nmoonlight shone on the white stones, bringing them out in clear-cut\r\nrelief against the dark trees behind.\r\n\r\n“How strange the graveyard looks by moonlight!” said Ruby suddenly.\r\n“How ghostly!” she shuddered. “Anne, it won’t be long now before I’ll\r\nbe lying over there. You and Diana and all the rest will be going\r\nabout, full of life—and I’ll be there—in the old graveyard—dead!”\r\n\r\nThe surprise of it bewildered Anne. For a few moments she could not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“You know it’s so, don’t you?” said Ruby insistently.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” answered Anne in a low tone. “Dear Ruby, I know.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody knows it,” said Ruby bitterly. “I know it—I’ve known it all\r\nsummer, though I wouldn’t give in. And, oh, Anne”—she reached out and\r\ncaught Anne’s hand pleadingly, impulsively—“I don’t want to die. I’m\r\n_afraid_ to die.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you be afraid, Ruby?” asked Anne quietly.\r\n\r\n“Because—because—oh, I’m not afraid but that I’ll go to heaven, Anne.\r\nI’m a church member. But—it’ll be all so different. I think—and\r\nthink—and I get so frightened—and—and—homesick. Heaven must be very\r\nbeautiful, of course, the Bible says so—but, Anne, _it won’t be what\r\n’ve been used to_.”\r\n\r\nThrough Anne’s mind drifted an intrusive recollection of a funny story\r\nshe had heard Philippa Gordon tell—the story of some old man who had\r\nsaid very much the same thing about the world to come. It had sounded\r\nfunny then—she remembered how she and Priscilla had laughed over it.\r\nBut it did not seem in the least humorous now, coming from Ruby’s pale,\r\ntrembling lips. It was sad, tragic—and true! Heaven could not be what\r\nRuby had been used to. There had been nothing in her gay, frivolous\r\nlife, her shallow ideals and aspirations, to fit her for that great\r\nchange, or make the life to come seem to her anything but alien and\r\nunreal and undesirable. Anne wondered helplessly what she could say\r\nthat would help her. Could she say anything? “I think, Ruby,” she began\r\nhesitatingly—for it was difficult for Anne to speak to any one of the\r\ndeepest thoughts of her heart, or the new ideas that had vaguely begun\r\nto shape themselves in her mind, concerning the great mysteries of life\r\nhere and hereafter, superseding her old childish conceptions, and it\r\nwas hardest of all to speak of them to such as Ruby Gillis—“I think,\r\nperhaps, we have very mistaken ideas about heaven—what it is and what\r\nit holds for us. I don’t think it can be so very different from life\r\nhere as most people seem to think. I believe we’ll just go on living, a\r\ngood deal as we live here—and be _ourselves_ just the same—only it will\r\nbe easier to be good and to—follow the highest. All the hindrances and\r\nperplexities will be taken away, and we shall see clearly. Don’t be\r\nafraid, Ruby.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it,” said Ruby pitifully. “Even if what you say about\r\nheaven is true—and you can’t be sure—it may be only that imagination of\r\nyours—it won’t be _just_ the same. It _can’t_ be. I want to go on\r\nliving _here_. I’m so young, Anne. I haven’t had my life. I’ve fought\r\nso hard to live—and it isn’t any use—I have to die—and leave\r\n_everything_ I care for.” Anne sat in a pain that was almost\r\nintolerable. She could not tell comforting falsehoods; and all that\r\nRuby said was so horribly true. She _was_ leaving everything she cared\r\nfor. She had laid up her treasures on earth only; she had lived solely\r\nfor the little things of life—the things that pass—forgetting the great\r\nthings that go onward into eternity, bridging the gulf between the two\r\nlives and making of death a mere passing from one dwelling to the\r\nother—from twilight to unclouded day. God would take care of her\r\nthere—Anne believed—she would learn—but now it was no wonder her soul\r\nclung, in blind helplessness, to the only things she knew and loved.\r\n\r\nRuby raised herself on her arm and lifted up her bright, beautiful blue\r\neyes to the moonlit skies.\r\n\r\n“I want to live,” she said, in a trembling voice. “I want to live like\r\nother girls. I—I want to be married, Anne—and—and—have little children.\r\nYou know I always loved babies, Anne. I couldn’t say this to any one\r\nbut you. I know you understand. And then poor Herb—he—he loves me and I\r\nlove him, Anne. The others meant nothing to me, but _he_ does—and if I\r\ncould live I would be his wife and be so happy. Oh, Anne, it’s hard.”\r\n\r\nRuby sank back on her pillows and sobbed convulsively. Anne pressed her\r\nhand in an agony of sympathy—silent sympathy, which perhaps helped Ruby\r\nmore than broken, imperfect words could have done; for presently she\r\ngrew calmer and her sobs ceased.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I’ve told you this, Anne,” she whispered. “It has helped me\r\njust to say it all out. I’ve wanted to all summer—every time you came.\r\nI wanted to talk it over with you—but I _couldn’t_. It seemed as if it\r\nwould make death so _sure_ if I _said_ I was going to die, or if any\r\none else said it or hinted it. I wouldn’t say it, or even think it. In\r\nthe daytime, when people were around me and everything was cheerful, it\r\nwasn’t so hard to keep from thinking of it. But in the night, when I\r\ncouldn’t sleep—it was so dreadful, Anne. I couldn’t get away from it\r\nthen. Death just came and stared me in the face, until I got so\r\nfrightened I could have screamed.\r\n\r\n“But you won’t be frightened any more, Ruby, will you? You’ll be brave,\r\nand believe that all is going to be well with you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try. I’ll think over what you have said, and try to believe it.\r\nAnd you’ll come up as often as you can, won’t you, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear.”\r\n\r\n“It—it won’t be very long now, Anne. I feel sure of that. And I’d\r\nrather have you than any one else. I always liked you best of all the\r\ngirls I went to school with. You were never jealous, or mean, like some\r\nof them were. Poor Em White was up to see me yesterday. You remember Em\r\nand I were such chums for three years when we went to school? And then\r\nwe quarrelled the time of the school concert. We’ve never spoken to\r\neach other since. Wasn’t it silly? Anything like that seems silly\r\n_now_. But Em and I made up the old quarrel yesterday. She said she’d\r\nhave spoken years ago, only she thought I wouldn’t. And I never spoke\r\nto her because I was sure she wouldn’t speak to me. Isn’t it strange\r\nhow people misunderstand each other, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Most of the trouble in life comes from misunderstanding, I think,”\r\nsaid Anne. “I must go now, Ruby. It’s getting late—and you shouldn’t be\r\nout in the damp.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll come up soon again.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very soon. And if there’s anything I can do to help you I’ll be\r\nso glad.”\r\n\r\n“I know. You _have_ helped me already. Nothing seems quite so dreadful\r\nnow. Good night, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, dear.”\r\n\r\nAnne walked home very slowly in the moonlight. The evening had changed\r\nsomething for her. Life held a different meaning, a deeper purpose. On\r\nthe surface it would go on just the same; but the deeps had been\r\nstirred. It must not be with her as with poor butterfly Ruby. When she\r\ncame to the end of one life it must not be to face the next with the\r\nshrinking terror of something wholly different—something for which\r\naccustomed thought and ideal and aspiration had unfitted her. The\r\nlittle things of life, sweet and excellent in their place, must not be\r\nthe things lived for; the highest must be sought and followed; the life\r\nof heaven must be begun here on earth.\r\n\r\nThat good night in the garden was for all time. Anne never saw Ruby in\r\nlife again. The next night the A.V.I.S. gave a farewell party to Jane\r\nAndrews before her departure for the West. And, while light feet danced\r\nand bright eyes laughed and merry tongues chattered, there came a\r\nsummons to a soul in Avonlea that might not be disregarded or evaded.\r\nThe next morning the word went from house to house that Ruby Gillis was\r\ndead. She had died in her sleep, painlessly and calmly, and on her face\r\nwas a smile—as if, after all, death had come as a kindly friend to lead\r\nher over the threshold, instead of the grisly phantom she had dreaded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel Lynde said emphatically after the funeral that Ruby Gillis\r\nwas the handsomest corpse she ever laid eyes on. Her loveliness, as she\r\nlay, white-clad, among the delicate flowers that Anne had placed about\r\nher, was remembered and talked of for years in Avonlea. Ruby had always\r\nbeen beautiful; but her beauty had been of the earth, earthy; it had\r\nhad a certain insolent quality in it, as if it flaunted itself in the\r\nbeholder’s eye; spirit had never shone through it, intellect had never\r\nrefined it. But death had touched it and consecrated it, bringing out\r\ndelicate modelings and purity of outline never seen before—doing what\r\nlife and love and great sorrow and deep womanhood joys might have done\r\nfor Ruby. Anne, looking down through a mist of tears, at her old\r\nplayfellow, thought she saw the face God had meant Ruby to have, and\r\nremembered it so always.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gillis called Anne aside into a vacant room before the funeral\r\nprocession left the house, and gave her a small packet.\r\n\r\n“I want you to have this,” she sobbed. “Ruby would have liked you to\r\nhave it. It’s the embroidered centerpiece she was working at. It isn’t\r\nquite finished—the needle is sticking in it just where her poor little\r\nfingers put it the last time she laid it down, the afternoon before she\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\n“There’s always a piece of unfinished work left,” said Mrs. Lynde, with\r\ntears in her eyes. “But I suppose there’s always some one to finish\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“How difficult it is to realize that one we have always known can\r\nreally be dead,” said Anne, as she and Diana walked home. “Ruby is the\r\nfirst of our schoolmates to go. One by one, sooner or later, all the\r\nrest of us must follow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose so,” said Diana uncomfortably. She did not want to talk\r\nof that. She would have preferred to have discussed the details of the\r\nfuneral—the splendid white velvet casket Mr. Gillis had insisted on\r\nhaving for Ruby—“the Gillises must always make a splurge, even at\r\nfunerals,” quoth Mrs. Rachel Lynde—Herb Spencer’s sad face, the\r\nuncontrolled, hysteric grief of one of Ruby’s sisters—but Anne would\r\nnot talk of these things. She seemed wrapped in a reverie in which\r\nDiana felt lonesomely that she had neither lot nor part.\r\n\r\n“Ruby Gillis was a great girl to laugh,” said Davy suddenly. “Will she\r\nlaugh as much in heaven as she did in Avonlea, Anne? I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think she will,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anne,” protested Diana, with a rather shocked smile.\r\n\r\n“Well, why not, Diana?” asked Anne seriously. “Do you think we’ll never\r\nlaugh in heaven?”\r\n\r\n“Oh—I—I don’t know” floundered Diana. “It doesn’t seem just right,\r\nsomehow. You know it’s rather dreadful to laugh in church.”\r\n\r\n“But heaven won’t be like church—all the time,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“I hope it ain’t,” said Davy emphatically. “If it is I don’t want to\r\ngo. Church is awful dull. Anyway, I don’t mean to go for ever so long.\r\nI mean to live to be a hundred years old, like Mr. Thomas Blewett of\r\nWhite Sands. He says he’s lived so long ’cause he always smoked tobacco\r\nand it killed all the germs. Can I smoke tobacco pretty soon, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“No, Davy, I hope you’ll never use tobacco,” said Anne absently.\r\n\r\n“What’ll you feel like if the germs kill me then?” demanded Davy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\nA Dream Turned Upside Down\r\n\r\n\r\n“Just one more week and we go back to Redmond,” said Anne. She was\r\nhappy at the thought of returning to work, classes and Redmond friends.\r\nPleasing visions were also being woven around Patty’s Place. There was\r\na warm pleasant sense of home in the thought of it, even though she had\r\nnever lived there.\r\n\r\nBut the summer had been a very happy one, too—a time of glad living\r\nwith summer suns and skies, a time of keen delight in wholesome things;\r\na time of renewing and deepening of old friendships; a time in which\r\nshe had learned to live more nobly, to work more patiently, to play\r\nmore heartily.\r\n\r\n“All life lessons are not learned at college,” she thought. “Life\r\nteaches them everywhere.”\r\n\r\nBut alas, the final week of that pleasant vacation was spoiled for\r\nAnne, by one of those impish happenings which are like a dream turned\r\nupside down.\r\n\r\n“Been writing any more stories lately?” inquired Mr. Harrison genially\r\none evening when Anne was taking tea with him and Mrs. Harrison.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Anne, rather crisply.\r\n\r\n“Well, no offense meant. Mrs. Hiram Sloane told me the other day that a\r\nbig envelope addressed to the Rollings Reliable Baking Powder Company\r\nof Montreal had been dropped into the post office box a month ago, and\r\nshe suspicioned that somebody was trying for the prize they’d offered\r\nfor the best story that introduced the name of their baking powder. She\r\nsaid it wasn’t addressed in your writing, but I thought maybe it was\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no! I saw the prize offer, but I’d never dream of competing\r\nfor it. I think it would be perfectly disgraceful to write a story to\r\nadvertise a baking powder. It would be almost as bad as Judson Parker’s\r\npatent medicine fence.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Anne loftily, little dreaming of the valley of humiliation\r\nawaiting her. That very evening Diana popped into the porch gable,\r\nbright-eyed and rosy cheeked, carrying a letter.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anne, here’s a letter for you. I was at the office, so I thought\r\nI’d bring it along. Do open it quick. If it is what I believe it is I\r\nshall just be wild with delight.” Anne, puzzled, opened the letter and\r\nglanced over the typewritten contents.\r\n\r\nMiss Anne Shirley,\r\nGreen Gables,\r\nAvonlea, P.E. Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAR MADAM: We have much pleasure in informing you that your charming\r\nstory ‘Averil’s Atonement’ has won the prize of twenty-five dollars\r\noffered in our recent competition. We enclose the check herewith. We\r\nare arranging for the publication of the story in several prominent\r\nCanadian newspapers, and we also intend to have it printed in pamphlet\r\nform for distribution among our patrons. Thanking you for the interest\r\nyou have shown in our enterprise,\r\n\r\n“We remain,\r\n“Yours very truly,\r\n“THE ROLLINGS RELIABLE BAKING POWDER CO.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said Anne, blankly.\r\n\r\nDiana clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I _knew_ it would win the prize—I was sure of it. _I_ sent your\r\nstory into the competition, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Diana—Barry!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did,” said Diana gleefully, perching herself on the bed. “When\r\nI saw the offer I thought of your story in a minute, and at first I\r\nthought I’d ask you to send it in. But then I was afraid you\r\nwouldn’t—you had so little faith left in it. So I just decided I’d send\r\nthe copy you gave me, and say nothing about it. Then, if it didn’t win\r\nthe prize, you’d never know and you wouldn’t feel badly over it,\r\nbecause the stories that failed were not to be returned, and if it did\r\nyou’d have such a delightful surprise.”\r\n\r\nDiana was not the most discerning of mortals, but just at this moment\r\nit struck her that Anne was not looking exactly overjoyed. The surprise\r\nwas there, beyond doubt—but where was the delight?\r\n\r\n“Why, Anne, you don’t seem a bit pleased!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnne instantly manufactured a smile and put it on.\r\n\r\n“Of course I couldn’t be anything but pleased over your unselfish wish\r\nto give me pleasure,” she said slowly. “But you know—I’m so amazed—I\r\ncan’t realize it—and I don’t understand. There wasn’t a word in my\r\nstory about—about—” Anne choked a little over the word—“baking powder.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _I_ put that in,” said Diana, reassured. “It was as easy as\r\nwink—and of course my experience in our old Story Club helped me. You\r\nknow the scene where Averil makes the cake? Well, I just stated that\r\nshe used the Rollings Reliable in it, and that was why it turned out so\r\nwell; and then, in the last paragraph, where _Perceval_ clasps _Averil_\r\nin his arms and says, ‘Sweetheart, the beautiful coming years will\r\nbring us the fulfilment of our home of dreams,’ I added, ‘in which we\r\nwill never use any baking powder except Rollings Reliable.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” gasped poor Anne, as if some one had dashed cold water on her.\r\n\r\n“And you’ve won the twenty-five dollars,” continued Diana jubilantly.\r\n“Why, I heard Priscilla say once that the _Canadian Woman_ only pays\r\nfive dollars for a story!”\r\n\r\nAnne held out the hateful pink slip in shaking fingers.\r\n\r\n“I can’t take it—it’s yours by right, Diana. You sent the story in and\r\nmade the alterations. I—I would certainly never have sent it. So you\r\nmust take the check.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to see myself,” said Diana scornfully. “Why, what I did\r\nwasn’t any trouble. The honor of being a friend of the prizewinner is\r\nenough for me. Well, I must go. I should have gone straight home from\r\nthe post office for we have company. But I simply had to come and hear\r\nthe news. I’m so glad for your sake, Anne.”\r\n\r\nAnne suddenly bent forward, put her arms about Diana, and kissed her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n“I think you are the sweetest and truest friend in the world, Diana,”\r\nshe said, with a little tremble in her voice, “and I assure you I\r\nappreciate the motive of what you’ve done.”\r\n\r\nDiana, pleased and embarrassed, got herself away, and poor Anne, after\r\nflinging the innocent check into her bureau drawer as if it were\r\nblood-money, cast herself on her bed and wept tears of shame and\r\noutraged sensibility. Oh, she could never live this down—never!\r\n\r\nGilbert arrived at dusk, brimming over with congratulations, for he had\r\ncalled at Orchard Slope and heard the news. But his congratulations\r\ndied on his lips at sight of Anne’s face.\r\n\r\n“Why, Anne, what is the matter? I expected to find you radiant over\r\nwinning Rollings Reliable prize. Good for you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Gilbert, not you,” implored Anne, in an _et-tu Brute_ tone. “I\r\nthought _you_ would understand. Can’t you see how awful it is?”\r\n\r\n“I must confess I can’t. _What_ is wrong?”\r\n\r\n“Everything,” moaned Anne. “I feel as if I were disgraced forever. What\r\ndo you think a mother would feel like if she found her child tattooed\r\nover with a baking powder advertisement? I feel just the same. I loved\r\nmy poor little story, and I wrote it out of the best that was in me.\r\nAnd it is _sacrilege_ to have it degraded to the level of a baking\r\npowder advertisement. Don’t you remember what Professor Hamilton used\r\nto tell us in the literature class at Queen’s? He said we were never to\r\nwrite a word for a low or unworthy motive, but always to cling to the\r\nvery highest ideals. What will he think when he hears I’ve written a\r\nstory to advertise Rollings Reliable? And, oh, when it gets out at\r\nRedmond! Think how I’ll be teased and laughed at!”\r\n\r\n“That you won’t,” said Gilbert, wondering uneasily if it were that\r\nconfounded Junior’s opinion in particular over which Anne was worried.\r\n“The Reds will think just as I thought—that you, being like nine out of\r\nten of us, not overburdened with worldly wealth, had taken this way of\r\nearning an honest penny to help yourself through the year. I don’t see\r\nthat there’s anything low or unworthy about that, or anything\r\nridiculous either. One would rather write masterpieces of literature no\r\ndoubt—but meanwhile board and tuition fees have to be paid.”\r\n\r\nThis commonsense, matter-of-fact view of the case cheered Anne a\r\nlittle. At least it removed her dread of being laughed at, though the\r\ndeeper hurt of an outraged ideal remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\nAdjusted Relationships\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s the homiest spot I ever saw—it’s homier than home,” avowed\r\nPhilippa Gordon, looking about her with delighted eyes. They were all\r\nassembled at twilight in the big living-room at Patty’s Place—Anne and\r\nPriscilla, Phil and Stella, Aunt Jamesina, Rusty, Joseph, the\r\nSarah-Cat, and Gog and Magog. The firelight shadows were dancing over\r\nthe walls; the cats were purring; and a huge bowl of hothouse\r\nchrysanthemums, sent to Phil by one of the victims, shone through the\r\ngolden gloom like creamy moons.\r\n\r\nIt was three weeks since they had considered themselves settled, and\r\nalready all believed the experiment would be a success. The first\r\nfortnight after their return had been a pleasantly exciting one; they\r\nhad been busy setting up their household goods, organizing their little\r\nestablishment, and adjusting different opinions.\r\n\r\nAnne was not over-sorry to leave Avonlea when the time came to return\r\nto college. The last few days of her vacation had not been pleasant.\r\nHer prize story had been published in the Island papers; and Mr.\r\nWilliam Blair had, upon the counter of his store, a huge pile of pink,\r\ngreen and yellow pamphlets, containing it, one of which he gave to\r\nevery customer. He sent a complimentary bundle to Anne, who promptly\r\ndropped them all in the kitchen stove. Her humiliation was the\r\nconsequence of her own ideals only, for Avonlea folks thought it quite\r\nsplendid that she should have won the prize. Her many friends regarded\r\nher with honest admiration; her few foes with scornful envy. Josie Pye\r\nsaid she believed Anne Shirley had just copied the story; she was sure\r\nshe remembered reading it in a paper years before. The Sloanes, who had\r\nfound out or guessed that Charlie had been “turned down,” said they\r\ndidn’t think it was much to be proud of; almost any one could have done\r\nit, if she tried. Aunt Atossa told Anne she was very sorry to hear she\r\nhad taken to writing novels; nobody born and bred in Avonlea would do\r\nit; that was what came of adopting orphans from goodness knew where,\r\nwith goodness knew what kind of parents. Even Mrs. Rachel Lynde was\r\ndarkly dubious about the propriety of writing fiction, though she was\r\nalmost reconciled to it by that twenty-five dollar check.\r\n\r\n“It is perfectly amazing, the price they pay for such lies, that’s\r\nwhat,” she said, half-proudly, half-severely.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it was a relief when going-away time came. And\r\nit was very jolly to be back at Redmond, a wise, experienced Soph with\r\nhosts of friends to greet on the merry opening day. Pris and Stella and\r\nGilbert were there, Charlie Sloane, looking more important than ever a\r\nSophomore looked before, Phil, with the Alec-and-Alonzo question still\r\nunsettled, and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson. Moody Spurgeon had been\r\nteaching school ever since leaving Queen’s, but his mother had\r\nconcluded it was high time he gave it up and turned his attention to\r\nlearning how to be a minister. Poor Moody Spurgeon fell on hard luck at\r\nthe very beginning of his college career. Half a dozen ruthless Sophs,\r\nwho were among his fellow-boarders, swooped down upon him one night and\r\nshaved half of his head. In this guise the luckless Moody Spurgeon had\r\nto go about until his hair grew again. He told Anne bitterly that there\r\nwere times when he had his doubts as to whether he was really called to\r\nbe a minister.\r\n\r\nAunt Jamesina did not come until the girls had Patty’s Place ready for\r\nher. Miss Patty had sent the key to Anne, with a letter in which she\r\nsaid Gog and Magog were packed in a box under the spare-room bed, but\r\nmight be taken out when wanted; in a postscript she added that she\r\nhoped the girls would be careful about putting up pictures. The living\r\nroom had been newly papered five years before and she and Miss Maria\r\ndid not want any more holes made in that new paper than was absolutely\r\nnecessary. For the rest she trusted everything to Anne.\r\n\r\nHow those girls enjoyed putting their nest in order! As Phil said, it\r\nwas almost as good as getting married. You had the fun of homemaking\r\nwithout the bother of a husband. All brought something with them to\r\nadorn or make comfortable the little house. Pris and Phil and Stella\r\nhad knick-knacks and pictures galore, which latter they proceeded to\r\nhang according to taste, in reckless disregard of Miss Patty’s new\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“We’ll putty the holes up when we leave, dear—she’ll never know,” they\r\nsaid to protesting Anne.\r\n\r\nDiana had given Anne a pine needle cushion and Miss Ada had given both\r\nher and Priscilla a fearfully and wonderfully embroidered one. Marilla\r\nhad sent a big box of preserves, and darkly hinted at a hamper for\r\nThanksgiving, and Mrs. Lynde gave Anne a patchwork quilt and loaned her\r\nfive more.\r\n\r\n“You take them,” she said authoritatively. “They might as well be in\r\nuse as packed away in that trunk in the garret for moths to gnaw.”\r\n\r\nNo moths would ever have ventured near those quilts, for they reeked of\r\nmothballs to such an extent that they had to be hung in the orchard of\r\nPatty’s Place a full fortnight before they could be endured indoors.\r\nVerily, aristocratic Spofford Avenue had rarely beheld such a display.\r\nThe gruff old millionaire who lived “next door” came over and wanted to\r\nbuy the gorgeous red and yellow “tulip-pattern” one which Mrs. Rachel\r\nhad given Anne. He said his mother used to make quilts like that, and\r\nby Jove, he wanted one to remind him of her. Anne would not sell it,\r\nmuch to his disappointment, but she wrote all about it to Mrs. Lynde.\r\nThat highly-gratified lady sent word back that she had one just like it\r\nto spare, so the tobacco king got his quilt after all, and insisted on\r\nhaving it spread on his bed, to the disgust of his fashionable wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde’s quilts served a very useful purpose that winter. Patty’s\r\nPlace for all its many virtues, had its faults also. It was really a\r\nrather cold house; and when the frosty nights came the girls were very\r\nglad to snuggle down under Mrs. Lynde’s quilts, and hoped that the loan\r\nof them might be accounted unto her for righteousness. Anne had the\r\nblue room she had coveted at sight. Priscilla and Stella had the large\r\none. Phil was blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen;\r\nand Aunt Jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the living-room.\r\nRusty at first slept on the doorstep.\r\n\r\nAnne, walking home from Redmond a few days after her return, became\r\naware that the people that she met surveyed her with a covert,\r\nindulgent smile. Anne wondered uneasily what was the matter with her.\r\nWas her hat crooked? Was her belt loose? Craning her head to\r\ninvestigate, Anne, for the first time, saw Rusty.\r\n\r\nTrotting along behind her, close to her heels, was quite the most\r\nforlorn specimen of the cat tribe she had ever beheld. The animal was\r\nwell past kitten-hood, lank, thin, disreputable looking. Pieces of both\r\nears were lacking, one eye was temporarily out of repair, and one jowl\r\nludicrously swollen. As for color, if a once black cat had been well\r\nand thoroughly singed the result would have resembled the hue of this\r\nwaif’s thin, draggled, unsightly fur.\r\n\r\nAnne “shooed,” but the cat would not “shoo.” As long as she stood he\r\nsat back on his haunches and gazed at her reproachfully out of his one\r\ngood eye; when she resumed her walk he followed. Anne resigned herself\r\nto his company until she reached the gate of Patty’s Place, which she\r\ncoldly shut in his face, fondly supposing she had seen the last of him.\r\nBut when, fifteen minutes later, Phil opened the door, there sat the\r\nrusty-brown cat on the step. More, he promptly darted in and sprang\r\nupon Anne’s lap with a half-pleading, half-triumphant “miaow.”\r\n\r\n“Anne,” said Stella severely, “do you own that animal?”\r\n\r\n“No, I do _not_,” protested disgusted Anne. “The creature followed me\r\nhome from somewhere. I couldn’t get rid of him. Ugh, get down. I like\r\ndecent cats reasonably well; but I don’t like beasties of your\r\ncomplexion.”\r\n\r\nPussy, however, refused to get down. He coolly curled up in Anne’s lap\r\nand began to purr.\r\n\r\n“He has evidently adopted you,” laughed Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“I won’t BE adopted,” said Anne stubbornly.\r\n\r\n“The poor creature is starving,” said Phil pityingly. “Why, his bones\r\nare almost coming through his skin.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll give him a square meal and then he must return to whence he\r\ncame,” said Anne resolutely.\r\n\r\nThe cat was fed and put out. In the morning he was still on the\r\ndoorstep. On the doorstep he continued to sit, bolting in whenever the\r\ndoor was opened. No coolness of welcome had the least effect on him; of\r\nnobody save Anne did he take the least notice. Out of compassion the\r\ngirls fed him; but when a week had passed they decided that something\r\nmust be done. The cat’s appearance had improved. His eye and cheek had\r\nresumed their normal appearance; he was not quite so thin; and he had\r\nbeen seen washing his face.\r\n\r\n“But for all that we can’t keep him,” said Stella. “Aunt Jimsie is\r\ncoming next week and she will bring the Sarah-cat with her. We can’t\r\nkeep two cats; and if we did this Rusty Coat would fight all the time\r\nwith the Sarah-cat. He’s a fighter by nature. He had a pitched battle\r\nlast evening with the tobacco-king’s cat and routed him, horse, foot\r\nand artillery.”\r\n\r\n“We must get rid of him,” agreed Anne, looking darkly at the subject of\r\ntheir discussion, who was purring on the hearth rug with an air of\r\nlamb-like meekness. “But the question is—how? How can four unprotected\r\nfemales get rid of a cat who won’t be got rid of?”\r\n\r\n“We must chloroform him,” said Phil briskly. “That is the most humane\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Who of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat?” demanded Anne\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\n“I do, honey. It’s one of my few—sadly few—useful accomplishments. I’ve\r\ndisposed of several at home. You take the cat in the morning and give\r\nhim a good breakfast. Then you take an old burlap bag—there’s one in\r\nthe back porch—put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box. Then\r\ntake a two-ounce bottle of chloroform, uncork it, and slip it under the\r\nedge of the box. Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till\r\nevening. The cat will be dead, curled up peacefully as if he were\r\nasleep. No pain—no struggle.”\r\n\r\n“It sounds easy,” said Anne dubiously.\r\n\r\n“It _is_ easy. Just leave it to me. I’ll see to it,” said Phil\r\nreassuringly.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the chloroform was procured, and the next morning Rusty was\r\nlured to his doom. He ate his breakfast, licked his chops, and climbed\r\ninto Anne’s lap. Anne’s heart misgave her. This poor creature loved\r\nher—trusted her. How could she be a party to this destruction?\r\n\r\n“Here, take him,” she said hastily to Phil. “I feel like a murderess.”\r\n\r\n“He won’t suffer, you know,” comforted Phil, but Anne had fled.\r\n\r\nThe fatal deed was done in the back porch. Nobody went near it that\r\nday. But at dusk Phil declared that Rusty must be buried.\r\n\r\n“Pris and Stella must dig his grave in the orchard,” declared Phil,\r\n“and Anne must come with me to lift the box off. That’s the part I\r\nalways hate.”\r\n\r\nThe two conspirators tip-toed reluctantly to the back porch. Phil\r\ngingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box. Suddenly, faint but\r\ndistinct, sounded an unmistakable mew under the box.\r\n\r\n“He—he isn’t dead,” gasped Anne, sitting blankly down on the kitchen\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\n“He must be,” said Phil incredulously.\r\n\r\nAnother tiny mew proved that he wasn’t. The two girls stared at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“What will we do?” questioned Anne.\r\n\r\n“Why in the world don’t you come?” demanded Stella, appearing in the\r\ndoorway. “We’ve got the grave ready. ‘What silent still and silent\r\nall?’” she quoted teasingly.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, no, the voices of the dead Sound like the distant torrent’s\r\nfall,’” promptly counter-quoted Anne, pointing solemnly to the box.\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter broke the tension.\r\n\r\n“We must leave him here till morning,” said Phil, replacing the stone.\r\n“He hasn’t mewed for five minutes. Perhaps the mews we heard were his\r\ndying groan. Or perhaps we merely imagined them, under the strain of\r\nour guilty consciences.”\r\n\r\nBut, when the box was lifted in the morning, Rusty bounded at one gay\r\nleap to Anne’s shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately.\r\nNever was there a cat more decidedly alive.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a knot hole in the box,” groaned Phil. “I never saw it. That’s\r\nwhy he didn’t die. Now, we’ve got to do it all over again.”\r\n\r\n“No, we haven’t,” declared Anne suddenly. “Rusty isn’t going to be\r\nkilled again. He’s my cat—and you’ve just got to make the best of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, if you’ll settle with Aunt Jimsie and the Sarah-cat,” said\r\nStella, with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair.\r\n\r\nFrom that time Rusty was one of the family. He slept o’nights on the\r\nscrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land.\r\nBy the time Aunt Jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably\r\nrespectable. But, like Kipling’s cat, he “walked by himself.” His paw\r\nwas against every cat, and every cat’s paw against him. One by one he\r\nvanquished the aristocratic felines of Spofford Avenue. As for human\r\nbeings, he loved Anne and Anne alone. Nobody else even dared stroke\r\nhim. An angry spit and something that sounded much like very improper\r\nlanguage greeted any one who did.\r\n\r\n“The airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable,” declared Stella.\r\n\r\n“Him was a nice old pussens, him was,” vowed Anne, cuddling her pet\r\ndefiantly.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know how he and the Sarah-cat will ever make out to live\r\ntogether,” said Stella pesimistically. “Cat-fights in the orchard\r\no’nights are bad enough. But cat-fights here in the livingroom are\r\nunthinkable.” In due time Aunt Jamesina arrived. Anne and Priscilla and\r\nPhil had awaited her advent rather dubiously; but when Aunt Jamesina\r\nwas enthroned in the rocking chair before the open fire they\r\nfiguratively bowed down and worshipped her.\r\n\r\nAunt Jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little, softly-triangular\r\nface, and large, soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable\r\nyouth, and as full of hopes as a girl’s. She had pink cheeks and\r\nsnow-white hair which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very old-fashioned way,” she said, knitting industriously at\r\nsomething as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud. “But _I_ am\r\nold-fashioned. My clothes are, and it stands to reason my opinions are,\r\ntoo. I don’t say they’re any the better of that, mind you. In fact, I\r\ndaresay they’re a good deal the worse. But they’ve worn nice and easy.\r\nNew shoes are smarter than old ones, but the old ones are more\r\ncomfortable. I’m old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes\r\nand opinions. I mean to take it real easy here. I know you expect me to\r\nlook after you and keep you proper, but I’m not going to do it. You’re\r\nold enough to know how to behave if you’re ever going to be. So, as far\r\nas I am concerned,” concluded Aunt Jamesina, with a twinkle in her\r\nyoung eyes, “you can all go to destruction in your own way.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, will somebody separate those cats?” pleaded Stella, shudderingly.\r\n\r\nAunt Jamesina had brought with her not only the Sarah-cat but Joseph.\r\nJoseph, she explained, had belonged to a dear friend of hers who had\r\ngone to live in Vancouver.\r\n\r\n“She couldn’t take Joseph with her so she begged me to take him. I\r\nreally couldn’t refuse. He’s a beautiful cat—that is, his disposition\r\nis beautiful. She called him Joseph because his coat is of many\r\ncolors.”\r\n\r\nIt certainly was. Joseph, as the disgusted Stella said, looked like a\r\nwalking rag-bag. It was impossible to say what his ground color was.\r\nHis legs were white with black spots on them. His back was gray with a\r\nhuge patch of yellow on one side and a black patch on the other. His\r\ntail was yellow with a gray tip. One ear was black and one yellow. A\r\nblack patch over one eye gave him a fearfully rakish look. In reality\r\nhe was meek and inoffensive, of a sociable disposition. In one respect,\r\nif in no other, Joseph was like a lily of the field. He toiled not\r\nneither did he spin or catch mice. Yet Solomon in all his glory slept\r\nnot on softer cushions, or feasted more fully on fat things.\r\n\r\nJoseph and the Sarah-cat arrived by express in separate boxes. After\r\nthey had been released and fed, Joseph selected the cushion and corner\r\nwhich appealed to him, and the Sarah-cat gravely sat herself down\r\nbefore the fire and proceeded to wash her face. She was a large, sleek,\r\ngray-and-white cat, with an enormous dignity which was not at all\r\nimpaired by any consciousness of her plebian origin. She had been given\r\nto Aunt Jamesina by her washerwoman.\r\n\r\n“Her name was Sarah, so my husband always called puss the Sarah-cat,”\r\nexplained Aunt Jamesina. “She is eight years old, and a remarkable\r\nmouser. Don’t worry, Stella. The Sarah-cat _never_ fights and Joseph\r\nrarely.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll have to fight here in self-defense,” said Stella.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Rusty arrived on the scene. He bounded joyously half\r\nway across the room before he saw the intruders. Then he stopped short;\r\nhis tail expanded until it was as big as three tails. The fur on his\r\nback rose up in a defiant arch; Rusty lowered his head, uttered a\r\nfearful shriek of hatred and defiance, and launched himself at the\r\nSarah-cat.\r\n\r\nThe stately animal had stopped washing her face and was looking at him\r\ncuriously. She met his onslaught with one contemptuous sweep of her\r\ncapable paw. Rusty went rolling helplessly over on the rug; he picked\r\nhimself up dazedly. What sort of a cat was this who had boxed his ears?\r\nHe looked dubiously at the Sarah-cat. Would he or would he not? The\r\nSarah-cat deliberately turned her back on him and resumed her toilet\r\noperations. Rusty decided that he would not. He never did. From that\r\ntime on the Sarah-cat ruled the roost. Rusty never again interfered\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nBut Joseph rashly sat up and yawned. Rusty, burning to avenge his\r\ndisgrace, swooped down upon him. Joseph, pacific by nature, could fight\r\nupon occasion and fight well. The result was a series of drawn battles.\r\nEvery day Rusty and Joseph fought at sight. Anne took Rusty’s part and\r\ndetested Joseph. Stella was in despair. But Aunt Jamesina only laughed.\r\n\r\n“Let them fight it out,” she said tolerantly. “They’ll make friends\r\nafter a bit. Joseph needs some exercise—he was getting too fat. And\r\nRusty has to learn he isn’t the only cat in the world.”\r\n\r\nEventually Joseph and Rusty accepted the situation and from sworn\r\nenemies became sworn friends. They slept on the same cushion with their\r\npaws about each other, and gravely washed each other’s faces.\r\n\r\n“We’ve all got used to each other,” said Phil. “And I’ve learned how to\r\nwash dishes and sweep a floor.”\r\n\r\n“But you needn’t try to make us believe you can chloroform a cat,”\r\nlaughed Anne.\r\n\r\n“It was all the fault of the knothole,” protested Phil.\r\n\r\n“It was a good thing the knothole was there,” said Aunt Jamesina rather\r\nseverely. “Kittens _have_ to be drowned, I admit, or the world would be\r\noverrun. But no decent, grown-up cat should be done to death—unless he\r\nsucks eggs.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t have thought Rusty very decent if you’d seen him when he\r\ncame here,” said Stella. “He positively looked like the Old Nick.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe Old Nick can be so very ugly,” said Aunt Jamesina\r\nreflectively. “He wouldn’t do so much harm if he was. _I_ always think\r\nof him as a rather handsome gentleman.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\nA Letter from Davy\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s beginning to snow, girls,” said Phil, coming in one November\r\nevening, “and there are the loveliest little stars and crosses all over\r\nthe garden walk. I never noticed before what exquisite things\r\nsnowflakes really are. One has time to notice things like that in the\r\nsimple life. Bless you all for permitting me to live it. It’s really\r\ndelightful to feel worried because butter has gone up five cents a\r\npound.”\r\n\r\n“Has it?” demanded Stella, who kept the household accounts.\r\n\r\n“It has—and here’s your butter. I’m getting quite expert at marketing.\r\nIt’s better fun than flirting,” concluded Phil gravely.\r\n\r\n“Everything is going up scandalously,” sighed Stella.\r\n\r\n“Never mind. Thank goodness air and salvation are still free,” said\r\nAunt Jamesina.\r\n\r\n“And so is laughter,” added Anne. “There’s no tax on it yet and that is\r\nwell, because you’re all going to laugh presently. I’m going to read\r\nyou Davy’s letter. His spelling has improved immensely this past year,\r\nthough he is not strong on apostrophes, and he certainly possesses the\r\ngift of writing an interesting letter. Listen and laugh, before we\r\nsettle down to the evening’s study-grind.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Anne,” ran Davy’s letter, “I take my pen to tell you that we are\r\nall pretty well and hope this will find you the same. It’s snowing some\r\ntoday and Marilla says the old woman in the sky is shaking her feather\r\nbeds. Is the old woman in the sky God’s wife, Anne? I want to know.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Lynde has been real sick but she is better now. She fell down the\r\ncellar stairs last week. When she fell she grabbed hold of the shelf\r\nwith all the milk pails and stewpans on it, and it gave way and went\r\ndown with her and made a splendid crash. Marilla thought it was an\r\nearthquake at first.\r\n\r\n“One of the stewpans was all dinged up and Mrs. Lynde straned her ribs.\r\nThe doctor came and gave her medicine to rub on her ribs but she didn’t\r\nunder stand him and took it all inside instead. The doctor said it was\r\na wonder it dident kill her but it dident and it cured her ribs and\r\nMrs. Lynde says doctors dont know much anyhow. But we couldent fix up\r\nthe stewpan. Marilla had to throw it out. Thanksgiving was last week.\r\nThere was no school and we had a great dinner. I et mince pie and rost\r\nturkey and frut cake and donuts and cheese and jam and choklut cake.\r\nMarilla said I’d die but I dident. Dora had earake after it, only it\r\nwasent in her ears it was in her stummick. I dident have earake\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n“Our new teacher is a man. He does things for jokes. Last week he made\r\nall us third-class boys write a composishun on what kind of a wife we’d\r\nlike to have and the girls on what kind of a husband. He laughed fit to\r\nkill when he read them. This was mine. I thought youd like to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘The kind of a wife I’d like to Have.\r\n\r\n“‘She must have good manners and get my meals on time and do what I\r\ntell her and always be very polite to me. She must be fifteen yers old.\r\nShe must be good to the poor and keep her house tidy and be good\r\ntempered and go to church regularly. She must be very handsome and have\r\ncurly hair. If I get a wife that is just what I like Ill be an awful\r\ngood husband to her. I think a woman ought to be awful good to her\r\nhusband. Some poor women haven’t any husbands.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘THE END.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was at Mrs. Isaac Wrights funeral at White Sands last week. The\r\nhusband of the corpse felt real sorry. Mrs. Lynde says Mrs. Wrights\r\ngrandfather stole a sheep but Marilla says we mustent speak ill of the\r\ndead. Why mustent we, Anne? I want to know. It’s pretty safe, ain’t it?\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Lynde was awful mad the other day because I asked her if she was\r\nalive in Noah’s time. I dident mean to hurt her feelings. I just wanted\r\nto know. Was she, Anne?\r\n\r\n“Mr. Harrison wanted to get rid of his dog. So he hunged him once but\r\nhe come to life and scooted for the barn while Mr. Harrison was digging\r\nthe grave, so he hunged him again and he stayed dead that time. Mr.\r\nHarrison has a new man working for him. He’s awful okward. Mr. Harrison\r\nsays he is left handed in both his feet. Mr. Barry’s hired man is lazy.\r\nMrs. Barry says that but Mr. Barry says he aint lazy exactly only he\r\nthinks it easier to pray for things than to work for them.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Harmon Andrews prize pig that she talked so much of died in a\r\nfit. Mrs. Lynde says it was a judgment on her for pride. But I think it\r\nwas hard on the pig. Milty Boulter has been sick. The doctor gave him\r\nmedicine and it tasted horrid. I offered to take it for him for a\r\nquarter but the Boulters are so mean. Milty says he’d rather take it\r\nhimself and save his money. I asked Mrs. Boulter how a person would go\r\nabout catching a man and she got awful mad and said she dident know,\r\nshed never chased men.\r\n\r\n“The A.V.I.S. is going to paint the hall again. They’re tired of having\r\nit blue.\r\n\r\n“The new minister was here to tea last night. He took three pieces of\r\npie. If I did that Mrs. Lynde would call me piggy. And he et fast and\r\ntook big bites and Marilla is always telling me not to do that. Why can\r\nministers do what boys can’t? I want to know.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t any more news. Here are six kisses. xxxxxx. Dora sends one.\r\nHeres hers. x.\r\n\r\n“Your loving friend\r\nDAVID KEITH”\r\n\r\n\r\n“P.S. Anne, who was the devils father? I want to know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\nMiss Josephine Remembers the Anne-girl\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Christmas holidays came the girls of Patty’s Place scattered to\r\ntheir respective homes, but Aunt Jamesina elected to stay where she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t go to any of the places I’ve been invited and take those\r\nthree cats,” she said. “And I’m not going to leave the poor creatures\r\nhere alone for nearly three weeks. If we had any decent neighbors who\r\nwould feed them I might, but there’s nothing except millionaires on\r\nthis street. So I’ll stay here and keep Patty’s Place warm for you.”\r\n\r\nAnne went home with the usual joyous anticipations—which were not\r\nwholly fulfilled. She found Avonlea in the grip of such an early, cold,\r\nand stormy winter as even the “oldest inhabitant” could not recall.\r\nGreen Gables was literally hemmed in by huge drifts. Almost every day\r\nof that ill-starred vacation it stormed fiercely; and even on fine days\r\nit drifted unceasingly. No sooner were the roads broken than they\r\nfilled in again. It was almost impossible to stir out. The A.V.I.S.\r\ntried, on three evenings, to have a party in honor of the college\r\nstudents, and on each evening the storm was so wild that nobody could\r\ngo, so they gave up the attempt in despair. Anne, despite her love of\r\nand loyalty to Green Gables, could not help thinking longingly of\r\nPatty’s Place, its cosy open fire, Aunt Jamesina’s mirthful eyes, the\r\nthree cats, the merry chatter of the girls, the pleasantness of Friday\r\nevenings when college friends dropped in to talk of grave and gay.\r\n\r\nAnne was lonely; Diana, during the whole of the holidays, was\r\nimprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis. She could not come\r\nto Green Gables and it was rarely Anne could get to Orchard Slope, for\r\nthe old way through the Haunted Wood was impassable with drifts, and\r\nthe long way over the frozen Lake of Shining Waters was almost as bad.\r\nRuby Gillis was sleeping in the white-heaped graveyard; Jane Andrews\r\nwas teaching a school on western prairies. Gilbert, to be sure, was\r\nstill faithful, and waded up to Green Gables every possible evening.\r\nBut Gilbert’s visits were not what they once were. Anne almost dreaded\r\nthem. It was very disconcerting to look up in the midst of a sudden\r\nsilence and find Gilbert’s hazel eyes fixed upon her with a quite\r\nunmistakable expression in their grave depths; and it was still more\r\ndisconcerting to find herself blushing hotly and uncomfortably under\r\nhis gaze, just as if—just as if—well, it was very embarrassing. Anne\r\nwished herself back at Patty’s Place, where there was always somebody\r\nelse about to take the edge off a delicate situation. At Green Gables\r\nMarilla went promptly to Mrs. Lynde’s domain when Gilbert came and\r\ninsisted on taking the twins with her. The significance of this was\r\nunmistakable and Anne was in a helpless fury over it.\r\n\r\nDavy, however, was perfectly happy. He reveled in getting out in the\r\nmorning and shoveling out the paths to the well and henhouse. He\r\ngloried in the Christmas-tide delicacies which Marilla and Mrs. Lynde\r\nvied with each other in preparing for Anne, and he was reading an\r\nenthralling tale, in a school library book, of a wonderful hero who\r\nseemed blessed with a miraculous faculty for getting into scrapes from\r\nwhich he was usually delivered by an earthquake or a volcanic\r\nexplosion, which blew him high and dry out of his troubles, landed him\r\nin a fortune, and closed the story with proper _éclat_.\r\n\r\n“I tell you it’s a bully story, Anne,” he said ecstatically. “I’d ever\r\nso much rather read it than the Bible.”\r\n\r\n“Would you?” smiled Anne.\r\n\r\nDavy peered curiously at her.\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem a bit shocked, Anne. Mrs. Lynde was awful shocked when\r\nI said it to her.”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not shocked, Davy. I think it’s quite natural that a\r\nnine-year-old boy would sooner read an adventure story than the Bible.\r\nBut when you are older I hope and think that you will realize what a\r\nwonderful book the Bible is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think some parts of it are fine,” conceded Davy. “That story\r\nabout Joseph now—it’s bully. But if I’d been Joseph _I_ wouldn’t have\r\nforgive the brothers. No, siree, Anne. I’d have cut all their heads\r\noff. Mrs. Lynde was awful mad when I said that and shut the Bible up\r\nand said she’d never read me any more of it if I talked like that. So I\r\ndon’t talk now when she reads it Sunday afternoons; I just think things\r\nand say them to Milty Boulter next day in school. I told Milty the\r\nstory about Elisha and the bears and it scared him so he’s never made\r\nfun of Mr. Harrison’s bald head once. Are there any bears on P.E.\r\nIsland, Anne? I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Not nowadays,” said Anne, absently, as the wind blew a scud of snow\r\nagainst the window. “Oh, dear, will it ever stop storming.”\r\n\r\n“God knows,” said Davy airily, preparing to resume his reading.\r\n\r\nAnne _was_ shocked this time.\r\n\r\n“Davy!” she exclaimed reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Lynde says that,” protested Davy. “One night last week Marilla\r\nsaid ‘Will Ludovic Speed and Theodora Dix _ever_ get married?” and Mrs.\r\nLynde said, “‘God knows’—just like that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it wasn’t right for her to say it,” said Anne, promptly deciding\r\nupon which horn of this dilemma to empale herself. “It isn’t right for\r\nanybody to take that name in vain or speak it lightly, Davy. Don’t ever\r\ndo it again.”\r\n\r\n“Not if I say it slow and solemn, like the minister?” queried Davy\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n“No, not even then.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t. Ludovic Speed and Theodora Dix live in Middle Grafton\r\nand Mrs. Rachel says he has been courting her for a hundred years.\r\nWon’t they soon be too old to get married, Anne? I hope Gilbert won’t\r\ncourt _you_ that long. When are you going to be married, Anne? Mrs.\r\nLynde says it’s a sure thing.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Lynde is a—” began Anne hotly; then stopped. “Awful old gossip,”\r\ncompleted Davy calmly. “That’s what every one calls her. But is it a\r\nsure thing, Anne? I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a very silly little boy, Davy,” said Anne, stalking haughtily\r\nout of the room. The kitchen was deserted and she sat down by the\r\nwindow in the fast falling wintry twilight. The sun had set and the\r\nwind had died down. A pale chilly moon looked out behind a bank of\r\npurple clouds in the west. The sky faded out, but the strip of yellow\r\nalong the western horizon grew brighter and fiercer, as if all the\r\nstray gleams of light were concentrating in one spot; the distant\r\nhills, rimmed with priest-like firs, stood out in dark distinctness\r\nagainst it. Anne looked across the still, white fields, cold and\r\nlifeless in the harsh light of that grim sunset, and sighed. She was\r\nvery lonely; and she was sad at heart; for she was wondering if she\r\nwould be able to return to Redmond next year. It did not seem likely.\r\nThe only scholarship possible in the Sophomore year was a very small\r\naffair. She would not take Marilla’s money; and there seemed little\r\nprospect of being able to earn enough in the summer vacation.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I’ll just have to drop out next year,” she thought drearily,\r\n“and teach a district school again until I earn enough to finish my\r\ncourse. And by that time all my old class will have graduated and\r\nPatty’s Place will be out of the question. But there! I’m not going to\r\nbe a coward. I’m thankful I can earn my way through if necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s Mr. Harrison wading up the lane,” announced Davy, running out.\r\n“I hope he’s brought the mail. It’s three days since we got it. I want\r\nto see what them pesky Grits are doing. I’m a Conservative, Anne. And I\r\ntell you, you have to keep your eye on them Grits.”\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison had brought the mail, and merry letters from Stella and\r\nPriscilla and Phil soon dissipated Anne’s blues. Aunt Jamesina, too,\r\nhad written, saying that she was keeping the hearth-fire alight, and\r\nthat the cats were all well, and the house plants doing fine.\r\n\r\n“The weather has been real cold,” she wrote, “so I let the cats sleep\r\nin the house—Rusty and Joseph on the sofa in the living-room, and the\r\nSarah-cat on the foot of my bed. It’s real company to hear her purring\r\nwhen I wake up in the night and think of my poor daughter in the\r\nforeign field. If it was anywhere but in India I wouldn’t worry, but\r\nthey say the snakes out there are terrible. It takes all the\r\nSarah-cats’s purring to drive away the thought of those snakes. I have\r\nenough faith for everything but the snakes. I can’t think why\r\nProvidence ever made them. Sometimes I don’t think He did. I’m inclined\r\nto believe the Old Harry had a hand in making _them_.”\r\n\r\nAnne had left a thin, typewritten communication till the last, thinking\r\nit unimportant. When she had read it she sat very still, with tears in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Anne?” asked Marilla.\r\n\r\n“Miss Josephine Barry is dead,” said Anne, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“So she has gone at last,” said Marilla. “Well, she has been sick for\r\nover a year, and the Barrys have been expecting to hear of her death\r\nany time. It is well she is at rest for she has suffered dreadfully,\r\nAnne. She was always kind to you.”\r\n\r\n“She has been kind to the last, Marilla. This letter is from her\r\nlawyer. She has left me a thousand dollars in her will.”\r\n\r\n“Gracious, ain’t that an awful lot of money,” exclaimed Davy. “She’s\r\nthe woman you and Diana lit on when you jumped into the spare room bed,\r\nain’t she? Diana told me that story. Is that why she left you so much?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Davy,” said Anne gently. She slipped away to the porch gable\r\nwith a full heart, leaving Marilla and Mrs. Lynde to talk over the news\r\nto their hearts’ content.\r\n\r\n“Do you s’pose Anne will ever get married now?” speculated Davy\r\nanxiously. “When Dorcas Sloane got married last summer she said if\r\nshe’d had enough money to live on she’d never have been bothered with a\r\nman, but even a widower with eight children was better’n living with a\r\nsister-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“Davy Keith, do hold your tongue,” said Mrs. Rachel severely. “The way\r\nyou talk is scandalous for a small boy, that’s what.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\nAn Interlude\r\n\r\n\r\n“To think that this is my twentieth birthday, and that I’ve left my\r\nteens behind me forever,” said Anne, who was curled up on the\r\nhearth-rug with Rusty in her lap, to Aunt Jamesina who was reading in\r\nher pet chair. They were alone in the living room. Stella and Priscilla\r\nhad gone to a committee meeting and Phil was upstairs adorning herself\r\nfor a party.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you feel kind of, sorry” said Aunt Jamesina. “The teens are\r\nsuch a nice part of life. I’m glad I’ve never gone out of them myself.”\r\n\r\nAnne laughed.\r\n\r\n“You never will, Aunty. You’ll be eighteen when you should be a\r\nhundred. Yes, I’m sorry, and a little dissatisfied as well. Miss Stacy\r\ntold me long ago that by the time I was twenty my character would be\r\nformed, for good or evil. I don’t feel that it’s what it should be.\r\nIt’s full of flaws.”\r\n\r\n“So’s everybody’s,” said Aunt Jamesina cheerfully. “Mine’s cracked in a\r\nhundred places. Your Miss Stacy likely meant that when you are twenty\r\nyour character would have got its permanent bent in one direction or\r\n’tother, and would go on developing in that line. Don’t worry over it,\r\nAnne. Do your duty by God and your neighbor and yourself, and have a\r\ngood time. That’s my philosophy and it’s always worked pretty well.\r\nWhere’s Phil off to tonight?”\r\n\r\n“She’s going to a dance, and she’s got the sweetest dress for it—creamy\r\nyellow silk and cobwebby lace. It just suits those brown tints of\r\nhers.”\r\n\r\n“There’s magic in the words ‘silk’ and ‘lace,’ isn’t there?” said Aunt\r\nJamesina. “The very sound of them makes me feel like skipping off to a\r\ndance. And _yellow_ silk. It makes one think of a dress of sunshine. I\r\nalways wanted a yellow silk dress, but first my mother and then my\r\nhusband wouldn’t hear of it. The very first thing I’m going to do when\r\nI get to heaven is to get a yellow silk dress.”\r\n\r\nAmid Anne’s peal of laughter Phil came downstairs, trailing clouds of\r\nglory, and surveyed herself in the long oval mirror on the wall.\r\n\r\n“A flattering looking glass is a promoter of amiability,” she said.\r\n“The one in my room does certainly make me green. Do I look pretty\r\nnice, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Do you really know how pretty you are, Phil?” asked Anne, in honest\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n“Of course I do. What are looking glasses and men for? That wasn’t what\r\nI meant. Are all my ends tucked in? Is my skirt straight? And would\r\nthis rose look better lower down? I’m afraid it’s too high—it will make\r\nme look lop-sided. But I hate things tickling my ears.”\r\n\r\n“Everything is just right, and that southwest dimple of yours is\r\nlovely.”\r\n\r\n“Anne, there’s one thing in particular I like about you—you’re so\r\nungrudging. There isn’t a particle of envy in you.”\r\n\r\n“Why should she be envious?” demanded Aunt Jamesina. “She’s not quite\r\nas goodlooking as you, maybe, but she’s got a far handsomer nose.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” conceded Phil.\r\n\r\n“My nose always has been a great comfort to me,” confessed Anne.\r\n\r\n“And I love the way your hair grows on your forehead, Anne. And that\r\none wee curl, always looking as if it were going to drop, but never\r\ndropping, is delicious. But as for noses, mine is a dreadful worry to\r\nme. I know by the time I’m forty it will be Byrney. What do you think\r\nI’ll look like when I’m forty, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Like an old, matronly, married woman,” teased Anne.\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” said Phil, sitting down comfortably to wait for her escort.\r\n“Joseph, you calico beastie, don’t you dare jump on my lap. I won’t go\r\nto a dance all over cat hairs. No, Anne, I _won’t_ look matronly. But\r\nno doubt I’ll be married.”\r\n\r\n“To Alec or Alonzo?” asked Anne.\r\n\r\n“To one of them, I suppose,” sighed Phil, “if I can ever decide which.”\r\n\r\n“It shouldn’t be hard to decide,” scolded Aunt Jamesina.\r\n\r\n“I was born a see-saw Aunty, and nothing can ever prevent me from\r\nteetering.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to be more levelheaded, Philippa.”\r\n\r\n“It’s best to be levelheaded, of course,” agreed Philippa, “but you\r\nmiss lots of fun. As for Alec and Alonzo, if you knew them you’d\r\nunderstand why it’s difficult to choose between them. They’re equally\r\nnice.”\r\n\r\n“Then take somebody who is nicer” suggested Aunt Jamesina. “There’s\r\nthat Senior who is so devoted to you—Will Leslie. He has such nice,\r\nlarge, mild eyes.”\r\n\r\n“They’re a little bit too large and too mild—like a cow’s,” said Phil\r\ncruelly.\r\n\r\n“What do you say about George Parker?”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing to say about him except that he always looks as if he\r\nhad just been starched and ironed.”\r\n\r\n“Marr Holworthy then. You can’t find a fault with him.”\r\n\r\n“No, he would do if he wasn’t poor. I must marry a rich man, Aunt\r\nJamesina. That—and good looks—is an indispensable qualification. I’d\r\nmarry Gilbert Blythe if he were rich.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, would you?” said Anne, rather viciously.\r\n\r\n“We don’t like that idea a little bit, although we don’t want Gilbert\r\nourselves, oh, no,” mocked Phil. “But don’t let’s talk of disagreeable\r\nsubjects. I’ll have to marry sometime, I suppose, but I shall put off\r\nthe evil day as long as I can.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t marry anybody you don’t love, Phil, when all’s said and\r\ndone,” said Aunt Jamesina.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, hearts that loved in the good old way\r\nHave been out o’ the fashion this many a day.’”\r\n\r\n\r\ntrilled Phil mockingly. “There’s the carriage. I fly—Bi-bi, you two\r\nold-fashioned darlings.”\r\n\r\nWhen Phil had gone Aunt Jamesina looked solemnly at Anne.\r\n\r\n“That girl is pretty and sweet and goodhearted, but do you think she is\r\nquite right in her mind, by spells, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t think there’s anything the matter with Phil’s mind,” said\r\nAnne, hiding a smile. “It’s just her way of talking.”\r\n\r\nAunt Jamesina shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Well, I hope so, Anne. I do hope so, because I love her. But _I_ can’t\r\nunderstand her—she beats me. She isn’t like any of the girls I ever\r\nknew, or any of the girls I was myself.”\r\n\r\n“How many girls were you, Aunt Jimsie?”\r\n\r\n“About half a dozen, my dear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\nGilbert Speaks\r\n\r\n\r\n“This has been a dull, prosy day,” yawned Phil, stretching herself idly\r\non the sofa, having previously dispossessed two exceedingly indignant\r\ncats.\r\n\r\nAnne looked up from _Pickwick Papers_. Now that spring examinations\r\nwere over she was treating herself to Dickens.\r\n\r\n“It has been a prosy day for us,” she said thoughtfully, “but to some\r\npeople it has been a wonderful day. Some one has been rapturously happy\r\nin it. Perhaps a great deed has been done somewhere today—or a great\r\npoem written—or a great man born. And some heart has been broken,\r\nPhil.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you spoil your pretty thought by tagging that last sentence\r\non, honey?” grumbled Phil. “I don’t like to think of broken hearts—or\r\nanything unpleasant.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you’ll be able to shirk unpleasant things all your life,\r\nPhil?”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, no. Am I not up against them now? You don’t call Alec and\r\nAlonzo pleasant things, do you, when they simply plague my life out?”\r\n\r\n“You never take anything seriously, Phil.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I? There are enough folks who do. The world needs people\r\nlike me, Anne, just to amuse it. It would be a terrible place if\r\n_everybody_ were intellectual and serious and in deep, deadly earnest.\r\nMY mission is, as _Josiah Allen_ says, ‘to charm and allure.’ Confess\r\nnow. Hasn’t life at Patty’s Place been really much brighter and\r\npleasanter this past winter because I’ve been here to leaven you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it has,” owned Anne.\r\n\r\n“And you all love me—even Aunt Jamesina, who thinks I’m stark mad. So\r\nwhy should I try to be different? Oh, dear, I’m so sleepy. I was awake\r\nuntil one last night, reading a harrowing ghost story. I read it in\r\nbed, and after I had finished it do you suppose I could get out of bed\r\nto put the light out? No! And if Stella had not fortunately come in\r\nlate that lamp would have burned good and bright till morning. When I\r\nheard Stella I called her in, explained my predicament, and got her to\r\nput out the light. If I had got out myself to do it I knew something\r\nwould grab me by the feet when I was getting in again. By the way,\r\nAnne, has Aunt Jamesina decided what to do this summer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she’s going to stay here. I know she’s doing it for the sake of\r\nthose blessed cats, although she says it’s too much trouble to open her\r\nown house, and she hates visiting.”\r\n\r\n“What are you reading?”\r\n\r\n“_Pickwick_.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a book that always makes me hungry,” said Phil. “There’s so\r\nmuch good eating in it. The characters seem always to be reveling on\r\nham and eggs and milk punch. I generally go on a cupboard rummage after\r\nreading _Pickwick_. The mere thought reminds me that I’m starving. Is\r\nthere any tidbit in the pantry, Queen Anne?”\r\n\r\n“I made a lemon pie this morning. You may have a piece of it.”\r\n\r\nPhil dashed out to the pantry and Anne betook herself to the orchard in\r\ncompany with Rusty. It was a moist, pleasantly-odorous night in early\r\nspring. The snow was not quite all gone from the park; a little dingy\r\nbank of it yet lay under the pines of the harbor road, screened from\r\nthe influence of April suns. It kept the harbor road muddy, and chilled\r\nthe evening air. But grass was growing green in sheltered spots and\r\nGilbert had found some pale, sweet arbutus in a hidden corner. He came\r\nup from the park, his hands full of it.\r\n\r\nAnne was sitting on the big gray boulder in the orchard looking at the\r\npoem of a bare, birchen bough hanging against the pale red sunset with\r\nthe very perfection of grace. She was building a castle in air—a\r\nwondrous mansion whose sunlit courts and stately halls were steeped in\r\nAraby’s perfume, and where she reigned queen and chatelaine. She\r\nfrowned as she saw Gilbert coming through the orchard. Of late she had\r\nmanaged not to be left alone with Gilbert. But he had caught her fairly\r\nnow; and even Rusty had deserted her.\r\n\r\nGilbert sat down beside her on the boulder and held out his Mayflowers.\r\n\r\n“Don’t these remind you of home and our old schoolday picnics, Anne?”\r\n\r\nAnne took them and buried her face in them.\r\n\r\n“I’m in Mr. Silas Sloane’s barrens this very minute,” she said\r\nrapturously.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you will be there in reality in a few days?”\r\n\r\n“No, not for a fortnight. I’m going to visit with Phil in Bolingbroke\r\nbefore I go home. You’ll be in Avonlea before I will.”\r\n\r\n“No, I shall not be in Avonlea at all this summer, Anne. I’ve been\r\noffered a job in the Daily News office and I’m going to take it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Anne vaguely. She wondered what a whole Avonlea summer would\r\nbe like without Gilbert. Somehow she did not like the prospect. “Well,”\r\nshe concluded flatly, “it is a good thing for you, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve been hoping I would get it. It will help me out next year.”\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t work _too_ hard,” said Anne, without any very clear idea\r\nof what she was saying. She wished desperately that Phil would come\r\nout. “You’ve studied very constantly this winter. Isn’t this a\r\ndelightful evening? Do you know, I found a cluster of white violets\r\nunder that old twisted tree over there today? I felt as if I had\r\ndiscovered a gold mine.”\r\n\r\n“You are always discovering gold mines,” said Gilbert—also absently.\r\n\r\n“Let us go and see if we can find some more,” suggested Anne eagerly.\r\n“I’ll call Phil and—”\r\n\r\n“Never mind Phil and the violets just now, Anne,” said Gilbert quietly,\r\ntaking her hand in a clasp from which she could not free it. “There is\r\nsomething I want to say to you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t say it,” cried Anne, pleadingly. “Don’t—_please_, Gilbert.”\r\n\r\n“I must. Things can’t go on like this any longer. Anne, I love you. You\r\nknow I do. I—I can’t tell you how much. Will you promise me that some\r\nday you’ll be my wife?”\r\n\r\n“I—I can’t,” said Anne miserably. “Oh, Gilbert—you—you’ve spoiled\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you care for me at all?” Gilbert asked after a very dreadful\r\npause, during which Anne had not dared to look up.\r\n\r\n“Not—not in that way. I do care a great deal for you as a friend. But I\r\ndon’t love you, Gilbert.”\r\n\r\n“But can’t you give me some hope that you will—yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t,” exclaimed Anne desperately. “I never, never can love\r\nyou—in that way—Gilbert. You must never speak of this to me again.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause—so long and so dreadful that Anne was driven at\r\nlast to look up. Gilbert’s face was white to the lips. And his eyes—but\r\nAnne shuddered and looked away. There was nothing romantic about this.\r\nMust proposals be either grotesque or—horrible? Could she ever forget\r\nGilbert’s face?\r\n\r\n“Is there anybody else?” he asked at last in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“No—no,” said Anne eagerly. “I don’t care for any one like _that_—and I\r\n_like_ you better than anybody else in the world, Gilbert. And we\r\nmust—we must go on being friends, Gilbert.”\r\n\r\nGilbert gave a bitter little laugh.\r\n\r\n“Friends! Your friendship can’t satisfy me, Anne. I want your love—and\r\nyou tell me I can never have that.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry. Forgive me, Gilbert,” was all Anne could say. Where, oh,\r\nwhere were all the gracious and graceful speeches wherewith, in\r\nimagination, she had been wont to dismiss rejected suitors?\r\n\r\nGilbert released her hand gently.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t anything to forgive. There have been times when I thought\r\nyou did care. I’ve deceived myself, that’s all. Goodbye, Anne.”\r\n\r\nAnne got herself to her room, sat down on her window seat behind the\r\npines, and cried bitterly. She felt as if something incalculably\r\nprecious had gone out of her life. It was Gilbert’s friendship, of\r\ncourse. Oh, why must she lose it after this fashion?\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, honey?” asked Phil, coming in through the moonlit\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nAnne did not answer. At that moment she wished Phil were a thousand\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’ve gone and refused Gilbert Blythe. You are an idiot,\r\nAnne Shirley!”\r\n\r\n“Do you call it idiotic to refuse to marry a man I don’t love?” said\r\nAnne coldly, goaded to reply.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know love when you see it. You’ve tricked something out with\r\nyour imagination that you think love, and you expect the real thing to\r\nlook like that. There, that’s the first sensible thing I’ve ever said\r\nin my life. I wonder how I managed it?”\r\n\r\n“Phil,” pleaded Anne, “please go away and leave me alone for a little\r\nwhile. My world has tumbled into pieces. I want to reconstruct it.”\r\n\r\n“Without any Gilbert in it?” said Phil, going.\r\n\r\nA world without any Gilbert in it! Anne repeated the words drearily.\r\nWould it not be a very lonely, forlorn place? Well, it was all\r\nGilbert’s fault. He had spoiled their beautiful comradeship. She must\r\njust learn to live without it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\nRoses of Yesterday\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fortnight Anne spent in Bolingbroke was a very pleasant one, with a\r\nlittle under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction running through\r\nit whenever she thought about Gilbert. There was not, however, much\r\ntime to think about him. “Mount Holly,” the beautiful old Gordon\r\nhomestead, was a very gay place, overrun by Phil’s friends of both\r\nsexes. There was quite a bewildering succession of drives, dances,\r\npicnics and boating parties, all expressively lumped together by Phil\r\nunder the head of “jamborees”; Alec and Alonzo were so constantly on\r\nhand that Anne wondered if they ever did anything but dance attendance\r\non that will-o’-the-wisp of a Phil. They were both nice, manly fellows,\r\nbut Anne would not be drawn into any opinion as to which was the nicer.\r\n\r\n“And I depended so on you to help me make up my mind which of them I\r\nshould promise to marry,” mourned Phil.\r\n\r\n“You must do that for yourself. You are quite expert at making up your\r\nmind as to whom other people should marry,” retorted Anne, rather\r\ncaustically.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s a very different thing,” said Phil, truly.\r\n\r\nBut the sweetest incident of Anne’s sojourn in Bolingbroke was the\r\nvisit to her birthplace—the little shabby yellow house in an\r\nout-of-the-way street she had so often dreamed about. She looked at it\r\nwith delighted eyes, as she and Phil turned in at the gate.\r\n\r\n“It’s almost exactly as I’ve pictured it,” she said. “There is no\r\nhoneysuckle over the windows, but there is a lilac tree by the gate,\r\nand—yes, there are the muslin curtains in the windows. How glad I am it\r\nis still painted yellow.”\r\n\r\nA very tall, very thin woman opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the Shirleys lived here twenty years ago,” she said, in answer to\r\nAnne’s question. “They had it rented. I remember ’em. They both died of\r\nfever at onct. It was turrible sad. They left a baby. I guess it’s dead\r\nlong ago. It was a sickly thing. Old Thomas and his wife took it—as if\r\nthey hadn’t enough of their own.”\r\n\r\n“It didn’t die,” said Anne, smiling. “I was that baby.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say so! Why, you have grown,” exclaimed the woman, as if she\r\nwere much surprised that Anne was not still a baby. “Come to look at\r\nyou, I see the resemblance. You’re complected like your pa. He had red\r\nhair. But you favor your ma in your eyes and mouth. She was a nice\r\nlittle thing. My darter went to school to her and was nigh crazy about\r\nher. They was buried in the one grave and the School Board put up a\r\ntombstone to them as a reward for faithful service. Will you come in?”\r\n\r\n“Will you let me go all over the house?” asked Anne eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Laws, yes, you can if you like. ’Twon’t take you long—there ain’t much\r\nof it. I keep at my man to build a new kitchen, but he ain’t one of\r\nyour hustlers. The parlor’s in there and there’s two rooms upstairs.\r\nJust prowl about yourselves. I’ve got to see to the baby. The east room\r\nwas the one you were born in. I remember your ma saying she loved to\r\nsee the sunrise; and I mind hearing that you was born just as the sun\r\nwas rising and its light on your face was the first thing your ma saw.”\r\n\r\nAnne went up the narrow stairs and into that little east room with a\r\nfull heart. It was as a shrine to her. Here her mother had dreamed the\r\nexquisite, happy dreams of anticipated motherhood; here that red\r\nsunrise light had fallen over them both in the sacred hour of birth;\r\nhere her mother had died. Anne looked about her reverently, her eyes\r\nwith tears. It was for her one of the jeweled hours of life that gleam\r\nout radiantly forever in memory.\r\n\r\n“Just to think of it—mother was younger than I am now when I was born,”\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\nWhen Anne went downstairs the lady of the house met her in the hall.\r\nShe held out a dusty little packet tied with faded blue ribbon.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a bundle of old letters I found in that closet upstairs when I\r\ncame here,” she said. “I dunno what they are—I never bothered to look\r\nin ’em, but the address on the top one is ‘Miss Bertha Willis,’ and\r\nthat was your ma’s maiden name. You can take ’em if you’d keer to have\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you—thank you,” cried Anne, clasping the packet rapturously.\r\n\r\n“That was all that was in the house,” said her hostess. “The furniture\r\nwas all sold to pay the doctor bills, and Mrs. Thomas got your ma’s\r\nclothes and little things. I reckon they didn’t last long among that\r\ndrove of Thomas youngsters. They was destructive young animals, as I\r\nmind ’em.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t one thing that belonged to my mother,” said Anne, chokily.\r\n“I—I can never thank you enough for these letters.”\r\n\r\n“You’re quite welcome. Laws, but your eyes is like your ma’s. She could\r\njust about talk with hers. Your father was sorter homely but awful\r\nnice. I mind hearing folks say when they was married that there never\r\nwas two people more in love with each other—Pore creatures, they didn’t\r\nlive much longer; but they was awful happy while they was alive, and I\r\ns’pose that counts for a good deal.”\r\n\r\nAnne longed to get home to read her precious letters; but she made one\r\nlittle pilgrimage first. She went alone to the green corner of the\r\n“old” Bolingbroke cemetery where her father and mother were buried, and\r\nleft on their grave the white flowers she carried. Then she hastened\r\nback to Mount Holly, shut herself up in her room, and read the letters.\r\nSome were written by her father, some by her mother. There were not\r\nmany—only a dozen in all—for Walter and Bertha Shirley had not been\r\noften separated during their courtship. The letters were yellow and\r\nfaded and dim, blurred with the touch of passing years. No profound\r\nwords of wisdom were traced on the stained and wrinkled pages, but only\r\nlines of love and trust. The sweetness of forgotten things clung to\r\nthem—the far-off, fond imaginings of those long-dead lovers. Bertha\r\nShirley had possessed the gift of writing letters which embodied the\r\ncharming personality of the writer in words and thoughts that retained\r\ntheir beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time. The letters were\r\ntender, intimate, sacred. To Anne, the sweetest of all was the one\r\nwritten after her birth to the father on a brief absence. It was full\r\nof a proud young mother’s accounts of “baby”—her cleverness, her\r\nbrightness, her thousand sweetnesses.\r\n\r\n“I love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is\r\nawake,” Bertha Shirley had written in the postscript. Probably it was\r\nthe last sentence she had ever penned. The end was very near for her.\r\n\r\n“This has been the most beautiful day of my life,” Anne said to Phil\r\nthat night. “I’ve FOUND my father and mother. Those letters have made\r\nthem REAL to me. I’m not an orphan any longer. I feel as if I had\r\nopened a book and found roses of yesterday, sweet and beloved, between\r\nits leaves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\nSpring and Anne Return to Green Gables\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firelight shadows were dancing over the kitchen walls at Green\r\nGables, for the spring evening was chilly; through the open east window\r\ndrifted in the subtly sweet voices of the night. Marilla was sitting by\r\nthe fire—at least, in body. In spirit she was roaming olden ways, with\r\nfeet grown young. Of late Marilla had thus spent many an hour, when she\r\nthought she should have been knitting for the twins.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I’m growing old,” she said.\r\n\r\nYet Marilla had changed but little in the past nine years, save to grow\r\nsomething thinner, and even more angular; there was a little more gray\r\nin the hair that was still twisted up in the same hard knot, with two\r\nhairpins—_were_ they the same hairpins?—still stuck through it. But her\r\nexpression was very different; the something about the mouth which had\r\nhinted at a sense of humor had developed wonderfully; her eyes were\r\ngentler and milder, her smile more frequent and tender.\r\n\r\nMarilla was thinking of her whole past life, her cramped but not\r\nunhappy childhood, the jealously hidden dreams and the blighted hopes\r\nof her girlhood, the long, gray, narrow, monotonous years of dull\r\nmiddle life that followed. And the coming of Anne—the vivid,\r\nimaginative, impetuous child with her heart of love, and her world of\r\nfancy, bringing with her color and warmth and radiance, until the\r\nwilderness of existence had blossomed like the rose. Marilla felt that\r\nout of her sixty years she had lived only the nine that had followed\r\nthe advent of Anne. And Anne would be home tomorrow night.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen door opened. Marilla looked up expecting to see Mrs. Lynde.\r\nAnne stood before her, tall and starry-eyed, with her hands full of\r\nMayflowers and violets.\r\n\r\n“Anne Shirley!” exclaimed Marilla. For once in her life she was\r\nsurprised out of her reserve; she caught her girl in her arms and\r\ncrushed her and her flowers against her heart, kissing the bright hair\r\nand sweet face warmly. “I never looked for you till tomorrow night. How\r\ndid you get from Carmody?”\r\n\r\n“Walked, dearest of Marillas. Haven’t I done it a score of times in the\r\nQueen’s days? The mailman is to bring my trunk tomorrow; I just got\r\nhomesick all at once, and came a day earlier. And oh! I’ve had such a\r\nlovely walk in the May twilight; I stopped by the barrens and picked\r\nthese Mayflowers; I came through Violet-Vale; it’s just a big bowlful\r\nof violets now—the dear, sky-tinted things. Smell them, Marilla—drink\r\nthem in.”\r\n\r\nMarilla sniffed obligingly, but she was more interested in Anne than in\r\ndrinking violets.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, child. You must be real tired. I’m going to get you some\r\nsupper.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a darling moonrise behind the hills tonight, Marilla, and oh,\r\nhow the frogs sang me home from Carmody! I do love the music of the\r\nfrogs. It seems bound up with all my happiest recollections of old\r\nspring evenings. And it always reminds me of the night I came here\r\nfirst. Do you remember it, Marilla?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes,” said Marilla with emphasis. “I’m not likely to forget it\r\never.”\r\n\r\n“They used to sing so madly in the marsh and brook that year. I would\r\nlisten to them at my window in the dusk, and wonder how they could seem\r\nso glad and so sad at the same time. Oh, but it’s good to be home\r\nagain! Redmond was splendid and Bolingbroke delightful—but Green Gables\r\nis _home_.”\r\n\r\n“Gilbert isn’t coming home this summer, I hear,” said Marilla.\r\n\r\n“No.” Something in Anne’s tone made Marilla glance at her sharply, but\r\nAnne was apparently absorbed in arranging her violets in a bowl. “See,\r\naren’t they sweet?” she went on hurriedly. “The year is a book, isn’t\r\nit, Marilla? Spring’s pages are written in Mayflowers and violets,\r\nsummer’s in roses, autumn’s in red maple leaves, and winter in holly\r\nand evergreen.”\r\n\r\n“Did Gilbert do well in his examinations?” persisted Marilla.\r\n\r\n“Excellently well. He led his class. But where are the twins and Mrs.\r\nLynde?”\r\n\r\n“Rachel and Dora are over at Mr. Harrison’s. Davy is down at Boulters’.\r\nI think I hear him coming now.”\r\n\r\nDavy burst in, saw Anne, stopped, and then hurled himself upon her with\r\na joyful yell.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anne, ain’t I glad to see you! Say, Anne, I’ve grown two inches\r\nsince last fall. Mrs. Lynde measured me with her tape today, and say,\r\nAnne, see my front tooth. It’s gone. Mrs. Lynde tied one end of a\r\nstring to it and the other end to the door, and then shut the door. I\r\nsold it to Milty for two cents. Milty’s collecting teeth.”\r\n\r\n“What in the world does he want teeth for?” asked Marilla.\r\n\r\n“To make a necklace for playing Indian Chief,” explained Davy, climbing\r\nupon Anne’s lap. “He’s got fifteen already, and everybody’s else’s\r\npromised, so there’s no use in the rest of us starting to collect, too.\r\nI tell you the Boulters are great business people.”\r\n\r\n“Were you a good boy at Mrs. Boulter’s?” asked Marilla severely.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but say, Marilla, I’m tired of being good.”\r\n\r\n“You’d get tired of being bad much sooner, Davy-boy,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’d be fun while it lasted, wouldn’t it?” persisted Davy. “I\r\ncould be sorry for it afterwards, couldn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Being sorry wouldn’t do away with the consequences of being bad, Davy.\r\nDon’t you remember the Sunday last summer when you ran away from Sunday\r\nSchool? You told me then that being bad wasn’t worth while. What were\r\nyou and Milty doing today?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we fished and chased the cat, and hunted for eggs, and yelled at\r\nthe echo. There’s a great echo in the bush behind the Boulter barn.\r\nSay, what is echo, Anne; I want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Echo is a beautiful nymph, Davy, living far away in the woods, and\r\nlaughing at the world from among the hills.”\r\n\r\n“What does she look like?”\r\n\r\n“Her hair and eyes are dark, but her neck and arms are white as snow.\r\nNo mortal can ever see how fair she is. She is fleeter than a deer, and\r\nthat mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her. You can hear her\r\ncalling at night; you can hear her laughing under the stars. But you\r\ncan never see her. She flies afar if you follow her, and laughs at you\r\nalways just over the next hill.”\r\n\r\n“Is that true, Anne? Or is it a whopper?” demanded Davy staring.\r\n\r\n“Davy,” said Anne despairingly, “haven’t you sense enough to\r\ndistinguish between a fairytale and a falsehood?”\r\n\r\n“Then what is it that sasses back from the Boulter bush? I want to\r\nknow,” insisted Davy.\r\n\r\n“When you are a little older, Davy, I’ll explain it all to you.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of age evidently gave a new turn to Davy’s thoughts for\r\nafter a few moments of reflection, he whispered solemnly:\r\n\r\n“Anne, I’m going to be married.”\r\n\r\n“When?” asked Anne with equal solemnity.\r\n\r\n“Oh, not until I’m grown-up, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s a relief, Davy. Who is the lady?”\r\n\r\n“Stella Fletcher; she’s in my class at school. And say, Anne, she’s the\r\nprettiest girl you ever saw. If I die before I grow up you’ll keep an\r\neye on her, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Davy Keith, do stop talking such nonsense,” said Marilla severely.\r\n\r\n“’Tisn’t nonsense,” protested Davy in an injured tone. “She’s my\r\npromised wife, and if I was to die she’d be my promised widow, wouldn’t\r\nshe? And she hasn’t got a soul to look after her except her old\r\ngrandmother.”\r\n\r\n“Come and have your supper, Anne,” said Marilla, “and don’t encourage\r\nthat child in his absurd talk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\nPaul Cannot Find the Rock People\r\n\r\n\r\nLife was very pleasant in Avonlea that summer, although Anne, amid all\r\nher vacation joys, was haunted by a sense of “something gone which\r\nshould be there.” She would not admit, even in her inmost reflections,\r\nthat this was caused by Gilbert’s absence. But when she had to walk\r\nhome alone from prayer meetings and A.V.I.S. pow-wows, while Diana and\r\nFred, and many other gay couples, loitered along the dusky, starlit\r\ncountry roads, there was a queer, lonely ache in her heart which she\r\ncould not explain away. Gilbert did not even write to her, as she\r\nthought he might have done. She knew he wrote to Diana occasionally,\r\nbut she would not inquire about him; and Diana, supposing that Anne\r\nheard from him, volunteered no information. Gilbert’s mother, who was a\r\ngay, frank, light-hearted lady, but not overburdened with tact, had a\r\nvery embarrassing habit of asking Anne, always in a painfully distinct\r\nvoice and always in the presence of a crowd, if she had heard from\r\nGilbert lately. Poor Anne could only blush horribly and murmur, “not\r\nvery lately,” which was taken by all, Mrs. Blythe included, to be\r\nmerely a maidenly evasion.\r\n\r\nApart from this, Anne enjoyed her summer. Priscilla came for a merry\r\nvisit in June; and, when she had gone, Mr. and Mrs. Irving, Paul and\r\nCharlotta the Fourth came “home” for July and August.\r\n\r\nEcho Lodge was the scene of gaieties once more, and the echoes over the\r\nriver were kept busy mimicking the laughter that rang in the old garden\r\nbehind the spruces.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavendar” had not changed, except to grow even sweeter and\r\nprettier. Paul adored her, and the companionship between them was\r\nbeautiful to see.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t call her ‘mother’ just by itself,” he explained to Anne.\r\n“You see, _that_ name belongs just to my own little mother, and I can’t\r\ngive it to any one else. You know, teacher. But I call her ‘Mother\r\nLavendar’ and I love her next best to father. I—I even love her a\r\n_little_ better than you, teacher.”\r\n\r\n“Which is just as it ought to be,” answered Anne.\r\n\r\nPaul was thirteen now and very tall for his years. His face and eyes\r\nwere as beautiful as ever, and his fancy was still like a prism,\r\nseparating everything that fell upon it into rainbows. He and Anne had\r\ndelightful rambles to wood and field and shore. Never were there two\r\nmore thoroughly “kindred spirits.”\r\n\r\nCharlotta the Fourth had blossomed out into young ladyhood. She wore\r\nher hair now in an enormous pompador and had discarded the blue ribbon\r\nbows of auld lang syne, but her face was as freckled, her nose as\r\nsnubbed, and her mouth and smiles as wide as ever.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think I talk with a Yankee accent, do you, Miss Shirley,\r\nma’am?” she demanded anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I don’t notice it, Charlotta.”\r\n\r\n“I’m real glad of that. They said I did at home, but I thought likely\r\nthey just wanted to aggravate me. I don’t want no Yankee accent. Not\r\nthat I’ve a word to say against the Yankees, Miss Shirley, ma’am.\r\nThey’re real civilized. But give me old P.E. Island every time.”\r\n\r\nPaul spent his first fortnight with his grandmother Irving in Avonlea.\r\nAnne was there to meet him when he came, and found him wild with\r\neagerness to get to the shore—Nora and the Golden Lady and the Twin\r\nSailors would be there. He could hardly wait to eat his supper. Could\r\nhe not see Nora’s elfin face peering around the point, watching for him\r\nwistfully? But it was a very sober Paul who came back from the shore in\r\nthe twilight.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you find your Rock People?” asked Anne.\r\n\r\nPaul shook his chestnut curls sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“The Twin Sailors and the Golden Lady never came at all,” he said.\r\n“Nora was there—but Nora is not the same, teacher. She is changed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Paul, it is you who are changed,” said Anne. “You have grown too\r\nold for the Rock People. They like only children for playfellows. I am\r\nafraid the Twin Sailors will never again come to you in the pearly,\r\nenchanted boat with the sail of moonshine; and the Golden Lady will\r\nplay no more for you on her golden harp. Even Nora will not meet you\r\nmuch longer. You must pay the penalty of growing-up, Paul. You must\r\nleave fairyland behind you.”\r\n\r\n“You two talk as much foolishness as ever you did,” said old Mrs.\r\nIrving, half-indulgently, half-reprovingly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, we don’t,” said Anne, shaking her head gravely. “We are\r\ngetting very, very wise, and it is such a pity. We are never half so\r\ninteresting when we have learned that language is given us to enable us\r\nto conceal our thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“But it isn’t—it is given us to exchange our thoughts,” said Mrs.\r\nIrving seriously. She had never heard of Tallyrand and did not\r\nunderstand epigrams.\r\n\r\nAnne spent a fortnight of halcyon days at Echo Lodge in the golden\r\nprime of August. While there she incidentally contrived to hurry\r\nLudovic Speed in his leisurely courting of Theodora Dix, as related\r\nduly in another chronicle of her history.(1) Arnold Sherman, an elderly\r\nfriend of the Irvings, was there at the same time, and added not a\r\nlittle to the general pleasantness of life.\r\n\r\n(1 Chronicles of Avonlea.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a nice play-time this has been,” said Anne. “I feel like a giant\r\nrefreshed. And it’s only a fortnight more till I go back to Kingsport,\r\nand Redmond and Patty’s Place. Patty’s Place is the dearest spot, Miss\r\nLavendar. I feel as if I had two homes—one at Green Gables and one at\r\nPatty’s Place. But where has the summer gone? It doesn’t seem a day\r\nsince I came home that spring evening with the Mayflowers. When I was\r\nlittle I couldn’t see from one end of the summer to the other. It\r\nstretched before me like an unending season. Now, ‘’tis a handbreadth,\r\n’tis a tale.’”\r\n\r\n“Anne, are you and Gilbert Blythe as good friends as you used to be?”\r\nasked Miss Lavendar quietly.\r\n\r\n“I am just as much Gilbert’s friend as ever I was, Miss Lavendar.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavendar shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I see something’s gone wrong, Anne. I’m going to be impertinent and\r\nask what. Have you quarrelled?”\r\n\r\n“No; it’s only that Gilbert wants more than friendship and I can’t give\r\nhim more.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of that, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly sure.”\r\n\r\n“I’m very, very sorry.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder why everybody seems to think I ought to marry Gilbert\r\nBlythe,” said Anne petulantly.\r\n\r\n“Because you were made and meant for each other, Anne—that is why. You\r\nneedn’t toss that young head of yours. It’s a fact.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\nEnter Jonas\r\n\r\n\r\n“PROSPECT POINT,\r\n“August 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dear Anne—spelled—with—an—E,” wrote Phil, “I must prop my eyelids open\r\nlong enough to write you. I’ve neglected you shamefully this summer,\r\nhoney, but all my other correspondents have been neglected, too. I have\r\na huge pile of letters to answer, so I must gird up the loins of my\r\nmind and hoe in. Excuse my mixed metaphors. I’m fearfully sleepy. Last\r\nnight Cousin Emily and I were calling at a neighbor’s. There were\r\nseveral other callers there, and as soon as those unfortunate creatures\r\nleft, our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces. I\r\nknew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut\r\nbehind us. When we came home Mrs. Lilly informed us that the aforesaid\r\nneighbor’s hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever. You\r\ncan always trust Mrs. Lilly to tell you cheerful things like that. I\r\nhave a horror of scarlet fever. I couldn’t sleep when I went to bed for\r\nthinking of it. I tossed and tumbled about, dreaming fearful dreams\r\nwhen I did snooze for a minute; and at three I wakened up with a high\r\nfever, a sore throat, and a raging headache. I knew I had scarlet\r\nfever; I got up in a panic and hunted up Cousin Emily’s ‘doctor book’\r\nto read up the symptoms. Anne, I had them all. So I went back to bed,\r\nand knowing the worst, slept like a top the rest of the night. Though\r\nwhy a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could\r\nunderstand. But this morning I was quite well, so it couldn’t have been\r\nthe fever. I suppose if I did catch it last night it couldn’t have\r\ndeveloped so soon. I can remember that in daytime, but at three o’clock\r\nat night I never can be logical.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you wonder what I’m doing at Prospect Point. Well, I always\r\nlike to spend a month of summer at the shore, and father insists that I\r\ncome to his second-cousin Emily’s ‘select boardinghouse’ at Prospect\r\nPoint. So a fortnight ago I came as usual. And as usual old ‘Uncle Mark\r\nMiller’ brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he\r\ncalls his ‘generous purpose’ horse. He is a nice old man and gave me a\r\nhandful of pink peppermints. Peppermints always seem to me such a\r\nreligious sort of candy—I suppose because when I was a little girl\r\nGrandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church. Once I asked,\r\nreferring to the smell of peppermints, ‘Is that the odor of sanctity?’\r\nI didn’t like to eat Uncle Mark’s peppermints because he just fished\r\nthem loose out of his pocket, and had to pick some rusty nails and\r\nother things from among them before he gave them to me. But I wouldn’t\r\nhurt his dear old feelings for anything, so I carefully sowed them\r\nalong the road at intervals. When the last one was gone, Uncle Mark\r\nsaid, a little rebukingly, ‘Ye shouldn’t a’et all them candies to onct,\r\nMiss Phil. You’ll likely have the stummick-ache.’\r\n\r\n“Cousin Emily has only five boarders besides myself—four old ladies and\r\none young man. My right-hand neighbor is Mrs. Lilly. She is one of\r\nthose people who seem to take a gruesome pleasure in detailing all\r\ntheir many aches and pains and sicknesses. You cannot mention any\r\nailment but she says, shaking her head, ‘Ah, I know too well what that\r\nis’—and then you get all the details. Jonas declares he once spoke of\r\nlocomotor ataxia in hearing and she said she knew too well what that\r\nwas. She suffered from it for ten years and was finally cured by a\r\ntraveling doctor.\r\n\r\n“Who is Jonas? Just wait, Anne Shirley. You’ll hear all about Jonas in\r\nthe proper time and place. He is not to be mixed up with estimable old\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n“My left-hand neighbor at the table is Mrs. Phinney. She always speaks\r\nwith a wailing, dolorous voice—you are nervously expecting her to burst\r\ninto tears every moment. She gives you the impression that life to her\r\nis indeed a vale of tears, and that a smile, never to speak of a laugh,\r\nis a frivolity truly reprehensible. She has a worse opinion of me than\r\nAunt Jamesina, and she doesn’t love me hard to atone for it, as Aunty\r\nJ. does, either.\r\n\r\n“Miss Maria Grimsby sits cati-corner from me. The first day I came I\r\nremarked to Miss Maria that it looked a little like rain—and Miss Maria\r\nlaughed. I said the road from the station was very pretty—and Miss\r\nMaria laughed. I said there seemed to be a few mosquitoes left yet—and\r\nMiss Maria laughed. I said that Prospect Point was as beautiful as\r\never—and Miss Maria laughed. If I were to say to Miss Maria, ‘My father\r\nhas hanged himself, my mother has taken poison, my brother is in the\r\npenitentiary, and I am in the last stages of consumption,’ Miss Maria\r\nwould laugh. She can’t help it—she was born so; but is very sad and\r\nawful.\r\n\r\n“The fifth old lady is Mrs. Grant. She is a sweet old thing; but she\r\nnever says anything but good of anybody and so she is a very\r\nuninteresting conversationalist.\r\n\r\n“And now for Jonas, Anne.\r\n\r\n“That first day I came I saw a young man sitting opposite me at the\r\ntable, smiling at me as if he had known me from my cradle. I knew, for\r\nUncle Mark had told me, that his name was Jonas Blake, that he was a\r\nTheological Student from St. Columbia, and that he had taken charge of\r\nthe Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer.\r\n\r\n“He is a very ugly young man—really, the ugliest young man I’ve ever\r\nseen. He has a big, loose-jointed figure with absurdly long legs. His\r\nhair is tow-color and lank, his eyes are green, and his mouth is big,\r\nand his ears—but I never think about his ears if I can help it.\r\n\r\n“He has a lovely voice—if you shut your eyes he is adorable—and he\r\ncertainly has a beautiful soul and disposition.\r\n\r\n“We were good chums right way. Of course he is a graduate of Redmond,\r\nand that is a link between us. We fished and boated together; and we\r\nwalked on the sands by moonlight. He didn’t look so homely by moonlight\r\nand oh, he was nice. Niceness fairly exhaled from him. The old\r\nladies—except Mrs. Grant—don’t approve of Jonas, because he laughs and\r\njokes—and because he evidently likes the society of frivolous me better\r\nthan theirs.\r\n\r\n“Somehow, Anne, I don’t want him to think me frivolous. This is\r\nridiculous. Why should I care what a tow-haired person called Jonas,\r\nwhom I never saw before thinks of me?\r\n\r\n“Last Sunday Jonas preached in the village church. I went, of course,\r\nbut I couldn’t realize that Jonas was going to preach. The fact that he\r\nwas a minister—or going to be one—persisted in seeming a huge joke to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jonas preached. And, by the time he had preached ten minutes, I\r\nfelt so small and insignificant that I thought I must be invisible to\r\nthe naked eye. Jonas never said a word about women and he never looked\r\nat me. But I realized then and there what a pitiful, frivolous,\r\nsmall-souled little butterfly I was, and how horribly different I must\r\nbe from Jonas’ ideal woman. _She_ would be grand and strong and noble.\r\nHe was so earnest and tender and true. He was everything a minister\r\nought to be. I wondered how I could ever have thought him ugly—but he\r\nreally is!—with those inspired eyes and that intellectual brow which\r\nthe roughly-falling hair hid on week days.\r\n\r\n“It was a splendid sermon and I could have listened to it forever, and\r\nit made me feel utterly wretched. Oh, I wish I was like _you_, Anne.\r\n\r\n“He caught up with me on the road home, and grinned as cheerfully as\r\nusual. But his grin could never deceive me again. I had seen the _real_\r\nJonas. I wondered if he could ever see the _real Phil_—whom _nobody_,\r\nnot even you, Anne, has ever seen yet.\r\n\r\n“‘Jonas,’ I said—I forgot to call him Mr. Blake. Wasn’t it dreadful?\r\nBut there are times when things like that don’t matter—‘Jonas, you were\r\nborn to be a minister. You _couldn’t_ be anything else.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, I couldn’t,’ he said soberly. ‘I tried to be something else for a\r\nlong time—I didn’t want to be a minister. But I came to see at last\r\nthat it was the work given me to do—and God helping me, I shall try to\r\ndo it.’\r\n\r\n“His voice was low and reverent. I thought that he would do his work\r\nand do it well and nobly; and happy the woman fitted by nature and\r\ntraining to help him do it. _She_ would be no feather, blown about by\r\nevery fickle wind of fancy. _She_ would always know what hat to put on.\r\nProbably she would have only one. Ministers never have much money. But\r\nshe wouldn’t mind having one hat or none at all, because she would have\r\nJonas.\r\n\r\n“Anne Shirley, don’t you dare to say or hint or think that I’ve fallen\r\nin love with Mr. Blake. Could _I_ care for a lank, poor, ugly\r\ntheologue—named Jonas? As Uncle Mark says, ‘It’s impossible, and what’s\r\nmore it’s improbable.’\r\n\r\n“Good night,\r\nPHIL.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“P.S. It is impossible—but I am horribly afraid it’s true. I’m happy\r\nand wretched and scared. _He_ can _never_ care for me, I know. Do you\r\nthink I could ever develop into a passable minister’s wife, Anne? And\r\n_would_ they expect me to lead in prayer? P G.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\nEnter Prince Charming\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m contrasting the claims of indoors and out,” said Anne, looking\r\nfrom the window of Patty’s Place to the distant pines of the park.\r\n\r\n“I’ve an afternoon to spend in sweet doing nothing, Aunt Jimsie. Shall\r\nI spend it here where there is a cosy fire, a plateful of delicious\r\nrussets, three purring and harmonious cats, and two impeccable china\r\ndogs with green noses? Or shall I go to the park, where there is the\r\nlure of gray woods and of gray water lapping on the harbor rocks?”\r\n\r\n“If I was as young as you, I’d decide in favor of the park,” said Aunt\r\nJamesina, tickling Joseph’s yellow ear with a knitting needle.\r\n\r\n“I thought that you claimed to be as young as any of us, Aunty,” teased\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in my soul. But I’ll admit my legs aren’t as young as yours. You\r\ngo and get some fresh air, Anne. You look pale lately.”\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll go to the park,” said Anne restlessly. “I don’t feel like\r\ntame domestic joys today. I want to feel alone and free and wild. The\r\npark will be empty, for every one will be at the football match.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you go to it?”\r\n\r\n“‘Nobody axed me, sir, she said’—at least, nobody but that horrid\r\nlittle Dan Ranger. I wouldn’t go anywhere with him; but rather than\r\nhurt his poor little tender feelings I said I wasn’t going to the game\r\nat all. I don’t mind. I’m not in the mood for football today somehow.”\r\n\r\n“You go and get some fresh air,” repeated Aunt Jamesina, “but take your\r\numbrella, for I believe it’s going to rain. I’ve rheumatism in my leg.”\r\n\r\n“Only old people should have rheumatism, Aunty.”\r\n\r\n“Anybody is liable to rheumatism in her legs, Anne. It’s only old\r\npeople who should have rheumatism in their souls, though. Thank\r\ngoodness, I never have. When you get rheumatism in your soul you might\r\nas well go and pick out your coffin.”\r\n\r\nIt was November—the month of crimson sunsets, parting birds, deep, sad\r\nhymns of the sea, passionate wind-songs in the pines. Anne roamed\r\nthrough the pineland alleys in the park and, as she said, let that\r\ngreat sweeping wind blow the fogs out of her soul. Anne was not wont to\r\nbe troubled with soul fog. But, somehow, since her return to Redmond\r\nfor this third year, life had not mirrored her spirit back to her with\r\nits old, perfect, sparkling clearness.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, existence at Patty’s Place was the same pleasant round of\r\nwork and study and recreation that it had always been. On Friday\r\nevenings the big, fire-lighted livingroom was crowded by callers and\r\nechoed to endless jest and laughter, while Aunt Jamesina smiled\r\nbeamingly on them all. The “Jonas” of Phil’s letter came often, running\r\nup from St. Columbia on the early train and departing on the late. He\r\nwas a general favorite at Patty’s Place, though Aunt Jamesina shook her\r\nhead and opined that divinity students were not what they used to be.\r\n\r\n“He’s _very_ nice, my dear,” she told Phil, “but ministers ought to be\r\ngraver and more dignified.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t a man laugh and laugh and be a Christian still?” demanded Phil.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _men_—yes. But I was speaking of _ministers_, my dear,” said Aunt\r\nJamesina rebukingly. “And you shouldn’t flirt so with Mr. Blake—you\r\nreally shouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not flirting with him,” protested Phil.\r\n\r\nNobody believed her, except Anne. The others thought she was amusing\r\nherself as usual, and told her roundly that she was behaving very\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Blake isn’t of the Alec-and-Alonzo type, Phil,” said Stella\r\nseverely. “He takes things seriously. You may break his heart.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think I could?” asked Phil. “I’d love to think so.”\r\n\r\n“Philippa Gordon! I never thought you were utterly unfeeling. The idea\r\nof you saying you’d love to break a man’s heart!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say so, honey. Quote me correctly. I said I’d like to think I\r\n_could_ break it. I would like to know I had the _power_ to do it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you, Phil. You are leading that man on\r\ndeliberately—and you know you don’t mean anything by it.”\r\n\r\n“I mean to make him ask me to marry him if I can,” said Phil calmly.\r\n\r\n“I give you up,” said Stella hopelessly.\r\n\r\nGilbert came occasionally on Friday evenings. He seemed always in good\r\nspirits, and held his own in the jests and repartee that flew about. He\r\nneither sought nor avoided Anne. When circumstances brought them in\r\ncontact he talked to her pleasantly and courteously, as to any\r\nnewly-made acquaintance. The old camaraderie was gone entirely. Anne\r\nfelt it keenly; but she told herself she was very glad and thankful\r\nthat Gilbert had got so completely over his disappointment in regard to\r\nher. She had really been afraid, that April evening in the orchard,\r\nthat she had hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in\r\nhealing. Now she saw that she need not have worried. Men have died and\r\nthe worms have eaten them but not for love. Gilbert evidently was in no\r\ndanger of immediate dissolution. He was enjoying life, and he was full\r\nof ambition and zest. For him there was to be no wasting in despair\r\nbecause a woman was fair and cold. Anne, as she listened to the\r\nceaseless badinage that went on between him and Phil, wondered if she\r\nhad only imagined that look in his eyes when she had told him she could\r\nnever care for him.\r\n\r\nThere were not lacking those who would gladly have stepped into\r\nGilbert’s vacant place. But Anne snubbed them without fear and without\r\nreproach. If the real Prince Charming was never to come she would have\r\nnone of a substitute. So she sternly told herself that gray day in the\r\nwindy park.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the rain of Aunt Jamesina’s prophecy came with a swish and\r\nrush. Anne put up her umbrella and hurried down the slope. As she\r\nturned out on the harbor road a savage gust of wind tore along it.\r\nInstantly her umbrella turned wrong side out. Anne clutched at it in\r\ndespair. And then—there came a voice close to her.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me—may I offer you the shelter of my umbrella?”\r\n\r\nAnne looked up. Tall and handsome and distinguished-looking—dark,\r\nmelancholy, inscrutable eyes—melting, musical, sympathetic voice—yes,\r\nthe very hero of her dreams stood before her in the flesh. He could not\r\nhave more closely resembled her ideal if he had been made to order.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she said confusedly.\r\n\r\n“We’d better hurry over to that little pavillion on the point,”\r\nsuggested the unknown. “We can wait there until this shower is over. It\r\nis not likely to rain so heavily very long.”\r\n\r\nThe words were very commonplace, but oh, the tone! And the smile which\r\naccompanied them! Anne felt her heart beating strangely.\r\n\r\nTogether they scurried to the pavilion and sat breathlessly down under\r\nits friendly roof. Anne laughingly held up her false umbrella.\r\n\r\n“It is when my umbrella turns inside out that I am convinced of the\r\ntotal depravity of inanimate things,” she said gaily.\r\n\r\nThe raindrops sparkled on her shining hair; its loosened rings curled\r\naround her neck and forehead. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes big and\r\nstarry. Her companion looked down at her admiringly. She felt herself\r\nblushing under his gaze. Who could he be? Why, there was a bit of the\r\nRedmond white and scarlet pinned to his coat lapel. Yet she had thought\r\nshe knew, by sight at least, all the Redmond students except the\r\nFreshmen. And this courtly youth surely was no Freshman.\r\n\r\n“We are schoolmates, I see,” he said, smiling at Anne’s colors. “That\r\nought to be sufficient introduction. My name is Royal Gardner. And you\r\nare the Miss Shirley who read the Tennyson paper at the Philomathic the\r\nother evening, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I cannot place you at all,” said Anne, frankly. “Please,\r\nwhere _do_ you belong?”\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I didn’t belong anywhere yet. I put in my Freshman and\r\nSophomore years at Redmond two years ago. I’ve been in Europe ever\r\nsince. Now I’ve come back to finish my Arts course.”\r\n\r\n“This is my Junior year, too,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“So we are classmates as well as collegemates. I am reconciled to the\r\nloss of the years that the locust has eaten,” said her companion, with\r\na world of meaning in those wonderful eyes of his.\r\n\r\nThe rain came steadily down for the best part of an hour. But the time\r\nseemed really very short. When the clouds parted and a burst of pale\r\nNovember sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pines Anne and her\r\ncompanion walked home together. By the time they had reached the gate\r\nof Patty’s Place he had asked permission to call, and had received it.\r\nAnne went in with cheeks of flame and her heart beating to her\r\nfingertips. Rusty, who climbed into her lap and tried to kiss her,\r\nfound a very absent welcome. Anne, with her soul full of romantic\r\nthrills, had no attention to spare just then for a crop-eared pussy\r\ncat.\r\n\r\nThat evening a parcel was left at Patty’s Place for Miss Shirley. It\r\nwas a box containing a dozen magnificent roses. Phil pounced\r\nimpertinently on the card that fell from it, read the name and the\r\npoetical quotation written on the back.\r\n\r\n“Royal Gardner!” she exclaimed. “Why, Anne, I didn’t know you were\r\nacquainted with Roy Gardner!”\r\n\r\n“I met him in the park this afternoon in the rain,” explained Anne\r\nhurriedly. “My umbrella turned inside out and he came to my rescue with\r\nhis.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Phil peered curiously at Anne. “And is that exceedingly\r\ncommonplace incident any reason why he should send us longstemmed roses\r\nby the dozen, with a very sentimental rhyme? Or why we should blush\r\ndivinest rosy-red when we look at his card? Anne, thy face betrayeth\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk nonsense, Phil. Do you know Mr. Gardner?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve met his two sisters, and I know of him. So does everybody\r\nworthwhile in Kingsport. The Gardners are among the richest, bluest, of\r\nBluenoses. Roy is adorably handsome and clever. Two years ago his\r\nmother’s health failed and he had to leave college and go abroad with\r\nher—his father is dead. He must have been greatly disappointed to have\r\nto give up his class, but they say he was perfectly sweet about it.\r\nFee—fi—fo—fum, Anne. I smell romance. Almost do I envy you, but not\r\nquite. After all, Roy Gardner isn’t Jonas.”\r\n\r\n“You goose!” said Anne loftily. But she lay long awake that night, nor\r\ndid she wish for sleep. Her waking fancies were more alluring than any\r\nvision of dreamland. Had the real Prince come at last? Recalling those\r\nglorious dark eyes which had gazed so deeply into her own, Anne was\r\nvery strongly inclined to think he had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\nEnter Christine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girls at Patty’s Place were dressing for the reception which the\r\nJuniors were giving for the Seniors in February. Anne surveyed herself\r\nin the mirror of the blue room with girlish satisfaction. She had a\r\nparticularly pretty gown on. Originally it had been only a simple\r\nlittle slip of cream silk with a chiffon overdress. But Phil had\r\ninsisted on taking it home with her in the Christmas holidays and\r\nembroidering tiny rosebuds all over the chiffon. Phil’s fingers were\r\ndeft, and the result was a dress which was the envy of every Redmond\r\ngirl. Even Allie Boone, whose frocks came from Paris, was wont to look\r\nwith longing eyes on that rosebud concoction as Anne trailed up the\r\nmain staircase at Redmond in it.\r\n\r\nAnne was trying the effect of a white orchid in her hair. Roy Gardner\r\nhad sent her white orchids for the reception, and she knew no other\r\nRedmond girl would have them that night—when Phil came in with admiring\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n“Anne, this is certainly your night for looking handsome. Nine nights\r\nout of ten I can easily outshine you. The tenth you blossom out\r\nsuddenly into something that eclipses me altogether. How do you manage\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the dress, dear. Fine feathers.”\r\n\r\n“’Tisn’t. The last evening you flamed out into beauty you wore your old\r\nblue flannel shirtwaist that Mrs. Lynde made you. If Roy hadn’t already\r\nlost head and heart about you he certainly would tonight. But I don’t\r\nlike orchids on you, Anne. No; it isn’t jealousy. Orchids don’t seem to\r\n_belong_ to you. They’re too exotic—too tropical—too insolent. Don’t\r\nput them in your hair, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t. I admit I’m not fond of orchids myself. I don’t think\r\nthey’re related to me. Roy doesn’t often send them—he knows I like\r\nflowers I can live with. Orchids are only things you can visit with.”\r\n\r\n“Jonas sent me some dear pink rosebuds for the evening—but—he isn’t\r\ncoming himself. He said he had to lead a prayer-meeting in the slums! I\r\ndon’t believe he wanted to come. Anne, I’m horribly afraid Jonas\r\ndoesn’t really care anything about me. And I’m trying to decide whether\r\nI’ll pine away and die, or go on and get my B.A. and be sensible and\r\nuseful.”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t possibly be sensible and useful, Phil, so you’d better\r\npine away and die,” said Anne cruelly.\r\n\r\n“Heartless Anne!”\r\n\r\n“Silly Phil! You know quite well that Jonas loves you.”\r\n\r\n“But—he won’t _tell_ me so. And I can’t _make_ him. He _looks_ it, I’ll\r\nadmit. But speak-to-me-only-with-thine-eyes isn’t a really reliable\r\nreason for embroidering doilies and hemstitching tablecloths. I don’t\r\nwant to begin such work until I’m really engaged. It would be tempting\r\nFate.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Blake is afraid to ask you to marry him, Phil. He is poor and\r\ncan’t offer you a home such as you’ve always had. You know that is the\r\nonly reason he hasn’t spoken long ago.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” agreed Phil dolefully. “Well”—brightening up—“if he\r\n_won’t_ ask me to marry him I’ll ask him, that’s all. So it’s bound to\r\ncome right. I won’t worry. By the way, Gilbert Blythe is going about\r\nconstantly with Christine Stuart. Did you know?”\r\n\r\nAnne was trying to fasten a little gold chain about her throat. She\r\nsuddenly found the clasp difficult to manage. _What_ was the matter\r\nwith it—or with her fingers?\r\n\r\n“No,” she said carelessly. “Who is Christine Stuart?”\r\n\r\n“Ronald Stuart’s sister. She’s in Kingsport this winter studying music.\r\nI haven’t seen her, but they say she’s very pretty and that Gilbert is\r\nquite crazy over her. How angry I was when you refused Gilbert, Anne.\r\nBut Roy Gardner was foreordained for you. I can see that now. You were\r\nright, after all.”\r\n\r\nAnne did not blush, as she usually did when the girls assumed that her\r\neventual marriage to Roy Gardner was a settled thing. All at once she\r\nfelt rather dull. Phil’s chatter seemed trivial and the reception a\r\nbore. She boxed poor Rusty’s ears.\r\n\r\n“Get off that cushion instantly, you cat, you! Why don’t you stay down\r\nwhere you belong?”\r\n\r\nAnne picked up her orchids and went downstairs, where Aunt Jamesina was\r\npresiding over a row of coats hung before the fire to warm. Roy Gardner\r\nwas waiting for Anne and teasing the Sarah-cat while he waited. The\r\nSarah-cat did not approve of him. She always turned her back on him.\r\nBut everybody else at Patty’s Place liked him very much. Aunt Jamesina,\r\ncarried away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy, and the\r\npleading tones of his delightful voice, declared he was the nicest\r\nyoung man she ever knew, and that Anne was a very fortunate girl. Such\r\nremarks made Anne restive. Roy’s wooing had certainly been as romantic\r\nas girlish heart could desire, but—she wished Aunt Jamesina and the\r\ngirls would not take things so for granted. When Roy murmured a\r\npoetical compliment as he helped her on with her coat, she did not\r\nblush and thrill as usual; and he found her rather silent in their\r\nbrief walk to Redmond. He thought she looked a little pale when she\r\ncame out of the coeds’ dressing room; but as they entered the reception\r\nroom her color and sparkle suddenly returned to her. She turned to Roy\r\nwith her gayest expression. He smiled back at her with what Phil called\r\n“his deep, black, velvety smile.” Yet she really did not see Roy at\r\nall. She was acutely conscious that Gilbert was standing under the\r\npalms just across the room talking to a girl who must be Christine\r\nStuart.\r\n\r\nShe was very handsome, in the stately style destined to become rather\r\nmassive in middle life. A tall girl, with large dark-blue eyes, ivory\r\noutlines, and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair.\r\n\r\n“She looks just as I’ve always wanted to look,” thought Anne miserably.\r\n“Rose-leaf complexion—starry violet eyes—raven hair—yes, she has them\r\nall. It’s a wonder her name isn’t Cordelia Fitzgerald into the bargain!\r\nBut I don’t believe her figure is as good as mine, and her nose\r\ncertainly isn’t.”\r\n\r\nAnne felt a little comforted by this conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\nMutual Confidences\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch came in that winter like the meekest and mildest of lambs,\r\nbringing days that were crisp and golden and tingling, each followed by\r\na frosty pink twilight which gradually lost itself in an elfland of\r\nmoonshine.\r\n\r\nOver the girls at Patty’s Place was falling the shadow of April\r\nexaminations. They were studying hard; even Phil had settled down to\r\ntext and notebooks with a doggedness not to be expected of her.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to take the Johnson Scholarship in Mathematics,” she\r\nannounced calmly. “I could take the one in Greek easily, but I’d rather\r\ntake the mathematical one because I want to prove to Jonas that I’m\r\nreally enormously clever.”\r\n\r\n“Jonas likes you better for your big brown eyes and your crooked smile\r\nthan for all the brains you carry under your curls,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“When I was a girl it wasn’t considered lady-like to know anything\r\nabout Mathematics,” said Aunt Jamesina. “But times have changed. I\r\ndon’t know that it’s all for the better. Can you cook, Phil?”\r\n\r\n“No, I never cooked anything in my life except a gingerbread and it was\r\na failure—flat in the middle and hilly round the edges. You know the\r\nkind. But, Aunty, when I begin in good earnest to learn to cook don’t\r\nyou think the brains that enable me to win a mathematical scholarship\r\nwill also enable me to learn cooking just as well?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” said Aunt Jamesina cautiously. “I am not decrying the higher\r\neducation of women. My daughter is an M.A. She can cook, too. But I\r\ntaught her to cook _before_ I let a college professor teach her\r\nMathematics.”\r\n\r\nIn mid-March came a letter from Miss Patty Spofford, saying that she\r\nand Miss Maria had decided to remain abroad for another year.\r\n\r\n“So you may have Patty’s Place next winter, too,” she wrote. “Maria and\r\nI are going to run over Egypt. I want to see the Sphinx once before I\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“Fancy those two dames ‘running over Egypt’! I wonder if they’ll look\r\nup at the Sphinx and knit,” laughed Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad we can keep Patty’s Place for another year,” said Stella.\r\n“I was afraid they’d come back. And then our jolly little nest here\r\nwould be broken up—and we poor callow nestlings thrown out on the cruel\r\nworld of boardinghouses again.”\r\n\r\n“I’m off for a tramp in the park,” announced Phil, tossing her book\r\naside. “I think when I am eighty I’ll be glad I went for a walk in the\r\npark tonight.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Anne.\r\n\r\n“Come with me and I’ll tell you, honey.”\r\n\r\nThey captured in their ramble all the mysteries and magics of a March\r\nevening. Very still and mild it was, wrapped in a great, white,\r\nbrooding silence—a silence which was yet threaded through with many\r\nlittle silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened as much\r\nwith your soul as your ears. The girls wandered down a long pineland\r\naisle that seemed to lead right out into the heart of a deep-red,\r\noverflowing winter sunset.\r\n\r\n“I’d go home and write a poem this blessed minute if I only knew how,”\r\ndeclared Phil, pausing in an open space where a rosy light was staining\r\nthe green tips of the pines. “It’s all so wonderful here—this great,\r\nwhite stillness, and those dark trees that always seem to be thinking.”\r\n\r\n“‘The woods were God’s first temples,’” quoted Anne softly. “One can’t\r\nhelp feeling reverent and adoring in such a place. I always feel so\r\nnear Him when I walk among the pines.”\r\n\r\n“Anne, I’m the happiest girl in the world,” confessed Phil suddenly.\r\n\r\n“So Mr. Blake has asked you to marry him at last?” said Anne calmly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. And I sneezed three times while he was asking me. Wasn’t that\r\nhorrid? But I said ‘yes’ almost before he finished—I was so afraid he\r\nmight change his mind and stop. I’m besottedly happy. I couldn’t really\r\nbelieve before that Jonas would ever care for frivolous me.”\r\n\r\n“Phil, you’re not really frivolous,” said Anne gravely. “‘Way down\r\nunderneath that frivolous exterior of yours you’ve got a dear, loyal,\r\nwomanly little soul. Why do you hide it so?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it, Queen Anne. You are right—I’m not frivolous at heart.\r\nBut there’s a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and I can’t take it\r\noff. As Mrs. Poyser says, I’d have to be hatched over again and hatched\r\ndifferent before I could change it. But Jonas knows the real me and\r\nloves me, frivolity and all. And I love him. I never was so surprised\r\nin my life as I was when I found out I loved him. I’d never thought it\r\npossible to fall in love with an ugly man. Fancy me coming down to one\r\nsolitary beau. And one named Jonas! But I mean to call him Jo. That’s\r\nsuch a nice, crisp little name. I couldn’t nickname Alonzo.”\r\n\r\n“What about Alec and Alonzo?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I told them at Christmas that I never could marry either of them.\r\nIt seems so funny now to remember that I ever thought it possible that\r\nI might. They felt so badly I just cried over both of them—howled. But\r\nI knew there was only one man in the world I could ever marry. I had\r\nmade up my own mind for once and it was real easy, too. It’s very\r\ndelightful to feel so sure, and know it’s your own sureness and not\r\nsomebody else’s.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose you’ll be able to keep it up?”\r\n\r\n“Making up my mind, you mean? I don’t know, but Jo has given me a\r\nsplendid rule. He says, when I’m perplexed, just to do what I would\r\nwish I had done when I shall be eighty. Anyhow, Jo can make up his mind\r\nquickly enough, and it would be uncomfortable to have too much mind in\r\nthe same house.”\r\n\r\n“What will your father and mother say?”\r\n\r\n“Father won’t say much. He thinks everything I do right. But mother\r\n_will_ talk. Oh, her tongue will be as Byrney as her nose. But in the\r\nend it will be all right.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to give up a good many things you’ve always had, when you\r\nmarry Mr. Blake, Phil.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ll have _him_. I won’t miss the other things. We’re to be\r\nmarried a year from next June. Jo graduates from St. Columbia this\r\nspring, you know. Then he’s going to take a little mission church down\r\non Patterson Street in the slums. Fancy me in the slums! But I’d go\r\nthere or to Greenland’s icy mountains with him.”\r\n\r\n“And this is the girl who would _never_ marry a man who wasn’t rich,”\r\ncommented Anne to a young pine tree.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t cast up the follies of my youth to me. I shall be poor as\r\ngaily as I’ve been rich. You’ll see. I’m going to learn how to cook and\r\nmake over dresses. I’ve learned how to market since I’ve lived at\r\nPatty’s Place; and once I taught a Sunday School class for a whole\r\nsummer. Aunt Jamesina says I’ll ruin Jo’s career if I marry him. But I\r\nwon’t. I know I haven’t much sense or sobriety, but I’ve got what is\r\never so much better—the knack of making people like me. There is a man\r\nin Bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayer-meeting. He\r\nsays, ‘If you can’t thine like an electric thtar thine like a\r\ncandlethtick.’ I’ll be Jo’s little candlestick.”\r\n\r\n“Phil, you’re incorrigible. Well, I love you so much that I can’t make\r\nnice, light, congratulatory little speeches. But I’m heart-glad of your\r\nhappiness.”\r\n\r\n“I know. Those big gray eyes of yours are brimming over with real\r\nfriendship, Anne. Some day I’ll look the same way at you. You’re going\r\nto marry Roy, aren’t you, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Philippa, did you ever hear of the famous Betty Baxter, who\r\n‘refused a man before he’d axed her’? I am not going to emulate that\r\ncelebrated lady by either refusing or accepting any one before he\r\n‘axes’ me.”\r\n\r\n“All Redmond knows that Roy is crazy about you,” said Phil candidly.\r\n“And you _do_ love him, don’t you, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“I—I suppose so,” said Anne reluctantly. She felt that she ought to be\r\nblushing while making such a confession; but she was not; on the other\r\nhand, she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about Gilbert\r\nBlythe or Christine Stuart in her hearing. Gilbert Blythe and Christine\r\nStuart were nothing to her—absolutely nothing. But Anne had given up\r\ntrying to analyze the reason of her blushes. As for Roy, of course she\r\nwas in love with him—madly so. How could she help it? Was he not her\r\nideal? Who could resist those glorious dark eyes, and that pleading\r\nvoice? Were not half the Redmond girls wildly envious? And what a\r\ncharming sonnet he had sent her, with a box of violets, on her\r\nbirthday! Anne knew every word of it by heart. It was very good stuff\r\nof its kind, too. Not exactly up to the level of Keats or\r\nShakespeare—even Anne was not so deeply in love as to think that. But\r\nit was very tolerable magazine verse. And it was addressed to _her_—not\r\nto Laura or Beatrice or the Maid of Athens, but to her, Anne Shirley.\r\nTo be told in rhythmical cadences that her eyes were stars of the\r\nmorning—that her cheek had the flush it stole from the sunrise—that her\r\nlips were redder than the roses of Paradise, was thrillingly romantic.\r\nGilbert would never have dreamed of writing a sonnet to her eyebrows.\r\nBut then, Gilbert could see a joke. She had once told Roy a funny\r\nstory—and he had not seen the point of it. She recalled the chummy\r\nlaugh she and Gilbert had had together over it, and wondered uneasily\r\nif life with a man who had no sense of humor might not be somewhat\r\nuninteresting in the long run. But who could expect a melancholy,\r\ninscrutable hero to see the humorous side of things? It would be flatly\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII\r\nA June Evening\r\n\r\n\r\n“I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always\r\nJune,” said Anne, as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit\r\norchard to the front door steps, where Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were\r\nsitting, talking over Mrs. Samson Coates’ funeral, which they had\r\nattended that day. Dora sat between them, diligently studying her\r\nlessons; but Davy was sitting tailor-fashion on the grass, looking as\r\ngloomy and depressed as his single dimple would let him.\r\n\r\n“You’d get tired of it,” said Marilla, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“I daresay; but just now I feel that it would take me a long time to\r\nget tired of it, if it were all as charming as today. Everything loves\r\nJune. Davy-boy, why this melancholy November face in blossom-time?”\r\n\r\n“I’m just sick and tired of living,” said the youthful pessimist.\r\n\r\n“At ten years? Dear me, how sad!”\r\n\r\n“I’m not making fun,” said Davy with dignity. “I’m\r\ndis—dis—discouraged”—bringing out the big word with a valiant effort.\r\n\r\n“Why and wherefore?” asked Anne, sitting down beside him.\r\n\r\n“’Cause the new teacher that come when Mr. Holmes got sick give me ten\r\nsums to do for Monday. It’ll take me all day tomorrow to do them. It\r\nisn’t fair to have to work Saturdays. Milty Boulter said he wouldn’t do\r\nthem, but Marilla says I’ve got to. I don’t like Miss Carson a bit.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk like that about your teacher, Davy Keith,” said Mrs. Rachel\r\nseverely. “Miss Carson is a very fine girl. There is no nonsense about\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t sound very attractive,” laughed Anne. “I like people to\r\nhave a little nonsense about them. But I’m inclined to have a better\r\nopinion of Miss Carson than you have. I saw her in prayer-meeting last\r\nnight, and she has a pair of eyes that can’t always look sensible. Now,\r\nDavy-boy, take heart of grace. ‘Tomorrow will bring another day’ and\r\nI’ll help you with the sums as far as in me lies. Don’t waste this\r\nlovely hour ’twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t,” said Davy, brightening up. “If you help me with the\r\nsums I’ll have ’em done in time to go fishing with Milty. I wish old\r\nAunt Atossa’s funeral was tomorrow instead of today. I wanted to go to\r\nit ’cause Milty said his mother said Aunt Atossa would be sure to rise\r\nup in her coffin and say sarcastic things to the folks that come to see\r\nher buried. But Marilla said she didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough,” said Mrs. Lynde\r\nsolemnly. “I never saw her look so pleasant before, that’s what. Well,\r\nthere weren’t many tears shed over her, poor old soul. The Elisha\r\nWrights are thankful to be rid of her, and I can’t say I blame them a\r\nmite.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not\r\nleave one person behind you who is sorry you are gone,” said Anne,\r\nshuddering.\r\n\r\n“Nobody except her parents ever loved poor Atossa, that’s certain, not\r\neven her husband,” averred Mrs. Lynde. “She was his fourth wife. He’d\r\nsort of got into the habit of marrying. He only lived a few years after\r\nhe married her. The doctor said he died of dyspepsia, but I shall\r\nalways maintain that he died of Atossa’s tongue, that’s what. Poor\r\nsoul, she always knew everything about her neighbors, but she never was\r\nvery well acquainted with herself. Well, she’s gone anyhow; and I\r\nsuppose the next excitement will be Diana’s wedding.”\r\n\r\n“It seems funny and horrible to think of Diana’s being married,” sighed\r\nAnne, hugging her knees and looking through the gap in the Haunted Wood\r\nto the light that was shining in Diana’s room.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what’s horrible about it, when she’s doing so well,” said\r\nMrs. Lynde emphatically. “Fred Wright has a fine farm and he is a model\r\nyoung man.”\r\n\r\n“He certainly isn’t the wild, dashing, wicked, young man Diana once\r\nwanted to marry,” smiled Anne. “Fred is extremely good.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what he ought to be. Would you want Diana to marry a\r\nwicked man? Or marry one yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. I wouldn’t want to marry anybody who was wicked, but I think\r\nI’d like it if he _could_ be wicked and _wouldn’t_. Now, Fred is\r\n_hopelessly_ good.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have more sense some day, I hope,” said Marilla.\r\n\r\nMarilla spoke rather bitterly. She was grievously disappointed. She\r\nknew Anne had refused Gilbert Blythe. Avonlea gossip buzzed over the\r\nfact, which had leaked out, nobody knew how. Perhaps Charlie Sloane had\r\nguessed and told his guesses for truth. Perhaps Diana had betrayed it\r\nto Fred and Fred had been indiscreet. At all events it was known; Mrs.\r\nBlythe no longer asked Anne, in public or private, if she had heard\r\nlately from Gilbert, but passed her by with a frosty bow. Anne, who had\r\nalways liked Gilbert’s merry, young-hearted mother, was grieved in\r\nsecret over this. Marilla said nothing; but Mrs. Lynde gave Anne many\r\nexasperated digs about it, until fresh gossip reached that worthy lady,\r\nthrough the medium of Moody Spurgeon MacPherson’s mother, that Anne had\r\nanother “beau” at college, who was rich and handsome and good all in\r\none. After that Mrs. Rachel held her tongue, though she still wished in\r\nher inmost heart that Anne had accepted Gilbert. Riches were all very\r\nwell; but even Mrs. Rachel, practical soul though she was, did not\r\nconsider them the one essential. If Anne “liked” the Handsome Unknown\r\nbetter than Gilbert there was nothing more to be said; but Mrs. Rachel\r\nwas dreadfully afraid that Anne was going to make the mistake of\r\nmarrying for money. Marilla knew Anne too well to fear this; but she\r\nfelt that something in the universal scheme of things had gone sadly\r\nawry.\r\n\r\n“What is to be, will be,” said Mrs. Rachel gloomily, “and what isn’t to\r\nbe happens sometimes. I can’t help believing it’s going to happen in\r\nAnne’s case, if Providence doesn’t interfere, that’s what.” Mrs. Rachel\r\nsighed. She was afraid Providence wouldn’t interfere; and she didn’t\r\ndare to.\r\n\r\nAnne had wandered down to the Dryad’s Bubble and was curled up among\r\nthe ferns at the root of the big white birch where she and Gilbert had\r\nso often sat in summers gone by. He had gone into the newspaper office\r\nagain when college closed, and Avonlea seemed very dull without him. He\r\nnever wrote to her, and Anne missed the letters that never came. To be\r\nsure, Roy wrote twice a week; his letters were exquisite compositions\r\nwhich would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography. Anne felt\r\nherself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them; but\r\nher heart never gave the queer, quick, painful bound at sight of his\r\nletters which it had given one day when Mrs. Hiram Sloane had handed\r\nher out an envelope addressed in Gilbert’s black, upright handwriting.\r\nAnne had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerly—to find a\r\ntypewritten copy of some college society report—“only that and nothing\r\nmore.” Anne flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to\r\nwrite an especially nice epistle to Roy.\r\n\r\nDiana was to be married in five more days. The gray house at Orchard\r\nSlope was in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing,\r\nfor there was to be a big, old-timey wedding. Anne, of course, was to\r\nbe bridesmaid, as had been arranged when they were twelve years old,\r\nand Gilbert was coming from Kingsport to be best man. Anne was enjoying\r\nthe excitement of the various preparations, but under it all she\r\ncarried a little heartache. She was, in a sense, losing her dear old\r\nchum; Diana’s new home would be two miles from Green Gables, and the\r\nold constant companionship could never be theirs again. Anne looked up\r\nat Diana’s light and thought how it had beaconed to her for many years;\r\nbut soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more. Two big,\r\npainful tears welled up in her gray eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she thought, “how horrible it is that people have to grow up—and\r\nmarry—and _change!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX\r\nDiana’s Wedding\r\n\r\n\r\n“After all, the only real roses are the pink ones,” said Anne, as she\r\ntied white ribbon around Diana’s bouquet in the westward-looking gable\r\nat Orchard Slope. “They are the flowers of love and faith.”\r\n\r\nDiana was standing nervously in the middle of the room, arrayed in her\r\nbridal white, her black curls frosted over with the film of her wedding\r\nveil. Anne had draped that veil, in accordance with the sentimental\r\ncompact of years before.\r\n\r\n“It’s all pretty much as I used to imagine it long ago, when I wept\r\nover your inevitable marriage and our consequent parting,” she laughed.\r\n“You are the bride of my dreams, Diana, with the ‘lovely misty veil’;\r\nand I am _your_ bridesmaid. But, alas! I haven’t the puffed\r\nsleeves—though these short lace ones are even prettier. Neither is my\r\nheart wholly breaking nor do I exactly hate Fred.”\r\n\r\n“We are not really parting, Anne,” protested Diana. “I’m not going far\r\naway. We’ll love each other just as much as ever. We’ve always kept\r\nthat ‘oath’ of friendship we swore long ago, haven’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. We’ve kept it faithfully. We’ve had a beautiful friendship,\r\nDiana. We’ve never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word;\r\nand I hope it will always be so. But things can’t be quite the same\r\nafter this. You’ll have other interests. I’ll just be on the outside.\r\nBut ‘such is life’ as Mrs. Rachel says. Mrs. Rachel has given you one\r\nof her beloved knitted quilts of the ‘tobacco stripe’ pattern, and she\r\nsays when I am married she’ll give me one, too.”\r\n\r\n“The mean thing about your getting married is that I won’t be able to\r\nbe your bridesmaid,” lamented Diana.\r\n\r\n“I’m to be Phil’s bridesmaid next June, when she marries Mr. Blake, and\r\nthen I must stop, for you know the proverb ‘three times a bridesmaid,\r\nnever a bride,’” said Anne, peeping through the window over the pink\r\nand snow of the blossoming orchard beneath. “Here comes the minister,\r\nDiana.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anne,” gasped Diana, suddenly turning very pale and beginning to\r\ntremble. “Oh, Anne—I’m so nervous—I can’t go through with it—Anne, I\r\nknow I’m going to faint.”\r\n\r\n“If you do I’ll drag you down to the rainwater hogshed and drop you\r\nin,” said Anne unsympathetically. “Cheer up, dearest. Getting married\r\ncan’t be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony. See\r\nhow cool and composed I am, and take courage.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till your turn comes, Miss Anne. Oh, Anne, I hear father coming\r\nupstairs. Give me my bouquet. Is my veil right? Am I very pale?”\r\n\r\n“You look just lovely. Di, darling, kiss me good-bye for the last time.\r\nDiana Barry will never kiss me again.”\r\n\r\n“Diana Wright will, though. There, mother’s calling. Come.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the simple, old-fashioned way in vogue then, Anne went down\r\nto the parlor on Gilbert’s arm. They met at the top of the stairs for\r\nthe first time since they had left Kingsport, for Gilbert had arrived\r\nonly that day. Gilbert shook hands courteously. He was looking very\r\nwell, though, as Anne instantly noted, rather thin. He was not pale;\r\nthere was a flush on his cheek that had burned into it as Anne came\r\nalong the hall towards him, in her soft, white dress with\r\nlilies-of-the-valley in the shining masses of her hair. As they entered\r\nthe crowded parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around\r\nthe room. “What a fine-looking pair they are,” whispered the\r\nimpressible Mrs. Rachel to Marilla.\r\n\r\nFred ambled in alone, with a very red face, and then Diana swept in on\r\nher father’s arm. She did not faint, and nothing untoward occurred to\r\ninterrupt the ceremony. Feasting and merry-making followed; then, as\r\nthe evening waned, Fred and Diana drove away through the moonlight to\r\ntheir new home, and Gilbert walked with Anne to Green Gables.\r\n\r\nSomething of their old comradeship had returned during the informal\r\nmirth of the evening. Oh, it was nice to be walking over that\r\nwell-known road with Gilbert again!\r\n\r\nThe night was so very still that one should have been able to hear the\r\nwhisper of roses in blossom—the laughter of daisies—the piping of\r\ngrasses—many sweet sounds, all tangled up together. The beauty of\r\nmoonlight on familiar fields irradiated the world.\r\n\r\n“Can’t we take a ramble up Lovers’ Lane before you go in?” asked\r\nGilbert as they crossed the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters, in\r\nwhich the moon lay like a great, drowned blossom of gold.\r\n\r\nAnne assented readily. Lovers’ Lane was a veritable path in a fairyland\r\nthat night—a shimmering, mysterious place, full of wizardry in the\r\nwhite-woven enchantment of moonlight. There had been a time when such a\r\nwalk with Gilbert through Lovers’ Lane would have been far too\r\ndangerous. But Roy and Christine had made it very safe now. Anne found\r\nherself thinking a good deal about Christine as she chatted lightly to\r\nGilbert. She had met her several times before leaving Kingsport, and\r\nhad been charmingly sweet to her. Christine had also been charmingly\r\nsweet. Indeed, they were a most cordial pair. But for all that, their\r\nacquaintance had not ripened into friendship. Evidently Christine was\r\nnot a kindred spirit.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to be in Avonlea all summer?” asked Gilbert.\r\n\r\n“No. I’m going down east to Valley Road next week. Esther Haythorne\r\nwants me to teach for her through July and August. They have a summer\r\nterm in that school, and Esther isn’t feeling well. So I’m going to\r\nsubstitute for her. In one way I don’t mind. Do you know, I’m beginning\r\nto feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now? It makes me\r\nsorry—but it’s true. It’s quite appalling to see the number of children\r\nwho have shot up into big boys and girls—really young men and\r\nwomen—these past two years. Half of my pupils are grown up. It makes me\r\nfeel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used\r\nto fill.”\r\n\r\nAnne laughed and sighed. She felt very old and mature and wise—which\r\nshowed how young she was. She told herself that she longed greatly to\r\ngo back to those dear merry days when life was seen through a rosy mist\r\nof hope and illusion, and possessed an indefinable something that had\r\npassed away forever. Where was it now—the glory and the dream?\r\n\r\n“‘So wags the world away,’” quoted Gilbert practically, and a trifle\r\nabsently. Anne wondered if he were thinking of Christine. Oh, Avonlea\r\nwas going to be so lonely now—with Diana gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX\r\nMrs. Skinner’s Romance\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne stepped off the train at Valley Road station and looked about to\r\nsee if any one had come to meet her. She was to board with a certain\r\nMiss Janet Sweet, but she saw no one who answered in the least to her\r\npreconception of that lady, as formed from Esther’s letter. The only\r\nperson in sight was an elderly woman, sitting in a wagon with mail bags\r\npiled around her. Two hundred would have been a charitable guess at her\r\nweight; her face was as round and red as a harvest-moon and almost as\r\nfeatureless. She wore a tight, black, cashmere dress, made in the\r\nfashion of ten years ago, a little dusty black straw hat trimmed with\r\nbows of yellow ribbon, and faded black lace mits.\r\n\r\n“Here, you,” she called, waving her whip at Anne. “Are you the new\r\nValley Road schoolma’am?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I thought so. Valley Road is noted for its good-looking\r\nschoolma’ams, just as Millersville is noted for its humly ones. Janet\r\nSweet asked me this morning if I could bring you out. I said, ‘Sartin I\r\nkin, if she don’t mind being scrunched up some. This rig of mine’s\r\nkinder small for the mail bags and I’m some heftier than Thomas!’ Just\r\nwait, miss, till I shift these bags a bit and I’ll tuck you in somehow.\r\nIt’s only two miles to Janet’s. Her next-door neighbor’s hired boy is\r\ncoming for your trunk tonight. My name is Skinner—Amelia Skinner.”\r\n\r\nAnne was eventually tucked in, exchanging amused smiles with herself\r\nduring the process.\r\n\r\n“Jog along, black mare,” commanded Mrs. Skinner, gathering up the reins\r\nin her pudgy hands. “This is my first trip on the mail rowte. Thomas\r\nwanted to hoe his turnips today so he asked me to come. So I jest sot\r\ndown and took a standing-up snack and started. I sorter like it. O’\r\ncourse it’s rather tejus. Part of the time I sits and thinks and the\r\nrest I jest sits. Jog along, black mare. I want to git home airly.\r\nThomas is terrible lonesome when I’m away. You see, we haven’t been\r\nmarried very long.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Anne politely.\r\n\r\n“Just a month. Thomas courted me for quite a spell, though. It was real\r\nromantic.” Anne tried to picture Mrs. Skinner on speaking terms with\r\nromance and failed.\r\n\r\n“Oh?” she said again.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Y’see, there was another man after me. Jog along, black mare. I’d\r\nbeen a widder so long folks had given up expecting me to marry again.\r\nBut when my darter—she’s a schoolma’am like you—went out West to teach\r\nI felt real lonesome and wasn’t nowise sot against the idea. Bime-by\r\nThomas began to come up and so did the other feller—William Obadiah\r\nSeaman, his name was. For a long time I couldn’t make up my mind which\r\nof them to take, and they kep’ coming and coming, and I kep’ worrying.\r\nY’see, W.O. was rich—he had a fine place and carried considerable\r\nstyle. He was by far the best match. Jog along, black mare.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you marry him?” asked Anne.\r\n\r\n“Well, y’see, he didn’t love me,” answered Mrs. Skinner, solemnly.\r\n\r\nAnne opened her eyes widely and looked at Mrs. Skinner. But there was\r\nnot a glint of humor on that lady’s face. Evidently Mrs. Skinner saw\r\nnothing amusing in her own case.\r\n\r\n“He’d been a widder-man for three yers, and his sister kept house for\r\nhim. Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his\r\nhouse. It was worth looking after, too, mind you that. It’s a handsome\r\nhouse. Jog along, black mare. As for Thomas, he was poor, and if his\r\nhouse didn’t leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said\r\nfor it, though it looks kind of pictureaskew. But, y’see, I loved\r\nThomas, and I didn’t care one red cent for W.O. So I argued it out with\r\nmyself. ‘Sarah Crowe,’ say I—my first was a Crowe—‘you can marry your\r\nrich man if you like but you won’t be happy. Folks can’t get along\r\ntogether in this world without a little bit of love. You’d just better\r\ntie up to Thomas, for he loves you and you love him and nothing else\r\nain’t going to do you.’ Jog along, black mare. So I told Thomas I’d\r\ntake him. All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past\r\nW.O.’s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me\r\nin the swithers again. But now I never think of it at all, and I’m just\r\nthat comfortable and happy with Thomas. Jog along, black mare.”\r\n\r\n“How did William Obadiah take it?” queried Anne.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he rumpussed a bit. But he’s going to see a skinny old maid in\r\nMillersville now, and I guess she’ll take him fast enough. She’ll make\r\nhim a better wife than his first did. W.O. never wanted to marry her.\r\nHe just asked her to marry him ’cause his father wanted him to, never\r\ndreaming but that she’d say ‘no.’ But mind you, she said ‘yes.’ There\r\nwas a predicament for you. Jog along, black mare. She was a great\r\nhousekeeper, but most awful mean. She wore the same bonnet for eighteen\r\nyears. Then she got a new one and W.O. met her on the road and didn’t\r\nknow her. Jog along, black mare. I feel that I’d a narrer escape. I\r\nmight have married him and been most awful miserable, like my poor\r\ncousin, Jane Ann. Jane Ann married a rich man she didn’t care anything\r\nabout, and she hasn’t the life of a dog. She come to see me last week\r\nand says, says she, ‘Sarah Skinner, I envy you. I’d rather live in a\r\nlittle hut on the side of the road with a man I was fond of than in my\r\nbig house with the one I’ve got.’ Jane Ann’s man ain’t such a bad sort,\r\nnuther, though he’s so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the\r\nthermometer’s at ninety. The only way to git him to do anything is to\r\ncoax him to do the opposite. But there ain’t any love to smooth things\r\ndown and it’s a poor way of living. Jog along, black mare. There’s\r\nJanet’s place in the hollow—‘Wayside,’ she calls it. Quite\r\npictureaskew, ain’t it? I guess you’ll be glad to git out of this, with\r\nall them mail bags jamming round you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I have enjoyed my drive with you very much,” said Anne\r\nsincerely.\r\n\r\n“Git away now!” said Mrs. Skinner, highly flattered. “Wait till I tell\r\nThomas that. He always feels dretful tickled when I git a compliment.\r\nJog along, black mare. Well, here we are. I hope you’ll git on well in\r\nthe school, miss. There’s a short cut to it through the ma’sh back of\r\nJanet’s. If you take that way be awful keerful. If you once got stuck\r\nin that black mud you’d be sucked right down and never seen or heard\r\ntell of again till the day of judgment, like Adam Palmer’s cow. Jog\r\nalong, black mare.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI\r\nAnne to Philippa\r\n\r\n\r\n“Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon, greeting.\r\n\r\n“Well-beloved, it’s high time I was writing you. Here am I, installed\r\nonce more as a country ‘schoolma’am’ at Valley Road, boarding at\r\n‘Wayside,’ the home of Miss Janet Sweet. Janet is a dear soul and very\r\nnicelooking; tall, but not over-tall; stoutish, yet with a certain\r\nrestraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to\r\nbe overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois. She has a knot of\r\nsoft, crimpy, brown hair with a thread of gray in it, a sunny face with\r\nrosy cheeks, and big, kind eyes as blue as forget-me-nots. Moreover,\r\nshe is one of those delightful, old-fashioned cooks who don’t care a\r\nbit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of\r\nfat things.\r\n\r\n“I like her; and she likes me—principally, it seems, because she had a\r\nsister named Anne who died young.\r\n\r\n“‘I’m real glad to see you,’ she said briskly, when I landed in her\r\nyard. ‘My, you don’t look a mite like I expected. I was sure you’d be\r\ndark—my sister Anne was dark. And here you’re redheaded!’\r\n\r\n“For a few minutes I thought I wasn’t going to like Janet as much as I\r\nhad expected at first sight. Then I reminded myself that I really must\r\nbe more sensible than to be prejudiced against any one simply because\r\nshe called my hair red. Probably the word ‘auburn’ was not in Janet’s\r\nvocabulary at all.\r\n\r\n“‘Wayside’ is a dear sort of little spot. The house is small and white,\r\nset down in a delightful little hollow that drops away from the road.\r\nBetween road and house is an orchard and flower-garden all mixed up\r\ntogether. The front door walk is bordered with quahog\r\nclam-shells—‘cow-hawks,’ Janet calls them; there is Virginia Creeper\r\nover the porch and moss on the roof. My room is a neat little spot ‘off\r\nthe parlor’—just big enough for the bed and me. Over the head of my bed\r\nthere is a picture of Robby Burns standing at Highland Mary’s grave,\r\nshadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree. Robby’s face is so\r\nlugubrious that it is no wonder I have bad dreams. Why, the first night\r\nI was here I dreamed I _couldn’t laugh_.\r\n\r\n“The parlor is tiny and neat. Its one window is so shaded by a huge\r\nwillow that the room has a grotto-like effect of emerald gloom. There\r\nare wonderful tidies on the chairs, and gay mats on the floor, and\r\nbooks and cards carefully arranged on a round table, and vases of dried\r\ngrass on the mantel-piece. Between the vases is a cheerful decoration\r\nof preserved coffin plates—five in all, pertaining respectively to\r\nJanet’s father and mother, a brother, her sister Anne, and a hired man\r\nwho died here once! If I go suddenly insane some of these days ‘know\r\nall men by these presents’ that those coffin-plates have caused it.\r\n\r\n“But it’s all delightful and I said so. Janet loved me for it, just as\r\nshe detested poor Esther because Esther had said so much shade was\r\nunhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed. Now, I glory\r\nin feather-beds, and the more unhygienic and feathery they are the more\r\nI glory. Janet says it is such a comfort to see me eat; she had been so\r\nafraid I would be like Miss Haythorne, who wouldn’t eat anything but\r\nfruit and hot water for breakfast and tried to make Janet give up\r\nfrying things. Esther is really a dear girl, but she is rather given to\r\nfads. The trouble is that she hasn’t enough imagination and HAS a\r\ntendency to indigestion.\r\n\r\n“Janet told me I could have the use of the parlor when any young men\r\ncalled! I don’t think there are many to call. I haven’t seen a young\r\nman in Valley Road yet, except the next-door hired boy—Sam Toliver, a\r\nvery tall, lank, tow-haired youth. He came over one evening recently\r\nand sat for an hour on the garden fence, near the front porch where\r\nJanet and I were doing fancy-work. The only remarks he volunteered in\r\nall that time were, ‘Hev a peppermint, miss! Dew now-fine thing for\r\ncar_arrh_, peppermints,’ and, ‘Powerful lot o’ jump-grasses round here\r\nternight. Yep.’\r\n\r\n“But there is a love affair going on here. It seems to be my fortune to\r\nbe mixed up, more or less actively, with elderly love affairs. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Irving always say that I brought about their marriage. Mrs.\r\nStephen Clark of Carmody persists in being most grateful to me for a\r\nsuggestion which somebody else would probably have made if I hadn’t. I\r\ndo really think, though, that Ludovic Speed would never have got any\r\nfurther along than placid courtship if I had not helped him and\r\nTheodora Dix out.\r\n\r\n“In the present affair I am only a passive spectator. I’ve tried once\r\nto help things along and made an awful mess of it. So I shall not\r\nmeddle again. I’ll tell you all about it when we meet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII\r\nTea with Mrs. Douglas\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first Thursday night of Anne’s sojourn in Valley Road Janet\r\nasked her to go to prayer-meeting. Janet blossomed out like a rose to\r\nattend that prayer-meeting. She wore a pale-blue, pansy-sprinkled\r\nmuslin dress with more ruffles than one would ever have supposed\r\neconomical Janet could be guilty of, and a white leghorn hat with pink\r\nroses and three ostrich feathers on it. Anne felt quite amazed. Later\r\non, she found out Janet’s motive in so arraying herself—a motive as old\r\nas Eden.\r\n\r\nValley Road prayer-meetings seemed to be essentially feminine. There\r\nwere thirty-two women present, two half-grown boys, and one solitary\r\nman, beside the minister. Anne found herself studying this man. He was\r\nnot handsome or young or graceful; he had remarkably long legs—so long\r\nthat he had to keep them coiled up under his chair to dispose of\r\nthem—and he was stoop-shouldered. His hands were big, his hair wanted\r\nbarbering, and his moustache was unkempt. But Anne thought she liked\r\nhis face; it was kind and honest and tender; there was something else\r\nin it, too—just what, Anne found it hard to define. She finally\r\nconcluded that this man had suffered and been strong, and it had been\r\nmade manifest in his face. There was a sort of patient, humorous\r\nendurance in his expression which indicated that he would go to the\r\nstake if need be, but would keep on looking pleasant until he really\r\nhad to begin squirming.\r\n\r\nWhen prayer-meeting was over this man came up to Janet and said,\r\n\r\n“May I see you home, Janet?”\r\n\r\nJanet took his arm—“as primly and shyly as if she were no more than\r\nsixteen, having her first escort home,” Anne told the girls at Patty’s\r\nPlace later on.\r\n\r\n“Miss Shirley, permit me to introduce Mr. Douglas,” she said stiffly.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas nodded and said, “I was looking at you in prayer-meeting,\r\nmiss, and thinking what a nice little girl you were.”\r\n\r\nSuch a speech from ninety-nine people out of a hundred would have\r\nannoyed Anne bitterly; but the way in which Mr. Douglas said it made\r\nher feel that she had received a very real and pleasing compliment. She\r\nsmiled appreciatively at him and dropped obligingly behind on the\r\nmoonlit road.\r\n\r\nSo Janet had a beau! Anne was delighted. Janet would make a paragon of\r\na wife—cheery, economical, tolerant, and a very queen of cooks. It\r\nwould be a flagrant waste on Nature’s part to keep her a permanent old\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\n“John Douglas asked me to take you up to see his mother,” said Janet\r\nthe next day. “She’s bed-rid a lot of the time and never goes out of\r\nthe house. But she’s powerful fond of company and always wants to see\r\nmy boarders. Can you go up this evening?”\r\n\r\nAnne assented; but later in the day Mr. Douglas called on his mother’s\r\nbehalf to invite them up to tea on Saturday evening.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why didn’t you put on your pretty pansy dress?” asked Anne, when\r\nthey left home. It was a hot day, and poor Janet, between her\r\nexcitement and her heavy black cashmere dress, looked as if she were\r\nbeing broiled alive.\r\n\r\n“Old Mrs. Douglas would think it terrible frivolous and unsuitable, I’m\r\nafraid. John likes that dress, though,” she added wistfully.\r\n\r\nThe old Douglas homestead was half a mile from “Wayside” cresting a\r\nwindy hill. The house itself was large and comfortable, old enough to\r\nbe dignified, and girdled with maple groves and orchards. There were\r\nbig, trim barns behind it, and everything bespoke prosperity. Whatever\r\nthe patient endurance in Mr. Douglas’ face had meant it hadn’t, so Anne\r\nreflected, meant debts and duns.\r\n\r\nJohn Douglas met them at the door and took them into the sitting-room,\r\nwhere his mother was enthroned in an armchair.\r\n\r\nAnne had expected old Mrs. Douglas to be tall and thin, because Mr.\r\nDouglas was. Instead, she was a tiny scrap of a woman, with soft pink\r\ncheeks, mild blue eyes, and a mouth like a baby’s. Dressed in a\r\nbeautiful, fashionably-made black silk dress, with a fluffy white shawl\r\nover her shoulders, and her snowy hair surmounted by a dainty lace cap,\r\nshe might have posed as a grandmother doll.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Janet dear?” she said sweetly. “I am so glad to see you\r\nagain, dear.” She put up her pretty old face to be kissed. “And this is\r\nour new teacher. I’m delighted to meet you. My son has been singing\r\nyour praises until I’m half jealous, and I’m sure Janet ought to be\r\nwholly so.”\r\n\r\nPoor Janet blushed, Anne said something polite and conventional, and\r\nthen everybody sat down and made talk. It was hard work, even for Anne,\r\nfor nobody seemed at ease except old Mrs. Douglas, who certainly did\r\nnot find any difficulty in talking. She made Janet sit by her and\r\nstroked her hand occasionally. Janet sat and smiled, looking horribly\r\nuncomfortable in her hideous dress, and John Douglas sat without\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nAt the tea table Mrs. Douglas gracefully asked Janet to pour the tea.\r\nJanet turned redder than ever but did it. Anne wrote a description of\r\nthat meal to Stella.\r\n\r\n“We had cold tongue and chicken and strawberry preserves, lemon pie and\r\ntarts and chocolate cake and raisin cookies and pound cake and fruit\r\ncake—and a few other things, including more pie—caramel pie, I think it\r\nwas. After I had eaten twice as much as was good for me, Mrs. Douglas\r\nsighed and said she feared she had nothing to tempt my appetite.\r\n\r\n“‘I’m afraid dear Janet’s cooking has spoiled you for any other,’ she\r\nsaid sweetly. ‘Of course nobody in Valley Road aspires to rival _her_.\r\n_Won’t_ you have another piece of pie, Miss Shirley? You haven’t eaten\r\n_anything_.’\r\n\r\n“Stella, I had eaten a helping of tongue and one of chicken, three\r\nbiscuits, a generous allowance of preserves, a piece of pie, a tart,\r\nand a square of chocolate cake!”\r\n\r\nAfter tea Mrs. Douglas smiled benevolently and told John to take “dear\r\nJanet” out into the garden and get her some roses. “Miss Shirley will\r\nkeep me company while you are out—won’t you?” she said plaintively. She\r\nsettled down in her armchair with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“I am a very frail old woman, Miss Shirley. For over twenty years I’ve\r\nbeen a great sufferer. For twenty long, weary years I’ve been dying by\r\ninches.”\r\n\r\n“How painful!” said Anne, trying to be sympathetic and succeeding only\r\nin feeling idiotic.\r\n\r\n“There have been scores of nights when they’ve thought I could never\r\nlive to see the dawn,” went on Mrs. Douglas solemnly. “Nobody knows\r\nwhat I’ve gone through—nobody can know but myself. Well, it can’t last\r\nvery much longer now. My weary pilgrimage will soon be over, Miss\r\nShirley. It is a great comfort to me that John will have such a good\r\nwife to look after him when his mother is gone—a great comfort, Miss\r\nShirley.”\r\n\r\n“Janet is a lovely woman,” said Anne warmly.\r\n\r\n“Lovely! A beautiful character,” assented Mrs. Douglas. “And a perfect\r\nhousekeeper—something I never was. My health would not permit it, Miss\r\nShirley. I am indeed thankful that John has made such a wise choice. I\r\nhope and believe that he will be happy. He is my only son, Miss\r\nShirley, and his happiness lies very near my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Anne stupidly. For the first time in her life she was\r\nstupid. Yet she could not imagine why. She seemed to have absolutely\r\nnothing to say to this sweet, smiling, angelic old lady who was patting\r\nher hand so kindly.\r\n\r\n“Come and see me soon again, dear Janet,” said Mrs. Douglas lovingly,\r\nwhen they left. “You don’t come half often enough. But then I suppose\r\nJohn will be bringing you here to stay all the time one of these days.”\r\nAnne, happening to glance at John Douglas, as his mother spoke, gave a\r\npositive start of dismay. He looked as a tortured man might look when\r\nhis tormentors gave the rack the last turn of possible endurance. She\r\nfelt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blushing Janet away.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t old Mrs. Douglas a sweet woman?” asked Janet, as they went down\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n“M—m,” answered Anne absently. She was wondering why John Douglas had\r\nlooked so.\r\n\r\n“She’s been a terrible sufferer,” said Janet feelingly. “She takes\r\nterrible spells. It keeps John all worried up. He’s scared to leave\r\nhome for fear his mother will take a spell and nobody there but the\r\nhired girl.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII\r\n“He Just Kept Coming and Coming”\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later Anne came home from school and found Janet crying.\r\nTears and Janet seemed so incongruous that Anne was honestly alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what is the matter?” she cried anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I’m—I’m forty today,” sobbed Janet.\r\n\r\n“Well, you were nearly that yesterday and it didn’t hurt,” comforted\r\nAnne, trying not to smile.\r\n\r\n“But—but,” went on Janet with a big gulp, “John Douglas won’t ask me to\r\nmarry him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but he will,” said Anne lamely. “You must give him time, Janet\r\n\r\n“Time!” said Janet with indescribable scorn. “He has had twenty years.\r\nHow much time does he want?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that John Douglas has been coming to see you for twenty\r\nyears?”\r\n\r\n“He has. And he has never so much as mentioned marriage to me. And I\r\ndon’t believe he ever will now. I’ve never said a word to a mortal\r\nabout it, but it seems to me I’ve just got to talk it out with some one\r\nat last or go crazy. John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago,\r\nbefore mother died. Well, he kept coming and coming, and after a spell\r\nI begun making quilts and things; but he never said anything about\r\ngetting married, only just kept coming and coming. There wasn’t\r\nanything I could do. Mother died when we’d been going together for\r\neight years. I thought he maybe would speak out then, seeing as I was\r\nleft alone in the world. He was real kind and feeling, and did\r\neverything he could for me, but he never said marry. And that’s the way\r\nit has been going on ever since. People blame _me_ for it. They say I\r\nwon’t marry him because his mother is so sickly and I don’t want the\r\nbother of waiting on her. Why, I’d _love_ to wait on John’s mother! But\r\nI let them think so. I’d rather they’d blame me than pity me! It’s so\r\ndreadful humiliating that John won’t ask me. And _why_ won’t he? Seems\r\nto me if I only knew his reason I wouldn’t mind it so much.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps his mother doesn’t want him to marry anybody,” suggested Anne.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she does. She’s told me time and again that she’d love to see John\r\nsettled before her time comes. She’s always giving him hints—you heard\r\nher yourself the other day. I thought I’d ha’ gone through the floor.”\r\n\r\n“It’s beyond me,” said Anne helplessly. She thought of Ludovic Speed.\r\nBut the cases were not parallel. John Douglas was not a man of\r\nLudovic’s type.\r\n\r\n“You should show more spirit, Janet,” she went on resolutely. “Why\r\ndidn’t you send him about his business long ago?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t,” said poor Janet pathetically. “You see, Anne, I’ve always\r\nbeen awful fond of John. He might just as well keep coming as not, for\r\nthere was never anybody else I’d want, so it didn’t matter.”\r\n\r\n“But it might have made him speak out like a man,” urged Anne.\r\n\r\nJanet shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, I guess not. I was afraid to try, anyway, for fear he’d think I\r\nmeant it and just go. I suppose I’m a poor-spirited creature, but that\r\nis how I feel. And I can’t help it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you _could_ help it, Janet. It isn’t too late yet. Take a firm\r\nstand. Let that man know you are not going to endure his\r\nshillyshallying any longer. _I’ll_ back you up.”\r\n\r\n“I dunno,” said Janet hopelessly. “I dunno if I could ever get up\r\nenough spunk. Things have drifted so long. But I’ll think it over.”\r\n\r\nAnne felt that she was disappointed in John Douglas. She had liked him\r\nso well, and she had not thought him the sort of man who would play\r\nfast and loose with a woman’s feelings for twenty years. He certainly\r\nshould be taught a lesson, and Anne felt vindictively that she would\r\nenjoy seeing the process. Therefore she was delighted when Janet told\r\nher, as they were going to prayer-meeting the next night, that she\r\nmeant to show some “sperrit.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll let John Douglas see I’m not going to be trodden on any longer.”\r\n\r\n“You are perfectly right,” said Anne emphatically.\r\n\r\nWhen prayer-meeting was over John Douglas came up with his usual\r\nrequest. Janet looked frightened but resolute.\r\n\r\n“No, thank you,” she said icily. “I know the road home pretty well\r\nalone. I ought to, seeing I’ve been traveling it for forty years. So\r\nyou needn’t trouble yourself, _Mr_. Douglas.”\r\n\r\nAnne was looking at John Douglas; and, in that brilliant moonlight, she\r\nsaw the last twist of the rack again. Without a word he turned and\r\nstrode down the road.\r\n\r\n“Stop! Stop!” Anne called wildly after him, not caring in the least for\r\nthe other dumbfounded onlookers. “Mr. Douglas, stop! Come back.”\r\n\r\nJohn Douglas stopped but he did not come back. Anne flew down the road,\r\ncaught his arm and fairly dragged him back to Janet.\r\n\r\n“You must come back,” she said imploringly. “It’s all a mistake, Mr.\r\nDouglas—all my fault. I made Janet do it. She didn’t want to—but it’s\r\nall right now, isn’t it, Janet?”\r\n\r\nWithout a word Janet took his arm and walked away. Anne followed them\r\nmeekly home and slipped in by the back door.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are a nice person to back me up,” said Janet sarcastically.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help it, Janet,” said Anne repentantly. “I just felt as if\r\nI had stood by and seen murder done. I _had_ to run after him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m just as glad you did. When I saw John Douglas making off down\r\nthat road I just felt as if every little bit of joy and happiness that\r\nwas left in my life was going with him. It was an awful feeling.”\r\n\r\n“Did he ask you why you did it?” asked Anne.\r\n\r\n“No, he never said a word about it,” replied Janet dully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV\r\nJohn Douglas Speaks at Last\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne was not without a feeble hope that something might come of it\r\nafter all. But nothing did. John Douglas came and took Janet driving,\r\nand walked home from prayer-meeting with her, as he had been doing for\r\ntwenty years, and as he seemed likely to do for twenty years more. The\r\nsummer waned. Anne taught her school and wrote letters and studied a\r\nlittle. Her walks to and from school were pleasant. She always went by\r\nway of the swamp; it was a lovely place—a boggy soil, green with the\r\ngreenest of mossy hillocks; a silvery brook meandered through it and\r\nspruces stood erectly, their boughs a-trail with gray-green mosses,\r\ntheir roots overgrown with all sorts of woodland lovelinesses.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Anne found life in Valley Road a little monotonous. To be\r\nsure, there was one diverting incident.\r\n\r\nShe had not seen the lank, tow-headed Samuel of the peppermints since\r\nthe evening of his call, save for chance meetings on the road. But one\r\nwarm August night he appeared, and solemnly seated himself on the\r\nrustic bench by the porch. He wore his usual working habiliments,\r\nconsisting of varipatched trousers, a blue jean shirt, out at the\r\nelbows, and a ragged straw hat. He was chewing a straw and he kept on\r\nchewing it while he looked solemnly at Anne. Anne laid her book aside\r\nwith a sigh and took up her doily. Conversation with Sam was really out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nAfter a long silence Sam suddenly spoke.\r\n\r\n“I’m leaving over there,” he said abruptly, waving his straw in the\r\ndirection of the neighboring house.\r\n\r\n“Oh, are you?” said Anne politely.\r\n\r\n“Yep.”\r\n\r\n“And where are you going now?”\r\n\r\n“Wall, I’ve been thinking some of gitting a place of my own. There’s\r\none that’d suit me over at Millersville. But ef I rents it I’ll want a\r\nwoman.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” said Anne vaguely.\r\n\r\n“Yep.”\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence. Finally Sam removed his straw again and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“Will yeh hev me?”\r\n\r\n“Wh—a—t!” gasped Anne.\r\n\r\n“Will yeh hev me?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean—MARRY you?” queried poor Anne feebly.\r\n\r\n“Yep.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’m hardly acquainted with you,” cried Anne indignantly.\r\n\r\n“But yeh’d git acquainted with me after we was married,” said Sam.\r\n\r\nAnne gathered up her poor dignity.\r\n\r\n“Certainly I won’t marry you,” she said haughtily.\r\n\r\n“Wall, yeh might do worse,” expostulated Sam. “I’m a good worker and\r\nI’ve got some money in the bank.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t speak of this to me again. Whatever put such an idea into your\r\nhead?” said Anne, her sense of humor getting the better of her wrath.\r\nIt was such an absurd situation.\r\n\r\n“Yeh’re a likely-looking girl and hev a right-smart way o’ stepping,”\r\nsaid Sam. “I don’t want no lazy woman. Think it over. I won’t change my\r\nmind yit awhile. Wall, I must be gitting. Gotter milk the cows.”\r\n\r\nAnne’s illusions concerning proposals had suffered so much of late\r\nyears that there were few of them left. So she could laugh\r\nwholeheartedly over this one, not feeling any secret sting. She\r\nmimicked poor Sam to Janet that night, and both of them laughed\r\nimmoderately over his plunge into sentiment.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when Anne’s sojourn in Valley Road was drawing to a\r\nclose, Alec Ward came driving down to “Wayside” in hot haste for Janet.\r\n\r\n“They want you at the Douglas place quick,” he said. “I really believe\r\nold Mrs. Douglas is going to die at last, after pretending to do it for\r\ntwenty years.”\r\n\r\nJanet ran to get her hat. Anne asked if Mrs. Douglas was worse than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n“She’s not half as bad,” said Alec solemnly, “and that’s what makes me\r\nthink it’s serious. Other times she’d be screaming and throwing herself\r\nall over the place. This time she’s lying still and mum. When Mrs.\r\nDouglas is mum she is pretty sick, you bet.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t like old Mrs. Douglas?” said Anne curiously.\r\n\r\n“I like cats as _is_ cats. I don’t like cats as is women,” was Alec’s\r\ncryptic reply.\r\n\r\nJanet came home in the twilight.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Douglas is dead,” she said wearily. “She died soon after I got\r\nthere. She just spoke to me once—‘I suppose you’ll marry John now?’ she\r\nsaid. It cut me to the heart, Anne. To think John’s own mother thought\r\nI wouldn’t marry him because of her! I couldn’t say a word either—there\r\nwere other women there. I was thankful John had gone out.”\r\n\r\nJanet began to cry drearily. But Anne brewed her a hot drink of ginger\r\ntea to her comforting. To be sure, Anne discovered later on that she\r\nhad used white pepper instead of ginger; but Janet never knew the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nThe evening after the funeral Janet and Anne were sitting on the front\r\nporch steps at sunset. The wind had fallen asleep in the pinelands and\r\nlurid sheets of heat-lightning flickered across the northern skies.\r\nJanet wore her ugly black dress and looked her very worst, her eyes and\r\nnose red from crying. They talked little, for Janet seemed faintly to\r\nresent Anne’s efforts to cheer her up. She plainly preferred to be\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the gate-latch clicked and John Douglas strode into the\r\ngarden. He walked towards them straight over the geranium bed. Janet\r\nstood up. So did Anne. Anne was a tall girl and wore a white dress; but\r\nJohn Douglas did not see her.\r\n\r\n“Janet,” he said, “will you marry me?”\r\n\r\nThe words burst out as if they had been wanting to be said for twenty\r\nyears and _must_ be uttered now, before anything else.\r\n\r\nJanet’s face was so red from crying that it couldn’t turn any redder,\r\nso it turned a most unbecoming purple.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you ask me before?” she said slowly.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t. She made me promise not to—mother made me promise not to.\r\nNineteen years ago she took a terrible spell. We thought she couldn’t\r\nlive through it. She implored me to promise not to ask you to marry me\r\nwhile she was alive. I didn’t want to promise such a thing, even though\r\nwe all thought she couldn’t live very long—the doctor only gave her six\r\nmonths. But she begged it on her knees, sick and suffering. I had to\r\npromise.”\r\n\r\n“What had your mother against me?” cried Janet.\r\n\r\n“Nothing—nothing. She just didn’t want another woman—_any_ woman—there\r\nwhile she was living. She said if I didn’t promise she’d die right\r\nthere and I’d have killed her. So I promised. And she’s held me to that\r\npromise ever since, though I’ve gone on my knees to her in my turn to\r\nbeg her to let me off.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell me this?” asked Janet chokingly. “If I’d only\r\n_known!_ Why didn’t you just tell me?”\r\n\r\n“She made me promise I wouldn’t tell a soul,” said John hoarsely. “She\r\nswore me to it on the Bible; Janet, I’d never have done it if I’d\r\ndreamed it was to be for so long. Janet, you’ll never know what I’ve\r\nsuffered these nineteen years. I know I’ve made you suffer, too, but\r\nyou’ll marry me for all, won’t you, Janet? Oh, Janet, won’t you? I’ve\r\ncome as soon as I could to ask you.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the stupefied Anne came to her senses and realized that\r\nshe had no business to be there. She slipped away and did not see Janet\r\nuntil the next morning, when the latter told her the rest of the story.\r\n\r\n“That cruel, relentless, deceitful old woman!” cried Anne.\r\n\r\n“Hush—she’s dead,” said Janet solemnly. “If she wasn’t—but she _is_. So\r\nwe mustn’t speak evil of her. But I’m happy at last, Anne. And I\r\nwouldn’t have minded waiting so long a bit if I’d only known why.”\r\n\r\n“When are you to be married?”\r\n\r\n“Next month. Of course it will be very quiet. I suppose people will\r\ntalk terrible. They’ll say I made enough haste to snap John up as soon\r\nas his poor mother was out of the way. John wanted to let them know the\r\ntruth but I said, ‘No, John; after all she was your mother, and we’ll\r\nkeep the secret between us, and not cast any shadow on her memory. I\r\ndon’t mind what people say, now that I know the truth myself. It don’t\r\nmatter a mite. Let it all be buried with the dead’ says I to him. So I\r\ncoaxed him round to agree with me.”\r\n\r\n“You’re much more forgiving than I could ever be,” Anne said, rather\r\ncrossly.\r\n\r\n“You’ll feel differently about a good many things when you get to be my\r\nage,” said Janet tolerantly. “That’s one of the things we learn as we\r\ngrow older—how to forgive. It comes easier at forty than it did at\r\ntwenty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV\r\nThe Last Redmond Year Opens\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here we are, all back again, nicely sunburned and rejoicing as a\r\nstrong man to run a race,” said Phil, sitting down on a suitcase with a\r\nsigh of pleasure. “Isn’t it jolly to see this dear old Patty’s Place\r\nagain—and Aunty—and the cats? Rusty has lost another piece of ear,\r\nhasn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“Rusty would be the nicest cat in the world if he had no ears at all,”\r\ndeclared Anne loyally from her trunk, while Rusty writhed about her lap\r\nin a frenzy of welcome.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you glad to see us back, Aunty?” demanded Phil.\r\n\r\n“Yes. But I wish you’d tidy things up,” said Aunt Jamesina plaintively,\r\nlooking at the wilderness of trunks and suitcases by which the four\r\nlaughing, chattering girls were surrounded. “You can talk just as well\r\nlater on. Work first and then play used to be my motto when I was a\r\ngirl.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’ve just reversed that in this generation, Aunty. _Our_ motto is\r\nplay your play and then dig in. You can do your work so much better if\r\nyou’ve had a good bout of play first.”\r\n\r\n“If you are going to marry a minister,” said Aunt Jamesina, picking up\r\nJoseph and her knitting and resigning herself to the inevitable with\r\nthe charming grace that made her the queen of housemothers, “you will\r\nhave to give up such expressions as ‘dig in.’”\r\n\r\n“Why?” moaned Phil. “Oh, why must a minister’s wife be supposed to\r\nutter only prunes and prisms? I shan’t. Everybody on Patterson Street\r\nuses slang—that is to say, metaphorical language—and if I didn’t they\r\nwould think me insufferably proud and stuck up.”\r\n\r\n“Have you broken the news to your family?” asked Priscilla, feeding the\r\nSarah-cat bits from her lunchbasket.\r\n\r\nPhil nodded.\r\n\r\n“How did they take it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, mother rampaged. But I stood rockfirm—even I, Philippa Gordon, who\r\nnever before could hold fast to anything. Father was calmer. Father’s\r\nown daddy was a minister, so you see he has a soft spot in his heart\r\nfor the cloth. I had Jo up to Mount Holly, after mother grew calm, and\r\nthey both loved him. But mother gave him some frightful hints in every\r\nconversation regarding what she had hoped for me. Oh, my vacation\r\npathway hasn’t been exactly strewn with roses, girls dear. But—I’ve won\r\nout and I’ve got Jo. Nothing else matters.”\r\n\r\n“To you,” said Aunt Jamesina darkly.\r\n\r\n“Nor to Jo, either,” retorted Phil. “You keep on pitying him. Why,\r\npray? I think he’s to be envied. He’s getting brains, beauty, and a\r\nheart of gold in _me_.”\r\n\r\n“It’s well we know how to take your speeches,” said Aunt Jamesina\r\npatiently. “I hope you don’t talk like that before strangers. What\r\nwould they think?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t want to know what they think. I don’t want to see myself\r\nas others see me. I’m sure it would be horribly uncomfortable most of\r\nthe time. I don’t believe Burns was really sincere in that prayer,\r\neither.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I daresay we all pray for some things that we really don’t want,\r\nif we were only honest enough to look into our hearts,” owned Aunt\r\nJamesina candidly. “I’ve a notion that such prayers don’t rise very\r\nfar. _I_ used to pray that I might be enabled to forgive a certain\r\nperson, but I know now I really didn’t want to forgive her. When I\r\nfinally got that I _did_ want to I forgave her without having to pray\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t picture you as being unforgiving for long,” said Stella.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I used to be. But holding spite doesn’t seem worth while when you\r\nget along in years.”\r\n\r\n“That reminds me,” said Anne, and told the tale of John and Janet.\r\n\r\n“And now tell us about that romantic scene you hinted so darkly at in\r\none of your letters,” demanded Phil.\r\n\r\nAnne acted out Samuel’s proposal with great spirit. The girls shrieked\r\nwith laughter and Aunt Jamesina smiled.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t in good taste to make fun of your beaux,” she said severely;\r\n“but,” she added calmly, “I always did it myself.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us about your beaux, Aunty,” entreated Phil. “You must have had\r\nany number of them.”\r\n\r\n“They’re not in the past tense,” retorted Aunt Jamesina. “I’ve got them\r\nyet. There are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheep’s\r\neyes at me for some time. You children needn’t think you own all the\r\nromance in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Widowers and sheep’s eyes don’t sound very romantic, Aunty.”\r\n\r\n“Well, no; but young folks aren’t always romantic either. Some of my\r\nbeaux certainly weren’t. I used to laugh at them scandalous, poor boys.\r\nThere was Jim Elwood—he was always in a sort of day-dream—never seemed\r\nto sense what was going on. He didn’t wake up to the fact that I’d said\r\n‘no’ till a year after I’d said it. When he did get married his wife\r\nfell out of the sleigh one night when they were driving home from\r\nchurch and he never missed her. Then there was Dan Winston. He knew too\r\nmuch. He knew everything in this world and most of what is in the next.\r\nHe could give you an answer to any question, even if you asked him when\r\nthe Judgment Day was to be. Milton Edwards was real nice and I liked\r\nhim but I didn’t marry him. For one thing, he took a week to get a joke\r\nthrough his head, and for another he never asked me. Horatio Reeve was\r\nthe most interesting beau I ever had. But when he told a story he\r\ndressed it up so that you couldn’t see it for frills. I never could\r\ndecide whether he was lying or just letting his imagination run loose.”\r\n\r\n“And what about the others, Aunty?”\r\n\r\n“Go away and unpack,” said Aunt Jamesina, waving Joseph at them by\r\nmistake for a needle. “The others were too nice to make fun of. I shall\r\nrespect their memory. There’s a box of flowers in your room, Anne. They\r\ncame about an hour ago.”\r\n\r\nAfter the first week the girls of Patty’s Place settled down to a\r\nsteady grind of study; for this was their last year at Redmond and\r\ngraduation honors must be fought for persistently. Anne devoted herself\r\nto English, Priscilla pored over classics, and Philippa pounded away at\r\nMathematics. Sometimes they grew tired, sometimes they felt\r\ndiscouraged, sometimes nothing seemed worth the struggle for it. In one\r\nsuch mood Stella wandered up to the blue room one rainy November\r\nevening. Anne sat on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the\r\nlamp beside her, amid a surrounding snow of crumpled manuscript.\r\n\r\n“What in the world are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“Just looking over some old Story Club yarns. I wanted something to\r\ncheer _and_ inebriate. I’d studied until the world seemed azure. So I\r\ncame up here and dug these out of my trunk. They are so drenched in\r\ntears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny.”\r\n\r\n“I’m blue and discouraged myself,” said Stella, throwing herself on the\r\ncouch. “Nothing seems worthwhile. My very thoughts are old. I’ve\r\nthought them all before. What is the use of living after all, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“Honey, it’s just brain fag that makes us feel that way, and the\r\nweather. A pouring rainy night like this, coming after a hard day’s\r\ngrind, would squelch any one but a Mark Tapley. You know it _is_\r\nworthwhile to live.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I suppose so. But I can’t prove it to myself just now.”\r\n\r\n“Just think of all the great and noble souls who have lived and worked\r\nin the world,” said Anne dreamily. “Isn’t it worthwhile to come after\r\nthem and inherit what they won and taught? Isn’t it worthwhile to think\r\nwe can share their inspiration? And then, all the great souls that will\r\ncome in the future? Isn’t it worthwhile to work a little and prepare\r\nthe way for them—make just one step in their path easier?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my mind agrees with you, Anne. But my soul remains doleful and\r\nuninspired. I’m always grubby and dingy on rainy nights.”\r\n\r\n“Some nights I like the rain—I like to lie in bed and hear it pattering\r\non the roof and drifting through the pines.”\r\n\r\n“I like it when it stays on the roof,” said Stella. “It doesn’t always.\r\nI spent a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer. The\r\nroof leaked and the rain came pattering down on my bed. There was no\r\npoetry in _that_. I had to get up in the ‘mirk midnight’ and chivy\r\nround to pull the bedstead out of the drip—and it was one of those\r\nsolid, old-fashioned beds that weigh a ton—more or less. And then that\r\ndrip-drop, drip-drop kept up all night until my nerves just went to\r\npieces. You’ve no idea what an eerie noise a great drop of rain falling\r\nwith a mushy thud on a bare floor makes in the night. It sounds like\r\nghostly footsteps and all that sort of thing. What are you laughing\r\nover, Anne?”\r\n\r\n“These stories. As Phil would say they are killing—in more senses than\r\none, for everybody died in them. What dazzlingly lovely heroines we\r\nhad—and how we dressed them!\r\n\r\n“Silks—satins—velvets—jewels—laces—they never wore anything else. Here\r\nis one of Jane Andrews’ stories depicting her heroine as sleeping in a\r\nbeautiful white satin nightdress trimmed with seed pearls.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Stella. “I begin to feel that life is worth living as\r\nlong as there’s a laugh in it.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s one I wrote. My heroine is disporting herself at a ball\r\n‘glittering from head to foot with large diamonds of the first water.’\r\nBut what booted beauty or rich attire? ‘The paths of glory lead but to\r\nthe grave.’ They must either be murdered or die of a broken heart.\r\nThere was no escape for them.”\r\n\r\n“Let me read some of your stories.”\r\n\r\n“Well, here’s my masterpiece. Note its cheerful title—‘My Graves.’ I\r\nshed quarts of tears while writing it, and the other girls shed gallons\r\nwhile I read it. Jane Andrews’ mother scolded her frightfully because\r\nshe had so many handkerchiefs in the wash that week. It’s a harrowing\r\ntale of the wanderings of a Methodist minister’s wife. I made her a\r\nMethodist because it was necessary that she should wander. She buried a\r\nchild every place she lived in. There were nine of them and their\r\ngraves were severed far apart, ranging from Newfoundland to Vancouver.\r\nI described the children, pictured their several death beds, and\r\ndetailed their tombstones and epitaphs. I had intended to bury the\r\nwhole nine but when I had disposed of eight my invention of horrors\r\ngave out and I permitted the ninth to live as a hopeless cripple.”\r\n\r\nWhile Stella read My Graves, punctuating its tragic paragraphs with\r\nchuckles, and Rusty slept the sleep of a just cat who has been out all\r\nnight curled up on a Jane Andrews tale of a beautiful maiden of fifteen\r\nwho went to nurse in a leper colony—of course dying of the loathsome\r\ndisease finally—Anne glanced over the other manuscripts and recalled\r\nthe old days at Avonlea school when the members of the Story Club,\r\nsitting under the spruce trees or down among the ferns by the brook,\r\nhad written them. What fun they had had! How the sunshine and mirth of\r\nthose olden summers returned as she read. Not all the glory that was\r\nGreece or the grandeur that was Rome could weave such wizardry as those\r\nfunny, tearful tales of the Story Club. Among the manuscripts Anne\r\nfound one written on sheets of wrapping paper. A wave of laughter\r\nfilled her gray eyes as she recalled the time and place of its genesis.\r\nIt was the sketch she had written the day she fell through the roof of\r\nthe Cobb duckhouse on the Tory Road.\r\n\r\nAnne glanced over it, then fell to reading it intently. It was a little\r\ndialogue between asters and sweet-peas, wild canaries in the lilac\r\nbush, and the guardian spirit of the garden. After she had read it, she\r\nsat, staring into space; and when Stella had gone she smoothed out the\r\ncrumpled manuscript.\r\n\r\n“I believe I will,” she said resolutely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI\r\nThe Gardners’Call\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here is a letter with an Indian stamp for you, Aunt Jimsie,” said\r\nPhil. “Here are three for Stella, and two for Pris, and a glorious fat\r\none for me from Jo. There’s nothing for you, Anne, except a circular.”\r\n\r\nNobody noticed Anne’s flush as she took the thin letter Phil tossed her\r\ncarelessly. But a few minutes later Phil looked up to see a\r\ntransfigured Anne.\r\n\r\n“Honey, what good thing has happened?”\r\n\r\n“The Youth’s Friend has accepted a little sketch I sent them a\r\nfortnight ago,” said Anne, trying hard to speak as if she were\r\naccustomed to having sketches accepted every mail, but not quite\r\nsucceeding.\r\n\r\n“Anne Shirley! How glorious! What was it? When is it to be published?\r\nDid they pay you for it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; they’ve sent a check for ten dollars, and the editor writes that\r\nhe would like to see more of my work. Dear man, he shall. It was an old\r\nsketch I found in my box. I re-wrote it and sent it in—but I never\r\nreally thought it could be accepted because it had no plot,” said Anne,\r\nrecalling the bitter experience of Averil’s Atonement.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with that ten dollars, Anne? Let’s all go up\r\ntown and get drunk,” suggested Phil.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ going to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort,”\r\ndeclared Anne gaily. “At all events it isn’t tainted money—like the\r\ncheck I got for that horrible Reliable Baking Powder story. I spent\r\n_it_ usefully for clothes and hated them every time I put them on.”\r\n\r\n“Think of having a real live author at Patty’s Place,” said Priscilla.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great responsibility,” said Aunt Jamesina solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Indeed it is,” agreed Pris with equal solemnity. “Authors are kittle\r\ncattle. You never know when or how they will break out. Anne may make\r\ncopy of us.”\r\n\r\n“I meant that the ability to write for the Press was a great\r\nresponsibility,” said Aunt Jamesina severely, “and I hope Anne\r\nrealizes, it. My daughter used to write stories before she went to the\r\nforeign field, but now she has turned her attention to higher things.\r\nShe used to say her motto was ‘Never write a line you would be ashamed\r\nto read at your own funeral.’ You’d better take that for yours, Anne,\r\nif you are going to embark in literature. Though, to be sure,” added\r\nAunt Jamesina perplexedly, “Elizabeth always used to laugh when she\r\nsaid it. She always laughed so much that I don’t know how she ever came\r\nto decide on being a missionary. I’m thankful she did—I prayed that she\r\nmight—but—I wish she hadn’t.”\r\n\r\nThen Aunt Jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed.\r\n\r\nAnne’s eyes shone all that day; literary ambitions sprouted and budded\r\nin her brain; their exhilaration accompanied her to Jennie Cooper’s\r\nwalking party, and not even the sight of Gilbert and Christine, walking\r\njust ahead of her and Roy, could quite subdue the sparkle of her starry\r\nhopes. Nevertheless, she was not so rapt from things of earth as to be\r\nunable to notice that Christine’s walk was decidedly ungraceful.\r\n\r\n“But I suppose Gilbert looks only at her face. So like a man,” thought\r\nAnne scornfully.\r\n\r\n“Shall you be home Saturday afternoon?” asked Roy.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“My mother and sisters are coming to call on you,” said Roy quietly.\r\n\r\nSomething went over Anne which might be described as a thrill, but it\r\nwas hardly a pleasant one. She had never met any of Roy’s family; she\r\nrealized the significance of his statement; and it had, somehow, an\r\nirrevocableness about it that chilled her.\r\n\r\n“I shall be glad to see them,” she said flatly; and then wondered if\r\nshe really would be glad. She ought to be, of course. But would it not\r\nbe something of an ordeal? Gossip had filtered to Anne regarding the\r\nlight in which the Gardners viewed the “infatuation” of son and\r\nbrother. Roy must have brought pressure to bear in the matter of this\r\ncall. Anne knew she would be weighed in the balance. From the fact that\r\nthey had consented to call she understood that, willingly or\r\nunwillingly, they regarded her as a possible member of their clan.\r\n\r\n“I shall just be myself. I shall not _try_ to make a good impression,”\r\nthought Anne loftily. But she was wondering what dress she would better\r\nwear Saturday afternoon, and if the new style of high hair-dressing\r\nwould suit her better than the old; and the walking party was rather\r\nspoiled for her. By night she had decided that she would wear her brown\r\nchiffon on Saturday, but would do her hair low.\r\n\r\nFriday afternoon none of the girls had classes at Redmond. Stella took\r\nthe opportunity to write a paper for the Philomathic Society, and was\r\nsitting at the table in the corner of the living-room with an untidy\r\nlitter of notes and manuscript on the floor around her. Stella always\r\nvowed she never could write anything unless she threw each sheet down\r\nas she completed it. Anne, in her flannel blouse and serge skirt, with\r\nher hair rather blown from her windy walk home, was sitting squarely in\r\nthe middle of the floor, teasing the Sarah-cat with a wishbone. Joseph\r\nand Rusty were both curled up in her lap. A warm plummy odor filled the\r\nwhole house, for Priscilla was cooking in the kitchen. Presently she\r\ncame in, enshrouded in a huge work-apron, with a smudge of flour on her\r\nnose, to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced.\r\n\r\nAt this auspicious moment the knocker sounded. Nobody paid any\r\nattention to it save Phil, who sprang up and opened it, expecting a boy\r\nwith the hat she had bought that morning. On the doorstep stood Mrs.\r\nGardner and her daughters.\r\n\r\nAnne scrambled to her feet somehow, emptying two indignant cats out of\r\nher lap as she did so, and mechanically shifting her wishbone from her\r\nright hand to her left. Priscilla, who would have had to cross the room\r\nto reach the kitchen door, lost her head, wildly plunged the chocolate\r\ncake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa, and dashed upstairs. Stella\r\nbegan feverishly gathering up her manuscript. Only Aunt Jamesina and\r\nPhil remained normal. Thanks to them, everybody was soon sitting at\r\nease, even Anne. Priscilla came down, apronless and smudgeless, Stella\r\nreduced her corner to decency, and Phil saved the situation by a stream\r\nof ready small talk.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gardner was tall and thin and handsome, exquisitely gowned,\r\ncordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced. Aline Gardner\r\nwas a younger edition of her mother, lacking the cordiality. She\r\nendeavored to be nice, but succeeded only in being haughty and\r\npatronizing. Dorothy Gardner was slim and jolly and rather tomboyish.\r\nAnne knew she was Roy’s favorite sister and warmed to her. She would\r\nhave looked very much like Roy if she had had dreamy dark eyes instead\r\nof roguish hazel ones. Thanks to her and Phil, the call really went off\r\nvery well, except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere and\r\ntwo rather untoward incidents. Rusty and Joseph, left to themselves,\r\nbegan a game of chase, and sprang madly into Mrs. Gardner’s silken lap\r\nand out of it in their wild career. Mrs. Gardner lifted her lorgnette\r\nand gazed after their flying forms as if she had never seen cats\r\nbefore, and Anne, choking back slightly nervous laughter, apologized as\r\nbest she could.\r\n\r\n“You are fond of cats?” said Mrs. Gardner, with a slight intonation of\r\ntolerant wonder.\r\n\r\nAnne, despite her affection for Rusty, was not especially fond of cats,\r\nbut Mrs. Gardner’s tone annoyed her. Inconsequently she remembered that\r\nMrs. John Blythe was so fond of cats that she kept as many as her\r\nhusband would allow.\r\n\r\n“They _are_ adorable animals, aren’t they?” she said wickedly.\r\n\r\n“I have never liked cats,” said Mrs. Gardner remotely.\r\n\r\n“I love them,” said Dorothy. “They are so nice and selfish. Dogs are\r\n_too_ good and unselfish. They make me feel uncomfortable. But cats are\r\ngloriously human.”\r\n\r\n“You have two delightful old china dogs there. May I look at them\r\nclosely?” said Aline, crossing the room towards the fireplace and\r\nthereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident. Picking\r\nup Magog, she sat down on the cushion under which was secreted\r\nPriscilla’s chocolate cake. Priscilla and Anne exchanged agonized\r\nglances but could do nothing. The stately Aline continued to sit on the\r\ncushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure.\r\n\r\nDorothy lingered behind a moment to squeeze Anne’s hand and whisper\r\nimpulsively.\r\n\r\n“I _know_ you and I are going to be chums. Oh, Roy has told me all\r\nabout you. I’m the only one of the family he tells things to, poor\r\nboy—nobody _could_ confide in mamma and Aline, you know. What glorious\r\ntimes you girls must have here! Won’t you let me come often and have a\r\nshare in them?”\r\n\r\n“Come as often as you like,” Anne responded heartily, thankful that one\r\nof Roy’s sisters was likable. She would never like Aline, so much was\r\ncertain; and Aline would never like her, though Mrs. Gardner might be\r\nwon. Altogether, Anne sighed with relief when the ordeal was over.\r\n\r\n“‘Of all sad words of tongue or pen\r\nThe saddest are it might have been,’”\r\n\r\n\r\nquoted Priscilla tragically, lifting the cushion. “This cake is now\r\nwhat you might call a flat failure. And the cushion is likewise ruined.\r\nNever tell me that Friday isn’t unlucky.”\r\n\r\n“People who send word they are coming on Saturday shouldn’t come on\r\nFriday,” said Aunt Jamesina.\r\n\r\n“I fancy it was Roy’s mistake,” said Phil. “That boy isn’t really\r\nresponsible for what he says when he talks to Anne. Where _is_ Anne?”\r\n\r\nAnne had gone upstairs. She felt oddly like crying. But she made\r\nherself laugh instead. Rusty and Joseph had been _too_ awful! And\r\nDorothy _was_ a dear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII\r\nFull-fledged B.A.’s\r\n\r\n\r\n“I wish I were dead, or that it were tomorrow night,” groaned Phil.\r\n\r\n“If you live long enough both wishes will come true,” said Anne calmly.\r\n\r\n“It’s easy for you to be serene. You’re at home in Philosophy. I’m\r\nnot—and when I think of that horrible paper tomorrow I quail. If I\r\nshould fail in it what would Jo say?”\r\n\r\n“You won’t fail. How did you get on in Greek today?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Perhaps it was a good paper and perhaps it was bad\r\nenough to make Homer turn over in his grave. I’ve studied and mulled\r\nover notebooks until I’m incapable of forming an opinion of anything.\r\nHow thankful little Phil will be when all this examinating is over.”\r\n\r\n“Examinating? I never heard such a word.”\r\n\r\n“Well, haven’t I as good a right to make a word as any one else?”\r\ndemanded Phil.\r\n\r\n“Words aren’t made—they grow,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“Never mind—I begin faintly to discern clear water ahead where no\r\nexamination breakers loom. Girls, do you—can you realize that our\r\nRedmond Life is almost over?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” said Anne, sorrowfully. “It seems just yesterday that Pris\r\nand I were alone in that crowd of Freshmen at Redmond. And now we are\r\nSeniors in our final examinations.”\r\n\r\n“‘Potent, wise, and reverend Seniors,’” quoted Phil. “Do you suppose we\r\nreally are any wiser than when we came to Redmond?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t act as if you were by times,” said Aunt Jamesina severely.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Aunt Jimsie, haven’t we been pretty good girls, take us by and\r\nlarge, these three winters you’ve mothered us?” pleaded Phil.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been four of the dearest, sweetest, goodest girls that ever\r\nwent together through college,” averred Aunt Jamesina, who never\r\nspoiled a compliment by misplaced economy.\r\n\r\n“But I mistrust you haven’t any too much sense yet. It’s not to be\r\nexpected, of course. Experience teaches sense. You can’t learn it in a\r\ncollege course. You’ve been to college four years and I never was, but\r\nI know heaps more than you do, young ladies.”\r\n\r\n“‘There are lots of things that never go by rule,\r\nThere’s a powerful pile o’ knowledge\r\nThat you never get at college,\r\nThere are heaps of things you never learn at school,’”\r\n\r\n\r\nquoted Stella.\r\n\r\n“Have you learned anything at Redmond except dead languages and\r\ngeometry and such trash?” queried Aunt Jamesina.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. I think we have, Aunty,” protested Anne.\r\n\r\n“We’ve learned the truth of what Professor Woodleigh told us last\r\nPhilomathic,” said Phil. “He said, ‘Humor is the spiciest condiment in\r\nthe feast of existence. Laugh at your mistakes but learn from them,\r\njoke over your troubles but gather strength from them, make a jest of\r\nyour difficulties but overcome them.’ Isn’t that worth learning, Aunt\r\nJimsie?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is, dearie. When you’ve learned to laugh at the things that\r\nshould be laughed at, and not to laugh at those that shouldn’t, you’ve\r\ngot wisdom and understanding.”\r\n\r\n“What have you got out of your Redmond course, Anne?” murmured\r\nPriscilla aside.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Anne slowly, “that I really have learned to look upon\r\neach little hindrance as a jest and each great one as the foreshadowing\r\nof victory. Summing up, I think that is what Redmond has given me.”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to fall back on another Professor Woodleigh quotation to\r\nexpress what it has done for me,” said Priscilla. “You remember that he\r\nsaid in his address, ‘There is so much in the world for us all if we\r\nonly have the eyes to see it, and the heart to love it, and the hand to\r\ngather it to ourselves—so much in men and women, so much in art and\r\nliterature, so much everywhere in which to delight, and for which to be\r\nthankful.’ I think Redmond has taught me that in some measure, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Judging from what you all, say” remarked Aunt Jamesina, “the sum and\r\nsubstance is that you can learn—if you’ve got natural gumption\r\nenough—in four years at college what it would take about twenty years\r\nof living to teach you. Well, that justifies higher education in my\r\nopinion. It’s a matter I was always dubious about before.”\r\n\r\n“But what about people who haven’t natural gumption, Aunt Jimsie?”\r\n\r\n“People who haven’t natural gumption never learn,” retorted Aunt\r\nJamesina, “neither in college nor life. If they live to be a hundred\r\nthey really don’t know anything more than when they were born. It’s\r\ntheir misfortune not their fault, poor souls. But those of us who have\r\nsome gumption should duly thank the Lord for it.”\r\n\r\n“Will you please define what gumption is, Aunt Jimsie?” asked Phil.\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t, young woman. Any one who has gumption knows what it is,\r\nand any one who hasn’t can never know what it is. So there is no need\r\nof defining it.”\r\n\r\nThe busy days flew by and examinations were over. Anne took High Honors\r\nin English. Priscilla took Honors in Classics, and Phil in Mathematics.\r\nStella obtained a good all-round showing. Then came Convocation.\r\n\r\n“This is what I would once have called an epoch in my life,” said Anne,\r\nas she took Roy’s violets out of their box and gazed at them\r\nthoughtfully. She meant to carry them, of course, but her eyes wandered\r\nto another box on her table. It was filled with lilies-of-the-valley,\r\nas fresh and fragrant as those which bloomed in the Green Gables yard\r\nwhen June came to Avonlea. Gilbert Blythe’s card lay beside it.\r\n\r\nAnne wondered why Gilbert should have sent her flowers for Convocation.\r\nShe had seen very little of him during the past winter. He had come to\r\nPatty’s Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holidays, and\r\nthey rarely met elsewhere. She knew he was studying very hard, aiming\r\nat High Honors and the Cooper Prize, and he took little part in the\r\nsocial doings of Redmond. Anne’s own winter had been quite gay\r\nsocially. She had seen a good deal of the Gardners; she and Dorothy\r\nwere very intimate; college circles expected the announcement of her\r\nengagement to Roy any day. Anne expected it herself. Yet just before\r\nshe left Patty’s Place for Convocation she flung Roy’s violets aside\r\nand put Gilbert’s lilies-of-the-valley in their place. She could not\r\nhave told why she did it. Somehow, old Avonlea days and dreams and\r\nfriendships seemed very close to her in this attainment of her\r\nlong-cherished ambitions. She and Gilbert had once picturedout merrily\r\nthe day on which they should be capped and gowned graduates in Arts.\r\nThe wonderful day had come and Roy’s violets had no place in it. Only\r\nher old friend’s flowers seemed to belong to this fruition of\r\nold-blossoming hopes which he had once shared.\r\n\r\nFor years this day had beckoned and allured to her; but when it came\r\nthe one single, keen, abiding memory it left with her was not that of\r\nthe breathless moment when the stately president of Redmond gave her\r\ncap and diploma and hailed her B.A.; it was not of the flash in\r\nGilbert’s eyes when he saw her lilies, nor the puzzled pained glance\r\nRoy gave her as he passed her on the platform. It was not of Aline\r\nGardner’s condescending congratulations, or Dorothy’s ardent, impulsive\r\ngood wishes. It was of one strange, unaccountable pang that spoiled\r\nthis long-expected day for her and left in it a certain faint but\r\nenduring flavor of bitterness.\r\n\r\nThe Arts graduates gave a graduation dance that night. When Anne\r\ndressed for it she tossed aside the pearl beads she usually wore and\r\ntook from her trunk the small box that had come to Green Gables on\r\nChristmas day. In it was a thread-like gold chain with a tiny pink\r\nenamel heart as a pendant. On the accompanying card was written, “With\r\nall good wishes from your old chum, Gilbert.” Anne, laughing over the\r\nmemory the enamel heart conjured up the fatal day when Gilbert had\r\ncalled her “Carrots” and vainly tried to make his peace with a pink\r\ncandy heart, had written him a nice little note of thanks. But she had\r\nnever worn the trinket. Tonight she fastened it about her white throat\r\nwith a dreamy smile.\r\n\r\nShe and Phil walked to Redmond together. Anne walked in silence; Phil\r\nchattered of many things. Suddenly she said,\r\n\r\n“I heard today that Gilbert Blythe’s engagement to Christine Stuart was\r\nto be announced as soon as Convocation was over. Did you hear anything\r\nof it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s true,” said Phil lightly.\r\n\r\nAnne did not speak. In the darkness she felt her face burning. She\r\nslipped her hand inside her collar and caught at the gold chain. One\r\nenergetic twist and it gave way. Anne thrust the broken trinket into\r\nher pocket. Her hands were trembling and her eyes were smarting.\r\n\r\nBut she was the gayest of all the gay revellers that night, and told\r\nGilbert unregretfully that her card was full when he came to ask her\r\nfor a dance. Afterwards, when she sat with the girls before the dying\r\nembers at Patty’s Place, removing the spring chilliness from their\r\nsatin skins, none chatted more blithely than she of the day’s events.\r\n\r\n“Moody Spurgeon MacPherson called here tonight after you left,” said\r\nAunt Jamesina, who had sat up to keep the fire on. “He didn’t know\r\nabout the graduation dance. That boy ought to sleep with a rubber band\r\naround his head to train his ears not to stick out. I had a beau once\r\nwho did that and it improved him immensely. It was I who suggested it\r\nto him and he took my advice, but he never forgave me for it.”\r\n\r\n“Moody Spurgeon is a very serious young man,” yawned Priscilla. “He is\r\nconcerned with graver matters than his ears. He is going to be a\r\nminister, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose the Lord doesn’t regard the ears of a man,” said Aunt\r\nJamesina gravely, dropping all further criticism of Moody Spurgeon.\r\nAunt Jamesina had a proper respect for the cloth even in the case of an\r\nunfledged parson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII\r\nFalse Dawn\r\n\r\n\r\n“Just imagine—this night week I’ll be in Avonlea—delightful thought!”\r\nsaid Anne, bending over the box in which she was packing Mrs. Rachel\r\nLynde’s quilts. “But just imagine—this night week I’ll be gone forever\r\nfrom Patty’s Place—horrible thought!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if the ghost of all our laughter will echo through the maiden\r\ndreams of Miss Patty and Miss Maria,” speculated Phil.\r\n\r\nMiss Patty and Miss Maria were coming home, after having trotted over\r\nmost of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\n“We’ll be back the second week in May” wrote Miss Patty. “I expect\r\nPatty’s Place will seem rather small after the Hall of the Kings at\r\nKarnak, but I never did like big places to live in. And I’ll be glad\r\nenough to be home again. When you start traveling late in life you’re\r\napt to do too much of it because you know you haven’t much time left,\r\nand it’s a thing that grows on you. I’m afraid Maria will never be\r\ncontented again.”\r\n\r\n“I shall leave here my fancies and dreams to bless the next comer,”\r\nsaid Anne, looking around the blue room wistfully—her pretty blue room\r\nwhere she had spent three such happy years. She had knelt at its window\r\nto pray and had bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pines. She\r\nhad heard the autumn raindrops beating against it and had welcomed the\r\nspring robins at its sill. She wondered if old dreams could haunt\r\nrooms—if, when one left forever the room where she had joyed and\r\nsuffered and laughed and wept, something of her, intangible and\r\ninvisible, yet nonetheless real, did not remain behind like a voiceful\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Phil, “that a room where one dreams and grieves and\r\nrejoices and lives becomes inseparably connected with those processes\r\nand acquires a personality of its own. I am sure if I came into this\r\nroom fifty years from now it would say ‘Anne, Anne’ to me. What nice\r\ntimes we’ve had here, honey! What chats and jokes and good chummy\r\njamborees! Oh, dear me! I’m to marry Jo in June and I know I will be\r\nrapturously happy. But just now I feel as if I wanted this lovely\r\nRedmond life to go on forever.”\r\n\r\n“I’m unreasonable enough just now to wish that, too,” admitted Anne.\r\n“No matter what deeper joys may come to us later on we’ll never again\r\nhave just the same delightful, irresponsible existence we’ve had here.\r\nIt’s over forever, Phil.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with Rusty?” asked Phil, as that privileged\r\npussy padded into the room.\r\n\r\n“I am going to take him home with me and Joseph and the Sarah-cat,”\r\nannounced Aunt Jamesina, following Rusty. “It would be a shame to\r\nseparate those cats now that they have learned to live together. It’s a\r\nhard lesson for cats and humans to learn.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry to part with Rusty,” said Anne regretfully, “but it would be\r\nno use to take him to Green Gables. Marilla detests cats, and Davy\r\nwould tease his life out. Besides, I don’t suppose I’ll be home very\r\nlong. I’ve been offered the principalship of the Summerside High\r\nSchool.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to accept it?” asked Phil.\r\n\r\n“I—I haven’t decided yet,” answered Anne, with a confused flush.\r\n\r\nPhil nodded understandingly. Naturally Anne’s plans could not be\r\nsettled until Roy had spoken. He would soon—there was no doubt of that.\r\nAnd there was no doubt that Anne would say “yes” when he said “Will you\r\nplease?” Anne herself regarded the state of affairs with a\r\nseldom-ruffled complacency. She was deeply in love with Roy. True, it\r\nwas not just what she had imagined love to be. But was anything in\r\nlife, Anne asked herself wearily, like one’s imagination of it? It was\r\nthe old diamond disillusion of childhood repeated—the same\r\ndisappointment she had felt when she had first seen the chill sparkle\r\ninstead of the purple splendor she had anticipated. “That’s not my idea\r\nof a diamond,” she had said. But Roy was a dear fellow and they would\r\nbe very happy together, even if some indefinable zest was missing out\r\nof life. When Roy came down that evening and asked Anne to walk in the\r\npark every one at Patty’s Place knew what he had come to say; and every\r\none knew, or thought they knew, what Anne’s answer would be.\r\n\r\n“Anne is a very fortunate girl,” said Aunt Jamesina.\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” said Stella, shrugging her shoulders. “Roy is a nice\r\nfellow and all that. But there’s really nothing in him.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds very like a jealous remark, Stella Maynard,” said Aunt\r\nJamesina rebukingly.\r\n\r\n“It does—but I am not jealous,” said Stella calmly. “I love Anne and I\r\nlike Roy. Everybody says she is making a brilliant match, and even Mrs.\r\nGardner thinks her charming now. It all sounds as if it were made in\r\nheaven, but I have my doubts. Make the most of that, Aunt Jamesina.”\r\n\r\nRoy asked Anne to marry him in the little pavilion on the harbor shore\r\nwhere they had talked on the rainy day of their first meeting. Anne\r\nthought it very romantic that he should have chosen that spot. And his\r\nproposal was as beautifully worded as if he had copied it, as one of\r\nRuby Gillis’ lovers had done, out of a Deportment of Courtship and\r\nMarriage. The whole effect was quite flawless. And it was also sincere.\r\nThere was no doubt that Roy meant what he said. There was no false note\r\nto jar the symphony. Anne felt that she ought to be thrilling from head\r\nto foot. But she wasn’t; she was horribly cool. When Roy paused for his\r\nanswer she opened her lips to say her fateful yes. And then—she found\r\nherself trembling as if she were reeling back from a precipice. To her\r\ncame one of those moments when we realize, as by a blinding flash of\r\nillumination, more than all our previous years have taught us. She\r\npulled her hand from Roy’s.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can’t marry you—I can’t—I can’t,” she cried, wildly.\r\n\r\nRoy turned pale—and also looked rather foolish. He had—small blame to\r\nhim—felt very sure.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” he stammered.\r\n\r\n“I mean that I can’t marry you,” repeated Anne desperately. “I thought\r\nI could—but I can’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why can’t you?” Roy asked more calmly.\r\n\r\n“Because—I don’t care enough for you.”\r\n\r\nA crimson streak came into Roy’s face.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve just been amusing yourself these two years?” he said slowly.\r\n\r\n“No, no, I haven’t,” gasped poor Anne. Oh, how could she explain? She\r\n_couldn’t_ explain. There are some things that cannot be explained. “I\r\ndid think I cared—truly I did—but I know now I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“You have ruined my life,” said Roy bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” pleaded Anne miserably, with hot cheeks and stinging\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nRoy turned away and stood for a few minutes looking out seaward. When\r\nhe came back to Anne, he was very pale again.\r\n\r\n“You can give me no hope?” he said.\r\n\r\nAnne shook her head mutely.\r\n\r\n“Then—good-bye,” said Roy. “I can’t understand it—I can’t believe you\r\nare not the woman I’ve believed you to be. But reproaches are idle\r\nbetween us. You are the only woman I can ever love. I thank you for\r\nyour friendship, at least. Good-bye, Anne.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” faltered Anne. When Roy had gone she sat for a long time in\r\nthe pavilion, watching a white mist creeping subtly and remorselessly\r\nlandward up the harbor. It was her hour of humiliation and\r\nself-contempt and shame. Their waves went over her. And yet, underneath\r\nit all, was a queer sense of recovered freedom.\r\n\r\nShe slipped into Patty’s Place in the dusk and escaped to her room. But\r\nPhil was there on the window seat.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Anne, flushing to anticipate the scene. “Wait til you hear\r\nwhat I have to say. Phil, Roy asked me to marry him-and I refused.”\r\n\r\n“You—you _refused_ him?” said Phil blankly.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Anne Shirley, are you in your senses?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” said Anne wearily. “Oh, Phil, don’t scold me. You don’t\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly don’t understand. You’ve encouraged Roy Gardner in every\r\nway for two years—and now you tell me you’ve refused him. Then you’ve\r\njust been flirting scandalously with him. Anne, I couldn’t have\r\nbelieved it of _you_.”\r\n\r\n“I _wasn’t_ flirting with him—I honestly thought I cared up to the last\r\nminute—and then—well, I just knew I _never_ could marry him.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Phil cruelly, “that you intended to marry him for his\r\nmoney, and then your better self rose up and prevented you.”\r\n\r\n“I _didnt’t_. I never thought about his money. Oh, I can’t explain it\r\nto you any more than I could to him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I certainly think you have treated Roy shamefully,” said Phil in\r\nexasperation. “He’s handsome and clever and rich and good. What more do\r\nyou want?”\r\n\r\n“I want some one who _belongs_ in my life. He doesn’t. I was swept off\r\nmy feet at first by his good looks and knack of paying romantic\r\ncompliments; and later on I thought I _must_ be in love because he was\r\nmy dark-eyed ideal.”\r\n\r\n“I am bad enough for not knowing my own mind, but you are worse,” said\r\nPhil.\r\n\r\n“_I_ _do_ know my own mind,” protested Anne. “The trouble is, my mind\r\nchanges and then I have to get acquainted with it all over again.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose there is no use in saying anything to you.”\r\n\r\n“There is no need, Phil. I’m in the dust. This has spoiled everything\r\nbackwards. I can never think of Redmond days without recalling the\r\nhumiliation of this evening. Roy despises me—and you despise me—and I\r\ndespise myself.”\r\n\r\n“You poor darling,” said Phil, melting. “Just come here and let me\r\ncomfort you. I’ve no right to scold you. I’d have married Alec or\r\nAlonzo if I hadn’t met Jo. Oh, Anne, things are so mixed-up in real\r\nlife. They aren’t clear-cut and trimmed off, as they are in novels.”\r\n\r\n“I hope that _no_ one will ever again ask me to marry him as long as I\r\nlive,” sobbed poor Anne, devoutly believing that she meant it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX\r\nDeals with Weddings\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the\r\nfirst few weeks after her return to Green Gables. She missed the merry\r\ncomradeship of Patty’s Place. She had dreamed some brilliant dreams\r\nduring the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her. In her\r\npresent mood of self-disgust, she could not immediately begin dreaming\r\nagain. And she discovered that, while solitude with dreams is glorious,\r\nsolitude without them has few charms.\r\n\r\nShe had not seen Roy again after their painful parting in the park\r\npavilion; but Dorothy came to see her before she left Kingsport.\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry you won’t marry Roy,” she said. “I did want you for\r\na sister. But you are quite right. He would bore you to death. I love\r\nhim, and he is a dear sweet boy, but really he isn’t a bit interesting.\r\nHe looks as if he ought to be, but he isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“This won’t spoil _our_ friendship, will it, Dorothy?” Anne had asked\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n“No, indeed. You’re too good to lose. If I can’t have you for a sister\r\nI mean to keep you as a chum anyway. And don’t fret over Roy. He is\r\nfeeling terribly just now—I have to listen to his outpourings every\r\nday—but he’ll get over it. He always does.”\r\n\r\n“Oh—_always?_” said Anne with a slight change of voice. “So he has ‘got\r\nover it’ before?”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, yes,” said Dorothy frankly. “Twice before. And he raved to me\r\njust the same both times. Not that the others actually refused him—they\r\nsimply announced their engagements to some one else. Of course, when he\r\nmet you he vowed to me that he had never really loved before—that the\r\nprevious affairs had been merely boyish fancies. But I don’t think you\r\nneed worry.”\r\n\r\nAnne decided not to worry. Her feelings were a mixture of relief and\r\nresentment. Roy had certainly told her she was the only one he had ever\r\nloved. No doubt he believed it. But it was a comfort to feel that she\r\nhad not, in all likelihood, ruined his life. There were other\r\ngoddesses, and Roy, according to Dorothy, must needs be worshipping at\r\nsome shrine. Nevertheless, life was stripped of several more illusions,\r\nand Anne began to think drearily that it seemed rather bare.\r\n\r\nShe came down from the porch gable on the evening of her return with a\r\nsorrowful face.\r\n\r\n“What has happened to the old Snow Queen, Marilla?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I knew you’d feel bad over that,” said Marilla. “I felt bad\r\nmyself. That tree was there ever since I was a young girl. It blew down\r\nin the big gale we had in March. It was rotten at the core.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll miss it so,” grieved Anne. “The porch gable doesn’t seem the same\r\nroom without it. I’ll never look from its window again without a sense\r\nof loss. And oh, I never came home to Green Gables before that Diana\r\nwasn’t here to welcome me.”\r\n\r\n“Diana has something else to think of just now,” said Mrs. Lynde\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n“Well, tell me all the Avonlea news,” said Anne, sitting down on the\r\nporch steps, where the evening sunshine fell over her hair in a fine\r\ngolden rain.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t much news except what we’ve wrote you,” said Mrs. Lynde.\r\n“I suppose you haven’t heard that Simon Fletcher broke his leg last\r\nweek. It’s a great thing for his family. They’re getting a hundred\r\nthings done that they’ve always wanted to do but couldn’t as long as he\r\nwas about, the old crank.”\r\n\r\n“He came of an aggravating family,” remarked Marilla.\r\n\r\n“Aggravating? Well, rather! His mother used to get up in prayer-meeting\r\nand tell all her children’s shortcomings and ask prayers for them.\r\n’Course it made them mad, and worse than ever.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t told Anne the news about Jane,” suggested Marilla.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jane,” sniffed Mrs. Lynde. “Well,” she conceded grudgingly, “Jane\r\nAndrews is home from the West—came last week—and she’s going to be\r\nmarried to a Winnipeg millionaire. You may be sure Mrs. Harmon lost no\r\ntime in telling it far and wide.”\r\n\r\n“Dear old Jane—I’m so glad,” said Anne heartily. “She deserves the good\r\nthings of life.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I ain’t saying anything against Jane. She’s a nice enough girl.\r\nBut she isn’t in the millionaire class, and you’ll find there’s not\r\nmuch to recommend that man but his money, that’s what. Mrs. Harmon says\r\nhe’s an Englishman who has made money in mines but _I_ believe he’ll\r\nturn out to be a Yankee. He certainly must have money, for he has just\r\nshowered Jane with jewelry. Her engagement ring is a diamond cluster so\r\nbig that it looks like a plaster on Jane’s fat paw.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde could not keep some bitterness out of her tone. Here was\r\nJane Andrews, that plain little plodder, engaged to a millionaire,\r\nwhile Anne, it seemed, was not yet bespoken by any one, rich or poor.\r\nAnd Mrs. Harmon Andrews did brag insufferably.\r\n\r\n“What has Gilbert Blythe been doing to at college?” asked Marilla. “I\r\nsaw him when he came home last week, and he is so pale and thin I\r\nhardly knew him.”\r\n\r\n“He studied very hard last winter,” said Anne. “You know he took High\r\nHonors in Classics and the Cooper Prize. It hasn’t been taken for five\r\nyears! So I think he’s rather run down. We’re all a little tired.”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, you’re a B.A. and Jane Andrews isn’t and never will be,” said\r\nMrs. Lynde, with gloomy satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA few evenings later Anne went down to see Jane, but the latter was\r\naway in Charlottetown—“getting sewing done,” Mrs. Harmon informed Anne\r\nproudly. “Of course an Avonlea dressmaker wouldn’t do for Jane under\r\nthe circumstances.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard something very nice about Jane,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Jane has done pretty well, even if she isn’t a B.A.,” said Mrs.\r\nHarmon, with a slight toss of her head. “Mr. Inglis is worth millions,\r\nand they’re going to Europe on their wedding tour. When they come back\r\nthey’ll live in a perfect mansion of marble in Winnipeg. Jane has only\r\none trouble—she can cook so well and her husband won’t let her cook. He\r\nis so rich he hires his cooking done. They’re going to keep a cook and\r\ntwo other maids and a coachman and a man-of-all-work. But what about\r\n_you_, Anne? I don’t hear anything of your being married, after all\r\nyour college-going.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” laughed Anne, “I am going to be an old maid. I really can’t find\r\nany one to suit me.” It was rather wicked of her. She deliberately\r\nmeant to remind Mrs. Andrews that if she became an old maid it was not\r\nbecause she had not had at least one chance of marriage. But Mrs.\r\nHarmon took swift revenge.\r\n\r\n“Well, the over-particular girls generally get left, I notice. And\r\nwhat’s this I hear about Gilbert Blythe being engaged to a Miss Stuart?\r\nCharlie Sloane tells me she is perfectly beautiful. Is it true?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know if it is true that he is engaged to Miss Stuart,” replied\r\nAnne, with Spartan composure, “but it is certainly true that she is\r\nvery lovely.”\r\n\r\n“I once thought you and Gilbert would have made a match of it,” said\r\nMrs. Harmon. “If you don’t take care, Anne, all of your beaux will slip\r\nthrough your fingers.”\r\n\r\nAnne decided not to continue her duel with Mrs. Harmon. You could not\r\nfence with an antagonist who met rapier thrust with blow of battle axe.\r\n\r\n“Since Jane is away,” she said, rising haughtily, “I don’t think I can\r\nstay longer this morning. I’ll come down when she comes home.”\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Mrs. Harmon effusively. “Jane isn’t a bit proud. She just\r\nmeans to associate with her old friends the same as ever. She’ll be\r\nreal glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nJane’s millionaire arrived the last of May and carried her off in a\r\nblaze of splendor. Mrs. Lynde was spitefully gratified to find that Mr.\r\nInglis was every day of forty, and short and thin and grayish. Mrs.\r\nLynde did not spare him in her enumeration of his shortcomings, you may\r\nbe sure.\r\n\r\n“It will take all his gold to gild a pill like him, that’s what,” said\r\nMrs. Rachel solemnly.\r\n\r\n“He looks kind and good-hearted,” said Anne loyally, “and I’m sure he\r\nthinks the world of Jane.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said Mrs. Rachel.\r\n\r\nPhil Gordon was married the next week and Anne went over to Bolingbroke\r\nto be her bridesmaid. Phil made a dainty fairy of a bride, and the Rev.\r\nJo was so radiant in his happiness that nobody thought him plain.\r\n\r\n“We’re going for a lovers’ saunter through the land of Evangeline,”\r\nsaid Phil, “and then we’ll settle down on Patterson Street. Mother\r\nthinks it is terrible—she thinks Jo might at least take a church in a\r\ndecent place. But the wilderness of the Patterson slums will blossom\r\nlike the rose for me if Jo is there. Oh, Anne, I’m so happy my heart\r\naches with it.”\r\n\r\nAnne was always glad in the happiness of her friends; but it is\r\nsometimes a little lonely to be surrounded everywhere by a happiness\r\nthat is not your own. And it was just the same when she went back to\r\nAvonlea. This time it was Diana who was bathed in the wonderful glory\r\nthat comes to a woman when her first-born is laid beside her. Anne\r\nlooked at the white young mother with a certain awe that had never\r\nentered into her feelings for Diana before. Could this pale woman with\r\nthe rapture in her eyes be the little black-curled, rosy-cheeked Diana\r\nshe had played with in vanished schooldays? It gave her a queer\r\ndesolate feeling that she herself somehow belonged only in those past\r\nyears and had no business in the present at all.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t he perfectly beautiful?” said Diana proudly.\r\n\r\nThe little fat fellow was absurdly like Fred—just as round, just as\r\nred. Anne really could not say conscientiously that she thought him\r\nbeautiful, but she vowed sincerely that he was sweet and kissable and\r\naltogether delightful.\r\n\r\n“Before he came I wanted a girl, so that I could call her ANNE,” said\r\nDiana. “But now that little Fred is here I wouldn’t exchange him for a\r\nmillion girls. He just _couldn’t_ have been anything but his own\r\nprecious self.”\r\n\r\n“‘Every little baby is the sweetest and the best,’” quoted Mrs. Allan\r\ngaily. “If little Anne _had_ come you’d have felt just the same about\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Allan was visiting in Avonlea, for the first time since leaving\r\nit. She was as gay and sweet and sympathetic as ever. Her old girl\r\nfriends had welcomed her back rapturously. The reigning minister’s wife\r\nwas an estimable lady, but she was not exactly a kindred spirit.\r\n\r\n“I can hardly wait till he gets old enough to talk,” sighed Diana. “I\r\njust long to hear him say ‘mother.’ And oh, I’m determined that his\r\nfirst memory of me shall be a nice one. The first memory I have of my\r\nmother is of her slapping me for something I had done. I am sure I\r\ndeserved it, and mother was always a good mother and I love her dearly.\r\nBut I do wish my first memory of her was nicer.”\r\n\r\n“I have just one memory of my mother and it is the sweetest of all my\r\nmemories,” said Mrs. Allan. “I was five years old, and I had been\r\nallowed to go to school one day with my two older sisters. When school\r\ncame out my sisters went home in different groups, each supposing I was\r\nwith the other. Instead I had run off with a little girl I had played\r\nwith at recess. We went to her home, which was near the school, and\r\nbegan making mud pies. We were having a glorious time when my older\r\nsister arrived, breathless and angry.\r\n\r\n“‘You naughty girl” she cried, snatching my reluctant hand and dragging\r\nme along with her. ‘Come home this minute. Oh, you’re going to catch\r\nit! Mother is awful cross. She is going to give you a good whipping.’\r\n\r\n“I had never been whipped. Dread and terror filled my poor little\r\nheart. I have never been so miserable in my life as I was on that walk\r\nhome. I had not meant to be naughty. Phemy Cameron had asked me to go\r\nhome with her and I had not known it was wrong to go. And now I was to\r\nbe whipped for it. When we got home my sister dragged me into the\r\nkitchen where mother was sitting by the fire in the twilight. My poor\r\nwee legs were trembling so that I could hardly stand. And mother—mother\r\njust took me up in her arms, without one word of rebuke or harshness,\r\nkissed me and held me close to her heart. ‘I was so frightened you were\r\nlost, darling,’ she said tenderly. I could see the love shining in her\r\neyes as she looked down on me. She never scolded or reproached me for\r\nwhat I had done—only told me I must never go away again without asking\r\npermission. She died very soon afterwards. That is the only memory I\r\nhave of her. Isn’t it a beautiful one?”\r\n\r\nAnne felt lonelier than ever as she walked home, going by way of the\r\nBirch Path and Willowmere. She had not walked that way for many moons.\r\nIt was a darkly-purple bloomy night. The air was heavy with blossom\r\nfragrance—almost too heavy. The cloyed senses recoiled from it as from\r\nan overfull cup. The birches of the path had grown from the fairy\r\nsaplings of old to big trees. Everything had changed. Anne felt that\r\nshe would be glad when the summer was over and she was away at work\r\nagain. Perhaps life would not seem so empty then.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ve tried the world—it wears no more\r\nThe coloring of romance it wore,’”\r\n\r\n\r\nsighed Anne—and was straightway much comforted by the romance in the\r\nidea of the world being denuded of romance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL\r\nA Book of Revelation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irvings came back to Echo Lodge for the summer, and Anne spent a\r\nhappy three weeks there in July. Miss Lavendar had not changed;\r\nCharlotta the Fourth was a very grown-up young lady now, but still\r\nadored Anne sincerely.\r\n\r\n“When all’s said and done, Miss Shirley, ma’am, I haven’t seen any one\r\nin Boston that’s equal to you,” she said frankly.\r\n\r\nPaul was almost grown up, too. He was sixteen, his chestnut curls had\r\ngiven place to close-cropped brown locks, and he was more interested in\r\nfootball than fairies. But the bond between him and his old teacher\r\nstill held. Kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years.\r\n\r\nIt was a wet, bleak, cruel evening in July when Anne came back to Green\r\nGables. One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the\r\ngulf was ravaging the sea. As Anne came in the first raindrops dashed\r\nagainst the panes.\r\n\r\n“Was that Paul who brought you home?” asked Marilla. “Why didn’t you\r\nmake him stay all night. It’s going to be a wild evening.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy, I think.\r\nAnyway, he wanted to go back tonight. Well, I’ve had a splendid visit,\r\nbut I’m glad to see you dear folks again. ‘East, west, hame’s best.’\r\nDavy, have you been growing again lately?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve growed a whole inch since you left,” said Davy proudly. “I’m as\r\ntall as Milty Boulter now. Ain’t I glad. He’ll have to stop crowing\r\nabout being bigger. Say, Anne, did you know that Gilbert Blythe is\r\ndying?” Anne stood quite silent and motionless, looking at Davy. Her\r\nface had gone so white that Marilla thought she was going to faint.\r\n\r\n“Davy, hold your tongue,” said Mrs. Rachel angrily. “Anne, don’t look\r\nlike that—_don’t look like that!_ We didn’t mean to tell you so\r\nsuddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Is—it—true?” asked Anne in a voice that was not hers.\r\n\r\n“Gilbert is very ill,” said Mrs. Lynde gravely. “He took down with\r\ntyphoid fever just after you left for Echo Lodge. Did you never hear of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said that unknown voice.\r\n\r\n“It was a very bad case from the start. The doctor said he’d been\r\nterribly run down. They’ve a trained nurse and everything’s been done.\r\n_don’t_ look like that, Anne. While there’s life there’s hope.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of\r\nhim,” reiterated Davy.\r\n\r\nMarilla, looking old and worn and tired, got up and marched Davy grimly\r\nout of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _don’t_ look so, dear,” said Mrs. Rachel, putting her kind old\r\narms about the pallid girl. “I haven’t given up hope, indeed I haven’t.\r\nHe’s got the Blythe constitution in his favor, that’s what.”\r\n\r\nAnne gently put Mrs. Lynde’s arms away from her, walked blindly across\r\nthe kitchen, through the hall, up the stairs to her old room. At its\r\nwindow she knelt down, staring out unseeingly. It was very dark. The\r\nrain was beating down over the shivering fields. The Haunted Woods was\r\nfull of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest, and the air\r\nthrobbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore. And\r\nGilbert was dying!\r\n\r\nThere is a book of Revelation in every one’s life, as there is in the\r\nBible. Anne read hers that bitter night, as she kept her agonized vigil\r\nthrough the hours of storm and darkness. She loved Gilbert—had always\r\nloved him! She knew that now. She knew that she could no more cast him\r\nout of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right\r\nhand and cast it from her. And the knowledge had come too late—too late\r\neven for the bitter solace of being with him at the last. If she had\r\nnot been so blind—so foolish—she would have had the right to go to him\r\nnow. But he would never know that she loved him—he would go away from\r\nthis life thinking that she did not care. Oh, the black years of\r\nemptiness stretching before her! She could not live through them—she\r\ncould not! She cowered down by her window and wished, for the first\r\ntime in her gay young life, that she could die, too. If Gilbert went\r\naway from her, without one word or sign or message, she could not live.\r\nNothing was of any value without him. She belonged to him and he to\r\nher. In her hour of supreme agony she had no doubt of that. He did not\r\nlove Christine Stuart—never had loved Christine Stuart. Oh, what a fool\r\nshe had been not to realize what the bond was that had held her to\r\nGilbert—to think that the flattered fancy she had felt for Roy Gardner\r\nhad been love. And now she must pay for her folly as for a crime.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lynde and Marilla crept to her door before they went to bed, shook\r\ntheir heads doubtfully at each other over the silence, and went away.\r\nThe storm raged all night, but when the dawn came it was spent. Anne\r\nsaw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of darkness. Soon the eastern\r\nhilltops had a fire-shot ruby rim. The clouds rolled themselves away\r\ninto great, soft, white masses on the horizon; the sky gleamed blue and\r\nsilvery. A hush fell over the world.\r\n\r\nAnne rose from her knees and crept downstairs. The freshness of the\r\nrain-wind blew against her white face as she went out into the yard,\r\nand cooled her dry, burning eyes. A merry rollicking whistle was\r\nlilting up the lane. A moment later Pacifique Buote came in sight.\r\n\r\nAnne’s physical strength suddenly failed her. If she had not clutched\r\nat a low willow bough she would have fallen. Pacifique was George\r\nFletcher’s hired man, and George Fletcher lived next door to the\r\nBlythes. Mrs. Fletcher was Gilbert’s aunt. Pacifique would know\r\nif—if—Pacifique would know what there was to be known.\r\n\r\nPacifique strode sturdily on along the red lane, whistling. He did not\r\nsee Anne. She made three futile attempts to call him. He was almost\r\npast before she succeeded in making her quivering lips call,\r\n“Pacifique!”\r\n\r\nPacifique turned with a grin and a cheerful good morning.\r\n\r\n“Pacifique,” said Anne faintly, “did you come from George Fletcher’s\r\nthis morning?”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Pacifique amiably. “I got de word las’ night dat my fader,\r\nhe was seeck. It was so stormy dat I couldn’t go den, so I start vair\r\nearly dis mornin’. I’m goin’ troo de woods for short cut.”\r\n\r\n“Did you hear how Gilbert Blythe was this morning?” Anne’s desperation\r\ndrove her to the question. Even the worst would be more endurable than\r\nthis hideous suspense.\r\n\r\n“He’s better,” said Pacifique. “He got de turn las’ night. De doctor\r\nsay he’ll be all right now dis soon while. Had close shave, dough! Dat\r\nboy, he jus’ keel himself at college. Well, I mus’ hurry. De old man,\r\nhe’ll be in hurry to see me.”\r\n\r\nPacifique resumed his walk and his whistle. Anne gazed after him with\r\neyes where joy was driving out the strained anguish of the night. He\r\nwas a very lank, very ragged, very homely youth. But in her sight he\r\nwas as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains.\r\nNever, as long as she lived, would Anne see Pacifique’s brown, round,\r\nblack-eyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had\r\ngiven to her the oil of joy for mourning.\r\n\r\nLong after Pacifique’s gay whistle had faded into the phantom of music\r\nand then into silence far up under the maples of Lover’s Lane Anne\r\nstood under the willows, tasting the poignant sweetness of life when\r\nsome great dread has been removed from it. The morning was a cup filled\r\nwith mist and glamor. In the corner near her was a rich surprise of\r\nnew-blown, crystal-dewed roses. The trills and trickles of song from\r\nthe birds in the big tree above her seemed in perfect accord with her\r\nmood. A sentence from a very old, very true, very wonderful Book came\r\nto her lips,\r\n\r\n“Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI\r\nLove Takes Up the Glass of Time\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’ve come up to ask you to go for one of our old-time rambles through\r\nSeptember woods and ‘over hills where spices grow,’ this afternoon,”\r\nsaid Gilbert, coming suddenly around the porch corner. “Suppose we\r\nvisit Hester Gray’s garden.”\r\n\r\nAnne, sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale, filmy,\r\ngreen stuff, looked up rather blankly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wish I could,” she said slowly, “but I really can’t, Gilbert.\r\nI’m going to Alice Penhallow’s wedding this evening, you know. I’ve got\r\nto do something to this dress, and by the time it’s finished I’ll have\r\nto get ready. I’m so sorry. I’d love to go.”\r\n\r\n“Well, can you go tomorrow afternoon, then?” asked Gilbert, apparently\r\nnot much disappointed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so.”\r\n\r\n“In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I should\r\notherwise have to do tomorrow. So Alice Penhallow is to be married\r\ntonight. Three weddings for you in one summer, Anne—Phil’s, Alice’s,\r\nand Jane’s. I’ll never forgive Jane for not inviting me to her\r\nwedding.”\r\n\r\n“You really can’t blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews\r\nconnection who had to be invited. The house could hardly hold them all.\r\nI was only bidden by grace of being Jane’s old chum—at least on Jane’s\r\npart. I think Mrs. Harmon’s motive for inviting me was to let me see\r\nJane’s surpassing gorgeousness.”\r\n\r\n“Is it true that she wore so many diamonds that you couldn’t tell where\r\nthe diamonds left off and Jane began?”\r\n\r\nAnne laughed.\r\n\r\n“She certainly wore a good many. What with all the diamonds and white\r\nsatin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms, prim little\r\nJane was almost lost to sight. But she was _very_ happy, and so was Mr.\r\nInglis—and so was Mrs. Harmon.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the dress you’re going to wear tonight?” asked Gilbert,\r\nlooking down at the fluffs and frills.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Isn’t it pretty? And I shall wear starflowers in my hair. The\r\nHaunted Wood is full of them this summer.”\r\n\r\nGilbert had a sudden vision of Anne, arrayed in a frilly green gown,\r\nwith the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it, and\r\nwhite stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair. The vision\r\nmade him catch his breath. But he turned lightly away.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be up tomorrow. Hope you’ll have a nice time tonight.”\r\n\r\nAnne looked after him as he strode away, and sighed. Gilbert was\r\nfriendly—very friendly—far too friendly. He had come quite often to\r\nGreen Gables after his recovery, and something of their old comradeship\r\nhad returned. But Anne no longer found it satisfying. The rose of love\r\nmade the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast. And Anne\r\nhad again begun to doubt if Gilbert now felt anything for her but\r\nfriendship. In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of\r\nthat rapt morning had faded. She was haunted by a miserable fear that\r\nher mistake could never be rectified. It was quite likely that it was\r\nChristine whom Gilbert loved after all. Perhaps he was even engaged to\r\nher. Anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart, and\r\nreconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the\r\nplace of love. She could do good, if not noble, work as a teacher; and\r\nthe success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain\r\neditorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams.\r\nBut—but—Anne picked up her green dress and sighed again.\r\n\r\nWhen Gilbert came the next afternoon he found Anne waiting for him,\r\nfresh as the dawn and fair as a star, after all the gaiety of the\r\npreceding night. She wore a green dress—not the one she had worn to the\r\nwedding, but an old one which Gilbert had told her at a Redmond\r\nreception he liked especially. It was just the shade of green that\r\nbrought out the rich tints of her hair, and the starry gray of her eyes\r\nand the iris-like delicacy of her skin. Gilbert, glancing at her\r\nsideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath, thought she had never\r\nlooked so lovely. Anne, glancing sideways at Gilbert, now and then,\r\nthought how much older he looked since his illness. It was as if he had\r\nput boyhood behind him forever.\r\n\r\nThe day was beautiful and the way was beautiful. Anne was almost sorry\r\nwhen they reached Hester Gray’s garden, and sat down on the old bench.\r\nBut it was beautiful there, too—as beautiful as it had been on the\r\nfaraway day of the Golden Picnic, when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and\r\nshe had found it. Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets;\r\nnow golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters\r\ndotted it bluely. The call of the brook came up through the woods from\r\nthe valley of birches with all its old allurement; the mellow air was\r\nfull of the purr of the sea; beyond were fields rimmed by fences\r\nbleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers, and long hills\r\nscarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds; with the blowing of the\r\nwest wind old dreams returned.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Anne softly, “that ‘the land where dreams come true’ is\r\nin the blue haze yonder, over that little valley.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any unfulfilled dreams, Anne?” asked Gilbert.\r\n\r\nSomething in his tone—something she had not heard since that miserable\r\nevening in the orchard at Patty’s Place—made Anne’s heart beat wildly.\r\nBut she made answer lightly.\r\n\r\n“Of course. Everybody has. It wouldn’t do for us to have all our dreams\r\nfulfilled. We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream\r\nabout. What a delicious aroma that low-descending sun is extracting\r\nfrom the asters and ferns. I wish we could see perfumes as well as\r\nsmell them. I’m sure they would be very beautiful.”\r\n\r\nGilbert was not to be thus sidetracked.\r\n\r\n“I have a dream,” he said slowly. “I persist in dreaming it, although\r\nit has often seemed to me that it could never come true. I dream of a\r\nhome with a hearth-fire in it, a cat and dog, the footsteps of\r\nfriends—and _you!_”\r\n\r\nAnne wanted to speak but she could find no words. Happiness was\r\nbreaking over her like a wave. It almost frightened her.\r\n\r\n“I asked you a question over two years ago, Anne. If I ask it again\r\ntoday will you give me a different answer?”\r\n\r\nStill Anne could not speak. But she lifted her eyes, shining with all\r\nthe love-rapture of countless generations, and looked into his for a\r\nmoment. He wanted no other answer.\r\n\r\nThey lingered in the old garden until twilight, sweet as dusk in Eden\r\nmust have been, crept over it. There was so much to talk over and\r\nrecall—things said and done and heard and thought and felt and\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n“I thought you loved Christine Stuart,” Anne told him, as reproachfully\r\nas if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved Roy\r\nGardner.\r\n\r\nGilbert laughed boyishly.\r\n\r\n“Christine was engaged to somebody in her home town. I knew it and she\r\nknew I knew it. When her brother graduated he told me his sister was\r\ncoming to Kingsport the next winter to take music, and asked me if I\r\nwould look after her a bit, as she knew no one and would be very\r\nlonely. So I did. And then I liked Christine for her own sake. She is\r\none of the nicest girls I’ve ever known. I knew college gossip credited\r\nus with being in love with each other. I didn’t care. Nothing mattered\r\nmuch to me for a time there, after you told me you could never love me,\r\nAnne. There was nobody else—there never could be anybody else for me\r\nbut you. I’ve loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over\r\nmy head in school.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a little\r\nfool,” said Anne.\r\n\r\n“Well, I tried to stop,” said Gilbert frankly, “not because I thought\r\nyou what you call yourself, but because I felt sure there was no chance\r\nfor me after Gardner came on the scene. But I couldn’t—and I can’t tell\r\nyou, either, what it’s meant to me these two years to believe you were\r\ngoing to marry him, and be told every week by some busybody that your\r\nengagement was on the point of being announced. I believed it until one\r\nblessed day when I was sitting up after the fever. I got a letter from\r\nPhil Gordon—Phil Blake, rather—in which she told me there was really\r\nnothing between you and Roy, and advised me to ‘try again.’ Well, the\r\ndoctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that.”\r\n\r\nAnne laughed—then shivered.\r\n\r\n“I can never forget the night I thought you were dying, Gilbert. Oh, I\r\nknew—I _knew_ then—and I thought it was too late.”\r\n\r\n“But it wasn’t, sweetheart. Oh, Anne, this makes up for everything,\r\ndoesn’t it? Let’s resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all\r\nour lives for the gift it has given us.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the birthday of our happiness,” said Anne softly. “I’ve always\r\nloved this old garden of Hester Gray’s, and now it will be dearer than\r\never.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ll have to ask you to wait a long time, Anne,” said Gilbert\r\nsadly. “It will be three years before I’ll finish my medical course.\r\nAnd even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls.”\r\n\r\nAnne laughed.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want sunbursts and marble halls. I just want _you_. You see\r\nI’m quite as shameless as Phil about it. Sunbursts and marble halls may\r\nbe all very well, but there is more ‘scope for imagination’ without\r\nthem. And as for the waiting, that doesn’t matter. We’ll just be happy,\r\nwaiting and working for each other—and dreaming. Oh, dreams will be\r\nvery sweet now.”\r\n\r\nGilbert drew her close to him and kissed her. Then they walked home\r\ntogether in the dusk, crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of\r\nlove, along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever\r\nbloomed, and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew.",
