In truth, the belief in the possibility of a _coup d'état_ had\r\nbecome humiliating. The supposition of such illegal violence on the part\r\nof M. Louis Bonaparte vanished upon serious consideration. The great\r\nquestion of the day was manifestly the Devincq election; it was clear\r\nthat the Government was only thinking of that matter. As to a conspiracy\r\nagainst the Republic and against the People, how could any one\r\npremeditate such a plot? Where was the man capable of entertaining such a\r\ndream? For a tragedy there must be an actor, and here assuredly the actor\r\nwas wanting. To outrage Right, to suppress the Assembly, to abolish the\r\nConstitution, to strangle the Republic, to overthrow the Nation, to sully\r\nthe Flag, to dishonor the Army, to suborn the Clergy and the Magistracy,\r\nto succeed, to triumph, to govern, to administer, to exile, to banish, to\r\ntransport, to ruin, to assassinate, to reign, with such complicities that\r\nthe law at last resembles a foul bed of corruption. What! All these\r\nenormities were to be committed! And by whom? By a Colossus? No, by a\r\ndwarf. People laughed at the notion. They no longer said \"What a crime!\"\r\nbut \"What a farce!\" For after all they reflected; heinous crimes require\r\nstature. Certain crimes are too lofty for certain hands. A man who would\r\nachieve an 18th Brumaire must have Arcola in his past and Austerlitz in\r\nhis future. The art of becoming a great scoundrel is not accorded to the\r\nfirst comer. People said to themselves, Who is this son of Hortense? He\r\nhas Strasbourg behind him instead of Arcola, and Boulogne in place of\r\nAusterlitz. He is a Frenchman, born a Dutchman, and naturalized a Swiss;\r\nhe is a Bonaparte crossed with a Verhuell; he is only celebrated for the\r\nludicrousness of his imperial attitude, and he who would pluck a feather\r\nfrom his eagle would risk finding a goose's quill in his hand. This\r\nBonaparte does not pass currency in the array, he is a counterfeit image\r\nless of gold than of lead, and assuredly French soldiers will not give us\r\nthe change for this false Napoleon in rebellion, in atrocities, in\r\nmassacres, in outrages, in treason. If he should attempt roguery it would\r\nmiscarry. Not a regiment would stir. Besides, why should he make such an\r\nattempt? Doubtless he has his suspicious side, but why suppose him an\r\nabsolute villain? Such extreme outrages are beyond him; he is incapable\r\nof them physically, why judge him capable of them morally? Has he not\r\npledged honor? Has he not said, \"No one in Europe doubts my word?\" Let us\r\nfear nothing. To this could be answered, Crimes are committed either on a\r\ngrand or on a mean scale. In the first category there is Caesar; in the\r\nsecond there is Mandrin. Caesar passes the Rubicon, Mandrin bestrides the\r\ngutter. But wise men interposed, \"Are we not prejudiced by offensive\r\nconjectures? This man has been exiled and unfortunate. Exile enlightens,\r\nmisfortune corrects.\"\r\n\r\nFor his part Louis Bonaparte protested energetically. Facts abounded in\r\nhis favor. Why should he not act in good faith? He had made remarkable\r\npromises. Towards the end of October, 1848, then a candidate for the\r\nPresidency, he was calling at No. 37, Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne, on a\r\ncertain personage, to whom he remarked, \"I wish to have an explanation\r\nwith you. They slander me. Do I give you the impression of a madman? They\r\nthink that I wish to revivify Napoleon. There are two men whom a great\r\nambition can take for its models, Napoleon and Washington. The one is a\r\nman of Genius, the other is a man of Virtue. It is ridiculous to say, 'I\r\nwill be a man of Genius;' it is honest to say, 'I will be a man of\r\nVirtue.' Which of these depends upon ourselves? Which can we accomplish\r\nby our will? To be Genius? No. To be Probity? Yes. The attainment of\r\nGenius is not possible; the attainment of Probity is a possibility. And\r\nwhat could I revive of Napoleon? One sole thing--a crime. Truly a worthy\r\nambition! Why should I be considered man? The Republic being established,\r\nI am not a great man, I shall not copy Napoleon; but I am an honest man.\r\nI shall imitate Washington. My name, the name of Bonaparte, will be\r\ninscribed on two pages of the history of France: on the first there will\r\nbe crime and glory, on the second probity and honor. And the second will\r\nperhaps be worth the first. Why? Because if Napoleon is the greater,\r\nWashington is the better man. Between the guilty hero and the good\r\ncitizen I choose the good citizen. Such is my ambition.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1848 to 1851 three years elapsed. People had long suspected Louis\r\nBonaparte; but long-continued suspicion blunts the intellect and wears\r\nitself out by fruitless alarms. Louis Bonaparte had had dissimulating\r\nministers such as Magne and Rouher; but he had also had straightforward\r\nministers such as Léon Faucher and Odilon Barrot; and these last had\r\naffirmed that he was upright and sincere. He had been seen to beat his\r\nbreast before the doors of Ham; his foster sister, Madame Hortense\r\nCornu, wrote to Mieroslawsky, \"I am a good Republican, and I can answer\r\nfor him.\" His friend of Ham, Peauger, a loyal man, declared, \"Louis\r\nBonaparte is incapable of treason.\" Had not Louis Bonaparte written the\r\nwork entitled \"Pauperism\"? In the intimate circles of the Elysée Count\r\nPotocki was a Republican and Count d'Orsay was a Liberal; Louis\r\nBonaparte said to Potocki, \"I am a man of the Democracy,\" and to\r\nD'Orsay, \"I am a man of Liberty.\" The Marquis du Hallays opposed the\r\n_coup d'état_, while the Marquise du Hallays was in its favor. Louis\r\nBonaparte said to the Marquis, \"Fear nothing\" (it is true that he\r\nwhispered to the Marquise, \"Make your mind easy\"). The Assembly, after\r\nhaving shown here and there some symptoms of uneasiness, had grown calm.\r\nThere was General Neumayer, \"who was to be depended upon,\" and who from\r\nhis position at Lyons would at need march upon Paris. Changarnier\r\nexclaimed, \"Representatives of the people, deliberate in peace.\" Even\r\nLouis Bonaparte himself had pronounced these famous words, \"I should see\r\nan enemy of my country in any one who would change by force that which\r\nhas been established by law,\" and, moreover, the Army was \"force,\" and\r\nthe Army possessed leaders, leaders who were beloved and victorious.\r\nLamoricière, Changarnier, Cavaignac, Leflô, Bedeau, Charras; how could\r\nany one imagine the Army of Africa arresting the Generals of Africa? On\r\nFriday, November 28, 1851, Louis Bonaparte said to Michel de Bourges,\r\n\"If I wanted to do wrong, I could not. Yesterday, Thursday, I invited to\r\nmy table five Colonels of the garrison of Paris, and the whim seized me\r\nto question each one by himself. All five declared to me that the Army\r\nwould never lend itself to a _coup de force_, nor attack the\r\ninviolability of the Assembly. You can tell your friends this.\"--\"He\r\nsmiled,\" said Michel de Bourges, reassured, \"and I also smiled.\" After\r\nthis, Michel de Bourges declared in the Tribune, \"this is the man for\r\nme.\" In that same month of November a satirical journal, charged with\r\ncalumniating the President of the Republic, was sentenced to fine and\r\nimprisonment for a caricature depicting a shooting-gallery and Louis\r\nBonaparte using the Constitution as a target. Morigny, Minister of the\r\nInterior, declared in the Council before the President \"that a Guardian\r\nof Public Power ought never to violate the law as otherwise he would\r\nbe--\" \"a dishonest man,\" interposed the President. All these words and\r\nall these facts were notorious. The material and moral impossibility of\r\nthe _coup d'état_ was manifest to all. To outrage the National Assembly!\r\nTo arrest the Representatives! What madness! As we have seen, Charras,\r\nwho had long remained on his guard, unloaded his pistols. The feeling of\r\nsecurity was complete and unanimous. Nevertheless there were some of us\r\nin the Assembly who still retained a few doubts, and who occasionally\r\nshook our heads, but we were looked upon as fools.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Colonel Charras was Under-Secretary of State in 1848, and Acting\r\nSecretary of War under the Provisional Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARIS SLEEPS--THE BELL RINGS\r\n\r\nOn the 2d December, 1851, Representative Versigny, of the Haute-Saône,\r\nwho resided at Paris, at No. 4, Rue Léonie, was asleep. He slept\r\nsoundly; he had been working till late at night. Versigny was a young\r\nman of thirty-two, soft-featured and fair-complexioned, of a courageous\r\nspirit, and a mind tending towards social and economical studies. He had\r\npassed the first hours of the night in the perusal of a book by Bastiat,\r\nin which he was making marginal notes, and, leaving the book open on the\r\ntable, he had fallen asleep. Suddenly he awoke with a start at the sound\r\nof a sharp ring at the bell. He sprang up in surprise. It was dawn. It\r\nwas about seven o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nNever dreaming what could be the motive for so early a visit, and\r\nthinking that someone had mistaken the door, he again lay down, and was\r\nabout to resume his slumber, when a second ring at the bell, still\r\nlouder than the first, completely aroused him. He got up in his\r\nnight-shirt and opened the door.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges and Théodore Bac entered. Michel de Bourges was the\r\nneighbor of Versigny; he lived at No. 16, Rue de Milan.\r\n\r\nThéodore Bac and Michel were pale, and appeared greatly agitated.\r\n\r\n\"Versigny,\" said Michel, \"dress yourself at once--Baune has just been\r\narrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed Versigny. \"Is the Mauguin business beginning again?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is more than that,\" replied Michel. \"Baune's wife and daughter came\r\nto me half-an-hour ago. They awoke me. Baune was arrested in bed at six\r\no'clock this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Versigny.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang again.\r\n\r\n\"This will probably tell us,\" answered Michel de Bourges.\r\n\r\nVersigny opened the door. It was the Representative Pierre Lefranc. He\r\nbrought, in truth, the solution of the enigma.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what is happening?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Michel. \"Baune is in prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the Republic who is a prisoner,\" said Pierre Lefranc. \"Have you\r\nread the placards?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nPierre Lefranc explained to them that the walls at that moment were\r\ncovered with placards which the curious crowd were thronging to read,\r\nthat he had glanced over one of them at the corner of his street, and\r\nthat the blow had fallen.\r\n\r\n\"The blow!\" exclaimed Michel. \"Say rather the crime.\"\r\n\r\nPierre Lefranc added that there were three placards--one decree and two\r\nproclamations--all three on white paper, and pasted close together.\r\n\r\nThe decree was printed in large letters.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Constituent Laissac, who lodged, like Michel de Bourges, in the\r\nneighborhood (No. 4, Cité Gaillard), then came in. He brought the same\r\nnews, and announced further arrests which had been made during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThere was not a minute to lose.\r\n\r\nThey went to impart the news to Yvan, the Secretary of the Assembly, who\r\nhad been appointed by the Left, and who lived in the Rue de Boursault.\r\n\r\nAn immediate meeting was necessary. Those Republican Representatives who\r\nwere still at liberty must be warned and brought together without delay.\r\n\r\nVersigny said, \"I will go and find Victor Hugo.\"\r\n\r\nIt was eight o'clock in the morning. I was awake and was working in bed.\r\nMy servant entered and said, with an air of alarm,--\r\n\r\n\"A Representative of the people is outside who wishes to speak to you,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Versigny:\"\r\n\r\n\"Show him in.\"\r\n\r\nVersigny entered, and told me the state of affairs. I sprang out of bed.\r\n\r\nHe told me of the \"rendezvous\" at the rooms of the ex-Constituent\r\nLaissac.\r\n\r\n\"Go at once and inform the other Representatives,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe left me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT\r\n\r\nPrevious to the fatal days of June, 1848, the esplanade of the Invalides\r\nwas divided into eight huge grass plots, surrounded by wooden railings\r\nand enclosed between two groves of trees, separated by a street running\r\nperpendicularly to the front of the Invalides. This street was traversed\r\nby three streets running parallel to the Seine. There were large lawns\r\nupon which children were wont to play. The centre of the eight grass\r\nplots was marred by a pedestal which under the Empire had borne the\r\nbronze lion of St. Mark, which had been brought from Venice; under the\r\nRestoration a white marble statue of Louis XVIII.; and under Louis\r\nPhilippe a plaster bust of Lafayette. Owing to the Palace of the\r\nConstituent Assembly having been nearly seized by a crowd of insurgents on\r\nthe 22d of June, 1848, and there being no barracks in the neighborhood,\r\nGeneral Cavaignac had constructed at three hundred paces from the\r\nLegislative Palace, on the grass plots of the Invalides, several rows of\r\nlong huts, under which the grass was hidden. These huts, where three or\r\nfour thousand men could be accommodated, lodged the troops specially\r\nappointed to keep watch over the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st December, 1851, the two regiments hutted on the Esplanade were\r\nthe 6th and the 42d Regiments of the Line, the 6th commanded by Colonel\r\nGarderens de Boisse, who was famous before the Second of December, the\r\n42d by Colonel Espinasse, who became famous since that date.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary night-guard of the Palace of the Assembly was composed of a\r\nbattalion of Infantry and of thirty artillerymen, with a captain. The\r\nMinister of War, in addition, sent several troopers for orderly service.\r\nTwo mortars and six pieces of cannon, with their ammunition wagons, were\r\nranged in a little square courtyard situated on the right of the Cour\r\nd'Honneur, and which was called the Cour des Canons. The Major, the\r\nmilitary commandant of the Palace, was placed under the immediate control\r\nof the Questors.[2] At nightfall the gratings and the doors were secured,\r\nsentinels were posted, instructions were issued to the sentries, and the\r\nPalace was closed like a fortress. The password was the same as in the\r\nPlace de Paris.\r\n\r\nThe special instructions drawn up by the Questors prohibited the entrance\r\nof any armed force other than the regiment on duty.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 1st and 2d of December the Legislative Palace was\r\nguarded by a battalion of the 42d.\r\n\r\nThe sitting of the 1st of December, which was exceedingly peaceable,\r\nand had been devoted to a discussion on the municipal law, had finished\r\nlate, and was terminated by a Tribunal vote. At the moment when M.\r\nBaze, one of the Questors, ascended the Tribune to deposit his vote, a\r\nRepresentative, belonging to what was called \"Les Bancs Elyséens\"\r\napproached him, and said in a low tone, \"To-night you will be carried\r\noff.\" Such warnings as these were received every day, and, as we have\r\nalready explained, people had ended by paying no heed to them.\r\nNevertheless, immediately after the sitting the Questors sent for the\r\nSpecial Commissary of Police of the Assembly, President Dupin being\r\npresent. When interrogated, the Commissary declared that the reports of\r\nhis agents indicated \"dead calm\"--such was his expression--and that\r\nassuredly there was no danger to be apprehended for that night. When\r\nthe Questors pressed him further, President Dupin, exclaiming \"Bah!\"\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nOn that same day, the 1st December, about three o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nas General Leflô's father-in-law crossed the boulevard in front of\r\nTortoni's, some one rapidly passed by him and whispered in his ear these\r\nsignificant words, \"Eleven o'clock--midnight.\" This incident excited but\r\nlittle attention at the Questure, and several even laughed at it. It had\r\nbecome customary with them. Nevertheless General Leflô would not go to\r\nbed until the hour mentioned had passed by, and remained in the Offices\r\nof the Questure until nearly one o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe shorthand department of the Assembly was done out of doors by four\r\nmessengers attached to the _Moniteur_, who were employed to carry the\r\ncopy of the shorthand writers to the printing-office, and to bring back\r\nthe proof-sheets to the Palace of the Assembly, where M. Hippolyte Prévost\r\ncorrected them. M. Hippolyte Prévost was chief of the stenographic staff,\r\nand in that capacity had apartments in the Legislative Palace. He was at\r\nthe same time editor of the musical _feuilleton_ of the _Moniteur_. On\r\nthe 1st December he had gone to the Opéra Comique for the first\r\nrepresentation of a new piece, and did not return till after midnight.\r\nThe fourth messenger from the _Moniteur_ was waiting for him with a proof\r\nof the last slip of the sitting; M. Prévost corrected the proof, and the\r\nmessenger was sent off. It was then a little after one o'clock, profound\r\nquiet reigned around, and, with the exception of the guard, all in the\r\nPalace slept. Towards this hour of the night, a singular incident\r\noccurred. The Captain-Adjutant-Major of the Guard of the Assembly came to\r\nthe Major and said, \"The Colonel has sent for me,\" and he added according\r\nto military etiquette, \"Will you permit me to go?\" The Commandant was\r\nastonished. \"Go,\" he said with some sharpness, \"but the Colonel is wrong\r\nto disturb an officer on duty.\" One of the soldiers on guard, without\r\nunderstanding the meaning of the words, heard the Commandant pacing up\r\nand down, and muttering several times, \"What the deuce can he want?\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards the Adjutant-Major returned. \"Well,\" asked the\r\nCommandant, \"what did the Colonel want with you?\" \"Nothing,\" answered the\r\nAdjutant, \"he wished to give me the orders for to-morrow's duties.\" The\r\nnight became further advanced. Towards four o'clock the Adjutant-Major\r\ncame again to the Major. \"Major,\" he said, \"the Colonel has asked for\r\nme.\" \"Again!\" exclaimed the Commandant. \"This is becoming strange;\r\nnevertheless, go.\"\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant-Major had amongst other duties that of giving out the\r\ninstructions to the sentries, and consequently had the power of\r\nrescinding them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Adjutant-Major had gone out, the Major, becoming uneasy,\r\nthought that it was his duty to communicate with the Military Commandant\r\nof the Palace. He went upstairs to the apartment of the Commandant--\r\nLieutenant Colonel Niols. Colonel Niols had gone to bed and the attendants\r\nhad retired to their rooms in the attics. The Major, new to the Palace,\r\ngroped about the corridors, and, knowing little about the various rooms,\r\nrang at a door which seemed to him that of the Military Commandant. Nobody\r\nanswered, the door was not opened, and the Major returned downstairs,\r\nwithout having been able to speak to anybody.\r\n\r\nOn his part the Adjutant-Major re-entered the Palace, but the Major did\r\nnot see him again. The Adjutant remained near the grated door of the\r\nPlace Bourgogne, shrouded in his cloak, and walking up and down the\r\ncourtyard as though expecting some one.\r\n\r\nAt the instant that five o'clock sounded from the great clock of the\r\ndome, the soldiers who slept in the hut-camp before the Invalides were\r\nsuddenly awakened. Orders were given in a low voice in the huts to take\r\nup arms, in silence. Shortly afterwards two regiments, knapsack on back\r\nwere marching upon the Palace of the Assembly; they were the 6th and the\r\n42d.\r\n\r\nAt this same stroke of five, simultaneously in all the quarters of Paris,\r\ninfantry soldiers filed out noiselessly from every barrack, with their\r\ncolonels at their head. The _aides-de-camp_ and orderly officers of Louis\r\nBonaparte, who had been distributed in all the barracks, superintended\r\nthis taking up of arms. The cavalry were not set in motion until\r\nthree-quarters of an hour after the infantry, for fear that the ring of\r\nthe horses' hoofs on the stones should wake slumbering Paris too soon.\r\n\r\nM. de Persigny, who had brought from the Elysée to the camp of the\r\nInvalides the order to take up arms, marched at the head of the 42d, by\r\nthe side of Colonel Espinasse. A story is current in the army, for at the\r\npresent day, wearied as people are with dishonorable incidents, these\r\noccurrences are yet told with a species of gloomy indifference--the story\r\nis current that at the moment of setting out with his regiment one of the\r\ncolonels who could be named hesitated, and that the emissary from the\r\nElysée, taking a sealed packet from his pocket, said to him, \"Colonel, I\r\nadmit that we are running a great risk. Here in this envelope, which I\r\nhave been charged to hand to you, are a hundred thousand francs in\r\nbanknotes _for contingencies_.\" The envelope was accepted, and the\r\nregiment set out. On the evening of the 2d of December the colonel said\r\nto a lady, \"This morning I earned a hundred thousand francs and my\r\nGeneral's epaulets.\" The lady showed him the door.\r\n\r\nXavier Durrieu, who tells us this story, had the curiosity later on to\r\nsee this lady. She confirmed the story. Yes, certainly! she had shut the\r\ndoor in the face of this wretch; a soldier, a traitor to his flag who\r\ndared visit her! She receive such a man? No! she could not do that,\r\n\"and,\" states Xavier Durrieu, she added, \"And yet I have no character to\r\nlose.\"\r\n\r\nAnother mystery was in progress at the Prefecture of Police.\r\n\r\nThose belated inhabitants of the Cité who may have returned home at a\r\nlate hour of the night might have noticed a large number of street cabs\r\nloitering in scattered groups at different points round about the Rue de\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nFrom eleven o'clock in the evening, under pretext of the arrivals of\r\nrefugees at Paris from Genoa and London, the Brigade of Surety and the\r\neight hundred _sergents de ville_ had been retained in the Prefecture. At\r\nthree o'clock in the morning a summons had been sent to the forty-eight\r\nCommissaries of Paris and of the suburbs, and also to the peace officers.\r\nAn hour afterwards all of them arrived. They were ushered into a separate\r\nchamber, and isolated from each other as much as possible. At five\r\no'clock a bell was sounded in the Prefect's cabinet. The Prefect Maupas\r\ncalled the Commissaries of Police one after another into his cabinet,\r\nrevealed the plot to them, and allotted to each his portion of the crime.\r\nNone refused; many thanked him.\r\n\r\nIt was a question of arresting at their own homes seventy-eight Democrats\r\nwho were influential in their districts, and dreaded by the Elysée as\r\npossible chieftains of barricades. It was necessary, a still more daring\r\noutrage, to arrest at their houses sixteen Representatives of the People.\r\nFor this last task were chosen among the Commissaries of Police such of\r\nthose magistrates who seemed the most likely to become ruffians. Amongst\r\nthese were divided the Representatives. Each had his man. Sieur Courtille\r\nhad Charras, Sieur Desgranges had Nadaud, Sieur Hubaut the elder had M.\r\nThiers, and Sieur Hubaut the younger General Bedeau, General Changarnier\r\nwas allotted to Lerat, and General Cavaignac to Colin. Sieur Dourlens\r\ntook Representative Valentin, Sieur Benoist Representative Miot, Sieur\r\nAllard Representative Cholat, Sieur Barlet took Roger (Du Nord), General\r\nLamoricière fell to Commissary Blanchet, Commissary Gronfier had\r\nRepresentative Greppo, and Commissary Boudrot Representative Lagrange.\r\nThe Questors were similarly allotted, Monsieur Baze to the Sieur\r\nPrimorin, and General Leflô to Sieur Bertoglio.\r\n\r\nWarrants with the name of the Representatives had been drawn up in the\r\nPrefect's private Cabinet. Blanks had been only left for the names of the\r\nCommissaries. These were filled in at the moment of leaving.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the armed force which was appointed to assist them, it had\r\nbeen decided that each Commissary should be accompanied by two escorts,\r\none composed of _sergents de ville_, the other of police agents in plain\r\nclothes. As Prefect Maupas had told M. Bonaparte, the Captain of the\r\nRepublican Guard, Baudinet, was associated with Commissary Lerat in the\r\narrest of General Changarnier.\r\n\r\nTowards half-past five the _fiacres_ which were in waiting were called\r\nup, and all started, each with his instructions.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, in another corner of Paris--the old Rue du Temple--in\r\nthat ancient Soubise Mansion which had been transformed into a Royal\r\nPrinting Office, and is to-day a National Printing Office, another\r\nsection of the Crime was being organized.\r\n\r\nTowards one in the morning a passer-by who had reached the old Rue du\r\nTemple by the Rue de Vieilles-Haudriettes, noticed at the junction of\r\nthese two streets several long and high windows brilliantly lighted up,\r\nThese were the windows of the work-rooms of the National Printing Office.\r\nHe turned to the right and entered the old Rue du Temple, and a moment\r\nafterwards paused before the crescent-shaped entrance of the front of the\r\nprinting-office. The principal door was shut, two sentinels guarded the\r\nside door. Through this little door, which was ajar, he glanced into the\r\ncourtyard of the printing-office, and saw it filled with soldiers. The\r\nsoldiers were silent, no sound could be heard, but the glistening of\r\ntheir bayonets could be seen. The passer-by surprised, drew nearer. One\r\nof the sentinels thrust him rudely back, crying out, \"Be off.\"\r\n\r\nLike the _sergents de ville_ at the Prefecture of Police, the workmen had\r\nbeen retained at the National Printing Office under plea of night-work.\r\nAt the same time that M. Hippolyte Prévost returned to the Legislative\r\nPalace, the manager of the National Printing Office re-entered his\r\noffice, also returning from the Opéra Comique, where he had been to see\r\nthe new piece, which was by his brother, M. de St. Georges. Immediately\r\non his return the manager, to whom had come an order from the Elysée\r\nduring the day, took up a pair of pocket pistols, and went down into the\r\nvestibule, which communicates by means of a few steps with the courtyard.\r\nShortly afterwards the door leading to the street opened, a _fiacre_\r\nentered, a man who carried a large portfolio alighted. The manager went\r\nup to the man, and said to him, \"Is that you, Monsieur de Béville?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the man.\r\n\r\nThe _fiacre_ was put up, the horses placed in a stable, and the coachman\r\nshut up in a parlor, where they gave him drink, and placed a purse in his\r\nhand. Bottles of wine and louis d'or form the groundwork of this hind of\r\npolitics. The coachman drank and then went to sleep. The door of the\r\nparlor was bolted.\r\n\r\nThe large door of the courtyard of the printing-office was hardly shut\r\nthan it reopened, gave passage to armed men, who entered in silence, and\r\nthen reclosed. The arrivals were a company of the Gendarmerie Mobile, the\r\nfourth of the first battalion, commanded by a captain named La Roche\r\nd'Oisy. As may be remarked by the result, for all delicate expeditions\r\nthe men of the _coup d'état_ took care to employ the Gendarmerie Mobile\r\nand the Republican Guard, that it is to say the two corps almost entirely\r\ncomposed of former Municipal Guards, bearing at heart a revengeful\r\nremembrance of the events of February.\r\n\r\nCaptain La Roche d'Oisy brought a letter from the Minister of War, which\r\nplaced himself and his soldiers at the disposition of the manager of the\r\nNational Printing Office. The muskets were loaded without a word being\r\nspoken. Sentinels were placed in the workrooms, in the corridors, at the\r\ndoors, at the windows, in fact, everywhere, two being stationed at the\r\ndoor leading into the street. The captain asked what instructions he\r\nshould give to the sentries. \"Nothing more simple,\" said the man who had\r\ncome in the _fiacre_. \"Whoever attempts to leave or to open a window,\r\nshoot him.\"\r\n\r\nThis man, who, in fact, was De Béville, orderly officer to M. Bonaparte,\r\nwithdrew with the manager into the large cabinet on the first story, a\r\nsolitary room which looked out on the garden. There he communicated to\r\nthe manager what he had brought with him, the decree of the dissolution\r\nof the Assembly, the appeal to the Army, the appeal to the People, the\r\ndecree convoking the electors, and in addition, the proclamation of the\r\nPrefect Maupas and his letter to the Commissaries of Police. The four\r\nfirst documents were entirely in the handwriting of the President, and\r\nhere and there some erasures might be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe compositors were in waiting. Each man was placed between two\r\ngendarmes, and was forbidden to utter a single word, and then the\r\ndocuments which had to be printed were distributed throughout the room,\r\nbeing cut up in very small pieces, so that an entire sentence could not\r\nbe read by one workman. The manager announced that he would give them an\r\nhour to compose the whole. The different fragments were finally brought\r\nto Colonel Béville, who put them together and corrected the proof sheets.\r\nThe machining was conducted with the same precautions, each press being\r\nbetween two soldiers. Notwithstanding all possible diligence the work\r\nlasted two hours. The gendarmes watched over the workmen. Béville watched\r\nover St. Georges.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was finished a suspicious incident occurred, which greatly\r\nresembled a treason within a treason. To a traitor a greater traitor.\r\nThis species of crime is subject to such accidents. Béville and St.\r\nGeorges, the two trusty confidants in whose hands lay the secret of the\r\n_coup d'état_, that is to say the head of the President;--that secret,\r\nwhich ought at no price to be allowed to transpire before the appointed\r\nhour, under risk of causing everything to miscarry, took it into their\r\nheads to confide it at once to two hundred men, in order \"to test the\r\neffect,\" as the ex-Colonel Béville said later on, rather naïvely. They\r\nread the mysterious document which had just been printed to the Gendarmes\r\nMobiles, who were drawn up in the courtyard. These ex-municipal guards\r\napplauded. If they had hooted, it might be asked what the two\r\nexperimentalists in the _coup d'état_ would have done. Perhaps M.\r\nBonaparte would have waked up from his dream at Vincennes.\r\n\r\nThe coachman was then liberated, the _fiacre_ was horsed, and at four\r\no'clock in the morning the orderly officer and the manager of the\r\nNational Printing Office, henceforward two criminals, arrived at the\r\nPrefecture of Police with the parcels of the decrees. Then began for\r\nthem the brand of shame. Prefect Maupas took them by the hand.\r\n\r\nBands of bill-stickers, bribed for the occasion, started in every\r\ndirection, carrying with them the decrees and proclamations.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely the hour at which the Palace of the National Assembly\r\nwas invested. In the Rue de l'Université there is a door of the Palace\r\nwhich is the old entrance to the Palais Bourbon, and which opened into\r\nthe avenue which leads to the house of the President of the Assembly.\r\nThis door, termed the Presidency door, was according to custom guarded by\r\na sentry. For some time past the Adjutant-Major, who had been twice sent\r\nfor during the night by Colonel Espinasse, had remained motionless and\r\nsilent, close by the sentinel. Five minutes after, having left the huts\r\nof the Invalides, the 42d Regiment of the line, followed at some distance\r\nby the 6th Regiment, which had marched by the Rue de Bourgogne, emerged\r\nfrom the Rue de l'Université. \"The regiment,\" says an eye-witness,\r\n\"marched as one steps in a sickroom.\" It arrived with a stealthy step\r\nbefore the Presidency door. This ambuscade came to surprise the law.\r\n\r\nThe sentry, seeing these soldiers arrive, halted, but at the moment when\r\nhe was going to challenge them with a _qui-vive_, the Adjutant-Major\r\nseized his arm, and, in his capacity as the officer empowered to\r\ncountermand all instructions, ordered him to give free passage to the\r\n42d, and at the same time commanded the amazed porter to open the door.\r\nThe door turned upon its hinges, the soldiers spread themselves through\r\nthe avenue. Persigny entered and said, \"It is done.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly was invaded.\r\n\r\nAt the noise of the footsteps the Commandant Mennier ran up.\r\n\"Commandant,\" Colonel Espinasse cried out to him, \"I come to relieve your\r\nbattalion.\" The Commandant turned pale for a moment, and his eyes\r\nremained fixed on the ground. Then suddenly he put his hands to his\r\nshoulders, and tore off his epaulets, he drew his sword, broke it across\r\nhis knee, threw the two fragments on the pavement, and, trembling with\r\nrage, exclaimed with a solemn voice, \"Colonel, you disgrace the number of\r\nyour regiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right,\" said Espinasse.\r\n\r\nThe Presidency door was left open, but all the other entrances remained\r\nclosed. All the guards were relieved, all the sentinels changed, and the\r\nbattalion of the night guard was sent back to the camp of the Invalides,\r\nthe soldiers piled their arms in the avenue, and in the Cour d'Honneur.\r\nThe 42d, in profound silence, occupied the doors outside and inside, the\r\ncourtyard, the reception-rooms, the galleries, the corridors, the\r\npassages, while every one slept in the Palace.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards arrived two of those little chariots which are called\r\n\"forty sons,\" and two _fiacres_, escorted by two detachments of the\r\nRepublican Guard and of the Chasseurs de Vincennes, and by several squads\r\nof police. The Commissaries Bertoglio and Primorin alighted from the two\r\nchariots.\r\n\r\nAs these carriages drove up a personage, bald, but still young, was seen\r\nto appear at the grated door of the Place de Bourgogne. This personage\r\nhad all the air of a man about town, who had just come from the opera,\r\nand, in fact, he had come from thence, after having passed through a den.\r\nHe came from the Elysée. It was De Morny. For an instant he watched the\r\nsoldiers piling their arms, and then went on to the Presidency door.\r\nThere he exchanged a few words with M. de Persigny. A quarter of an hour\r\nafterwards, accompanied by 250 Chasseurs de Vincennes, he took possession\r\nof the ministry of the Interior, startled M. de Thorigny in his bed, and\r\nhanded him brusquely a letter of thanks from Monsieur Bonaparte. Some\r\ndays previously honest M. De Thorigny, whose ingenuous remarks we have\r\nalready cited, said to a group of men near whom M. de Morny was passing,\r\n\"How these men of the Mountain calumniate the President! The man who\r\nwould break his oath, who would achieve a _coup d'état_ must necessarily\r\nbe a worthless wretch.\" Awakened rudely in the middle of the night, and\r\nrelieved of his post as Minister like the sentinels of the Assembly, the\r\nworthy man, astounded, and rubbing his eyes, muttered, \"Eh! then the\r\nPresident _is_ a ----.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Morny, with a burst of laughter.\r\n\r\nHe who writes these lines knew Morny. Morny and Walewsky held in the\r\nquasi-reigning family the positions, one of Royal bastard, the other of\r\nImperial bastard. Who was Morny? We will say, \"A noted wit, an intriguer,\r\nbut in no way austere, a friend of Romieu, and a supporter of Guizot\r\npossessing the manners of the world, and the habits of the roulette\r\ntable, self-satisfied, clever, combining a certain liberality of ideas\r\nwith a readiness to accept useful crimes, finding means to wear a\r\ngracious smile with bad teeth, leading a life of pleasure, dissipated but\r\nreserved, ugly, good-tempered, fierce, well-dressed, intrepid, willingly\r\nleaving a brother prisoner under bolts and bars, and ready to risk his\r\nhead for a brother Emperor, having the same mother as Louis Bonaparte,\r\nand like Louis Bonaparte, having some father or other, being able to call\r\nhimself Beauharnais, being able to call himself Flahaut, and yet calling\r\nhimself Morny, pursuing literature as far as light comedy, and politics,\r\nas far as tragedy, a deadly free liver, possessing all the frivolity\r\nconsistent with assassination, capable of being sketched by Marivaux and\r\ntreated of by Tacitus, without conscience, irreproachably elegant,\r\ninfamous, and amiable, at need a perfect duke. Such was this malefactor.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not yet six o'clock in the morning. Troops began to mass\r\nthemselves on the Place de la Concorde, where Leroy-Saint-Arnaud on\r\nhorseback held a review.\r\n\r\nThe Commissaries of Police, Bertoglio and Primorin ranged two companies\r\nin order under the vault of the great staircase of the Questure, but did\r\nnot ascend that way. They were accompanied by agents of police, who knew\r\nthe most secret recesses of the Palais Bourbon, and who conducted them\r\nthrough various passages.\r\n\r\nGeneral Leflô was lodged in the Pavilion inhabited in the time of the Duc\r\nde Bourbon by Monsieur Feuchères. That night General Leflô had staying\r\nwith him his sister and her husband, who were visiting Paris, and who\r\nslept in a room, the door of which led into one of the corridors of the\r\nPalace. Commissary Bertoglio knocked at the door, opened it, and together\r\nwith his agents abruptly burst into the room, where a woman was in bed.\r\nThe general's brother-in-out sprang out of bed, and cried out to the\r\nQuestor, who slept in an adjoining room, \"Adolphe, the doors are being\r\nforced, the Palace is full of soldiers. Get up!\"\r\n\r\nThe General opened his eyes, he saw Commissary Bertoglio standing beside\r\nhis bed.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" said the Commissary, \"I have come to fulfil a duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said General Leflô, \"you are a traitor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissary stammering out the words, \"Plot against the safety of the\r\nState,\" displayed a warrant. The General, without pronouncing a word,\r\nstruck this infamous paper with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\nThen dressing himself, he put on his full uniform of Constantine and of\r\nMédéah, thinking in his imaginative, soldier-like loyalty that there were\r\nstill generals of Africa for the soldiers whom he would find on his way.\r\nAll the generals now remaining were brigands. His wife embraced him; his\r\nson, a child of seven years, in his nightshirt, and in tears, said to the\r\nCommissary of Police, \"Mercy, Monsieur Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\nThe General, while clasping his wife in his arms, whispered in her ear,\r\n\"There is artillery in the courtyard, try and fire a cannon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissary and his men led him away. He regarded these policemen with\r\ncontempt, and did not speak to them, but when he recognized Colonel\r\nEspinasse, his military and Breton heart swelled with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Espinasse,\" said he, \"you are a villain, and I hope to live long\r\nenough to tear the buttons from your uniform.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Espinasse hung his head, and stammered, \"I do not know you.\"\r\n\r\nA major waved his sword, and cried, \"We have had enough of lawyer\r\ngenerals.\" Some soldiers crossed their bayonets before the unarmed\r\nprisoner, three _sergents de ville_ pushed him into a _fiacre_, and a\r\nsub-lieutenant approaching the carriage, and looking in the face of the\r\nman who, if he were a citizen, was his Representative, and if he were a\r\nsoldier was his general, flung this abominable word at him, \"Canaille!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Commissary Primorin had gone by a more roundabout way in order\r\nthe more surely to surprise the other Questor, M. Baze.\r\n\r\nOut of M. Baze's apartment a door led to the lobby communicating with the\r\nchamber of the Assembly. Sieur Primorin knocked at the door. \"Who is\r\nthere?\" asked a servant, who was dressing. \"The Commissary of Police,\"\r\nreplied Primorin. The servant, thinking that he was the Commissary of\r\nPolice of the Assembly, opened the door.\r\n\r\nAt this moment M. Baze, who had heard the noise, and had just awakened,\r\nput on a dressing-gown, and cried, \"Do not open the door.\"\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken these words when a man in plain clothes and three\r\n_sergents de ville_ in uniform rushed into his chamber. The man, opening\r\nhis coat, displayed his scarf of office, asking M. Baze, \"Do you\r\nrecognize this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a worthless wretch,\" answered the Questor.\r\n\r\nThe police agents laid their hands on M. Baze. \"You will not take me\r\naway,\" he said. \"You, a Commissary of Police, you, who are a magistrate,\r\nand know what you are doing, you outrage the National Assembly, you\r\nviolate the law, you are a criminal!\" A hand-to-hand struggle\r\nensued--four against one. Madame Baze and her two little girls giving\r\nvent to screams, the servant being thrust back with blows by the\r\n_sergents de ville_. \"You are ruffians,\" cried out Monsieur Baze. They\r\ncarried him away by main force in their arms, still struggling, naked,\r\nhis dressing-gown being torn to shreds, his body being covered with\r\nblows, his wrist torn and bleeding.\r\n\r\nThe stairs, the landing, the courtyard, were full of soldiers with fixed\r\nbayonets and grounded arms. The Questor spoke to them. \"Your\r\nRepresentatives are being arrested, you have not received your arms to\r\nbreak the laws!\" A sergeant was wearing a brand-new cross. \"Have you been\r\ngiven the cross for this?\" The sergeant answered, \"We only know one\r\nmaster.\" \"I note your number,\" continued M. Baze. \"You are a dishonored\r\nregiment.\" The soldiers listened with a stolid air, and seemed still\r\nasleep. Commissary Primorin said to them, \"Do not answer, this has\r\nnothing to do with you.\" They led the Questor across the courtyard to the\r\nguard-house at the Porte Noire.\r\n\r\nThis was the name which was given to a little door contrived under the\r\nvault opposite the treasury of the Assembly, and which opened upon the\r\nRue de Bourgogne, facing the Rue de Lille.\r\n\r\nSeveral sentries were placed at the door of the guard-house, and at the\r\ntop of the flight of steps which led thither, M. Baze being left there in\r\ncharge of three _sergents de ville_. Several soldiers, without their\r\nweapons, and in their shirt-sleeves, came in and out. The Questor\r\nappealed to them in the name of military honor. \"Do not answer,\" said the\r\n_sergent de ville_ to the soldiers.\r\n\r\nM. Baze's two little girls had followed him with terrified eyes, and when\r\nthey lost sight of him the youngest burst into tears. \"Sister,\" said the\r\nelder, who was seven years old, \"let us say our prayers,\" and the two\r\nchildren, clasping their hands, knelt down.\r\n\r\nCommissary Primorin, with his swarm of agents, burst into the Questor's\r\nstudy, and laid hands on everything. The first papers which he perceived\r\non the middle of the table, and which he seized, were the famous decrees\r\nwhich had been prepared in the event of the Assembly having voted the\r\nproposal of the Questors. All the drawers were opened and searched. This\r\noverhauling of M. Baze's papers, which the Commissary of Police termed a\r\ndomiciliary visit, lasted more than an hour.\r\n\r\nM. Baze's clothes had been taken to him, and he had dressed. When the\r\n\"domiciliary visit\" was over, he was taken out of the guard-house. There\r\nwas a _fiacre_ in the courtyard, into which he entered, together with the\r\nthree _sergents de ville_. The vehicle, in order to reach the Presidency\r\ndoor, passed by the Cour d'Honneur and then by the Courde Canonis. Day\r\nwas breaking. M. Baze looked into the courtyard to see if the cannon were\r\nstill there. He saw the ammunition wagons ranged in order with their\r\nshafts raised, but the places of the six cannon and the two mortars were\r\nvacant.\r\n\r\nIn the avenue of the Presidency the _fiacre_ stopped for a moment. Two\r\nlines of soldiers, standing at ease, lined the footpaths of the avenue.\r\nAt the foot of a tree were grouped three men: Colonel Espinasse, whom M.\r\nBaze knew and recognized, a species of Lieutenant-Colonel, who wore a\r\nblack and orange ribbon round his neck, and a Major of Lancers, all three\r\nsword in hand, consulting together. The windows of the _fiacre_ were\r\nclosed; M. Baze wished to lower them to appeal to these men; the\r\n_sergents de ville_ seized his arms. The Commissary Primorin then came\r\nup, and was about to re-enter the little chariot for two persons which\r\nhad brought him.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Baze,\" said he, with that villainous kind of courtesy which the\r\nagents of the _coup d'état_ willingly blended with their crime, \"you must\r\nbe uncomfortable with those three men in the _fiacre_. You are cramped;\r\ncome in with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone,\" said the prisoner. \"With these three men I am cramped;\r\nwith you I should be contaminated.\"\r\n\r\nAn escort of infantry was ranged on both sides of the _fiacre_. Colonel\r\nEspinasse called to the coachman, \"Drive slowly by the Quai d'Orsay until\r\nyou meet a cavalry escort. When the cavalry shall have assumed the\r\ncharge, the infantry can come back.\" They set out.\r\n\r\nAs the _fiacre_ turned into the Quai d'Orsay a picket of the 7th Lancers\r\narrived at full speed. It was the escort: the troopers surrounded the\r\n_fiacre_, and the whole galloped off.\r\n\r\nNo incident occurred during the journey. Here and there, at the noise of\r\nthe horses' hoofs, windows were opened and heads put forth; and the\r\nprisoner, who had at length succeeded in lowering a window heard startled\r\nvoices saying, \"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nThe _fiacre_ stopped. \"Where are we?\" asked M. Baze.\r\n\r\n\"At Mazas,\" said a _sergent de ville_.\r\n\r\nThe Questor was taken to the office of the prison. Just as he entered he\r\nsaw Baune and Nadaud being brought out. There was a table in the centre,\r\nat which Commissary Primorin, who had followed the _fiacre_ in his\r\nchariot, had just seated himself. While the Commissary was writing, M.\r\nBaze noticed on the table a paper which was evidently a jail register, on\r\nwhich were these names, written in the following order: Lamoricière,\r\nCharras, Cavaignac, Changarnier, Leflô, Thiers, Bedeau, Roger (du Nord),\r\nChambolle. This was probably the order in which the Representatives had\r\narrived at the prison.\r\n\r\nWhen Sieur Primorin had finished writing, M. Baze said, \"Now, you will be\r\ngood enough to receive my protest, and add it to your official report.\"\r\n\"It is not an official report,\" objected the Commissary, \"it is simply an\r\norder for committal.\" \"I intend to write my protest at once,\" replied M.\r\nBaze. \"You will have plenty of time in your cell,\" remarked a man who\r\nstood by the table. M. Baze turned round. \"Who are you?\" \"I am the\r\ngovernor of the prison,\" said the man. \"In that case,\" replied M. Baze,\r\n\"I pity you, for you are aware of the crime you are committing.\" The man\r\nturned pale, and stammered a few unintelligible words.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary rose from his seat; M. Baze briskly took possession of his\r\nchair, seated himself at the table, and said to Sieur Primorin, \"You are\r\na public officer; I request you to add my protest to your official\r\nreport.\" \"Very well,\" said the Commissary, \"let it be so.\" Baze wrote the\r\nprotest as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"I, the undersigned, Jean-Didier Baze, Representative of the People,\r\n  and Questor of the National Assembly, carried off by violence from my\r\n  residence in the Palace of the National Assembly, and conducted to this\r\n  prison by an armed force which it was impossible for me to resist,\r\n  protest in the name of the National Assembly and in my own name against\r\n  the outrage on national representation committed upon my colleagues and\r\n  upon myself.\r\n\r\n  \"Given at Mazas on the 2d December 1851, at eight o'clock in the\r\n  morning.\r\n\r\n  \"BAZE.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this was taking place at Mazas, the soldiers were laughing and\r\ndrinking in the courtyard of the Assembly. They made their coffee in the\r\nsaucepans. They had lighted enormous fires in the courtyard; the flames,\r\nfanned by the wind, at times reached the walls of the Chamber. A\r\nsuperior official of the Questure, an officer of the National Guard,\r\nRamond de la Croisette, ventured to say to them, \"You will set the\r\nPalace on fire;\" whereupon a soldier struck him a blow with his fist.\r\n\r\nFour of the pieces taken from the Cour de Canons were ranged in battery\r\norder against the Assembly; two on the Place de Bourgogne were pointed\r\ntowards the grating, and two on the Pont de la Concorde were pointed\r\ntowards the grand staircase.\r\n\r\nAs side-note to this instructive tale let us mention a curious fact. The\r\n42d Regiment of the line was the same which had arrested Louis\r\nBonaparte at Boulogne. In 1840 this regiment lent its aid to the law\r\nagainst the conspirator. In 1851 it lent its aid to the conspirator\r\nagainst the law: such is the beauty of passive obedience.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] The Questors were officers elected by the Assembly, whose special\r\nduties were to keep and audit the accounts, and who controlled all\r\nmatters affecting the social economy of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER DOINGS OF THE NIGHT\r\n\r\nDuring the same night in all parts of Paris acts of brigandage took\r\nplace. Unknown men leading armed troops, and themselves armed with\r\nhatchets, mallets, pincers, crow-bars, life-preservers, swords hidden\r\nunder their coats, pistols, of which the butts could be distinguished\r\nunder the folds of their cloaks, arrived in silence before a house,\r\noccupied the street, encircled the approaches, picked the lock of the\r\ndoor, tied up the porter, invaded the stairs, and burst through the doors\r\nupon a sleeping man, and when that man, awakening with a start, asked of\r\nthese bandits, \"Who are you?\" their leader answered, \"A Commissary of\r\nPolice.\" So it happened to Lamoricière who was seized by Blanchet, who\r\nthreatened him with the gag; to Greppo, who was brutally treated and\r\nthrown down by Gronfier, assisted by six men carrying a dark lantern and\r\na pole-axe; to Cavaignac, who was secured by Colin, a smooth-tongued\r\nvillain, who affected to be shocked on hearing him curse and swear; to M.\r\nThiers, who was arrested by Hubaut (the elder); who professed that he had\r\nseen him \"tremble and weep,\" thus adding falsehood to crime; to Valentin,\r\nwho was assailed in his bed by Dourlens, taken by the feet and shoulders,\r\nand thrust into a padlocked police van; to Miot, destined to the tortures\r\nof African casemates; to Roger (du Nord), who with courageous and witty\r\nirony offered sherry to the bandits. Charras and Changarnier were taken\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nThey lived in the Rue St. Honoré, nearly opposite to each other,\r\nChangarnier at No. 3, Charras at No. 14. Ever since the 9th of September\r\nChangarnier had dismissed the fifteen men armed to the teeth by whom he\r\nhad hitherto been guarded during the night, and on the 1st December, as\r\nwe have said, Charras had unloaded his pistols. These empty pistols were\r\nlying on the table when they came to arrest him. The Commissary of Police\r\nthrew himself upon them. \"Idiot,\" said Charras to him, \"if they had been\r\nloaded, you would have been a dead man.\" These pistols, we may note, had\r\nbeen given to Charras upon the taking of Mascara by General Renaud, who\r\nat the moment of Charras' arrest was on horseback in the street helping\r\nto carry out the _coup d'état_. If these pistols had remained loaded, and\r\nif General Renaud had had the task of arresting Charras, it would have\r\nbeen curious if Renaud's pistols had killed Renaud. Charras assuredly\r\nwould not have hesitated. We have already mentioned the names of these\r\npolice rascals. It is useless to repeat them. It was Courtille who\r\narrested Charras, Lerat who arrested Changarnier, Desgranges who arrested\r\nNadaud. The men thus seized in their own houses were Representatives of\r\nthe people; they were inviolable, so that to the crime of the violation\r\nof their persons was added this high treason, the violation of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of impudence in the perpetration of these outrages. The\r\npolice agents made merry. Some of these droll fellows jested. At Mazas\r\nthe under-jailors jeered at Thiers, Nadaud reprimanded them severely. The\r\nSieur Hubaut (the younger) awoke General Bedeau. \"General, you are a\r\nprisoner.\"--\"My person is inviolable.\"--\"Unless you are caught red-handed,\r\nin the very act.\"--\"Well,\" said Bedeau, \"I am caught in the act, the\r\nheinous act of being asleep.\" They took him by the collar and dragged him\r\nto a _fiacre_.\r\n\r\nOn meeting together at Mazas, Nadaud grasped the hand of Greppo, and\r\nLagrange grasped the hand of Lamoricière. This made the police gentry\r\nlaugh. A colonel, named Thirion, wearing a commander's cross round his\r\nneck, helped to put the Generals and the Representatives into jail. \"Look\r\nme in the face,\" said Charras to him. Thirion moved away.\r\n\r\nThus, without counting other arrests which took place later on, there\r\nwere imprisoned during the night of the 2d of December, sixteen\r\nRepresentatives and seventy-eight citizens. The two agents of the crime\r\nfurnished a report of it to Louis Bonaparte. Morny wrote \"Boxed up;\"\r\nMaupas wrote \"Quadded.\" The one in drawing-room slang, the other in the\r\nslang of the galleys. Subtle gradations of language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARKNESS OF THE CRIME\r\n\r\nVersigny had just left me.\r\n\r\nWhile I dressed hastily there came in a man in whom I had every\r\nconfidence. He was a poor cabinet-maker out of work, named Girard, to\r\nwhom I had given shelter in a room of my house, a carver of wood, and\r\nnot illiterate. He came in from the street; he was trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"what do the people say?\"\r\n\r\nGirard answered me,--\r\n\r\n\"People are dazed. The blow has been struck in such a manner that it\r\nis not realized. Workmen read the placards, say nothing, and go to\r\ntheir work. Only one in a hundred speaks. It is to say, 'Good!' This\r\nis how it appears to them. The law of the 31st May is abrogated--'Well\r\ndone!' Universal suffrage is re-established--'Also well done!' The\r\nreactionary majority has been driven away--'Admirable!' Thiers is\r\narrested--'Capital!' Changarnier is seized--'Bravo!' Round each placard\r\nthere are _claqueurs_. Ratapoil explains his _coup d'état_ to Jacques\r\nBonhomme, Jacques Bonhomme takes it all in. Briefly, it is my impression\r\nthat the people give their consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be so,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asked Girard of me, \"what will you do, Monsieur Victor Hugo?\"\r\n\r\nI took my scarf of office from a cupboard, and showed it to him.\r\n\r\nHe understood.\r\n\r\nWe shook hands.\r\n\r\nAs he went out Carini entered.\r\n\r\nColonel Carini is an intrepid man. He had commanded the cavalry under\r\nMieroslawsky in the Sicilian insurrection. He has, in a few moving and\r\nenthusiastic pages, told the story of that noble revolt. Carini is one of\r\nthose Italians who love France as we Frenchmen love Italy. Every\r\nwarm-hearted man in this century has two fatherlands--the Rome of\r\nyesterday and the Paris of to-day.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" said Carini to me, \"you are still free,\" and he added, \"The\r\nblow has been struck in a formidable manner. The Assembly is invested. I\r\nhave come from thence. The Place de la Révolution, the Quays, the\r\nTuileries, the boulevards, are crowded with troops. The soldiers have\r\ntheir knapsacks. The batteries are harnessed. If fighting takes place it\r\nwill be desperate work.\"\r\n\r\nI answered him, \"There will be fighting.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I added, laughing, \"You have proved that the colonels write like\r\npoets; now it is the turn of the poets to fight like colonels.\"\r\n\r\nI entered my wife's room; she knew nothing, and was quietly reading her\r\npaper in bed.\r\n\r\nI had taken about me five hundred francs in gold. I put on my wife's bed\r\na box containing nine hundred francs, all the money which remained to me,\r\nand I told her what had happened.\r\n\r\nShe turned pale, and said to me, \"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"My duty.\"\r\n\r\nShe embraced me, and only said two words:--\r\n\r\n\"Do it.\"\r\n\r\nMy breakfast was ready. I ate a cutlet in two mouthfuls. As I finished,\r\nmy daughter came in. She was startled by the manner in which I kissed\r\nher, and asked me, \"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mother will explain to you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I left them.\r\n\r\nThe Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne was as quiet and deserted as usual. Four\r\nworkmen were, however, chatting near my door; they wished me \"Good\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nI cried out to them, \"You know what is going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said they.\r\n\r\n\"Well. It is treason! Louis Bonaparte is strangling the Republic. The\r\npeople are attacked. The people must defend themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will defend themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You promise me that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" they answered.\r\n\r\nOne of them added, \"We swear it.\"\r\n\r\nThey kept their word. Barricades were constructed in my street (Rue de la\r\nTour d'Auvergne), in the Rue des Martyrs, in the Cité Rodier, in the Rue\r\nCoquenard, and at Notre-Dame de Lorette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PLACARDS\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving these brave men I could read at the corner of the Rue de la\r\nTour d'Auvergne and the Rue des Martyrs, the three infamous placards\r\nwhich had been posted on the walls of Paris during the night.\r\n\r\nHere they are.\r\n\r\n  \"PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n  \"_Appeal to the People_.\r\n\r\n  \"FRENCHMEN! The present situation can last no longer. Every day which\r\n  passes enhances the dangers of the country. The Assembly, which ought\r\n  to be the firmest support of order, has become a focus of conspiracies.\r\n  The patriotism of three hundred of its members has been unable to check\r\n  its fatal tendencies. Instead of making laws in the public interest it\r\n  forges arms for civil war; it attacks the power which I hold directly\r\n  from the People, it encourages all bad passions, it compromises the\r\n  tranquillity of France; I have dissolved it, and I constitute the whole\r\n  People a judge between it and me.\r\n\r\n  \"The Constitution, as you know, was constructed with the object of\r\n  weakening beforehand the power which you were about to confide to me.\r\n  Six millions of votes formed an emphatic protest against it, and yet\r\n  I have faithfully respected it. Provocations, calumnies, outrages,\r\n  have found me unmoved. Now, however, that the fundamental compact is\r\n  no longer respected by those very men who incessantly invoke it, and\r\n  that the men who have ruined two monarchies wish to tie my hands in\r\n  order to overthrow the Republic, my duty is to frustrate their\r\n  treacherous schemes, to maintain the Republic, and to save the Country\r\n  by appealing to the solemn judgment of the only Sovereign whom I\r\n  recognize in France--the People.\r\n\r\n  \"I therefore make a loyal appeal to the whole nation, and I say to\r\n  you: If you wish to continue this condition of uneasiness which\r\n  degrades us and compromises our future, choose another in my place,\r\n  for I will no longer retain a power which is impotent to do good,\r\n  which renders me responsible for actions which I cannot prevent, and\r\n  which binds me to the helm when I see the vessel driving towards the\r\n  abyss.\r\n\r\n  \"If on the other hand you still place confidence in me, give me the\r\n  means of accomplishing the great mission which I hold from you.\r\n\r\n  \"This mission consists in closing the era of revolutions, by satisfying\r\n  the legitimate needs of the People, and by protecting them from\r\n  subversive passions. It consists, above all, in creating institutions\r\n  which survive men, and which shall in fact form the foundations on\r\n  which something durable may be established.\r\n\r\n  \"Persuaded that the instability of power, that the preponderance of a\r\n  single Assembly, are the permanent causes of trouble and discord, I\r\n  submit to your suffrage the following fundamental bases of a\r\n  Constitution which will be developed by the Assemblies later on:--\r\n\r\n  \"1. A responsible Chief appointed for ten years.\r\n\r\n  \"2. Ministers dependent upon the Executive Power alone.\r\n\r\n  \"3. A Council of State composed of the most distinguished men, who shall\r\n  prepare laws and shall support them in debate before the Legislative\r\n  Body.\r\n\r\n  \"4. A Legislative Body which shall discuss and vote the laws, and which\r\n  shall be elected by universal suffrage, without _scrutin de liste_,\r\n  which falsifies the elections.\r\n\r\n  \"5. A Second Assembly composed of the most illustrious men of the\r\n  country, a power of equipoise the guardian of the fundamental compact,\r\n  and of the public liberties.\r\n\r\n  \"This system, created by the first Consul at the beginning of the\r\n  century, has already given repose and prosperity to France; it would\r\n  still insure them to her.\r\n\r\n  \"Such is my firm conviction. If you share it, declare it by your votes.\r\n  If, on the contrary, you prefer a government without strength,\r\n  Monarchical or Republican, borrowed I know not from what past, or from\r\n  what chimerical future, answer in the negative.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus for the first time since 1804, you will vote with a full knowledge\r\n  of the circumstances, knowing exactly for whom and for what.\r\n\r\n  \"If I do not obtain the majority of your suffrages I shall call together\r\n  a New Assembly and shall place in its hands the commission which I have\r\n  received from you.\r\n\r\n  \"But if you believe that the cause of which my name is the symbol,--that\r\n  is to say, France regenerated by the Revolution of '89, and organized by\r\n  the Emperor, is to be still your own, proclaim it by sanctioning the\r\n  powers which I ask from you.\r\n\r\n  \"Then France and Europe will be preserved from anarchy, obstacles will\r\n  be removed, rivalries will have disappeared, for all will respect, in\r\n  the decision of the People, the decree of Providence.\r\n\r\n  \"Given at the Palace of the Elysée, 2d December, 1851.\r\n\r\n  \"LOUIS NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n  \"Soldiers!

It is a deserted alley\r\nin that new quarter which separates the Rue des Martyrs from the Rue\r\nBlanche. I found it, however. As I reached No. 4, Yvan came out of the\r\ngateway and said, \"I am here to warn you. The police have an eye upon\r\nthis house, Michel is waiting for you at No. 70, Rue Blanche, a few\r\nsteps from here.\"\r\n\r\nI knew No. 70, Rue Blanche. Manin, the celebrated President of the\r\nVenetian Republic, lived there. It was not in his rooms, however, that\r\nthe meeting was to take place.\r\n\r\nThe porter of No. 70 told me to go up to the first floor. The door was\r\nopened, and a handsome, gray-haired woman of some forty summers, the\r\nBaroness Coppens, whom I recognized as having seen in society and at my\r\nown house, ushered me into a drawing-room.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges and Alexander Rey were there, the latter an\r\nex-Constituent, an eloquent writer, a brave man. At that time Alexander\r\nRey edited the _National_.\r\n\r\nWe shook hands.\r\n\r\nMichel said to me,--\r\n\r\n\"Hugo, what will you do?\"\r\n\r\nI answered him,--\r\n\r\n\"Everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That also is my opinion,\" said he.\r\n\r\nNumerous representatives arrived, and amongst others Pierre Lefranc,\r\nLabrousse, Théodore Bac, Noël Parfait, Arnauld (de l'Ariége), Demosthenes\r\nOllivier, an ex-Constituent, and Charamaule. There was deep and\r\nunutterable indignation, but no useless words were spoken.\r\n\r\nAll were imbued with that manly anger whence issue great resolutions.\r\n\r\nThey talked. They set forth the situation. Each brought forward the news\r\nwhich he had learnt.\r\n\r\nThéodore Bac came from Léon Faucher, who lived in the Rue Blanche. It\r\nwas he who had awakened Léon Faucher, and had announced the news to him.\r\nThe first words of Léon Faucher were, \"It is an infamous deed.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment Charamaule displayed a courage which, during\r\nthe four days of the struggle, never flagged for a single instant.\r\nCharamaule is a very tall man, possessed of vigorous features and\r\nconvincing eloquence; he voted with the Left, but sat with the Right.\r\nIn the Assembly he was the neighbor of Montalembert and of Riancey.\r\nHe sometimes had warm disputes with them, which we watched from afar\r\noff, and which amused us.\r\n\r\nCharamaule had come to the meeting at No. 70 dressed in a sort of blue\r\ncloth military cloak, and armed, as we found out later on.\r\n\r\nThe situation was grave; sixteen Representatives arrested, all the\r\ngenerals of the Assembly, and he who was more than a general, Charras.\r\nAll the journals suppressed, all the printing offices occupied by\r\nsoldiers. On the side of Bonaparte an army of 80,000 men which could be\r\ndoubled in a few hours; on our side nothing. The people deceived, and\r\nmoreover disarmed. The telegraph at their command. All the walls covered\r\nwith their placards, and at our disposal not a single printing case, not\r\none sheet of paper. No means of raising the protest, no means of\r\nbeginning the combat. The _coup d'état_ was clad with mail, the Republic\r\nwas naked; the _coup d'état_ had a speaking trumpet, the Republic wore a\r\ngag.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nThe raid against the Republic, against the Assembly, against Right,\r\nagainst Law, against Progress, against Civilization, was commanded by\r\nAfrican generals. These heroes had just proved that they were cowards.\r\nThey had taken their precautions well. Fear alone can engender so much\r\nskill. They had arrested all the men of war of the Assembly, and all the\r\nmen of action of the Left, Baune, Charles Lagrange, Miot, Valentin,\r\nNadaud, Cholat. Add to this that all the possible chiefs of the\r\nbarricades were in prison. The organizers of the ambuscade had carefully\r\nleft at liberty Jules Favre, Michel de Bourges, and myself, judging us\r\nto be less men of action than of the Tribune; wishing to leave the Left\r\nmen capable of resistance, but incapable of victory, hoping to dishonor\r\nus if we did not fight, and to shoot us if we did fight.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, no one hesitated. The deliberation began. Other\r\nrepresentatives arrived every minute, Edgar Quinet, Doutre, Pelletier,\r\nCassal, Bruckner, Baudin, Chauffour. The room was full, some were\r\nseated, most were standing, in confusion, but without tumult.\r\n\r\nI was the first to speak.\r\n\r\nI said that the struggle ought to be begun at once. Blow for blow.\r\n\r\nThat it was my opinion that the hundred and fifty Representatives of the\r\nLeft should put on their scarves of office, should march in procession\r\nthrough the streets and the boulevards as far as the Madeleine, and\r\ncrying \"Vive la République! Vive la Constitution!\" should appear before\r\nthe troops, and alone, calm and unarmed, should summon Might to obey\r\nRight. If the soldiers yielded, they should go to the Assembly and make\r\nan end of Louis Bonaparte. If the soldiers fired upon their legislators,\r\nthey should disperse throughout Paris, cry \"To Arms,\" and resort to\r\nbarricades. Resistance should be begun constitutionally, and if that\r\nfailed, should be continued revolutionarily. There was no time to be\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\"High treason,\" said I, \"should be seized red-handed, is a great mistake\r\nto suffer such an outrage to be accepted by the hours as they elapse.\r\nEach minute which passes is an accomplice, and endorses the crime.\r\nBeware of that calamity called an 'Accomplished fact.' To arms!\"\r\n\r\nMany warmly supported this advice, among others Edgar Quinet, Pelletier,\r\nand Doutre.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges seriously\r\nobjected. My instinct was to begin at once, his advice was to wait and\r\nsee. According to him there was danger in hastening the catastrophe. The\r\n_coup d'état_ was organized, and the People were not. They had been\r\ntaken unawares. We must not indulge in illusion. The masses could not\r\nstir yet. Perfect calm reigned in the faubourgs; Surprise existed, yes;\r\nAnger, no. The people of Paris, although so intelligent, did not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nMichel added, \"We are not in 1830. Charles X., in turning out the 221,\r\nexposed himself to this blow, the re-election of the 221. We are not in\r\nthe same situation. The 221 were popular. The present Assembly is not: a\r\nChamber which has been insultingly dissolved is always sure to conquer,\r\nif the People support it. Thus the People rose in 1830. To-day they\r\nwait. They are dupes until they shall be victims.\" Michel de Bourges\r\nconcluded, \"The People must be given time to understand, to grow angry,\r\nto rise. As for us, Representative, we should be rash to precipitate the\r\nsituation. If we were to march immediately straight upon the troops, we\r\nshould only be shot to no purpose, and the glorious insurrection for\r\nRight would thus be beforehand deprived of its natural leaders--the\r\nRepresentatives of the People. We should decapitate the popular army.\r\nTemporary delay, on the contrary, would be beneficial. Too much zeal\r\nmust be guarded against, self-restraint is necessary, to give way would\r\nbe to lose the battle before having begun it. Thus, for example, we must\r\nnot attend the meeting announced by the Right for noon, all those who\r\nwent there would be arrested. We must remain free, we must remain in\r\nreadiness, we must remain calm, and must act waiting the advent of the\r\nPeople. Four days of this agitation without fighting would weary the\r\narmy.\" Michel, however, advised a beginning, but simply by placarding\r\nArticle 68 of the Constitution. But where should a printer be found?\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges spoke with an experience of revolutionary procedure\r\nwhich was wanting in me. For many years past he had acquired a certain\r\npractical knowledge of the masses. His council was wise. It must be\r\nadded that all the information which came to us seconded him, and\r\nappeared conclusive against me. Paris was dejected.\r\n\r\nThe army of the _coup d'état_ invaded her peaceably. Even the placards\r\nwere not torn down. Nearly all the Representatives present, even the\r\nmost daring, agreed with Michel's counsel, to wait and see what would\r\nhappen. \"At night,\" said they, \"the agitation will begin,\" and they\r\nconcluded, like Michel de Bourges, that the people must be given time\r\nto understand. There would be a risk of being alone in too hasty a\r\nbeginning. We should not carry the people with us in the first moment.\r\nLet us leave the indignation to increase little by little in their\r\nhearts. If it were begun prematurely our manifestation would miscarry.\r\nThese were the sentiments of all. For myself, while listening to them, I\r\nfelt shaken. Perhaps they were right. It would be a mistake to give the\r\nsignal for the combat in vain. What good is the lightning which is not\r\nfollowed by the thunderbolt?\r\n\r\nTo raise a voice, to give vent to a cry, to find a printer, there was\r\nthe first question. But was there still a free Press?\r\n\r\nThe brave old ex-chief of the 6th Legion, Colonel Forestier, came in. He\r\ntook Michel de Bourges and myself aside.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said he to us. \"I come to you. I have been dismissed. I no\r\nlonger command my legion, but appoint me in the name of the Left,\r\nColonel of the 6th. Sign me an order and I will go at once and call them\r\nto arms. In an hour the regiment will be on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Colonel,\" answered I, \"I will do more than sign an order, I will\r\naccompany you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I turned towards Charamaule, who had a carriage in waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Come with us,\" said I.\r\n\r\nForestier was sure of two majors of the 6th. We decided to drive to them\r\nat once, while Michel and the other Representatives should await us at\r\nBonvalet's, in the Boulevard du Temple, near the Café Turc. There they\r\ncould consult together.\r\n\r\nWe started.\r\n\r\nWe traversed Paris, where people were already beginning to swarm in a\r\nthreatening manner. The boulevards were thronged with an uneasy crowd.\r\nPeople walked to and fro, passers-by accosted each other without any\r\nprevious acquaintance, a noteworthy sign of public anxiety; and groups\r\ntalked in loud voices at the corners of the streets. The shops were\r\nbeing shut.\r\n\r\n\"Come, this looks better,\" cried Charamaule.\r\n\r\nHe had been wandering about the town since the morning, and he had\r\nnoticed with sadness the apathy of the masses.\r\n\r\nWe found the two majors at home upon whom Colonel Forestier counted.\r\nThey were two rich linendrapers, who received us with some\r\nembarrassment. The shopmen had gathered together at the windows, and\r\nwatched us pass by. It was mere curiosity.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile one of the two majors countermanded a journey which he\r\nwas going to undertake on that day, and promised us his co-operation.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" added he, \"do not deceive yourselves, one can foresee that we\r\nshall be cut to pieces. Few men will march out.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Forestier said to us, \"Watrin, the present colonel of the 6th,\r\ndoes not care for fighting; perhaps he will resign me the command\r\namicably. I will go and find him alone, so as to startle him the less,\r\nand will join you at Bonvalet's.\"\r\n\r\nNear the Porte St. Martin we left our carriage, and Charamaule and\r\nmyself proceeded along the boulevard on foot, in order to observe the\r\ngroups more closely, and more easily to judge the aspect of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe recent levelling of the road had converted the boulevard of the\r\nPorte St. Martin into a deep cutting, commanded by two embankments. On\r\nthe summits of these embankments were the footways, furnished with\r\nrailings. The carriages drove along the cutting, the foot passengers\r\nwalked along the footways.\r\n\r\nJust as we reached the boulevard, a long column of infantry filed into\r\nthis ravine with drummers at their head. The thick waves of bayonets\r\nfilled the square of St. Martin, and lost themselves in the depths of\r\nthe Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle.\r\n\r\nAn enormous and compact crowd covered the two pavements of the Boulevard\r\nSt. Martin. Large numbers of workmen, in their blouses, were there,\r\nleaning upon the railings.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the head of the column entered the defile before the\r\nTheatre of the Porte St. Martin a tremendous shout of \"Vive la\r\nRépublique!\" came forth from every mouth as though shouted by one man.\r\nThe soldiers continued to advance in silence, but it might have been\r\nsaid that their pace slackened, and many of them regarded the crowd with\r\nan air of indecision. What did this cry of \"Vive la République!\" mean?\r\nWas it a token of applause? Was it a shout of defiance?\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me at that moment that the Republic raised its brow, and\r\nthat the _coup d'état_ hung its head.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charamaule said to me, \"You are recognized.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, near the Château d'Eau the crowd surrounded me. Some young men\r\ncried out, \"Vive Victor Hugo!\" One of them asked me, \"Citizen Victor\r\nHugo, what ought we to do?\"\r\n\r\nI answered, \"Tear down the seditious placards of the _coup d'état_, and\r\ncry 'Vive la Constitution!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose they fire on us?\" said a young workman.\r\n\r\n\"You will hasten to arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\nI added, \"Louis Bonaparte is a rebel, he has steeped himself to-day in\r\nevery crime. We, Representatives of the People, declare him an outlaw,\r\nbut there is no need for our declaration, since he is an outlaw by the\r\nmere fact of his treason. Citizens, you have two hands; take in one your\r\nRight, and in the other your gun and fall upon Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! Bravo!\" again shouted the people.\r\n\r\nA tradesman who was shutting up his shop said to me, \"Don't speak so\r\nloud, if they heard you talking like that, they would shoot you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" I replied, \"you would parade my body, and my death would\r\nbe a boon if the justice of God could result from it.\"\r\n\r\nAll shouted \"Long live Victor Hugo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shout 'Long live the Constitution,'\" said I.\r\n\r\nA great cry of \"Vive la Constitution! Vive la République;\" came forth\r\nfrom every breast.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm, indignation, anger flashed in the faces of all. I thought\r\nthen, and I still think, that this, perhaps, was the supreme moment. I\r\nwas tempted to carry off all that crowd, and to begin the battle.\r\n\r\nCharamaule restrained me. He whispered to me,--\r\n\r\n\"You will bring about a useless fusillade. Every one is unarmed. The\r\ninfantry is only two paces from us, and see, here comes the artillery.\"\r\n\r\nI looked round; in truth several pieces of cannon emerged at a quick\r\ntrot from the Rue de Bondy, behind the Château d'Eau.\r\n\r\nThe advice to abstain, given by Charamaule, made a deep impression on\r\nme. Coming from such a man, and one so dauntless, it was certainly not\r\nto be distrusted. Besides, I felt myself bound by the deliberation which\r\nhad just taken place at the meeting in the Rue Blanche.\r\n\r\nI shrank before the responsibility which I should have incurred. To have\r\ntaken advantage of such a moment might have been victory, it might also\r\nhave been a massacre. Was I right? Was I wrong?\r\n\r\nThe crowd thickened around us, and it became difficult to go forward. We\r\nwere anxious, however, to reach the _rendezvous_ at Bonvalet's.\r\n\r\nSuddenly some one touched me on the arm. It was Léopold Duras, of the\r\n_National_.\r\n\r\n\"Go no further,\" he whispered, \"the Restaurant Bonvalet is surrounded.\r\nMichel de Bourges has attempted to harangue the People, but the soldiers\r\ncame up. He barely succeeded in making his escape. Numerous\r\nRepresentatives who came to the meeting have been arrested. Retrace your\r\nsteps. We are returning to the old _rendezvous_ in the Rue Blanche. I\r\nhave been looking for you to tell you this.\"\r\n\r\nA cab was passing; Charamaule hailed the driver. We jumped in, followed\r\nby the crowd, shouting, \"Vive la République! Vive Victor Hugo!\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that just at that moment a squadron of _sergents de ville_\r\narrived on the Boulevard to arrest me. The coachman drove off at full\r\nspeed. A quarter of an hour afterwards we reached the Rue Blanche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"VIOLATION OF THE CHAMBER\"\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock in the morning the Pont de la Concorde was still free.\r\nThe large grated gate of the Palace of the Assembly was closed; through\r\nthe bars might be seen the flight of steps, that flight of steps whence\r\nthe Republic had been proclaimed on the 4th May, 1848, covered with\r\nsoldiers; and their piled arms might be distinguished upon the platform\r\nbehind those high columns, which, during the time of the Constituent\r\nAssembly, after the 15th of May and the 23d June, masked small mountain\r\nmortars, loaded and pointed.\r\n\r\nA porter with a red collar, wearing the livery of the Assembly, stood by\r\nthe little door of the grated gate. From time to time Representatives\r\narrived. The porter said, \"Gentlemen, are you Representatives?\" and\r\nopened the door. Sometimes he asked their names.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin's quarters could be entered without hindrance. In the great\r\ngallery, in the dining-room, in the _salon d'honneur_ of the Presidency,\r\nliveried attendants silently opened the doors as usual.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight, immediately after the arrest of the Questors MM. Baze\r\nand Leflô, M. de Panat, the only Questor who remained free, having been\r\nspared or disdained as a Legitimist, awoke M. Dupin and begged him to\r\nsummon immediately the Representatives from their own homes. M. Dupin\r\nreturned this unprecedented answer, \"I do not see any urgency.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time as M. Panat, the Representative Jerôme Bonaparte\r\nhad hastened thither. He had summoned M. Dupin to place himself at the\r\nhead of the Assembly. M. Dupin had answered, \"I cannot, I am guarded.\"\r\nJerôme Bonaparte burst out laughing. In fact, no one had deigned to\r\nplace a sentinel at M. Dupin's door; they knew that it was guarded by\r\nhis meanness.\r\n\r\nIt was only later on, towards noon, that they took pity on him. They\r\nfelt that the contempt was too great, and allotted him two sentinels.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven, fifteen or twenty Representatives, among whom were\r\nMM. Eugène Sue, Joret, de Rességuier, and de Talhouet, met together in\r\nM. Dupin's room. They also had vainly argued with M. Dupin. In the\r\nrecess of a window a clever member of the Majority, M. Desmousseaux de\r\nGivré, who was a little deaf and exceedingly exasperated, almost\r\nquarrelled with a Representative of the Right like himself whom he\r\nwrongly supposed to be favorable to the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin, apart from the group of Representatives, alone dressed in\r\nblack, his hands behind his back, his head sunk on his breast, walked up\r\nand down before the fire-place, where a large fire was burning. In his\r\nown room, and in his very presence, they were talking loudly about\r\nhimself, yet he seemed not to hear.\r\n\r\nTwo members of the Left came in, Benoît (du Rhône), and Crestin. Crestin\r\nentered the room, went straight up to M. Dupin, and said to him,\r\n\"President, you know what is going on? How is it that the Assembly has\r\nnot yet been convened?\"\r\n\r\nM. Dupin halted, and answered, with a shrug which was habitual with him,--\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to be done.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he resumed his walk.\r\n\r\n\"It is enough,\" said M. de Rességuier.\r\n\r\n\"It is too much,\" said Eugène Sue.\r\n\r\nAll the Representatives left the room.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Pont de la Concorde became covered with troops.\r\nAmong them General Vast-Vimeux, lean, old, and little; his lank white\r\nhair plastered over his temples, in full uniform, with his laced hat on\r\nhis head. He was laden with two huge epaulets, and displayed his scarf,\r\nnot that of a Representative, but of a general, which scarf, being too\r\nlong, trailed on the ground. He crossed the bridge on foot, shouting to\r\nthe soldiers inarticulate cries of enthusiasm for the Empire and the\r\n_coup d'état_. Such figures as these were seen in 1814. Only instead of\r\nwearing a large tri-colored, cockade, they wore a large white cockade.\r\nIn the main the same phenomenon; old men crying, \"Long live the Past!\"\r\nAlmost at the same moment M. de Larochejaquelein crossed the Place de la\r\nConcorde, surrounded by a hundred men in blouses, who followed him in\r\nsilence, and with an air of curiosity. Numerous regiments of cavalry\r\nwere drawn up in the grand avenue of the Champs Elysées.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock a formidable force invested the Legislative Palace.\r\nAll the approaches were guarded, all the doors were shut. Some\r\nRepresentatives nevertheless succeeded in penetrating into the interior\r\nof the Palace, not, as has been wrongly stated, by the passage of the\r\nPresident's house on the side of the Esplanade of the Invalides, but by\r\nthe little door of the Rue de Bourgogne, called the Black Door. This\r\ndoor, by what omission or what connivance I do not know, remained open\r\ntill noon on the 2d December. The Rue de Bourgogne was nevertheless full\r\nof troops. Squads of soldiers scattered here and there in the Rue de\r\nl'Université allowed passers-by, who were few and far between, to use it\r\nas a thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives who entered by the door in Rue de Bourgogne,\r\npenetrated as far as the Salle des Conférences, where they met their\r\ncolleagues coming out from M. Dupin.\r\n\r\nA numerous group of men, representing every shade of opinion in the\r\nAssembly, was speedily assembled in this hall, amongst whom were MM.\r\nEugène Sue, Richardet, Fayolle, Joret, Marc Dufraisse, Benoît (du\r\nRhône), Canet, Gambon, d'Adelsward, Créqu, Répellin, Teillard-Latérisse,\r\nRantion, General Leydet, Paulin Durrieu, Chanay, Brilliez, Collas (de la\r\nGironde), Monet, Gaston, Favreau, and Albert de Rességuier.\r\n\r\nEach new-comer accosted M. de Panat.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the vice-Presidents?\"\r\n\r\n\"In prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the two other Questors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Also in prison. And I beg you to believe, gentlemen,\" added M. de\r\nPanat, \"that I have had nothing to do with the insult which has been\r\noffered me, in not arresting me.\"\r\n\r\nIndignation was at its height; every political shade was blended in the\r\nsame sentiment of contempt and anger, and M. de Rességuier was no less\r\nenergetic than Eugène Sue. For the first time the Assembly seemed only\r\nto have one heart and one voice. Each at length said what he thought of\r\nthe man of the Elysée, and it was then seen that for a long time past\r\nLouis Bonaparte had imperceptibly created a profound unanimity in the\r\nAssembly--the unanimity of contempt.\r\n\r\nM. Collas (of the Gironde) gesticulated and told his story. He came from\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior. He had seen M. de Morny, he had spoken to\r\nhim; and he, M. Collas, was incensed beyond measure at M. Bonaparte's\r\ncrime. Since then, that Crime has made him Councillor of State.\r\n\r\nM. de Panat went hither and thither among the groups, announcing to the\r\nRepresentatives that he had convened the Assembly for one o'clock. But it\r\nwas impossible to wait until that hour. Time pressed. At the Palais\r\nBourbon, as in the Rue Blanche, it was the universal feeling that each\r\nhour which passed by helped to accomplish the _coup d'état_. Every one\r\nfelt as a reproach the weight of his silence or of his inaction; the\r\ncircle of iron was closing in, the tide of soldiers rose unceasingly,\r\nand silently invaded the Palace; at each instant a sentinel the more was\r\nfound at a door, which a moment before had been free. Still, the group of\r\nRepresentatives assembled together in the Salle des Conférences was as\r\nyet respected. It was necessary to act, to speak, to deliberate, to\r\nstruggle, and not to lose a minute.\r\n\r\nGambon said, \"Let us try Dupin once more; he is our official man, we\r\nhave need of him.\" They went to look for him. They could not find him.\r\nHe was no longer there, he had disappeared, he was away, hidden,\r\ncrouching, cowering, concealed, he had vanished, he was buried. Where?\r\nNo one knew. Cowardice has unknown holes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a man entered the hall. A man who was a stranger to the Assembly,\r\nin uniform, wearing the epaulet of a superior officer and a sword by his\r\nside. He was a major of the 42d, who came to summon the Representatives\r\nto quit their own House. All, Royalists and Republicans alike, rushed\r\nupon him. Such was the expression of an indignant eye-witness. General\r\nLeydet addressed him in language such as leaves an impression on the\r\ncheek rather than on the ear.\r\n\r\n\"I do my duty, I fulfil my instructions,\" stammered the officer.\r\n\r\n\"You are an idiot, if you think you are doing your duty,\" cried Leydet\r\nto him, \"and you are a scoundrel if you know that you are committing a\r\ncrime. Your name? What do you call yourself? Give me your name.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer refused to give his name, and replied, \"So, gentlemen, you\r\nwill not withdraw?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go and obtain force.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and in actual fact went to obtain orders from the\r\nMinistry of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives waited in that kind of indescribable agitation which\r\nmight be called the Strangling of Right by Violence.\r\n\r\nIn a short time one of them who had gone out came back hastily, and warned\r\nthem that two companies of the _Gendarmerie Mobile_ were coming with\r\ntheir guns in their hands.\r\n\r\nMarc Dufraisse cried out, \"Let the outrage be thorough. Let the _coup\r\nd'état_ find us on our seats. Let us go to the Salle des Séances,\" he\r\nadded. \"Since things have come to such a pass, let us afford the genuine\r\nand living spectacle of an 18th Brumaire.\"\r\n\r\nThey all repaired to the Hall of Assembly. The passage was free. The\r\nSalle Casimir-Périer was not yet occupied by the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThey numbered about sixty. Several were girded with their scarves of\r\noffice. They entered the Hall meditatively.\r\n\r\nThere, M. de Rességuier, undoubtedly with a good purpose, and in order\r\nto form a more compact group, urged that they should all install\r\nthemselves on the Right side.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Marc Dufraisse, \"every one to his bench.\" They scattered\r\nthemselves about the Hall, each in his usual place.\r\n\r\nM. Monet, who sat on one of the lower benches of the Left Centre, held\r\nin his hand a copy of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes elapsed. No one spoke. It was the silence of expectation\r\nwhich precedes decisive deeds and final crises, and during which every\r\none seems respectfully to listen to the last instructions of his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the soldiers of the _Gendarmerie Mobile_, headed by a captain\r\nwith his sword drawn, appeared on the threshold. The Hall of Assembly\r\nwas violated. The Representatives rose from their seats simultaneously,\r\nshouting \"Vive la République!\"\r\n\r\nThe Representative Monet alone remained standing, and in a loud and\r\nindignant voice, which resounded through the empty hall like a trumpet,\r\nordered the soldiers to halt.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers halted, looking at the Representatives with a bewildered\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers as yet only blocked up the lobby of the Left, and had not\r\npassed beyond the Tribune.\r\n\r\nThen the Representative Monet read the Articles 36, 37, and 68 of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nArticles 36 and 37 established the inviolability of the\r\nRepresentatives. Article 68 deposed the President in the event of\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nThat moment was a solemn one. The soldiers listened in silence.\r\n\r\nThe Articles having been read, Representative d'Adelsward, who sat on\r\nthe first lower bench of the Left, and who was nearest to the soldiers,\r\nturned towards them and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, you see that the President of the Republic is a traitor, and\r\nwould make traitors of you. You violate the sacred precinct of rational\r\nRepresentation. In the name of the Constitution, in the name of the Law,\r\nwe order you to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Adelsward was speaking, the major commanding the _Gendarmerie\r\nMobile_ had entered.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I have orders to request you to retire, and, if\r\nyou do not withdraw of your own accord, to expel you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Orders to expel us!\" exclaimed Adelsward; and all the Representatives\r\nadded, \"Whose orders; Let us see the orders. Who signed the orders?\"\r\n\r\nThe major drew forth a paper and unfolded it. Scarcely had he unfolded\r\nit than he attempted to replace it in his pocket, but General Leydet\r\nthrew himself upon him and seized his arm. Several Representatives leant\r\nforward, and read the order for the expulsion of the Assembly, signed\r\n\"Fortoul, Minister of the Marine.\"\r\n\r\nMarc Dufraisse turned towards the _Gendarmes Mobiles_, and cried out to\r\nthem,--\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, your very presence here is an act of treason. Leave the\r\nHall!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers seemed undecided. Suddenly a second column emerged from the\r\ndoor on the right, and at a signal from the commander, the captain\r\nshouted,--\r\n\r\n\"Forward! Turn them all out!\"\r\n\r\nThen began an indescribable hand-to-hand fight between the gendarmes and\r\nthe legislators. The soldiers, with their guns in their hands, invaded\r\nthe benches of the Senate. Repellin, Chanay, Rantion, were forcibly torn\r\nfrom their seats. Two gendarmes rushed upon Marc Dufraisse, two upon\r\nGambon. A long struggle took place on the first bench of the Right, the\r\nsame place where MM. Odilon Barrot and Abbatucci were in the habit of\r\nsitting. Paulin Durrieu resisted violence by force, it needed three men\r\nto drag him from his bench. Monet was thrown down upon the benches of the\r\nCommissaries. They seized Adelsward by the throat, and thrust him outside\r\nthe Hall. Richardet, a feeble man, was thrown down and brutally treated.\r\nSome were pricked with the points of the bayonets; nearly all had their\r\nclothes torn.\r\n\r\nThe commander shouted to the soldiers, \"Rake them out.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that sixty Representatives of the People were taken by the\r\ncollar by the _coup d'état_, and driven from their seats. The manner in\r\nwhich the deed was executed completed the treason. The physical\r\nperformance was worthy of the moral performance.\r\n\r\nThe three last to come out were Fayolle, Teillard-Latérisse, and Paulin\r\nDurrieu.\r\n\r\nThey were allowed to pass by the great door of the Palace, and they\r\nfound themselves in the Place Bourgogne.\r\n\r\nThe Place Bourgogne was occupied by the 42d Regiment of the Line, under\r\nthe orders of Colonel Garderens.\r\n\r\nBetween the Palace and the statue of the Republic, which occupied the\r\ncentre of the square, a piece of artillery was pointed at the Assembly\r\nopposite the great door.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the cannon some Chasseurs de Vincennes were loading their\r\nguns and biting their cartridges.\r\n\r\nColonel Garderens was on horseback near a group of soldiers, which\r\nattracted the attention of the Representatives Teillard-Latérisse,\r\nFayolle, and Paulin Durrieu.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this group three men, who had been arrested, were\r\nstruggling crying, \"Long live the Constitution! Vive la République!\"\r\n\r\nFayolle, Paulin Durrieu, and Teillard-Latérisse approached, and\r\nrecognized in the three prisoners three members of the majority,\r\nRepresentatives Toupet-des-Vignes Radoubt, Lafosse, and Arbey.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Arbey was warmly protesting. As he raised his voice,\r\nColonel Garderens cut him short with these words, which are worthy of\r\npreservation,--\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue! One word more, and I will have you thrashed with the\r\nbutt-end of a musket.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Representatives of the Left indignantly called on the Colonel\r\nto release their colleagues.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel,\" said Fayolle, \"You break the law threefold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will break it sixfold,\" answered the Colonel, and he arrested\r\nFayolle, Durrieu, and Teillard-Latérisse.\r\n\r\nThe soldiery were ordered to conduct them to the guard house of the\r\nPalace then being built for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nOn the way the six prisoners, marching between a double file of bayonets,\r\nmet three of their colleagues Representatives Eugène Sue, Chanay, and\r\nBenoist (du Rhône).\r\n\r\nEugène Sue placed himself before the officer who commanded the detachment,\r\nand said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"We summon you to set our colleagues at liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot do so,\" answered the officer.\r\n\r\n\"In that case complete your crimes,\" said Eugène Sue, \"We summon you to\r\narrest us also.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer arrested them.\r\n\r\nThey were taken to the guard-house of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs,\r\nand, later on, to the barracks of the Quai d'Orsay. It was not till\r\nnight that two companies of the line came to transfer them to this\r\nultimate resting-place.\r\n\r\nWhile placing them between his soldiers the commanding officer bowed\r\ndown to the ground, politely remarking, \"Gentlemen, my men's guns are\r\nloaded.\"\r\n\r\nThe clearance of the hall was carried out, as we have said, in a\r\ndisorderly fashion, the soldiers pushing the Representatives before them\r\nthrough all the outlets.\r\n\r\nSome, and amongst the number those of whom we have just spoken, wens out\r\nby the Rue de Bourgogne, others were dragged through the Salle des Pas\r\nPerdus towards the grated door opposite the Pont de la Concorde.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Salle des Pas Perdus has an ante-chamber, a sort of crossway room,\r\nupon which opened the staircase of the High Tribune, and several doors,\r\namongst others the great glass door of the gallery which leads to the\r\napartments of the President of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had reached this crossway room which adjoins the little\r\nrotunda, where the side door of exit to the Palace is situated, the\r\nsoldiers set the Representatives free.\r\n\r\nThere, in a few moments, a group was formed, in which the\r\nRepresentatives Canet and Favreau began to speak. One universal cry was\r\nraised, \"Let us search for Dupin, let us drag him here if it is\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nThey opened the glass door and rushed into the gallery. This time M.\r\nDupin was at home. M. Dupin, having learnt that the gendarmes had\r\ncleared out the Hall, had come out of his hiding-place. The Assembly\r\nbeing thrown prostrate, Dupin stood erect. The law being made prisoner,\r\nthis man felt himself set free.\r\n\r\nThe group of Representatives, led by MM. Canet and Favreau, found him in\r\nhis study.\r\n\r\nThere a dialogue ensued. The Representatives summoned the President to\r\nput himself at their head, and to re-enter the Hall, he, the man of the\r\nAssembly, with them, the men of the Nation.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin refused point-blank, maintained his ground, was very firm, and\r\nclung bravely to his nonentity.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" said he, mingling with his alarmed protests\r\nmany law maxims and Latin quotations, an instinct of chattering jays,\r\nwho pour forth all their vocabulary when they are frightened. \"What do\r\nyou want me to do? Who am I? What can I do? I am nothing. No one is any\r\nlonger anything. _Ubi nihil, nihil_. Might is there. Where there is\r\nMight the people lose their Rights. _Novus nascitur ordo_. Shape your\r\ncourse accordingly. I am obliged to submit. _Dura lex, sed lex_. A law\r\nof necessity we admit, but not a law of right. But what is to be done? I\r\nask to be let alone. I can do nothing. I do what I can. I am not wanting\r\nin good will. If I had a corporal and four men, I would have them\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"This man only recognizes force,\" said the Representatives. \"Very well,\r\nlet us employ force.\"\r\n\r\nThey used violence towards him, they girded him with a scarf like a cord\r\nround his neck, and, as they had said, they dragged him towards the\r\nHall, begging for his \"liberty,\" moaning, kicking--I would say\r\nwrestling, if the word were not too exalted.\r\n\r\nSome minutes after the clearance, this Salle des Pas Perdus, which had\r\njust witnessed Representatives pass by in the clutch of gendarmes, saw\r\nM. Dupin in the clutch of the Representatives.\r\n\r\nThey did not get far. Soldiers barred the great green folding-doors.\r\nColonel Espinasse hurried thither, the commander of the gendarmerie came\r\nup. The butt-ends of a pair of pistols were seen peeping out of the\r\ncommander's pocket.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was pale, the commander was pale, M. Dupin was livid. Both\r\nsides were afraid. M. Dupin was afraid of the colonel; the colonel\r\nassuredly was not afraid of M. Dupin, but behind this laughable and\r\nmiserable figure he saw a terrible phantom rise up--his crime, and he\r\ntrembled. In Homer there is a scene where Nemesis appears behind\r\nThersites.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin remained for some moments stupefied, bewildered and speechless.\r\n\r\nThe Representative Gambon exclaimed to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Now then, speak, M. Dupin, the Left does not interrupt you.\"\r\n\r\nThen, with the words of the Representatives at his back, and the\r\nbayonets of the soldiers at his breast, the unhappy man spoke. What\r\nhis mouth uttered at this moment, what the President of the Sovereign\r\nAssembly of France stammered to the gendarmes at this intensely critical\r\nmoment, no one could gather.\r\n\r\nThose who heard the last gasps of this moribund cowardice, hastened\r\nto purify their ears. It appears, however, that he stuttered forth\r\nsomething like this:--\r\n\r\n\"You are Might, you have bayonets; I invoke Right and I leave you. I\r\nhave the honor to wish you good day.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away.\r\n\r\nThey let him go. At the moment of leaving he turned round and let fall a\r\nfew more words. We will not gather them up. History has no rag-picker's\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] This grated door was closed on December 2, and was not reopened\r\nuntil the 12th March, when M. Louis Bonaparte came to inspect the works\r\nof the Hall of the Corps Legislatif.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN END WORSE THAN DEATH\r\n\r\nWe should have been glad to have put aside, never to have spoken of him\r\nagain, this man who had borne for three years this most honorable title,\r\nPresident of the National Assembly of France, and who had only known how\r\nto be lacquey to the majority. He contrived in his last hour to sink\r\neven lower than could have been believed possible even for him. His\r\ncareer in the Assembly had been that of a valet, his end was that of a\r\nscullion.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedented attitude that M. Dupin assumed before the gendarmes\r\nwhen uttering with a grimace his mockery of a protest, even engendered\r\nsuspicion. Gambion exclaimed, \"He resists like an accomplice. He knew\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe these suspicions to be unjust. M. Dupin knew nothing. Who\r\nindeed amongst the organizers of the _coup d'état_ would have taken the\r\ntrouble to make sure of his joining them? Corrupt M. Dupin? was it\r\npossible? and, further, to what purpose? To pay him? Why? It would be\r\nmoney wasted when fear alone was enough. Some connivances are secured\r\nbefore they are sought for. Cowardice is the old fawner upon felony. The\r\nblood of the law is quickly wiped up. Behind the assassin who holds the\r\nponiard comes the trembling wretch who holds the sponge.\r\n\r\nDupin took refuge in his study. They followed him. \"My God!\" he cried,\r\n\"can't they understand that I want to be left in peace.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth they had tortured him ever since the morning, in order to\r\nextract from him an impossible scrap of courage.\r\n\r\n\"You ill-treat me worse than the gendarmes,\" said he.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives installed themselves in his study, seated themselves\r\nat his table, and, while he groaned and scolded in an arm-chair, they\r\ndrew up a formal report of what had just taken place, as they wished to\r\nleave an official record of the outrage in the archives.\r\n\r\nWhen the official report was ended Representative Canet read it to the\r\nPresident, and offered him a pen.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to do with this?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You are the President,\" answered Canet. \"This is our last sitting. It\r\nis your duty to sign the official report.\"\r\n\r\nThis man refused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK DOOR\r\n\r\nM. Dupin is a matchless disgrace.\r\n\r\nLater on he had his reward. It appears that he became some sort of an\r\nAttorney-General at the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin renders to Louis Bonaparte the service of being in his place\r\nthe meanest of men.\r\n\r\nTo continue this dismal history.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives of the Right, in their first bewilderment caused\r\nby the _coup d'état_, hastened in large numbers to M. Daru, who was\r\nVice-President of the Assembly, and at the same time one of the\r\nPresidents of the Pyramid Club. This Association had always supported\r\nthe policy of the Elysée, but without believing that a _coup d'état_\r\nwas premeditated. M. Daru lived at No. 75, Rue de Lille.\r\n\r\nTowards ten o'clock in the morning about a hundred of these\r\nRepresentatives had assembled at M. Daru's home. They resolved to\r\nattempt to penetrate into the Hall where the Assembly held its sittings.\r\nThe Rue de Lille opens out into the Rue de Bourgogne, almost opposite\r\nthe little door by which the Palace is entered, and which is called the\r\nBlack Door.\r\n\r\nThey turned their steps towards this door, with M. Daru at their head.\r\nThey marched arm in arm and three abreast. Some of them had put on their\r\nscarves of office. They took them off later on.\r\n\r\nThe Black Door, half-open as usual, was only guarded by two sentries.\r\n\r\nSome of the most indignant, and amongst them M. de Kerdrel, rushed\r\ntowards this door and tried to pass. The door, however, was violently\r\nshut, and there ensued between the Representatives and the _sergents de\r\nville_ who hastened up, a species of struggle, in which a Representative\r\nhad his wrist sprained.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a battalion which was drawn up on the Place de\r\nBourgogne moved on, and came at the double towards the group of\r\nRepresentatives. M. Daru, stately and firm, signed to the commander\r\nto stop; the battalion halted, and M. Daru, in the name of the\r\nConstitution, and in his capacity as Vice-President of the Assembly,\r\nsummoned the soldiers to lay down their arms, and to give free passage\r\nto the Representatives of the Sovereign People.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the battalion replied by an order to clear the street\r\nimmediately, declaring that there was no longer an Assembly; that as for\r\nhimself, he did not know what the Representatives of the People were,\r\nand that if those persons before him did not retire of their own accord,\r\nhe would drive them back by force.\r\n\r\n\"We will only yield to violence,\" said M. Daru.\r\n\r\n\"You commit high treason,\" added M. de Kerdrel.\r\n\r\nThe officer gave the order to charge.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers advanced in close order.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of confusion; almost a collision. The Representatives,\r\nforcibly driven back, ebbed into the Rue de Lille. Some of them fell\r\ndown. Several members of the Right were rolled in the mud by the\r\nsoldiers. One of them, M. Etienne, received a blow on the shoulder from\r\nthe butt-end of a musket. We may here add that a week afterwards M.\r\nEtienne was a member of that concern which they styled the Consultative\r\nCommittee. He found the _coup d'état_ to his taste, the blow with the\r\nbutt-end of a musket included.\r\n\r\nThey went back to M. Daru's house, and on the way the scattered group\r\nreunited, and was even strengthened by some new-comers.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said M. Daru, \"the President has failed us, the Hall is\r\nclosed against us. I am the Vice-President; my house is the Palace of\r\nthe Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened a large room, and there the Representatives of the Right\r\ninstalled themselves. At first the discussions were somewhat noisy. M.\r\nDaru, however, observed that the moments were precious, and silence was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThe first measure to be taken was evidently the deposition of the\r\nPresident of the Republic by virtue of Article 68 of the Constitution.\r\nSome Representatives of the party which was called _Burgraves_ sat round\r\na table and prepared the deed of deposition.\r\n\r\nAs they were about to read it aloud a Representative who came in from\r\nout of doors appeared at the door of the room, and announced to the\r\nAssembly that the Rue de Lille was becoming filled with troops, and that\r\nthe house was being surrounded.\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to lose.\r\n\r\nM. Benoist-d'Azy said, \"Gentlemen, let us go to the Mairie of the tenth\r\narrondissement; there we shall be able to deliberate under the protection\r\nof the tenth legion, of which our colleague, General Lauriston, is the\r\ncolonel.\"\r\n\r\nM. Daru's house had a back entrance by a little door which was at the\r\nbottom of the garden. Most of the Representatives went out that way.\r\n\r\nM. Daru was about to follow them. Only himself, M. Odilon Barrot, and\r\ntwo or three others remained in the room, when the door opened. A\r\ncaptain entered, and said to M. Daru,--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you are my prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where am I to follow you?\" asked M. Daru.\r\n\r\n\"I have orders to watch over you in your own house.\"\r\n\r\nThe house, in truth, was militarily occupied, and it was thus that M.\r\nDaru was prevented from taking part in the sitting at the Mairie of the\r\ntenth arrondissement.\r\n\r\nThe officer allowed M. Odilon Barrot to go out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nWhile all this was taking place on the left bank of the river, towards\r\nnoon a man was noticed walking up and down the great Salles des Pas\r\nPerdus of the Palace of Justice. This man, carefully buttoned up in an\r\novercoat, appeared to be attended at a distance by several possible\r\nsupporters--for certain police enterprises employ assistants whose\r\ndubious appearance renders the passers-by uneasy, so much so that they\r\nwonder whether they are magistrates or thieves. The man in the\r\nbuttoned-up overcoat loitered from door to door, from lobby to lobby,\r\nexchanging signs of intelligence with the myrmidons who followed him;\r\nthen came back to the great Hall, stopping on the way the barristers,\r\nsolicitors, ushers, clerks, and attendants, and repeating to all in a low\r\nvoice, so as not to be heard by the passers-by, the same question. To\r\nthis question some answered \"Yes,\" others replied \"No.\" And the man set\r\nto work again, prowling about the Palace of Justice with the appearance\r\nof a bloodhound seeking the trail.\r\n\r\nHe was a Commissary of the Arsenal Police.\r\n\r\nWhat was he looking for?\r\n\r\nThe High Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nWhat was the High Court of Justice doing?\r\n\r\nIt was hiding.\r\n\r\nWhy? To sit in Judgment?\r\n\r\nYes and no.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary of the Arsenal Police had that morning received from the\r\nPrefect Maupas the order to search everywhere for the place where the\r\nHigh Court of Justice might be sitting, if perchance it thought it its\r\nduty to meet. Confusing the High Court with the Council of State, the\r\nCommissary of Police had first gone to the Quai d'Orsay. Having found\r\nnothing, not even the Council of State, he had come away empty-handed, at\r\nall events had turned his steps towards the Palace of Justice, thinking\r\nthat as he had to search for justice he would perhaps find it there.\r\n\r\nNot finding it, he went away.\r\n\r\nThe High Court, however, had nevertheless met together.\r\n\r\nWhere, and how? We shall see.\r\n\r\nAt the period whose annals we are now chronicling, before the present\r\nreconstruction of the old buildings of Paris, when the Palace of Justice\r\nwas reached by the Cour de Harlay, a staircase the reverse of majestic\r\nled thither by turning out into a long corridor called the Gallerie\r\nMercière. Towards the middle of this corridor there were two doors; one\r\non the right, which led to the Court of Appeal, the other on the left,\r\nwhich led to the Court of Cassation. The folding-doors to the left opened\r\nupon an old gallery called St. Louis, recently restored, and which serves\r\nat the present time for a Salle des Pas Perdus to the barristers of the\r\nCourt of Cassation. A wooden statue of St. Louis stood opposite the\r\nentrance door. An entrance contrived in a niche to the right of this\r\nstatue led into a winding lobby ending in a sort of blind passage, which\r\napparently was closed by two double doors. On the door to the right might\r\nbe read \"First President's Room;\" on the door to the left, \"Council\r\nChamber.\" Between these two doors, for the convenience of the barristers\r\ngoing from the Hall to the Civil Chamber, which formerly was the Great\r\nChamber of Parliament, had been formed a narrow and dark passage, in\r\nwhich, as one of them remarked, \"every crime could be committed with\r\nimpunity.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving on one side the First President's Room and opening the door which\r\nbore the inscription \"Council Chamber,\" a large room was crossed,\r\nfurnished with a huge horse-shoe table, surrounded by green chairs. At\r\nthe end of this room, which in 1793 had served as a deliberating hall for\r\nthe juries of the Revolutionary Tribunal, there was a door placed in the\r\nwainscoting, which led into a little lobby where were two doors, on the\r\nright the door of the room appertaining to the President of the Criminal\r\nChamber, on the left the door of the Refreshment Room. \"Sentenced to\r\ndeath!--Now let us go and dine!\" These two ideas, Death and Dinner, have\r\njostled against each other for centuries. A third door closed the\r\nextremity of this lobby. This door was, so to speak, the last of the\r\nPalace of Justice, the farthest off, the least known, the most hidden; it\r\nopened into what was called the Library of the Court of Cassation, a\r\nlarge square room lighted by two windows overlooking the great inner yard\r\nof the Concièrgerie, furnished with a few leather chairs, a large table\r\ncovered with green cloth, and with law books lining the walls from the\r\nfloor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThis room, as may be seen, is the most secluded and the best hidden of\r\nany in the Palace.\r\n\r\nIt was here,--in this room, that there arrived successively on the 2d\r\nDecember, towards eleven o'clock in the morning, numerous men dressed in\r\nblack, without robes, without badges of office, affrighted, bewildered,\r\nshaking their heads, and whispering together. These trembling men were\r\nthe High Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nThe High Court of Justice, according to the terms of the Constitution,\r\nwas composed of seven magistrates; a President, four Judges, and two\r\nAssistants, chosen by the Court of Cassation from among its own members\r\nand renewed every year.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1851, these seven judges were named Hardouin, Pataille,\r\nMoreau, Delapalme, Cauchy, Grandet, and Quesnault, the two last-named\r\nbeing Assistants.\r\n\r\nThese men, almost unknown, had nevertheless some antecedents. M. Cauchy,\r\na few years previously President of the Chamber of the Royal Court of\r\nParis, an amiable man and easily frightened, was the brother of the\r\nmathematician, member of the Institute, to whom we owe the computation of\r\nwaves of sound, and of the ex-Registrar Archivist of the Chamber of\r\nPeers. M. Delapalme had been Advocate-General, and had taken a prominent\r\npart in the Press trials under the Restoration; M. Pataille had been\r\nDeputy of the Centre under the Monarchy of July; M. Moreau (de la Seine)\r\nwas noteworthy, inasmuch he had been nicknamed \"de la Seine\" to\r\ndistinguish him from M. Moreau (de la Meurthe), who on his side was\r\nnoteworthy, inasmuch as he had been nicknamed \"de la Meurthe\" to\r\ndistinguish him from M. Moreau (de la Seine). The first Assistant, M.\r\nGrandet, had been President of the Chamber at Paris. I have read this\r\npanegyric of him: \"He is known to possess no individuality or opinion of\r\nhis own whatsoever.\" The second Assistant, M. Quesnault, a Liberal, a\r\nDeputy, a Public Functionary, Advocate-General, a Conservative, learned,\r\nobedient, had attained by making a stepping-stone of each of these\r\nattributes, to the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation, where he\r\nwas known as one of the most severe members. 1848 had shocked his notion\r\nof Right, he had resigned after the 24th of February; he did not resign\r\nafter the 2d December.\r\n\r\nM. Hardouin, who presided over the High Court, was an ex-President of\r\nAssizes, a religious man, a rigid Jansenist, noted amongst his colleagues\r\nas a \"scrupulous magistrate,\" living in Port Royal, a diligent reader of\r\nNicolle, belonging to the race of the old Parliamentarians of the Marais,\r\nwho used to go to the Palais de Justice mounted on a mule; the mule had\r\nnow gone out of fashion, and whoever visited President Hardouin would\r\nhave found no more obstinacy in his stable than in his conscience.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 2d December, at nine o'clock, two men mounted the\r\nstairs of M. Hardouin's house, No. 10, Rue de Condé, and met together at\r\nhis door. One was M. Pataille; the other, one of the most prominent\r\nmembers of the bar of the Court of Cassation, was the ex-Constituent\r\nMartin (of Strasbourg). M. Pataille had just placed himself at M.\r\nHardouin's disposal.\r\n\r\nMartin's first thought, while reading the placards of the _coup d'état_,\r\nhad been for the High Court. M. Hardouin ushered M. Pataille into a room\r\nadjoining his study, and received Martin (of Strasbourg) as a man to\r\nwhom he did not wish to speak before witnesses. Being formally requested\r\nby Martin (of Strasbourg) to convene the High Court, he begged that he\r\nwould leave him alone, declared that the High Court would \"do its duty,\"\r\nbut that first he must \"confer with his colleagues,\" concluding with\r\nthis expression, \"It shall be done to-day or to-morrow.\" \"To-day or\r\nto-morrow!\" exclaimed Martin (of Strasbourg); \"Mr. President, the safety\r\nof the Republic, the safety of the country, perhaps, depends on what the\r\nHigh Court will or will not do. Your responsibility is great; bear that\r\nin mind. The High Court of Justice does not do its duty to-day or\r\nto-morrow; it does it at once, at the moment, without losing a minute,\r\nwithout an instant's hesitation.\"\r\n\r\nMartin (of Strasbourg) was right, Justice always belongs to To-day.\r\n\r\nMartin (of Strasbourg) added, \"If you want a man for active work, I am at\r\nyour service.\" M. Hardouin declined the offer; declared that he would not\r\nlose a moment, and begged Martin (of Strasbourg) to leave him to \"confer\"\r\nwith his colleague, M. Pataille.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he called together the High Court for eleven o'clock, and it was\r\nsettled that the meeting should take place in the Hall of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe Judges were punctual. At a quarter-past eleven they were all\r\nassembled. M. Pataille arrived the last.\r\n\r\nThey sat at the end of the great green table. They were alone in the\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nThere was no ceremonial. President Hardouin thus opened the debate:\r\n\"Gentlemen, there is no need to explain the situation, we all know what\r\nit is.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 68 of the Constitution was imperative. It was necessary that the\r\nHigh Court should meet _under penalty of high treason_. They gained time,\r\nthey swore themselves in, they appointed as Recorder of the High Court M.\r\nBernard, Recorder of the Court of Cassation, and they sent to fetch him,\r\nand while waiting requested the librarian, M. Denevers, to hold his pen\r\nin readiness. They settled the time and place for an evening meeting.\r\nThey talked of the conduct of the Constituent Martin (of Strasbourg),\r\nwith which they were offended, regarding it almost as a nudge of the\r\nelbow given by Politics to Justice. They spoke a little of Socialism, of\r\nthe Mountain, and of the Red Republic, and a little also of the judgment\r\nwhich they had to pronounce. They chatted, they told stories, they found\r\nfault, they speculated, they spun out the time.\r\n\r\nWhat were they waiting for?\r\n\r\nWe have related what the Commissary of police was doing for his part in\r\nhis department.\r\n\r\nAnd, in reference to this design, when the accomplices of the _coup\r\nd'état_ considered that the people in order to summon the High Court to\r\ndo its duty, could invade the Palace of Justice, and that they would\r\nnever look for it where it was assembled, they felt that this room had\r\nbeen excellently chosen. When, however, they considered that the police\r\nwould also doubtless come to expel the High Court, and that perhaps they\r\nwould not succeed in finding it, each one regretted to himself the choice\r\nof the room. They wished to hide the High Court, they had succeeded too\r\nwell. It was grievous to think that perhaps when the police and the armed\r\nforce should arrive, matters would have gone too far, and the High Court\r\nwould be too deeply compromised.\r\n\r\nThey had appointed a Recorder, now they must organize a Court. A second\r\nstep, more serious than the first.\r\n\r\nThe judges delayed, hoping that fortune would end by deciding on one side\r\nor the other, either for the Assembly or for the President, either\r\nagainst the _coup d'état_ or for it, and that there might thus be a\r\nvanquished party, so that the High Court could then with all safety lay\r\nits hands upon somebody.\r\n\r\nThey lengthily argued the question, whether they should immediately\r\ndecree the accusation of the President, or whether they should draw up a\r\nsimple order of inquiry. The latter course was adopted.\r\n\r\nThey drew up a judgment, not the honest and outspoken judgment which\r\nwas placarded by the efforts of the Representatives of the Left and\r\npublished, in which are found these words of bad taste, _Crime_ and\r\n_High Treason_; this judgment, a weapon of war, has never existed\r\notherwise than as a projectile. Wisdom in a judge sometimes consists in\r\ndrawing up a judgment which is not one, one of those judgments which has\r\nno binding force, in which everything is conditional; in which no one is\r\nincriminated, and nothing, is called by its right name. There are species\r\nof intermediate courses which allow of waiting and seeing; in delicate\r\ncrises men who are in earnest must not inconsiderately mingle with\r\npossible events that bluntness which is called Justice. The High Court\r\ntook advantage of this, it drew up a prudent judgment; this judgment is\r\nnot known; it is published here for the first time. Here it is. It is a\r\nmasterpiece of equivocal style:--\r\n\r\n  EXTRACT FROM THE REGISTRY OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n  \"The High Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n  \"According to Article 68 of the Constitution, considering that\r\n  printed placards beginning with these words, 'The President of the\r\n  Republic' and ending with the signatures, 'Louis Napoléon Bonaparte'\r\n  and 'De Morny, Minister of the Interior,' the said placards ordaining\r\n  amongst other measures the dissolution of the National Assembly, have\r\n  been posted to-day on the walls of Paris, that this fact of the\r\n  dissolution of the National Assembly by the President of the Republic\r\n  would be of the nature to constitute the case provided for by Article\r\n  68 of the Constitution, and renders, in the terms of the aforesaid\r\n  article, the meeting of the High Court indispensable.\r\n\r\n  \"It is declared that the High Court of Justice is organized, that it\r\n  appoints[4] ... to fulfil with it the functions of the Public\r\n  Ministry; that M. Bernard, the Recorder of the Court of Cassation,\r\n  should fulfil the duties of Recorder, and in order to proceed\r\n  further, according to the terms of the aforesaid Article 68 of the\r\n  Constitution, the Court will adjourn until to-morrow, the 3d of\r\n  December, at noon.\r\n\r\n  \"Drawn up and discussed in the Council Chamber, where were sitting\r\n  MM. Hardouin, president, Pataille, Moreau, Delapalme, and Cauchy,\r\n  judges, December 2, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nThe two Assistants, MM. Grandet and Quesnault, offered to sign the\r\ndecree, but the President ruled that it would be more correct only to\r\naccept the signatures of the titular judges, the Assistants not being\r\nqualified when the Court was complete.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was one o'clock, the news began to spread through the\r\npalace that a decree of deposition against Louis Bonaparte had been drawn\r\nup by a part of the Assembly; one of the judges who had gone out during\r\nthe debate, brought back this rumor to his colleagues. This coincided\r\nwith an outburst of energy. The President observed that it would be to\r\nthe purpose to appoint a Procureur-General.\r\n\r\nThere was a difficulty. Whom should they appoint? In all preceding trials\r\nthey had always chosen for a Procureur-General at the High Court the\r\nProcureur-General at the Court of Appeal of Paris. Why should they\r\nintroduce an innovation? They determined upon this Procureur-General of\r\nthe Court of Appeal. This Procureur-General was at the time M. de Royer,\r\nwho had been keeper of the Seals for M. Bonaparte. Thence a new\r\ndifficulty and a long debate.\r\n\r\nWould M. de Royer consent? M. Hardouin undertook to go and make the offer\r\nto him. He had only to cross the Mercière Gallery.\r\n\r\nM. de Royer was in his study. The proposal greatly embarrassed him. He\r\nremained speechless from the shock. To accept was serious, to refuse was\r\nstill more serious.\r\n\r\nThere was risk of treason. On the 2d December, an hour after noon, the\r\n_coup d'état_ was still a crime. M. de Royer, not knowing whether the\r\nhigh treason would succeed, ventured to stigmatize the deed as such in\r\nprivate, and cast down his eyes with a noble shame before this violation\r\nof the laws which, three months later, numerous purple robes, including\r\nhis own, endorsed with their oaths. But his indignation did not go to\r\nthe extent of supporting the indictment. An indictment speaks aloud. M.\r\nde Royer as yet only murmured. He was perplexed.\r\n\r\nM. Hardouin understood this state of conscience. Persistence would have\r\nbeen unreasonable. He withdrew.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the room where his colleagues were awaiting him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Commissary of the Arsenal Police had come back.\r\n\r\nHe had ended by succeeding in \"unearthing\"--such was his expression--the\r\nHigh Court. He penetrated as far as the Council Chamber of the Civil\r\nChamber; at that moment he had still no other escort than the few police\r\nagents of the morning. A boy was passing by. The Commissary asked him\r\nthe whereabouts of the High Court. \"The High Court?\" answered the boy;\r\n\"what is that?\" Nevertheless the boy told the Librarian, who came up. A\r\nfew words were exchanged between M. Denevers and the Commissary.\r\n\r\n\"What are you asking for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The High Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want the high Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in session.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it sitting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Librarian pointed to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Commissary.\r\n\r\nHe did not add another word, and returned into the Mercière Gallery.\r\n\r\nWe have just said that he was only accompanied at that time by a few\r\npolice agents.\r\n\r\nThe High Court was, in truth, in session. The President was relating to\r\nthe judges his visit to the Procureur General. Suddenly a tumultuous\r\nsound of footsteps is heard in the lobby which leads from the Council\r\nChamber to the room where they were deliberating. The door opens\r\nabruptly. Bayonets appear, and in the midst of the bayonets a man in a\r\nbuttoned-up overcoat, with a tricolored sash upon his coat.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates stare, stupefied.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the man, \"dissolve your meeting immediately.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Hardouin rises.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean? Who are you? Are you aware to whom you are\r\nspeaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am aware. You are the High Court, and I am the Commissary of the\r\nPolice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be off.\"\r\n\r\nThere were there thirty-five municipal guards, commanded by a lieutenant,\r\nand with a drum at their head.\r\n\r\n\"But----\" said the President.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary interrupted him with these words, which are literally\r\ngiven,--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, I am not going to enter upon an oratorical combat with\r\nyou. I have my orders, and I transmit them to you. Obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prefect of Police.\"\r\n\r\nThe President asked this strange question, which implied the acceptance\r\nof an order,--\r\n\r\n\"Have you a warrant?\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissary answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he handed a paper to the President.\r\n\r\nThe judges turned pale.\r\n\r\nThe President unfolded the paper; M. Cauchy put his head over M.\r\nHardouin's shoulder. The President read but,--\r\n\r\n\"You are ordered to dissolve the High Court, and, in case of refusal, to\r\narrest MM. Béranger, Rocher, De Boissieux, Pataille, and Hello.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, turning towards the judges, the President added,--\r\n\r\n\"Signed, Maupas.\"\r\n\r\nThen, addressing himself to the Commissary, he resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"There is some mistake, these are not our names. MM. Béranger, Rocher,\r\nand De Boissieux have served their time and are no longer judges of the\r\nHigh Court; as for M. Hello, he is dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe High Court, in reality, was temporary and renewable; the _coup\r\nd'état_ overthrew the Constitution, but did not understand it. The\r\nwarrant signed \"Maupas\" was applicable to the preceding High Court. The\r\n_coup d'état_ had been misled by an old list. Such is the heedlessness of\r\nassassins.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Commissary of Police,\" continued the President, \"you see that these\r\nnames are not ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not matter to me,\" replied the Commissary. \"Whether this\r\nwarrant does or does not apply to you, disperse, or I shall arrest all of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n\"At once.\"\r\n\r\nThe judges were silenced; one of them picked up from the table a loose\r\nsheet of paper, which was the judgment they had drawn up, and put the\r\npaper in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThen they went away.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary pointed to the door where the bayonets were, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"That way.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out by the lobby between two ranks of soldiers. The detachment\r\nof Republican Guards escorted them as far as the St. Louis Gallery.\r\n\r\nThere they set them free; their heads bowed down.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o'clock.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place in the Library, close by, in the\r\nformer great Chamber of the Parliament, the Court of Cassation was\r\nsitting in judgment as usual, without noticing what was happening so near\r\nat hand. It would appear, then, that the police exhaled no odor.\r\n\r\nLet us at once have done with this High Court.\r\n\r\nIn the evening at half-past seven the seven judges met together at the\r\nhouse of one of their number, he who had taken away the decree; they\r\nframed an official report, drew up a protest, and recognizing the\r\nnecessity of filling in the line left blank in their decree, on the\r\nproposition of M. Quesnault, appointed as Procureur-General M. Renouard,\r\ntheir colleague at the Court of Cessation. M. Renouard, who was\r\nimmediately informed, consented.\r\n\r\nThey met together for the last time on the next day, the 3d, at eleven\r\no'clock in the morning, an hour before the time mentioned in the judgment\r\nwhich we have read above,--again in the Library of the Court of\r\nCassation. M. Renouard was present. An official minute was given to him,\r\nrecording his appointment, as well as certain details with which he asked\r\nto be supplied. The judgment which had been drawn up was taken by M.\r\nQuesnault to the Recorder's Office, and immediately entered upon the\r\nRegister of the Secret Deliberations of the Court of Cassation, the High\r\nCourt not having a Special Register, and having decided, from its\r\ncreation, to use the Register of the Court of Cassation. After the decree\r\nthey also transcribed the two documents described as follows on the\r\nRegister:--\r\n\r\nI. An official report recording the interference of the police during the\r\ndiscussion upon the preceding decree.\r\n\r\nII. A minute of the appointment of M. Renouard to the office of\r\nProcureur-General.\r\n\r\nIn addition seven copies of these different documents drawn up by the\r\nhands of the judges themselves, and signed by them all, were put in a\r\nplace of safety, as also, it is said, a note-book, in which were written\r\nfive other secret decisions relating to the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nDoes this page of the Register of the Court of Cassation exist at the\r\npresent time? Is it true, as has been stated, that the prefect Maupas\r\nsent for the Register and tore out the leaf containing the decree? We\r\nhave not been able to clear up this point. The Register now is shown to\r\nno one, and those employed at the Recorder's Office are dumb.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts, let us summarize them. If this Court so called\r\n\"High,\" had been of a character to conceive such an idea as that of doing\r\nits duty--when it had once met together the mere organization of itself\r\nwas a matter of a few minutes--it would have proceeded resolutely and\r\nrapidly, it would have appointed as Procureur-General some energetic man\r\nbelonging to the Court of Cassation, either from the body of magistrates,\r\nsuch as Freslon, or from the bar, like Martin (of Strasbourg). By virtue\r\nof Article 68, and without waiting the initiative of the Assembly, it\r\nwould have drawn up a judgment stigmatizing the crime, it would have\r\nlaunched an order of arrest against the President and his accomplices and\r\nhave ordered the removal of the person of Louis Bonaparte to jail. As for\r\nthe Procureur-General he would have issued a warrant of arrest. All this\r\ncould have been done by half-past eleven, and at that time no attempt had\r\nbeen made to dissolve the High Court. These preliminary proceedings\r\nconcluded, the High Court, by going out through a nailed-up door leading\r\ninto the Salle des Pas Perdus, could have descended into the street, and\r\nthere have proclaimed its judgment to the people. At this time it would\r\nhave met with no hindrance. Finally, and this in any case, it should have\r\nsat robed on the Judges' Bench, with all magisterial state, and when the\r\npolice agent and his soldiers appeared should have ordered the soldiers,\r\nwho perhaps would have obeyed them, to arrest the agent, and if the\r\nsoldiers had disobeyed, should have allowed themselves to be formally\r\ndragged to prison, so that the people could see, under their own eyes,\r\nout in the open street, the filthy hoof of the _coup d'état_ trampling\r\nupon the robe of Justice.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, what steps did the High Court take? We have just seen.\r\n\r\n\"Be off with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going.\"\r\n\r\nWe can imagine, after a very different fashion, the dialogue between\r\nMathieu Molé and Vidocq.\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] This line was left blank. It was filled in later on with the name of\r\nM. Renouard, Councillor of the Court of Cassation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAIRIE OF THE TENTH ARRONDISSEMENT\r\n\r\nThe Representatives, having come out from M. Daru, rejoined each other\r\nand assembled in the street. There they consulted briefly, from group to\r\ngroup. There were a large number of them. In less than an hour, by\r\nsending notices to the houses on the left bank of the Seine alone, on\r\naccount of the extreme urgency, more than three hundred members could be\r\ncalled together. But where should they meet? At Lemardelay's? The Rue\r\nRichelieu was guarded. At the Salle Martel? It was a long way off. They\r\nrelied upon the Tenth Legion, of which General Lauriston was colonel.\r\nThey showed a preference for the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement.\r\nBesides, the distance was short, and there was no need to cross any\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nThey formed themselves into column, and set forth.\r\n\r\nM. Daru, as we have said, lived in the Rue de Lille, close by the\r\nAssembly. The section of the Rue de Lille lying between his house and\r\nthe Palais Bourbon was occupied by infantry. The last detachment\r\nbarred his door, but it only barred it on the right, not on the left.\r\nThe Representatives, on quitting M. Daru, bent their steps on the side\r\nof the Rue des Saints-Pères, and left the soldiers behind them. At\r\nthat moment the soldiers had only been instructed to prevent their\r\nmeeting in the Palace of the Assembly; they could quietly form\r\nthemselves into a column in the street, and set forth. If they had\r\nturned to the right instead of to the left, they would have been\r\nopposed. But there were no orders for the other alternative; they\r\npassed through a gap in the instructions.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards this threw St. Arnaud into a fit of fury.\r\n\r\nOn their way fresh Representatives came up and swelled the column. As the\r\nmembers of the Right lived for the most part in the Faubourg St. Germain,\r\nthe column was composed almost entirely of men belonging to the majority.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Quai d'Orsay they met a group of members of the\r\nLeft, who had reunited after their exit from the Palace of the Assembly,\r\nand who were consulting together. There were the Representatives\r\nEsquiros, Marc Dufraisse, Victor Hennequin, Colfavru, and Chamiot.\r\n\r\nThose who were marching at the head of the column left their places, went\r\nup to the group, and said, \"Come with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Marc Dufraisse.\r\n\r\nTo the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you intend to do there?\"\r\n\r\n\"To decree the deposition of Louis Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\"And afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards we shall go in a body to the Palace of the Assembly; we will\r\nforce our way in spite of all resistance, and from the top of the steps\r\nwe will read out the decree of deposition to the soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, we will join you,\" said Mare Dufraisse.\r\n\r\nThe five members of the Left marched at some distance from the column.\r\nSeveral of their friends who were mingled with the members of the Right\r\nrejoined them; and we may here mention a fact without giving it more\r\nimportance than it possesses, namely, that the two fractions of the\r\nAssembly represented in this unpremeditated gathering marched towards the\r\nMairie without being mingled together; one on each side of the street. It\r\nchanced that the men of the majority kept on the right side of the\r\nstreet, and the men of the minority on the left.\r\n\r\nNo one had a scarf of office. No outward token caused them to be\r\nrecognized. The passers-by stared at them with surprise, and did not\r\nunderstand what was the meaning of this procession of silent men through\r\nthe solitary streets of the Faubourg St. Germain. One district of Paris\r\nwas as yet unaware of the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nStrategically speaking, from a defensive point of view, the Mairie of\r\nthe tenth Arrondissement was badly chosen. Situated in a narrow street\r\nin that short section of the Rue de Grenelle-St.-Germain which lies\r\nbetween the Rue des Saints-Pères and the Rue du Sépulcre, close by the\r\ncross-roads of the Croix-Rouge, where the troops could arrive from so\r\nmany different points, the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement, confined,\r\ncommanded, and blockaded on every side, was a pitiful citadel for the\r\nassailed National Representation. It is true that they no longer had the\r\nchoice of a citadel, any more than later on they had the choice of a\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival at the Mairie might have seemed a good omen. The great\r\ngate which leads into a square courtyard was shut; it opened. The post\r\nof the National Guards, composed of some twenty men, took up their arms\r\nand rendered military honors to the Assembly. The Representatives\r\nentered, a Deputy Mayor received them with respect on the threshold of\r\nthe Mairie. \"The Palace of the Assembly is closed by the troops,\" said\r\nthe Representatives, \"we have come to deliberate here.\" The Deputy Mayor\r\nled them to the first story, and admitted them to the Great Municipal\r\nHall. The National Guard cried, \"Long live the National Assembly!\"\r\n\r\nThe Representatives having entered, the door was shut. A crowd began to\r\ngather in the street and shouted \"Long live the Assembly!\" A certain\r\nnumber of strangers to the Assembly entered the Mairie at the same time\r\nas the Representatives. Overcrowding was feared, and two sentries were\r\nplaced at a little side-door, which was left open, with orders only to\r\nallow members of the Assembly who might come afterwards to enter. M.\r\nHowyn Tranchère stationed himself at this door, and undertook to identify\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the Mairie, the Representatives numbered somewhat\r\nunder three hundred. They exceeded this number later on. It was about\r\neleven o'clock in the morning. All did not go up at once into the hall\r\nwhere the meeting was to take place. Several, those of the Left in\r\nparticular, remained in the courtyard, mingling with the National Guards\r\nand citizens.\r\n\r\nThey talked of what they were going to do.\r\n\r\nThis was the first difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Father of the meeting was M. de Kératry.\r\n\r\nWas he going to preside?\r\n\r\nThe Representatives who were assembled in the Great Hall were in his\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives remaining in the courtyard hesitated.\r\n\r\nMarc Dufraisse went up to MM. Jules de Lasteyrie and Léon de Maleville,\r\nwho had stayed behind with the Representatives of the Left, and said to\r\nthem, \"What are they thinking of upstairs? To make Kératry President? The\r\nname of Kératry would frighten the people as thoroughly as mine would\r\nfrighten the middle classes.\"\r\n\r\nA member of the Right, M. de Keranflech, came up, and intending to\r\nsupport the objection, added, \"And then, think of Kératry's age. It is\r\nmadness to pit a man of eighty against this hour of danger.\"\r\n\r\nBut Esquiros exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"That is a bad reason! Eighty years! They constitute a force.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; where they are well borne,\" said Colfavru. \"Kératry bears them\r\nbadly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is greater,\" resumed Esquiros, \"than great octogenarians.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is glorious,\" added Chamiot, \"to be presided over by Nestor.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, by Gerontes,\"[5] said Victor Hennequin.\r\n\r\nThese words put an end to the debate. Kératry was thrown out. MM. Léon\r\nde Maleville and Jules de Lasteyrie, two men respected by all parties,\r\nundertook to make the members of the Right listen to reason. It was\r\ndecided that the \"bureau\"[6] should preside. Five members of the \"bureau\"\r\nwere present; two Vice-Presidents, MM. Benoist d'Azy and Vitet, and three\r\nSecretaries, MM. Griumult, Chapot, and Moulin. Of the two other\r\nVice-Presidents, one, General Bedrau, was at Mazas; the other, M. Daru,\r\nwas under guard in his own house. Of the three other Secretaries, two,\r\nMM. Peapin and Lacaze, men of the Elysée, were absentees; the other, M.\r\nYvan, a member of the Left, was at the meeting of the Left, in the Rue\r\nBlanche, which was taking place almost at the same moment.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an usher appeared on the steps of the Mairie, and cried\r\nout, as on the most peaceful days of the Assembly, \"Representatives, to\r\nthe sitting!\"\r\n\r\nThis usher, who belonged to the Assembly, and who had followed it, shared\r\nits fortunes throughout this day, the sequestration on the Quai d'Orsay\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nAt the summons of the usher all the Representatives in the courtyard, and\r\namongst whom was one of the Vice-Presidents, M. Vitei, went upstairs to\r\nthe Hall, and the sitting was opened.\r\n\r\nThis sitting was the last which the Assembly held under regular\r\nconditions. The Left, which, as we have seen, had on its side boldly\r\nrecaptured the Legislative power, and had added to it that which\r\ncircumstances required--as was the duty of Revolutionists; the Left,\r\nwithout a \"bureau,\" without an usher, and without secretaries, held\r\nsittings in which the accurate and passionless record of shorthand was\r\nwanting, but which live in our memories and which History will gather up.\r\n\r\nTwo shorthand writers of the Assembly, MM. Grosselet and Lagache, were\r\npresent at the sitting at the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement. They\r\nhave been able to record it. The censorship of the victorious _coup\r\nd'état_ has mutilated their report and has published through its\r\nhistorians this mangled version as the true version. One lie more. That\r\ndoes not matter. This shorthand recital belongs to the brief of the 2d\r\nDecember, it is one of the leading documents in the trial which the\r\nfuture will institute. In the notes of this book will be found this\r\ndocument complete. The passages in inverted commas are those which the\r\ncensorship of M. Bonaparte has suppressed. This suppression is a proof of\r\ntheir significance and importance.\r\n\r\nShorthand reproduces everything except life. Stenography is an ear. It\r\nhears and sees not. It is therefore necessary to fill in here the\r\ninevitable blanks of the shorthand account.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a complete idea of this sitting of the Tenth\r\nArrondissement, we must picture the great Hall of the Mairie, a sort of\r\nparallelogram, lighted on the right by four or five windows overlooking\r\nthe courtyard; on the left, along the wall, furnished with several rows\r\nof benches which had been hastily brought thither, on which were piled up\r\nthe three hundred Representatives, assembled together by chance. No one\r\nwas sitting down, those in front were standing, those behind were mounted\r\non the benches. Here and there were a few small tables. In the centre\r\npeople walked to and fro. At the bottom, at the end opposite the door,\r\nwas a long table furnished with benches, which occupied the whole width\r\nof the wall, behind which sat the \"bureau.\" \"Sitting\" is merely the\r\nconventional term. The \"bureau\" did not \"sit;\" like the rest of the\r\nAssembly it was on its feet. The secretaries, M.M. Chapot, Moulin, and\r\nGrimault wrote standing. At certain moments the two Vice-Presidents\r\nmounted on the benches so as to be better seen from all points of the\r\nroom. The table was covered by an old green tablecloth, stained with ink,\r\nthree or four inkstands had been brought in, and a quire of paper was\r\nscattered about. There the decrees were written as soon as they were\r\ndrawn up. They multiplied the copies, some Representatives became\r\nsecretaries on the spur of the moment, and helped the official\r\nsecretaries.\r\n\r\nThis great hall was on a level with the landing. It was situated, as we\r\nhave said, on the first floor; it was reached by a very narrow staircase.\r\n\r\nWe must recollect that nearly the whole of the members present were\r\nmembers of the Right.\r\n\r\nThe first moment was a serious one. Berryer came out to advantage.\r\nBerryer, like all those extemporizers without style, will only be\r\nremembered as a name, and a much disputed name, Berryer having been\r\nrather a special pleader than an orator who believed what he said. On\r\nthat day Berryer was to the point, logical and earnest. They began by\r\nthis cry, \"What shall we do?\" \"Draw up a declaration,\" said M. de\r\nFalloux. \"A protest,\" said M. de Flavigny. \"A decree,\" said Berryer.\r\n\r\nIn truth a declaration was empty air, a protest was noise, a decree was\r\naction. They cried out, \"What decree?\" \"Deposition,\" said Berryer.\r\nDeposition was the extreme limit of the energy of the Right. Beyond\r\ndeposition, there was outlawry; deposition was practicable for the Right,\r\noutlawry was only possible for the Left. In fact it was the Left who\r\noutlawed Louis Bonaparte. They did it at their first meeting in the Rue\r\nBlanche. We shall see this later on. At deposition, Legality came to an\r\nend; at outlawry, the Revolution began. The recurrence of Revolutions are\r\nthe logical consequences of _coups d'état_. The deposition having been\r\nvoted, a man who later on turned traitor, Quentin Bauchart, exclaimed,\r\n\"Let us all sign it.\" All signed it. Odilon Barrot came in and signed it.\r\nAntony Thouret came in and signed it. Suddenly M. Piscatory announced\r\nthat the Mayor was refusing to allow Representatives who had arrived to\r\nenter the Hall. \"Order him to do so by decree,\" said Berryer. And the\r\ndecree was voted. Thanks to this decree, MM. Favreau and Monet entered;\r\nthey came from the Legislative Palace; they related the cowardice of\r\nDupin. M. Dahirel, one of the leaders of the Right, was exasperated, and\r\nsaid, \"We have received bayonet thrusts.\" Voices were raised, \"Let us\r\nsummon the Tenth Legion. Let the call to arms be beaten. Lauriston\r\nhesitates. Let us order him to protect the Assembly.\" \"Let us order him\r\nby decree,\" said Berryer. This decree was drawn up, which, however, did\r\nnot prevent Lauriston from refusing. Another decree, again proposed by\r\nBerryer, pronounced any one who had outraged the Parliamentary\r\ninviolability to be a traitor, and ordered the immediate release of those\r\nRepresentatives who had been wrongfully made prisoners. All this was\r\nvoted at once without debate, in a sort of great unanimous confusion, and\r\nin the midst of a storm of fierce conversations. From time to time\r\nBerryer imposed silence. Then the angry outcries broke forth again. \"The\r\n_coup d'état_ will not dare to come here.\" \"We are masters here.\" \"We are\r\nat home.\" \"It would be impossible to attack us here.\" \"These wretches\r\nwill not dare to do so.\" If the uproar had been less violent, the\r\nRepresentatives might have heard through the open windows close at hand,\r\nthe sound of soldiers loading their guns.\r\n\r\nA regiment of Chasseurs of Vincennes had just entered silently into the\r\ngarden of the Mairie, and, while waiting for orders, were loading their\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the sitting, at first disorderly and tumultuous, had\r\nassumed an ordinary aspect. The uproar had relapsed into a murmur. The\r\nvoice of the usher, crying \"Silence, gentlemen,\" had succeeded in\r\novercoming the hubbub. Every moment fresh Representatives came in, and\r\nhastened to sign the decree of deposition at the \"bureau.\" As there was\r\na great crowd round the \"bureau\" waiting to sign, a dozen loose sheets\r\nof paper to which the Representatives affixed their signatures were\r\ncirculated in the great Hall and the two adjoining rooms.\r\n\r\nThe first to sign the decree of deposition was M. Dufaure, the last was\r\nM. Betting de Lancastel. Of the two Presidents, one, M. Benoist d'Azy,\r\nwas addressing the Assembly; the other, M. Vitet, pale, but calm and\r\nresolute, distributed instructions and orders. M. Benoist d'Azy\r\nmaintained a decorous countenance, but a certain hesitation in his\r\nspeech revealed an inner agitation. Divisions, even in the Right, had not\r\ndisappeared at this critical moment. A Legitimist member was overheard\r\nsaying in a low voice, while speaking of one of the Vice-Presidents,\r\n\"This great Vitet looks like a whited sepulchre.\" Vitet was an Orleanist.\r\n\r\nGiven this adventurer with whom they had to deal, this Louis Bonaparte,\r\ncapable of everything, the hour and the man being wrapt in mystery, some\r\nLegitimist personages of a candid mind were seriously but comically\r\nfrightened. The Marquis of ----, who acted the fly on the coach-wheel\r\nto the Right, went hither and thither, harangued, shouted, declaimed,\r\nremonstrated, proclaimed, and trembled. Another, M. A---- N----,\r\nperspiring, red-faced, out of breath, rushed about distractedly. \"Where\r\nis the guard? How many men are there? Who commands them? The officer!\r\nsend me the officer! Long live the Republic! National Guard, stand firm!\r\nLong live the Republic!\" All the Right shouted this cry. \"You wish then\r\nto kill it,\" said Esquiros. Some of them were dejected; Bourbousson\r\nmaintained the silence of a vanquished placeman. Another, the Viscount of\r\n----, a relative of the Duke of Escars, was so alarmed that every moment\r\nhe adjourned to a corner of the courtyard. In the crowd which filled the\r\ncourtyard there was a _gamin_ of Paris, a child of Athens, who has since\r\nbecome am elegant and charming poet, Albert Glatigny. Albert Glatigny\r\ncried out to this frightened Viscount, \"Hulloa there! Do you think that\r\n_coups d'état_ are extinguished in the way Gulliver put out the fire?\"\r\n\r\nOh, Laughter, how gloomy you are when attended with Tragedy!\r\n\r\nThe Orleanists were quieter, and maintained a more becoming attitude.\r\nThis arose from the fact that they ran greater danger.\r\n\r\nPascal Duprat replaced at the top of the decrees the words, \"République\r\nFrançaise,\" which had been forgotten.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time men who were not speaking on the subject of the moment\r\nmentioned this strange word, \"Dupin,\" open which there ensued shouts of\r\nderision and bursts of laughter. \"Utter the name of that coward no more,\"\r\ncried Antony Thouret.\r\n\r\nThere were motions and counter-motions; it was a continual uproar\r\ninterrupted by deep and solemn silences. Alarmist phrases circulated from\r\ngroup to group. \"We are in a blind alley.\" \"We are caught here as in a\r\nrat trap;\" and then on each motion voices were raised: \"That is it!\" \"It\r\nis right!\" \"It is settled!\" They agreed in a low voice upon a rendezvous\r\nat No. 19, Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, in case they should be expelled\r\nfrom the Mairie. M. Bixio carried off the decree of deposition to get it\r\nprinted. Esquiros, Marc Dufraisse, Pascal Duprat, Rigal, Lherbette,\r\nChamiot, Latrade, Colfavru, Antony Thouret, threw in here and there\r\nenergetic words of advice. M. Dufaure, resolute and indignant, protested\r\nwith authority. M. Odilon Barrot, motionless in a corner, maintained the\r\nsilence of stupefied silliness.\r\n\r\nMM. Passy and de Tocqueville, in the midst of the groups, described that\r\nwhen they were Ministers they had always entertained an uneasy suspicion\r\nof a _coup d'état_, and that they clearly perceived this fixed idea in\r\nthe brain of Louis Bonaparte. M. de Tocqueville added, \"I said to myself\r\nevery night, 'I lie down to sleep a Minister; what if I should awake a\r\nprisoner?'\" Some of those men who were termed \"men of order,\" muttered\r\nwhile signing the degree of deposition, \"Beware of the Red Republic!\" and\r\nseemed to entertain an equal fear of failure and of success. M. de\r\nVatimesnil pressed the hands of the men of the Left, and thanked them for\r\ntheir presence. \"You make us popular,\" said he. And Antony Thouret\r\nanswered him, \"I know neither Right nor Left to-day; I only see the\r\nAssembly.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger of the two shorthand writers handed their written sheets\r\nto the Representatives who had spoken, and, asked them to revise them at\r\nonce, saying, \"We shall not have the time to read them over.\" Some\r\nRepresentatives went down into the street, and showed the people copies\r\nof the decree of deposition, signed by the members of the \"bureau.\" One\r\nof the populace took one of these copies, and cried out, \"Citizens! the\r\nink is still quite wet! Long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Mayor stood at the door of the Hall; the staircase was crowded\r\nwith National Guards and spectators. In the Assembly several had\r\npenetrated into the Hall, and amongst them the ex-Constituent Beslay, a\r\nman of uncommon courage. It was at first wished to turn them out, but\r\nthey resisted, crying, \"This is our business. You are the Assembly, but\r\nwe are the People.\" \"They are right,\" said M. Berryer.\r\n\r\nM. de Falloux, accompanied by M. de Kéranflech, came up the Constituent\r\nBeslay, and leaned by his side on the stove, saying to him, \"Good-day,\r\ncolleague;\" and reminded him that they both had formed part of the\r\nCommittee of the National Workshops, and that they had together visited\r\nthe Workmen at the Parc Monceaux. The Right felt themselves falling; they\r\nbecame affectionate towards Republicans. The Republic is called\r\nTo-morrow.\r\n\r\nEach spoke from his place; this member upon a bench, that member on a\r\nchair, a few on the tables. All contradictory opinions burst forth at\r\nonce. In a corner some ex-leaders of \"order\" were scared at the possible\r\ntriumph of the \"Reds.\" In another the men of the Right surrounded the men\r\nof the Left, and asked them: \"Are not the faubourgs going to rise?\"\r\n\r\nThe narrator has but one duty, to tell his story; he relates everything,\r\nthe bad as well as the good. Whatever may have taken place, however, and\r\nnotwithstanding all these details of which it was our duty to speak,\r\napart from the exceptions which we had mentioned, the attitude of the\r\nmen of the Right who composed the large majority of this meeting was in\r\nmany respects honorable and worthy. Some of them, as we have just\r\nmentioned, even prided themselves upon their resolution and their energy,\r\nalmost as though they had wished to rival the members of the Left.\r\n\r\nWe may here remark--for in the course of this narrative we shall more\r\nthan once see the gaze of some members of the Right turned towards the\r\npeople, and in this no mistake should be made--that these monarchical men\r\nwho talked of popular insurrection and who invoked the faubourgs were a\r\nminority in the majority,--an imperceptible minority. Antony Thouret\r\nproposed to those who were leaders there to go in a body through the\r\nworking-class neighborhoods with the decree of deposition in their\r\nhands. Brought to bay, they refused. They declared that they would only\r\nprotect themselves by organized powers, not by the people. It is a\r\nstrange thing to say, but it must be noted, that with their habits of\r\npolitical shortsightedness, the popular armed resistance, even in the\r\nname of the Law, seemed sedition to them. The utmost appearance of\r\nrevolution which they could endure was a regiment of the National Guard,\r\nwith their drums at their head; they shrank from the barricade; Right in\r\na blouse was no longer Right, Truth armed with a pike was no longer\r\nTruth, Law unpaving a street gave them the impression of a Fury. In the\r\nmain, however, and taking them for what they were, and considering their\r\nposition as politicians, these members of the Right were well-advised.\r\nWhat would they have done with the people? And what would the people have\r\ndone with them? How would they have proceeded to set fire to the masses?\r\nImagine Falloux as a tribune, fanning the Faubourg St. Antoine into a\r\nflame!\r\n\r\nAlas! in the midst of this dense gloom, in these fatal complications of\r\ncircumstances by which the _coup d'état_ profited so odiously and so\r\nperfidiously, in that mighty misunderstanding which comprised the whole\r\nsituation, for kindling the revolutionary spark in the heart of the\r\npeople, Danton himself would not have sufficed.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ entered into this meeting impudently, with its\r\nconvict's cap on its head. It possessed an infamous assurance there, as\r\nwell as everywhere else. There were in this majority three hundred\r\nRepresentatives of the People. Louis Napoleon sent a sergeant to drive\r\nthem away. The Assembly, having resisted the sergeant, he sent an\r\nofficer, the temporary commander of the sixth battalion of the Chasseurs\r\nde Vincennes. This officer, young, fair-haired, a scoffer, half laughing,\r\nhalf threatening, pointed with his finger to the stairs filled with\r\nbayonets, and defied the Assembly. \"Who is this young spark?\" asked a\r\nmember of the Right. A National Guard who was there said, \"Throw him out\r\nof the window!\" \"Kick him downstairs!\" cried one of the people.\r\n\r\nThis Assembly, grievous as were its offences against the principles of\r\nthe Revolution--and with these wrongs Democracy alone had the right to\r\nreproach it--this Assembly, I repeat, was the National Assembly, that is\r\nto say, the Republic incarnate, the living Universal Suffrage, the\r\nMajesty of the Nation, upright and visible. Louis Bonaparte assassinated\r\nthis Assembly, and moreover insulted it. A slap on the face is worse than\r\na poniard thrust.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the neighborhood occupied by the troops were full of\r\nbroken bottles. They had plied the soldiers with drink. They obeyed the\r\n\"epaulettes\" unconditionally, and according to the expression of\r\neyewitnesses, appeared \"dazed-drunk.\" The Representatives appealed to\r\nthem, and said to them, \"It is a crime!\" They answered, \"We are not aware\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nOne soldier was heard to say to another, \"What have you done with your\r\nten francs of this morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeants hustled the officers. With the exception of the commander,\r\nwho probably earned his cross of honor, the officers were respectful, the\r\nsergeants brutal.\r\n\r\nA lieutenant showing signs of flinching, a sergeant cried out to him,\r\n\"You are not the only one who commands here! Come, therefore, march!\"\r\n\r\nM. de Vatimesnil asked a soldier, \"Will you dare to arrest us--us, the\r\nRepresentatives of the People?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly!\" said the soldier.\r\n\r\nSeveral soldiers hearing some Representatives say that they had eaten\r\nnothing since the morning, offered them their ration bread. Some\r\nRepresentatives accepted. M. de Tocqueville, who was unwell, and who was\r\nnoticed to be pale and leaning on the sill of a window, received from a\r\nsoldier a piece of this bread, which he shared with M. Chambolle.\r\n\r\nTwo Commissaries of Police appeared in \"full dress,\" in black coats\r\ngirded with their sash-girdles and their black corded hats. One was an\r\nold man, the other a young man. The first was named Lemoine-Tacherat, and\r\nnot Bacherel, as has been wrongly printed: the second was named Barlet.\r\nThese names should be noted. The unprecedented assurance of this Barlet\r\nwas remarked. Nothing was wanting in him,--cynical speech, provoking\r\ngesture, sardonic intonation. It was with an inexpressible air of\r\ninsolence that Barlet, when summoning the meeting to dissolve itself,\r\nadded, \"Rightly or Wrongly.\" They murmured on the benches of the\r\nAssembly, \"Who is this scoundrel?\" The other, compared to him, seemed\r\nmoderate and inoffensive. Emile Péan exclaimed, \"The old man is simply\r\nworking in his profession, but the young man is working out his\r\npromotion.\"\r\n\r\nBefore this Tacherat and this Barlet entered, before the butts of the\r\nmuskets had been heard ringing on the stones of the staircase, this\r\nAssembly had talked of resistance. Of what kind of resistance? We have\r\njust stated. The majority could only listen to a regular organized\r\nresistance, a military resistance in uniform and in epaulets. Such a\r\nresistance was easy to decree, but it was difficult to organize. The\r\nGenerals on whom the Assembly were accustomed to rely having been\r\narrested, there only remained two possible Generals, Oudinot and\r\nLauriston. General Marquis de Lauriston, ex-peer of France, and at the\r\nsame time Colonel of the Tenth Legion and Representative of the People,\r\ndrew a distinction between his duty as Representative and his duty as\r\nColonel. Summoned by some of his friends of the Right to beat to arms and\r\ncall together the Tenth Legion, he answered, \"As Representative of the\r\nPeople I ought to indict the Executive Power, but as Colonel I ought to\r\nobey it.\" It appears that he obstinately shut himself up in this singular\r\nreasoning, and that it was impossible to draw him out of it.\r\n\r\n\"How stupid he is!\" said Piscatory.\r\n\r\n\"How sharp he is!\" said Falloux.\r\n\r\nThe first officer of the National Guard who appeared in uniform, seemed\r\nto be recognized by two members of the Right, who said, \"It is M. de\r\nPerigord!\" They made a mistake, it was M. Guilbot, major of the third\r\nbattalion of the Tenth Legion. He declared that he was ready to march on\r\nthe first order from his Colonel, General Lauriston. General Lauriston\r\nwent down into the courtyard, and came up a moment afterwards, saying,\r\n\"They do not recognize my authority. I have just resigned,\" Moreover, the\r\nname of Lauriston was not familiar to the soldiers. Oudinot was better\r\nknown in the army. But how?\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the name of Oudinot was pronounced, a shudder ran\r\nthrough this meeting, almost exclusively composed of members of the\r\nRight. In fact at this critical time, at this fatal name of Oudinot,\r\nreflections crowded upon each other in every mind.\r\n\r\nWhat was the _coup d'état_?\r\n\r\nIt was the \"Roman expedition at home.\" Which was undertaken against whom?\r\nAgainst those who had undertaken the \"Roman expedition abroad.\" The\r\nNational Assembly of France, dissolved by violence, could find only one\r\nsingle General to defend it in its dying hour. And whom? Precisely he,\r\nwho in the name of the National Assembly of France had dissolved by\r\nviolence the National Assembly of Rome. What power could Oudinot, the\r\nstrangler of a Republic, possess to save a Republic? Was it not evident\r\nthat his own soldiers would answer him, \"What do you want with us? That\r\nwhich we have done at Rome we now do at Paris.\" What a story is this\r\nstory of treason! The French Legislature had written the first chapter\r\nwith the blood of the Roman Constituent Assembly: Providence wrote the\r\nsecond chapter with the blood of the French Legislature, Louis Bonaparte\r\nholding the pen.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Louis Bonaparte had assassinated the sovereignty of the People\r\nin the person of its Roman Representatives; in 1851 he assassinated it in\r\nthe person of its French Representatives. It was logical, and although it\r\nwas infamous, it was just. The Legislative Assembly bore at the same time\r\nthe weight of two crimes; it was the accomplice of the first, the victim\r\nof the second. All these men of the majority felt this, and were humbled.\r\nOr rather it was the same crime, the crime of the Second of July, 1849,\r\never erect, ever alive, which had only changed its name, which now called\r\nitself the Second of December, and which, the offspring of this Assembly,\r\nstabbed it to the heart. Nearly all crimes are parricidal. On a certain\r\nday they recoil upon those who have committed them, and slay them.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, so full of anxiety, M. de Falloux must have glanced round\r\nfor M. de Montalembert. M. de Montalembert was at the Elysée.\r\n\r\nWhen Tamisier rose and pronounced this terrifying word, \"The Roman\r\nQuestion?\" distracted M. de Dampierre shouted to him, \"Silence! You kill\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not Tamisier who was killing them--it was Oudinot.\r\n\r\nM. de Dampierre did not perceive that he cried \"Silence!\" to history.\r\n\r\nAnd then without even reckoning the fatal remembrance which at such a\r\nmoment would have crushed a man endowed in the highest degree with great\r\nmilitary qualities, General Oudinot, in other respects an excellent\r\nofficer, and a worthy son of his brave father, possessed none of those\r\nstriking qualities which in the critical hour of revolution stir the\r\nsoldier and carry with them the people. At that instant to win back an\r\narmy of a hundred thousand men, to withdraw the balls from the cannons'\r\nmouths, to find beneath the wine poured out to the Praetorians the true\r\nsoul of the French soldier half drowned and nearly dead, to tear the flag\r\nfrom the _coup d'état_ and restore it to the Law, to surround the\r\nAssembly with thunders and lightnings, it would have needed one of those\r\nmen who exist no longer; it would have needed the firm hand, the calm\r\noratory, the cold and searching glance of Desaix, that French Phocion; it\r\nwould have needed the huge shoulders, the commanding stature, the\r\nthundering voice, the abusive, insolent, cynical, gay, and sublime\r\neloquence of Kléber, that military Mirabeau. Desaix, the countenance of a\r\njust man, or Kléber, the face of the lion! General Oudinot, little,\r\nawkward, embarrassed, with an indecisive and dull gaze, red cheeks, low\r\nforehead, with grizzled and lank hair, polite tone of voice, a humble\r\nsmile, without oratory, without gesture, without power, brave before the\r\nenemy, timid before the first comer, having assuredly the bearing of a\r\nsoldier, but having also the bearing of a priest; he caused the mind to\r\nhesitate between the sword and the taper; he had in his eyes a sort of\r\n\"Amen!\"\r\n\r\nHe had the best intentions in the world, but what could he do? Alone,\r\nwithout prestige, without true glory, without personal authority, and\r\ndragging Rome after him! He felt all this himself, and he was as it were\r\nparalyzed by it. As soon as they had appointed him he got upon a chair\r\nand thanked the Assembly, doubtless with a firm heart, but with\r\nhesitating speech. When the little fair-haired officer dared to look him\r\nin the face and insult him, he, holding the sword of the people, he,\r\nGeneral of the sovereign Assembly, he only knew how to stammer out such\r\nwretched phrases as these, \"I have just declared to you that we are\r\nunable, 'unless compelled and constrained,' to obey the order which\r\nprohibits us from remaining assembled together.\" He spoke of obeying, he\r\nwho ought to command. They had girded him with his scarf, and it seemed\r\nto make him uncomfortable. He inclined his head alternately first to one\r\nshoulder and then to the other; he held his hat and cane in his hand, he\r\nhad a benevolent aspect. A Legitimist member muttered in a low voice to\r\nhis neighbor, \"One might imagine he was a bailiff speechifying at a\r\nwedding.\" And his neighbor, a Legitimist also, replied, \"He reminds me of\r\nthe Duc d'Angoulême.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast to Tamisier! Tamisier, frank, earnest confident, although\r\na mere Captain of Artillery, had the bearing of a General. Had Tamisier,\r\nwith his grave and gentle countenance, high intelligence, and dauntless\r\nheart, a species of soldier-philosopher, been better known, he could have\r\nrendered decisive services. No one can tell what would have happened if\r\nProvidence had given the soul of Tamisier to Oudinot, or the epaulets of\r\nOudinot to Tamisier.\r\n\r\nIn this bloody enterprise of December we failed to find a General's\r\nuniform becomingly worn. A book might be written on the part which gold\r\nlace plays in the destiny of nations.\r\n\r\nTamisier, appointed Chief of the Staff some instants before the invasion\r\nof the hall, placed himself at the disposal of the Assembly. He was\r\nstanding on a table. He spoke with a resonant and hearty voice. The most\r\ndowncast became reassured by this modest, honest, devoted attitude.\r\nSuddenly he drew himself up, and looking all that Royalist majority in\r\nthe face, exclaimed, \"Yes, I accept the charge you offer me. I accept the\r\ncharge of defending the Republic! Nothing but the Republic! Do you\r\nperfectly understand?\"\r\n\r\nA unanimous shout answered him. \"Long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Beslay, \"the voice comes back to you as on the Fourth of May.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live the Republic! Nothing but the Republic!\" repeated the men of\r\nthe Right, Oudinot louder than the others. All arms were stretched\r\ntowards Tamisier, every hand pressed his. Oh Danger! irresistible\r\nconverter! In his last hour the Atheist invokes God, and the Royalist the\r\nRepublic. They cling to that which they have repudiated.\r\n\r\nThe official historians of the _coup d'état_ have stated that at the\r\nbeginning of the sitting two Representatives had been sent by the\r\nAssembly to the Ministry of the Interior to \"negotiate.\" What is certain\r\nis that these two Representatives had no authority. They presented\r\nthemselves, not on behalf of the Assembly, but in their own name. They\r\noffered themselves as intermediaries to procure a peaceable termination\r\nof the catastrophe which had begun. With an honesty which bordered on\r\nsimplicity they summoned Morny to yield himself a prisoner, and to return\r\nwithin the law, declaring that in case of refusal the Assembly would do\r\nits duty, and call the people to the defence of the Constitution and of\r\nthe Republic. Marny answered them with a smile, accompanied by these\r\nplain words, \"If you appeal to arms, and if I find any Representatives on\r\nthe barricades, I will have them all shot to the last man.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting in the Tenth Arrondissement yielded to force. President Vitet\r\ninsisted that they should forcibly arrest him. A police agent who seized\r\nhim turned pale and trembled. In certain circumstances, to lay violent\r\nhands upon a man is to lay them upon Right, and those who dare to do so\r\nare made to tremble by outraged Law. The exodus from the Mairie was long\r\nand beset with obstructions. Half-an-hour elapsed while the soldiers were\r\nforming a line, and while the Commissaries of Police, all the time\r\nappearing solely occupied with the care of driving back the crowd in the\r\nstreet, sent for orders to the Ministry of the Interior. During that time\r\nsome of the Representatives, seated round a table in the great Hall,\r\nwrote to their families, to their wives, to their friends. They snatched\r\nup the last leaves of paper; the pens failed; M. de Luynes wrote to his\r\nwife a letter in pencil. There were no wafers; they were forced to send\r\nthe letters unsealed; some soldiers offered to post them. M. Chambolle's\r\nson, who had accompanied his father thus far, undertook to take the\r\nletters addressed to Mesdames de Luynes, de Lasteyrie, and Duvergier de\r\nHauranne. General Forey--the same who had refused a battalion to the\r\nPresident of the Constituent Assembly, Marrast, who had promoted him from\r\na colonel to a general--General Forey, in the centre of the courtyard of\r\nthe Mairie, his face inflamed, half drunk, coming out, they said, from\r\nbreakfast at the Elysée, superintended the outrage. A member, whose name\r\nwe regret we do not know, dipped his boot into the gutter and wiped it\r\nalong the gold stripe of the regimental trousers of General Forey.\r\nRepresentative Lherbette came up to General Forey, and said to him,\r\n\"General, you are a coward.\" Then turning to his colleagues, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Do you hear? I tell this general that he is a coward.\"\r\nGeneral Forey did not stir. He kept the mud on his uniform and the\r\nepithet on his cheek.\r\n\r\nThe meeting did not call the people to arms. We have just explained that\r\nit was not strong enough to do so; nevertheless, at the last moment, a\r\nmember of the Left, Latrade, made a fresh effort. He took M. Berryer\r\naside, and said to him, \"Our official measures of resistance have come to\r\nan end; let us not allow ourselves now to be arrested. Let us disperse\r\nthroughout the streets crying, 'To arms!'\" M. Berryer consulted a few\r\nseconds on the matter with the Vice-President, M. Benoist d'Azy, who\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Mayor, hat in hand, reconducted the members of the Assembly as\r\nfar as the gate of the Mairie. As soon as they appeared in the courtyard\r\nready to go out between two lines of soldiers, the post of National\r\nGuards presented arms, acid shouted, \"Long live the Assembly! Long live\r\nthe Representatives of the People!\" The National Guards were at once\r\ndisarmed, almost forcibly, by the Chasseurs de Vincennes.\r\n\r\nThere was a wine-shop opposite the Mairie. As soon as the great folding\r\ngates of the Mairie opened, and the Assembly appeared in the street, led\r\nby General Forey on horseback, and having at its head the Vice-President\r\nVitet, grasped by the necktie by a police agent, a few men in white\r\nblouses, gathered at the windows of this wine-shop, clapped their hands\r\nand shouted, \"Well done! down with the 'twenty-five francs!'\"[7]\r\n\r\nThey set forth.\r\n\r\nThe Chasseurs de Vincennes, who marched in a double line on each side of\r\nthe prisoners, cast at them looks of hatred. General Oudinot said in a\r\nwhisper, \"These little infantry soldiers are terrible fellows. At the\r\nsiege of Rome they flung themselves at the assault like madmen. These\r\nlads are very devils.\" The officers avoided the gaze of the\r\nRepresentatives. On leaving the Mairie, M. de Coislin passed by an\r\nofficer and exclaimed, \"What a disgrace for the uniform!\" the officer\r\nretaliated with angry words, and incensed M. de Coislin. Shortly\r\nafterwards, during the march, he came up to M. de Coislin and said to\r\nhim, \"Sir, I have reflected; it is I who am wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded on the way slowly. At a few steps from the Mairie the\r\nprecession met M. Chegaray. The Representatives called out to him,\r\n\"Come!\" He answered, while making an expressive gesture with his hands\r\nand his shoulders, \"Oh! I dare say! As they have not arrested me....\" and\r\nhe feigned as though he would pass on. He was ashamed, however, and went\r\nwith them. His name is found in the list of the roll-call at the\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nA little further on M. de Lespérut passed them. They cried out to him.\r\n\"Lespérut! Lespérut!\" \"I am with you,\" answered he. The soldiers pushed\r\nhim back. He seized the butt-ends of the muskets, and forced his way into\r\nthe column.\r\n\r\nIn one of the streets through which they went a window was opened.\r\nSuddenly a woman appeared with a child; the child, recognizing its father\r\namongst the prisoners, held out its arms and called to him, the mother\r\nwept in the background.\r\n\r\nIt was at first intended to take the Assembly in a body straight to\r\nMazas, but this was counter-ordered by the Ministry of the Interior. It\r\nwas feared that this long walk, in broad daylight, through populous and\r\neasily aroused streets, might prove dangerous; the D'Orsay barracks were\r\nclose at hand. They selected these as a temporary prison.\r\n\r\nOne of the commanders insolently pointed out with his sword the arrested\r\nRepresentatives to the passers-by, and said in a fond voice, \"These are\r\nthe Whites, we have orders to spare them. Now it is the turn of the Red\r\nRepresentatives, let them look out for themselves!\"\r\n\r\nWherever the procession passed, the populace shouted from the pavements,\r\nat the doors, at the windows, \"Long live the National Assembly!\" When\r\nthey perceived a few Representatives of the Left sprinkled in the column\r\nthey cried, \"Vive la République!\" \"Vive la Constitution!\" and \"Vive la\r\nLoi!\" The shops were not shut, and passers-by went to and fro. Some\r\npeople said, \"Wait until the evening; this is not the end of it.\"\r\n\r\nA staff-officer on horseback, in full uniform, met the procession,\r\nrecognized M. de Vatimesnil, and came up to greet him. In the Rue de\r\nBeaune, as they passed the house of the _Démocratic Pacifique_ a group\r\nshouted, \"Down with the Traitor of the Elysée!\"\r\n\r\nOn the Quai d'Orsay, the shouting was redoubled. There was a great crowd\r\nthere. On either side of the quay a file of soldiers of the Line, elbow\r\nto elbow, kept back the spectators. In the middle of the space left\r\nvacant, the members of the Assembly slowly advanced between a double file\r\nof soldiers, the one stationary, which threatened the people, the other\r\non the march, which threatened tire Representatives.\r\n\r\nSerious reflections arise in the presence of all the details of the great\r\ncrime which this book is designed to relate. Every honest man who sets\r\nhimself face to face with the _coup d'état_ of Louis Bonaparte hears\r\nnothing but a tumult of indignant thoughts in his conscience. Whoever\r\nreads our work to the end will assuredly not credit us with the intention\r\nof extenuating this monstrous deed. Nevertheless, as the deep logic of\r\nactions ought always to be italicized by the historian, it is necessary\r\nhere to call to mind and to repeat, even to satiety, that apart from the\r\nmembers of the Left, of whom a very small number were present, and whom\r\nwe have mentioned by name, the three hundred Representatives who thus\r\ndefiled before the eyes of the crowd, constituted the old Royalists and\r\nreactionary majority of the Assembly. If it were possible to forget,\r\nthat--whatever were their errors, whatever were their faults, and, we\r\nventure to add, whatever were their illusions--these persons thus treated\r\nwere the Representatives of the leading civilized nation, were sovereign\r\nLegislators, senators of the people, inviolable Deputies, and sacred by\r\nthe great law of Democracy, and that in the same manner as each man bears\r\nin himself something of the mind of God, so each of these nominees of\r\nuniversal suffrage bore something of the soul of France; if it were\r\npossible to forget this for a moment, it assuredly would be a spectacle\r\nperhaps more laughable than sad, and certainly more philosophical than\r\nlamentable to see, on this December morning, after so many laws of\r\nrepression, after so many exceptional measures, after so many votes of\r\ncensure and of the state of siege, after so many refusals of amnesty,\r\nafter so many affronts to equity, to justice, to the human conscience, to\r\nthe public good faith, to right, after so many favors to the police,\r\nafter so many smiles bestowed on absolution, the entire Party of Order\r\narrested in a body and taken to prison by the _sergents de ville_!\r\n\r\nOne day, or rather, one night, the moment having come to save society,\r\nthe _coup d'état_ abruptly seizes the Demagogues, and finds that it holds\r\nby the collar, Whom? the Royalists.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the barracks, formerly the barracks of the Royal Guard,\r\nand on the pediment of which is a carved escutcheon, whereon are still\r\nvisible the traces of the three _fleurs de lis_ effaced in 1830. They\r\nhalted. The door was opened. \"Why!\" said M. de Broglie, \"here we are.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a great placard posted on the barrack wall by the side of\r\nthe door bore in big letters--\r\n\r\n  \"REVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the advertisement of a pamphlet, published two or three days\r\nprevious to the _coup d'état_, without any author's name, demanding the\r\nEmpire, and was attributed to the President of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives entered and the doors were closed upon them. The\r\nshouts ceased; the crowd, which occasionally has its meditative moments,\r\nremained for some time on the quay, dumb, motionless, gazing alternately\r\nat the closed gate of the Barracks, and at the silent front of the\r\nPalace of the Assembly, dimly visible in the misty December twilight,\r\ntwo hundred paces distant.\r\n\r\nThe two Commissaries of Police went to report their \"success\" to M. de\r\nMorny. M. de Morny said, \"Now the struggle has begun. Excellent! These\r\nare the last Representatives who will be made prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] The Gerontes, or Gerontia, were the Elders of Sparta, who constituted\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n[6] The \"bureau\" of the Assembly consists of the President, for the time\r\nbeing of the Assembly, assisted by six secretaries, whose duties mainly\r\nlie in deciding in what sense the Deputies have voted. The \"bureau\" of\r\nthe Assembly should not be confounded with the fifteen \"bureaux\" of the\r\nDeputies, which answer to our Select Committees of the House of Commons,\r\nand are presided over by self-chosen Presidents.\r\n\r\n[7] An allusion to the twenty-five francs a day officially payable to the\r\nmembers of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS BONAPARTE'S SIDE-FACE\r\n\r\nThe minds of all these men, we repeat, were very differently affected.\r\n\r\nThe extreme Legitimist party, which represents the White of the flag, was\r\nnot, it must be said, highly exasperated at the _coup d'état_. Upon many\r\nfaces might be read the saying of M. de Falloux: \"I am so satisfied that\r\nI have considerable difficulty in affecting to be only resigned.\" The\r\ningenuous spirits cast down their eyes--that is becoming to purity; more\r\ndaring spirits raised their heads. They felt an impartial indignation\r\nwhich permitted a little admiration. How cleverly these generals have\r\nbeen ensnared! The Country assassinated,--it is a horrible crime; but\r\nthey were enraptured at the jugglery blended with the parricide. One of\r\nthe leaders said, with a sigh of envy and regret, \"We do not possess a\r\nman of such talent.\" Another muttered, \"It is Order.\" And he added,\r\n\"Alas!\" Another exclaimed, \"It is a frightful crime, but well carried\r\nout.\" Some wavered, attracted on one side by the lawful power which\r\nrested in the Assembly, and on the other by the abomination which was in\r\nBonaparte; honest souls poised between duty and infamy. There was a M.\r\nThomines Desmazures who went as far as the door of the Great Hall of the\r\nMairie, halted, looked inside, looked outside, and did not enter. It\r\nwould be unjust not to record that others amongst the pure Royalists, and\r\nabove all M. de Vatimesnil, had the sincere intonation and the upright\r\nwrath of justice.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, the Legitimist party, taken as a whole, entertained no\r\nhorror of the _coup d'état_. It feared nothing. In truth, should the\r\nRoyalists fear Louis Bonaparte? Why?\r\n\r\nIndifference does not inspire fear. Louis Bonaparte was indifferent. He\r\nonly recognized one thing, his object. To break through the road in order\r\nto reach it, that was quite plain; the rest might be left alone. There\r\nlay the whole of his policy, to crush the Republicans, to disdain the\r\nRoyalists.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte had no passion. He who writes these lines, talking one\r\nday about Louis Bonaparte with the ex-king of Westphalia, remarked, \"In\r\nhim the Dutchman tones down the Corsican.\"--\"If there be any Corsican,\"\r\nanswered Jérome.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte has never been other than a man who has lain wait for\r\nfortune, a spy trying to dupe God. He had that livid dreaminess of the\r\ngambler who cheats. Cheating admits audacity, but excludes anger. In his\r\nprison at Ham he only read one book, \"The Prince.\" He belonged to no\r\nfamily, as he could hesitate between Bonaparte and Verhuell; he had no\r\ncountry, as he could hesitate between France and Holland.\r\n\r\nThis Napoleon had taken St. Helena in good part. He admired England.\r\nResentment! To what purpose? For him on earth there only existed his\r\ninterests. He pardoned, because he speculated; he forgot everything,\r\nbecause he calculated upon everything. What did his uncle matter to him?\r\nHe did not serve him; he made use of him. He rested his shabby enterprise\r\nupon Austerlitz. He stuffed the eagle.\r\n\r\nMalice is an unproductive outlay. Louis Bonaparte only possessed as much\r\nmemory as is useful. Hudson Lowe did not prevent him from smiling upon\r\nEnglishmen; the Marquis of Montchenu did not prevent him from smiling\r\nupon the Royalists.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of earnest politics, of good company, wrapped in his own\r\nscheming, not impulsive, doing nothing beyond that which he intended,\r\nwithout abruptness, without hard words, discreet, accurate, learned,\r\ntalking smoothly of a necessary massacre, a slaughterer, because it\r\nserved his purpose.\r\n\r\nAll this, we repeat, without passion, and without anger. Louis Bonaparte\r\nwas one of those men who had been influenced by the profound iciness of\r\nMachiavelli.\r\n\r\nIt was through being a man of that nature that he succeeded in submerging\r\nthe name of Napoleon by superadding December upon Brumaire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE D'ORSAY BARRACKS\r\n\r\nIt was half-past three.\r\n\r\nThe arrested Representatives entered into the courtyard of the barracks,\r\na huge parallelogram closed in and commanded by high walls. These walls\r\nare pierced by three tiers of windows, and posses that dismal appearance\r\nwhich distinguishes barracks, schools, and prisons.\r\n\r\nThis courtyard is entered by an arched portal which extends through all\r\nthe breadth of the front of the main building. This archway, under which\r\nthe guard-house has been made, is close on the side of the quay by large\r\nsolid folding doors, and on one side of the courtyard by an iron grated\r\ngateway. They closed the door and the grated gateway upon the\r\nRepresentatives. They \"set them at liberty\" in the bolted and guarded\r\ncourtyard.\r\n\r\n\"Let them stroll about,\" said an officer.\r\n\r\nThe air was cold, the sky was gray. Some soldiers, in their shirt-sleeves\r\nand wearing foraging caps, busy with fatigue duty, went hither and\r\nthither amongst the prisoners.\r\n\r\nFirst M. Grimault and then M. Antony Thouret instituted a roll-call. The\r\nRepresentatives made a ring around them. Lherbette said laughingly, \"This\r\njust suits the barracks. We look like sergeant-majors who have come to\r\nreport.\" They called over the seven hundred and fifty names of the\r\nRepresentatives. To each name they answered \"Absent\" or \"Present,\" and\r\nthe secretary jotted down with a pencil those who were present. When the\r\nname of Morny was reached, some one cried out, \"At Clichy!\" At the name\r\nof Persigny, the same voice exclaimed, \"At Poissy!\" The inventor of these\r\ntwo jokes, which by the way are very poor, has since allied himself to\r\nthe Second of December, to Morny and Persigny; he has covered his\r\ncowardice with the embroidery of a senator.\r\n\r\nThe roll-call verified the presence of two hundred and twenty\r\nRepresentatives, whose names were as follows:--\r\n\r\nLe Duc de Luynes, d'Andigné de la Chasse, Antony Thouret, Arène, Audren\r\nde Kerdrel (Ille-et-Vilaine), Audren de Kerdrel (Morbihan), de Balzac,\r\nBarchou de Penhoen, Barillon, O.

(Hear! hear!)\r\nDo you wish me to bring the Adjutant-Major here! (No, no; it is useless.)\r\nI will tell him that he had better execute his orders.' (Yes, yes, that\r\nis right.)\"\r\n\r\nThe Representatives remained \"penned\" and \"strolling\" about in this yard\r\nfor two long hours. They walked about arm in arm. They walked quickly, so\r\nas to warm themselves. The men of the Right said to the men of the Left,\r\n\"Ah! if you had only voted the proposals of the Questors!\" They also\r\nexclaimed: \"Well, how about the _invisible sentry_!\"[8] And they laughed.\r\nThen Marc Dufraisse answered, \"Deputies of the People! deliberate in\r\npeace!\" It was then the turn of the Left to laugh. Nevertheless, there\r\nwas no bitterness. The cordiality of a common misfortune reigned amongst\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey questioned his ex-ministers about Louis Bonaparte. They asked\r\nAdmiral Cécile, \"Now, really, what does this mean?\" The Admiral answered\r\nby this definition: \"It is a small matter.\" M. Vézin added, \"He wishes\r\nHistory to call him 'Sire.'\" \"Poor Sire, then,\" said M. de Camas de la\r\nGuibourgère. M. Odilon Barrot exclaimed, \"What a fatality, that we should\r\nhave been condemned to employ this man!\"\r\n\r\nThis said, these heights attained, political philosophy was exhausted,\r\nand they ceased talking.\r\n\r\nOn the right, by the side of the door, there was a canteen elevated a few\r\nsteps above the courtyard. \"Let us promote this canteen to the dignity of\r\na refreshment room,\" said the ex-ambassador to China, M. de Lagrenée.\r\nThey entered, some went up to the stove, others asked for a basin of\r\nsoup. MM. Favreau, Piscatory, Larabit, and Vatimesnil took refuge in a\r\ncorner. In the opposite corner drunken soldiers chatted with the maids of\r\nthe barracks. M. de Kératry, bent with his eighty years, was seated near\r\nthe stove on an old worm-eaten chair; the chair tottered; the old man\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\nTowards four o'clock a regiment of Chasseurs de Vincennes arrived in the\r\ncourtyard with their platters, and began to eat, singing, with loud\r\nbursts of merriment. M. de Broglie looked at them and said to M.\r\nPiscatory, \"It is a strange spectacle to see the porringers of the\r\nJanissaries vanished from Constantinople reappearing at Paris!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment a staff officer informed the Representatives on\r\nbehalf of General Forey that the apartments assigned to them were ready,\r\nand requested them to follow him. They were taken into the eastern\r\nbuilding, which is the wing of the barracks farthest from the Palace of\r\nthe Council of State; they were conducted to the third floor. They\r\nexpected chambers and beds. They found long rooms, vast garrets with\r\nfilthy walls and low ceilings, furnished with wooden tables and benches.\r\nThese were the \"apartments.\" These garrets, which adjoin each other, all\r\nopen on the same corridor, a narrow passage, which runs the length of the\r\nmain building. In one of these rooms they saw, thrown into a corner,\r\nside-drums, a big drum, and various instruments of military music. The\r\nRepresentatives scattered themselves about in these rooms. M. de\r\nTocqueville, who was ill, threw his overcoat on the floor in the recess\r\nof a window, and lay down. He remained thus stretched upon the ground for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\nThese rooms were warmed very badly by cast-iron stoves, shaped like\r\nhives. A Representative wishing to poke the fire, upset one, and nearly\r\nset fire to the wooden flooring.\r\n\r\nThe last of these rooms looked out on the quay. Antony Thouret opened a\r\nwindow and leaned out. Several Representatives joined him. The soldiers\r\nwho were bivouacking below on the pavement, caught sight of them and\r\nbegan to shout, \"Ah! there they are, those rascals at 'twenty-five francs\r\na day,' who wish to cut down our pay!\" In fact, on the preceding evening,\r\nthe police had spread this calumny through the barracks that a\r\nproposition had been placed on the Tribune to lessen the pay of the\r\ntroops. They had even gone so far as to name the author of this\r\nproposition. Antony Thouret attempted to undeceive the soldiers. An\r\nofficer cried out to him, \"It is one of your party who made the proposal.\r\nIt is Lamennais!\"\r\n\r\nIn about an hour and a half there were ushered into these rooms MM.\r\nVallette, Bixio, and Victor Lefranc, who had come to join their\r\ncolleagues and constitute themselves prisoners.\r\n\r\nNight came. They were hungry. Several had not eaten since the morning. M.\r\nHowyn de Tranchère, a man of considerable kindness and devotion, who had\r\nacted as porter at the Mairie, acted as forager at the barracks. He\r\ncollected five francs from each Representative, and they sent and ordered\r\na dinner for two hundred and twenty from the Café d'Orsay, at the corner\r\nof the Quay, and the Rue du Bac. They dined badly, but merrily. Cookshop\r\nmutton, bad wine, and cheese. There was no bread. They ate as they best\r\ncould, one standing, another on a chair, one at a table, another astride\r\non his bench, with his plate before him, \"as at a ball-room supper,\" a\r\ndandy of the Right said laughingly, Thuriot de la Rosière, son of the\r\nregicide Thuriot. M. de Rémusat buried his head in his hands. Emile Péan\r\nsaid to him, \"We shall get over it.\" And Gustave de Beaumont cried out,\r\naddressing himself to the Republicans, \"And your friends of the Left!\r\nWill they preserve their honor? Will there be an insurrection at least?\"\r\nThey passed each other the dishes and plates, the Right showing marked\r\nattention to the Left. \"Here is the opportunity to bring about a fusion,\"\r\nsaid a young Legitimist. Troopers and canteen men waited upon them. Two\r\nor three tallow candles burnt and smoked on each table. There were few\r\nglasses. Right and Left drank from the same. \"Equality, fraternity,\"\r\nexclaimed the Marquis Sauvaire-Barthélemy, of the Right. And Victor\r\nHannequin answered him, \"But not Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Feray, the son-in-law of Marshal Bugeaud, was in command at the\r\nbarracks; he offered the use of his drawing-room to M. de Broglie and to\r\nM. Odilon Barrot, who accepted it. The barrack doors were opened to M. de\r\nKératry, on account of his great age, to M. Dufaure, as his wife had just\r\nbeen confined, and to M. Etienne, on account of the wound which he had\r\nreceived that morning in the Rue de Bourgogne. At the same time there\r\nwere added to the two hundred and twenty MM. Eugène Sue, Benoist (du\r\nRhône), Fayolle, Chanay, Toupet des Vignes, Radoubt-Lafosse, Arbey, and\r\nTeillard-Latérisse, who up to that time had been detained in the new\r\nPalace of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nTowards eight o'clock in the evening, when dinner was over, the\r\nrestrictions were a little relaxed, and the intermediate space between\r\nthe door and the barred gate of the barracks began to be littered with\r\ncarpet bags and articles of toilet sent by the families of the imprisoned\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives were summoned by their names. Each went down in turn,\r\nand briskly remounted with his cloak, his coverlet, or his foot-warmer. A\r\nfew ladies succeeded in making their way to their husbands. M.M. Chambolle\r\nwas able to press his son's hand through the bars.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice called out, \"Oho! We are going to spend the night here.\"\r\nMattresses were brought in, which were thrown on the tables, on the\r\nfloor, anywhere.\r\n\r\nFifty or sixty Representatives found resting-places on them. The greater\r\nnumber remained on their benches. Marc Dufraisse settled himself to pass\r\nthe night on a footstool, leaning on a table. Happy was the man who had a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, cordiality and gaiety did not cease to prevail. \"Make room\r\nfor the 'Burgraves!'\" said smilingly a venerable veteran of the Right. A\r\nyoung Republican Representative rose, and offered him his mattress. They\r\npressed on each offers of overcoats, cloaks, and coverlets.\r\n\r\n\"Reconciliation,\" said Chamiot, while offering the half of his mattress\r\nto the Duc de Luynes. The Duc de Luynes, who had 80,000 francs a year,\r\nsmiled, and replied to Chamiot, \"You are St. Martin, and I am the beggar.\"\r\n\r\nM. Paillet, the well-known barrister, who belonged to the \"Third Estate,\"\r\nused to say, \"I passed the night on a Bonapartist straw mattress, wrapped\r\nin a burnouse of the Mountain, my feet in a Democratic and Socialist\r\nsheepskin, and my head in a Legitimist cotton nightcap.\" The\r\nRepresentatives, although prisoners in the barracks, could stroll about\r\nfreely. They were allowed to go down into the courtyard. M. Cordier (of\r\nCalvados) came upstairs again, saying, \"I have just spoken to the\r\nsoldiers. They did not know that their generals had been arrested. They\r\nappeared surprised and discontented.\" This incident raised the prisoners'\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Michel Renaud of the Basses-Pyrénees, found several of his\r\ncompatriots of the Basque country amongst the Chasseurs de Vincennes who\r\noccupied the courtyard. Some had voted for him, and reminded him of the\r\nfact. They added, \"Ah! We would again vote for the 'Red' list.\" One of\r\nthem, quite a young man, took him aside, and said to him. \"Do you want\r\nany money, sir? I have a forty-sous piece in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nTowards ten o'clock in the evening a great hubbub arose in the courtyard.\r\nThe doors and the barred gate turned noisily upon their hinges. Something\r\nentered which rumbled like thunder. They leaned out of window, and saw at\r\nthe foot of the steps a sort of big, oblong chest, painted black, yellow,\r\nred, and green, on four wheels, drawn by post-horses, and surrounded by\r\nmen in long overcoats, and with fierce-looking faces, holding torches. In\r\nthe gloom, and with the help of imagination, this vehicle appeared\r\ncompletely black. A door could be seen, but no other opening. It\r\nresembled a great coffin on wheels. \"What is that? Is it a hearse?\" \"No,\r\nit is a police-van.\" \"And those people, are they undertakers?\" \"No, they\r\nare jailers.\" \"And for whom has this come?\"\r\n\r\n\"For you, gentlemen!\" cried out a voice.\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of an officer; and the vehicle which had just entered\r\nwas in truth a police-van.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a word of command was heard: \"First squadron to horse.\"\r\nAnd five minutes afterwards the Lancers who were to escort the vehicle\r\nformed in line in the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThen arose in the barracks the buzz of a hive of angry bees. The\r\nRepresentatives ran up and down the stairs, and went to look at the\r\npolice-van close at hand. Some of them touched it, and could not believe\r\ntheir eyes. M. Piscatory met M. Chambolle, and cried out to him, \"I am\r\nleaving in it!\" M. Berryer met Eugène Sue, and they exchanged these\r\nwords: \"Where are you going?\" \"To Mount Valérien. And you?\" \"I do not\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten the roll-call of those who were to leave began. Police\r\nagents stationed themselves at a table between two candles in a parlor at\r\nthe foot of the stairs, and the Representatives were summoned two by two.\r\nThe Representatives agreed not to answer to their names, and to reply to\r\neach name which should be called out, \"He is not here.\" But those\r\n\"Burgraves\" who had accepted the hospitality of Colonel Feray considered\r\nsuch petty resistance unworthy of them, and answered to the calling out\r\nof their names. This drew the others after them. Everybody answered.\r\nAmongst the Legitimists some serio-comic scenes were enacted. They who\r\nalone were not threatened insisted on believing that they were in danger.\r\nThey would not let one of their orators go. They embraced him, and held\r\nhim back, almost with tears, crying out, \"Do not go away! Do you know\r\nwhere they are taking you? Think of the trenches of Vincennes!\"\r\n\r\nThe Representatives, having been summoned two by two, as we have just\r\nsaid, filed in the parlor before the police agents, and then they were\r\nordered to get into the \"robbers' box.\" The stowage was apparently made\r\nat haphazard and promiscuously; nevertheless, later, by the difference\r\nof the treatment accorded to the Representatives in the various prisons,\r\nit was apparent that this promiscuous loading had perhaps been somewhat\r\nprearranged. When the first vehicle was full, a second, of a similar\r\nconstruction drew up. The police agents, pencil and pocket-book in\r\nhand, noted down the contents of each vehicle. These men knew the\r\nRepresentatives. When Marc Dufraisse, called in his turn, entered the\r\nparlor, he was accompanied by Benoist (du Rhône). \"Ah! here is Marc\r\nDufraisse,\" said the attendant who held the pencil. When asked for his\r\nname, Benoist replied \"Benoist.\" \"Du Rhône,\" added the police agent; and\r\nhe continued, \"for there are also Benoist d'Azy and Benoist-Champy.\"\r\n\r\nThe loading of each vehicle occupied nearly half an hour. The successive\r\narrivals had raised the number of imprisoned Representatives to two\r\nhundred and thirty-two Their embarkation, or, to use the expression of M.\r\nde Vatimesnil, their \"barrelling up,\" which began a little after ten in\r\nthe evening, was not finished until nearly seven o'clock in the morning.\r\nWhen there were no more police-vans available omnibuses were brought in.\r\nThese various vehicles were portioned off into three detachments, each\r\nescorted by Lancers. The first detachment left towards one o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and was driven to Mont Valérien; the second towards five\r\no'clock, and was driven to Mazas; the third towards half-past six, to\r\nVincennes.\r\n\r\nAs this business occupied a long time, those who had not yet been called\r\nbenefited by the mattresses and tried to sleep. Thus, from time to time,\r\nsilence reigned in the upper rooms. In the midst of one of these pauses\r\nM. Bixio sat upright, and raising his voice, cried out, \"Gentlemen, what\r\ndo you think of 'passive obedience'?\" An unanimous burst of laughter was\r\nthe reply. Again, during one of these pauses another voice exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"Romieu will be a senator.\"\r\n\r\nEmile Péan asked,--\r\n\r\n\"What will become of the Red Spectre?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will enter the priesthood,\" answered Antony Thouret, \"and will turn\r\ninto the Black Spectre.\"\r\n\r\nOther exclamations which the historians of the Second of December have\r\nspread abroad were not uttered. Thus, Marc Dufraisse never made the\r\nremark with which the men of Louis Bonaparte have wished to excuse their\r\ncrimes: \"If the President does not shoot all those among us who resist,\r\nhe does not understand his business.\"\r\n\r\nFor the _coup d'état_ such a remark might be convenient; but for History\r\nit is false.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the police-vans was lighted while the Representatives\r\nwere entering. The air-holes of each compartment were not closed. In this\r\nmanner Marc Dufraisse through the aperture could see M. du Rémusat in the\r\nopposite cell to his own. M. du Rémusat had entered the van coupled with\r\nM. Duvergier de Hauranne.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Monsieur Marc Dufraisse,\" exclaimed Duvergier de Hauranne\r\nwhen they jostled each other in the gangway of the vehicle, \"upon my\r\nword, if any one had said to me, 'You will go to Marzas in a police-van,'\r\nI should have said, 'It is improbable;' but if they had added, 'You will\r\ngo with Marc Dufraisse,' I should have said, 'It is impossible!'\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the vehicle was full, five or six policemen entered and stood\r\nin the gangway. The door was shut, the steps were thrown up, and they\r\ndrove off.\r\n\r\nWhen all the police-vans had been filled, there were still some\r\nRepresentatives left. As we have said, omnibuses were brought into\r\nrequisition. Into these Representatives were thrust, one upon the other,\r\nrudely, without deference for either age or name. Colonel Feray, on\r\nhorseback, superintended and directed operations. As he mounted the steps\r\nof the last vehicle but one, the Duc de Montebello cried out to him,\r\n\"To-day is the anniversary of the battle of Austerlitz, and the\r\nson-in-law of Marshal Bugeaud compels the son of Marshal Lannes to enter\r\na convict's van.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the last omnibus was reached, there were only seventeen places for\r\neighteen Representatives. The most active mounted first. Antony Thouret,\r\nwho himself alone equalled the whole of the Right, for he had as much\r\nmind as Thiers and as much stomach as Murat; Antony Thouret, corpulent\r\nand lethargic, was the last. When he appeared on the threshold of the\r\nomnibus in all his hugeness, a cry of alarm arose;--Where was he going to\r\nsit?\r\n\r\nAntony Thouret, noticing Berryer at the bottom of the omnibus, went\r\nstraight up to him, sat down on his knees, and quietly said to him, \"You\r\nwanted 'compression,' Monsieur Berryer. Now you have it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] Michel de Bourges had thus characterized Louis Bonaparte as the\r\nguardian of the Republic against the Monarchical parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZAS\r\n\r\nThe police-vans, escorted as far as Mazas by Lancers, found another\r\nsquadron of Lancers ready to receive them at Mazas. The Representatives\r\ndescended from the vehicle one by one. The officer commanding the Lancers\r\nstood by the door, and watched them pass with a dull curiosity.\r\n\r\nMazas, which had taken the place of the prison of La Force, now pulled\r\ndown, is a lofty reddish building, close to the terminus of the Lyons\r\nRailway, and stands on the waste land of the Faubourg St. Antoine. From a\r\ndistance the building appears as though built of bricks, but on closer\r\nexamination it is seen to be constructed of flints set in cement. Six\r\nlarge detached buildings, three stories high, all radiating from a\r\nrotunda which serves as the common centre, and touching each other at the\r\nstarting-point, separated by courtyards which grow broader in proportion\r\nas the buildings spread out, pierced with a thousand little dormer\r\nwindows which give light to the cells, surrounded by a high wall, and\r\npresenting from a bird's-eye point of view the drape of a fan--such is\r\nMazas. From the rotunda which forms the centre, springs a sort of\r\nminaret, which is the alarm-tower. The ground floor is a round room,\r\nwhich serves as the registrar's office. On the first story is a chapel\r\nwhere a single priest says mass for all; and the observatory, where a\r\nsingle attendant keeps watch over all the doors of all the galleries at\r\nthe same time. Each building is termed a \"division.\" The courtyards are\r\nintersected by high walls into a multitude of little oblong walks.\r\n\r\nAs each Representative descended from the vehicle he was conducted into\r\nthe rotunda where the registry office was situated. There his name was\r\ntaken down, and in exchange for his name he was assigned a number.\r\nWhether the prisoner be a thief or a legislator, such is always the rule\r\nin this prison; the _coup d'état_ reduced all to a footing of equality.\r\nAs soon as a Representative was registered and numbered, he was ordered\r\nto \"file off.\" They said to him, \"Go upstairs,\" or \"Go on;\" and they\r\nannounced him at the end of the corridor to which he was allotted by\r\ncalling out, \"Receive number So-and-So.\" The jailer in that particular\r\ncorridor answered, \"Send him on.\" The prisoner mounted alone, went\r\nstraight on, and on his arrival found the jailer standing near an open\r\ndoor. The jailer said, \"Here it is, sir.\" The prisoner entered, the\r\njailer shut the door, and they passed on to another.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ acted in a very different manner towards the various\r\nRepresentatives. Those whom it desired to conciliate, the men of the\r\nBight, were placed in Vincennes; those whom it detested, the men of the\r\nLeft, were placed in Mazas. Those at Vincennes had the quarters of M.\r\nMontpensier, which were expressly reopened for them; an excellent dinner,\r\neaten in company; wax candles, fire, and the smiles and bows of the\r\ngovernor, General Courtigis.\r\n\r\nThis is how it treated those at Mazas.\r\n\r\nA police-van deposited them at the prison. They were transferred from one\r\nbox to another. At Mazas a clerk registered them, weighed them, measured\r\nthem, and entered them into the jail book as convicts. Having passed\r\nthrough the office, each of them was conducted along a gallery shrouded\r\nin darkness, through a long damp vault to a narrow door which was\r\nsuddenly opened. This reached, a jailer pushed the Representative in by\r\nthe shoulders, and the door was shut.\r\n\r\nThe Representative, thus immured, found himself in a little, long,\r\nnarrow, dark room. It is this which the prudent language of modern\r\nlegislation terms a \"cell.\" Here the full daylight of a December noon\r\nonly produced a dusky twilight. At one end there was a door, with a\r\nlittle grating; at the other, close to the ceiling, at a height of ten or\r\ntwelve feet, there was a loophole with a fluted glass window. This window\r\ndimmed the eye, and prevented it from seeing the blue or gray of the sky,\r\nor from distinguishing the cloud from the sun's ray, and invested the wan\r\ndaylight of winter with an indescribable uncertainty. It was even less\r\nthan a dim light, it was a turbid light. The inventors of this fluted\r\nwindow succeeded in making the heavens squint.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments the prisoner began to distinguish objects confusedly,\r\nand this is what he found: White-washed walls here and there turned green\r\nby various exhalations; in one corner a round hole guarded by iron bars,\r\nand exhaling a disgusting smell; in another corner a slab turning upon a\r\nhinge like the bracket seat of a _fiacre_, and thus capable of being used\r\nas a table; no bed; a straw-bottomed chair; under foot a brick floor.\r\nGloom was the first impression; cold was the second. There, then, the\r\nprisoner found himself, alone, chilled, in this semi-darkness, being able\r\nto walk up and down the space of eight square feet like a caged wolf, or\r\nto remain seated on his chair like an idiot at Bicêtre.\r\n\r\nIn this situation an ex-Republican of the Eve, who had become a member of\r\nthe majority, and on occasions sided somewhat with the Bonapartists, M.\r\nEmile Leroux, who had, moreover, been thrown into Mazas by mistake,\r\nhaving doubtless been taken for some other Leroux, began to weep with\r\nrage. Three, four, five hours thus passed away. In the meanwhile they had\r\nnot eaten since the morning; some of them, in the excitement caused by\r\nthe _coup d'état_ had not even breakfasted. Hunger came upon them. Were\r\nthey to be forgotten there? No; a bell rang in the prison, the grating of\r\nthe door opened, and an arm held out to the prisoner a pewter porringer\r\nand a piece of bread.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner greedily seized the bread and the porringer. The bread was\r\nblack and sticky; the porringer contained a sort of thick water, warm and\r\nreddish. Nothing can be compared to the smell of this \"soup.\" As for the\r\nbread, it only smelt of mouldiness.\r\n\r\nHowever great their hunger, most of the prisoners during the first moment\r\nthrew down their bread on the floor, and emptied the porringer down the\r\nhole with the iron bars.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the stomach craved, the hours passed by, they picked up the\r\nbread, and ended by eating it. One prisoner went so far as to pick up the\r\nporringer and to attempt to wipe out the bottom with his bread, which he\r\nafterwards devoured. Subsequently, this prisoner, a Representative set at\r\nliberty in exile, described to me this dietary, and said to me, \"A hungry\r\nstomach has no nose.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was absolute solitude and profound silence. However, in\r\nthe course of a few hours, M. Emile Leroux--he himself has told the fact\r\nto M. Versigny--heard on the other side of the wall on his right a sort\r\nof curious knocking, spaced out and intermittent at irregular intervals.\r\nHe listened, and almost at the same moment on the other side of the wall\r\nto his left a similar rapping responded. M. Emile Leroux,\r\nenraptured--what a pleasure it was to hear a noise of some kind!--thought\r\nof his colleagues, prisoners like himself, and cried out in a tremendous\r\nvoice, \"Oh, oh! you are there also, you fellows!\" He had scarcely uttered\r\nthis sentence when the door of his cell was opened with a creaking of\r\nhinges and bolts; a man--the jailer--appeared in a great rage, and said\r\nto him,--\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue!\"\r\n\r\nThe Representative of the People, somewhat bewildered, asked for an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue,\" replied the jailer, \"or I will pitch you into a\r\ndungeon.\"\r\n\r\nThis jailer spoke to the prisoner as the _coup d'état_ spoke to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nM. Emile Leroux, with his persistent parliamentary habits, nevertheless\r\nattempted to insist.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said he, \"can I not answer the signals which two of my colleagues\r\nare making to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two of your colleagues, indeed,\" answered the jailer, \"they are two\r\nthieves.\" And he shut the door, shouting with laughter.\r\n\r\nThey were, in fact, two thieves, between whom M. Emile Leroux was, not\r\ncrucified, but locked up.\r\n\r\nThe Mazas prison is so ingeniously built that the least word can be\r\nheard from one cell to another. Consequently there is no isolation,\r\nnotwithstanding the cellular system. Thence this rigorous silence imposed\r\nby the perfect and cruel logic of the rules. What do the thieves do? They\r\nhave invented a telegraphic system of raps, and the rules gain nothing by\r\ntheir stringency. M. Emile Leroux had simply interrupted a conversation\r\nwhich had been begun.\r\n\r\n\"Don't interfere with our friendly patter,\" cried out his thief neighbor,\r\nwho for this exclamation was thrown into the dungeon.\r\n\r\nSuch was the life of the Representatives at Mazas. Moreover, as they were\r\nin secret confinement, not a book, not a sheet of paper, not a pen, not\r\neven an hour's exercise in the courtyard was allowed to them.\r\n\r\nThe thieves also go to Mazas, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nBut those who know a trade are permitted to work; those who know how to\r\nread are supplied with books; those who know how to write are granted a\r\ndesk and paper; all are permitted the hour's exercise required by the\r\nlaws of health and authorized by the rules.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives were allowed nothing whatever. Isolation, close\r\nconfinement, silence, darkness, cold, \"the amount of _ennui_ which\r\nengenders madness,\" as Linguet has said when speaking of the Bastille.\r\n\r\nTo remain seated on a chair all day long, with arms and legs crossed:\r\nsuch was the situation. But the bed! Could they lie down?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThere was no bed.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the evening the jailer came into the cell, and\r\nreached down, and removed something which was rolled up on a plank near\r\nthe ceiling. This \"something\" was a hammock.\r\n\r\nThe hammock having been fixed, hooked up, and spread out, the jailer\r\nwished his prisoner \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a blanket on the hammock, sometimes a mattress some two inches\r\nthick. The prisoner, wrapt in this covering, tried to sleep, and only\r\nsucceeded in shivering.\r\n\r\nBut on the morrow he could at least remain lying down all day in his\r\nhammock?\r\n\r\nNot at all.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock in the morning the jailer came in, wished the\r\nRepresentative \"Good-morning,\" made him get up, and rolled up the hammock\r\non its shelf near the ceiling.\r\n\r\nBut in this case could not the prisoner take down the authorized hammock,\r\nunroll it, hook it up, and lie down again?\r\n\r\nYes, he could. But then there was the dungeon.\r\n\r\nThis was the routine. The hammock for the night, the chair for the day.\r\n\r\nLet us be just, however. Some obtained beds, amongst others MM. Thiers\r\nand Roger (du Nord). M. Grévy did not have one.\r\n\r\nMazas is a model prison of progress; it is certain that Mazas is\r\npreferable to the _piombi_ of Venice, and to the under-water dungeon of\r\nthe Châtelet. Theoretical philanthropy has built Mazas. Nevertheless, as\r\nhas been seen, Mazas leaves plenty to be desired. Let us acknowledge that\r\nfrom a certain point of view the temporary solitary confinement of the\r\nlaw-makers at Mazas does not displease us. There was perhaps something of\r\nProvidence in the _coup d'état_. Providence, in placing the Legislators\r\nat Mazas, has performed an act of good education. Eat of your own\r\ncooking; it is not a bad thing that those who own prisons should try them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EPISODE OF THE BOULEVARD ST. MARTIN\r\n\r\nWhen Charamaule and I reached No. 70, Rue Blanche, a steep lonely street,\r\na man in a sort of naval sub-officer's uniform, was walking up and down\r\nbefore the door. The portress, who recognized us, called our attention to\r\nhim. \"Nonsense,\" said Charamaule, \"a man walking about in that manner,\r\nand dressed after that fashion, is assuredly not a police spy.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear colleague,\" said I, \"Bedeau has proved that the police are\r\nblockheads.\"\r\n\r\nWe went upstairs. The drawing-room and a little ante-chamber which led to\r\nit were full of Representatives, with whom were mingled a good many\r\npersons who did not belong to the Assembly. Some ex-members of the\r\nConstituent Assembly were there, amongst others, Bastide and several\r\nDemocratic journalists. The _Nationale_ was represented by Alexander Rey\r\nand Léopold Duras, the _Révolution_ by Xavier Durrieu, Vasbenter, and\r\nWatripon, the _Avénement du Peuple_ by H. Coste, nearly all the other\r\neditors of the _Avénement_ being in prison. About sixty members of the\r\nLeft were there, and among others Edgar Quinet, Schoelcher, Madier de\r\nMontjau, Carnot, Noël Parfait, Pierre Lefranc, Bancel, de Flotte,\r\nBruckner, Chaix, Cassal, Esquiros, Durand-Savoyat, Yvan, Carlos Forel,\r\nEtchegoyen, Labrousse, Barthélemy (Eure-et-Loire), Huguenin, Aubrey (du\r\nNord), Malardier, Victor Chauffour, Belin, Renaud, Bac, Versigny, Sain,\r\nJoigneaux, Brives, Guilgot, Pelletier, Doutre, Gindrier, Arnauld (de\r\nl'Ariége), Raymond (de l'Isère), Brillier, Maigne, Sartin, Raynaud, Léon\r\nVidal, Lafon, Lamargue, Bourzat, and General Rey.\r\n\r\nAll were standing. They were talking without order. Léopold Duras had\r\njust described the investment of the Café Bonvalet. Jules Favre and\r\nBaudin, seated at a little table between the two windows, were writing.\r\nBaudin had a copy of the Constitution open before him, and was copying\r\nArticle 68.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered there was silence, and they asked us, \"Well, what news?\"\r\n\r\nCharamaule told them what had just taken place on the Boulevard du\r\nTemple, and the advice which he had thought right to give me. They\r\napproved his action.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" was asked on every side. I began to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go straight to the fact and to the point,\" said I. \"Louis\r\nBonaparte is gaining ground, and we are losing ground, or rather, we\r\nshould say, he has as yet everything, and we have as yet nothing.\r\nCharamaule and I have been obliged to separate ourselves from Colonel\r\nForestier. I doubt if he will succeed. Louis Bonaparte is doing all he\r\ncan to suppress us, we must no longer keep in the background. We must\r\nmake our presence felt. We must fan this beginning of the flame of which\r\nwe have seen the spark on the Boulevard du Temple. A proclamation must be\r\nmade, no matter by whom it is printed, or how it is placarded, but it is\r\nabsolutely necessary, and that immediately. Something brief, rapid, and\r\nenergetic. No set phrases. Ten lines--an appeal to arms! We are the Law,\r\nand there are occasions when the Law should utter a war-cry. The Law,\r\noutlawing the traitor, is a great and terrible thing. Let us do it.\"\r\n\r\nThey interrupted me with \"Yes, that is right, a proclamation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dictate! dictate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dictate,\" said Baudin to me, \"I will write.\"\r\n\r\nI dictated:-\r\n\r\n  \"TO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n  \"Louis Napoléon Bonaparte is a traitor.\r\n\r\n  \"He has violated the Constitution.\r\n\r\n  \"He is forsworn.\r\n\r\n  \"He is an outlaw--\"\r\n\r\nThey cried out to me on every side,--\r\n\r\n\"That is right! Outlaw him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\nI resumed the dictation. Baudin wrote,--\r\n\r\n  \"The Republican Representatives refer the People and the Army to Article\r\n  68--\"\r\n\r\nThey interrupted me: \"Quote it in full.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I, \"it would be too long. Something is needed which can be\r\nplacarded on a card, stuck with a wafer, and which can be read in a\r\nminute. I will quote Article 110. It is short and contains the appeal to\r\narms.\"\r\n\r\nI resumed,--\r\n\r\n  \"The Republican Representatives refer the People and the Army to Article\r\n  68 and to Article 110, which runs thus--'The Constituent Assembly\r\n  confides the existing Constitution and the Laws which it consecrates to\r\n  the keeping and the patriotism of all Frenchmen.'\r\n\r\n  \"The People henceforward and for ever in possession of universal\r\n  suffrages and who need no Prince for its restitution, will know how to\r\n  chastise the rebel.\r\n\r\n  \"Let the People do its duty. The Republican Representatives are marching\r\n  at its head.\r\n\r\n  \"Vive la République! To Arms!\"\r\n\r\nThey applauded.\r\n\r\n\"Let us all sign,\" said Pelletier.\r\n\r\n\"Let us try to find a printing-office without delay,\" said Schoelcher,\r\n\"and let the proclamation be posted up immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before nightfall--the days are short,\" added Joigneaux.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately, immediately, several copies!\" called out the\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nBaudin, silent and rapid, had already made a second copy of the\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nA young man, editor of the provincial Republican journal, came out of the\r\ncrowd, and declared that, if they would give him a copy at once, before\r\ntwo hours should elapse the Proclamation should be posted at all the\r\nstreet corners in Paris.\r\n\r\nI asked him,--\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered me,--\r\n\r\n\"Millière.\"\r\n\r\nMillière. It is in this manner that this name made its first appearance\r\nin the gloomy days of our History. I can still see that pale young man,\r\nthat eye at the same time piercing and half closed, that gentle and\r\nforbidding profile. Assassination and the Pantheon awaited him. He was\r\ntoo obscure to enter into the Temple, he was sufficiently deserving to\r\ndie on its threshold. Baudin showed him the copy which he had just made.\r\n\r\nMillière went up to him.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know me,\" said he; \"my name is Millière; but I know you, you\r\nare Baudin.\"\r\n\r\nBaudin held out his hand to him.\r\n\r\nI was present at the handshaking between these two spectres.\r\n\r\nXavier Durrieu, who was editor of the _Révolution_ made the same offer as\r\nMillière.\r\n\r\nA dozen Representatives took their pens and sat down, some around a\r\ntable, others with a sheet of paper on their knees, and called out to\r\nme,--\r\n\r\n\"Dictate the Proclamation to us.\"\r\n\r\nI had dictated to Baudin, \"Louis Napoléon Bonaparte is a traitor.\" Jules\r\nFavre requested the erasure of the word Napoléon, that name of glory\r\nfatally powerful with the People and with the Army, and that there should\r\nbe written, \"Louis Bonaparte is a traitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said I to him.\r\n\r\nA discussion followed. Some wished to strike out the word \"Prince.\" But\r\nthe Assembly was impatient. \"Quick! quick!\" they cried out. \"We are in\r\nDecember, the days are short,\" repeated Joigneaux.\r\n\r\nTwelve copies were made at the same time in a few minutes. Schoelcher,\r\nRey, Xavier Durrieu, and Millière each took one, and set out in search of\r\na printing office.\r\n\r\nAs they went out a man whom I did not know, but who was greeted by\r\nseveral Representatives, entered and said, \"Citizens, this house is\r\nmarked. Troops are on the way to surround you. You have not a second to\r\nlose.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous voices were raised,--\r\n\r\n\"Very well! Let them arrest us!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them complete their crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Colleagues,\" said I, \"let us not allow ourselves to be arrested. After\r\nthe struggle, as God pleases; but before the combat,--No! It is from us\r\nthat the people are awaiting the initiative. If we are taken, all is at\r\nan end. Our duty is to bring on the battle, our right is to cross swords\r\nwith the _coup d'état_. It must not be allowed to capture us, it must\r\nseek us and not find us. We must deceive the arm which it stretches out\r\nagainst us, we must remain concealed from Bonaparte, we must harass him,\r\nweary him, astonish him, exhaust him, disappear and reappear unceasingly,\r\nchange our hiding-place, and always fight him, be always before him, and\r\nnever beneath his hand. Let us not leave the field. We have not numbers,\r\nlet us have daring.\"\r\n\r\nThey approved of this. \"It is right,\" said they, \"but where shall we go?\"\r\n\r\nLabrousse said,--\r\n\r\n\"Our former colleague of the Constituent Assembly, Beslay, offers us his\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does he live?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. 33, Rue de la Cérisaie, in the Marais.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" answered I, \"let us separate. We will meet again in two\r\nhours at Beslay's, No. 33, Rue de la Cérisaie.\"\r\n\r\nAll left; one after another, and in different directions. I begged\r\nCharamaule to go to my house and wait for me there, and I walked out with\r\nNoël Parfait and Lafon.\r\n\r\nWe reached the then still uninhabited district which skirts the ramparts.\r\nAs we came to the corner of the Rue Pigalle, we saw at a hundred paces\r\nfrom us, in the deserted streets which cross it, soldiers gliding all\r\nalong the houses, bending their steps towards the Rue Blanche.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock the members of the Left rejoined each other in the Rue\r\nde la Cérisaie. But the alarm had been given, and the inhabitants of\r\nthese lonely streets stationed themselves at the windows to see the\r\nRepresentatives pass. The place of meeting, situated and hemmed in at the\r\nbottom of a back yard, was badly chosen in the event of being surrounded:\r\nall these disadvantages were at once perceived, and the meeting only\r\nlasted a few seconds. It was presided over by Joly; Xavier Durrieu and\r\nJules Gouache, who were editors of the _Révolution_, also took part, as\r\nwell as several Italian exiles, amongst others Colonel Carini and\r\nMontanelli, ex-Minister of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. I liked Montanelli,\r\na gentle and dauntless spirit.\r\n\r\nMadier de Montjau brought news from the outskirts. Colonel Forestier,\r\nwithout losing and without taking away hope, told them of the obstacles\r\nwhich he had encountered in his attempts to call together the 6th Legion.\r\nHe pressed me to sign his appointment as Colonel, as well as Michel de\r\nBourges; but Michel de Bourges was absent, and besides, neither Michel de\r\nBourges nor I had yet at drat time the authority from the Left.\r\nNevertheless, under this reservation I signed his appointment. The\r\nperplexities were becoming more and more numerous. The Proclamation was\r\nnot yet printed, and the evening was closing in. Schoelcher explained the\r\ndifficulties: all the printing offices closed and guarded; an order\r\nplacarded that whoever should print an appeal to arms world be\r\nimmediately shot; the workmen terrified; no money. A hat was sent round,\r\nand each threw into it what money he had about him. They collected in\r\nthis manner a few hundred francs.\r\n\r\nXavier Durrieu, whose fiery courage never flagged for a single moment,\r\nreiterated that he would undertake the printing, and promised that by\r\neight o'clock that evening there should be 40,000 copies of the\r\nProclamation. Time pressed. They separated, after fixing as a rendezvous\r\nthe premises of the Society of Cabinet-makers in the Rue de Charonne, at\r\neight o'clock in the evening, so as to allow time for the situation to\r\nreveal itself. As we went out and crossed the Rue Beautreillis I saw\r\nPierre Leroux coming up to me. He had taken no part in our meetings. He\r\nsaid to me,--\r\n\r\n\"I believe this struggle to be useless. Although my point of view is\r\ndifferent from yours, I am your friend. Beware. There is yet time to\r\nstop. You are entering into the catacombs. The catacombs are Death.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are also Life,\" answered I.\r\n\r\nAll the same, I thought with joy that my two sons were in prison, and\r\nthat this gloomy duty of street fighting was imposed upon me alone.\r\n\r\nThere yet remained five hours until the time fixed for the rendezvous. I\r\nwished to go home, and once more embrace my wife and daughter before\r\nprecipitating myself into that abyss of the \"unknown\" which was there,\r\nyawning and gloomy, and which several of us were about to enter, never to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nArnauld (de l'Ariége) gave me his arm. The two Italian exiles, Carini\r\naril Montanelli, accompanied me.\r\n\r\nMontanelli took my hands and said to me, \"Right will conquer. You will\r\nconquer. Oh! that this time France may not be selfish as in 1848, and\r\nthat she may deliver Italy.\" I answered him, \"She will deliver Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThose were our illusions at that moment, but this, however, does not\r\nprevent them from being our hopes to-day. Faith is thus constituted;\r\nshadows demonstrate to it the light.\r\n\r\nThere is a cabstand before the front gate of St. Paul. We went there. The\r\nRue St. Antoine was alive with that indescribable uneasy swarming which\r\nprecedes those strange battles of ideas against deeds which are called\r\nRevolutions. I seemed to catch, in this great working-class district, a\r\nglimpse of a gleam of light which, alas, died out speedily. The cabstand\r\nbefore St. Paul was deserted. The drivers had foreseen the possibility of\r\nbarricades, and had fled.\r\n\r\nThree miles separated Arnauld and myself from our houses. It was\r\nimpossible to walk there through the middle of Paris, without being\r\nrecognized at each step. Two passers-by extricated us from our\r\ndifficulty. One of them said to the other, \"The omnibuses are still\r\nrunning on the Boulevards.\"\r\n\r\nWe profited by this information, and went to look for a Bastille omnibus.\r\nAll four of us got in.\r\n\r\nI entertained at heart, I repeat, wrongly or rightly, a bitter reproach\r\nfor the opportunity lost during the morning. I said to myself that on\r\ncritical days such moments come, but do not return. There are two\r\ntheories of Revolution: to arouse the people, or to let them come of\r\nthemselves. The first theory was mine, but, through force of discipline,\r\nI had obeyed the second. I reproached myself with this. I said to myself,\r\n\"The People offered themselves, and we did not accept them. It is for us\r\nnow not to offer ourselves, but to do more, to give ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the omnibus had started. It was full. I had taken my place at\r\nthe bottom on the left; Arnauld (de l'Ariége) sat next to me, Carini\r\nopposite, Montanelli next to Arnauld. We did not speak; Arnauld and\r\nmyself silently exchanged that pressure of hands which is a means of\r\nexchanging thoughts.\r\n\r\nAs the omnibus proceeded towards the centre of Paris the crowd became\r\ndenser on the Boulevard. As the omnibus entered into the cutting of the\r\nPorte St. Martin a regiment of heavy cavalry arrived in the opposite\r\ndirection. In a few seconds this regiment passed by the side of us. They\r\nwere cuirassiers. They filed by at a sharp trot and with drawn swords.\r\nThe people leaned over from the height of the pavements to see them pass.\r\nNot a single cry. On the one side the people dejected, on the other the\r\nsoldiers triumphant. All this stirred me.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the regiment halted. I do not know what obstruction momentarily\r\nimpeded its advance in this narrow cutting of the Boulevard in which we\r\nwere hemmed in. By its halt it stopped the omnibus. There were the\r\nsoldiers. We had them under our eyes, before us, at two paces distance,\r\ntheir horses touching the horses of our vehicle, these Frenchmen who had\r\nbecome Mamelukes, these citizen soldiers of the Great Republic\r\ntransformed into supporters of the degraded Empire. From the place where\r\nI sat I almost touched them; I could no longer restrain myself.\r\n\r\nI lowered the window of the omnibus. I put out my head, and, looking\r\nfixedly at the dense line of soldiers which faced me, I called out, \"Down\r\nwith Louis Bonaparte. Those who serve traitors are traitors!\"\r\n\r\nThose nearest to me turned their heads towards me and looked at me with a\r\ntipsy air; the others did not stir, and remained at \"shoulder arms,\" the\r\npeaks of their helmets over their eyes, their eyes fixed upon the ears of\r\ntheir horses.\r\n\r\nIn great affairs there is the immobility of statues; in petty mean\r\naffairs there is the immobility of puppets.\r\n\r\nAt the shout which I raised Arnauld turned sharply round. He also had\r\nlowered his window, and he was leaning half out of the omnibus, with his\r\narms extended towards the soldiers, and he shouted, \"Down with the\r\ntraitors!\"\r\n\r\nTo see him thus with his dauntless gesture, his handsome head, pale and\r\ncalm, his fervent expression, his beard and his long chestnut hair, one\r\nseemed to behold the radiant and fulminating face of an angry Christ.\r\n\r\nThe example was contagious and electrical.\r\n\r\n\"Down with the traitors!\" shouted Carini and Montanelli.\r\n\r\n\"Down with the Dictator! Down with the traitors!\" repeated a gallant\r\nyoung man with whom we were not acquainted, and who was sitting next to\r\nCarini.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this young man, the whole omnibus seemed seized\r\nwith terror!\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongues!\" exclaimed these poor frightened people; \"you will\r\ncause us all to be massacred.\" One, still more terrified, lowered the\r\nwindow, and began to shout to the soldiers, \"Long live Prince Napoléon!\r\nLong live the Emperor!\"\r\n\r\nThere were five of us, and we overpowered this cry by our persistent\r\nprotest, \"Down with Louis Bonaparte! Down with the traitors!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers listened in gloomy silence. A corporal turned with a\r\nthreatening air towards us, and shook his sword. The crowd looked on in\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nWhat passed within me at that moment? I cannot tell! I was in a\r\nwhirlwind. I had at the same time yielded to a calculation, finding the\r\nopportunity good, and to a burst of rage, finding the encounter insolent.\r\n\r\nA woman cried out to us from the pavement, \"You will get yourselves cut\r\nto pieces.\" I vaguely imagined that some collision was about to ensue,\r\nand that, either from the crowd or from the Army, the spark would fly\r\nout. I hoped for a sword-cut from the soldiers or a shout of anger from\r\nthe people. In short I had obeyed rather an instinct than an idea.\r\n\r\nBut nothing came of it, neither the sword-cut nor the shout of anger. The\r\nsoldiers did not bestir themselves and the people maintained silence. Was\r\nit too late? Was it too soon?\r\n\r\nThe mysterious man of the Elysée had not foreseen the event of an insult\r\nto his name being thrown in the very face of the soldiers. The soldiers\r\nhad no orders. They received them that evening. This was seen on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the regiment broke into a gallop, and the omnibus\r\nresumed its journey. As the cuirassiers filed past us Arnauld (de\r\nl'Ariége), still leaning out of the vehicle, continued to shout in their\r\nears, for as I have just said, their horses touched us, \"Down with the\r\nDictator! Down with the traitors!\"\r\n\r\nWe alighted in the Rue Lafitte. Carini, Montanelli, and Arnauld left me,\r\nand I went on alone towards the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne. Night was\r\ncoming on. As I turned the corner of the street a man passed close by me.\r\nBy the light of a street lamp I recognized a workman at a neighboring\r\ntannery, and he said to me in a low tone, and quickly, \"Do not return\r\nhome. The police surround your house.\"\r\n\r\nI went back again towards the Boulevard, through the streets laid out,\r\nbut not then built, which make a Y under my windows behind my house. Not\r\nbeing able to embrace my wife and daughter, I thought over what I could\r\ndo during the moments which remained to me. A remembrance came into my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REBOUND OF THE 24TH JUNE, 1848, ON THE 2D DECEMBER, 1851\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 26th June, 1848, that four days' combat, that gigantic combat\r\nso formidable and so heroic on both sides, still continued, but the\r\ninsurrection had been overcome nearly everywhere, and was restricted to\r\nthe Faubourg St. Antoine. Four men who had been amongst the most\r\ndauntless defenders of the barricades of the Rue Pont-aux-Choux, of the\r\nRue St. Claude, and of the Rue St. Louis in the Marais, escaped after the\r\nbarricades had been taken, and found safe refuge in a house, No. 12, Rue\r\nSt. Anastase. They were concealed in an attic. The National Guards and\r\nthe Mobile Guards were hunting for them, in order to shoot them. I was\r\ntold of this. I was one of the sixty Representatives sent by the\r\nConstituent Assembly into the middle of the conflict, charged with the\r\ntask of everywhere preceding the attacking column, of carrying, even at\r\nthe peril of their lives, words of peace to the barricades, to prevent\r\nthe shedding of blood, and to stop the civil war. I went into the Rue St.\r\nAnastase, and I saved the lives of those four men.\r\n\r\nAmongst those men there was a poor workman of the Rue de Charonne, whose\r\nwife was being confined at that very moment, and who was weeping. One\r\ncould understand, when hearing his sobs and seeing his rags, how he had\r\ncleared with a single bound these three steps--poverty, despair,\r\nrebellion. Their chief was a young man, pale and fair, with high cheek\r\nbones, intelligent brow, and an earnest and resolute countenance. As soon\r\nas I set him free, and told him my name, he also wept. He said to me,\r\n\"When I think that an hour ago I knew that you were facing us, and that I\r\nwished that the barrel of my gun had eyes to see and kill you!\" He added,\r\n\"In the times in which we live we do not know what may happen. If ever\r\nyou need me, for whatever purpose, come.\" His name was Auguste, and he\r\nwas a wine-seller in the Rue de la Roquette.\r\n\r\nSince that time I had only seen him once, on the 26th August, 1819, on\r\nthe day when I held the corner of Balzac's pall. The funeral possession\r\nwas going to Père la Chaise. Auguste's shop was on the way. All the\r\nstreets through which the procession passed were crowded. Auguste was at\r\nhis door with his young wife and two or three workmen. As I passed he\r\ngreeted me.\r\n\r\nIt was this remembrance which came back to my mind as I descended the\r\nlonely streets behind my house; in the presence of the 2d of December I\r\nthought of him. I thought that he might give me information about the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine, and help us in rousing the people. This young man\r\nhad at once given me the impression of a soldier and a leader. I\r\nremembered the words which he had spoken to me, and I considered it might\r\nbe useful to see him. I began by going to find in the Rue St. Anastase\r\nthe courageous woman who had hidden Auguste and his three companions, to\r\nwhom she had several times since rendered assistance. I begged her to\r\naccompany me. She consented.\r\n\r\nOn the way I dined upon a cake of chocolate which Charamaule had given\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe aspects of the boulevards, in coming down the Italiens towards the\r\nMarais, had impressed rue. The shops were open everywhere as usual. There\r\nwas little military display. In the wealthy quarters there was much\r\nagitation and concentration of troops; but on advancing towards the\r\nworking-class neighborhoods solitude reigned paramount. Before the Café\r\nTurc a regiment was drawn up. A band of young men in blouses passed\r\nbefore the regiment singing the \"Marseillaise.\" I answered them by crying\r\nout \"To Arms!\" The regiment did not stir. The light shone upon the\r\nplaybills on an adjacent wall; the theatres were open. I looked at the\r\ntrees as I passed. They were playing _Hernani_ at the Theatre des\r\nItaliens, with a new tenor named Guasco.\r\n\r\nThe Place de la Bastille was frequented, as usual, by goers and comers,\r\nthe most peaceable folk in the world. A few workmen grouped round the\r\nJuly Column, and, chatting in a low voice, were scarcely noticeable.\r\nThrough the windows of a wine shop could be seen two men who were\r\ndisputing for and against the _coup d'état_. He who favored it wore a\r\nblouse, he who attacked it wore a cloth coat. A few steps further on a\r\njuggler had placed between four candles his X-shaped table, and was\r\ndisplaying his conjuring tricks in the midst of a crowd, who were\r\nevidently thinking only of the juggler. On looking towards the gloomy\r\nloneliness of the Quai Mazas several harnessed artillery batteries were\r\ndimly visible in the darkness. Some lighted torches here and there showed\r\nup the black outline of the cannons.\r\n\r\nI had some trouble in finding Auguste's door in the Rue de la Roquette.\r\nNearly all the shops were shut, thus making the street very dark. At\r\nlength, through a glass shop-front I noticed a light which gleamed on a\r\npewter counter. Beyond the counter, through a partition also of glass and\r\nornamented with white curtains, another light, and the shadows of two or\r\nthree men at table could be vaguely distinguished. This was the place.\r\n\r\nI entered. The door on opening rang a bell. At the sound, the door of the\r\nglazed partition which separated the shop from the parlor opened, and\r\nAuguste appeared.\r\n\r\nHe knew me at once, and came up to me.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Sir,\" said he, \"it is you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what is going on?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"Yes, sir,\" uttered with calmness, and even with a certain\r\nembarrassment, told me all. Where I expected an indignant outcry I found\r\nthis peaceable answer. It seemed to me that I was speaking to the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine itself. I understood that all was at an end in this\r\ndistrict, and that we had nothing to expect from it. The people, this\r\nwonderful people, had resigned themselves. Nevertheless, I made an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\"Louis Bonaparte betrays the Republic,\" said I, without noticing that I\r\nraised my voice.\r\n\r\nHe touched my arm, and pointing with his finger to the shadows which were\r\npictured on the glazed partition of the parlor, \"Take care, sir; do not\r\ntalk so loudly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, \"you have come to this--you dare not speak, you dare\r\nnot utter the name of 'Bonaparte' aloud; you barely mumble a few words in\r\na whisper here, in this street, in the Faubourg St. Antoine, where, from\r\nall the doors, from all the windows, from all the pavements, from all the\r\nvery stones, ought to be heard the cry, 'To arms.'\"\r\n\r\nAuguste demonstrated to me what I already saw too clearly, and what\r\nGirard had shadowed forth in the morning--the moral situation of the\r\nFaubourg--that the people were \"dazed\"--that it seemed to all of them\r\nthat universal suffrage was restored; that the downfall of the law of the\r\n31st of May was a good thing.\r\n\r\nHere I interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"But this law of the 31st of May, it was Louis Bonaparte who instigated\r\nit, it was Rouher who made it, it was Baroche who proposed it, and the\r\nBonapartists who voted it. You are dazzled by a thief who has taken your\r\npurse, and who restores it to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" said Auguste, \"but the others.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he continued, \"To tell the whole truth, people did not care much for\r\nthe Constitution, they liked the Republic, but the Republic was\r\nmaintained too much by force for their taste. In all this they could only\r\nsee one thing clearly, the cannons ready to slaughter them--they\r\nremembered June, 1848--there were some poor people who had suffered\r\ngreatly--Cavaignac had done much evil--women clung to the men's blouses\r\nto prevent them from going to the barricades--nevertheless, with all\r\nthis, when seeing men like ourselves at their head, they would perhaps\r\nfight, but this hindered them, they did not know for what.\" He concluded\r\nby saying, \"The upper part of the Faubourg is doing nothing, the lower\r\nend will do better. Round about here they will fight. The Rue de la\r\nRoquette is good, the Rue de Charonne is good; but on the side of Père la\r\nChaise they ask, 'What good will that do us?' They only recognize the\r\nforty sous of their day's work. They will not bestir themselves; do not\r\nreckon upon the masons.\" He added, with a smile, \"Here we do not say\r\n'cold as a stone,' but 'cold as a mason'\"--and he resumed, \"As for me, if\r\nI am alive, it is to you that I owe my life. Dispose of me. I will lay\r\ndown my life, and will do what you wish.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking I saw the white curtain of the glazed partition\r\nbehind him move a little. His young wife, uneasy, was peeping through at\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my God,\" said I to him, \"what we want is not the life of one man but\r\nthe efforts of all.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent. I continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Auguste, you who are good and intelligent. So, then, the\r\nFaubourgs of Paris--which are heroes even when they err--the Faubourgs\r\nof Paris, for a misunderstanding, for a question of salary wrongly\r\nconstrued, for a bad definition of socialism, rose in June, 1848, against\r\nthe Assembly elected by themselves, against universal suffrage, against\r\ntheir own vote; and yet they will not rise in December, 1851, for Right,\r\nfor the Law, for the People, for Liberty, for the Republic. You say that\r\nthere is perplexity, and that you do not understand; but, on the\r\ncontrary, it was in June that all was obscure, and it is to-day that\r\neverything is clear!\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was saying these last words the door of the parlor was softly\r\nopened, and some one came in. It was a young man, fair as Auguste, in an\r\novercoat, and wearing a workman's cap. I started. Auguste turned round\r\nand said to me, \"You can trust him.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man took off his cap, came close up to me, carefully turning\r\nhis back on the glazed partition, and said to me in a low voice, \"I know\r\nyou well. I was on the Boulevard du Temple to-day. We asked you what we\r\nwere to do; you said, 'We must take up arms.' Well, here they are!\"\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hands into the pockets of his overcoat and drew out two\r\npistols.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment the bell of the street door sounded. He\r\nhurriedly put his pistols back into his pockets. A man in a blouse came\r\nin, a workman of some fifty years. This man, without looking at any one,\r\nwithout saying anything, threw down a piece of money on the counter.\r\nAuguste took a small glass and filled it with brandy, the man drank it\r\noff, put down the glass upon the counter and went away.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was shut: \"You see,\" said Auguste to me, \"they drink, they\r\neat, they sleep, they think of nothing. Such are they all!\"\r\n\r\nThe other interrupted him impetuously: \"One man is not the People!\"\r\n\r\nAnd turning towards me,--\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Victor Hugo, they will march forward. If all do not march, some\r\nwill march. To tell the truth, it is perhaps not here that a beginning\r\nshould be made, it is on the other side of the water.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly checking himself,--\"After all, you probably do not know my\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a little pocket-book from his pocket, tore out a piece of paper,\r\nwrote on it his name, and gave it to me. I regret having forgotten that\r\nname. He was a working engineer. In order not to compromise him, I burnt\r\nthis paper with many others on the Saturday morning, when I was on the\r\npoint of being arrested.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, sir,\" said Auguste, \"you must not judge badly of the\r\nFaubourg. As my friend has said, it will perhaps not be the first to\r\nbegin; but if there is a rising it will rise.\"\r\n\r\nI exclaimed, \"And who would you have erect if the Faubourg St. Antoine be\r\nprostrate! Who will be alive if the people be dead!\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer went to the street door, made certain that it was well shut,\r\nthen came back, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"There are many men ready and willing. It is the leaders who are wanting.\r\nListen, Citizen Victor Hugo, I can say this to you, and,\" he added,\r\nlowering his voice, \"I hope for a movement to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the Faubourg St. Marceau.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"At one o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I shall be there.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued: \"Now, Citizen Victor Hugo, if a movement takes place\r\nto-night in the Faubourg St. Marceau, will you head it? Do you consent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you your scarf of office?\"\r\n\r\nI half drew it out of my pocket. His eyes glistened with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent,\" said he. \"The Citizen has his pistols, the Representative\r\nhis scarf. All are armed.\"\r\n\r\nI questioned him. \"Are you sure of your movement for to-night?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered me, \"We have prepared it, and we reckon to be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said I, \"as soon as the first barricade is constructed I\r\nwill be behind it. Come and fetch me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wherever I may be.\"\r\n\r\nHe assured me that if the movement should take place during the night he\r\nwould know it at half-past ten that evening at the latest, and that I\r\nshould be informed of it before eleven o'clock. We settled that in\r\nwhatever place I might be at that hour I would send word to Auguste, who\r\nundertook to let him know.\r\n\r\nThe young woman continued to peep out at us. The conversation was growing\r\nprolonged, and might seem singular to the people in the parlor. \"I am\r\ngoing,\" said I to Auguste.\r\n\r\nI had opened the door, he took my hand, pressed it as a woman might have\r\ndone, and said to me in a deeply-moved tone, \"You are going: will you\r\ncome back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said he. \"No one knows what is going to happen. Well, you\r\nare perhaps going to be hunted and sought for as I have been. It will\r\nperhaps be your turn to be shot, and mine to save you. You know the mouse\r\nmay sometimes prove useful to the lion. Monsieur Victor Hugo, if you need\r\na refuge, this house is yours. Come here. You will find a bed where you\r\ncan sleep, and a man who will lay down his life for you.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him by a hearty shake of the hand, and I left. Eight o'clock\r\nstruck. I hastened towards the Rue de Charonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPRESENTATIVES HUNTED DOWN\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Rue de Faubourg St. Antoine before the shop of the\r\ngrocer Pepin, on the same spot where the immense barricade of June,\r\n1848, was erected as high as the second story, the decrees of the\r\nmorning had been placarded. Some men were inspecting them, although it\r\nwas pitch dark, and they could not read them, and an old woman said,\r\n\"The 'Twenty-five francs' are crushed--so much the better!\"\r\n\r\nA few steps further I heard my name pronounced. I turned round. It was\r\nJules Favre, Bourzat, Lafon, Madier de Montjau, and Michel de Bourges,\r\nwho were passing by. I took leave of the brave and devoted woman who had\r\ninsisted upon accompanying me. A _fiacre_ was passing. I put her in it,\r\nand then rejoined the five Representatives. They had come from the Rue\r\nde Charonne. They had found the premises of the Society of Cabinet\r\nMakers closed. \"There was no one there,\" said Madier de Montjau. \"These\r\nworthy people are beginning to get together a little capital, they do\r\nnot wish to compromise it, they are afraid of us. They say, '_coups\r\nd'état_ are nothing to us, we shall leave them alone!'\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not surprise me,\" answered I, \"a society is shopkeeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Jules Favre.\r\n\r\nLafon lived two steps from there, at No. 2, Quai Jemmapes. He offered us\r\nthe use of his rooms. We accepted, and took the necessary measures to\r\ninform the members of the Left that we had gone there.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards we were installed in Lafon's rooms, on the\r\nfourth floor of an old and lofty house. This house had seen the taking\r\nof the Bastille.\r\n\r\nThis house was entered by a side-door opening from the Quai Jemmapes\r\nupon a narrow courtyard a few steps lower than the Quai itself. Bourzat\r\nremained at this door to warn us in case of any accident, and to point\r\nout the house to those Representatives who might come up.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a large number of us had assembled, and we again\r\nmet--all those of the morning, with a few added. Lafon gave up his\r\ndrawing-room to us, the windows of which overlooked the back yard. We\r\norganized a sort of \"bureau,\" and we took our places, Jules Favre,\r\nCarnot, Michel, and myself, at a large table, lighted by two candles,\r\nand placed before the fire. The Representatives and the other people\r\npresent sat around on chairs and sofas. A group stood before the door.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges, on entering, exclaimed, \"We have come to seek out the\r\npeople of the Faubourg St. Antoine. Here we are. Here we must remain.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were applauded.\r\n\r\nThey set forth the situation--the torpor of the Faubourgs, no one at the\r\nSociety of Cabinet Makers, the doors closed nearly everywhere. I told\r\nthem what I had seen and heard in the Rue de la Roquette, the remarks of\r\nthe wine-seller, Auguste, on the indifference of the people, the hopes\r\nof the engineer, and the possibility of a movement during the night in\r\nthe Faubourg St. Marceau. It was settled that on the first notice that\r\nmight be given I should go there.\r\n\r\nNevertheless nothing was yet known of what had taken place during the\r\nday. It was announced that M. Havin, Lieutenant-Colonel of the 5th\r\nLegion of the National Guard, had ordered the officers of his Legion to\r\nattend a meeting.\r\n\r\nSome Democratic writers came in, amongst whom were Alexander Rey and\r\nXavier Durrieu, with Kesler, Villiers, and Amable Lemaître of the\r\n_Révolution_; one of these writers was Millière.\r\n\r\nMillière had a large bleeding wound above his eye-brow; that same\r\nmorning on leaving us, as he was carrying away one of the copies of the\r\nProclamation which I had dictated, a man had thrown himself upon him to\r\nsnatch it from him. The police had evidently already been informed of\r\nthe Proclamation, and lay in wait for it; Millière had a hand-to-hand\r\nstruggle with the police agent, and had overthrown him, not without\r\nbearing away this gash. However, the Proclamation was not yet printed.\r\nIt was nearly nine o'clock in the evening and nothing had come. Xavier\r\nDurrieu asserted that before another hour elapsed they should have the\r\npromised forty thousand copies. It was hoped to cover the walls of Paris\r\nwith them during the night. Each of those present was to serve as a\r\nbill-poster.\r\n\r\nThere were amongst us--an inevitable circumstance in the stormy\r\nconfusion of the first moments--a good many men whom we did not know.\r\nOne of these men brought in ten or twelve copies of the appeal to arms.\r\nHe asked me to sign them with my own hand, in order, he said, that he\r\nmight be able to show my signature to the people--\"Or to the police,\"\r\nwhispered Baudin to me smiling. We were not in a position to take such\r\nprecautions as these. I gave this man all the signatures that he wanted.\r\n\r\nMadier de Montjau began to speak. It was of consequence to organize the\r\naction of the Left, to impress the unity of impulse upon the movement\r\nwhich was being prepared; to create a centre for it, to give a pivot to\r\nthe insurrection, to the Left a direction, and to the People a\r\nsupport. He proposed the immediate formation of a committee representing\r\nthe entire Left in all its shades, and charged with organizing and\r\ndirecting the insurrection.\r\n\r\nAll the Representatives cheered this eloquent and courageous man. Seven\r\nmembers were proposed. They named at once Carnot, De Flotte, Jules\r\nFavre, Madier de Montjau, Michel de Bourges, and myself; and thus was\r\nunanimously formed this Committee of Insurrection, which at my request\r\nwas called a Committee of Resistance; for it was Louis Bonaparte who was\r\ntire insurgent. For ourselves, the were the Republic. It was desired\r\nthat one workman-Representative should be admitted into the committee.\r\nFaure (du Rhône) was nominated. But Faure, we learned later on, had been\r\narrested that morning. The committee then was, it fact, composed of six\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe committee organized itself during the sitting. A Committee of\r\nPermanency was formed from amongst it, and invested with the authority\r\nof decreeing \"urgency\" in the name of all the Left, of concentrating all\r\nnews, information, directions, instructions, resources, orders. This\r\nCommittee of Permanency was composed of four members, who were Carnot,\r\nMichel de Bourges, Jules Favre, and myself. De Flotte and Madier de\r\nMontjau were specially delegated, De Flotte for the left bank of the\r\nriver and the district of the schools, Madier for the Boulevards and the\r\noutskirts.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary operations being terminated, Lafon took aside Michel\r\nde Bourges and myself, and told us that the ex-Constituent Proudhon had\r\ninquired for one of us two, that he had remained downstairs nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour, and that he had gone away, saying that he would wait\r\nfor us in the Place de la Bastille.\r\n\r\nProudhon, who was at that time undergoing a term of three years'\r\nimprisonment at St. Pélagie for an offence against Louis Bonaparte, was\r\ngranted leave of absence from tine to time. Chance willed it that one of\r\nthese liberty days had fallen on the 2d of December.\r\n\r\nThis is an incident which one cannot help noting. On the 2d of December\r\nProudhon was a prisoner by virtue of a lawful sentence, and at the same\r\nmoment at which they illegally imprisoned the inviolable\r\nRepresentatives, Proudhon, whom they could have legitimately detained,\r\nwas allowed to go out. Proudhon had profited by his liberty to come and\r\nfind us.\r\n\r\nI knew Proudhon from having seen him at the Concièrgerie, where my two\r\nsons were shut up, and my two illustrious friends, Auguste Vacquérie and\r\nPaul Meurice, and those gallant writers, Louis Jourdan, Erdan, and\r\nSuchet. I could not help thinking that on that day they would assuredly\r\nnot have given leave of absence to these men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Xavier Durrieu whispered to me, \"I have just left Proudhon. He\r\nwishes to see you. He is waiting for you down below, close by, at the\r\nentrance to the Place. You will find him leaning on the parapet of the\r\ncanal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going,\" said I.\r\n\r\nI went downstairs.\r\n\r\nI found in truth, at the spot mentioned, Proudhon, thoughtful, leaning\r\nwith his two elbows on the parapet. He wore that broad-brimmed hat in\r\nwhich I had often seen him striding alone up and down the courtyard of\r\nthe Concièrgerie.\r\n\r\nI went up to him.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to speak to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" and he shook me by the hand.\r\n\r\nThe corner where we were standing was lonely. On the left there was the\r\nPlace de la Bastille, dark and gloomy; one could see nothing there, but\r\none could feel a crowd; regiments were there in battle array; they did\r\nnot bivouac, they were ready to march; the muffled sound of breathing\r\ncould be heard; the square was full of that glistening shower of pale\r\nsparks which bayonets give forth at night time. Above this abyss of\r\nshadows rose up black and stark the Column of July.\r\n\r\nProudhon resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"Listen. I come to give you a friendly warning. You are entertaining\r\nillusions. The People are ensnared in this affair. They will not stir.\r\nBonaparte will carry them with him. This rubbish, the restitution of\r\nuniversal suffrage, entraps the simpletons. Bonaparte passes for a\r\nSocialist. He has said, 'I will be the Emperor of the Rabble.' It is a\r\npiece of insolence. But insolence has a chance of success when it has\r\nthis at its service.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Proudhon pointed with his finger to the sinister gleam of the\r\nbayonets. He continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Bonaparte has an object in view. The Republic has made the People. He\r\nwishes to restore the Populace. He will succeed and you will fail. He\r\nhas on his side force, cannons, the mistake of the people, and the folly\r\nof the Assembly. The few of the Left to which you belong will not\r\nsucceed in overthrowing the _coup d'état_. You are honest, and he has\r\nthis advantage over you--that he is a rogue. You have scruples, and he\r\nhas this advantage over you--that he has none. Believe me. Resist no\r\nlonger. The situation is without resources. We must wait; but at this\r\nmoment fighting would be madness. What do you hope for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And what are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything.\"\r\n\r\nBy the tone of my voice he understood that further persistence was\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe parted. He disappeared in the darkness. I have never seen him since.\r\n\r\nI went up again to Lafon's rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the copies of the appeal to arms did not come to hand.\r\nThe Representatives, becoming uneasy, went up and downstairs. Some of\r\nthem went out on the Quai Jemmapes, to wait there and gain information\r\nabout them. In the room there was a sound of confused talking the\r\nmembers of the Committee, Madier de Montjau, Jules Favre, and Carnot,\r\nwithdrew, and sent word to me by Charamaule that they were going to No.\r\n10, Rue des Moulins, to the house of the ex-Constituent Landrin, in the\r\ndivision of the 5th Legion, to deliberate more at their ease, and they\r\nbegged me to join them. But I thought I should do better to remain. I\r\nhad placed myself at the disposal of the probable movement of the\r\nFaubourg St. Marceau. I awaited the notice of it through Auguste. It was\r\nmost important that I should not go too far away; besides, it was\r\npossible that if I went away, the Representatives of the Left, no\r\nlonging seeing a member of the committee amongst them, would disperse\r\nwithout taking any resolution, and I saw in this more than one\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nTime passed, no Proclamations. We learned the next day that the packages\r\nhad been seized by the police. Cournet, an ex-Republican naval officer\r\nwho was present, began to speak. We shall see presently what sort of a\r\nman Cournet was, and of what an energetic and determined nature he was\r\ncomposed. He represented to us that as we had been there nearly two\r\nhours the police would certainly end by being informed of our\r\nwhereabouts, that the members of the Left had an imperative duty--to\r\nkeep themselves at all costs at the head of the People, that the\r\nnecessity itself of their situation imposed upon them the precaution of\r\nfrequently changing their place of retreat, and he ended by offering us,\r\nfor our deliberation, his house and his workshops, No. 82, Rue\r\nPopincourt, at the bottom of a blind alley, and also in the neighborhood\r\nof the Faubourg St. Antoine.\r\n\r\nThis offer was accepted. I sent to inform Auguste of our change of\r\nabode, and of Cournet's address. Lafon remained on the Quai Jemmapes in\r\norder to forward on the Proclamations as soon as they arrived, and we\r\nset out at once.\r\n\r\nCharamaule undertook to send to the Rue des Moulins to tell the other\r\nmembers of the committee that we would wait for them at No. 82, Rue\r\nPopincourt.\r\n\r\nWe walked, as in the morning, in little separate groups. The Quai\r\nJemmapes skirts the left bank of the St. Martin Canal; we went up it. We\r\nonly met a few solitary workmen, who looked back when we had passed, and\r\nstopped behind us with an air of astonishment. The night was dark. A few\r\ndrops of rain were falling.\r\n\r\nA little beyond the Rue de Chemin Vert we turned to the right and\r\nreached the Rue Popincourt. There all was deserted, extinguished,\r\nclosed, and silent, as in the Faubourg St. Antoine. This street is of\r\ngreat length. We walked for a long time; we passed by the barracks.\r\nCournet was no longer with us; he had remained behind to inform some of\r\nhis friends, and we were told to take defensive measures in case his\r\nhouse was attacked. We looked for No. 82. The darkness was such that we\r\ncould not distinguish the numbers on the houses. At length, at the end\r\nof the street, on the right, we saw a light; it was a grocer's shop, the\r\nonly one open throughout the street. One of us entered, and asked the\r\ngrocer, who was sitting behind his counter, to show us M. Cournet's\r\nhouse. \"Opposite,\" said the grocer, pointing to an old and low carriage\r\nentrance which could be seen on the other side of the street, almost\r\nfacing his shop.\r\n\r\nWe knocked at this door. It was opened. Baudin entered first, tapped at\r\nthe window of the porter's lodge, and asked \"Monsieur Cournet?\"--An old\r\nwoman's voice answered, \"Here.\"\r\n\r\nThe portress was in bed; all in the house sleeping. We went in.\r\n\r\nHaving entered, and the gate being shut behind us, we found ourselves in\r\na little square courtyard which formed the centre of a sort of a\r\ntwo-storied ruin; the silence of a convent prevailed, not a light was to\r\nbe seen at the windows; near a shed was seen a low entrance to a narrow,\r\ndark, and winding staircase. \"We have made some mistake,\" said\r\nCharamaule; \"it is impossible that it can be here.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the portress, hearing all these trampling steps beneath her\r\ndoorway, had become wide awake, had lighted her lamp, and we could see\r\nher in her lodge, her face pressed against the window, gazing with alarm\r\nat sixty dark phantoms, motionless, and standing in her courtyard.\r\n\r\nEsquiros addressed her: \"Is this really M. Cournet's house?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"M. Cornet, without doubt,\" answered the good woman.\r\n\r\nAll was explained. We had asked for Cournet, the grocer had understood\r\nCornet, the portress had understood Cornet. It chanced that M. Cornet\r\nlived there.\r\n\r\nWe shall see by and by what an extraordinary service chance had rendered\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe went out, to the great relief of the poor portress, and we resumed\r\nour search. Xavier Durrieu succeeded in ascertaining our whereabouts,\r\nand extricated us from our difficulty.\r\n\r\nA few moments afterwards we turned to the left, and we entered into a\r\nblind alley of considerable length and dimly lighted by an old oil\r\nlamp--one of those with which Paris was formerly lighted--then again to\r\nthe left, and we entered through a narrow passage into a large courtyard\r\nencumbered with sheds and building materials. This time we had reached\r\nCournet's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE FOOT IN THE TOMB\r\n\r\nCournet was waiting for us. He received us on the ground floor, in a\r\nparlor where there was a fire, a table, and some chairs; but the room\r\nwas so small that a quarter of us filled it to overflowing, and the\r\nothers remained in the courtyard. \"It is impossible to deliberate here,\"\r\nsaid Bancel. \"I have a larger room on the first floor,\" answered\r\nCournet, \"but it is a building in course of construction, which is not\r\nyet furnished, and where there is no fire.\"--\"What does it matter?\" they\r\nanswered him. \"Let us go up to the first floor.\"\r\n\r\nWe went up to the first floor by a steep and narrow wooden staircase,\r\nand we took possession of two rooms with very low ceilings, but of which\r\none was sufficiently large. The walls were whitewashed, and a few\r\nstraw-covered stools formed the whole of its furniture.\r\n\r\nThey called out to me, \"Preside.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down on one of the stools in the corner of the first room, with\r\nthe fire place on my right and on my left the door opening upon the\r\nstaircase. Baudin said to me, \"I have a pencil and paper. I will act as\r\nsecretary to you.\" He sat down on a stool next to me.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives and those present, amongst whom were several men in\r\nblouses, remained standing, forming in front of Baudin and myself a sort\r\nof square, backed by the two walls of the room opposite to us. This\r\ncrowd extended as far as the staircase. A lighted candle was placed on\r\nthe chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nA common spirit animated this meeting. The faces were pale, but in every\r\neye could be seen the same firm resolution. In all these shadows\r\nglistened the same flame. Several simultaneously asked permission to\r\nspeak. I requested them to give their names to Baudin, who wrote them\r\ndown, and then passed me the list.\r\n\r\nThe\r\nfirst speaker was a workman. He began by apologizing for mingling with\r\nthe Representatives, he a stranger to the Assembly. The Representatives\r\ninterrupted him. \"No, no,\" they said, \"the People and Representatives\r\nare all one! Speak--!\" He declared that if he spoke it was in order to\r\nclear from all suspicion the honor of his brethren, the workmen of\r\nParis; that he had heard some Representatives express doubt about them.\r\nHe asserted that this was unjust, that the workmen realized the whole\r\ncrime of M. Bonaparte and the whole duty of the People, that they would\r\nnot be deaf to the appeal of the Republican Representatives, and that\r\nthis would be clearly shown. He said all this, simply, with a sort of\r\nproud shyness and of honest bluntness. He kept his word. I found him the\r\nnext day fighting on the Rambuteau barricade.\r\n\r\nMathieu (de la Drôme) came in as the workman concluded. \"I bring news,\"\r\nhe exclaimed. A profound silence ensued.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, we vaguely knew since the morning that the Right\r\nwere to have assembled, and that a certain number of our friends had\r\nprobably taken part in the meeting, and that was all. Mathieu (de la\r\nDrôme) brought us the events of the day, the details of the arrests at\r\ntheir own houses carried out without any obstacle, of the meeting which\r\nhad taken place at M. Daru's house and its rough treatment in the Rue\r\nde Bourgogne, of the Representatives expelled from the Hall of the\r\nAssembly, of the meanness of President Dupin, of the melting away of the\r\nHigh Court, of the total inaction of the Council of State, of the sad\r\nsitting held at the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement, of the Oudinot,\r\n_fiasco_, of the decree of the deposition of the President, and of the\r\ntwo hundred and twenty forcibly arrested and taken to the Quai d'Orsay.\r\nHe concluded in a manly style: \"The duty of the Left was increasing\r\nhourly. The morrow would probably prove decisive.\" He implored the\r\nmeeting to take this into consideration.\r\n\r\nA workman added a fact. He had happened in the morning to be in the Rue\r\nde Grenelle during the passage of the arrested members of the Assembly;\r\nhe was there at the moment when one of the commanders of the Chasseurs\r\nde Vincennes had uttered these words, \"Now it is the turn of those\r\ngentlemen--the Red Representatives. Let them look out for themselves!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the editors of the _Révolution_, Hennett de Kesler, who\r\nafterwards became an intrepid exile, completed the information of\r\nMathieu (de la Drôme). He recounted the action taken by two members of\r\nthe Assembly with regard to the so-called Minister of the Interior,\r\nMorny, and the answer of the said Morny: \"If I find any of the\r\nRepresentatives behind the barricades, I will have them shot to the last\r\nman,\" and that other saying of the same witty vagabond respecting the\r\nmembers taken to the Quai d'Orsay, \"These are the last Representatives\r\nwho will be made prisoners.\" He told us that a placard was at that very\r\nmoment being printed which declared that \"Any one who should be found at\r\na secret meeting would be immediately shot.\" The placard, in truth,\r\nappeared the next morning.\r\n\r\nBaudin rose up. \"The _coup d'état_ redoubles its rage,\" exclaimed he.\r\n\"Citizens, let us redouble our energy!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a man in a blouse entered. He was out of breath. He had run\r\nhard. He told us that he had just seen, and he repeated, had seen with\r\n\"his own eyes,\" in the Rue Popincourt, a regiment marching in silence,\r\nand wending its way towards the blind alley of No. 82, that we were\r\nsurrounded, and that we were about to be attacked. He begged us to\r\ndisperse immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Representatives,\" called out Cournet, \"I have placed scouts in\r\nthe blind alley who will fall back and warn us if the regiment penetrates\r\nthither. The door is narrow and will be barricaded in the twinkling of\r\nan eye. We are here, with you, fifty armed and resolute men, and at the\r\nfirst shot we shall be two hundred. We are provided with ammunition. You\r\ncan deliberate calmly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he concluded he raised his right arm, and from his sleeve fell\r\na large poniard, which he had concealed, and with the other hand he\r\nrattled in his pocket the butts of a pair of pistols.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said I, \"let us continue.\"\r\n\r\nThree of the youngest and most eloquent orators of the Left, Bancel,\r\nArnauld (de l'Ariége) and Victor Chauffour delivered their opinions in\r\nsuccession. All three were imbued with this notion, that our appeal to\r\narms not having yet been placarded, the different incidents of the\r\nBoulevarde du Temple and of the Café Bonvalet having brought about no\r\nresults, none of our decrees, owing to the repressive measures of\r\nBonaparte, having yet succeeded in appearing, while the events at the\r\nMairie of the Tenth Arrondissement began to be spread abroad through\r\nParis, it seemed as though the Right had commenced active resistance\r\nbefore the Left. A generous rivalry for the public safety spurred them\r\non. It was delightful to them to know that a regiment ready to attack was\r\nclose by, within a few steps, and that perhaps in a few moments their\r\nblood would flow.\r\n\r\nMoreover, advice abounded, and with advice, uncertainty. Some illusions\r\nwere still entertained. A workman, leaning close to me against the\r\nfireplace, said in a low voice to one of his comrades that the People\r\nmust not be reckoned upon, and that if we fought \"We should perpetrate a\r\nmadness.\"\r\n\r\nThe incidents and events of the day had in some degree modified my\r\nopinion as to the course to be followed in this grave crisis. The\r\nsilence of the crowd at the moment when Arnauld (de l'Ariége) and I had\r\napostrophized the troops, had destroyed the impression which a few hours\r\nbefore the enthusiasm of the people on the Boulevard du Temple had left\r\nwith me. The hesitation of Auguste had impressed me, the Society of\r\nCabinet Makers appeared to shun us, the torpor of the Faubourg St.\r\nAntoine was manifest, the inertness of the Faubourg St. Marceau was not\r\nless so. I ought to have received notice from the engineer before eleven\r\no'clock, and eleven o'clock was past. Our hopes died away one after\r\nanother. Nevertheless, all the more reason, in my opinion, to astonish\r\nand awaken Paris by an extraordinary spectacle, by a daring act of life\r\nand collective power on the part of the Representatives of the Left, by\r\nthe daring of an immense devotion.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen later on what a combination of accidental circumstances\r\nprevented this idea from being realized as I then purposed. The\r\nRepresentatives have done their whole duty. Providence perhaps has not\r\ndone all on its side. Be it as it may, supposing that we were not at\r\nonce carried off by some nocturnal and immediate combat, and that at the\r\nhour at which I was speaking we had still a \"to-morrow,\" I felt the\r\nnecessity of fixing every eye upon the course which should be adopted\r\non the day which was about to follow.--I spoke.\r\n\r\nI began by completely unveiling the situation. I painted the picture in\r\nfour words: the Constitution thrown into the gutter; the Assembly driven\r\nto prison with the butt-end of a musket, the Council of State dispersed;\r\nthe High Court expelled by a galley-sergeant, a manifest beginning of\r\nvictory for Louis Bonaparte, Paris ensnared in the army as though in a\r\nnet; bewilderment everywhere, all authority overthrown; all compacts\r\nannulled; two things only remained standing, the _coup d'état_ and\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"Ourselves! and who are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are,\" said I, \"we are Truth and Justice! We are the supreme and\r\nsovereign power, the People incarnate--Right!\"\r\n\r\nI continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Louis Bonaparte at every minute which elapses advances a step further\r\nin his crime. For him nothing is inviolable, nothing is sacred; this\r\nmorning he violated the Palace of the Representatives of the Nation, a\r\nfew hours later he laid violent hands on their persons; to-morrow,\r\nperhaps in a few moments, he will shed their blood. Well then! he\r\nmarches upon us, let us march upon him. The danger grows greater, let us\r\ngrow greater with the danger.\"\r\n\r\nA movement of assent passed through the Assembly. I continued,--\r\n\r\n\"I repeat and insist. Let us show no mercy to this wretched Bonaparte\r\nfor any of the enormities which his outrage contains. As he has drawn\r\nthe wine--I should say the blood--he must drink it up. We are not\r\nindividuals, we are the Nation. Each of us walks forth clothed with the\r\nSovereignty of the people. He cannot strike our persons without rending\r\nthat. Let us compel his volleys to pierce our sashes as well as our\r\nbreasts. This man is on a road where logic grasps him and leads him to\r\nparricide. What he is killing in this moment is the country! Well, then!\r\nwhen the ball of Executive Power pierces the sash of Legislative Power,\r\nit is visible parricide! It is this that must be understood!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are\r\nquite ready!\" they cried out. \"What measures would you advise us to\r\nadopt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No half measures,\" answered I; \"a deed of grandeur! To-morrow--if we\r\nleave here this night--let us all meet in the Faubourg St. Antoine.\"\r\n\r\nThey interposed, \"Why the Faubourg St. Antoine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" resumed I, \"the Faubourg St. Antoine! I cannot believe that the\r\nheart of the People has ceased to beat there. Let us all meet to-morrow\r\nin the Faubourg St. Antoine. Opposite the Lenoir Market there is a hall\r\nwhich was used by a club in 1848.\"\r\n\r\nThey cried out to me, \"The Salle Roysin.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is it,\" said I, \"The Salle Roysin. We who remain free number a\r\nhundred and twenty Republican Representatives. Let us install ourselves\r\nin this hall. Let us install ourselves in the fulness and majesty of the\r\nLegislative Power. Henceforward we are the Assembly, the whole of the\r\nAssembly! Let us sit there, deliberate there, in our official sashes,\r\nin the midst of the People. Let us summon the Faubourg St. Antoine to\r\nits duty, let us shelter there the National Representation, let us\r\nshelter there the popular sovereignty. Let us intrust the People to the\r\nkeeping of the People. Let us adjure them to protect themselves. If\r\nnecessary, let us order them!\"\r\n\r\nA voice interrupted me: \"You cannot give orders to the People!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" I cried, \"When it is a question of public safety, of the universal\r\nsafety, when it is a question of the future of every European\r\nnationality, when it is a question of defending the Republic, Liberty,\r\nCivilization, the Revolution, we have the right--we, the Representatives\r\nof the entire nation--to give, in the name of the French people, orders\r\nto the people of Paris! Let us, therefore, meet to-morrow at this Salle\r\nRoysin; but at what time? Not too early in the morning. In broad day. It\r\nis necessary that the shops should be open, that people should be coming\r\nand going, that the population should be moving about, that there should\r\nbe plenty of people in the streets, that they should see us, that they\r\nshould recognize us, that the grandeur of our example should strike every\r\neye and stir every heart. Let us all be there between nine and ten\r\no'clock in the morning. If we cannot obtain the Salle Roysin we will take\r\nthe first church at hand, a stable, a shed, some enclosure where we can\r\ndeliberate; at need, as Michel de Bourges has said, we will hold our\r\nsittings in a square bounded by four barricades. But provisionally I\r\nsuggest the Salle Roysin. Do not forget that in such a crisis there must\r\nbe no vacuum before the nation. That alarms it. There must be a\r\ngovernment somewhere, and it must be known. The rebellion at the Elysée,\r\nthe Government at the Faubourg St. Antoine; the Left the Government, the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine the citadel; such are the ideas which from to-morrow\r\nwe must impress upon the mind of Paris. To the Salle Roysin, then! Thence\r\nin the midst of the dauntless throng of workmen of that great district of\r\nParis, enclosed in the Faubourg as in a fortress, being both Legislators\r\nand Generals, multiplying and inventing means of defence and of attack,\r\nlaunching Proclamations and unearthing the pavements, employing the women\r\nin writing out placards while the men are fighting, we will issue a\r\nwarrant against Louis Bonaparte, we will issue warrants against his\r\naccomplices, we will declare the military chiefs traitors, we will outlaw\r\nin a body all the crime and all the criminals, we will summon the\r\ncitizens to arms, we will recall the army to duty, we will rise up before\r\nLouis Bonaparte, terrible as the living Republic, we will fight on the\r\none hand with the power of the Law, and on the other with the power of\r\nthe People, we will overwhelm this miserable rebel, and will rise up\r\nabove his head both as a great Lawful Power and a great Revolutionary\r\nPower!\"\r\n\r\nWhile speaking I became intoxicated with my own ideas. My enthusiasm\r\ncommunicated itself to the meeting. They cheered me. I saw that I was\r\nbecoming somewhat too hopeful, that I allowed myself to be carried away,\r\nand that I carried them away, that I presented to them success as\r\npossible, as even easy, at a moment when it was important that no one\r\nshould entertain an illusion. The truth was gloomy, and it was my duty\r\nto tell it. I let silence be re-established, and I signed with my hand\r\nthat I had a last word to say. I then resumed, lowering my voice,--\r\n\r\n\"Listen, calculate carefully what you are doing. On one side a hundred\r\nthousand men, seventeen harnessed batteries, six thousand cannon-mouths\r\nin the forts, magazines, arsenals, ammunition sufficient to carry out a\r\nRussian campaign; on the other a hundred and twenty Representatives, a\r\nthousand or twelve hundred patriots, six hundred muskets, two cartridges\r\nper man, not a drum to beat to arms, not a bell to sound the tocsin, not\r\na printing office to print a Proclamation; barely here and there a\r\nlithographic press, and a cellar where a hand-bill can be hurriedly and\r\nfurtively printed with the brush; the penalty of death against any one\r\nwho unearths a paving stone, penalty of death against any one who would\r\nenlist in our ranks, penalty of death against any one who is found in a\r\nsecret meeting, penalty of death against any one who shall post up an\r\nappeal to arms; if you are taken during the combat, death; if you are\r\ntaken after the combat, transportation or exile; on the one side an army\r\nand a Crime; on the other a handful of men and Right. Such is this\r\nstruggle. Do you accept it?\"\r\n\r\nA unanimous shout answered me, \"Yes! yes!\"\r\n\r\nThis shout did not come from the mouths, it came from the souls. Baudin,\r\nstill seated next to me, pressed my hand in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was settled therefore at once that they should meet again on the next\r\nday, Wednesday, between nine and ten in the morning, at the Salle Roysin,\r\nthat they should arrive singly or by little separate groups, and that\r\nthey should let those who were absent know of this rendezvous. This\r\ndone, there remained nothing more but to separate. It was about\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nOne of Cournet's scouts entered. \"Citizen Representatives,\" he said,\r\n\"the regiment is no longer there. The street is free.\"\r\n\r\nThe regiment, which had probably come from the Popincourt barracks close\r\nat hand, had occupied the street opposite the blind alley for more than\r\nhalf an hour, and then had returned to the barracks. Had they judged the\r\nattack inopportune or dangerous at night in that narrow blind alley, and\r\nin the centre of this formidable Popincourt district, where the\r\ninsurrection had so long held its own in June, 1848? It appeared certain\r\nthat the soldiers had searched several houses in the neighborhood.\r\nAccording to details which we learned subsequently, we were followed\r\nafter leaving No. 2, Quai Jemmapes, by an agent of police, who saw us\r\nenter the house where a M. Cornet was lodging, and who at once proceeded\r\nto the Prefecture to denounce our place of refuge to his chiefs. The\r\nregiment sent to arrest us surrounded the house, ransacked it from attic\r\nto cellar, found nothing, and went away.\r\n\r\nThis quasi-synonym of Cornet and Cournet lead misled the bloodhounds of\r\nthe _coup d'état_. Chance, we see, had interposed usefully in our\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nI was talking at the door with Baudin, and we were making some last\r\narrangements, when a young man with a chestnut beard, dressed like a man\r\nof fashion, and possessing all the manners of one, and whom I had\r\nnoticed while speaking, came up to me.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Victor Hugo,\" said he, \"where are you going to sleep?\"\r\n\r\nUp to that moment I had not thought of this.\r\n\r\nIt was far from prudent to go home.\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" I answered, \"I have not the least idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you come to my house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very happy.\"\r\n\r\nHe told me his mane. It was M. de la R----. He knew my brother Abel's\r\nwife and family, the Montferriers, relations of the Chambacères, and he\r\nlived in the Rue Caumartin. He had been a Prefect under the Provisional\r\nGovernment. There was a carriage in waiting. We got in, and as Baudin\r\ntold me that he would pass the night at Cournet's, I gave him the\r\naddress of M. do la R----, so that he could send for me if any notice of\r\nthe movement came from the Faubourg St. Marceau or elsewhere. But I\r\nhoped for nothing more that night, and I was right.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of an hour after the separation of the Representatives,\r\nand after we had left the Rue Popincourt, Jules Favre, Madier de\r\nMontajau, de Flotte, and Carnot, to whom we had sent word to the Rue des\r\nMoulins, arrived at Cournet's, accompanied by Schoelcher, by Charamaule,\r\nby Aubry (du Nord), and by Bastide. Some Representatives were still\r\nremaining at Cournet's. Several, like Baudin, were going to pass the\r\nnight there. They told our colleagues what had been settled respecting\r\nmy proposition, and of the rendezvous at the Salle Roysin; only it\r\nappears that there was some doubt regarding the hour agreed upon, and\r\nthat Baudin in particular did not exactly remember it, and that our\r\ncolleagues believed that the rendezvous, which had been fixed for nine\r\no'clock in the morning, was fixed for eight.\r\n\r\nThis alteration in the hour, due to the treachery of memory for which no\r\none can be blamed, prevented the realization of the plan which I had\r\nconceived of an Assembly holding its sittings in the Faubourg, and\r\ngiving battle to Louis Bonaparte, but gave us as a compensation the\r\nheroic exploits of the Ste. Marguerite barricade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURIAL OF A GREAT ANNIVERSARY\r\n\r\nSuch was the first day. Let us look at it steadfastly. It deserves it.\r\nIt is the anniversary of Austerlitz; the Nephew commemorates the Uncle.\r\nAusterlitz is the most brilliant battle of history; the Nephew set\r\nhimself this problem--how to commit a baseness equal to this\r\nmagnificence. He succeeded.\r\n\r\nThis first day, which will be followed by others, is already complete.\r\nEverything is there. It is the most terrible attempt at a thrust\r\nbackwards that has ever been essayed. Never has such a crumbling of\r\ncivilization been seen. All that formed the edifice is now in ruin; the\r\nsoil is strewn with the fragments. In one night the inviolability of the\r\nLaw, the Right of the Citizen, the Dignity of the Judge, and the Honor\r\nof the Soldier have disappeared. Terrible substitutions have taken\r\nplace; there was the oath, there is pergury; there was the flag, there\r\nis a rag; there was the Army, there is a band of brigands; there was\r\nJustice, there is treason; there was a code of laws, there is the sabre;\r\nthere was a Government, there is a crew of swindlers; there was France,\r\nthere is a den of thieves. This called itself Society Saved.\r\n\r\nIt is the rescue of the traveller by the highwayman.\r\n\r\nFrance was passing by, Bonaparte cried, \"Stand and deliver!\"\r\n\r\nThe hypocrisy which has preceded the Crime, equals in deformity the\r\nimpudence which has followed it. The nation was trustful and calm. There\r\nwas a sudden and cynical shock. History has recorded nothing equal to the\r\nSecond of December. Here there was no glory, nothing but meanness. No\r\ndeceptive picture. He could have declared himself honest; He declares\r\nhimself infamous; nothing more simple. This day, almost unintelligible in\r\nits success, has proved that Politics possess their obscene side. Louis\r\nBonaparte has shown himself unmasked.\r\n\r\nYesterday President of the Republic, to-day a scavenger. He has sworn,\r\nhe still swears: but the tone has changed. The oath has become an\r\nimprecation. Yesterday he called himself a maiden, to-day he becomes a\r\nbrazen woman, and laughs at his dupes. Picture to yourself Joan of Arc\r\nconfessing herself to be Messalina. Such is the Second of December.\r\n\r\nWomen are mixed up in this treason. It is an outrage which savors both\r\nof the boudoir and of the galleys. There wafts across the fetidness of\r\nblood an undefined scent of patchouli. The accomplices of this act of\r\nbrigandage are most agreeable men--Romieu, Morny. Getting into debt\r\nleads one to commit crimes.\r\n\r\nEurope was astounded. It was a thunder bolt from a thief. It must be\r\nacknowledged that thunder can fall into bad hands, Palmerston, that\r\ntraitor, approved of it. Old Metternich, a dreamer in his villa at\r\nRennweg, shook his head. As to Soult, the man of Austerlitz after\r\nNapoleon, he did what he ought to do, on the very day of the Crime he\r\ndied, Alas! and Austerlitz also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND DAY--THE STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY COME TO ARREST ME\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the Rue Caumartin from the Rue Popincourt, all Paris\r\nhas to be crossed. We found a great apparent calm everywhere. It was one\r\no'clock in the morning when we reached M. de la R----'s house. The\r\n_fiacre_ stopped near a grated door, which M. de la R---- opened with a\r\nlatch-key; on the right, under the archway, a staircase ascended to the\r\nfirst floor of a solitary detached building which M. de la R----\r\ninhabited, and into which he led me.\r\n\r\nWe entered a little drawing-room very richly furnished, lighted with a\r\nnight-lamp, and separated from the bedroom by a tapestry curtain\r\ntwo-thirds drown. M. de la R---- went into the bedroom, and a few minutes\r\nafterwards came back again, accompanied by a charming woman, pale and\r\nfair, in a dressing-gown, her hair down, handsome, fresh, bewildered,\r\ngentle nevertheless, and looking at me with that alarm which in a young\r\nface confers an additional grace. Madame de la R---- had just been\r\nawakened by her husband. She remained a moment on the threshold of her\r\nchamber, smiling, half asleep, greatly astonished, somewhat frightened,\r\nlooking by turns at her husband and at me, never having dreamed perhaps\r\nwhat civil war really meant, and seeing it enter abruptly into her rooms\r\nin the middle of the night under this disquieting form of an unknown\r\nperson who asks for a refuge.\r\n\r\nI made Madame de la R---- a thousand apologies, which she received with\r\nperfect kindness, and the charming woman profited by the incident to go\r\nand caress a pretty little girl of two years old who was sleeping at the\r\nend of the room in her cot, and the child whom she kissed caused her to\r\nforgive the refugee who had awakened her.\r\n\r\nWhile chatting M. de la R---- lighted a capital fire in the grate, and\r\nhis wife, with a pillow and cushions, a hooded cloak belonging to him,\r\nand a pelisse belonging to herself, improvised opposite the fire a bed\r\non a sofa, somewhat short, and which we lengthened by means of an\r\narm-chair.\r\n\r\nDuring the deliberation in the Rue Popincourt, at which I had just\r\npresided, Baudin had lent me his pencil to jot down some names. I still\r\nhad this pencil with me. I made use of it to write a letter to my wife,\r\nwhich Madame de la R---- undertook to convey herself to Madame Victor\r\nHugo the next day. While emptying my pockets I found a box for the\r\n\"Italiens,\" which I offered to Madame de la R----. On that evening\r\n(Tuesday, December 2d) they were to play _Hernani_.\r\n\r\nI looked at that cot, these two handsome, happy young people, and at\r\nmyself, my disordered hair and clothes, my boots covered with mud,\r\ngloomy thoughts in my mind, and I felt like an owl in a nest of\r\nnightingales.\r\n\r\nA few moments afterwards M. and Madame de la R---- had disappeared into\r\ntheir bedroom, and the half-opened curtain was closed. I stretched\r\nmyself, fully dressed as I was, upon the sofa, and this gentle nest\r\ndisturbed by me subsided into its graceful silence.\r\n\r\nOne can sleep on the eve of a battle between two armies, but on the eve\r\nof a battle between citizens there can be no sleep. I counted each hour\r\nas it sounded from a neighboring church; throughout the night there\r\npassed down the street, which was beneath the windows of the room where I\r\nwas lying, carriages which were fleeing from Paris. They succeeded each\r\nother rapidly and hurriedly, one might have imagined it was the exit from\r\na ball. Not being able to sleep, I got up. I had slightly parted the\r\nmuslin curtains of a window, and I tried to look outside; the darkness\r\nwas complete. No stars, clouds were flying by with the turbulent violence\r\nof a winter night. A melancholy wind howled. This wind of clouds\r\nresembled the wind of events.\r\n\r\nI watched the sleeping baby. I waited for dawn. It came. M. de la R----\r\nhad explained at my request in what manner I could go out without\r\ndisturbing any one. I kissed the child's forehead, and left the room. I\r\nwent downstairs, closing the doors behind me as gently as I could, so\r\nnot to wake Madame de la R----. I opened the iron door and went out into\r\nthe street. It was deserted, the shops were still shut, and a milkwoman,\r\nwith her donkey by her side, was quietly arranging her cans on the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nI have not seen M. de la R---- again. I learned since that he wrote to\r\nme in my exile, and that his letter was intercepted. He has, I believe,\r\nquitted France. May this touching page convey to him my kind\r\nremembrances.\r\n\r\nThe Rue Caumartin leads into the Rue St. Lazare. I went towards it. It\r\nwas broad daylight. At every moment I was overtaken and passed by\r\n_fiacres_ laden with trunks and packages, which were hastening towards\r\nthe Havre railway station. Passers-by began to appear. Some baggage\r\ntrains were mounting the Rue St. Lazare at the same time as myself.\r\nOpposite No. 42, formerly inhabited by Mdlle. Mars, I saw a new bill\r\nposted on the wall. I went up to it, I recognized the type of the\r\nNational Printing Office, and I read,\r\n\r\n  \"COMPOSITION OF THE NEW MINISTRY.\r\n\r\n  \"_Interior_           --M. de Morny.\r\n  \"_War_                --The General of Division St. Arnaud.\r\n  \"_Foreign Affairs_    --M. de Turgot.\r\n  \"_Justice_            --M. Rouher.\r\n  \"_Finance_            --M. Fould.\r\n  \"_Marine_             --M. Ducos.\r\n  \"_Public Works_       --M. Magne.\r\n  \"_Public Instruction_ --M.H. Fortuol.\r\n  \"_Commerce_           --M. Lefebre-Duruflé.\"\r\n\r\nI tore down the bill, and threw it into the gutter! The soldiers of the\r\nparty who were leading the wagons watched me do it, and went their way.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue St. Georges, near a side-door, there was another bill. It was\r\nthe \"Appeal to the People.\" Some persons were reading it. I tore it\r\ndown, notwithstanding the resistance of the porter, who appeared to me\r\nto be entrusted with the duty of protecting it.\r\n\r\nAs I passed by the Place Bréda some _fiacres_ had already arrived there.\r\nI took one. I was near home, the temptation was too great, I went there.\r\nOn seeing me cross the courtyard the porter looked at me with a\r\nstupefied air. I rang the bell. My servant, Isidore, opened the door,\r\nand exclaimed with a great cry, \"Ah! it is you, sir! They came during\r\nthe night to arrest you.\" I went into my wife's room. She was in bed,\r\nbut not asleep, and she told me what had happened.\r\n\r\nShe had gone to bed at eleven o'clock. Towards half-past twelve, during\r\nthat species of drowsiness which resembles sleeplessness, she heard\r\nmen's voices. It seemed to her that Isidore was speaking to some one in\r\nthe antechamber. At first she did not take any notice, and tried to go\r\nto sleep again, but the noise of voices continued. She sat up, and rang\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\nIsidore came in. She asked him,\r\n\r\n\"Is any one there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man who wishes to speak to master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your master is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I have told him, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, is not the gentleman going?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madame, he says that he urgently needs to speak to Monsieur Victor\r\nHugo, and that he will wait for him.\"\r\n\r\nIsidore had stopped on the threshold of the bedroom. While he spoke a\r\nfat, fresh-looking man in an overcoat, under which could be seen a black\r\ncoat, appeared at the door behind him.\r\n\r\nMadame Victor Hugo noticed this man, who was silently listening.\r\n\r\n\"Is it you, sir, who wish to speak to Monsieur Victor Hugo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it about? Is it regarding politics?\"\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"As to politics,\" continued my wife, \"what is happening?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe, madame, that all is at an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what sense?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the sense of the President.\"\r\n\r\nMy wife looked fixedly at the man, and said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"You have come to arrest my husband, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, madame,\" answered the man, opening his overcoat, which\r\nrevealed the sash of a Commissary of Police.\r\n\r\nHe added after a pause, \"I am a Commissary of Police, and I am the\r\nbearer of a warrant to arrest M. Victor Hugo. I must institute a search\r\nand look through the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, sir?\" asked Madame Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Hivert.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the terms of the Constitution?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that the Representatives of the People are inviolable!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" she said coldly, \"you know that you are committing a\r\ncrime. Days like this have a to-morrow; proceed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sieur Hivert attempted a few words of explanation, or we should\r\nrather say justification; he muttered the word \"conscience,\" he\r\nstammered the word \"honor.\" Madame Victor Hugo, who had been calm until\r\nthen, could not help interrupting him with some abruptness.\r\n\r\n\"Do your business, sir, and do not argue; you know that every official\r\nwho lays a hand on a Representative of the People commits an act of\r\ntreason. You know that in presence of the Representatives the President\r\nis only an official like the others, the chief charged with carrying out\r\ntheir orders. You dare to come to arrest a Representative in his own\r\nhome like a criminal! There is in truth a criminal here who ought to be\r\narrested--yourself!\"\r\n\r\nThe Sieur Hivert looked sheepish and left the room, and through the\r\nhalf-open door my wife could see, behind the well-fed, well-clothed,\r\nand bald Commissary, seven or eight poor raw-boned devils, wearing dirty\r\ncoats which reached to their feet, and shocking old hats jammed down over\r\ntheir eyes--wolves led by a dog. They examined the room, opened here and\r\nthere a few cupboards, and went away--with a sorrowful air--as Isidore\r\nsaid to me.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary Hivert, above all, hung his head; he raised it, however,\r\nfor one moment. Isidore, indignant at seeing these men thus hunt for his\r\nmaster in every corner, ventured to defy them. He opened a drawer and\r\nsaid, \"Look and see if he is not in here!\" The Commissary of Police\r\ndarted a furious glance at him: \"Lackey, take care!\" The lackey was\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThese men having gone, it was noticed that several of my papers were\r\nmissing. Fragments of manuscripts had been stolen, amongst others one\r\ndated July, 1848, and directed against the military dictatorship of\r\nCavaignac, and in which there were verses written respecting the\r\nCensorship, the councils of war, and the suppression of the newspapers,\r\nand in particular respecting the imprisonment of a great journalist--Emile\r\nde Girardin:--\r\n\r\n    \"... O honte, un lansquenet\r\n    Gauche, et parodiant César dont il hérite,\r\n    Gouverne les esprits du fond de sa guérite!\"\r\n\r\nThese manuscripts are lost.\r\n\r\nThe police might come back at any moment, in fact they did come back a\r\nfew minutes after I had left. I kissed my wife; I would not wake my\r\ndaughter, who had just fallen asleep, and I went downstairs again. Some\r\naffrighted neighbors were waiting for me in the courtyard. I cried out\r\nto them laughingly, \"Not caught yet!\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards I reached No. 10, Rue des Moulins. It\r\nwas not then eight o'clock in the morning, and thinking that my\r\ncolleagues of the Committee of Insurrection had passed the night there,\r\nI thought it might be useful to go and fetch them, so that we might\r\nproceed all together to the Salle Roysin.\r\n\r\nI found only Madame Landrin in the Rue des Moulins. It was thought that\r\nthe house was denounced and watched, and my colleagues had changed their\r\nquarters to No. 7, Rue Villedo, the house of the ex-Constituent Leblond,\r\nlegal adviser to the Workmen's Association. Jules Favre had passed the\r\nnight there. Madame Landrin was breakfasting. She offered me a place by\r\nher side, but time pressed. I carried off a morsel of bread, and left.\r\n\r\nAt No. 7, Rue Villedo, the maid-servant who opened the door to me\r\nushered me into a room where were Carnot, Michel de Bourges, Jules\r\nFavre, and the master of the house, our former colleague, Constituent\r\nLeblond.\r\n\r\n\"I have a carriage downstairs,\" I said to them; \"the rendezvous is at\r\nthe Salle Roysin in the Faubourg St. Antoine; let us go.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not their opinion. According to them the attempts\r\nmade on the previous evening in the Faubourg St. Antoine had revealed\r\nthis portion of the situation; they sufficed; it was useless to persist;\r\nit was obvious that the working-class districts would not rise; we must\r\nturn to the side of the tradesmen's districts, renounce our attempt to\r\nrouse the extremities of the city, and agitate the centre. We were the\r\nCommittee of Resistance, the soul of the insurrection; if we were to go\r\nto the Faubourg St. Antoine, which was occupied by a considerable force,\r\nwe should give ourselves up to Louis Bonaparte. They reminded me of what\r\nI myself had said on the subject the previous evening in the Rue\r\nBlanche. We must immediately organize the insurrection against the _coup\r\nd'état_ and organize it in practicable districts, that is to say, in the\r\nold labyrinths of the streets St. Denis and St. Martin; we must draw up\r\nproclamations, prepare decrees, create some method of publicity; they\r\nwere waiting for important communications from Workmen's Associations\r\nand Secret Societies. The great blow which I wished to strike by our\r\nsolemn meeting at the Salle Roysin would prove a failure; they thought\r\nit their duty to remain where they were; and the Committee being few in\r\nnumber, and the work to be done being enormous, they begged me not to\r\nleave them.\r\n\r\nThey were men of great hearts and great courage who spoke to me; they\r\nwere evidently right; but for myself I could not fail to go to the\r\nrendezvous which I myself had fixed. All the reasons which they had\r\ngiven me were good, nevertheless I could have opposed some doubts, but\r\nthe discussion would have taken too much time, and the hour drew nigh.\r\nI did not make any objections, and I went out of the room, making some\r\nexcuse. My hat was in the antechamber, my _fiacre_ was waiting for me,\r\nand I drove off to the Faubourg St. Antoine.\r\n\r\nThe centre of Paris seemed to have retained its everyday appearance.\r\nPeople came and went, bought and sold, chatted and laughed as usual. In\r\nthe Rue Montorgueil I heard a street organ. Only on nearing the Faubourg\r\nSt. Antoine the phenomenon which I had already noticed on the previous\r\nevening became more and more apparent; solitude reigned, and a certain\r\ndreary peacefulness.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Place de la Bastille.\r\n\r\nMy driver stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" I said to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE BASTILLE TO THE RUE DE COTTE\r\n\r\nThe Place de la Bastille was at the same time empty and filled. Three\r\nregiments in battle array were there; not one passer-by.\r\n\r\nFour harnessed batteries were drawn up at the foot of the column. Here\r\nand there knots of officers talked together in a low voice,--sinister\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nOne of these groups, the principal, attracted my attention. That one\r\nwas silent, there was no talking. There were several men on horseback;\r\none in front of the others, in a general's uniform, with a hat\r\nsurmounted with black feathers, behind this man were two colonels, and\r\nbehind the colonels a party of _aides-de-camp_ and staff officers.\r\nThis lace-trimmed company remained immovable, and as though pointing\r\nlike a dog between the column and the entrance to the Faubourg. At a\r\nshort distance from this group, spread out, and occupying the whole of\r\nthe square, were the regiments drawn up and the cannon in their\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\n\"My driver again stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" I said; \"drive into the Faubourg.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they will prevent us, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth was that they did not prevent us.\r\n\r\nThe driver continued on his way, but hesitatingly, and at a walking\r\npace. The appearance of a _fiacre_ in the square had caused some\r\nsurprise, and the inhabitants began to come out of their houses. Several\r\ncame up to my carriage.\r\n\r\nWe passed by a group of men with huge epaulets. These men, whose tactics\r\nwe understood later on, did not even appear to see us.\r\n\r\nThe emotion which I had felt on the previous day before a regiment of\r\ncuirassiers again seized me. To see before me the assassins of the\r\ncountry, at a few steps, standing upright, in the insolence of a\r\npeaceful triumph, was beyond my strength: I could not contain myself. I\r\ndrew out my sash. I held it in my hand, and putting my arm and head out\r\nof the window of the _fiacre_, and shaking the sash, I shouted,--\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers! Look at this sash. It is the symbol of Law, it is the\r\nNational Assembly visible. Where there this sash is there is Right.\r\nWell, then, this is what Right commands you. You are being deceived. Go\r\nback to your duty. It is a Representative of the People who is speaking\r\nto you, and he who represents the People represents the army. Soldiers,\r\nbefore becoming soldiers you have been peasants, you have been workmen,\r\nyou have been and you are still citizens. Citizens, listen to me when I\r\nspeak to you. The Law alone has the right to command you. Well, to-day\r\nthe law is violated. By whom? By you. Louis Bonaparte draws you into a\r\ncrime. Soldiers, you who are Honor, listen to me, for I am Duty.\r\nSoldiers, Louis Bonaparte assassinates the Republic. Defend it. Louis\r\nBonaparte is a bandit; all his accomplices will follow him to the\r\ngalleys. They are there already. He who is worthy of the galleys is in\r\nthe galleys. To merit fetters is to wear them. Look at that man who is\r\nat your head, and who dares to command you. You take him for a general,\r\nhe is a convict.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers seemed petrified.\r\n\r\nSome one who was there (I thank his generous, devoted spirit) touched my\r\narm, and whispered in my ear, \"You will get yourself shot.\"\r\n\r\nBut I did not heed, and I listened to nothing. I continued, still waving\r\nmy sash,--\"You, who are there, dressed up like a general, it is you to\r\nwhom I speak, sir. You know who I am, I am a Representative of the\r\nPeople, and I know who you are. I have told you you are a criminal.\r\nNow, do you wish to know my name? This is it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I called out my name to him.\r\n\r\nAnd I added,--\r\n\r\n\"Now tell me yours.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\nI continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I do not want to know your name as a general, I shall know\r\nyour number as a galley slave.\"\r\n\r\nThe man in the general's uniform hung his head, the others were silent.\r\nI could read all their looks, however, although they did not raise their\r\neyes. I saw them cast down, and I felt that they were furious. I had an\r\noverwhelming contempt for them, and I passed on.\r\n\r\nWhat was the name of this general? I did not know then, and I do not\r\nknow now.\r\n\r\nOne of the apologies for the _coup d'état_ in relating this incident,\r\nand characterizing it as \"an insensate and culpable provocation,\" states\r\nthat \"the moderation shown by the military leaders on this occasion did\r\nhonor to General ----:\" We leave to the author of this panegyric the\r\nresponsibility of that name and of this eulogium.\r\n\r\nI entered the Rue de Faubourg St. Antoine.\r\n\r\nMy driver, who now knew my name, hesitated no longer, and whipped up his\r\nhorse. These Paris coachmen are a brave and intelligent race.\r\n\r\nAs I passed the first shops of the main street nine o'clock sounded from\r\nthe Church St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" I said to myself, \"I am in time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Faubourg presented an extraordinary aspect. The entrance was\r\nguarded, but not closed, by two companies of infantry. Two other\r\ncompanies were drawn up in echelons farther on, at short distances,\r\noccupying the street, but leaving a free passage. The shops, which were\r\nopen at the end of the Faubourg, were half closed a hundred yards\r\nfarther up. The inhabitants, amongst whom I noticed numerous workmen in\r\nblouses, were talking together at their doors, and watching the\r\nproceedings. I noticed at each step the placards of the _coup d'état_\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fountain which stands at the corner of the Rue de\r\nCharonne the shops were closed. Two lines of soldiers extended on\r\neither side of the street of the Faubourg on the kerb of the pavement;\r\nthe soldiers were stationed at every five paces, with the butts of their\r\nmuskets resting on their hips, their chests drawn in, their right hand\r\non the trigger, ready to bring to the present, keeping silence in the\r\nattitude of expectation. From that point a piece of cannon was stationed\r\nat the mouth of each of the side streets which open out of the main road\r\nof the Faubourg. Occasionally there was a mortar. To obtain a clear idea\r\nof this military arrangement one must imagine two rosaries, extending\r\nalong the two sides of the Faubourg St. Antoine, of which the soldiers\r\nshould form the links and the cannon the beads.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my driver became uneasy. He turned round to me and said, \"It\r\nlooks as though we should find barricades out there, sir; shall we turn\r\nback?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep on,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nHe continued to drive straight on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it became impossible to do so. A company of infantry ranged\r\nthree deep occupied the whole of the street from one pavement to the\r\nother. On the right there was a small street. I said to the driver,--\r\n\r\n\"Take that turning.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to the right and then to the left. We turned into a labyrinth\r\nof streets.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a shot.\r\n\r\nThe driver asked me,--\r\n\r\n\"Which way are we to go, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the direction in which you hear the shots.\"\r\n\r\nWe were in a narrow street; on my left I saw the inscription above a\r\ndoor, \"Grand Lavoir,\" and on my right a square with a central building,\r\nwhich looked like a market. The square and the street were deserted. I\r\nasked the driver,--\r\n\r\n\"What street are we in?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Rue de Cotte.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the Café Roysin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Straight before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drive there.\"\r\n\r\nHe drove on, but slowly. There was another explosion, this time close by\r\nus, the end of the street became filled with smoke; at the moment we\r\nwere passing No. 22, which has a side-door above which I\r\nread, \"Petit Lavoir.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice called out to the driver, \"Stop!\"\r\n\r\nThe driver pulled up, and the window of the _fiacre_ being down, a hand\r\nwas stretched towards mine. I recognized Alexander Rey.\r\n\r\nThis daring man was pale.\r\n\r\n\"Go no further,\" said he; \"all is at an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, all at an end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they must have anticipated the time appointed; the barricade is\r\ntaken: I have just come from it. It is a few steps from here straight\r\nbefore us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n\"Baudin is killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe smoke rolled away from the end of the street.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Alexander Rey to me.\r\n\r\nI saw, a hundred steps before us, at the junction of the Rue de Cotte\r\nand the Rue Ste. Marguerite, a low barricade which the soldiers were\r\npulling down. A corpse was being borne away.\r\n\r\nIt was Baudin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. ANTOINE BARRICADE\r\n\r\nThis is what had happened.\r\n\r\nDuring that same night, and as early as four o'clock in the morning, De\r\nFlotte was in the Faubourg St. Antoine. He was anxious, in case any\r\nmovement took place before daylight, that a Representative of the People\r\nshould be present, and he was one of those who, when the glorious\r\ninsurrection of Right should burst forth, wished to unearth the\r\npaving-stones for the first barricade.\r\n\r\nBut nothing was stirring. De Flotte, alone in the midst of this deserted\r\nand sleeping Faubourg, wandered from street to street throughout the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nDay breaks late in December. Before the first streaks of dawn De Flotte\r\nwas at the rendezvous opposite the Lenoir Market.\r\n\r\nThis spot was only weakly guarded. The only troops in the neighborhood\r\nwere the post itself of the Lenoir Market, and another post at a short\r\ndistance which occupied the guard-house at the corner of the Faubourg and\r\nthe Rue de Montreuil, close to the old Tree of Liberty planted in 1793 by\r\nSanterre. Neither of these posts were commanded by officers.\r\n\r\nDe Flotte reconnoitred the position. He walked some time up and down the\r\npavement, and then seeing no one coming as yet, and fearing to excite\r\nattention, he went away, and returned to the side-streets of the\r\nFaubourg.\r\n\r\nFor his part Aubry (du Nord) got up at five o'clock. Having gone home in\r\nthe middle of the night, on his return from the Rue Popincourt, he had\r\nonly taken three hours' rest. His porter told him that some suspicious\r\npersons had inquired for him during the evening of the 2d, and that they\r\nhad been to the house opposite, No. 12 of the same street, Rue Racine,\r\nto arrest Huguenin. This determined Aubry to leave his house before\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the Faubourg St. Antoine. As he reached the place of\r\nrendezvous he met Cournet and the others from the Rue Popincourt. They\r\nwere almost immediately joined by Malardier.\r\n\r\nIt was dawn. The Faubourg was solitary. They walked along wrapt in\r\nthought and speaking in a low voice. Suddenly an impetuous and singular\r\nprocession passed them.\r\n\r\nThey looked round. It was a detachment of Lancers which surrounded\r\nsomething which in the dim light they recognized to be a police-van. The\r\nvehicle rolled noiselessly along the macadamized road.\r\n\r\nThey were debating what this could mean, when a second and similar group\r\nappeared, then a third, and then a fourth. Ten police vans passed in\r\nthis manner, following each other very closely, and almost touching.\r\n\r\n\"Those are our colleagues!\" exclaimed Aubry (du Nord).\r\n\r\nIn truth the last batch of the Representatives, prisoners of the Quai\r\nd'Orsay, the batch destined for Vincennes, was passing through the\r\nFaubourg. It was about seven o'clock in the morning. Some shops were\r\nbeing opened and were lighted inside, and a few passers-by came out of\r\nthe houses.\r\n\r\nThree carriages defiled one after the other, closed, guarded, dreary,\r\ndumb; no voice came out, no cry, no whisper. They were carrying off in\r\nthe midst of swords, of sabres, and of lances, with the rapidity and\r\nfury of the whirlwind, something which kept silence; and that something\r\nwhich they were carrying off, and which maintained this sinister\r\nsilence, was the broken Tribune, the Sovereignty of the Assemblies, the\r\nsupreme initiative whence all civilization is derived; it was the word\r\nwhich contains the future of the world, it was the speech of France!\r\n\r\nA last carriage arrived, which by some chance had been delayed. It was\r\nabout two or three hundred yards behind the principal convoy, and was\r\nonly escorted by three Lancers. It was not a police-van, it was an\r\nomnibus, the only one in the convoy. Behind the conductor, who was a\r\npolice agent, there could distinctly be seen the Representatives heaped\r\nup in the interior. It seemed easy to rescue them.\r\n\r\nCournet appealed to the passers-by; \"Citizens,\" he cried, \"these are\r\nyour Representatives, who are being carried off! You have just seen\r\nthem pass in the vans of convicts! Bonaparte arrests them contrary to\r\nevery law. Let us rescue them! To arms!\"\r\n\r\nA knot formed of men in blouses and of workmen going to work. A shout\r\ncame from the knot, \"Long live the Republic!\" and some men rushed\r\ntowards the vehicle. The carriage and the Lancers broke into a gallop.\r\n\r\n\"To arms!\" repeated Cournet.\r\n\r\n\"To arms!\" repeated the men of the people.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of impulse. Who knows what might have happened? It\r\nwould have been a singular accident if the first barricade against the\r\n_coup d'état_ had been made with this omnibus, which, after having aided\r\nin the crime, would this have aided in the punishment. But at the moment\r\nwhen the people threw themselves on the vehicle they saw several of the\r\nRepresentative-prisoners which it contained sign to them with both hands\r\nto refrain. \"Eh!\" said a workman, \"they do not wish it!\"\r\n\r\nA second repeated, \"They do not wish for liberty!\"\r\n\r\nAnother added, \"They did not wish us to have it, they do not wish it for\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nAll was said, and the omnibus was allowed to pass on. A moment\r\nafterwards the rear-guard of the escort came up and passed by at a sharp\r\ntrots and the group which surrounded Aubry (du Nord), Malardier, and\r\nCournet dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe Café Roysin had just opened. It may be remembered that the large\r\nhall of this _café_ had served for the meeting of a famous club in 1848.\r\nIt was there, it may also be remembered, that the rendezvous had been\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe Café Roysin is entered by a passage opening out upon the street, a\r\nlobby of some yards in length is next crossed, and then comes a large\r\nhall, with high windows, and looking-glasses on the walls, containing in\r\nthe centre several billiard-tables, some small marble-topped tables,\r\nchairs, and velvet-covered benches. It was this hall, badly arranged,\r\nhowever, for a meeting where we could have deliberated, which had been\r\nthe hall of the Roysin Club. Cournet, Aubry, and Malardier installed\r\nthemselves there. On entering they did not disguise who they were; they\r\nwere welcomed, and shown an exit through the garden in case of\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nDe Flotte had just joined them.\r\n\r\nEight o'clock was striking when the Representatives began to arrive.\r\nBruckner, Maigne, and Brillier first, and then successively Charamaule,\r\nCassal, Dulac, Bourzat, Madier de Montjau, and Baudin. Bourzat, on\r\naccount of the mud, as was his custom, wore wooden shoes. Whoever\r\nthought Bourzat a peasant would be mistaken. He rather resembled a\r\nBenedictine monk. Bourzat, with his southern imagination, his quick\r\nintelligence, keen, lettered, refined, possesses an encyclopedia in his\r\nhead, and wooden shoes on his feet. Why not? He is Mind and People. The\r\nex-Constituent Bastide came in with Madier de Montjau. Baudin shook the\r\nhands of all with warmth, but he did not speak. He was pensive. \"What is\r\nthe matter with you, Baudin?\" asked Aubry (du Nord). \"Are you mournful?\"\r\n\"I?\" said Baudin, raising his head, \"I have never been more happy.\"\r\n\r\nDid he feel himself already chosen? When we are so near death, all\r\nradiant with glory, which smiles upon us through the gloom, perhaps we\r\nare conscious of it.\r\n\r\nA certain number of men, strangers to the Assembly, all as determined as\r\nthe Representatives themselves, accompanied them and surrounded them.\r\n\r\nCournet was the leader. Amongst them there were workmen, but no blouses.\r\nIn order not to alarm the middle classes the workmen had been\r\nrequested, notably those employed by Derosne and Cail, to come in coats.\r\n\r\nBaudin had with him a copy of the Proclamation which I had dictated to\r\nhim on the previous day. Cournet unfolded it and read it. \"Let us at\r\nonce post it up in the Faubourg,\" said he. \"The People must know that\r\nLouis Bonaparte is outlawed.\" A lithographic workman who was there\r\noffered to print it without delay. All the Representatives present\r\nsigned it, and they added my name to their signatures. Aubry (du Nord)\r\nheaded it with these words, \"National Assembly.\" The workman carried off\r\nthe Proclamation, and kept his word. Some hours afterwards Aubry (du\r\nNord), and later on a friend of Cournet's named Gay, met him in the\r\nFaubourg du Temple paste-pot in hand, posting the Proclamation at every\r\nstreet corner, even next to the Maupas placard, which threatened the\r\npenalty of death to any one who should be found posting an appeal to\r\narms. Groups read the two bills at the same time. We may mention an\r\nincident which ought to be noted, a sergeant of the line, in uniform, in\r\nred trousers, accompanied him and protected him. He was doubtless a\r\nsoldier who had lately left the service.\r\n\r\nThe time fixed on the preceding evening for the general rendezvous was\r\nfrom nine to ten in the morning. This hour had been chosen so that there\r\nshould be time to give notice to all the members of the Left; it was\r\nexpedient to wait until the Representatives should arrive, so that the\r\ngroup should the more resemble an Assembly, and that its manifestation\r\nshould have more authority on the Faubourg.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Representatives who had already arrived had no sash of\r\noffice. Some were made hastily in a neighboring house with strips of\r\nred, white, and blue calico, and were brought to them. Baudin and De\r\nFlotte were amongst those who girded on these improvised sashes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it was not yet nine o'clock, when impatience already began to\r\nbe manifested around them.[9]\r\n\r\nMany shared this glorious impatience.\r\n\r\nBaudin wished to wait.\r\n\r\n\"Do not anticipate the hour,\" said he; \"let us allow our colleagues time\r\nto arrive.\"\r\n\r\nBut they murmured round Baudin, \"No, begin, give the signal, go outside.\r\nThe Faubourg only waits to see your sashes to rise. You are few in\r\nnumber, but they know that your friends will rejoin you. That is\r\nsufficient. Begin.\"\r\n\r\nThe result proved that this undue haste could only produce a failure.\r\nMeanwhile they considered that the first example which the\r\nRepresentatives of the People ought to set was personal courage. The\r\nspark must not be allowed to die out. To march the first, to march at\r\nthe head, such was their duty. The semblance of any hesitation would\r\nhave been in truth more disastrous than any degree of rashness.\r\n\r\nSchoelcher is of an heroic nature, he has the grand impatience of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go,\" he cried; \"our friends will join us, let us go outside.\"\r\n\r\nThey had no arms.\r\n\r\n\"Let us disarm the post which is over there,\" said Schoelcher.\r\n\r\nThey left the Salle Roysin in order, two by two, arm in arm. Fifteen or\r\ntwenty men of the people escorted them. They went before them, crying,\r\n\"Long live the Republic! To arms!\"\r\n\r\nSome children preceded and followed them, shouting, \"Long live the\r\nMountain!\"\r\n\r\nThe entrances of the closed shops were half opened. A few men appeared\r\nat the doors, a few women showed themselves at the windows. Knots of\r\nworkmen going to their work watched them pass. They cried, \"Long live\r\nour Representatives! Long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nSympathy was everywhere, but insurrection nowhere. The procession\r\ngathered few adherents on the way.\r\n\r\nA man who was leading a saddled horse joined them. They did not know\r\nthis man, nor whence this horse came. It seemed as if the man offered\r\nhis services to any one who wished to fly. Representative Dulac ordered\r\nthis man to be off.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they reached the guard-house of the Rue de Montrenil. At\r\ntheir approach the sentry gave the alarm, and the soldiers came out of\r\nthe guard-house in disorder.\r\n\r\nSchoelcher, calm, impassive, in ruffles and a white tie, clothed, as\r\nusual, in black, buttoned to the neck in his tight frock coat, with the\r\nintrepid and brotherly air of a Quaker, walked straight up to them.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades,\" he said to them, \"we are the Representatives of the People,\r\nand come in the name of the people to demand your arms for the defence\r\nof the Constitution and of the Laws!\"\r\n\r\nThe post allowed itself to be disarmed. The sergeant alone made any show\r\nof resistance, but they said to him, \"You are alone,\" and he yielded.\r\nThe Representatives distributed the guns and the cartridges to the\r\nresolute band which surrounded them.\r\n\r\nSome soldiers exclaimed, \"Why do you take away our muskets! We would\r\nfight for you and with you!\"\r\n\r\nThe Representatives consulted whether they should accept this offer.\r\nSchoelcher was inclined to do so. But one of them remarked that some\r\nMobile Guards had made the same overtures to the insurgents of June, and\r\nhad turned against the Insurrection the arms which the Insurrection had\r\nleft them.\r\n\r\nThe muskets therefore were not restored.\r\n\r\nThe disarming having been accomplished, the muskets were counted; there\r\nwere fifteen of them.\r\n\r\n\"We are a hundred and fifty,\" said Cournet, \"we have not enough\r\nmuskets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Schoelcher, \"where is there a post?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the Lenoir Market.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us disarm it.\"\r\n\r\nWith Schoelcher at their head and escorted by fifteen armed men the\r\nRepresentatives proceeded to the Lenoir Market. The post of the Lenoir\r\nMarket allowed themselves to be disarmed even more willingly than the\r\npost in the Rue de Montreuil. The soldiers turned themselves round so\r\nthat the cartridges might be taken from their pouches.\r\n\r\nThe muskets were immediately loaded.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" exclaimed De Flotte, \"we have thirty guns, let us look for a\r\nstreet corner, and raise a barricade.\"\r\n\r\nThere were at that time about two hundred combatants.\r\n\r\nThey went up the Rue de Montreuil.\r\n\r\nAfter some fifty steps Schoelcher said, \"Where are we going? We are\r\nturning our backs on the Bastille. We are turning our backs upon the\r\nconflict.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned towards the Faubourg.\r\n\r\nThey shouted, \"To arms!\" They Where answered by \"Long live our\r\nRepresentatives!\" But only a few young men joined them. It was evident\r\nthat the breeze of insurrection was not blowing.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said De Flotte, \"let us begin the battle. Let us achieve\r\nthe glory of being the first killed.\"\r\n\r\nAs they reached the point where the Streets Ste. Marguerite and de Cotte\r\nopen out and divide the Faubourg, a peasant's cart laden with dung\r\nentered the Rue Ste. Marguerite.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" exclaimed De Flotte.\r\n\r\nThey stopped the dung-cart, and overturned it in the middle of the\r\nFaubourg St. Antoine.\r\n\r\nA milkwoman came up.\r\n\r\nThey overturned the milk-cart.\r\n\r\nA baker was passing in his bread-cart. He saw what was being done,\r\nattempted to escape, and urged his horse to a gallop. Two or three\r\nstreet Arabs--those children of Paris brave as lions and agile as\r\ncats--sped after the baker, ran past his horse, which was still\r\ngalloping, stopped it, and brought back the cart to the barricade which\r\nhad been begun.\r\n\r\nThey overturned the bread-cart.\r\n\r\nAn omnibus came up on the road from the Bastille.\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" said the conductor, \"I see what is going on.\"\r\n\r\nHe descended with a good grace, and told his passengers to get\r\ndown, while the coachman unharnessed his horses and went away shaking\r\nhis cloak.\r\n\r\nThey overturned the omnibus.\r\n\r\nThe four vehicles placed end to end barely barred the street of the\r\nFaubourg, which in this part is very wide. While putting them in line\r\nthe men of the barricade said,--\r\n\r\n\"Let us not injure the carts more than we can help.\"\r\n\r\nThis formed an indifferent barricade, very low, too short, and which\r\nleft the pavements free on either side.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a staff officer passed by followed by an orderly, saw the\r\nbarricade, and fled at a gallop.\r\n\r\nSchoelcher calmly inspected the overturned vehicles. When he reached the\r\npeasant's cart, which made a higher heap than the others, he said, \"that\r\nis the only good one.\"\r\n\r\nThe barricade grew larger. They threw a few empty baskets upon it, which\r\nmade it thicker and larger without strengthening it.\r\n\r\nThey were still working when a child came up to them shouting, \"The\r\nsoldiers!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth two companies arrived from the Bastille, at the double, through\r\nthe Faubourg, told off in squads at short distances apart, and barring\r\nthe whole of the street.\r\n\r\nThe doors and the windows were hastily closed.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, at a corner of the barricade, Bastide, impassive, was\r\ngravely telling a story to Madier de Montjau. \"Madier,\" said he, \"nearly\r\ntwo hundred years ago the Prince de Condé, ready to give battle in this\r\nvery Faubourg St. Antoine, where we now are, asked an officer who was\r\naccompanying him, 'Have you ever seen a battle lost?'--'No, sire.'\r\n'Well, then, you will see one now.'--Madier, I tell you to-day,--you\r\nwill speedily see a barricade taken.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile those who were armed had assumed their places for the\r\nconflict behind the barricade.\r\n\r\nThe critical moment drew nigh.\r\n\r\n\"Citizens,\" cried Schoelcher, \"do not fire a shot. When the Army and the\r\nFaubourgs fight, the blood of the People is shed on both sides. Let us\r\nspeak to the soldiers first.\"\r\n\r\nHe mounted on one of the baskets which heightened the barricade. The\r\nother Representatives arranged themselves near him on the omnibus.\r\nMalardier and Dulac were on his right. Dulac said to him, \"You scarcely\r\nknow me, Citizen Schoelcher, but I love you. Let me have the charge of\r\nremaining by your side. I only belong to the second rank in the\r\nAssembly, but I want to be in the first rank of the battle.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment some men in blouses, those whom the Second of December\r\nhad enlisted, appeared at the corner of the Rue Ste. Marguerite, close\r\nto the barricade, and shouted, \"Down with the 'Twenty-five francs!'\"\r\n\r\nBaudin who had already selected his post for the combat, and who was\r\nstanding on the barricade, looked fixedly at these men, and said to\r\nthem,--\r\n\r\n\"You shall see how one can die for 'twenty-five francs!'\"\r\n\r\nThere was a noise in the street. Some few doors which had remained half\r\nopened were closed. The two attacking columns had arrived in sight of\r\nthe barricade. Further on could be seen confusedly other lines of\r\nbayonets. They were those which had barred my passage.\r\n\r\nSchoelcher, raising his arm with authority, signed to the captain, who\r\ncommanded the first squad, to halt.\r\n\r\nThe captain made a negative sign with his sword. The whole of the Second\r\nof December was in these two gestures. The Law said, \"Halt!\" The Sabre\r\nanswered, \"No!\"\r\n\r\nThe two companies continued to advance, but slowly, and keeping at the\r\nsame distance from each other.\r\n\r\nSchoelcher came down from the barricade into the street. De Flotte,\r\nDulac, Malardier, Brillier, Maigne, and Bruckner followed him.\r\n\r\nThen was seen a grand spectacle.\r\n\r\nSeven Representatives of the People, armed only with their sashes, that\r\nis to say, majestically clothed with Law and Right, advanced in the\r\nstreet beyond the barricade, and marched straight to the soldiers, who\r\nawaited them with their guns pointed at them.\r\n\r\nThe other Representatives who had remained at the barricade made their\r\nlast preparations for resistance. The combatants maintained an intrepid\r\nbearing. The Naval Lieutenant Cournet towered above them all with his\r\ntall stature. Baudin, still standing on the overturned omnibus, leaned\r\nhalf over the barricade.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the Representatives approach, the soldiers and their officers\r\nwere for the moment bewildered. Meanwhile the captain signed to the\r\nRepresentatives to stop.\r\n\r\nThey stopped, and Schoelcher said in an impressive voice,--\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers! we are the Representatives of the Sovereign People, we are\r\nyour Representatives, we are the Elect of Universal Suffrage. In the\r\nname of the Constitution, in the name of Universal Suffrage, in the name\r\nof the Republic, we, who are the National Assembly, we, who are the Law,\r\norder you to join us, we summon you to obey. We ourselves are your\r\nleaders. The Army belongs to the People, and the Representatives of the\r\nPeople are the Chiefs of the Army. Soldiers! Louis Bonaparte violates\r\nthe Constitution, we have outlawed him. Obey us.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer who was in command, a captain named Petit, did not allow him\r\nto finish.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have my orders. I belong to the People. I am a\r\nRepublican as you are, but I am only an instrument.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the Constitution?\" said Schoelcher.\r\n\r\n\"I only know my instructions.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an instruction above all other instructions,\" continued\r\nSchoelcher, \"obligatory upon the Soldier as upon the Citizen--the Law.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned again towards the soldiers to harangue them, but the captain\r\ncried out to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Not another word! You shall not go on! If you add one word, I shall\r\ngive the order to fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter to us?\" said Schoelcher.\r\n\r\nAt this moment an officer arrived on horseback. It was the major of the\r\nregiment. He whispered for a moment to the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen! Representatives!\" continued the captain, waving his sword,\r\n\"withdraw, or I shall fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" shouted De Flotte.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives--strange and heroic copy of Fontenoy--took off their\r\nhats, and faced the muskets.\r\n\r\nSchoelcher alone kept his hat on his head, and waited with his arms\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\n\"Fix bayonets,\" said the captain. And turning towards the squads,\r\n\"Charge!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vive la République!\" cried out the Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe\r\nbayonets were lowered, the companies moved forward, the soldiers came on\r\nat the double upon the motionless Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible and superb moment.\r\n\r\nThe seven Representatives saw the bayonets at their breasts without a\r\nword, without a gesture, without one step backwards. But the hesitation\r\nwhich was not in their soul was in the heart of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers felt distinctly that this was a double stain upon their\r\nuniform--the outrage upon the Representatives of the People--which was\r\ntreason, and the slaughter of unarmed men, which was cowardice. Now\r\ntreason and cowardice are two epaulets to which a general sometimes\r\nbecomes reconciled, the soldier--never.\r\n\r\nWhen the bayonets were so close to the Representatives that they touched\r\ntheir breasts, they turned aside of their own accord, and the soldier's\r\nby an unanimous movement passed between the Representatives without\r\ndoing them any harm. Schoelcher alone had his coat pierced in two\r\nplaces, and in his opinion this was awkwardness instead of intention.\r\nOne of the soldiers who faced him wished to push him away from the\r\ncaptain, and touched him with his bayonet. The point encountered the\r\nbook of the addresses of the Representatives, which Schoelcher had in\r\nhis pocket, and only pierced his clothing.\r\n\r\nA soldier said to De Flotte, \"Citizen, we do not wish to hurt you.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless a soldier came up to Bruckner and pointed his gun at him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Bruckner, \"fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier, touched, lowered his arm, and shook Bruckner's hand.\r\n\r\nIt was singular that, notwithstanding the order given by the officers,\r\nthe two companies successively came up to the Representatives, charged\r\nwith the bayonet, and turned aside. Instructions may order, but instinct\r\nprevails; instructions may be crime, but instinct is honor. Major P----\r\nsaid afterwards, \"They had told us that we should have to deal with\r\nbrigands, we had to deal with heroes.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile those on the barricade were growing uneasy, and seeing their\r\ncolleagues surrounded, and wishing to succor them, they fired a musket\r\nshot. This unfortunate shot killed a soldier between De Flotte and\r\nSchoelcher.\r\n\r\nThe officer who commanded the second attacking squad passed close to\r\nSchoelcher as the poor soldier fell. Schoelcher pointed out the fallen\r\nman to the officer, and said to him, \"Lieutenant, look!\"\r\n\r\nThe officer answered by a gesture of despair,--\r\n\r\n\"What would you have us do?\"\r\n\r\nThe two companies replied to the shot by a general volley, and rushed to\r\nthe assault of the barricade, leaving behind them the seven\r\nRepresentatives astounded at being still alive.\r\n\r\nThe barricade replied by a volley, but it could not hold out. It was\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nBaudin was killed.\r\n\r\nHe had remained standing in his position on the omnibus. Three balls\r\nreached him. One struck him in the right eye and penetrated into the\r\nbrain. He fell. He never regained consciousness. Half-an-hour afterwards\r\nhe was dead. His body was taken to the Ste. Marguerite Hospital.\r\n\r\nBourzat, who was close to Baudin, with Aubry (du Nord), had his coat\r\npierced by a ball.\r\n\r\nWe must again remark a curious incident,--the soldiers made no prisoner\r\non this barricade. Those who defended it dispersed through the streets\r\nof the Faubourg, or took refuge in the neighboring houses. Representative\r\nMaigne, pushed by some affrighted women behind a door, was shut in with\r\none of the soldiers who had just taken the barricade. A moment afterwards\r\nthe soldier and the Representative went out together. The Representatives\r\ncould freely leave this first field of battle.\r\n\r\nAt this solemn moment of the struggle a last glimmer of Justice and of\r\nRight still flickered, and military honesty recoiled with a sort of\r\ndread anxiety before the outrage upon which they were entering. There is\r\nthe intoxication of good, and there is an intoxication of evil: this\r\nintoxication later on drowned the conscience of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe French Army is not made to commit crimes. When the struggle became\r\nprolonged, and ferocious orders of the day had to be executed, the\r\nsoldiers must have been maddened. They obeyed not coldly, which would\r\nhave been monstrous, but with anger, and this History will invoke as\r\ntheir excuse; and with many, perhaps, despair was at the root of their\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nThe fallen soldier had remained on the ground. It was Schoelcher who\r\nraised him. A few women, weeping, but brave, came out of a house. Some\r\nsoldiers came up. They carried him, Schoelcher holding his head, first\r\nto a fruiterer's shop, then to the Ste. Marguerite Hospital, where they\r\nhad already taken Baudin.\r\n\r\nHe was a conscript. The ball had entered his side. Through his gray\r\novercoat buttoned to the collar, could be seen a hole stained with\r\nblood. His head had sunk on his shoulder, his pale countenance,\r\nencircled by the chinstrap of his shako, had no longer any expression,\r\nthe blood oozed out of his mouth. He seemed barely eighteen years old.\r\nAlready a soldier and still a boy. He was dead.\r\n\r\nThis poor soldier was the first victim of the _coup d'état_. Baudin was\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nBefore being a Republican Baudin had been a tutor. He came from that\r\nintelligent and brave race of schoolmasters ever persecuted, who have\r\nfallen from the Guizot Law into the Falloux Law, and from the Falloux\r\nLaw into the Dupanloup Law. The crime of the schoolmaster is to hold a\r\nbook open; that suffices, the Church condemns him. There is now, in\r\nFrance, in each village, a lighted torch--the schoolmaster--and a mouth\r\nwhich blows upon it--the curé. The schoolmasters of France, who knew how\r\nto die of hunger for Truth and for Science, were worthy that one of\r\ntheir race should be killed for Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe first time that I saw Baudin was at the Assembly on January 13,\r\n1850. I wished to speak against the Law of Instruction. I had not put my\r\nname down; Baudin's name stood second. He offered me his turn. I\r\naccepted, and I was able to speak two days afterwards, on the 15th.\r\n\r\nBaudin was one of the targets of Sieur Dupin, for calls to order and\r\nofficial annoyances. He shared this honor with the Representatives Miot\r\nand Valentin.\r\n\r\nBaudin ascended the Tribune several times. His mode of speaking,\r\noutwardly hesitating, was energetic in the main. He sat on the crest of\r\nthe Mountain. He had a firm spirit and timid manners. Thence there was in\r\nhis constitution an indescribable embarrassment, mingled with decision.\r\nHe was a man of middle height. His face ruddy and full, his broad chest,\r\nhis wide shoulders announced the robust man, the laborer-schoolmaster,\r\nthe peasant-thinker. In this he resembled Bourzat. Baudin leaned his head\r\non his shoulder, listened with intelligence, and spoke with a gentle and\r\ngrave voice. He had the melancholy air and the bitter smile of the\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the Second of December I had asked him, \"How old are\r\nyou?\" He had answered me, \"Not quite thirty-three years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-nine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he replied,--\r\n\r\n\"To-day we are of the same age.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought in truth of that to-morrow which awaited us, and in which was\r\nhidden that \"perhaps\" which is the great leveller.\r\n\r\nThe first shots had been fired, a Representative had fallen, and the\r\npeople did not rise! What bandage had they on their eyes, what weight\r\nhad they on their hearts? Alas! the gloom which Louis Bonaparte had\r\nknown how to cast over his crime, far from lifting, grew denser. For the\r\nfirst time in the sixty years, that the Providential era of Revolutions\r\nhad been open, Paris, the city of intelligence, seemed not to\r\nunderstand!\r\n\r\nOn leaving the barricade of the Rue Ste. Marguerite, De Flotte went to\r\nthe Faubourg St. Marceau, Madier de Montjau went to Belleville,\r\nCharamaule and Maigne proceeded to the Boulevards. Schoelcher, Dulac,\r\nMalardier, and Brillier again went up the Faubourg St. Antoine by the\r\nside streets which the soldiers had not yet occupied. They shouted,\r\n\"Vive la République!\" They harangued the people on the doorsteps: \"Is it\r\nthe Empire that you want?\" exclaimed Schoelcher. They even went as far\r\nas to sing the \"Marseillaise.\" People took off their hats as they passed\r\nand shouted \"Long live the Representatives!\" But that was all.\r\n\r\nThey were thirsty and weary. In the Rue de Reuilly a man came out of a\r\ndoor with a bottle in his hand, and offered them drink.\r\n\r\nSartin joined them on the way. In the Rue de Charonne they entered the\r\nmeeting-place of the Association of Cabinet Makers, hoping to find there\r\nthe committee of the association in session. There was no\r\none there. But nothing discouraged them.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the Place de la Bastille, Dulac said to Schoelcher, \"I\r\nwill ask permission to leave you for an hour or two, for this reason: I\r\nam alone in Paris with my little daughter, who is seven years old. For\r\nthe past week she has had scarlet fever. Yesterday, when the _coup\r\nd'état_ burst forth, she was at death's door. I have no one but this\r\nchild in the world. I left her this morning to come with you, and she\r\nsaid to me, 'Papa, where are you going?' As I am not killed, I will go\r\nand see if she is not dead.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards the child was still living, and we were holding a\r\npermanent sitting at No. 15, Rue Richelieu, Jules Favre, Carnot, Michel\r\nde Bourges, and myself, when Dulac entered, and said to us, \"I have come\r\nto place myself at your disposal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] \"There was also a misunderstanding respecting the appointed time.\r\nSome made a mistake, and thought it was nine o'clock. The first arrivals\r\nimpatiently awaited their colleagues. They were, as we have said, some\r\ntwelve or fifteen in number at half-past eight. 'Time is being lost,'\r\nexclaimed one of them who had hardly entered; 'let us gird on our sashes;\r\nlet us show the Representatives to the People, let us join it in raising\r\nbarricades.' We shall perhaps save the country, at all events we shall\r\nsave the honor of our party. 'Come, let us to the barricades!' This\r\nadvice was immediately and unanimously acclaimed: one alone, Citizen\r\nBaudin, interposed the forcible objection, 'we are not sufficiently\r\nnumerous to adopt such a resolution.' But he spiritedly joined in the\r\ngeneral enthusiasm, and with a calm conscience, after having reserved\r\nthe principle, he was not the last to gird on his sash.\"--SCHOELCHER,\r\n_Histoire des Crimes du 2d Decembre_, pp. 130-131.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORKMEN'S SOCIETIES ASK US FOR THE ORDER TO FIGHT\r\n\r\nIn presence of the fact of the barricade of the Faubourg St. Antoine so\r\nheroically constructed by the Representatives, so sadly neglected by the\r\npopulace, the last illusions, even mine, should have been dispersed.\r\nBaudin killed, the Faubourg cold. Such things spoke aloud. It was a\r\nsupreme, manifest, absolute demonstration of that fact, the inaction of\r\nthe people, to which I could not resign myself--a deplorable inaction,\r\nif they understood, a self-treason, if they did not understand, a fatal\r\nneutrality in every case, a calamity of which all the responsibility, we\r\nrepeat, recoiled not upon the people but upon those who in June, 1848,\r\nafter having promised them amnesty, had refused it, and who had unhinged\r\nthe great soul of the people of Paris by breaking faith with them. What\r\nthe Constituent Assembly had sown the Legislative Assembly harvested.\r\nWe, innocent of the fault, had to submit to the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe spark which we had seen flash for an instant through the\r\ncrowd--Michel de Bourges from the height of Bonvalet's balcony, myself\r\nfrom the Boulevard du Temple--this spark seemed extinguished. Maigne\r\nfirstly, then Brillier, then Bruckner, later on Charmaule, Madier de\r\nMontjau, Bastide, and Dulac came to report to us what had passed at the\r\nbarricade of St. Antoine, the motives which had decided the\r\nRepresentatives present not to await the hour appointed for the\r\nrendezvous, and Baudin's death. The report which I made myself of what I\r\nhad seen, and which Cassal and Alexander Rey completed by adding new\r\ncircumstances, enabled us to ascertain the situation. The Committee could\r\nno longer hesitate: I myself renounced the hopes which I had based upon a\r\ngrand manifestation, upon a powerful reply to the _coup d'état_, upon a\r\nsort of pitched battle waged by the guardians of the Republic against the\r\nbanditti of the Elysée. The Faubourgs failed us; we possessed the\r\nlever--Right, but the mass to be raised, the People, we did not possess.\r\nThere was nothing more to hope for, as those two great orators, Michel de\r\nBourges and Jules Favre, with their keen political perception, had\r\ndeclared from the first, save a slow long struggle, avoiding decisive\r\nengagements, changing quarters, keeping Paris on the alert, saying to\r\neach, It is not at an end; leaving time for the departments to prepare\r\ntheir resistance, wearying the troops out, and in which struggle the\r\nParisian people, who do not long smell powder with impunity, would\r\nperhaps ultimately take fire. Barricades raised everywhere, barely\r\ndefended, re-made immediately, disappearing and multiplying themselves at\r\nthe same time, such was the strategy indicated by the situation. The\r\nCommittee adopted it, and sent orders in every direction to this effect.\r\nAt that moment we were sitting at No. 15, Rue Richelieu, at the house of\r\nour colleague Grévy, who had been arrested in the Tenth Arrondissement on\r\nthe preceding day, who was at Mazas. His brother had offered us his house\r\nfor our deliberations. The Representatives, our natural emissaries,\r\nflocked around us, and scattered themselves throughout Paris, with our\r\ninstructions to organize resistance at every point. They were the arms\r\nand the Committee was the soul. A certain number of ex-Constituents,\r\nintrepid men, Garnier-Pagès, Marie, Martin (de Strasbourg), Senart,\r\nformerly President of the Constituent Assembly, Bastide, Laissac,\r\nLandrin, had joined the Representatives on the preceding day. They\r\nestablished, therefore, in all the districts where it was possible\r\nCommittees of Permanence in connection with us, the Central Committee,\r\nand composed either of Representatives or of faithful citizens. For our\r\nwatchword we chose \"Baudin.\"\r\n\r\nTowards noon the centre of Paris began to grow agitated.\r\n\r\nOur appeal to arms was first seen placarded on the Place de la Bourse\r\nand the Rue Montmartre. Groups pressed round to read it, and battled\r\nwith the police, who endeavored to tear down the bills. Other\r\nlithographic placards contained in two parallel columns the decree of\r\ndeposition drawn up by the Right at the Mairie of the Tenth\r\nArrondissement, and the decree of outlawry voted by the Left. There were\r\ndistributed, printed on gray paper in large type, the judgment of the\r\nHigh Court of Justice, declaring Louis Bonaparte attainted with the\r\nCrime of High Treason, and signed \"Hardouin\" (President), \"Delapalme,\"\r\n\"Moreau\" (of the Seine), \"Cauchy,\" \"Bataille\" (Judges). This last name\r\nwas thus mis-spelt by mistake, it should read \"Pataille.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment people generally believed, and we ourselves believed, in\r\nthis judgment, which, as we have seen, was not the genuine judgment.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they posted in the populous quarters, at the corner of\r\nevery street, two Proclamations. The first ran thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"TO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE III.[10]\r\n\r\n  \"The Constitution is confided to the keeping and to the patriotism of\r\n  French citizens. Louis NAPOLEON is outlawed.\r\n\r\n  \"The State of Siege is abolished.\r\n\r\n  \"Universal suffrage is re-established.\r\n\r\n  \"LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n  \"To ARMS!\r\n\r\n  \"For the United Mountain.\r\n\r\n  \"The Delegate, VICTOR HUGO.\"\r\n\r\nThe second ran thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"INHABITANTS OF PARIS.\r\n\r\n  \"The National Guards and the People of the Departments are marching on\r\n  Paris to aid you in seizing the TRAITOR, Louis Napoléon BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n  \"For the Representatives of the People,\r\n\r\n  \"VICTOR HUGO, President.\r\n\r\n  \"SCHOELCHER, Secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThis last placard, printed on little squares of paper, was distributed\r\nabroad, says an historian of the _coup d'état_, by thousands of copies.\r\n\r\nFor their part the criminals installed in the Government offices replied\r\nby threats: the great white placards, that is to say, the official\r\nbills, were largely multiplied. On one could be read:--\r\n\r\n  \"WE, PREFECT OF THE POLICE,\r\n\r\n  \"Decree as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE I. All meetings are rigorously prohibited. They will be\r\n  immediately dispersed by force.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE II. All seditious shouts, all reading in public, all posting\r\n  of political documents not emanating from a regularly constituted\r\n  authority, are equally prohibited.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE III. The agents of the Public Police will enforce the execution\r\n  of the present decree.\r\n\r\n  \"Given at the Prefecture of Police, December 3, 1851.\r\n\r\n  \"DE MAUPAS, Prefect of Police.\r\n\r\n  \"Seen and approved,\r\n\r\n  \"DE MORNY, Minister of the Interior.\"\r\n\r\nOn another could be read,--\r\n\r\n  \"THE MINISTER OF WAR,\r\n\r\n  \"By virtue of the Law on the State of Siege,\r\n\r\n  \"Decrees:--\r\n\r\n  \"Every person taken constructing or defending a barricade, or carrying\r\n  arms, WILL BE SHOT.\r\n\r\n  \"General of Division,\r\n\r\n  \"Minister of war,\r\n\r\n  \"DE SAINT-ARNAUD.\"\r\n\r\nWe reproduce this Proclamation exactly, even to the punctuation. The\r\nwords \"Will be shot\" were in capital letters in the placards signed \"De\r\nSaint-Arnaud.\"\r\n\r\nThe Boulevards were thronged with an excited crowd. The agitation\r\nincreasing in the centre reached three Arrondissements, the 6th, 7th,\r\nand the 12th. The district of the schools began to disorderly. The\r\nStudents of Law and of Medicine cheered De Flotte on the Place de\r\nPanthéon. Madier de Montjau, ardent and eloquent, went through and\r\naroused Belleville. The troops, growing more numerous every moment,\r\ntook possession of all the strategical points of Paris.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock, a young man was brought to us by the legal adviser of\r\nthe Workmen's Societies, the ex-Constituent Leblond, at whose house the\r\nCommittee had deliberated that morning. We were sitting in permanence,\r\nCarnot, Jules Favre, Michel de Bourges, and myself. This young man, who\r\nhad an earnest mode of speaking and an intelligent countenance, was\r\nnamed King. He had been sent to us by the Committee of the Workmen's\r\nSociety, from whom he was delegated. \"The Workmen's Societies,\" he said\r\nto us, \"place themselves at the disposal of the Committee of Legal\r\nInsurrection appointed by the Left. They can throw into the struggle\r\nfive or six thousand resolute men. They will manufacture powder; as for\r\nguns, they will be found.\" The Workmen's Society requested from us an\r\norder to fight signed by us. Jules Favre took a pen and wrote,--\"The\r\nundersigned Representatives authorize Citizen King and his friends to\r\ndefend with them, and with arms in their hands, Universal Suffrage, the\r\nRepublic, the Laws.\" He dated it, and we all four signed it. \"That is\r\nenough,\" said the delegate to us, \"you will hear of us.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards it was reported to us that the conflict had begun.\r\nThey were fighting in the Rue Aumaire.\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] A typographical error--it should read \"Article LXVIII.\" On the\r\nsubject of this placard the author of this book received the following\r\nletter. It does honor to those who wrote it:--\r\n\r\n  \"CITIZEN VICTOR HUGO,--We know that you have made an appeal to arms. We\r\n  have not been able to obtain it. We replace it by these bills which we\r\n  sign with your name. You will not disown us. When France is in danger\r\n  your name belongs to all; your name is a Public Power.\r\n\r\n  \"FELIX BONY.\r\n\r\n  \"DABAT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAUDINS'S CORPSE\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Faubourg St. Antoine, we had, as I said, lost nearly\r\nall hope, but the men of the _coup d'état_ had not lost all uneasiness.\r\nSince the attempts at rising and the barricades of the morning a rigorous\r\nsupervision had been organized. Any one who entered the Faubourg ran the\r\nrisk of being examined, followed, and upon the slightest suspicion,\r\narrested. The supervision was nevertheless sometimes at fault. About two\r\no'clock a short man, with an earnest and attentive air, crossed the\r\nFaubourg. A _sergent de ville_ and a police agent in plain clothes barred\r\nhis passage. \"Who are you?\" \"You seem a passenger.\" \"Where are you going?\"\r\n\"Over there, close by, to Bartholomé's, the overseer of the sugar\r\nmanufactory.--\" They search him. He himself opened his pocket-book; the\r\npolice agents turned out the pockets of his waistcoat and unbuttoned\r\nhis shirt over his breast; finally the _sergent de ville_ said gruffly,\r\n\"Yet I seem to have seen you here before this morning. Be off!\" It was\r\nthe Representative Gindrier. If they had not stopped at the pockets of\r\nhis waistcoat--and if they had searched his great-coat, they would have\r\nfound his sash there--Gindrier would have been shot.\r\n\r\nNot to allow themselves to be arrested, to keep their freedom for the\r\ncombat--such was the watchword of the members of the Left. That is why\r\nwe had our sashes upon us, but not outwardly visible.\r\n\r\nGindrier had had no food that day; he thought he would go home, and\r\nreturned to the new district of the Havre Railway Station, where he\r\nresided. In the Rue de Calais, which is a lonely street running from Rue\r\nBlanche to the Rue de Clichy, a _fiacre_ passed him. Gindrier heard his\r\nname called out. He turned round and saw two persons in a _fiacre_,\r\nrelations of Baudin, and a man whom he did not know. One of the\r\nrelations of Baudin, Madame L----, said to him, \"Baudin is\r\nwounded!\" She added, \"They have taken him to the St. Antoine Hospital.\r\nWe are going to fetch him. Come with us.\" Gindrier got into the\r\n_fiacre_. The stranger, however, was an emissary of the Commissary of\r\nPolice of the Rue Ste. Marguerite St. Antoine. He had been charged by\r\nthe commissary of Police to go to Baudin's house, No, 88, Rue de Clichy,\r\nto inform the family. Having only found the women at home he had\r\nconfined himself to telling them that Representative Baudin was wounded.\r\nHe offered to accompany them, and went with them in the _fiacre_. They\r\nhad uttered the name of Gindrier before him. This might have been\r\nimprudent. They spoke to him; he declared that he would not betray the\r\nRepresentative, and it was settled that before the Commissary of Police\r\nGindrier should assume to be a relation, and be called Baudin.\r\n\r\nThe poor women still hoped. Perhaps the wound was serious, but Baudin\r\nwas young, and had a good constitution. \"They will save him,\" said they.\r\nGindrier was silent. At the office of the Commissary of Police the truth\r\nwas revealed.--\"How is he?\" asked Madame L---- on entering. \"Why?\" said\r\nthe Commissary, \"he is dead.\" \"What do you mean? Dead!\" \"Yes; killed on\r\nthe spot.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a painful moment. The despair of these two women who had been\r\nso abruptly struck to the heart burst forth in sobs. \"Ah, infamous\r\nBonaparte!\" cried Madame L----. \"He has killed Baudin. Well, then, I will\r\nkill him. I will be the Charlotte Corday of this Marat.\"\r\n\r\nGindrier claimed the body of Baudin. The Commissary of Police only\r\nconsented to restore it to the family on exacting a promise that they\r\nwould bury it at once, and without any ostentation, and that they would\r\nnot exhibit it to the people. \"You understand,\" he said, \"that the sight\r\nof a Representative killed and bleeding might raise Paris.\" The _coup\r\nd'état_ made corpses, but did not wish that they should be utilized.\r\n\r\nOn these conditions the Commissary of Police gave Gindrier two men and a\r\nsafe conduct to fetch the body of Baudin from the hospital where he had\r\nbeen carried.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Baudin's brother, a young man of four-and-twenty, a medical\r\nstudent, came up. This young man has since been arrested and imprisoned.\r\nHis crime is his brother. Let us continue. They proceeded to the\r\nhospital. At the sight of the safe conduct the director ushered Gindrier\r\nand young Baudin into the parlor. There were three pallets there covered\r\nwith white sheets, under which could be traced the motionless forms of\r\nthree human bodies. The one which occupied the centre bed was Baudin. On\r\nhis right lay the young soldier killed a minute before him by the side of\r\nSchoelcher, and on the left an old woman who had been struck down by a\r\nspent ball in the Rue de Cotte, and whom the executioners of the _coup\r\nd'état_ had gathered up later on; in the first moment one cannot find out\r\nall one's riches.\r\n\r\nThe three corpses were naked under their winding sheets.\r\n\r\nThey had left to Baudin alone his shirt and his flannel vest. They had\r\nfound on him seven francs, his gold watch and chain, his Representative's\r\nmedal, and a gold pencil-case which he had used in the Rue de Popincourt,\r\nafter having passed me the other pencil, which I still preserve. Gindrier\r\nand young Baudin, bare-headed, approached the centre bed. They raised the\r\nshroud, and Baudin's dead face became visible. He was calm, and seemed\r\nasleep. No feature appeared contracted. A livid tint began to mottle his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThey drew up an official report. It is customary. It is not sufficient\r\nto kill people. An official report must also be drawn up. Young Baudin\r\nhad to sign it, upon which, on the demand of the Commissary of Police,\r\nthey \"made over\" to him the body of his brother. During these\r\nsignatures, Gindrier in the courtyard of the hospital, attempted if not\r\nto console, at least to calm the two despairing women.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a man who had entered the courtyard, and who had attentively\r\nwatched him for some moments, came abruptly up to him,--\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that to you?\" said Gindrier.\r\n\r\n\"You have come to fetch Baudin's body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this your carriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get in at once, and pull down the blinds.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the Representative Gindrier. I know you. You were this morning\r\non the barricade. If any other than myself should see you, you are\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\nGindrier followed his advice and got into the _fiacre_. While getting in\r\nhe asked the man:\r\n\r\n\"Do you belong to the Police?\"\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer. A moment after he came and said in a low voice,\r\nnear the door of the _fiacre_ in which Gindrier was enclosed,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I eat the bread, but I do not do the work.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men sent by the Commissary of Police took Baudin on his wooden\r\nbed and carried him to the _fiacre_. They placed him at the bottom of\r\nthe _fiacre_ with his face covered, and enveloped from head to foot in a\r\nshroud. A workman who was there lent his cloak, which was thrown over\r\nthe corpse in order not to attract the notice of passers-by. Madame L----\r\ntook her place by the side of the body, Gindrier opposite, young Baudin\r\nnext to Gindrier. A _fiacre_ followed, in which were the other relative\r\nof Baudin and a medical student named Dutèche. They set off. During the\r\njourney the head of the corpse, shaken by the carriage, rolled from\r\nshoulder to shoulder; the blood began to flow from the wound and\r\nappeared in large red patches through the white sheet. Gindrier with\r\nhis arms stretched out and his hand placed on its breast, prevented it\r\nfrom falling forwards; Madame L---- held it up by the side.\r\n\r\nThey had told the coachman to drive slowly; the journey lasted more than\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached No. 88, Rue de Clichy, the bringing out of the body\r\nattracted a curious crowd before the door. The neighbors flocked\r\nthither. Baudin's brother, assisted by Gindrier and Dutèche, carried up\r\nthe corpse to the fourth floor, where Baudin resided. It was a new\r\nhouse, and he had only lived there a few months.\r\n\r\nThey carried him into his room, which was in order, and just as he had\r\nleft it on the morning of the 2d. The bed, on which he had not slept the\r\npreceding night, had not been disturbed. A book which he had been\r\nreading had remained on the table, open at the page where he had left\r\noff. They unrolled the shroud, and Gindrier cut off his shirt and his\r\nflannel vest with a pair of scissors. They washed the body. The ball had\r\nentered through the corner of the arch of the right eye, and had gone out\r\nat the back of the head. The wound of the eye had not bled. A sort of\r\nswelling had formed there; the blood had flowed copiously through the\r\nhole at the back of the head. They put clean linen on him, and clean\r\nsheets on the bed, and laid him down with his head on the pillow, and\r\nhis face uncovered. The women were weeping in the next room.\r\n\r\nGindrier had already rendered the same service to the ex-Constituent\r\nJames Demontry. In 1850 James Demontry died in exile at Cologne.\r\nGindrier started for Cologne, went to the cemetery, and had James\r\nDemontry exhumed. He had the heart extracted, embalmed it, and enclosed\r\nit in a silver vase, which he took to Paris. The party of the Mountain\r\ndelegated him, with Chollet and Joigneux, to convey this heart to Dijon,\r\nDemontry's native place, and to give him a solemn funeral. This funeral\r\nwas prohibited by an order of Louis Bonaparte, then President of the\r\nRepublic. The burial of brave and faithful men was unpleasing to Louis\r\nBonaparte--not so their death.\r\n\r\nWhen Baudin had been laid out on the bed, the women came in, and all\r\nthis family, seated round the corpse, wept. Gindrier, whom other duties\r\ncalled elsewhere, went downstairs with Dutèche. A crowd had formed\r\nbefore the door.\r\n\r\nA man in a blouse, with his hat on his head, mounted on a kerbstone, was\r\nspeechifying and glorifying the _coup d'état_. Universal Suffrage\r\nre-established, the Law of the 31st May abolished, the \"Twenty-five\r\nfrancs\" suppressed; Louis Bonaparte has done well, etc.--Gindrier,\r\nstanding on the threshold of the door, raised his voice: \"Citizens!\r\nabove lies Baudin, a Representative of the People, killed while\r\ndefending the People; Baudin the Representative of you all, mark that\r\nwell! You are before his house; he is there bleeding on his bed, and\r\nhere is a man who dares in this place to applaud his assassin! Citizens!\r\nshall I tell you the name of this man? He is called the Police! Shame\r\nand infamy to traitors and to cowards! Respect to the corpse of him who\r\nhas died for you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd pushing aside the crowd, Gindrier took the man who had\r\nbeen speaking by the collar, and knocking his hat on to the ground with\r\nthe back of his hand, he cried, \"Hats off!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECREES OF THE REPRESENTATIVES WHO REMAINED FREE\r\n\r\nThe text of the judgment which was believed to have been dawn up by the\r\nHigh Court of Justice had been brought to us by the ex-Constituent\r\nMartin (of Strasbourg), a lawyer at the Court of Cassation. At the same\r\ntime we learned what was happening in the Rue Aumaire. The battle was\r\nbeginning, it was important to sustain it, and to feed it; it was\r\nimportant ever to place the legal resistance by the side of the armed\r\nresistance. The members who had met together on the preceding day at the\r\nMairie of the Tenth Arrondissement had decreed the deposition of Louis\r\nBonaparte; but this decree, drawn up by a meeting almost exclusively\r\ncomposed of the unpopular members of the majority, might have no effect\r\non the masses; it was necessary that the Left should take it up, should\r\nadopt it, should imprint upon it a more energetic and more revolutionary\r\naccent, and also take possession of the judgment of the High Court,\r\nwhich was believed to be genuine, to lend assistance to this judgment,\r\nand put it into execution.\r\n\r\nIn our appeal to arms we had outlawed Louis Bonaparte. The decree of\r\ndeposition taken up and counter-signed by us added weight to this\r\noutlawry, and completed the revolutionary act by the legal act.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Resistance called together the Republican\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe apartments of M. Grévy, where we had been sitting, being too small,\r\nwe appointed for our meeting-place No. 10. Rue des Moulins, although\r\nwarned that the police had already made a raid upon this house. But we\r\nhad no choice; in time of Revolution prudence is impossible, and it is\r\nspeedily seen that it is useless. Confidence, always confidence; such is\r\nthe law of those grand actions which at times determine great events.\r\nThe perpetual improvisation of means, of policy, of expedients, of\r\nresources, nothing step by step, everything on the impulse of the moment,\r\nthe ground never sounded, all risks taken as a whole, the good with the\r\nbad, everything chanced on all sides at the same time, the hour, the\r\nplace, the opportunity, friends, family, liberty, fortune, life,--such\r\nis the revolutionary conflict.\r\n\r\nTowards three o'clock about sixty Representatives were meeting at No.\r\n10, Rue des Moulins, in the large drawing-room, out of which opened a\r\nlittle room where the Committee of Resistance was in session.\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy December day, and darkness seemed already to have almost\r\nset in. The publisher Hetzel, who might also be called the poet Hetzel,\r\nis of a noble mind and of great courage. He has, as is known, shown\r\nunusual political qualities as Secretary-General of the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs under Bastide; he came to offer himself to us, as the\r\nbrave and patriotic Hingray had already done in the morning. Hetzel knew\r\nthat we needed a printing-office above everything; we had not the\r\nfaculty of speech, and Louis Bonaparte spoke alone. Hetzel had found a\r\nprinter who had said to him, \"_Force me, put a pistol to my throat, and\r\nI will print whatever you wish_.\" It was only a question, therefore, of\r\ngetting a few friends together, of seizing this printing-office by main\r\nforce, of barricading it, and, if necessary, of sustaining a siege,\r\nwhile our Proclamations and our decrees were being printed. Hetzel\r\noffered this to us. One incident of his arrival at our meeting-place\r\ndeserves to be noted. As he drew near the doorway he saw in the twilight\r\nof this dreary December day a man standing motionless at a short\r\ndistance, and who seemed to be lying in wait. He went up to this man,\r\nand recognized M. Yon, the former Commissary of Police of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there?\" said Hetzel abruptly. \"Are you there to\r\narrest us? In that case, here is what I have got for you,\" and he took\r\nout two pistols from his pocket.\r\n\r\nM. Yon answered smiling,--\r\n\r\n\"I am in truth watching, not against you, but for you; I am guarding\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nM. Yon, aware of our meeting at Landrin's house and fearing that we\r\nshould be arrested, was, of his own accord, acting as police for us.\r\n\r\nHetzel had already revealed his scheme to Representative Labrousse, who\r\nwas to accompany him and give him the moral support of the Assembly in\r\nhis perilous expedition. A first rendezvous which had been agreed upon\r\nbetween them at the Café Cardinal having failed, Labrousse had left with\r\nthe owner of the _café_ for Hetzel a note couched in these terms:--\r\n\r\n\"Madame Elizabeth awaits M. Hetzel at No. 10, Rue des Moulins.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this note Hetzel had come.\r\n\r\nWe accepted Hetzel's offer, and it was agreed that at nightfall\r\nRepresentative Versigny, who performed the duties of Secretary to the\r\nCommittee, should take him our decrees, our Proclamation, such items of\r\nnews as may have reached us, and all that we should judge proper to\r\npublish. It was settled that Hetzel should await Versigny on the\r\npavement at the end of the Rue de Richelieu which runs alongside the\r\nCafé Cardinal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jules Favre, Michel de Bourges and myself had drawn up a final\r\ndecree, which was to combine the deposition voted by the Right with the\r\noutlawry voted by us. We came back into the large room to read it to the\r\nassembled Representatives, and for them to sign it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened, and Emile de Girardin appeared. We had\r\nnot seen him since the previous evening.\r\n\r\nEmile de Girardin--after dispersing from around him that mist which\r\nenvelopes every combatant in party warfare, and which at a distance\r\nchanges or obscures the appearance of a man--Emile de Girardin is an\r\nextraordinary thinker, an accurate writer, energetic, logical, skilful,\r\nhearty; a journalist in whom, as in all great journalists, can be seen\r\nthe statesman. We owe to Emile de Girardin this great work of progress,\r\nthe cheap Press. Emile de Girardin has this great gift, a clearheaded\r\nstubbornness. Emile de Girardin is a public watchman; his journal is his\r\nsentry-box; he waits, he watches, he spies out, he enlightens, he lies\r\nin wait, he cries \"Who goes there?\" at the slightest alarm, he fires\r\nvolleys with his pen. He is ready for every form of combat, a sentinel\r\nto-day, a General to-morrow. Like all earnest minds he understands, he\r\nsees, he recognizes, he handles, so to speak, the great and magnificent\r\nidentity embraced under these three words, \"Revolution, Progress,\r\nLiberty;\" he wishes for the Revolution, but above all through Progress;\r\nhe wishes for progress, but solely through Liberty. One can, and\r\naccording to our opinion sometimes rightly, differ from him as to the\r\nroad to be taken, as to the attitude to be assumed, and the position to\r\nbe maintained, but no one can deny his courage, which he has proved in\r\nevery form, nor reject his object, which is the moral and physical\r\namelioration of the lot of all. Emile de Girardin is more Democratic\r\nthan Republican, more Socialist than Democratic; on the day when these\r\nthree ideas, Democracy, Republicanism, Socialism, that is to say, the\r\nprinciple, the form, and the application, are balanced in his mind the\r\noscillations which still exist in him will cease. He has already Power,\r\nhe will have Stability.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this sitting, as we shall see, I did not always agree\r\nwith Emile de Girardin. All the more reason that I should record here\r\nhow greatly I appreciate the mind formed of light and of courage. Emile\r\nde Girardin, whatever his failings may be, is one of those men who do\r\nhonor to the Press of to-day; he unites in the highest degree the\r\ndexterity of the combatant with the serenity of the thinker.\r\n\r\nI went up to him, and I asked him,--\r\n\r\n\"Have you any workmen of the _Presse_ still remaining?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered me,--\r\n\r\n\"Our presses are under seal, and guarded by the _Gendarmerie Mobile_,\r\nbut I have five or six willing workmen, they can produce a few placards\r\nwith the brush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said I, \"print our decrees and our Proclamation.\" \"I will\r\nprint anything,\" answered he, \"as long as it is not an appeal to arms.\"\r\n\r\nHe added, addressing himself to me, \"I know your Proclamation. It is a\r\nwar-cry, I cannot print that.\"\r\n\r\nThey remonstrated at this. He then declared that he for his part made\r\nProclamations, but in a different sense from ours. That according to him\r\nLouis Bonaparte should not be combated by force of arms, but by creating\r\na vacuum. By an armed conflict he would be the conqueror, by a vacuum he\r\nwould be conquered. He urged us to aid him in isolating the \"deposed of\r\nthe Second December.\" \"Let us bring about a vacuum around him!\" cried\r\nEmile de Girardin, \"let us proclaim an universal strike. Let the merchant\r\ncease to sell, let the consumer cease from buying, let the workman cease\r\nfrom working, let the butcher cease from killing, let the baker cease\r\nfrom baking, let everything keep holiday, even to the National Printing\r\nOffice, so that Louis Bonaparte may not find a compositor to compose the\r\n_Moniteur_, not a pressman to machine it, not a bill-sticker to placard\r\nit! Isolation, solitude, a void space round this man! Let the nation\r\nwithdraw from him. Every power from which the nation withdraws falls like\r\na tree from which the roots are divided. Louis Bonaparte abandoned by all\r\nin his crime will vanish away. By simply folding our arms as we stand\r\naround him he will fall. On the other hand, fire on him and you will\r\nconsolidate him. The army is intoxicated, the people are dazed and do not\r\ninterfere, the middle classes are afraid of the President, of the people,\r\nof you, of every one! No victory is possible. You will go straight before\r\nyou, like brave men, you risk your heads, very good; you will carry with\r\nyou two or three thousand daring men, whose blood mingled with yours,\r\nalready flows. It is heroic, I grant you. It is not politic. As for me,\r\nI will not print an appeal to arms, and I reject the combat. Let us\r\norganize an universal strike.\"\r\n\r\nThis point of view was haughty and superb, but unfortunately I felt it\r\nto be unattainable. Two aspects of the truth seized Girardin, the\r\nlogical side and the practical side. Here, in my opinion, the practical\r\nside was wanting.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges answered him. Michel de Bourges with his sound logic\r\nand quick reasoning put his finger on what was for us the immediate\r\nquestion; the crime of Louis Bonaparte, the necessity to rise up erect\r\nbefore this crime. It was rather a conversation than a debate, but\r\nMichel de Bourges and Jules Favre, who spoke next, raised it to the\r\nhighest eloquence. Jules Favre, worthy to understand the powerful mind\r\nof Girardin would willingly have adopted this idea, if it had seemed\r\npracticable, of the universal strike, of the void around the man; he\r\nfound it great, but impossible. A nation does not pull up short. Even\r\nwhen struck to the heart, it still moves on. Social movement, which is\r\nthe animal life of society, survives all political movement. Whatever\r\nEmile de Girardin might hope, there would always be a butcher who would\r\nkill, a baker who would bake, men must eat! \"To make universal labor\r\nfold its arms is a chimera!\" said Jules Favre, \"a dream! The People\r\nfight for three days, for four days, for a week; society will not wait\r\nindefinitely.\" As to the situation, it was doubtless terrible, it was\r\ndoubtless tragical, and blood flowed, but who had brought about this\r\nsituation? Louis Bonaparte. For ourselves we would accept it, such as it\r\nwas, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nEmile de Girardin, steadfast, logical, absolute in his idea, persisted.\r\nSome might be shaken. Arguments, which were so abundant in this vigorous\r\nand inexhaustible mind, crowded upon him. As for me, I saw Duty before\r\nme like a torch.\r\n\r\nI interrupted him. I cried out, \"It is too late to deliberate what we\r\nare to do. We have not got to do it. It is done. The gauntlet of the\r\n_coup d'état_ is thrown down, the Left takes it up. The matter is as\r\nsimple as this. The outrage of the Second December is an infamous,\r\ninsolent, unprecedented defiance to Democracy, to Civilization, to\r\nLiberty, to the People, to France. I repeat that we have taken up this\r\ngauntlet, we are the Law, but the living Law which at need can arm\r\nitself and fight. A gun in our hands is a protest. I do not know whether\r\nwe shall conquer, but it is our duty to protest. To protest first in\r\nParliament; when Parliament is closed, to protest in the street; when\r\nthe street is closed, to protest in exile; when exile is fulfilled, to\r\nprotest in the tomb. Such is our part, our office, our mission. The\r\nauthority of the Representatives is elastic; the People bestow it,\r\nevents extend it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we were deliberating, our colleague, Napoleon Bonaparte, son\r\nof the ex-King of Westphalia, came in. He listened. He spoke. He\r\nenergetically blamed, in a tone of sincere and generous indignation, his\r\ncousin's crime, but he declared that in his opinion a written protest\r\nwould suffice. A protest of the Representatives, a protest of the\r\nCouncil of State, a protest of the Magistracy, a protest of the Press,\r\nthat this protest would be unanimous and would enlighten France, but\r\nthat no other form of resistance would obtain unanimity. That as for\r\nhimself, having always considered the Constitution worthless, having\r\ncontended against it from the first in the Constituent Assembly, he\r\nwould not defend it at the last, that he assuredly would not give one\r\ndrop of blood for it. That the Constitution was dead, but that the\r\nRepublic was living, and that we must save, not the Constitution, a\r\ncorpse, but the Republic, the principle!\r\n\r\nRemonstrances burst forth. Bancel, young, glowing, eloquent, impetuous,\r\noverflowing with self-confidence, cried out that we ought not to look at\r\nthe shortcomings of the Constitution, but at the enormity of the crime\r\nwhich had been committed, the flagrant treason, the violated oath; he\r\ndeclared that we might have voted against the Constitution in the\r\nConstituent Assembly, and yet defend it to-day in the presence of an\r\nusurper; that this was logical, and that many amongst us were in this\r\nposition. He cited me as an example. Victor Hugo, said he, is a proof of\r\nthis. He concluded thus: \"You have been present at the construction of a\r\nvessel, you have considered it badly built, you have given advice which\r\nhas not been listened to. Nevertheless, you have been obliged to embark\r\non board this vessel, your children and your brothers are there with\r\nyou, your mother is on board. A pirate ranges up, axe in one hand, to\r\nscuttle the vessel, a torch in the other to fire it. The crew are\r\nresolved to defend themselves and run to arms. Would you say to this\r\ncrew, 'For my part I consider this vessel badly built, and I will let it\r\nbe destroyed'?\"\r\n\r\n\"In such a case,\" added Edgar Quinet, \"whoever is not on the side of the\r\nvessel is on the side of the pirates.\"\r\n\r\nThey shouted on all sides, \"The decree! Read the decree!\"\r\n\r\nI was standing leaning against the fire place. Napoleon Bonaparte came\r\nup to me, and whispered in my ear,--\r\n\r\n\"You are undertaking,\" said he, \"a battle which is lost beforehand.\"\r\n\r\nI answered him, \"I do not look at success, I look at duty.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"You are a politician, consequently you ought to look\r\nforward to success. I repeat, before you go any further, that the battle\r\nis lost beforehand.\"\r\n\r\nI resumed, \"If we enter upon the conflict the battle is lost. You say\r\nso, I believe it; but if we do not enter upon it, honor is lost. I would\r\nrather lose the battle than honor.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a moment, then he took my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" continued he, \"but listen to me. You run, you yourself\r\npersonally, great dancer. Of all the men in the Assembly you are the one\r\nwhom the President hates the most. You have from the height of the\r\nTribune nicknamed him, 'Napoleon the Little.' You understand that will\r\nnever be forgotten. Besides, it was you who dictated the appeal to arms,\r\nand that is known. If you are taken, you are lost. You will be shot on\r\nthe spot, or at least transported. Have you a safe place where you can\r\nsleep to-night?\"\r\n\r\nI had not as yet thought of this. \"In truth, no,\" answered I.\r\n\r\nHe continued, \"Well, then, come to my house. There is perhaps only one\r\nhouse in Paris where you would be in safety. That is mine. They will not\r\ncome to look for you there. Come, day or night, at what hour you please,\r\nI will await you, and I will open the door to you myself. I live at No.\r\n5, Rue d'Alger.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him. It was a noble and cordial offer. I was touched by it. I\r\ndid not make use of it, but I have not forgotten it.\r\n\r\nThey cried out anew, \"Read the decree! Sit down! sit down!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a round table before the fire place; a lamp, pens,\r\nblotting-books, and paper were brought there; the members of the\r\nCommittee sat down at this table, the Representatives took their places\r\naround them on sofas, on arm-chairs, and on all the chairs which could\r\nbe found in the adjoining rooms. Some looked about for Napoleon\r\nBonaparte. He had withdrawn.\r\n\r\nA member requested that in the first place the meeting should declare\r\nitself to be the National Assembly, and constitute itself by immediately\r\nappointing a President and Secretaries. I remarked that there was no\r\nneed to declare ourselves the Assembly, that we were the Assembly by\r\nright as well as in fact, and the whole Assembly, our absent colleagues\r\nbeing detained by force; that the National Assembly, although mutilated\r\nby the _coup d'état_, ought to preserve its entity and remain constituted\r\nafterwards in the same manner as before; that to appoint another\r\nPresident and another staff of Secretaries would be to give Louis\r\nBonaparte an advantage over us, and to acknowledge in some manner the\r\nDissolution; that we ought to do nothing of the sort; that our decrees\r\nshould be published, not with the signature of a President, whoever he\r\nmight be, but with the signature of all the members of the Left who had\r\nnot been arrested, that they would thus carry with them full authority\r\nover the People, and full effect. They relinquished the idea of appointing\r\na President. Noël Parfait proposed that our decrees and our resolutions\r\nshould be drawn up, not with the formula: \"The National Assembly\r\ndecrees,\" etc.; but with the formula: \"The Representatives of the People\r\nremaining at liberty decree,\" etc. In this manner we should preserve all\r\nthe authority attached to the office of the Representatives of the People\r\nwithout associating the arrested Representatives with the responsibility\r\nof our actions. This formula had the additional advantage of separating\r\nus from the Right. The people knew that the only Representatives\r\nremaining free were the members of the Left. They adopted Noël Parfait's\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nI read aloud the decree of deposition. It was couched in these words:--\r\n\r\n  \"DECLARATION.\r\n\r\n  \"The Representatives of the people remaining at liberty, by virtue of\r\n  Article 68 of the Constitution, which runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Article 68.--Every measure by which the President of the Republic\r\n    dissolves the Assembly, prorogues it, or obstructs the exercise of\r\n    its authority, is a crime of High Treason.\r\n\r\n    \"'By this action alone the President is deposed from his office; the\r\n    citizens are bound to refuse him obedience; the executive power\r\n    passes by right to the National Assembly; the judges of the High\r\n    Court of Justice should meet together immediately under penalty of\r\n    treason, and convoke the juries in a place which they shall appoint\r\n    to proceed to the judgment of the President and his accomplices.'\r\n\r\n  \"Decree:--\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE I.--Louis Bonaparte is deposed from his office of President\r\n  of the Republic.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE II.--All citizens and public officials are bound to refuse\r\n  him obedience under penalty of complicity.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE III.--The judgment drawn up on December 2d by the High Court\r\n  of Justice, and which declares Louis Bonaparte attainted with the\r\n  Crime of High Treason, shall be published and executed. Consequently\r\n  the civil and military authorities are summoned under penalty of\r\n  Treason to lend their active assistance to the execution of the said\r\n  judgment.\r\n\r\n  \"Given at Paris, in permanent session, December 3d, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nThe decree having been read, and voted unanimously, we signed it, and\r\nthe Representatives crowded round the table to add their signatures to\r\nours. Sain remarked that this signing took time, that in addition we\r\nnumbered barely more than sixty, a large number of the members of the\r\nLeft being at work in the streets in insurrection. He asked if the\r\nCommittee, who had full powers from the whole of the Left, had any\r\nobjection to attach to the decree the names of all the Republican\r\nRepresentatives remaining at liberty, the absent as well as those\r\npresent. We answered that the decree signed by all would assuredly\r\nbetter answer its purpose. Besides, it was the counsel which I had\r\nalready given. Bancel had in his pocket on old number of the _Moniteur_\r\ncontaining the result of a division.\r\n\r\nThey cut out a list of the names of the members of the Left, the names\r\nof those who were arrested were erased, and the list was added to the\r\ndecree.[11]\r\n\r\nThe name of Emile de Girardin upon this list caught my eye. He was still\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"Do you sign this decree?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"Unhesitatingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case will you consent to print it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Having no longer any presses, as I have told you, I can only print it\r\nas a handbill, and with the brush. It takes a long time, but by eight\r\no'clock this evening you shall have five hundred copies.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued I, \"you persist in refusing to print the appeal to\r\narms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do persist.\"\r\n\r\nA second copy was made of the decree, which Emile de Girardin took away\r\nwith him. The deliberation was resumed. At each moment Representatives\r\ncame in and brought items of news: Amiens in insurrection--Rheims and\r\nRouen in motion, and marching on Paris--General Canrobert resisting the\r\n_coup d'état_--General Castellane hesitating--the Minister of the United\r\nStates demanding his passports. We placed little faith in these rumors,\r\nand facts proved that we were right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jules Favre had drawn up the following decree, which he\r\nproposed, and which was immediately adopted:--\r\n\r\n  \"DECREE.\r\n\r\n  \"FRENCH REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n  \"Liberty,--Equality,--Fraternity.\r\n\r\n  \"The undersigned Representatives remaining at liberty, assembled in\r\n  Permanent Session,--\r\n\r\n  \"Considering the arrest of the majority of our colleagues, and the\r\n  urgency of the moment:\r\n\r\n  \"Considering that for the accomplishment of his crime Louis Bonaparte\r\n  has not contented himself with multiplying the most formidable means of\r\n  destruction against the lives and property of the citizens of Paris,\r\n  that he has trampled under foot every law, that he has annihilated all\r\n  the guarantees of civilized nations:\r\n\r\n  \"Considering that these criminal madnesses only serve to augment the\r\n  violent denunciation of every conscience and to hasten the hour of\r\n  national vengeance, but that it is important to proclaim the Right:\r\n\r\n  \"Decree:\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE I.--The State of Siege is raised in all Departments where it\r\n  has been established, the ordinary laws resume their authority.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE II.--It is enjoined upon all military leaders under penalty\r\n  of Treason immediately to lay down the extraordinary powers which\r\n  have been conferred upon them.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE III.--Officials and agents of the public force are charged\r\n  under penalty of treason to put this present decree into execution.\r\n\r\n  \"Given in Permanent Session, 3d December, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nMadier de Montjau and De Flotte entered. They came from outside. They\r\nhad been in all the districts where the conflict was proceeding, they\r\nhad seen with their own eyes the hesitation of a part of the population\r\nin the presence of these words, \"The Law of the 31st May is abolished,\r\nUniversal Suffrage is re-established.\" The placards of Louis Bonaparte\r\nwere manifestly working mischief. It was necessary to oppose effort to\r\neffort, and to neglect nothing which could open the eyes of the people.\r\nI dictated the following Proclamation:-\r\n\r\n  \"PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n  \"People! you are being deceived.\r\n\r\n  \"Louis Bonaparte says that he has re-established you in your rights,\r\n  and that he restores to you Universal Suffrage.\r\n\r\n  \"Louis Bonaparte has lied.\r\n\r\n  \"Read his placards. He grants you--what infamous mockery!--the right\r\n  of conferring on him, on him _alone_, the Constituent power; that is\r\n  to say, the Supreme power, which belongs to you. He grants you the\r\n  right to appoint him Dictator _for ten years_. In other words, he\r\n  grants you the right of abdicating and of crowning him. A right which\r\n  even you do not possess, O People! for one generation cannot dispose\r\n  of the sovereignty of the generation which shall follow it.\r\n\r\n  \"Yes, he grants to you, Sovereign, the right of giving yourself a\r\n  master, and that master himself.\r\n\r\n  \"Hypocrisy and treason!\r\n\r\n  \"People! we unmask the hypocrite. It is for you to punish the traitor!\r\n\r\n  \"The Committee of Resistance:\r\n\r\n  \"Jules Favre, De Flotte, Carnot, Madier de Montjau, Mathieu (de la\r\n  Drôme), Michel de Bourges, Victor Hugo.\"\r\n\r\nBaudin had fallen heroically. It was necessary to let the People know of\r\nhis death, and to honor his memory. The decree below was voted on the\r\nproposition of Michel de Bourges:--\r\n\r\n  \"DECREE.\r\n\r\n  \"The Representatives of the People remaining at liberty considering\r\n  that the Representative Baudin has died on the barricade of the\r\n  Faubourg St. Antoine for the Republic and for the laws, and that he\r\n  has deserved well of his country, decree:\r\n\r\n  \"That the honors of the Panthéon are adjudged to Representative Baudin.\r\n\r\n  \"Given in Permanent Session, 3d December, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nAfter honor to the dead and the needs of the conflict it was\r\nnecessary in my opinion to enunciate immediately and dictatorially\r\nsome great popular benefit. I proposed the abolition of the _octroi_\r\nduties and of the duty on liquors. This objection was raised, \"No\r\ncaresses to the people! After victory, we will see. In the meantime\r\nlet them fight! If they do not fight, if they do not rise, if they do\r\nnot understand that it is for them, for their rights that we the\r\nRepresentatives, that we risk our heads at this moment--if they leave\r\nus alone at the breach, in the presence of the _coup d'état_--it is\r\nbecause they are not worthy of Liberty!\"\r\n\r\nBancel remarked that the abolition of the _octroi_ duties and the duty\r\non liquors were not caresses to the People, but succor to the poor, a\r\ngreat economical and reparatory measure, a satisfaction to the public\r\ndemand--a satisfaction which the Right had always obstinately refused,\r\nand that the Left, master of the situation, ought hasten to accord. They\r\nvoted, with the reservation that it should not be published until after\r\nvictory, the two decrees in one; in this form:--\r\n\r\n  \"DECREE.\r\n\r\n  \"The Representatives remaining at liberty decree:\r\n\r\n  \"The _Octroi_ Duties are abolished throughout the extent of the\r\n  territory of the Republic.\r\n\r\n  \"Given in permanent Session, 3d December, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nVersigny, with a copy of the Proclamations and of the Decree, left in\r\nsearch of Hetzel. Labrousse also left with the same object. They settled\r\nto meet at eight o'clock in the evening at the house of the former\r\nmember of the Provisional Government Marie, Rue Neuve des Petits Champs.\r\n\r\nAs the members of the Committee and the Representatives withdrew I was\r\ntold that some one had asked to speak to me. I went into a sort of\r\nlittle room attached to the large meeting-room, and I found there a man\r\nin a blouse, with an intelligent and sympathetic air. This man had a\r\nroll of paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Victor Hugo,\" said he to me, \"you have no printing office. Here\r\nare the means which will enable you to dispense with one.\"\r\n\r\nHe unfolded on the mantel-piece the roll which he had in his hand. It\r\nwas a species of blotting-book made of very thin blue paper, and which\r\nseemed to be slightly oiled. Between each leaf of blue paper there was a\r\nsheet of white paper. He took out of his pocket a sort of blunt bodkin,\r\nsaying, \"The first thing to hand will serve your purpose, a nail or a\r\nmatch,\" and he traced with his bodkin on the first leaf of the book the\r\nword \"Republic.\" Then turning over the leaves, he said, \"Look at this.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"Republic\" was reproduced upon the fifteen or twenty white\r\nleaves which the book contained.\r\n\r\nHe added, \"This paper is usually used to trace the designs of\r\nmanufactured fabrics. I thought that it might be useful at a moment like\r\nthis. I have at home a hundred books like this on which I can make a\r\nhundred copies of what you want--a Proclamation, for instance--in the\r\nsame space of time that it takes to write four or five. Write something,\r\nwhatever you may think useful at the present moment, and to-morrow\r\nmorning five hundred copies shall be posted throughout Paris.\"\r\n\r\nI had none of the documents with me which we had just drawn up. Versigny\r\nhad gone away with the copies. I took a sheet of paper, and, leaning on\r\nthe corner of the chimney-piece, I wrote the following Proclamation:--\r\n\r\n  \"TO THE ARMY.\r\n\r\n  \"Soldiers!\r\n\r\n  \"A man has just broken the Constitution. He tears up the oath which\r\n  he has sworn to the people; he suppresses the law, stifles Right,\r\n  stains Paris with blood, chokes France, betrays the Republic!\r\n\r\n  \"Soldiers, this man involves you in his crime.\r\n\r\n  \"There are two things holy; the flag which represents military honor\r\n  and the law which represents the National Right. Soldiers, the\r\n  greatest of outrages is the flag raised against the Law! Follow no\r\n  longer the wretched man who misleads you. Of such a crime French\r\n  soldiers should be the avengers, not the accomplices.\r\n\r\n  \"This man says he is named Bonaparte. He lies, for Bonaparte is a\r\n  word which means glory. This man says that he is named Napoléon. He\r\n  lies, for Napoléon is a word which means genius. As for him, he is\r\n  obscure and insignificant. Give this wretch up to the law. Soldiers,\r\n  he is a false Napoléon. A true Napoléon would once more give you a\r\n  Marengo; he will once more give you a Transnonain.\r\n\r\n  \"Look towards the true function of the French army; to protect the\r\n  country, to propagate the Revolution, to free the people, to sustain\r\n  the nationalities, to emancipate the Continent, to break chains\r\n  everywhere, to protect Right everywhere, this is your part amongst\r\n  the armies of Europe. You are worthy of great battle-fields.\r\n\r\n  \"Soldiers, the French Army is the advanced guard of humanity.\r\n\r\n  \"Become yourselves again, reflect; acknowledge your faults; rise up!\r\n  Think of your Generals arrested, taken by the collar by galley\r\n  sergeants and thrown handcuffed into robbers' cells! The malefactor,\r\n  who is at the Elysée, thinks that the Army of France is a band of\r\n  mercenaries; that if they are paid and intoxicated they will obey.\r\n  He sets you an infamous task, he causes you to strangle, in this\r\n  nineteenth century, and in Paris itself, Liberty, Progress, and\r\n  Civilization. He makes you--you, the children of France--destroy all\r\n  that France has so gloriously and laboriously built up during the\r\n  three centuries of light and in sixty years of Revolution! Soldiers!\r\n  you are the 'Grand Army!' respect the 'Grand Nation!'\r\n\r\n  \"We, citizens; we, Representatives of the People and of yourselves;\r\n  we, your friends, your brothers; we, who are Law and Right; we, who\r\n  rise up before you, holding out our arms to you, and whom you strike\r\n  blindly with your swords--do you know what drives us to despair? It\r\n  is not to see our blood which flows; it is to see your honor which\r\n  vanishes.\r\n\r\n  \"Soldiers! one step more in the outrage, one day more with Louis\r\n  Bonaparte, and you are lost before universal conscience. The men who\r\n  command you are outlaws. They are not generals--they are criminals.\r\n  The garb of the galley slave awaits them; see it already on their\r\n  shoulders. Soldiers! there is yet time--Stop! Come back to the\r\n  country! Come back to the Republic! If you continue, do you know\r\n  what History will say of you? It will say, They have trampled under\r\n  the feet of their horses and crushed beneath the wheels of their\r\n  cannon all the laws of their country; they, French soldiers, they\r\n  have dishonored the anniversary of Austerlitz, and by their fault,\r\n  by their crime, the name of Napoléon sprinkles as much shame to-day\r\n  upon France as in other times it has showered glory!\r\n\r\n  \"French soldiers! cease to render assistance to crime!\"\r\n\r\nMy colleagues of the Committee having left, I could not consult them--time\r\npressed--I signed:\r\n\r\n  \"For the Representatives of the People remaining at liberty, the\r\n  Representative member of the Committee of Resistance,\r\n\r\n  \"VICTOR HUGO.\"\r\n\r\nThe man in the blouse took away the Proclamation saying, \"You will see\r\nit again to-morrow morning.\" He kept his word. I found it the nest day\r\nplacarded in the Rue Rambuteau, at the corner of the Rue de l'Homme-Armé\r\nand the Chapelle-Saint-Denis. To those who were not in the secret of the\r\nprocess it seemed to be written by hand in blue ink.\r\n\r\nI thought of going home. When I reached the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne,\r\nopposite my door, it happened curiously and by some chance to be half\r\nopen. I pushed it, and entered. I crossed the courtyard, and went\r\nupstairs without meeting any one.\r\n\r\nMy wife and my daughter were in the drawing-room round the fire with\r\nMadame Paul Meurice. I entered noiselessly; they were conversing in a\r\nlow tone. They were talking of Pierre Dupont, the popular song-writer,\r\nwho had come to me to ask for arms. Isidore, who had been a soldier, had\r\nsome pistols by him, and had lent three to Pierre Dupont for the\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nSuddenly these ladies turned their heads and saw me close to them. My\r\ndaughter screamed. \"Oh, go away,\" cried my wife, throwing her arms round\r\nmy neck, \"you are lost if you remain here a moment. You will be arrested\r\nhere!\" Madame Paul Meurice added, \"They are looking for you. The police\r\nwere here a quarter of an hour ago.\" I could not succeed in reassuring\r\nthem. They gave me a packet of letters offering me places of refuge for\r\nthe night, some of them signed with names unknown to me. After some\r\nmoments, seeing them more and more frightened, I went away. My wife said\r\nto me, \"What you are doing, you are doing for justice. Go, continue!\" I\r\nembraced my wife and my daughter; five months have elapsed at the time\r\nwhen I am writing these lines. When I went into exile they remained near\r\nmy son Victor in prison; I have not seen them since that day.\r\n\r\nI left as I had entered. In the porter's lodge there were only two or\r\nthree little children seated round a lamp, laughing and looking at\r\npictures in a book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] This list, which belongs to History, having served as the base of\r\nthe proscription list, will be found complete in the sequel to this book\r\nto be published hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHBISHOP\r\n\r\nOn this gloomy and tragical day an idea struck one of the people.\r\n\r\nHe was a workman belonging to the honest but almost imperceptible\r\nminority of Catholic Democrats. The double exaltation of his mind,\r\nrevolutionary on one side, mystical on the other, caused him to be\r\nsomewhat distrusted by the people, even by his comrades and his friends.\r\nSufficiently devout to be called a Jesuit by the Socialists,\r\nsufficiently Republican to be called a Red by the Reactionists, he\r\nformed an exception in the workshops of the Faubourg. Now, what is\r\nneeded in these supreme crises to seize and govern the masses are men\r\nof exceptional genius, not men of exceptional opinion. There is no\r\nrevolutionary originality. In order to be something, in the time of\r\nregeneration and in the days of social combat, one must bathe fully in\r\nthose powerful homogeneous mediums which are called parties. Great\r\ncurrents of men follow great currents of ideas, and the true\r\nrevolutionary leader is he who knows how best to drive the former in\r\naccordance with the latter.\r\n\r\nNow the Gospel is in accordance with the Revolution, but Catholicism is\r\nnot. This is due to the fact that in the main the Papacy is not in\r\naccordance with the Gospel. One can easily understand a Christian\r\nRepublican, one cannot understand a Catholic Democrat. It is a\r\ncombination of two opposites. It is a mind in which the negative bars\r\nthe way to the affirmative. It is a neuter.\r\n\r\nNow in time revolution, whoever is neuter of is impotent. Nevertheless,\r\nduring the first hours of resistance against the _coup d'état_ the\r\ndemocratic Catholic workman, whose noble effort we are here relating,\r\nthrew himself so resolutely into the cause of Justice and of Truth, that\r\nin a few moments he transformed distrust into confidence, and was hailed\r\nby the people. He showed such gallantry at the rising of the barricade\r\nof the Rue Aumaire that with an unanimous voice they appointed him their\r\nleader. At the moment of the attack he defended it as he had built it,\r\nwith ardor. That was a sad but glorious battle-field; most of his\r\ncompanions were killed, and he escaped only by a miracle.\r\n\r\nHowever, he succeeded in returning home, saying to himself bitterly,\r\n\"All is lost.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed evident to him that the great masses of the people would not\r\nrise. Thenceforward it appeared impossible to conquer the _coup d'état_\r\nby a revolution; it could be only combated by legality. What had been\r\nthe risk at the beginning became the hope at the end, for he believed\r\nthe end to be fatal, and at hand. In his opinion it was necessary, as\r\nthe people were defaulters, to try now to arouse the middle classes. Let\r\none legion of National Guards go out in arms, and the Elysée was lost.\r\nFor this a decisive blow must be struck--the heart of the middle classes\r\nmust be reached--the \"bourgeois\" must be inspired by a grand spectacle\r\nwhich should not be a terrifying spectacle.\r\n\r\nIt was then that this thought came to this workman, \"Write to the\r\nArchbishop of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThe workman took a pen, and from his humble garret he wrote to the\r\nArchbishop of Paris an enthusiastic and earnest letter in which he, a\r\nman of the people and a believer, said this to his Bishop; we give the\r\nsubstance of his letter:--\r\n\r\n\"This is a solemn hour, Civil War sets by the ears the Army and People,\r\nblood is being shed. When blood flows the Bishop goes forth. M. Sibour\r\nshould follow in the path of M. Affre. The example is great, the\r\nopportunity is still greater.\r\n\r\n\"Let the Archbishop of Paris, followed by all his clergy, the Pontifical\r\ncross before him, his mitre on his head, go forth in procession through\r\nthe streets. Let him summon to him the National Assembly and the High\r\nCourt, the Legislators in their sashes, the Judges in their scarlet\r\nrobes; let him summon to him the citizens, let him summon to him the\r\nsoldiers, let him go straight to the Elysée. Let him raise his hand in\r\nthe name of Justice against the man who is violating the laws, and in\r\nthe name of Jesus against the man who is shedding blood. Simply with\r\nhis raised hand he will crush the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\n\"And he will place his statue by the side of M. Affre, and it will be\r\nsaid that twice two Archbishops of Paris have trampled Civil War beneath\r\ntheir feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Church is holy, but the Country is sacred. There are times when the\r\nChurch should succor the Country.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter being finished, he signed it with his workman's signature.\r\n\r\nBut now a difficulty arose; how should it be conveyed to its destination?\r\n\r\nTake it himself!\r\n\r\nBut would he, a mere workman in a blouse, be allowed to penetrate to the\r\nArchbishop!\r\n\r\nAnd then, in order to reach the Archiepiscopal Palace, he would have to\r\ncross those very quarters in insurrection, and where, perhaps, the\r\nresistance was still active. He would have to pass through streets\r\nobstructed by troops, he would be arrested and searched; his hands smelt\r\nof powder, he would be shot; and the letter would not reach its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he had almost despaired of a solution, the name of\r\nArnauld de l'Ariége came to his mind.\r\n\r\nArnauld de l'Ariége was a Representative after his own heart. Arnauld de\r\nl'Ariége was a noble character. He was a Catholic Democrat like the\r\nworkman. At the Assembly he raised aloft, but he bore nearly alone, that\r\nbanner so little followed which aspires to ally the Democracy with the\r\nChurch. Arnauld de l'Ariége, young, handsome, eloquent, enthusiastic,\r\ngentle, and firm, combined the attributes of the Tribune with the faith\r\nof the knight. His open nature, without wishing to detach itself from\r\nRome, worshipped Liberty. He had two principles, but he had not two\r\nfaces. On the whole the democratic spirit preponderated in him. He said\r\nto me one day, \"I give my hand to Victor Hugo. I do not give it to\r\nMontalembert.\"\r\n\r\nThe workman knew him. He had often written to him, and had sometimes\r\nseen him.\r\n\r\nArnauld de l'Ariége lived in a district which had remained almost free.\r\n\r\nThe workman went there without delay.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of us, as has been seen, Arnauld de l'Ariége had taken\r\npart in the conflict. Like most of the Representatives of the Left, he\r\nhad not returned home since the morning of the 2d. Nevertheless, on the\r\nsecond day, he thought of his young wife whom he had left without\r\nknowing if he should see her again, of his baby of six months old which\r\nshe was suckling, and which he had not kissed for so many hours, of that\r\nbeloved hearth, of which at certain moments one feels an absolute need\r\nto obtain a fleeting glimpse, he could no longer resist; arrest, Mazas,\r\nthe cell, the hulks, the firing party, all vanished, the idea of danger\r\nwas obliterated, he went home.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely at that moment that the workman arrived there.\r\n\r\nArnauld de l'Ariége received him, read his letter, and approved of it.\r\n\r\nArnauld de l'Ariége knew the Archbishop of Paris personally.\r\n\r\nM. Sibour, a Republican priest appointed Archbishop of Paris by General\r\nCavaignac, was the true chief of the Church dreamed of by the liberal\r\nCatholicism of Arnauld de l'Ariége. On behalf of the Archbishop, Arnauld\r\nde l'Ariége represented in the Assembly that Catholicism which M. de\r\nMontalembert perverted. The democratic Representative and the Republic\r\nArchbishop had at times frequent conferences, in which acted as\r\nintermediatory the Abbé Maret, an intelligent priest, a friend of the\r\npeople and of progress, Vicar-General of Paris, who has since been Bishop\r\n_in partibus_ of Surat. Some days previously Arnauld had seen the\r\nArchbishop, and had received his complaints of the encroachment of the\r\nClerical party upon the episcopal authority, and he even proposed shortly\r\nto interpellate the Ministry on this subject and to take the question\r\ninto the Tribune.\r\n\r\nArnauld added to the workman's letter a letter of introduction, signed\r\nby himself, and enclosed the two letters in the same envelope.\r\n\r\nBut here the same question arose.\r\n\r\nHow was the letter to be delivered?\r\n\r\nArnauld, for still weightier reasons than those of the workman, could\r\nnot take it himself.\r\n\r\nAnd time pressed!\r\n\r\nHis wife saw his difficulty and quietly said,--\r\n\r\n\"I will take charge of it.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Arnauld de l'Ariége, handsome and quite young, married scarcely\r\ntwo years, was the daughter of the Republican ex-Constituent Guichard,\r\nworthy daughter of such a father, and worthy wife of such a husband.\r\n\r\nThey were fighting in Paris; it was necessary to face the dangers of the\r\nstreets, to pass among musket-balls, to risk her life.\r\n\r\nArnauld de l'Ariége hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to do?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I will take this letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is danger.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes, and answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Did I make that objection to you when you left me the day before\r\nyesterday?\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her with tears in his eyes, and answered, \"Go.\"\r\n\r\nBut the police of the _coup d'état_ were suspicious, many women were\r\nsearched while going through the streets; this letter might be found on\r\nMadame Arnauld. Where could this letter be hidden?\r\n\r\n\"I will take my baby with me,\" said Madame Arnauld.\r\n\r\nShe undid the linen of her little girl, hid the letter there, and\r\nrefastened the swaddling band.\r\n\r\nWhen this was finished the father kissed his child on the forehead, and\r\nthe mother exclaimed laughingly,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the little Red! She is only six months' old, and she is already a\r\nconspirator!\"\r\n\r\nMadame Arnauld reached the Archbishop's Palace with some difficulty. Her\r\ncarriage was obliged to take a long round. Nevertheless she arrived\r\nthere. She asked for the Archbishop. A woman with a child in her arms\r\ncould not be a very terrible visitor, and she was allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nBut she lost herself in courtyards and staircases. She was seeking her\r\nway somewhat discouraged, when she met the Abbé Maret. She knew him. She\r\naddressed him. She told him the object of her expedition. The Abbé Maret\r\nread the workman's letter, and was seized with enthusiasm: \"This may\r\nsave all,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHe added, \"Follow me, madam, I will introduce you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Paris was in the room which adjoins his study. The\r\nAbbé Maret ushered Madame Arnauldé into the study, informed the\r\nArchbishop, and a moment later the Archbishop entered. Besides the Abbé\r\nMaret, the Abbé Deguerry, the Curé of the Madeleine, was with him.\r\n\r\nMadame Arnauld handed to M. Sibour the two letters of her husband and\r\nthe workman. The Archbishop read them, and remained thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"What answer am I to take back to my husband?\" asked Madame Arnauld.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" replied the Archbishop, \"it is too late. This should have been\r\ndone before the struggle began. Now, it would be only to risk the\r\nshedding of more blood than perhaps has yet been spilled.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Deguerry was silent. The Abbé Maret tried respectfully to turn\r\nthe mind of his Bishop towards the grand effort unsoiled by the workman.\r\nHe spoke eloquently. He laid great stress open this argument, that the\r\nappearance of the Archbishop would bring about a manifestation of the\r\nNational Guard, and that a manifestation of the National Guard would\r\ncompel the Elysée to draw back.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Archbishop, \"you hope for the impossible. The Elysée will\r\nnot draw back now. You believe that I should stop the bloodshed--not at\r\nall; I should cause it to flow, and that in torrents. The National Guard\r\nhas no longer any influence. If the legions appeared, the Elysée could\r\ncrush the legions by the regiments. And then, what is an Archbishop in\r\nthe presence of the Man of the _coup d'état_? Where is the oath? Where\r\nis the sworn faith? Where is the Respect for Right? A man does not turn\r\nback when he has made three steps in such a crime. No! No! Do not hope.\r\nThis man will do all. He has struck the Law in the hand of the\r\nRepresentatives. He will strike God in mine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he dismissed Madame Arnauld with the look of a man overwhelmed with\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nLet us do the duty of the Historian. Six weeks afterwards, in the Church\r\nof Notre Dame, some one was singing the _Te Deum_ in honor of the\r\ntreason of December--thus making God a partner in a crime.\r\n\r\nThis man was the Archbishop Sibour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT VALERIEN\r\n\r\nOf the two hundred and thirty Representatives prisoners at the barracks\r\nof the Quai d'Orsay fifty-three had been sent to Mount Valérien. They\r\nloaded them in four police vans. Some few remained who were packed in an\r\nomnibus. MM. Benoist d'Azy, Falloux, Piscatory, Vatimesail, were locked\r\nin the wheeled cells, as also Eugène Sue and Esquiros. The worthy M.\r\nGustave de Beaumont, a great upholder of the cellular system, rode in a\r\ncell vehicle. It is not an undesirable thing, as we have said, that the\r\nlegislator should taste of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Commandant of Mount Valérien appeared under the archway of the fort\r\nto receive the Representative prisoners.\r\n\r\nHe at first made some show of registering them in the jailer's book.\r\nGeneral Oudinot, under whom he had served, rebuked him severely,--\r\n\r\n\"Do you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, General.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, let that suffice. Ask no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tamisier. \"Ask more and salute. We are more than the Army;\r\nwe are France.\"\r\n\r\nThe commandant understood. From that moment he was hat in hand before\r\nthe generals, and bowed low before the Representatives.\r\n\r\nThey led them to the barracks of the fort and shut them up promiscuously\r\nin a dormitory, to which they added fresh beds, and which the soldiers\r\nhad just quitted. They spent their first night there. The beds touched\r\neach other. The sheets were dirty.\r\n\r\nNext morning, owing to a few words which had been heard outside, the\r\nrumor spread amongst them that the fifty-three were to be sorted, and\r\nthat the Republicans were to be placed by themselves. Shortly afterwards\r\nthe rumor was confirmed. Madame de Luynes gained admission to her\r\nhusband, and brought some items of news. It was asserted, amongst other\r\nthings, that the Keeper of the Seals of the _coup d'état_, the man who\r\nsigned himself Eugène Rouher, \"Minister of Justice,\" had said, \"Let them\r\nset the men of the Right at liberty, and send the men of the Left to the\r\ndungeon. If the populace stirs they will answer for everything. As a\r\nguarantee for the submission of the Faubourgs we shall have the head of\r\nthe Reds.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that M. Rouher uttered these words, in which there is\r\nso much audacity. At that moment M. Rouher did not possess any.\r\nAppointed Minister on the 2d December, he temporized, he exhibited a\r\nvague prudery, he did not venture to install himself in the Place\r\nVendôme. Was all that was being done quite correct? In certain minds the\r\ndoubt of success changes into scruples of conscience. To violate every\r\nlaw, to perjure oneself, to strangle Right, to assassinate the country,\r\nare all these proceedings wholly honest? While the deed is not\r\naccomplished they hesitate. When the deed has succeeded they throw\r\nthemselves upon it. Where there is victory there is no longer treason;\r\nnothing serves like success to cleanse and render acceptable that\r\nunknown thing which is called crime. During the first moments M. Rocher\r\nreserved himself. Later on he has been one of the most violent advisers\r\nof Louis Bonaparte. It is all very simple. His fear beforehand explains\r\nhis subsequent zeal.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that these threatening words had been spoken not by\r\nRouher, but by Persigny.\r\n\r\nM. de Luynes imparted to his colleagues what was in preparation, and\r\nwarned them that they would be asked for their names in order that the\r\nwhite sheep might be separated from the scarlet goats. A murmur which\r\nseemed to be unanimous arose. These generous manifestations did honor to\r\nthe Representatives of the Right.\r\n\r\n\"No! no! Let us name no one, let us not allow ourselves to be sorted,\"\r\nexclaimed M. Gustave de Beaumont.\r\n\r\nM. de Vatimesnil added, \"We have come in here all together, we ought to\r\ngo out all together.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless a few moments afterwards Antony Thouret was informed that a\r\nlist of names was being secretly prepared, and that the Royalist\r\nRepresentatives were invited to sign it. They attributed, doubtless\r\nwrongly, this unworthy resolution to the honorable M. de Falloux.\r\n\r\nAntony Thouret spoke somewhat warmly in the centre of the group, which\r\nwere muttering together in the dormitory.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"a list of names is being prepared. This would be\r\nan unworthy action. Yesterday at the Mairie of the Tenth Arrondissement\r\nyou said to us, 'There is no longer Left or Right; we are the Assembly.'\r\nYou believed in the victory of the People, and you sheltered yourself\r\nbehind us Republicans. Today you believe in the victory of the _coup\r\nd'état_, and you would again become Royalists, to deliver us up, us\r\nDemocrats! Truly excellent. Very well! Pray do so.\"\r\n\r\nA universal shout arose.\r\n\r\n\"No! No! No more Right or Left! All are the Assembly. The same lot for\r\nall!\"\r\n\r\nThe list which had been begun was seized and burnt.\r\n\r\n\"By decision of the Chamber,\" said M. de Vatimesnil, smiling. A\r\nLegitimist Representative added,--\r\n\r\n\"Of the Chamber? No, let us say of the Chambered.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments afterwards the Commissary of the fort appeared, and in\r\npolite phrases, which, however, savored somewhat of authority, invited\r\neach of the Representatives of the People to declare his name in order\r\nthat each might be allotted to his ultimate destination.\r\n\r\nA shout of indignation answered him.\r\n\r\n\"No one! No one will give his name,\" said General Oudinot.\r\n\r\nGustave de Beaumont added,--\r\n\r\n\"We all bear the same name: Representatives of the People.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissary saluted them and went away.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours he came back. He was accompanied this time by the Chief\r\nof the Ushers of the Assembly, a man named Duponceau, a species of\r\narrogant fellow with a red face and white hair, who on grand days\r\nstrutted at the foot of the Tribune with a silvered collar, a chain over\r\nhis stomach, and a sword between his legs.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary said to Duponceau,--\"Do your duty.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the Commissary meant, and what Duponceau understood by this word\r\n_duty_, was that the Usher should denounce the Legislators. Like the\r\nlackey who betrays his masters.\r\n\r\nIt was done in this manner.\r\n\r\nThis Duponceau dared to look in the faces of the Representatives by\r\nturn, and he named them one after the other to a policeman, who took\r\nnotes of them.\r\n\r\nThe Sieur Duponceau was sharply castigated while holding this review.\r\n\r\n\"M. Duponceau,\" said M. Vatimesnil to him, \"I always thought you an\r\nidiot, but I believed you to be an honest man.\"\r\n\r\nThe severest rebuke was administered by Antony Thouret. He looked Sieur\r\nDuponceau in the face, and said to him, \"You deserve to be named Dupin.\"\r\n\r\nThe Usher in truth was worthy of being the President, and the President\r\nwas worthy of being the Usher.\r\n\r\nThe flock having been counted, the classification having been made,\r\nthere were found to be thirteen goats: ten Representatives of the Left;\r\nEugène Sue, Esquires, Antony Thouret, Pascal Duprat, Chanay, Fayolle,\r\nPaulin Durrien, Benoit, Tamisier, Tailard Latérisse, and three members\r\nof the Right, who since the preceding day had suddenly become Red in the\r\neyes of the _coups d'état_; Oudinot, Piscatory, and Thuriot de la\r\nRosière.\r\n\r\nThey confined these separately, and they set at liberty one by one the\r\nforty who remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHTNING BEGINS TO FLASH AMONGST THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe evening wore a threatening aspect.\r\n\r\nGroups were formed on the Boulevards. As night advanced they grew larger\r\nand became mobs, which speedily mingled together, and only formed one\r\ncrowd. An enormous crowd, reinforced and agitated by tributary currents\r\nfrom the side-streets, jostling one against another, surging, stormy,\r\nand whence ascended an ominous hum. This hubbub resolved itself into one\r\nword, into one name which issued simultaneously from every mouth, and\r\nwhich expressed the whole of the situation: \"Soulouque!\"[12] Throughout\r\nthat long line from the Madeleine to the Bastille, the roadway nearly\r\neverywhere, except (was this on purpose?) at the Porte St. Denis and the\r\nPorte St. Martin, was occupied by the soldiers--infantry and cavalry,\r\nranged in battle-order, the artillery batteries being harnessed; on the\r\npavements on each side of this motionless and gloomy mass, bristling\r\nwith cannon, swords, and bayonets, flowed a torrent of angry people. On\r\nall sides public indignation prevailed. Such was the aspect of the\r\nBoulevards. At the Bastille there was a dead calm.\r\n\r\nAt the Porte St. Martin the crowd, hemmed together and uneasy, spoke in\r\nlow tones. Groups of workmen talked in whispers. The Society of the 10th\r\nDecember made some efforts there. Men in white blouses, a sort of\r\nuniform which the police assumed during those days, said, \"Let us leave\r\nthem alone; let the 'Twenty-five francs' settle it amongst themselves!\r\nThey deserted us in June, 1848; to-day let them get out of the\r\ndifficulty alone! It does not concern us!\" Other blouses, blue blouses,\r\nanswered them, \"We know what we have to do. This is only the beginning,\r\nwait and see.\"\r\n\r\nOthers told how the barricades of the Rue Aumaire were being rebuilt,\r\nhow a large number of persons had already been killed there, how they\r\nfired without any summons, how the soldiers were drunk, how at various\r\npoints in the district there were ambulances already crowded with killed\r\nand wounded. All this was said seriously, without loud speaking, without\r\ngesture, in a confidential tone. From time to time the crowd were silent\r\nand listened, and distant firing was heard.\r\n\r\nThe groups said, \"Now they are beginning to tear down the curtain.\"\r\n\r\nWe were holding Permanent Session at Marie's house in the Rue Croix des\r\nPetits Champs. Promises of co-operation poured in upon us from every\r\nside. Several of our colleagues, who had not been able to find us on the\r\nprevious day, had joined us, amongst others Emmanuel Arago, gallant son\r\nof an illustrious father; Farconnet and Roussel (de l'Yonne), and some\r\nParisian celebrities, amongst whom was the young and already well-known\r\ndefender of the _Avénement du Peuple_, M. Desmarets.\r\n\r\nTwo eloquent men, Jules Favre and Alexander Rey, seated at a large table\r\nnear the window of the small room, were drawing up a Proclamation to the\r\nNational Guard. In the large room Sain, seated in an arm-chair, his feet\r\non the dog-irons, drying his wet boots before a huge fire, said, with\r\nthat calm and courageous smile which he wore in the Tribune, \"Things are\r\nlooking badly for us, but well for the Republic. Martial law is\r\nproclaimed; it will be carried out with ferocity, above all against us.\r\nWe are laid in wait for, followed, tracked, there is little probability\r\nthat we shall escape. To-day, to-morrow, perhaps in ten minutes, there\r\nwill be a 'miniature massacre' of Representatives. We shall be taken\r\nhere or elsewhere, shot down on the spot or killed with bayonet thrusts.\r\nThey will parade our corpses, and we must hope that that will at length\r\nraise the people and overthrow Bonaparte. We are dead, but Bonaparte is\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock, as Emile de Girardin had promised, we received from\r\nthe printing office of the _Presse_ five hundred copies of the decree of\r\ndeposition and of outlawry endorsing the judgment of the High Court, and\r\nwith all our signatures attached. It was a placard twice as large as\r\none's hand, and printed on paper used for proofs. Noël Parfait brought us\r\nthe five hundred copies, still damp, between his waistcoat and his shirt.\r\nThirty Representatives divided the bills amongst them, and we sent them\r\non the Boulevards to distribute the Decree to the People.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this Decree falling in the midst of the crowd was\r\nmarvellous. Some _cafés_ had remained open, people eagerly snatched the\r\nbills, they pressed round the lighted shop windows, they crowded under\r\nthe street lamps. Some mounted on kerbstones or on tables, and read\r\naloud the Decree.--\"That is it! Bravo!\" cried the people. \"The\r\nsignatures!\" \"The signatures!\" they shouted. The signatures were read\r\nout, and at each popular name the crowd applauded. Charamaule, merry and\r\nindignant, wandered through the groups, distributing copies of the\r\nDecree; his great stature, his loud and bold words, the packet of\r\nhandbills which he raised, and waved above his head, caused all hands to\r\nbe stretched out towards him. \"Shout 'Down with Soulouque!'\" said he,\r\n\"and you shall have some.\" All this in the presence of the soldiers.\r\nEven a sergeant of the line, noticing Charamaule, stretched out his hand\r\nfor one of the bills which Charamaule was distributing. \"Sergeant,\" said\r\nCharamaule to him, \"cry, 'Down with Soulouque!'\" The sergeant hesitated\r\nfor a moment, and answered \"No.\" \"Well, then,\" replied Charamaule,\r\n\"Shout, 'Long live Soulouque.'\" This time the sergeant did not hesitate,\r\nhe raised his sword, and, amid bursts of laughter and of applause, he\r\nresolutely shouted, \"Long live Soulouque!\"\r\n\r\nThe reading of the Decree added a gloomy warmth to the popular anger.\r\nThey set to work on all sides to tear down the placards of the _coup\r\nd'état_. At the door of the Café des Variétés a young man cried out to\r\nthe officers, \"You are drunk!\" Some workmen on the Boulevard\r\nBonne-Nouvelle shook their fists at the soldiers and said, \"Fire, then,\r\nyou cowards, on unarmed men! If we had guns you would throw the butts of\r\nyour muskets in the air.\" Charges of cavalry began to be made in front\r\nof the Café Cardinal.\r\n\r\nAs there were no troops on the Boulevard St. Martin and the Boulevard du\r\nTemple, the crowd was more compact pact there than elsewhere. All the\r\nshops were shut there; the street lamps alone gave any light. Against\r\nthe gloss of the unlighted windows heads might be dimly seen peering\r\nout. Darkness produced silence; this multitude, as we have already said,\r\nwas hushed. There was only heard a confused whispering. Suddenly a\r\nlight, a noise, an uproar burst forth from the entrance of the Rue St.\r\nMartin. Every eye was turned in that direction; a profound upheaving\r\nagitated the crowd; they rushed forward, they pressed against the\r\nrailings of the high pavements which border the cutting between the\r\ntheatres of the Porte St. Martin and the Ambigu. A moving mass was seen,\r\nand an approaching light. Voices were singing. This formidable chorus\r\nwas recognized,\r\n\r\n    \"Aux armes, Citoyens; formez vos bataillons!\"\r\n\r\nLighted torches were coming, it was the \"Marseillaise,\" that other torch\r\nof Revolution and of warfare which was blazing.\r\n\r\nThe crowd made way for the mob which carried the torches, and which were\r\nsinging. The mob reached the St. Martin cutting, and entered it. It was\r\nthen seen what this mournful procession meant. The mob was composed of\r\ntwo distinct groups. The first carried on its shoulders a plank, on which\r\ncould be seen stretched an old man with a white beard, stark, the mouth\r\nopen, the eyes fixed, and with a hole in his forehead. The swinging\r\nmovement of the bearers shook the corpse, and the dead head rose and fell\r\nin a threatening and pathetic manner. One of the men who carried him,\r\npale, and wounded in the breast, placed his hand to his wound, leant\r\nagainst the feet of the old man, and at times himself appeared ready to\r\nfall. The other group bore a second litter, on which a young man was\r\nstretched, his countenance pale and his eyes closed, his shirt stained,\r\nopen over his breast, displaying his wounds. While bearing the two\r\nlitters the groups sang. They sang the \"Marseillaise,\" and at each chorus\r\nthey stopped and raised their torches, crying, \"To arms!\" Some young men\r\nwaved drawn swords. The torches shed a lurid light on the pallid\r\nforeheads of the corpses and on the livid faces of the crowd. A shudder\r\nran through the people. It appeared as though they again saw the terrible\r\nvision of February, 1848.\r\n\r\nThis gloomy procession came from the Rue Aumaire. About eight o'clock\r\nsome thirty workmen gathered together from the neighborhood of the\r\nmarkets, the same who on the next day raised the barricade of the\r\nGuérin-Boisseau, reached the Rue Aumaire by the Rue de Petit Lion, the\r\nRue Neuve-Bourg-l'Abbé, and the Carré St. Martin. They came to fight,\r\nbut here the combat was at an end. The infantry had withdrawn after\r\nhaving pulled down the barricades. Two corpses, an old man of seventy\r\nand a young man of five-and-twenty, lay at the corner of the street on\r\nthe ground, with uncovered faces, their bodies in a pool of blood, their\r\nheads on the pavement where they had fallen. Both were dressed in\r\novercoats, and seemed to belong to the middle class. The old man had his\r\nhat by his side; he was a venerable figure with a white beard, white\r\nhair, and a calm expression. A ball had pierced his skull.\r\n\r\nThe young man's breast was pierced with buck-shot. One was the father,\r\nthe other the son. The son, seeing his father fall, had said, \"I also\r\nwill die.\" Both were lying side by side.\r\n\r\nOpposite the gateway of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers there was\r\na house in course of building. They fetched two planks from it, they\r\nlaid the corpses on the planks, the crowd raised them upon their\r\nshoulders, they brought torches, and they began their march. In the Rue\r\nSt. Denis a man in a white blouse barred the way. \"Where are you going?\"\r\nsaid he to them. \"You will bring about disasters! You are helping the\r\n'Twenty-five francs!'\" \"Down with the police! Down with the white\r\nblouse!\" shouted the crowd. The man slunk away.\r\n\r\nThe mob swelled on its road; the crowd opened out and repeated the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" in chorus, but with the exception of a few swords no one\r\nwas armed. On the boulevard the emotion was intense. Women clasped their\r\nhands in pity. Workmen were heard to exclaim, \"And to think that we have\r\nno arms!\"\r\n\r\nThe procession, after having for some time followed the Boulevards,\r\nre-entered the streets, followed by a deeply-affected and angry\r\nmultitude. In this manner it reached the Rue de Gravilliers. Then a\r\nsquad of twenty _sergents de ville_ suddenly emerging from a narrow\r\nstreet rushed with drawn swords upon the men who were carrying the\r\nlitters, and overturned the corpses into the mud. A regiment of\r\nChasseurs came up at the double, and put an end to the conflict with\r\nbayonet thrusts. A hundred and two citizen prisoners were conducted to\r\nthe Prefecture. The two corpses received several sword-cuts in the\r\nconfusion, and were killed a second time. The brigadier Revial, who\r\ncommanded the squad of the _sergents de ville_, received the Cross of\r\nHonor for this deed of arms.\r\n\r\nAt Marie's we were on the point of being surrounded. We decided to leave\r\nthe Rue Croix des Petits Champs.\r\n\r\nAt the Elysée they commenced to tremble. The ex-Commandant Fleury, one\r\nof the aides-de-camp of the Presidency, was summoned into the little\r\nroom where M. Bonaparte had remained throughout the day. M. Bonaparte\r\nconferred a few moments alone with M. Fleury, then the aide-de-camp came\r\nout of the room, mounted his horse, and galloped off in the direction of\r\nMazas.\r\n\r\nAfter this the men of the _coup d'état_ met together in M. Bonaparte's\r\nroom, and held council. Matters were visibly going badly; it was\r\nprobable that the battle would end by assuming formidable proportions.\r\nUp to that time they had desired this, now they did not feel sure that\r\nthey did not fear it. They pushed forward towards it, but they\r\nmistrusted it. There were alarming symptoms in the steadfastness of the\r\nresistance, and others not less serious in the cowardice of adherents.\r\nNot one of the new Ministers appointed during the morning had taken\r\npossession of his Ministry--a significant timidity on the part of people\r\nordinarily so prompt to throw themselves upon such things. M. Roulier,\r\nin particular, had disappeared, no one knew where--a sign of tempest.\r\nPutting Louis Bonaparte on one side, the _coup d'état_ continued to rest\r\nsolely upon three names, Morny, St. Arnaud, and Maupas. St. Arnaud\r\nanswered for Magnan. Morny laughed and said in a whisper, \"But does\r\nMagnan answer for St. Arnaud?\" These men adopted energetic measures,\r\nthey sent for new regiments; an order to the garrisons to march upon\r\nParis was despatched in the one direction as far as Cherbourg, and on\r\nthe other as far as Maubeuge. These criminals, in the main deeply\r\nuneasy, sought to deceive each other. They assumed a cheerful\r\ncountenance; all spoke of victory; each in the background arranged for\r\nflight; in secret, and saying nothing, in order not to give the alarm to\r\nhis compromised colleagues, so as, in case of failure, to leave the\r\npeople some men to devour. For this little school of Machiavellian apes\r\nthe hopes of a successful escape lie in the abandonment of their\r\nfriends. During their flight they throw their accomplices behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] A popular nickname for Louis Bonaparte. Faustin Soulouque was the\r\nnegro Emperor of Hayti, who, when President of the Republic, had carried\r\nout a somewhat similar _coup d'état_ in 1848, being subsequently elected\r\nEmperor. He treated the Republicans with great cruelty, putting most of\r\nthem to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT FLEURY WENT TO DO AT MAZAS\r\n\r\nDuring the same night towards four o'clock the approaches of the\r\nNorthern Railway Station were silently invested by two regiments; one\r\nof Chasseurs de Vincennes, the other of _Gendarmerie Mobile_. Numerous\r\nsquads of _sergents de ville_ installed themselves in the terminus. The\r\nstation-master was ordered to prepare a special train and to have an\r\nengine ready. A certain number of stokers and engineers for night\r\nservice were retained. No explanation however was vouchsafed to any\r\none, and absolute secrecy was maintained. A little before six o'clock a\r\nmovement was apparent in the troops. Some _sergents de ville_ came\r\nrunning up, and a few minutes afterwards a squadron of Lancers emerged\r\nat a sharp trot from the Rue du Nord. In the centre of the squadron and\r\nbetween the two lines of horse-soldiers could be seen two police-vans\r\ndrawn by post-horses, behind each vehicle came a little open barouche,\r\nin which there sat one man. At the head of the Lancers galloped the\r\naide-de-camp Fleury.\r\n\r\nThe procession entered the courtyard, then the railway station, and the\r\ngates and doors were reclosed.\r\n\r\nThe two men in the barouches made themselves known to the Special\r\nCommissary of the station, to whom the aide-de-camp Fleury spoke\r\nprivately. This mysterious convoy excited the curiosity of the railway\r\nofficials; they questioned the policemen, but these knew nothing. All\r\nthat they could tell was that these police-vans contained eight places,\r\nthat in each van there were four prisoners, each occupying a cell, and\r\nthat the four other cells were filled by four _sergents de ville_\r\nplaced between the prisoners so as to prevent any communication between\r\nthe cells.\r\n\r\nAfter various consultations between the aide-de-camp of the Elysée and\r\nthe men of the Prefect Maupas, the two police-vans were placed on\r\nrailway trucks, each having behind it the open barouche like a wheeled\r\nsentry-box, where a police agent acted as sentinel. The engine was\r\nready, the trucks were attached to the tender, and the train started. It\r\nwas still pitch dark.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the train sped on in the most profound silence.\r\nMeanwhile it was freezing, in the second of the two police-vans, the\r\n_sergents de ville_, cramped and chilled, opened their cells, and in\r\norder to warm and stretch themselves walked up and down the narrow\r\ngangway which runs from end to end of the police-vans. Day had broken,\r\nthe four _sergents de ville_ inhaled the outside air and gazed at the\r\npassing country through a species of port-hole which borders each side\r\nof the ceiling of the passage. Suddenly a loud voice issued from one of\r\nthe cells which had remained closed, and cried out, \"Hey! there! it is\r\nvery cold, cannot I relight my cigar here?\"\r\n\r\nAnother voice immediately issued from a second cell, and said, \"What! it\r\nis you? Good-morning, Lamoricière!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Cavaignac!\" replied the first voice.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cavaignac and General Lamoricière had just recognized each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA third voice was raised from a third cell. \"Ah! you are there,\r\ngentlemen. Good-morning and a pleasant journey.\"\r\n\r\nHe who spoke then was General Changarnier.\r\n\r\n\"Generals?\" cried out a fourth voice. \"I am one of you!\"\r\n\r\nThe three generals recognized M. Baze. A burst of laughter came from the\r\nfour cells simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis police-van in truth contained, and was carrying away from Paris,\r\nthe Questor Baze, and the Generals Lamoricière, Cavaignac, and\r\nChangarnier. In the other vehicle, which was placed foremost on the\r\ntrucks, there were Colonel Charras, Generals Bedeau and Le Flô, and\r\nCount Roger (du Nord).\r\n\r\nAt midnight these eight Representative prisoners were sleeping in their\r\ncells at Mazas, when they heard a sudden knocking at their doors, and a\r\nvoice cried out to them, \"Dress, they are coming to fetch you.\" \"Is it to\r\nshoot us?\" cried Charras from the other side of the door. They did not\r\nanswer him. It is worth remarking that this idea came simultaneously to\r\nall. And in truth, if we can believe what has since transpired through\r\nthe quarrels of accomplices, it appears that in the event of a sudden\r\nattack being made by us upon Mazas to deliver them, a fusillade had been\r\nresolved upon, and that St. Arnaud had in his pocket the written order,\r\nsigned \"Louis Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners got up. Already on the preceding night a similar notice\r\nhad been given to them. They had passed the night on their feet, and at\r\nsix o'clock in the morning the jailer said to them, \"You can go to bed.\"\r\nThe hours passed by; they ended by thinking it would be the same as the\r\npreceding night, and many of them, hearing five o'clock strike from the\r\nclock tower inside the prison, were going to get back into bed, when the\r\ndoors of their cells were opened. All the eight were taken downstairs\r\none by one into the clerk's office in the Rotunda, and were then ushered\r\ninto the police-van without having met or seen each other during the\r\npassage. A man dressed in black, with an impertinent bearing, seated at\r\na table with pen in hand, stopped them on their way, and asked their\r\nnames. \"I am no more disposed to tell you my name than I am curious to\r\nlearn yours,\" answered General Lamoricière, and he passed outside.\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp Fleury, concealing his uniform under his hooded cloak,\r\nstationed himself in the clerk's office. He was charged, to use his own\r\nwords, to \"embark\" them, and to go and report their \"embarkation\" at the\r\nElysée. The aide-de-camp Fleury had passed nearly the whole of his\r\nmilitary career in Africa in General Lamoricière's division; and it was\r\nGeneral Lamoricière who in 1848, then being Minister of War, had\r\npromoted him to the rank of major. While passing through the clerk's\r\noffice, General Lamoricière looked fixedly at him.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the police-vans the generals were smoking cigars. They\r\ntook them from them. General Lamoricière had kept his. A voice from\r\noutside cried three separate times, \"Stop his smoking!\" A _sergent de\r\nville_ who was standing by the door of the cell hesitated for\r\nsome time, but however ended by saying to the general, \"Throw away your\r\ncigar.\"\r\n\r\nThence later on ensued the exclamation which caused General Cavaignac to\r\nrecognize General Lamoricière. The vehicles having been loaded they set\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThey did not know either with whom they were or where they were going.\r\nEach observed for himself in his box the turnings of the streets, and\r\ntried to speculate. Some believed that they were being taken to the\r\nNorthern Railway Station; others thought to the Havre Railway Station.\r\nThey heard the trot of the escort on the paving-stones.\r\n\r\nOn the railway the discomfort of the cells greatly increased. General\r\nLamoricière, encumbered with a parcel and a cloak, was still more jammed\r\nin than the others. He could not move, the cold seized him, and he ended\r\nby the exclamation which put all four of them in communication with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the names of the prisoners their keepers, who up to that time\r\nhad been rough, became respectful. \"I say there,\" said General\r\nChangarnier, \"open our cells, and let us walk up and down the passage\r\nlike yourselves.\" \"General,\" said a _sergent de ville_, \"we are forbidden\r\nto do so. The Commissary of Police is behind the carriage in a barouche,\r\nwhence he sees everything that is taking place here.\" Nevertheless, a\r\nfew moments afterwards, the keepers, under pretext of cold, pulled up\r\nthe ground-glass window which closed the vehicle on the side of the\r\nCommissary, and having thus \"blocked the police,\" as one of them\r\nremarked, they opened the cells of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nIt was with great delight that the four Representatives met again and\r\nshook hands. Each of these three generals at this demonstrative moment\r\nmaintained the character of his temperament. Lamoricière, impetuous and\r\nwitty, throwing himself with all his military energy upon \"the Bonaparte;\"\r\nCavaignac, calm and cold; Changarnier, silent and looking out through\r\nthe port-hole at the landscape. The _sergents de ville_ ventured to put\r\nin a word here and there. One of them related to the prisoners that the\r\nex-Prefect Carlier had spent the night of the First and Second at the\r\nPrefecture of Police. \"As for me,\" said he, \"I left the Prefecture at\r\nmidnight, but I saw him up to that hour, and I can affirm that at\r\nmidnight he was there still.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached Creil, and then Noyon. At Noyon they gave them some\r\nbreakfast, without letting them get out, a hurried morsel and a glass of\r\nwine. The Commissaries of Police did not open their lips to them. Then\r\nthe carriages were reclosed, and they felt they were being taken off the\r\ntrucks and being replaced on the wheels. Post horses arrived, and the\r\nvehicles set out, but slowly; they were now escorted by a company of\r\ninfantry _Gendarmerie Mobile_.\r\n\r\nWhen they left Noyon they had been ten hours in the police-van. Meanwhile\r\nthe infantry halted. They asked permission to get out for a moment \"We\r\nconsent,\" said one of the Commissaries of the Police, \"but only for a\r\nminute, and on condition that you will give your word of honor not to\r\nescape.\" \"We will give our word of honor,\" replied the prisoners.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" continued the Commissary, \"give it to me only for one\r\nminute, the time to drink a glass of water.\" \"No,\" said General\r\nLamoricière, \"but the time to do the contrary,\" and he added, \"To Louis\r\nBonaparte's health.\" They allowed them to get out, one by one, and they\r\nwere, able to inhale for a moment the fresh air in the open country by\r\nthe side of the road.\r\n\r\nThen the convoy resumed its march.\r\n\r\nAs the day waned they saw through their port-hole a mass of high walls,\r\nsomewhat overtopped by a great round tower. A moment afterwards the\r\ncarriages entered beneath a low archway, and then stopped in the centre\r\nof a long courtyard, steeply embanked, surrounded by high walls, and\r\ncommanded by two buildings, of which one had the appearance of a\r\nbarrack, and the other, with bars at all the windows, had the appearance\r\nof a prison. The doors of the carriages were opened. An officer who wore\r\na captain's epaulets was standing by the steps. General Changarnier came\r\ndown first. \"Where are we?\" said he. The officer answered, \"You are at\r\nHam.\"\r\n\r\nThis officer was the Commandant of the Fort. He had been appointed to\r\nthis post by General Cavaignac.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Noyon to Ham had lasted three hours and a half. They\r\nhad spent thirteen hours in the police van, of which ten were on the\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nThey led them separately into the\r\nprison, each to the room that was allotted to him. However, General\r\nLamoricière having been taken by mistake into Cavaignac's room, the two\r\ngenerals could again exchange a shake of the hand. General Lamoricière\r\nwished to write to his wife; the only letter which the Commissaries of\r\nPolice consented to take charge of was a note containing this line: \"I\r\nam well.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal building of the prison of Ham is composed of a story above\r\nthe ground floor. The ground floor is traversed by a dark and low\r\narchway, which leads from the principal courtyard into a back yard, and\r\ncontains three rooms separated by a passage; the first floor contains\r\nfive rooms. One of the three rooms on the ground floor is only a little\r\nante-room, almost uninhabitable; there they lodged M. Baze. In the\r\nremaining lower chambers they installed General Lamoricière and General\r\nChangarnier. The five other prisoners were distributed in the five rooms\r\nof the first floor.\r\n\r\nThe room allotted to General Lamoricière had been occupied in the time\r\nof the captivity of the Ministers of Charles X. by the ex-Minister of\r\nMarine, M. d'Haussez. It was a low, damp room, long uninhabited, and\r\nwhich had served as a chapel, adjoining the dreary archway which led\r\nfrom one courtyard to the other, floored with great planks slimy and\r\nmouldy, to which the foot adhered, papered with a gray paper which had\r\nturned green, and which hung in rags, exuding saltpetre from the floor\r\nto the ceiling, lighted by two barred windows looking on to the\r\ncourtyard, which had always to be left open on account of the smoky\r\nchimney. At the bottom of the room was the bed, and between the windows\r\na table and two straw-bottomed chairs. The damp ran down the walls. When\r\nGeneral Lamoricière left this room he carried away rheumatism with him;\r\nM. de Haussez went out crippled.\r\n\r\nWhen the eight prisoners had entered their rooms, the doors were shut\r\nupon them; they heard the bolts shot from outside, and they were told:\r\n\"You are in close confinement.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Cavaignac occupied on the first floor the former room of M. Louis\r\nBonaparte, the best in the prison. The first thing which struck the eye\r\nof the General was an inscription traced on the well, and stating the day\r\nwhen Louis Bonaparte had entered this fortress, and the day when he had\r\nleft it, as is well known, disguised as a mason, and with a plank on his\r\nshoulder. Moreover, the choice of this building was an attention on the\r\npart of M. Louis Bonaparte, who having in 1848 taken the place of General\r\nCavaignac in power; wished that in 1851 General Cavaignac should take his\r\nplace in prison.\r\n\r\n\"Turn and turn about!\" Morny had said, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were guarded by the 48th of the Line, who formed the\r\ngarrison at Ham. The old Bastilles are quite impartial. They obey those\r\nwho make _coups d'état_ until the day when they clutch them. What do\r\nthese words matter to them, Equity, Truth, Conscience, which moreover in\r\ncertain circles do not move men any more than stones? They are the cold\r\nand gloomy servants of the just and of the unjust. They take whatever is\r\ngiven them. All is good to them. Are they guilty? Good! Are they\r\ninnocent? Excellent! This man is the organizer of an ambush. To prison!\r\nThis man is the victim of an ambush! Enter him in the prison register!\r\nIn the same room. To the dungeon with all the vanquished!\r\n\r\nThese hideous Bastilles resemble that old human justice which possessed\r\nprecisely as much conscience as they have, which condemned Socrates and\r\nJesus, and which also takes and leaves, seizes and releases, absolves\r\nand condemns, liberates and incarcerates, opens and shuts, at the will\r\nof whatever hand manipulates the bolt from outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SECOND DAY\r\n\r\nWe left Marie's house just in time. The regiment charged to track us and\r\nto arrest us was approaching. We heard the measured steps of soldiers in\r\nthe gloom. The streets were dark. We dispersed. I will not speak of a\r\nrefuge which was refused to us.\r\n\r\nLess than ten minutes after our departure M. Marie's house was invested.\r\nA swarm of guns and swords poured in, and overran it from cellar to\r\nattic. \"Everywhere! everywhere!\" cried the chiefs. The soldiers sought\r\nus with considerable energy. Without taking the trouble to lean down and\r\nlook, they ransacked under the beds with bayonet thrusts. Sometimes they\r\nhad difficulty in withdrawing the bayonets which they had driven into the\r\nwall. Unfortunately for this zeal, we were not there.\r\n\r\nThis zeal came frown higher sources. The poor soldiers obeyed. \"Kill\r\nthe Representatives,\" such were their instructions. It was at that\r\nmoment when Morny sent this despatch to Maupas: \"If you take Victor\r\nHugo, do what you like with him.\" These were their politest phrases.\r\nLater on the _coup d'état_ in its decree of banishment, called us\r\n\"those individuals,\" which caused Schoelcher to say these haughty\r\nwords: \"These people do not even know how to exile politely.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Véron who publishes in his \"Mémoires\" the Morny-Maupas despatch,\r\nadds: \"M. du Maupas sent to look for Victor Hugo at the house of his\r\nbrother-in-law, M. Victor Foucher, Councillor to the Court of Cassation.\r\nHe did not find him.\"\r\n\r\nAn old friend, a man of heart and of talent, M. Henry d'E----, had\r\noffered me a refuge in rooms which he occupied in the Rue Richelieu;\r\nthese rooms adjoining the Théâtre Français, were on the first floor of a\r\nhouse which, like M. Grévy's residence, had an exit into the Rue\r\nFontaine Molière.\r\n\r\nI went there. M. Henry d'E---- being from home, his porter was awaiting\r\nme, and handed me the key.\r\n\r\nA candle lighted the room which I entered. There was a table near the\r\nfire, a blotting-book, and some paper. It was past midnight, and I was\r\nsomewhat tired; but before going to bed, foreseeing that if I should\r\nsurvive this adventure I should write its history, I resolved immediately\r\nto note down some details of the state of affairs in Paris at the end of\r\nthis day, the second of the _coup d'état_. I wrote this page, which I\r\nreproduce here, because it is a life-like portrayal--a sort of direct\r\nphotograph:--\r\n\r\n\"Louis Bonaparte has invented something which he calls a 'Consultative\r\nCommittee,' and which he commissions to draw up the postscript of his\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n\"Léon Foucher refuses to be in it; Montalember hesitates; Baroche\r\naccepts.\r\n\r\n\"Falloux despises Dupin.\r\n\r\n\"The first shots were fired at the Record Office. In the Markets in the\r\nRue Rambuteau, in the Rue Beaubourg I heard firing.\r\n\r\n\"Fleury, the aide-de-camp, ventured to pass down the Rue Montmartre. A\r\nmusket ball pierced his képi. He galloped quickly off. At one o'clock\r\nthe regiments were summoned to vote on the _coup d'état_. All gave their\r\nadhesion. The students of law and medicine assembled together at the\r\nEcole de Droit to protest. The Municipal Guards dispersed them. There\r\nwere a great many arrests. This evening, patrols are everywhere.\r\nSometimes an entire regiment forms a patrol.\r\n\r\n\"Representative Hespel, who is six feet high, was not able to find a\r\ncell long enough for him at Mazas, and he has been obliged to remain in\r\nthe porter's lodge, where he is carefully watched.\r\n\r\n\"Mesdames Odilon Barrot and de Tocqueville do not know where their\r\nhusbands are. They go from Mazas to Mont Valérien. The jailers are dumb.\r\nIt is the 19th Light Infantry which attacked the barricade when Baudin\r\nwas killed. Fifty men of the _Gendarmerie Mobile_ have carried at the\r\ndouble the barricade of the Oratoire in the Rue St. Honoré. Moreover, the\r\nconflict reveals itself. They sound the tocsin at the Chapelle Bréa. One\r\nbarricade overturned sets twenty barricades on their feet. There is the\r\nbarricade of the Schools in the Rue St. André des Arts, the barricade of\r\nthe Rue du Temple, the barricade of the Carrefour Phélippeaux defended by\r\ntwenty young men who have all been killed; they are reconstructing it;\r\nthe barricade of the Rue de Bretagne, which at this moment Courtigis is\r\nbombarding. There is the barricade of the Invalides, the barricade of the\r\nBarrière des Martyres, the barricade of the Chapelle St. Denis. The\r\ncouncils of war are sitting in permanence, and order all prisoners to be\r\nshot. The 30th of the Line have shot a woman. Oil upon fire.\r\n\r\n\"The colonel of the 49th of the Line has resigned. Louis Bonaparte has\r\nappointed in his place Lieutenant Colonel Négrier. M. Brun, Officer of\r\nthe Police of the Assembly, was arrested at the same time as the\r\nQuestors.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that fifty members of the majority have signed a protest at\r\nM. Odilon Barrot's house.\r\n\r\n\"This evening there is an increasing uneasiness at the Elysée.\r\nIncendiarism is feared. Two battalions of engineer-sappers have\r\nreinforced the Fire Brigade. Maupas has placed guards over the\r\ngasometers.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the military talons by which Paris has been grasped:--Bivouacs\r\nat all the strategical points. At the Pont Neuf and the Quai aux Fleurs,\r\nthe Municipal Guards; at the Place de la Bastille twelve pieces of\r\ncannon, three mortars, lighted matches; at the corner of the Faubourg the\r\nsix-storied houses are occupied by soldiers from top to bottom; the\r\nMarulaz brigade at the Hôtel de Ville; the Sauboul brigade at the\r\nPanthéon; the Courtigis brigade at the Faubourg St. Antoine; the Renaud\r\ndivision at the Faubourg St. Marceau. At the Legislative Palace the\r\nChasseurs de Vincennes, and a battalion of the 15th Light Infantry; in\r\nthe Champs Elysées infantry and cavalry; in the Avenue Marigny artillery.\r\nInside the circus is an entire regiment; it has bivouacked there all\r\nnight. A squadron of the Municipal Guard is bivouacking in the Place\r\nDauphine. A bivouac in the Council of State. A bivouac in the courtyard\r\nof the Tuileries. In addition, the garrisons of St. Germain and of\r\nCourbevoie. Two colonels killed, Loubeau, of the 75th, and Quilio. On all\r\nsides hospital attendants are passing, bearing litters. Ambulances are\r\neverywhere; in the Bazar de l'Industry (Boulevard Poissionière); in the\r\nSalle St. Jean at the Hôtel de Ville; in the Rue du Petit Carreau. In\r\nthis gloomy battle nine brigades are engaged. All have a battery of\r\nartillery; a squadron of cavalry maintains the communications between the\r\nbrigades; forty thousand men are taking part in the struggle; with a\r\nreserve of sixty thousand men; a hundred thousand soldiers upon Paris.\r\nSuch is the Army of the Crime. The Reibell brigade, the first and second\r\nLancers, protect the Elysée. The Ministers are all sleeping at the\r\nMinistry of the Interior, close by Morny. Morny watches, Magnan commands.\r\nTo-morrow will be a terrible day.\"\r\n\r\nThis page written, I went to bed, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD DAY--THE MASSACRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE WHO SLEEP AND HE WHO DOES NOT SLEEP\r\n\r\nDuring this night of the 3d and 4th of December, while we who were\r\novercome with fatigue and betrothed to calamity slept an honest slumber,\r\nnot an eye was closed at the Elysée. An infamous sleeplessness reigned\r\nthere. Towards two o'clock in the morning the Comte Roguet, after Morny\r\nthe most intimate of the confidants of the Elysée, an ex-peer of France\r\nand a lieutenant-general, came out of Louis Bonaparte's private room;\r\nRoguet was accompanied by Saint-Arnaud. Saint-Arnaud, it may be\r\nremembered, was at that time Minister of War.\r\n\r\nTwo colonels were waiting in the little ante-room.\r\n\r\nSaint-Arnaud was a general who had been a supernumerary at the Ambigu\r\nTheatre. He had made his first appearance as a comedian in the suburbs.\r\nA tragedian later on. He may be described as follows:--tall, bony, thin,\r\nangular, with gray moustaches, lank air, a mean countenance. He was a\r\ncut-throat, and badly educated. Morny laughed at him for his pronunciation\r\nof the \"Sovereign People.\" \"He pronounces the word no better than he\r\nunderstands the thing,\" said he. The Elysée, which prides itself upon its\r\nrefinement, only half-accepted Saint-Arnaud. His bloody side had caused\r\nhis vulgar side to be condoned. Saint-Arnaud was brave, violent, and yet\r\ntimid; he had the audacity of a gold-laced veteran and the awkwardness of\r\na man who had formerly been \"down upon his luck.\" We saw him one day in\r\nthe tribune, pale, stammering, but daring. He had a long bony face, and\r\na distrust-inspiring jaw. His theatrical name was Florivan. He was a\r\nstrolling player transformed into a trooper. He died Marshal of France.\r\nAn ill-omened figure.\r\n\r\nThe two colonels who awaited Saint-Arnaud in the anteroom were two\r\nbusiness-like men, both leaders of those decisive regiments which at\r\ncritical times carry the other regiments with them, according to their\r\ninstructions, into glory, as at Austerlitz, or into crime, as on the\r\nEighteenth Brumaire. These two officers belonged to what Morny called\r\n\"the cream of indebted and free-living colonels.\" We will not mention\r\ntheir names here; one is dead, the other is still living; he will\r\nrecognize himself. Besides, we have caught a glimpse of them in the\r\nfirst pages of this book.\r\n\r\nOne, a man of thirty-eight, was cunning, dauntless, ungrateful, three\r\nqualifications for success. The Duc d'Aumale had saved his life in the\r\nAurés. He was then a young captain. A ball had pierced his body; he fell\r\ninto a thicket; the Kabyles rushed up to cut off and carry away his\r\nhead, when the Duc d'Aumale arriving with two officers, a soldier, and a\r\nbugler, charged the Kabyles and saved this captain. Having saved him, he\r\nloved him. One was grateful, the other was not. The one who was grateful\r\nwas the deliverer. The Duc d'Aumale was pleased with this young captain\r\nfor having given him an opportunity for a deed of gallantry. He made\r\nhim a major; in 1849 this major became lieutenant-colonel, and commanded\r\na storming column at the siege of Rome; he then came back to Africa,\r\nwhere Fleury bought him over at the same time as Saint-Arnaud. Louis\r\nBonaparte made him colonel in July, 1851, and reckoned upon him. In\r\nNovember this colonel of Louis Bonaparte wrote to the Duc d'Aumale,\r\n\"Nothing need be apprehended from this miserable adventurer.\" In\r\nDecember he commanded one of the massacring regiments. Later on, in the\r\nDobrudscha, an ill-used horse turned upon him and bit off his cheek, so\r\nthat there was only room on his face for one slap.\r\n\r\nThe other man was growing gray, and was about forty-eight. He also was\r\na man of pleasure and of murder. Despicable as a citizen; brave as a\r\nsoldier. He was one of the first who had sprung into the breach at\r\nConstantine. Plenty of bravery and plenty of baseness. No chivalry but\r\nthat of the green cloth. Louis Bonaparte had made him colonel in 1851.\r\nHis debts had been twice paid by two Princes; the first time by the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, the second time by the Duc de Némours.\r\n\r\nSuch were these colonels.\r\n\r\nSaint-Arnaud spoke to them for some time in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was daylight we had assembled in the house of our\r\nimprisoned colleague, M. Grévy. We had been installed in his private\r\nroom. Michel de Bourges and myself were seated near the fireplace; Jules\r\nFavre and Carnot were writing, the one at a table near the window, the\r\nother at a high desk. The Left had invested us with discretionary\r\npowers. It became more and more impossible at every moment to meet\r\ntogether again in session. We drew up in its name and remitted to\r\nHingray, so that he might print it immediately, the following decree,\r\ncompiled on the spur of the moment by Jules Favre:--\r\n\r\n  \"FRENCH REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n  \"_Liberty, Equality, Fraternity_.\r\n\r\n  \"The undersigned Representatives of the People who still remain at\r\n  liberty, having met together in an Extraordinary Permanent Session,\r\n  considering the arrest of the majority of their colleagues, considering\r\n  the urgency of the moment;\r\n\r\n  \"Seeing that the crime of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte in violently\r\n  abolishing the operations of the Public Powers has reinstated the\r\n  Nation in the direct exercise of its sovereignty, and that all which\r\n  fetters that sovereignty at the present time should he annulled;\r\n\r\n  \"Seeing that all the prosecutions commenced, all the sentences\r\n  pronounced, by what right soever, on account of political crimes or\r\n  offences are quashed by the imprescriptible right of the People;\r\n\r\n  \"DECREE:\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE I. All prosecutions which have begun, and all sentences which\r\n  have been pronounced, for political crimes or offences are annulled as\r\n  regards all their civil or criminal effects.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE II. Consequently, all directors of jails or of houses of\r\n  detention are enjoined immediately to set at liberty all persons\r\n  detained in prison for the reasons above indicated.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE III. All magistrates' officers and officers of the judiciary\r\n  police are similarly enjoined, under penalty of treason, to annul all\r\n  the prosecutions which have been begun for the same causes.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE IV. The police functionaries and agents are charged with the\r\n  execution of the present decree.\r\n\r\n  \"Given at Paris, in Permanent Session, on the 4th December, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nJules Favre, as he passed me the decree for my signature, said to me,\r\nsmiling, \"Let us set your sons and your friends at liberty.\" \"Yes,\" said\r\nI, \"four combatants the more on the barricades.\" The Representative\r\nDuputz, a few hours later, received from our hands a duplicate of the\r\ndecree, with the charge to take it himself to the Concièrgerie as soon\r\nas the surprise which we premeditated upon the Prefecture of Police and\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville should have succeeded. Unhappily this surprise\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nLandrin came in. His duties in Paris in 1848 had enabled him to know the\r\nwhole body of the political and municipal police. He warned us that he\r\nhad seen suspicious figures roving about the neighborhood. We were in the\r\nRue Richelieu, almost opposite the Théâtre Français, one of the points\r\nwhere passers-by are most numerous, and in consequence one of the points\r\nmost carefully watched. The goings and comings of the Representatives\r\nwho were communicating with the Committee, and who came in and out\r\nunceasingly, would be inevitably noticed, and would bring about a visit\r\nfrom the Police. The porters and the neighbors already manifested an\r\nevil-boding surprise. We ran, so Landrin declared and assured us, the\r\ngreatest danger. \"You will be taken and shot,\" said he to us.\r\n\r\nHe entreated us to go elsewhere. M. Grévy's brother, consulted by us,\r\nstated that he could not answer for the people of his house.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done? Hunted now for two days, we had exhausted the\r\ngoodwill of nearly everybody, one refuge had been refused on the\r\npreceding evening, and at this moment no house was offered to us. Since\r\nthe night of the 2d we had changed our refuge seventeen times, at times\r\ngoing from one extremity of Paris to the other. We began to experience\r\nsome weariness. Besides, as I have already said, the house where we were\r\nhad this signal advantage--a back outlet upon the Rue Fontaine-Molière.\r\nWe decided to remain. Only we thought we ought to take precautionary\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nEvery species of devotion burst forth from the ranks of the Left around\r\nus. A noteworthy member of the Assembly--a man of rare mind and of rare\r\ncourage--Durand-Savoyat--who from the preceding evening until the last\r\nday constituted himself our doorkeeper, and even more than this, our\r\nusher and our attendant, himself had placed a bell on our table, and had\r\nsaid to us, \"When you want me, ring, and I will come in.\" Wherever we\r\nwent, there was he. He remained in the ante-chamber, calm, impassive,\r\nsilent, with his grave and noble countenance, his buttoned frock coat,\r\nand his broad-brimmed hat, which gave him the appearance of an Anglican\r\nclergyman. He himself opened the entrance door, scanned the faces of\r\nthose who came, and kept away the importunate and the useless. Besides,\r\nhe was always cheerful, and ready to say unceasingly, \"Things are\r\nlooking well.\" We were lost, yet he smiled. Optimism in Despair.\r\n\r\nWe called him in. Landrin set forth to him his misgivings. We begged\r\nDurand-Savoyat in future to allow no one to remain in the apartments,\r\nnot even the Representatives of the People, to take note of all news and\r\ninformation, and to allow no one to penetrate to us but men who were\r\nindispensable, in short, as far as possible, to send away every one in\r\norder that the goings and comings might cease. Durand-Savoyat nodded his\r\nhead, and went back into the ante-chamber, saying, \"It shall be done.\"\r\nHe confined himself of his own accord to these two formulas; for us,\r\n\"Things are looking well,\" for himself, \"It shall be done.\" \"It shall be\r\ndone,\" a noble manner in which to speak of duty.\r\n\r\nLandrin and Durand-Savoyat having left, Michel de Bourges began to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"The artifice of Louis Bonaparte, imitator of his uncle in this as in\r\neverything,\" said Michel de Bourges, \"had been to throw out in advance\r\nan appeal to the People, a vote to be taken, a plebiscitum, in short, to\r\ncreate a Government in appearance at the very moment when he overturned\r\none. In great crises, where everything totters and seems ready to fall,\r\na People has need to lay hold of something. Failing any other support,\r\nit will take the sovereignty of Louis Bonaparte. Well, it was necessary\r\nthat a support should be offered to the people, by us, in the form of\r\nits own sovereignty. The Assembly,\" continued Michel de Bourges, \"was,\r\nas a fact, dead. The Left, the popular stump of this hated Assembly,\r\nmight suffice for the situation for a few days. No more. It was\r\nnecessary that it should be reinvigorated by the national sovereignty.\r\nIt was therefore important that we also should appeal to universal\r\nsuffrage, should oppose vote to vote, should raise erect the Sovereign\r\nPeople before the usurping Prince, and should immediately convoke a new\r\nAssembly.\" Michel de Bourges proposed a decree.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges was right. Behind the victory of Louis Bonaparte could\r\nbe seen something hateful, but something which was familiar--the Empire;\r\nbehind the victory of the Left there was obscurity. We must bring in\r\ndaylight behind us. That which causes the greatest uneasiness to\r\npeople's imagination is the dictatorship of the Unknown. To convoke a\r\nnew Assembly as soon as possible, to restore France at once into the\r\nhands of France, this was to reassure people's minds during the combat,\r\nand to rally them afterwards; this was the true policy.\r\n\r\nFor some time, while listening to Michel de Bourges and Jules Favre, who\r\nsupported him, we fancied we heard, in the next room, a murmur which\r\nresembled the sound of voices. Jules Favre had several times exclaimed,\r\n\"Is any one there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not possible,\" was the answer. \"We have instructed Durand-Savoyat\r\nto allow no one to remain there.\" And the discussion continued.\r\nNevertheless the sound of voices insensibly increased, and ultimately\r\ngrew so distinct that it became necessary to see what it meant. Carnot\r\nhalf opened the door. The room and the ante-chamber adjoining the room\r\nwhere we were deliberating were filled with Representatives, who were\r\npeaceably conversing.\r\n\r\nSurprised, we called in Durand-Savoyat.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not understand us?\" asked Michel de Bourges.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly,\" answered Durand-Savoyat.\r\n\r\n\"This house is perhaps marked,\" resumed Carnot; \"we are in danger of\r\nbeing taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"And killed upon the spot,\" added Jules Favre, smiling with his calm\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so,\" answered Durand-Savoyat, with a look still quieter than\r\nJules Favre's smile. \"The door of this inner room is shrouded in the\r\ndarkness, and is little noticeable. I have detained all the\r\nRepresentatives who have come in, and have placed them in the larger\r\nroom and in the ante-chamber, whichever they have wished. A species of\r\ncrowd has thus been formed. If the police and the troops arrive, I shall\r\nsay to them, 'Here we are.' They will take us. They will not perceive\r\nthe door of the inner room, and they will not reach you. We shall pay\r\nfor you. If there is any one to be killed, they will content themselves\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without imagining that he had just uttered the words of a hero,\r\nDurand-Savoyat went back to the antechamber.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our deliberation on the subject of a decree. We were\r\nunanimously agreed upon the advantage of an immediate convocation of a\r\nNew Assembly. But for what date? Louis Bonaparte had appointed the 20th\r\nof December for his Plebiscitum; we chose the 21st. Then, what should we\r\ncall this Assembly? Michel de Bourges strongly advocated the title of\r\n\"National Convention,\" Jules Favre that its name should be \"Constituent\r\nAssembly,\" Carnot proposed the title of \"Sovereign Assembly,\" which,\r\nawakening no remembrances, would leave the field free to all hopes. The\r\nname of \"Sovereign Assembly\" was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe decree, the preamble of which Carnot insisted upon writing from my\r\ndictation, was drawn up in these terms. It is one of those which has\r\nbeen printed and placarded.\r\n\r\n  \"DECREE.\r\n\r\n  \"The crime of Louis Bonaparte imposes great duties upon the\r\n  Representatives of the People remaining at liberty.\r\n\r\n  \"Brute force seeks to render the fulfilment of these duties impossible.\r\n\r\n  \"Hunted, wandering from refuge to refuge, assassinated in the streets,\r\n  the Republican Representatives deliberate and act, notwithstanding the\r\n  infamous police of the _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\n  \"The outrage of Louis Napoleon, in overturning all the Public Powers,\r\n  has only left one authority standing,--the supreme authority,--the\r\n  authority of the people: Universal Suffrage.\r\n\r\n  \"It is the duty of the Sovereign People to recapture and reconstitute\r\n  all the social forces which to-day are dispersed.\r\n\r\n  \"Consequently, the Representatives of the People decree:--\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE I.--The People are convoked on the 21st December, 1851, for\r\n  the election of a Sovereign Assembly.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE II.--The election will take place by Universal Suffrage,\r\n  according to the formalities determined by the decree of the\r\n  Provisional Government of March 5, 1848.\r\n\r\n  \"Given at Paris, in Permanent Session, December 4, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nAs I finished signing this decree, Durand-Savoyat entered and whispered\r\nto me that a woman had asked for me, and was waiting in the ante-chamber.\r\nI went out to her. It was Madame Charassin. Her husband had disappeared.\r\nThe Representative Charassin, a political economist, an agriculturist, a\r\nman of science, was at the same time a man of great courage. We had seen\r\nhim on the preceding evening at the most perilous points. Had he been\r\narrested? Madame Charassin came to ask me if we knew where he was. I was\r\nignorant. She went to Mazas to make inquiries for him there. A colonel\r\nwho simultaneously commanded in the army and in the police, received her,\r\nand said, \"I can only permit you to see your husband on one condition.\"\r\n\"What is that?\" \"You will talk to him about nothing.\" \"What do you mean\r\nNothing?\" \"No news, no politics.\" \"Very well.\" \"Give me your word of\r\nhonor.\" And she had answered him, \"How is it that you wish me to give you\r\nmy word of honor, since I should decline to receive yours?\"\r\n\r\nI have since seen Charassin in exile.\r\n\r\nMadame Charassin had just left me when Théodore Bac arrived. He brought\r\nus the protest of the Council of State.\r\n\r\nHere it is:--\r\n\r\n  \"PROTEST OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE.\r\n\r\n  \"The undersigned members of the Council of State, elected by the\r\n  Constituent and Legislative Assemblies, having assembled together,\r\n  notwithstanding the decree of the 2d of December, at their usual place,\r\n  and having found it surrounded by an armed force, which prohibited their\r\n  access thereto, protest against the decree which has pronounced the\r\n  dissolution of the Council of State, and declare that they only ceased\r\n  their functions when hindered by force.\r\n\r\n  \"Paris, this 3d December, 1851.\r\n\r\n  \"Signed: BETHMONT, VIVIEN, BUREAU DE PUZY, ED. CHARTON, CUVIER, DE\r\n  RENNEVILLE, HORACE SAY, BOULATIGNIER, GAUTIER DE RUMILLY, DE JOUVENCEL,\r\n  DUNOYER, CARTERET, DE FRESNE, BOUCHENAY-LEFER, RIVET, BOUDET, CORMENIN,\r\n  PONS DE L'HERAULT.\"\r\n\r\nLet us relate the adventure of the Council of State.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte had driven away the Assembly by the Army, and the High\r\nCourt of Justice by the Police; he expelled the Council of State by the\r\nporter.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 2d of December, at the very hour at which the\r\nRepresentatives of the Right had gone from M. Daru's to the Mairie of\r\nthe Tenth Arrondissement, the Councillors of State betook themselves to\r\nthe Hotel on the Quai d'Orsay. They went in one by one.\r\n\r\nThe quay was thronged with soldiers. A regiment was bivouacking there\r\nwith their arms piled.\r\n\r\nThe Councillors of State soon numbered about thirty. They set to work to\r\ndeliberate. A draft protest was drawn up. At the moment when it was about\r\nto be signed the porter came in, pale and stammering. He declared that he\r\nwas executing his orders, and he enjoined them to withdraw.\r\n\r\nUpon this several Councillors of State declared that, indignant as they\r\nwere, they could not place their signatures beside the Republican\r\nsignatures.\r\n\r\nA means of obeying the porter.\r\n\r\nM. Bethmont, one of the Presidents of the Council of State, offered the\r\nuse of his house. He lived in the Rue Saint-Romain. The Republican\r\nmembers repaired there, and without discussion signed the protocol which\r\nhas been given above.\r\n\r\nSome members who lived in the more distant quarters had not been able to\r\ncome to the meeting. The youngest Councillor of State, a man of firm\r\nheart and of noble mind, M. Edouard Charton, undertook to take the\r\nprotest to his absent colleagues.\r\n\r\nHe did this, not without serious risk, on foot, not having been able to\r\nobtain a carriage, and he was arrested by the soldiery and threatened\r\nwith being searched, which would have been highly dangerous. Nevertheless\r\nhe succeeded in reaching some of the Councillors of State. Many signed,\r\nPons de l'Hérault resolutely, Cormenin with a sort of fever, Boudet after\r\nsome hesitation. M. Boudet trembled, his family were alarmed, they heard\r\nthrough the open window the discharge of artillery. Charton, brave and\r\ncalm, said to him, \"Your friends, Vivien, Rivet, and Stourm have signed.\"\r\nBoullet signed.\r\n\r\nMany refused, one alleging his great age, another the _res angusta domi_,\r\na third \"the fear of doing the work of the Reds.\" \"Say 'fear,' in short,\"\r\nreplied Charton.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, December 3d, MM. Vivien and Bethmont took the\r\nprotest to Boulay de la Meurthe, Vice-President of the Republic, and\r\nPresident of the Council of State, who received them in his dressing-gown,\r\nand exclaimed to them, \"Be off! Ruin yourselves, if you like, but without\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th, M. de Cormenin erased his signature, giving\r\nthis unprecedented but authentic excuse: \"The word _ex_-Councillor of\r\nState does not look well in a book; I am afraid of injuring my\r\npublisher.\"\r\n\r\nYet another characteristic detail. M. Béhic, on the morning of the 2d,\r\nhad arrived while they were drawing up the protest. He had half opened\r\nthe door. Near the door was standing M. Gautier de Rumilly, one of the\r\nmost justly respected members of the Council of State. M. Béhic had\r\nasked M. Gautier de Rumilly, \"What are they doing? It is a crime. What\r\nare we doing?\" M. Gautier de Rumilly had answered, \"A protest.\" Upon,\r\nthis word M. Béhic had reclosed the door, and had disappeared. He\r\nreappeared later on under the Empire--a Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSIDE THE ELYSEE\r\n\r\nDuring the morning Dr. Yvan met Dr. Conneau. They were acquainted. They\r\ntalked together. Yvan belonged to the Left. Conneau belonged to the\r\nElysée. Yvan knew through Conneau the details of what had taken place\r\nduring the night at the Elysée, which he transmitted to us.\r\n\r\nOne of these details was the following:--\r\n\r\nAn inexorable decree had been compiled, and was about to be placarded.\r\nThis decree enjoined upon all submission to the _coup d'état_.\r\nSaint-Arnaud, who, as Minister of War, should sign the decree, had drawn\r\nit up. He had reached the last paragraph, which ran thus: \"Whoever shall\r\nbe detected constructing a barricade, posting a placard of the\r\nex-Representatives, or reading it, shall be....\" here Saint-Arnaud had\r\npaused; Morny had shrugged his shoulders, had snatched the pen from his\r\nhand, and written \"_shot_!\"\r\n\r\nOther matters had been decided, but these were not recorded.\r\n\r\nVarious pieces of information came in in addition to these.\r\n\r\nA National Guard, named Boillay de Dole, had formed one of the Guard at\r\nthe Elysée, on the night of the 3d and 4th. The windows of Louis\r\nBonaparte's private room, which was on the ground floor, were lighted up\r\nthroughout the night. In the adjoining room there was a Council of War.\r\nFrom the sentry-box where he was stationed Boillay saw defined on the\r\nwindows black profiles and gesticulating shadows, which were\r\nMagnan, Saint-Arnaud, Persigny, Fleury,--the spectres of the crime.\r\n\r\nKorte, the General of the Cuirassiers, had been summoned, as also\r\nCarrelet, who commanded the division which did the hardest work on the\r\nfollowing day, the 4th. From midnight to three o'clock in the morning\r\nGenerals and Colonels \"did nothing but come and go.\" Even mere captains\r\nhad come there. Towards four o'clock some carriages arrived \"with\r\nwomen.\" Treason and debauchery went hand in hand. The boudoir in the\r\npalace answered to the brothel in the barracks.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard was filled with lancers, who held the horses of the\r\ngenerals who were deliberating.\r\n\r\nTwo of the women who came that night belong in a certain measure to\r\nHistory. There are always feminine shadows of this sort in the\r\nbackground. These women influenced the unhappy generals. Both belonged\r\nto the best circles. The one was the Marquise of ----, she who became\r\nenamored of her husband after having deceived him. She discovered that\r\nher lover was not worth her husband. Such a thing does happen. She was\r\nthe daughter of the most whimsical Marshal of France, and of that pretty\r\nCountess of ---- to whom M. de Chateaubriand, after a night of love,\r\ncomposed this quatrain, which may now be published--all the personages\r\nbeing dead.\r\n\r\n    The Dawn peeps in at the window, she paints the sky with red;\r\n    And over our loving embraces her rosy rays are shed:\r\n    She looks on the slumbering world, love, with eyes that seem divine.\r\n    But can she show on her lips, love, a smile as sweet as thine?[13]\r\n\r\nThe smile of the daughter was as sweet as that of the mother, and more\r\nfatal. The other was Madame K----, a Russian, fair, tall, blonde,\r\nlighthearted, involved in the hidden paths of diplomacy, possessing and\r\ndisplaying a casket full of love letters from Count Molé somewhat of a\r\nspy, absolutely charming and terrifying.\r\n\r\nThe precautions which had been taken in case of accident were visible\r\neven from outside. Since the preceding evening there had been seen from\r\nthe windows of the neighboring houses two post-chaises in the courtyard\r\nof the Elysée, horsed, ready to start, the postilions in their saddles.\r\n\r\nIn the stables of the Elysée in the Rue Montaigne there were other\r\ncarriages horsed, and horses saddled and bridled.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte had not slept. During the night he had given mysterious\r\norders; thence when morning came there was on this pale face a sort of\r\nappalling serenity.\r\n\r\nThe Crime grown calm was a disquieting symptom.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning he had almost laughed. Morny had come into his private\r\nroom. Louis Bonaparte, having been feverish, had called in Conneau, who\r\njoined in the conversation. People are believed to be trustworthy,\r\nnevertheless they listen.\r\n\r\nMorny brought the police reports. Twelve workmen of the National Printing\r\nOffice had, during the night of the Second, refused to print the decrees\r\nand the proclamations. They had been immediately arrested. Colonel\r\nForestier was arrested. They had transferred him to the Fort of Bicêtre,\r\ntogether with Crocé Spinelli, Genillier, Hippolyte Magen, a talented and\r\ncourageous writer, Goudounèche, a schoolmaster, and Polino. This last\r\nname had struck Louis Bonaparte. \"Who is this Polino?\" Morny had\r\nanswered, \"An ex-officer of the Shah of Persia's service.\" And he had\r\nadded, \"A mixture of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.\" These prisoners had\r\nbeen placed in Number Six Casemate. Further questions on the part of\r\nLouis Bonaparte, \"What are these casemates?\" And Morny had answered,\r\n\"Cellars without air or daylight, twenty-four mètres long, eight wide,\r\nfive high, dripping walls, damp pavements.\" Louis Bonaparte had asked,\r\n\"Do they give them a truss of straw?\" And Morny had said, \"Not yet, we\r\nshall see by and by.\" He had added, \"Those who are to be transported are\r\nat Bicêtre, those who are to be shot are at Ivry.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte had inquired, \"What precautions had been taken?\" Morny\r\ngave him full particulars; that guards had been placed in all the\r\nsteeples; that all printing-presses had been placed under seal; that\r\nall the drums of the National Guard had been locked up; that there\r\nwas therefore no fear either of a proclamation emanating from a\r\nprinting-office, or of a call to arms issuing from a Mairie, or of\r\nthe tocsin ringing from a steeple.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte had asked whether all the batteries contained their full\r\ncomplements, as each battery should be composed of four pieces and two\r\nmortars. He had expressly ordered that only pieces of eight, and mortars\r\nof sixteen centimètres in diameter should be employed.\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" Morny, who was in the secret, had said, \"all this apparatus\r\nwill have work to do.\"\r\n\r\nThen Morny had spoken of Mazas, that there were 600 men of the\r\nRepublican Guards in the courtyard, all picked men, and who when\r\nattacked would defend themselves to the bitter end; that the soldiers\r\nreceived the arrested Representatives with shouts of laughter, and that\r\nthey had gone so far as to stare Thiers in the face; that the officers\r\nkept the soldiers at a distance, but with discretion and with a \"species\r\nof respect;\" that three prisoners were kept in solitary confinement,\r\nGreppo, Nadaud, and a member of the Socialist Committee, Arsène Meunier.\r\nThis last named occupied No. 32 of the Sixth Division. Adjoining, in No.\r\n30, there was a Representative of the Right, who sobbed and cried\r\nunceasingly. This made Arsène Meunier laugh, and this made Louis\r\nBonaparte laugh.\r\n\r\nAnother detail. When the _fiacre_ bringing M. Baze was entering the\r\ncourtyard of Mazas, it had struck against the gate, and the lamp of the\r\n_fiacre_ had fallen to the ground and been broken to pieces. The\r\ncoachman, dismayed at the damage, bewailed it. \"Who will pay for this?\"\r\nexclaimed he. One of the police agents, who was in the carriage with the\r\narrested Questor, had said to the driver, \"Don't be uneasy, speak to the\r\nBrigadier. In matters such as this, _where there is a breakage_, it is\r\nthe Government which pays.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Bonaparte had smiled, and muttered under his moustache, \"That is\r\nonly fair.\"\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote from Morny also amused him. This was Cavaignac's anger\r\non entering his cell at Mazas. There is an aperture at the door of each\r\ncell, called the \"spy-hole,\" through which the prisoners are played the\r\nspy upon unknown to themselves. The jailers had watched Cavaignac. He had\r\nbegun by pacing up and down with folded arms, and then the space being\r\ntoo confined, he had seated himself on the stool in his cell. These\r\nstools are narrow pieces of plank upon three converging legs, which\r\npierce the seat in the centre, and project beyond the plank, so that one\r\nis uncomfortably seated. Cavaignac had stood up, and with a violent kick\r\nhad sent the stool to the other end of the cell. Then, furious and\r\nswearing, he had broken with a blow of his fist the little table of five\r\ninches by twelve, which, with the stool, formed the sole furniture of the\r\ndungeon.\r\n\r\nThis kick and fisticuff amused Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n\"And Maupas is as frightened as ever,\" said Morny. This made Bonaparte\r\nlaugh still further.\r\n\r\nMorny having given in his report, went away. Louis Bonaparte entered an\r\nadjoining room; a woman awaited him there. It appears that she came to\r\nentreat mercy for some one. Dr. Conneau heard these expressive words:\r\n\"Madam, I wink at your loves; do you wink at my hatreds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] The above is a free rendering of the original, which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Des rayons du matin l'horizon se colore,\r\n    Le jour vient éclairer notre tendre entretien,\r\n    Mais est-il un sourire aux lèvres de l'aurore.\r\n                       Aussi doux que le tien?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONAPARTE'S FAMILIAR SPIRITS\r\n\r\nM. Mérimée was vile by nature, he must not be blamed for it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to M. de Morny it is otherwise, he was more worthy; there was\r\nsomething of the brigand in him.\r\n\r\nM. de Morny was courageous. Brigandage has its sentiments of honor.\r\n\r\nM. Mérimée has wrongly given himself out as one of the confederates of\r\nthe _coup d'état_. He had, however, nothing to boast of in this.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that M. Mérimée was in no way a confidant. Louis Bonaparte\r\nmade no useless confidences.\r\n\r\nLet us add that it is little probable, notwithstanding some slight\r\nevidence to the contrary, that M. Mérimée, at the date of the 2d\r\nDecember, had any direct relations with Louis Bonaparte. This ensued\r\nlater on. At first Mérimée only knew Morny.\r\n\r\nMorny and Mérimée were both intimate at the Elysée, but on a different\r\nfooting. Morny can be believed, but not Mérimée. Morny was in the great\r\nsecrets, Mérimée in the small ones. Commissions of gallantry formed his\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\nThe familiars of the Elysée were of two kinds, the trustworthy\r\nconfederates and the courtiers.\r\n\r\nThe first of the trustworthy confederates was Morny; the first--or the\r\nlast--of the courtiers was Mérimée.\r\n\r\nThis is what made the fortune of M. Mérimée.\r\n\r\nCrimes are only glorious during the first moment; they fade quickly. This\r\nkind of success lacks permanency; it is necessary promptly to supplement\r\nit with something else.\r\n\r\nAt the Elysée a literary ornament was wanted. A little savor of the\r\nAcademy is not out of place in a brigand's cavern. M. Mérimée was\r\navailable. It was his destiny to sign himself \"the Empress's Jester.\"\r\nMadame de Montijo presented him to Louis Bonaparte, who accepted him,\r\nand who completed his Court with this insipid but plausible writer.\r\n\r\nThis Court was a heterogeneous collection; a dinner-wagon of basenesses,\r\na menagerie of reptiles, a herbal of poisons.\r\n\r\nBesides the trustworthy confederates who were for use, and the courtiers\r\nwho were for ornament, there were the auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nCertain circumstances called for reinforcements; sometimes these were\r\nwomen, _the Flying Squadron_.\r\n\r\nSometimes men: Saint-Arnaud, Espinasse, Saint-George, Maupas.\r\n\r\nSometimes neither men nor women: the Marquis de C.\r\n\r\nThe whole troop was noteworthy.\r\n\r\nLet us say a few words of it.\r\n\r\nThere was Vieillard the preceptor, an atheist with a tinge of\r\nCatholicism, a good billiard player.\r\n\r\nVieillard was an anecdotist. He recounted smilingly the following:--\r\nTowards the close of 1807 Queen Hortense, who of her own accord lived\r\nin Paris, wrote to the King Louis that she could not exist any longer\r\nwithout seeing him, that she could not do without him, and that she was\r\nabout to come to the Hague. The King said, \"She is with child.\" He sent\r\nfor his minister Van Maanen, showed him the Queen's letter, and added,\r\n\"She is coming. Very good. Our two chambers communicate by a door; the\r\nQueen will find it walled up.\" Louis took his royal mantle in earnest,\r\nfor he exclaimed, \"A King's mantle shall never serve as coverlet to a\r\nharlot.\" The minister Van Maanen, terrified, sent word of this to the\r\nEmperor. The Emperor fell into a rage, not against Hortense, but against\r\nLouis. Nevertheless Louis held firm; the door was not walled up, but his\r\nMajesty was; and when the Queen came he turned his back upon her. This\r\ndid not prevent Napoleon III. from being born.\r\n\r\nA suitable number of salvoes of cannon saluted this birth.\r\n\r\nSuch was the story which, in the summer of 1840, in the house called La\r\nTerrasse, before witnesses, among whom was Ferdinand B----, Marquis de la\r\nL----, a companion during boyhood of the author of this book, was told by\r\nM. Vieillard, an ironical Bonapartist, an arrant sceptic.\r\n\r\nBesides Vieillard there was Vaudrey, whom Louis Bonaparte made a General\r\nat the same time as Espinasse. In case of need a Colonel of Conspiracies\r\ncan become a General of Ambuscades.\r\n\r\nThere was Fialin,[14] the corporal who became a Duke.\r\n\r\nThere was Fleury, who was destined to the glory of travelling by the side\r\nof the Czar on his buttocks.\r\n\r\nThere was Lacrosse, a Liberal turned Clerical, one of those Conservatives\r\nwho push order as far as the embalming, and preservation as far as the\r\nmummy: later on a senator.\r\n\r\nThere was Larabit, a friend of Lacrosse, as much a domestic and not less\r\na senator.\r\n\r\nThere was Canon Coquereau, the \"Abbé of La Belle-Poule.\" The answer is\r\nknown which he made to a princess who asked him, \"What is the Elysée?\" It\r\nappears that one can say to a princess what one cannot say to a woman.\r\n\r\nThere was Hippolyte Fortoul, of the climbing genus, of the worth of a\r\nGustave Planche or of some Philarête Chasles, an ill-tempered writer who\r\nhad become Minister of the Marine, which caused Béranger to say, \"This\r\nFortoul knows all the spars, including the 'greased pole.'\"\r\n\r\nThere were some Auvergants there. Two. They hated each other. One had\r\nnicknamed the other \"the melancholy tinker.\"\r\n\r\nThere was Sainte-Beuve, a distinguished but inferior man, having a\r\npardonable fondness for ugliness. A great critic like Cousin is a great\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nThere was Troplong, who had had Dupin for Procurator, and whom Dupin had\r\nhad for President. Dupin, Troplong; the two side faces of the mask placed\r\nupon the brow of the law.\r\n\r\nThere was Abbatucci; a conscience which let everything pass by. To-day a\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThere was the Abbé M----, later on Bishop of Nancy, who emphasized with a\r\nsmile the oaths of Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThere were the frequenters of a famous box at the Opera, Montg---- and\r\nSept----, placing at the service of an unscrupulous prince the deep side\r\nof frivolous men.\r\n\r\nThere was Romieu--the outline of a drunkard behind a Red spectre.\r\n\r\nThere was Malitourne--not a bad friend, coarse and sincere.\r\n\r\nThere was Cuch----, whose name caused hesitation amongst the ushers at\r\nthe saloon doors.\r\n\r\nThere was Suin--a man able to furnish excellent counsel for bail actions.\r\n\r\nThere was Dr. Veron--who had on his cheek what the other men of the\r\nElysée had in their hearts.\r\n\r\nThere was Mocquart--once a handsome member of the Dutch Court. Mocquart\r\npossessed romantic recollections. He might by age, and perhaps otherwise,\r\nhave been the father of Louis Bonaparte. He was a lawyer. He had shown\r\nhimself quick-witted about 1829, at the same time as Romieu. Later on he\r\nhad published something, I no longer remember what, which was pompous and\r\nin quarto size, and which he sent to me. It was he who in May, 1847, had\r\ncome with Prince de la Moskowa to bring me King Jérome's petition to the\r\nChamber of Peers. This petition requested the readmittance of the\r\nbanished Bonaparte family into France. I supported it; a good action, and\r\na fault which I would again commit.\r\n\r\nThere was Billault, a semblance of an orator, rambling with facility, and\r\nmaking mistakes with authority, a reputed statesman. What constitutes the\r\nstatesman is a certain superior mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThere was Lavalette, completing Morny and Walewski.\r\n\r\nThere was Bacciochi.\r\n\r\nAnd yet others.\r\n\r\nIt was at the inspiration of these intimate associates that during his\r\nPresidency Louis Bonaparte, a species of Dutch Machiavelli, went hither\r\nand thither, to the Chamber and elsewhere, to Tours, to Ham, to Dijon,\r\nsnuffling, with a sleepy air, speeches full of treason.\r\n\r\nThe Elysée, wretched as it was, holds a place in the age. The Elysée, has\r\nengendered catastrophes and ridicule.\r\n\r\nOne cannot pass it over in silence.\r\n\r\nThe Elysée was the disquieting and dark corner of Paris. In this bad\r\nspot, the denizens were little and formidable. They formed a family\r\ncircle--of dwarfs. They had their maxim: to enjoy themselves. They lived\r\non public death. There they inhaled shame, and they throve on that which\r\nkills others. It was there that was reared up with art, purpose,\r\nindustry, and goodwill, the decadence of France. There worked the bought,\r\nfed, and obliging public men;--read prostituted. Even literature was\r\ncompounded there as we have shown; Vieillard was a classic of 1830, Morny\r\ncreated Choufleury, Louis Bonaparte was a candidate for the Academy.\r\nStrange place. Rambouillet's hotel mingled itself with the house of\r\nBancal. The Elysée has been the laboratory, the counting-house, the\r\nconfessional, the alcove, the den of the reign. The Elysée assumed to\r\ngovern everything, even the morals--above all the morals. It spread the\r\npaint on the bosom of women at the same time as the color on the faces of\r\nthe men. It set the fashion for toilette and for music. It invented the\r\ncrinoline and the operetta. At the Elysée a certain ugliness was\r\nconsidered as elegance; that which makes the countenance noble was there\r\nscoffed at, as was that which makes the soul great; the phrase, \"human\r\nface divine\" was ridiculed at the Elysée, and it was there that for\r\ntwenty years every baseness was brought into fashion--effrontery\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nHistory, whatever may be its pride, is condemned to know that the Elysée\r\nexisted. The grotesque side does not prevent the tragic side. There is at\r\nthe Elysée a room which has seen the second abdication, the abdication\r\nafter Waterloo. It is at the Elysée that Napoleon the First ended and\r\nthat Napoleon the Third began. It is at the Elysée that Dupin appeared to\r\nthe two Napoleons; in 1815 to depose the Great, in 1851 to worship the\r\nLittle. At this last epoch this place was perfectly villainous. There no\r\nlonger remained one virtue there. At the Court of Tiberius there was\r\nstill Thraseas, but round Louis Bonaparte there was nobody. If one sought\r\nConscience, one found Baroche; if one sought Religion, one found\r\nMontalembert.\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] Better known afterwards as Persigny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WAVERING ALLY\r\n\r\nDuring this terribly historical morning of the 4th of December, a day the\r\nmaster was closely observed by his satellites, Louis Bonaparte had shut\r\nhimself up, but in doing so he betrayed himself. A man who shuts himself\r\nup meditates, and for such men to meditate is to premeditate. What could\r\nbe the premeditation of Louis Bonaparte? What was working in his mind.\r\nQuestions which all asked themselves, two persons excepted,--Morny, the\r\nman of thought; Saint-Arnaud, the man of action.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte claimed, justly, a knowledge of men. He prided himself\r\nupon it, and from a certain point of view he was right. Others have the\r\npower of divination; he had the faculty of scent. It is brute-like, but\r\ntrustworthy.\r\n\r\nHe had assuredly not been mistaken in Maupas. To pick the lock of the Law\r\nhe needed a skeleton key. He took Maupas. Nor could any burglar's\r\nimplement have answered better in the lock of the Constitution than\r\nMaupas. Neither was he mistaken in Q.B. He saw at once that this serious\r\nman had in him the necessary composite qualities of a rascal. And in\r\nfact, Q.B., after having voted and signed the Deposition at the Mairie of\r\nthe Tenth Arrondissement, became one of the three reporters of the Joint\r\nCommissions; and his share in the abominable total recorded by history\r\namounts to _sixteen hundred and thirty four victims_.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte, however, at times judged amiss, especially respecting\r\nPeauger. Peauger, though chosen by him, remained an honest man. Louis\r\nBonaparte, mistrusting the workmen of the National Printing-Office, and\r\nnot without reason, for twelve, as has been seen, were refractory, had\r\nimprovised a branch establishment in case of emergency, a sort of State\r\nSub-Printing-Office, as it were, situated in the Rue de Luxembourg, with\r\nsteam and hand presses, and eight workmen. He had given the management of\r\nit to Peauger. When the hour of the Crime arrived, and with it the\r\nnecessity of printing the nefarious placards, he sounded Peauger, and\r\nfound him rebellious. He then turned to Saint Georges, a more subservient\r\nlackey.\r\n\r\nHe was less mistaken, but still he was mistaken, in his appreciation of\r\nX.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of December, X., an ally thought necessary by Morny, became a\r\nsource of anxiety to Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nX. was forty-four years of age, loved women, craved promotion, and,\r\ntherefore, was not over-scrupulous. He began his career in Africa under\r\nColonel Combes in the forty-seventh of the line. He showed great bravery\r\nat Constantine; at Zaatcha he extricated Herbillon, and the siege, badly\r\nbegun by Herbillon, had been brought to a successful termination by him.\r\nX., who was a little short man, his head sunk in his shoulders, was\r\nintrepid, and admirably understood the handling of a brigade. Bugeaud,\r\nLamoricière, Cavaignac, and Changarnier were his four stepping-stones to\r\nadvancement. At Paris, in 1851, he met Lamoricière, who received him\r\ncoldly, and Changarnier, who treated him better. He left Satory\r\nindignant, exclaiming, \"_We must finish with this Louis Bonaparte. He is\r\ncorrupting the army. These drunken soldiers make one sick at heart. I\r\nshall return to Africa_.\" In October Changarnier's influence decreased,\r\nand X.'s enthusiasm abated. X. then frequented the Elysée, but without\r\ngiving his adherence. He promised his support to General Bedeau, who\r\ncounted upon him. At daybreak on the 2d of December some one came to\r\nwaken X. It was Edgar Ney. X. was a prop for the _coup d'état_, but would\r\nhe consent? Edgar Ney explained the affair to him, and left him only\r\nafter seeing him leave the barracks of the Rue Verte at the head of the\r\nfirst regiment. X. took up his position at the Place de la Madeleine. As\r\nhe arrived there La Rochejaquelein, thrust back from the Chamber by its\r\ninvaders, crossed the Place. La Rochejaquelein, not yet a Bonapartist,\r\nwas furious. He perceived X., his old schoolfellow at the Ecole Militaire\r\nin 1830, with whom he was on intimate terms. He went up to him,\r\nexclaiming, \"This is an infamous act. What are you doing?\" \"_I am\r\nwaiting_,\" answered X. La Rochejaquelein left him; X. dismounted, and\r\nwent to see a relation, a Councillor of State, M.R., who lived in the Rue\r\nde Suresne. He asked his advice. M.R., an honest man, did not hesitate.\r\nHe answered, \"I am going to the Council of State to do my duty. It is a\r\nCrime.\" X. shook his head, and said, \"_We must wait and see_.\"\r\n\r\nThis _I am waiting_, and _We must see_, preoccupied Louis Bonaparte.\r\nMorny said, \"_Let us make use of the flying squadron_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIS DUSSOUBS\r\n\r\nGaston Dussoubs was one of the bravest members of the Left. He was a\r\nRepresentative of the Haute-Vienne. At the time of his first appearance\r\nin the Assembly he wore, as formerly did Théophile Gautier, a red\r\nwaistcoat, and the shudder which Gautier's waistcoat caused among the men\r\nof letters in 1830, Gaston Dussoubs' waistcoat caused among the Royalists\r\nof 1851. M. Parisis, Bishop of Langres, who would have had no objection\r\nto a red hat, was terrified by Gaston Dussoubs' red waistcoat. Another\r\nsource of horror to the Right was that Dussoubs had, it was said, passed\r\nthree years at Belle Isle as a political prisoner, a penalty incurred by\r\nthe \"Limoges Affair.\" Universal Suffrage had, it would seem, taken him\r\nthence to place him in the Assembly. To go from the prison to the Senate\r\nis certainly not very surprising in our changeful times, although it is\r\nsometimes followed by a return from the Senate to the prison. But the\r\nRight was mistaken, the culprit of Limoges was, not Gaston Dussoubs, but\r\nhis brother Denis.\r\n\r\nIn fine, Gaston Dussoubs inspired fear. He was witty, courageous, and\r\ngentle.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851 I went to dine every day at the Concièrgerie with\r\nmy two sons and my two imprisoned friends. These great hearts and great\r\nminds, Vacquerie, Meurice, Charles, and François Victor, attracted men of\r\nlike quality. The livid half-light that crept in through latticed and\r\nbarred windows disclosed a family circle at which there often assembled\r\neloquent orators, among others Crémieux, and powerful and charming\r\nwriters, including Peyrat.\r\n\r\nOne day Michel de Bourges brought to us Gaston Dussoubs.\r\n\r\nGaston Dussoubs lived in the Faubourg St. Germain, near the Assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of December we did not see him at our meetings. He was ill,\r\n\"nailed down\" as he wrote me, by rheumatism of the joints, and compelled\r\nto keep his bed.\r\n\r\nHe had a brother younger than himself, whom we have just mentioned, Denis\r\nDussoubs. On the morning of the 4th his brother went to see him.\r\n\r\nGaston Dussoubs knew of the _coup d'état_, and was exasperated at being\r\nobliged to remain in bed. He exclaimed, \"I am dishonored. There will be\r\nbarricades, and my sash will not be there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said his brother. \"It will be there!\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lend it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it.\"\r\n\r\nDenis took Gaston's sash, and went away.\r\n\r\nWe shall see Denis Dussoubs later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nITEMS AND INTERVIEWS\r\n\r\nLamoricière on the same morning found means to convey to me by Madame de\r\nCourbonne[15] the following information.\r\n\r\n\"---- Fortress of Ham.--The Commandant's name is Baudot. His appointment,\r\nmade by Cavaignac in 1848, was countersigned by Charras. Both are to-day\r\nhis prisoners. The Commissary of Police, sent by Morny to the village of\r\nHam to watch the movements of the jailer and the prisoners, is Dufaure de\r\nPouillac.\"[16]\r\n\r\nI thought when I received this communication that the Commandant Baudot,\r\n\"the jailer,\" had connived at its rapid transmission.\r\n\r\nA sign of the instability of the central power.\r\n\r\nLamoricière, by the same means, put me in possession of some details\r\nconcerning his arrest and that of his fellow-generals.\r\n\r\nThese details complete those which I have already given.\r\n\r\nThe arrests of the Generals were affected at the same time at their\r\nrespective homes under nearly similar circumstances. Everywhere houses\r\nsurrounded, doors opened by artifice or burst open by force, porters\r\ndeceived, sometimes garotted, men in disguise, men provided with ropes,\r\nmen armed with axes, surprises in bed, nocturnal violence. A plan of\r\naction which resembled, as I have said, an invasion of brigands.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lamoricière, according to his own expression, was a sound\r\nsleeper. Notwithstanding the noise at his door, he did not awake. His\r\nservant, a devoted old soldier, spoke in a loud voice, and called out to\r\narouse the General. He even offered resistance to the police. A police\r\nagent wounded him in the knee with a sword thrust.[17] The General was\r\nawakened, seized, and carried away.\r\n\r\nWhile passing in a carriage along the Quai Malaquais, Lamoricière noticed\r\ntroops marching by with their knapsacks on their backs. He leaned quickly\r\nforward out of the window. The Commissary of Police thought he was about\r\nto address the soldiers. He seized the General by the arm, and said to\r\nhim, \"General, if you say a word I shall put this on you.\" And with the\r\nother hand he showed him in the dim light something which proved to be a\r\ngag.\r\n\r\nAll the Generals arrested were taken to Mazas. There they were locked up\r\nand forgotten. At eight in the evening General Changarnier had eaten\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThese arrests were not pleasant tasks for the Commissaries of Police.\r\nThey were made to drink down their shame in large draughts. Cavaignac,\r\nLeflô, Changarnier, Bedeau, and Lamoricière did not spare them any more\r\nthan Charras did. As he was leaving, General Cavaignac took some money\r\nwith him. Before putting it in his pocket, he turned towards Colin, the\r\nCommissary of Police who had arrested him, and said, \"Will this money be\r\nsafe on me?\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissary exclaimed, \"Oh, General, what are you thinking of?\"\r\n\r\n\"What assurance have I that you are not thieves?\" answered Cavaignac. At\r\nthe same time, nearly the same moment, Charras said to Courteille, the\r\nCommissary of Police, \"Who can tell me that you are not pick-pockets?\"\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards these pitiful wretches all received the Cross of\r\nthe Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nThis cross given by the last Bonaparte to policemen after the 2d of\r\nDecember is the same as that affixed by the first Napoleon to the eagles\r\nof the Grand Army after Austerlitz.\r\n\r\nI communicated these details to the Committee. Other reports came in. A\r\nfew concerned the Press. Since the morning of the 4th the Press was\r\ntreated with soldierlike brutality. Serrière, the courageous printer,\r\ncame to tell us what had happened at the _Presse_. Serrière published\r\nthe _Presse_ and the _Avénement du Peuple_, the latter a new name for\r\nthe _Evénement_, which had been judicially suppressed. On the 2d, at\r\nseven o'clock in the morning, the printing-office had been occupied by\r\ntwenty-eight soldiers of the Republican Guard, commanded by a\r\nLieutenant named Pape (since decorated for this achievement). This man\r\nhad given Serrière an order prohibiting the printing of any article\r\nsigned \"Nusse.\" A Commissary of Police accompanied Lieutenant Pape.\r\nThis Commissary had notified Serrière of a \"decree of the President of\r\nthe Republic,\" suppressing the _Avénement du Peuple_, and had placed\r\nsentinels over the presses. The workmen had resisted, and one of them\r\nsaid to the soldiers, \"_We shall print it in spite of you_.\" Then forty\r\nadditional Municipal Guards arrived, with two quarter-masters, four\r\ncorporals, and a detachment of the line, with drums at their head,\r\ncommanded by a captain. Girardin came up indignant, and protested with\r\nso much energy that a quarter-master said to him, \"_I should like a\r\nColonel of your stamp_.\" Girardin's courage communicated itself to the\r\nworkmen, and by dint of skill and daring, under the very eyes of the\r\ngendarmes, they succeeded in printing Girardin's proclamations with the\r\nhand-press, and ours with the brush. They carried them away wet, in\r\nsmall packages, under their waistcoats.\r\n\r\nLuckily the soldiers were drunk. The gendarmes made them drink, and\r\nthe workmen, profiting by their revels, printed. The Municipal Guards\r\nlaughed, swore and jested, drank champagne and coffee, and said, \"_We\r\nfill the places of the Representatives, we have twenty-five francs a\r\nday_.\" All the printing-houses in Paris were occupied in the same manner\r\nby the soldiery. The _coup d'état_ reigned everywhere. The Crime even\r\nill-treated the Press which supported it. At the office of the _Moniteur\r\nParisien_, the police agents threatened to fire on any one who should\r\nopen a door. M. Delamare, director of the _Patrie_, had forty Municipal\r\nGuards on his hands, and trembled lest they should break his presses. He\r\nsaid to one of them, \"_Why, I am on your side_.\" The gendarme replied,\r\n\"_What is that to me?_\"\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock on the morning of the 4th all the printing-offices were\r\nevacuated by the soldiers. The Captain said to Serrière, \"We have orders\r\nto concentrate in our own quarters.\" And Serrière, in announcing this\r\nfact, added, \"Something is in preparation.\"\r\n\r\nI had had since the previous night several conversations with Georges\r\nBiscarrat, an honest and brave man, of whom I shall have occasion to\r\nspeak hereafter. I had given him rendezvous at No. 19, Rue Richelieu.\r\nMany persons came and went during this morning of the 4th from No. 15,\r\nwhere we deliberated, to No. 19, where I slept.\r\n\r\nAs I left this honest and courageous man in the street I saw M. Mérimée,\r\nhis exact opposite, coming towards me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said M. Mérimée, \"I was looking for you.\"\r\n\r\nI answered him,--\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will not find me.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand to me, and I turned my back on him.\r\n\r\nI have not seen him since. I believe he is dead.\r\n\r\nIn speaking one day in 1847 with Mérimée about Morny, we had the\r\nfollowing conversation:--Mérimée said, \"M. de Morny has a great future\r\nbefore him.\" And he asked me, \"Do you know him?\"\r\n\r\nI answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he has a fine future before him! Yes, I know M. de Morny. He is a\r\nclever man. He goes a great deal into society, and conducts commercial\r\noperations. He started the Vieille Montagne affair, the zinc-mines, and\r\nthe coal-mines of Liège. I have the honor of his acquaintance. He is a\r\nsharper.\"\r\n\r\nThere was this difference between Mérimée and myself: I despised Morny,\r\nand he esteemed him.\r\n\r\nMorny reciprocated his feeling. It was natural.\r\n\r\nI waited until Mérimée had passed the corner of the street. As soon as\r\nhe disappeared I went into No. 15.\r\n\r\nThere, they had received news of Canrobert. On the 2d he went to see\r\nMadame Leflô, that noble woman, who was most indignant at what had\r\nhappened. There was to be a ball next day given by Saint-Arnaud at the\r\nMinistry of War. General and Madame Leflô were invited, and had made an\r\nappointment there with General Canrobert. But the ball did not form a\r\npart of Madame Leflô's conversation with him. \"General,\" said she, \"all\r\nyour comrades are arrested; is it possible that you give your support\r\nto such an act?\" \"What I intend giving,\" replied Canrobert, \"is my\r\nresignation and,\" he added, \"you may tell General Leflô so.\" He was pale,\r\nand walked up and down, apparently much agitated. \"Your resignation,\r\nGeneral?\" \"Yes, Madame.\" \"Is it positive?\" \"Yes, Madame, if there is no\r\nriot.\" \"General Canrobert,\" exclaimed Madame Leflô, \"that _if_ tells me\r\nyour intentions.\"\r\n\r\nCanrobert, however, had not yet taken his decision. Indeed, indecision\r\nwas one of his chief characteristics. Pelissier, who was cross-grained\r\nand gruff, used to say, \"Judge men by their names, indeed! I am\r\nchristened _Amable_, Randon _César_, and Canrobert _Certain_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] No. 16, Rue d'Anjou, Saint Honoré.\r\n\r\n[16] The author still has in his possession the note written by\r\nLamoricière.\r\n\r\n[17] Later on, the wound having got worse, he was obliged to have his\r\nleg taken off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITUATION\r\n\r\nAlthough the fighting tactics of the Committee were, for the reasons\r\nwhich I have already given, not to concentrate all their means of\r\nresistance into one hour, or in one particular place, but to spread\r\nthem over as many points and as many days as possible, each of us knew\r\ninstinctively, as also the criminals of the Elysée on their side, that\r\nthe day would be decisive.\r\n\r\nThe moment drew near when the _coup d'état_ would storm us from every\r\nside, and when we should have to sustain the onslaught of an entire\r\narmy. Would the people, that great revolutionary populace of the\r\nfaubourgs of Paris, abandon their Representatives? Would they abandon\r\nthemselves? Or, awakened and enlightened, would they at length arise? A\r\nquestion more and more vital, and which we repeated to ourselves with\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThe National Guard had shown no sign of earnestness. The eloquent\r\nproclamation, written at Marie's by Jules Favre and Alexander Rey, and\r\naddressed in our name to the National Legions, had not been printed.\r\nHetzel's scheme had failed. Versigny and Lebrousse had not been able to\r\nrejoin him; the place appointed for their meeting, the corner of the\r\nboulevard and the Rue de Richelieu, having been continually scoured by\r\ncharges of cavalry. The courageous effort of Colonel Grassier to win\r\nover the Sixth Legion, the more timid attempt of Lieutenant Colonel\r\nHowyne upon the Fifth, had failed. Nevertheless indignation began to\r\nmanifest itself in Paris. The preceding evening had been significant.\r\n\r\nHingray came to us during the morning, bringing under his cloak a\r\nbundle of copies of the Decree of Deposition, which had been reprinted.\r\nIn order to bring them to us he had twice run the risk of being\r\narrested and shot. We immediately caused these copies to be distributed\r\nand placarded. This placarding was resolutely carried out; at several\r\npoints our placards were posted by the side of the placards of the\r\n_coup d'état_, which pronounced the penalty of death against any one\r\nwho should placard the decrees emanating from the Representatives.\r\nHingray told us that our proclamations and our decrees had been\r\nlithographed and distributed by hand in thousands. It Was urgently\r\nnecessary that we should continue our publications. A printer, who had\r\nformerly been a publisher of several democratic journals, M. Boulé, had\r\noffered me his services on the preceding evening. In June, 1848, I had\r\nprotected his printing-office, then being devastated by the National\r\nGuards. I wrote to him: I enclosed our judgments and our decrees in the\r\nletter, and the Representative Montaigu undertook to take them to him.\r\nM. Boulé excused himself; his printing-presses had been seized by the\r\npolice at midnight.\r\n\r\nThrough the precautions which we had taken, and thanks to the patriotic\r\nassistance of several young medical and chemical students, powder had\r\nbeen manufactured in several quarters. At one point alone, the Rue\r\nJacob, a hundred kilogrammes had been turned out during the night. As,\r\nhowever, this manufacture was principally carried out on the left bank\r\nof the river, and as the fighting took place on the right bank, it was\r\nnecessary to transport this powder across the bridges. They managed\r\nthis In the best manner they could. Towards nine o'clock we were warned\r\nthat the police, having been informed of this, had organized a system\r\nof inspection, and that all persons crossing the river were searched,\r\nparticularly on the Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nA certain strategical plan became manifest. The ten central bridges\r\nmere militarily guarded.\r\n\r\nPeople were arrested in the street on account of their personal\r\nappearance. A sergent-de-ville, at the corner of he Pont-au-Change,\r\nexclaimed, loud enough for the passers-by to hear, \"We shall lay hold\r\nof all those who have not their beards properly trimmed, or who do not\r\nappear to have slept.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this we had a little powder; the disarming of the\r\nNational Guard at various points had produced about eight hundred\r\nmuskets, our proclamations and our decrees were being placarded, our\r\nvoice was reaching the people, a certain confidence was springing up.\r\n\r\n\"The wave is rising! the wave is rising!\" exclaimed Edgar Quinet, who\r\nhad come to shake my hand.\r\n\r\nWe were informed that the schools were rising in insurrection during\r\nthe day, and that they offered us a refuge in the midst of them.\r\n\r\nJules Favre exclaimed joyfully,--\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we shall date our decrees from the Pantheon.\"\r\n\r\nSigns of good omen grew more numerous. An old hotbed of insurrection,\r\nthe Rue Saint-André-des-Arts, was becoming agitated. The association\r\ncalled La Presse du Travail gave signs of life. Some brave workmen, at\r\nthe house of one of their colleagues, Nétré No. 13, Rue du Jardinet,\r\nhad organized a little printing-press in a garret, a few steps from the\r\nbarracks of the Gendarmerie Mobile. They had spent the night first in\r\ncompiling, and then in printing \"A Manifesto to Working Men,\" which\r\ncalled the people to arms. They were five skilful and determined men;\r\nthey had procured paper, they had perfectly new type; some of them\r\nmoistened the paper, while the others composed; towards two o'clock in\r\nthe morning they began to print. It was essential that they should not\r\nbe heard by the neighbors; they had succeeded in muffling the hollow\r\nblows of the ink-rollers, alternating with the rapid sound of the\r\nprinting blankets. In a few hours fifteen hundred copies were pulled,\r\nand at daybreak they were placarded at the corners of the streets. The\r\nleader of these intrepid workmen, A. Desmoulins, who belonged to that\r\nsturdy race of men who are both cultured and who can fight, had been\r\ngreatly disheartened on the preceding day; he now had become hopeful.\r\n\r\nOn the preceding day he wrote:--\"Where are the Representatives? The\r\ncommunications are cut. The quays and the boulevards can no longer be\r\ncrossed. It has become impossible to reunite the popular Assembly. The\r\npeople need direction. De Flotte in one district, Victor Hugo in\r\nanother, Schoelcher in a third, are actively urging on the combat, and\r\nexpose their lives a score of times, but none feel themselves supported\r\nby any organized body: and moreover the attempt of the Royalists in the\r\nTenth Arrondissement has roused apprehension. People dread lest they\r\nshould see them reappear when all is accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nNow, this man so intelligent and so courageous recovered confidence,\r\nand he wrote,--\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly, Louis Napoleon is afraid. The police reports are alarming\r\nfor him. The resistance of the Republican Representatives is bearing\r\nfruit. Paris is arming. Certain regiments appear ready to turn back.\r\nThe Gendarmerie itself is not to be depended upon, and this morning an\r\nentire regiment refused to march. Disorder is beginning to show itself\r\nin the services. Two batteries fired upon each other for a long time\r\nwithout recognition. One would say that the _coup d'état_ is about to\r\nfail.\"\r\n\r\nThe symptoms, as may be seen, were growing more reassuring.\r\n\r\nHad Maupas become unequal to the task? Had they resorted to a more\r\nskilful man? An incident seemed to point to this. On the preceding\r\nevening a tall man had been seen, between five and seven o'clock,\r\nwalking up and down before the café of the Place Saint-Michel; he had\r\nbeen joined by two of the Commissaries of the Police who had effected\r\nthe arrests of the 2d of December, and had talked to them for a long\r\ntime. This man was Carlier. Was he about to supplant Maupas?\r\n\r\nThe Representative Labrousse, seated at a table of the café, had\r\nwitnessed this conspirators' parley.\r\n\r\nEach of the two Commissaries was followed by that species of police\r\nagent which is called \"the Commissary's dog.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time strange warnings reached the Committee; the following\r\nletter[18] was brought to our knowledge.\r\n\r\n  \"3d December.\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR BOCAGE,\r\n\r\n  \"To-day at six o'clock, 25,000 francs has been offered to any one who\r\n  arrests or kills Hugo.\r\n\r\n  \"You know where he is. He must not go out under any pretext whatever.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n  \"AL. DUMAS.\"\r\n\r\nAt the back was written, \"Bocage, 18, Rue Cassette.\" It was necessary\r\nthat the minutest details should be considered. In the different places\r\nof combat a diversity of passwords prevailed, which might cause danger.\r\nFor the password on the day before we had given the name of \"Baudin.\" In\r\nimitation of this the names of other Representatives had been adopted as\r\npasswords on barricades. In the Rue Rambuteau the password was \"Eugène\r\nSue and Michel de Bourges;\" in the Rue Beaubourg, \"Victor Hugo;\" at the\r\nSaint Denis chapel, \"Esquiros and De Flotte.\" We thought it necessary to\r\nput a stop to this confusion, and to suppress the proper names, which\r\nare always easy to guess. The password settled upon was, \"What is Joseph\r\ndoing?\"\r\n\r\nAt every moment items of news and information came to us from all\r\nsides, that barricades were everywhere being raised, and that firing\r\nwas beginning in the central streets. Michel de Bourges exclaimed,\r\n\"Construct a square of four barricades, and we will go and deliberate\r\nin the centre.\"\r\n\r\nWe received news from Mont Valérien. Two prisoners the more. Rigal and\r\nBelle had just been committed. Both of the Left. Dr. Rigal was the\r\nRepresentative of Gaillac, and Belle of Lavaur. Rigal was ill; they had\r\narrested him in bed. In prison he lay upon a pallet, and could not\r\ndress himself. His colleague Belle acted as his _valet de chambre_.\r\n\r\nTowards nine o'clock an ex-Captain of the 8th Legion of the National\r\nGuard of 1848, named Jourdan, came to place himself at our service. He\r\nwas a bold man, one of those who had carried out, on the morning of the\r\n24th February, the rash surprise of the Hôtel de Ville. We charged him\r\nto repeat this surprise, and to extend it to the Prefecture of Police.\r\nHe knew how to set about the work. He told us that he had only a few\r\nmen, but that during the day he would cause certain houses of strategical\r\nimportance on the Quai des Cèvres, on the Quai Lepelletier, and in the\r\nRue de la Cité, to be silently occupied, and that if it should chance\r\nthat the leaders of the _coup d'état_, owing to the combat in the centre\r\nof Paris growing more serious, should be forced to withdraw the troops\r\nfrom the Hôtel de Ville and the Prefecture, an attack would be immediately\r\ncommenced on these two points. Captain Jourdan, we may at once mention,\r\ndid what he had promised us; unfortunately, as we learnt that evening,\r\nhe began perhaps a little too soon. As he had foreseen, a moment arrived\r\nwhen the square of the Hôtel de Ville was almost devoid of troops, General\r\nHerbillon having been forced to leave it with his cavalry to take the\r\nbarricades of the centre in the rear. The attack of the Republicans burst\r\nforth instantly. Musket shots were fired from the windows on the Quai\r\nLepelletier; but the left of the column was still on the Pont d'Arcole,\r\na line of riflemen had been placed by a major named Larochette before\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville, the 44th retraced its steps, and the attempt\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nBastide arrived, with Chauffour and Laissac.\r\n\r\n\"Good news,\" said he to us, \"all is going on well.\" His grave, honest,\r\nand dispassionate countenance shone with a sort of patriotic serenity.\r\nHe came from the barricades, and was about to return thither. He had\r\nreceived two balls in his cloak. I took him aside, and said to him,\r\n\"Are you going back?\" \"Yes.\" \"Take me with you.\" \"No,\" answered he,\r\n\"you are necessary here. To-day you are the general, I am the soldier.\"\r\nI insisted in vain. He persisted in refusing, repeating continually.\r\n\"The Committee is our centre, it should not disperse itself. It is your\r\nduty to remain here. Besides,\" added he, \"Make your mind easy. You run\r\nhere more risk than we do. If you are taken you will be shot.\" \"Well,\r\nthen,\" said I, \"the moment may come when our duty will be to join in\r\nthe combat.\" \"Without doubt.\" I resumed, \"You who are on the barricades\r\nwill be better judges than we shall of that moment. Give me your word\r\nof honor that you will treat me as you would wish me to treat you, and\r\nthat you will come and fetch us.\" \"I give it you,\" he answered, and he\r\npressed my two hands in his own.\r\n\r\nLater on, however, a few moments after Bastide had left, great as was\r\nmy confidence in the loyal word of this courageous and generous man, I\r\ncould no longer restrain myself, and I profited by an interval of two\r\nhours of which I could dispose, to go and see with my own eyes what was\r\ntaking place, and in what manner the resistance was behaving.\r\n\r\nI took a carriage in the square of the Palais Royal. I explained to the\r\ndriver who I was, and that I was about to visit and encourage the\r\nbarricades; that I should go sometimes on foot, sometimes in the\r\ncarriage, and that I trusted myself to him. I told him my name.\r\n\r\nThe first comer is almost always an honest man. This true-hearted\r\ncoachman answered me, \"I know where the barricades are. I will drive\r\nyou wherever it is necessary. I will wait for you wherever it is\r\nnecessary. I will drive you there and bring you back; and if you have\r\nno money, do not pay me, I am proud of such an action.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we started.\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] The original of this note is in the hands of the author of this\r\nbook. It was handed to us by M. Avenel on the part of M. Bocage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTE SAINT MARTIN\r\n\r\nImportant deeds had been already achieved during the morning.\r\n\r\n\"It is taking root,\" Bastide had said.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is not to spread the flames but to light the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Paris began to grow ill-tempered. Paris does not\r\nget angry at will. She must be in the humor for it. A volcano possesses\r\nnerves. The anger was coming slowly, but it was coming. On the horizon\r\nmight be seen the first glimmering of the eruption.\r\n\r\nFor the Elysée, as for us, the critical moment was drawing nigh. From\r\nthe preceding evening they were nursing their resources. The _coup\r\nd'état_ and the Republic were at length about to close with each other.\r\nThe Committee had in vain attempted to drag the wheel; some\r\nirresistible impulse carried away the last defenders of liberty and\r\nhurried them on to action. The decisive battle was about to be fought.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, when certain hours have sounded, when there appears an\r\nimmediate necessity for a progressive movement to be carried out, or a\r\nright to be vindicated, the insurrections rapidly spread throughout the\r\nwhole city. But they always begin at some particular point. Paris, in\r\nits vast historical task, comprises two revolutionary classes, the\r\n\"middle-class\" and the \"people.\" And to these two combatants correspond\r\ntwo places of combat; the Porte Saint Martin when the middle-class are\r\nrevolting, the Bastille when the people are revolting. The eye of the\r\npolitician should always be fixed on these two points. There, famous in\r\ncontemporary history, are two spots where a small portion of the hot\r\ncinders of Revolution seem ever to smoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen a wind blows from above, these burning cinders are dispersed, and\r\nfill the city with sparks.\r\n\r\nThis time, as we have already explained, the formidable Faubourg\r\nAntoine slumbered, and, as has been seen, nothing had been able to\r\nawaken it. An entire park of artillery was encamped with lighted\r\nmatches around the July Column, that enormous deaf-and-dumb memento of\r\nthe Bastille. This lofty revolutionary pillar, this silent witness of\r\nthe great deeds of the past, seemed to have forgotten all. Sad to say,\r\nthe paving stones which had seen the 14th of July did not rise under\r\nthe cannon-wheels of the 2d of December. It was therefore not the\r\nBastille which began, it was the Porte Saint Martin.\r\n\r\nFrom eight o'clock in the morning the Rue Saint Denis and the Rue Saint\r\nMartin were in an uproar throughout their length; throngs of indignant\r\npassers-by went up and down those thoroughfares. They tore down the\r\nplacards of the _coup d'état_; they posted up our Proclamations; groups\r\nat the corners of all the adjacent streets commented upon the decree of\r\noutlawry drawn up by the members of the Left remaining at liberty; they\r\nsnatched the copies from each other. Men mounted on the kerbstones read\r\naloud the names of the 120 signatories, and, still more than on the day\r\nbefore, each significant or celebrated name was hailed with applause.\r\nThe crowd increased every moment--and the anger. The entire Rue Saint\r\nDenis presented the strange aspect of a street with all the doors and\r\nwindows closed, and all the inhabitants in the open air. Look at the\r\nhouses, there is death; look at the street, it is the tempest.\r\n\r\nSome fifty determined men suddenly emerged from a side alley, and\r\nbegan to run through the streets, saying, \"To arms! Long live the\r\nRepresentatives of the Left! Long live the Constitution!\" The disarming\r\nof the National Guards began. It was carried out more easily than on\r\nthe preceding evening. In less than an hour more than 150 muskets had\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the street became covered with barricades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY VISIT TO THE BARRICADE\r\n\r\nMy coachman deposited me at the corner of Saint Eustache, and said to\r\nme, \"Here you are in the hornets' nest.\"\r\n\r\nHe added, \"I will wait for you in the Rue de la Vrillière, near the\r\nPlace des Victoires. Take your time.\"\r\n\r\nI began walking from barricade to barricade.\r\n\r\nIn the first I met De Flotte, who offered to serve me as a guide. There\r\nis not a more determined man than De Flotte. I accepted his offer; he\r\ntook me everywhere where my presence could be of use.\r\n\r\nOn the way he gave me an account of the steps taken by him to print our\r\nproclamations; Boulé's printing-office having failed him, he had applied\r\nto a lithographic press, at No. 30, Rue Bergère, and at the peril of\r\ntheir lives two brave men had printed 500 copies of our decrees. These\r\ntwo true-hearted workmen were named, the one Rubens, the other Achille\r\nPoincellot.\r\n\r\nWhile walking I made jottings in pencil (with Baudin's pencil, which I\r\nhad with me); I registered facts at random; I reproduce this page here.\r\nThese living facts are useful for History; the _coup d'état_ is there,\r\nas though freshly bleeding.\r\n\r\n\"Morning of the 4th. It looks as if the combat was suspended. Will it\r\nburst forth again? Barricades visited by me: one at the corner of\r\nSaint Eustache. One at the Oyster Market. One in the Rue Mauconseil.\r\nOne in the Rue Tiquetonne. One in the Rue Mandar (Rocher de Cancale).\r\nOne barring the Rue du Cadran and the Rue Montorgueil. Four closing\r\nthe Petit-Carreau. The beginning of one between the Rue des Deux\r\nPortes and the Rue Saint Sauveur, barring the Rue Saint Denis. One,\r\nthe largest, barring the Rue Saint Denis, at the top of the Rue\r\nGuérin-Boisseau. One barring the Rue Grenetat. One farther on in the\r\nRue Grenetat, barring the Rue Bourg-Labbé (in the centre an overturned\r\nflour wagon; a good barricade). In the Rue Saint Denis one barring the\r\nRue de Petit-Lion-Saint-Sauveur. One barring the Rue du Grand\r\nHurleur, with its four corners barricaded. This barricade has already\r\nbeen attacked this morning. A combatant, Massonnet, a comb-maker of\r\n154, Rue Saint Denis, received a ball in his overcoat; Dupapet, called\r\n'the man with the long beard,' was the last to stay on the summit of\r\nthe barricade. He was heard to cry out to the officers commanding the\r\nattack, 'You are traitors!' He is believed to have been shot. The\r\ntroops retired--strange to say without demolishing the barricade. A\r\nbarricade is being constructed in the Rue du Renard. Some National\r\nGuards in uniform watch its construction, but do not work on it. One\r\nof them said to me, 'We are not against you, you are on the side of\r\nRight.' They add that there are twelve or fifteen barricades in the\r\nRue Rambuteau. This morning at daybreak the cannon had fired\r\n'steadily,' as one of them remarks, in the Rue Bourbon-Villeneuve. I\r\nvisit a powder manufactory improvised by Leguevel at a chemist's\r\nopposite the Rue Guérin-Boisseau.\r\n\r\n\"They are constructing the barricades amicably, without angering any\r\none. They do what they can not to annoy the neighborhood. The combatants\r\nof the Bourg-Labbé barricades are ankle-deep in mud on account of the\r\nrain. It is a perfect sewer. They hesitate to ask for a truss of straw.\r\nThey lie down in the water or on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\"I saw there a young man who was ill, and who had just got up from his\r\nbed with the fever still on him. He said to me, 'I am going to my death'\r\n(he did so).\r\n\r\n\"In the Rue Bourbon-Villeneuve they had not even asked a mattress of the\r\n'shopkeepers,' although, the barricade being bombarded, they needed them\r\nto deaden the effect of the balls.\r\n\r\n\"The soldiers make bad barricades, because they make them too well. A\r\nbarricade should be tottering; when well built it is worth nothing; the\r\npaving-stones should want equilibrium, 'so that they may roll down on\r\nthe troopers,' said a street-boy to me, 'and break their paws.' Sprains\r\nform a part of barricade warfare.\r\n\r\n\"Jeanty Sarre is the chief of a complete group of barricades. He\r\npresented his first lieutenant to me, Charpentier, a man of thirty-six,\r\nlettered and scientific. Charpentier busies himself with experiments\r\nwith the object of substituting gas for coal and wood in the firing of\r\nchina, and he asks permission to read a tragedy to me 'one of these\r\ndays.' I said to him, 'We shall make one.'\r\n\r\n\"Jeanty Sarre is grumbling at Charpentier; the ammunition is failing.\r\nJeanty Sarre, having at his house in the Rue Saint Honoré a pound of\r\nfowling-powder and twenty army cartridges, sent Charpentier to get them.\r\nCharpentier went there, and brought back the fowling-powder and the\r\ncartridges, but distributed them to the combatants on the barricades\r\nwhom he met on the way. 'They were as though famished,' said he.\r\nCharpentier had never in his life touched a fire-arm. Jeanty Sarre\r\nshowed him how to load a gun.\r\n\r\n\"They take their meals at a wine-seller's at the corner, and they warm\r\nthemselves there. It is very cold. The wine-seller says, 'Those who are\r\nhungry, go and eat.' A combatant asked him, 'Who pays?' 'Death,' was the\r\nanswer. And in truth some hours afterwards he had received seventeen\r\nbayonet thrusts.\r\n\r\n\"They have not broken the gas-pipes--always for the sake of not doing\r\nunnecessary damage. They confine themselves to requisitioning the\r\ngasmen's keys, and the lamplighters' winches in order to open the pipes.\r\nIn this manner they control the lighting or extinguishing.\r\n\r\n\"This group of barricades is strong, and will play an important part. I\r\nhad hoped at one moment that they would attack it while I was there. The\r\nbugle had approached, and then had gone away again. Jeanty Sarre tells\r\nme 'it will be for this evening.'\r\n\r\n\"His intention is to extinguish the gas in the Rue du Petit-Carreau and\r\nall the adjoining streets, and to leave only one jet lighted in the Rue\r\ndu Cadran. He has placed sentinels as far as the corner of the Rue Saint\r\nDenis; at that point there is an open side, without barricades, but\r\nlittle accessible to the troops, on account of the narrowness of the\r\nstreets, which they can only enter one by one. Thence little danger\r\nexists, an advantage of narrow streets; the troops are worth nothing\r\nunless massed together. The soldier does not like isolated action; in\r\nwar the feeling of elbow to elbow constitutes half the bravery. Jeanty\r\nSarre has a reactionary uncle with whom he is not on good terms, and who\r\nlives close by at No. 1, Rue du Petit-Carreau.--'What a fright we shall\r\ngive him presently!' said Jeanty Sarre to me, laughing. This morning\r\nJeanty Sarre has inspected the Montorgueil barricade. There was only one\r\nman on it, who was drunk, and who put the barrel of his gun against his\r\nbreast, saying, 'No thoroughfare.' Jeanty Sarre disarmed him.\r\n\r\n\"I go to the Rue Pagevin. There at the corner of the Place des Victoires\r\nthere is a well-constructed barricade. In the adjoining barricade in the\r\nRue Jean Jacques Rousseau, the troops this morning made no prisoners.\r\nThe soldiers had killed every one. There are corpses as far as the Place\r\ndes Victoires. The Pagevin barricade held its own. There are fifty men\r\nthere, well armed. I enter. 'Is all going on well?' 'Yes.' 'Courage.' I\r\npress all these brave hands; they make a report to me. They had seen a\r\nMunicipal Guard smash in the head of a dying man with the butt end of\r\nhis musket. A pretty young girl, wishing to go home, took refuge in the\r\nbarricade. There, terrified, she remained for an hour. When all danger\r\nwas over, the chef of the barricade caused her to be reconducted home by\r\nthe eldest of his men.\r\n\r\n\"As I was about to leave the barricade Pagevin, they brought me a\r\nprisoner, a police spy, they said.\r\n\r\n\"He expected to be shot. I had him set at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nBancel was in this barricade of the Rue Pagevin. We shook hands.\r\n\r\nHe asked me,--\r\n\r\n\"Shall we conquer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nWe then could hardly entertain a doubt.\r\n\r\nDe Flotte and Bancel wished to accompany me, fearing that I should be\r\narrested by the regiment guarding the Bank.\r\n\r\nThe weather was misty and cold, almost dark. This obscurity concealed\r\nand helped us. The fog was on our side.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the corner of the Rue de la Vrillière, a group on\r\nhorseback passed by.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a few others, preceded by a man who seemed a soldier,\r\nbut who was not in uniform. He wore a cloak with a hood.\r\n\r\nDe Flotte nudged me with his elbow, and whispered,--\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Fialin?\"\r\n\r\nI answered,--\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen him?\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at him.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him.\r\n\r\nThis man in truth was passing before us. It was he who preceded the\r\ngroup of officers. He came out of the Bank. Had he been there to effect\r\na new forced loan? The people who were at the doors looked at him with\r\ncuriosity, and without anger. His entire bearing was insolent. He turned\r\nfrom time to time to say a word to one of his followers. This little\r\ncavalcade \"pawed the ground\" in the mist and in the mud. Fialin had the\r\narrogant air of a man who caracoles before a crime. He gazed at the\r\npassers-by with a haughty look. His horse was very handsome, and, poor\r\nbeast, seemed very proud. Fialin was smiling. He had in his hand the\r\nwhip that his face deserved.\r\n\r\nHe passed by. I never saw the man except on this occasion.\r\n\r\nDe Flotte and Bancel did not leave me until they had seen me get into my\r\nvehicle. My true-hearted coachman was waiting for me in the Rue de la\r\nVrillière. He brought me back to No 15, Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARRICADE OF THE RUE MESLAY\r\n\r\nThe first barricade of the Rue Saint Martin was erected at the junction\r\nof the Rue Meslay. A large cart was overturned, placed across the\r\nstreet, and the roadway was unpaved; some flag-stones of the footway\r\nwere also torn up. This barricade, the advanced work of defence of the\r\nwhole revolted street, could only form a temporary obstacle. No portion\r\nof the piled-up stones was higher than a man. In a good third of the\r\nbarricade the stones did not reach above the knee. \"It will at all\r\nevents be good enough to get killed in,\" said a little street Arab who\r\nwas rolling numerous flag-stones to the barricade. A hundred combatants\r\ntook up their position behind it. Towards nine o'clock the movements of\r\nthe troops gave warning of the attack. The head of the column of the\r\nMarulaz Brigade occupied the corner of the street on the side of the\r\nboulevard. A piece of artillery, raking the whole of the street, was\r\nplaced in position before the Porte Saint Martin. For some time both\r\nsides gazed on each other in that moody silence which precedes an\r\nencounter; the troops regarding the barricade bristling with guns, the\r\nbarricade regarding the gaping cannon. After a while the order for a\r\ngeneral attack was given. The firing commenced. The first shot passed\r\nabove the barricade, and struck a woman who was passing some twenty\r\npaces in the rear, full in the breast. She fell, ripped open. The fire\r\nbecame brisk without doing much injury to the barricade. The cannon was\r\ntoo near; the bullets flew too high.\r\n\r\nThe combatants, who had not yet lost a man, received each bullet with a\r\ncry of \"Long live the Republic!\" but without firing. They possessed few\r\ncartridges, and they husbanded them. Suddenly the 49th regiment\r\nadvanced in close column order.\r\n\r\nThe barricade fired.\r\n\r\nThe smoke filled the street; when it cleared away, there could be seen\r\na dozen men on the ground, and the soldiers falling back in disorder by\r\nthe side of the houses. The leader of the barricade shouted, \"They are\r\nfalling back. Cease firing! Let us not waste a ball.\"\r\n\r\nThe street remained for some time deserted. The cannon recommenced\r\nfining. A shot came in every two minutes, but always badly aimed. A man\r\nwith a fowling-piece came up to the leader of the barricade, and said\r\nto him, \"Let us dismount that cannon. Let us kill the gunners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" said the chief, smiling, \"they are doing us no harm, let us do\r\nnone to them.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless the sound of the bugle could be distinctly heard on the\r\nother side of the block of houses which concealed the troops echelloned\r\non the Square of Saint Martin, and it was manifest that a second attack\r\nwas being prepared.\r\n\r\nThis attack would naturally be furious, desperate, and stubborn.\r\n\r\nIt was also evident that, if this barricade were carried, the entire\r\nstreet would be scoured. The other barricades were still weaker than\r\nthe first, and more feebly defended. The \"middle class\" had given their\r\nguns, and had re-entered their houses. They lent their street, that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore necessary to hold the advanced barricade as long as\r\npossible. But what was to be done, and how was the resistance to be\r\nmaintained? They had scarcely two shots per man left.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected source of supply arrived.\r\n\r\nA young man, I can name him, for he is dead--Pierre Tissié,[19] who was\r\na workman, and who also was a poet, had worked during a portion of the\r\nmorning at the barricades, and at the moment when the firing began he\r\nwent away, stating as his reason that they would not give him a gun. In\r\nthe barricade they had said, \"There is one who is afraid.\"\r\n\r\nPierre Tissié was not afraid, as we shall see later on.\r\n\r\nHe left the barricade.\r\n\r\nPierre Tissié had only his knife with him, a Catalan knife; he opened\r\nit at all hazards, he held it in his hand, and went on straight before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs he came out of the Rue Saint Sauveur, he saw at the corner of a\r\nlittle lonely street, in which all the windows were closed, a soldier\r\nof the line standing sentry, posted there doubtlessly by the main guard\r\nat a little distance.\r\n\r\nThis soldier was at the halt with his gun to his shoulder ready to\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nHe heard the step of Pierre Tissié, and cried out,--\r\n\r\n\"Who goes there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Death!\" answered Pierre Tissié.\r\n\r\nThe soldier fired, and missed Pierre Tissié, who sprang on him, and\r\nstruck him down with a blow of his knife.\r\n\r\nThe soldier fell, and blood spurted out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know I should speak so truly,\" muttered Pierre Tissié.\r\n\r\nAnd he added, \"Now for the ambulance!\"\r\n\r\nHe took the soldier on his back, picked up the gun which had fallen to\r\nthe ground, and came back to the barricade. \"I bring you a wounded\r\nman,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"A dead man,\" they exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn truth the soldier had just expired.\r\n\r\n\"Infamous Bonaparte!\" said Tissié. \"Poor red breeches! All the same, I\r\nhave got a gun.\"\r\n\r\nThey emptied the soldier's pouch and knapsack. They divided the\r\ncartridges. There were 150 of them. There were also two gold pieces of\r\nten francs, two days' pay since the 2d of December. These were thrown\r\non the ground, no one would take them.\r\n\r\nThey distributed the cartridges with shouts of \"Long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the attacking party had placed a mortar in position by the\r\nside of the cannon.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the cartridges was hardly ended when the infantry\r\nappeared, and charged upon the barricade with the bayonet. This second\r\nassault, as had been foreseen, was violent and desperate. It was\r\nrepulsed. Twice the soldiers returned to the charge, and twice they\r\nfell back, leaving the street strewn with dead. In the interval between\r\nthe assaults, a shell had pierced and dismantled the barricade, and the\r\ncannon began to fire grape-shot.\r\n\r\nThe situation was hopeless; the cartridges were exhausted. Some began\r\nto throw down their guns and go away. The only means of escape was by\r\nthe Rue Saint Sauveur, and to reach the corner of the Rue Saint Sauveur\r\nit was necessary to get over the lower part of the barricade, which\r\nleft nearly the whole of the fugitives unprotected. There was a perfect\r\nrain of musketry and grape-shot. Three or four were killed there, one,\r\nlike Baudin, by a ball in his eye. The leader of the barricade suddenly\r\nnoticed that he was alone with Pierre Tissié, and a boy of fourteen\r\nyears old, the same who had rolled so many stones for the barricade. A\r\nthird attack was pending, and the soldiers began to advance by the side\r\nof the houses.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go,\" said the leader of the barricade.\r\n\r\n\"I shall remain,\" said Pierre Tissié.\r\n\r\n\"And I also,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\nAnd the boy added,--\r\n\r\n\"I have neither father nor mother. As well this as anything else.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader fired his last shot, and retired like the others over the\r\nlower part of the barricade. A volley knocked off his hat. He stooped\r\ndown and picked it up again. The soldiers were not more than\r\ntwenty-five paces distant.\r\n\r\nHe shouted to the two who remained,--\r\n\r\n\"Come along!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Pierre Tissié.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\nA few moments afterwards the soldiers scaled the barricade already half\r\nin ruins.\r\n\r\nPierre Tissié and the boy were killed with bayonet thrusts.\r\n\r\nSome twenty muskets were abandoned in this barricade.\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] It must not be forgotten that this has been written in exile, and\r\nthat to name a hero was to condemn him to exile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARRICADE OF THE MAIRIE OF THE FIFTH ARRONDISSEMENT\r\n\r\nNational Guards in uniform filled the courtyard of the Mairie of the\r\nFifth Arrondissement. Others came in every moment. An ex-drummer of the\r\nGarde Mobile had taken a drum from a lower room at the side of the\r\nguard-room, and had beaten the call to arms in the surrounding streets.\r\nTowards nine o'clock a group of fourteen or fifteen young men, most of\r\nwhom were in white blouses, entered the Mairie, shouting, \"Long live\r\nthe Republic!\" They were armed with guns. The National Guard received\r\nthem with shouts of \"Down with Louis Bonaparte!\" They fraternized in\r\nthe courtyard. Suddenly there was a movement. It was caused by the\r\narrival of the Representatives Doutre and Pelletier.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Barricades,\" said Pelletier.\r\n\r\nThey unharnessed the horses, which the carter led away, and they turned\r\nthe cart round without upsetting it across the wide roadway of the\r\nfaubourg. The barricade was completed in a moment. A truck came up.\r\nThey took it and stood it against the wheels of the cart, just as a\r\nscreen is placed before a fireplace.\r\n\r\nThe remainder was made up of casks and paving-stones. Thanks to the\r\nflour-cart the barricade was lofty, and reached to the first story of\r\nthe houses. It intersected the faubourg at the corner of the little Rue\r\nSaint Jean. A narrow entrance had been contrived at the barricade at\r\nthe corner of the street.\r\n\r\n\"One barricade is not sufficient,\" said Doutre, \"we must place the\r\nMairie between two barriers, so as to be able to defend both sides at\r\nthe same time.\"\r\n\r\nThey constructed a second barricade, facing the summit of the faubourg.\r\nThis one was low and weakly built, being composed only of planks and of\r\npaving-stones. There was about a hundred paces distance between the two\r\nbarricades.\r\n\r\nThere were three hundred men in this space. Only one hundred had guns.\r\nThe majority had only one cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe firing began about ten o'clock. Two companies of the line appeared\r\nand fired several volleys. The attack was only a feint. The barricade\r\nreplied, and made the mistake of foolishly exhausting its ammunition.\r\nThe troops retired. Then the attack began in earnest. Some Chasseurs de\r\nVincennes emerged from the corner of the boulevard.\r\n\r\nFollowing out the African mode of warfare, they glided along the side\r\nof the walls, and then, with a run, they threw themselves upon the\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\nNo more ammunition in the barricade. No quarter to be expected.\r\n\r\nThose who had no more powder or balls threw down their guns. Some\r\nwished to reoccupy their position in the Mairie, but it was impossible\r\nfor them to maintain any defence there, the Mairie being open and\r\ncommanded from every side; they scaled the walls and scattered\r\nthemselves about in the neighboring houses; others escaped by the\r\nnarrow passage of the boulevard which led into the Rue Saint Jean; most\r\nof the combatants reached the opposite side of the boulevard, while\r\nthose who had a cartridge left fired a last volley upon the troops from\r\nthe height of the paving-stones. Then they awaited their death. All\r\nwere killed.\r\n\r\nOne of those who succeeded in slipping into the Rue Saint Jean, where\r\nmoreover they ran the gauntlet of a volley from their assailants, was\r\nM.H. Coste, Editor of the _Evénement_ and of the _Avénement du Peuple_.\r\n\r\nM. Coste had been a captain in the Garde Mobile. At a bend in the\r\nstreet, which placed him out of reach of the balls, M. Conte noticed in\r\nfront of him the drummer of the Garde Mobile, who, like him, had\r\nescaped by the Rue Saint Jean, and who was profiting by the loneliness\r\nof the street to get rid of his drum.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your drum,\" cried he to him.\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"To beat the call to arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Batignolles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will keep it,\" said the drummer.\r\n\r\nThese two men came out from the jaws of death, and at once consented to\r\nre-enter them.\r\n\r\nBut how should they cross all Paris with this drum? The first patrol\r\nwhich met them would shoot them. A porter of an adjoining house, who\r\nnoticed their predicament, gave them a packing-cloth. They enveloped\r\nthe drum in it, and reached Batignolles by the lonely streets which\r\nskirt the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARRICADE OF THE RUE THEVENOT\r\n\r\nGeorges Biscarrat was the man who had given the signal for the looting\r\nin the Rue de l'Echelle.\r\n\r\nI had known Georges Biscarrat ever since June, 1848. He had taken part\r\nin that disastrous insurrection. I had had an opportunity of being\r\nuseful to him. He had been captured, and was kneeling before the\r\nfiring-party; I interfered, and I saved his life, together with that of\r\nsome others, M., D., D., B., and that brave-hearted architect Rolland,\r\nwho when an exile, later on, so ably restored the Brussels Palace of\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\nThis took place on the 24th June, 1848, in the underground floor of No.\r\n93, Boulevard Beaumarchais, a house then in course of construction.\r\n\r\nGeorges Biscarrat became attached to me. It appeared that he was the\r\nnephew of one of the oldest and best friends of my childhood, Félix\r\nBiscarrat, who died in 1828. Georges Biscarrat came to see me from time\r\nto time, and on occasions he asked my advice or gave me information.\r\n\r\nWishing to preserve him from evil influences, I had given him, and he\r\nhad accepted, this guiding maxim, \"No insurrection except for Duty and\r\nfor Right.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was this hooting in the Rue de l'Echelle? Let us relate the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of December, Bonaparte had made an attempt to go out. He had\r\nventured to go and look at Paris. Paris does not like being looked at\r\nby certain eyes; it considers it an insult, and it resents an insult\r\nmore than a wound. It submits to assassination, but not to the leering\r\ngaze of the assassin. It took offence at Louis Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the morning, at the moment when the Courbevoie\r\ngarrison was descending upon Paris, the placards of the _coup d'état_\r\nbeing still fresh upon the walls, Louis Bonaparte had left the Elysée,\r\nhad crossed the Place de la Concorde, the Garden of the Tuileries, and\r\nthe railed courtyard of the Carrousel, and had been seen to go out, by\r\nthe gate of the Rue de l'Echelle. A crowd assembled at once. Louis\r\nBonaparte was in a general's uniform; his uncle, the ex-King Jérôme,\r\naccompanied him, together with Flahaut, who kept in the near. Jérôme\r\nwore the full uniform of a Marshal of France, with a hat with a white\r\nfeather; Louis Bonaparte's horse was a head before Jérôme's horse.\r\nLouis Bonaparte was gloomy, Jérôme attentive, Flahaut beaming. Flahaut\r\nhad his hat on one side. There was a strong escort of Lancers. Edgar\r\nNey followed. Bonaparte intended to go as far as the Hôtel de Ville.\r\nGeorges Biscarrat was there. The street was unpaved, the road was being\r\nmacadamized; he mounted on a heap of stones, and shouted, \"Down with\r\nthe Dictator! Down with the Praetorians!\" The soldiers looked at him\r\nwith bewilderment, and the crowd with astonishment. Georges Biscarrat\r\n(he told me so himself) felt that this cry was too erudite, and that it\r\nwould not be understood, so he shouted, \"Down with Bonaparte! Down with\r\nthe Lancers!\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this shout was electrical. \"Down with Bonaparte! Down\r\nwith the Lancers!\" cried the people, and the whole street became stormy\r\nand turbulent. \"Down with Bonaparte!\" The outcry resembled the\r\nbeginning of an execution; Bonaparte made a sudden movement to the\r\nright, turned back, and re-entered the courtyard of the Louvre.\r\n\r\nGeorges Biscarrat felt it necessary to complete his shout by a\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\nHe said to the bookseller, Benoist Mouilhe, who had just opened his\r\nshop, \"Shouting is good, action is better.\" He returned to his house in\r\nthe Rue du Vert Bois, put on a blouse and a workman's cap, and went\r\ndown into the dark streets. Before the end of the day he had made\r\narrangements with four associations--the gas-fitters, the last-makers,\r\nthe shawl-makers, and the hatters.\r\n\r\nIn this manner he spent the day of the 2d of December.\r\n\r\nThe day of the 3d was occupied in goings and comings \"almost useless.\"\r\nSo Biscarrat told Versigny, and he added, \"However I have succeeded in\r\nthis much, that the placards of the _coup d'état_ have been everywhere\r\ntorn down, so much so that in order to render the tearing down more\r\ndifficult the police have ultimately posted them in the public\r\nconveniences--their proper place.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 4th, early in the morning, Georges Biscarrat went to\r\nLedouble's restaurant, where four Representatives of the People usually\r\ntook their meals, Brives, Bertlhelon, Antoine Bard, and Viguier,\r\nnicknamed \"Father Viguier.\" All four were there. Viguier related what\r\nwe had done on the preceding evening, and shared my opinion that the\r\nclosing catastrophe should be hurried on, that the Crime should be\r\nprecipitated into the abyss which befitted it. Biscarrat came in. The\r\nRepresentatives did not know hire, and stared at him. \"Who are you?\"\r\nasked one of them. Before he could answer, Dr. Petit entered, unfolded\r\na paper, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Does any one know Victor Hugo's handwriting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Biscarrat. He looked at the paper. It was my proclamation\r\nto the army. \"This must be printed,\" said Petit. \"I will undertake it,\"\r\nsaid Biscarrat. Antoine Bard asked him, \"Do you know Victor Hugo?\" \"He\r\nsaved my life,\" answered Biscarrat. The Representatives shook hands\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nGuilgot arrived. Then Versigny. Versigny knew Biscarrat. He had seen\r\nhim at my house. Versigny said, \"Take care what you do. There is a man\r\noutside the door.\" \"It is a shawl-maker,\" said Biscarrat. \"He has come\r\nwith me. He is following me.\" \"But,\" resumed Versigny, \"he is wearing a\r\nblouse, beneath which he has a handkerchief. He seems to be hiding\r\nthis, and he has something in the handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sugar-plums,\" said Biscarrat.\r\n\r\nThey were cartridges.\r\n\r\nVersigny and Biscarrat went to the office of the _Siècle_; at the\r\n_Siècle_ thirty workmen, at the risk of being shot, offered to print my\r\nProclamation. Biscarrat left it with them, and said to Versigny, \"Now I\r\nwant my barricade.\"\r\n\r\nThe shawl-maker walked behind them. Versigny and Biscarrat turned their\r\nsteps towards the top of the Saint Denis quarter. When they drew near\r\nto she Porte Saint Denis they heard the hum of many voices. Biscarrat\r\nlaughed and said to Versigny, \"Saint Denis is growing angry, matters\r\nare improving.\" Biscarrat recruited forty combatants on the way,\r\namongst whom was Moulin, head of the association of leather-dressers.\r\nChapuis, sergeant-major of the National Guard, brought them four\r\nmuskets and ten swords. \"Do you know where there are any more?\" asked\r\nBiscarrat. \"Yes, at the Saint Sauveur Baths.\" They went there, and\r\nfound forty muskets. They gave them swords and cartridge-pouches.\r\nGentlemen well dressed, brought tin boxes containing powder and balls.\r\nWomen, brave and light-hearted, manufactured cartridges. At the first\r\ndoor adjoining the Rue du Hasard-Saint-Sauveur they requisitioned iron\r\nbars and hammers from a large courtyard belonging to a locksmith.\r\nHaving the arms, they had the men. They speedily numbered a hundred.\r\nThey began to tear up the pavements. It was half-past ten. \"Quick!\r\nquick!\" cried Georges Biscarrat, \"the barricade of my dreams!\" It was\r\nin the Rue Thévenot. The barrier was constructed high and formidable.\r\nTo abridge. At eleven o'clock Georges Biscarrat had completed his\r\nbarricade. At noon he was killed there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSSIAN AND SCIPIO\r\n\r\nArrests grew more numerous.\r\n\r\nTowards noon a Commissary of Police, named Boudrot, appeared at the\r\ndivan of the Rue Lepelletier. He was accompanied by the police agent\r\nDelahodde. Delahodde was that traitorous socialist writer, who, upon\r\nbeing unmasked, had passed from the Secret Police to the Public Police\r\nService. I knew him, and I record this incident. In 1832 he was a\r\nmaster in the school at which were my two sons, then boys, and he had\r\naddressed poetry to me. At the same time he was acting the spy upon me.\r\nThe Lepelletier divan was the place of meeting of a large number of\r\nRepublican journalists. Delahodde knew them all. A detachment of the\r\nRepublican Guard occupied the entrances to the café. Then ensued an\r\ninspection of all the ordinary customers, Delahodde walking first, with\r\nthe Commissary behind him. Two Municipal Guards followed them. From\r\ntime to time Delahodde looked round and said, \"Lay hold of this man.\"\r\nIn this manner some score of writers were arrested, among whom were\r\nHennett de Kesler.[20] On the preceding evening Kesler had been on the\r\nSaint Antoine barricade. Kesler said to Delahodde, \"You are a miserable\r\nwretch.\" \"And you are an ungrateful fellow,\" replied Delahodde; \"_I am\r\nsaving your life_.\" Curious words; for it is difficult to believe that\r\nDelahodde was in the secret of what was to happen on the fatal day of\r\nthe Fourth.\r\n\r\nAt the head-quarters of the Committee encouraging information was\r\nforwarded to us from every side. Testelin, the Representative of Lille,\r\nis not only a learned man, but a brave man. On the morning of the 3d he\r\nhad reached, shortly after me, the Saint Antoine barricade, where\r\nBaudin had just been killed. All was at an end in that direction.\r\nTestelin was accompanied by Charles Gambon, another dauntless man.[21]\r\nThe two Representatives wandered through the agitated and dark streets,\r\nlittle followed, in no way understood, seeking a ferment of insurgents,\r\nand only finding a swarming of the curious. Testelin, nevertheless,\r\nhaving come to the Committee, informed us of the following:--At the\r\ncorner of a street of the Faubourg Saint Antoine Gambon and himself had\r\nnoticed a crowd. They had gone up to it. This crowd was reading a bill\r\nplacarded on a wall. It was the Appeal to Arms signed \"Victor Hugo.\"\r\nTestelin asked Gambon, \"Have you a pencil?\" \"Yes,\" answered Gambon.\r\nTestelin took the pencil, went up to the placard, and wrote his name\r\nbeneath mine, then he gave the pencil to Gambon, who in turn wrote his\r\nname beneath that of Testelin. Upon this the crowd shouted, \"Bravo!\r\nthese are true-hearted men!\" \"Shout 'Long live the Republic!'\" cried\r\nTestelin. All shouted \"Long live the Republic!\" \"And from above, from\r\nthe open windows,\" added Gambon, \"women clapped their hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"The little hands of women applauding are a good sign,\" said Michel de\r\nBourges.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, and we cannot lay too much stress upon the fact, what\r\nthe Committee of Resistance wished was to prevent the shedding of blood\r\nas much as possible. To construct barricades, to let them be destroyed,\r\nand to reconstruct them at other points, to avoid the army, and to wear\r\nit out, to wage in Paris the war of the desert, always retreating,\r\nnever yielding, to take time for an ally, to add days to days; on the\r\none hand to give the people time to understand and to rise, on the\r\nother, to conquer the _coup d'état_ by the weariness of the army; such\r\nwas the plan discussed and adopted.\r\n\r\nThe order was accordingly given that the barricades should be but\r\nslightly defended.\r\n\r\nWe repeated in every possible form to the combatants,--\r\n\r\n\"Shed as little blood as possible! Spare the blood of the soldiers and\r\nhusband your own.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the struggle once begun, it became impossible in many\r\ninstances, during certain excited hours of fighting, to moderate their\r\nardor. Several barricades were obstinately defended, particularly those\r\nin the Rue Rambuteau, in the Rue Montorgueil, and in the Rue Neuve\r\nSaint Eustache.\r\n\r\nThese barricades were commanded by daring leaders.\r\n\r\nHere, for the sake of history, we will record a few of these brave men\r\nfighting outlines who appeared and disappeared in the smoke of the\r\ncombat. Radoux, an architect, Deluc, Mallarmet, Félix Bony, Luneau, an\r\nex-Captain of the Republican Guard, Camille Berru, editor of the\r\n_Avénement_, gay, warmhearted, and dauntless, and that young Eugène\r\nMillelot, who was destined to be condemned at Cayenne to receive 200\r\nlashes, and to expire at the twenty-third stroke, before the very eyes\r\nof his father and brother, proscribed and convicts like himself.\r\n\r\nThe barricade of the Rue Aumaire was amongst those which were not\r\ncarried without resistance. Although raised in haste, it was fairly\r\nconstructed. Fifteen or sixteen resolute men defended it; two were\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThe barricade was carried with the bayonet by a battalion of the 16th\r\nof the line. This battalion, hurled on the barricade at the double, was\r\nreceived by a brisk fusillade; several soldiers were wounded.\r\n\r\nThe first who fell in the soldiers' ranks was an officer. He was a\r\nyoung man of twenty-five, lieutenant of the first company, named Ossian\r\nDumas; two balls broke both of his legs as though by a single blow.\r\n\r\nAt that time there were in the army two brothers of the name of Dumas,\r\nOssian and Scipio. Scipio was the elder. They were near relatives of\r\nthe Representative, Madier de Montjau.\r\n\r\nThese two brothers belonged to a poor but honored family. The elder had\r\nbeen educated at the Polytechnic School, the other at the School of\r\nSaint Cyr.\r\n\r\nScipio was four years older than his brother. According to that\r\nsplendid and mysterious law of ascent, which the French Revolution has\r\ncreated, and which, so to speak, has placed a ladder in the centre of a\r\nsociety hitherto caste-bound and inaccessible, Scipio Dumas' family had\r\nimposed upon themselves the most severe privations in order to develop\r\nhis intellect and secure his future. His relations, with the touching\r\nheroism of the poor of the present era, denied themselves bread to\r\nafford him knowledge. In this manner he attained to the Polytechnic\r\nSchool, where he quickly became one of the best pupils.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded his studies, he was appointed an officer in the\r\nartillery, and sent to Metz. It then became his turn to help the boy\r\nwho had to mount after him. He held out his hand to his younger\r\nbrother. He economized the modest pay of an artillery lieutenant, and,\r\nthanks to him, Ossian became an officer like Scipio. While Scipio,\r\ndetained by duties belonging to his position, remained at Metz, Ossian\r\nwas incorporated in an infantry regiment, and went to Africa. There he\r\nsaw his first service.\r\n\r\nScipio and Ossian were Republicans. In October, 1851, the 16th of the\r\nline, in which Ossian was serving, was summoned to Paris. It was one of\r\nthe regiments chosen by the ill-omened hand of Louis Bonaparte, and on\r\nwhich the _coup d'état_ counted.\r\n\r\nThe 2d of December arrived.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Ossian Dumas obeyed, like nearly all his comrades, the order\r\nto take up arms; but every one round him could notice his gloomy\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nThe day of the 3d was spent in marches and counter-marches. On the 4th\r\nthe combat began. The 16th, which formed part of the Herbillon Brigade,\r\nwas told off to capture the barricades of the Rues Beaubourg,\r\nTrausnonain, and Aumaire. This battle-field was formidable; a perfect\r\nsquare of barricades had been raised there.\r\n\r\nIt was by the Rue Aumaire, and with the regiment of which Ossian formed\r\npart, that the military leaders resolved to begin action.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the regiment, with arms loaded, was about to march\r\nupon the Rue Aumaire, Ossian Dumas went up to his captain, a brave and\r\nveteran officer, with whom he was a favorite, and declared that he\r\nwould not march a step farther, that the deed of the 2d of December was\r\na crime, that Louis Bonaparte was a traitor, that it was for them,\r\nsoldiers, to maintain the oath which Bonaparte violated; and that, as\r\nfor himself, he would not lend his sword to the butchery of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nA halt was made. The signal of attack was awaited; the two officers,\r\nthe old captain and the young lieutenant, conversed in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you want to do?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Break my sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be taken to Vincennes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all the same to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly dismissed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no longer any time; you should have resigned yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is always time to avoid committing a crime.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain, as may be seen, was simply one of those professional\r\nheroes, grown old in the leather stock, who know of no country but the\r\nflag, and no other law but military discipline. Iron arms and wooden\r\nheads. They are neither citizens nor men. They only recognize honor in\r\nthe form of a general's epaulets. It is of no use talking to them of\r\npolitical duties, of obedience to the laws, of the Constitution. What\r\ndo they know about all this? What is a Constitution; what are the most\r\nholy laws, against three words which a corporal may murmur into the ear\r\nof a sentinel? Take a pair of scales, put in one side the Gospels, in\r\nthe other the official instructions; now weigh them. The corporal turns\r\nthe balance; the Deity kicks the beam.\r\n\r\nGod forms a portion of the order of the day of Saint Bartholomew. \"Kill\r\nall. He will recognized his own.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what the priests accept, and at times glorify.\r\n\r\nSaint Bartholomew has been blessed by the Pope and decorated with the\r\nCatholic medal.[22]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ossian Dumas appeared determined. The captain made a last\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\"You will ruin yourself,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I shall save my honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is precisely your honor that you are sacrificing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am going away?\"\r\n\r\n\"To go away is to desert.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to impress Ossian Dumas. The captain continued,--\r\n\r\n\"They are about to fight. In a few minutes the barricade will be\r\nattacked. Your comrades will fall, dead or wounded. You are a young\r\nofficer--you have not yet been much under fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" warmly interrupted Ossian Dumas, \"I shall not have\r\nfought against the Republic; they will not say I am a traitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but they will say that you are a coward.\"\r\n\r\nOssian made no reply.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards the command was given to attack.\r\n\r\nThe regiment started at the double. The barricade fired.\r\n\r\nOssian Dumas was the first who fell.\r\n\r\nHe had not been able to bear that word \"coward,\" and he had remained in\r\nhis place in the first rank.\r\n\r\nThey took him to the ambulance, and from thence to the hospital.\r\n\r\nLet us at once state the conclusion of this touching incident.\r\n\r\nBoth of his legs were broken. The doctors thought that it would be\r\nnecessary to amputate them both.\r\n\r\nGeneral Saint-Arnaud sent him the Cross of Honor.\r\n\r\nAs is known, Louis Bonaparte hastened to discharge his debt to his\r\npraetorian accomplices. After having massacred, the sword voted.\r\n\r\nThe combat was still smoking when the army was brought to the\r\nballot-box.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Paris voted \"Yes.\" It absolved itself.\r\n\r\nWith the rest of the army it was otherwise. Military honor was\r\nindignant, and roused the civic virtue. Notwithstanding the pressure\r\nwhich was exercised, although the regiments deposited their votes in\r\nthe shakos of their colonels, the army voted \"No\" in many districts of\r\nFrance and Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe Polytechnic School voted \"No\" in a body. Nearly everywhere the\r\nartillery, of which the Polytechnic School is the cradle, voted to the\r\nsame effect as the school.\r\n\r\nScipio Dumas, it may be remembered, was at Metz.\r\n\r\nBy some curious chance it happened that the feeling of the artillery,\r\nwhich everywhere else had pronounced against the _coup d'état_,\r\nhesitated at Metz, and seemed to lean towards Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nScipio Dumas, in presence of this indecision set an example. He voted\r\nin a loud voice, and with an open voting paper, \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThen he sent in his resignation. At the same time that the Minister at\r\nParis received the resignation of Scipio Dumas, Scipio Dumas at Metz,\r\nreceived his dismissal, signed by the Minister.\r\n\r\nAfter Scipio Dumas' vote, the same thought had come at the same time to\r\nboth the Government and to the officer, to the Government that the\r\nofficer was a dangerous man, and that they could no longer employ him,\r\nto the officer that the Government was an infamous one, and that he\r\nought no longer to serve it.\r\n\r\nThe resignation and the dismissal crossed on the way. By this word\r\n\"dismissal\" must be understood the withdrawal of employment.\r\n\r\nAccording to our existing military laws it is in this manner that they\r\nnow \"break\" an officer. Withdrawal of employment, that is to say, no\r\nmore service, no more pay; poverty.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with his dismissal, Scipio Dumas learnt the news of the\r\nattack on the barricade of the Rue Aumaire, and that his brother had\r\nboth his legs broken. In the fever of events he had been a week without\r\nnews of Ossian. Scipio had confined himself to writing to his brother\r\nto inform him of his vote and of his dismissal, and to induce him to do\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nHis brother wounded! His brother at the Val-de. Grâce! He left\r\nimmediately for Paris.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to the hospital. They took him to Ossian's bedside. The\r\npoor young fellow had had both his legs amputated on the preceding day.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Scipio, stunned, appeared at his bedside, Ossian\r\nheld in his hand the cross which General Saint-Arnaud had just sent\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe wounded man turned towards the aide-de-camp who had brought it, and\r\nsaid to him,--\r\n\r\n\"I will not have this cross. On my breast it would be stained with the\r\nblood of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd perceiving his brother, who had just entered, he held out the cross\r\nto him, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\"You take it. You have voted \"No,\" and you have broken your sword! It\r\nis you who have deserved it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] Died in exile in Guernsey. See the \"Pendant l'Exil,\" under the\r\nheading _Actes et Paroles_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[21] Died in exile at Termonde.\r\n\r\n[22] Pro Hugonotorum strage. Medal struck at Rome in 1572.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION PRESENTS ITSELF\r\n\r\nIt was one o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nBonaparte had again become gloomy.\r\n\r\nThe gleams of sunshine on such countenances as these last very short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHe had gone back to his private room, had seated himself before the\r\nfire, with his feet on the hobs, motionless, and no one any longer\r\napproached him except Roquet.\r\n\r\nWhat was he thinking of?\r\n\r\nThe twistings of the viper cannot be foreseen.\r\n\r\nWhat this man achieved on this infamous day I have told at length in\r\nanother book. See \"Napoleon the Little.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Roquet entered and informed him of what was going on.\r\nBonaparte listened in silence, deep in thought, marble in which a\r\ntorrent of lava boiled.\r\n\r\nHe received at the Elysée the same news that we received in the Rue\r\nRichelieu; bad for him, good for us. In one of the regiments which had\r\njust voted, there were 170 \"Noes:\" This regiment has since been\r\ndissolved, and scattered abroad in the African army.\r\n\r\nThey had counted on the 14th of the line which had fired on the people\r\nin February. The Colonel of the 14th of the line had refused to\r\nrecommence; he had just broken his sword.\r\n\r\nOur appeal had ended by being heard. Decidedly, as we have seen, Paris\r\nwas rising. The fall of Bonaparte seemed to be foreshadowed. Two\r\nRepresentatives, Fabvier and Crestin, met in the Rue Royale, and\r\nCrestin, pointing to the Palace of the Assembly, said to Fabvier, \"We\r\nshall be there to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy incident. Mazes became eccentric, the prison unbent\r\nitself; the interior experienced an undefinable reverberation from the\r\noutside. The warders, who the preceding evening had been insolent to\r\nthe Representatives when going for their exercise in the courtyard, now\r\nsaluted them to the ground. That very morning of Thursday, the 4th, the\r\ngovernor of the prison had paid a visit to the prisoners, and had said\r\nto them, \"It is not my fault.\" He brought them books and writing-paper,\r\na thing which up to that time he had refused. The Representative\r\nValentin was in solitary confinement; on the morning of the 4th his\r\nwarder suddenly became amiable, and offered to obtain for him news from\r\noutside, through his wife, who, he said, had been a servant in General\r\nLeflô's household. These were significant signs. When the jailer smiles\r\nit means that the jail is half opening.\r\n\r\nWe may add, what is not a contradiction, that at the same time the\r\ngarrison at Mazas was being increased. 1200 more men were marched in,\r\nin detachments of 100 men each, spacing out their arrivals in \"little\r\ndoses\" as an eye-witness remarked to us. Later on 400 men. 100 litres\r\nof brandy were distributed to them. One litre for every sixteen men.\r\nThe prisoners could hear the movement of artillery round the prison.\r\n\r\nThe agitation spread to the most peaceable quarters. But the centre of\r\nParis was above all threatening. The centre of Paris is a labyrinth of\r\nstreets which appears to be made for the labyrinth of riots. The Ligue,\r\nthe Fronde, the Revolution--we must unceasingly recall these useful\r\nfacts--the 14th of July, the 10th of August, 1792, 1830, 1848, have\r\ncome out from thence. These brave old streets were awakened. At eleven\r\no'clock in the morning from Notre Dame to the Porte Saint Martin there\r\nwere seventy-seven barricades. Three of them, one in the Rue Maubuée,\r\nanother in the Rue Bertin-Poirée, another in the Rue Guérin-Boisseau,\r\nattained the height of the second stories; the barricade of the Porte\r\nSaint Denis was almost as bristling and as formidable as the barrier of\r\nthe Faubourg Saint Antoine in June, 1848. The handful of the\r\nRepresentatives of the People had swooped down like a shower of sparks\r\non these famous and inflammable crossroads. The beginning of the fire.\r\nThe fire had caught. The old central market quarter, that city which is\r\ncontained in the city, shouted, \"Down with Bonaparte!\" They hooted the\r\npolice, they hissed the troops. Some regiments seemed stupefied. They\r\ncried, \"Throw up your butt ends in the air!\" From the windows above,\r\nwomen encouraged the construction of the barricades. There was powder\r\nthere, there were muskets. Now, we were no longer alone. We saw rising\r\nup in the gloom behind us the enormous head of the people. Hope at the\r\npresent time was on our side. The oscillation of uncertainty had at\r\nlength become steady, and we were, I repeat, almost perfectly\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nThere had been a moment when, owing to the good news pouring in upon\r\nus, this confidence had become so great that we who had staked our\r\nlives on this great contest, seized with an irresistible joy in the\r\npresence of a success becoming hourly more certain, had risen from our\r\nseats, and had embraced each other. Michel de Bourges was particularly\r\nangered against Bonaparte, for he had believed his word, and had even\r\ngone so far as to say, \"He is my man.\" Of the four of us, he was the\r\nmost indignant. A gloomy flash of victory shone in him. He struck the\r\ntable with his fist, and exclaimed, \"Oh! the miserable wretch!\r\nTo-morrow--\" and he struck the table a second time, \"to-morrow his\r\nhead shall fall in the Place de Grève before the Hôtel de Ville.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I, \"this man's head shall not fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said I, \"if after such a crime we allow Louis Bonaparte to\r\nlive we shall abolish the penalty of death.\"\r\n\r\nThis generous Michel de Bourges remained thoughtful for a moment, then\r\nhe pressed my hand.\r\n\r\nCrime is an opportunity, and always gives us a choice, and it is better\r\nto extract from it progress than punishment. Michel de Bourges realized\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMoreover this incident shows to what a pitch our hopes had been raised.\r\n\r\nAppearances were on our side, actual facts not so. Saint-Arnaud had his\r\norders. We shall see them.\r\n\r\nStrange incidents took place.\r\n\r\nTowards noon a general, deep in thought, was on horseback in the Place\r\nde la Madeleine, at the head of his wavering troops. He hesitated.\r\n\r\nA carriage stopped, a woman stepped out and conversed in a low tone\r\nwith the general. The crowd could see her. The Representative Raymond,\r\nwho lived at No 4, Place de la Madeleine, saw her from his window. This\r\nwoman was Madame K. The general stooping down on his horse, listened,\r\nand finally made the dejected gesture of a vanquished man. Madame K.\r\ngot back into her carriage. This man, they said, loved that woman. She\r\ncould, according to the side of her beauty which fascinated her victim,\r\ninspire either heroism or crime. This strange beauty was compounded of\r\nthe whiteness of an angel, combined with the look of a spectre.\r\n\r\nIt was the look which conquered.\r\n\r\nThis man no longer hesitated. He entered gloomily into the enterprise.\r\n\r\nFrom twelve to two o'clock there was in this enormous city given over\r\nto the unknown an indescribable and fierce expectation. All was calm\r\nand awe-striking. The regiments and the limbered batteries quitted the\r\nfaubourg and stationed themselves noiselessly around the boulevards.\r\nNot a cry in the ranks of the soldiery. An eye-witness said, \"The\r\nsoldiers march with quite a jaunty air.\" On the Quai de la Ferronnerie,\r\nheaped up with regiments ever since the morning of the 2d of December,\r\nthere now only remained a post of Municipal Guards. Everything ebbed\r\nback to the centre, the people as well as the army; the silence of the\r\narmy had ultimately spread to the people. They watched each other.\r\n\r\nEach soldier had three days' provisions and six packets of cartridges.\r\n\r\nIt has since transpired that at this moment 10,000 francs were daily\r\nspent in brandy for each brigade.\r\n\r\nTowards one o'clock, Magnan went to the Hôtel de Ville, had the reserve\r\nlimbered under his own eyes, and did not leave until all the batteries\r\nwere ready to march.\r\n\r\nCertain suspicious preparations grew more numerous. Towards noon the\r\nState workmen and the hospital corps had established a species of huge\r\nambulance at No. 2, Faubourg Montmartre. A great heap of litters was\r\npiled up there. \"What is all this for?\" asked the crowd.\r\n\r\nDr. Deville, who had attended Espinasse when he had been wounded,\r\nnoticed him on the boulevard, and asked him, \"Up to what point are you\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\nEspinasse's answer is historical.\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"To the end.\"\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock five brigades, those of Cotte, Bourgon, Canrobert, Dulac,\r\nand Reybell, five batteries of artillery, 16,400 men,[23] infantry and\r\ncavalry, lancers, cuirassiers, grenadiers, gunners, were echelloned\r\nwithout any ostensible reason between the Rue de la Paix and the Faubourg\r\nPoissonnière. Pieces of cannon were pointed at the entrance of every\r\nstreet; there were eleven in position on the Boulevard Poissonnière alone.\r\nThe foot soldiers had their guns to their shoulders, the officers their\r\nswords drawn. What did all this mean? It was a curious sight, well worth\r\nthe trouble of seeing, and on both sides of the pavements, on all the\r\nthresholds of the shops, from all the stories of the houses, an\r\nastonished, ironical, and confiding crowd looked on.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, nevertheless, this confidence diminished, and irony\r\ngave place to astonishment; astonishment changed to stupor. Those who\r\nhave passed through that extraordinary minute will not forget it. It\r\nwas evident that there was something underlying all this. But what?\r\nProfound obscurity. Can one imagine Paris in a cellar? People felt as\r\nthough they were beneath a low ceiling. They seemed to be walled up in\r\nthe unexpected and the unknown. They seemed to perceive some mysterious\r\nwill in the background. But after all they were strong; they were the\r\nRepublic, they were Paris; what was there to fear! Nothing. And they\r\ncried, \"Down with Bonaparte!\" The troops continued to keep silence, but\r\nthe swords remained outside their scabbards, and the lighted matches of\r\nthe cannon smoldered at the corners of the streets. The cloud grew\r\nblacker every minute, heavier and more silent. This thickening of the\r\ndarkness was tragical. One felt the coming crash of a catastrophe, and\r\nthe presence of a villain; snake-like treason writhed during this\r\nnight, and none can foresee where the downward slide of a terrible\r\ndesign will stop when events are on a steep incline.\r\n\r\nWhat was coming out of this thick darkness?\r\n\r\n\r\n[23] 16,410 men, the figures taken from the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRE\r\n\r\nSuddenly a window was opened.\r\n\r\nUpon Hell.\r\n\r\nDante, had he leaned over the summit of the shadow, would have been able\r\nto see the eighth circle of his poem; the funereal Boulevard Montmartre.\r\n\r\nParis, a prey to Bonaparte; a monstrous spectacle. The gloomy armed men\r\nmassed together on this boulevard felt an appalling spirit enter into\r\nthem; they ceased to be themselves, and became demons.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer a single French soldier, but a host of indefinable\r\nphantoms, carrying out a horrible task, as though in the glimmering\r\nlight of a vision.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer a flag, there was no longer law, there was no longer\r\nhumanity, there was no longer a country, there was no longer France;\r\nthey began to assassinate.\r\n\r\nThe Schinderhannes division, the brigades of Mandrin, Cartouche,\r\nPoulailler, Trestaillon, and Tropmann appeared in the gloom, shooting\r\ndown and massacring.\r\n\r\nNo; we do not attribute to the French army what took place during this\r\nmournful eclipse of honor.\r\n\r\nThere have been massacres in history, abominable ones assuredly, but\r\nthey have possessed some show of reason; Saint Bartholomew and the\r\nDragonnades are explained by religion, the Sicilian Vespers and the\r\nbutcheries of September are explained by patriotism; they crush the\r\nenemy or annihilate the foreigner; these are crimes for a good cause;\r\nbut the carnage of the Boulevard Montmartre is a crime without an\r\nostensible reason.\r\n\r\nThe reason exists, however. It is hideous.\r\n\r\nLet us give it.\r\n\r\nTwo things stand erect in a State, the Law and the People.\r\n\r\nA man murders the Law. He feels the punishment approaching, there only\r\nremains one thing for him to do, to murder the People. He murders the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\nThe Second of December was the Risk, the Fourth was the Certainty.\r\n\r\nAgainst the indignation which arose they opposed the Terror.\r\n\r\nThe Fury, Justice, halted petrified before the Fury, Extermination.\r\nAgainst Erinnyes they set up Medusa.\r\n\r\nTo put Nemesis to flight, what a terrifying triumph!\r\n\r\nTo Louis Napoleon pertains this glory, which is the summit of his shame.\r\n\r\nLet us narrate it.\r\n\r\nLet us narrate what History had never seen before.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of a people by a man.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at a given signal, a musket shot being fired, no matter where,\r\nno matter by whom, the shower of bullets poured upon the crowd. A shower\r\nof bullets is also a crowd; it is death scattered broadcast. It does not\r\nknow whither it goes, nor what it does; it kills and passes on.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time it has a species of soul; it is premeditated, it\r\nexecutes a will. This was an unprecedented moment. It seemed as though a\r\nhandful of lightnings was falling upon the people. Nothing simpler. It\r\nformed a clear solution to the difficulty; the rain of lead overwhelmed\r\nthe multitude. What are you doing there? Die! It is a crime to be\r\npassing by. Why are you in the street? Why do you cross the path of the\r\nGovernment? The Government is a cut-throat. They have announced a thing,\r\nthey must certainly carry it out; what is begun must assuredly be\r\nachieved; as Society is being saved, the People must assuredly be\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nAre there not social necessities? Is it not essential that Béville\r\nshould have 87,000 francs a year and Fleury 95,000 francs? Is it not\r\nessential that the High Chaplain, Menjaud, Bishop of Nancy, should have\r\n342 francs a day, and that Bassano and Cambacérès should each have 383\r\nfrancs a day, and Vaillant 468 francs, and Saint-Arnaud 822 francs? Is\r\nit not necessary that Louis Bonaparte should have 76,712 francs a day?\r\nCould one be Emperor for less?\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye there was a butchery on the boulevard a\r\nquarter of a league long. Eleven pieces of cannon wrecked the\r\nSallandrouze carpet warehouse. The shot tore completely through\r\ntwenty-eight houses. The baths of Jouvence were riddled. There was a\r\nmassacre at Tortoni's. A whole quarter of Paris was filled with an\r\nimmense flying mass, and with a terrible cry. Everywhere sudden death. A\r\nman is expecting nothing. He falls. From whence does this come? From\r\nabove, say the Bishops' _Te Deum_; from below, says Truth.\r\n\r\nFrom a lower place than the galleys, from a lower place than Hell.\r\n\r\nIt is the conception of a Caligula, carried out by a Papavoine.\r\n\r\nXavier Durrieu comes upon the boulevard. He states,--\r\n\r\n\"I have taken sixty steps, I have seen sixty corpses.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he draws back. To be in the street is a Crime, to be at home is a\r\nCrime. The butchers enter the houses and slaughter. In slaughter-house\r\nslang the soldiers cry, \"Let us pole-axe the lot of them.\"\r\n\r\nAdde, a bookseller, of 17, Boulevard Poissonnière, is standing before his\r\ndoor; they kill him. At the same moment, for the field of murder is vast,\r\nat a considerable distance from there, at 5, Rue de Lancry, M. Thirion de\r\nMontauban, owner of the house, is at his door; they kill him. In the Rue\r\nTiquetonne a child of seven years, named Boursier, is passing by; they\r\nkill him. Mdlle. Soulac, 196, Rue du Temple, opens her window; they kill\r\nher. At No. 97, in the same street, two women, Mesdames Vidal and\r\nRaboisson, sempstresses, are in their room; they kill them. Belval, a\r\ncabinet-maker, 10, Rue de la Lune, is at home; they kill him. Debaëcque,\r\na merchant, 45, Rue du Sentier, is in his own house; Couvercelle,\r\nflorist, 257, Rue Saint Denis, is in his own house; Labitte, a jeweller,\r\n55, Boulevard Saint Martin, is in his own house; Monpelas, perfumer, 181,\r\nRue Saint Martin, is in his own house; they kill Monpelas, Labitte,\r\nCouvercelle, and Debaëcque. They sabre at her own home, 240, Rue Saint\r\nMartin, a poor embroideress, Mdlle. Seguin, who not having sufficient\r\nmoney to pay for a doctor, died at the Beaujon hospital, on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1852, on the same day that the Sibour _Te Deum_ was chanted at\r\nNotre Dame. Another, a waistcoat-maker, Françoise Noël, was shot down at\r\n20, Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, and died in the Charité. Another, Madame\r\nLedaust, a working housekeeper, living at 76, Passage du Caire, was shot\r\ndown before the Archbishop's palace, and died at the Morgue. Passers-by,\r\nMdlle. Gressier, living at 209, Faubourg Saint Martin; Madame Guilard,\r\nliving at 77, Boulevard Saint Denis; Madame Gamier, living at 6,\r\nBoulevard Bonne Nouvelle, who had fallen, the first named beneath the\r\nvolleys on the Boulevard Montmartre, the two others on the Boulevard\r\nSaint Denis, and who were still alive, attempted to rise, and became\r\ntargets for the soldiers, bursting with laughter, and this time fell back\r\nagain dead. Deeds of gallantry ware performed. Colonel Rochefort, who was\r\nprobably created General for this, charged in the Rue do la Paix at the\r\nhead of his Lancers a flock of nurses, who were put to flight.\r\n\r\nSuch was this indescribable enterprise. All the men who took part in it\r\nwere instigated by hidden influences; all had something which urged them\r\nforward; Herbillon had Zaatcha behind him; Saint-Arnaud had Kabylia;\r\nRenault had the affair of the Saint-André and Saint Hippolyte villages;\r\nEspinasse, Rome and the storming of the 30th of June; Magnan, his debts.\r\n\r\nMust we continue? We hesitate. Dr. Piquet, a man of seventy, was killed\r\nin his drawing-room by a ball in his stomach; the painter Jollivart, by\r\na ball in the forehead, before his easel, his brains bespattered his\r\npainting. The English captain, William Jesse, narrowly escaped a ball\r\nwhich pierced the ceiling above his head; in the library adjoining the\r\nMagasins du Prophète, a father, mother, and two daughters were sabred.\r\nLefilleul, another bookseller, was shot in his shop on the Boulevard\r\nPoissonnière; in the Rue Lepelletier, Boyer, a chemist, seated at his\r\ncounter, was \"spitted\" by the Lancers. A captain, killing all before\r\nhim, took by storm the house of the Grand Balcon. A servant was killed\r\nin the shop of Brandus. Reybell through the volleys said to Sax, \"And I\r\nalso am discoursing sweet music.\" The Café Leblond was given over to\r\npillage. Billecoq's establishment was bombarded to such a degree that it\r\nhad to be pulled down the next day. Before Jouvain's house lay a heap of\r\ncorpses, amongst them an old man with his umbrella, and a young man with\r\nhis eye-glass. The Hôtel de Castille, the Maison Dorée, the Petite\r\nJeannette, the Café de Paris, the Café Anglais became for three hours\r\nthe targets of the cannonade. Raquenault's house crumbled beneath the\r\nshells; the bullets demolished the Montmartre Bazaar.\r\n\r\nNone escaped. The guns and pistols were fired at close quarters.\r\n\r\nNew Year's-day was not far off, some shops were full of New Year's\r\ngifts. In the passage du Saumon, a child of thirteen, flying before the\r\nplatoon-firing, hid himself in one of these shops, beneath a heap of\r\ntoys. He was captured and killed. Those who killed him laughingly\r\nwidened his wounds with their swords. A woman told me, \"The cries of the\r\npoor little fellow could be heard all through the passage.\" Four men\r\nwere shot before the same shop. The officer said to them, \"This will\r\nteach you to loaf about.\" A fifth named Mailleret, who was left for dead,\r\nwas carried the next day with eleven wounds to the Charité. There he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThey fired into the cellars by the air-holes.\r\n\r\nA workman, a currier, named Moulins, who had taken refuge in one of\r\nthese shot-riddled cellars, saw through the cellar air-hole a passer-by,\r\nwho had been wounded in the thigh by a bullet, sit down on the pavement\r\nwith the death rattle in his throat, and lean against a shop. Some\r\nsoldiers who heard this rattle ran up and finished off the wounded man\r\nwith bayonet thrusts.\r\n\r\nOne brigade killed the passer-by from the Madeleine to the Opera,\r\nanother from the Opera to the Gymmase; another from the Boulevard Bonne\r\nNouvelle to the Porte Saint Denis; the 75th of the line having carried\r\nthe barricade of the Porte Saint Denis, it was no longer a fight, it was\r\na slaughter. The massacre radiated--a word horribly true--from the\r\nboulevard into all the streets. It was a devil-fish stretching out its\r\nfeelers. Flight? Why? Concealment? To what purpose? Death ran after you\r\nquicker than you could fly. In the Rue Pagevin a soldier said to a\r\npasser-by, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I am going home.\" The soldier\r\nkills the passer-by. In the Rue des Marais they kill four young men in\r\ntheir own courtyard. Colonel Espinasse exclaimed, \"After the bayonet,\r\ncannon!\" Colonel Rochefort exclaimed, \"Thrust, bleed, slash!\" and he\r\nadded, \"It is an economy of powder and noise.\" Before Barbedienne's\r\nestablishment an officer was showing his gun, an arm of considerable\r\nprecision, admiringly to his comrades, and he said, \"With this gun I can\r\nscore magnificent shots between the eyes.\" having said this, he aimed at\r\nrandom at some one, and succeeded. The carnage was frenzied. While the\r\nbutchering under the orders of Carrelet filled the boulevard, the\r\nBourgon brigade devastated the Temple, the Marulaz brigade devastated\r\nthe Rue Rambuteau; the Renault division distinguished itself on the\r\n\"other side of the water.\" Renault was that general, who, at Mascara,\r\nhad given his pistols to Charras. In 1848 he had said to Charras,\r\n\"Europe must be revolutionized.\" And Charras had said, \"Not quite so\r\nfast!\" Louis Bonaparte had made him a General of Division in July, 1851.\r\nThe Rue aux Ours was especially devastated. Morny that evening said to\r\nLouis Bonaparte, \"The 15th Light Infantry have scored a success. They\r\nhave cleaned out the Rue aux Ours.\"\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Rue du Sentier an officer of Spahis, with his sword\r\nraised, cried out, \"This is not the sort of thing! You do not understand\r\nat all. Fire on the women.\" A woman was flying, she was with child, she\r\nfalls, they deliver her by the means of the butt-ends of their muskets.\r\nAnother, perfectly distracted, was turning the corner of a street. She\r\nwas carrying a child. Two soldiers aimed at her. One said, \"At the\r\nwoman!\" And he brought down the woman. The child rolled on the pavement.\r\nThe other soldier said, \"At the child!\" And he killed the child.\r\n\r\nA man of high scientific repute, Dr. Germain Sée, declares that in one\r\nhouse alone, the establishment of the Jouvence Baths, there were at six\r\no'clock, beneath a shed in the courtyard, about eighty wounded, nearly\r\nall of whom (seventy, at least) were old men, women, and children. Dr.\r\nSée was the first to attend to them.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue Mandar, there was, stated an eye-witness, \"a rosary of\r\ncorpses,\" reaching as far as the Rue Neuve Saint Eustache. Before the\r\nhouse of Odier twenty-six corpses. Thirty before the hotel Montmorency.\r\nFifty-two before the Variétés, of whom eleven were women. In the Rue\r\nGrange-Batelière there were three naked corpses. No. 19, Faubourg\r\nMontmartre, was full of dead and wounded.\r\n\r\nA woman, flying and maddened, with dishevelled hair and her arms raised\r\naloft, ran along the Rue Poissonnière, crying, \"They kill! they kill!\r\nthey kill! they kill! they kill!\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers wagered. \"Bet you I bring down that fellow there.\" In this\r\nmanner Count Poninsky was killed whilst going into his own house, 52,\r\nRue de la Paix.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to know what I ought to do. Certain treasons, in order to\r\nbe proved, need to be investigated. I went to the field of murder.\r\n\r\nIn such mental agony as this, from very excess of feeling one no longer\r\nthinks, or if one thinks, it is distractedly. One only longs for some\r\nend or other. The death of others instills in you so much horror that\r\nyour own death becomes an object of desire; that is to say, if by dying,\r\nyou would be in some degree useful! One calls to mind deaths which have\r\nput an end to angers and to revolts. One only retains this ambition, to\r\nbe a useful corpse.\r\n\r\nI walked along terribly thoughtful.\r\n\r\nI went towards the boulevards; I saw there a furnace; I heard there a\r\nthunderstorm.\r\n\r\nI saw Jules Simon coming up to me, who during these disastrous days\r\nbravely risked a precious life. He stopped me. \"Where are you going?\" he\r\nasked me. \"You will be killed. What do you want?\" \"That very thing,\"\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\nWe shook hands.\r\n\r\nI continued to go on.\r\n\r\nI reached the boulevard; the scene was indescribable. I witnessed this\r\ncrime, this butchery, this tragedy. I saw that reign of blind death, I\r\nsaw the distracted victims fall around me in crowds. It is for this that\r\nI have signed myself in this book AN EYE-WITNESS.\r\n\r\nDestiny entertains a purpose. It watches mysteriously over the future\r\nhistorian. It allows him to mingle with exterminations and carnages, but\r\nit does not permit him to die, because it wishes him to relate them.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this inexpressible Pandemonium, Xavier Durrieu met me as\r\nI was crossing the bullet-swept boulevard. He said to me, \"Ah, here you\r\nare. I have just met Madame D. She is looking for you.\" Madame D.[24]\r\nand Madame de la R.,[25] two noble and brave women, had promised Madame\r\nVictor Hugo, who was ill in bed, to ascertain where I was, and to give\r\nher some news of me. Madame D. had heroically ventured into this carnage.\r\nThe following incident happened to her. She stopped before a heap of\r\nbodies, and had had the courage to manifest her indignation; at the cry\r\nof horror to which she gave vent, a cavalry soldier had run up behind\r\nher with a pistol in his hand, and had it not been for a quickly opened\r\ndoor through which she threw herself, and which saved her, she would\r\nhave been killed.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the total slaughter in this butchery is\r\nunrecorded. Bonaparte has kept these figures hidden in darkness. Such is\r\nthe habit of those who commit massacres. They are scarcely likely to\r\nallow history to certify the number of the victims. These statistics are\r\nan obscure multitude which quickly lose themselves in the gloom. One of\r\nthe two colonels of whom we have had a glimpse in pages 223-225 of this\r\nwork, has stated that his regiment alone had killed \"at least 2,500\r\npersons.\" This would be more than one person per soldier. We believe\r\nthat this zealous colonel exaggerates. Crime sometimes boasts of its\r\nblackness.\r\n\r\nLireux, a writer, arrested in order to be shot, and who escaped by a\r\nmiracle, declares that he saw \"more than 800 corpses.\"\r\n\r\nTowards four o'clock the post-chaises which were in the courtyard of the\r\nElysée were unhorsed and put up.\r\n\r\nThis extermination, which an English witness, Captain William Jesse,\r\ncalls \"a wanton fusillade,\" lasted from two till five o'clock. During\r\nthese three terrible hours, Louis Bonaparte carried out what he had been\r\npremeditating, and completed his work. Up to that time the poor little\r\n\"middle-class\" conscience was almost indulgent. Well, what of it? It was\r\na game at Prince, a species of state swindling, a conjuring feat on a\r\nlarge scale; the sceptics and the knowing men said, \"It is a good joke\r\nplayed upon those idiots.\" Suddenly Louis Bonaparte grew uneasy and\r\nrevealed all his policy. \"Tell Saint-Arnaud to execute my orders.\"\r\nSaint-Arnaud obeyed, the _coup d'état_ acted according to its own code\r\nof laws, and from that appalling moment an immense torrent of blood\r\nbegan to flow across this crime.\r\n\r\nThey left the corpses lying on the pavements, wild-looking, livid,\r\nstupefied, with their pockets turned inside out. The military murderer\r\nis thus condemned to mount the villainous scale of guilt. In the morning\r\nan assassin, in the evening a thief.\r\n\r\nWhen night came enthusiasm and joy reigned at the Elysée. These men\r\ntriumphed. Conneau has ingeniously related the scene. The familiar\r\nspirits were delirious with joy. Fialin addressed Bonaparte in\r\nhail-fellow-well-met style. \"You had better break yourself of that,\"\r\nwhispered Vieillard. In truth this carnage made Bonaparte Emperor. He\r\nwas now \"His Majesty.\" They drank, they smoked like the soldiers on the\r\nboulevards; for having slaughtered throughout the day, they drank\r\nthroughout the night; wine flowed upon the blood. At the Elysée they\r\nwere amazed at the result. They were enraptured; they loudly expressed\r\ntheir admiration. \"What a capital idea the Prince had had! How well the\r\nthing had been managed! This was much better than flying the country, by\r\nDieppe, like D'Haussez; or by Membrolle, like Guernon-Ranville; or being\r\ncaptured, disguised as a footboy, and blacking the boots of Madame de\r\nSaint Fargeau, like poor Polignac!\" \"Guizot was no cleverer than\r\nPolignac,\" exclaimed Persigny. Fleury turned to Morny: \"Your theorists\r\nwould not have succeeded in a _coup d'état_.\" \"That is true, they were\r\nnot particularly vigorous,\" answered Morny. He added, \"And yet they were\r\nclever men,--Louis Philippe, Guizot, Thiers--\" Louis Bonaparte, taking\r\nhis cigarette from his lips, interrupted, \"If such are clever men, I\r\nwould rather be an ass--\"\r\n\r\n\"A hyena in an ass's skin,\" says History.\r\n\r\n\r\n[24] No. 20, Cité Rodier.\r\n\r\n[25] Rue Caumartin. See pages 142, 145-148.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT MADE WITH THE WORKMEN'S SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nWhat had become of our Committee during these tragic events, and what\r\nwas it doing? It is necessary to relate what took place.\r\n\r\nLet us go back a few hours.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this strange butchery began, the seat of the\r\nCommittee was still in the Rue Richelieu. I had gone back to it after\r\nthe exploration which I had thought it proper to make at several of the\r\nquarters in insurrection, and I gave an account of what I had seen to my\r\ncolleagues. Madier de Montjau, who also arrived from the barricades,\r\nadded to my report details of what he had seen. For some time we heard\r\nterrible explosions, which appeared to be close by, and which mingled\r\nthemselves with our conversation. Suddenly Versigny came in. He told us\r\nthat horrible events were taking place on the Boulevards; that the\r\nmeaning of the conflict could not yet be ascertained, but that they were\r\ncannonading, and firing volleys of musket-balls, and that the corpses\r\nbestrewed the pavement; that, according to all appearances, it was a\r\nmassacre,--a sort of Saint Bartholomew improvised by the coup d'état;\r\nthat they were ransacking the houses at a few steps from us, and that\r\nthey were killing every one. The murderers were going from door to door,\r\nand were drawing near. He urged us to leave Grévy's house without delay.\r\nIt was manifest that the Insurrectionary Committee would be a \"find\" for\r\nthe bayonets. We decided to leave, whereupon M. Dupont White, a man\r\ndistinguished for his noble character and his talent, offered us a\r\nrefuge at his house, 11, Rue Monthabor. We went out by the back-door of\r\nGrévy's house, which led into 1, Rue Fontaine Molière, but leisurely,\r\nand two by two, Madier de Montjau with Versigny, Michel de Bourges with\r\nCarnot, myself arm-in-arm with Jules Favre. Jules Favre, dauntless and\r\nsmiling as ever, wrapped a comforter over his mouth, and said, \"I do not\r\nmuch mind being shot, but I do mind catching cold.\"\r\n\r\nJules Favre and I reached the rear of Saint Roch, by the Rue des\r\nMoulins. The Rue Veuve Saint Roch was thronged with a mass of affrighted\r\npassers-by, who came from the Boulevards flying rather than walking. The\r\nmen were talking in a loud voice, the women screaming. We could hear the\r\ncannon and the ear-piercing rattle of the musketry. All the shops were\r\nbeing shut. M. de Falloux, arm-in-arm with M. Albert de Rességuier, was\r\nstriding down the Rue de Saint Roch and hurrying to the Rue Saint\r\nHonoré. The Rue Saint Honoré presented a scene of clamorous agitation.\r\nPeople were coming and going, stopping, questioning one another,\r\nrunning. The shopkeepers, at the threshold of their half-opened doors,\r\nasked the passers-by what was taking place, and were only answered by\r\nthis cry, \"Oh, my God!\" People came out of their houses bareheaded and\r\nmingled with the crowd. A fine rain was falling. Not a carriage in the\r\nstreet. At the corner of the Rue Saint Roch and Rue Saint Honoré we\r\nheard voices behind us saying, \"Victor Hugo is killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Jules Favre, continuing to smile, and pressing my arm.\r\n\r\nThey had said the same thing on the preceding day to Esquiros and to\r\nMadier de Montjau. And this rumor, so agreeable to the Reactionaries,\r\nhad even reached my two sons, prisoners in the Concièrgerie.\r\n\r\nThe stream of people driven back from the Boulevards and from the Rue\r\nRichelieu flowed towards the Rue de la Paix. We recognized there some of\r\nthe Representatives of the Right who had been arrested on the 2d, and\r\nwho were already released. M. Buffet, an ex-minister of M. Bonaparte,\r\naccompanied by numerous other members of the Assembly, was going towards\r\nthe Palais Royal. As he passed close by us he pronounced the name of\r\nLouis Bonaparte in a tone of execration.\r\n\r\nM. Buffet is a man of some importance; he is one of the three political\r\nadvisers of the Right; the two others are M. Fould and M. Molé.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue Monthabor, two steps from the Rue Saint Honoré, there was\r\nsilence and peace. Not one passer-by, not a door open, not a head out of\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nIn the apartment into which we were conducted, on the third story, the\r\ncalm was not less perfect. The windows looked upon an inner courtyard.\r\nFive or six red arm-chairs were drawn up before the fire; on the table\r\ncould be seen a few books which seemed to me works on political economy\r\nand executive law. The Representatives, who almost immediately joined us\r\nand who arrived in disorder, threw down at random their umbrellas and\r\ntheir coats streaming with water in the corner of this peaceful room. No\r\none knew exactly what was happening; every one brought forward his\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\nThe Committee was hardly seated in an adjoining little room when our\r\nex-colleague, Leblond, was announced. He brought with him King the\r\ndelegate of the working-men's societies. The delegate told us that the\r\ncommittee of the societies were sitting in permanent session, and had\r\nsent him to us. According to the instructions of the Insurrectionary\r\nCommittee, they had done what they could to lengthen the struggle by\r\nevading too decisive encounters. The greater part of the associations\r\nhad not yet given battle; nevertheless the plot was thickening. The\r\ncombat had been severe during the morning. The Association of the Rights\r\nof Man was in the streets; the ex-constituent Beslay had assembled, in\r\nthe Passage du Caire, six or seven hundred workmen from the Marais, and\r\nhad posted them in the streets surrounding the Bank. New barricades\r\nwould probably be constructed during the evening, the forward movement\r\nof the resistance was being precipitated, the hand-to-hand struggle\r\nwhich the Committee had wished to delay seemed imminent, all was rushing\r\nforward with a sort of irresistible impulse. Should we follow it, or\r\nshould we stop? Should we run the risk of bringing matters to an end\r\nwith one blow, which should be the last, and which would manifestly\r\nleave one adversary on the ground--either the Empire or the Republic?\r\nThe workmen's societies asked for our instructions; they still held in\r\nreserve their three or four thousand combatants; and they could,\r\naccording to the order which the Committee should give them, either\r\ncontinue to restrain them or send them under fire without delay. They\r\nbelieved themselves curtain of their adherents; they would do whatever\r\nwe should decide upon, while not hiding from us that the workmen wished\r\nfor an immediate conflict, and that it would be somewhat hazardous to\r\nleave them time to become calm.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the members of the Committee were still in favor of a\r\ncertain slackening of action which should tend to prolong the struggle;\r\nand it was difficult to say that they were in the wrong. It was certain\r\nthat if they could protract the situation in which the _coup d'état_ had\r\nthrown Paris until the next week, Louis Bonaparte was lost. Paris does\r\nnot allow herself to be trampled upon by an army for a whole week.\r\nNevertheless, I was for my own part impressed with the following:--The\r\nworkmen's societies offered us three or four thousand combatants, a\r\npowerful assistance;--the workman does not understand strategy, he lives\r\non enthusiasm, abatements of ardor discourage him; his zeal is not\r\nextinguished, but it cools:--three thousand to-day would be five hundred\r\nto-morrow. And then some serious incident had just taken place on the\r\nBoulevards. We were still ignorant of what it actually was: we could not\r\nforesee what consequences it might bring about; but seemed to me\r\nimpossible that the still unknown, but yet violent event, which had just\r\ntaken place would not modify the situation, and consequently change our\r\nplan of battle. I began to speak to this effect. I stated that we ought\r\nto accept the offer of the associations, and to throw them at once into\r\nthe struggle; I added that revolutionary warfare often necessitates\r\nsudden changes of tactics, that a general in the open country and before\r\nthe enemy operates as he wishes; it is all clear around him; he knows\r\nthe effective strength of his soldiers, the number of his regiments; so\r\nmany men, so many horses, so many cannons, he knows his strength, and\r\nthe strength of his enemy, he chooses his hour and his ground, he has a\r\nmap under his eyes, he sees what he is doing. He is sure of his\r\nreserves, he possesses them, he keeps them back, he utilizes them when\r\nhe wishes, he always has them by him. \"But for ourselves,\" cried I, \"we\r\nare in an undefined and inconceivable position. We are stepping at a\r\nventure upon unknown risks. Who is against us? We hardly know. Who is\r\nwith us? We are ignorant. How many soldiers? How many guns? How many\r\ncartridges? Nothing! but the darkness. Perhaps the entire people,\r\nperhaps no one. Keep a reserve! But who would answer for this reserve?\r\nIt is an army to-day, it will be a handful of dust to-morrow. We only\r\ncan plainly distinguish our duty, as regards all the rest it is black\r\ndarkness. We are guessing at everything. We are ignorant of everything.\r\nWe are fighting a blind battle! Let us strike all the blows that can be\r\nstruck, let us advance straight before us at random, let us rush upon\r\nthe danger! And let us have faith, for as we are Justice and the Law,\r\nGod must be with us in this obscurity. Let us accept this glorious and\r\ngloomy enterprise of Right disarmed yet still fighting.\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-constituent Leblond and the delegate King being consulted by the\r\nCommittee, seconded my advice. The Committee decided that the societies\r\nshould be requested in our name to come down into the streets\r\nimmediately, and to call out their forces. \"But we are keeping nothing\r\nfor to-morrow,\" objected a member of the Committee, \"what ally shall we\r\nhave to-morrow?\" \"Victory,\" said Jules Favre. Carnot and Michel de\r\nBourges remarked that it would be advisable for those members of the\r\nassociation who belonged to the National Guard to wear their uniforms.\r\nThis was accordingly settled.\r\n\r\nThe delegate King rose,--\"Citizen Representatives,\" said he, \"these\r\norders will be immediately transmitted, our friends are ready, in a few\r\nhours they will assemble. To-night barricades and the combat!\"\r\n\r\nI asked him, \"Would it be useful to you if a Representative, a member of\r\nthe Committee, were with you to-night with his sash girded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" resumed I, \"here I am! Take me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will all go,\" exclaimed Jules Favre.\r\n\r\nThe delegate observed that it would suffice for one of us to be there at\r\nthe moment when the societies should make their appearance, and that he\r\ncould then notify the other members of the Committee to come and join\r\nhim. It was settled that as soon as the places of meeting and the\r\nrallying-points should be agreed upon, he would send some one to let me\r\nknow, and to take me wherever the societies might be. \"Before an hour's\r\ntime you shall hear from me,\" said he on leaving us.\r\n\r\nAs the delegates were going away Mathieu de la Drôme arrived. On coming\r\nin he halted on the threshold of the door, he was pale, he cried out to\r\nus, \"You are no longer in Paris, you are no longer under the Republic;\r\nyou are in Naples and under King Bomba.\"\r\n\r\nHe had come from the boulevards.\r\n\r\nLater on I again saw Mathieu de la Drôme. I said to him, \"Worse than\r\nBomba,--Satan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VERIFICATION OF MORAL LAWS\r\n\r\nThe carnage of the Boulevard Montmartre constitutes the originality of\r\nthe _coup d'état_. Without this butchery the 2d of December would only\r\nbe an 18th Brumaire. Owing to the massacre Louis Bonaparte escapes the\r\ncharge of plagiarism.\r\n\r\nUp to that time he had only been an imitator. The little hat at Boulogne,\r\nthe gray overcoat, the tame eagle appeared grotesque. What did this parody\r\nmean? people asked. He made them laugh; suddenly he made\r\nthem tremble.\r\n\r\nHe who becomes detestable ceases to be ridiculous.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte was more than detestable, he was execrable.\r\n\r\nHe envied the hugeness of great crimes; he wished to equal the worst.\r\nThis striving after the horrible has given him a special place to\r\nhimself in the menagerie of tyrants. Petty rascality trying to emulate\r\ndeep villainy, a little Nero swelling himself to a huge Lacénaire; such\r\nis this phenomenon. Art for art, assassination for assassination.\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte has created a special genus.\r\n\r\nIt was in this manner that Louis Bonaparte made his entry into the\r\nUnexpected. This revealed him.\r\n\r\nCertain brains are abysses. Manifestly for a long time past Bonaparte\r\nhad harbored the design of assassinating in order to reign.\r\nPremeditation haunts criminals, and it is in this manner that treason\r\nbegins. The crime is a long time present in them, but shapeless and\r\nshadowy, they are scarcely conscious of it; souls only blacken\r\ngradually. Such abominable deeds are not invented in a moment; they do\r\nnot attain perfection at once and at a single bound; they increase and\r\nripen, shapeless and indecisive, and the centre of the ideas in which\r\nthey exist keeps them living, ready for the appointed day, and vaguely\r\nterrible. This design, the massacre for a throne, we feel sure, existed\r\nfor a long time in Louis Bonaparte's mind. It was classed among the\r\npossible events of this soul. It darted hither and thither like a\r\n_larva_ in an aquarium, mingled with shadows, with doubts, with desires,\r\nwith expedients, with dreams of one knows not what Caesarian socialism,\r\nlike a Hydra dimly visible in a transparency of chaos. Hardly was he\r\naware that he was fostering this hideous idea. When he needed it, he\r\nfound it, armed and ready to serve him. His unfathomable brain had\r\ndarkly nourished it. Abysses are the nurseries of monsters.\r\n\r\nUp to this formidable day of the 4th December, Louis Bonaparte did not\r\nperhaps quite know himself. Those who studied this curious Imperial\r\nanimal did not believe him capable of such pure and simple ferocity.\r\nThey saw in him an indescribable mongrel, applying the talents of a\r\nswindler to the dreams of an Empire, who, even when crowned, would be a\r\nthief, who would say of a parricide, What roguery! Incapable of gaining\r\na footing on any height, even of infamy, always remaining half-way\r\nuphill, a little above petty rascals, a little below great malefactors.\r\nThey believed him clever at effecting all that is done in gambling-hells\r\nand in robbers' caves, but with this transposition, that he would cheat\r\nin the caves, and that he would assassinate in the gambling-hells.\r\n\r\nThe massacre of the Boulevards suddenly unveiled this spirit. They saw it\r\nsuch as it really was: the ridiculous nicknames \"Big-beak,\" \"Badinguet,\"\r\nvanished; they saw the bandit, they saw the true _contraffatto_ hidden\r\nunder the false Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThere was a shudder! It was this then which this man held in reserve!\r\n\r\nApologies have been attempted, they could but fail. It is easy to praise\r\nBonaparte, for people have praised Dupin; but it is an exceedingly\r\ncomplicated operation to cleanse him. What is to be done with the 4th\r\nof December? How will that difficulty be surmounted? It is far more\r\ntroublesome to justify than to glorify; the sponge works with greater\r\ndifficulty than the censer; the panegyrists of the _coup d'état_ have\r\nlost their labor. Madame Sand herself, although a woman of lofty\r\nintellect, has failed miserably in her attempt to rehabilitate\r\nBonaparte, for the simple reason that whatever one may do, the\r\ndeath-roll reappears through this whitewashing.\r\n\r\nNo! no! no extenuation whatever is possible. Unfortunate Bonaparte. The\r\nblood is drawn. It must be drunk.\r\n\r\nThe deed of the 4th of December is the most colossal dagger-thrust that\r\na brigand let loose upon civilization has ever effected, we will not say\r\nupon a people, but upon the entire human race. The stroke was most\r\nmonstrous, and struck Paris to the ground. Paris on the ground is\r\nConscience, is Reason, is all human liberty on the ground; it is the\r\nprogress of centuries lying on the pavement; it is the torch of Justice,\r\nof Truth, and of Life reversed and extinguished. This is what Louis\r\nBonaparte effected the day when he effected this.\r\n\r\nThe success of the wretch was complete. The 2d of December was lost;\r\nthe 4th of December saved the 2d of December. It was something like\r\nErostratus saving Judas. Paris understood that all had not yet been told\r\nas regards deeds of horror, and that beneath the oppressor there was the\r\ngarbage-picker. It was the case of a swindler stealing César's mantle.\r\nThis man was little, it is true, but terrifying. Paris consented to this\r\nterror, renounced the right to have the last word, went to bed and\r\nsimulated death. Suffocation had its share in the matter. This crime\r\nresembled, too, no previous achievements. Even after centuries have\r\npassed, and though he should be an Aeschylus or a Tacitus, any one\r\nraising the cover would smell the stench. Paris resigned herself, Paris\r\nabdicated, Paris surrendered; the novelty of the treason proved its\r\nchief strength; Paris almost ceased to be Paris; on the next day the\r\nchattering of this terrified Titan's teeth could be heard in the\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nLet us lay a stress upon this, for we must verify the laws of morality.\r\nLouis Bonaparte remained, even after the 4th of December, Napoleon the\r\nLittle. This enormity still left him a dwarf. The size of the crime does\r\nnot change the stature of the criminal, and the pettiness of the\r\nassassin withstands the immensity of the assassination.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the Pigmy had the better of the Colossus. This\r\navowal, humiliating as it is, cannot be evaded.\r\n\r\nSuch are the blushes to which History, that greatly dishonored one, is\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH DAY--THE VICTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT--THE RUE TIQUETONNE\r\n\r\nJust as Mathieu de la Drôme had said, \"You are under King Bomba,\"\r\nCharles Gambon entered. He sank down upon a chair and muttered, \"It is\r\nhorrible.\" Bancel followed him. \"We have come from it,\" said Bancel.\r\nGambon had been able to shelter himself in the recess of a doorway. In\r\nfront of Barbedienne's alone he had counted thirty-seven corpses. What\r\nwas the meaning of it all? To what purpose was this monstrous\r\npromiscuous murder? No one could understand it. The Massacre was a\r\nriddle.\r\n\r\nWe were in the Sphinx's Grotto.\r\n\r\nLabrousse came in. It was urgently necessary that we should leave Dupont\r\nWhite's house. It was on the point of being surrounded. For some moments\r\nthe Rue Monthabor, ordinarily so deserted, was becoming thronged with\r\nsuspicious figures. Men seemed to be attentively watching number Eleven.\r\nSome of these men, who appeared to be acting in concert, belonged to the\r\nex-\"Club of Clubs,\" which, owing to the manoeuvres of the Reactionists,\r\nexhaled a vague odor of the police. It was necessary that we should\r\ndisperse. Labrousse said to us, \"I have just seen Longe-pied roving\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nWe separated. We went away one by one, and each in his own direction. We\r\ndid not know where we should meet again, or whether we should meet\r\nagain. What was going to happen and what was about to become of us all?\r\nNo one knew. We were filled with a terrible dread.\r\n\r\nI turned up towards the Boulevards, anxious to see what was taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhat was taking place I have just related.\r\n\r\nBancel and Versigny had rejoined me.\r\n\r\nAs I left the Boulevards, mingled with the whirl of the terrified crowd,\r\nnot knowing where I was going, returning towards the centre of Paris, a\r\nvoice suddenly whispered in my ear, \"There is something over there which\r\nyou ought to see.\" I recognized the voice. It was the voice of E.P.\r\n\r\nE.P. is a dramatic author, a man of talent, for whom under Louis\r\nPhilippe I had procured exemption from military service. I had not seen\r\nhim for four or five years. I met him again in this tumult. He spoke to\r\nme as though we had seen each other yesterday. Such are these times of\r\nbewilderment. There is no time to greet each other \"according to the\r\nrules of society.\" One speaks as though all were in full flight.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it is you!\" I exclaimed. \"What do you want with me?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered me, \"I live in a house over there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,-\r\n\r\n\"Come.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew me into a dark street. We could hear explosions. At the bottom\r\nof the street could be seen the ruins of a barricade. Versigny and\r\nBancel, as I have just said, were with me. E.P. turned to them.\r\n\r\n\"These gentlemen can come,\" said he.\r\n\r\nI asked him,--\r\n\r\n\"What street is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Rue Tiquetonne.\"\r\n\r\nWe followed him.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere told this tragical event.[26]\r\n\r\nE.P. stopped before a tall and gloomy house. He pushed open a\r\nstreet-door which was not shut, then another door and we entered into a\r\nparlor perfectly quiet and lighted by a lamp.\r\n\r\nThis room appeared to adjoin a shop. At the end could be distinguished\r\ntwo beds side by side, one large and one small. Above the little bed\r\nhung a woman's portrait, and above the portrait a branch of holy\r\nbox-tree.\r\n\r\nThe lamp was placed over the fireplace, where a little fire was burning.\r\n\r\nNear the lamp upon a chair there was an old woman leaning forward,\r\nstooping down, folded in two as though broken, over something which was\r\nin the shadow, and which she held in her arms. I drew near. That which\r\nshe held in her arms was a dead child.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was silently sobbing.\r\n\r\nE.P., who belonged to the house, touched her on the shoulder, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"Let us see it.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised her head, and I saw on her knees a little boy, pale,\r\nhalf-undressed, pretty, with two red holes in his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe old woman stared at me, but she evidently did not see me, she\r\nmuttered, speaking to herself,--\r\n\r\n\"And to think that he called me 'Granny' this morning!\"\r\n\r\nE.P. took the child's hand, the hand fell back again.\r\n\r\n\"Seven years old,\" he said to me.\r\n\r\nA basin was on the ground. They had washed the child's face; two tiny\r\nstreams of blood trickled from the two holes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the room, near a half-opened clothes-press, in which could\r\nbe seen some linen, stood a woman of some forty years, grave, poor, clean,\r\nfairly good-looking.\r\n\r\n\"A neighbor,\" E.P. said to me.\r\n\r\nHe explained to me that a doctor lived in the house, that the doctor had\r\ncome down and had said, \"There is nothing to be done.\" The child had\r\nbeen hit by two balls in the head while crossing the street to \"get out\r\nof the way.\" They had brought him back to his grandmother, who \"had no\r\none left but him.\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait of the dead mother hung above the little bed.\r\n\r\nThe child had his eyes half open, and that inexpressible gaze of the\r\ndead, where the perception of the real is replaced by the vision of the\r\ninfinite. The grandmother spoke through her sobs by snatches: \"God! is\r\nit possible? Who would have thought it?--What brigands!\"\r\n\r\nShe cried out,--\r\n\r\n\"Is this then the Government?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said to her.\r\n\r\nWe finished undressing the child. He had a top in his pocket. His head\r\nrolled from one shoulder to the other; I held him and I kissed him on\r\nthe brow; Versigny and Bancel took off his stockings. The grandmother\r\nsuddenly started up.\r\n\r\n\"Do not hurt him!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nShe took the two little white and frozen feet in her old hands, trying\r\nto warm them.\r\n\r\nWhen the poor little body was naked, they began to lay it out. They took\r\na sheet from the clothes-press.\r\n\r\nThen the grandmother burst into bitter lamentation.\r\n\r\nShe cried out,--\r\n\r\n\"They shall give him back to me!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up and gazed at us, and began to pour forth incoherent\r\nutterances, in which were mingled Bonaparte, and God, and her little\r\none, and the school to which he went, and her daughter whom she had\r\nlost, and even reproaches to us. She was livid, haggard, as though\r\nseeing a vision before her, and was more of a phantom than the dead\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThen she again buried her face in her hands, placed her folded arms on\r\nher child, and once more began to sob.\r\n\r\nThe woman who was there came up to me, and without saying a word, wiped\r\nmy mouth with a handkerchief. I had blood upon my lips.\r\n\r\nWhat could be done? Alas! We went out overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark. Bancel and Versigny left me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] \"Les Châtiments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT--THE MARKET QUARTER\r\n\r\nI came back to my lodging, 19, Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\nThe massacre seemed to be at an end; the fusillades were heard no\r\nlonger. As I was about to knock at the door I hesitated for a moment; a\r\nman was there who seemed to be waiting. I went straight up to this man,\r\nand I said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be waiting for somebody?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"For whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"For you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added, lowering his voice, \"I have come to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at this man. A street-lamp shone on him. He did not avoid the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nHe was a young man with a fair beard, wearing a blue blouse, and who had\r\nthe gentle bearing of a thinker and the robust hands of a workman.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe answered,--\"I belong to the Society of the Last-makers. I know you\r\nvery well, Citizen Victor Hugo.\"\r\n\r\n\"From whom do you come?\" I resumed.\r\n\r\nHe answered still in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n\"From Citizen King.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe then told me his name. As he has survived the events of the night of\r\nthe 4th, and as he since escaped the denunciations, it can be understood\r\nthat we will not mention his name here, and that we shall confine\r\nourselves to terming him throughout the course of this story by his\r\ntrade, calling him the \"last-maker.\"[27]\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to say to me?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe explained that matters were not hopeless, that he and his friends\r\nmeant to continue the resistance, that the meeting-places of the\r\nSocieties had not yet been settled, but that they would be during the\r\nevening, that my presence was desired, and that if I would be under the\r\nColbert Arcade at nine o'clock, either himself or another of their men\r\nwould be there, and would serve me as guide. We decided that in order to\r\nmake himself known, the messenger, when accosting me, should give the\r\npassword, \"What is Joseph doing?\"\r\n\r\nI do not know whether he thought he noticed any doubt or mistrust on my\r\npart. He suddenly interrupted himself, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"After all, you are not bound to believe me. One does not think of\r\neverything: I ought to have asked them to give me a word in writing. At\r\na time like this one distrusts everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" I said to him, \"one trusts everybody. I will be in\r\nthe Colbert Arcade at nine o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I left him.\r\n\r\nI re-entered my asylum. I was tired, I was hungry, I had recourse to\r\nCharamaule's chocolate and to a small piece of bread which I had still\r\nleft. I sank down into an arm-chair, I ate and I slept. Some slumbers\r\nare gloomy. I had one of those slumbers, full of spectres; I again saw\r\nthe dead child and the two red holes in his forehead, these formed two\r\nmouths: one said \"Morny,\" and the other \"Saint-Arnaud.\" History is not\r\nmade, however, to recount dreams. I will abridge. Suddenly I awoke. I\r\nstarted: \"If only it is not past nine o'clock!\" I had forgotten to wind\r\nup my watch. It had stopped. I went out hastily. The street was lonely,\r\nthe shops were shut. In the Place Louvos I heard the hour striking\r\n(probably from Saint Roch); I listened. I counted nine strokes. In a few\r\nmoments I was under the Colbert Arcade. I peered into the darkness. No\r\none was under the Arcade.\r\n\r\nI felt that it was impossible to remain there, and have the appearance\r\nof waiting about; near the Colbert Arcade there is a police-station, and\r\nthe patrols were passing every moment. I plunged into the street. I\r\nfound no one there. I went as far as the Rue Vivienne. At the corner of\r\nthe Rue Vivienne a man was stopping before a placard and was trying to\r\ndeface it or to tear it down. I drew near this man, who probably took me\r\nfor a police agent, and who fled at the top of his speed. I retraced my\r\nsteps. Near the Colbert Arcade, and just as I reached the point in the\r\nstreet where they post the theatrical bills, a workman passed me, and\r\nsaid quickly, \"What is Joseph doing?\"\r\n\r\nI recognized the last-maker.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he said to me.\r\n\r\nWe set out without speaking and without appearing to know each other, he\r\nwalking some steps before me.\r\n\r\nWe first went to two addresses, which I cannot mention here without\r\npointing out victims for the proscription. In these two houses we got no\r\nnews; no one had come there on the part of the societies.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go to the third place,\" said the last-maker, and he explained to\r\nme that they had settled among them three successive meeting-places, in\r\ncase of need, so as to be always sure of finding each other if,\r\nperchance, the police discovered the first or even the second\r\nmeeting-place, a precaution which for our part we adopted as much as\r\npossible with regard to our meetings of the Left end of the Committee.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the market quarter. Fighting had been going on there\r\nthroughout the day. There were no longer any gas-lamps in the streets.\r\nWe stopped from time to time, and listened so as not to run headlong\r\ninto the arms of a patrol. We got over a paling of planks almost\r\ncompletely destroyed, and of which barricades had probably been made,\r\nand we crossed the extensive area of half-demolished houses which at\r\nthat epoch encumbered the lower portions of the Rue Montmartre and Rue\r\nMontorgueil. On the peaks of the high dismantled gables could be seen a\r\nflickering red glow, doubtless the reflection of the bivouac-fires of the\r\nsoldiers encamped in the markets and in the neighborhood of Saint\r\nEustache. This reflection lighted our way. The last-maker, however,\r\nnarrowly escaped falling into a deep hole, which was no less than the\r\ncellar of a demolished house. On coming out of this region, covered with\r\nruins, amongst which here and there a few trees might be perceived, the\r\nremains of gardens which had now disappeared, we entered into narrow,\r\nwinding, and completely dark streets, where it was impossible to\r\nrecognize one's whereabouts. Nevertheless the last-maker walked on as\r\nmuch at his ease as in broad daylight, and like a man who is going\r\nstraight to his destination. Once he turned round to me, and said to\r\nme,--\r\n\r\n\"The whole of this quarter is barricaded; and if, as I hope, our friends\r\ncome down, I will answer that they will hold it for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped. \"Here is one,\" said he. In truth, seven or eight\r\npaces before us was a barricade entirely constructed of paving-stones,\r\nnot exceeding a man's height, and which in the darkness appeared like a\r\nruined wall. A narrow passage had been formed at one end. We passed\r\nthrough it. There was no one behind the barricade.\r\n\r\n\"There has already been fighting here a short time ago,\" said the\r\nlast-maker in a low voice; and he added, after a pause, \"We are getting\r\nnear.\"\r\n\r\nThe unpaving had left holes, of which we had to be careful. We strode,\r\nand sometimes jumped, from paving-stone to paving-stone. Notwithstanding\r\nthe intense darkness, there yet hovered about an indefinable glimmer; on\r\nour way we noticed before us on the ground, close to the foot-pavement,\r\nsomething which looked like a stretched-out form. \"The devil!\" muttered\r\nmy guide, \"we were just going to walk upon it.\" He took a little wax\r\nmatch from his pocket and struck it on his sleeve; the flame flashed\r\nout. The light fell upon a pallid face, which looked at us with fixed\r\neyes. It was a corpse lying there; it was an old man. The last-maker\r\nrapidly waved the match from his head to his feet. The dead man was\r\nalmost in the attitude of a crucified man; his two arms were stretched\r\nout; his white hair, red at the ends, was soaking in the mud; a pool of\r\nblood was beneath him; a large blackish patch on his waistcoat marked\r\nthe place where the ball had pierced his breast; one of his braces was\r\nundone; he had thick laced boots on his feet. The last-maker lifted up\r\none of his arms, and said, \"His collar-bone is broken.\" The movement\r\nshook the head, and the open mouth turned towards us as though about to\r\nspeak to us. I gazed at this vision; I almost listened. Suddenly it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThis face re-entered the gloom; the match had just gone out.\r\n\r\nWe went away in silence. After walking about twenty paces, the\r\nlast-maker, as though talking to himself, said in a whisper, \"Don't know\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nWe still pushed forward. From the cellars to the roofs, from the\r\nground-floors to the garrets, there was not a light in the house. We\r\nappeared to be groping in an immense tomb.\r\n\r\nA man's voice, firm and sonorous, suddenly issued out of the darkness,\r\nand shouted to us, \"Who goes there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there they are!\" said the last-maker, and he uttered a peculiar\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" resumed the voice.\r\n\r\nIt was another barricade. This one, a little higher than the first, and\r\nseparated from it by a distance of about a hundred paces, was, as far as\r\ncould be seen, constructed of barrels filled with paving-stones. On the\r\ntop could be seen the wheels of a truck entangled between the barrels;\r\nplanks and beams were intermingled. A passage had been contrived still\r\nnarrower than the gangway of the other barricade.\r\n\r\n\"Citizens,\" said the last-maker, as he went into the barricade, \"how\r\nmany of you are there here?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice which had shouted, \"Who goes there?\" answered,--\r\n\r\n\"There are two of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all.\"\r\n\r\nThey were in truth two,--two men who alone during that night, in that\r\nsolitary street, behind that heap of paving-stones, awaited the\r\nonslaught of a regiment.\r\n\r\nBoth wore blouses; they were two workmen; with a few cartridges in their\r\npockets, and a musket upon each of their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"So then,\" resumed the last-maker, in an impatient tone, \"our friends\r\nhave not yet come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" I said to him, \"let us wait for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe last-maker spoke for a short time in a low tone, and probably told\r\nmy name to one of the two defenders of the barricade, who came up to me\r\nand saluted me. \"Citizen Representative,\" said he, \"it will be very warm\r\nhere shortly.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime,\" answered I laughingly, \"it is cold.\"\r\n\r\nIt was very cold, in truth. The street which was completely unpaved\r\nbehind the barricade, was nothing better than a sewer, ankle deep in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"I say that it will be warm,\" resumed the workman, \"and that you would\r\ndo well to go farther off.\"\r\n\r\nThe last-maker put his hand on his shoulder: \"Comrade, it is necessary\r\nthat we should remain here. The meeting-place is close by, in the\r\nambulance.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" resumed the other workman, who was very short, and who\r\nstood up on a paving-stone; \"the Citizen Representative would do well to\r\ngo farther off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can very well be where you are,\" said I to him.\r\n\r\nThe street was quite dark, nothing could be seen of the sky. Inside the\r\nbarricade on the left, on the side where the passage was, could be seen\r\na high paling of badly joined planks, through which shone in places a\r\nfeeble light. Above the paling rose out, lost in the darkness, a house\r\nof six or seven storys; the ground floor, which was being repaired, and\r\nwhich was under-pinned, being closed in by these planks. A ray of light\r\nissuing from between the planks fell on the opposite wall, and lighted\r\nup an old torn placard, on which could be read, \"Asnières. Water\r\ntournaments. Grand ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you another gun?\" asked the last-maker of the taller of the two\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n\"If we had three guns we should be three men,\" answered the workman.\r\n\r\nThe little one added, \"Do you think that the good will is wanting? There\r\nare plenty of musicians, but there are no clarionets.\"\r\n\r\nBy the side of the wooden paling could be seen a little, narrow and low\r\ndoor, which looked more like the door of a stall than the door of a\r\nshop. The shop to which this door belonged was hermetically sealed. The\r\ndoor seemed to be equally closed. The last-maker went up to it and\r\npushed it gently. It was open.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go in,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI went in first, he followed me, and shut the door behind me. We were in\r\na room on the ground floor. At the end, on the left, a half-opened door\r\nemitted the reflection of a light. The room was only lighted by this\r\nreflection. A counter and a species of stove, painted in black and\r\nwhite, could be dimly distinguished.\r\n\r\nA short, half-suffocated, intermittent gurgling could be heard, which\r\nseemed to come from an adjoining room on the same side as the light. The\r\nlast-maker walked quickly to the half-opened door. I crossed the room\r\nafter him, and we found ourselves in a sort of vast shed, lighted by one\r\ncandle. We were on the other side of the plank paling. There was only\r\nthe plank paling between ourselves and the barricade.\r\n\r\nThis species of shed was the ground floor in course of demolition. Iron\r\ncolumns, painted red, and fixed into stone sockets at short distances\r\napart, supported the joists of the ceiling; facing the street, a huge\r\nframework standing erect, and denoting the centre of the surrounding\r\npaling, supported the great cross-beam of the first story, that is to\r\nsay, supported the whole house. In a corner were lying some masons'\r\ntools, a heap of rubbish, and a large double ladder. A few straw-bottomed\r\nchairs were scattered here and there. The damp ground served for the\r\nflooring. By the side of a table, on which stood a candle in the midst\r\nof medicine bottles, an old woman and a young girl of about eight years\r\nold--the woman seated, the child squatting before a great basketful of\r\nold linen--were making lint. The end of the room, which was lost in the\r\ndarkness, was carpeted with a litter of straw, on which three mattresses\r\nhad been thrown. The gurgling noise came from there.\r\n\r\n\"It is the ambulance,\" said the last-maker.\r\n\r\nThe old woman turned her head, and seeing us, shuddered convulsively,\r\nand then, reassured probably by the blouse of the last-maker, she got up\r\nand came towards us.\r\n\r\nThe last-maker whispered a few words in her ear. She answered, \"I have\r\nseen nobody.\"\r\n\r\nThen she added, \"But what makes me uneasy is that my husband has not yet\r\ncome back. They have done nothing but fire muskets the whole evening.\"\r\n\r\nTwo men were lying on two of the mattresses at the end of the room. A\r\nthird mattress was unoccupied and was waiting.\r\n\r\nThe wounded man nearest to me had received a musket ball in his stomach.\r\nHe it was who was gurgling. The old woman came towards the mattress with\r\na candle, and whispered to us, showing us her fist, \"If you could only\r\nsee the hole that that has made! We have stuffed lint as large as this\r\ninto his stomach.\"\r\n\r\nShe resumed, \"He is not above twenty-five years old. He will be dead\r\nto-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe other was still younger. He was hardly eighteen. \"He has a handsome\r\nblack overcoat,\" said the woman. \"He is most likely a student.\" The\r\nyoung man had the whole of the lower part of his face swathed in\r\nblood-stained linen. She explained to us that he had received a ball in\r\nthe mouth, which had broken his jaw. He was in a high fever, and gazed\r\nat us with lustrous eyes. From time to time he stretched his right arm\r\ntowards a basin full of water in which a sponge was soaking; he took the\r\nsponge, carried it to his face, and himself moistened his bandages.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that his gaze fastened upon me in a singular manner. I\r\nwent up to him, I stooped down, and I gave him my hand, which he took in\r\nhis own. \"Do you know me?\" I asked him. He answered \"Yes,\" by a pressure\r\nof the hand which went to my heart.\r\n\r\nThe last-maker said to me, \"Wait a minute for me here, I shall be back\r\ndirectly; I want to see in this neighborhood, if there is any means of\r\ngetting a gun.\"\r\n\r\nHe added,--\r\n\r\n\"Would you like one for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered I. \"I shall remain here without a gun. I only take a half\r\nshare in the civil war; I am willing to die, I am not willing to kill.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him if he thought his friends were going to come. He declared\r\nthat he could not understand it, that the men from the societies ought\r\nto have arrived already, that instead of two men in the barricade there\r\nshould be twenty, that instead of two barricades in the street there\r\nshould have been ten, and that something must have happened; he added,--\r\n\r\n\"However, I will go and see; promise to wait for me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you,\" I answered, \"I will wait all night if necessary.\"\r\n\r\nHe left me.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had reseated herself near the little girl, who did not\r\nseem to understand much of what was passing round her, and who from time\r\nto time raised great calm eyes towards me. Both were poorly clad, and it\r\nseemed to me that the child had stockingless feet. \"My man has not yet\r\ncome back,\" said the old woman, \"my poor man has not yet come back. I\r\nhope nothing has happened to him!\" With many heart-rending \"My God's,\"\r\nand all the while quickly picking her lint, she wept. I could not help\r\nthinking with anguish of the old man we had seen stretched on the\r\npavement at a few paces distant.\r\n\r\nA newspaper was lying on the table. I took it up, and I unfolded it. It\r\nwas the _P----_, the rest of the title had been torn off. A\r\nblood-stained hand was plainly imprinted on it. A wounded man on\r\nentering had probably placed his hand on the table on the spot where the\r\nnewspaper lay. My eyes fell upon these lines:--\r\n\r\n\"M. Victor Hugo has just published an appeal to pillage and\r\nassassination.\"\r\n\r\nIn these terms the journal of the Elysée described the proclamation\r\nwhich I had dictated to Baudin, and which may be read in page 103 of\r\nthis History.\r\n\r\nAs I threw back the paper on the table one of the two defenders of the\r\nbarricade entered. It was the short man.\r\n\r\n\"A glass of water,\" said he. By the side of the medicine bottles there\r\nwas a decanter and a glass. He drank, greedily. He held in his hand a\r\nmorsel of bread and a sausage, which he was biting.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard several successive explosions, following one after\r\nanother, and which seemed but a short distance off. In the silence of\r\nthis dark night it resembled the sound of a load of wood being shot on\r\nto the pavement.\r\n\r\nThe calm and serious voice of the other combatant shouted from outside,\r\n\"It is beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I time to finish my bread?\" asked the little one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the other.\r\n\r\nThe little one then turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Representative,\" said he to me, \"those are volleys. They are\r\nattacking the barricades over there. Really you must go away.\"\r\n\r\nI answered him, \"But you yourselves are going to stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for us, we are armed,\" resumed he; \"as for you, you are not. You\r\nwill only get yourself killed without benefiting any one. If you had a\r\ngun, I should say nothing. But you have not. You must go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" I answered him. \"I am waiting for some one.\"\r\n\r\nHe wished to continue and to urge me. I pressed his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Let me do as I like,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe understood that my duty was to remain, and no longer persisted.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. He again began to bite his bread. The gurgling of the\r\ndying man alone was audible. At that moment a sort of deep and hollow\r\nbooming reached us. The old woman started from her chair, muttering, \"It\r\nis the cannon!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the little man, \"it is the slamming of a street-door.\" Then\r\nhe resumed, \"There now! I have finished my bread,\" and he dusted one\r\nhand against the other, and went out.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the explosions continued, and seemed to come nearer. A\r\nnoise sounded in the shop. It was the last-maker who was coming back. He\r\nappeared on the threshold of the ambulance. He was pale.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am,\" said he, \"I have come to fetch you. We must go home. Let us\r\nbe off at once.\"\r\n\r\nI arose from the chair where I had seated myself. \"What does this mean?\r\nWill they not come?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"no one will come. All is at an end.\"\r\n\r\nThen he hastily explained that he had gone through the whole of the\r\nquarter in order to find a gun, that it was labor lost, that he had\r\nspoken to \"two or three,\" that we must abandon all hope of the\r\nsocieties, _that they would not come down_, that what had been done\r\nduring the day had appalled every one, that the best men were terrified,\r\nthat the boulevards were \"full of corpses,\" that the soldiers had\r\ncommitted \"horrors,\" that the barricade was about to be attacked, that\r\non his arrival he had heard the noise of footsteps in the direction of\r\nthe crossway, that it was the soldiers who were advancing, that we could\r\ndo nothing further there, that we must be off, that this house was\r\n\"stupidly chosen,\" that there was no outlet in the rear, that perhaps we\r\nshould already find it difficult to get out of the street, and that we\r\nhad only just time.\r\n\r\nHe told this all panting, briefly, jerkily, and interrupted at every\r\nmoment with this ejaculation, \"And to think that they have no arms, and\r\nto think that I have no gun!\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished we heard from the barricade a shout of \"Attention!\" and\r\nalmost immediately a shot was fired.\r\n\r\nA violent discharge replied to this shot.\r\n\r\nSeveral balls struck the paling of the ambulance, but they were too\r\nobliquely aimed, and none pierced it. We heard the glass of several\r\nbroken windows falling noisily into the street.\r\n\r\n\"There is no longer time,\" said the last-maker calmly; \"the barricade is\r\nattacked.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a chair and sat down. The two workmen were evidently excellent\r\nmarksmen. Two volleys assailed the barricade, one after the other. The\r\nbarricade answered with animation. Then the fire ceased. There was a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\"Now they are coming at us with the bayonet! They are coming at the\r\ndouble!\" said a voice in the barricade.\r\n\r\nThe other voice said, \"Let us be off.\" A last musket-shot was fired.\r\nThen a violent blow which we interpreted as a warning shook our wooden\r\nwall. It was in reality one of the workmen who had thrown down his gun\r\nwhen going away; the gun in falling had struck the paling of the\r\nambulance. We heard the rapid steps of the two combatants, as they ran\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment a tumult of voices, and of butt ends of\r\nmuskets striking the paving-stones, filled the barricade.\r\n\r\n\"It is taken,\" said the last-maker, and he blew out the candle.\r\n\r\nTo the silence which enveloped this street a moment before succeeded a\r\nsort of ill-omened tumult. The soldiers knocked at the doors of the\r\nhouses with the butt-ends of their muskets. It was by a miracle that the\r\nshop-door escaped them. If they had merely pushed against it, they would\r\nhave seen that it was not shut, and would have entered.\r\n\r\nA voice, probably the voice of an officer, cried out, \"Light up the\r\nwindows!\" The soldiers swore. We heard them say, \"Where are those\r\nblackguard Reds? Let us search the houses.\" The ambulance was plunged in\r\ndarkness. Not a word was spoken, not a breath could be heard; even the\r\ndying man, as though he divined the danger, had ceased to gurgle. I felt\r\nthe little girl pressing herself against my legs.\r\n\r\nA soldier struck the barrels, and said laughingly,--\r\n\r\n\"Here is something to make a fire with to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnother resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"Which way have they gone? They were at least thirty. Let us search the\r\nhouses.\"\r\n\r\nWe heard one raising objections to this,--\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! What do you want to do on a night like this? Enter the houses\r\nof the 'middle classes' indeed! There is some waste ground over yonder.\r\nThey have taken refuge there.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" repeated the others, \"let us search the houses.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a musket-shot was fired from the end of the street.\r\n\r\nThis shot saved us.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was probably one of the two workmen who had fired in order\r\nto draw off their attention from us.\r\n\r\n\"That comes from over there,\" cried the soldiers, \"They are over there!\"\r\nand all starting off at once in the direction from which the shot had\r\nbeen fired, they left the barricade and ran down the street at the top\r\nof their speed.\r\n\r\nThe last-maker and myself got up.\r\n\r\n\"They are no longer there,\" whispered he. \"Quick! let us be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this poor woman,\" said I. \"Are we going to leave her here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"do not be afraid, I have nothing to fear; as for me, I\r\nam an ambulance. I am taking care of the wounded. I shall even relight\r\nmy candle when you are gone. What troubles me is that my poor husband\r\nhas not yet come back!\"\r\n\r\nWe crossed the shop on tiptoe. The last-maker gently opened the door and\r\nglanced out into the street. Some inhabitants had obeyed the order to\r\nlight up their windows, and four or five lighted candles here and there\r\nflickered in the wind upon the sills of the windows. The street was no\r\nlonger completely dark.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one about now,\" said the last-maker; \"but let us make\r\nhaste, for they will probably come back.\"\r\n\r\nWe went out: the old woman closed the door behind us, and we found\r\nourselves in the street. We got over the barricade and hurried away as\r\nquickly as possible. We passed by the dead old man. He was still there,\r\nlying on the pavement indistinctly revealed by the flickering glimmer\r\nfrom the windows; he looked as though he was sleeping. As we reached the\r\nsecond barricade we heard behind us the soldiers, who were returning.\r\n\r\nWe succeeded in regaining the streets in course of demolition. There we\r\nwere in safety. The sound of musketry still reached us. The last-maker\r\nsaid, \"They are fighting in the direction of the Rue de Cléry.\" Leaving\r\nthe streets in course of demolition, we went round the markets, not\r\nwithout risk of falling into the hands of the patrols, by a number of\r\nzigzags, and from one little street to another little street. We reached\r\nthe Rue Saint Honoré.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre Sec the last-maker and I separated,\r\n\"For in truth,\" said he to me, \"two run more danger than one.\" And I\r\nregained No. 19, Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\nWhile crossing the rue des Bourdonnais we had noticed the bivouac of the\r\nPlace Saint Eustache. The troops who had been dispatched for the attack\r\nhad not yet come back. Only a few companies were guarding it. We could\r\nhear shouts of laughter. The soldiers were warming themselves at large\r\nfires lighted here and there. In the fire which was nearest to us we\r\ncould distinguish in the middle of the brazier the wheels of the\r\nvehicles which had served for the barricades. Of some there only\r\nremained a great hoop of red-hot iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] We may now, after twenty-six years, give the name of this loyal\r\nand courageous man. His name was Galoy (and not Galloix, as certain\r\nhistorians of the _coup d'état_ have printed it while recounting, after\r\ntheir fashion, the incidents which we are about to read).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT.--THE PETIT CARREAU\r\n\r\nOn the same night, almost at the same moment, at a few paces distant, a\r\nvillainous deed was being perpetrated.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of the barricade, where Pierre Tissié was killed,\r\nseventy or eighty combatants had retired in good order by the Rue Saint\r\nSauveur. They had reached the Rue Montorgueil, and had rejoined each\r\nother at the junction of the Rue du Petit Carreau and the Rue du Cadran.\r\nAt this point the street rises. At the corner of the Rue du Petit\r\nCarreau and the Rue de Cléry there was a deserted barricade, fairly high\r\nand well built. There had been fighting there during the morning. The\r\nsoldiers had taken it, but had not demolished it. Why? As we have said,\r\nthere were several riddles of this nature during this day.\r\n\r\nThe armed band which came from the Rue Saint Denis had halted there and\r\nhad waited. These men were astonished at not being pursued. Had the\r\nsoldiers feared to follow them into the little narrow streets, where\r\neach corner of the houses might conceal an ambuscade? Had a counter\r\norder been given? They hazarded various conjectures. Moreover they heard\r\nclose by, evidently on the boulevard, a terrific noise of musketry, and\r\na cannonade which resembled continuous thunder. Having no more\r\nammunition, they were reduced to listen. If they had known what was\r\ntaking place there, they would have understood why they were not\r\npursued. The butchery of the boulevard was beginning. The generals\r\nemployed in the massacre had suspended fighting for awhile.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives of the boulevard streamed in their direction, but when\r\nthey perceived the barricade they turned back. Some, however, joined\r\nthem indignant, and crying out for vengeance. One who lived in the\r\nneighborhood ran home and brought back a little tin barrel full of\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nThese were sufficient for an hour's fighting. They began to construct a\r\nbarricade at the corner of the Rue du Cadran. In this manner the Rue du\r\nPetit Carreau, closed by two barricades, one towards the Rue de Cléry,\r\nthe other at the corner of the Rue du Cadran, commanded the whole of the\r\nRue Montorgueil. The space between these two barricades formed a perfect\r\ncitadel. The second barricade was stronger than the first.\r\n\r\nThese men nearly all wore coats. Some of them rolled the paving-stones\r\nwith gloves on.\r\n\r\nFew workmen were amongst them, but those who were there were intelligent\r\nand energetic. These workmen were what might be termed the \"pick of the\r\ncrowd.\"\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre had rejoined them; he at once became their leader.\r\n\r\nCharpentier accompanied him, too brave to abandon the enterprise, but\r\ntoo much a dreamer to become a commander.\r\n\r\nTwo barricades, enclosing in the same manner some forty yards of the Rue\r\nMontorgueil, had just been constructed at the top of the Rue Mauconseil.\r\n\r\nThree other barricades, extremely feebly constructed, again intersected\r\nthe Rue Montorgueil in the space which separates the Rue Mauconseil from\r\nSaint Eustache.\r\n\r\nEvening was closing in. The fusillade was ceasing upon the boulevard. A\r\nsurprise was possible. They established a sentry-post at the corner of\r\nthe Rue du Cadran, and sent a main-guard in the direction of the Rue\r\nMontmartre. Their scouts came in to report some items of information. A\r\nregiment seemed to be preparing to bivouac in the Place des Victoires.\r\n\r\nTheir position, to all appearance strong, was not so in reality. There\r\nwere too few in number to defend at the same time the two barricades on\r\nthe Rue de Cléry and the Rue Montorgueil, and the soldiers arriving in\r\nthe rear hidden by the second barricade would have been upon them\r\nwithout being even noticed. This determined them to establish a post in\r\nthe Rue de Cléry. They put themselves in communication with the\r\nbarricades of the Rue du Cadran and with the two Mauconseil barricades.\r\nThese two last barricades were only separated from them by a space of\r\nabout 150 paces. They were about six feet high, fairly solid, but only\r\nguarded by six workmen who had built them.\r\n\r\nTowards half-past four, in the twilight--the twilight begins early in\r\nDecember--Jeanty Sarre took four men with him and went out to\r\nreconnoitre. He thought also of raising an advanced barricade in one of\r\nthe little neighboring streets. On the way they found one which had been\r\nabandoned, and which had been built with barrels. The barrels, however,\r\nwere empty, only one contained any paving-stones, and the barricade\r\ncould not have been held for two minutes. As they left this barricade\r\nthey were assailed by a sharp discharge of musketry. A company of\r\ninfantry, hardly visible in the dusk, was close upon them.\r\n\r\nThey fell back hastily; but one of them, who was a shoemaker of the\r\nFaubourg du Temple, was hit, and had remained on the pavement. They went\r\nback and brought him away. He had the thumb of the right hand smashed.\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Jeanty Sarre, \"they have not killed him.\" \"No,\" said\r\nthe poor man, \"it is my bread which they have killed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added, \"I can no longer work; who will maintain my children?\"\r\n\r\nThey went back, carrying the wounded man. One of them, a medical\r\nstudent, bound up his wound.\r\n\r\nThe sentries, whom it was necessary to post in every direction, and who\r\nwere chosen from the most trustworthy men, thinned and exhausted the\r\nlittle central land. There were scarcely thirty in the barricade itself.\r\n\r\nThere, as in the Quarter of the Temple, all the streetlamps were\r\nextinguished; the gas-pipes cut; the windows closed and unlighted; no\r\nmoon, not even stars. The night was profoundly dark.\r\n\r\nThey could hear distant fusillades. The soldiers were firing from around\r\nSaint Eustache, and every three minutes sent a ball in their direction,\r\nas much as to say, \"We are here.\" Nevertheless they did not expect an\r\nattack before the morning.\r\n\r\nDialogues like the following took place amongst them:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had a truss of straw,\" said Charpentier; \"I have a notion that\r\nwe shall sleep here to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be able to get to sleep?\" asked Jeanty Sarre.\r\n\r\n\"I? Certainly I shall go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nHe did go to sleep, in fact, a few moments later.\r\n\r\nIn this gloomy network of narrow streets, intersected with barricades,\r\nand blockaded by soldiers, two wine-shops had remained open. They made\r\nmore lint there, however, than they drank wine; the orders of the chiefs\r\nwere only to drink reddened water.\r\n\r\nThe doorway of one of these wine-shops opened exactly between the two\r\nbarricades of the Petit Cancan. In it was a clock by which they\r\nregulated the sentries' relief. In a back room they had locked up two\r\nsuspicious-looking persons who had intermingled with the combatants. One\r\nof these men at the moment when he was arrested said, \"I have come to\r\nfight for Henri V.\" They kept them under lock and key, and placed a\r\nsentry at the door.\r\n\r\nAn ambulance had been established in an adjoining room. There the\r\nwounded shoemaker was lying upon a mattress thrown upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThey had established, in case of need, another ambulance in the Rue du\r\nCadran. An opening had been effected at the corner of the barricade on\r\nthis side, so that the wounded could be easily carried away.\r\n\r\nTowards half-past nine in the evening a man came up to the barricade.\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre recognized him.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Denis,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Call me, Gaston,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you your brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am my brother. For to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Good-day, Gaston.\"\r\n\r\nThey heartily shook hands.\r\n\r\nIt was Denis Dussoubs.\r\n\r\nHe was pale, calm, and bleeding; he had already been fighting during the\r\nmorning. At the barricade of the Faubourg Saint Martin a ball had grazed\r\nhis breast, but had been turned off by some money in his pocket, and had\r\nonly broken the skin. He had had the rare good fortune of being\r\nscratched by a ball. It was like the first touch from the claws of\r\ndeath. He wore a cap, his hat having been left behind in the barricade\r\nwhere he had fought: and he had replaced his bullet-pierced overcoat,\r\nwhich was made of Belleisle cloth, by a pea-jacket bought at a\r\nslop-shop.\r\n\r\nHow had he reached the barricade of the Petit Carreau? He could not say.\r\nHe had walked straight before him. He had glided from street to street.\r\nChance takes the predestined by the hand, and leads them straight to\r\ntheir goal through the thick darkness.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he entered the barricade they cried out to him, \"Who\r\ngoes there?\" He answered, \"The Republic!\"\r\n\r\nThey saw Jeanty Sarre shake him by the hand. They asked Jeanty Sarre,--\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre answered,--\r\n\r\n\"It is some one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n\"We were only sixty a short time since. We are a hundred now.\"\r\n\r\nAll pressed round the new-comer. Jeanty Sarre offered him the command.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, \"I do not understand the tactics of barricade fighting. I\r\nshould be a bad chief, but I am a good soldier. Give me a gun.\"\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves on the paving-stones. They exchanged their\r\nexperiences of what had been done. Denis described to them the fighting\r\non the Faubourg Saint Martin. Jeanty Sarre told Denis of the fighting in\r\nthe Rue Saint Denis.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the generals were preparing a final assault,--what\r\nthe Marquis of Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called the \"Coup de Collier,\"\r\nand what, in 1789, the Prince of Lambese had called the \"Coup de Bas.\"\r\nThroughout all Paris there was now only this point which offered any\r\nresistance. This knot of barricade, this labyrinth of streets, embattled\r\nlike a redoubt, was the last citadel of the People and of Right. The\r\ngenerals invested it leisurely, step by step, and on all sides. They\r\nconcentrated their forces. They, the combatants of this fateful hour,\r\nknew nothing of what was being done. Only from time to time they\r\ninterrupted their recital of events and they listened. From the right\r\nand from the left, from the front, from the rear, from every side, at\r\nthe same time, an unmistakable murmur, growing every moment louder, and\r\nmore distinct, hoarse, piercing, fear-inspiring, reached them through\r\nthe darkness. It was the sound of the battalions marching and charging\r\nat the trumpet-command in all the adjoining streets. They resumed their\r\ngallant conversation, and then in another moment they stopped again and\r\nlistened to that species of ill-omened chant, chanted by Death, which\r\nwas approaching.\r\n\r\nNevertheless some still thought that they would not be attacked till the\r\nnext morning. Night combats are rare in street-warfare. They are more\r\n\"risky\" than all the other conflicts. Few generals venture upon them.\r\nBut amongst the old hands of the barricade, from certain never-failing\r\nsigns, they believed that an assault was imminent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at half-past ten at night, and not at eight o'clock as General\r\nMagnan has said in the despicable document which he calls his report--a\r\nspecial movement was heard in the direction of the markets. This was the\r\nmarching of the troops. Colonel de Lourmel had determined to make the\r\nattack. The 51st of the Line, posted at Saint Eustache, entered the Rue\r\nMontorgueil. The 2d battalion formed the advanced guard. The Grenadiers\r\nand the Light Infantry, hurled forward at the double, quickly carried\r\nthe three little barricades which were on the other side of the vacant\r\nspace of the Rue Mauconseil, and the feebly defended barricades of the\r\nadjoining streets. It was at that very moment that the barricade near\r\nwhich I was happened to be carried.\r\n\r\nFrom the barricade of the Petit Carreau they heard the night-strife draw\r\nnear through the darkness, with a fitful noise, strange and appalling.\r\nFirst a great tumult, then volleys, then silence, and then all began\r\nagain. The flashing of the fusillades suddenly delineated in the darkness\r\nthe outlines of the houses, which appeared as though they themselves\r\nwere affrighted.\r\n\r\nThe decisive moment drew near.\r\n\r\nThe outpost had fallen back upon the barricades. The advanced posts of\r\nthe Rue de Cléry and the Rue du Cadran had come back. They called over\r\nthe roll. Not one of those of the morning was missing.\r\n\r\nThey were, as we have said, about sixty combatants, and not a hundred,\r\nas the Magnan report has stated.\r\n\r\nFrom the upper extremity of the street where they were stationed it was\r\ndifficult to ascertain what was happening. They did not exactly know how\r\nmany barricades they were in the Rue Montorgueil between them and Saint\r\nEustache, whence the troops were coming. They only knew that their\r\nnearest point of resistance was the double Mauconseil barricade, and\r\nthat, when all was at an end there, it would be their turn.\r\n\r\nDenis had posted himself on the inner side of the barricade in such a\r\nmanner that half his body was above the top, and from there he watched.\r\nThe glimmer which came from the doorway of the wine-shop rendered his\r\ngestures visible.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he made a sign. The attack on the Mauconseil redoubt was\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, in fact, after having some time hesitated before this\r\ndouble wall of paving-stones, lofty, well-built, and which they supposed\r\nwas well defended, had ended by rushing upon it, and attacking it with\r\nblows of their guns.\r\n\r\nThey were not mistaken. It was well defended. We have already said that\r\nthere were only six men in this barricade, the six workmen who had built\r\nit. Of the six one only had three cartridges, the others had only two\r\nshots to fire. These six men heard the regiment advancing and the roll\r\nof the battery which was followed on it, and did not stir. Each remained\r\nsilent at his post of battle, the barrel of his gun between two\r\npaving-stones. When the soldiers were within range they fired, and the\r\nbattalion replied.\r\n\r\n\"That is right. Rage away, Red Breeches,\" said, laughingly, the man who\r\nhad three shots to fire.\r\n\r\nBehind them, the men of the Petit Carreau were crowded round Denis and\r\nJeanty Sarre, and leaning on the crest of their barricade, stretching\r\ntheir necks towards the Mauconseil redoubt, they watched them like the\r\ngladiators of the next combat.\r\n\r\nThe six men of this Mauconseil redoubt resisted the onslaught of the\r\nbattalion for nearly a quarter of an hour. They did not fire together,\r\n\"in order,\" one of them said, \"to make the pleasure last the longer.\"\r\nThe pleasure of being killed for duty; a noble sentence in this\r\nworkman's mouth. They did not fall back into the adjoining streets until\r\nafter having exhausted their ammunition. The last, he who had three\r\ncartridges, did not leave until the soldiers were actually scaling the\r\nsummit of the barricade.\r\n\r\nIn the barricade of the Petit Carreau not a word was spoken; they\r\nfollowed all the phases of this struggle, and they pressed each other's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the noise ceased, the last musket-shot was fired. A moment\r\nafterwards they saw the lighted candles being placed in all the windows\r\nwhich looked on on the Mauconseil redoubt. The bayonets and the brass\r\nornaments on the shakos sparkled there. The barricade was taken.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the battalion, as is always the custom in similar\r\ncircumstances, had sent orders into the adjoining houses to light up all\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\nThis was done at the Mauconseil redoubt.\r\n\r\nSeeing that their hour had come, the sixty combatants of the barricade\r\nof the Petit Carreau mounted their heap of paving-stones, and shouted\r\nwith one voice, in the midst of the darkness, this piercing cry, \"Long\r\nlive the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered them.\r\n\r\nThey could only hear the battalion loading their guns.\r\n\r\nThis acted upon them as a species of signal for action. They were all\r\nworn out with fatigue, having been on their feet since the preceding\r\nday, carrying paving-stones or fighting, the greater part had neither\r\neaten nor slept.\r\n\r\nCharpentier said to Jeanty Sarre,--\r\n\r\n\"We shall all be killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we really!\" said Jeanty Sarre.\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre ordered the door of the wine-shop to be closed, so that\r\ntheir barricade, completely shrouded in darkness, would give them some\r\nadvantage over the barricade which was occupied by the soldiers and\r\nlighted up.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the 51st searched the streets, carried the wounded into\r\nthe ambulances, and took up their position in the double barricade of\r\nthe Rue Mauconseil. Half an hour thus elapsed.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to clearly understand what is about to follow, the reader\r\nmust picture to himself in this silent street, in this darkness of the\r\nnight, at from sixty to eighty yards apart, within speaking distance,\r\nthese two redoubts facing each other, and able as in an Iliad to address\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nOn one side the Army, on the other side the People, the darkness over\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe species of truce which always precedes decisive encounters drew to a\r\nclose. The preparations were completed on both sides. The soldiers could\r\nbe heard forming into order of battle, and the captains giving out their\r\ncommands. It was evident that the struggle was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Let us begin,\" said Charpentier; and he raised his gun.\r\n\r\nDenis held his arm back. \"Wait,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThen an epic incident was seen.\r\n\r\nDenis slowly mounted the paving-stones of the barricade, ascended to the\r\ntop, and stood there erect, unarmed and bareheaded.\r\n\r\nThence he raised his voice, and, facing the soldiers, he shouted to\r\nthem, \"Citizens!\"\r\n\r\nAt this word a sort of electric shudder ensued which was felt from one\r\nbarricade to the other. Every sound was hushed, every voice was silent,\r\non both sides reigned a deep religious and solemn silence. By the\r\ndistant glimmer of a few lighted windows the soldiers could vaguely\r\ndistinguish a man standing above a mass of shadows, like a phantom who\r\nwas speaking to them in the night.\r\n\r\nDenis continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Citizens of the Army! Listen to me!\"\r\n\r\nThe silence grew still more profound.\r\n\r\nHe resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"What have you come to do here? You and ourselves, all of us who are in\r\nthis street, at this hour, with the sword or gun in hand, what are we\r\nabout to do? To kill each other! To kill each other, citizens! Why?\r\nBecause they have raised a misunderstanding between us! Because we\r\nobey--you your discipline--we our Right! You believe that you are\r\ncarrying out your instructions; as for us, we know that we are doing our\r\nduty. Yes! it is Universal Suffrage, it is the Right of the Republic, it\r\nis our Right that we are defending, and our Right, soldiers, is your\r\nRight. The Army is the People, as the People is the Army. We are the\r\nsame nation, the some country, the same men. My God! See, is there any\r\nRussian blood in my veins, in me who am speaking to you? Is there any\r\nPrussian blood in your veins, in you who are listening to me? No! Why\r\nthen should we fight? It is always an unfortunate thing for a man to\r\nfire upon a man. Nevertheless, a gun-shot between a Frenchman and an\r\nEnglishman can be understood; but between a Frenchman and a Frenchman,\r\nah! that wounds Reason, that wounds France, that wounds our mother!\"\r\n\r\nAll anxiously listened to him. At this moment from the opposite\r\nbarricade a voice shouted to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Go home, then!\"\r\n\r\nAt this coarse interruption an angry murmur ran through Denis's\r\ncompanions, and several guns could be heard being loaded. Denis\r\nrestrained them by a sign.\r\n\r\nThis sign possessed a strange authority.\r\n\r\n\"Who is this man?\" the combatants behind the barricade asked each other.\r\nSuddenly they cried out,--\r\n\r\n\"He is a Representative of the People!\"\r\n\r\nDenis had, in fact, suddenly assumed his brother Gaston's sash.\r\n\r\nWhat he had premeditated was about to be accomplished; the hour of the\r\nheroic falsehood had arrived. He cried out,--\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, do you know what the man is who is speaking to you at this\r\nmoment? He is not only a citizen, he is a Legislator! He is a\r\nRepresentative chosen by Universal Suffrage! My name is Dussoubs, and I\r\nam a Representative of the People. It is in the name of the National\r\nAssembly, it is in the name of the Sovereign Assembly, it is in the name\r\nof the People, and in the name of the Law, that I summon you to hear me.\r\nSoldiers, you are the armed force. Well, then, when the Law speaks, the\r\narmed force listens.\"\r\n\r\nThis time the silence was not broken.\r\n\r\nWe reproduce these words almost literally; such as they are, and such as\r\nthey have remained graven on the memory of those who heard them; but\r\nwhat we cannot reproduce, and what should be added to these words, in\r\norder to realize the effect, is the attitude, the accent, the thrill of\r\nemotion, the vibration of the words issuing from this noble breast, the\r\nintense impression produced by the terrible hour and place.\r\n\r\nDenis Dussoubs continued: \"He spoke for some twenty minutes,\" an\r\neye-witness has told me. Another has said, \"He spoke with a loud voice;\r\nthe whole street heard him.\" He was vehement, eloquent, earnest; a judge\r\nfor Bonaparte, a friend for the soldiers. He sought to rouse them by\r\neverything which could still vibrate in them; he recalled to them their\r\ntrue wars, their true victories, the national glory, the ancient\r\nmilitary honor, the flag. He told them that all this was about to be\r\nslain by the bullets from their guns. He adjured them, he ordered them\r\nto join themselves to the People and to the Law; and then suddenly\r\ncoming back to the first words which he had pronounced, carried away by\r\nthat fraternity with which his soul overflowed, he interrupted himself\r\nin the middle of a half-completed sentence, and cried out:--\r\n\r\n\"But to what purpose are all these words? It is not all this that is\r\nwanted, it is a shake of the hand between brothers! Soldiers, you are\r\nthere opposite us, at a hundred paces from us, in a barricade, with the\r\nsword drawn, with guns pointed; you are aiming directly at me; well\r\nthen, all of us who are here love you! There is not one of us who would\r\nnot give his life for one of you. You are the peasants of the fields of\r\nFrance; we are the workmen of Paris. What, then, is in question? Simply\r\nto see each other, to speak to each other, and not to cut each other's\r\nthroats. Shall we try this? Say! Ah! as for myself in this frightful\r\nbattle-field of civil war, I would rather die than kill. Look now, I am\r\ngoing to get off this barricade and come to you. I am unarmed; I only\r\nknow that you are my brothers. I am confident, I am calm; and if one of\r\nyou presents his bayonet at me, I will offer him my hand.\"\r\n\r\nHe finished speaking.\r\n\r\nA voice cried out from the opposite barricade, \"Advance in order!\"\r\n\r\nThen they saw him slowly descend the dimly-lighted crest of the\r\nbarricade, paving-stone by paving-stone, and plunge with head erect into\r\nthe dark street.\r\n\r\nFrom the barricade all eyes followed him with an inexpressible anxiety.\r\nHearts ceased beating, mouths no longer breathed.\r\n\r\nNo one attempted to restrain Denis Dussoubs. Each felt that he was going\r\nwhere he ought to go. Charpentier wished to accompany him. \"Would you\r\nlike me to go with you?\" he cried out to him. Dussoubs refused, with a\r\nshake of the head.\r\n\r\nDussoubs, alone and grave, advanced towards the Mauconseil Barricade.\r\nThe night was so dark that they lost sight of him immediately. They\r\ncould distinguish only for a few seconds his peaceable and intrepid\r\nbearing. Then he disappeared. They could no longer see anything. It was\r\nan inauspicious moment. The night was dark and dumb. There could only be\r\nheard in this thick darkness the sound of a measured and firm step dying\r\naway in the distance.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, how long no one could reckon, so completely did emotion\r\neclipse thought amongst the witnesses of this marvellous scene, a\r\nglimmer of light appeared in the barricade of the soldiers; it was\r\nprobably a lantern which was being brought or taken away. By the flash\r\nthey again saw Dussoubs, he was close to the barricade, he had almost\r\nreached it, he was walking towards it with his arms stretched out like\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the word of command, \"Fire!\" was heard.\r\n\r\nA fusillade burst forth.\r\n\r\nThey had fired upon Dussoubs when he was at the muzzles of their guns.\r\n\r\nDussoubs fell.\r\n\r\nThen he raised himself and cried, \"Long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nAnother bullet struck him, he fell again. Then they saw him raise\r\nhimself once more, and heard him shout in a loud voice, \"I die with the\r\nRepublic.\"\r\n\r\nThese were his last words.\r\n\r\nIn this manner died Denis Dussoubs.\r\n\r\nIt was not vainly that he had said to his brother, \"Your sash will be\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nHe was anxious that this sash should do its duty. He determined in the\r\ndepths of his great soul that this sash should triumph either through\r\nthe law or through death.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in the first case it would save Right, in the second\r\nsave Honor.\r\n\r\nDying, he could say, \"I have succeeded.\"\r\n\r\nOf the two possible triumphs of which he had dreamed, the gloomy triumph\r\nwas not the less splendid.\r\n\r\nThe insurgent of the Elysée thought that he had killed a Representative\r\nof the People, and boasted of it. The sole journal published by the\r\n_coup d'état_ under these different titles _Patrie_, _Univers_,\r\n_Moniteur_, _Parisien_, etc., announced on the next day, Friday, the\r\n5th, \"that the ex-Representative Dussoubs (Gaston) had been killed at\r\nthe barricade of the Rue Neuve Saint Eustache, and that he bore 'a red\r\nflag in his hand.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WAS DONE DURING THE NIGHT--THE PASSAGE DU SAUMON\r\n\r\nWhen those on the barricade of the Petit Carreau saw Dussoubs fall, so\r\ngloriously for his friends, so shamefully for his murderers, a moment of\r\nstupor ensued. Was it possible? Did they really see this before them?\r\nSuch a crime committed by our soldiers? Horror filled every soul.\r\n\r\nThis moment of surprise did not last long. \"Long live the Republic!\"\r\nshouted the barricade with one voice, and it replied to the ambuscade by\r\na formidable fire.\r\n\r\nThe conflict began. A mad conflict on the part of the _coup d'état_, a\r\nstruggle of despair on the side of the Republic. On the side of the\r\nsoldiers an appalling and cold blooded resolution, a passive and\r\nferocious obedience, numbers, good arms, absolute chiefs, pouches filled\r\nwith cartridges. On the side of the People no ammunition, disorder,\r\nweariness, exhaustion, no discipline, indignation serving for a leader.\r\n\r\nIt appears that while Dussoubs was speaking, fifteen grenadiers,\r\ncommanded by a sergeant named Pitrois, had succeeded in gliding in the\r\ndarkness along the houses, and, unperceived and unheard, had taken up\r\ntheir position close to the barricade. These fifteen men suddenly formed\r\nthemselves together with lowered bayonets at twenty paces from the\r\nbarricade ready to scale it. A volley received them. They fell back,\r\nleaving several corpses in the gutter. Major Jeannin cried out, \"Finish\r\nthem off.\" The entire battalion which occupied the Mauconseil barricade,\r\nthen appeared with raised bayonets upon the uneven crest of this\r\nbarricade, and from there without breaking their line, with a sudden,\r\nbut regulated and inexorable movement, sprang into the street. The four\r\ncompanies, in close order, and as though mingled and hardly visible,\r\nseemed like a wave precipitating itself with a great noise from the\r\nheight of the barricade.\r\n\r\nAt the barricade of the Petit Carreau they noted the manoeuvre, and had\r\npaused in their fire. \"Present,\" cried Jeanty Sarre, \"but do not fire;\r\nwait for the order.\"\r\n\r\nEach put his gun to his shoulder, then placed the barrels between the\r\npaving-stones, ready to fire, and waited.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had quitted the Mauconseil redoubt, the battalion rapidly\r\nformed itself into an attacking column, and a moment afterwards they\r\nheard the intermittent sound of an advance at the double. It was the\r\nbattalion which was coming upon them.\r\n\r\n\"Charpentier,\" said Jeanty Sarre, \"you have good eyes. Are they midway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Charpentier.\r\n\r\n\"Fire,\" said Jeanty Sarre.\r\n\r\nThe barricade fired. The whole street was filled with smoke. Several\r\nsoldiers fell. They could hear the cries of the wounded. The battalion,\r\nriddled with balls, halted and replied by platoon firing.\r\n\r\nSeven or eight combatants whose bodies reached above the barricade,\r\nwhich had been made hastily and was too low were hit. Three were killed\r\non the spot. One fell wounded by a ball in his stomach, between Jeanty\r\nSarre and Charpentier. He shrieked out with pain.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, to the ambulance:\" said Jeanty Sarre.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Rue du Cadran.\"\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre and Charpentier picked up the wounded man, the one by the\r\nfeet, the other by the head, and carried him to the du Cadran\r\nthrough the passage in the barricade.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time there was continued file firing. There no longer\r\nseemed anything in the street but smoke, the balls whistling and\r\ncrossing each other, the brief and repeated commands, some plaintive\r\ncries, and the flash of the guns lighting up the darkness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud void died out, \"Forwards!\" The battalion resumed its\r\ndouble-quick march and threw itself upon the barricade.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a horrible scene. They fought hand to hand, four hundred on\r\nthe one side, fifty on the other. They seized each other by the collar,\r\nby the throat, by the mouth, by the hair. There was no longer a\r\ncartridge in the barricade, but there remained despair. A workman,\r\npierced through and through, snatched the bayonet from his belly, and\r\nstabbed a soldier with it. They did not see each other, but they\r\ndevoured each other. It was a desperate scuffle in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe barricade did not hold out for two minutes. In several places, it\r\nmay be remembered, it was low. It was rather stridden over than scaled.\r\nThat was all the more heroic. One of the survivors[28] told the writer\r\nof these lines, \"The barricade defended itself very badly, but the men\r\ndied very well.\"\r\n\r\nAll this took place while Jeanty Sarre and Charpentier were carrying the\r\nwounded man to the ambulance in the Rue du Cadran. His wounds having\r\nbeen attended to, they came back to the barricade. They had just reached\r\nit when they heard themselves called by name. A feeble voice close by\r\nsaid to them, \"Jeanty Sarre! Charpentier!\" They turned round and saw one\r\nof their men who was dying leaning against a wall, and his knees giving\r\nway beneath him. He was a combatant who had left the barricade. He had\r\nonly been able to take a few steps down the street. He held his hand\r\nover his breast, where he had received a ball fired at close quarters.\r\nHe said to them in a scarcely audible voice, \"The barricade is taken,\r\nsave yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jeanty Sarre, \"I must unload my gun.\" Jeanty Sarre re-entered\r\nthe barricade, fired a last shot and went away.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more frightful than the interior of the captured\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans, overpowered by numbers, no longer offered any\r\nresistance. The officers cried out, \"No prisoners!\" The soldiers billed\r\nthose who were standing, and despatched those who had fallen. Many\r\nawaited their death with their heads erect. The dying raised themselves\r\nup, and shouted, \"Long live the Republic!\" Some soldiers ground their\r\nheels upon the faces of the dead, so that they should not be recognized.\r\nThere, stretched out amongst the corpses, in the middle of the\r\nbarricade, with his hair in the gutter, was seen the all-but namesake of\r\nCharpentier, Carpentier, the delegate of the committee of the Tenth\r\nArrondissement, who had been killed, and had fallen backwards, with two\r\nballs in his breast. A lighted candle which the soldiers had taken from\r\nthe wine-shop was placed on a paving stone.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were infuriated. One would say that they were revenging\r\nthemselves. On whom? A workman, named Paturel, received three balls and\r\nsix bayonet-thrusts, four of which were in the head. They thought that\r\nhe was dead, and they did not renew the attack. He felt them search him.\r\nThey took ten francs which he had about him. He did not die till six\r\ndays later, and he was able to relate the details which are given here.\r\nWe may note, by the way, that the name of Paturel does not figure upon\r\nany of the lists of the corpses published by M. Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nSixty Republicans were shut up in this redoubt of the Petit Carreau.\r\nForty-six were killed there. These men had come there that morning free,\r\nproud to fight, and joyous to die. At midnight all was at an end. The\r\nnight wagons carried away on the next day nine corpses to the hospital\r\ncemetery, and thirty-seven to Montmartre.\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre escaped by a miracle, as well as Charpentier, and a third\r\nwhose name we have not been able to ascertain. They glided along the\r\nhouses and reached the Passage du Saumon. The grated doors which closed\r\nthe Passage during the night only reached to the centre of the archway.\r\nThey climbed it and got over the spikes, at the risk of tearing\r\nthemselves. Jeanty Sarre was the first to climb it; having reached the\r\nsummit, one of the spikes pierced his trousers, hooked them, and Jeanty\r\nSarre fell headforemost upon the pavement. He got up again, he was only\r\nstunned. The other two followed him, and gliding along the bars, all\r\nthree found themselves in the Passage. It was dimly lighted by a lamp\r\nwhich shone at one end. In the meanwhile, they heard the soldiers, who\r\nwere pursuing them, coming up. In order to escape by the Rue Montmartre,\r\nthey would have to climb the grated gateway at the other end of the\r\nPassage; their hands were grazed, their knees were bleeding; they were\r\ndying of weariness; they were in no condition to recommence a similar\r\nascent.\r\n\r\nJeanty Sarre knew where the keeper of the Passage lived. He knocked at\r\nhis window, and begged him to open. The keeper refused.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the detachment which had been sent in pursuit of them\r\nreached the grated gateway which they had just climbed. The soldiers,\r\nhearing a noise in the Passage, passed the barrels of their guns through\r\nthe bars. Jeanty Sarre squeezed himself against the wall behind one of\r\nthose projecting columns which decorate the Passage; but the column was\r\nvery thin, and only half covered him. The soldiers fired, and smoke\r\nfilled the Passage. When it cleared away, Jeanty Sarre saw Charpentier\r\nstretched on the stones, with his face to the ground. He had been shot\r\nthrough the heart. Their other companion lay a few paces from him,\r\nmortally wounded.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers did not scale the grated gateway, but they posted a\r\nsentinel before it. Jeanty Sarre heard them going away by the Rue\r\nMontmartre. They would doubtless come back.\r\n\r\nNo means of flight. He felt all the doors round his prison successively.\r\nOne of them at length opened. This appeared to him like a miracle.\r\nWhoever could have forgotten to shut the door? Providence, doubtless. He\r\nhid himself behind it, and remained there for more than an hour,\r\nstanding motionless, scarcely breathing. He no longer heard any sound;\r\nhe ventured out. The sentinel was no longer there. The detachment had\r\nrejoined the battalion.\r\n\r\nOne of his old friends, a man to whom he had rendered services such as\r\nare not forgotten, lived in this very Passage du Saumon. Jeanty Sarre\r\nlooked for the number, woke the porter, told him the name of his friend,\r\nwas admitted, went up the stairs, and knocked at the door. The door was\r\nopened, his friend appeared in his nightshirt, with a candle in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHe recognized Jeanty Sarre, and cried out, \"You here! What a state you\r\nare in! Where hove you come from? From what riot? from what madness? And\r\nthen you come to compromise us all here? To have us murdered? To have us\r\nshot? Now then, what do you want with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to give me a brush down,\" said Jeanty Sarre.\r\n\r\nHis friend took a brush and brushed him, and Jeanty Sarre went away.\r\nWhile going down the stairs, Jeanty Sarre cried out to his friend,\r\n\"Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the kind of hospitality which we have since received in Belgium,\r\nin Switzerland, and even in England.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when they took up the bodies they found on Charpentier a\r\nnote-book and a pencil, and upon Denis Dussoubs a letter. A letter to a\r\nwoman. Even these stoic souls love.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, Denis Dussoubs began this letter. He did not\r\nfinish it. Here it is:--\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR MARIE,\r\n\r\n  \"Have you experienced that sweet pain of feeling regret for him who\r\n  regrets you? For myself since I left you I have known no other\r\n  affliction than that of thinking of you. Even in my affliction itself\r\n  there was something sweet and tender, and although I was troubled, I\r\n  was nevertheless happy to feel in the depths of my heart how greatly\r\n  I loved you by the regret which you cost me. Why are we separated?\r\n  Why have I been forced to fly from you? For we were so happy! When I\r\n  think of our little evenings so free from constraint, of our gay\r\n  country chats with your sisters, I feel myself seized with a bitter\r\n  regret. Did we not love each other clearly, my darling? We had no\r\n  secret from each other because we had no need to have one, and our\r\n  lips uttered the thoughts of our hearts without our thinking to keep\r\n  anything back.\r\n\r\n  \"God has snatched away from us all these blessings, and nothing will\r\n  console me for having lost them; do you not lament with me the evils\r\n  of absence?\r\n\r\n  \"How seldom we see those whom we love! Circumstances take us far from\r\n  them, and our soul tormented and attracted out of ourselves lives in\r\n  a perpetual anguish. I feel this sickness of absence. I imagine\r\n  myself wherever you are. I follow your work with my eyes, or I listen\r\n  to your words, seated beside you and seeking to divine the word which\r\n  you are about to utter; your sisters sew by our side. Empty\r\n  dreams--illusions of a moment--my hand seeks yours; where are you, my\r\n  beloved one?\r\n\r\n  \"My life is an exile. Far from those whom I love and by whom I am\r\n  loved, my heart calls them and consumes away in its grief. No, I do\r\n  not love the great cities and their noise, towns peopled with\r\n  strangers where no one knows you and where you know no one, where\r\n  each one jostles and elbows the other without ever exchanging a\r\n  smile. But I love our quiet fields, the peace of home, and the voice\r\n  of friends who greet you. Up to the present I have always lived in\r\n  contradiction with my nature; my fiery blood, my nature so hostile to\r\n  injustice, the spectacle of unmerited miseries have thrown me into a\r\n  struggle of which I do not foresee the issue, a struggle in which\r\n  will remain to the end without fear and without reproach, that which\r\n  daily breaks me down and consumes my life.\r\n\r\n  \"I tell you, my much-loved darling, the secret miseries of my heart;\r\n  no, I do not blush for what my hand has just written, but my heart is\r\n  sick and suffering, and I tell it to you. I suffer... I wish to blot\r\n  out these lines, but why? Could they offend you? What do they contain\r\n  that could wound my darling? Do I not know your affection, and do I\r\n  not know that you love me? Yes, you have not deceived me, I did not\r\n  kiss a lying mouth; when seated on my knees you lulled me with the\r\n  charm of your words, I believed you. I wished to bind myself to a\r\n  burning iron bar; weariness preys upon me and devours me. I feel a\r\n  maddening desire to recover life. Is it Paris that produces this\r\n  effect upon me? I always yearn to be in places where I am not. I live\r\n  here to a complete solitude. I believe you, Marie....\"\r\n\r\nCharpentier's note-book only contained this line, which he had written\r\nin the darkness at the foot of the barricade while Denis Dussoubs was\r\nspeaking:--\r\n\r\n  Admonet et magna testatur voce per umbras.\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] February 18. Louvain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER DEEDS OF DARKNESS\r\n\r\nYvan had again seen Conneau. He corroborated the information given in\r\nthe letter of Alexandre Dumas to Bocage; with the fact we had the names.\r\nOn the 3d of December at M. Abbatucci's house, 31, Rue Caumartin, in the\r\npresence of Dr. Conneau and of Piétri, a Corsican, born at Vezzani,\r\nnamed Jacques François Criscelli,[29] a man attached to the secret and\r\npersonal service of Louis Bonaparte, had received from Piétri's own\r\nmouth the offer of 25,000 francs \"to take or kill Victor Hugo.\" He had\r\naccepted, and said, \"That is all very well if I am alone. But suppose\r\nthere are two of us?\"\r\n\r\nPiétri had answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Then there will be 50,000 francs.\"\r\n\r\nThis communication, accompanied by urgent prayers, had been made to me\r\nby Yvan in the Rue de Monthabor, while we were still at Dupont White's.\r\n\r\nThis said, I continue my story.\r\n\r\nThe massacre of the 4th did not produce the whole of its effect until\r\nthe next day, the 5th. The impulse given by us to the resistance still\r\nlasted for some hours, and at nightfall, in the labyrinth of houses\r\nranging from the Rue du Petit Carreau to the Rue du Temple, there was\r\nfighting. The Pagevin, Neuve Saint Eustache, Montorgueil, Rambuteau,\r\nBeaubourg, and Transnonain barricades were gallantly defended. There,\r\nthere was an impenetrable network of streets and crossways barricaded by\r\nthe People, surrounded by the Army.\r\n\r\nThe assault was merciless and furious.\r\n\r\nThe barricade of the Rue Montorgueil was one of those which held out the\r\nlongest. A battalion and artillery was needed to carry it. At the last\r\nmoment it was only defended by three men, two shop-clerks and a\r\nlemonade-seller of an adjoining street. When the assault began the night\r\nwas densely dark, and the three combatants escaped. But they were\r\nsurrounded. No outlets. Not one door was open. They climbed the grated\r\ngateway of the Passage Verdeau as Jeanty Sarre and Charpentier had\r\nscaled the Passage du Saumon, had jumped over, and had fled down the\r\nPassage. But the other grated gateway was closed, and like Jeanty Sarre\r\nand Charpentier they had no time to climb it. Besides, they heard the\r\nsoldiers corning on both sides. In a corner at the entrance of the\r\nPassage there were a few planks which had served to close a stall, and\r\nwhich the stall-keeper was in the habit of putting there. They hid\r\nthemselves beneath these planks.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers who had taken the barricade, after having searched the\r\nstreets, bethought themselves of searching the Passage. They also\r\nclimbed over the grated gateway, looked about everywhere with lanterns,\r\nand found nothing They were going away, when one of them perceived the\r\nfoot of one of these three unfortunate men which was projecting from\r\nbeneath the planks.\r\n\r\nThey killed all three of them on the spot with bayonet-thrusts. They\r\ncried out, \"Kill us at once! Shoot us! Do not prolong our misery.\"\r\n\r\nThe neighboring shop-keepers heard these cries, but dared not open their\r\ndoors or their windows, for fear, as one of them said the next day,\r\n\"that they should do the same to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe execution at an end, the executioners left the three victims lying\r\nin a pool of blood on the pavement of the Passage. One of those\r\nunfortunate men did not die until eight o'clock next morning.\r\n\r\nNo one had dared to ask for mercy; no one had dared to bring any help.\r\nThey left them to die there.\r\n\r\nOne of the combatants of the Rue Beaubourg was more fortunate. They were\r\npursuing him. He rushed up a staircase, reached a roof, and from there a\r\npassage, which proved to be the top corridor of an hotel. A key was in\r\nthe door. He opened it boldly, and found himself face to face with a man\r\nwho was going to bed. It was a tired-out traveller who had arrived at\r\nthe hotel that very evening. The fugitive said to the traveller, \"I am\r\nlost, save me!\" and explained him the situation in three words.\r\n\r\nThe traveller said to him, \"Undress yourself, and get into my bed.\" And\r\nthen he lit a cigar, and began quietly to smoke. Just as the man of the\r\nbarricade had got into bed a knock came at the door. It was the solders\r\nwho were searching the house. To the questions which they asked him the\r\ntraveller answered, pointing to the bed, \"We are only two here. We have\r\njust arrived here. I am smoking my cigar, and my brother is asleep.\" The\r\nwaiter was questioned, and confirmed the traveller's statement. The\r\nsoldiers went away, and no one was shot.\r\n\r\nWe will say this, that the victorious soldiers killed less than on the\r\npreceding day. They did not massacre in all the captured barricades. The\r\norder had been given on that day to make prisoners. It might also be\r\nbelieved that a certain humanity existed. What was this humanity? We\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock at night all was at an end.\r\n\r\nThey arrested all those whom they found in the streets which had been\r\nsurrounded, whether combatants or not, they had all the wine-shops and\r\nthe _cafés_ opened, they closely searched the houses, they seized all\r\nthe men whom they could find, only leaving the women and the children.\r\nTwo regiments formed in a square carried away all these prisoners\r\nhuddled together. They took them to the Tuileries, and shut them up in\r\nthe vast cellar situated beneath the terrace at the waterside.\r\n\r\nOn entering this cellar the prisoners felt reassured. They called to\r\nmind that in June, 1848, a great number of insurgents had been shut up\r\nthere, and later on had been transported. They said to themselves that\r\ndoubtless they also would be transported, or brought before the Councils\r\nof War, and that they had plenty of time before them.\r\n\r\nThey were thirsty. Many of them had been fighting since that morning,\r\nand nothing parches tire mouth so much as biting cartridges. They asked\r\nfor drink. Three pitchers of water were brought to them.\r\n\r\nA sort of security suddenly fell upon them. Amongst them were several\r\nwho had been transported in June, 1848, and who had already been in that\r\ncellar, and who said, \"In June they were not so humane. They left us for\r\nthree days without food or drink.\" Some of them wrapped themselves up in\r\ntheir overcoats or cloaks, lay down, and slept. At one o'clock in the\r\nmorning a great noise was heard outside. Soldiers, carrying torches,\r\nappeared in the cellars, the prisoners who were sleeping woke with a\r\nstart, an officer ordered them to get up.\r\n\r\nThey made them go out anyhow as they had come in. As they went out they\r\ncoupled them two by two at random, and a sergeant counted them in a loud\r\nvoice. They asked neither their names, nor their professions, nor their\r\nfamilies, nor who they were, nor whence they came; they contented\r\nthemselves with the numbers. The numbers sufficed for what they were\r\nabout to do.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they counted 337. The counting having come to an end,\r\nthey ranged them in close columns, still two by two and arm-in-arm. They\r\nwere not tied together, but on each side of the column, on the right and\r\non the left, there were three files of soldiers keeping them within\r\ntheir ranks, with guns loaded; a battalion was at their head, a\r\nbattalion in their rear. They began to march, pressed together and\r\nenclosed in this moving frame of bayonets.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the column set forward, a young law-student, a fair\r\npale Alsatian, of some twenty years, who was in their ranks, asked a\r\ncaptain, who was marching by him with his sword drawn,--\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer made no reply.\r\n\r\nHaving left the Tuileries, they turned to the right, and followed the\r\nquay as far as the Pont de la Concorde. They crossed the Pont de la\r\nConcorde, and again turned to the right. In this manner they passed\r\nbefore the esplanade of the Invalides, and reached the lonely quay of\r\nGros-Caillou.\r\n\r\nAs we have just said, they numbered 337, and as they walked two by two,\r\nthere was one, the last, who walked alone. He was one of the most daring\r\ncombatants of the Rue Pagevin, a friend of Lecomte the younger. By\r\nchance the sergeant, who was posted in the inner file by his side, was a\r\nnative of the same province. On passing under a street-lamp they\r\nrecognized each other. They exchanged quickly a few words in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"To the military school,\" answered the sergeant. And he added, \"Ah! my\r\npoor lad!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he kept at a distance from the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAs this was the end of the column, there was a certain space between the\r\nlast rank of the soldiers who formed the line, and the first rank of the\r\ncompany which closed the procession.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the lonely boulevard of Gros-Caillon, of which we have\r\njust spoken, the sergeant drew near to the prisoner, and said to him in\r\na rapid and low tone,--\r\n\r\n\"One can hardly see here. It is a dark spot. On the left there are\r\ntrees. Be off!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the prisoner, \"they will fire at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will miss you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they kill me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be no worse than what awaits you.\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner understood, shook the sergeant's hand, and taking advantage\r\nof the space between the line of soldiers and rear-ground, rushed with a\r\nsingle bound outside the column, and disappeared in the darkness beneath\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n\"A man is escaping!\" cried out the officer who commanded the last\r\ncompany. \"Halt! Fire!\"\r\n\r\nThe column halted. The rear-guard company fired at random in the\r\ndirection taken by the fugitive, and, as the sergeant had foreseen,\r\nmissed him. In a few moments the fugitive had reached the streets\r\nadjoining the tobacco manufactory, and had plunged into them. They did\r\nnot pursue him. They had more pressing work on hand.\r\n\r\nBesides, confusion might have arisen in their ranks, and to recapture\r\none they risked letting the 336 escape.\r\n\r\nThe column continued its march. Having reached the Pont d'Iéna, they\r\nturned to the left, and entered into the Champ de Mars.\r\n\r\nThere they shot them all.\r\n\r\nThese 336 corpses were amongst those which were carried to Montmartre\r\nCemetery, and which were buried there with their heads exposed.\r\n\r\nIn this manner their families were enabled to recognize them. The\r\nGovernment learned who they were after killing them.\r\n\r\nAmongst these 336 victims were a large number of the combatants of the\r\nRue Pagevin and the Rue Rambuteau, of the Rue Neuve Saint Eustache and\r\nthe Porte Saint Denis. There were also 100 passers-by, whom they had\r\narrested because they happened to be there, and without any particular\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nBesides, we will at once mention that the wholesale executions from the\r\n3d inst. were renewed nearly every night. Sometimes at the Champ de\r\nMars, sometimes at the Prefecture of Police, sometimes at both places at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nWhen the prisons were full, M. de Maupas said \"Shoot!\" The fusillades at\r\nthe Prefecture took place sometimes in the courtyard, sometimes in the\r\nRue de Jérusalem. The unfortunate people whom they shot were placed\r\nagainst the wall which bears the theatrical notices. They had chosen\r\nthis spot because it is close by the sewer-grating of the gutter, so\r\nthat the blood would run down at once, and would leave fewer traces. On\r\nFriday, the 5th, they shot near this gutter of the Rue de Jérusalem 150\r\nprisoners. Some one[30] said to me, \"On the next day I passed by there,\r\nthey showed the spot; I dug between the paving-stones with the toe of my\r\nboot, and I stirred up the mud. I found blood.\"\r\n\r\nThis expression forms the whole history of the _coup d'état_, and will\r\nform the whole history of Louis Bonaparte. Stir up this mud, you will\r\nfind blood.\r\n\r\nLet this then be known to History:--\r\n\r\nThe massacre of the boulevard had this infamous continuation, the secret\r\nexecutions. The _coup d'état_ after having been ferocious became\r\nmysterious. It passed from impudent murder in broad day to hidden murder\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nEvidence abounds.\r\n\r\nEsquiros, hidden in the Gros-Caillou, heard the fusillades on the Champ\r\nde Mars every night.\r\n\r\nAt Mazas, Chambolle, on the second night of his incarceration, heard\r\nfrom midnight till five o'clock in the morning, such volleys that he\r\nthought the prison was attacked.\r\n\r\nLike Montferrier, Desmoulins bore evidence to blood between the\r\npaving-stones of the Rue de Jérusalem.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cailland, of the ex-Republican Guard, is crossing the\r\nPont Neuf; he sees some _sergents de ville_ with muskets to their\r\nshoulders, aiming at the passers-by; he says to them, \"You dishonor the\r\nuniform.\" They arrest him. They search him. A _sergent de ville_ says to\r\nhim, \"If we find a cartridge upon you, we shall shoot you.\" They find\r\nnothing. They take him to the Prefecture of Police, they shut him up in\r\nthe station-house. The director of the station-house comes and says to\r\nhim, \"Colonel, I know you well. Do not complain of being here. You are\r\nconfided to my care. Congratulate yourself on it. Look here, I am one of\r\nthe family, I go and I come, I see, I listen; I know what is going on; I\r\nknow what is said; I divine what is not said. I hear certain noises\r\nduring the night; I see contain traces in the morning. As for myself I\r\nam not a bad fellow. I am taking care of you. I am keeping you out of\r\nthe way. At the present moment be contented to remain with me. If you\r\nwere not here you would be underground.\"\r\n\r\nAn ex-magistrate, General Leflô's brother-in-law, is conversing on the\r\nPont de la Concorde with some officers before the steps of the Chamber;\r\nsome policemen come up to him: \"You are tampering with the army.\" He\r\nprotests, they throw him into a vehicle, and they take him to the\r\nPrefecture of Police. As he arrives there he sees a young man, in a\r\nblouse and a cap, passing on the quay, who is being shoved along by\r\nthree municipal guards with the butt-ends of their muskets. At an\r\nopening of the parapet, a guard shouts to him, \"Go in there.\" The man\r\ngoes in. Two guards shoot him in the back. He falls. The third guard\r\ndespatches him with a shot in his ear.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th the massacres were not yet at an end. On the morning of that\r\nday, in the dim light of the dawn, a solitary passer-by, going along the\r\nRue Saint Honoré, saw, between two lines of horse-soldiers, three wagons\r\nwending their way, heavily loaded. These wagons could be traced by the\r\nstains of blood which dripped from them. They came from the Champ de\r\nMars, and were going to the Montmartre Cemetery. They were full of\r\ncorpses.\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] It was this same Criscelli, who later on at Vaugirard in the Rue du\r\nTrancy, killed by special order of the Prefect of Police a man named\r\nKech, \"suspected of plotting the assassination of the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n[30] The Marquis Sarrazin de Montferrier, a relative of my eldest\r\nbrother. I can now mention his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nAl danger being over, all scruples vanished. Prudent and wise people\r\ncould now give their adherence to the _coup d'état_, they allowed their\r\nnames to be posted up.\r\n\r\nHere is the placard:\r\n\r\n  \"FRENCH REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n  \"_In the

Daru, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  \"I approve of the proceedings of the National Assembly at the Mairie\r\n  of the Tenth Arrondissement on the 2d of December, 1851, in which I was\r\n  hindered from participating by force.\r\n\r\n  \"DARU.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these members of the Consultative Committee came from Mazas or\r\nfrom Mount Valerien. They had been detained in a cell for four-and-twenty\r\nhours, and then released. It may be seen that these legislators bore\r\nlittle malice to the man who had made them undergo this disagreeable\r\ntaste of the law.\r\n\r\nMany of the personages comprised in this menagerie possessed no other\r\nrenown but the outcry caused by their debts, clamoring around them.\r\nSuch a one had been twice declared bankrupt, but this extenuating\r\ncircumstance was added, \"not under his own name:\" Another who belonged\r\nto a literary or scientific circle was reputed to have sold his vote. A\r\nthird, who was handsome, elegant, fashionable, dandified, polished,\r\ngilded, embroidered, owed his prosperity to a connection which indicated\r\na filthiness of soul.\r\n\r\nSuch people as these gave their adherence with little hesitation to the\r\ndeed which \"saved society.\"\r\n\r\nSome others, amongst those who composed this mosaic, possessed no\r\npolitical enthusiasm, and merely consented to figure in this list in\r\norder to keep their situations and their salaries; they were under the\r\nEmpire what they had been before the Empire, neuters, and during the\r\nnineteen years of the reign, they continued to exercise their military,\r\njudicial, or administrative functions unobtrusively, surrounded with the\r\nright and proper respect due to inoffensive idiots.\r\n\r\nOthers were genuine politicians, belonging to that learned school which\r\nbegins with Guizot, and does not finish with Parieu, grave physicians of\r\nsocial order, who reassure the frightened middle-classes, and who\r\npreserve dead things.\r\n\r\n  \"Shall I lose my eye?\" asked Messer Pancrace.\r\n  \"Not at all, my friend, I hold it in my hand.\"\r\n\r\nIn this quasi Council of State there were a goodly number of men of the\r\nPolice, a race of beings then held in esteem, Carlier, Piétri, Maupas,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nShortly after the 2d of December under the title of Mixed Commissions,\r\nthe police substituted itself for justice, drew up judgments, pronounced\r\nsentences, violated every law judicially without the regular magistracy\r\ninterposing the slightest obstacle to this irregular magistracy: Justice\r\nallowed the police to do what it liked with the satisfied look of a team\r\nof horses which had just been relieved.\r\n\r\nSome of the men inscribed on the list of this commission refused: Léon\r\nFaucher Goulard, Mortemart, Frédéric Granier, Marchand, Maillard\r\nParavay, Beugnot. The newspapers received orders not to publish these\r\nrefusals.\r\n\r\nM. Beugnot inscribed on his card: \"Count Beugnot, who does not belong to\r\nthe Consultative Committee.\"\r\n\r\nM. Joseph Périer went from corner to corner of the streets, pencil in\r\nhand, scratching out his name from all the placards, saying, \"I shall\r\ntake back my name wherever I find it.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Baraguay d'Hilliers did not refuse. A brave soldier nevertheless;\r\nhe had lost an arm in the Russian war. Later on, he has been Marshall of\r\nFrance; he deserved better than to have been created a Marshal by Louis\r\nBonaparte. It did not appear likely that he would have come to this.\r\nDuring the last days of November General Baraguay d'Hilliers, seated in a\r\nlarge arm-chair before the high fireplace of the Conference Hall of the\r\nNational Assembly, was warming himself; some one, one of his colleagues,\r\nhe who is writing these lines, sat down near him on the other side of the\r\nfireplace. They did not speak to each other, one belonging to the Right,\r\nthe other to the Left; but M. Piscatory came in, who belonged a little to\r\nthe Right and a little to the Left. He addressed himself to Baraguay\r\nd'Hilliers: \"Well, general, do you know what they are saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"That one of these days the President will shut the door in our faces.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Baraguay d'Hilliers answered, and I heard the answer,--\"If M.\r\nBonaparte should close the door of the Assembly against us, France will\r\nfling it wide open again.\"\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte at one moment thought of entitling this committee the\r\n\"Executive Commission.\" \"No,\" said Morny to him, \"that would be to\r\ncredit them with courage. They will willingly be supporters; they will\r\nnot be proscribers.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Rulhière was dismissed for having blamed the passive obedience\r\nof the army.\r\n\r\nLet us here mention an incident. Some days after the 4th of December,\r\nEmmanuel Arago met M. Dupin, who was going up the Faubourg Saint Honoré.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Arago, \"are you going to the Elysée?\"\r\n\r\nM. Dupin answered, \"I never go to disreputable houses.\"\r\n\r\nYet he went there.\r\n\r\nM. Dupin, it may be remembered, was appointed Attorney-General at the\r\nCourt of Cessation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER LIST\r\n\r\nOpposite to the list of adherents should be placed the list of the\r\nproscribed. In this manner the two sides of the _coup d'état_ can be\r\nseen at a glance.\r\n\r\n  \"DECREE.\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE I.--The ex-Representatives of the Assembly, whose names are\r\n  found beneath, are expelled from French territory, from Algeria, and\r\n  from the Colonies, for the sake of public safety:--\r\n\r\n  \"Edmond Valentine.

Four Representatives,\r\nMathé, Greppo, Marc-Dufraisse, and Richardet, were added to the list of\r\nthe \"expelled.\" Representative Miot was reserved for the tortures of the\r\ncasemates of Africa. Thus in addition to the massacres, the victory of\r\nthe _coup d'état_ was paid for by these figures: eighty-eight\r\nRepresentatives proscribed, one killed.\r\n\r\nI usually dined at Brussels in a café, called the Café des Mille\r\nColonnes, which was frequented by the exiles. On the 10th of January I\r\nhad invited Michel de Bourges to lunch, and we were sitting at the same\r\ntable. The waiter brought me the _Moniteur Français_; I glanced over it.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said I, \"here is the list of the proscribed.\" I ran my eye over it,\r\nand I said to Michel de Bourges, \"I have a piece of bad news to tell\r\nyou.\" Michel de Bourges turned pale. I added, \"You are not on the list.\"\r\nHis face brightened.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges, so dauntless in the face of death, was faint-hearted\r\nin the face of exile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID D'ANGERS\r\n\r\nBrutalities and ferocities were mingled together. The great sculptor,\r\nDavid d'Angers, was arrested in his own house, 16, Rue d'Assas; the\r\nCommissary of Police on entering, said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Have you any arms in your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Said David, \"for my defence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n\"If I had to deal with civilized people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are these arms?\" rejoined the Commissary. \"Let us see them.\"\r\n\r\nDavid showed him his studio full of masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThey placed him in a _fiacre_, and drove him to the station-house of the\r\nPrefecture of Police.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was only space for 120 prisoners, there were 700 there.\r\nDavid was the twelfth in a dungeon intended for two. No light nor air. A\r\nnarrow ventilation hole above their heads. A dreadful tub in a corner,\r\ncommon to all, covered but not closed by a wooden lid. At noon they\r\nbrought them soup, a sort of warm and stinking water, David told me. They\r\nstood leaning against the wall, and trampled upon the mattresses which\r\nhad been thrown on the floor, not having room to lie down on them. At\r\nlength, however, they pressed so closely to each other, that they\r\nsucceeded in lying down at full length. Their jailers had thrown them\r\nsome blankets. Some of them slept. At day break the bolts creaked, the\r\ndoor was half-opened and the jailers cried out to them, \"Get up!\" They\r\nwent into the adjoining corridor, the jailer took up the mattresses,\r\nthrew a few buckets of water on the floor, wiped it up anyhow, replaced\r\nthe mattresses on the damp stones, and said to them, \"Go back again.\"\r\nThey locked them up until the next morning. From time to time they\r\nbrought in 100 new prisoners, and they fetched away 100 old ones (those\r\nwho had been there for two or three days). What became of them?--At night\r\nthe prisoners could hear from their dungeon the sound of explosions, and\r\nin the morning passers-by could see, as we have stated, pools of blood in\r\nthe courtyard of the Prefecture.\r\n\r\nThe calling over of those who went out was conducted in alphabetical\r\norder.\r\n\r\nOne day they called David d'Angers. David took up his packet, and was\r\ngetting ready to leave, when the governor of the jail, who seemed to be\r\nkeeping watch over him, suddenly came up and said quickly, \"Stay, M.\r\nDavid, stay.\"\r\n\r\nOne morning he saw Buchez, the ex-President of the Constituent Assembly,\r\ncoming into his cell \"Ah!\" said David, \"good! you have come to visit the\r\nprisoners?\"--\"I am a prisoner,\" said Buchez.\r\n\r\nThey wished to insist on David leaving for America. He refused. They\r\ncontented themselves with Belgium. On the 19th December he reached\r\nBrussels. He came to see me, and said to me, \"I am lodging at the Grand\r\nMonarque, 89, Rue des Fripiers.\"[31]\r\n\r\nAnd he added laughing, \"The Great Monarch--the King. The old\r\nclothesmen--the Royalists, '89. The Revolution.\" Chance occasionally\r\nfurnishes some wit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[31] _Anglice_, \"old clothes men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR LAST MEETING\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of December everything was coming in in our favor. On the 5th\r\neverything was receding from us. It was like a mighty sea which was going\r\nout. The tide had come in gloriously, it went out disastrously. Gloomy\r\nebb and flow of the people.\r\n\r\nAnd who was the power who said to this ocean, \"Thou shalt go no farther?\"\r\nAlas! a pigmy.\r\n\r\nThese hiding-places of the abyss are fathomless.\r\n\r\nThe abyss is afraid. Of what?\r\n\r\nOf something deeper than itself. Of the Crime.\r\n\r\nThe people drew back. They drew back on the 5th; on the 6th they\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nOn the horizon there could be seen nothing but the beginning of a species\r\nof vast night.\r\n\r\nThis night has been the Empire.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves on the 5th what we were on the 2d. Alone.\r\n\r\nBut we persevered. Our mental condition was this--desperate, yes;\r\ndiscouraged, no.\r\n\r\nItems of bad news came to us as good news had come to us on the evening\r\nof the 3d, one after another. Aubry du Nord was at the Concièrgerie. Our\r\ndear and eloquent Crémieux was at Mazas. Louis Blanc, who, although\r\nbanished, was coming to the assistance of France, and was bringing to us\r\nthe great power of his name and of his mind, had been compelled, like\r\nLedru Rollin, to halt before the catastrophe of the 4th. He had not been\r\nable to get beyond Tournay.\r\n\r\nAs for General Neumayer, he had not \"marched upon Paris,\" but he had come\r\nthere. For what purpose? To give in his submission.\r\n\r\nWe no longer possessed a refuge. No. 15, Rue Richelieu, was watched, No.\r\n11, Rue Monthabor, had been denounced. We wandered about Paris, meeting\r\neach other here and there, and exchanging a few words in a whisper, not\r\nknowing where we should sleep, or whether we should get a meal; and\r\namongst those heads which did not know what pillow they should have at\r\nnight there was at least one upon which a price was set.\r\n\r\nThey accosted each other, and this is the sort of conversation they\r\nheld:--\r\n\r\n\"What has became of So-and-So?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"And So-and-So?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"And So-and-So?\"\r\n\r\n\"Disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nWe held, however, one other meeting. This was on the 6th, at the house of\r\nthe Representative Raymond, in the Place de la Madeleine. Nearly all of\r\nus met there. I was enabled to shake the hands of Edgar Quinet, of\r\nChauffour, of Clément Dulac, of Bancel, of Versigny, of Emile Péan, and I\r\nagain met our energetic and honest host of the Rue Blanche, Coppens, and\r\nour courageous colleague, Pons Stande, whom we had lost sight of in the\r\nsmoke of the battle. From the windows of the room where we were\r\ndeliberating we could see the Place de la Madeleine and the Boulevards\r\nmilitarily occupied, and covered with a fierce and deep mass of soldiers\r\ndrawn up in battle order, and which still seemed to face a possible\r\ncombat. Charamaule came in.\r\n\r\nHe drew two pistols from his great cloak, placed them on the table, and\r\nsaid, \"All is at an end. Nothing feasible and sensible remains, except a\r\ndeed of rashness. I propose it. Are you of my opinion, Victor Hugo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nI did not know what he was going to say, but I knew that he would only\r\nsay that which was noble.\r\n\r\nThis was his proposition.\r\n\r\n\"We number,\" resumed he, \"about fifty Representatives of the People,\r\nstill standing and assembled together. We are all that remains of the\r\nNational Assembly, of Universal Suffrage, of the Law, of Right.\r\nTo-morrow, where shall we be? We do not know. Scattered or dead. The hour\r\nof to-day is ours; this hour gone and past, we have nothing left but the\r\nshadow. The opportunity is unique. Let us profit by it.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, looked at us fixedly with his steadfast gaze, and resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"Let us take the advantage of this chance of being alive and the good\r\nfortune of being together. The group which is here is the whole of the\r\nRepublic. Well, then; let us offer in our persons all the Republic to the\r\narmy, and let us make the army fall back before the Republic, and Might\r\nfall back before Right. In that supreme moment one of the two must\r\ntremble, Might or Right, and if Right does not tremble Might will\r\ntremble. If we do not tremble the soldiers will tremble. Let us march\r\nupon the Crime. If the Law advances, the Crime will draw back. In either\r\ncase we shall have done our duty. Living, we shall be preservers, dead,\r\nwe shall be heroes. This is what I propose.\"\r\n\r\nA profound silence ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Let us put on our sashes, and let us all go down in a procession, two by\r\ntwo, into the Place de la Madeleine. You can see that Colonel before that\r\nlarge flight of steps, with his regiment in battle array; we will go to\r\nhim, and there, before his soldiers, I will summon him to come over to\r\nthe side of duty, and to restore his regiment to the Republic. If he\r\nrefuses ...\"\r\n\r\nCharamaule took his two pistols in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"... I will blow out his brains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charamaule,\" said I, \"I will be by your side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew that well,\" Charamaule said to me.\r\n\r\nHe added,--\r\n\r\n\"This explosion will awaken the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" several cried out, \"suppose it does not awaken them?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am on your side,\" said I to him.\r\n\r\nWe each pressed the other's hand. But objections burst forth.\r\n\r\nNo one trembled, but all criticised the proposal. Would it not be\r\nmadness? And useless madness? Would it not be to play the last card of\r\nthe Republic without any possible chance of success? What good fortune\r\nfor Bonaparte! To crush with one blow all that remained of those who were\r\nresisting and of those who were combating! To finish with them once for\r\nall! We were beaten, granted, but was it necessary to add annihilation to\r\ndefeat? No possible chance of success. The brains of an army cannot be\r\nblown out. To do what Charamaule advised would be to open the tomb,\r\nnothing more. It would be a magnificent suicide, but it would be a\r\nsuicide. Under certain circumstances it is selfish to be merely a hero. A\r\nman accomplishes it at once, he becomes illustrious, he enters into\r\nhistory, all that is very easy. He leaves to others behind him the\r\nlaborious work of a long protest, the immovable resistance of the exile,\r\nthe bitter, hard life of the conquered who continues to combat the\r\nvictory. Some degree of patience forms a part of politics. To know how\r\nto await revenge is sometimes more difficult than to hurry on its\r\ncatastrophe. There are two kinds of courage--bravery and perseverance;\r\nthe first belongs to the soldier, the second belongs to the citizen. A\r\nhap-hazard end, however dauntless, does not suffice. To extricate oneself\r\nfrom the difficulty by death, it is only too easily done: what is\r\nrequired, what is the reverse of easy, is to extricate one's country from\r\nthe difficulty. No, said those high-minded men, who opposed Charamaule\r\nand myself, this to-day which you propose to us is the suppression of\r\nto-morrow; take care, there is a certain amount of desertion in\r\nsuicide....\r\n\r\nThe word \"desertion\" grievously wounded Charamaule. \"Very well,\" said he,\r\n\"I abandon the idea.\"\r\n\r\nThis scene was exceedingly grand, and Quinet later on, when in exile,\r\nspoke to me of it with deep emotion.\r\n\r\nWe separated. We did not meet again.\r\n\r\nI wandered about the streets. Where should I sleep? That was the question.\r\nI thought that No. 19, Rue Richelieu would probably be as much watched as\r\nNo. 15. But the night was cold, and I decided at all hazards to re-enter\r\nthis refuge, although perhaps a hazardous one. I was right to trust myself\r\nto it. I supped on a morsel of bread, and I passed a very good night. The\r\nnext morning at daybreak on waking I thought of the duties which awaited\r\nme. I thought that I was abut to go out, and that I should probably not\r\ncome back to the room; I took a little bread which remained, and I\r\ncrumbled it on the window-sill for the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY CAN HAVE TWO ASPECTS\r\n\r\nHad it been in the power of the Left at any moment to prevent the _coup\r\nd'état_?\r\n\r\nWe do not think so.\r\n\r\nNevertheless here is a fact which we believe we ought not to pass by in\r\nsilence. On the 16th November, 1851, I was in my study at home at 37, Rue\r\nde la Tour d'Auvergne; it was about midnight. I was working. My servant\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Will you see M. ----, sir?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he mentioned a name.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\nSome one came in.\r\n\r\nI shall only speak reservedly of this eminent and distinguished man. Let\r\nit suffice to state that he had the right to say when mentioning the\r\nBonapartes \"my family.\"\r\n\r\nIt is known that the Bonaparte family is divided into two branches, the\r\nImperial family and the private family. The Imperial family had the\r\ntradition of Napoleon, the private family had the tradition of Lucien: a\r\nshade of difference which, however, had no reality about it.\r\n\r\nMy midnight visitor took the other corner of the fireplace.\r\n\r\nHe began by speaking to me of the memoirs of a very highminded and\r\nvirtuous woman, the Princess ----, his mother, the manuscript of which he\r\nhad confided to me, asking my advice as to the utility or the suitability\r\nof their publication; this manuscript, besides being full of interest,\r\npossessed for me a special charm, because the handwriting of the Princess\r\nresembled my mother's handwriting. My visitor, to whom I gave it back,\r\nturned over the leaves for a few moments, and then suddenly interrupting\r\nhimself, he turned to me and said,--\r\n\r\n\"The Republic is lost.\"\r\n\r\nI answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Almost.\"\r\n\r\nHe resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"Unless you save it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he set forth with that clearness, complicated at times with\r\nparadoxes, which is one of the resources of his remarkable mind, the\r\nsituation, at the same time desperate and strong, in which we were\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nThis situation, which moreover I realized as well as he himself, was\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\nThe Right of the Assembly was composed of about 400 members, and the Left\r\nof about 180. The four hundred of the majority belonged by thirds to\r\nthree parties, the Legitimist party, the Orleanist party, the Bonapartist\r\nparty, and in a body to the Clerical party. The 180 of the minority\r\nbelonged to the Republic. The Right mistrusted the Left, and had taken a\r\nprecaution against the minority.\r\n\r\nA Vigilance Committee, composed of sixteen members of the Right, charged\r\nwith impressing unity upon this trinity of parties, and charged with the\r\ntask of carefully watching the Left, such was this precaution. The Left\r\nat first had confined itself to irony, and borrowing from me a word to\r\nwhich people then attached, though wrongly, the idea of decrepitude, had\r\ncalled the sixteen Commissioners the \"Burgraves.\" The irony subsequently\r\nturning into suspicion, the Left had on its side ended by creating a\r\ncommittee of sixteen members to direct the Left, and observe the Right;\r\nthese the Right had hastened to name the \"Red Burgraves.\" A harmless\r\nrejoinder. The result was that the Right watched the Left, and that the\r\nLeft watched the Right, but that no one watched Bonaparte. They were two\r\nflocks of sheep so distrustful of one another that they forgot the wolf.\r\nDuring that time, in his den at the Elysée, Bonaparte was working. He was\r\nbusily employing the time which the Assembly, the majority and the\r\nminority, was losing in mistrusting itself. As people feel the loosening\r\nof the avalanche, so they felt the catastrophe tottering in the gloom.\r\nThey kept watch upon the enemy, but they did not turn their attention in\r\nthe true direction. To know where to fix one's mistrust is the secret of\r\na great politician. The Assembly of 1851 did not possess this shrewd\r\ncertainty of eyesight, their perspective was bad, each saw the future\r\nafter his own fashion, and a sort of political short-sightedness blinded\r\nthe Left as well as the Right; they were afraid, but not where fear was\r\nadvisable; they were in the presence of a mystery, they had an ambuscade\r\nbefore them, but they sought it where it did not exist, and they did not\r\nperceive where it really lay. Thus it was that these two flocks of sheep,\r\nthe majority, and the minority faced each other affrightedly, and while\r\nthe leaders on one side and the guides on the other, grave and attentive,\r\nasked themselves anxiously what could be the mewing of the grumbling, of\r\nthe Left on the one side, of the bleatings of the Right on the other,\r\nthey ran the risk of suddenly feeling the four claws of the _coup d'état_\r\nfastened in their shoulders.\r\n\r\nMy visitor said to me,-\r\n\r\n\"You are one of the Sixteen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered I, smiling; \"a 'Red Burgrave.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Like me, a 'Red Prince.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd his smile responded to mine.\r\n\r\nHe resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"You have full powers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Like the others.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I added,--\r\n\r\n\"Not more than the others. The Left has no leaders.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Yon, the Commissary of Police, is a Republican?'\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would obey an order signed by you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ say, without doubt.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me fixedly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, have the President arrested this night.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now my turn to look at him.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I say.\"\r\n\r\nI ought to state that his language was frank, resolute, and\r\nself-convinced, and that during the whole of this conversation, and now,\r\nand always, it has given me the impression of honesty.\r\n\r\n\"Arrest the President!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nThen he set forth that this extraordinary enterprise was an easy matter;\r\nthat the Army was undecided; that in the Army the African Generals\r\ncounterpoised the President; that the National Guard favored the\r\nAssembly, and in the Assembly the Left; that Colonel Forestier answered\r\nfor the 8th Legion; Colonel Gressier for the 6th, and Colonel Howyne for\r\nthe 5th; that at the order of the Sixteen of the Left there would be an\r\nimmediate taking up of arms; that my signature would suffice; that,\r\nnevertheless, if I preferred to call together the Committee, in Secret\r\nSession, we could wait till the next day; that on the order from the\r\nSixteen, a battalion would march upon the Elysée; that the Elysée\r\napprehended nothing, thought only of offensive, and not of defensive\r\nmeasures, and accordingly would be taken by surprise; that the soldiers\r\nwould not resist the National Guard; that the thing would be done without\r\nstriking a blow; that Vincennes would open and close while Paris slept;\r\nthat the President would finish his night there, and that France, on\r\nawakening, would learn the twofold good tidings: that Bonaparte was out\r\nof the fight, and France out of danger.\r\n\r\nHe added,--\r\n\r\n\"You can count on two Generals: Neumayer at Lyons, and Lawoëstyne at\r\nParis.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and leaned against the chimney-piece; I can still see him\r\nthere, standing thoughtfully; and he continued:\r\n\r\n\"I do not feel myself strong enough to begin exile all over again, but I\r\nfeel the wish to save my family and my country.\"\r\n\r\nHe probably thought he noticed a movement of surprise in me, for he\r\naccentuated and italicized these words.\r\n\r\n\"I will explain myself. Yes; I wish to save my family and my country. I\r\nbear the name of Napoleon; but as you know without fanaticism. I am a\r\nBonaparte, but not a Bonapartist. I respect the name, but I judge it. It\r\nalready has one stain. The Eighteenth Brumaire. Is it about to have\r\nanother? The old stain disappeared beneath the glory; Austerlitz covered\r\nBrumaire. Napoleon was absolved by his genius. The people admired him so\r\ngreatly that it forgave him. Napoleon is upon the column, there is an end\r\nof it, let them leave him there in peace. Let them not resuscitate him\r\nthrough his bad qualities. Let them not compel France to remember too\r\nmuch. This glory of Napoleon is vulnerable. It has a wound; closed, I\r\nadmit. Do not let them reopen it. Whatever apologists may say and do, it\r\nis none the less true that by the Eighteenth of Brumaire Napoleon struck\r\nhimself a first blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" said I, \"it is ever against ourselves that we commit a\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" he continued, \"his glory has survived a first blow, a\r\nsecond will kill it. I do not wish it. I hate the first Eighteenth\r\nBrumaire; I fear the second. I wish to prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused again, and continued,--\r\n\r\n\"That is why I have come to you to-night. I wish to succor this great\r\nwounded glory. By the advice which I am giving you, if you can carry it\r\nout, if the Left carries it out, I save the first Napoleon; for if a\r\nsecond crime is superposed upon his glory, this glory would disappear.\r\nYes, this name would founder, and history would no longer own it. I will\r\ngo farther and complete my idea. I also save the present Napoleon, for he\r\nwho as yet has no glory will only have come. I save his memory from an\r\neternal pillory. Therefore, arrest him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was truly and deeply moved. He resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"As to the Republic, the arrest of Louis Bonaparte is deliverance for\r\nher. I am right, therefore, in saying that by what I am proposing to you\r\nI am saving my family and my country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I said to him, \"what you propose to me is a _coup d'état_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt. We are the minority, and we should commit an act which\r\nbelongs to the majority. We are a part of the Assembly. We should be\r\nacting as though we were the entire Assembly. We who condemn all\r\nusurpation should ourselves become usurpers. We should put our hands upon\r\na functionary whom the Assembly alone has the right of arresting. We, the\r\ndefenders of the Constitution, we should break the Constitution. We, the\r\nmen of the Law, we should violate the Law. It is a _coup d'état_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but a _coup d'état_ for a good purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Evil committed for a good purpose remains evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even when it succeeds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Above all when it succeeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it then becomes an example.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not then approve of the Eighteenth Fructidor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Eighteenth Fructidors prevent Eighteenth Brumaires.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They prepare the way for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But reasons of State exist?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What exists is the Law.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Eighteenth Fructidor has been accepted by exceedingly honest minds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blanqui is in its favor, with Michelet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am against it, with Barbès.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the moral aspect I passed to the practical aspect.\r\n\r\n\"This said,\" resumed I, \"let us examine your plan.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan bristled with difficulties. I pointed them out to him.\r\n\r\n\"Count on the National Guard! Why, General Lawoëstyne had not yet got\r\ncommand of it. Count on the Army? Why, General Neumayer was at Lyons,\r\nand not at Paris. Would he march to the assistance of the Assembly?\r\nWhat did we know about this? As for Lawoëstyne, was he not double-faced?\r\nWere they sure of him? Call to arms the 8th Legion? Forestier was no\r\nlonger Colonel. The 5th and 6th? But Gressier and Howyne were only\r\nlieutenant-colonels, would these legions follow them? Order the\r\nCommissary Yon? But would he obey the Left alone? He was the agent of\r\nthe Assembly, and consequently of the majority, but not of the minority.\r\nThese were so many questions. But these questions, supposing them\r\nanswered, and answered in the sense of success, was success itself the\r\nquestion? The question is never Success, it is always Right. But here,\r\neven if we had obtained success, we should not have Right. In order to\r\narrest the President an order of the Assembly was necessary; we should\r\nreplace the order of the Assembly by an act of violence of the Left. A\r\nscaling and a burglary; an assault by scaling-ladders on the constituted\r\nauthority, a burglary on the Law. Now let us suppose resistance; we\r\nshould shed blood. The Law violated leads to the shedding of blood. What\r\nis all this? It is a crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" he exclaimed, \"it is the _salus populi_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n\"_Suprema Lex_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for me,\" I said.\r\n\r\nI continued,--\r\n\r\n\"I would not kill a child to save a people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cato did so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus did not do so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I added,--\r\n\r\n\"You have on your side all ancient history, you are acting according to\r\nthe uprightness of the Greeks, and according to the uprightness of the\r\nRomans; for me, I am acting according to the uprightness of Humanity.\r\nThe new horizon is of wider range than the old.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. He broke it.\r\n\r\n\"Then he will be the one to attack!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are about to engage in a battle which is almost lost beforehand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this unequal combat can only end for you, Victor Hugo, in death or\r\nexile.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Death is the affair of a moment, but exile is long.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a habit to be learned.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued,--\r\n\r\n\"You will not only be proscribed. You will be calumniated.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a habit already learned.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued,--\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what they are saying already?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that you are irritated against him because he has refused to\r\nmake you a Minister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why you know yourself that--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that it is just the reverse. It is he who has asked you, and it\r\nis you who have refused.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then--\"\r\n\r\n\"They lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter?\"\r\n\r\nHe exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"Thus, you will have caused the Bonapartes to re-enter France, and you\r\nwill be banished from France by a Bonaparte!\"[32]\r\n\r\n\"Who knows,\" said I, \"if I have not committed a fault? This injustice is\r\nperhaps a justice.\"\r\n\r\nWe were both silent. He resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"Could you bear exile?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you live without Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would then go to the seaside?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is grand.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. He broke it.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know what exile is. I do know it. It is terrible. Assuredly,\r\nI would not begin it again. Death is a bourne whence no one comes back,\r\nexile is a place whither no one returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"If necessary,\" I said to him, \"I will go, and I will return to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better die. To quit life is nothing, but to quit one's country--\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said I, \"that is every thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, why accept exile when it is in your power to avoid it? What\r\ndo you place above your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Conscience.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer made him thoughtful. However, he resumed.\r\n\r\n\"But on reflection your conscience will approve of what you will have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you. Because my conscience is so constituted that it puts\r\nnothing above itself. I feel it upon me as the headland can feel the\r\nlighthouse which is upon it. All life is an abyss, and conscience\r\nilluminates it around me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I also,\" he exclaimed--and I affirm that nothing could be more\r\nsincere or more loyal than his tone--\"and I also feel and see my\r\nconscience. It approves of what I am doing. I appear to be betraying\r\nLouis; but I am really doing him a service. To save him from a crime is\r\nto save him. I have tried every means. There only remains this one, to\r\narrest him. In coming to you, in acting as I do, I conspire at the same\r\ntime against him and for him, against his power, and for his honor. What\r\nI am doing is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" I said to him. \"You have a generous and a lofty aim.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"But our two duties are different. I could not hinder Louis Bonaparte\r\nfrom committing a crime unless I committed one myself. I wish neither for\r\nan Eighteenth Brumaire for him, nor for an Eighteenth Fructidor for\r\nmyself. I would rather be proscribed than be a proscriber. I have the\r\nchoice between two crimes, my crime and the crime of Louis Bonaparte. I\r\nwill not choose my crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then you will have to endure his.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather endure a crime than commit one.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained thoughtful, and said to me,--\r\n\r\n\"Let it be so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added,--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we are both in the right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" I said.\r\n\r\nAnd I pressed his hand.\r\n\r\nHe took his mother's manuscript and went away. It was three o'clock in\r\nthe morning. The conversation had lasted more than two hours. I did not\r\ngo to bed until I had written it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[32] 14th of June, 1847. Chamber of Peers. See the work \"Avant l'Exile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMBAT FINISHED, THE ORDEAL BEGINS\r\n\r\nI did not know where to go.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 7th I determined to go back once more to 19, Rue\r\nRichelieu. Under the gateway some one seized my arm. It was Madame D.\r\nShe was waiting for me.\r\n\r\n\"Do not go in,\" she said to me.\r\n\r\n\"Am I discovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nShe added,--\r\n\r\n\"Come.\"\r\n\r\nWe crossed the courtyard, and we went out by a backdoor into the Rue\r\nFontaine Molière; we reached the square of the Palais Royal. The\r\n_fiacres_ were standing there as usual. We got into the first we came\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we to go?\" asked the driver.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me.\r\n\r\nI answered,--\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she said.\r\n\r\nWomen always know where Providence lies.\r\n\r\nAn hour later I was in safety.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th, every day which passed by consolidated the _coup d'état_.\r\nOur defeat was complete, and we felt ourselves abandoned. Paris was like\r\na forest in which Louis Bonaparte was making a _battue_ of the\r\nRepresentatives; the wild beast was hunting down the sportsmen. We heard\r\nthe indistinct baying of Maupas behind us. We were compelled to\r\ndisperse. The pursuit was energetic. We entered into the second phase of\r\nduty--the catastrophe accepted and submitted to. The vanquished became\r\nthe proscribed. Each one of us had his own concluding adventures. Mine\r\nwas what it should have been--exile; death having missed me. I am not\r\ngoing to relate it here, this book is not my biography, and I ought not\r\nto divert to myself any of the attention which it may excite. Besides,\r\nwhat concerns me personally is told in a narrative which is one of the\r\ntestaments of exile.[33]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the relentless pursuit which was directed against us, I\r\ndid not think it my duty to leave Paris as long as a glimmer of hope\r\nremained, and as long as an awakening of the people seemed possible.\r\nMalarmet sent me word in my refuge that a movement would take place at\r\nBelleville on Tuesday the 9th. I waited until the 12th. Nothing stirred.\r\nThe people were indeed dead. Happily such deaths as these, like the\r\ndeaths of the gods, are only for a time.\r\n\r\nI had a last interview with Jules Favre and Michel de Bourges at Madame\r\nDidier's in the Rue de la Ville-Lévêque. It was at night. Bastide came\r\nthere. This brave man said to me,--\r\n\r\n\"You are about to leave Paris; for myself, I remain here. Take me as\r\nyour lieutenant. Direct me from the depths of your exile. Make use of me\r\nas an arm which you have in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will make use of you as of a heart,\" I said to him.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, amidst the adventures which my son Charles relates in his\r\nbook, I succeeded in reaching Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe vanquished are like cinders, Destiny blows upon them and disperses\r\nthem. There was a gloomy vanishing of all the combatants for Right and\r\nfor Law. A tragical disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[33] \"Les Hommes de l'Exile,\" by Charles Hugo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXILED\r\n\r\nThe Crime having succeeded, all hastened to join it. To persist was\r\npossible, to resist was not possible. The situation became more and more\r\ndesperate. One would have said that an enormous wall was rising upon the\r\nhorizon ready to close in. The outlet: Exile.\r\n\r\nThe great souls, the glories of the people, emigrated. Thus there was\r\nseen this dismal sight--France driven out from France.\r\n\r\nBut what the Present appears to lose, the Future gains, the hand which\r\nscatters is also the hand which sows.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives of the Left, surrounded, tracked, pursued, hunted\r\ndown, wandered for several days from refuge to refuge. Those who escaped\r\nfound great difficulty in leaving Paris and France. Madier de Montjan\r\nhad very black and thick eyebrows, he shaved off half of them, cut his\r\nhair, and let his beard grow. Yvan, Pelletier, Gindrier, and Doutre\r\nshaved off their moustaches and beards. Versigny reached Brussels on the\r\n14th with a passport in the name of Morin. Schoelcher dressed himself up\r\nas a priest. This costume became him admirably, and suited his austere\r\ncountenance and grave voice. A worthy priest helped him to disguise\r\nhimself, and lent him his cassock and his band, made him shave off his\r\nwhiskers a few days previously, so that he should not be betrayed by the\r\nwhite trace of his freshly-cut beard, gave him his own passport, and\r\nonly left him at the railway station.[34]\r\n\r\nDe Flotte disguised himself as a servant, and in this manner succeeded\r\nin crossing the frontier at Mouscron. From there he reached Ghent, and\r\nthence Brussels.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 26th, I had returned to the little room,\r\nwithout a fire, which I occupied (No. 9) on the second story of the\r\nHôtel de la Porte-Verte; it was midnight; I had just gone to bed and was\r\nfalling asleep, when a knock sounded at my door. I awoke. I always left\r\nthe key outside. \"Come in,\" I said. A chambermaid entered with a light,\r\nand brought two men whom I did not know. One was a lawyer, of Ghent,\r\nM. ----; the other was De Flotte. He took my two hands and pressed them\r\ntenderly. \"What,\" I said to him, \"is it you?\"\r\n\r\nAt the Assembly De Flotte, with his prominent and thoughtful brow, his\r\ndeep-set eyes, his close-shorn head, and his long beard, slightly turned\r\nback, looked like a creation of Sebastian del Piombo wandering out of\r\nhis picture of the \"Raising of Lazarus;\" and I had before my eyes a\r\nshort young man, thin and pallid, with spectacles. But what he had not\r\nbeen able to change, and what I recognized immediately, was the great\r\nheart, the lofty mind, the energetic character, the dauntless courage;\r\nand if I did not recognize him by his features, I recognized him by the\r\ngrasp of his hand.\r\n\r\nEdgar Quinet was brought away on the 10th by a noble-hearted Wallachian\r\nwoman, Princess Cantacuzène, who undertook to conduct him to the\r\nfrontier, and who kept her word. It was a troublesome task. Quinet had\r\na foreign passport in the name of Grubesko, he was to personate a\r\nWallachian, and it was arranged that he should not know how to speak\r\nFrench, he who writes it as a master. The journey was perilous. They ask\r\nfor passports along all the line, beginning at the terminus. At Amiens\r\nthey were particularly suspicious. But at Lille the danger was great.\r\nThe gendarmes went from carriage to carriage; entered them lantern in\r\nhand, and compared the written descriptions of the travellers with their\r\npersonal appearance. Several who appeared to be suspicious characters\r\nwere arrested, and were immediately thrown into prison. Edgar Quinet,\r\nseated by the side of Madame Cantacuzène awaited the turn of his\r\ncarriage. At length it came. Madame Cantacuzène leaned quickly forward\r\ntowards the gendarmes, and hastened to present her passport, but the\r\ncorporal waved back Madame Cantacuzène's passport saying, \"It is\r\nuseless, Madame. We have nothing to do with women's passports,\" and he\r\nasked Quinet abruptly, \"Your papers?\" Quinet held out his passport\r\nunfolded. The gendarmes said to him, \"Come out of the carriage, so that\r\nwe can compare your description.\" It happened, however, that the\r\nWallachian passport contained no description. The corporal frowned, and\r\nsaid to his subordinates, \"An irregular passport! Go and fetch the\r\nCommissary.\"\r\n\r\nAll seemed lost, but Madame Cantacuzène began to speak to Quinet in the\r\nmost Wallachian words in the world, with incredible assurance and\r\nvolubility, so much so that the gendarme, convinced that he had to deal\r\nwith all Wallachia in person, and seeing the train ready to start,\r\nreturned the passport to Quinet, saying to him, \"There! be off with\r\nyou!\"--a few hours afterwards Edgar Quinet was in Belgium.\r\n\r\nArnauld de l'Ariège also had his adventures. He was a marked man, he had\r\nto hide himself. Arnauld being a Catholic, Madame Arnauld went to the\r\npriest; the Abbé Deguerry slipped out of the way, the Abbé Maret\r\nconsented to conceal him; the Abbé Maret was honest and good. Arnauld\r\nd'Ariège remained hidden for a fortnight at the house of this worthy\r\npriest. He wrote from the Abbé Maret's a letter to the Archbishop of\r\nParis, urging him to refuse the Pantheon, which a decree of Louis\r\nBonaparte took away from France and gave to Rome. This letter angered\r\nthe Archbishop. Arnauld, proscribed, reached Brussels, and there, at the\r\nage of eighteen months, died the \"little Red,\" who on the 3d of December\r\nhad carried the workman's letter to the Archbishop--an angel sent by God\r\nto the priest who had not understood the angel, and who no longer knew\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nIn this medley of incidents and adventures each one had his drama.\r\nCournet's drama was strange and terrible.\r\n\r\nCournet, it may be remembered, had been a naval officer. He was one of\r\nthose men of a prompt, decisive character, who magnetized other men, and\r\nwho on certain extraordinary occasions send an electric shock through a\r\nmultitude. He possessed an imposing air, broad shoulders, brawny arms,\r\npowerful fists, a tall stature, all of which give confidence to the\r\nmasses, and the intelligent expression which gives confidence to the\r\nthinkers. You saw him pass, and you recognized strength; you heard him\r\nspeak, and you felt the will, which is more than strength. When quite a\r\nyouth he had served in the navy. He combined in himself in a certain\r\ndegree--and it is this which made this energetic man, when well directed\r\nand well employed, a means of enthusiasm and a support--he combined the\r\npopular fire and the military coolness. He was one of those natures\r\ncreated for the hurricane and for the crowd, who have begun their study\r\nof the people by their study of the ocean, and who are at their ease in\r\nrevolutions as in tempests. As we have narrated, he took an important\r\npart in the combat. He had been dauntless and indefatigable, he was one\r\nof those who could yet rouse it to life. From Wednesday afternoon\r\nseveral police agents were charged to seek him everywhere, to arrest him\r\nwherever they might find him, and to take him to the Prefecture of the\r\nPolice, where orders had been given to shoot him immediately.\r\n\r\nCournet, however, with his habitual daring, came and went freely in\r\norder to carry on the lawful resistance, even in the quarters occupied\r\nby the troops, shaving off his moustaches as his sole precaution.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday afternoon he was on the boulevards at a few paces from a\r\nregiment of cavalry drawn up in order. He was quietly conversing with\r\ntwo of his comrades of the fight, Huy and Lorrain. Suddenly, he\r\nperceives himself and his companions surrounded by a company of\r\n_sergents de ville_; a man touches his arm and says to him, \"You are\r\nCournet; I arrest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" answers Cournet; \"My name is Lépine.\"\r\n\r\nThe man resumes,--\r\n\r\n\"You are Cournet. Do not you recognize me? Well, then, I recognize you;\r\nI have been, like you, a member of the Socialist Electoral Committee.\"\r\n\r\nCournet looks him in the face, and finds this countenance in his memory.\r\nThe man was right. He had, in fact, formed part of the gathering in the\r\nRue Saint Spire. The police spy resumed, laughing,--\r\n\r\n\"I nominated Eugène Sue with you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was useless to deny it, and the moment was not favorable for\r\nresistance. There were on the spot, as we have said, twenty _sergents de\r\nville_ and a regiment of Dragoons.\r\n\r\n\"I will follow you,\" said Cournet.\r\n\r\nA _fiacre_ was called up.\r\n\r\n\"While I am about it,\" said the police spy, \"come in all three of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe made Huy and Lorrain get in with Cournet, placed them on the front\r\nseat, and seated himself on the back seat by Cournet, and then shouted\r\nto the driver,--\r\n\r\n\"To the Prefecture!\"\r\n\r\nThe _sergents de ville_ surrounded the _fiacre_. But whether by chance\r\nor through confidence, or in the haste to obtain the payment for his\r\ncapture, the man who had arrested Cournet shouted to the coachman, \"Look\r\nsharp, look sharp!\" and the _fiacre_ went off at a gallop.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cournet was well aware that on arriving he would be shot\r\nin the very courtyard of the Prefecture. He had resolved not to go\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAt a turning in the Rue St Antoine he glanced behind, and noticed that\r\nthe _sergents de ville_ only followed the _fiacre_ at a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nNot one of the four men which the _fiacre_ was bearing away had as yet\r\nopened their lips.\r\n\r\nCournet threw a meaning look at his two companions seated in front of\r\nhim, as much as to say, \"We are three; let us take advantage of this to\r\nescape.\" Both answered by an imperceptible movement of the eyes, which\r\npointed out the street full of passers-by, and which said, \"No.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments afterwards the _fiacre_ emerged from the Rue St. Antoine,\r\nand entered the Rue de Fourcy. The Rue de Fourcy is usually deserted, no\r\none was passing down it at that moment.\r\n\r\nCournet turned suddenly to the police spy, and asked him,--\r\n\r\n\"Have you a warrant for my arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but I have my card.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he drew his police agent's card out of his pocket, and showed it to\r\nCournet. Then the following dialogue ensued between these two men,--\r\n\r\n\"This is not regular.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that matter to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no right to arrest me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same, I arrest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here; is it money that you want? Do you wish for any? I have some\r\nwith me; let me escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"A gold nugget as big as your head would not tempt me. You are my finest\r\ncapture, Citizen Cournet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you taking me to?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Prefecture.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will shoot me there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my two comrades?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say 'No.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will go, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I will not go,\" exclaimed Cournet.\r\n\r\nAnd with a movement, unexpected as a flash of lightning, he seized the\r\npolice spy by the throat.\r\n\r\nThe police agent could not utter a cry, he struggled: a hand of bronze\r\nclutched him.\r\n\r\nHis tongue protruded from his mouth, his eyes became hideous, and\r\nstarted from their sockets. Suddenly his head sank down, and reddish\r\nfroth rose from his throat to his lips. He was dead.\r\n\r\nHuy and Lorrain, motionless, and as though themselves thunderstruck,\r\ngazed at this gloomy deed.\r\n\r\nThey did not utter a word. They did not move a limb. The _fiacre_ was\r\nstill driving on.\r\n\r\n\"Open the door!\" Cournet cried to them.\r\n\r\nThey did not stir, they seemed to have become stone.\r\n\r\nCournet, whose thumb was closely pressed in the neck of the wretched\r\npolice spy, tried to open the door with his left hand, but he did not\r\nsucceed, he felt that he could only do it with his right hand, and he\r\nwas obliged to loose his hold of the man. The man fell face forwards,\r\nand sank down on his knees.\r\n\r\nCournet opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Off with you!\" he said to them.\r\n\r\nHuy and Lorrain jumped into the street and fled at the top of their\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe coachman had noticed nothing.\r\n\r\nCournet let them get away, and then, pulling the check string, stopped\r\nthe _fiacre_, got down leisurely, reclosed the door, quietly took forty\r\nsous from his purse, gave them to the coachman, who had not left his\r\nseat, and said to him, \"Drive on.\"\r\n\r\nHe plunged into Paris. In the Place des Victoires he met the\r\nex-Constituent Isidore Buvignier, his friend, who about six weeks\r\npreviously had come out of the Madelonnettes, where he had been confined\r\nfor the matter of the _Solidarité Républicaine_. Buvignier was one of\r\nthe noteworthy figures on the high benches of the Left; fair,\r\nclose-shaven, with a stern glance, he made one think of the English\r\nRoundheads, and he had the bearing rather of a Cromwellian Puritan than\r\nof a Dantonist Man of the Mountain. Cournet told his adventure, the\r\nextremity had been terrible.\r\n\r\nBuvignier shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"You have killed a man,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn \"Marie Tudor,\" I have made Fabiani answer under similar\r\ncircumstances,--\r\n\r\n\"No, a Jew.\"\r\n\r\nCournet, who probably had not read \"Marie Tudor,\" answered,--\r\n\r\n\"No, a police spy.\"\r\n\r\nThen he resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"I have killed a police spy to save three men, one of whom was myself.\"\r\n\r\nCournet was right. They were in the midst of the combat, they were\r\ntaking him to be shot; the spy who had arrested him was, properly\r\nspeaking, an assassin, and assuredly it was a case of legitimate\r\ndefence. I add that this wretch, a democrat for the people, a spy for\r\nthe police, was a twofold traitor. Moreover, the police spy was the\r\njackal of the _coup d'état_, while Cournet was the combatant for the\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\n\"You must conceal yourself,\" said Buvignier; \"come to Juvisy.\"\r\n\r\nBuvignier had a little refuge at Juvisy, which is on the road to\r\nCorbeil. He was known and loved there; Cournet and he reached there that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nBut they had hardly arrived when some peasants said to Buvignier, \"The\r\npolice have already been here to arrest you, and are coming again\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to go back.\r\n\r\nCournet, more in danger than ever, hunted, wandering, pursued, hid\r\nhimself in Paris with considerable difficulty. He remained there till\r\nthe 16th. He had no means of procuring himself a passport. At length, on\r\nthe 16th, some friends of his on the Northern Railway obtained for him a\r\nspecial passport, worded as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Allow M. ----, an Inspector on the service of the Company, to pass.\"\r\n\r\nHe decided to leave the next day, and take the day train, thinking,\r\nperhaps rightly, that the night train would be more closely watched.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, at daybreak, favored by the dim dawn, he glided from street\r\nto street, to the Northern Railway Station. His tall stature was a\r\nspecial source of danger. He, however, reached the station in safety.\r\nThe stokers placed him with them on the tender of the engine of the\r\ntrain, which was about to start. He only had the clothes which he had\r\nworn since the 2d; no clean linen, no trunk, a little money.\r\n\r\nIn December, the day breaks late and the night closes in early, which is\r\nfavorable to proscribed persons.\r\n\r\nHe reached the frontier at night without hindrance. At Neuvéglise he was\r\nin Belgium; he believed himself in safety. When asked for his papers he\r\ncaused himself to be taken before the Burgomaster, and said to him, \"I\r\nam a political refugee.\"\r\n\r\nThe Burgomaster, a Belgian but a Bonapartist--this breed is to be\r\nfound--had him at once reconducted to the frontier by the gendarmes, who\r\nwere ordered to hand him over to the French authorities.\r\n\r\nCournet gave himself up for lost.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian gendarmes took him to Armentières. If they had asked for the\r\nMayor it would have been all at an end with Cournet, but they asked for\r\nthe Inspector of Customs.\r\n\r\nA glimmer of hope dawned upon Cournet.\r\n\r\nHe accosted the Inspector of Customs with his head erect, and shook\r\nhands with him.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian gendarmes had not yet released him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said Cournet to the Custom House officer, \"you are an\r\nInspector of Customs, I am an Inspector of Railways. Inspectors do not\r\neat inspectors. The deuce take it! Some worthy Belgians have taken\r\nfright and sent me to you between four gendarmes. Why, I know not. I am\r\nsent by the Northern Company to relay the ballast of a bridge somewhere\r\nabout here which is not firm. I come to ask you to allow me to continue\r\nmy road. Here is my pass.\"\r\n\r\nHe presented the pass to the Custom House officer, the Custom House\r\nofficer read it, found it according to due form, and said to Cournet,--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Inspector, you are free.\"\r\n\r\nCournet, delivered from the Belgian gendarmes by French authority,\r\nhastened to the railway station. He had friends there.\r\n\r\n\"Quick,\" he said, \"it is dark, but it does not matter, it is even all\r\nthe better. Find me some one who has been a smuggler, and who will help\r\nme to pass the frontier.\"\r\n\r\nThey brought him a small lad of eighteen; fair-haired, ruddy, hardy, a\r\nWalloon[35] and who spoke French.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" said Cournet.\r\n\r\n\"Henry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look like a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless I am a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it you who undertake to guide me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been a smuggler?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am one still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the roads?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I have nothing to do with the roads.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you know then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the passes.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two Custom House lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you pass me across them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are not afraid of the Custom House officers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid of the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Cournet, \"we will take sticks.\"\r\n\r\nThey accordingly armed themselves with big sticks. Cournet gave fifty\r\nfrancs to Henry, and promised him fifty more when they should have\r\ncrossed the second Custom House line.\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, at four o'clock in the morning,\" said Henry.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight.\r\n\r\nThey set out on their way.\r\n\r\nWhat Henry called the \"passes\" another would have called the\r\n\"hindrances.\" They were a succession of pitfalls and quagmires. It had\r\nbeen raining, and all the holes were pools of water.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable footpath wound through an inextricable labyrinth,\r\nsometimes as thorny as a heath, sometimes as miry as a marsh.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, far away in the darkness, they could hear a dog bark.\r\nThe smuggler then made bends or zigzags, turned sharply to the right or\r\nto the left, and sometimes retraced his steps.\r\n\r\nCournet, jumping hedges, striding over ditches, stumbling at every\r\nmoment, slipping into sloughs, laying hold of briers, with his clothes\r\nin rags, his hands bleeding, dying with hunger, battered about, wearied,\r\nworn out, almost exhausted, followed his guide gaily.\r\n\r\nAt every minute he made a false step; he fell into every bog, and got up\r\ncovered with mud. At length he fell into a pond. It was several feet\r\ndeep. This washed him.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" he said. \"I am very clean, but I am very cold.\"\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the morning, as Henry had promised him, they reached\r\nMessine, a Belgian village. The two Custom House lines had been cleared.\r\nCournet had nothing more to fear, either from the Custom House nor from\r\nthe _coup d'état_, neither from men nor from dogs.\r\n\r\nHe gave Henry the second fifty francs, and continued his journey on\r\nfoot, trusting somewhat to chance.\r\n\r\nIt was not until towards evening that he reached a railway station. He\r\ngot into a train, and at nightfall he arrived at the Southern Railway\r\nStation at Brussels.\r\n\r\nHe had left Paris on the preceding morning, had not slept an hour, had\r\nbeen walking all night, and had eaten nothing. On searching in his\r\npocket he missed his pocket book, but found a crust of bread. He was\r\nmore delighted at the discovery of the crust than grieved at the loss of\r\nhis pocket-book. He carried his money in a waistband; the pocket-book,\r\nwhich had probably disappeared in the pond, contained his letters, and\r\namongst others an exceedingly useful letter of introduction from his\r\nfriend M. Ernest Koechlin, to the Representatives Guilgot and Carlos\r\nForel, who at that moment were refugees at Brussels, and lodged at the\r\nHôtel de Brabant.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the railway station he threw himself into a cab, and said to\r\nthe coachman,--\r\n\r\n\"Hôtel de Brabant.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard a voice repeat, \"Hôtel de Brabant.\" He put out his head and saw\r\na man writing something in a notebook with a pencil by the light of a\r\nstreet-lamp.\r\n\r\nIt was probably some police agent.\r\n\r\nWithout a passport, without letters, without papers, he was afraid of\r\nbeing arrested in the night, and he was longing for a good sleep. A good\r\nbed to-night, he thought, and to-morrow the Deluge! At the Hôtel de\r\nBrabant he paid the coachman, but did not go into the hotel. Moreover,\r\nhe would have asked in vain for the Representatives Forel and Guilgot;\r\nboth were there under false names.\r\n\r\nHe took to wandering about the streets. It was eleven o'clock at night,\r\nand for a long time he had begun to feel utterly worn out.\r\n\r\nAt length he saw a lighted lamp with the inscription \"Hôtel de la\r\nMonnaie.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked in.\r\n\r\nThe landlord came up, and looked at him somewhat askance.\r\n\r\nHe then thought of looking at himself.\r\n\r\nHis unshaven beard, his disordered hair, his cap soiled with mud, his\r\nblood-stained hands, his clothes in rags, he looked horrible.\r\n\r\nHe took a double louis out of his waistband, and put it on the table of\r\nthe parlor, which he had entered and said to the landlord,--\r\n\r\n\"In truth, sir, I am not a thief, I am a proscript; money is now my only\r\npassport. I have just come from Paris, I wish to eat first and sleep\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlord was touched, took the double louis, and gave him bed and\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nNext day, while he was still sleeping, the landlord came into his room,\r\nwoke him gently, and said to him,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, if I were you, I should go and see Baron Hody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who and what is Baron Hody?\" asked Cournet, half asleep.\r\n\r\nThe landlord explained to him who Baron Hody was. When I had occasion to\r\nask the same question as Cournet, I received from three inhabitants of\r\nBrussels the three answers as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"He is a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a polecat.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a hyena.\"\r\n\r\nThere is probably some exaggeration in these three answers.\r\n\r\nA fourth Belgian whom I need not specify confined himself to saying to\r\nme,--\r\n\r\n\"He is a beast.\"\r\n\r\nAs to his public functions, Baron Hody was what they call at Brussels\r\n\"The Administrator of Public Safety;\" that is to say, a counterfeit of\r\nthe Prefect of Police, half Carlier, half Maupas.\r\n\r\nThanks to Baron Hody, who has since left the place, and who, moreover,\r\nlike M. de Montalembert, was a \"mere Jesuit,\" the Belgian police at that\r\nmoment was a compound of the Russian and Austrian police. I have read\r\nstrange confidential letters of this Baron Hody. In action and in style\r\nthere is nothing more cynical and more repulsive than the Jesuit police,\r\nwhen they unveil their secret treasures. These are the contents of the\r\nunbuttoned cassock.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which we are speaking (December, 1851), the Clerical\r\nparty had joined itself to all the forms of Monarchy; and this Baron\r\nHody confused Orleanism with Legitimate right. I simply tell the tale.\r\nNothing more.\r\n\r\n\"Baron Hody. Very well, I will go to him,\" said Cournet.\r\n\r\nHe got up, dressed himself, brushed his clothes as well as he could, and\r\nasked the landlord, \"Where is the Police office?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the Ministry of Justice.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact this is the case in Brussels; the police administration forms\r\npart of the Ministry of Justice, an arrangement which does not greatly\r\nraise the police and somewhat lowers justice.\r\n\r\nCournet went there, and was shown into the presence of this personage.\r\n\r\nBaron Hody did him the honor to ask him sharply,--\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A refugee,\" answered Cournet; \"I am one of those whom the _coup d'état_\r\nhas driven from Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Your profession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ex-naval officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ex-naval officer!\" exclaimed Baron Hody in a much gentler tone, \"did\r\nyou know His Royal Highness the Prince de Joinville?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have served under him.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the truth. Cournet had served under M. de Joinville, and prided\r\nhimself on it.\r\n\r\nAt this statement the administrator of Belgian safety completely unbent,\r\nand said to Cournet, with the most gracious smile that the police can\r\nfind, \"That's all right, sir; stay here as long as you please; we close\r\nBelgium to the Men of the Mountain, but we throw it widely open to men\r\nlike you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cournet told me this answer of Hody's, I thought that my fourth\r\nBelgian was right.\r\n\r\nA certain comic gloom was mingled at times with these tragedies.\r\nBarthelémy Terrier was a Representative of the people, and a proscript.\r\nThey gave him a special passport for a compulsory route as far as\r\nBelgium for himself and his wife. Furnished with this passport he left\r\nwith a woman. This woman was a man. Préveraud, a landed proprietor at\r\nDonjon, one of the most prominent men in the Department of Allier, was\r\nTerrier's brother-in-law. When the _coup d'état_ broke out at Donjon,\r\nPréveraud had taken up arms and fulfilled his duty, had combated the\r\noutrage and defended the law. For this he had been condemned to death.\r\nThe justice of that time, as we know. Justice executed justice. For this\r\ncrime of being an honest man they had guillotined Charlet, guillotined\r\nCuisinier, guillotined Cirasse. The guillotine was an instrument of the\r\nreign. Assassination by the guillotine was one of the means of order of\r\nthat time. It was necessary to save Préveraud. He was little and slim:\r\nthey dressed him as a woman. He was not sufficiently pretty for them not\r\nto cover his face with a thick veil. They put the brave and sturdy hands\r\nof the combatant in a muff. Thus veiled and a little filled out with\r\npadding, Préveraud made a charming woman. He became Madame Terrier, and\r\nhis brother-in-law took him away. They crossed Paris peaceably, and\r\nwithout any other adventure than an imprudence committed by Préveraud,\r\nwho, seeing that the shaft-horse of a wagon had fallen down, threw aside\r\nhis muff, lifted his veil and his petticoat, and if Terrier, in dire\r\nalarm, had not stopped him, he would have helped the carter to raise his\r\nhorse. Had a _sergent de ville_ been there, Préveraud would have been\r\ncaptured. Terrier hastened to thrust Préveraud into a carriage, and at\r\nnightfall they left for Brussels. They were alone in the carriage, each\r\nin a corner and face to face. All went well as far as Amiens. At Amiens\r\nstation the door was opened, and a gendarme entered and seated himself\r\nby the side of Préveraud. The gendarme asked for his passport, Terrier\r\nshowed it him; the little woman in her corner, veiled and silent, did\r\nnot stir, and the gendarme found all in due form. He contented himself\r\nwith saying, \"We shall travel together, I am on duty as far as the\r\nfrontier.\"\r\n\r\nThe train, after the ordinary delay of a few minutes, again started. The\r\nnight was dark. Terrier had fallen asleep. Suddenly Préveraud felt a\r\nknee press against his, it was the knee of the policeman. A boot placed\r\nitself softly on his foot, it was a horse-soldier's boot. An idyll had\r\njust germinated in the gendarme's soul. He first tenderly pressed\r\nPréveraud's knee, and then emboldened by the darkness of the hour and by\r\nthe slumbering husband, he ventured his hand as far as her dress, a\r\ncircumstance foreseen by Molière, but the fair veiled one was virtuous.\r\nPréveraud, full of surprise and rage, gently pushed back the gendarme's\r\nhand. The danger was extreme. Too much love on the part of the gendarme,\r\none audacious step further, would bring about the unexpected, would\r\nabruptly change the eclogue into an official indictment, would reconvert\r\nthe amorous satyr into a stony-hearted policeman, would transform Tircis\r\ninto Vidocq; and then this strange thing would be seen, a passenger\r\nguillotined because a gendarme had committed an outrage. The danger\r\nincreased every moment. Terrier was sleeping. Suddenly the train\r\nstopped. A voice cried, \"Quièvrain!\" and the door was opened. They were\r\nin Belgium. The gendarme, obliged to stop here, and to re-enter France,\r\nrose to get out, and at the moment when he stepped on to the ground he\r\nheard behind him these expressive words coming from beneath the lace\r\nveil, \"Be off, or I'll break your jaw!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[34] See \"Les Hommes de l'Exile.\"\r\n\r\n[35] The name given to a population belonging to the Romanic family, and\r\nmore particularly to those of French descent, who occupy the region\r\nalong the frontiers of the German-speaking territory in the South\r\nNetherlands from Dunkirk to Malmedy in Rhenish Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY COMMISSIONS AND THE MIXED COMMISSIONS\r\n\r\nJustice sometime meets with strange adventures.\r\n\r\nThis old phrase assumed a new sense.\r\n\r\nThe code ceased to be a safeguard. The law became something which had\r\nsworn fealty to a crime. Louis Bonaparte appointed judges by whom one\r\nfelt oneself stopped as in the corner of a wood. In the same manner as\r\nthe forest is an accomplice through its density, so the legislation was\r\nan accomplice by its obscurity. What it lacked at certain points in\r\norder to make it perfectly dark they added. How? By force. Purely and\r\nsimply. By decree. _Sic jubeo_. The decree of the 17th of February was a\r\nmasterpiece. This decree completed the proscription of the person, by\r\nthe proscription of the name. Domitian could not have done better. Human\r\nconscience was bewildered; Right, Equity, Reason felt that the master\r\nhad over them the authority that a thief has over a purse. No reply.\r\nObey. Nothing resembles those infamous times.\r\n\r\nEvery iniquity was possible. Legislative bodies supervened and instilled\r\nso much gloom into legislation that it was easy to achieve a baseness in\r\nthis darkness.\r\n\r\nA successful _coup d'état_ does not stand upon ceremony. This kind of\r\nsuccess permits itself everything.\r\n\r\nFacts abound. But we must abridge, we will only present them briefly.\r\n\r\nThere were two species of Justice; the Military Commissions and the\r\nMixed Commissions.\r\n\r\nThe Military Commissions sat in judgment with closed doors. A colonel\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nIn Paris alone there were three Military Commissions: each received a\r\nthousand bills of indictment. The Judge of Instruction sent these\r\naccusations to the Procureur of the Republic, Lascoux, who transmitted\r\nthem to the Colonel President. The Commission summoned the accused to\r\nappear. The accused himself was his own bill of indictment. They\r\nsearched him, that is to say, they \"thumbed\" him. The accusing document\r\nwas short. Two or three lines. Such as this, for example,--\r\n\r\nName. Christian name. Profession. A sharp fellow. Goes to the Café.\r\nReads the papers. Speaks. Dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe accusation was laconic. The judgment was still less prolix. It was a\r\nsimple sign.\r\n\r\nThe bill of indictment having been examined, the judges having been\r\nconsulted, the colonel took a pen, and put at the end of the accusing\r\nline one of three signs:--\r\n\r\n     -     +     o\r\n\r\n     -  signified consignment to Lambessa.\r\n\r\n     +  signified transportation to Cayenne. (The dry guillotine. Death.)\r\n\r\n     o  signified acquittal.\r\n\r\nWhile this justice was at work, the man on whose case they were working\r\nwas sometimes still at liberty, he was going and coming at his ease;\r\nsuddenly they arrested him, and without knowing what they wanted with\r\nhim, he left for Lambessa or for Cayenne.\r\n\r\nHis family was often ignorant of what had become of him.\r\n\r\nPeople asked of a wife, of a sister, of a daughter, of a mother,--\r\n\r\n\"Where is your husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your son?\"\r\n\r\nThe wife, the sister, the daughter, the mother answered,--\"I do not\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Allier eleven members of one family alone, the Préveraud family\r\nof Donjon, were struck down, one by the penalty of death, the others by\r\nbanishment and transportation.\r\n\r\nA wine-seller of the Batignolles, named Brisadoux, was transported to\r\nCayenne for this line in his deed of accusation: _his shop is frequented\r\nby Socialists_.\r\n\r\nHere is a dialogue, word for word, and taken from life, between a\r\ncolonel and his convicted prisoner:--\r\n\r\n\"You are condemned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth I do not exactly know myself. Examine your conscience. Think\r\nwhat you have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have done something.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I have done nothing. I have not even done my duty. I ought to have\r\ntaken my gun, gone down into the street, harangued the people, raised\r\nbarricades; I remained at home stupidly like a sluggard\" (the accused\r\nlaughs); \"that is the offence of which I accuse myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not been condemned for that offence. Think carefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can think of nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You have not been to the _café_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have breakfasted there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not chatted there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not laughed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have laughed.\"\r\n\r\n\"At whom? At what?\"\r\n\r\n\"At what is going on. It is true I was wrong to laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time you talked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the President.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, what may be said with justice, that he had broken his oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he had not the right to arrest the Representatives.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And I added that he had not the right to kill people on the\r\nboulevard....\"\r\n\r\nHere the condemned man interrupted himself and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"And thereupon they send me to Cayenne!\"\r\n\r\nThe judge looks fixedly at the prisoner, and answers,--\"Well, then?\"\r\n\r\nAnother form of justice:--\r\n\r\nThree miscellaneous personages, three removable functionaries, a\r\nPrefect, a soldier, a public prosecutor, whose only conscience is the\r\nsound of Louis Bonaparte's bell, seated themselves at a table and\r\njudged. Whom? You, me, us, everybody. For what crimes? They invented\r\ncrimes. In the name of what laws? They invented laws. What penalties did\r\nthey inflict? They invented penalties. Did they know the accused? No.\r\nDid they listen to him? No. What advocates did they listen to? None.\r\nWhat witnesses did they question? None. What deliberation did they enter\r\nupon? None. What public did they call in? None. Thus, no public, no\r\ndeliberation, no counsellors, no witnesses, judges who are not\r\nmagistrates, a jury where none are sworn in, a tribunal which is not a\r\ntribunal, imaginary offences, invented penalties, the accused absent,\r\nthe law absent; from all these things which resembled a dream there came\r\nforth a reality: the condemnation of the innocent.\r\n\r\nExile, banishment, transportation, ruin, home-sickness, death, and\r\ndespair for 40,000 families.\r\n\r\nThat is what History calls the Mixed Commissions.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the great crimes of State strike the great heads, and content\r\nthemselves with this destruction; they roll like blocks of stone, all in\r\none piece, and break the great resistances; illustrious victims suffice\r\nfor them. But the Second of December had its refinements of cruelty; it\r\nrequired in addition petty victims. Its appetite for extermination\r\nextended to the poor and to the obscure, its anger and animosity\r\npenetrated as far as the lowest class; it created fissures in the social\r\nsubsoil in order to diffuse the proscription there; the local\r\ntriumvirates, nicknamed \"mixed mixtures,\" served it for that. Not one\r\nhead escaped, however humble and puny. They found means to impoverish\r\nthe indigent, to ruin those dying of hunger, to spoil the disinherited;\r\nthe _coup d'état_ achieved this wonderful feat of adding misfortune to\r\nmisery. Bonaparte, it seems, took the trouble to hate a mere peasant;\r\nthe vine-dresser was torn from his vine, the laborer from his furrow,\r\nthe mason from his scaffold, the weaver from his loom. Men accepted this\r\nmission of causing the immense public calamity to fall, morsel by\r\nmorsel, upon the humblest walks of life. Detestable task! To crumble a\r\ncatastrophe upon the little and on the weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RELIGIOUS INCIDENT\r\n\r\nA little religion can be mingled with this justice. Here is an example.\r\n\r\nFrederick Morin, like Arnauld de l'Ariège, was a Catholic Republican. He\r\nthought that the souls of the victims of the 4th of December, suddenly\r\ncast by the volleys of the _coup d'état_ into the infinite and the\r\nunknown, might need some assistance, and he undertook the laborious task\r\nof having a mass said for the repose of these souls. But the priests\r\nwished to keep the masses for their friends. The group of Catholic\r\nRepublicans which Frederick Morin headed applied successively to all the\r\npriests of Paris; but met with a refusal. They applied to the\r\nArchbishop: again a refusal. As many masses for the assassin as they\r\nliked, but far the assassinated not one. To pray for dead men of this\r\nsort would be a scandal. The refusal was determined. How should it be\r\novercome? To do without a mass would have appeared easy to others, but\r\nnot to these staunch believers. The worthy Catholic Democrats with great\r\ndifficulty at length unearthed in a tiny suburban parish a poor old\r\nvicar, who consented to mumble in a whisper this mass in the ear of the\r\nAlmighty, while begging Him to say nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY CAME OUT OF HAM\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 7th and 8th of January, Charras was sleeping. The\r\nnoise of his bolts being drawn awoke him.\r\n\r\n\"So then!\" said he, \"they are going to put us in close confinement.\" And\r\nhe went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards the door was opened. The commandant of the fort\r\nentered in full uniform, accompanied by a police agent carrying a torch.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel,\" said the Commandant, \"dress yourself at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are about to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some more rascality, I suppose!\"\r\n\r\nThe Commandant was silent. Charras dressed himself.\r\n\r\nAs he finished dressing, a short young man, dressed in black, came in.\r\nThis young man spoke to Charras.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, you are about to leave the fortress, you are about to quit\r\nFrance. I am instructed to have you conducted to the frontier.\"\r\n\r\nCharras exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"If I am to quit France I will not leave the fortress. This is yet\r\nanother outrage. They have no more the right to exile me than they had\r\nthe right to imprison me. I have on my side the Law, Right, my old\r\nservices, my commission. I protest. Who are you, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the Private Secretary of the Minister of the Interior.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it is you who are named Léopold Lehon.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\nCharras continued,--\r\n\r\n\"You come on the part of some one whom they call 'Minister of the\r\nInterior,' M. de Morny, I believe. I know M. de Morny. A bald young man;\r\nhe has played the game where people lose their hair; and now he is\r\nplaying the game where people risk their heads.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was painful. The young man was deeply interested in the\r\ntoe of his boot.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, however, he ventured to speak,--\r\n\r\n\"M. Charras, I am instructed to say that if you want money--\"\r\n\r\nCharras interrupted him impetuously.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, sir! not another word. I have served my country\r\nfive-and-twenty years as an officer, under fire, at the peril of my\r\nlife, always for honor, never for gain. Keep your money for your own\r\nset!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence! Money which passes through your hands would soil mine.\"\r\n\r\nAnother pause ensued, which the private secretary again broke,--\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, you will be accompanied by two police agents who have special\r\ninstructions, and I should inform you that you are ordered to travel\r\nwith a false passport, and under the name of Vincent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" said Charras; \"this is really too much. Who is it\r\nimagines that they will make me travel by order with a false passport,\r\nand under a false name?\" And looking steadily at M. Léopold Lehon,\r\n\"Know, sir, that my name is Charras and not Vincent, and that I belong\r\nto a family whose members have always borne the name of their father.\"\r\n\r\nThey set out.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed by carriage as far as Creil, which is on the railway.\r\n\r\nAt Creil station the first person whom Charras saw was General\r\nChangarnier.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it is you, General.\"\r\n\r\nThe two proscripts embraced each other. Such is exile.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce are they doing with you?\" asked the General.\r\n\r\n\"What they are probably doing with you. These vagabonds are making me\r\ntravel under the name of Vincent.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me,\" said Changarnier, \"under the name of Leblanc.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case they ought at least to have called me Lerouge,\" said\r\nCharras, with a burst of laughter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a group, kept at a distance by the police agents, had\r\nformed round them. People had recognized them and saluted them. A little\r\nchild, whose mother could not hold him back, ran quickly to Charras and\r\ntook his hand.\r\n\r\nThey got into the train apparently as free as other travellers. Only\r\nthey isolated them in empty compartments, and each was accompanied by\r\ntwo men, who sat one at the side and the other facing him, and who never\r\ntook their eyes off him. The keepers of General Changarnier were of\r\nordinary strength and stature. Those of Charras were almost giants.\r\nCharras is exceedingly tall; they topped him by an entire head. These\r\nmen who were galley sergeants, had been carabineers; these spies had\r\nbeen heroes.\r\n\r\nCharras questioned them. They had served when quite young, from 1813.\r\nThus they had shared the bivouac of Napoleon; now they ate the same\r\nbread as Vidocq. The soldier brought to such a sorry pass as this is a\r\nsad sight.\r\n\r\nThe pocket of one of them was bulged out with something which he was\r\nhiding there.\r\n\r\nWhen this man crossed the station in company with Charras, a lady\r\ntraveller said,--\r\n\r\n\"Has he got M. Thiers in his pocket?\"\r\n\r\nWhat the police agent was hiding was a pair of pistols. Under their\r\nlong, buttoned-up and doubled-breasted frock coats these men were armed.\r\nThey were ordered to treat \"those gentlemen\" with the most profound\r\nrespect, but in certain circumstances to blow out their brains.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners had each been informed that in the eyes of the different\r\nauthorities whom they would meet on the road they would pass for\r\nforeigners, Swiss or Belgians, expelled on account of their political\r\nopinions, and that the police agents would keep their title of police\r\nagents, and would represent themselves as charged with reconducting\r\nthese foreigners to the frontier.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the journey were accomplished without any hindrance. At\r\nValenciennes an incident occurred.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ having succeeded, zeal reigned paramount. No task was\r\nany longer considered despicable. To denounce was to please; zeal is one\r\nof the forms of servitude towards which people lean the most willingly.\r\nThe general became a common soldier, the prefect became a commissary of\r\npolice, the commissary of police became a police spy.\r\n\r\nThe commissary of police at Valenciennes himself superintended the\r\ninspection of passports. For nothing in the world would he have deputed\r\nthis important office to a subordinate inspector. When they presented\r\nhim the passport of the so-called Leblanc, he looked the so-called\r\nLeblanc full in the face, started, and exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"You are General Changarnier!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no affair of mine,\" said the General.\r\n\r\nUpon this the two keepers of the General protested and exhibited their\r\npapers, perfectly drawn up in due form.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Commissary, we are Government agents. Here are our proper\r\npassports.\"\r\n\r\n\"Improper ones,\" said the General.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary shook his head. He had been employed in Paris, and had\r\nbeen frequently sent to the headquarters of the staff at the Tuileries,\r\nto General Changarnier. He knew him very well.\r\n\r\n\"This is too much!\" exclaimed the police agents. They blustered,\r\ndeclared that they were police functionaries on a special service, that\r\nthey had instructions to conduct to the frontier this Leblanc, expelled\r\nfor political reasons, swore by all the gods, and gave their word of\r\nhonor that the so-called Leblanc was really named Leblanc.\r\n\r\n\"I do not much believe in words of honor,\" said the Commissary.\r\n\r\n\"Honest Commissary,\" muttered Changarnier, \"you are right. Since the 2d\r\nof December words of honor and oaths are no more than worthless paper\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he began to smile.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary became more and more perplexed. The police agents ended\r\nby invoking the testimony of the prisoner himself.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, tell him your name yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out of the difficulty yourselves,\" answered Changarnier.\r\n\r\nAll this appeared most irregular to the mind of a provincial alguazil.\r\n\r\nIt seemed evident to the Commissary of Valenciennes that General\r\nChangarnier was escaping from Ham under a false name with a false\r\npassport, and with false agents of police, in order to mislead the\r\nauthorities, and that it was a plot to escape which was on the point of\r\nsucceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Come down, all three of you!\" exclaimed the Commissary.\r\n\r\nThe General gets down, and on putting foot to the ground notices Charras\r\nin the depths of his compartment between his two bullies.\r\n\r\n\"Oho! Charras, you are there!\" he cries.\r\n\r\n\"Charras!\" exclaimed the Commissary. \"Charras there! Quick! the\r\npassports of these gentlemen!\" And looking Charras in the face,--\r\n\r\n\"Are you Colonel Charras?\"\r\n\r\n\"Egad!\" said Charras.\r\n\r\nYet another complication. It was now the turn of Charras's bullies to\r\nbluster. They declared that Charras was the man called Vincent,\r\ndisplayed passports and papers, swore and protested. The Commissary's\r\nsuspicions were fully confirmed.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said he, \"I arrest everybody.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he handed over Changarnier, Charras, and the four police agents to\r\nthe gendarmes. The Commissary saw the Cross of Honor shining in the\r\ndistance. He was radiant.\r\n\r\nThe police arrested the police. It happens sometimes that the wolf\r\nthinks he has seized a victim and bites his own tail.\r\n\r\nThe six prisoners--for now there were six prisoners--were taken into a\r\nparlor at the railway station. The Commissary informed the town\r\nauthorities. The town authorities hastened hither, headed by the\r\nsub-prefect.\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect, who was named Censier, comes in, and does not know\r\nwhether he ought to salute or to question, to grovel in the dust or to\r\nkeep his hat on his head. These poor devils of magistrates and local\r\nofficials were very much exercised in their minds. General Changarnier\r\nhad been too near the Dictatorship not to make them thoughtful. Who can\r\nforesee the course of events? Everything is possible. Yesterday called\r\nitself Cavaignac, to-day calls itself Bonaparte, to-morrow may call\r\nitself Changarnier. Providence is really cruel not to let sub-prefects\r\nhave a peep at the future.\r\n\r\nIt is sad for a respectable functionary, who would ask for nothing\r\nbetter than to be servile or arrogant according to circumstances, to be\r\nin danger of lavishing his platitudes on a person who is perhaps going\r\nto rot forever in exile, and who is nothing more than a rascal, or to\r\nrisk being insolent to a vagabond of a postscript who is capable of\r\ncoming back a conqueror in six months' time, and of becoming the\r\nGovernment in his turn. What was to be done? And then they were spied\r\nupon. This takes place between officials. The slightest word would be\r\nmaliciously interpreted, the slightest gesture would be laid to their\r\ndiscredit. How should he keep on good terms at the same time this\r\nCabbage, which is called To-day, and that Goat, which is called\r\nTo-morrow? To ask too many questions would offend the General, to render\r\nto many salutations would annoy the President. How could he be at the\r\nsame time very much a sub-prefect, and in some degree a lacquey? How\r\ncould he combine the appearance of obsequiousness, which would please\r\nChangarnier, with the appearance of authority, which would please\r\nBonaparte?\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect thought to get out of the difficulty by saying,\r\n\"General, you are my prisoner,\" and by adding, with a smile, \"Do me the\r\nhonor of breakfasting with me?\" He addressed the same words to Charras.\r\n\r\nThe General refused curtly.\r\n\r\nCharras looked at him fixedly, and did not answer him.\r\n\r\nDoubts regarding the identity of the prisoners came to the mind of the\r\nsub-prefect. He whispered to the Commissary \"Are you quite sure?\"\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the Commissary.\r\n\r\nThe sub-prefect decided to address himself to Charras, and dissatisfied\r\nwith the manner in which his advances had been received, asked him\r\nsomewhat sharply, \"But, in short, who are you?\"\r\n\r\nCharras answered, \"We are packages.\"\r\n\r\nAnd turning to his keepers who were now in their turn in keeping:--\r\n\r\n\"Apply to our exporters. Ask our Custom House officers. It is a mere\r\nmatter of goods traffic.\"\r\n\r\nThey set the electric telegraph to work. Valenciennes, alarmed,\r\nquestioned Paris. The sub-prefect informed the Minister of the Interior\r\nthat, thanks to a strict supervision, which he had trusted to no one but\r\nhimself, he had just effected an important capture, that he had just\r\ndiscovered a plot, had saved the President, had saved society, had saved\r\nreligion, etc., that in one word he had just arrested General\r\nChangarnier and Colonel Charras, who had escaped that morning from the\r\nfort of Ham with false passports, doubtless for the purpose of heading a\r\nrising, etc., and that, in short, he asked the Government what was to be\r\ndone with the two prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour the answer arrived:--\"Let them go on their way.\"\r\n\r\nThe police perceived that in a burst of zeal they had pushed profundity\r\nto the point of stupidity. That sometimes happens.\r\n\r\nThe next train carried away the prisoners, restored, not to liberty, but\r\nto their keepers.\r\n\r\nThey passed Quiévrain.\r\n\r\nThey got down from the carriage, and got in again.\r\n\r\nWhen the train again started Charras heaved the deep, joyous sigh of a\r\nfreed man, and said, \"At last!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes, and perceived his two jailers by his side.\r\n\r\nThey had got up behind him into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" he said to them; \"you there!\"\r\n\r\nOf these two men there was only one who spoke, that one answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are keeping watch over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are in Belgium.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Belgium is not France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose I put my head out of the carriage? Suppose I call out?\r\nSuppose I had you arrested? Suppose I reclaimed my liberty?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not do all that, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will you prevent me?\"\r\n\r\nThe police agent showed the butt-end of his pistol and said \"Thus.\"\r\n\r\nCharras burst out laughing, and asked them, \"Where then are you going to\r\nleave me?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Brussels.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, that at Brussels you will salute me with your cap; but\r\nthat at Mons you will salute me with your pistol.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you say, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" said Charras, \"it does not matter to me. It is King\r\nLeopold's business. The Bonaparte treats countries as he has treated the\r\nRepresentatives. He has violated the Assembly, he violates Belgium. But\r\nall the same, you are a medley of strange rascals. He who is at the top\r\nis a madman, those who are beneath are blockheads. Very well, my\r\nfriends, let me go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAlmost the same incident happened nearly at the same moment to Generals\r\nChangarnier and Lamoricière and to M. Baze.\r\n\r\nThe police agents did not leave General Changarnier until they had\r\nreached Mons. There they made him get down from the train, and said to\r\nhim, \"General, this is your place of residence. We leave you free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"this is my place of residence, and I am free? Well,\r\nthen, good-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sprang lightly back into the carriage just as the train was\r\nstarting, leaving behind him two galley sergeants dumfounded.\r\n\r\nThe police released Charras at Brussels, but did not release General\r\nLamoricière. The two police agents wished to compel him to leave\r\nimmediately for Cologne. The General, who was suffering from rheumatism\r\nwhich he had caught at Ham, declared that he would sleep at Brussels.\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" said the police agents.\r\n\r\nThey followed him to the Hôtel de Bellevue. They spent the night there\r\nwith him. He had considerable difficulty to prevent them from sleeping\r\nin his room. Next day they carried him off, and took him to\r\nCologne-violating Prussian territory after having violated Belgian\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ was still more impudent with M. Baze.\r\n\r\nThey made M. Baze journey with his wife and his children under the name\r\nof Lassalle. He passed for the servant of the police agent who\r\naccompanied him.\r\n\r\nThey took him thus to Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\nThere, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the street, the\r\npolice agents deposited him and the whole of his family, without a\r\npassport, without papers, without money. M. Baze, indignant, was obliged\r\nto have recourse to threats to induce them to take him and identify him\r\nbefore a magistrate. It was, perhaps, part of the petty joys of\r\nBonaparte to cause a Questor of the Assembly to be treated as a vagrant.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 7th of January, General Bedeau, although he was not\r\nto leave till the next day, was awakened like the others by the noise of\r\nbolts. He did not understand that they were shutting him in, but on the\r\ncontrary, believed that they were releasing M. Baze, his neighbor in the\r\nadjoining cell. He cried through the door, \"Bravo, Baze!\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, every day the Generals said to the Questor, \"You have no\r\nbusiness here, this is a military fortress. One of these fine mornings\r\nyou will be thrust outside like Roger du Nord.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless General Bedeau heard an unusual noise in the fortress. He\r\ngot up and \"knocked\" for General Leflô, his neighbor in the cell on the\r\nother side, with whom he exchanged frequent military dialogues, little\r\nflattering to the _coup d'état_. General Leflô answered the knocking,\r\nbut he did not know any more than General Bedeau.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bedeau's window looked out on the inner courtyard of the prison.\r\nHe went to this window and saw lanterns flashing hither and thither,\r\nspecies of covered carts, horsed, and a company of the 48th under arms.\r\nA moment afterwards he saw General Changarnier come into the courtyard,\r\nget into a carriage, and drive off. Some moments elapsed, then he saw\r\nCharras pass. Charras noticed him at the window, and cried out to him,\r\n\"Mons!\"\r\n\r\nIn fact he believed he was going to Mons, and this made General Bedeau,\r\non the next day, choose Mons as his residence, expecting to meet Charras\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nCharras having left, M. Léopold Lehon came in accompanied by the\r\nCommandant of the fort. He saluted Bedeau, explained his business, and\r\ngave his name. General Bedeau confined himself to saying, \"They banish\r\nus; it is an illegality, and one more indignity added to the others.\r\nHowever, with the people who send you one is no longer surprised at\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not send him away till the next day. Louis Bonaparte had said,\r\n\"We must 'space out' the Generals.\"\r\n\r\nThe police agent charged with escorting General Bedeau to Belgium was\r\none of those who, on the 2d of December, had arrested General Cavaignac.\r\nHe told General Bedeau that they had had a moment of uneasiness when\r\narresting General Cavaignae: the picket of fifty men, which had been\r\ntold off to assist the police having failed them.\r\n\r\nIn the compartment of the railway carriage which was taking General\r\nBedeau into Belgium there was a lady, manifestly belonging to good\r\nsociety, of very distinguished appearance, and who was accompanied by\r\nthree little children. A servant in livery, who appeared to be a German,\r\nhad two of the children on his knees, and lavished a thousand little\r\nattentions on them. However, the General, hidden by the darkness, and\r\nmuffled up, like the police agents, in the collar of his mantle, paid\r\nlittle attention to this group. When they reached Quièvrain, the lady\r\nturned to him and said, \"General, I congratulate you, you are now in\r\nsafety.\"\r\n\r\nThe General thanked her, and asked her name.\r\n\r\n\"Baroness Coppens,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that it was at M. Coppens's house, 70, Rue Blanche,\r\nthat the first meeting of the Left had taken place on December 2d.\r\n\r\n\"You have charming children there, madam,\" said the General, \"and,\" he\r\nadded, \"an exceedingly good servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my husband,\" said Madame Coppens.\r\n\r\nM. Coppens, in fact, had remained five weeks buried in a hiding-place\r\ncontrived in his own house. He had escaped from France that very night\r\nunder the cover of his own livery. They had carefully taught their\r\nchildren their lesson. Chance had made them get into the same carriage\r\nas General Bedeau and the two bullies who were keeping guard over him,\r\nand throughout the night Madame Coppens had been in terror lest, in the\r\npresence of the policeman, one of the little ones awakening, should\r\nthrow its arms around the neck of the servant and cry \"Papa!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RETROSPECT\r\n\r\nLouis Bonaparte had tested the majority as engineers test a bridge; he\r\nhad loaded it with iniquities, encroachments, enormities, slaughters on\r\nthe Place du Havre, cries of \"Long live the Emperor,\" distributions of\r\nmoney to the troops, sales of Bonapartist journals in the streets,\r\nprohibition of Republican and parliamentary journals, reviews at Satory,\r\nspeeches at Dijon; the majority bore everything.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said he, \"It will carry the weight of the _coup d'état_.\"\r\n\r\nLet us recall the facts. Before the 2d of December the _coup d'état_ was\r\nbeing constructed in detail, here and there, a little everywhere, with\r\nexceeding impudence, and yet the majority smiled. The Representative\r\nPascal Duprat had been violently treated by police agents. \"That is very\r\nfunny,\" said the Right. The Representative Dain was seized. \"Charming.\"\r\nThe Representative Sartin was arrested. \"Bravo.\" One fine morning when\r\nall the hinges had been well tested and oiled, and when all the wires\r\nwere well fixed, the _coup d'état_ was carried out all at once,\r\nabruptly. The majority ceased to laugh, but the trick, was done. It had\r\nnot perceived that for a long time past, while it was laughing at the\r\nstrangling of others, the cord was round its own neck.\r\n\r\nLet us maintain this, not to punish the past, but to illuminate the\r\nfuture. Many months before being carried out, the _coup d'état_ had been\r\naccomplished. The day having come, the hour having struck, the mechanism\r\nbeing completely wound up, it had only to be set going. It was bound not\r\nto fail, and nothing did fail. What would have been an abyss if the\r\nmajority had done its duty, and had understood its joint responsibility\r\nwith the Left, was not even a ditch. The inviolability had been\r\ndemolished by those who were inviolable. The hand of gendarmes had\r\nbecome as accustomed to the collar of the Representatives as to the\r\ncollar of thieves: the white tie of the statesman was not even rumpled\r\nin the grasp of the galley sergeants, and one can admire the Vicomte de\r\nFalloux--oh, candor!--for being dumfounded at being treated like Citizen\r\nSartin.\r\n\r\nThe majority, going backwards, and ever applauding Bonaparte, fell into\r\nthe hole which Bonaparte had dug for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT OF THE LEFT\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Republican Left in this grave crisis of the 2d of\r\nDecember was memorable.\r\n\r\nThe flag of the Law was on the ground, in the mire of universal treason,\r\nunder the feet of Louis Bonaparte; the Left raised this flag, washed\r\naway the mire with its blood, unfurled it, waved it before the eyes of\r\nthe people, and from the 2d to the 5th of December held Bonaparte at\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nA few men, a mere handful, 120 Representatives of the people escaped by\r\nchance from arrest, plunged in darkness and in silence, without even\r\npossessing that cry of the free press which sounds the tocsin to human\r\nintellects, and which encourages the combatants, without generals under\r\ntheir orders, without soldiers, without ammunition, went down into the\r\nstreets, resolutely barred the way against the _coup d'état_, and gave\r\nbattle to this monstrous crime, which had taken all its precautions,\r\nwhich was mail-clad in every part, armed to the teeth, crowding round it\r\nforests of bayonets, and making a pack of mortars and cannons give\r\ntongue in its favor.\r\n\r\nThey had that presence of mind, which is the most practical kind of\r\ncourage; they had, while lacking everything else, the formidable\r\nimprovisation of duty, which never loses heart. They had no\r\nprinting-offices, they obtained them; they had no guns, they found them;\r\nthey had no balls, they cast them; they had no powder, they manufactured\r\nit; they had nothing but paving-stones, and from thence they evolved\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nIt is true that these paving-stones were the paving-stones of Paris,\r\nstones which change themselves into men.\r\n\r\nSuch is the power of Right, that, during four days these hundred and\r\ntwenty men, who had nothing in their favor but the goodness of their\r\ncause, counterbalanced an army of 100,000 soldiers. At one moment the\r\nscale turned on their side. Thanks to them, thanks to their resistance,\r\nseconded by the indignation of honest hearts, there came an hour when\r\nthe victory of the law seemed possible, and even certain. On Thursday,\r\nthe 4th, the _coup d'état_ tottered, and was obliged to support itself\r\nby assassination. We seen that without the butchery of the boulevards,\r\nif he had not saved his perjury by a massacre, if he had not sheltered\r\nhis crime by another crime, Louis Bonaparte was lost.\r\n\r\nDuring the long hours of this struggle, a struggle without a truce, a\r\nstruggle against the army during the day and against the police during\r\nthe night,--an unequal struggle, where all the strength and all the rage\r\nwas on one side, and, as we have just said, nothing but Right on the\r\nother, not one of these hundred and twenty Representatives, not a single\r\none failed at the call of duty, not one shunned the danger, not one drew\r\nback, not one wearied,--all these heads placed themselves resolutely\r\nunder the axe, and for four days waited for it to fall.\r\n\r\nTo-day captivity, transportation, expatriation, exile, the axe has\r\nfallen on nearly all these heads.\r\n\r\nI am one of those who have had no other merit in this struggle than to\r\nrally into one unique thought the courage of all; but let me here\r\nheartily render justice to those men amongst whom I pride myself with\r\nhaving for three years served the holy cause of human progress, to this\r\nLeft, insulted, calumniated, unappreciated, and dauntless, which was\r\nalways in the breach, and which did not repose for a single day, which\r\nrecoiled none the more before the military conspiracy than before the\r\nparliamentary conspiracy, and which, entrusted by the people with the\r\ntask of defending them, defended them even when abandoned by themselves;\r\ndefended them in the tribune with speech, and in the street with the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee of Resistance in the sitting at which the decree of\r\ndeposition and of outlawry was drawn up and voted, making use of the\r\ndiscretionary power which the Left had confided to it, decided that all\r\nthe signatures of the Republican Representatives remaining at liberty\r\nshould be placed at the foot of the decree, it was a bold stroke; the\r\nCommittee did not conceal from itself that it was a list of proscription\r\noffered to the victorious _coup d'état_ ready drawn up, and perhaps in\r\nits inner conscience it feared that some would disavow it, and protest\r\nagainst it. As a matter of fact, the next day we received two letters,\r\ntwo complaints. They were from two Representatives who had been omitted\r\nfrom the list, and who claimed the honor of being reinstated there. I\r\nreinstate these two Representatives here, in their right of being\r\nproscripts. Here are their names--Anglade and Pradié.\r\n\r\nFrom Tuesday, the 2d, to Friday, the 5th of December, the\r\nRepresentatives of the Left and the Committee, dogged, worried, hunted\r\ndown, always on the point of being discovered and taken, that is to\r\nsay--massacred; repaired for the purpose of deliberating, to\r\ntwenty-seven different houses, shifted twenty-seven times their place of\r\nmeeting, from their first gathering in the Rue Blanche to their last\r\nconference at Raymond's. They refused the shelters which were offered\r\nthem on the left bank of the river, wishing always to remain in the\r\ncentre of the combat. During these changes they more than once traversed\r\nthe right bank of Paris from one end to the other, most of the time on\r\nfoot, and making long circuits in order not to be followed. Everything\r\nthreatened them with danger; their number, their well-known faces, even\r\ntheir precautions. In the populous streets there was danger, the police\r\nwere permanently posted there; in the lonely streets there was danger,\r\nbecause the goings and comings were more noticed there.\r\n\r\nThey did not sleep, they did not eat, they took what they could find, a\r\nglass of water from time to time, a morsel of bread here and there.\r\nMadame Landrin gave us a basin of soup, Madame Grévy the remainder of a\r\ncold pie. We dined one evening on a little chocolate which a chemist had\r\ndistributed in a barricade. At Jeunesse's, in the Rue de Grammont,\r\nduring the night of the 3rd, Michel de Bourges took a chair, and said,\r\n\"This is my bed.\" Were they tired? They did not feel it. The old men,\r\nlike Ronjat, the sick, like Boysset, all went forward. The public peril,\r\nlike a fever, sustained them.\r\n\r\nOur venerable colleague, Lamennais, did not come, but he remained three\r\ndays without going to bed, buttoned up in his old frock coat, his thick\r\nboots on his feet, ready to march. He wrote to the author these three\r\nlines, which it is impossible not to quote:--\"You are heroes without me.\r\nThis pains me greatly. I await your orders. Try, then, to find me\r\nsomething to do, be it but to die.\"\r\n\r\nIn these meetings each man preserved his usual demeanor. At times one\r\nmight have thought it an ordinary sitting in one of the bureaux of the\r\nAssembly. There was the calm of every day, mingled with the firmness of\r\ndecisive crises. Edgar Quinet retained all his lofty judgment, Noël\r\nParfait all his mental vivacity, Yvan all his vigorous and intelligent\r\npenetration, Labrousse all his animation. In a corner Pierre Lefranc,\r\npamphleteer and ballad-writer, but a pamphleteer like Courier, and a\r\nballad-writer like Béranger smiled at the grave and stern words of\r\nDupont de Bussac. All that brilliant group of young orators of the Left,\r\nBaneel with his powerful ardor, Versigny and Victor Chauffour with their\r\nyouthful daring. Sain with his coolheadedness which reveals strength,\r\nFarconnet with his gentle voice and his energetic inspiration, lavishing\r\nhis efforts in resisting the _coup d'état_, sometimes taking part in the\r\ndeliberations, at others amongst the people, proving that to be an\r\norator one must possess all the qualifications of a combatant. De\r\nFlotte, indefatigable, was ever ready to traverse all Paris. Xavier\r\nDurrieu was courageous, Dulac dauntless, Charamaule fool-hardy. Citizens\r\nand Paladins. Courage! who would have dared to exhibit none amongst all\r\nthese men, of whom not one trembled? Untrimmed beards, torn coats,\r\ndisordered hair, pale faces, pride glistening in every eye. In the\r\nhouses where they were received they installed themselves as best they\r\ncould. If there were no sofas or chairs, some, exhausted in strength,\r\nbut not in heart, seated themselves on the floor. All became copyists of\r\nthe decrees and proclamations; one dictated, ten wrote. They wrote on\r\ntables, on the corners of furniture, on their knees. Frequently paper\r\nwas lacking, pens were wanting. These wretched trifles created obstacles\r\nat the most critical times. At certain moments in the history of peoples\r\nan inkstand where the ink is dried up may prove a public calamity.\r\nMoreover, cordiality prevailed among all, all shades of difference were\r\neffaced. In the secret sittings of the Committee Madier de Montjau, that\r\nfirm and generous heart, De Flotte, brave and thoughtful, a fighting\r\nphilosopher of the Devolution, Carnot, accurate, cold, tranquil,\r\nimmovable, Jules Favre, eloquent, courageous, admirable through his\r\nsimplicity and his strength, inexhaustible in resources as in sarcasms,\r\ndoubled, by combining them, the diverse powers of their minds.\r\n\r\nMichel de Bourges, seated in a corner of the fireplace, or leaning on a\r\ntable enveloped in his great coat, his black silk cap on his head, had\r\nan answer for every suggestion, gave back to occurrences blow for blow,\r\nwas on his guard for danger, difficulty, opportunity, necessity, for his\r\nis one of those wealthy natures which have always something ready either\r\nin their intellect or in their imagination. Words of advice crossed\r\nwithout jostling each other. These men entertained no illusion. They\r\nknew that they had entered into a life-and-death struggle. They had no\r\nquarter to expect. They had to do with the Man who had said, \"Crush\r\neverything.\" They knew the bloody words of the self-styled Minister,\r\nMerny. These words the placards of Saint-Arnaud interpreted by decrees,\r\nthe Praetorians let loose in the street interpreted them by murder. The\r\nmembers of the Insurrectionary Committee and the Representatives\r\nassisting at the meetings were not ignorant that wherever they might be\r\ntaken they would be killed on the spot by bayonet-thrusts. It was the\r\nfortune of this war. Yet the prevailing expression on every face was\r\nserenity; that profound serenity which comes from a happy conscience. At\r\ntimes this serenity rose to gaiety. They laughed willingly and at\r\neverything. At the torn trousers of one, at the hat which another had\r\nbrought back from the barricade instead of his own, at the comforter of\r\na third. \"Hide your big body,\" they said to him. They were children, and\r\neverything amused them. On the morning of the 4th Mathien de la Drôme\r\ncame in. He had organized for his part a committee which communicated\r\nwith the Central Committee, he came to tell us of it. He had shaved off\r\nhis fringe of beard so as not to be recognized in the streets. \"You look\r\nlike an Archbishop,\" said Michel de Bourges to him, and there was a\r\ngeneral laugh. And all this, with this thought which every moment\r\nbrought back; the noise which is heard at the door, the key which turns\r\nin the lock is perhaps Death coming in.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives and the Committee were at the mercy of chance. More\r\nthan once they could have been captured, and they were not; either owing\r\nto the scruples of certain police agents (where the deuce will scruples\r\nnext take up their abode?) or that these agents doubted the final\r\nresult, and feared to lay their hand heedlessly upon possible victors.\r\nIf Vassal, the Commissary of Police, who met us on the morning of the\r\n4th, on the pavement of the Rue des Moulins, had wished, we might have\r\nbeen taken that day. He did not betray us. But these were exceptions.\r\nThe pursuit of the police was none the less ardent and implacable. At\r\nMarie's, it may be remembered that the _sergents de ville_ and the\r\ngendarmes arrived ten minutes after we had left the house, and that they\r\neven ransacked under the beds with their bayonets.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Representatives there were several Constituents, and at\r\ntheir head Bastide. Bastide, in 1848, had been Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs. During the second night, meeting in the Rue Popincourt, they\r\nreproached him with several of his actions. \"Let me first get myself\r\nkilled,\" he answered, \"and then you can reproach me with what you like.\"\r\nAnd he added, \"How can you distrust me, who am a Republican up to the\r\nhilt?\" Bastide would not consent to call our resistance the\r\n\"insurrection,\" he called it the \"counter-insurrection.\" he said,\r\n\"Victor Hugo is right. The insurgent is at the Elysée.\" It was my\r\nopinion, as we have seen, that we ought to bring the battle at once to\r\nan issue, to defer nothing, to reserve nothing; I said, \"We must strike\r\nthe _coup d'état_ while it is hot.\" Bastide supported me. In the combat\r\nhe was impassive, cold, gay beneath his coldness. At the Saint Antoine\r\nbarricade, at the moment when the guns of the _coup d'état_ were leveled\r\nat the Representatives of the people, he said smilingly to Madier de\r\nMontjau, \"Ask Schoelcher what he thinks of the abolition of the penalty\r\nof death.\" (Schoelcher, like myself, at this supreme moment, would have\r\nanswered, \"that it ought to be abolished\") In another barricade Bastide,\r\ncompelled to absent himself for a moment, placed his pipe on a\r\npaving-stone. They found Bastide's pipe, and they thought him dead. He\r\ncame back, and it was hailing musket-balls; he said, \"My pipe?\" he\r\nrelighted it and resumed the fight. Two balls pierced his coat.\r\n\r\nWhen the barricades were constructed, the Republican Representatives\r\nspread themselves abroad; and distributed themselves amongst them.\r\nNearly all the Representatives of the Left repaired to the barricades,\r\nassisting either to build them or to defend them. Besides the great\r\nexploit at Saint Antoine barricade, where Schoelcher was so admirable,\r\nEsquiros went to the barricade of the Rue de Charonne, De Flotte to\r\nthose of the Pantheon and of the Chapelle Saint Denis, Madier de\r\nMontjau to those of Belleville and the Rue Aumaire, Doutre and Pelletier\r\nto that of the Mairie of the Fifth Arrondissement, Brives to that of Rue\r\nBeaubourg, Arnauld de l'Ariège to that of Rue de Petit-Repîsoir, Viguier\r\nto that of the Rue Pagevin, Versigny to that of the Rue Joigneaux;\r\nDupont de Bussac to that of the Carré Saint Martin; Carlos Forel and\r\nBoysset to that of the Rue Rambuteau. Doutre received a sword-cut on his\r\nhead, which cleft his hat; Bourzat had four balls in his overcoat;\r\nBaudin was killed; Gaston Dussoubs was ill and could not come; his\r\nbrother, Denis Dussoubs, replaced him. Where? In the tomb.\r\n\r\nBaudin fell on the first barricade, Denis Dussoubs on the last.\r\n\r\nI was less favored than Bourzat; I only had three balls in my overcoat,\r\nand it is impossible for me to say whence they came. Probably from the\r\nboulevard.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle was lost there was no general helter-skelter, no rout,\r\nno flight. All remained hidden in Paris ready to reappear, Michel in the\r\nRue d'Alger, myself in the Rue de Navarin. The Committee held yet\r\nanother sitting on Saturday, the 6th, at eleven o'clock at night. Jules\r\nFavre, Michel de Bourges, and myself, we came during the night to the\r\nhouse of a generous and brave woman, Madame Didier. Bastide came there\r\nand said to me, \"If you are not killed here, you are going to enter upon\r\nexile. For myself, I am going to remain in Paris. Take me for your\r\nlieutenant.\" I have related this incident.\r\n\r\nThey hoped for the 9th (Tuesday) a resumption of arms, which did not\r\ntake place. Malarmet had announced it to Dupont de Bussac, but the blow\r\nof the 4th had prostrated Paris. The populace no longer stirred. The\r\nRepresentatives did not resolve to think of their safety, and to quit\r\nFrance through a thousand additional dangers until several days\r\nafterwards, when the last spark of resistance was extinguished in the\r\nheart of the people, and the last glimmer of hope in heaven.\r\n\r\nSeveral Republican Representatives were workmen; they have again become\r\nworkmen in exile. Nadaud has resumed his trowel, and is a mason in\r\nLondon. Faure (du Rhône), a cutler, and Bansept, a shoemaker, felt that\r\ntheir trade had become their duty, and practise it in England. Faure\r\nmakes knives, Bansept makes boots. Greppo is a weaver, it was he who\r\nwhen a proscript made the coronation robe of Queen Victoria. Gloomy\r\nsmile of Destiny. Noël Parfait is a proof-reader at Brussels; Agricol\r\nPerdiguier, called Avignonnais-la-Vertu, has girded on his leathern\r\napron, and is a cabinet-maker at Antwerp. Yesterday these men sat in the\r\nSovereign Assembly. Such things as these are seen in Plutarch.\r\n\r\nThe eloquent and courageous proscript, Emile Deschanel, has created at\r\nBrussels, with a rare talent of speech, a new form of public\r\ninstruction, the Conferences. To him is due the honor of this\r\nfoundation, so fruitful and so useful.\r\n\r\nLet us say in conclusion that the National Legislative Assembly lived\r\nbadly but died well.\r\n\r\nAt this moment of the fall, irreparable for the cowards, the Right was\r\nworthy, the Left was great.\r\n\r\nNever before has History seen a Parliament fall in this manner.\r\n\r\nFebruary had blown upon the Deputies of the legal country, and the\r\nDeputies had vanished. M. Sauzet had sunk down behind the tribune, and\r\nhad gone away without even taking his hat.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, the other, the first, the true Bonaparte, had made the \"Five\r\nHundred\" step out of the windows of the Orangery of Saint Cloud,\r\nsomewhat embarrassed with their large mantles.\r\n\r\nCromwell, the oldest of the Bonapartes, when he achieved his Eighteenth\r\nBrumaire, encountered scarcely any other resistance than a few\r\nimprecations from Milton and from Ludlaw, and was able to say in his\r\nboorishly gigantic language, \"I have put the King in my knapsack and the\r\nParliament in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nWe must go back to the Roman Senate in order to find true Curule chairs.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, let us repeat, to its honor, did not lose\r\ncountenance when facing the abyss. History will keep an account of it.\r\nAfter having betrayed so many things, it might have been feared that\r\nthis Assembly would end by betraying itself. It did nothing of the kind.\r\nThe Legislature, one is obliged to remember, had committed faults upon\r\nfaults; the Royalist majority had, in the most odious manner, persecuted\r\nthe Republican minority, which was bravely doing its duty in denouncing\r\nit to the people; this Assembly had had a very long cohabitation and a\r\nmost fatal complicity with the Man of Crime, who had ended by strangling\r\nit as a robber strangles his concubine in his bed; but whatever may be\r\nsaid of this fateful Assembly, it did not exhibit that wretched\r\nvanishing away which Louis Bonaparte hoped for; it was not a coward.\r\n\r\nThis is due to its having originated from universal suffrage. Let us\r\nmention this, for it is an instructive lesson. The virtue of this\r\nuniversal suffrage, which had begotten the Assembly and which the\r\nAssembly had wished to slay, it felt in itself to its last hour.\r\n\r\nThe sap of a whole people does not spread in vain throughout an\r\nAssembly, even throughout the most decrepit. On the decisive day this\r\nsap asserts itself.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, laden as it may be with formidable\r\nresponsibilities, will, perhaps, be less overwhelmed than it deserves by\r\nthe reprobation of posterity.\r\n\r\nThanks to universal suffrage, which it had deceived, and which\r\nconstituted its faith and its strength at the last moment, thanks to the\r\nLeft, which it had oppressed, scoffed at, calumniated, and decimated,\r\nand which cast on it the glorious reflection of its heroism, this\r\npitiful Assembly died a grand death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE WRITTEN AT BRUSSELS\r\n\r\nWell then, yes, I will kick open the door of this Palace, and I will\r\nenter with you, History! I will seize by the collar all the\r\nperpetrators, continually caught red-handed in the commission of all\r\nthese outrages! I will suddenly illuminate this cavern of night with the\r\nbroad daylight of truth!\r\n\r\nYes, I will bring in the daylight! I will tear down the curtain, I will\r\nopen the window, I will show to every eye such as it really is,\r\ninfamous, horrible, wealthy, triumphant, joyous, gilded,\r\nbesmirched--this Elysée! this Court! this group! this heap! call it what\r\nyou will! this galley-crew! where writhe and crawl, and pair and breed\r\nevery baseness, every indignity, every abomination: filibusters,\r\nbuccaneers, swearers of oaths, Signers of the Cross, spies, swindlers,\r\nbutchers, executioners, from the brigand who vends his sword, to the\r\nJesuit who sells his God second-hand! This sink where Baroche elbows\r\nTeste! where each brings his own nastiness! Magnan his epaulets;\r\nMontalembert his religion, Dupin his person!\r\n\r\nAnd above all the innermost circle, the Holy of Holies, the private\r\nCouncil, the smug den where they drink--where they eat--where they\r\nlaugh--where they sleep--where they play--where they cheat--where they\r\ncall Highnesses \"Thou,\"--where they wallow! Oh! what ignominies! It is\r\nthem! It is there! Dishonor, baseness, shame, and opprobrium are there!\r\nOh History! A hot iron for all these faces.\r\n\r\nIt is there that they amuse themselves, and that they jest, and that\r\nthey banter, and that they make sport of France! It is there that they\r\npocket hap-hazard, amid great shouts of laughter, the millions of louis\r\nand the millions of votes! See them, look at them! They have treated the\r\nLaw like a girl, they are content! Right is slaughtered, Liberty is\r\ngagged, the flag is dishonored, the people are under their feet. They\r\nare happy! And who are they? What are these men? Europe knows not. One\r\nfine morning it saw them come out of a crime. Nothing more. A parcel of\r\nrascals who vainly tried to become celebrated, and who have remained\r\nanonymous. Look! they are all there! See them, I tell you! Look at them,\r\nI tell you! Recognize them if you can. Of what sex are they? To what\r\nspecies do they belong? Who is this one? Is he a writer? No; he is a\r\ndog. He gobbles human flesh. And that one? Is he a dog? No, he is a\r\ncourtier--he has blood on his paw.\r\n\r\nNew men, that is what they term them. New, in truth! Unlooked-for,\r\nstrange, unprecedented, monstrous! Perjury, iniquity, robbery,\r\nassassination, erected into ministerial departments, swindling applied\r\nto universal suffrage, government under false pretences, duty called\r\ncrime, crime called duty, cynicism laughing in the midst of\r\natrocity,--it is of all this that their newness is compounded.\r\n\r\nNow, all is well, they have succeeded, they have a fair wind, they enjoy\r\nthemselves to the full. They have cheated France, they are dividing the\r\nspoil. France is a bag, and they put their hand in it. Rummage, for\r\nHeaven's sake! Take, while you are there; help yourselves, draw out,\r\nplunder, steal! One wants money, another wants situations, another wants\r\na decorative collar round his neck, another a plume in his hat, another\r\nembroidery on his sleeve, another women, another power; another news for\r\nthe Bourse, another a railway, another wine. I should think, indeed,\r\nthat they are well satisfied. Picture to yourself a poor devil who,\r\nthree years ago, borrowed ten sous of his porter, and who to-day,\r\nleaning voluptuously on the _Moniteur_, has only to sign a decree to\r\ntake a million. To make themselves perfectly happy, to be able to devour\r\nthe finances of the State, to live at the expense of the Treasury like a\r\nson of the family, this is what is called their policy. Their ambition\r\nhas a true name, it is gluttony.\r\n\r\nThey ambitious? Nonsense! They are gluttons. To govern is to gamble.\r\nThis does not prevent betrayal. On the contrary, they spy upon each\r\nother, they betray each other. The little traitors betray the great\r\ntraitors. Pietri looks askance at Maupas, and Maupas at Carlier. They\r\nall lie in the same reeking sewer! They have achieved the _coup d'état_\r\nin common. That is all. Moreover they feel sure of nothing, neither of\r\nglances, nor of smiles, nor of hidden thoughts, nor of men, nor of\r\nwomen, nor of the lacquey, nor of the prince, nor of words of honor, nor\r\nof birth certificates. Each feels himself fraudulent, and knows himself\r\nsuspected. Each has his secret aims. Each alone knows why he has done\r\nthis. Not one utters a word about his crime, and no one bears the name\r\nof his father. Ah! may God grant me life, and may Jesus pardon me, I\r\nwill raise a gibbet a hundred yards high, I will take hammer and nails,\r\nand I will crucify this Beauharnais called Bonaparte, between this Leroy\r\ncalled Saint-Arnoud, and this Fialin called Persigny!\r\n\r\nAnd I would drag you there also, all of you accomplices! This Morny,\r\nthis Romieu, this Fould, the Jew senator, this Delangle, who bears on\r\nhis back this placard: JUSTICE! and this Troplong, this judicial\r\nglorifier of the violation of the laws, this lawyer apologist of the\r\n_coup d'état_, this magistrate flatterer of perjury, this judge\r\npanegyrist of murder, who will go down to posterity with a sponge filled\r\nwith mud and with blood in his hand.\r\n\r\nI begin the battle therefore. With whom? With the present ruler of\r\nEurope. It is right that this spectacle should be given to the world.\r\nLouis Bonaparte is the success, is the intoxicated triumph, is the gay\r\nand ferocious despotism, opening out under the victory, he is the mad\r\nfulness of power, seeking limits and finding none, neither in things nor\r\nin men; Louis Bonaparte holds France, _Urbem Roman habit_; and whoever\r\nholds France holds the world; he is master of the votes, master of the\r\nconsciences, master of the people; he nominates his successor, reigns\r\nforever over future electoral scrutinies, disposes of eternity, and\r\nplaces futurity in an envelope; his Senate, his Legislative Body, his\r\nCouncil of State, with heads lowered and mingled confusedly behind him,\r\nlick his feet; he drags along in a leash the bishops and cardinals; he\r\ntramples on the justice which curses him, and on the judges who adore\r\nhim, thirty correspondents inform the Continent that he has frowned, and\r\nevery electric telegraph vibrates if he raises his little finger; around\r\nhim is heard the rustling of sabres, and the drums beat the salute; he\r\nsits under the shadow of the eagle in the midst of bayonets and of\r\ncitadels, the free nations tremble and hide their liberties for fear\r\nthat he should steal them, the great American Republic herself falters\r\nin his presence, and dares not withdraw her Ambassador from him; the\r\nkings, surrounded by their armies, look at him smilingly, with their\r\nhearts full of fear. Where will he begin? With Belgium? With\r\nSwitzerland? With Piedmont? Europe expects to be overrun. He is capable\r\nof all, and he dreams of all.\r\n\r\nWell, then! Before this master, this triumpher, this conqueror, this\r\ndictator, this Emperor, this all-powerful, there rises a solitary man, a\r\nwanderer, despoiled, ruined, prostrate, proscribed, and attacks him.\r\nLouis Napoleon has ten thousand cannons, and five hundred thousand\r\nsoldiers; the writer has his pen and his ink-stand. The writer is\r\nnothing, he is a grain of dust, he is a shadow, he is an exile without a\r\nrefuge, he is a vagrant without a passport, but he has by his side and\r\nfighting with him two powers, Right, which is invincible, and Truth,\r\nwhich is immortal.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, for this struggle to the death, for this formidable duel,\r\nProvidence could have chosen a more illustrious champion, a grander\r\nathlete. But what matter men, there, where it is the idea with combats!\r\nSuch as it is, it is good, let us repeat, that this spectacle should be\r\ngiven to the world. What is this in truth? It is intellect, an atom\r\nwhich resists strength--a colossus.\r\n\r\nI have only one stone in my sling, but that stone is a good one; that\r\nstone is justice.\r\n\r\nI attack Louis Bonaparte at this hour, when he is erect; at this hour,\r\nwhen he is master. He is in his zenith. So much the better; it is that\r\nwhich suits me.\r\n\r\nYes, I attack Louis Bonaparte. I attack him before the world; I attack\r\nhim in the presence of God and men; I attack him resolutely,\r\ndesperately; for the love of the people and of France. He is about to be\r\nEmperor, let it be so. Let there be at least one brow which resists. Let\r\nLouis Bonaparte know that an Empire may be taken, but that a Conscience\r\ncannot be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFALLIBLE BENEDICTION\r\n\r\nThe Pope approved.\r\n\r\nWhen the mails brought to Rome intelligence of the event of the 2d of\r\nDecember, the Pope went to a review held by General Gémeau, and begged\r\nhim to congratulate Prince Louis Napoléon for him.\r\n\r\nThere was a precedent for this.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th December, 1572, Saint-Goard, Ambassador of Charles the\r\nNinth, King of France, to Philip the Second, King of Spain, wrote from\r\nMadrid to his master, Charles the Ninth, \"The news of the events of the\r\nday of Saint Bartholomew have reached the Catholic King. Contrary to his\r\nwont and custom, he has shown so much joy, that he has manifested it\r\nmore openly than he has ever done for all the happy events and good\r\nfortune which have previously befallen him. So that I went to him on\r\nSunday morning at Saint Hieronimus, and having approached him, he burst\r\nout laughing, and with every demonstration of extreme pleasure and\r\ncontentment, began to praise your Majesty.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThe hand of Pius IX. remained extended over France, when it had become\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nThen, under the shadow of this benediction, began an era of prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[36] \"Archives of the house of Orange,\" page 125, Supplement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION--THE FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was coming back from my fourth exile--an exile in Belgium, a small\r\nmatter. It was one of the last days of September, 1871. I was\r\nre-entering France by the Luxembourg frontier. I had fallen asleep in\r\nthe carriage. Suddenly the jolt of the train coming to a standstill\r\nawoke me. I opened my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe train had stopped in the middle of a charming landscape.\r\n\r\nI was in the half-consciousness of an interrupted sleep; and ideas, as\r\nyet half-dreams, hazy and diffuse, hovered between myself and reality. I\r\nexperienced the undefinable and confused sensation of awakening.\r\n\r\nA river flowed by the side of the railway, clear, around a bright and\r\nverdant island. This vegetation was so thick that the moor-hens, on\r\nreaching it, plunged beneath it and disappeared. The river wound through\r\na valley, which appeared like a huge garden. Apple-trees were there,\r\nwhich reminded one of Eve, and willows, which made one think of Galatea.\r\nIt was, as I have said, in one of those equinoctial months when may be\r\nfelt the peculiar charm of a season drawing to a close. If it be winter\r\nwhich is passing away, you hear the song of approaching spring; if it be\r\nsummer which is vanishing, you see glimmering on the horizon the\r\nundefinable smile of autumn. The wind lulled and harmonized all those\r\npleasant sounds which compose the murmur of the fields; the tinkling of\r\nthe sheep-bells seemed to soothe the humming of the bees; the last\r\nbutterflies met together with the first grapes; this hour of the year\r\nmingles the joy of being still alive with the unconscious melancholy of\r\nfast approaching death; the sweetness of the sun was indescribable.\r\nFertile fields streaked with furrows, honest peasants' cottages; under\r\nthe trees a turf covered with shade, the lowing of cattle as in Virgil,\r\nand the smoke of hamlets penetrated by rays of sunshine; such was the\r\ncomplete picture. The clanging of anvils rang in the distance, the\r\nrhythm of work amidst the harmony of nature. I listened, I mused\r\nvaguely. The valley was beautiful and quiet, the blue heavens seemed as\r\nthough resting upon a lovely circle of hills; in the distance were the\r\nvoices of birds, and close to me the voices of children, like two songs\r\nof angels mingled together; the universal purity enshrouded me: all this\r\ngrace and all this grandeur shed a golden dawn into my soul....\r\n\r\nSuddenly a fellow-traveller asked,--\r\n\r\n\"What place is this?\"\r\n\r\nAnother answered,--\r\n\r\n\"Sedan.\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered.\r\n\r\nThis paradise was a tomb.\r\n\r\nI looked around. The valley was circular and hollow, like the bottom of\r\na crater; the winding river resembled a serpent; the high hills, ranged\r\none behind the other, surrounded this mysterious spot like a triple line\r\nof inexorable walls; once there, there is no means of exit. It reminded\r\nme of the amphitheatres. An indescribable disquieting vegetation which\r\nseemed to be an extension of the Black Forest, overran all the heights,\r\nand lost itself in the horizon like a huge impenetrable snare; the sun\r\nshone, the birds sang, carters passed by whistling; sheep, lambs, and\r\npigeons were scattered about, leaves quivered and rustled; the grass, a\r\ndensely thick grass, was full of flowers. It was appalling.\r\n\r\nI seemed to see waving over this valley the flashing of the avenging\r\nangel's sword.\r\n\r\nThis word \"Sedan\" had been like a veil abruptly torn aside. The\r\nlandscape had become suddenly filled with tragedy. Those shapeless eyes\r\nwhich the bark of trees delineates on the trunks were gazing--at what?\r\nAt something terrible and lost to view.\r\n\r\nIn truth, that was the place! And at the moment when I was passing by\r\nthirteen months all but a few days had elapsed. That was the place where\r\nthe monstrous enterprise of the 2d of December had burst asunder. A\r\nfearful shipwreck.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy pathways of Fate cannot be studied without profound anguish\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August, 1870, an army was reassembled, and was, as it\r\nwere, massed together under the walls of Sedan, in a place called the\r\nGivonne Valley. This army was a French army--twenty-nine brigades,\r\nfifteen divisions, four army corps--90,000 men. This army was in this\r\nplace without any one being able to divine the reason; without order,\r\nwithout an object, scattered about--a species of heap of men thrown down\r\nthere as though with the view of being seized by some huge hand.\r\n\r\nThis army either did not entertain, or appeared not to entertain, for\r\nthe moment any immediate uneasiness. They knew, or at least they thought\r\nthey knew, that the enemy was a long way off. On calculating the stages\r\nat four leagues daily, it was three days' march distant. Nevertheless,\r\ntowards evening the leaders took some wise strategic precautions; they\r\nprotected the army, which rested in the rear on Sedan and the Meuse, by\r\ntwo battle fronts, one composed of the 7th Corps, and extending from\r\nFloing to Givonne, the other composed of the 12th Corps, extending from\r\nGivonne to Bazeilles; a triangle of which the Meuse formed the\r\nhypothenuse. The 12th Corps, formed of the three divisions of\r\nLacretelle, Lartigue, and Wolf, ranged on the right, with the artillery,\r\nbetween the brigades formed a veritable barrier, having Bazeilles and\r\nGivonne at each end, and Daigny in its centre; the two divisions of\r\nPetit and Lhéritier massed in the rear upon two lines supported this\r\nbarrier. General Lebrun commanded the 12th Corps. The 7th Corps,\r\ncommanded by General Douay, only possessed two divisions--Dumont's\r\ndivision and Gilbert's division--and formed the other battle front,\r\ncovering the army of Givonne to Floing on the side of Illy; this battle\r\nfront was comparatively weak, too open on the side of Givonne, and only\r\nprotected on the side of the Meuse by the two cavalry divisions of\r\nMargueritte and Bonnemains, and by Guyomar's brigade, resting in squares\r\nupon Floing. Within this triangle were encamped the 5th Corps, commanded\r\nby General Wimpfen, and the 1st Corps, commanded by General Ducrot.\r\nMichel's cavalry division covered the 1st Corps on the side of Daigny;\r\nthe 5th supported itself upon Sedan. Four divisions, each disposed upon\r\ntwo lines--the divisions of Lhéritier, Grandchamp, Goze, and\r\nConseil-Duménil--formed a sort of horseshoe, turned towards Sedan, and\r\nuniting the first battle front with the second. The cavalry division of\r\nAmeil and the brigade of Fontanges served as a reserve for these four\r\ndivisions. The whole of the artillery was upon the two battle fronts.\r\nTwo portions of the army were in confusion, one to the right of Sedan\r\nbeyond Balan, the other to the left of Sedan, on this side of Iges.\r\nBeyond Balan were the divisions of Vassoigne and the brigade of Reboul,\r\non this side of Iges were the two cavalry divisions of Margueritte and\r\nBonnemains.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements indicated a profound feeling of security. In the\r\nfirst place the Emperor Napoleon III. would not have come there if he\r\nhad not been perfectly tranquil. This Givonne Valley is what Napoleon I.\r\ncalled a \"washhand basin.\" There could not be a more complete enclosure.\r\nAn army is so much at home there that it is too much so; it runs the\r\nrisk of no longer being able to get out. This disquieted some brave and\r\nprudent leaders such as Wimpfen, but they were not listened to. If\r\nabsolutely necessary, said the people of the Imperial circle, they could\r\nalways be sure of being able to reach Mézières, and at the worst the\r\nBelgian frontier. Was it, however, needful to provide for such extreme\r\neventualities? In certain cases foresight is almost an offence. They\r\nwere all of one mind, therefore, to be at their ease.\r\n\r\nIf they had been uneasy they would have cut the bridges of the Meuse;\r\nbut they did not even think of it. To what purpose? The enemy was a long\r\nway off. The Emperor, who evidently was well informed, affirmed it.\r\n\r\nThe army bivouacked somewhat in confusion, as we have said, and slept\r\npeaceably throughout this night of August 31, having, whatever might\r\nhappen, or believing that they had, the retreat upon Mézières open\r\nbehind it. They disdained to take the most ordinary precautions, they\r\nmade no cavalry reconnaissances, they did not even place outposts. A\r\nGerman military writer has stated this.[37] Fourteen leagues at least\r\nseparated them from the German army, three days' march; they did not\r\nexactly know where it was; they believed it scattered, possessing little\r\nunity, badly informed, led somewhat at random upon several points at\r\nonce, incapable of a movement converging upon one single point, like\r\nSedan; they believed that the Crown Prince of Saxony was marching on\r\nChalons, and that the Crown Prince of Prussia was marching on Metz; they\r\nwere ignorant of everything appertaining to this army, its leaders, its\r\nplan, its armament, its effective force. Was it still following the\r\nstrategy of Gustavus Adolphus? Was it still following the tactics of\r\nFrederick II.? No one knew. They felt sure of being at Berlin in a few\r\nweeks. What nonsense! The Prussian army! They talked of this war as of a\r\ndream, and of this army as of a phantom.\r\n\r\nDuring this very night, while the French army was sleeping, this is what\r\nwas taking place.\r\n\r\n\r\n[37] M. Harwik.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to two in the morning, at his headquarters at Mouzon,\r\nAlbert, Crown Prince of Saxony, set the Army of the Meuse in motion; the\r\nRoyal Guard were beat to arms, and two divisions marched, one upon\r\nVillers-Cernay, by Escambre and Fouru-aux-Bois, the other upon\r\nFrancheval by Suchy and Fouru-Saint-Remy. The Artillery of the Guard\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the 12th Saxon Corps was beaten to arms, and by the\r\nhigh road to the south of Douzy reached Lamécourt, and marched upon La\r\nMoncelle; the 1st Bavarian Corps marched upon Bazeilles, supported at\r\nReuilly-sur-Meuse by an Artillery Division of the 4th Corps. The other\r\ndivision of the 4th Corps crossed the Meuse at Mouzon, and massed itself\r\nin reserve at Mairy, upon the right bank. These three columns maintained\r\nclose communication with each other. The order was given to the advanced\r\nguards to begin no offensive movement before five o'clock, and silently\r\nto occupy Fouru-aux-Bois, Fouru-Saint-Remy, and Douay. They had left\r\ntheir knapsacks behind them. The baggage-wagons did not stir. The Crown\r\nPrince of Saxony was on horseback on the heights of Amblimont.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, at his headquarters at Chémery, Blumenthal was having\r\na bridge built over the Meuse by the Wurtemburg division. The 11th\r\nCorps, astir before daylight, crossed the Meuse at Dom-le-Mesnil and at\r\nDonchery, and reached Vrigne-sur-Bois. The artillery followed, and held\r\nthe road from Vrigne to Sedan. The Wurtemburg division kept the bridge\r\nwhich it had built, and held the road from Sedan to Mézières. At five\r\no'clock, the 2d Bavarian Corps, with the artillery at its head, detached\r\none of its divisions, and sent it by Bulson upon Frénois; the other\r\ndivision passed by Noyers, and drew up before Sedan, between Frénois and\r\nWadelincourt. The artillery of the Reserve was drawn up on the heights\r\nof the left bank, opposite Donchery.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the 6th Cavalry Division was sent from Mazeray, and\r\npassing by Boutancourt and Bolzicourt, reached the Meuse at Flize; the\r\n2d Cavalry Division quitted its encampment, and took up its position to\r\nthe south of Boutancourt; the 4th Cavalry Division took up its position\r\nto the south of Frénois; the 1st Bavarian Corps installed itself at\r\nRemilly; the 5th Cavalry Division and the 6th Corps were posted to\r\nobserve, and all in line, and order, massed upon the heights waited for\r\nthe dawn to appear. The Crown Prince of Prussia was on horseback on the\r\nhill of Frénois.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, upon every point of the horizon, other and similar\r\nmovements were taking place from every side. The high hills were\r\nsuddenly overrun by an immense black army. Not one shout of command. Two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men came silently to encircle the Givonne\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nThis is what the circle consisted of,--\r\n\r\nThe Bavarians, the right wing, at Bazeilles on the Meuse; next to the\r\nBavarians the Saxons, at La Moncelle and Daigny; opposite Givonne, the\r\nRoyal Guard; the 5th Corps at Saint Menges; the 2d at Flaigneux; the\r\nWurtemburgers at the bend of the Meuse, between Saint Menges and\r\nDonchery; Count Stolberg and his cavalry at Donchery; in front, towards\r\nSedan, the 2d Bavarian Army.\r\n\r\nAll this was carried out in a ghostly manner, in order, without a\r\nwhisper, without a sound, through forests, ravines, and valleys. A\r\ntortuous and ill-omened march. A stealthy gliding onwards of reptiles.\r\n\r\nScarcely could a murmur be heard beneath the thick foliage. The silent\r\nbattle swarmed in the darkness awaiting the day.\r\n\r\nThe French army was sleeping.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it awoke.\r\n\r\nIt was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose, brilliant on the side of God--terrible on the side of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us review the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have numbers on their side; they are three against one,\r\nperhaps four; they own to 250,000 men, and it is certain that their\r\nattacking front extended for 30 kilomètres; they have on their side the\r\npositions, they crown the heights, they fill the forests, they are\r\ncovered by all these escarpments, they are masked by all this shade;\r\nthey possess an incomparable artillery. The French army is in a valley,\r\nalmost without artillery and without supplies, utterly naked beneath\r\ntheir hail of lead. The Germans have on their side the ambuscade, and\r\nthe French have only on their side heroism. Death is glorious, but\r\nsurprise is profitable.\r\n\r\nA surprise, that is the true description of this brilliant exploit.\r\n\r\nIs it fair warfare? Yes. But if this is fair, what is unfair warfare? It\r\nis the same thing.\r\n\r\nThis said, the story of the Battle of Sedan has been told.\r\n\r\nI should have wished to stop there. But I cannot. Whatever horror the\r\nhistorian may feel, History is a duty, and this duty must be fulfilled.\r\nThere is no incline more inexorable than this: to tell the truth; he who\r\nventures on it rolls to the very bottom. It must be so. The guardian of\r\nJustice is doomed to justice.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Sedan is more than a battle which has been fought; it is a\r\nsyllogism which is completed; a formidable premeditation of destiny.\r\nDestiny never hurries, but it always comes. At its hour, there it is. It\r\nallows years to pass by, and at the moment when men are least thinking\r\nof it, it appears. Of this character is the fatal, the unexpected\r\ncatastrophe named Sedan. From time to time in History, Divine logic\r\nmakes an onslaught. Sedan is one of those onslaughts.\r\n\r\nThus on the 1st of September, at five o'clock in the morning the world\r\nawoke under the sun, and the French army under the thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nBazeilles takes fire, Givonne takes fire, Floing takes fire; the battle\r\nbegins with a furnace. The whole horizon is aflame. The French camp is\r\nin this crater, stupefied, affrighted, starting up from sleeping,--a\r\nfunereal swarming. A circle of thunder surrounds the army. They are\r\nencircled by annihilation. This mighty slaughter is carried on on all\r\nsides simultaneously. The French resist, and they are terrible, having\r\nnothing left but despair. Our cannon, almost all old-fashioned and of\r\nshort range, are at once dismounted by the fearful and exact aim of the\r\nPrussians. The density of the rain of shells upon the valley is so\r\ngreat, that \"the earth is completely furrowed,\" says an eye-witness, \"as\r\nthough by a rake.\" How many cannon? Eleven hundred at least. Twelve\r\nGerman batteries upon La Moncelle alone; the 3d and 4th _Abtheilung_, an\r\nawe-striking artillery, upon the crests of Givonne, with the 2d horse\r\nbattery in reserve; opposite Doigny ten Saxon and two Wurtemburg\r\nbatteries; the curtain of trees of the wood to the north of\r\nVillers-Cernay masks the mounted _Abtheilung_, which is there with the\r\n3d Heavy Artillery in reserve, and from this gloomy copse issues a\r\nformidable fire; the twenty-four pieces of the 1st Heavy Artillery are\r\nranged in the glade skirting the road from La Moncelle to La Chapelle;\r\nthe battery of the Royal Guard sets fire to the Garenne Wood; the shells\r\nand the balls riddle Suchy, Francheval, Fouru-Saint-Remy, and the valley\r\nbetween Heibes and Givonne; and the third and fourth rank of cannon\r\nextend without break of continuity as far as the Calvary of Illy, the\r\nextreme point of the horizon. The German soldiers, seated or lying\r\nbefore the batteries, watch the artillery at work. The French soldiers\r\nfall and die. Amongst the bodies which cover the plain there is one, the\r\nbody of an officers on which they will find, after the battle, a sealed\r\nnote, containing this order, signed NAPOLEON: \"To-day, September 1st,\r\nrest for the whole army.\"\r\n\r\nThe gallant 35th of the Line almost completely disappears under the\r\noverwhelming shower of shells; the brave Marine Infantry holds at bay\r\nfor a moment the Saxons, joined by the Bavarians, but outflanked on\r\nevery side, draws back; all the admirable cavalry of the Targueritte\r\nDivision hurled against the German infantry, halts and sinks down\r\nmidway, \"annihilated,\" says the Prussian Report, \"by well-aimed and cool\r\nfiring.\"[38] This field of carnage has three outlets; all three barred:\r\nthe Bouillon road by the Prussian Guard, the Carignan road by the\r\nBavarians, the Mézières road by the Wurtemburgers. The French have not\r\nthought of barricading the railway viaduct; three German battalions have\r\noccupied it during the night. Two isolated houses on the Balan road\r\ncould be made the pivot of a long resistance; but the Germans are there.\r\nThe wood from Monvilliers to Bazeilles, bushy and dense, might prevent\r\nthe junction of the Saxons, masters of La Moncelle, and the Bavarians,\r\nmasters of Bazeilles; but the French have been forestalled: they find\r\nthe Bavarians cutting the underwood with their bill-hooks. The German\r\narmy moves in one piece, in one absolute unity; the Crown Prince of\r\nSaxony is on the height of Mairy, whence he surveys the whole action;\r\nthe command oscillates in the French army; at the beginning of the\r\nbattle, at a quarter to six, MacMahon is wounded by the bursting of a\r\nshell; at seven o'clock Ducrot replaces him; at ten o'clock Wimpfen\r\nreplaces Ducrot. Every instant the wall of fire is drawing closer in,\r\nthe roll of the thunder is continuous, a dismal pulverization of 90,000\r\nmen! Never before has anything equal to this been seen; never before has\r\nan army been overwhelmed beneath such a downpour of lead and iron! At\r\none o'clock all is lost. The regiments fly helter-skelter into Sedan.\r\nBut Sedan begins to burn; Dijonval burns, the ambulances burn, there is\r\nnothing now possible but to cut their way out. Wimpfen, brave and\r\nresolute, proposes this to the Emperor. The 3d Zouaves, desperate, have\r\nset the example. Cut off from the rest of the army, they have forced a\r\npassage, and have reached Belgium. A flight of lions!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, above the disaster, above the huge pile of dead and dying,\r\nabove all this unfortunate heroism, appears disgrace. The white flag is\r\nhoisted.\r\n\r\nTurenne and Vauban were both present, one in his statue, the other in\r\nhis citadel.\r\n\r\nThe statue and the citadel witnessed the awe-striking capitulation.\r\nThese two virgins, one of bronze, the other of granite, felt themselves\r\nprostituted. O noble face of our country! Oh, eternal blushes!\r\n\r\n\r\n[38] The Franco-German War of 1870-71. Report of the Prussian Staff,\r\npage 1087.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis disaster of Sedan was easy of avoidance by any other man, but\r\nimpossible of avoidance for Louis Bonaparte. He avoided it so little\r\nthat he sought it. _Lex fati_.\r\n\r\nOur army seemed expressly arranged for the catastrophe. The soldier was\r\nuneasy, ignorant of his whereabouts, famished. On the 31st of August, in\r\nthe streets of Sedan, soldiers were seeking their regiments, and going\r\nfrom door to door asking for bread. We have seen the Emperor's order\r\nannouncing the next day, September 1st, as a day of rest. In truth the\r\narmy was worn out with fatigue. And yet it had only marched by short\r\nstages. The soldier was almost losing the habit of marching. One corps,\r\nthe 1st, for example, only accomplished two leagues per day (on the 29th\r\nof August from Stonne to Raucourt).\r\n\r\nDuring that time the German army, inexorably commanded and driven at the\r\nstick's end like the army of the Xerxes, achieved marches of fourteen\r\nleagues in fifteen hours, which enabled it to arrive unexpectedly, and\r\nto surround the French army while asleep. It was customary to allow\r\noneself to be surprised. General Failly allowed himself to be surprised\r\nat Beaumont; during the day the soldiers took their guns to pieces to\r\nclean them, at night they slept, without even cutting the bridges which\r\ndelivered them to the enemy; thus they neglected to blow up the bridges\r\nof Mouzon and Bazeilles. On September 1st, daylight had not yet\r\nappeared, when an advance guard of seven battalions, commanded by\r\nGeneral Schultz, captured La Rulle, and insured the junction of the army\r\nof the Meuse with the Royal Guard. Almost at the same minute, with\r\nGerman precision, the Wurtemburgers seized the bridge of La Platinerie,\r\nand hidden by the Chevalier Wood, the Saxon battalions, spread out into\r\ncompany columns, occupied the whole of the road from La Moncelle to\r\nVillers-Cernay.\r\n\r\nThus, as we have seen, the awakening of the French Army was horrible. At\r\nBazeilles a fog was added to the smoke. Our soldiers, attacked in this\r\ngloom, knew not what death required of them; they fought from room to\r\nroom and from house to house.[39]\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the Reboul brigade came to support the Martin des\r\nPallières brigade; they were obliged to yield. At the same time Ducrot\r\nwas compelled to concentrate his forces in the Garenne Wood, before the\r\nCalvary of Illy; Douay, shattered, fell back; Lebrun alone stood firm on\r\nthe plateau of Stenay. Our troops occupied a line of five kilomètres;\r\nthe front of the French army faced the east, the left faced the north,\r\nthe extreme left (the Guyomar brigade) faced the west; but they did not\r\nknow whether they faced the enemy, they did not see him; annihilation\r\nstruck without showing itself; they had to deal with a masked Medusa.\r\nOur cavalry was excellent, but useless. The field of battle, obstructed\r\nby a large wood, cut up by clumps of trees, by houses and by farms and\r\nby enclosure walls, was excellent for artillery and infantry, but bad\r\nfor cavalry. The rivulet of Givonne, which flows at the bottom of the\r\nvalley and crosses it, for three days ran with more blood than water.\r\nAmong other places of carnage, Saint-Menges was appalling. For a moment\r\nit appeared possible to cut a way out by Carignan towards Montmédy, and\r\nthen this outlet reclosed. This refuge only remained, Sedan; Sedan\r\nencumbered with carts, with wagons, with carriages, with hospital huts;\r\na heap of combustible matter. This dying agony of heroes lasted ten\r\nhours. They refused to surrender, they grew indignant, they wished to\r\ncomplete their death, so bravely begun. They were delivered up to it.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, three men, three dauntless soldiers, had succeeded each\r\nother in the command, MacMahon, Ducrot, Wimpfen; MacMahon had only time\r\nto be wounded, Ducrot had only time to commit a blunder, Wimpfen had\r\nonly time to conceive an heroic idea, and he conceived it; but MacMahon\r\nis not responsible for his wound, Ducrot is not responsible for his\r\nblunder, and Wimpfen is not responsible for the impossibility of his\r\nsuggestion to cut their way out. The shell which struck MacMahon\r\nwithdrew him from the catastrophe; Ducrot's blunder, the inopportune\r\norder to retreat given to General Lebrun, is explained by the confused\r\nhorror of the situation, and is rather an error than a fault. Wimpfen,\r\ndesperate, needed 20,000 soldiers to cut his way out, and could only get\r\ntogether 2000. History exculpates these three men; in this disaster of\r\nSedan there was but one sole and fatal general, the Emperor. That which\r\nwas knitted together on the 2d December, 1851, came apart on the 2d\r\nSeptember, 1870; the carnage on the Boulevard Montmartre, and the\r\ncapitulation of Sedan are, we maintain, the two parts of a syllogism;\r\nlogic and justice have the same balance; it was Louis Bonaparte's dismal\r\ndestiny to begin with the black flag of massacres and to end with the\r\nwhite flag of disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[39] \"The French were literally awakened from sleep by our attack.\"\r\n--Helvic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no alternative between death and opprobrium; either soul or\r\nsword must be surrendered. Louis Bonaparte surrendered his sword.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to William:\r\n\r\n  \"SIRE, MY BROTHER,\r\n\r\n  \"Not having been able to die in the midst of my troops, it only\r\n  remains for me to place my sword in your Majesty's hands.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, your Majesty,\r\n\r\n  \"Your good Brother,\r\n\r\n  \"NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n  \"Sedan, 1st September, 1870.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam answered, \"Sire, my Brother, I accept your sword.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the 2d of September, at six o'clock in the morning, this plain,\r\nstreaming with blood, and covered with dead, saw pass by a gilded open\r\ncarriage and four, the horses harnessed after Daumont fashion, and in\r\nthis carriage a man, cigarette in mouth. It was the Emperor of the\r\nFrench going to surrender his sword to the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe King kept the Emperor waiting. It was too early. He sent M. de\r\nBismarck to Louis Bonaparte to say that he \"would not\" receive him yet\r\nawhile. Louis Bonaparte entered into a hovel by the side of the road. A\r\ntable and two chairs were there. Bismarck and he leant their arms on the\r\ntable and conversed. A mournful conversation. At the hour which suited\r\nthe King, towards noon, the Emperor got back into his carriage, and went\r\nto the castle of Bellevue, half way to the castle of Vandresse. There he\r\nwaited until the King came. At one o'clock William arrived from\r\nVandresse, and consented to receive Bonaparte. He received him badly.\r\nAttila has not a light hand. The King, a blunt, straightforward man,\r\nshowed the Emperor a pity involuntarily cruel. There are pities which\r\noverwhelm. The conqueror upbraided the conquered with the victory.\r\nBluntness handles an open wound badly. \"Whatever was your reason for\r\ndeclaring this war?\" The conquered excused himself, accusing France. The\r\ndistant hurrahs of the victorious German army cut short this dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe King caused the Emperor to be reconducted by a detachment of the\r\nRoyal Guard. This excess of ignominy is called \"an escort of honor.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the sword the Army.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of September, Louis Bonaparte handed over to Germany 88,000\r\nFrench soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"In addition\" (says the Prussian report):--\r\n\r\n\"One eagle and two flags.\r\n\r\n\"419 field-guns and mitrailleuses.\r\n\r\n\"139 heavy pieces.\r\n\r\n\"1079 vehicles of all kinds.\r\n\r\n\"60,000 muskets.\r\n\r\n\"6000 horses, still good for service.\"\r\n\r\nThese German figures are not wholly to be depended upon. According to\r\nwhat seems useful at the moment, the Aulic chancellors swell or reduce\r\nthe disaster. There were about 13,000 wounded amongst the prisoners. The\r\nnumbers vary in the official documents. A Prussian report, reckoning up\r\nthe French soldiers killed and wounded in the battle of Sedan, publishes\r\nthis total: _Sixteen thousand four hundred_ men. This number causes a\r\nshudder. For it is that very number, _Sixteen thousand four hundred_\r\nmen, which Saint Arnaud had set to work on the Boulevard Montmartre upon\r\nthe 4th of December, 1851.\r\n\r\nHalf a league to the north-west of Sedan, near Iges, the bend of the\r\nMeuse almost forms an island. A canal crosses the isthmus, so that the\r\npeninsula becomes an island. It was there that there were penned, under\r\nthe stick of the Prussian corporals, 83,000 French soldiers. A few\r\nsentinels watched over this army.\r\n\r\nThey placed but few, insolently. These conquered men remained there ten\r\ndays, the wounded almost without care, the able-bodied almost without\r\nnourishment. The German army sneered around them. The heavens took part\r\nagainst them. The weather was fearful. Neither huts nor tents. Not a\r\nfire, not a truss of straw. For ten days and ten nights these 83,000\r\nprisoners bivouacked with their heads beneath the rain, their feet in\r\nthe mud. Many died of fever, regretting the hail of bullets.\r\n\r\nAt length ox-wagons came and took them away.\r\n\r\nThe King placed the Emperor in some place or other. Wilhelmshöhe.\r\n\r\nWhat a thing of rags and tatters, an Emperor \"drawn\" like a fowl!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was there, thoughtful. I looked on these fields, these ravines, these\r\nhills, shuddering. I would willingly have insulted this terrible place.\r\n\r\nBut sacred horror held me back.\r\n\r\nThe station-master of Sedan came to my carriage, and explained to me\r\nwhat I had before my eyes. I seemed to see, through his words, the pale\r\nlightnings of the battle. All these distant cottages, scattered about\r\nand charming in the sun, had been burnt; they were rebuilt; Nature, so\r\nquickly diverted, had repaired everything, had cleaned everything, had\r\nswept everything, had replaced everything. The ferocious convulsion of\r\nmen had vanished, eternal order had resumed its sway. But, as I have\r\nsaid, the sun was there in vain, all this valley was smoke and darkness.\r\nIn the distance, upon an eminence to my left, I saw a huge castle; it\r\nwas Vandresse. There lodged the King of Prussia. Halfway up this height,\r\nalong the road, I distinguished above the trees three pointed gables; it\r\nwas another castle, Bellevue; there Louis Bonaparte surrendered to\r\nWilliam; there he had given and delivered up our army; it was there\r\nthat, not being immediately admitted, and requested to exercise a little\r\npatience, he had remained for nearly an hour silent and wan before the\r\ndoor, bringing his disgrace, and waiting until it should please William\r\nto open the door to him; it was there that before receiving it the King\r\nof Prussia had made the sword of France dangle about in an ante-chamber.\r\nLower down, nearer, in the valley, at the beginning of a road leading to\r\nVandresse, they pointed out to me a species of hovel. There they told\r\nme, while waiting for the King of Prussia, the Emperor Napoleon III. had\r\ngot down, livid; he had gone into a little courtyard, which they pointed\r\nout to me, and where a dog growled on the chain; he had seated himself\r\non a stone close by a dunghill, and he had said, \"I am thirsty.\" A\r\nPrussian soldier had brought him a glass of water.\r\n\r\nTerrible end of the _coup d'état_! Blood when it is drunk does not\r\nquench the thirst. An hour was to come when the unhappy one should utter\r\nthe cry of fever and of agony. Disgrace reserved for him this thirst,\r\nand Prussia this glass of water.\r\n\r\nFearful dregs of Destiny.\r\n\r\nBeyond the road, at a few steps from me, five trembling and pale poplars\r\nsheltered the front of the house, the single story of which was\r\nsurmounted by a sign. On this sign was written in great letters this\r\nname: DROUET. I became haggard. _Drouet_ I read _Varennes_. Tragical\r\nChance, which mingled Varennes with Sedan, seemed to wish to bring the\r\ntwo catastrophes face to face, and to couple in a manner with the same\r\nchain the Emperor a prisoner of the foreigner, to the King a prisoner of\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\nThe mist of reverie veiled this plain from me. The Meuse appeared to me\r\nto wear a ruddy reflection, the neighboring isle, whose verdure I had\r\nadmired, had for its subsoil a tomb: Fifteen hundred horses, and as many\r\nmen, were buried there: thence the thick grass. Here and there, as far\r\nas could be seen, mounds, covered with ill-favored vegetation, dotted\r\nthe valley; each of these patches of vegetation marked the place of a\r\nburied regiment. There Guyomar's Brigade had been annihilated; there,\r\nthe Lhéritier Division had been exterminated; here the 7th Corps had\r\nperished; there, without having even reached the enemy's infantry, had\r\nfallen \"beneath the cool and well-aimed firing,\" as the Prussian report\r\nstates, the whole of General Margueritte's cavalry. From these two\r\nheights, the most elevated of this circle of hills, Daigny, opposite\r\nGivonne, which is 266 mètres high, Fleigneux, opposite Illy, 296 mètres\r\nhigh, the batteries of the Prussian Royal Guard had crushed the French\r\nArmy. It was done from above, with the terrible authority of Destiny. It\r\nseemed as though they had come there purposely, these to kill, the\r\nothers to die. A valley for a mortar, the German Army for a pestle, such\r\nis the battle of Sedan. I gazed, powerless to avert my eyes, at this\r\nfield of disaster, at this undulating country which had proved no\r\nprotection to our regiments, at this ravine where all our cavalry were\r\ndemolished, at all this amphitheatre where the catastrophe was spread\r\nout, at the gloomy escarpments of La Marphée, at these thickets, at\r\nthese declivities, at these precipices, at these forests filled with\r\nambushes, and in this terrible shadow, O Thou the Invisible! I saw Thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever was there a more dismal fall.\r\n\r\nNo expiation can be compared with this. The unprecedented drama was in\r\nfive acts, so fierce that Aeschylus himself would not have dared to\r\ndream of them. \"The Ambush!\" \"The Struggle!\" \"The Massacre!\" \"The\r\nVictory!\" \"The Fall!\" What a tangle and what an unwinding! A poet who\r\nwould have predicted it would have seemed a traitor. God alone could\r\npermit Himself Sedan.\r\n\r\nEverything in proportion, such is His law. Far worse than Brumaire, it\r\nneeded a more crushing retribution than Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe first Napoleon, as we have said elsewhere,[40] had faced his\r\ndestiny; he had not been dishonored by his punishment, he fell while\r\nsteadfastly regarding God. He came back to Paris, appraising the deserts\r\nof those men who overthrew him, proudly distinguishing amongst them,\r\nesteeming Lafayette and despising Dupin. He had at the last moment\r\nwished to see clearly into his destiny, he had not allowed his eyes to\r\nbe bandaged; he had accepted the catastrophe while making his conditions\r\nwith it. Here there is nothing of the kind. One might almost say that\r\nthe traitor is struck treacherously. In this case there is a bad man who\r\nfeels himself in the grasp of Destiny, and who does not know what it is\r\ndoing to him. He was at the summit of his power, the blind master of an\r\nidiot world. He had wished for a _plebiscitum_, he had had one. He had\r\nat his feet this very William. It was at this moment that his crime\r\nsuddenly seized him. He did not struggle against it; he was the\r\ncondemned man who obeys his sentence. He submitted to everything which\r\nterrible Fate exacted from him. Never was there a more docile patient.\r\nHe had no army, he made war; he had only Rouher, he provoked Bismarck;\r\nhe had only Leboeuf, he attacked Moltke. He confided Strasburg to\r\nUhrich; he gave Metz to Bazaine to guard. He had 120,000 men at Châlons;\r\nhe had it in his power to cover Paris. He felt that his crime rose up\r\nthere, threatening and erect; he fled, not daring to face Paris. He\r\nhimself led--purposely, and yet despite himself; willing and yet\r\nunwilling, knowingly and yet unknowingly, a miserable mind, a prey to\r\nthe abyss--he led his army into a place of annihilation; he made that\r\nterrible choice, a battle-field without an outlet; he was no longer\r\nconscious of anything, no more of his blunder of to-day than of his\r\ncrime of former days; he must finish, but he could only finish as a\r\nfugitive; this condemned one was not worthy to look his end in the face;\r\nhe lowered his head, he turned his back. God executed him in degrading\r\nhim. Napoleon III. as an Emperor had a right to thunder, but for this\r\nman the thunder was ignominious--he was thunderstruck in the back.\r\n\r\n\r\n[40] \"L'Année Terrible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us forget this man, and let us look at Humanity.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of France by Germany, in 1870, was a night effect. The\r\nworld was astonished that so much gloom could come forth from a people.\r\nFive black months--such was the siege of Paris. To create night may\r\nprove Power, but Glory consists in the creation of daylight. France\r\ncreates daylight. Thence her immense human popularity. To her\r\nCivilization owes the dawn. The human mind in order to see clearly turns\r\nin the direction of France. Five months of darkness, that is what, in\r\n1870, Germany succeeded in giving to the Nations; France has given to\r\nthem four centuries of light.\r\n\r\nTo-day the civilized world more than ever feels the need which it has of\r\nFrance. France has proved this by her danger. The ungrateful apathy of\r\nGovernments only increased the anxiety of nations. At the sight of Paris\r\nthreatened, there arose among the peoples dread that their own heads\r\nwere in danger. Would they allow Germany to go on? But France saved\r\nherself quite alone. She had only to rise. _Patuit dea_.\r\n\r\nTo-day she is greater than ever. What would have killed another nation\r\nhas hardly wounded her. The darkening of her horizon has rendered her\r\nlight more visible. What she has lost in territory she has gained in\r\nradiancy. Moreover, she is fraternal without an effort. Above her\r\nmisfortune there is her smile. It is not on her that the Gothic Empire\r\nweighs. She is a nation of citizens and not a flock of subjects.\r\nFrontiers? Will there be any frontiers in twenty years? Victories?\r\nFrance counts in her past victories of war, and in her future victories\r\nof peace. The future belongs to Voltaire, and not to Krupp; the future\r\nbelongs to the book, and not to the sword. The future belongs to life,\r\nand not to death. There is in the policy opposed to France a certain\r\namount of the tomb; to seek life in the old institutions is a vain task,\r\nand to feed upon the past is to bite the dust. France has the faculty of\r\ngiving light; no catastrophe, political or military, will deprive her of\r\nthis mysterious supremacy. The cloud passes away, the star is seen once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe star possesses no anger; the dawn bears no malice. Light is\r\nsatisfied in being light. Light is everything; the human race has no\r\nother love. France knows herself beloved because she is good, and the\r\ngreatest of all powers is to be loved. The French revolution is for all\r\nthe world. It is a battle perpetually waged for Right, and perpetually\r\ngained for Truth. Right is the innermost part of man; Truth is the\r\ninnermost part of God. What can be done against a revolution which has\r\nso much right on its side? Nothing. To love it. That is what the nations\r\ndo. France offers herself, the world accepts her. The whole phenomenon\r\nlies in these few words. An invasion of armies can be resisted; an\r\ninvasion of ideas cannot be resisted. The glory of barbarians is to be\r\nconquered by humanity; the glory of savages is to be conquered by\r\ncivilization; the glory of darkness is to be conquered by the torch.\r\nThis is why France is desired and assented to by all. This is why,\r\nhaving no hatred, she has no fear; this is why she is fraternal and\r\nmaternal; this is why it is impossible to lessen her, impossible to\r\nhumiliate her, impossible to irritate her; this is why, after so many\r\nordeals, after so many catastrophes, after so many disasters, after so\r\nmany calamities, after so many falls, incorruptible and invulnerable she\r\nholds out her hand to all the peoples from above.\r\n\r\nWhen our glance rests on this old continent, stirred to-day by a new\r\nbreath, certain phenomena appear, and we seem to gain a glimpse of that\r\naugust and mysterious problem, the formation of the future. It may be\r\nsaid, that in the same manner as light is compounded of seven colors,\r\ncivilization is compounded of seven peoples. Of these peoples, three,\r\nGreece, Italy, and Spain, represent the South; three, England, Germany,\r\nand Russia, represent the north; the seventh, or the first, France, is\r\nat the same time North and South, Celtic and Latin, Gothic and Greek.\r\nThis country owes to its heaven this sublime good fortune, the crossing\r\nof two rays of light; the crossing of two rays of light is as though we\r\nwere to say the joining of two hands, that is to say Peace. Such is the\r\nprivilege of this France, she is at the same time solar and starry. In\r\nher heaven she possesses as much dawn as the East, and as many stars as\r\nthe North. Sometimes her glimmer rises in the twilight, but it is in the\r\nblack night of revolutions and of wars that her resplendence blazes\r\nforth, and her aurorean dawn becomes the Aurora Borealis.\r\n\r\nOne day, before long, the seven nations, which combine in themselves the\r\nwhole of humanity, will join together and amalgamate like the seven\r\ncolors of the prism, in a radiant celestial arch; the marvel of Peace\r\nwill appear eternal and visible above civilization, and the world,\r\ndazzled, will contemplate the immense rainbow of the United Peoples of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
