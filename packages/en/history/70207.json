Topin’s _L’Homme au Masque de Fer_, of which the present volume is a\r\ntranslation, has met with considerable attention in France, on the part\r\nboth of historical students and the reading public; several editions of\r\nit having been called for in the course of a few months.\r\n\r\nThat a work which professes to give an authentic account of this almost\r\nlegendary character, after having discussed in an exhaustive fashion\r\nthe various theories that have been broached during a century and a\r\nquarter respecting his mysterious identity, should have been received\r\nwith so large an amount of favour, is not surprising, for the story\r\nforms perhaps the most romantic episode of a reign more than ordinarily\r\nrich in dramatic incidents. But the extent of M. Topin’s historical\r\nknowledge, the painstaking nature of his researches, the subtlety of\r\nhis reasoning, the skill which he has displayed in the grouping of\r\nhis materials, combined with his life-like pictures of events far from\r\ncommonly familiar, not only render his work highly amusing reading,\r\nbut entitle it to take its place in the library, both as an historical\r\nstudy which has resolved beyond all doubt a problem that had long\r\nperplexed some of the acutest minds, and as a valuable contribution\r\ntowards the history of Europe during the latter part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the translation M. Topin’s text has been\r\ncarefully revised, and a few errors have been corrected. Additional\r\nnotes, too, have been given whenever the subject-matter seemed to\r\nrequire elucidation, or where individuals little known to English\r\nreaders make their appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\n                                                                   H. V.\r\n\r\n _Paris, April, 1870._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUTHOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this book had been intended merely to satisfy a vulgar and\r\ncommonplace curiosity, it would only have consisted of a few pages.\r\nMy aim has been a loftier one. I have endeavoured, while concerning\r\nmyself with the most famous and romantic of State-prisoners, to write\r\nthe history of the principal individuals in whom people have beheld the\r\nMan with the Iron Mask. As regards some of these I have been compelled\r\nto lay bare the private life of Louis XIII. and Anne of Austria, and in\r\norder to refute the accusations with which the memory of this princess\r\nhas been sullied, I have not hesitated to touch upon certain delicate\r\npoints, and to follow her accusers on to the ground on which they have\r\ncarried the discussion. But I have imposed upon myself the obligation\r\nof always respecting my readers, and of influencing their judgment\r\nwithout offending their taste. I have traced the others throughout\r\ntheir adventurous careers and agitated existences, and some of them\r\neven through their captivity, spent, sometimes in the monotonous\r\ninaction of solitude, sometimes with the resignation of the sage, or\r\nanimated more frequently still by daring attempts at flight which the\r\nincessant vigilance of the most scrupulous of gaolers always foiled.\r\nThus there will be found grouped together in this work Louis XIII. and\r\nAnne of Austria, the seductive Buckingham and the affecting Vermandois,\r\nthe versatile Monmouth and the adventurous Beaufort, Lauzun the rash,\r\nand Fouquet, rendered admirable by his resignation and Christian\r\nvirtues, the unfortunate Matthioly, and Saint-Mars, whose memory, and\r\neven existence, is inseparable from that of his prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe sole and firm ground-work of this book are the materials, for the\r\nmost part unpublished, to be found in our Archives. For the space of\r\ntwo years I have been collecting them in the different depositories of\r\nmanuscripts; and at the Ministries as at the Archives of the Empire,\r\nat the Imperial Library as well as at the Arsenal, at the Institute\r\nas at the Hôtel de Ville, I have everywhere met with the most cordial\r\nreception, the most unreserved liberality, and the most invaluable\r\ncourtesy. It is my duty, and at the same time my pleasure, to testify\r\nmy gratitude to MM. Camille Rousset, Gallet de Kulture, Margry, de\r\nBeauchesne, Lacroix, Ravaisson, Sage, Aude, and Read. The treasures of\r\nour Archives are not only rendered accessible by the goodwill of their\r\nKeepers, but are also made easy of consultation by the order which\r\nthese gentlemen have introduced among the profusion of documents by\r\nmeans of classifications as clear as they are ingenious.\r\n\r\nI have given in the text the more important documents of which I\r\nhave made use, and in the notes those which are of less consequence,\r\nwhilst I have contented myself with indicating the collections where\r\nthose materials are to be found which are altogether of a secondary\r\ncharacter. By this means the reader will have a complete check upon\r\nme. Without sacrificing anything of the strictest exactitude I have\r\nendeavoured to introduce into my account the spirit and the action\r\nproper to the individuals brought on to the scene, and, in a subject\r\nat once legendary and historical, to represent the faithful drawing of\r\nhistory under the seductive colouring of fiction.\r\n\r\n                                             _Paris,

Accompanying him, and borne along in his litter,\r\nwas a prisoner, whose face was covered with a black velvet mask, and\r\nof whom Saint-Mars, with an escort of several mounted men-at-arms, had\r\nbeen the inseparable and vigilant gaoler, throughout the long journey\r\nfrom Provence. Saint-Mars had halted at Palteau, an estate situated\r\nbetween Joigny and Villeneuve-le-Roi, which belonged to him, and for a\r\nlong time the old inhabitants of Villeneuve used to recall having seen\r\nthe mysterious litter traversing in the evening the principal street of\r\ntheir town. The remembrance of this apparition has been perpetuated\r\nin the district, and the singular incidents characterizing it, related\r\nby the former to each new generation, have been handed down to our own\r\ndays. The care taken by Saint-Mars at meal-times to keep his prisoner\r\nwith his back to the windows, the pistols which were always to be seen\r\nwithin reach, of the suspicious gaoler, the two beds which he caused to\r\nbe placed side by side, so many precautions, so much mystery, excited\r\nthe lively curiosity of the assembled peasants, and formed an incessant\r\nsubject of conversation among them. At the Bastille, the prisoner was\r\nplaced in the third room south of the Tower of La Bertaudière, prepared\r\nfor him by the turnkey Dujonca, who, some days previous to his arrival,\r\nhad received a written order to that effect from Saint-Mars.[1]\r\n\r\nFive years afterwards, on Tuesday, November 20, 1703, at four o’clock\r\nin the afternoon, the drawbridge of the formidable fortress was lowered\r\nand gave passage to a sad and mournful train. A few men, bearing a dead\r\nbody, having for sole escort two subordinate employés of the Bastille,\r\nsilently issued forth and directed their steps towards the cemetery\r\nof the Church of Saint-Paul. Nothing could be more thrilling than the\r\nsight of this group gliding along furtively under shadow of the falling\r\nnight. Nothing could be more utterly abandoned, and, in appearance,\r\nmore obscure, than these unknown remains followed by two strangers,\r\nin a hurry to fulfil their task. Around the grave as, the evening\r\nbefore, around the bed of the dying man, there were no signs of sorrow\r\nor of regret. The prisoner of Provence had fallen ill on the Sunday.\r\nHis illness having suddenly increased during the following day, the\r\nchaplain of the Bastille had been sent for; too late, however, to allow\r\nhim time to go in quest of the last sacraments, yet still sufficiently\r\nearly to enable him to address some rapid and common-place exhortations\r\nto the dying man. On the register of the Church of Saint-Paul he was\r\ninscribed under the name of Marchialy. At the Bastille he had always\r\nbeen known as the Prisoner of Provence.[2]\r\n\r\nSuch is the mysterious personage who, unknown and abandoned to the\r\nobscurity of a prison during the latter part of his existence, became,\r\na few years after his death, celebrated throughout the entire world,\r\nand the romantic and piquant remembrance of whom has, for more than a\r\ncentury, charmed the imagination of all, attracted universal attention,\r\nand exercised uselessly the patience and sagacity of so many minds.\r\nBecome the hero of the most famous of legends, he has had the rare\r\nprivilege of everywhere exciting the curiosity of the public, without\r\never either wearying or satiating it. At all epochs and among all\r\nclasses, in England, Germany, Italy, as well as France, in our own\r\ndays, as in the time of Voltaire, people have manifested the utmost\r\nanxiety to penetrate the secret of this long imprisonment. Napoleon\r\nI. greatly regretted not being able to satisfy this desire.[3] Louis\r\nPhilippe, too, discussed this problem, the solution of which he\r\nacknowledged himself ignorant of;[4] and, if other sovereigns[5] have\r\npretended they were acquainted with it, their contradictory statements\r\nlead us to believe that they were no better informed, but that in their\r\neyes the knowledge and transmission of the dark secret ought to be\r\ncounted among the prerogatives of the crown.\r\n\r\nIn the long list of writers whom the Man with the Iron Mask, the sphinx\r\nof our history, has attracted and tempted, are many illustrious names,\r\nas well as some less known now-a-days. During thirty years, Voltaire,\r\nFréron, Saint-Foix, Lagrange-Chancel, and Father Griffet took part in\r\na brilliant joust, in which each of the adversaries succeeded a great\r\ndeal better in overthrowing his opponent’s opinions than in securing\r\nthe triumph of his own.\r\n\r\nMany times, and in our own days even, has the debate been resumed,\r\nthen momentarily abandoned, then recommenced again. Far and near new\r\ntheories have been broached, invariably supported by vague and weak\r\nproofs, and soon overthrown by strong and valid objections. Fifty-two\r\nwriters[6] have by turns endeavoured to throw light upon this\r\nquestion, but without success; and it can be affirmed that a century of\r\ncontroversy and of exertion has not yet dissipated the mysterious gloom\r\nin which Saint-Mars’ celebrated prisoner is enveloped.\r\n\r\nSo many successive checks, by still further stimulating curiosity,\r\nhave caused it to be believed that it was impossible to arrive at an\r\nincontestable and definitive result. Every new explanation having been\r\nvictoriously repelled almost as soon as started, people have despaired\r\nof ever attaining the truth, and some have even gone so far as to\r\nproclaim it as being beyond human reach. “The story of the Iron Mask,”\r\nsays M. Michelet,[7] “will probably for ever remain obscure,” “The Man\r\nwith the Iron Mask will very likely always be an insoluble problem,”\r\nhas been said elsewhere;[8] and M. Henri Martin declares that “history\r\nhas not the right of pronouncing an opinion on what will never emerge\r\nfrom the domain of conjecture.”[9]\r\n\r\nIf different methods of procedure had been adopted by the numerous\r\nwriters who have attempted the solution of this problem, I should not\r\nhave had the temerity to have added to their number; but an attentive\r\nstudy of their writings shows that they have all taken the same\r\npoint of departure, and that they have all given themselves up to\r\na single idea. All have kept fixed in their minds this observation\r\nof Voltaire’s:--“What redoubles one’s astonishment is, that at the\r\ntime when this prisoner was sent to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, no\r\nimportant personage had disappeared from Europe.”[10]\r\n\r\nAll have asked themselves if there really did not disappear from Europe\r\nsome important personage, and they have immediately set themselves\r\nto discover some person of consideration, no matter who, that had\r\ndisappeared during the period extending from 1662 to 1703. When by\r\nthe aid of the very faintest resemblance they have fancied they have\r\nfound their hero, they have forthwith adapted the mask of black velvet\r\nto him, and have seen in him the famous dead of November 20, 1703.\r\nErecting their conjecture into a theory, they have become ardent\r\npropagators of it, and have adopted all that told in its favour with\r\nthe same readiness with which they have energetically denied all that\r\nhappened to be opposed to it. When the list of missing illustrious men\r\nbelonging to this period was exhausted, certain writers, sooner than\r\nrenounce seeing the Man with the Iron Mask in some person still alive\r\nin 1706, have had no other expedient than to delay for several years\r\nthe death of Saint-Mars’ prisoner, in order not to abandon so dear a\r\ndiscovery.[11]\r\n\r\nBut many of these ingenious and inventive writers acted in good faith.\r\nNot perceiving the defects in their pleading, they only considered its\r\nfeeblest parts, and in default of making a great number of converts,\r\nthey invariably ended, as is easy enough, by convincing themselves.\r\n\r\nPersuaded of the unsatisfactory nature of a method of procedure which\r\nhad always produced such ephemeral results, I have thought that,\r\nextraordinary means having proved so inefficacious, more simple ones\r\nmight perhaps lead to a new solution, (yet one hardly dared hope for\r\nit, when twenty-five hypotheses had already been put forward)--to a\r\nsolution at once decisive, to an absolute conviction, to the certainty\r\nof not having to apprehend from the reader either doubt or objection.\r\nCommencing the study of this question without any fixed opinion,\r\nand with the firm resolution of seeking only the truth, I set about\r\ncollecting from the whole of our archives authentic despatches relating\r\nto the State prisoners under Louis XIV. from the year 1660 to 1710.\r\nWithout pre-occupying myself with the Ministers who signed them, or\r\nthe prisoners whom they concerned; without limiting my researches to\r\nSaint-Mars, Pignerol, the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, or the Bastille,\r\nI arranged these despatches, of which more than three hundred are\r\nunpublished, in order of their dates. They then lent a material\r\nassistance; some explained others, and from this long and minute\r\ninquiry, slowly pursued through heaps of documents, has resulted, I\r\nhope, a definitive solution.\r\n\r\nIt was expedient this solution should be obtained.[12] In this\r\ncentury, when the historian’s resources are increased by the progress\r\nin certain sciences, by so many spectacles offered as an instruction to\r\nhis fruitful meditations, by a more complete knowledge of institutions\r\nand facts, by the facility afforded of penetrating into collections\r\nwhich it had been believed would remain for ever inaccessible to\r\ninvestigators--in this century, which is literally the century of\r\nhistory, it behoved us not to leave in our annals, without solving\r\nit, a problem which had so frequently attracted the attention of\r\nforeigners. It is this which determined me to undertake a task which\r\nsome may consider more curious than important. But to the interest\r\npeculiar to this subject has to be added that which is attached to\r\nthe principal persons in whom by turns people have seen the prisoner\r\nof Saint-Mars. Before bringing on the scene the true Man with the\r\nIron Mask, I shall examine rapidly, and with the aid of unpublished\r\ndocuments, the illustrious usurpers of this romantic title, so that\r\nthis work may serve, not only to satisfy a trivial curiosity, but also\r\nto throw a new light upon some of the most singular points of the inner\r\nhistory of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Estat de Prisonnies qui sont envoies par l’Ordre du Roy à la\r\nBastille, à commenser du mescredy honsiesme du mois d’Octobre que\r\nje suis entré en possession de la charge de Lieutenant du Roy, en\r\nl’année 1690_, by Dujonca, fol. 37, verso:--Archives of the Arsenal.\r\nLetter from Barbézieux, Minister of War, to Saint-Mars, dated July\r\n19, 1698:--“You can write in advance to His Majesty’s lieutenant of\r\nthis château to have a chamber ready to receive this prisoner on your\r\narrival.”--Unpublished despatch from the Archives of the Ministry\r\nof War.

Ravaisson, under the title of _Archives de la Bastille_, M. de\r\nLescure expressed a wish to see this question definitively settled. I\r\nhad been occupying myself with it for a considerable period, though\r\nnot without having satisfied myself that the learned conservator of\r\nthe Arsenal Archives contemplated no work on the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, in continuation of his publication, not yet brought down to the\r\nepoch of the entry into the Bastille of this famous prisoner. Among\r\ncontemporary authors, besides M. Paul Lacroix (Bibliophile Jacob), who\r\nin 1840 supported the theory that made Fouquet the celebrated prisoner,\r\nM. Jules Loiseleur, in the _Revue Contemporaine_ of July 31, 1867, and\r\nM. de Bellecombe, in the _Investigateur_ of May, 1868, have maintained,\r\nas the result of their labours, that the Man with the Iron Mask was\r\nan unknown and obscure spy, whose name would never be ascertained. We\r\nshall recur to the two studies of MM. Lacroix and Loiseleur, of which\r\none is very ingenious, and the other exhibits a penetrating sagacity,\r\nwhile both display a varied and trustworthy erudition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n Theory which supposes the Man with the Iron Mask to have been\r\n a Brother of Louis XIV.--Voltaire the first to support this\r\n Theory in his _Siècle de Louis XIV._, and in the _Dictionnaire\r\n Philosophique_--Certain Improbabilities in his Story--Account of the\r\n Man with the Iron Mask introduced by Soulavie into the _Mémoires\r\n Apocryphes du Maréchal de Richelieu_--The three different Hypotheses\r\n of the Theory which makes the Man with the Iron Mask a Brother of\r\n Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous theories which attempt to explain the existence of\r\nthe Man with the Iron Mask,[13] some have been imagined so carelessly,\r\nconceived with so much haste, and supported in so loose a manner, that\r\nthey are not worthy of a serious examination, and simply to mention\r\nthem will suffice to do them justice. But there are others, due to an\r\ningenious inspiration, and sustained with incontestable talent, which,\r\nwithout being true, have at least many appearances of being so. Among\r\nothers, the most devoid of proofs, but also the most romantic, is that\r\nwhich makes the Man with the Iron Mask a brother of Louis XIV. “There\r\nare many things which everybody says because they have been said once,”\r\nremarks Montesquieu.[14] This is especially true of things which border\r\non the extraordinary and the marvellous. So, there are few persons who,\r\non hearing the Man with the Iron Mask mentioned, do not immediately\r\nevoke a brother of Louis XIV. Whether the result of an intrigue between\r\nAnne of Austria and the Duke of Buckingham,[15] or a legitimate son\r\nof Louis XIII. and twin brother of Louis XIV., matters little to\r\npopular imagination. These are but different branches of a system which\r\nis profoundly engrafted in the public mind, and which it will not be\r\nunprofitable to overthrow separately, since it has still innumerable\r\npartisans, and touches upon the rights, moreover, the Bourbons have had\r\nto the throne of France.\r\n\r\nBy whom was this widely-spread opinion first put forward? And by whom\r\nhas it been revived in our own days? What proofs, or, at least, what\r\nprobabilities are invoked in its support? On what recollections, on\r\nwhat writings, is such a supposition based? Does it agree with official\r\ndocuments? Is it in accord with the character of Anne of Austria or\r\nwith that of Louis XIII.? Is it founded on reason?\r\n\r\nFirst Voltaire,[16] in his _Siècle de Louis XIV._, published in 1751,\r\nwrote the following lines, destined to excite a lively attention\r\nand to start a theory which he only completed in his _Dictionnaire\r\nPhilosophique_:--\r\n\r\n“Some months after the death of Mazarin,” he says, “an event occurred\r\nwhich has no parallel, and what is no less strange, all the historians\r\nhave ignored it. There was sent with the greatest secresy to the\r\nchâteau of the Isle Sainte-Marguerite, in the Sea of Provence, an\r\nunknown prisoner, above the average height, and of a most handsome and\r\nnoble countenance. This prisoner, on the journey, wore a mask, the\r\nchin-piece of which was furnished with steel springs, which left him\r\nfree to eat with the mask covering his face. Orders had been given\r\nto kill him if he should remove it. He remained in the island till a\r\nconfidential officer, named Saint-Mars, governor of Pignerol, having\r\nbeen appointed governor of the Bastille in 1690, went to fetch him in\r\nthe Isle Sainte-Marguerite and conducted him to the Bastille, always\r\nmasked. The Marquis de Louvois went to see him in this island before\r\nhis removal, and spoke to him standing, and with a consideration which\r\nbetokened respect. This unknown individual was taken to the Bastille,\r\nwhere he was lodged as well as he could be in the château. Nothing\r\nthat he asked for was refused him. His greatest liking was for linen\r\nof an extraordinary fineness and for lace; he played on the guitar. He\r\nhad the very best of everything, and the governor rarely sat down in\r\nhis presence. An old doctor of the Bastille, who had often attended\r\nthis singular man in his illnesses, has stated that he never saw his\r\nface, although he had examined his tongue and the rest of his body. He\r\nwas admirably made, said this doctor; his skin was rather brown: he\r\ninterested one by the mere tone of his voice, never complaining of his\r\nstate, and not letting it be understood who he could be. This stranger\r\ndied in 1703, and was interred during the night in the parish church\r\nof Saint-Paul. What redoubles one’s astonishment is that at the period\r\nwhen he was sent to the Isle Sainte-Marguerite, there had disappeared\r\nfrom Europe no important personage. This prisoner was without doubt\r\none, since this is what occurred shortly after his arrival in the\r\nisland:--The governor himself used to place the dishes on the table,\r\nand then to withdraw after having locked him in. One day, the prisoner\r\nwrote with a knife on a silver plate, and threw the plate out of the\r\nwindow towards a boat which was on the shore, almost at the foot of the\r\ntower. A fisherman, to whom the boat belonged, picked up the plate and\r\ncarried it to the governor. He, astonished, asked the fisherman: ‘Have\r\nyou read what is written on this plate, and has any one seen it in your\r\npossession?’ ‘I do not know how to read,’ answered the fisherman; ‘I\r\nhave just found it, and nobody has seen it.’ The peasant was detained\r\nuntil the governor had ascertained that he could not read, and that the\r\nplate had been seen by nobody. ‘Go,’ he then said to him, ‘you are very\r\nlucky not to know how to read!’”[17]\r\n\r\nThe following is the explanation by which, in his _Dictionnaire\r\nPhilosophique_, Voltaire, under his editor’s name, afterwards completed\r\nthis first story: “The Man with the Iron Mask was doubtless a brother,\r\nand an elder brother of Louis XIV., whose mother had that taste for\r\nfine linen on which M. de Voltaire relies. It was from reading the\r\n_Mémoires_ of the period which relate this anecdote concerning the\r\nQueen, that, recollecting this very taste of the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, I no longer doubted that he was her son, of which all the other\r\ncircumstances had already convinced me. It is known that Louis XIII.\r\nhad not lived with the Queen for a considerable time, and that the\r\nbirth of Louis XIV. was only due to a lucky chance.” Voltaire proceeds\r\nto relate that previous to the birth of Louis XIV., Anne of Austria\r\nhad been delivered of a son of whom Louis XIII. was not the father,\r\nand that she had confided the secret of his birth to Richelieu:\r\nhe then goes on to say,--“But the Queen and the Cardinal, equally\r\npenetrated with the necessity of hiding the existence of the Man with\r\nthe Iron Mask from Louis XIII., had him brought up in secresy. This\r\nwas unknown to Louis XIV. until the death of the Cardinal de Mazarin.\r\nBut this monarch, learning then that he had a brother, and an elder\r\nbrother, whom his mother could not disavow, who, moreover, perhaps had\r\ncharacteristic features which betokened his origin, and reflecting\r\nthat this child, born during marriage, could not, without great\r\ninconvenience and a horrible scandal, be declared illegitimate after\r\nLouis XIII.’s death, may have considered that he could not make use of\r\nwiser and better means to assure his own security and the tranquillity\r\nof the State than those which he employed, means which dispensed with\r\nhis committing a cruelty which policy would have represented as being\r\nnecessary to a monarch less conscientious and less magnanimous than\r\nLouis XIV.”[18]\r\n\r\nWhat improbabilities, what contradictions, what errors accumulated\r\nin a few pages! This unknown, whom no one, not even his doctor, has\r\never seen unmasked, has his face described as “handsome and noble;”\r\nSaint-Mars, named governor of the Bastille in 1690, and traversing\r\nthe whole of France in order to fetch a prisoner, for whom during\r\neight-and-twenty years another gaoler had sufficed; this mask with\r\nsteel springs covering day and night the face of the unknown without\r\naffecting his health; this resignation which prevented his complaining\r\nof his position and which did not allow him to give any one a\r\nglimmering as to who he was, and this eagerness to throw out of his\r\nwindow silver plates on which he had written his name; this peculiar\r\ntaste for fine linen, which Anne of Austria also possessed, and which\r\nrevealed his origin; this haste on her part to confess her adultery to\r\nher enemy, the Cardinal de Richelieu; the Queen of France making only\r\nthe Prime Minister the confidant of her confinement; and these two\r\nevents, the birth and the abduction of a royal child, so well concealed\r\nthat no contemporary memoir makes mention of them: such are the\r\nreflections which immediately suggest themselves on reading this story.\r\n\r\nNo less improbable, and more romantic still, is the fictitious account\r\ngiven by the governor himself of the Man with the Iron Mask, and which\r\nSoulavie has introduced into the apocryphal memoirs of the Marshal\r\nde Richelieu.[19] “The unfortunate prince whom I have brought up and\r\nguarded to the end of my days,” says the governor,[20] “was born 5th\r\nSeptember, 1638, at half-past eight in the evening, while the King was\r\nat supper. His brother, now reigning (Louis XIV.), was born at twelve\r\nin the morning, during his father’s dinner. But while the birth of\r\nthe King was splendid and brilliant, that of his brother was sad and\r\ncarefully concealed. Louis XIII. was warned by the midwife that the\r\nQueen would have a second delivery, and this double birth had been\r\nannounced to him a long time previously by two herdsmen, who asserted\r\nin Paris that if the Queen was brought to bed of two Dauphins, it\r\nwould be the consummation of the State’s misfortune. The Cardinal de\r\nRichelieu, consulted by the King, replied that, if the Queen should\r\nbring twin sons into the world it would be necessary to carefully hide\r\nthe second, because he might one day wish to be King. Louis XIII. was\r\nconsequently patient in his uncertainty. When the pains of the second\r\nlabour commenced, he was overwhelmed with emotion.” The Queen is\r\ndelivered of a second child “more delicate and more handsome than the\r\nfirst.” The midwife is charged with him, “and the Cardinal afterwards\r\ntook upon himself the education of this Prince who was destined to\r\nreplace the Dauphin if the latter should die. As for the shepherds\r\nwho prophesied on the subject of Anne of Austria’s confinement, the\r\ngovernor did not hear them spoken of any more, whence he concludes that\r\nthe Cardinal found a means of sending them away.”\r\n\r\n“Dame Péronnette, the midwife, brought the Prince up as her own son,\r\nand he passed for being the bastard of some great lord of the time.\r\nThe Cardinal confided him later to the governor to educate him as\r\na King’s son, and this governor took him into Burgundy to his own\r\nhouse. The Queen-mother seemed to fear that if the birth of this young\r\nDauphin should be discovered, the malcontents would revolt, because\r\nmany doctors think that the last-born of twin brothers is really the\r\nelder, and therefore King by right. Nevertheless, Anne of Austria could\r\nnot prevail upon herself to destroy the documents which established\r\nthis birth. The Prince, at the age of nineteen, became acquainted with\r\nthis State secret by searching in a casket belonging to his governor,\r\nin which he discovered letters from the Queen and the Cardinals de\r\nRichelieu and Mazarin. But, in order better to assure himself of his\r\ntrue condition, he asked for portraits of the late and present Kings.\r\nThe governor replied that what he had were so bad that he was waiting\r\nfor better ones to be painted, in order to place them in his apartment.\r\nThe young man proposed to go to Saint-Jean de Luz, where the court was\r\nstaying, on account of the King’s marriage with the Spanish Infanta,\r\nand compare himself with his brother. His governor detained him, and no\r\nlonger quitted his side.\r\n\r\n“The young Prince was then handsome as Cupid, and Cupid was very\r\nuseful to him in getting him a portrait of his brother, for a servant\r\nwith whom he had an intrigue procured him one. The Prince recognized\r\nhimself, and rushed to his governor, exclaiming, ‘This is my brother,\r\nand here is what I am!’ The governor despatched a messenger to court\r\nto ask for fresh instructions. The order came to imprison them both\r\ntogether.”[21]\r\n\r\n“It is at last known, this secret which has excited so lively and so\r\ngeneral a curiosity!”[22] says Champfort, in noticing these fictitious\r\n_Mémoires du Maréchal de Richelieu_. This implacable and sceptic railer\r\nallowed himself to be really seduced by this interpretation. Many\r\nothers were convinced with him, which exonerates them; and the version\r\ngiven by Voltaire was rather neglected for that of Soulavie.\r\n\r\nIn our own days, the theory which makes the Man with the Iron Mask a\r\nbrother of Louis XIV. has been supported by four writers, who have\r\npowerfully contributed to revive it, and render it more popular still.\r\nThe first two, by transferring to the stage,[23] and the third, by\r\nweaving into the plot of one of his most ingenious romances[24] the\r\npathetic fate of the mysterious prisoner, have sought less to instruct\r\nthan to interest their readers, and have completely succeeded in the\r\npurpose they had in view. The fourth writer, who, with MM. Fournier,\r\nArnould, and Alexandre Dumas, has adopted the romantic theory, is an\r\nhistorian, M. Michelet.[25]\r\n\r\nBefore showing that this pretended brother of Louis XIV. could not be\r\nthe unknown prisoner brought by Saint-Mars to the Bastille in 1698, let\r\nus seek when and how this theory could have been started, and, to the\r\nend that the refutation may be complete and definitive, let us see if\r\nhis birth is not as imaginary as his adventures. There are three dates\r\nassigned for this birth--in 1625, after the visit to France of the Duke\r\nof Buckingham, who has been considered as the father of the Man with\r\nthe Iron Mask; in 1631, a few months after the grave illness of Louis\r\nXIII., which caused the accession to the throne of his brother, Gaston\r\nof Orléans, to be feared; and lastly, September 5, 1638, a few hours\r\nafter Louis XIV. came into the world.[26]\r\n\r\nIf, in this searching examination, we touch upon delicate points--if,\r\nin order to destroy the unjust accusations with which the memory of\r\nAnne of Austria has been defaced, we penetrate deeply into the details\r\nof her private life and that of her royal husband--we are drawn thither\r\nby those who, by carrying the debate on to this ground, compel us to\r\nfollow them. We shall unhesitatingly touch upon each of the memories\r\nwhich they have not feared to recall, and nothing will be omitted that\r\ncan throw light upon our proof. We shall, nevertheless, strive not to\r\nforget what is due to our readers, and the necessity of convincing them\r\nwill not make us negligent of the obligation we are under of respecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] We shall speak of these briefly further on. We believe it useless\r\nto mention, otherwise than in a short note, the opinion of those who,\r\ndespairing of finding the solution of the Man with the Iron Mask, have\r\ntaken upon themselves to deny his existence. All the documents which we\r\nhave just cited (official despatches of the Ministry of War, Dujonca’s\r\n_Journal_, &c. &c.) clearly establish the fact that a prisoner was\r\nsent with Saint-Mars to the Bastille in 1698, and that he died there\r\nin 1703, without any one ever having known his name. The silence of\r\nthe _Mémoires de Saint-Simon_, which is very thoughtlessly evoked in\r\nsupport of the theory in question, will be explained very naturally\r\nin the course of this work. Neither is there any need to enlarge upon\r\nan opinion put forward a short time since in certain journals, which\r\nmakes the Man with the Iron Mask a son of Louis XIV. and the Duchess\r\nof Orléans. This opinion, which there is nothing whatever to prove,\r\nwhich rests upon no document, nor even upon any historical fact, is,\r\nmoreover, set forth in an article filled with errors. The only cause\r\nof the disgrace of the Marquis de Vardes, exiled to his government\r\nof Aigues-Mortes, was an intrigue in which he played an important\r\npart, and which had for its object the overthrow of Mademoiselle de\r\nla Vallière and the substitution of another mistress for her. As to\r\nthe death of the Duchess of Orléans, it is now demonstrated that it\r\nwas not due to poison. M. Mignet, in his _Négociations Relatives, à\r\nla Succession d’ Espagne_ (vol. iii. p. 206), was the first to deny\r\nthis poisoning, relying principally on a very conclusive despatch\r\nfrom Lionne to Colbert, of the 1st July, 1670. Since then, M. Littré,\r\nin the second number of _La Philosophie Positive_, has incontestably\r\nestablished by the examination of the _procès-verbaux_, and of all\r\nthe circumstances relating to the death of Henrietta of England,\r\nthat it must be attributed to an internal disease, unknown to the\r\nphysicians of that period. [The Duchess of Orléans here referred to\r\nis Henrietta-Maria, youngest daughter of Charles I. of England, who\r\nmarried Philip, younger brother of Louis XIV., and first Duke of the\r\nexisting branch of the House of Orléans.--_Trans._]\r\n\r\n[14] _Grandeur et Décadence des Romains_, chap. iv.\r\n\r\n[15] The grave English historian, David Hume, has re-echoed this\r\ntheory, supported also by the Marquis de Luchet, in his _Remarques sur\r\nle Masque de Fer_, 1783.\r\n\r\n[16] The _Mémoires Secrets pour servir à l’ Histoire de Perse_,\r\nAmsterdam, 1745, had already revealed the existence of Saint-Mars’\r\nprisoner, and maintained that he was the Duke de Vermandois, a natural\r\nson of Louis XIV. and Mademoiselle de la Vallière. We shall recur to\r\nthem when considering this theory, in the same way as we shall speak,\r\nwith reference to the principal theories put forward, of the works\r\nwhich have discussed them, without regard to the period at which they\r\nhave appeared.\r\n\r\n[17] _Siècle de Louis XIV._, chap. xxv.\r\n\r\n[18] Voltaire, _Dictionnaire Philosophique_, vol. i. p. 375, 376.\r\nEdition of 1771.\r\n\r\n[19] London, 1790. It is known that Soulavie used the notes and papers\r\nof the Marshal de Richelieu with such bad faith, that the Duke de\r\nFronsac launched an energetic protest against his father’s ex-secretary.\r\n\r\n[20] “Account of the birth and education of the unfortunate prince\r\nremoved by the Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin from society, and\r\nimprisoned by order of Louis XIV., composed by the governor of the\r\nprince on his deathbed.” (_Mémoires du Maréchal de Richelieu_, vol.\r\niii. chap. 4.)\r\n\r\n[21] This story is closely reproduced in Grimm’s Correspondence, on the\r\nassumed authority of an original letter from the Duchess de Modena,\r\ndaughter of the Regent d’Orléans, said to have been found by M. de la\r\nBorde, a former valet-de-chambre of Louis XV., among the papers of\r\nMarshal Richelieu, who was the Duchess’s lover.--See _Corespondence\r\nLittéraire, Philosophique, &c., de Grunen et de Diderot_, vol. xiv.,\r\npp. 419-23.

Very probably the child was an _elder_ brother of\r\nLouis XIV., and his birth obscured the question (important to them) of\r\nknowing if their ancestor, Louis XIV., had reigned legitimately.”\r\n\r\n[26] I shall not examine in detail the hypothesis which makes him a\r\nchild of Anne of Austria and Mazarin, since it is abandoned even by\r\nthose who are the most eager to see a brother of Louis XIV. in the\r\nprisoner. “It is doubtful,” says M. Michelet, “if the prisoner had\r\nbeen a younger brother of Louis XIV., a son of the Queen and Mazarin,\r\nwhether the succeeding kings would have kept the secret so well.”\r\nMoreover, the general arguments which I shall advance in Chapter V.\r\nwill apply equally to a son of Mazarin, of Buckingham, or of Louis\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n First Hypothesis--Portrait of Buckingham--Causes of his Visit to\r\n France--Ardour with which he was received--His Passion for Anne of\r\n Austria--Character of this Princess--Journey to Amiens--Scene in the\r\n Garden--The Remembrance that Anne of Austria preserved of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, charged by Charles I. with conducting\r\nHenrietta-Maria, the new Queen of England, to London, arrived in Paris,\r\nMay 24, 1625.[27] This brilliant and audacious nobleman, who had\r\nknown how to become and to remain the ruling favourite of two kings\r\nutterly different in character and mind, and who, from a very humble\r\nposition, had raised himself to the highest posts in the State, enjoyed\r\nthroughout the whole of Europe the most striking renown. He owed it,\r\nhowever, less to the favours with which James I. had loaded him, and\r\nwhich his son had continued, than to his attractive qualities and his\r\nromantic adventures. All that Nature could bestow of grace, charm,\r\nand the power of pleasing, he had received in profusion. Deficient in\r\nthe more precious gifts which retain, he possessed all those which\r\nattract. He was well made, had a very handsome countenance,[28] was\r\nof a proud bearing without being haughty, and knew how to affect,\r\naccording to circumstances, the emotion which he wished to communicate\r\nto others, but did not feel himself. During a long stay in France,\r\nhe had succeeded in rendering exquisite those manners which were\r\nnaturally delicate, and had become accomplished in all the arts which\r\ndisplay the elegance of the body. He excelled in arms, showed himself\r\na clever horseman, and danced with a rare perfection. The adventurous\r\nvisit to Spain which he had made with the Prince of Wales[29] had\r\nincreased his reputation for elegant frivolity, and the successes which\r\nhis good looks and audacity had secured him made people forget the\r\ndefects of the incautious negotiator. Already extravagant during his\r\nearly poverty, he dissipated his fortune as if he had always lived in\r\nthe opulence for which he seemed born, displaying a magnificence and\r\na pomp unknown in a like degree before his time. Moreover, volatile\r\nand presumptuous, as inconstant as pliant, without profundity in his\r\nviews, without connection in his projects, clever in maintaining\r\nhimself in power, but disastrous to the sovereigns whom he governed,\r\nby turns insolently familiar and irresistibly attractive, sometimes\r\nadmired by the crowd for his supreme distinction, at others execrated\r\nfor his fatal authority, not low but impetuous in his caprices, not\r\nknowing either how to foresee or to accept an obstacle, and sacrificing\r\neverything to his fancy, he possessed none of the qualities of the\r\nstatesman although he may have had all those which characterize the\r\ncourtier.\r\n\r\nHe was expected, and was received in Paris with the most eager\r\ncuriosity. “M. de Buckingham,” wrote Richelieu to the Marquis d’Effiat,\r\n“will find in me the friendship which he might expect from a true\r\nbrother who will render him all the services which he could desire of\r\nany one in the world,”[30] and Louis XIII. caused to be said to him, “I\r\nassure you that you will not be considered a stranger here, but a true\r\nFrenchman, since you are one in heart, and have shown in this marriage\r\nnegotiation such uniform affection for the welfare and service of the\r\ntwo crowns, that I think as much of it, so far as I am concerned, as\r\nthe King your master. You will be very welcome here, and you will have\r\naccess to me on all occasions.”[31]\r\n\r\nFrom the day of his arrival, Buckingham really showed himself “a\r\ntrue Frenchman” by his manner of behaving, by the ease and freedom\r\nof his movements. “He entered the court,” says La Rochefoucauld,\r\n“with more splendour, grandeur, and magnificence than if he were\r\nKing.”[32] Eight great lords and four-and-twenty knights accompanied\r\nhim. Twenty gentlemen and twelve pages were attached to his person,\r\nand his entire suite was composed of six or seven hundred pages or\r\nattendants.[33] “He had all the treasures of the Crown of England to\r\nexpend, and all its jewels to wear.”[34] He alighted at the splendid\r\nHôtel de Luynes in the Rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre, which was then\r\ncalled the Hôtel de Chevreuse, “the most richly furnished hotel which\r\nFrance at present possesses,” says the _Mercure_, and for several\r\ndays the people of Paris were dazzled by the extraordinary luxury\r\ndisplayed by the ostentatious foreigner.[35] The admiration at the\r\ncourt was quite as lively, and Buckingham there pushed liberality to\r\nextravagance. Each of his sumptuous costumes was covered with pearls\r\nand diamonds intentionally fastened on so badly that a great number\r\nfell off, which the duke refused to receive when they were brought to\r\nhim. His prodigality, the importance of his mission, the seductiveness\r\nwhich enveloped his past life, and the amiability which he invariably\r\ndisplayed, his title of foreigner which rendered his perfectly French\r\nmanners more piquant, that art of pleasing which was so easy to him,\r\nall contributed to make him alike the hero both of the town and of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nGiddy with a success which surpassed even his expectations, and dazzled\r\nby the splendour which he shed around him, he saw only the Queen of\r\nFrance worthy of his homage, and suddenly conceived for her the most\r\nvehement passion. Too frivolous to bury this sentiment in his heart,\r\nhe displayed it with complacency, and his temerity increased with\r\nhis ostentation. Anne of Austria was a Spaniard and a coquette. She\r\nunderstood gallantry such as her country-women had learned it from\r\nthe Moors--that gallantry “which permits men to entertain without\r\ncriminal intentions tender sentiments for women; which inspires in\r\nthem fine actions, liberality, and all kinds of virtue.”[36] “She did\r\nnot consider,” says one who best knew Anne of Austria, “that the fine\r\ntalk, which is ordinarily called honest gallantry, where no particular\r\nengagement is entered into, could ever be blamable.”[37]\r\n\r\nSo she tolerated with indulgence and without astonishment a passion\r\ncongenial to her recollections of her country and her youth, and\r\nwhich, while flattering her self-esteem, did not at all shock her\r\nvirtue. She received this homage of vanity with the complacency of\r\ncoquetry, knowing herself to be most beautiful, most powerful, and\r\nmost worthy of being loved. On Buckingham’s side there was indiscreet\r\npersistence, multiplied signs of being in love, and eagerness to be\r\nnear her; on hers, timid encouragement, gentle sternness, severity and\r\npardon by turns in her looks appeared to Anne of Austria the natural\r\nand ordinary incidents of a gallantry where neither her honour nor\r\neven her reputation seemed exposed to any peril. Moreover, if numerous\r\nfestivities gave them frequent opportunities of seeing one another, the\r\ncourt being always present at the many interviews of the Ambassador\r\nwith the Queen, restrained and embarrassed the enterprising audacity of\r\nthe one, but entirely justified the confidence of the other.\r\n\r\nAfter a week devoted to ballets, banquets, and feats of horsemanship,\r\nthe wife of Charles I. set out on June 2 for England, conducted by the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, the Earls of Holland and Carlisle, and the Duke and\r\nDuchess de Chevreuse. Louis XIII., who was ill, remained at Compiègne;\r\nbut Anne of Austria, as well as Marie de Medicis, accompanied by a\r\ngreat number of French lords, proceeded to Amiens. There the brilliant\r\nassemblies recommenced, and the Duke de Chaulnes, governor of the\r\nprovince, gave the three Queens a most magnificent reception. During\r\nseveral days the whole of the nobility of the neighbourhood came to\r\noffer their homage and augment the brilliancy of the pleasure-parties\r\nand fêtes given by the governor. The town not containing a palace\r\nsufficiently large to receive the three Queens, they were lodged\r\nseparately, each being accompanied by a train of intimates and lords,\r\nwho formed a little court for her. Buckingham almost constantly\r\ndeserted his new sovereign in order to show himself wherever Anne of\r\nAustria was. Attached to the abode of the latter was a large garden,\r\nnear the banks of the Somme. The Queen and her court were fond of\r\nwalking in it. One evening, attracted, as usual, by the beauty of the\r\nplace, and tempted by the mildness of the weather, Anne of Austria,\r\naccompanied by Buckingham, the Duchess de Chevreuse, Lord Holland, and\r\nall the ladies of her suite, prolonged her promenade later than usual.\r\nViolently enamoured, and arrived at such a pitch of self-conceit that\r\neverything seemed possible, the Duke was very tender, and even dared\r\nto be importunate. The early departure of Henrietta Maria rendered\r\ntheir separation imminent. Favoured by the falling night, and taking\r\nadvantage of a moment of isolation due to the winding of a path,\r\nhe threw himself at the Queen’s feet, and wished to give way to the\r\ntransports of his passion. But Anne, alarmed, and perceiving the danger\r\nthat she ran, uttered a loud cry, and Putange, her equerry, who was\r\nwalking a few steps behind her, rushed forward and seized the Duke. All\r\nthe suite arrived in turn, and Buckingham managed to get away in the\r\nmidst of the crowd.[38]\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards Henrietta Maria quitted Amiens for Boulogne; Marie\r\nde Medicis and Anne of Austria accompanied her to the gates of the\r\ntown. Anne of Austria was in a carriage with the Princess de Conti. It\r\nwas there that Buckingham took leave of her. Bending down to bid her\r\nadieu, he covered himself with the window-curtain, in order to hide his\r\ntears, which fell profusely. The Queen was moved at this display of\r\ngrief, and the Princess de Conti, “who gracefully rallied her, told her\r\nthat she could answer to the King for her virtue, but that she would\r\nnot do as much for her cruelty, as she suspected her eyes of having\r\nregarded this lover with some degree of pity.”[39]\r\n\r\nToo passionately enamoured for separation to be able to cure him of\r\nhis love, and excited still more to see Anne of Austria again by the\r\nrecollection of his gross rashness, the Duke of Buckingham, whom\r\nunfavourable winds detained at Boulogne, returned suddenly to Amiens\r\nwith Lord Holland, under pretence of having an important letter to\r\ndeliver to Marie de Medicis, who, owing to a slight illness, had\r\nnot quitted this town. “Returned again!” said Anne of Austria to\r\nNogent-Bautru, on learning this news; “I thought that we were delivered\r\nfrom him.”[40] She had been bled that morning, and was in bed when the\r\ntwo English noblemen entered her chamber. Buckingham, blinded by his\r\npassion, threw himself on his knees before the Queen’s bed, embracing\r\nthe coverings with ecstasy, and exhibiting, to the great scandal of\r\nthe ladies of honour, the impetuous sentiments which agitated him.\r\nThe Countess de Lannoi wished to force him to rise, telling him, with\r\nseverity, that such behaviour was not according to French customs. “I\r\nam not French,” replied the Duke, and he continued, but always in the\r\npresence of several witnesses, to eloquently express his tenderness\r\nfor the Queen. The latter, being very much embarrassed, could not at\r\nfirst say anything; then she complained of such boldness, but without\r\na great deal of indignation; and it is probable that her heart took no\r\npart in the reproaches which she addressed to the duke. The next day he\r\ndeparted a second time for Boulogne, and never again saw the Queen of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nSuch is the famous scene at Amiens, which furnished opportunities\r\nfor the gross liveliness of Tallemant des Réaux and the libertine\r\nimagination of the Cardinal de Retz.[41] The statements of La Porte,\r\nwho was present, of Madame de Motteville, who collected her information\r\nfrom eye-witnesses, and of La Rochefoucauld, less likely to show\r\npartiality, leave no doubt of Anne of Austria’s innocence. Marie de\r\nMedicis, whose interest it then was to injure her with Louis XIII., and\r\nwho often did so without scruple, could not on this occasion, says La\r\nPorte,[42] “avoid bearing witness to the truth, and telling the King\r\nthat there was nothing in it; that if the Queen might have been willing\r\nto act wrongly, it would have been impossible, with so many people\r\nabout her who were watching her, and that she could not prevent the\r\nDuke of Buckingham having esteem or even love for her. She related also\r\na number of things of this kind which had happened to herself in her\r\nyouth.”\r\n\r\nMarie de Medicis might also have quoted examples from the life of Anne\r\nof Austria herself, who had previously loved the Duke de Montmorency\r\nand the Duke de Bellegarde without her honour having been tarnished\r\nby so doing.[43] The recollection of Buckingham’s love dwelt more\r\nprofoundly in the memory of all, because his passion had been more\r\nfiery and had been manifested by incautious acts. But to the end of\r\nthe Queen’s life, even after the death of Louis XIII., and during the\r\nregency, it was in her presence a subject of conversation which she\r\nlistened to complacently, because it flattered her self-esteem, and\r\nwhich she would certainly not have tolerated, had any one dared to\r\nstart it, if this recollection had been to her a cause for remorse. Far\r\nfrom this, people familiarly jested with her about it with grace, and\r\nwithout offending her, since they could thus remind her of a liking\r\nwhich had been sufficiently strong, but had not led her to commit any\r\nfault. Richelieu, presenting Mazarin to the Queen, said, “You will\r\nlike him, madam, he has Buckingham’s manner.”[44] Much later Anne of\r\nAustria, when Regent, meeting Voiture walking along in a dreamy state,\r\nin her garden of Ruel, and asking him what he was thinking of, received\r\nin reply these verses, which did not at all offend her:--\r\n\r\n  “Je pensais que la destinée,\r\n  Après tant d’injustes malheurs,\r\n  Vous a justement couronnée\r\n  De gloire, d’éclat et d’honneurs;\r\n  Mais que vous étiez plus heureuse\r\n  Lorsque vous étiez autrefois,\r\n  Je ne veux pas dire amoureuse,\r\n  La rime le veut toutefois.\r\n\r\n  Je pensais (que nos autres poëtes\r\n  Nous pensons extravagamment)\r\n  Ce que, dans l’humeur où vous êtes,\r\n  Vous feriez si, dans ce moment,\r\n  Vous avisiez en cette place\r\n  Venir le Duc de Buckingham,\r\n  Et lequel serait en disgrâce,\r\n  De lui ou du père Vincent.”[45]\r\n\r\nEverything combines to absolve Anne of Austria from the crime of which\r\nshe was accused during the troubles of the Fronde, and in the midst of\r\nthe unjust passions aroused by civil war. Louis XIII.’s conduct with\r\nrespect to her, and his persistent coldness, alone seemed to condemn\r\nher. But does this coldness date from Buckingham’s stay in Paris? Were\r\nthe isolation in which Louis XIII. often remained and his neglect of\r\nthe Queen such as people have believed up to the present time? Must\r\nwe admit, as has been maintained, the proof of a criminal infidelity\r\non the part of this Princess, deliberately committed either with\r\nBuckingham in 1625, or with an unknown individual, in 1630, with the\r\nview of being able, at the instant of Louis XIII.’s death, which then\r\nseemed imminent, to reign in the name of a child of whom she should be\r\n_enceinte_, and who, after the unexpected recovery of the King, became\r\nthe Man with the Iron Mask?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] _Mercure Français_, 1625, pp. 365, 366.\r\n\r\n[28] _Mémoires de Madame de Motteville_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[29] The Prince of Wales had been on the point of espousing the Infanta\r\nMaria, Anne of Austria’s sister, and had proceeded to Spain with\r\nBuckingham, in order to hasten the conclusion of this project.

Contrary to what frequently happens in\r\nthe case of royal marriages, the obligations imposed on the Infanta by\r\nher rank were not repugnant to the sentiments of the woman, and when\r\nshe crossed the French frontier for the first time, she realized a\r\nhope long since conceived and dearly cherished in her heart. With only\r\neight days between their births and at once betrothed to one another\r\nin public opinion, the Infanta and the Dauphin had been the object of\r\nthe researches and predictions of all the astrologers of the time,[47]\r\nwho proclaimed that, having come into the world under the same sign,\r\nthey were destined to love each other, even though they might not be\r\nunited. The Infanta had believed in this augury. She had early liked\r\nto hear the young King spoken of, she sought after his portraits, she\r\npreferred garments of French cut, she willingly wore ear-rings formed\r\nof fleurs-de-lis, and, the changes of the negotiation having for a\r\nmoment fixed the choice of the two Governments on her sister Doña\r\nMaria,[48] Anne, then nine years old, declared, “that if it was to be\r\nthus, she was resolved to pass her life in a monastery without ever\r\nmarrying.”[49] When, three years afterwards, the Duke de Mayenne, on\r\nquitting Madrid, whither he had come to sign the marriage contract of\r\nAnne and Louis XIII., asked the former what she wished him to say on\r\nher behalf to the King of France, she replied: “That I am extremely\r\nimpatient to see him.” This answer having shocked the austere Countess\r\nd’Altamira, her governess, who exclaimed--“What! madam, what will the\r\nKing of France think when M. de Mayenne tells him that you have made\r\nsuch a speech?”--the Infanta rejoined, “Madam, you have taught me that\r\none should always be sincere; you should not be surprised then if I\r\nspeak the truth.”[50]\r\n\r\nThe two years which elapsed before her departure saw no change in these\r\nsentiments. The 9th November, 1615, she parted at Fontarabia from her\r\nfather, Philip III., with less sorrow than he showed in allowing her\r\nat length to leave, and it was with pride and contentment that the new\r\nQueen, radiant with youth and beauty,[51] crossed the Bidassoa, on her\r\nway to Bordeaux, where the French court was stopping. What kind of\r\nhusband was she about to meet there?\r\n\r\nVery different from those of the Princess Anne were the impressions\r\nof Louis XIII., concerning the marriage and the family to which he\r\nwas going to unite himself. People had frequently, and at an early\r\nage, conversed with him about the project. The first replies of\r\nthe Dauphin, questioned from his most tender infancy, would have\r\nno significance.[52] But as he advanced in age, his aversion to\r\neverything Spanish manifested itself with characteristic energy. Twice\r\nhe replied in the negative to Henri IV., when the latter spoke to him\r\nof the Infanta as his future wife.[53] One day, on M. de Ventelet\r\nasking him if he liked the Spaniards, he answered, “No.” “And why,\r\nsir?” “Because they are papa’s enemies.” “And the Infanta?” added De\r\nVentelet, “do you love her, sir?” “No.” “Why, sir?” “I don’t want any\r\nSpanish love.”[54] Later, when his chaplain was making him recite\r\nthe Commandments, on coming to “Thou shalt not kill,” the Dauphin\r\nexclaimed: “What, not the Spaniards? Oh, yes, I shall kill the\r\nSpaniards, because they are papa’s enemies! I will beat them well!” And\r\non his chaplain observing that they were Christians, he replied: “May I\r\nonly kill Turks then?”[55]\r\n\r\nTo this aversion, a great deal more significant since it was contrary\r\nto a project generally acquiesced in by those about him, soon came to\r\nbe added a certain distaste for marriage. Born with the ardent and\r\nlascivious temperament of his father, impelled to follow his example\r\nby conversations often loose, sometimes obscene, Louis XIII. succeeded\r\nin modifying these early tendencies by a force of will and a power of\r\nreflection truly rare. He was naturally an observer, he spoke little\r\nand laughed still less. He was usually serious and grave at times when\r\nhis pages found cause for great merriment. All that he remarked became\r\nprofoundly engraved on his mind, and enabled him years afterwards to\r\nreply with marvellous pertinency to questions which were sometimes\r\nembarrassing. His young imagination was early struck by the singular\r\neffects which the King’s conduct produced at the court. In his cradle\r\nhe received frequent visits, not only from his mother, but also from\r\nHenri IV.’s repudiated wife,[56] and from his numerous mistresses. They\r\nall sometimes found themselves assembled around him, the latter proud\r\nof their master’s affection, Marie de Medicis irritated, jealous, and\r\nshowing it. The issue of these very open intrigues, were the Dauphin’s\r\ncompanions; but he instinctively abhorred them. He struck them without\r\nmotive; would not have them at his table; absolutely refused to call\r\nthem brothers; and when Henri IV., after having beaten him without\r\novercoming this insurmountable repugnance, asked him the reason of it,\r\nhe answered, “Because they are not mamma’s sons.”[57]\r\n\r\nThis hatred for everything connected with illegitimacy was certainly\r\nthe origin of the chaste reserve which was to characterize so\r\nparticularly him who was the son of Henri IV. and the father of Louis\r\nXIV. From his illegitimate brothers, this aversion extended to their\r\nmothers, whom he qualified in very contemptuous terms, and to the\r\nintrigues in which they were engaged. “Shall you be as ribald as\r\nthe King?” said his nurse to him one day. “No,” he answered, after\r\na moment’s reflection. And on her asking him if he was in love, he\r\nreplied, “No, I avoid love.”[58]\r\n\r\nIt was especially after Henri IV.’s death that the tendencies of the\r\nyoung king revealed themselves. He loved his father tenderly, a great\r\ndeal more than Marie de Medicis did, who, moreover, never showed much\r\naffection for her elder son. He worthily wept his violent death,[59]\r\nand long afterwards, hearing at the Louvre, one of the late King’s\r\nsongs, he went aside to sob.[60] But if, while yet a child, he had\r\nappreciated the glory of Henri IV., if he had shared his patriotic\r\nsentiments, if he was proud of his victories, he had silently blamed\r\nthe licence which, in acts, and still more in language, then rendered\r\nthe French Court one of the most gross in Europe. As King, he would\r\nnot tolerate these excesses. He showed himself openly austere in his\r\nspeech, and modest in his actions, forbade in his presence obscene\r\nsongs and scandalous conversations, and in order to avoid any pretext\r\nfor them, replied sharply to M. de Souvré, his governor, when he wished\r\nto talk with him about marriage: “Do not let us speak of that, sir; do\r\nnot let us speak of that.”\r\n\r\nIt was nevertheless necessary to speak of it, and to set out for\r\nBordeaux. Louis XIII., then in his fifteenth year, still possessed,\r\nand was to preserve for a long time, the tastes and predilections of\r\nhis infancy. He gave himself up to them in order to divert his mind\r\nfrom the marriage festivities. He kept birds, armed his gentlemen, and\r\nenrolled them in a vigilant and disciplined troop; then he assisted\r\nat the Council, replied pertinently to the deputations presented to\r\nhim, and thus mingled the simple amusements of the child with the\r\ngrave accomplishment of his business as King.[61] Much less desirous\r\nof fulfilling his duties as husband, he nevertheless affected towards\r\nthe Infanta, either from self-esteem, or from a sense of propriety\r\ntowards the strangers who were bringing her to him, an attention\r\nwhich surprised and charmed the court. He went to meet the train\r\nwhich accompanied her, showed himself curious and pleased to see her,\r\nand was timid, but attentive and courteous, in the first interviews\r\nwhich he had with her.[62] This was all; and, if for an instant,\r\nhe possessed the manners of a gallant and attentive cavalier, he\r\nby no means exhibited the behaviour of a lover. During the evening\r\nafter the celebration of the ceremony, he remained insensible to the\r\nencouragements of M. de Grammont,[63] and Marie de Medicis had to exert\r\nher authority in order to induce him to go to Anne of Austria. Four\r\nyears afterwards the marriage was not yet consummated; and this event,\r\nardently desired by the Court of France, disconsolate at the King’s\r\ncoldness; by the Court of Spain, which saw an insult in this disdain;\r\nby the Pope’s nuncio, and by the Court of Tuscany, which had so much\r\ncontributed towards the union, became in some degree an affair of State.\r\n\r\nMany efforts, many attempts were necessary to induce Louis XIII. to\r\nchange his course of behaviour, of which the remote cause may be\r\nascribed to his early impressions as Dauphin, and of which a more\r\nimmediate one has been discovered by the Nuncio Bentivoglio.[64]\r\nSometimes the King’s pride was attempted to be touched, and the politic\r\nNuncio, availing himself of the marriage of the Princess Christine with\r\nthe Duke of Savoy, asked Louis XIII., “If he wished to have the shame\r\nof seeing his sister have a son before he had a Dauphin.”[65] Sometimes\r\nrecourse was had to influences still more direct.[66] At length,\r\nJanuary 25, 1619, Albert de Luynes, after vainly begging him to cede\r\nto the wishes of his subjects, carried him by force into the Queen’s\r\nchamber.[67] The following day, all the ambassadors announced this\r\nevent to their respective governments.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, Louis XIII. was less scared, but almost as timid[68]\r\nas ever, and though, preserving all his repugnances, he sometimes\r\novercame them as a matter of duty, and showed himself a tolerably\r\nardent, but never very tender husband. In the month of December, 1619,\r\nthere were reasons for hoping that the Queen was pregnant.[69] This\r\nhope, which soon vanished, was renewed at the commencement of 1622, but\r\nwas again destroyed by a fall, which Anne of Austria had while playing\r\nwith the Duchess de Chevreuse.[70] Buckingham’s rapid visit to France,\r\nif it left a profound remembrance in the Queen’s heart, certainly\r\nhad no influence upon the King’s conduct. Nothing was changed in the\r\nintercourse of the two spouses, which was neither more frequent, nor\r\never entirely interrupted.[71] After, as before this visit, Louis XIII.\r\nalmost invariably saw in the Queen the Spaniard in blood and affection;\r\nand when in May, 1621, he had to announce to her the death of her\r\nfather, he did it in this wise: “Madam,” said he, “I have just now\r\nreceived letters from Spain, in which they write me word for certain,\r\nthat the King your father is dead.” Then, mounting his horse, he set\r\nout for the chase.[72] It is undoubtedly true, moreover, that Anne of\r\nAustria, who was, to her eternal glory, to become thoroughly French on\r\nassuming the Regency, and perceiving the true interests of her young\r\nson, to serve them with patriotism, intelligence, and firmness, even\r\nin opposition to her old friends, was, during the life-time of Louis\r\nXIII., the natural centre of a secret but constant and implacable\r\nopposition to the system which Richelieu supported. Good, but proud,\r\nshe had been galled by her husband’s indifference, humiliated by\r\nRichelieu’s chicanery and mistrust, and irritated at not possessing\r\nany influence, so that, in the midst of the war which divided Spain\r\nand France, she had not wished to dissimulate the attachment which\r\nshe preserved for her own family and for her country. Badly advised\r\nby the frivolous and restless Duchess de Chevreuse, she had engaged\r\nin different enterprises by which, without betraying France, she had\r\nfurnished her enemies with arms sufficiently powerful for them to be\r\nable to maintain her in disgrace with Louis XIII.\r\n\r\nThis Prince, who during his whole life longed for the moment when he\r\nshould quit his state of tutelage,[73] and who, from being under the\r\ncontrol of his governor, was to pass under his mother’s, then under\r\nAlbert de Luynes’, and lastly, under Richelieu’s, joined to rather\r\na fierce pride a true and just sense and exact knowledge of his\r\ninferiority. He detested the yoke, but he felt that it was necessary.\r\nDestined by his own incapacity to be for ever accomplishing the designs\r\nof others, he submitted to constraint, although constantly disposed\r\nto revolt. But he loved neither his mother, whom he discarded, nor De\r\nLuynes, whose death he did not regret. Richelieu alone, not only by the\r\nvast superiority of his genius, but especially by the obsequiousness of\r\nhis language, by incessant precautions, by continually new artifices of\r\nhumility, succeeded in seducing that unquiet and distrustful spirit,\r\nover which flattery had no power.[74] He ended by even attaching the\r\nKing to himself, whatever may have been said about it, and by inspiring\r\nin him an affection which was bestowed quite as much upon the man\r\nas upon the indispensable Minister. Louis XIII. had the greatest\r\nsolicitude for Richelieu, and paid him the most delicate attentions;\r\nand it can be affirmed, after a perusal of his letters, as yet\r\nunpublished, that these marks of lively friendship were not merely the\r\nresult of self-interest.[75] Moreover, even when he was in possession\r\nof supreme authority, Richelieu, ever on the alert, showed himself\r\nto the last as studious in preserving it as he had been ingenious\r\nand supple in acquiring it. His efforts were constantly exerted to\r\nneutralize the influence of a Spanish Queen over a King whom he wished\r\nto maintain in the glorious policy of Henri IV. But he did not content\r\nhimself with depriving the legitimate wife of his King of the whole of\r\nher power, which was a matter of no difficulty. Although incapable of\r\ncriminal desires, since he could abstain from lawful pleasures, Louis\r\nXIII., sickly and morose as he was, reaping from love only jealousy\r\nand trouble, devoured by inquietudes and cares, had need of pouring\r\nout his complaints, of exposing his griefs, of unbosoming himself to a\r\nfriendly heart, away from the pomp and noise which he fled. Richelieu\r\nalways directed this inclination; and if he subjugated the King’s mind\r\nby the force of his own genius, if he fascinated him by the seductive\r\npower of his words, he watched over all his actions by means of spies,\r\nwith whom he surrounded him, and governed even his soul through his\r\nconfessors.[76] When the Prince’s affections, “purely spiritual, and\r\nenjoyments always chaste,” as says a contemporary, were bestowed on\r\ninstruments, indocile to the directions of the ruling Minister, the\r\nlatter knew how to conjure up scruples in the King’s mind, even for\r\nthese pure connections, and which triumphed over his inclinations. To\r\nMadame de Hautefort succeeded, in the royal affections, Mademoiselle\r\nde la Fayette, to her Cinq-Mars, and these three individuals, whose\r\nrelations with the King always continued perfectly irreproachable,\r\nbut who rebelled against Richelieu’s imperious will, expiated their\r\nresistance--one in exile, another in a convent, and the third on the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nIf, then, it was true that Anne of Austria had, in 1630, committed\r\nadultery in order to give an heir to her dying husband, how are we\r\nto admit that a Minister so suspicious and vigilant would not have\r\nbeen cognisant of it, and knowing it, would not, by informing the\r\nconvalescent King of this crime, have brought about the ruin of a\r\nQueen whom he detested, and who, in union with Marie de Medicis, was\r\nthen plotting his downfall? It is in vain to object that a feeling of\r\npropriety would have restrained the Cardinal:[77] he was incapable\r\nof any such sentiment. Inflexible towards his enemies, because he\r\nregarded them, with reason, as the enemies of the State, to unmask and\r\nruin them he employed a stubbornness and a persistence which nothing\r\ncould overcome. When it was necessary to persuade Louis XIII. of the\r\ncommunication which the Queen kept up with Spain, the implacable\r\nMinister could make the most minute search and put the most humiliating\r\nquestions. He could cause her dearest servants to be arrested; he could\r\nconfront her with spies; he could treat her as an obscure criminal; and\r\nthe admirable devotion of Madame de Hautefort[78] could alone enable\r\nthe Queen, very strongly suspected, but not entirely convicted, to\r\nescape from this grave danger. And yet people desire to maintain that\r\nRichelieu would have left Louis XIII. ignorant of a much greater crime,\r\nand one which touched more immediately the King’s honour! Moreover,\r\nwhere, when, how, and in what interest would this crime have been\r\ncommitted? To conjectures and vague insinuations let us oppose positive\r\nfacts, which prove that Richelieu did not acquaint Louis XIII., because\r\nAnne of Austria had never ceased to be innocent.\r\n\r\nThe King fell ill at Lyons, not during the early part of August, as\r\nhas been said, but on September 22, and here especially dates are of\r\nthe utmost importance.[79] He was seized with a fever, which consumed\r\nhim. The seventh day--the 29th--it was complicated by a dysentery,\r\nwhich exhausted him. The attack of this last complaint, produced by\r\none of those medicines then much in vogue, was so violent, and its\r\nconsequences so rapid, that by midnight the doctors despaired of\r\nsaving him. Marie de Medicis had retired. Anne of Austria, who did not\r\nleave the royal patient, resolved to have him warned by his confessor\r\nof the danger he was in. But, at the first cautiously spoken words,\r\nLouis XIII. conjured Father Suffren, and those who surrounded him, not\r\nto hide the truth from him. He learned it with calmness and courage,\r\nconfessed, communicated, and asked pardon of all for any wrong he might\r\nhave done them; then, calling the Queen, he embraced her tenderly, and\r\naddressed to her a touching farewell. As she retired on one side in\r\norder to weep freely, the King prayed Father Suffren to go and find\r\nher, and again beg her from him “to pardon him all the unpleasantnesses\r\nhe might have caused her the whole time of their married life.” He\r\nafterwards conversed with Richelieu, and offered a spectacle of\r\nthe most edifying resignation. Towards the middle of the day, the\r\nArchbishop of Lyons was preparing himself to bring in the extreme\r\nunction, when the doctors, who had already bled this exhausted body\r\nsix times in succession, ordered a seventh bleeding.[80] But then the\r\ntrue cause of the illness, which was unknown to them, was made clear;\r\nan internal abscess broke, and nature saved the patient at the moment\r\nwhen the intervention of his physicians promised to be fatal.[81] Louis\r\nXIII., soon re-established in health, left Lyons with the Queen, who\r\ndid not cease to lavish on him the most tender cares, and whose sincere\r\ngrief had touched him. In this crisis the two spouses had forgotten\r\nthe past.[82] The repugnance and the coldness of the one, the wounded\r\npride of the other, had disappeared, and they were naturally led to\r\nappreciate whatever goodness and amiability were to be found in each\r\nother’s natures.[83]\r\n\r\nStrong in the unaccustomed sway which she exercised, but exaggerating\r\nits extent, Anne of Austria was not content with holding in the King’s\r\nheart the place which properly belonged to her. Aided by the ambitious\r\nand vindictive Marie de Medicis, after having occupied herself with\r\nher griefs as a wife, she desired to extend her censure to affairs of\r\nState, and to attack, in Richelieu, not only one who had kept alive\r\nthe mistrust of herself, who had called suspicion into existence, and\r\nhad separated King and Queen, mother and son, but also the stubborn\r\npursuer of the great policy of Henri IV., who maintained abroad the\r\npre-eminence of France over Spain, and the abasement of the House of\r\nAustria. We know how Louis XIII., who was incapable of vast projects,\r\nbut who understood their value, was recalled by reasons of State to\r\nRichelieu, and, on a famous day, confirmed his authority at the very\r\ninstant that it seemed annihilated.[84]\r\n\r\nTo what period are we to assign the commission of the fault resulting\r\nin Anne’s pregnancy of January, 1631? It cannot have been on September\r\n30, 1630, when Louis XIII.’s life was in danger, for the Queen was\r\ndelivered during the first five days of April, 1631.[85] Was it on the\r\narrival of Louis XIII. at Lyons, at the commencement of August, 1630?\r\nBut Anne of Austria did not then have the same interest in being a\r\nmother, which, according to her accusers, she would have on September\r\n30, when the King was dying. Either the child was still-born, or else\r\nits conception dates from a period when Louis XIII. was its father. The\r\norigin of this pregnancy is suspected because Richelieu, in a journal\r\nattributed to him, and of which it has been said “that it lent to\r\nVoltaire’s supposition rather a serious ground of argument,”[86] was\r\npleased to note the progress of the Queen’s condition, often sent to\r\ninquire after her health, carried off her apothecary, then returned\r\nhim to her, forbade the Spanish ambassador to make too frequent visits\r\nto the Louvre, and, in a word, exercised over Anne of Austria a\r\nsuspicious and unceasing vigilance. But if we admit the authenticity\r\nof this journal, which, probable enough in certain details, is much\r\nless so when taken as a whole, all the facts which it relates, the\r\nespionage which it chronicles, the suspicions which it insinuates,\r\nconcern the Spaniard, irritated at Richelieu’s unexpected triumph and\r\ndreaming of overthrowing him, not the guilty spouse whose crime it is\r\ndesired to prove. Accepting this last theory, why should Richelieu have\r\nrestored to the Queen the medical attendant who could have aided her\r\nin concealing the consequences of her fault? Why was she not entirely\r\nseparated from all her confidants? Why were not the visits of the\r\nSpanish ambassador altogether forbidden? Richelieu, it is true, caused\r\nthe Countess de Fargis to be dismissed. But it was only because she\r\nhad advised the Queen to espouse her brother-in-law, Gaston d’Orléans,\r\nif she became a widow, because she had inflamed Anne of Austria’s\r\nresentment, and because she was the soul of the opposition, of the\r\npolitical intrigues, and of the secret plots against the Cardinal.\r\nIf everything in her long correspondence seized by the latter, and\r\nexisting in the archives,[87] justifies him for having exiled the\r\ndangerous Countess, if we find in it traces of the hopes of the two\r\nQueens, of the affections which bind them to Spain, of the successes\r\nthey desire, of the reverses they hope for, nothing can be discovered\r\nthat sullies Anne of Austria’s honour. The Countess de Fargis appears\r\nin it as the active instigator of cabals, but not as the complacent\r\naccomplice and the confidant of a crime.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that _enceinte_ for the third time, and fearing a third\r\naccident, Anne of Austria did not wish the news of her condition to be\r\nspread abroad, or to arouse in the minds of the people a hope which\r\nthe remembrance of the past rendered very uncertain of fulfilment.\r\nThat this pregnancy was due to the reconciliation arising from the\r\nKing’s illness, Richelieu himself attests, not as the doubtful author\r\nof a journal which, however, does not contain a single line really\r\naccusing the Queen, but as the indisputable writer of those innumerable\r\nletters, papers, and authentic documents, which have passed from the\r\nhands of the Duchess d’Aiguillon, his niece, into the archives of\r\nthe State.[88] “It is suspected, not without good reason, that the\r\nQueen is _enceinte_,” he writes. “If this happiness befalls France,\r\nit ought to receive it as a fruit of the blessing of God and of the\r\ngood understanding which has existed between the King and the Queen,\r\nhis wife, for some time past.”[89] The same care which Anne of Austria\r\ntook to conceal a third miscarriage, she had already shown with\r\nregard to a second, which occurred March 16, 1622, and at that time\r\n“they had hidden from the King as long as possible the destruction\r\nof his hopes.”[90] But from the first day that Richelieu entered\r\nupon power, nothing escaped the penetrating regard of the attentive\r\nMinister. He watched, he observed, he knew everything. Every member\r\nof the royal family was surrounded by some of his agents. If from\r\nthis incessant surveillance, and from the written evidence in which\r\nit stands revealed, springs the proof that the Queen had coquetted\r\nwith Buckingham, been swayed by the counsels of the Duchess de\r\nChevreuse,[91] and faithful to the last recommendations of her father,\r\nPhilip III., had been always ready to support the Spanish interest near\r\nthe King; if, in a word, Richelieu represents her as a Queen but little\r\nFrench, he never insinuates that she has been a guilty spouse; and\r\nhistory can scarcely hope to be better informed, and certainly ought\r\nnot to show itself more rigorous than the clear-sighted and pitiless\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] _Les Mariages espagnols sous le règne d’Henri IV. et la Régence de\r\nMarie de Medicis_, by M.

According to the _Rélation de Don Fernando Giron_\r\n(Archives of Simancas), Louis XIII. held aloof from Anne of Austria\r\n“because he had been persuaded that if he had a son, while yet so\r\nyoung, it would cause a civil war in the kingdom.” Nothing, however,\r\nconfirms this supposition, or renders it likely.\r\n\r\n[69] Despatch of the Nuncio Bentivoglio, December 4, 1619.\r\n\r\n[70] _Mémoires de Bassompierre_, confirmed by the _Journal d’Héroard_,\r\nMarch 26, 1622.\r\n\r\n[71] _Journal d’Héroard_, _passim_, and especially June 8, and August\r\n21, 1626.\r\n\r\n[72] _Ibid._, May 10, 1621.\r\n\r\n[73] “He was playing with some little balls, rolling them along his\r\ntaper stand, and calling them soldiers.

At the moment when every one believed\r\nthe downfall of the once all-powerful Minister to be complete, the\r\nlatter succeeded in recovering his lost influence over the King, of\r\nwhich he had been deprived through the intrigues of Marie de Medicis,\r\nwho had demanded of her son whether he was “so unnatural as to prefer a\r\nvalet to his mother.” Richelieu, when firmly reinstated in power, did\r\nnot spare the queen-mother’s partisans, upon several of whom he avenged\r\nhimself with his accustomed severity.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[85] This date is given in Richelieu’s Journal, of which we are about\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n[86] M.

In 1617, she espoused Albert de Luynes, favourite of Louis\r\nXIII., who on the occasion of the marriage created his confidant a duke\r\nand appointed his wife Superintendent of the Queen’s Household. Shortly\r\nafter the death of her husband, in 1621, from fever caught at the siege\r\nof Montauban, she married Claude de Lorraine, Duke de Chevreuse, the\r\nson of that Duke de Guise whom Henry III. caused to be assassinated at\r\nBlois. The Duchess de Chevreuse was a charming and beautiful woman,\r\ngifted with extraordinary powers of intellect and proud of her high\r\nlineage, but incorrigibly given to intrigue.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n Third Hypothesis--Reconciliation of Louis XIII. and Anne of\r\n Austria--The Queen _enceinte_ for the Fourth Time--Suspicions with\r\n which Royal Births have sometimes been received--Precautions adopted\r\n in France for the Purpose of avoiding these Suspicions--Story of\r\n Louis XIV.’s Birth--Impossibility of admitting the Birth of a\r\n Twin-brother--Richelieu’s Absence--Uselessness of abducting and\r\n concealing this pretended Twin-brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven years were to elapse before the realization of the wishes of\r\nthe nation, which ardently desired a Dauphin, and was alarmed at the\r\nprospect of seeing the little-loved brother of Louis XIII. ascend the\r\nthrone of France. Anne of Austria was _enceinte_ anew, in January,\r\n1638: not, as Voltaire has said, and as people have so frequently\r\nrepeated after him, “in consequence of a reconciliation brought\r\nabout by chance between the two spouses, who had lived separately\r\nfor a long time.”[92] There was no longer any need either of a storm\r\nsurprising Louis XIII., ready to set out for the chase, or the pressing\r\nentreaties of Mademoiselle de la Fayette, or the supplications of\r\nthe Captain of his Guards, in order to induce the King to visit the\r\nQueen. Unquestionable documents[93] show that long before the month\r\nof December, 1637, Louis XIII. knew how to reconcile his duties as\r\na husband with his ever-increasing passion for the chase, and that\r\nwhen this sport kept him away from the Louvre for too long a time,\r\nhis habit was to send for the Queen. On September 5, 1638, the latter\r\nbrought into the world a prince, who was afterwards Louis XIV. It is\r\nupon this day that the birth of the Man with the Iron Mask is fixed\r\nby those[94] who recognise in this personage not an adulterine son of\r\nAnne of Austria, but a legitimate twin-brother of Louis XIV., born some\r\nhours after him, and condemned, for his late arrival in the world, to a\r\nperpetual imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThere are few royal births that have not been the object of malevolent\r\ninsinuations, and often of very plain accusations of criminal fraud.\r\nSuch an event almost always destroys the right of some collateral heir,\r\nwho has perhaps long coveted the crown. Sometimes even it ruins the\r\nprojects of a whole party; and whilst it confirms the position of some,\r\nit suddenly throws down a hundred ambitions, and exposes those who are\r\ndisappointed in their expectations to the temptation of gainsaying\r\nthat which destroys their hopes. When, on June 21, 1688, Marie d’Este,\r\nsecond wife of James II., rendered him the father of a son,[95] William\r\nof Orange, then long married to the Princess Mary, the eldest daughter\r\nof the King of England, seeing his wife’s rights annihilated by this\r\nunexpected birth, refused to admit as real an event so fatal to him.\r\nHe caused accusatory libels to be spread throughout Holland, and even\r\nin England,[96] in which it was represented that the Queen’s pregnancy\r\nwas feigned, that the birth was imaginary, and that an unknown child,\r\npicked up at hazard, had been furtively introduced into the bed of its\r\npretended mother.[97] Several English writers, and, at their head, the\r\nardent Burnet, welcomed this opinion, and the scandal which they raised\r\ncontributed, some months afterwards, to the success of the attempt made\r\nby William of Orange to seize on the throne at the very moment when he\r\nseemed to have been excluded from it for ever.\r\n\r\nIn France, doubts of this nature being rendered still more easy by\r\nthe sceptical and fault-finding spirit of the nation, care has been\r\ntaken at all times to avoid even a pretext for them, by infinite\r\nprecautions and excellent customs. Not only had the birth of a prince\r\nthe greatest personages of the State for obligatory witnesses, but the\r\npeople themselves were also invited to be present at the advent to\r\nlife of him whom a very old tradition happily designates as the Child\r\nof France. The doors were opened to the public, who penetrated freely\r\ninto the royal dwelling at the solemn moment when the family of their\r\nrulers was perpetuated. They also entered there on certain occasions\r\nwhen the King allowed himself to be seen at table by his subjects.\r\nThese two privileges were the only ones granted to them at that time,\r\nand, reasonably enough, they were not disposed to rest content with\r\nthem for ever. The first, however, at least, offered the advantage\r\nof making them forget for an instant that they were nothing, and of\r\nassociating them in some way with the greatest event connected with the\r\nreigning family. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her first child,\r\nthe concourse of people in her chamber was such that Louis XVI. broke a\r\nwindow to give air more quickly to the Queen, who was on the point of\r\nlosing consciousness. From that day the people ceased to be admitted\r\nto the birth of the King’s children. But long before Louis XIV. came\r\ninto the world, nothing was neglected that could give the greatest\r\nauthenticity to this event, and the accurate Héroard[98] shows us the\r\nchamber of Marie de Medicis filled with spectators at the moment of the\r\nbirth of Louis XIII.\r\n\r\nIt was the same at the birth of Louis XIV. The first signs of an\r\napproaching accouchement showed themselves on September 4, 1638, at\r\neleven o’clock in the evening.[99] The next day, at five o’clock in\r\nthe morning, Louis XIII., learning that the pains are increasing,\r\nvisits the Queen, whom he does not quit till her delivery.[100] At\r\nsix o’clock arrive successively at Saint-Germain, Gaston d’Orléans,\r\nso interested in watching the issue of an event which is, perhaps,\r\nto put him aside from the throne for ever; the Princess de Condé,\r\nMadame de Vendôme, the Chancellor, Madame de Lansac, the future\r\ngoverness of the royal child, and Mesdames de Senecey and de la\r\nFlotte, ladies of honour. Behind the canopy of the bed occupied by\r\nthe Queen, is erected an altar, at which the Bishops of Lisieux, of\r\nMeaux, and of Beauvais, say mass in turns. Near the altar, and even\r\nin the adjoining room, press Mesdames de la Ville-aux-Clercs, de\r\nLiancourt, and de Mortemart; the Princess de Guéméné; the Duchesses\r\nde la Trémouille and de Bouillon; the Dukes de Vendôme, de Chevreuse,\r\nand de Montbazon; Messieurs de Souvré, de Liancourt, de Mortemart,\r\nde la Ville-aux-Clercs, de Brion, and de Chavigny: the Archbishop\r\nof Bourges; the Bishops of Metz, Châlons, Dardanie, and Mans; and,\r\nfinally, an enormous crowd which invades the palace at an early hour,\r\nand soon completely fills it.[101] At eleven o’clock precisely Anne of\r\nAustria brings into the world a child, the sex of which the midwife\r\nat once causes to be verified by the princes of the royal family, and\r\nparticularly by Gaston d’Orléans. This latter remains quite stunned at\r\nthe sight, and cannot hide his vexation;[102] still the very visible\r\nsigns of his discontent are almost unperceived in the general gladness,\r\nand amidst the noisy acclamations that arise on all sides. The joy of\r\nLouis XIII. is as lively as his melancholy and dreamy nature allows. He\r\nadmires and makes those round him admire the shape of his son, who,\r\nfrom his birth, like his father at a similar moment, gives proofs of\r\nthe extraordinary appetite[103] which characterizes his race. A short\r\ntime after, in the very chamber of the Queen, and before the same\r\nspectators, the newly-born prince is baptized by the Bishop of Meaux,\r\nfirst almoner. Louis XIII. then sends the Sieur Duperré-Bailleul to\r\nParis, charged with solemnly announcing the happy news[104] to the\r\nCorporation. But, borne by the joyous cry of the populace, the news has\r\nalready traversed with surprising rapidity the distance which separates\r\nSaint-Germain from Paris, where it is known at noon. It excites a\r\nreally sincere enthusiasm there, and the churches, for some months past\r\nfilled by people who ask of heaven the birth of a Dauphin, at once\r\nresound with hymns of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nAccording to the romance of Soulavie a second son came into the\r\nworld at eight o’clock in the evening, nine hours after the first,\r\nand, conformably to the advice of Richelieu, was hidden, brought up\r\nmysteriously, and then placed in confinement. Let us remark, in the\r\nfirst place, that the Cardinal de Richelieu, who is made to play\r\nsuch an important part at Saint-Germain on September 5, 1638, had\r\nbeen absent from that place since the end of July, and was then at\r\nSaint-Quentin, whence he only returned to Paris on October 2.[105] But\r\ndo not let us stop at this first error. In cases of twins the presence\r\nof the second child is invariably denoted by signs impossible to be\r\nmistaken or passed over. Thus, even if the second birth did not at once\r\nfollow the first, in which case it would have had for witnesses the\r\nwhole of the persons assembled in the chamber, it would certainly have\r\nbeen anticipated, and an expectation such as this could not have been\r\nkept concealed from the crowd.[106]\r\n\r\nBut how can it be admitted that a fact of such importance was known\r\nto so many persons without any of them betraying the secret in a\r\nconversation which would have been eagerly seized upon by some\r\ncontemporary writer, or in one of those memoirs which numerous great\r\npersonages then delighted in leaving behind them? And yet they all\r\npreserve the most complete silence on this subject. Contemporaries\r\nhave told us everything about the veritable actions as well as the\r\nimaginary acts of Anne of Austria. They have penetrated to the recesses\r\nof her private life, but nothing in their writings, not even the most\r\nindirect allusion, permits one to suspect such an important event.\r\n\r\nSupposing, however, that, extraordinarily and contrariwise to what\r\nobservation proves every day, this second birth took place nine hours\r\nafter the first, and without having been previously announced by any\r\nrevealing sign, and that the witnesses were very few in number and\r\nremarkably discreet, what interest had Louis XIII. in concealing this\r\nbirth? Amongst the Romans, in France during the Middle Ages, as in\r\nmodern times, the twin that first comes into the world has always\r\nbeen the eldest. Far, therefore, from being dismayed, as Soulavie\r\nrelates,[107] at this second birth, Louis XIII. ought to have rejoiced\r\nat it, since it would have strengthened the direct line in his family.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to disprove that a double birth may have been\r\nprophesied by the two shepherds. Popular imagination, lively excited by\r\nthe universal desire for a Dauphin, and by the unexpected announcement\r\nof the Queen’s condition, welcomed a thousand superstitious\r\npredictions, that for some months served as food for conversation,\r\nand helped to soften the delay. But this is the sole incident which\r\nis not evidently false in the relation of Soulavie, which is refuted,\r\nfor the rest, by the impossibility of hiding a second birth from\r\nthe innumerable witnesses of the first, and by the absolute silence\r\nof contemporaries, as well as by the incontestable inutility of the\r\nremoval and suppression of this younger brother of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] Voltaire, _Dictionnaire Philosophique_, vol. i. p. 375.\r\n\r\n[93] Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section France, 5.\r\nThere exists, amongst others, a letter of January 10, 1637, in which\r\nLouis XIII. writes to Richelieu “that he will have the Queen come to\r\nSaint-Germain, the evenings there being very long without company.”\r\n\r\n[94] Dulaure, _Histoire de Paris_; Simonde Sismondi, _Histoire des\r\nFrançais_; Dufey de l’Yonne, _Histoire de la Bastille_; The Chevalier\r\nde Cubières, _Voyage à la Bastille_.\r\n\r\n[95] The Old Pretender.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[96] M.

Let us cease\r\nfor an instant to take into account proofs brought forward and\r\nconsiderations advanced, and consent to admit each of the assertions\r\npreviously combated. This mysterious son of Anne of Austria came into\r\nthe world either in 1629, having Buckingham for father; or, in 1631, on\r\naccount of the danger that the life of Louis XIII. was in; or else in\r\n1638, some hours after the birth of a brother. He exists. Received by\r\nan agent as devoted as discreet, he has been brought up in the country,\r\nthe resemblance which reveals his high origin has been successfully\r\nhidden from every one, and his person placed in security from all\r\ninvestigations. But at what period was he imprisoned, and for what\r\ncause? Of his youth, of his early years, passed in the obscurity of a\r\nretreat far from the court, there are no traces, and there is no reason\r\nfor surprise at this. But as soon as he becomes the famous prisoner\r\nwhom Saint-Mars brought in 1698 from the Isles Sainte-Marguerite to the\r\nBastille, we have the right to ask, and we must seek when, how, and\r\nunder what circumstances he was arrested and confided to his gaoler.\r\n\r\nIt would be to a certain extent probable that, left at liberty as long\r\nas his mother was alive, he was imprisoned only after her death. But\r\nAnne of Austria dies on January 20, 1666, and Saint-Mars receives no\r\nprisoner. Does the arrest date, as Voltaire affirms, from the year\r\n1661, when Mazarin died? But Saint-Mars was then, and was to remain\r\nfor three years, a brigadier of musketeers; and it is in December,\r\n1664, that D’Artagnan, his captain, points him out to the choice of\r\nLouis XIV. as governor of the prison of Pignerol, whither, a month\r\nafterwards, Fouquet is taken and confided to his vigilant guardianship.\r\nOn August 20, 1669, a second prisoner, Eustache d’Auger, arrives; but\r\nhe is only an obscure spy, and is soon placed with Fouquet to serve him\r\nas a domestic. Would one have charged with this care,--would one have\r\nplaced in the service of Fouquet, who, during the whole of his life\r\nhad lived near Louis XIV. and Anne of Austria, a prince whose features\r\nrecalled those of the King? No other prisoner is brought to Saint-Mars\r\nuntil the arrival of the Count de Lauzun in 1671. Since then, and from\r\ntime to time, others are confided to him, but we know their crimes or\r\ntheir offences, are not ignorant of the causes of their arrest, and see\r\nthem rather badly treated; and when, in 1681, Saint-Mars passes from\r\nthe governorship of Pignerol to that of the fortress of Exiles, he only\r\ntakes with him two prisoners, of whom he speaks contemptuously as “two\r\ncrows.”[108] At Exiles as at Pignerol--at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nof which Saint-Mars was in 1687 appointed governor, as at Exiles--if\r\nfresh culprits are confided to him, we know to what motive to attribute\r\ntheir detention, and nothing in their past, nothing in the treatment\r\nof which they are the object, nothing in their actions, allows us to\r\nsuspect in any one of them a brother of Louis XIV. Certainly, one\r\nwould hardly expect to find a despatch designating one of Saint-Mars’\r\nprisoners by the title of prince, and in order to be convinced we\r\ndo not exact anything of the kind. But when, examining, one by one,\r\neach of the captives sent to the future governor of the Bastille, and\r\namongst whom is necessarily the one that he traversed France with in\r\n1698, we account for the causes of their arrest, and penetrate into\r\ntheir past; when a hundred authentic despatches[109] enable us to\r\naffirm that there are no other prisoners besides these, are we not\r\njustified in demanding where, then, is the son of Anne of Austria?\r\n\r\nThis famous despatch, a fragment of which was timidly quoted some\r\nyears ago in a work from which it has since been omitted,[110]--this\r\ndespatch, in the existence of which criticism had concluded to\r\ndisbelieve,[111] and which is of capital importance, actually does\r\nexist and is authentic. It was dictated by Barbézieux,[112] and\r\naddressed to Saint-Mars, at the moment when the latter had under his\r\nguardianship the prisoner whom he was to take with him to the Bastille,\r\nand who died there in 1703:--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur--I have received, with your letter of the 10th of this\r\nmonth, the copy of that which Monsieur de Pontchartrain has written to\r\nyou concerning the prisoners who are at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nupon orders of the King, signed by him, or of the late Monsieur de\r\nSeignelay. You have no other rules of conduct to follow with respect to\r\nall those who are confided to your keeping beyond continuing to look to\r\ntheir security, _without explaining yourself to any one whatever about\r\nwhat your old prisoner_ HAS DONE.”[113]\r\n\r\nBut what crime could this pretended brother of Louis XIV. have\r\ncommitted, except, indeed, that of coming into the world? Is it\r\nobjected that a slight fault committed in prison may be referred to,\r\nand that Barbézieux, in this despatch, alludes to a recent occurrence?\r\nBut, if he recommends Saint-Mars not to explain himself to any one\r\nwhatever, it is evident that curiosity had been excited, and that every\r\none on the island trying to satisfy it, the Minister thought it right\r\nto recommend, more energetically than ever, an absolute discretion.\r\nWould this discretion have been necessary, and would Saint-Mars have\r\nbeen questioned, if only an insignificant breach of the internal rules\r\nof the prison had been in question?\r\n\r\nFinally, what is one to think of the attentions, respect, particular\r\ncare, evidences of an humble deference, all the accessory circumstances\r\nthat have been invoked in favour of an opinion which nothing certain\r\njustifies? Amongst the incidents upon which so much stress has been\r\nlaid, and which form, in some degree, the romantic _dossier_ of the\r\nMan with the Iron Mask, some are exact, and will find their natural\r\nexplanation further on. Others, such as the visit of Louvois to the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite, have been invented at pleasure by popular\r\nimagination, and too easily welcomed by a complaisant credulity. It has\r\nbeen said, and is repeated every day, that the Minister visited this\r\nisland, and there spoke to the prisoner “with a degree of consideration\r\nwhich partook of respect,”[114] styling him “monseigneur.” Now Louvois\r\nwas only absent from the court in 1680 for a few weeks in order\r\nto go to Baréges. We have, day for day, the names of the towns he\r\npassed through.[115] The Isles Sainte-Marguerite, where, by the way,\r\nSaint-Mars did not arrive till seven years later, do not figure in\r\nthe itinerary; and, after this journey, Louvois never returned again\r\nto the South of France. As to the dramatic episode of the silver\r\ndish thrown out of the window, which exposes the fisherman who finds\r\nit at his feet to a great danger, it has its origin in a similar\r\nattempt made by a Protestant minister confined, in 1692, at the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite. This minister tried to interest people in his lot,\r\nby writing his complaints, not on a silver dish, which he did not\r\nhave at his disposition, but upon a pewter plate, which determined\r\nSaint-Mars to give him only earthenware for the future.[116] The fact\r\nhas been applied later to the Man with the Iron Mask, to whom, as to\r\nall legendary heroes, the adventures of very different personages are\r\nascribed. A careful examination of all the despatches collected will\r\nenable one to trace back each of these rumours to its origin, and\r\nseparate what is purely legendary from what is really historical.\r\n\r\nBut because the exactitude of many of the acts attributed to the Man\r\nwith the Iron Mask is disproved by this examination, one would be wrong\r\nin concluding that he never existed, or that, at least, there was not\r\na great interest in concealing his existence. It is incontestable that\r\nSaint-Mars did, in 1698, escort to Paris a prisoner who died there five\r\nyears later, who was known at the Bastille only under the name of “the\r\nprisoner from Provence,” and whose mysterious memory was perpetuated\r\nin the redoubtable fortress, to spread rapidly afterwards through the\r\nentire world. These are the real data of the problem. Although freed\r\nfrom all the foreign elements that have been mixed up with it, it\r\nexists and it remains to be solved. It is true that in the eyes of\r\nsome, to take away the seductive figure of a brother of Louis XIV. is\r\ngreatly to diminish the interest. But, addressing ourselves to those\r\nfor whom truth alone has a sovereign and incomparable charm, we say\r\nto them: The Man with the Iron Mask is not a son of Anne of Austria,\r\nbecause to the impossibility of fixing the date of his birth is added\r\nthe not less evident impossibility of proving his incarceration. If, in\r\norder to show that his birth is imaginary, we have touched upon many\r\ndelicate points, it is because the gravity of the accusations with\r\nwhich, in our days, the memory of Anne of Austria has been stigmatized,\r\nrender such justifications necessary. In addition to which, even should\r\nthese researches be indiscreet, it is much less blamable to have made\r\nthem for the purpose of defence rather than of accusation, and to have\r\nraised certain veils, in order to let innocence shine forth in place of\r\ncalumniating it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[108] All these facts come from official documents, authentic and\r\ntranscribed by us.

After having sacrificed to\r\ntruth this unfortunate brother of Louis XIV., called to the throne by\r\nhis origin, and kept away from it by a perpetual detention, they take\r\nrefuge in an intermediary system, undoubtedly less tempting, but of\r\nwhich the attraction is still very exciting, and which, in a certain\r\ndegree, reconciles the exigencies of truth with the taste for the\r\nromantic.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer the question of a prince of whose very birth we are\r\nignorant. The present one actually existed, and such interest as he\r\ninspires from the moment he comes into the world he owes to her who\r\ngave him birth. He is the son of that La Vallière, equally touching in\r\nher heroic resistance to the inclination which impels her towards Louis\r\nXIV., and in her yielding, whom one esteems even when she succumbs, and\r\nwhom one admires when she rises again to flee from the peril; who, long\r\nvirtuous, always upright and disinterested, lives entirely absorbed\r\nin her passion, then takes refuge in penitence, and powerful without\r\nhaving desired it; ignorant or careless of her influence, strong in\r\nher very weakness, subjugates without art and without study the most\r\nimperious of kings; who, after having charmed all her contemporaries\r\nby her sweet and simple grace, and passed from the torments of a\r\nlove unceasingly combated to the voluntary rigours of an expiation\r\ncourageously submitted to for thirty years, has remained the most\r\npleasing and most interesting character of this great reign, and will\r\nseduce even the most remote posterity.\r\n\r\nLouis de Bourbon, Count de Vermandois, inherited his mother’s grace.\r\nHe was tall and well made, and, like her, instinctively possessed that\r\ngift of pleasing which is never so engaging as when all about it is\r\nnatural and nothing appears to depend upon art. Good and liberal, he\r\nhad ways of obliging that were peculiar to himself,[118] and the most\r\nsensitive of men could not feel offended at his kindnesses. With such\r\nas these, when he wished to aid them, he made bets which he was certain\r\nto lose, or he sent them money by a hand which remained unknown. He was\r\nsuspected of acts of generosity, which he never acknowledged himself\r\nthe author of, and those whom he obliged had their necessities relieved\r\nwithout being required to testify their gratitude. His proud bearing\r\nand the air of supreme distinction which he inherited from his royal\r\nfather, drew attention towards him still more than his high origin. To\r\nthese outward charms, to these sentiments of exquisite delicacy and\r\nnatural kindliness, which attached to him the soldier as much as the\r\nofficer, Vermandois united a ready wit, a well-proved courage, a lively\r\nwish to distinguish himself, and to merit by splendid achievements the\r\nhigh dignity[119] to which, at the age of two years, he had been raised\r\nby the affection and pride of Louis XIV. Whilst still very young, and\r\nalready in the midst of the army of Flanders, he had concealed a severe\r\nillness in order not to miss the noble rendezvous of an attack.[120]\r\nLike many of those destined to die prematurely, and who appear to\r\nforesee it, Vermandois hastened as it were through life, and seemed\r\nto strive, in endeavouring to render himself early illustrious, to\r\nanticipate the blow that was about to strike him. But sufficient time\r\nto attain glory was to fail him, and it was his destiny to leave behind\r\nhim only the touching souvenir that attaches itself to beautiful hopes\r\nsuddenly dissipated by death.\r\n\r\nAn unforeseen _amende_ was, nevertheless, reserved for his memory.\r\nSixty years after his sad end an idea suddenly sprang up of adding\r\ntwenty years of captivity to his short existence, and with the view of\r\nrendering his destiny still more lamentable, of representing him as the\r\nmysterious victim of the rigours of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 there appeared at Amsterdam the _Mémoires Secrets pour servir\r\nà l’Histoire de Perse_,[121] which, under supposititious names,\r\ncontain the anecdotic history of the Court of France. This book, which\r\nhad a prodigious success, and the editions of which were rapidly\r\nmultiplied, owed in a great measure its celebrity to the following\r\nnarration: “Cha-abas (Louis XIV.) had a legitimate son, Sephi-Mirza\r\n(Louis, Dauphin of France), and a natural son, Giafer (Louis de\r\nBourbon, Count de Vermandois). Almost of the same age, they were of\r\nopposite characters. The latter did not allow any occasion to escape\r\nof saying that he pitied the French being destined some day to obey a\r\nprince without talent, and so little worthy to rule them. Cha-abas,\r\nto whom this conduct was reported, was fully sensible of its danger.\r\nBut authority yielded to paternal love, and this absolute monarch had\r\nnot sufficient strength to impose his will upon a son who abused his\r\nkindness. Finally, Giafer so far forgot himself one day as to strike\r\nSephi-Mirza. Cha-abas is at once informed of this. He trembles for\r\nthe culprit, but, however desirous he may be of feigning to ignore\r\nthis crime, what he owes to himself and to his crown, combined with\r\nthe noise this action has made at court, will not allow him to pay\r\nregard to his affection. He assembles, not without doing violence to\r\nhis feelings, his most intimate confidants, allows them to see all his\r\ngrief, and asks their advice. In view of the magnitude of the crime\r\nand conformably to the laws of the State, every one is in favour of\r\ninflicting the punishment of death. What a blow for so tender a father!\r\nHowever, one of the Ministers, more sensitive to the affliction of\r\nCha-abas than the rest, tells him that there is a method of punishing\r\nGiafer without depriving him of life; that he should be sent to the\r\narmy, which was then upon the frontiers of Feldran (Flanders); that\r\nshortly after his arrival, rumours could be spread that he was attacked\r\nby the plague, in order to alarm and keep away from him all those who\r\nmight wish to see him; that at the end of several days of feigned\r\nillness, he should be made to pass for dead, and that, whilst in the\r\npresence of the whole army obsequies worthy of his birth were performed\r\nfor him, he should be transferred by night with great secrecy to the\r\ncitadel of the island of Ormus (Isle Sainte-Marguerite). This advice\r\nwas generally approved of, and above all by an afflicted father.\r\nFaithful and discreet people were chosen for the management of the\r\naffair. Giafer starts for the army with a magnificent train. Everything\r\nis carried out as had been projected, and whilst the death of this\r\nunfortunate prince is being lamented in the camp, he is conveyed by\r\nby-roads to the island of Ormus, and placed in charge of the governor,\r\nwho had received in advance the order of Cha-abas not to let his\r\nprisoner be seen by any one whatever. A single servant, who was in the\r\nsecret, was sent with the Prince. But, having died upon the journey,\r\nthe leaders of the escort disfigured his face with dagger-strokes in\r\norder to prevent his being recognized, left him lying upon the road,\r\nand after having stripped him as a further precaution, continued their\r\nroute. Giafer was transferred to the citadel of Ispahan (the Bastille)\r\nwhen Cha-abas bestowed the governorship of it upon the governor of the\r\nisland of Ormus as a recompence for his fidelity. The precaution was\r\ntaken at the island of Ormus, as at the citadel of Ispahan, to put a\r\nmask over the face of Giafer, when on account of illness, or other\r\ncauses, it was necessary to let him be seen by any one.”[122]\r\n\r\nThis narration, which for the first time presented to public curiosity\r\nthe anecdote of the Man with the Iron Mask, at once furnished food for\r\nconversation and became the subject of the most lively controversies.\r\nSeveral distinguished critics hastened to adopt the opinion it\r\nexpressed, while others combated it, and for a long time the _Année\r\nLittéraire_ of Fréron was the theatre of a debate which had the\r\n_savants_ and the curious of the whole world for attentive audience.\r\nVoltaire himself, in introducing for the first time the hypothesis\r\nwhich makes the Man with the Iron Mask a brother of Louis XIV., did not\r\nsucceed in stifling an opinion which had secured a clever defender.\r\nFather Griffet, a patient disciple of Father Daniel, and the author of\r\nan excellent _Histoire de Louis XIII._, published in 1765, in his fine\r\n_Traité des Différentes Sortes des Preuves qui servent à établir la\r\nVérité dans l’Histoire_, a long dissertation upon the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, and in it pronounced resolutely for the Count de Vermandois. What\r\nproofs, or at least what probabilities, did he invoke?\r\n\r\nHe bases his argument upon the _Mémoires de Mademoiselle de\r\nMontpensier_, in which we read that “when Vermandois left for the\r\nsiege of Courtray, he had not long returned to the court; that the\r\nKing had been displeased with his conduct and would not see him, on\r\naccount of his having been mixed up with parties of debauchery; that\r\nsince that time he had lived in a very retired manner, and only went\r\nout to go to the Academy[123] and to mass in the morning; that those\r\nwhose company he had been keeping were not agreeable to the King,\r\nwhich caused much grief to Mademoiselle de la Vallière, by whom he\r\nwas well scolded.”[124] Father Griffet added that, long before the\r\npublication of the _Mémoires Secrets de Perse_, a rumour had spread\r\nthat the Count de Vermandois had been guilty, before his departure for\r\nthe army, of some great crime, such as a blow given to the Dauphin.\r\n“It had been generally spoken of,” says he, “on the strength of one of\r\nthose traditions which have need, indeed, of being proved, but which\r\nare not necessarily false; the remembrance of this one had always been\r\npreserved, although there was not much noise made about it in the time\r\nof the late King, for fear of displeasing him; of this many people\r\nwho lived under his reign can bear witness.” The learned historian\r\nfound another argument in the very name under which the prisoner of\r\nSaint-Mars was inscribed in the registers of the Church of Saint-Paul,\r\nthe letters which form this name of Marchiali being those of the two\r\nwords _hic amiral_, and designating thus by an anagram the high dignity\r\nof the son of Mademoiselle de la Vallière. Finally, he published in the\r\n_Année Littéraire_ a second tradition, according to which “on the very\r\nday the body of the Count de Vermandois was to be transported to Arras,\r\nthere left the camp, by a by-way, a litter in which it was believed\r\nthere was a prisoner of importance, although the rumour was spread that\r\nthe military chest was enclosed in it.”\r\n\r\nOf all these allegations, the only one that deserves to be discussed is\r\nthat which, reposing upon special evidence, namely, the _Mémoires de\r\nMademoiselle de Montpensier_, shows us the Count de Vermandois, fallen\r\ninto disgrace with Louis XIV. for having mixed himself up in certain\r\ndebaucheries, and starting almost at once for Courtray, where he was\r\nto meet his death. One certainly finds no allusion to “a great crime”\r\ncommitted by Vermandois upon the person of his legitimate brother, and\r\nthis very silence would suffice to invalidate the pretended tradition\r\ninvoked by Father Griffet. But as, from another point of view, these\r\n_Mémoires_ furnish a kind of basis for his argument, reveal a stain on\r\nthe memory of Vermandois, and indicate a period at which the offence\r\nmight have been possible, it is essential the value of this evidence\r\nshould be weighed.\r\n\r\nIn his _Traité des Différentes Sortes de Preuves qui servent à établir\r\nla Vérité dans l’Histoire_, Father Griffet himself very judiciously\r\nremarks that before adopting the opinion of a writer upon an\r\nindividual whose contemporary he had been, it is desirable to examine\r\nwhether he had not a powerful interest either to praise or to blame\r\nhim. Father Griffet displayed more prudent sagacity when he enunciated\r\nthis excellent precept than when he neglected to apply it to the\r\n_Mémoires de Mademoiselle de Montpensier_. He ought to have shown\r\nthis romantic princess in her true light, endowed with a too lively\r\nimagination, whose self-esteem rendered her extremely accessible to\r\nthe influence of others and incapable of protecting herself against\r\ninterested suggestions; whom Madame de Montespan and Madame de\r\nMaintenon, by incessant attentions and delicate and careful acts of\r\ncivility, easily gained over to their long-time common cause; and,\r\nin a word, whose credulous mind was entrapped by Madame de Maintenon\r\nin favour of the children of whom she was governess, and whom Madame\r\nde Montespan had had by Louis XIV. To love these, and above all the\r\nawkward Duke du Maine, must have led her almost infallibly to repulse\r\nthe highly-gifted son of Mademoiselle de la Vallière, who had the\r\nleast intriguing and the most disinterested of the royal favourites\r\nfor mother, whilst his brother, better seconded, received from those\r\nsurrounding him advice suitable to gain the heart, and perhaps one\r\nday assure him the immense fortune,[125] of the opulent cousin of\r\nLouis XIV. To attain this object, to influence her, as was done, in\r\nfavour of a child deprived of all attractive qualities, they did not\r\nhesitate dictating for her the most affectionate letters to the Duke\r\ndu Maine, pointing out to him the steps most likely to please her,\r\nand suggesting to him filial sentiments for a Princess whom they ended\r\nby inspiring with a veritable maternal love, of which Mademoiselle de\r\nMontpensier had all the jealousy, at first provoked but afterwards\r\nspontaneous, and which led her to detest the brilliant rival of the\r\nvery insignificant but attentive Duke du Maine. This sentiment breaks\r\nout in several parts of her _Mémoires_. “It seemed to me,” she remarks,\r\n“that it was in order to disparage M. du Maine people said that no one\r\nwould ever equal M. de Vermandois.” And elsewhere, “I was not vexed at\r\nthe death of M. de Vermandois, I was well pleased that M. du Maine had\r\nnothing to do with his affairs.”[126] How, after this, can we put faith\r\nin such suspicious testimony? There is nothing to prove and nothing to\r\ndisprove that Vermandois may have been led away by youth into being\r\npresent at some dissolute pleasure-party unknown to the King, and that\r\nhe may have incurred the latter’s reproaches by this conduct. But his\r\ndisgrace and the causes to which it is ascribed, his hasty departure,\r\nhis father refusing to see him and banishing him from his presence,\r\nMademoiselle de la Vallière in distress: all these circumstances,\r\nwhich are only to be found in the _Mémoires_ of the adoptive mother\r\nof the Duke du Maine--must we accept them when impartial witnesses\r\nbestow unqualified praises upon the Count de Vermandois[127] and relate\r\nnothing that can tarnish his memory? Must we accept them when, some\r\ndays after this pretended disgrace, and at the first news of what was\r\nthought to be only a slight indisposition, Louis XIV. writes to the\r\nMarquis de Montchevreuil to cause Vermandois to return at once to the\r\ncourt, in order that greater care may be taken of him and that he may\r\nmore thoroughly recover.[128]\r\n\r\nIs there any need to set forth the impossibility of admitting that of\r\ntwo sons of Louis XIV., one, the Grand-Dauphin, the heir to the crown,\r\ncould have received from the other the gravest of insults, in the\r\nmidst of the court and at the end of a violent discussion, without any\r\ncontemporary writer having spoken of an event which would have had an\r\ninevitable celebrity? In order to make this circumstance appear less\r\nimprobable, the _Mémoires de Perse_ represent Vermandois as fiery,\r\nhaughty, and unsubmissive to a brother who would one day be his king,\r\nwhereas the most unexceptionable testimony[129] establishes the fact\r\nthat he was mild, affable, full of deference, and only anxious to\r\nacquire glory. The author of these _Mémoires_, in order to render a\r\ndispute between the two brothers more plausible, asserts, in addition,\r\nthat they were of the same age, instead of which there were six years\r\nbetween them; and, at the period when this passionate act is ascribed\r\nto him, Vermandois was barely sixteen, while the Dauphin was already\r\nthe father of the Duke de Bourgogne.\r\n\r\nThere remains his premature death. Tacitus has said that when princes\r\nor extraordinary men die young, one finds it difficult to believe that\r\nthey have been carried off by a natural course. This remark applies\r\nwith justice to all epochs, and in our annals how many crimes are\r\nthere, imagined by popular passion and credited through the ignorance\r\nof the time, of which a healthy criticism, aided by the progress of\r\nmedical science,[130] has in our days acquitted the pretended authors?\r\nIs there, in the last moments of Vermandois and in the transport of\r\nhis remains to Arras, where he was buried, the smallest circumstance\r\nthat can allow the most credulous mind to retain a single doubt, and to\r\nsuppose that he left the camp of Courtray alive to be confided to the\r\nguardianship of Saint-Mars?\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1683, the Count de Vermandois takes to his bed at\r\nCourtray. Ill for several days before, he has concealed his condition\r\nin order not to quit the army, and to be able to assist at the attack\r\non the faubourg of Menin, where he displayed the highest courage.\r\n\r\nConsumed by fever, he is at length compelled to separate from the first\r\n_corps-d’armée_, which is about to form the camp of Harlebeck. Marshal\r\nd’Humières had had the intention of causing him to be transported\r\nto Lille, and with this object had already made arrangements with\r\nthe Marquis de Montchevreuil.[131] But a speedy aggravation of the\r\ninvalid’s condition hinders the execution of this project. On the 8th\r\nbleeding relieves him;[132] but, on the 12th, Marshal d’Humières writes\r\nto Louvois that there are grounds for considerable uneasiness.[133] On\r\nthe 13th Boufflers writes to the court that, the head of Vermandois\r\ncommencing to be affected by the disease, bleeding from the feet has\r\nbecome necessary.[134] On the 14th Marshal d’Humières, who had come\r\nto Courtray from the camp of Rousselaer, of which he is commander,\r\nfinds Vermandois at the worst, the doctors very undecided, “and not\r\ndaring to resort to extreme remedies.” They determine to try them,\r\nhowever, but, doubtless, too late; for, after a tolerably favourable\r\nday, during which the fever seemed to diminish and the brain to become\r\nclearer, a violent agitation ensues, abundant perspiration exhausts the\r\npatient,[135] and, on the 16th, Boufflers announces that Vermandois\r\nhas just received the last communion,[136] and that there is no longer\r\nany hope except in his youth. At the moment that he was writing this\r\nletter, Madame de Maintenon wrote to Madame de Brinon:[137] “M. de\r\nVermandois is very ill; have our great saint prayed to for him.”\r\nVain hope, useless prayers! On November 18 the son of La Vallière\r\ndied of a malignant fever, surrounded by Marshal d’Humières, whom\r\nhe had begged to remain near him, the Marquis de Montchevreuil, and\r\nLieutenant-General Boufflers.[138] In the camp the grief was general,\r\nand the troops wept for him, for the good which he had done and the\r\ngreat things he had promised. At the court the impressions were\r\nvarious. The Hôtel de Condé deeply regretted this death, because the\r\nPrince was betrothed to Mademoiselle de Bourbon. The Princess de Conti,\r\nsister to Vermandois, was inconsolable.[139]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV., much more sensitive than tender, and whose grief relieved\r\nitself all at once in a flood of tears which was of very short\r\nduration, had, moreover, already shown in favour of the children he\r\nhad had by Madame de Montespan a sentiment of predilection which was\r\nto survive their mother’s disgrace, and which Madame de Maintenon,\r\ntheir former governess, carefully cherished. As to Mademoiselle de la\r\nVallière, Voltaire has said,[140] and it has been often repeated after\r\nhim, that she exclaimed on learning the fatal news: “It is not his\r\ndeath that I should lament, but his birth.” This exclamation is not\r\ntrue; it is not that of a mother. That the pious Carmelite offered as\r\na sacrifice this new blow that smote her, that she accepted it as an\r\nadditional expiation for her faults, one may admit. But that her tears\r\nonly flowed because she had brought Vermandois into the world, that, at\r\nthe announcement of the most painful of afflictions, she was so little\r\ncrushed by it as to be able to utter such words, is what no mother\r\nwill believe. How much more acceptable is that testimony which Madame\r\nde Sevigné bears in saying “that she perfectly tempered her maternal\r\nlove with that of the spouse of Jesus Christ.” “Mademoiselle de la\r\nVallière is all day at the foot of the crucifix,” says the Présidente\r\nd’Osembray[141] on December 22. This is the true language of two\r\nmothers speaking of another mother who had just lost her son.\r\n\r\nPompous obsequies were performed over the remains of the son of Louis\r\nXIV. On November 21, the King sent word to the Chapter of Arras that\r\nthe body of the Count de Vermandois would be transported to that town\r\nand buried in the choir of its cathedral church.[142] On the 24th, the\r\nmayors and échevins, bearing wax tapers, proceed to the Méaulens Gate,\r\nwhere are already assembled the governors of the town and citadel, all\r\nthe officers of the staff, the clergy of the different parishes, and\r\nthe friars of the mendicant orders. The infantry line the road from the\r\nentrance of the town to the cathedral.[143] At noon the roar of cannon\r\nand the tolling of bells announces the arrival of the remains, which\r\nare contained in a coach hung with black cloth, and escorted by the\r\ncavalry of the garrison. The Bishop of Arras, clothed in his pontifical\r\nrobes, and his chapter, advance in procession and receive the body,\r\nwhich, removed from the coach, is borne by canons, and followed by the\r\nofficers of the Council of Artois, those of the bailiwick, and all the\r\nother dignitaries of the county. Until Saturday the 27th, the day fixed\r\nfor the solemn service, masses were said without intermission from six\r\no’clock till noon in the Chapel of Saint-Vaast, where the body had been\r\nplaced, and the canons and chaplains succeeded each other in praying\r\nthere, the first during the day, the others during the night.[144]\r\nThey selected, in the middle of the choir of the cathedral, in the\r\nplace of “the angel,” the spot that appeared most distinguished for\r\nthe inhumation, for, five hundred years before, it had served for the\r\ninterment of Isabelle de Vermandois, wife of Philip d’Alsace, Count\r\nof Flanders, and descendant in the direct line of Henri I., King of\r\nFrance. The last ceremony was worthy, in its pomp and splendour, of\r\nthe King who had commanded it, and of the Prince in whose honour it\r\nwas performed. The choir and the nave of the cathedral, entirely hung\r\nwith black velvet, upon which shone silver escutcheons emblazoned with\r\nthe arms of Vermandois, the lugubrious harmony of the service, the\r\nfunereal light of the tapers, the sad and silent troops, the spectators\r\nall clothed in mourning, and, still more than these external signs, a\r\nsincere grief manifesting itself, especially amongst the gentlemen of\r\nthe Prince’s suite, in tears and sobs; such is the spectacle that the\r\ninterior of the cathedral church of Arras presents on November 27, 1683.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of the King’s piety, and of the eagerness of the Chapter\r\nto satisfy it, did not end here. On January 24, 1684, M. Chauvelin,\r\nIntendant of the province, drew up with the Chapter, in the name of\r\nLouis XIV., a deed in which it was stipulated “that the prelate, dean,\r\nand canons should say every day, each in his turn and during the\r\nyear following the inhumation, a low requiem mass in the _chapelle\r\nardente_,[145] prepared and hung with mourning for this purpose; that\r\non the 18th November of every year, or in case of hindrance on another\r\nday near that date, there should be celebrated in perpetuity in their\r\nchurch a solemn service, preceded by vigils of nine psalms and nine\r\nlessons; that the Chapter should distribute annually to fifty poor\r\npeople, who were to be present at these offices, five sols each, and an\r\neight-pounds loaf; that there should also be given every year by the\r\nChapter on the day of the service, to the poor _Clairisses_[146] of the\r\ncity of Arras, a sum of six livres, in order that their community might\r\npray for the soul of the Count de Vermandois, and that all the bells\r\nshould be tolled on the day, and on the evening before, as is customary\r\nat the obits of the bishops.” In order to indemnify the Chapter for the\r\nexpenditure imposed by him, Louis XIV. bestowed upon it, in addition to\r\nmagnificent presents, a sum of 10,000 livres, which served to purchase\r\nat the village of La Coutaie, near Béthune, a farm, since then, and\r\nfor that cause, known as the Ferme de Vermandois. Until the year 1789,\r\nthe stipulations contained in this deed were faithfully executed,\r\nand, during more than a century, November 25 witnessed a renewal of\r\nthe alms of the Chapter, the prayers of the clergy, the assemblage of\r\nall the magistrates and municipal officers, and, in this manner, the\r\nremembrance of the son of La Vallière.\r\n\r\nIn supposing that Vermandois could have given way to such a violent and\r\nhasty act towards the Dauphin, without the proof of it being handed\r\ndown to us; that Louis XIV. was cruel enough to condemn a beloved\r\nson to perpetual imprisonment; and, finally, that it was possible to\r\nkeep his abduction secret in the midst of the troops, how can we\r\npossibly admit that ceremonies, which the pious monarch always regarded\r\nas sacred, could have been ordered by him to deceive his subjects\r\nand take advantage of their credulity? How can we admit that this\r\nillness, of which we have traced all the phases, was feigned; that the\r\ndespatches that have been analysed were false; that Louis XIV. had for\r\nthe accomplices of his stratagem men such as the Lieutenant-General\r\nBoufflers, Marshal d’Humières, and the Marquis de Montchevreuil; that,\r\nnot content with making them take part in such a singular project, he\r\nmade a mockery of religion the better to mask it? How can we admit\r\nthat this bier, round which prayers ascended and tears flowed, was\r\nempty,[147] and that the Prince, of whom pompous epitaphs vaunt the\r\nqualities, was then in rigorous confinement at Pignerol? Finally, how\r\nexplain, if not as the testimony of his sincere piety and affection,\r\nthis solemn service, founded in perpetuity by Louis XIV., and which,\r\nin prolonging it, would have aggravated an impious derision, and\r\nperpetuated the memory of a profane fraud?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[117] In the preceding chapters we have made no mention of a _Mémoire\r\nde M. de Saint-Mars sur la Naissance de l’Homme au Masque de Fer_,\r\npublished in vol. iii. of the _Mémoires de Tous_ (Levasseur, 1835,\r\n8vo). According to this document, “copied by M. Billiard from the\r\nArchives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” M. de Saint-Mars had\r\nbeen the governor of the mysterious son of Anne of Austria, whose\r\nhigh origin was carefully hidden from him. But this brother of Louis\r\nXIV. having discovered it, was sent to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nthe command of which was then (in 1687) confided to his governor. If\r\nwe have not spoken of this document, it is because its authenticity\r\nhas already been completely disproved. It is nothing else than a copy\r\nof the apocryphal narrative of Soulavie, which we have transcribed\r\nand refuted in the first part of our work (see page 15). The author\r\nof this copy has contented himself with substituting Saint-Mars for\r\nthe “anonymous governor of the unfortunate prince.” He did not think\r\nthat he thereby added a fresh impossibility to those contained in\r\nthe narrative of Soulavie. For how could Saint-Mars, before 1687,\r\nhave been the governor of a brother of Louis XIV., when a hundred\r\ndespatches establish the fact that, from 1664, he was successively\r\ngovernor of the donjon of Pignerol and of Exiles? As to the presence\r\nof this document in the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\nthere is no reason for astonishment. It is explained, like the presence\r\nof so many other documents in our archives, by the seizure of the\r\npapers of great personages after their deaths, or, more commonly, by\r\nhaving been transmitted by some ambassador inhabiting the country\r\nin which these apocryphal writings circulated freely. But the place\r\nwhere they are found gives them no authenticity. At all periods, and\r\nto-day even, ambassadors send to the Government copies of anonymous\r\nmemoirs, pamphlets, and different papers, which remain joined to\r\ntheir despatches, but to which no historical value can be ascribed.\r\nIt has been the same with this pretended _Mémoire de Saint-Mars_, of\r\nwhich, in addition, a mere perusal demonstrates the untruth to any\r\none acquainted with the usual style of the illiterate governor of the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite. One sometimes hears it related--and this fact\r\nhas been repeated to ourselves--that a great personage of a former\r\nGovernment introduced one of his friends, with much precaution, into\r\nthe galleries of the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and\r\nthere showed him a document which contained the secret of the Man with\r\nthe Iron Mask. It is doubtless the document attributed to Saint-Mars\r\nthat is referred to in this anecdote.\r\n\r\n[118] Letter of Madame la Présidente d’Osembray to Bussy-Rabutin, dated\r\nDecember 22, 1683:--_Lettres de Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy_, vol.\r\nvi. p. 135, edition of 1716.

The Church of Saint-Nicolas\r\nwas built upon the site which it occupied in that part of Arras styled\r\nthe Cité, formerly completely distinct from the town properly so\r\ncalled.

To this decisive proof we have felt bound\r\nto add others for those who might be tempted to believe that another\r\nbody than that of Vermandois had been enclosed in the coffin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n Causes which render the Theory probable that makes Monmouth the Man\r\n with the Iron Mask--Political Position of Monmouth--His Portrait--He\r\n is persuaded to revolt against his Uncle James II.--He lands near Lyme\r\n Regis--His first Successes--Enthusiasm with which he is received--His\r\n premature Discouragement--His Defeat at Sedgemoor--His shameful\r\n Flight--He is captured and taken to London--Cowardly Terrors of the\r\n Prisoner--His Interview with James II.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It has been asserted,” says M. de Sévelinges, in an article of the\r\n_Biographie Universelle_,[148] “that the famous Man with the Iron\r\nMask was no other than the Duke of Monmouth. Of all the conjectures\r\nthat have been made upon this subject, it is perhaps one of the\r\nleast unreasonable.” M. de Sévelinges says truly that in favour of\r\nthis candidate for the honour of being the Man with the Iron Mask,\r\nif we cannot invoke one of those decisive proofs which enforce\r\nconviction, there are at least several indications which seem to unite\r\nin designating him, and in forming what the English call cumulative\r\nevidence. The greatness of the crime to be punished, the powerful\r\ninterest there was to effect the disappearance of this leader of\r\nrevolt, and carry him off for ever from his partisans, the persistent\r\nincredulity of the people respecting his death, his near relationship\r\nto James II., which renders the penalty of perpetual imprisonment\r\nmore probable than that of death, are so many circumstances which, in\r\ncertain respects, justify the opinion put forth in the last century by\r\nSaint-Foix, and explain the obstinacy of this publicist in defending it.\r\n\r\nMonmouth is one of those historical personages who have been very\r\nvariously, and in some degree contradictorily, appreciated. Placed\r\nat the head of a party which, from the first days of the reign of\r\nJames II., sought to overthrow a king who remained a Catholic in the\r\nmidst of a nation almost entirely Protestant; having attempted in\r\n1685 a revolution which, three years later, was to be accomplished\r\nwith perfect success by a prince better endowed and much more apt in\r\nplaying this great part, Monmouth has incurred the blind enmity of\r\nthe Catholics, and met with excessive praise from their adversaries.\r\nUnjustly vilified by the one party, insulted beyond measure by the\r\nother, he has been represented on the one side as an adventurer\r\ndevoid of all qualities, and rashly engaging against his uncle in a\r\nmad enterprise fatally condemned to insuccess. Others have seen in\r\nhim the glorious defender of the interests of the Anglican religion,\r\nthreatened by the sovereign, the worthy precursor of William of Orange,\r\nthe champion of the true faith, whose failure is to be ascribed to\r\nunforeseen circumstances and the incapacity of his lieutenants. The\r\nsame contradiction that exists in the judgments passed upon his attempt\r\nis to be found in the opinions given by his biographers as to his\r\norigin. Whilst some deny that he was the natural son of Charles II.,\r\nand give us to understand that Lucy Walters was already pregnant with\r\nhim when she became the mistress of the exiled Stuart, others are\r\ninclined to see in Monmouth his legitimate offspring, the issue of a\r\nregular marriage contracted during his exile by a king deprived of his\r\ncrown, very thoughtless, and madly in love. As always is the case, the\r\ntruth lies between these two extremes of disparagement and favour.\r\nCharles II. constantly showed the love of a father for Monmouth; but if\r\na marriage had united him to Lucy Walters, the proofs would not have\r\nremained hidden in the famous “black box” in which Monmouth’s friends\r\nsupposed them to be. Brought to light, they would have allowed Charles\r\nII., deprived of other legitimate descendants, to indulge his fondness\r\nfor a son, an accomplished gentleman, and already the object at\r\nWhitehall of several distinctions reserved only for royal princes,[149]\r\nand to whom only legitimacy was wanting for him to be universally\r\nreceived as the heir-presumptive to the throne. During his father’s\r\nreign he enjoyed, in fact, a popularity which not even great defects\r\nhad been able to compromise, and which the hatred inspired by the Duke\r\nof York increased. People detected in the latter a future king entirely\r\ndevoted to the Papists, and loved still more in Monmouth a prince of\r\nengaging and courteous manner, distinguished without haughtiness,\r\nsometimes familiar, but without lowering himself, less effeminate\r\nin his manners than his royal father,[150] and whose libertinage,\r\nfiery character, and acts of violence, were pardoned in remembrance\r\nof his brilliant military exploits, in consideration of his past, and\r\nthe hopes that were based upon him. But the position at which he had\r\narrived was far above his merits. His birth and the attractions of his\r\nperson had raised him to it. As long as his father lived he maintained\r\nhimself in it, supported by the interested affection of the Whigs,\r\nand never having to display any qualities but those he was liberally\r\nendowed with. When, at the death of Charles II., it was necessary for\r\nhim to exhibit not only the gifts which had made him the idol of the\r\npeople, but the talents requisite to accomplish a revolution, and\r\nto seize upon a crown, the mediocrity of his faculties soon became\r\napparent. Intrepid upon the field of battle, he lacked decision in\r\nthe council, and wavered irresolute between contrary suggestions. His\r\nnatural kindness, which had won him the love of the people, sometimes\r\ndegenerated into weakness. Of a very malleable disposition, he yielded\r\ntoo easily to the influence of others, and was often only the executant\r\nof their will. His ardour in action, above all, arose from the contact\r\nof those surrounding him. He hardly ever derived it from his own\r\npowers, and, left to himself, he readily sank into indolence. When he\r\nlearnt in Holland the accession of James II., which closed England to\r\nhim, he could form no manly resolution, and forgot[151] in the company\r\nof a loved woman[152] that he was the hope of a numerous party, the\r\nsupport of a great cause, the pretender to a throne. This inaction\r\nhad its source in his carelessness and in his indolence of mind, much\r\nmore than in a taste for obscurity; for he did not long resist the\r\nprayers of his friends when they came to drag him from his retreat and\r\narm him against James II.,[153] and not having had sufficient energy\r\nto conceive the enterprise himself, he equally lacked the resolution\r\nto object to it. Such was the man whose coming a notable part of the\r\nEnglish nation longed for, who was about to shake a throne, but without\r\nsucceeding in overthrowing it; because he had neither the profound\r\nviews nor the persevering audacity with which great ambitions ripen and\r\nexecute their projects.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1685, Monmouth, accompanied by eighty men well armed,\r\nlanded on the coast of Dorsetshire, near the little port of Lyme. The\r\nresult of this expedition is a matter of history. There is no need\r\nto recount the triumphant march to Taunton, the enthusiasm of the\r\nWest, the fatal field of Sedgemoor, and the ignominious flight of the\r\nleader of the insurgents.[154] Some days afterwards a man in tattered\r\ngarments, with haggard face and hair prematurely white, is dragged\r\nfrom a ditch, at the bottom of which he was crouching, half hidden by\r\nthe long grass and nettles, trembling and livid with fear, his pockets\r\nfilled with peas gathered to satisfy the cravings of ravenous hunger.\r\nIt was the darling of Charles’s court, the hero of Bothwell Brig, “King\r\nMonmouth.”\r\n\r\nFinding himself in the power of a monarch whom he had come to\r\noverthrow, whose real faults he had not only pointed out, but whom he\r\nhad also calumniated by accusations as infamous as unmerited, Monmouth\r\ndid not understand that he was lost, and that James II., always\r\ninexorable, would not feel for his most cruel enemy a pity that was\r\nunknown to him. Self-respect and his own dignity should have prohibited\r\nthe vanquished from appealing to the clemency of his conqueror, even\r\nhad this clemency been at all probable. But mere reason indicated that\r\nto ask mercy of James II. would only be a useless abasement, and that\r\nthere was nothing left but to prepare for death. Monmouth had neither\r\nthe courage nor the wisdom to reject the thought of an unavailing\r\nhumiliation. He wrote to James II. in the most abject terms.[155] His\r\nletter was that of a man crushed by the approach of death, and who\r\nsacrifices to the desire of living his past, his honour, those whom he\r\nhad sought to gain over without succeeding, as well as the partisans\r\nwhom he had conducted to their ruin. This was not all: no longer\r\nable to arrest himself in his ignominious descent, he desired to see\r\nJames II., and the latter was sufficiently inhuman to consent to an\r\ninterview, which it was his unalterable will should remain sterile.\r\nNot to spare such an enemy was justified to a certain extent by the\r\nviolence of his attacks; but to admit him to his presence without\r\npardoning him was a refinement of vengeance and harshness. He enjoyed\r\nthe barbarous pleasure of seeing his redoubtable adversary confounded,\r\nfalling at his feet, embracing his knees, shedding bitter tears, vainly\r\ntrying to hold out his fettered hands to him, acknowledging and cursing\r\nhis crime, offering to abjure his religion, and become a Catholic,[156]\r\nbeseeching pardon, pardon at any price. To this eagerness for life, to\r\nthese supplications James II. only opposed silence, and turning away\r\nhis head he terminated an interview, in which we hardly know whether\r\nto feel most indignant at the cold cruelty of the conqueror or at the\r\ndegrading terror and cowardly humiliation of the vanquished.\r\n\r\nIt is at this moment that Saint-Foix, introducing Monmouth into this\r\nproblem, gives him Louis XIV. for a guardian, Saint-Mars for a gaoler,\r\nand the prison of Pignerol for a residence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[148] _Biographie Universelle_ of Michaud, article “Monmouth.”\r\n\r\n[149] He resided in the King’s palace, had pages, and when he travelled\r\nwas everywhere received like a prince. Charles II. created him\r\nsuccessively Earl of Orkney, Knight of the Garter, and Duke of Monmouth.\r\n\r\n[150] Grammont says of Monmouth in his _Mémoires:_ “His face and the\r\ngraces of his person were such that Nature has perhaps never formed\r\nany more accomplished. His countenance was perfectly charming. It was\r\nthe face of a man; nothing insipid, nothing effeminate about it. Every\r\nfeature had its attraction and its especial delicacy. A marvellous\r\ninclination for all kinds of exercises, an engaging manner, an air of\r\ngrandeur--in short, all bodily advantages pleaded in his favour; but he\r\nhad no sentiment except such as was inspired by others.”\r\n\r\n[151] Letter from Monmouth to James, dated from Ringwode, quoted by\r\nMacaulay, _Histoire d’Angleterre depuis l’Avénement de Jacques II._,\r\ntranslation of M. de Peyronnet, vol. i. p. 398.\r\n\r\n[152] Lady Henrietta Wentworth.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[153] Burnet, vol. i. p. 630.\r\n\r\n[154] M.

To the\r\nobjection founded upon the uselessness of always leaving in mystery\r\nthe name of the prisoner who died in 1703, when both James II. and\r\nWilliam of Orange had also ceased to live, Saint-Foix replied, very\r\njudiciously, that Louis XIV. might have consented to guard Monmouth\r\nat Pignerol, both in order to oblige James II., his ally, and to have\r\nin his power a Stuart, whom he might one day be able to oppose to\r\nthe ambition of William of Orange, if James II. continued to remain\r\nchildless; but that the unexpected birth of a Prince of Wales[161]\r\nhaving rendered this piece of foresight useless, it was natural that\r\nLouis XIV. would not wish it known that he had constituted himself\r\nthe gaoler of an English prince. “It was very likely indeed,” added\r\nSaint-Foix,[162] “that the partisans of William of Orange having\r\npublished that this Prince of Wales was a supposititious child, would\r\nnot have failed to say that since means had been found to represent\r\non the scaffold and behead one man in place of another, it was much\r\neasier to feign a pregnancy and a confinement.” Now Louis XIV., who\r\nhad continued to support the exiled Stuarts with sufficient obstinacy\r\nto imprudently recognize this Prince of Wales under the title of James\r\nIII.,[163] was bound to prevent a revelation of a nature to confirm\r\nthe injurious doubts which had arisen at the period of this Prince’s\r\nbirth.[164]\r\n\r\nThe necessity for the mystery being thus justified by the pride\r\nand self-interest of Louis XIV., Saint-Foix refuted Father Griffet\r\nnot less cleverly on the point of the substitution of an unknown\r\nindividual for Monmouth about to die on the scaffold. Reproached with\r\nits improbability, he answered that this generosity was very easy to\r\ncomprehend--that such an act of devotion had scarcely any merit in\r\nan officer of Monmouth’s army, condemned, like the latter, to death,\r\nand who was sacrificing to his old general, not his life, but simply\r\nhis name. Finally, a comparative examination of several circumstances\r\nconnected with the execution, ingeniously touched upon and grouped\r\ntogether, such as the choice of the bishops attending the condemned,\r\nthe few words that he uttered, the look of reproach which he gave the\r\nexecutioner, who did not kill him at the first blow of the axe,[165]\r\nfinished by convincing Saint-Foix.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Saint-Foix’s error was also that of a portion of the English\r\nnation, who, through idolizing Monmouth, came to disbelieve in the fact\r\nof his death, just as Saint-Foix did through attachment to his theory.\r\nThe popular affection survived even the generation who had espoused his\r\ncause;[166] and the hero, adorned with all the seductive qualities that\r\nhad made him the idol of the people, and clothed by time with qualities\r\nwhich he the least[167] possessed, speedily became a legendary\r\ncharacter. In Dorsetshire and the neighbouring counties, many, during\r\nthe remainder of their lives, cherished the hope of seeing him again;\r\nand for very many years, on the occasion of any important event, the\r\nold men used confidently to announce in whispers that the time was\r\napproaching when King Monmouth would reappear. Several ballads foretold\r\nthis return:--[168]\r\n\r\n  “Though this is a dismal story\r\n    Of the fall of my design,\r\n  Yet I’ll come again in glory,\r\n    If I live till eighty-nine;\r\n  For I’ll have a stronger army,\r\n    And of ammunition store.”\r\n\r\nAgain--\r\n\r\n  “Then shall Monmouth in his glories\r\n    Unto his English friends appear,\r\n  And will stifle all such stories\r\n    As are vended everywhere.\r\n\r\n  They’ll see I was not so degraded,\r\n    To be taken gathering pease,\r\n  Or in a cock of hay up braided.\r\n    What strange stories now are these!”\r\n\r\nIn many poor families trifling objects which had belonged to him\r\nhave been preserved as precious relics even to our own days, and two\r\nimpostors having on different occasions travelled about the country\r\nunder the name of Monmouth, found everywhere among the lower orders\r\nthe most cordial reception, as well as encouragement, assistance, and\r\nevidence of the most touching and constant affection.\r\n\r\nHow much more would this adoration, of which Monmouth had rendered\r\nhimself unworthy by his flight, have nevertheless embellished his\r\nmemory, and, without absolving him, have made of him a legendary hero;\r\nhow much more striking still would it have appeared, if, as Saint-Foix\r\nbelieved, he of whom the poets sang in their ballads, of whom the\r\npeasants talked by their firesides in the evening, and whose speedy\r\nreturn the people were awaiting, had been, at that very instant,\r\nconfined in a prison in the remotest parts of the Alps, his face hidden\r\nfrom the gaze of man, unknown to all save a gaoler as rigorous as he\r\nwas incorruptible? When the stage took possession of the subject of\r\nthe Man with the Iron Mask, it preferred to adopt the version which\r\nmakes him a brother of Louis XIV., as being the most interesting one.\r\nThe supposition that Monmouth was the Man with the Iron Mask would\r\nhave been much more dramatic, because, while in some points touching\r\nupon reality, it would, on the one hand, have allowed of representing\r\na whole nation plunged in grief and filled with expectation, and on\r\nthe other, the conquered of Sedgemoor following Saint-Mars from prison\r\nto prison, and after having almost attained a throne, being obscurely\r\ninterred in the evening by two turnkeys of the Bastille!\r\n\r\nBut however thrilling this accumulation of misfortune would have\r\nbeen, history cannot admit its truth. Whatever Saint-Foix may have\r\nthought--whatever the English common people may have believed--Monmouth\r\ndied on the scaffold, July 15, 1685. Authentic despatches, signed\r\nby Louis XIV.’s ambassador,[169] furnish proof of it; and this\r\nmonarch, far from having been an accomplice, as has been said, of an\r\nabduction of the Duke, and far from having consented to act as his\r\nkeeper, received day by day exact news of the early progress of his\r\nrevolt, and of his defeat, capture, and death. In these despatches,\r\npenned by an impartial and perfectly independent witness, and which\r\nappeared destined never to be divulged, there is nothing that allows\r\nus to suppose that a pardon was granted, but we find in them instead\r\nirrefragable proof of James II.’s inflexible severity. Almost to\r\nhis last moment Monmouth showed himself but little worthy of the\r\nregret which he was to leave behind him. He saw his wife, but without\r\nemotion, and thought only of again beseeching his life from the Earl of\r\nClarendon, who accompanied her. On the evening of Monday, July 14, he\r\nlearned that he would be led to death the next morning. At once turning\r\npale, he remained for a long time silent, and the first word that he\r\ncould utter was a demand for a respite. He repeated this in several\r\nletters addressed to James II., as well as to the most considerable\r\npersons of the court, and desired to see the King once more, a request\r\nwhich was refused him.[170] When he had lost all hope he became\r\nshamefully depressed: to agitation, and to the efforts exerted up to\r\nthat moment to save his life, succeeded a gloomy silence; to cowardly\r\nfears, the dejection of despair. The next day his children were brought\r\nto him; he blessed them, and bade them adieu, as well as his wife,\r\nfrom whom he parted without sorrow.[171] For many years his affection\r\nhad been given to Lady Wentworth, whom he said was his wife before God,\r\nwhilst he had espoused Lady Monmouth when too young for the marriage\r\nto be according to the spirit of God, although valid before the law.\r\nDuring the hours which preceded his death, Lady Wentworth was the\r\nconstant object of his preoccupations, of his regrets, and of his most\r\nlively solicitude. Sometimes he maintained that his long relations\r\nwith her had always been innocent, sometimes he gave out that he had\r\nalways considered her as his legitimate wife. Without doubt it was the\r\nrecollection of this noble and distinguished person, who loved him\r\ntenderly, and who a few months afterwards was to follow him to the\r\ntomb, that caused Monmouth to regain his feeling of dignity, till then\r\ndisregarded. He all at once became more firm; and at ten in the morning\r\nentered the carriage of the Lieutenant of the Tower with a courage\r\nworthy of his race and of the woman who had inspired it in him.\r\n\r\nThe open space where the scaffold was erected, all the streets leading\r\nto it, and the roofs of the neighbouring houses were covered with a\r\nmultitude, who showed its disapprobation by a silence broken only by\r\nsighs and sobs. Every eye was fixed on Monmouth, who, having smilingly\r\nsaluted the soldiers of the guard, was mounting with a firm foot the\r\nsteps of the scaffold. Every one awaits with anxiety his last words.\r\nHe pronounces them in a loud and distinct voice, and with the energy\r\nof fanaticism. He finishes by saying, “That he has satisfied his\r\nconscience, and that he dies in peace with God.” The Sheriff having\r\npressed him to declare before the people whether he died in the\r\nfaith of the English Church, he answered “Yes,” without hesitation;\r\nand on the bishops who accompanied him observing that, according to\r\nthe principles of that church, he ought to obey his lawful king, he\r\nreplied, “There is no question of that now; I have nothing to say\r\nabout it.” Then he added, “that he had God’s pardon, and that he had\r\nnothing to reproach himself with in reference to Lady Wentworth, for\r\nwhom he entertained as much esteem as affection.” The Sheriff having\r\nrepresented to him the scandal which he had caused in Holland by living\r\npublicly with this woman, and having asked him if he had married her,\r\n“I am sorry for this scandal,” replied Monmouth, “but this is not\r\nthe time to answer your question.” The bishops afterwards conversed\r\nwith him about the consequences of his revolt, of the blood which he\r\nhad caused to be shed, and of so many companions led on by him to\r\ntheir ruin. Affected by this language, Monmouth said in a low voice\r\nthat he agreed with them and that he regretted it. Next the bishops\r\npresent offered up fervent prayers, which the Prince listened to with\r\nattention, and to each of which he answered, “Amen!” Then, addressing\r\nthe executioner, he gave him six guineas, earnestly begging him to\r\ndo his work quickly, and not to serve him like Lord Russell, whom he\r\nhad struck three or four times. After having assured himself that the\r\naxe was sufficiently sharp, he refused to have his eyes bandaged, and\r\nplaced his head upon the block. The bishops continue their prayers. The\r\ntears of the crowd flow fast. The executioner, probably troubled by the\r\nfears which Monmouth had expressed, strikes the first blow unskilfully.\r\nThe victim lifts up his head; then, without uttering a word, replaces\r\nit on the block. Three more blows are struck by the unsure hand of this\r\nman, whom the yells and imprecations of the crowd cause to tremble. At\r\nlength, at the fifth blow, the head is separated from the body, and the\r\nspectators rush upon the scaffold, some, in a state of fury, wishing to\r\npunish the awkward executioner, others, with pious haste, desirous of\r\ndipping their handkerchiefs in the blood of one whom they considered a\r\nmartyr.[172]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] _Amours de Charles II. et de Jacques II., Rois d’Angleterre._\r\nFirst part, pp. 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[158] _Réponse de M. de Saint-Foix au R.P.

(p. 51 _ante_) of the present work, in which this\r\naccusation of criminal fraud brought by William of Orange against his\r\nfather-in-law, James II., has already been considered.\r\n\r\n[165] According to Saint-Foix, the bishops chosen were not acquainted\r\nwith Monmouth’s appearance, and the _pretended_ officer only uttered\r\na few words, while the look given by the victim after the third blow\r\nof the axe was intended as a reproach to those who had promised that\r\nhe should die without pain. But these observations are more ingenious\r\nthan well-founded. Monmouth was accompanied to the scaffold by the\r\nbishops who had visited him in prison, and we shall shortly see that\r\nhe said a good deal, that the execution took place at ten o’clock\r\nin the morning, and that far from complaining even by a look of the\r\nexecutioner’s unskilfulness, Monmouth bore his horrible punishment with\r\ngreat resignation.\r\n\r\n[166] _Observator_, August 1, 1685; _Gazette de France_, November\r\n2, 1686; Letter of Humphrey Wanley, August 25, 1698, in the Aubrey\r\ncollection, given by Macaulay in his _History of England_.\r\n\r\n[167] “If the Duke of Monmouth had been able to have concealed\r\nhimself or to have escaped, his last action had given him such a good\r\nreputation amongst the English that he would have been able to have\r\ndrawn many persons towards him every time that he might have shown\r\nhimself to the people of England,” wrote the French ambassador to Louis\r\nXIV., July 19, 1685:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\nsection England, 155.\r\n\r\n[168] They are to be found in the Pepsyan Collection, and have been\r\ngiven by Macaulay in his _History of England_.\r\n\r\n[169] Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section England,\r\n155; Despatches, June 23 and 28, and July 12, 19, 23, 25 and 26, 1685.\r\n\r\n[170] Despatch from the French Ambassador, July 26, 1685: “He asked a\r\nsecond time to speak to him, but it was not allowed.”\r\n\r\n[171] Burnet, i. 645; Macaulay.\r\n\r\n[172] Official despatches from the French Ambassador in England, July\r\n15-25 and July 16-26, 1685.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n François de Vendôme, Duke de Beaufort--His Portrait--His Conduct\r\n during the War of the Fronde--Unimportance of this Individual--Motives\r\n cited by Lagrange-Chancel in support of his Theory--Their\r\n Improbability--Reasons which determined the Search for Proofs that\r\n leave no doubt of Beaufort’s Death at Candia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Monmouth, a royal prince and the issue of an illegitimate\r\nconnection, François de Vendôme had, like Monmouth, the rare privilege\r\nof being sufficiently beloved by the people for them, during a long\r\ntime, to have doubted of his death. Ten years after the expedition\r\nto Candia, where he disappeared, the market-women were still in the\r\nhabit of having masses said, not for the repose of his soul, but for\r\nthe prompt return of his person;[173] and these persistent doubts\r\nhave caused Beaufort to be included, like Monmouth, among those\r\nin whom people have beheld the mysterious prisoner of the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite.\r\n\r\nBut these are the only points of resemblance between Charles II.’s\r\nnatural son and Henri IV.’s grandson. Their characters, their\r\nadventures, and their persons afford the most complete contrast, and\r\nthese two idols of the English and French peoples have owed their equal\r\npopularity to entirely opposite qualities.\r\n\r\nBrought up in the country, in the most absolute ignorance, and having\r\ndevoted his early years exclusively to the rude exercises of the\r\nchase, Beaufort, during the whole of his life, retained from this\r\neducation of nature a coarse impress which made him the most really\r\noriginal personage of the courts of Anne of Austria and of Louis XIV.\r\nWhen, at the close of Louis XIII.’s reign, he appeared at the Louvre,\r\nin that court which was as yet far from being the most polished of\r\nEurope, he was not long in shocking even the least squeamish, and in\r\nopposing himself to the most legitimate requirements. His athletic\r\nstrength, of which he willingly made a display, his characteristic and\r\nexpressive features, the intemperate animation of his gestures, his\r\naffected habit of always keeping his hand on his hip, the tone of his\r\nvoice, everything to his moustaches even, curled up out of bravado,\r\ncontributed to give him the most provoking appearance. The rusticity\r\nof his manners was equalled only by the coarseness of his speech. He\r\nhad not even received the usual education of the middle classes; and\r\nwanting sufficient discernment to compensate by observation for his\r\ncomplete ignorance, he would, when speaking, mix up in the strangest\r\nmanner possible hunting terms, which were very familiar to him,\r\nwith court expressions, which he used without hardly understanding\r\nthem.[174] Cynical by habit, affected through a desire of imitating\r\nothers, he had formed for himself a language “which,” the Cardinal de\r\nRetz says, “would have spoilt even Cato’s good sense.”[175] This jargon\r\nended by rendering ridiculous one whose appearance alone was already\r\ndispleasing. But he took his revenge in the army, where these defects\r\nwere less apparent, and where he had opportunities for displaying his\r\nmanly qualities. Careless of every danger, and even of a reckless\r\ncourage, capable of enduring the most excessive fatigue, familiar with\r\nall the exercises of the body, he ceased to make people laugh at him,\r\nexcited their admiration at the sieges of Corbie, Hesdin, and Arras,\r\nand when he returned to the court, was preceded by a reputation for\r\nbravery which rallied around him a portion of his detractors. People\r\nshut their eyes to his eccentricities, and were better disposed to\r\nappreciate his manly frankness and probity. Accordingly, when, on the\r\neve of Louis XIII.’s death, Anne of Austria was afraid lest the Duke\r\nd’Orléans or the Prince de Condé should have the Dauphin and the Duke\r\nd’Anjou carried off, it was to the custody of Beaufort, as “the most\r\nhonest man in France,”[176] that she confided her two sons.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first proud of this flattering mark of distinction, he was\r\nnot long in forgetting it, and in throwing himself very thoughtlessly\r\ninto the enterprises of the Fronde, in which he made a sad enough\r\nfigure. Enticed by the Duchess de Montbazon to join the cabal of the\r\n_Importants_,[177] brutal in his behaviour towards Mazarin, next\r\nimprisoned at Vincennes,[178] allied with the Prince de Condé after\r\nhaving been the enemy of his sister, the Duchess de Longueville, a\r\nfurious opponent of the court after having shown himself the guardian\r\nof the throne and the protector of the Regent, by turns at the service\r\nof the narrow passions and beggarly interests of the Dukes d’Elbœuf and\r\nde Bouillon, of the Marshal de la Motte, and of the Cardinal de Retz,\r\nwithout exactly knowing either for what cause he was fighting or what\r\naim he was pursuing, Beaufort withdrew from the Fronde as carelessly\r\nas he had joined it, and became reconciled to the court with as little\r\ngain to himself as he had obtained from the Frondeurs by his alliance\r\nwith them. To an incapacity for discerning what path he ought to\r\npursue in the midst of contending parties, Beaufort joined a dangerous\r\nignorance of his political nonentity, and like many persons who are\r\nwanting in judgment, he endeavoured to rule by the force of qualities\r\nin which he was most deficient. As vain as he was thoughtless,\r\nbelieving himself called upon to play a great part,[179] he imagined\r\nthat he had an aptitude for public business, because he could talk its\r\ncant; he delighted in giving advice to those who were leading him as\r\nthey chose; and, wronging his real qualities by those which he wished\r\nto affect, he ended by exercising influence only over the multitude;\r\nbut with them he succeeded perfectly. If, in order to please one’s\r\nsubjects, it is necessary to speak their language, share their tastes,\r\nadopt their manners, to be by turns abrupt and familiar, uncouth and\r\nhaughty, nobody has deserved more than Beaufort to be the “King of the\r\n_halles_.” This title, which history has confirmed, his contemporaries\r\ndecreed to him unanimously, and the people accepted with enthusiasm. In\r\nthe streets they followed with love this good prince who had consented\r\nto come and live near them in the most populous quarter, whose light\r\nhair and martial bearing the women admired, and who did not disdain\r\noccasionally to descant to the populace from a post, and sometimes to\r\ndisplay his strength in street quarrels.\r\n\r\nBut when Louis XIV. attained his majority, this king of the populace\r\nbecame the most submissive of his subjects. Lagrange-Chancel, in order\r\nto establish the theory which makes the Duke de Beaufort the Man with\r\nthe Iron Mask, and explain his pretended detention at Pignerol, speaks\r\n“of his turbulent spirit, of the _rôle_ he had played in all the party\r\nmovements of the time of the Fronde.”[180] He adds that “his office of\r\nHigh Admiral placed him daily in a position to thwart the great designs\r\nof Colbert, charged with the department of the Marine.” Nothing can\r\nbe less exact, and in 1663, when Beaufort became High Admiral, the\r\npassions, kindled during the Fronde, were extinguished, the ambitious\r\nsatisfied or quelled. The most turbulent chiefs, such as Rochefoucauld,\r\nwere plunged in an idleness which was scarcely menacing. Those who had\r\nbeen the most hostile then made a display of their submission and\r\nservility. Whilst the Cardinal de Retz, in retirement at Commercy, was\r\nmaking up for his inaction and want of power by writing his immortal\r\nMemoirs, the Prince de Conti was espousing the niece of Mazarin, and\r\nCondé was gratefully receiving the order of the Holy Ghost from the\r\nKing.[181] The most indocile and most arrogant of the nobility, who\r\nhad disturbed the Regent’s authority, constrained the court to leave\r\nParis, sent away Mazarin, and agitated the whole kingdom, now crowded\r\nthe ante-chambers of Louis XIV. and disputed the signal honour of being\r\npresent when he retired to bed, and of holding a candlestick on the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nBeaufort was not the least assiduous in giving satisfaction to the\r\nabsolute monarch. Little formed for command, for which an extreme\r\nimpetuosity rendered him unsuited, he received very humbly the\r\nsevere reprimands of Louis XIV. and Colbert, and supported the yoke\r\nof the master as docilely as he was harsh and imperious to his own\r\nofficers.[182] If he was always menacing the latter with ill-treatment\r\nand with having them thrown into the sea, he submitted, in his naval\r\nexpeditions, to the control and almost to the rule of the Intendant\r\nplaced at his side by Colbert.[183] Nothing in him, then, was\r\ndangerous to the court: neither his character, for his subordinates\r\nalone experienced its violence; nor his talents, which were almost\r\nnugatory; nor his pretensions, which had become very much reduced;\r\nnor his popularity, which scarcely extended beyond the boundaries of\r\nhis kingdom of the _halles_. More than that, he had, in the eyes of\r\nthe King, the merit of belonging, through his father,[184] to those\r\nillegitimate princes whom Louis XIV. was constantly to favour--at\r\nfirst from political interest, with the view of opposing them to the\r\nlegitimate heirs of the great families; then from paternal affection,\r\nwhen his own _amours_ had quickly increased their number--and to whom,\r\nfrom a pride more and more immoderate, he was to accord successively\r\nprecedence over the peers, then the rank of royal princes, and, lastly,\r\nto the shame of the whole kingdom, rights to the throne of France. One\r\ncannot understand, then, for what motive Louis XIV. would have sought\r\nto have got rid of a prince too unimportant to excite his jealousy, too\r\nsubmissive for a revolt to be feared from him, and who, the son of a\r\nbastard, was preparing for and justifying by his example the early and\r\nmore and more scandalous elevation of the illegitimate offspring of the\r\ngreat King.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the expedition to Candia, whither, according to\r\nLagrange-Chancel, and those who share his opinion,[185] Beaufort was\r\nsent in order that he might be carried off and afterwards condemned\r\nto perpetual imprisonment, was there any act in the Admiral’s naval\r\ncareer, by which he had entered into a state of rebellion against the\r\ncourt? Was there anything of the kind in the expedition of 1664, when,\r\nin spite of the opinions of his lieutenants, some of whom wished\r\nto attack Bona first, others Boujeiah,[186] Beaufort, adhering too\r\nstrictly to Louis XIV.’s detailed instructions, directed an attack on\r\nGigery, of which he possessed himself prematurely, and compromised\r\nthe results of the campaign by a scrupulous obedience to orders given\r\nat a distance, and which he ought to have been bold enough to have\r\ndisregarded? Was there anything in 1666, when he was charged to command\r\nthe escort of the new Queen of Portugal,[187] and when, in spite of\r\nhis ardour and of a noble desire to hasten to an encounter with the\r\nEnglish, he agreed, so as to obey orders, to remain immovable in the\r\nwaters of the Tagus?\r\n\r\nBut let us admit that the cause of this imprisonment, sought for in\r\nvain, can never be known to us, or rather, that the humble deference\r\ndisplayed by Beaufort towards Louis XIV. had not destroyed in the mind\r\nof the latter the remembrance of the violent passion which made the\r\nAdmiral so ungovernable in his behaviour towards his officers. Let\r\nus admit an imaginary crime in order to explain an abduction which\r\nthere is nothing positive to justify. Then the precautions taken\r\nafter the abduction would be explained to a certain extent, by the\r\npopularity which Beaufort enjoyed at Paris, and Saint-Foix, in refuting\r\nLagrange-Chancel, has been too positive in affirming the contrary.\r\n\r\n“The King’s authority was consolidated,” he says,[188] “and the\r\nimprisonment of the great Condé himself, if it had been considered\r\nnecessary to have had him arrested, would not have caused the least\r\ndisturbance.” Assuredly, but would things have been the same for the\r\n“King of the _halles_,” whom the people still thoroughly idolized?\r\n\r\nThis only of Lagrange’s numerous arguments being admitted, and the\r\nnecessity of hiding Beaufort from the gaze of all being recognized,\r\nwould his abduction have been possible at Candia, in the midst of the\r\nfleet and in the presence of the army? What were the causes of this\r\nexpedition, and among them can we detect a desire on the part of the\r\nKing to send Beaufort with it, in order to get rid of him afterwards?\r\nLastly, was this individual, who all the accounts agree in saying\r\nhad _disappeared_--was he in reality _killed_, and can we invoke\r\nperfectly conclusive proofs of his death? This is what it is essential\r\nto examine. Contemporary criticism has, up to the present, refuted\r\nthe opinion which we are combating, by availing itself only of the\r\ncorrespondence of Louvois with Saint-Mars,[189] and by showing that\r\nnot a line of these despatches permits us to believe that Beaufort was\r\ndetained at Pignerol. Let us push the demonstration still further,\r\nand as we have attempted with regard to the hypothesis of a brother\r\nof Louis XIV., and with regard to Vermandois and Monmouth, do not let\r\nus content ourselves with this indirect proof; since, to the silence\r\npreserved by Saint-Mars and Louvois with reference to each of these\r\nindividuals, sceptics could bring forward as objections the suppression\r\nof the despatches concerning them or the exclusive employment of\r\nverbal messages. This is why, instead of invoking the usual argument\r\nfounded upon an examination of the despatches between the gaoler and\r\nthe Minister, we have availed ourselves of it merely in a subsidiary\r\nmanner, and only after having previously sought to establish that\r\na mysterious brother of Louis XIV. never existed, that Vermandois\r\nsuccumbed before Courtray, and that Monmouth died on the scaffold. This\r\ndouble demonstration has appeared indispensable to us in a matter where\r\nevery one, having held a favourite opinion for a long time, is little\r\ndisposed to accept another tending to upset it: so let us try the\r\nmethod for Beaufort in his turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[173] “Several persons here wish to wager,” wrote Guy-Patin, September\r\n26, 1669, “that M. de Beaufort is not dead. _O utinam!_” And in another\r\nletter, January 14, 1670: “It is said that M. de Vivonne has, by\r\ncommission, the office of Vice-Admiral of France for twenty years; but\r\nthere are still those who insist that M. de Beaufort is not dead, and\r\nthat he is only a prisoner.”\r\n\r\n[174] _Mémoires de la Duchesse de Nemours_, vol. xxxiv.; _Mémoires\r\nde Brienne_, and of Conrat, Montglat, and of La Rochefoucauld. “He\r\nformed,” says the Duchess de Nemours, “a kind of jargon of words\r\nso vulgar or so badly arranged, that it rendered him ridiculous to\r\neverybody, although these words, which he arranged so badly, would\r\nperhaps have appeared very good if he had known how to have arranged\r\nthem better, being bad only in the places where he put them.”\r\n\r\n[175] _Mémoires du Cardinal de Retz_, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[176] It was thus that she then designated him.\r\n\r\n[177] The Queen’s party.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[178] He was imprisoned there in 1645, and escaped in 1649. It was\r\nreferring to this escape that Condé, incarcerated in his turn at\r\nVincennes, on being recommended the _Imitation of Jesus Christ_\r\nin order to beguile his captivity, answered that he preferred the\r\n_Imitation of the Duke de Beaufort_.\r\n\r\n[179] It is known that he one day asked President Bellièvre if he would\r\nnot change the face of affairs by giving a box on the ears to the Duke\r\nd’Elbœuf? “I do not think,” answered the magistrate, in a grave tone,\r\n“that would change anything except the face of the Duke d’Elbœuf.”\r\n\r\n[180] _Année Littéraire_: Letter of Lagrange-Chancel to M.

It is said[190] “that public opinion in France, having\r\nreceived the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle badly, the army especially\r\ncomplaining of it, Louis XIV. and Louvois eagerly seized the\r\nopportunity of diverting this unquiet zeal, of making this flame burn\r\nout, and that they willingly allowed themselves to be persuaded by\r\nthe Nuncio and the Venetian Ambassador to send assistance to Candia,\r\nmenaced by the Turks.” To this consideration, which certainly was of\r\ngreat weight, it is necessary to add the influence of a court intrigue,\r\nand to explain the very particular motives which Louis XIV. had for\r\npleasing the Pope.\r\n\r\nLouvois having succeeded in causing his brother, Le Tellier, to be\r\nappointed to the coadjutorship of Rheims, in preference to the Duke\r\nd’Albret, nephew of Turenne, and the illustrious Marshal, not having\r\nbeen more successful in getting his relation named coadjutor of the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, Louis XIV., to appease his resentment, promised\r\nthe young abbé a cardinal’s hat. Madame de Montespan, related to the\r\nd’Albret family, and already all-powerful, exerted herself with all her\r\ninfluence to hasten the fulfilment of this promise. On the other hand,\r\nthe Prince d’Awersberg, one of the principal ministers of Leopold, had\r\nreceived from Grémonville, the French Ambassador, the assurance of\r\nLouis XIV.’s support to obtain from Clement IX. a cardinal’s hat, in\r\nreturn for his assiduity in serving near the Emperor the interests of\r\nthe King in the great affair of the treaty for the partition of the\r\nSpanish monarchy, signed secretly in 1668. The Pope knew how to turn\r\nthis double demand to his own profit.[191] He enlarged greatly upon\r\nhis extreme desire to satisfy the Most Christian King, but also upon\r\nhis fears of irritating the other Catholic nations by a preference\r\nwhich would be insulting to them. He alleged the necessity which then\r\nexisted for him not to render any Power discontented, and for causing\r\nthem all to be united in repelling the common enemy of Christianity.\r\n“Thus, Monseigneur,” wrote our envoy at Rome to De Lionne, “your\r\nExcellency will very easily perceive that if I had something positive\r\nto say as to what his Majesty has resolved to do with reference to the\r\naffairs of Candia during next season, I should meet with more facility\r\nhere for the advancement of the promotion.”[192] That the piety and\r\nreligious sentiments of Louis XIV. may have counted for something in\r\nhis resolution to send troops to Candia to fight against the Turks,\r\nis possible. That he may have been determined by the necessity of\r\noffering glorious amends to the army, discontented at the peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, can certainly not be denied. But, nevertheless, one\r\nmust not overlook the influence which would have been exercised upon\r\nLouis XIV.’s decision by the certainty of satisfying the Pope in so\r\ntender a point, and by being able at one and the same time to keep his\r\nengagements towards the Minister of the Empire, content Turenne, and\r\nplease Madame de Montespan. In any case it is impossible to reckon\r\namong these numerous causes a pretended desire to get rid of Beaufort,\r\nand there is no need to invoke so unlikely a motive, while so many\r\npositive grounds exist to explain this expedition.\r\n\r\nThe Duke de Beaufort was naturally chosen to command it.[193] In\r\nspite of his violence of character, everything called him to it; his\r\nbirth, his rank of High Admiral, the commands which he had already\r\nheld in several naval expeditions, and a certain aptitude which he\r\npossessed for the sailor’s rude and perilous calling. Under his orders,\r\nRochechouart, Count de Vivonne, had the direction of the galleys, and\r\nthe Duke de Navailles was the commander of the landing forces. These\r\ntroops were 7,000[194] in number, and were officered by the _élite_ of\r\nthe nobility,[195] who made it a duty of chivalry to serve against the\r\ninfidel. It was in some sort a new crusade, and, if it excited less\r\nenthusiasm than when people undertook to deliver the tomb of Christ,\r\nif the powerful lever of a robust faith, which had formerly raised up\r\nentire nations, had long since become weakened, French audacity and\r\nvalour found a certain romantic attraction in a distant expedition,\r\ndirected against a country and an adversary equally unknown.\r\n\r\nIn a few days collections, organized throughout the kingdom, had met\r\nthe expenses of fitting out the expedition; and June 5, 1669, the\r\nfleet left Toulon during the finest possible weather, which lasted the\r\nwhole of the voyage, and rendered it extraordinarily quick. Composed\r\nof twenty-two vessels of the line and of three _galiotes_,[196] the\r\nfleet joined, on the 17th, fourteen Venetian boats charged with\r\nhorses, near Cape Sapienza, off the point of the Morea. On the 19th,\r\nat five o’clock in the morning, the western extremity of the Isle of\r\nCandia was sighted. At the head of the squadron sailed the flag-ship\r\n_Le Monarque_, its poop covered with brilliantly-gilt carvings by\r\nPuget, and at its mast-head the papal standard, richly embroidered\r\nwith the arms of the Holy See. At the sight of the land, which was in\r\npossession of the Turks, ensigns of a thousand colours were displayed\r\non _Le Monarque_. Every other vessel in its turn immediately joined in\r\nthis proud salute. The French cannon burst forth, the Turkish batteries\r\nreplied to it from the port of Canea, and, amidst the uproar of this\r\ninoffensive discharge, amidst the resplendent gleams of the rising sun,\r\nthe fleet passed majestically before the enemy; and, doubling the point\r\nof the island, directed its course towards the capital, which it had\r\ncome to defend.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, as it approached, the delightful spectacle of fertile\r\nmeadows bounded afar off by green wooded hills, which but lately had\r\nbeen offered to the sight, became changed to a picture of desolation\r\nand mourning. During several years the Turks, commanded by the Grand\r\nVizier Mahomet-Kioprili, had little by little taken possession of\r\nthe entire island, with the exception of the principal town, which\r\nthe Venetians were holding by desperate efforts against an enemy\r\nthat unceasingly recruited its losses, and advanced slowly but with\r\nindefatigable tenacity. The French fleet, continuing its course, sees\r\nbefore it a country bearing traces of long and cruel devastation.\r\nThe mountains shorn of their forests to meet the necessities of war,\r\npresent their bare and ravaged sides to the view. The soil is untilled\r\nand arid. Beside immense quarries rise lofty engines for throwing\r\nstones upon the besieged. To the deep silence of these solitudes\r\nsucceeds the reverberations of artillery, whose detonations, at first\r\nconfused, soon become quite distinct. At times a flash of reddish\r\nflames is suddenly perceived,--it is an advanced work blown up by\r\na mine; at others a shell rapidly traverses the air, and, perhaps,\r\nlights upon and destroys a building of the town. At last, just as\r\nthe soldiers, crowded upon the decks, reach the end of their voyage,\r\ntheir attentive looks discern the camp of the Turks, surmounted by\r\nwaving banners and protected by breastworks, sandy spots where the\r\ncavalry are exercising, vast stores of arms, machinery at work, wounded\r\nbeing carried on litters, a formidable army in a state of commotion,\r\nanimation, movement, and life; and, in the background, standing out\r\nfrom the horizon, the ramparts of Candia overlooked by its silent\r\nsteeples, its almost deserted towers, with here and there some domes\r\nwhich glitter in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe evening following their arrival, Beaufort, Navailles, and the\r\ngeneral officers, cautiously left the roadstead where the squadron had\r\ncast anchor, and in a little row-boat, with carefully muffled oars,\r\nsucceeded in eluding the vigilance of the Turks, and in penetrating\r\ninto the port of the besieged town.[197] Their disappointment on\r\narriving there was extreme; and after having been witnesses, during\r\nthe day, of the energy and vigour displayed by the besiegers, they\r\nconvinced themselves, during the evening, of the dejection and\r\nimpotence of the defenders of Candia. Whilst the Ambassador of\r\nthe Venetian Republic had affirmed at Versailles that their number\r\nstill amounted to 14,000 men, it was, in reality, reduced to 6,000\r\ncombatants, who, discouraged and ill, considered the loss of the\r\ntown as inevitable, and continued to fight through duty, but without\r\nhope.[198] The gunners had nearly all perished in the subterranean\r\ngalleries, where the Turks had pursued them with the implacability\r\nof fanaticism. Of the two principal bastions of the place, one,\r\nthe Bastion Saint-Andrew, was already in the power of the enemy;\r\nand the Venetians were too weak to preserve the other--that of the\r\nSablonnière--much longer. The streets, blocked up with rubbish,\r\nscarcely afforded a passage for the troops. Here and there smoking\r\nruins, in the midst of an open space, bore witness to a recent fire.\r\nFar apart were houses, their upper stories turned into casemates,\r\nand looking like isolated citadels, where the unhappy inhabitants\r\nhad crowded to take refuge. In the open places were to be seen a few\r\nsoldiers pacing up and down in silence, or perhaps some wounded being\r\ncarried from the trenches and accompanied by a priest. Everywhere were\r\nthe certain signs of utter discouragement and of approaching defeat.\r\n\r\n“The universal opinion is that the town can only be succoured by a\r\ngeneral engagement,” wrote the Intendant Delacroix to France.[199]\r\nHe expressed the opinion of the Council, which had assembled on the\r\n20th at Candia. This was unanimous; and Saint-André-Montbrun,[200]\r\nBeaufort, Morosini (the captain-general of the Venetians), as well as\r\nNavailles, saw some chances of success only in a vigorous sortie from\r\nthe side of the Sablonnière. There, in truth, a portion of the Turks\r\nwere separated from their principal army, and exposed to the cross-fire\r\nof the town and fleet, and ran, moreover, the danger of being driven\r\ninto the sea, which was close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe definitive plan of attack was determined on in a final Council\r\nof War, held on the 24th, at seven o’clock in the evening, and its\r\nexecution fixed for the middle of the following night. Beaufort\r\nassembled on board his ship all the captains of the army; and the\r\ndisembarkation of troops, which commenced at nine o’clock in large and\r\nstrong launches, was finished, without impediment, by midnight.[201] As\r\neach company disembarked, it proceeded to the esplanade situated by the\r\nside of the bastion of the Sablonnière. Surprise being the principal\r\ncondition of success, the officers gave their orders in a low voice,\r\nand the soldiers advanced, with many precautions. The troops of Candia\r\nnot on duty in the bastions were only informed of the plan of attack at\r\none in the morning by their chiefs, who came to awake them, and lead\r\nthem to their post. When the clock of the church of Saint-Mark struck\r\ntwo, the foot-soldiers were all assembled on the esplanade.[202]\r\nIn spite of their number, nothing save the pale reflection of their\r\nmuskets betrayed their presence. Immovable and silent, they awaited\r\nthe signal of departure; and on this calm and peaceful night, which\r\nwas about to be marked by a bloody struggle, one heard as yet only the\r\nregular and monotonous footsteps of the sentinels on the ramparts.\r\nSoon the dull trot of horses advancing over the sand is joined to\r\nit. Two hundred of the King’s musketeers and five companies of\r\ncavalry have come to reinforce the infantry, and are followed by\r\nBeaufort, Navailles, and a numerous staff. After having given the\r\ncountersign,[203] and confided his young nephew, the Chevalier de\r\nVendôme, to the watchful care of the Marquis de Schomberg and the Baron\r\nde Saint-Mark, charged to follow him everywhere in the fight,[204]\r\nBeaufort addresses a few brave and energetic words, to those about\r\nhim,[205] and the command is given to advance in silence. The soldiers\r\nplaced under De Navailles’ orders went towards the right. Beaufort was\r\nto occupy the left with a large portion of the marines and with his\r\nguards, commanded by Colbert de Maulevrier, the Minister’s brother. It\r\nwas arranged that the two divisions should reunite at a signal to be\r\ngiven by that of Navailles.[206]\r\n\r\nArrived at a point very near to the Turks, Beaufort’s troops, in order\r\nto wait till the night should be less obscure, and to give Navailles,\r\nwho had a longer distance to traverse, time to reach the designated\r\nspot, lay down on their stomachs, admiral, soldiers, and officers--the\r\nlatter occupying themselves only with the concealing of the links,\r\nand with recommending, in a low voice, the most minute precautions.\r\nThree-quarters of an hour before daybreak the drums of the Turks were\r\nheard. Some sailors, at Beaufort’s orders, approached the Turkish\r\ncamp by crawling; and, returning in the same manner, brought the\r\nintelligence that it was only the usual _réveillée_ which had just been\r\nbeaten, and that the enemy were in complete ignorance of the danger\r\nwhich menaced them.[207] The troops remained extended on the ground,\r\nsilent and motionless, and Beaufort listened attentively to catch the\r\nsignal indicating that Navailles’ division had commenced the attack.\r\n\r\nThis general had arrived with the same good luck at the extreme right.\r\nAfter having been joined there by his reserve and his rearguard, he\r\nsent the former, commanded by the Count de Choiseul, a little to the\r\nwestward of Candia, so as to prevent any communication between the two\r\nTurkish camps, and kept his rearguard with him, in order to protect the\r\nmost threatened points. Then he led forward Dampierre’s corps, charged\r\nto commence the attack, and creeping towards a little hill, which\r\nafforded him a good view, he awaited the result.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Beaufort, although sure of the quietude and inaction of the\r\nTurks, was with difficulty restraining his fiery impatience, when,\r\nhalf an hour before dawn, he heard at the extreme right a deafening\r\ndischarge of musketry. Immediately he arose, and all his troops with\r\nhim, ordered a salute to be beaten and the charge sounded, and\r\nspringing to the head of the first battalion, cleared the entrenchment\r\nwhich defended the Turkish camp. Colbert, followed by the company of\r\nGuards, rushed towards the left, with the intention of surrounding the\r\nadversary. With equal impetuosity they all traversed a ravine which\r\nthey encountered in the rear of the entrenchment, and without suffering\r\nthemselves to be checked in their onslaught by the stony nature of\r\nthe soil, carried at the first attack the trenches of the enemy, who\r\nabandoned them after having fired off their arms. The surprise and\r\nfright of the Turks were extreme. They fled in disorder, pell-mell;\r\nand many of those who escaped Beaufort threw themselves into the\r\nsea, pursued by Dampierre’s troops. All at once, towards the right,\r\nan immense flash of fire was seen, and a fearful explosion shook the\r\nground. The soldiers and sailors surrounding Beaufort stopped suddenly;\r\nbut he, without appearing alarmed by this noise, the cause of which he\r\ndid not know, exclaimed, “Courage, children! courage! Since they spring\r\na mine in our front, it is a sign that they are flying.” He succeeded\r\nfor a moment in overcoming the terror of his troops, and even prevailed\r\non them to advance a few paces.[208] But on the detachment commanded\r\nby Dampierre the effects of this terrible catastrophe were something\r\nvery different. Caused by the explosion of a magazine, containing\r\ntwenty-five tons of powder, which had been set alight through the\r\nimprudence of a musketeer, it had destroyed an entire battalion of\r\nFrench Guards, and had produced everywhere an unspeakable terror. The\r\ntroops were persuaded that the enemy had undermined the whole of their\r\nworks, and that the ground they were marching over was about to open\r\nunder their feet. From point to point did this belief spread, until the\r\nterrified soldiers threw away their arms and fled with precipitation.\r\nIt was in vain that Navailles, Dampierre, and the other general\r\nofficers endeavoured to restrain them. The panic became universal, and\r\nthe shameful and dreadful cry of “_Sauve qui peut!_” resounded from\r\nall parts. This disorder was increased still more by an error which\r\neven the obscurity of the night can scarcely explain. The fugitives,\r\nmeeting Beaufort’s sailors, threw themselves upon them as enemies.\r\nThe long garments of seven or eight Armenians who were at their head,\r\ncontributed, it seems, to confirm a fatal mistake.[209] In this\r\nhorrible _mêlée_ no one recognized any one else, and fellow-countrymen\r\nkilled one another in the belief that they were slaying the infidels.\r\nBeaufort, utterly abandoned, endeavoured to correct this disastrous\r\nerror.[210] On his wounded horse, covered with blood and with his\r\nclothes rent, he threw himself into the midst of the agitated groups,\r\nexclaiming, “To me, my children! I am your admiral. Rally around\r\nme!”[211] Heroic, but unavailing efforts! Supreme appeal of a voice\r\ntill then so dear, but now unrecognized--a voice which had just\r\nuttered its last words! The bewildered soldiers remained insensible to\r\nthese generous supplications, and it was only when daylight began to\r\nillumine this field of carnage that the confusion ceased with the cause\r\nwhich had produced it. But then the Turks, who had had time to recover\r\ntheir courage, and who proved themselves as prompt in rallying as they\r\nhad been alert in taking to flight, rushed on, shouting the name of\r\nthe Prophet, and with irresistible impetuosity became in their turn\r\nassailants, and pursued the French to the very gates of Candia.[212]\r\n\r\nWhen, under the shelter of the ramparts, an account was taken of the\r\nloss, and after the wounded who had managed to reach the town had\r\nbeen examined, Beaufort’s absence was perceived. Those who explain\r\nthis absence by an abduction which Colbert, his enemy, had ordered,\r\ndo not fail to note the presence of the Minister’s brother, Colbert\r\nde Maulevrier, by the side of Beaufort during the battle, and they\r\nsee in the commandant of the Guards the executioner of the Minister’s\r\nvengeance. But how can this singular belief be held, when a letter\r\nfrom Maulevrier to his brother, the first which he wrote to him after\r\nthe battle, far from giving the Minister an account of Beaufort’s\r\nabduction, contains these words:[213]--“The unhappy fate of M. l’Amiral\r\nis the most deplorable thing in the world. As I was obliged to go\r\nbackwards and forwards during the whole time that the attack lasted,\r\nin order to assemble what I could of the troops, there was no one of\r\nwhom I did not make inquiries respecting him,[214] and not one could\r\never tell me anything of him.” It is true that these words, if they\r\ndestroy the supposition of an abduction ordered by Colbert, may still\r\nallow it to be supposed that Beaufort was a prisoner of the Turks.\r\nBut the laconism of this portion of the letter is accounted for when\r\none discovers from the remainder of it that the writer was suffering\r\nfrom his wounds, worn-out with fatigue, and solely preoccupied with\r\nhis restoration to health. It is true again that Navailles, in his\r\ndespatch, makes use of the word _perte_,[215] applicable equally to\r\nthe death of the Admiral and to the hypothesis that he was a prisoner\r\nin the hands of the Turks. But how can a single doubt remain when the\r\naccount addressed to the Minister of Marine states that the Chevalier\r\nde Flacourt, having been sent to the Turkish camp with a flag of\r\ntruce, for the purpose of making inquiries respecting the Admiral,\r\nlearned that he was not among the prisoners;[216] and when a report\r\naddressed to Colbert on the 27th, not by a sick man, deprived of news,\r\nbut by a witness in a position to know everything, infers that the\r\nAdmiral was dead?[217] How can one have any further doubts, above\r\nall, when the circumstances just related, and the courage displayed\r\nby this bold adventurer, render this end so probable? That the age\r\nof Beaufort, born in 1616, which would make the mysterious corpse\r\nof 1703 a nonagenarian, almost suffices to overthrow the system of\r\nLagrange-Chancel and Langlet-Dufresnoy, is incontestable. But this\r\nproof not having appeared sufficiently decisive to these writers, it\r\nbecame essential to seek for every kind of testimony, in order, so far\r\nas was just, to restore to this grandson of Henri IV. the glory of\r\nhaving died with arms in his hand on the field of battle, and of having\r\nthus crowned a life of adventures by an end worthy of his valour, his\r\nrace, and his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[190] M.

[The\r\nbiographies of the Duke de Beaufort say it was commonly believed at the\r\ntime that, according to the barbarous custom of the Turks, his dead\r\nbody was beheaded by them, which would account for its not having been\r\nfound on the field of battle.--See _Biographie Universelle_ of Michaud,\r\n&c.--_Trans._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n General Considerations on the Abduction of the Armenian Patriarch\r\n Avedick--Despatch of the Marquis de Ferriol to Constantinople as\r\n Ambassador--Difficulties peculiar to this Post--Incautious Conduct\r\n of some of Ferriol’s Predecessors--Quiclet’s Adventures--Portrait\r\n of Ferriol--His Pretensions at Constantinople--His Eccentricity of\r\n Manner--His Behaviour in Religious Matters--The Armenian Church--Short\r\n Account of its History--Ardent Desire of the Catholic Missionaries to\r\n make Converts--Their Imprudence--Ferriol at first attempts to repair\r\n it--Obstinate Resistance of Father Braconnier, a Jesuit--Encroachments\r\n and Requirements of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the story of a most audacious violation of the law of\r\nnations, conceived by the fanaticism of an ambassador, ventured upon in\r\na friendly country, with a singular boldness and energy, accomplished\r\nby stratagem and imposture, and thus kept from the knowledge of an\r\nentire people. The high rank of the victim, the character of the\r\nmeans employed, the ardour of the passions then excited, give an\r\nespecial importance to this act of violence, which was crowned by a\r\n_dénoûment_ as startling as up to the present it was little known.\r\nPeople were aware that an Armenian Patriarch, who combined with his\r\ncivil power enormous religious authority, had been carried off from\r\nConstantinople towards the end of Louis XIV.’s reign. But what became\r\nof him afterwards, and what adventures terminated the existence of\r\nthis personage who had been rudely snatched away from his country and\r\nprecipitated from the pinnacle of honour and the highest dignity? Must\r\nwe see in him the mysterious prisoner of the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nas Taulès and the grave German historian Hammer have affirmed?[218]\r\nOr, as others believe, did he rather end his days in the _bagne_ of\r\nMarseilles, or in the obscurity of a prison of Messina, or, more\r\nlikely still, in one of the dungeons of the Inquisition?[219] What\r\nwere the real causes of this extraordinary crime, which almost made\r\nthe Sultan link himself with the numerous enemies of Louis XIV., and\r\nhow did this monarch, vanquished and crushed by a coalition which was\r\nalready formidable, contrive to appease the resentment of the Ottoman\r\nPorte? Such are the points which documents, entirely unpublished and\r\nof indisputable authenticity, will enable us to make clear. And this\r\nwe shall do with the sole desire for truth, and without seeking to\r\nexaggerate or to extenuate the responsibility attaching to the authors\r\nof the crime. The more profound the mystery with which it has been\r\nsurrounded, the more necessary it is to entirely penetrate it, and,\r\nafter so many deeds which justly entitle Louis XIV. to admiration and\r\ngratitude, the more necessary also is it not to leave in obscurity, the\r\nonly one perhaps where he has made use of the worst of violences, that\r\nwhich is aided by lying and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIn 1699, Louis XIV. appointed the Marquis de Ferriol his ambassador at\r\nConstantinople. This post was beset with difficulties. To represent\r\namong Mussulmen a highly Catholic nation; and in a country divided\r\namong several dissenting Churches, to be the natural and appointed\r\nprotector of a very small Latin minority, unceasingly aspiring to\r\nincrease in number, and encouraged in proselytism by ardent and\r\nactive missionaries; to restrain the often thoughtless zeal of these\r\nmissionaries, and, moreover, to prevent this Latin minority from ceding\r\nto the offers of the German Empire and placing themselves under its\r\nprotection;[220] to defend the interests of merchants, more and more\r\nexacting in their demands, often unjust in their complaints,[221] and\r\nwhose encroachments met with opposition not only from the Turks, but\r\nespecially from the English, the Genoese, and the Venetians; to act in\r\nthe name of an extremely haughty monarch near a very touchy Government,\r\nand one still too much isolated and too much aloof from the great\r\nenterprises of Europe for it to give Louis XIV. credit for the as\r\nyet continued success of his arms and the brilliancy of his reign; to\r\nmaintain the misunderstanding between the Germans and the Turks, by\r\ninducing the former to send assistance to the rebellious Hungarians,\r\nand to keep up the resentment of the Porte against the Venetians, but\r\nnevertheless without going to the extremity of causing it to break\r\nout in war; to live in the midst of manners altogether peculiar and\r\nin certain respects always barbarous, to imitate Asiatic luxury, and\r\nto submit to customs[222] which were sometimes extremely onerous; to\r\nassist at frequent and unexpected _révolutions de palais_, which would\r\nin a day upset the policy of the Divan and baffle every project: such\r\nwas then the delicate task of the French ambassadors at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe constant assistance which Louis XIV. had as yet lent to the\r\nenemies of the Turks made the position of his representatives more\r\ndifficult still. One day, when one of them recalled to the Grand\r\nVizier, Kiuproli-Ogli, the old alliance of France and Turkey, and\r\nevoked the recollections of the time of Francis I., “I do not know,”\r\nanswered Kiuproli, “if the French are our allies; but it is certain\r\nthey are invariably to be found among our enemies. There were six\r\nthousand of them at the passage of the Raab. Your Admiral, Beaufort,\r\nattacked Gigery, and made a cruel war on the Moors placed under our\r\nprotection, and you have assisted the Venetians in Candia.” Far\r\nfrom having appeased these very legitimate feelings of resentment,\r\nFerriol’s predecessors had excited them still more by most imprudent\r\nacts. Sometimes, even, they had resorted to violence in order to get\r\nrid of a difficult situation, and had had recourse to those arbitrary\r\nacts of authority, of which the Sultan, it is true, often set them an\r\nexample in his seraglio, but which should have been impossible to the\r\nrepresentatives of a civilized nation.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that La Haye, ambassador at Constantinople in 1659, did\r\nnot scruple to free himself by a crime from an extreme peril in which\r\nhis very equivocal conduct had placed him.[223] France was succouring\r\nCandia, besieged by the Turks. It was an assistance quite natural\r\nand assuredly very praiseworthy; but what was less honourable, the\r\nFrench ambassador carried on with the Venetians a continued secret\r\nintercourse, and, in a cypher correspondence, kept them informed of\r\nall the designs of the Turks. One day the person charged to carry his\r\nmysterious news to the Venetians betrayed him, and, seduced by the bait\r\nof a reward, presented himself to the Caïmacan[224] of Constantinople\r\nand announced that he wished to embrace the Mahometan faith, and to\r\ndeliver to the Grand Vizier himself a packet of letters of great\r\nimportance. The Ottoman Minister, who already had suspicions of this\r\nintercourse, eagerly received the proofs brought to him, but it was\r\nin vain that he tried to decipher them, and neither the interpreters\r\nnor the renegades who swarmed at the Sultan’s court, could penetrate\r\nthe secret of the intercepted letters. In the meanwhile there arrived\r\nat Constantinople a Frenchman, named Quiclet, an adventurer without\r\nresources, who boasted of having acquired by long practice the science\r\nof deciphering letters without a key. Badly received by La Haye, to\r\nwhom he had applied for pecuniary assistance, he had the imprudence to\r\nmenace him with his vengeance, and his wife said to the people of the\r\nembassy, “His Excellency refuses money to my husband, but we know very\r\nwell how to obtain it from the Grand Vizier.” La Haye became alarmed\r\nwhen informed of this speech. He feared lest this wretched intriguer\r\nmight really be able to decipher the despatches, or failing this,\r\nmight, by aid of his imagination, render them more compromising still.\r\nHe grew agitated. He saw his life in danger, and his character as Louis\r\nXIV.’s ambassador at stake. He sends for Quiclet to the embassy, giving\r\nhim hopes of assistance. The latter, as imprudent in his confidence\r\nas he had been thoughtless in his threats, hastens to the palace. La\r\nHaye leads him, while talking, on to a terrace overlooking the embassy\r\ngarden; some servants throw themselves upon him, and others, posted at\r\nthe spot where he falls, kill him and inter him there.[225]\r\n\r\nThis characteristic deed serves as a fitting prologue to the story of\r\nthe not less revolting abuse of force which marked the embassy of\r\nFerriol, who was as unscrupulous as La Haye upon the choice of means,\r\nand whose implacable animosity knew how to strike the most eminent\r\npersonages as well as intriguers of low degree. In truth, every\r\nexpedient appeared to him suitable to be adopted, provided that it was\r\nof a nature to aid him in the accomplishment of his designs; and his\r\nadventurous and agitated past already announced the new ambassador’s\r\nline of conduct.\r\n\r\nIt was by intrigue rather than by his talents that the obscure\r\ngentleman of Dauphiné managed to rise by degrees, and from simple\r\nKing’s musketeer to become ambassador at Constantinople. Compelled to\r\nquit France, in consequence of a love-affair, and Poland, where he had\r\ntaken refuge, because of a violent dispute at a gaming-party,[226]\r\ncompromising the friends who had given him hospitality, but succeeding,\r\nnevertheless, in preserving them as active architects of his fortune,\r\nFerriol went first to Candia to fight against the Turks, and then\r\non their side in Hungary against the Imperialists.[227] Instead of\r\nconfining himself to his military duties, he interfered in matters\r\nof diplomacy, gave an account of them to Louis XIV., gained himself\r\nsupporters in the Turkish camp, and brought his services under the\r\nnotice of the Marquis de Torcy by means of Madame de Ferriol, his\r\nsister-in-law,[228] who possessed great influence over the Minister.\r\nThis was not all. Not content with increasing the number of his\r\nsupporters, he made himself the unjust, passionate, and tenacious\r\nadversary of the Abbé de Châteauneuf, ambassador at Constantinople. As\r\neager to injure him as he was industrious to give himself importance,\r\nhe calumniated the man whose post he coveted, and knew, which appeared\r\ndifficult, how to interest the piety of Louis XIV. in the recall of\r\nan ambassador who was a priest, and whom his enemy accused of an\r\ninclination for the Turkish religion.[229] To gain his ends by means\r\nof an imputation so utterly improbable and so strange was a proof of\r\nextreme cleverness, and was doubtless the reason why he was recompensed\r\nby Louis XIV. sending him to replace the Abbé de Châteauneuf at\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nBut Ferriol showed less ability in the performance of his functions\r\nthan he had displayed in obtaining his post. At a time when the most\r\nprudent moderation was indispensable, he exhibited, from the day of his\r\narrival, the signs of the most fervid impetuosity, which was already\r\na kind of disease in him, and which, becoming more and more exuberant\r\nand excessive, was to degenerate, ten years later, into a species\r\nof insanity. In all countries there are certain distinctions which\r\nPrinces reserve for themselves, and which, for this reason and out of\r\nthe commonest politeness, ambassadors take care not to appropriate. In\r\nSpain, formerly, the Sovereign alone could drive through Madrid in a\r\ncoach drawn by six mules. At Constantinople, the Sultan and the Grand\r\nVizier exclusively enjoyed the privilege of sailing on the waters of\r\nthe Bosphorus in a boat covered by an awning lined with purple.[230]\r\nNeither the Mufti, the other grandees of the Porte, nor any foreign\r\nrepresentative would have dared to have usurped to himself what was\r\nconsidered in Turkey as a peculiar honour. Ferriol refused to submit\r\nhimself to this custom, up to that time respected by every one. But\r\non his first appearance in a caïque similar to the Grand Seignior’s,\r\nthe Bostanji-Bachi[231] ordered a hundred blows with the stick to be\r\ngiven to the _caichis_ who had manned the boat of the vain-glorious\r\nambassador, and caused the latter to be informed that on the occasion\r\nof a second infraction he should fire upon and sink it. Although aware\r\nthat ambassadors ought to present themselves unarmed before the Sultan,\r\nand that, as a matter of favour, a court-sword[232] was sometimes\r\nallowed, Ferriol completely estranged the Turks by attending the\r\nImperial audience armed with a long rapier. He not only had contentions\r\nwith the officers of the Divan, but also with the other ambassadors.\r\nSome French deserters from the German army had aggravated their\r\noffence by going to brave, even in his palace, Count d’Ortinghem, the\r\nrepresentative of the Empire, who had them arrested, less for their\r\ndesertion than to punish their arrogance. Ferriol immediately ordered\r\ntwo officers of the German embassy to be carried off by force. Justly\r\nirritated, D’Ortinghem demanded their release. The two sides armed\r\nthemselves. The subjects of each country were called together. A fight\r\nwas about to stain with blood the streets of Constantinople, and it was\r\nonly the energetic interference of the representative of Holland that\r\nprevented it.[233]\r\n\r\nFor this inflexibility of character, this haughtiness of conduct,\r\nand eccentricity of manners, the pomp and brilliancy of Ferriol’s\r\nreceptions, and his profound knowledge of the country in which he\r\nresided, were not sufficient compensation. Well informed of all\r\nthe affairs of the Levant, he thoughtlessly compromised a precious\r\nexperience by his impetuous decisions and utter absence of all\r\npropriety and decorum. The boldness of certain means attracted more\r\nthan their illegality restrained him. Being entirely ignorant of the\r\nart of gradually smoothing down a difficulty, and, by using time as an\r\nauxiliary, of carefully managing obstacles, he blindly threw himself\r\nupon them, believing himself able to overcome them by a prompt and\r\nhazardous recourse to violence. There still remained in him much of the\r\nadventurous Candia volunteer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in religious matters, Ferriol did not at first show\r\nhimself so audaciously arbitrary as he was afterwards to become. This\r\nman, who subsequently allowed himself to be enticed by the missionaries\r\ninto the most tyrannical and violent resolutions, endeavoured at the\r\ncommencement of his embassy to restrain their imprudent and immoderate\r\nzeal. Everything, moreover, engaged him to it. Everything should have\r\ndetermined him to persevere in this policy of circumspection which the\r\ninstructions received from Louis XIV., the character of the schismatic\r\nArmenians, and the blamable excesses of the Jesuits equally made a\r\nduty to him. “His Majesty orders you,” it had been written to Ferriol,\r\n“to accord to the Jesuit fathers a protection conformable to the zeal\r\nwhich they show for religion, to their disinterestedness, and to the\r\nregularity of their manners.... Nevertheless, you must beware of the\r\ninconsiderate zeal which the missionaries sometimes carry too far;\r\nreligion often suffers more prejudice from imprudent undertakings or\r\nuntimely demands than it acquires real advantages of success.”[234]\r\nWise words, too soon disregarded both by him to whom they were\r\naddressed, and by the Prince in whose name they had been written, and\r\nwhich, singularly prophetic, announced seven years in advance the\r\nmisfortunes which the forgetfulness of this judicious warning was to\r\nbring upon the Catholics.\r\n\r\nNo church deserved more than that of the schismatic Armenians the\r\nemployment of that moderation and prudence so opportunely recommended\r\nby Louis XIV. to his ambassador. Naturally good and peaceable, and of\r\na sociable and kind temper, the Armenians readily became intimate with\r\nstrangers, and had no quarrels with them, except in instances when\r\ntheir own interests were wronged.[235] Long since driven from their\r\nancient kingdom by conquest, or having voluntarily emigrated through\r\nthe necessities of their commerce, they were dispersed over a very\r\nextensive territory, and were encountered in large numbers, not only\r\nin the Turkish Empire and in Persia, but also in Tartary, and even in\r\nPoland. Everywhere they had acquired the reputation of being alike\r\nindustrious and persevering. Eager in pursuit of gain, they excelled\r\nin commerce. Although losing more and more the recollection of their\r\nold country, they carefully preserved the unity of their church, and\r\nremained resolutely attached to their faith. They had adopted the\r\nlanguage of the Turks, their costume,[236] everything in short save\r\nwhat concerned the Armenian religion, to which they showed themselves\r\nscrupulously faithful, and which they respected in every one of its\r\npractices as well as in its doctrines and its spirit. The severities\r\nwhich it imposed upon them did not dishearten them, neither did they\r\nconsider themselves absolved, even by painful journeys, from long and\r\naustere fasts. Their churches were the most decorated and most crowded\r\nof all the East.[237] Their traditions seemed to them so much the\r\nmore deserving of veneration because they were more ancient. Having\r\npreserved their nationality by means of their religion, tenacious and\r\nfertile of resources, they were interesting from their misfortunes, the\r\nfirmness with which they endured them, and their industrious activity.\r\n\r\nFor a century past storms had at distant intervals disturbed their\r\nordinarily peaceable state. These troubles, coming from without, were\r\nnot due, as one might imagine, to the persecutions of the conqueror.\r\nThe Turks, tolerant by nature as well as out of obedience to their\r\nreligion, looked upon all the Christian churches with equal scorn. If\r\nthey interfered in the internal divisions of these churches, it was\r\nbecause they were engaged to do so by complaints, or else to profit\r\nby the voluntary gifts of one of the parties to the controversy.\r\nThe punctual payment of the legal tribute sufficed to assure to a\r\nconquered people not only the free exercise of their religion, but\r\nalso a material and efficacious support for their patriarchs and\r\nbishops.[238] Far from endeavouring to convert its Christian subjects\r\nto Mahometanism, the Divan received with extreme reserve and even\r\ndiscouraged those whom the greed of a reward excited to abandon the\r\nreligion of Christ. Often rigorously exacting in maintaining their\r\npolitical rights, the Mahometans were disdainfully and absolutely\r\nindifferent with respect to the religion of the Christians.[239]\r\nAlthough persuaded of the excellence of Islamism, the Mussulman is\r\naltogether devoid of the spirit of propagandism. In his eyes the\r\ninfidels are not necessarily rejected; since, according to the Koran,\r\n“He who hath said there is only one God, he shall enter into Paradise.”\r\nMoreover, _the number of the elect is fixed from all eternity_, and to\r\nendeavour to increase the number is useless as well as contrary to the\r\ncommands of the sacred book. So they were ignorant of and could not\r\nunderstand that charity, admirable in principle although often carried\r\nto excess, which animated the Catholic missionary, inspiring in him a\r\nsublime abnegation, and determining him to leave his country, to cross\r\ndeserts, to suffer and to die, in order to save a single soul and make\r\nit share in the consolations and hopes of his faith.\r\n\r\nThis ardour of propagandism, so highly beneficial to humanity when it\r\nserves to spread the beautiful morality of the Gospel among nations\r\nwhere it has not yet penetrated, was early made use of by the Holy\r\nSee to cause not only idolaters, but also Christians whom very slight\r\ndifferences in doctrine separated from the Roman communion, to submit\r\nto its spiritual authority. In 1587, Sixtus V., desirous of removing\r\nthese differences, sent the Bishop of Sidon to all the Armenian\r\nchurches; he failed, however, in his attempt.[240] In 1622, there was\r\nfounded at Rome, by Gregory XV., the congregation “for the propagation\r\nof the faith,” to which Urban VIII., his successor, added the College\r\nof the Propaganda, where young men from every part of the world were\r\ninstructed and prepared for their missions. At first they had the\r\nwisdom to pursue in the East methods of kindness and of persuasion,\r\nand by these means succeeded in gaining over a rather large number\r\nof dissenters. But success soon rendered the missionaries bolder, and\r\ntoo confident in the exclusive excellence of their own doctrines, they\r\nsubstituted for the clever circumspection they had hitherto shown,\r\nand the slow but certain influence of a persuasive impressiveness, a\r\nproselytism, ardent, impassioned, and too hasty in arriving at its\r\nends. Instead of assisting dissenters to clear the narrow space which\r\nseparated them from the Roman Church, by showing them how near they\r\nwere to it,[241] instead of rendering prominent all the points which\r\nunited them, they proceeded to attack with ill-timed perseverance\r\nthe questions of liturgy to which the Armenian Church was especially\r\nattached. They forbade the Catholics, under the severest penalties, to\r\nenter other churches, and when they ought, by judicious indulgence, to\r\nhave recognized in the majority of the Armenians brothers separated\r\nby their observances, but in a very slight degree by their doctrines,\r\nthey treated them as enemies and barbarians. Justly irritated by this\r\nviolent conduct, finding themselves subjected to scorn, and menaced in\r\ntheir dearest and most venerated traditions, the schismatics complained\r\nto the Divan, and represented the Jesuits not as envoys of peace, but\r\nas fomenters of discord and as conspirators, so much more dangerous,\r\nbecause they were in the pay of foreign courts.[242]\r\n\r\nFerriol comprehended the imprudent behaviour of the Jesuits, and\r\nattempted to repair it. In 1701 he arranged a reconciliation between\r\nthe principal dissenters and the chiefs of the Catholics, and\r\nsucceeded in moderating the demands of the latter, and in appeasing\r\nthe legitimate resentment of the former. A kind of treaty of union was\r\ndrawn up, which, approved by the Grand Patriarch of Armenia, and by the\r\nCatholic archbishop, was to be submitted afterwards to the ratification\r\nof the Court of Rome, and was to regulate the future relations of the\r\ntwo churches. But the happy effects which would have resulted from\r\nthis transaction were sacrificed by the implacable resistance which\r\nFather Braconnier, superior of the Jesuit mission in the East, opposed\r\nto it.[243] In vain Ferriol observed to him “that they were threatened\r\nwith a general persecution of the Catholics throughout the Turkish\r\nempire; that the Sultan could issue severe orders, which would give a\r\nmortal blow to the religion by reason of the little firmness which the\r\nCatholics possessed, and that a persecution ought to be avoided when\r\nthis could be done without injuring religion and without offending it.”\r\nTo these pressing reasons, inspired by humanity and foresight, Father\r\nBraconnier replied, “that the Church had formerly suffered persecutions\r\nmuch more cruel; that the Armenians ought to know how to suffer; that\r\nhe could not permit the Catholics to have the least communication\r\nwith their schismatic brethren, and that they ought rather to expose\r\nthemselves to the harshest treatment.”[244]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Ferriol had neither sufficient firmness to make his\r\nopinion prevail, nor even perseverance to resolutely maintain it. All\r\nat once abandoning his attempt at reconciliation, he desperately threw\r\nhimself into the party of action much more suitable to his vehement\r\ncharacter, and to his strong liking for contest, and also, we must\r\nadmit, to the delicate position in which the encroachments of Rome\r\nand the requirements of the Jesuits placed him. The ambassador of the\r\nKing of France at Constantinople was then indeed the representative\r\nof the Holy See quite as much as of the court of Versailles, and he\r\nsubmitted to the custom of corresponding regularly either with the\r\nPope or with the principal cardinals. Whilst he rendered account to\r\nLouis XIV. of matters of commerce and of the political situation, the\r\ngreat religious interests formed the subject of periodical despatches\r\naddressed directly to Rome. Very jealous of his authority, Louis XIV.\r\nhad pointed out the inconvenience of this correspondence,[245] then\r\nhe had tolerated it, and, as often happens, the custom had grown\r\ninto an obligation. On the other hand, the Jesuits had more and more\r\nexaggerated the importance of their part, and to the direct influence\r\nwhich the court of Rome exercised upon the French ambassador by its\r\npressing despatches,[246] they added the effects of their constant\r\nrecriminations, of their feverish and turbulent activity, of their\r\naudacious encroachments. Instructing the Holy See according to their\r\nown fancy and inspiring its orders; ruling Ferriol through Versailles\r\nquite as much as through Rome; ready to calumniate him if he ceased\r\nto be their tool, and even powerful enough to overthrow him; present\r\nand influential everywhere, they were in reality the masters of the\r\nsituation, and their responsibility before history is as incontestable\r\nas their power.\r\n\r\nWhile submitting to their yoke, Ferriol sometimes could not prevent\r\nhimself from complaining of it. “All here wish to pass for ministers,”\r\nhe wrote to Torcy. “They believe themselves more enlightened than the\r\nambassadors, and the order of each is reversed. These good fathers, who\r\nought only to go to the convict-prison and the houses of Christians\r\nestablished in the country, do not abstain from visiting persons of\r\npower, and from imposing upon everybody in political affairs. When an\r\nambassador wishes to reduce them within the bounds which seem to be\r\nprescribed for them, they treat him as a man devoid of religion who\r\nsacrifices everything to his ambition.”[247] Assuredly this is the\r\nlanguage of truth, everything proves it. But although these complaints\r\nwere well founded, although the domination of the Jesuits was then real\r\nenough, we cannot feel much concern for this voluntary victim of their\r\nencroachments. Not only, indeed, did Ferriol refrain from endeavouring\r\nto throw off their heavy yoke, although it sometimes weighed on his\r\nself-esteem; but also, forgetting the character with which he was\r\ninvested, and passing from a brief and honourable independence to a\r\nservile devotion, he became the executioner of the vengeance of a\r\nfew missionaries with so much implacability, that in fighting their\r\nadversaries he seemed to be engaging his own personal enemies. His\r\nhatred, revived and cleverly kept up by baleful excitements, is about\r\nto docilely follow the direction indicated to it, and to strike without\r\npity, to pursue without respite, to cause to disappear and overwhelm, a\r\nlong time even after his own fall, a great Armenian personage whom it\r\nis now time to introduce in his turn into this story, and to make known\r\nto our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[218] _L’Homme au Masque de Fer, Mémoire Historique, par le Chevalier\r\nde Taulès, Ancien Consul-général en Syrie_, Paris, 1825.

Quickly becoming\r\nbishop, and then archbishop, he had distinguished himself by his\r\nfirmness, which Ferriol terms impudence, in supporting the interests\r\nof his co-religionists. The commencement of his long struggle with the\r\nFrench ambassador, in which the one showed a becoming loftiness and\r\nthe other an extreme violence, and which was to terminate for Avedick\r\nby a terrible catastrophe, dates from a period earlier than the arrival\r\nof Ferriol as ambassador at Constantinople. The latter being in Hungary\r\nin the Turkish camp, and having heard of some disrespectful speeches\r\nof Avedick with reference to Louis XIV., had used his influence with\r\nthe Grand Vizier to get the daring archbishop exiled.[250] But in\r\nDecember, 1701, the excessive rigour of this punishment was made\r\namends for in a striking manner. The Grand Mufti, Feizoulah Effendi,\r\nnominally charged with spiritual affairs, but who in reality governed\r\nthe entire Ottoman empire, by means of his ascendancy over the Sultan\r\nMustapha II.,[251] was formerly, while at Erzeroum, where he had been\r\nCadi, intimately acquainted with Avedick, like himself an inhabitant of\r\nthis town. Sufficiently powerful to make and overthrow Grand Viziers,\r\nthis chief dignitary of the Mussulman faith was able to create his\r\nfriend “Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople and of Jerusalem.” In vain\r\ndid Ferriol demand from the Grand Chancellor of the empire and from\r\nthe Kiaya of the Grand Vizier the confirmation of Avedick’s exile.\r\nThese two high personages answered the French ambassador[252] that\r\nthe Mufti’s power was supreme, his will in this instance irrevocable,\r\nand that it was as useless to wish to offer opposition to his\r\ndetermination, as any endeavour to shake his credit would be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere remained to Ferriol nothing but submission. But he, as well as\r\nhis ardent inspirers, conceived against the Armenian Patriarch, from\r\nthat period, an implacable resentment, of which we find the proofs in\r\nevery one of his despatches. Time increased this animosity, the effects\r\nof which were not slow in exhibiting themselves. Still at first nothing\r\nin the conduct of the chief of the Armenians justified this enmity. No\r\ndoubt he showed himself less docile with regard to their pretensions\r\nthan the Jesuits would have wished. No doubt he deceived the hope which\r\nthey had conceived of buying him over to their side. But in spite of\r\nthe obstacles raised by Avedick’s co-religionists against the treaty of\r\nunion which Ferriol had proposed, Avedick exhorted them to peace,[253]\r\nand for several years the two Churches maintained the most perfect\r\nconcord. “The liberty allowed the Catholics is so great,” writes\r\nFerriol, May 1, 1703, “that every one admits that they could not enjoy\r\nmore in a Christian country. The reverend Jesuit Fathers at Easter\r\nmade the procession of Sainte-Anne, in the middle of Galata, carrying\r\nthe cross, the banners, and the relics, with an infinite number of\r\nlighted candles and a prodigious assemblage of people. Formerly this\r\nceremony was only performed within the walls of the church.”[254]\r\nInstead of giving Avedick credit for this prosperous condition of\r\naffairs, Ferriol availed himself of the first pretext to attempt his\r\noverthrow. But it was in vain that he denounced him to the Kiaya of the\r\nGrand Vizier as having corrupted a courier and intercepted Louis XIV.’s\r\ndespatches.[255] This offence, then very common in Turkey, and for\r\nwhich, moreover, the exile demanded by Ferriol would have been a great\r\ndeal too severe a penalty, remained unpunished, and the high protection\r\nof the Mufti continued to screen the Patriarch.\r\n\r\nBut on this stage of sudden revolutions and unforeseen overthrows,\r\nsupreme power was then nearly always followed by a profound fall,\r\nbrought about most frequently by a laconic order from the seraglio,\r\nthough at times the clamour of the irritated populace was sufficient\r\nto precipitate the favourites of a day from the pinnacle of power, and\r\nin these frequent catastrophes the axe of the executioner was never\r\ninactive. At the moment when Avedick appeared likely to enjoy for a\r\nlong time the powerful support of the Mufti, a formidable revolution\r\nbroke out at Constantinople. Two hundred thousand men in arms demanded\r\nthe presence of the Grand Seignior, insisting upon the observance of\r\nthe law according to which he was not permitted in times of peace\r\nto absent himself from the capital; all the troops uniting with the\r\npeople and the men of law, the troops to complain of not having been\r\npaid, the people to attribute their misery to the residence of the\r\nSultan at Adrianople, the men of law to protest against the cupidity\r\nof the Mufti.[256] The latter had his throat cut, the Sultan, Mustapha\r\nII., was deposed, and his brother, Achmet III., was drawn from the\r\nrecesses of the seraglio and placed on the throne: such was the\r\nrapid revolution which all at once deprived Avedick of his protector\r\nand delivered him up to Ferriol’s resentment. Indeed, less than two\r\nmonths afterwards, the Armenian Patriarch was deposed and imprisoned\r\nin the fortress of the Seven Towers,[257] and then, on the repeated\r\nentreaties of the ambassador, exiled to Abratadas in Syria. The\r\nArmenians refused to obey the new Patriarch, Kaisac, and demanded in\r\nvain their beloved chief.[258] Ferriol’s influence was sufficiently\r\ngreat to allow him to indulge in the most minute and cruel precautions.\r\nCast on a barren rock, far from Constantinople, the ex-Patriarch still\r\nseemed redoubtable. Ferriol, therefore, rendered his imprisonment as\r\npainful as possible, and with a barbarity the proofs of which one would\r\nhesitate to admit, if they did not emanate from him who was guilty of\r\nit, he considered it necessary to have his victim shut up “in a dungeon\r\nfull of water, and from which one could not see the daylight.”[259]\r\nFerriol mentions this refinement of cruelty in his despatches, without\r\nin the least appearing to regret it, and in his account, as well as in\r\nthe replies of the King and the Ministers to whom he addresses himself,\r\none seeks in vain, on the one hand, for an attempt at a justification,\r\nand, on the other, for a disavowal, or at least for an expression of\r\nsurprise. In consequence of this silence the Government of Louis XIV.\r\nbears its share of responsibility for the barbarous conduct of its\r\nambassador.\r\n\r\nBut the affection of the Armenians proved more powerful than Ferriol’s\r\nhatred. The enormous sum of four hundred purses[260] was collected by\r\nthe schismatics, and tempted the cupidity of the Grand Vizier and his\r\nprincipal officers. The promises made Ferriol were forgotten, and, a\r\nyear after having been deposed, Avedick re-ascended the patriarchal\r\nthrone.[261] “He has united himself with the Greeks,” wrote Ferriol\r\nto Pontchartrain, “and I foresee terrible persecutions against the\r\nCatholics.”[262] And, before assuring himself that there was any\r\nfoundation for these fears, the ambassador, whose mind is fruitful in\r\nvigorous measures, immediately proposes a means, not of preventing\r\npersecution, but of avenging himself for it in advance, and continuing\r\nto set his enemies an example of violence. He requests the Pope and\r\nthe Grand Master of Malta to arrest the Greeks and Armenians who\r\nnavigate the waters of the Archipelago, or who may be found in the\r\nislands, and to take possession of their effects and guard their\r\npersons. As they had a very large number of vessels, and the isles\r\nwere open and without defence against a sudden attack, the ambassador\r\nforesaw that the repression would necessarily be formidable.[263]\r\n\r\nWhich is the persecutor? This man so industrious in contriving these\r\nrigorous measures, so prompt in taking advantage of his enemies, or the\r\nArmenians, faithful to the religion of their fathers and withstanding\r\nan impassioned and ardent proselytism? Which are the persecuted?\r\nThat since his exile to Abratadas, Avedick had conceived a violent\r\nhatred against the Catholics must be admitted, and one cannot be\r\nastonished at his having done so. But it is undeniable that, having\r\nquitted his prison and resumed his position as head of the Armenians,\r\nhe dissimulated his resentment and lived in peace with the Catholic\r\npopulation. “He makes no move,” wrote Ferriol on January 20, 1705, and\r\non March 11: “He behaves with great respect, and religious affairs are\r\nvery tranquil here.” “Avedick causes no annoyance to the Catholics,” we\r\nread in a despatch of August 13. But the ambassador immediately adds,\r\n“I hope that he will burst forth, and I shall not lose the occasion of\r\ndestroying him.”[264] “I shall not give him,” writes he to the Cardinal\r\nde Janson, “a moment of rest; knowing him to be a very wicked man and\r\ncapable of great dissimulation.”[265]\r\n\r\nWith the view of consolidating a peace which he believed might be made\r\ndefinitive, Avedick proceeded, on December 26, 1705, to the French\r\nembassy.[266] He presented himself there neither as a suppliant nor out\r\nof bravado. Accompanied by three hundred Armenians of good standing,\r\nhe came to propose to the representative of the Protector of the\r\nCatholic religion in the Levant to forbid in his churches the anathemas\r\nlaunched against certain heretics, and he asked that the Jesuits, who\r\nhad long since received permission to preach in the Turkish language\r\nin the Armenian places of worship, should do so without passion and\r\nwith moderation. Far from being disarmed by this proud but by no means\r\nprovocatory proceeding, Ferriol characterized it as impudent,[267]\r\nand avowed that if he had not previously given him a safe conduct, he\r\nshould certainly have had the Patriarch arrested. His aversion suffered\r\nneither truce nor repose. Not feeling himself sufficiently powerful to\r\narrive single-handed at his ends, he stirred up among the Armenians\r\nthemselves adversaries to his enemy. He encouraged the ambitious\r\npatriarch of Sissem, who aspired to replace Avedick as Grand Patriarch,\r\nreceiving him in the palace of the embassy,[268] supporting him with\r\nhis influence and aiding him with his counsels. At length, after a\r\nyear of constant efforts, of corruption practised among the officers\r\nof the Divan, of threats, intrigues, and underhand manœuvres of every\r\nkind, Ferriol had the satisfaction of being able to announce to Louis\r\nXIV.[269] that Avedick had been deposed for the second time, and for\r\nthe third time sent into exile.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, with the view of rendering this fall final, and in order\r\nto disembarrass himself for ever of his enemy, that Ferriol imagined,\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth century, one of the most violent and\r\nstrangest acts that a representative of a civilized nation could ever\r\nhave dared to commit. It was he who had the sad honour of having\r\nconceived the plan. But a despatch,[270] which tells overwhelmingly\r\nagainst the Catholic missionaries, proves clearly that their incitement\r\ninduced Ferriol to regard this act as indispensable, and that, by never\r\nceasing to recall to the ambassador the pretended dangers which the\r\nPatriarch, exiled and powerless, still offered, they determined him in\r\nhis resolution to have recourse to an abduction.\r\n\r\nAvedick was deposed on February 25, 1706. Two months afterwards he\r\nwas carried into exile. On April 20, he left Constantinople, which he\r\nwas never to see again, and his beloved Armenians, from whom he was\r\nthis time being separated for ever, and for whom, during the whole of\r\ntheir lives, he was about to become the object of anxious care, of\r\nconstant regret, and of incessant but fruitless researches. Ferriol\r\nhad bought over the _Chiaoux_ in charge of the ex-Patriarch, and had\r\nforwarded instructions to the Sieur Bonnal, vice-consul at Chio, on\r\nhis passage through which Avedick had to stop for a few hours.[271]\r\nIt was here that a most audacious crime against the law of nations was\r\ncommitted. Bonnal, assisted by Father Tarillon, a Jesuit,[272] had,\r\naccording to Ferriol’s injunctions, chartered a small merchant-vessel,\r\ncommanded by a Frenchman, who received orders to proceed to Marseilles.\r\nOn his arrival at Chio, the bribed _Chiaoux_ delivered up the great\r\npersonage committed to his charge, and the representative of Louis\r\nXIV., accompanied by the Jesuit Tarillon, took possession of the\r\nSultan’s subject and imprisoned him on board the French ship. There\r\nwas no obstacle to the abduction, and the protestations of the old man\r\nagainst this abuse of force were vain, and remained without response.\r\nDuring the voyage no pirates were encountered as Ferriol feared there\r\nmight be,[273] and as, doubtless, the prisoner hoped for, since to fall\r\ninto their hands would have been a hundred times preferable to the\r\ntreatment which was reserved for him in France. Nevertheless it was\r\ngiven to him to indulge in some hope. Contrary winds drove the vessel\r\nto Genoa.[274] There Avedick, watched over as he is by his gaoler,\r\neludes his vigilance and confides to a Greek, named Spartaly, two\r\nletters, one addressed to Maurocordato, first interpreter of the Porte,\r\nthe other to the Armenian Theodat, in which he names the persons\r\nconcerned in his abduction and demands vengeance. But misfortune seems\r\nto have been inexorable to the ex-Patriarch. Spartaly sailed to Smyrna\r\non board an English ship, and was about to proceed to Constantinople\r\nwith the revelatory letters, when he meets and imparts his secret to\r\nJustimany, another Greek of Chio, who forthwith sells his compatriot’s\r\nsecret to the French consul.[275] The latter, perfectly understanding\r\nthe importance of the revelation, sends for Spartaly, buys him over in\r\nhis turn, and detains him at Smyrna. Whilst he is sending to Ferriol\r\nthe intercepted letters, which, instead of saving the prisoner, are\r\nabout to draw down upon him greater rigour, Avedick, indulging in the\r\nbelief that he can count upon their happy effect, and anticipating an\r\nearly release, arrives at Marseilles, is delivered into the hands of M.\r\nde Montmor, intendant of the galleys, and thrown into the dungeons of\r\nthe Arsenal.[276]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[248] Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Turkey,\r\n_Déclaration Authentique de M.

Guillaume Depping, of the Bibliothèque\r\nImpériale. In this work several despatches relating to Avedick are\r\ngiven, of which we shall continue to indicate the source as we make use\r\nof them. It is by means of these despatches, and of the unpublished\r\nones from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that we are enabled to\r\nrelate the Patriarch’s end, even to the smallest details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n The Chevalier de Taulès--How he was led to believe that Avedick\r\n was the Man with the Iron Mask--A clear Proof furnished him of the\r\n impossibility of his Theory--Taulès persists and accuses the Jesuit\r\n Fathers of Forgery--Examination of Dujonca’s Journal--Its complete\r\n Authenticity and the unaffected Sincerity of the Writer cannot be\r\n doubted--New Proofs of this Authenticity and of Dujonca’s Exactitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have discovered the Man with the Iron Mask, and it is my duty to\r\nrender an account to Europe and to posterity of my discovery,” exclaims\r\nthe Chevalier de Taulès,[277] with a conviction which posterity does\r\nnot share, and a solemnity of manner so little justified by results,\r\nthat an extreme reserve is imposed on those who venture after him to\r\nengage in a pursuit so fruitful in checks.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of this discovery was at first received with a\r\nconfidence which was explained by the position of the individual\r\nwho claimed to have made it. Sprung from one of the oldest and most\r\nrespectable families of Bearn; admitted, in 1754, into the gendarmes\r\nof the King’s Guard; starting, ten years afterwards, in the career of\r\ndiplomacy, which he pursued always with honour, sometimes with success;\r\nsent successively to Switzerland, Poland, and later to Syria, as\r\nconsul-general; corresponding on terms of friendship with Voltaire,\r\nwho showed some deference for his opinions;[278] M. de Taulès enjoyed\r\namong his contemporaries an authority due as much to the qualities\r\nof his mind as to his honourable character. He had lived through the\r\nfirst Empire without desiring to re-enter the service of the State, and\r\nhad devoted to historical studies the leisure which his independent\r\nspirit had created. It was the perusal of an unpublished manuscript\r\nmemorandum of the Marquis de Bonnac, ambassador at Constantinople,\r\nthat revealed to Taulès the existence of the Grand Patriarch, Avedick,\r\nand his abduction by Ferriol. The writer of this memorandum added\r\nthat Avedick had been afterwards sent to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nand then transferred to the Bastille, where he had died. “On reading\r\nthis passage,” says Taulès, “the thought suddenly struck me that this\r\nindividual might very well be the Iron Mask. Becoming subsequently\r\nmore and more confirmed in this conjecture by a number of facts which\r\nthe perusal of the memorandum had confusedly recalled to me, I said to\r\nmyself, with fresh assurance, ‘Yes, it is himself: this is the Iron\r\nMask!’”[279]\r\n\r\nIn truth, this very natural thought must arise in the mind of every one\r\nwho reads this memorandum; and if Taulès believed that he at length\r\npossessed the solution of the problem, there were many others who\r\nwould have felt equally self-persuaded. His only fault--but it was a\r\ngreat one--was that of obstinately holding to this opinion when a more\r\ncomplete study of the question would have shown him his error; and of\r\nendeavouring to support his theory when it was being shattered, by an\r\naccusation of forgery as grave as it was unjust.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, the interest which Louis XIV. had in hiding the existence\r\nof such a prisoner as Avedick, the indispensability there was of\r\nshrouding from every eye the victim of so enormous a crime against the\r\nlaw of nations, the necessity, too, of removing from the ex-Patriarch\r\nevery means of informing the Ottoman Porte of the country where he was\r\ndetained, the clamour which his disappearance had caused throughout\r\nthe entire East, the precarious situation in which the King of France\r\nthen found himself, constrained as he was to treat Turkey with\r\nconsideration, were all so many arguments that crowded upon the mind\r\nin favour of Taulès’ opinion. This theory presented, moreover, the\r\nadvantage of explaining several circumstances, true or supposed, in\r\nthe life of Saint-Mars’ mysterious prisoner. For instance, the silence\r\nalmost constantly observed by him, which caused it to be continually\r\nsaid that he was condemned to it under pain of death, was accounted\r\nfor by the Armenian Patriarch’s ignorance of our language. Again, that\r\nstrange accent noticed by the surgeon Nélaton, in a visit made by\r\nhim to the Bastille,[280] and which struck him in the few syllables\r\narticulated by the prisoner, finds its natural explanation in Avedick.\r\nThe famous reply of Louis XV. to his valet-de-chambre, Laborde, who\r\nquestioned him about the Man with the Iron Mask, “The imprisonment of\r\nthis unfortunate individual has wronged nobody but himself,” applied\r\nsufficiently exactly to the Patriarch. Lastly, in default of those\r\nofficial despatches, which, to-day, a sovereign and indispensable\r\nproof, alone allow one to erect a theory upon a firm basis, the\r\nsuggestion of Taulès united in its favour several strong presumptions,\r\nand did not at the outset meet with any fundamental objection.\r\n\r\nBut the originator was not to experience for long an unmixed joy. His\r\nconviction was most firmly rooted. “Perhaps nothing,” he says, “has\r\never appeared to me so very plainly. _I do not more clearly feel my\r\nexistence than I recognize the Patriarch in all the features of the\r\nIron Mask._”[281] All at once, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,[282]\r\nwho had ordered researches to be made among his archives, caused the\r\nChevalier de Taulès to be informed that an important Armenian personage\r\nhad really been abducted from Constantinople and taken to France, but\r\nthat as indisputable despatches established the fact that he was still\r\nin Turkey during the early part of 1706, he could not be the prisoner\r\nbrought by Saint-Mars from the Isles Sainte-Marguerite to the Bastille\r\non September 18, 1698, and who died in that fortress on November 19,\r\n1703. Taulès at first accepted with resignation this truly startling\r\nrevelation. His theory was completely overthrown, his reasoning\r\ndestroyed, his discovery annihilated. He acknowledged it. He regretted\r\nnot having sooner recalled that maxim which he had often heard repeated\r\nby D’Alembert himself, “In this world one must neither deny nor affirm\r\nanything.” He avowed his mistake, and the man of sense gracefully\r\nrepaired the very excusable error committed by the historian. But\r\nhis theory had become so profoundly and tenaciously impressed upon\r\nhis brain, that he could not entirely rid himself of it. A germ\r\nremained which developed by degrees, and in a fashion which of itself\r\ndeserves attention, independently of the interest which is inspired by\r\neverything that relates to the Man with the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” Taulès asks himself, “that a proof so powerful\r\ncan yet leave me any resources? To argue in the train of a _fact so\r\ndestructive to my opinion_, and the truth of which I am obliged to\r\nadmit, would it not be endeavouring in a deliberate manner to push\r\nprejudice to its utmost length?”[283] We see that at first Taulès did\r\nnot contest the accuracy of the two dates, and the impossibility of\r\nreconciling them with his theory; but by degrees he modifies the terms\r\nof the problem to be resolved. He no longer makes it his business to\r\ndiscover who was the Man with the Iron Mask, but to prove, in spite of\r\na capital objection, that the Man with the Iron Mask was Avedick. This\r\nfact is worthy of remark, and the chain of Taulès’ successive ideas is\r\nhere very significant. He does not commence by seeking if a forgery\r\nhas been committed by the Jesuits, in order to establish afterwards\r\nthat Avedick is the Man with the Iron Mask. No. It is the necessity\r\nin which he believes himself placed, of establishing this identity,\r\nthat first gives him the idea of a forgery, then we have his inquiry,\r\nand then the certainty that this forgery has been committed. “However\r\nbold my observation may appear, I shall dare to make it, _I feel hope\r\nrevive in my soul_, and in spite of all I have just avowed against\r\nmyself, I do not renounce my discovery.... If I am deceiving myself, I\r\nshall deserve to be doubly confounded. But if, as everything assures\r\nme I shall do, I come victorious out of this struggle, confusion\r\nwill altogether be the portion of those who have wished to deprive\r\nme of the honour of this discovery.”[284] From this time all Taulès’\r\nefforts tended to destroy the positive information till then accepted\r\nby him. Not being able to deny the authenticity of the despatches of\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs establishing that Avedick was still at\r\nConstantinople in 1706, and this obstacle being insurmountable, Taulès\r\ndirected his attention towards Dujonca’s journal. Father Griffet was\r\nthe first who quoted[285] the two pages of this journal relating to the\r\nmysterious prisoner and bearing the dates of September 19, 1698, the\r\nday of his arrival at the Bastille, and of November 18, 1703, the day\r\nof his death. But Father Griffet was a Jesuit. On this score, and in\r\nthe interest, in his eyes superior to all other, of the order to which\r\nhe belonged, might he not have been able to alter, to falsify this\r\ndocument, in such a manner that it might be opposed to those who should\r\none day, perhaps, arise to accuse the Jesuits of the abduction of\r\nAvedick, and perhaps see in this individual the Man with the Iron Mask?\r\nThis suspicion had scarcely entered the mind of Taulès before it took\r\npossession of it and ruled it, when everything immediately became for\r\nhim an irresistible argument for, and formal proof of a falsification.\r\n\r\nThis journal is divided into two parts, each forming a volume. The\r\nfirst has for title: “List of prisoners who are sent by the King’s\r\norder to the Bastille, to commence from Wednesday the eleventh of the\r\nmonth of October, when I am entered into the office of Lieutenant of\r\nthe King, in the year 1690,” and at the back of folio 37 we have word\r\nfor word what follows:--\r\n\r\n“On thursday 18th September 1698, at 3 o’clock of the afternoon,\r\nMonsieur de St.-Mars governor of the château of the bastille has\r\narrived to enter upon his functions coming from his government of the\r\nisles St.-Marguerite honorat having brought with him in his litter an\r\nold prisoner whom he had at pignerol whom he always kept masked [and]\r\nwhose name was not mentioned and having had him placed on leaving the\r\nlitter in the first chamber of the tower of the bassinnière until the\r\nnight in order to place him and conduct him myself at 9 o’clock of the\r\nevening with M. de rosarges one of the sergeants whom monsieur the\r\ngovernor had brought into the third chamber south of the tower of the\r\nBretaudière[286] which I had had furnished with everything some days\r\nbefore his arrival having received Monsieur de St.-Mars’ order for it\r\nwhich prisoner will be subject to and served by Mr. de rosarge and\r\nprovisioned by monsieur the Governor.”\r\n\r\nThe second part, of which the title is, “List of prisoners who left the\r\nBastille, to commence from the eleventh of the month of October, when I\r\nam entered into possession in the year 1690,” contains, at the back of\r\nfolio 80, what follows:--\r\n\r\n“On the same day monday 19th november 1703----the unknown prisoner\r\nalways masked with a mask of black velvet whom Monsieur de St.-Mars\r\ngovernor had brought with him on coming from the isles St.-Marguerite\r\nwhom he had guarded since a long time [and] who having found himself\r\nyesterday rather ill on leaving mass died to-day at ten o’clock at\r\nnight without having had any great illness he could not have had less.\r\nM. Giraut our chaplain confessed him yesterday [but] surprised by his\r\ndeath he has not received the sacraments and our chaplain exhorted him\r\na moment before dying and this unknown prisoner so long detained was\r\ninterred on tuesday 20th november at four o’clock of the afternoon in\r\nthe cemetery of St-Paul our parish on the register of deaths [**symbol]\r\nwas also given a name unknown to monsieur de rosarges major and Mr.\r\nReil surgeon who have signed the register.\r\n\r\n“[**symbol] I have since learnt that he was named on the register M. de\r\nMarchiel [and] that 40 l. were paid for his burial.”[287]\r\n\r\nFor every unprejudiced and impartial reader, these unaffected pages\r\nare conclusive, and do not inspire any doubt. But it is not the same\r\nfor Taulès. According to him, Father Griffet himself, and not Dujonca,\r\nis the author of this document, in which, with infinite art, he has\r\nintroduced several points of obscurity, and succeeded in misleading\r\nfor ever all those who should be tempted to raise the veil. He has\r\ncommenced by imagining the two dates of 1698 and 1703, so that it would\r\nbe impossible to apply them to Avedick, who was still at Constantinople\r\nin 1706. It is designedly that, with an infinity of precautions, he has\r\ndrawn attention to this fact which he had invented at will: “Saint-Mars\r\nhad this prisoner at Pignerol,” a point on which he insists by saying\r\nfurther on: “This prisoner whom he had guarded since a long time.” To\r\nmake Dujonca twice affirm that the Man with the Iron Mask was first\r\ndetained at Pignerol of course absolutely sets Avedick aside. The\r\naffectation of speaking several times of the Abbé Giraut, chaplain of\r\nthe Bastille, is equally significant to Taulès, in so much that it\r\nreveals the cunning intention of carefully avoiding having to name\r\nthe Jesuits, even when it concerns the Bastille, to which one of them\r\nwas constantly attached. It is true that the registers of the Church\r\nof Saint-Paul confirm Dujonca’s journal, since the interment of the\r\nprisoner is related in them under the date of November 20, 1703.[288]\r\nBut this objection does not embarrass Taulès. Without going so far as\r\nto suppose that these registers have also been falsified, he is very\r\nwilling to accept them as authentic. “But,” says he, “this prisoner\r\ninterred November 20, 1703, is not the one brought by Saint-Mars to\r\nthe Bastille. It is some obscure stranger, and Father Griffet finding\r\non the registers of this church the proof of his death in 1703, has\r\nused it as a basis on which to erect his falsehoods, and by attracting\r\nto him the exclusive attention of posterity, has turned it aside\r\nfrom Avedick, and has necessarily rendered ulterior investigations\r\nfruitless.”\r\n\r\nBut it is nothing of the kind. In this painful episode of Louis XIV.’s\r\nreign, the Jesuits have their share of responsibility, owing to the\r\npressure which they put upon Ferriol, but they are completely innocent\r\nof the forgeries of which they have been accused.\r\n\r\nThe perfect authenticity of Dujonca’s journal is shown by many proofs.\r\nIt suffices to have read it and assured oneself that it is not composed\r\nof detached leaves afterwards bound together, but has been written all\r\nentire by the same incorrect and simple pen, in order to be convinced\r\nof the impossibility of the least alteration. Either it is a forgery\r\nfrom beginning to end, or the pages relating to the Iron Mask have\r\nfor their author that kind of general superintendent of the Bastille,\r\nsometimes too pompously styled Lieutenant of the King, sometimes\r\nfulfilling the humble functions of turnkey, devoted to his multifarious\r\nduties,[289] who ought to be believed for his ignorance of certain\r\nthings as much as for his complete knowledge of others, for the\r\nunfeigned simplicity of his language, and the tone of sincere assurance\r\nthat runs uniformly throughout the entire journal. Moreover, not only\r\nis all that concerns the other prisoners corroborated by indisputable\r\ndespatches deposited in other archives,[290] but the most reliable\r\ndocuments absolutely confirm the dates, and even some of the points\r\nindicated in the two accounts we have just quoted. Dujonca says in\r\nthe first: “I had had his chamber furnished with everything some days\r\nbefore his arrival, _having received M. de Saint-Mars’ order for it_.”\r\nNow a despatch as yet unpublished and of especial importance contains\r\nwhat follows: “Barbézieux to Saint-Mars.--Marly, July 19, 1698--I have\r\nreceived the letter which you have taken the trouble to write to me the\r\n9th of this month. The King finds it good that you should leave the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite to go to the Bastille with your old prisoner,\r\ntaking your precautions to prevent his being either seen or known by\r\nany one. _You can write in advance to His Majesty’s Lieutenant of this\r\nchâteau to have a chamber ready so as to be able to place your prisoner\r\nin it on your arrival._”\r\n\r\nThis despatch cannot be questioned. It exists in the archives of the\r\nMinistry of War. It was written by the Minister, Barbézieux, a short\r\ntime previous to Saint-Mars’ departure for the Bastille, and like many\r\nothers which we shall quote hereafter, it establishes in a formal\r\nmanner that in 1698, and not later, the Man with the Iron Mask entered\r\nthe Bastille, and that no alteration has consequently been made in\r\nDujonca’s journal.\r\n\r\nBut to these definitive proofs let us add others drawn from Avedick’s\r\nvery singular end. Let us return to this individual at the moment when\r\nhe treads the French soil for the first time, and let us follow him\r\nto his death, less in order to complete our demonstration that he is\r\nnot the Man with the Iron Mask--which would be superfluous--than to\r\nthrow every light upon this little-known individual, and pursue to its\r\n_dénoûment_ the story of this extraordinary crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[277] _L’Homme au Masque de Fer: Mémoire Historique par le Chevalier de\r\nTaulès, ancien consul-général en Syrie_, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[278] From 1752 to 1768, Taulès and Voltaire had a long and interesting\r\ncorrespondence, published by Gaultier-Laguionie (Paris, 1825), at the\r\nend of various memoirs of Taulès.\r\n\r\n[279] _L’Homme au Masque de Fer: Mémoire Historique_, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[280] This has already been referred to in Chapter VIII. of this work.\r\nSee page 93 _ante_.\r\n\r\n[281] _L’Homme au Masque de Fer_, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[282] M. de Vergennes.\r\n\r\n[283] _L’Homme au Masque de Fer_, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[284] _L’Homme au Masque de Fer_, p. 63.\r\n\r\n[285] In his _Traité des Differentes Sortes de Preuves qui servent à\r\nétablir la Vérité dans l’Histoire_.\r\n\r\n[286] This and the tower mentioned just above are supposed to have been\r\nnamed after their builders.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[287] Archives of the Library of the Arsenal, Manuscript Journal of\r\nDujonca.\r\n\r\n[288] Archives of the Hôtel de Ville, _Registres des Baptêmes, Mariages\r\net Sépultures de la Paroisse de Saint-Paul_: Saint-Paul 5, 1703-1705,\r\nvol. ii No. 166.\r\n\r\n[289] I have found among the Archives of the Arsenal another document\r\nalso emanating from the pen of Dujonca, whose journal up to the present\r\ntime was alone known. These are notes in which he enumerates the heavy\r\noccupations that weighed him down. This document throws a certain light\r\nupon the interior arrangements of the Bastille. It is the same large\r\nwriting as that of the Journal, with the same faults of language, the\r\nsame simple-mindedness. It is too long to be quoted here. I merely\r\nextract the statement of everything that Dujonca had to do.\r\n\r\n“For more than a year since I have entered the Bastille I have been\r\nobliged to perform the service which follows:--\r\n\r\n“To rise every morning the first and to go to bed the last--To place\r\nthe guard very often instead of the officers of Monsieur de Besemaux;\r\nto make the round and the visit every evening in the uncertainty as to\r\nwhether these gentlemen will do it; to close the doors very often, not\r\nbeing able to rely upon any one--To take every care of the guard of\r\nthe château, being unable either to trust or rely upon the governor’s\r\ntwo officers, who do only what pleases them, and render account of\r\nwhat passes only to Monsieur de Besemaux--When Monsieur de la Venice\r\nor other commissaries come to interrogate prisoners, it is necessary\r\nto go and take them from their chamber and to lead them into Monsieur\r\nde Besemaux’s room, traversing all the courts, and it is necessary to\r\nwait outside the door very often for eight hours at a time, in order to\r\nretake possession of the prisoner, and conduct him back to the place\r\nwhence he had been taken--The prisoners to whom it is permitted to\r\nsee visitors it is also necessary to go and take from their chambers,\r\nto lead them through all the courts into the common room, where the\r\nrelations or friends await them, and it is very often necessary to\r\nremain with them quite as long as they wish, being obliged to keep them\r\nin sight, and afterwards to take them back again--It is necessary to\r\nhave the same care and application for certain people of the reformed\r\nreligion, who are seen and talked to by Father Bordes, M. Latour Dalier\r\nand Madame Chardon, in order to convert them--To follow and guard the\r\nprisoners who have permission to go and walk in the garden and on the\r\nterrace from time to time. All the sick prisoners it is necessary to\r\ngo and visit often, and to take care of them--Those who have need of\r\nthe doctor and apothecary, it is necessary to conduct where the sick\r\ngo; and in order to be more assured of what passes and of the remedies\r\nwhich they are ordered to take, it is necessary to be present when they\r\nare brought to them--For the prisoner who is very ill and in danger\r\nof death, it is necessary to redouble all these cares in order to\r\nmake him confess and receive all the sacraments, and when he is dead\r\nit is necessary to fulfil all the duties of a good Christian--On the\r\narrival of a prisoner who is to be confined it is necessary to commence\r\nby examining and searching him all over, as well as the whole of his\r\nclothing, and to conduct him to the chamber assigned to him. Moreover,\r\nit is necessary to take care to have given and brought to him all that\r\nis essential for the furnishing of his chamber, paying very dearly\r\nfor it to Monsieur de Besemaux’s upholsterer, or else the _maîtresse\r\nd’autel_--It is necessary, also, to search all the confined prisoners\r\nwho obtain their entire liberty, and to examine their clothes before\r\nthey leave in consequence of the great communication which exists\r\nbetween the prisoners. It is necessary also to take the same care in\r\nsearching the prisoners who are confined in order to place them in the\r\nliberty of the court, which happens sufficiently often--To visit all\r\nthe chambers and to search everywhere, even all the prisoners and their\r\nclothing--It is also necessary to examine everything which comes from\r\nwithout for the prisoners confined here, and their clothing that goes\r\nout, in order to be mended or washed--Amongst the number of prisoners\r\nthere are some who daily find themselves in necessity or need of\r\nsomething, or else of some complaint of their food, or of the bad usage\r\nof the turnkeys who attend upon them, which prisoners in their distress\r\nare compelled to beat their doors so as to give notice of their wants;\r\nthese are occasions which often happen and cause a great noise, so that\r\nit is necessary to go and make frequent visits--It is necessary to pay\r\nattention to the food given the prisoners, being very often bad, with\r\nbad wine and dirty table-linen--To frequently examine all the plate\r\nusually used for the prisoners confined here, _who very often write\r\non the dishes and plates in order to give news of themselves to one\r\nanother_--To keep guard over and carefully observe all the persons who\r\nenter the Bastille, especially the women and girls who come to see\r\nthe prisoners who are in the liberty of the court--On the principal\r\nfestivals of the year it is necessary to take every care to make those\r\nprisoners who are allowed by orders to do so, confess, hear mass, and\r\ncommunicate--To go several times during the day and the evening on to\r\nthe platforms outside the château, in order to prevent the prisoners\r\nin one tower talking to those in another, and to send soldiers in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Bastille in order to arrest the persons who\r\nmake signs to the prisoners whom they know, and very often these are\r\nprisoners who have received their liberty wishing to render service to\r\nthose who remain, there being communication everywhere, and the cause\r\nof all these disorders.”\r\n\r\n[290] A single example will suffice. The person confined in the\r\nBastille a few days before the Iron Mask is, according to Dujonca,\r\nthe famous Madame Guyon, and a letter from Count de Pontchartrain to\r\nSaint-Mars, of November 3, 1698, says: “As for Madame Guyon, it is not\r\nnecessary to do anything with reference to her except by the advice\r\nof the Archbishop:”--Imperial Archives, Registers of the Secretary’s\r\noffice of the King’s Household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n Avedick is at first confined in the Prisons of the Arsenal--From\r\n Marseilles he is conducted to Mount Saint-Michel--Description of\r\n Mount Saint-Michel--Treatment to which Avedick is exposed--His\r\n useless Protestations against this Abuse of Force--Universal Emotion\r\n excited throughout the East--Complaints of the Divan--Ferriol’s\r\n Impudence--Terrible Reprisals practised on the Catholics--False\r\n Avedicks--Expedients to which Ferriol is reduced--Inquietude of\r\n the Roman Court--Duplicity of Louis XIV.’s Government--Avedick\r\n is transferred to the Bastille--Suggestions of which he is the\r\n Object--He abjures and is set at Liberty--He dies at Paris in the Rue\r\n Férou--Delusive Document drawn up with Reference to this Death--Share\r\n of Responsibility which attaches to each of the Authors of the\r\n Abduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not at Marseilles that Avedick was detained, neither was he\r\nsent, as has been said, to Messina, or to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite\r\nto be imprisoned. Louis XIV. was too prudent and too circumspect\r\nto leave in a port of the Mediterranean an individual whom his\r\nco-religionists, supported by the Ottoman Porte, were energetically\r\ndemanding and seeking with anxious solicitude. Directly the Government\r\nof Louis XIV. was advised of the outcry which the disappearance of\r\nthe Grand Patriarch had excited in the East, an Exempt was sent to\r\nMarseilles, to M. de Montmor, intendant of the galleys, in order to\r\nwithdraw Avedick from the prisons of the Arsenal, and conduct him,\r\n“under good and sure guard,” to the other extremity of France. At the\r\nsame time it was enjoined “to all governors, mayors, syndics, and other\r\nofficials, to give the Exempt every protection, aid, and assistance in\r\ncase of need,”[291] rather an unnecessary precaution in the case of\r\nthis weak and inoffensive old man.\r\n\r\nNear the ancient boundary of Brittany and Normandy,[292] rises a\r\nnarrow rock surrounded on all sides by the waves, or by quicksands\r\nleft uncovered by the sea when it falls at every tide. These sands,\r\nwhich extend to the firm land over a distance of nearly a couple of\r\nmiles, are rendered very dangerous to cross by the mouths of several\r\nsmall streams.[293] On this rock, impressed with a savage grandeur,\r\nsome monks had, in the eighth century,[294] constructed a monastery,\r\nwhere they lived isolated from the rest of the world, from which they\r\nwere sometimes separated by vast plains of sand, and sometimes by\r\nthe waters of the sea at regular but not far distant intervals. It\r\nwas to this Abbey of Mount Saint-Michel, occupied by Benedictines,\r\nalternately devoting themselves to work and prayer, that the Grand\r\nPatriarch of the Armenians was conducted. The Prior of the abbey\r\nreceived orders to strictly guard the prisoner brought to him,\r\n“without allowing him to hold communication with any one, either by\r\nword of mouth or by writing,”[295] a very superfluous precaution in\r\nthe case of an Armenian whose language nobody knew, who was ignorant\r\nof French, and who found himself in the midst of monks who from his\r\narrival were taught to curse him. He was represented to them, indeed,\r\nas a detestable persecutor of Catholics[296]--this man who had been\r\nthree times exiled and twice deposed by them, snatched violently from\r\nhis country, at one time cast upon the coast of Syria and confined in\r\na dungeon into which the water penetrated, at another carried into\r\na strange land, thousands of miles from his native land, where for\r\nfive years he was to drag out a miserable existence and then die. An\r\nobject of horror to the monks, doubly exiled in this place of exile,\r\nlike them separated from the world by obstacles almost as insuperable\r\nas those which parted them, separated from them also by the repulsion\r\nwhich he inspired, more unhappy still than in his first prison, where\r\nat least he breathed the air of his native land, Avedick could not even\r\npreserve the hope of being delivered. That consolatory prospect which\r\nhis meeting with Spartaly at Genoa had permitted him to entertain, he\r\nwas now obliged to renounce; since, even supposing that his letters had\r\nreached the Ottoman Porte,[297] no one would dream of coming to seek\r\nhim on so distant and desert a coast. As far as his gaze extended he\r\ncould expect to see no vessel of deliverance appear. Whether the sea\r\ncovered the sands or whether it ebbed and left them dry, there was the\r\nsame frightful solitude, the same mournful silence, broken at times by\r\nthe roar of the waves beating against the rock, or by the peaceful and\r\nmonotonous chants of the monks.\r\n\r\nFor ten months he listened to their prayers without being allowed to\r\ntake part in them, and he lived in the most absolute isolation. But on\r\nJuly 13, 1707, Pontchartrain wrote to the Prior of Mount Saint-Michel\r\nthat he might allow the prisoner to hear mass, and even admit him to\r\nconfession. “The King,” he added, “does not pretend to deprive him of\r\nthe succour which he might find in this sacrament; and his Majesty has\r\nmerely thought that, before admitting him to it, you ought to have\r\nhim examined with especial care, as it is to be feared, from what has\r\nalready happened, that his devotion is only feigned and illusory, in\r\norder to deceive and induce you to guard him with less care.”[298]\r\nSingular fear of a flight, impracticable in itself, and impossible\r\nto be prolonged for any length of time in a country where all was\r\nstrange and hostile to him! Pontchartrain requested the General of the\r\nBenedictines at Rome to send to Mount Saint-Michel a monk learned in\r\nOriental languages, to whom the most absolute discretion was prescribed\r\nwith respect to the disclosures which Avedick might make to him\r\notherwise than under the seal of confession,[299] but which were not\r\nto be kept secret from the Prior, who was charged to transmit them to\r\nthe Minister. Thus it was that they did not content themselves with\r\ndetaining the person of the Patriarch: they endeavoured to penetrate\r\nto the recesses of his soul, with the view of enlightening themselves\r\nupon the true sentiments,[300] and possibly upon the projects of the\r\nprisoner. The first word that he utters, and which can be understood,\r\nis a protest of right against might. “Let them judge me,” he says,[301]\r\n“and condemn me to the punishment that I deserve; or, if I am innocent,\r\nlet it be proclaimed, and let them set me at liberty!”\r\n\r\nHe was neither judged nor set at liberty; and his protest, forwarded by\r\nthe Prior to Versailles, was suppressed in Pontchartrain’s cabinet. It\r\nis true that at the same time the most alarming intelligence reached\r\nthe Minister from Constantinople, coupled with the most pressing\r\nentreaties from the court of the Vatican, and from the French embassy\r\nat the Porte, to isolate and guard the prisoner more strictly still.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the news of Avedick’s disappearance, the officers of the\r\nDivan and the Grand Vizier himself, justly excited, had demanded of\r\nFerriol what had become of him. The French ambassador answered with\r\nassurance that the individual in question had not been given in charge\r\nto him, and that no doubt the vessel on board which he had been carried\r\ninto exile was one of those English or Dutch corsairs which the Grand\r\nSeignior tolerated, even in the Dardanelles, to the prejudice of his\r\ncustom-house officers and of the interests of his sovereignty.[302]\r\nThis attempted diversion did not succeed for any length of time.\r\nEnglish and Dutch, questioned in their turn, having no satisfactory\r\nreply to give, the Grand Vizier ordered torture to be applied to the\r\n_Chiaoux_ who had conducted Avedick to Chio; and in the midst of his\r\ntorments the wretch avowed the whole truth.[303] The Vizier at once\r\nsolemnly sent the _Chiaoux-Bachi_ to the French embassy in order\r\nto claim Avedick as a subject of the Grand Seignior. Maurocordato,\r\nthe first interpreter of the Divan, presented himself a few minutes\r\nafterwards to join his demands to those of the _Chiaoux-Bachi_, and\r\nto insist that the abducted person should be immediately sent back\r\nto Constantinople. The preciseness and energy of the demand did not\r\ntrouble Ferriol, and with great presence of mind he replied, “I\r\nam ignorant of all that has happened; and truly I cannot have any\r\nconfidence in the depositions of the _Chiaoux_ charged to conduct\r\nAvedick. He declared, on returning to Constantinople, that he had been\r\ntaken prisoner by a corsair. Who will say that the second deposition,\r\nmade during the torments of the torture, is more accurate than the\r\nfirst? Moreover, if the French captain has carried off Avedick by force\r\nto Italy or France, he will be punished. But may it not be the case\r\nthat the ex-Patriarch, fearing death in his third exile, has employed\r\nthe captain to take him to a place of safety?” Little satisfied with\r\nthis reply, Maurocordato threatened Ferriol, in the Sultan’s name,\r\nwith general persecutions against the Armenian Catholics. “If Avedick\r\nis in France,” answered Ferriol, “I shall write with the view of his\r\nbeing compelled to return. But the Grand Seignior is master of his own\r\nsubjects. He can have all the Armenians put to death indifferently,\r\nwithout any such threat being able to make me acknowledge that of which\r\nI am ignorant.”[304]\r\n\r\nThe threat was put into execution, and the Catholics, in whose\r\npretended interest Avedick was abducted, were the objects of a\r\nfrightful vengeance. A _hatti-cherif_ ordered the arrest of the\r\nprincipal Armenians of the Latin rite,[305] nine of whom escaped\r\ndeath by apostasy, and three intrepidly confessing their faith, died\r\nmartyrs near the Pama-Capou Gate;[306] several Armenians were put to\r\nthe torture and questioned during their torments as to the fate of\r\nAvedick;[307] all proselytizing was interdicted to the Jesuits, and\r\nthe printing establishment which they had founded was destroyed; the\r\ntwo Armenian patriarchs, who had authorised the Catholic missionaries\r\nto preach in their churches, were arrested and thrown into prison; a\r\n_barat_ of the Sultan recalled Avedick to the post of Grand Patriarch;\r\nhis _vekil_ or vicar, Joanes, was appointed to fulfil his duties _ad\r\ninterim_,[308] the measures of rigour and the proscriptions[309]\r\nbeing increased from the moment of his elevation to power; all\r\nthe Catholics were obliged to fly or hide themselves; against them\r\nuniversal fury was directed, amongst them were desolation and ruin;\r\nsuch, at Constantinople and throughout the whole Turkish empire, were\r\nthe immediate and terrible consequences of Avedick’s abduction. So true\r\nis it that violence invariably leads to violence, and that an abuse of\r\nforce is sooner or later followed by reprisals which, although they\r\nare to be deplored, cannot be altogether condemned, since, if they are\r\nwithout excuse, they, at least, have their explanation in an immutable\r\nlaw common to all nations and all epochs!\r\n\r\nThis exasperation against the Catholics was equalled only by the\r\naffection which their unfortunate victim inspired. In all the churches\r\nprayers were said every evening for his prompt return. For a moment\r\nit was believed that they were answered.[310] The news spread through\r\nConstantinople that Avedick was at Rodosto, a town thirty leagues\r\noff. Some Armenians immediately set off to meet him, with the view of\r\nbringing him back in triumph. But they only found an impostor who had\r\nsucceeded in deceiving a large number of schismatics, and in collecting\r\na considerable sum in alms, by taking advantage of the enthusiasm\r\nexcited everywhere by the mere name of the Patriarch.[311]\r\n\r\nAll that concerned the fate of this beloved chief was sought after with\r\navidity, and accepted with a credulous but touching confidence. One\r\nday an Armenian affirmed that he had seen him in Holland, and received\r\na magnificent present for this happy piece of news; he disappeared,\r\nhowever, before it was discovered to be false.[312] Later, two Turkish\r\nslaves from Malta affirmed that Avedick was detained there a prisoner.\r\nThey contrived by this artifice to get their ransoms paid, and the\r\nfalse information brought by them not being devoid of probability, two\r\nrich Armenians determined to charter a vessel and proceed to Malta to\r\nclaim the prisoner. Ferriol, called upon to furnish them with a letter\r\nof recommendation both for Malta and for Rome, where they were to\r\ncontinue their researches, ostensibly did so. But he secretly forwarded\r\nby another channel to the Cardinal de la Trémouille, French ambassador\r\nto the Holy See, a private despatch,[313] in which he recommended the\r\ngreatest circumspection and the exercise of an incessant surveillance\r\nover the two Armenians.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Divan, whose demands continued to be both precise\r\nand firm, Ferriol, reduced to shifts, was always contriving fresh\r\nartifices in order to appease the Grand Vizier’s resentment.[314]\r\nAt times he promised to send one of the officers of the embassy in\r\nsearch of Avedick. Then the report having spread abroad that the Grand\r\nPatriarch was confined at Messina, Ferriol engaged to beg the King of\r\nFrance to demand of his grandson, Philip V., King of Spain, that he\r\nshould be set at liberty and sent back.[315] But he always affirmed\r\nthat he was a stranger to the abduction, and that he was entirely\r\nignorant of where Avedick was. On this last point, and on that only,\r\nhe was sincere. The government of Louis XIV. had concealed even from\r\nits representative at Constantinople the transfer of the prisoner to\r\nMount Saint-Michel, and Ferriol, very well informed of every detail of\r\nAvedick’s transport to Marseilles, had been prudently kept in the most\r\ncomplete ignorance of ulterior decisions. But if he was unacquainted\r\nwith them, he at least inspired them by his spiteful insistance, by\r\nhis implacability in pursuing his enemy even in his most profound and\r\nmost irretrievable fall. “He does not care to demand the death of the\r\nsinner,” he says, “but he must do penance, and must never be set at\r\nliberty.” “If Avedick is in the prisons of the Holy Office,” we read\r\nin another despatch, “he will never leave them; if he is in France, I\r\nbeg of you to order him to be placed in a dark chamber, from which he\r\ncan never behold the day.” “Whatever penance,” says he, elsewhere, “he\r\nmay perform for his crimes and for his persecution of the Latins, will\r\nnever be sufficiently great.”[316]\r\n\r\nFrom Rome also the most earnest entreaties and the most pressing\r\nrecommendations “to confine the prisoner still more closely”[317]\r\nreached Louis XIV. Twice did the Minister of Exterior Relations, the\r\nMarquis de Torcy, charge the Cardinal de la Trémouille to remove the\r\ninquietudes of the congregation of the Holy Office. “The orders to\r\nredouble attention and watchfulness,” wrote Torcy, “have been renewed.\r\nHe is seen only by the person who gives him his food. They converse\r\nonly by signs, and, when he hears mass on fête-days and Sundays, he\r\nis put in a place apart from all others.” At the same time,[318] the\r\nMinister informed the Cardinal that the Armenians, who had come to\r\nMarseilles, had departed again without being able to find any traces\r\nof Avedick. “We know,” he added,[319] “that the valet of the Patriarch\r\nis about to come from Leghorn to France, likewise with the view of\r\ndiscovering what has become of his master. But on his arrival he will\r\nbe arrested and closely imprisoned.” These despatches were, we see,\r\nof a nature to entirely reassure the Holy Office,[320] and Louis\r\nXIV. showed himself as vigilant a guardian of Avedick’s person as he\r\nhad been, through his ambassador, the principal author, and, in his\r\ndespatches, the unreserved approver of the abduction.\r\n\r\nHe went further still, and entering in his turn on that path of\r\nduplicity in which Ferriol had long since outstripped him, Louis XIV.\r\nwrote to his representative near the Porte: “It is impossible for us\r\nto satisfy the Grand Vizier’s demands with reference to Avedick. He is\r\nno longer in a state to be sent living to Constantinople.”[321] Louis\r\nXIV. added “that the news of his death had been given him, at the very\r\nmoment when, in order to be agreeable to the Grand Vizier, he was\r\nhaving the Patriarch sought for in Spain and Italy with the view of\r\ndelivering him up to his legitimate sovereign.”\r\n\r\nThis prisoner, still sufficiently menacing and formidable at the bottom\r\nof his dungeon for Rome as well as Versailles to be thus concerned\r\nabout his fate, this old man, the object of so many preoccupations,\r\nand, throughout the whole of the Levant, of regrets which he did\r\nnot even have the consolation of knowing, was not thought to be\r\nsufficiently surely isolated by the sands and the sea that surround\r\nMount Saint-Michel. The moats, the massive doors, and the towers of\r\nthe Bastille were considered necessary. “On December 18, 1709,” says\r\nDujonca in his journal, “there has entered a very important prisoner,\r\nwhose name was not mentioned.”[322] This was Avedick, whose death,\r\nannounced by Louis XIV., the majority of the Armenians had long since\r\nbeen mourning. The same recommendations which the Prior of Mount\r\nSaint-Michel had received were given to M. de Bernaville, governor\r\nof the State prison, and he was forbidden “to allow the slightest\r\ncommunication between his new prisoner and any other person.”[323]\r\nHowever, Louis XIV. was not slow in authorising an exception to this\r\nrule. A project, long since favoured by the King’s government, and the\r\nexecution of which would render it for ever impossible for Avedick\r\nto return to Constantinople, was about to be realized. This was to\r\ninstruct him in the Catholic religion, to determine him to submit\r\nto the authority of the Holy See, and thus to lead him to discredit\r\nhimself with those of his co-religionists who still doubted of his\r\ndeath. Such was the end, for the accomplishment of which a monk had\r\nbeen placed near the Patriarch during the two years of his stay at\r\nMount Saint-Michel. At the Bastille the suggestions became more\r\npressing, and Armenian books were given to him,[324] in which he might\r\nlearn the Catholic doctrines, and convince himself how narrow were\r\nthe grounds of difference which separated the Latin Armenians from\r\nthe schismatics. These he traversed, and, on September 22, 1710, he\r\nabjured between the hands of the Cardinal de Noailles, Archbishop\r\nof Paris, by an instrument written in the Armenian language, three\r\ntranslations of which in Latin were delivered, one to the Cardinal,\r\nanother to the Minister of Exterior Relations, and the third to Avedick\r\nhimself.[325] A few days afterwards he was ordained priest in the\r\nchurch of Notre-Dame. This abjuration was the only means Avedick had\r\nof recovering his liberty; and, depressed by so many storms, he ceded,\r\nafter five years of close captivity, to the natural desire of breathing\r\na free air during the few remaining years that he had to live.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1711, an old man, bowed by adversity still more\r\nthan by weight of years, his countenance furrowed by deep wrinkles,\r\nhis eyesight nearly gone, might be seen every morning to leave a little\r\nhouse in the Rue Férou, where he dwelt with his interpreter.[326]\r\nHaving preserved in his attire some remnant of the Armenian costume,\r\nbeing a foreigner in language and manners, and sustaining by the aid of\r\na stick his enfeebled body, he attracted attention, and people followed\r\nhim with their glances to the church of Saint-Sulpice, to which he\r\nwas attached as priest, and where he every day said mass.[327] This\r\nwas the religious chief and civil protector of several millions of\r\nArmenians, the enemy of Ferriol and of the Jesuits, and the vanquished\r\nin the long struggle sustained against them. He did not long enjoy his\r\nliberty, but died on July 21, 1711, ten months after having quitted the\r\nBastille, without relations or friends, having demanded and received\r\nthe consolations and the sacraments of that Roman Church[328] whose\r\nardent missionaries had been the cause of all his misfortunes. Thus\r\nterminated this life, commenced in obscurity and misery, continued on\r\nthe patriarchal throne, crossed with unhoped-for elevations and sudden\r\nfalls, and completed mournfully in exile.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV., exhausting precautions, and pushing imposture and mockery\r\nto their extreme limits, had an instrument drawn up by the Lieutenant\r\nof Police d’Argenson, in which were attested the King’s sorrow on\r\nhearing of this death, and _the promptitude which the monarch had\r\nshown_ _in giving liberty to the prisoner directly the foreigner had\r\nbeen able to make it understood what his quality was_. By a singular\r\neuphemism, Avedick was termed a _disgracié_, and Louis XIV. declared\r\nthat _he had never approved the violence, and still less the crimes,\r\nwhich, unknown to his Majesty, had been committed in Turkey on the\r\nperson of the deceased_.[329] This lying document was to have been\r\nsent to Constantinople in case the Porte should reclaim Avedick in too\r\nmenacing a manner. But it was unnecessary. Several changes of Grand\r\nViziers contributed to abate the demands, and to render them less\r\npressing. At long intervals the name of the ex-Patriarch recurred in\r\nthe conversations between the Ottoman prime minister and the French\r\nambassador;[330] then, by degrees, the Divan no longer occupied itself\r\nwith it. The remembrance of Avedick was less profoundly engrafted there\r\nthan in the grateful hearts of the Armenians.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the complete _dénoûment_ of the drama. At the very\r\ntime when Ferriol’s victim was dying, he himself was returning from\r\nConstantinople insane, having been, two years since, replaced in his\r\npost, which, with an extravagant pretension,[331] he had, however,\r\nup to that time refused to quit. It was, in some measure, necessary\r\nto use force to compel him to embark.[332] For a long time he had\r\nrecognized the enormous fault he had committed, and on January 6,\r\n1709, had written to Torcy, “I know only of one thing for which people\r\ncan reproach me--it is the abduction of Avedick.”[333] But this was\r\nnot the cause of his recall, which was evidently entirely due to the\r\ntoo certain signs of his insanity.[334] It cannot be denied that\r\nLouis XIV.[335] approved the violation of the law of nations, of\r\nwhich Avedick was the victim; and if the Catholic missionaries are\r\nresponsible for having suggested this crime, as Ferriol is for the\r\norders transmitted to Chio, the government of Louis XIV. is not the\r\nless so for having prolonged and aggravated its consequences by the\r\ntreatment to which the prisoner was subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[291] Order of Louis XIV., dated from Versailles, November 10,\r\n1706:--_Correspondance Administrative du Règne de Louis XIV._, vol. iv.\r\np. 255.\r\n\r\n[292] _Gallia Christiana_, vol. xi. p. 310: “In confinio Britonum ac\r\nNormannorum, medio in mari.”\r\n\r\n[293] Such as the Sée, Célune, and Coësnon.\r\n\r\n[294] XVII. calend.

As I have nothing so much at heart\r\nas to please the Grand Vizier, I have given passports to the Armenians\r\nand a letter of recommendation for M. le Bailli de Tincourt, to the end\r\nthat they may have every sort of liberty to seek and bring here the\r\nsaid Patriarch Avedick, and return to Constantinople when it shall seem\r\ngood to them, without suffering any difficulty or impediment; but that\r\non the contrary every kind of assistance should be given to them. As,\r\nhowever, the Turks, who were slaves at Malta, asserted that the said\r\nPatriarch Avedick was going on to Rome, I beg your Eminence very humbly\r\nto render every kind of assistance to the Armenians, to facilitate\r\ntheir search for the Patriarch Avedick, and give them the means of\r\nbringing him back to Constantinople in all security.”\r\n\r\nHere is now the secret despatch:--“Pera, November 16,\r\n1707.--Monseigneur--As the two Turks have said that Avedick was\r\ngoing to Rome, I have, at the request of the Grand Vizier, given the\r\nArmenians a letter of recommendation to your Eminence. You can judge\r\nof the character of these persons. It is, however, important that\r\nthey should not be ill-treated, and, after having sought Avedick,\r\nthat they should be permitted to return to Constantinople. But all\r\ntheir proceedings ought to be watched in such a way that they can\r\nneither complain of this course nor enter on their return into new\r\nplots.”--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Turkey,\r\n45.\r\n\r\n[314] Unpublished letters from Ferriol to Pontchartrain, September\r\n1, 1706, and February 19, 1707:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, section Turkey, 45.\r\n\r\n[315] Unpublished letters from Ferriol to Pontchartrain, July 18, and\r\nSeptember 16, 1706.\r\n\r\n[316] Unpublished letters from Ferriol to Pontchartrain, June 1, and\r\nSeptember 10, 1706, and February 19, 1707. It should be remarked that\r\nit is especially after the abduction that Ferriol so vehemently accuses\r\nAvedick of terrible persecutions. Extracts from his despatches, written\r\nprevious to the abduction, and which we have given in Chapter XII. (pp.\r\n149 and 153 _ante_), show that this accusation had much less foundation\r\nthan the French ambassador wished to make believe, with the evident\r\nintention of justifying the abduction of the Patriarch.\r\n\r\n[317] Unpublished despatch from the Cardinal de la Trémouille to Torcy,\r\nJuly 21, 1708:--Archives of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Rome,\r\n491.\r\n\r\n[318] Unpublished letters from Torcy to La Trémouille, August 17,\r\nand September 6, 1708:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\nsection Rome, 484 and 492.\r\n\r\n[319] Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Rome, 492.\r\n\r\n[320] Only a very few persons at Rome knew that Avedick was in France,\r\nand even they were ignorant of the precise place where he was detained.\r\nThe other Cardinals had, with reference to this matter, only vague\r\nand inexact information, as is proved by a letter written from Rome,\r\nJuly 27, 1706, in which it is stated that Avedick was a prisoner\r\nat Messina.--Archives of the Empire, _Monuments Historiques_, xi.:\r\n_Négociations_, K 1315-1326.\r\n\r\n[321] Letter, February 14, 1707:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, section Turkey, 44.\r\n\r\n[322] Manuscripts of the Arsenal Library, Dujonca’s Journal, _Registres\r\ndes Entrées_.

Perhaps I shall utilize\r\nthem some day. But the laws of proportion prevent me from doing so\r\nhere and oblige me not to prolong this story beyond the death of the\r\nprincipal personage. After his return to France, whither he had brought\r\nthat beautiful Circassian slave, who became celebrated under the name\r\nof Mademoiselle Aissé, Ferriol lived in obscurity, much, however,\r\nagainst his will, since he did not cease soliciting being sent back to\r\nConstantinople as ambassador, and to deny his madness with a vehemence\r\nand an excess of language which made his statement seem very improbable.\r\n\r\n[332] Unpublished despatches from the King to the Count Desalleurs,\r\nambassador at Constantinople after Ferriol, September 25, 1710, and\r\nfrom the Marquis de Torcy to the same, of the same day:--Archives of\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Turkey, 48.\r\n\r\n[333] Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Turkey, 48.\r\n\r\n[334] Unpublished despatches from the King to M. de Fontenu, Consul at\r\nSmyrna, September 19, 1709; from Torcy to Ferriol, November 5, 1709;\r\nfrom the King to Ferriol, March 27, 1710:--Archives of the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs, section Turkey, 48; and from Ferriol to Torcy, May 23,\r\n1711 (_ibid._ Turkey, 49).\r\n\r\n[335] We think it unnecessary to demonstrate this after the\r\ncircumstantial account we have given. It suffices to add:--1st. That\r\nLouis XIV. paid the expenses occasioned by the abduction, which for one\r\nconsul alone amounted to 105 ounces of gold (unpublished despatches\r\nfrom Ferriol to Pontchartrain, June 25, 1706, and Nov. 8, 1707,\r\nArchives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Turkey, 45). 2nd.\r\nThat the first despatch addressed by the King to Ferriol, on October\r\n17, 1706, after the news of the abduction had arrived at Versailles,\r\nfar from conveying a reprimand, contains the following:--“Versailles,\r\nOctober 17, 1706.--I approve your attention in procuring for the\r\nChristian slaves in the Crimea the spiritual succours of which up to\r\nthe present time they have been deprived, and as you know my sentiments\r\nconcerning the protection which I wish on all occasions to accord to\r\nthe Catholic religion throughout the Ottoman empire, you can render me\r\nno more agreeable service than to continue to make the effects of it\r\nmanifest, either publicly or _by secret ways_, to all those who profess\r\nit and who find themselves oppressed by the officers of the Grand\r\nSeignior, _whether they are his subjects, or of whatever nation they\r\nmay be_, and the more violent you remark the persecution against them\r\non the part of the Vizier to be, the more attentive you ought to show\r\nyourself to procure them, with suitable caution, the assistance which\r\nthey have a right to expect from you.”--(_Ibid._ Turkey, 43.) 3rd. That\r\nin the instructions sent to Count Desalleurs, Ferriol’s successor at\r\nConstantinople, Ferriol’s conduct is approved.--(_Ibid._ Turkey, 47).\r\n4th. That Ferriol’s recall took place three years after the abduction,\r\nand was due solely to the proofs of insanity he had exhibited, and\r\nof which Louis XIV. had been informed by the chief officers of the\r\nembassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n Description of Pignerol--Its Past, its Situation--Portrait of\r\n Saint-Mars--His Scruples and his Integrity--Fouquet’s Arrival at\r\n Pignerol--Brief Account of the Surintendant’s Career--His Error with\r\n regard to Louis XIV., whom he betrays--Causes of Fouquet’s Fall--His\r\n Arrest--His Trial--His Condemnation--No kind of Obscurity in this\r\n Affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the principal personages in whom people have seen the Man with the\r\nIron Mask, we have first got rid of those imaginary beings, those\r\npretended brothers of Louis XIV., whom it was necessary to banish\r\nto the domain of fiction. Afterwards entering into that of reality,\r\nwe have studied the lives of several princes whom people have also\r\ncovered with the mysterious mask,[336] but whom we have shown as\r\ndying elsewhere than at the Bastille; as Vermandois before Courtray,\r\nMonmouth on the scaffold, and Beaufort at the siege of Candia. These\r\naccounts have been followed by the story of a great State prisoner\r\nunder Louis XIV., in whose favour very strong presumptions have been\r\nadvanced, but who was incarcerated neither at Pignerol nor at the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite, and who ended his days in liberty. Let us now\r\npenetrate with Saint-Mars into Pignerol, and among the individuals\r\nconfided to his care, let us seek which of them, confined for a long\r\ntime in this fortress, next at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, and lastly\r\nconducted to the Bastille, where he died on November 19, 1703, is\r\nreally the Man with the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the valleys of the Chisone and the Lemina, on the\r\nslope of one of those hills in which by insensible gradations the\r\ngreat chain of the Alps terminates on the side of Piedmont, there\r\narose in the form of an amphitheatre a little town which, from the\r\ntwelfth century, the Princes of Savoy had caused to be fortified for\r\nthe safety of their States, the approach to which it defended. At the\r\nsummit of the hill, formerly covered with a forest of pines, whence\r\nthe town received its name, a citadel, surrounded by fortifications,\r\nhad been constructed, which was commanded on the north alone by the\r\nmountain of Sainte-Brigitte, soon to be itself covered with redoubts\r\nand entrenchments. Having thus become a military position of the\r\ngreatest importance, and, as the key of Italy, able in turns to check\r\nor favour foreign invasions, the position of Pignerol, coveted by the\r\nKings of France, and so precious to the Dukes of Piedmont, was long\r\ndisputed by arms, or claimed by diplomacy. Captured in 1532 by Francis\r\nI. from the too feeble Duke Charles III., restored by Henry III. in\r\n1574 to Philibert-Emmanuel,[337] attacked unsuccessfully in 1595 by\r\nthe Duke de Lesdiguières, it ended in 1630 by falling into the power\r\nof Cardinal de Richelieu, who took possession of it at the head of\r\n40,000 men, and placed it under the rule of the King of France, to\r\nwhom it was destined to belong until the disasters of the latter years\r\nof Louis XIV. Richelieu, Mazarin, and Louvois contributed to render\r\nits fortifications formidable. To-day there remain only a few ruins\r\nof them, near to the cathedral of Saint-Maurice, whence there is a\r\ncharming view.[338] Very different, however, was the appearance of\r\nPignerol in 1664, the period at which Saint-Mars proceeded thither to\r\ntake possession of the donjon of the citadel, converted into a State\r\nprison.[339] On the side of the hill were to be seen the houses of the\r\ntown with their low red-tiled roofs, their slight-looking campaniles,\r\nand their chimneys in the form of turrets; here and there on certain\r\nhouses, battlements and loop-holes might be detected, the remains of\r\nsome old defence or a useful precaution against future attack. As one\r\nraised the eyes life and action were seen to gradually disappear,\r\ngiving place to the dull monotonous service of a fortified post. On the\r\nsummit wide ditches isolated the citadel from the town, whilst beyond,\r\na double line of thick walls formed a vast parallelogram flanked by\r\nfour lofty towers; along the breastworks, near the drawbridges and on\r\nthe bastions, soldiers were on guard, and in the courtyards others were\r\nlounging about; lastly, in the centre of all these fortifications,\r\nwas a large square donjon, silent yet appearing as though inhabited,\r\nand having its windows covered with iron bars. Sombre and sinister\r\nin aspect this black-looking mass towered to the skies. Such may we\r\npicture to ourselves, after the lapse of a couple of centuries, was\r\nthe dwelling of those prisoners, some celebrated like Fouquet, others\r\nmysterious like the Iron Mask, who have rendered Pignerol for ever\r\nfamous in history and legend.\r\n\r\nBetween the severe aspect of this donjon and the character of its\r\nnew commandant, there was a perfect similarity, and no one united in\r\nhimself more completely than Saint-Mars the necessary qualities for\r\nfulfilling the duties confided to him. Bénigne d’Auvergne, Seigneur de\r\nSaint-Mars, was a petty gentleman of Champagne, from the neighbourhood\r\nof Montfort-l’Amaury, when he entered the first company of the King’s\r\nMusketeers.[340] At thirty-four years of age, he had just attained\r\nthe rank of quartermaster,[341] when Fouquet was arrested at Nantes\r\nin 1661. In this affair he shared the royal confidence with his\r\nlieutenant, D’Artagnan, and whilst the latter was charged with the\r\narrest of the Surintendant, Saint-Mars had confided to him the mission\r\nof arresting Pellisson and conducting him to Angers.[342] Selected by\r\nLouis XIV., in 1664, as being capable of securely guarding Fouquet at\r\nPignerol, he was named Commandant of the donjon of this place, and\r\nCaptain of a free company.[343] He immediately proceeded to Pignerol,\r\nand from that time devoted himself to those weighty duties of gaoler\r\nwith which he was to be occupied in various prisons, and last of all\r\nat the Bastille, until his death, always with the same overpowering\r\nsense of his responsibility which made him in reality the chief of\r\nLouis XIV.’s State prisoners. He possessed the gaoler’s two principal\r\nqualifications: a discretion which was proof against everything,\r\ncombined with a distrust such as the suspicious Louvois himself had\r\noccasionally to restrain while he had but rarely to put him on the\r\nalert. He was not, like D’Artagnan, an intelligent, generous, and\r\nfrank executer of the royal will. With a somewhat narrow and extremely\r\ntimid disposition, alike taciturn and restless, one thought alone\r\npossessed and ruled him,--the servile accomplishment of the King’s\r\norders. To discuss them would have seemed a crime to him; to seek to\r\ninterpret them appeared superfluous. He answered for the prisoners\r\nconfided to his care. The height of the walls, the depth and width\r\nof the moats, the vigilance of the sentinels, the carefulness of the\r\nwatchmen, the strength of the iron gratings, did not suffice to calm\r\nthe inquietude of his suspicious mind. In endeavouring to dissipate\r\nit, he did not content himself with informing Louvois of the most\r\nminute details, the most puerile circumstances; his scruples and\r\nuneasiness were everlastingly reviving. Everything was in his eyes a\r\nmatter for suspicion, and his troubled imagination never ceased to\r\nforesee pretended plans of flight. A stranger visiting Pignerol, and\r\nregarding the citadel with a little attention, immediately became\r\nan object of suspicion to him and was arrested, subjected to a long\r\nexamination, and imprisoned for a length of time.[344] Every month\r\nhe had a list drawn up of strangers arriving in the town,[345] with\r\nthe view of noticing the names which appeared in it too frequently.\r\nThe linen of his prisoners before leaving the donjon was carefully\r\nplunged into a tub of water, and then dried at a fire in the presence\r\nof officers charged in rotation to assure themselves of the absence of\r\nall writing upon it.[346] The least change observed in the habits of\r\nthe prisoners was a source of painful worry to Saint-Mars, appearing to\r\nhim in the light of a mysterious signal designed to expedite a criminal\r\nattempt; and one day, after his usual visit and long search in the\r\nrooms of Fouquet and De Lauzun, not having been able to discover the\r\nslightest sign of anything abnormal,[347] he was at first surprised\r\nand then very much alarmed. This absence of signals doubtless seemed\r\nto him a signal of itself. For the rest, an honest man,[348] greedy\r\nof gain,[349] but seeking it only by legitimate means, insensible to\r\nthe reproaches of his prisoners, finding in the sentiment of having\r\ndone his duty sufficient strength to be able to disdain their abuse,\r\nand acting humanely on the very rare occasions when their safety\r\ndid not seem to be compromised. After having perused his frank and\r\nunaffected correspondence, in which one has a complete portrait of him,\r\none is almost tempted to pity Saint-Mars as much as his prisoners,\r\nbecause, while enjoying as little liberty as they did, he was to some\r\nextent their victim, being secretly preyed upon by the incessant and\r\npainful fear of their escape. The continual inquietude by which he\r\nwas agitated rendered him a prematurely old man, and contemporaries\r\nrepresent him as bent in figure, very thin, his head, hands, and entire\r\nbody[350] trembling; in a word, overwhelmed by the heavy burden of the\r\nresponsibility which weighed him down.\r\n\r\nIt was under the care of this man that Fouquet was to pass the last\r\nsixteen years of his life. It was with him that the imprisonment of\r\nthe Surintendant was in reality about to commence. From the day of his\r\narrest, indeed, until his arrival at Pignerol, a thousand intrigues\r\nhad been brewing around him. The threats of his enemies, the pressing\r\nexertions of his friends, by turns the danger of capital punishment\r\nand the hope of being saved, with constant changes of prison[351]\r\nand the preoccupations of the trial, had absorbed his existence and\r\nabridged the length of the four years which had elapsed. But when he\r\nfound himself at Pignerol in a chamber into which the light penetrated\r\nonly through osier-screens fixed on enormous bars of iron, waited upon\r\nby unknown individuals who were removed so soon as he endeavoured to\r\ninterest them in his misfortunes, and who were continued in his service\r\nif they consented to act as spies over him; when the only visits he\r\nreceived were those of his gaoler coming every day to carefully examine\r\nhis furniture, rummage over his effects, consult his countenance, and\r\nsurprise his thoughts; when all correspondence was forbidden him, and\r\nwhen he might believe himself for ever separated from those who were\r\ndearest to him; then, and then alone, there appeared to him in all\r\nits reality the horror of his lot, rendered still more bitter by the\r\nrecollection of past splendours. How often in his isolation did he\r\ninvoke the dazzling picture of his unprecedented fortune! How many\r\ntimes did he recount to himself the great part he had played during\r\nthe Fronde, the legitimate influence acquired over Anne of Austria and\r\nMazarin, whose devoted auxiliary he had been, so many and such high\r\nfunctions united in his own person, a great part of the court at his\r\nfeet, friends like Corneille and Molière, Madame de Sévigné, Pellisson,\r\nand La Fontaine, dwellings much more splendid than the King’s,[352]\r\na formidable fortified place for refuge,[353] an island in America\r\nfor an asylum,[354] the right of sovereignty over many towns,[355]\r\njoined to immense riches, the most ardent passions satiated, and the\r\nmost unbridled ambition satisfied: then a thunderbolt overwhelming in\r\nan instant all this greatness and precipitating the daring man into\r\nthe abyss! “There is no greater sorrow,” says Dante, “than to recall\r\nwhen in misery our time of happiness.”[356] But how much greater\r\nstill, when the eyes, at length seeing distinctly, can perceive the\r\nimprudences and the faults committed! Rendered more clear-sighted\r\nby adversity, Fouquet might remember with bitterness Louis XIV.’s\r\ngenerous conduct towards him on his taking possession of power after\r\nthe death of Mazarin. “I knew,” says the King in his _Mémoires_,[357]\r\n“that he possessed intelligence, and had a great knowledge of the home\r\naffairs of the State, which made me imagine that, provided he would\r\navow his past faults and promise amendment, he might render me good\r\nservice.” Louis XIV. sincerely desired to continue to employ Fouquet.\r\nHe conferred with him a long time, begged that he might be informed of\r\neverything, and that nothing of the true state of the finances might\r\nbe concealed from him. On these conditions he consented to forget the\r\npast, and in future to consider only the services rendered by the\r\nSurintendant entering on a legal and regular course of proceeding and\r\nforegoing further peculations.[358]\r\n\r\nBut, like many others at the court, Fouquet had deceived himself as\r\nto the character of the young King. The latter had announced his\r\nresolution to govern by himself, to preside in person over the Council,\r\nto sign everything after having seen everything, and to gradually\r\nenlighten himself upon the administration of his kingdom, with the\r\nview of always being able to direct it properly.[359] Very few had\r\nbelieved in the permanence of this resolution of a young King of\r\ntwo-and-twenty, to which, however, he was faithful till his death, and\r\neven Anne of Austria herself had derided it.[360] Conceiving himself\r\nmaster of the King’s mind through those who surrounded him, and\r\nimagining that, thanks to his numerous spies, he was acquainted with\r\nevery one of his plans; convinced, moreover, that his master, occupied\r\nwith his pleasures, would be quickly repelled by irksome labour,\r\nFouquet had persisted in his criminal conduct, and had remained deaf to\r\nthe warnings of his friends.[361] But whilst he daily presented Louis\r\nXIV. with falsified accounts, in which the expenses were increased and\r\nthe receipts diminished, Colbert, to whom they were sent every evening,\r\nexamined them carefully, indicated the embezzlements, and enlightened\r\nthe King upon the persevering audacity of his Minister. At the same\r\ntime Fouquet continued to fortify his towns, to extend his influence,\r\nto fabricate loans to the King, to secure for himself under other\r\nnames the farming of several taxes, and to appoint his creatures to\r\nthe most important offices, which he secretly bought for them in the\r\nhope of soon rendering himself the sovereign ruler of the State.[362]\r\nThis was not all. This individual, who aspired to replace Mazarin, to\r\nwhom he was so inferior, because, unlike him, he was not prompted by\r\ntrue national interests, possessed moreover only the lofty aims of the\r\nambitious, but neither tact nor clear-sightedness. With a keen mind and\r\nquick understanding, he very rapidly discerned the surface of things,\r\nbut was wanting in the Cardinal’s penetrating sagacity and depth of\r\nvision, and whilst the latter, with a less vulgar ambition, occupied\r\nhimself much more with the reality than with the semblance of power,\r\nFouquet, vain and frivolous, could not resist the puerile satisfaction\r\nof making a parade of his authority and wealth. We are acquainted\r\nwith the scandalous pomp of the fête given in the Château of Vaux,\r\n“that anticipated Versailles,”[363] with its magnificent galleries,\r\nits splendid gardens, and its shameless luxury. We have this example,\r\nthe most striking perhaps which history affords, of a man possessed\r\nwith that folly which precedes great falls, and accelerating by his\r\ninsolence a catastrophe already rendered inevitable by so many other\r\nfaults.[364]\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, nothing obscure in the causes of this catastrophe,\r\nwhatever may have been said respecting it. How it came to pass, the\r\ncircumstances which accompanied it, every one of the incidents of a\r\ntrial which lasted three years, the accusations of the prosecution,\r\nas well as the arguments of the defence, have all been brought to\r\nlight,[365] and it is impossible not to feel convinced that Saint-Mars’\r\nfirst prisoner was justly punished for acknowledged and indisputable\r\nfaults, and not for the possession of a State secret,[366] or for I\r\nknow not what hidden crime which he would have mysteriously expiated\r\nby wearing, until his death, a velvet mask. It has been pretended,\r\nwithout any authentic proof being furnished, that Louis XIV. not only\r\ndiscovered in him a powerful and wealthy rival, but that the arrest\r\nof the Surintendant was simply a piece of revenge on the part of the\r\nroyal lover of La Vallière.[367] Owing to the steadfast friendship\r\nof La Fontaine, and Madame de Sévigné, to their persistence in their\r\nillusions and to the eloquent sincerity of their complaints, Fouquet\r\nmust always have many partisans. Even among his contemporaries, the\r\ntouching devotion of his friends, the passionate attacks of some of his\r\nadversaries, and the length of his trial, induced a reaction; and while\r\nat first the indignant populace showed their exasperation against him\r\nby imprecations and threats,[368] by degrees, as often happens, public\r\nopinion changed into sympathy for the victim,[369] and to regarding his\r\njudges as persecutors. Lastly, that mysterious legend of the Man with\r\nthe Iron Mask, which some persons wish to make the climax of Fouquet’s\r\ncareer, commences, according to them, from his arrest, and the minute\r\nprecautions then taken by the King at once indicate and explain all\r\nthose of which the famous masked prisoner was later to be the object.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was naturally inclined to dissimulation. Mazarin not only\r\nset him the example of “this cunning and necessary virtue,”[370] but\r\nadvised him to practise it,[371] and never, it must be remembered,\r\nwas this counsel more strictly followed than during the few months\r\nwhich preceded Fouquet’s fall. From the time it was resolved upon,\r\nLouis XIV., aided by Colbert and Le Tellier, prepared in detail and\r\nin secret everything that could assure the punctual execution of his\r\norders and anticipate the slightest difficulty. It cannot be denied\r\nthat he lulled the Surintendant into security, and cradled him with\r\ndeceptive hopes, and that with infinite art he never treated him\r\nmore graciously than after he had decided upon his ruin. Fouquet, as\r\nProcureur-général to the Parliament, could only be judged by that body.\r\nHis acquittal would thus have been nearly certain, since he had a great\r\nnumber of partisans in it. It was therefore essential that he should\r\nresign this position[372] in order that he might be brought before a\r\nchamber of justice. It was Colbert, his ardent enemy, who ventured to\r\ngive him this pernicious advice, and who, with a skill inspired by\r\nhatred, prevailed on the Surintendant without exciting his mistrust.\r\nLouis XIV. facilitated Colbert’s task by hinting to the vain-glorious\r\nFouquet that the collar of the order and the dignity of Prime Minister\r\nwould be irreconcilable with the functions of Procureur-général.[373]\r\nAt the same time he exhibited towards him an unusual confidence, often\r\ncalled him into his presence, followed his advice, and overwhelmed his\r\nbrother, the Bishop of Agde, with favours. The grand blow of the arrest\r\nwas to be struck in Brittany, as it was thought that the presence of\r\nthe King there would render resistance on the part of the fortified\r\nplaces in the Surintendant’s power more difficult, and the idea of\r\nadvising this journey was suggested to him. The minute precautions\r\ntaken at the time of the arrest;[374] those musketeers assembled under\r\nthe pretext of a royal hunt and placed at the disposal of D’Artagnan;\r\nthe troops occupying the roads and allowing no one but the royal\r\ncouriers to pass; those long private interviews of Louis XIV., first\r\nwith Le Tellier and then with D’Artagnan;[375] the most improbable\r\nobstacles foreseen and the care taken to leave nothing to chance:\r\nall this offers, it is true, the singular spectacle of an absolute\r\nmonarch conspiring the fall of one of his subjects. But how can one be\r\nastonished at it when this subject is Fouquet, alone able to dispose\r\nof immense wealth in the midst of general distress, and counting\r\ndevoted pensioners even amongst the officers surrounding the King?\r\nHow can one be astonished, moreover, when Louis XIV. could not even\r\nplace confidence in the captain of his guards?[376] when we know that\r\nFouquet could do as he pleased with the Mediterranean fleets through\r\nthe Marquis de Créqui, general of the galleys,[377] and with those of\r\nthe Ocean through the Admiral de Neuchèse,[378] when Brittany had in\r\nsome degree become his kingdom,[379] and most of the places in the\r\nNorth had his creatures for commandants? How can one be astonished,\r\nabove all things, after having read the famous plan of resistance found\r\namong the Saint-Mandé papers,[380] a veritable plan of a civil war long\r\nmeditated, written entirely by Fouquet, and one in which he braves and\r\ndefies the authority of his sovereign? The parts to be played in the\r\nrevolt are distributed among his friends; the chiefs are designated;\r\nthe places of refuge indicated. Fouquet makes known what arms are to be\r\nemployed, what hostages it will be necessary to secure; all the means\r\nof agitation are advised. Through his two brothers, the coadjutor of\r\nNarbonne and the bishop of Agde, the clergy are to be stirred up. By\r\nmeans of certain members of the Parliament, disturbances are to be\r\nexcited in Paris, and the war of pamphlets kindled anew. By means of\r\nthe Governors, the public treasures are to be seized, and the garrisons\r\nare to be sent forth on to the highways. Lastly, supreme treason,\r\nforeign help is not to be lost sight of, and Lorraine, as well as\r\nSpain, is to be summoned to enter France.[381]\r\n\r\nSo much audacity and such an exaggerated pride sufficiently explain the\r\ndissimulation and the minute solicitude of Louis XIV., without one’s\r\nseeking the cause elsewhere. But if he matured this _coup-d’état_ in\r\nsecret, and accomplished it with a prudence, without which he would\r\nhave certainly failed, none of the crimes which rendered it necessary\r\nwere hidden from contemporaries. The preparations for the arrest\r\nwere alone mysterious. During the three following years, every one\r\nof the documents relating to the trial was presented to the judges,\r\ncommunicated to Fouquet,[382] and was the subject of long discussions.\r\nFrom this there resulted the proof of his skill in argument, but not\r\nat all of his innocence. On account of his extortions and of his plan\r\nof revolt, he had, according to the laws and customs of the time,\r\ndeserved death. The majority of his judges condemned him to banishment,\r\na punishment rightly considered too lenient by Louis XIV., who changed\r\nit into perpetual imprisonment. But long before his condemnation the\r\nnumerous _mémoires_ which the accused composed in order to defend\r\nhimself had been secretly printed by his friends,[383] and circulated\r\namong the people. There had thus been nothing ignored or left in\r\nobscurity. There is nothing imaginary or hypothetical in the account\r\nof what preceded and brought about Fouquet’s imprisonment. It is\r\nessential to establish this first of all. Let us now see if, during his\r\nstay at Pignerol, any event occurred which, sixteen years after his\r\ncondemnation, could all at once have determined Louis XIV. to simulate\r\nFouquet’s death, and to make of a captive, long since inoffensive and\r\nforgotten, that mysterious and nameless prisoner who is to come from\r\nthe Isles Sainte-Marguerite to die obscurely in the Bastille.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[336] It is needless to say that I have put on one side the numerous\r\nopinions which are not worthy of being discussed, simply because they\r\ndo not rest upon a pretext even. There was a period (that of the\r\npublic disputes between Fréron, Saint-Foix, Lagrange-Chancel, Father\r\nGriffet, and Voltaire) when to imagine a solution of this problem was\r\nin fashion, and people suggested a name without troubling themselves\r\nwith the proofs, or at least with the motives which might render this\r\nname probable. It is in this manner that two-and-twenty so-styled\r\nsolutions have been put forward. I have discussed those which concern\r\nthe brothers of Louis XIV. (son of Buckingham and Anne of Austria, son\r\nof Anne of Austria and an unknown person, son of Anne of Austria and\r\nLouis XIII., born some hours after Louis XIV.) I have subsequently\r\nrefuted the Vermandois solution, and the Monmouth, Beaufort, and\r\nAvedick. I shall content myself with simply mentioning the opinions\r\nwhich make the Man with the Iron Mask a natural and adulterine son of\r\nMarie-Louise d’Orléans, wife of Charles II., King of Spain; a natural\r\nand adulterine son of Marie-Anne de Neubourg, second wife of Charles\r\nII., King of Spain, who would have been put out of the way by Louis\r\nXIV.; a natural son of the Duchess Henriette d’Orléans and Louis XIV.;\r\na natural son of the same Princess and the Count de Guiche; a natural\r\nson of Marie-Thèrese, wife of Louis XIV. and of the negro servant whom\r\nshe had brought with her from Spain; a son of Christine of Sweden and\r\nof her Grand Equerry Monaldeschi; a son of Cromwell; a lover of Louise\r\nd’Orléans, imprisoned when she became Queen of Spain; a woman; a pupil\r\nof the Jesuits incarcerated for an abusive distich, and sent to the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite. All these opinions have, as may be seen, very\r\nlittle weight.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is proper to name the Chevalier Louis de Rohan, Master of\r\nthe Hounds, condemned to death in 1674, as a conspirator, and who,\r\naccording to one theory, had his life spared. M. Pierre Clément, in\r\nthe work which he has devoted to this individual (_Enguerrand de\r\nMarigny, Beaune de Semblançay, le Chevalier de Rohan, épisodes de\r\nl’Histoire de France_), and in chapter vi. of his curious volume, _La\r\nPolice sous Louis XIV._, has clearly established that the Chevalier\r\nde Rohan was beheaded. He was executed with his accomplices in front\r\nof the Bastille, November 27, 1674. The execution was public, and it\r\nwas impossible to have substituted any one else. It was not because\r\nno effort was made to move the heart of Louis XIV.; but Louvois was\r\nalways on the watch, and in this instance thought it desirable to\r\nrenew the severities of Richelieu. Even supposing it were possible\r\nto prove that Louis XIV. had spared the life of this conspirator, it\r\nwould also be necessary to prove that he was the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, and not merely by showing the probabilities and indicating the\r\npossibilities. Such a process, indeed, sufficed in the last century to\r\nbuild up a theory; but historical criticism in our own times is rightly\r\nmore exacting. It is essential now-a-days to establish the perfect\r\nconformity between the Chevalier de Rohan and the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, by following the former from prison to prison, from the time that\r\nhis life is said to have been spared until his death in 1703. But this\r\nis utterly impossible. One prisoner only was brought to Saint-Mars\r\nin 1674, but on _April_ 18, long before the Chevalier’s trial: this\r\nprisoner was an insignificant and obscure monk. Now we are acquainted\r\nwith all the prisoners confided to Saint-Mars since that time, we know\r\nthe causes of their imprisonment, and there is no doubt, moreover, that\r\nhe had no others. Numerous despatches attest this fact, and it has been\r\nestablished and recognized since a long time. The only doubtful point\r\nis which of Saint-Mars’ prisoners was the Man with the Iron Mask. But\r\nnot one of them has, in his existence, his age, the manner in which he\r\nwas treated, the time at which he was incarcerated, any feature which\r\nresembles the Chevalier de Rohan even in conjecture.

Saint-Mars espoused the sister of Louvois’ mistress, whose\r\nacquaintance he made, not in one of his journeys to Paris (for these\r\nwere extremely rare), but at Pignerol itself. The Sieur Damorezan (and\r\nnot De Morésant, as MM. Paul Lacroix and Jules Loiseleur have written\r\nit), muster-master at Pignerol, had two sisters, one of whom, Madame\r\nDufresnoy, became mistress of Louvois, and through his influence, lady\r\nof the bed-chamber to the Queen, while the other married Saint-Mars.\r\nThe latter had 6,000 livres (240_l._) salary, _plus_ gratuities, which\r\nwere often very considerable. He alone commanded in the donjon, and his\r\nauthority was independent of that of the Marquis d’Herleville, governor\r\nof the town of Pignerol, and of M. Lamothe de Rissan, Lieutenant of\r\nthe King in the citadel. There were, however, between the latter and\r\nSaint-Mars occasional jealousies which Louvois sought to remove, but\r\nnot always with success.\r\n\r\n[344] Unpublished letter from Saint-Mars to Louvois, May 6,\r\n1673:--Archives of the Ministry of War, vol. cccliv. fo. 214.\r\n\r\n[345] Unpublished letter from Saint-Mars to Louvois, March 17,\r\n1673:--_Ibid._, vol. cccliv. fo. 230.\r\n\r\n[346] Unpublished letter from Saint-Mars to Louvois, February 20,\r\n1672:--_Ibid._, vol. ccxcix. fo. 67.\r\n\r\n[347] Unpublished letter from Saint-Mars to Louvois, April 22,\r\n1673:--_Ibid._, vol. cccliv. fo. 193.\r\n\r\n[348] This is the testimony which Madame de Sévigné gives about him in\r\na letter dated January 25, 1675: “He was a discreet man and very exact\r\nin duty,” say the _Mémoires de D’Artagnan_.\r\n\r\n[349] An unpublished letter, written June 4, 1689, by Seignelay to\r\nSaint-Mars, who was then at the Isles Saint-Marguerite, furnishes a\r\nproof of this eagerness for gain:--Archives of Ministry of Marine,\r\n_Lettres des Secrétaires d’État_, 1689. Saint-Mars, like all the\r\ngovernors of the Bastille, left a large fortune. The profits realized\r\nin this position were, however, in no degree prejudicial to the\r\nprisoners’ nourishment, the expenses being defrayed on a very liberal\r\nfooting, as M. Ravaisson has perfectly established in his learned\r\nintroduction to the _Archives de la Bastille_, p. xxviii. _et seq._ He\r\nreceived presents from Louis XIV., one of which one day amounted to\r\n10,000 crowns (1,250_l._):--Letter from Louvois to Saint-Mars, January\r\n11, 1677.\r\n\r\n[350] _Histoire de la Bastille_ of Constantin de Renneville, vol. i. p.\r\n32.\r\n\r\n[351] Nantes, Angers, Amboise, Vincennes, Moret, Fontainebleau, the\r\nBastille.\r\n\r\n[352] Versailles was not yet built.\r\n\r\n[353] Belle-Isle.

It is the _chef-d’œuvre_ of the\r\narchitect Le Vau, and astounds one by its grand and noble proportions.\r\nThe exterior is profusely covered with sculpture, and the splendour\r\nof the interior is fully in keeping with that of the outside, the\r\ndecorations of the principal apartments having been entrusted to the\r\nmost celebrated painters of the age. The pleasure-grounds, which cover\r\nseveral hundred acres, were planted by Le Nôtre, and are laid out in\r\nstraight lines, after the usual custom of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe _mémoires_ of the time are filled with accounts of Fouquet’s fête\r\nto Louis XIV., August 17, 1661; and La Fontaine has described it both\r\nin prose and verse. Fouquet’s fall had long since been prepared by\r\nLeTellier and Colbert, and was already resolved upon when Louis XIV.\r\nwent to seat himself at his table; but the luxury of this abode and the\r\nsplendour of the reception singularly increased the irritation of the\r\nmonarch, who was well aware that it was paid for out of money of which\r\nthe State had been defrauded. Fouquet was arrested on September 5, only\r\neighteen days after this fête.\r\n\r\nThe château of Vaux, which, save the ravages of time, is still in much\r\nthe same state as Fouquet left it, is situated about four miles to the\r\nnorth-east of Melun, on the road from Paris to Meaux.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[365] See _Histoire de Colbert_, by M. Pierre Clément, vol. i.;\r\n_Mémoires sur Nicolas Fouquet_, by M. Chéruel; _La Police sous Louis\r\nXIV._, by M. P. Clément, pp. 1-61, and the Appendices to vols. viii.\r\nand ix. of M. Chéruel’s edition of the _Mémoires de Saint-Simon_, vol.\r\nviii. p. 447, and vol. ix. p. 414.\r\n\r\n[366] We shall prove this hereafter.\r\n\r\n[367] As M. Chéruel has remarked (_Mémoires sur Nicolas Fouquet_, vol.\r\nii. p. 173, note 3) the letter which is relied on in order to support\r\nthis allegation is far from authentic. It has been transcribed in\r\nthe _Manuscrits Conrart_ (vol. xi. folio, p. 152), with many other\r\nletters “which are said to have been found in Fouquet’s casket.” But\r\nwe know what took place with reference to this famous casket. Greedy\r\nof scandal, and not finding sufficient in the real letters which were\r\npublished at that time, the courtiers invented a very great number,\r\nattributing them to ladies of the court, whose names they gave. They\r\nwere collected with care, in the papers of Conrart and Vallant, and\r\nhave thus been handed down to us: (Manuscripts of the Arsenal for the\r\n_Papiers de Conrart_ and of the Imperial Library for those of Vallant).\r\nSuch was the publicity given to these letters, that at the commencement\r\nof the trial the Chancellor Séguier thought it his duty to declare\r\nto the court that they were forgeries: See M. Chéruel’s work already\r\nreferred to, vol. ii. p. 289, _et seq._, and M. Feuillet de Conches’\r\n_Causeries d’un Curieux_, vol. ii. p. 518, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[368] “Do not fear that he will escape,” said they at Angers to\r\nD’Artagnan: “we will strangle him first:”--_Journal d’Olivier\r\nd’Ormesson_, published by M. Chéruel in the _Collection des Documents\r\nInédits sur l’Histoire de France_, vol. ii. p. 99. The same hatred\r\nmanifested itself at Tours, whence it was necessary to set out with\r\nFouquet at three o’clock in the morning to escape the threats of\r\nthe people.

Without exhibiting this excessive\r\nindulgence, without going so far as to take the part of the victim\r\nagainst his judges, or to forget his errors and his faults, one cannot\r\nprevent oneself from owning that at Pignerol he nobly expiated them by\r\nhis unceasing resignation, by his firmness and by the elevation of his\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nWhen Fouquet’s mother heard of his arrest, she threw herself upon her\r\nknees, exclaiming: “It is now, O God, that I have hopes of my son’s\r\nsalvation!”[384] This prayer of a pious woman whom the grandeur of the\r\nSurintendant had never dazzled, and whom his dissipation had caused\r\nto mourn, was fully answered. If so unhappy as to survive her son and\r\nto be ignorant of none of his sufferings, her sorrow may at least have\r\nbeen softened by the thought that the prisoner of Pignerol sought\r\nconsolation in religion and study. During the early period of his\r\nimprisonment at Angers, depressed by misfortune, but sustained by the\r\nremembrance of the counsels and the virtues of his mother, he had, in a\r\ntouching letter imbued with the most pious[385] sentiments, requested a\r\nconfessor. A terrible danger encountered by him at Pignerol six months\r\nafter his arrival, and which he escaped as if by a miracle, went to\r\nconfirm him more completely in these sentiments. In the middle of the\r\nmonth of June, 1665, a thunderbolt fell upon the donjon of the citadel\r\nand set fire to the powder-magazine. A portion of the donjon was blown\r\ndown, and a large number of soldiers were entombed beneath the ruins.\r\nFouquet’s chamber was reached by the explosion. Some of the walls fell\r\nand the furniture was shattered to pieces. Saint-Mars thought that his\r\nprisoner was killed. But he was found in the embrasure of a projecting\r\nwindow, and had not even received a bruise.[386] As the repairs in the\r\ndonjon necessitated by this disaster could not be completed in less\r\nthan a year, Fouquet, by orders of Louis XIV. and Louvois,[387] was\r\ntransferred for a time to the neighbouring château of La Pérouse.\r\n\r\nHere commenced the attempts made by the prisoner, not so much to\r\nescape--he could not be mistaken as to the impossibility of succeeding\r\nin this--as to write to his mother and his wife, and to obtain from\r\nthem letters expected in vain since his departure from Paris. “I\r\nhave received the letters written by M. Fouquet,” Louvois informs\r\nSaint-Mars, July 26. “The King has seen the whole, and was not\r\nsurprised that he should do his utmost to obtain news, and that you\r\nexert all your efforts to prevent his receiving it.”[388] “To give\r\nand receive news:” such, indeed, was Fouquet’s most lively and very\r\nnatural desire. In order to satisfy it, he made the most industrious\r\nefforts and showed the most ingenious patience. With soot mixed with\r\na few drops of water he made ink, a fowl’s bone served him for a pen,\r\nand he wrote upon a handkerchief, which he afterwards concealed in\r\nthe back of his chair.[389] He managed even to compound an ink, which\r\nhe employed to cover the margin of a book with some lines of writing\r\nthat became visible only after being warmed.[390] But Saint-Mars’[391]\r\nvigilance frustrated these attempts. He soon discovered the hidden\r\nhandkerchief, and not content with sending this alone to the King,\r\nalso forwarded the clumsy implements fabricated and used by his\r\nprisoner.[392] The latter having afterwards written upon ribbons, black\r\nones only were in future given him, and his garments were, moreover,\r\nlined with stuff of the same colour. From this period he became the\r\nobject of a still closer surveillance, the proof of which we find in\r\nthe numerous letters exchanged between Louvois and Saint-Mars. Like\r\nall timorous people, Saint-Mars was absolutely wanting in the spirit\r\nof initiation, and took delight in having recourse to his chief. He\r\npossessed no ambitious desire of exhibiting his zeal, but only an\r\nimperious need of dissipating his alarms and of relieving himself from\r\nresponsibility. It did not suffice this timid gaoler to adopt the most\r\nminute precautions with respect to his prisoner. He recounted them in\r\nhis correspondence with the Minister, with the view of obtaining fresh\r\norders, or of receiving an approval which might calm his uneasiness. It\r\nwas in this spirit that he begged Louvois to authorise him to have a\r\nsalt-cellar made for Fouquet out of his two broken candlesticks.[393]\r\nIt was in this spirit also that after having prevented his prisoner’s\r\nservant from giving an alms, considering it suspicious, he consulted\r\nthe Minister on the subject, and solicited his advice.[394]\r\n\r\nThese excessive scruples sometimes caused him to be wanting in\r\nhumanity. He one day considered it necessary to ask Louvois for\r\nan authorisation to have a sick prisoner bled, and the Minister,\r\non according it twenty days afterwards, added: “Whenever such\r\ncircumstances occur, you can have [the prisoner] treated and doctored\r\nas may be needful without awaiting orders for it.”[395] The puerile\r\nquestions and the demands for fresh instructions became so frequent,\r\nthat the Minister was compelled to write to Saint-Mars: “I have\r\nreceived your two last letters. They oblige me to tell you that, as\r\nthe King has charged you with the care of Mons. Fouquet, his Majesty\r\nhas no new orders to give you to prevent his escape, or his sending or\r\nreceiving letters.”[396] This outburst is so much the more significant\r\nas Louvois, very prone and qualified to enter into the slightest\r\ndetails, and an imperious and most exacting chief, accustomed all his\r\nsubordinates to extreme deference, and to having incessant recourse\r\nto his authority. But in this case the Minister’s prejudices were\r\noutstripped, and Saint-Mars alone perhaps had the power to wear out\r\nby his pertinacity him who on ordinary occasions was most desirous of\r\nbeing consulted. Moreover, we must admit, it was the only instance in\r\nwhich the Minister manifested his displeasure. He habitually replied\r\nwith care to every detail comprised in the letters from the commandant\r\nof Pignerol, and he sometimes even rivalled him in his want of\r\nconfidence. Thus it was that in December, 1670, Fouquet, who was ill,\r\nhaving obtained authority to have a prescription drawn up by Pecquet,\r\nhis former medical attendant, Louvois sent it to Saint-Mars with these\r\nwords: “As soon as you have received it, you will make a very exact\r\ncopy. You will show the original to M. Fouquet, and you and he will\r\ncompare it with the copy which you will leave with him. You will then\r\nburn the original. By this means the said Sieur Fouquet having seen it\r\nwill have no doubt, and you having burnt it will have no anxiety about\r\nit.”[397] On another occasion, when sending a chest of tea for Fouquet,\r\nLouvois prescribed to Saint-Mars: “To empty it into another receptacle,\r\nand to take away the chest, and the paper which may be within the\r\nchest, so as to leave to M. Fouquet the said tea only.”[398] Never were\r\norders more agreeable or more faithfully executed. These precautions\r\nof Louvois encouraged Saint-Mars’ distrust, who thus found himself\r\nsupported in his conduct by that authority, most persuasive when it\r\nemanates from one above us in station, namely, example.\r\n\r\nThus stimulated in suspicions to which he naturally inclined,\r\nSaint-Mars was not slow to conceive that his means of surveillance\r\nwere insufficient. To see one’s prisoner often, to assure oneself\r\nwith one’s own eyes that he communicates with nobody, to examine\r\nwith care his furniture and effects, to multiply the difficulties\r\nof an escape, seem to constitute all the duties of a conscientious\r\nand vigilant gaoler. But the suspicious Saint-Mars was in no-wise\r\nsatisfied with these precautions. Forgetting that the prisoner’s body\r\nalone was under his care, he wished to extend his surveillance even\r\nto Fouquet’s thoughts. To attain this end he had recourse both to his\r\nconfessor and to the servant who waited upon him. Having, however, soon\r\ndiscerned the interest which the unfortunate prisoner inspired in his\r\nservant, Saint-Mars felt that he could not rely upon the sincerity of\r\nhis reports, and he attached to the person of Fouquet a second valet,\r\nwho was instructed to watch the first, and was himself the object of\r\na secret surveillance on the part of the latter.[399] As for the\r\nconfessor, to control him was impossible, and in fact would have been\r\nunnecessary. We read in the correspondence of Louvois and Saint-Mars\r\nthat “he was a good man,”[400] which is another proof how differently\r\nthe conduct of men may be appreciated. In the eyes of Louvois and of\r\nSaint-Mars Fouquet’s confessor was a _good man_, because he consented\r\nto act as a spy; because, as Fouquet wrote later to his wife, “instead\r\nof having God in view, he acted the cowardly part of making his fortune\r\nat the expense of one in trouble.” He succeeded; for Saint-Mars\r\nobtained a promise from Louvois “that he should receive a living when\r\nhe should cease to fulfil his office.”[401] The first instructions\r\ngiven to Saint-Mars authorised him to change the priest each time that\r\nFouquet desired to confess. But when they had discovered this “good\r\nman,” they abandoned henceforth this useless precaution, and Fouquet\r\nin vain requested to be allowed to make a general confession to the\r\nSuperior of the Jesuits, then to the Superiors of the Récollets and\r\nCapucines of Pignerol.[402]\r\n\r\nThese proceedings, and the non-success of an attempt made in 1669 by\r\nan old servant of Fouquet’s,[403] who endeavoured, by corrupting\r\nsome soldiers, to place himself in communication with his master,\r\ninduced the latter to give himself up entirely to study and religious\r\nmeditations. He renounced the project of communicating with his\r\nrelations and friends. The salvation of his soul and the care of his\r\nbody alone occupied his thoughts. Deprived long since of all physical\r\nexercise, and having suddenly exchanged an existence, excited by\r\ntravel, and adorned by everything that could make life attractive\r\nand sweet, for the solitude and inactivity of a prison, Fouquet had\r\nseen his health rapidly decay, and innumerable disorders seize on\r\nhim.[404] “There is not a disease to which the body is liable,” he\r\nwrote to his wife, “of which mine has not experienced some symptom. I\r\nam no sooner quit of one than it is succeeded by another, and I can\r\nbut suppose that these will only cease with my life. I should require\r\na large volume to describe my sufferings in detail, but the principal\r\none is that my stomach does not act in concert with my liver; what\r\nsuits one is injurious to the other, and, what is more, my legs are\r\nalways swollen.”... “The best thing to be done,” he says afterwards,\r\n“is to give up all care of the body, and to think of one’s soul. This\r\nis important to us, and yet we show more concern for the body.” In\r\ntruth, he gave as much attention to one as to the other. Distrustful\r\nof the surgeon of the citadel, he compounded himself the remedies\r\nwhich suited him best; and in order, no doubt, that he might avail\r\nhimself of his servant as an auxiliary, he instructed him in the art\r\nof dispensing.[405] The first books which Saint-Mars consented to\r\ngive him after having received authority to do so, were the Bible and\r\na history of France. Later, the works of Clavius and St. Bonaventura\r\nwere added; and then, by desire of the prisoner, a dictionary of\r\nrhymes.[406] Poetry to him was nothing more than a relaxation, and\r\nhe devoted himself above all to reading religious works and to the\r\nproduction of several lengthy treatises on morals. The remembrance\r\nof his former grandeur clashed in them with the impressions of his\r\nprofound fall. The Christian preoccupied with his salvation, the\r\nphilosopher enlightened by adversity, the recluse giving himself up to\r\nthe contemplation of divine things, hold in their turn a language of\r\nsublime and unchangeable serenity. One finds in almost every page proof\r\nof this resignation in disgrace, and of this contentment in affliction\r\nwhich Christianity can alone inspire. He whose haughty motto, for a\r\nlong time justified by events, had been _Quo non ascendam_, now humbly\r\nsubmissive to his lot, adopted the touching emblem of the silkworm in\r\nhis cocoon with these words: _Inclusum labor illustrat!_\r\n\r\nHowever, Fouquet was not so detached from things terrestrial as not\r\nto interest himself in them at all. His mother, wife and several\r\nchildren, being still alive, his thoughts often turned towards these\r\ndearly beloved beings, and also, but without bitterness, towards\r\nLouis XIV. and his conquests, towards the Court and the Ministers.\r\nHe often questioned Saint-Mars. The latter’s replies were brief, and\r\nso unprecise that he considered himself obliged to write to Louvois\r\nand inquire in what sense he ought to answer.[407] Entirely master of\r\nhis prisoner, sure of those who surrounded him, he believed that the\r\nbarrier which he had erected around him was insuperable, and thought\r\nthat he would be able to keep him apprised of contemporary events as\r\nhe pleased, or else leave him in the most complete ignorance. Useless\r\nefforts and vain confidence in his power! The enterprising audacity and\r\nindustrious perseverance of a prisoner recently brought to Pignerol,\r\ntriumphed over even the innumerable precautions of the most suspicious\r\nof gaolers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[384] _Mémoires de Choisy_, p. 590.\r\n\r\n[385] M.

It is one of the rare letters addressed to Colbert.\r\nSaint-Mars made some progress in orthography after this, and the later\r\ndespatches which we have of his show a rather less imperfect knowledge\r\nof the French language:--\r\n\r\n  “At Pignerol, this 13 February, 1665.\r\n\r\n“MONSEIGNEUR--I have nothing fresh to tell you; everything is going\r\non all right, in my humble opinion. I had been assured that there was\r\na man of M. Fouquet’s here in the town. I had him sought for by the\r\nmajor, he has not been found; he has not shown himself before the\r\nprisoner’s windows, and I have taken care to say everywhere that I\r\nwould not advise him to appear before the donjon, and that [if he did]\r\nit would not be a case of live and let live. I believe that this has\r\nfrightened him. I thank you very humbly, Monseigneur, for the care\r\nand kindness that you have for me. I have received, by the last post,\r\nan account for the subsistence here for the present month which I am\r\nabout to draw. My company arrived here on the 9th, and has already\r\nmounted guard. There is so much work to do here for the safety of a\r\nprisoner that I shall not be altogether settled for three weeks. M.\r\nFouquet wishes to confess every month. I have given him a confessor\r\nwho is of the household of one M. d’Amorclan, a man altogether devoted\r\nto Mgr. le Tèlier. For myself, I should approve of him; but as I have\r\nreceived orders to change him continually, I shall not allow him to\r\nconfess until I receive your commands.

He is dressed in the full uniform of\r\nCaptain of the King’s Guard--blue, with red facings. Nothing except the\r\nsword is wanting in this costume, the rich embroideries and brilliant\r\ninsignia of which offer a singular contrast to the place where it is\r\nworn. The attitude of the new comer is haughty, and his air almost\r\npatronizing. Fouquet hesitates to recognize in him a poor Gascon\r\ncadet, the Marquis of Puyguilhem, without fortune or position, who\r\nhad sometimes come to him in the days of his power to borrow a little\r\nmoney,[408] and who, extremely fortunate in having been received into\r\nthe house of the Marshal de Grammont, his relative, had cut a very sad\r\nfigure at court at the time of Fouquet’s arrest. What, therefore, was\r\nthe astonishment of the latter when his strange visitor, questioned\r\nas to the causes of his detention at Pignerol, replies that they have\r\nbeen set forth by the King in a letter addressed to all the French\r\nambassadors abroad.[409] Fouquet’s stupefaction is redoubled when he\r\nlearns that this costume is not a masquerade, and that the man whom\r\nhe had left in the lowest rank at Versailles is really Captain of\r\nthe Guard, and in addition Governor of Berri and Colonel General of\r\nDragoons, and that a brevet rank of General has been conferred upon\r\nhim. But when his visitor, continuing his confidences,[410] enumerates\r\nhis titles, and proclaims himself Count de Lauzun, Duke de Montpensier,\r\nDauphin of Auvergne, Sovereign of Dombes, Count d’Eu and de Mortaing,\r\nand, finally, husband of the Grande Mademoiselle and cousin-german of\r\nLouis XIV., Fouquet ceases to feel surprised. Everything is explained;\r\nthe speaker is mad; the tortures of a prolonged confinement have\r\nunsettled his mind, and led him to take all these fancies for real.\r\nEvery one would have thought as Fouquet did, and this supposition was\r\ncertainly the most probable one.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Lauzun, of whom La Bruyère has said, “that it is not permitted\r\nto dream as he lived,”[411] encountered, in his existence of ninety-one\r\nyears, such diversities of fortune, such striking contrasts, such\r\nunheard-of revolutions, that there are few heroes of the imagination\r\nto whom one would have dared to ascribe similar adventures. Nothing\r\nis more singular than the destiny of this Gascon cadet, reduced at\r\nfirst to beg from the Surintendant, and then raised by Louis XIV. to\r\nthe highest dignities; suddenly shut up in the Bastille and succeeding\r\nin issuing from it and marrying the legitimate granddaughter of Henri\r\nIV.; afterwards commanding an army, and next a prisoner for ten years\r\nat Pignerol; receiving his pardon, but refusing it; imprisoned for\r\nthe third time, then exiled, banished apparently for ever from the\r\npresence of the King, whom he had coarsely insulted, and nevertheless\r\nsucceeding “in finding his way back to Versailles, by passing through\r\nLondon,”[412] and there making a friend of James II.; fortune’s\r\nfavourite and victim by turns, without ever being enlightened by its\r\nrebuffs, or satisfied by its favours! To obtain these he did not\r\nhesitate at any baseness,[413] and the extreme audacity which he\r\nsometimes gave proof of was all calculated. He had a certain boldness\r\nof mind, but not of heart, for he was naturally mean. Nothing, unless\r\nit be the servile humility of his beginning, equalled the insolence\r\nwith which he avenged himself for his early abasement. Addicted to\r\ncruel raillery, prompt in witticisms,[414] he excelled in laying bare\r\nand flagellating the absurdities to which he piqued himself on being\r\nsuperior. “He is the most insolent little man,” says La Fare, “that\r\nhas been seen for a century.”[415] Devoid of dignity and endowed with\r\nprodigious pliability, he did not hesitate to stoop to the lowest\r\nparts, and succeeded in affecting the qualities in which he was most\r\ndeficient. But when, having gained his end, he threw aside the mask,\r\nand became simply himself again, he inspired contempt. Of all the women\r\nseduced by his jargon of gallantry and very deceitful appearances, he\r\ndid not attach himself to one, and the cousin of Louis XIV., over whom\r\nhe at first exercised so great a sway, died filled with hatred towards\r\nhim, and ashamed of such an unworthy husband.[416]\r\n\r\nBut, whilst Lauzun was at Pignerol, the illusions of this princess\r\nhad not yet been dissipated, and her love, increased by separation,\r\nmanifested itself in loud complaints, in violent scenes, and in\r\nattempts to deliver him. Several times she sent agents to Pignerol, who\r\nwere to try to enter into communication with Lauzun. But they failed\r\nin their enterprise, and were driven from the town and forbidden to\r\nre-enter it again.[417] On his side, Lauzun, always and everywhere\r\ndestined to adventures, did not remain inactive. He thought he\r\nmight be able to escape amidst the disorder and trouble of a fire,\r\nand with this intention set light to the flooring of his room. The\r\nfire, soon perceived, was, however, at once extinguished. Incapable\r\nof resigning himself to his lot, and of seeking some consolation\r\nin study, Lauzun, breaking his furniture, gave way to all kinds of\r\noutbursts and violence, but without succeeding in moving Saint-Mars.\r\nColdly impassible, the latter was equally insensible to the threats\r\nof vengeance and to the insults of his prisoner. It was then that,\r\nimpelled by curiosity, the latter began, this time with patience\r\nand without attracting the attention of his gaoler, to make in the\r\nwall[418] a hole which should put him into communication with the room\r\nsituated above his own. We have seen that he succeeded in this, and how\r\nhe was received by Fouquet.\r\n\r\nBy the same route, and thanks to some precautions, the visits of Lauzun\r\nwere repeated. But, in continuing his confidences, he only confirmed\r\nthe idea of his madness.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that Fouquet, without putting faith in him, heard him relate\r\nhow to all the high offices he had obtained he had almost added one\r\nstill more elevated, that of Grand Master of the Artillery, and in what\r\nmanner he had avenged his insuccess. The King had promised him the\r\nappointment, and, vain as thoughtless, Lauzun had hastened to announce\r\nit, despite the secrecy agreed upon between them. Louvois, soon\r\ninformed of the projects of Louis XIV., succeeded in diverting him from\r\nthem by representing to him the disadvantages of such a choice. After\r\nseveral days of vain expectation, the favourite, accustomed to please,\r\nand hoping to be able to intimidate, watched for and seized upon a\r\n_tête-à-tête_ with the King. He dared to call upon him to keep his\r\npromise, and Louis XIV. having replied that he was released from it by\r\nthe indiscretion Lauzun had committed, the latter drew his sword, snapt\r\nit in pieces, and exclaimed that he would no longer serve a prince thus\r\ncapable of breaking his promises. Pale with anger the King raised his\r\ncane, but, suddenly mastering himself, he threw it out of the window,\r\nsaying, “that he should be very sorry to have struck a gentleman.”[419]\r\nThe next day Lauzun was taken to the Bastille.\r\n\r\nFouquet learned from him, without believing it any the more, a still\r\nmore audacious adventure. Lauzun had soon left the Bastille, and had\r\nrecovered the King’s favour. Beloved by Mademoiselle, he obtained\r\npermission to marry her; but vanity again ruined him. Instead of\r\nhastening such an unhoped-for union, he wishes to wait, in order that\r\nsumptuous liveries may be made and that the marriage may be solemnly\r\ncelebrated in the royal chapel, in presence of the whole court, “and\r\nas between crowned heads.”[420] He thus leaves the princes and\r\nMadame de Montespan time to act, and Louis XIV., yielding to their\r\nrepresentations, withdraws the consent at first accorded. Lauzun, who\r\nwith reason distrusted Madame de Montespan, despite the assurances of\r\nfriendship she did not cease to give him, dared, in order to ascertain\r\nthe truth, to conceive a most dangerous project.[421] Taking for his\r\naccomplice the waiting-woman of the powerful favourite, he slipped\r\nunder the bed a little before the King’s arrival, and, a witness\r\nof their interview, he was able to convince himself that Madame de\r\nMontespan was the inveterate enemy to whose advice Louis XIV. had\r\nyielded. “A cough,” says Saint Simon, “the least sound, the slightest\r\naccident, might have discovered this rash being, and then what would\r\nhave become of him? These are things the relation of which stifles and\r\nterrifies one at the same time.”[422] Fortunately, Lauzun was able\r\nto remain motionless. Meeting Madame de Montespan at the ballet, an\r\nhour after the interview, he asked her in an agreeable manner whether\r\nshe had deigned to serve his cause with the King. She replied that,\r\nfar from having failed to do so, she had taken pleasure, as ever, in\r\nextolling his services. Lauzun let her speak at length; then, suddenly,\r\nplacing his mouth to her ear, he repeated to her, word for word, the\r\nconversation which she had just had with the King, and wound up by\r\ncalling her “liar, hussy, and jade.” Madame de Montespan succeeded in\r\nmastering her confusion, but she never forgot this scene, and a year\r\nafter, uniting with Louvois,[423] she had brought about the fall of\r\nthe favourite and his despatch to Pignerol.\r\n\r\nFouquet listened to the narrative of these adventures, which were only\r\ntoo real, as one reads an improbable romance. It was only much later\r\nthat he was convinced by his relations and friends of the veracity of\r\nhis companion in captivity. But during several years, not doubting his\r\nmadness, he resigned himself to listen to him out of courtesy, not\r\nseeking occasions to see him, but carefully avoiding to contradict him;\r\nbehaving, in short, toward him as one does towards an unfortunate being\r\nafflicted with a mild and harmless but obstinate mania.[424]\r\n\r\nThese two victims of fortune, reunited at Pignerol through such\r\nopposite causes, and of whom one was not to leave the place alive,\r\nwhilst the other was to quit his prison to be again the hero of\r\nsingular adventures, supported their captivity in a very different\r\nmanner. “M. Fouquet only thinks of praying to God,” writes Saint-Mars,\r\non June 20, 1672; “he is as patient and moderate as my other prisoner\r\nis furious.”[425] The outbursts of Lauzun had for their cause not\r\nonly the failure of his attempts at escape,[426] but also the very\r\narbitrary conduct of Louis XIV., inspired by Louvois. The ex-favourite\r\ncruelly expiated the favours of which he had been the object. Not\r\nsatisfied with depriving him of his liberty, they tried in addition\r\nto wrest from him the offices and the immense possessions that an\r\nexcessive generosity had heaped upon his head, but of which he ought\r\nnot to have been despoiled by means of the pressure easily put upon\r\na captive. Captain of the Body-guard, he received from Seignelay the\r\ninvitation to resign this post.[427] Endowed by Mademoiselle with\r\nthe county of Eu, the duchy of Aumale, the principality of Dombes,\r\nand the estate of Thiers, he only recovered his liberty on condition\r\nof renouncing all his possessions in favour of the Duke de Maine,\r\nnatural son of Louis XIV. and Madame de Montespan. At first he angrily\r\nrepulsed the proposition of Seignelay, and loaded with insults Louvois,\r\nwhose influence he recognized, and Saint-Mars, the interpreter of\r\nSeignelay’s orders.[428] Little by little, however, calmness returned\r\nto this spirit, till then so agitated and unquiet. Lauzun understood\r\nwith reason that everything ought to be sacrificed for liberty, and he\r\nhoped one day to be able to return to that culminating point of fortune\r\nfrom which his inconsiderate conduct had precipitated him, and which\r\nhe was in fact again to attain by a supreme effort of audacity. “At\r\ncourt one must always take one thing with another; everything comes\r\nin turn,” said Madame de Montespan to the Grande Mademoiselle.[429]\r\nLauzun ended by following this maxim, and, by resigning himself to\r\nhis lot, at length permitted Saint-Mars to taste some repose. ) The\r\nunhappy gaoler had seen himself reduced, by his excessive scruples and\r\nby the conduct of Lauzun, to the most singular extremities. Scarcely\r\nhad Fouquet renounced the hope of escape and given himself up to study\r\nand prayer, than Lauzun had come to renew and increase the inquietude\r\nof Saint-Mars. The ill-temper and despair of the new captive were such\r\nthat he behaved with the utmost violence[430] towards his gaoler. For a\r\nlong time insensible to his insults, Saint-Mars had at first submitted\r\nto them with indifference; but this was soon no longer possible, and he\r\nhad to discontinue his visits. How then was he to execute the orders\r\nreceived and exercise his surveillance? The unfortunate gaoler, too\r\nmuch ill-treated to be able to revisit Lauzun, and too scrupulous to\r\nleave off watching him, was in a state of extreme perplexity. His alarm\r\nwas increased by the impossibility of making his usual perquisitions,\r\nand he was constantly representing to himself his captive imagining\r\nand realizing a project of escape. He at length released himself from\r\nthis intolerable situation, but at what a price! For a long time\r\nthe subordinate officials of Pignerol perceived their chief gliding\r\nstealthily amongst some trees that surrounded the donjon. Then choosing\r\nthe highest and thickest in leaf,[431] overcoming the infirmities of\r\nage, and recovering for an instant the vigour of youth, he clasped the\r\ngnarled trunk, climbed by degrees to the highest branches, and there,\r\nhidden by the foliage, kept his eyes eagerly fixed upon Lauzun’s room,\r\nfrom which coarse insults had banished him. From this elevated point he\r\nobserved the prisoner’s conduct without being seen by him,[432] and\r\nthus reconciled the duties of his office with the exigencies of his\r\ndignity. Surely never did a servant better merit the confidence of his\r\nmaster; and Saint-Mars will remain without a rival amongst the gaolers\r\nof all times.\r\n\r\nThis post of observation ceased to be impenetrable, as Louvois had\r\nforeseen: “As the leaves have now fallen,” he wrote to Saint-Mars,\r\nNovember 10, 1675, “you will no longer be able to see what M. de\r\nLauzun does in his room.”[433] But this fatiguing surveillance was\r\nthen rendered less necessary by the resignation and calmness of the so\r\nlong indocile captive. His submission to the orders of Louis XIV., the\r\nproofs of a piety, more or less sincere;[434] the entreaties of Madame\r\nde Nogent, his sister, and of several friends, obtained for Lauzun the\r\nsame favours that, for several years past, Fouquet had owed to the\r\naccession to power of his friend Arnauld de Pomponne, and doubtless\r\nalso to the increasing influence of Madame de Maintenon.[435]\r\n\r\nSince 1672 Fouquet had had permission to receive a letter from his\r\nwife.[436] Less than two years afterwards he had been allowed to write\r\ntwice a year to his family.[437] Finally, from January 20, 1679, the\r\nfavours were multiplied, and the two illustrious captives obtained\r\nall that could soften their situation. Louis XIV. authorised them to\r\nhave full liberty to meet, to take their meals, and to walk together,\r\nto converse with the officers of the donjon, and to read all kinds of\r\nbooks and gazettes.[438] Whilst Madame de Nogent and the Chevalier de\r\nLauzun received permission to come and visit their brother; Fouquet\r\nhad at length the happiness of seeing his wife, his daughter, the\r\nCount de Vaux, his son, and the Bishop of Agde and M. de Mézières, his\r\nbrothers.[439] Alone and isolated for fifteen years, the Surintendant\r\nhad at last this supreme consolation, which, alas! he was not long to\r\nenjoy. These different members of his family made a rather lengthened\r\nstay at the citadel. But the prisoner’s daughter installed herself\r\nthere in a definite manner, and took up her quarters in rooms directly\r\nover those of her father.[440] Almost immediately after her arrival,\r\nLauzun and Fouquet ceased to visit one another.[441] The cause of this\r\nsudden misunderstanding is to be found in the gallant disposition and\r\nenterprising audacity of Lauzun. The insolent favourite could not\r\nrecognize the devotion of Fouquet’s daughter, a voluntary prisoner,\r\nand the touching victim of her filial affection. What passed between\r\nthese three personages can only be surmised, for no documents exist\r\nrespecting it. It is only known that, long afterwards, Lauzun paid\r\nsuch frequent visits to Mademoiselle Fouquet in Paris, during which he\r\nshowed himself so familiar, that the jealousy of Louis XIV.’s cousin\r\nwas very strongly aroused.[442] It was the destiny of the Surintendant\r\nto undergo every misfortune, and, at the moment when he seemed about to\r\nreceive some alleviation, to find suddenly in his daughter’s presence a\r\nnew source of grief and bitterness.\r\n\r\nWas this grief at least the final one? did he die on March 22, 1680,\r\nas has been said, or, to this expiation of his faults courageously\r\nundergone during sixteen years at Pignerol must a still longer one be\r\nadded? Did Fouquet continue to drag on his miserable existence for\r\nanother twenty-three years, and was it to the Bastille that he went to\r\nfinish it obscurely, dead to all, his face hidden from the world, and,\r\nas it were, surviving even himself?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[408] _Mémoires de Brienne_, vol. ii. pp. 195-197. _Mémoires sur\r\nNicolas Fouquet_, vol. ii. p. 237.\r\n\r\n[409] In this letter Louis XIV. thought it right to explain why,\r\nafter having authorised the marriage of Lauzun with Mademoiselle, he\r\nhad withdrawn his word.

Lacroix--Oblivion into which the\r\n Surintendant had fallen--Two mysterious Arrests.\r\n\r\n\r\nA writer of much knowledge and much imagination, M. Paul Lacroix, has\r\ncollected, in a very ingenious and cleverly written work,[443] all the\r\narguments that can be advanced in favour of the theory which makes\r\nFouquet the Man with the Iron Mask. He begins by reminding us of the\r\ndiscovery, announced on August 13, 1789,[444] of a card found amongst\r\nthe papers of the Bastille, bearing these words: “Fouquet, arriving\r\nfrom the Isles Sainte-Marguerite with an Iron Mask,” and signed with\r\nthree X’s and the name of Kersadion. Nevertheless, M. Lacroix very\r\nproperly abstains from counting amongst his proofs a paper, the\r\nexistence of which is not certified by any official document, and which\r\nthe wording, the strange manner in which it is said to have been found,\r\nand the improbability of any note of this character having been made,\r\nmust equally cause to be rejected. The following are the more solid\r\nbases of M. Lacroix’s argument:--\r\n\r\n“The precautions employed in guarding Fouquet at Pignerol resemble in\r\nevery point,”[445] says he, “those adopted later for the Man with the\r\nIron Mask at the Bastille and at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite.\r\n\r\n“The greater number of the traditions relating to the masked prisoner\r\nappear to apply to Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“The appearance of the Man with the Iron Mask followed almost\r\nimmediately upon the pretended death of Fouquet in 1680.\r\n\r\n“This death of Fouquet in 1680 is far from being certain.\r\n\r\n“Finally, political and private reasons may have determined Louis XIV.\r\nto cause him to pass for dead, in preference to getting rid of him by\r\npoison or in any other manner.”\r\n\r\nThese two last arguments are the only ones which need be discussed; for\r\nthe circumstantial care, excessive vigilance, and incessant precautions\r\nof which Fouquet was the object at Pignerol were not peculiar to\r\nthis prisoner. Lauzun was treated in absolutely the same manner. The\r\ninstructions given to Saint-Mars every time a new prisoner, even the\r\nmost obscure, was confided to his care were identical. On July 19,\r\n1669, when announcing the approaching arrival of that Eustache d’Auger,\r\nwho was to become Fouquet’s lackey, Louvois wrote to Saint-Mars as if\r\nthe fortune of the State was bound up with this man.[446] When, later,\r\nsome Protestant ministers, as unknown as they were harmless, are sent\r\nto him at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, there are the same detailed\r\nand complete precautions set forth at length, and equally dear to the\r\ncircumstantial Minister[447] who enjoined them, and the scrupulous\r\ngaoler charged with their execution.\r\n\r\nAs to the “traditions relating to the masked prisoner,” which appear to\r\nM. Lacroix “to apply to Fouquet,” we have seen[448] that the greater\r\nnumber of them are legendary, and that the others, such as the episode\r\nof the silver dish thrown from a window, concern several Protestant\r\nministers, confined at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite at almost the same\r\ndate as the Man with the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nFinally,--and we will establish this further on,--nothing whatever\r\nproves that the appearance of the Man with the Iron Mask dates from the\r\nyear 1680.\r\n\r\nBut if Fouquet did not die in March, 1680,--if, above all, Louis XIV.\r\n“had political and private motives for compassing the disappearance\r\nof the Surintendant by a supposititious death,” it is incontestable\r\nthat the theory of M. Lacroix would have a strong chance of being\r\naccepted, since it would show what had become of this personage while\r\nit explained in a very probable manner the mystery, exaggerated by\r\ntradition, but nevertheless true, by which the famous masked prisoner\r\nwas surrounded. This has been perfectly understood by M. Lacroix, who\r\nhas first applied himself to contest the death of Fouquet in 1680, and\r\nthen to seek out the different causes that may have determined Louis\r\nXIV. to suddenly separate the Surintendant from the rest of the world,\r\nand to make the prolongation of his life a mystery impenetrable to all\r\nexcept Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\nOf these causes, those which date beyond 1680 must be peremptorily\r\nrejected. They could not, in fact, have exercised any influence upon\r\nFouquet’s fate, since we have just seen this prisoner pass by degrees\r\nfrom a very close and somewhat harsh confinement to a captivity much\r\nsoftened by favours incessantly multiplied. From 1665 to 1672 he is\r\nforbidden all communication, even with his relations; but from 1672\r\nsome occasional letters are first authorised, then a more regular\r\ncorrespondence, next daily intercourse with the other prisoners, and,\r\nfinally, the visit and the prolonged stay of several members of his\r\nfamily at Pignerol. This progress, slow, but continuous, incontestably\r\nexists in the period extending from 1672 to 1680. It is, therefore,\r\nonly in this last year that the origin of the terrible royal anger\r\nand of the frightful increase of punishment suddenly inflicted upon\r\nFouquet is to be sought for. M. Lacroix has neglected this essential\r\ndistinction, and has gathered together all the grievances, real or\r\npretended, of Louis XIV., without taking into consideration their\r\nancient date and the evident proofs of indulgent forgetfulness of the\r\npast successively shown to the offender. It was, therefore, superfluous\r\nto remind us[449] of the secret negotiations of the Surintendant with\r\nEngland, of his projects for rendering himself independent, and of\r\nretiring, in case of disgrace, to his principality of Belle-Isle, which\r\nhe caused to be fortified; of his eagerness to gain creatures, whom\r\nhe bought at any price, by appointing them to important offices and\r\ngiving them secret pensions; or of his pretended love for Madamoiselle\r\nde la Vallière. With regard to all these faults the royal resentment\r\nwas appeased, and it cannot be admitted that their recollection may\r\nhave suddenly irritated Louis XIV., when for eight years he had\r\nbeen manifesting towards the prisoner a clemency more obvious and\r\nefficacious.\r\n\r\n“Fouquet, a prisoner at Pignerol,” says M. Lacroix,[450] “still excited\r\nhatred in Colbert and continual apprehensions in Louis XIV.: _one would\r\nhave said that he possessed some great secret, the disclosure of which\r\nwould be fatal to the_ _State_, or at least mortally wound the King’s\r\npride.” But upon this hypothesis, how was it that Louis XIV. authorised\r\nthe frequent intercourse of Fouquet with Lauzun, and afterwards with\r\nthe different members of his family? How was it that he was not afraid\r\nlest these should become participators in and afterwards propagators\r\nof this State secret? M. Lacroix enumerates all the precautions taken\r\nby Saint-Mars during the first period of Fouquet’s detention, in order\r\nto hinder him from imparting or receiving intelligence. But three\r\nsignificant despatches show that these precautions, very minute indeed,\r\nwere only inspired by the fear of an escape, and not at all by the\r\napprehension of the spreading of a State secret. Three times, and for\r\ndifferent causes, Fouquet’s valets were dismissed. They were sent away,\r\none in 1665, another at the end of the following year, and the third in\r\n1669--that is to say, when the Surintendant was in close confinement.\r\nWhat became of these three persons, who for a long time had lived with\r\nthe prisoner and been in a position to receive his confidence? Were\r\nthey ever deprived of their liberty in order to bury with them this\r\nsecret, which they may have had the misfortune to become acquainted\r\nwith?\r\n\r\n“I write you this letter,” says Louis XIV. to Saint-Mars,[451] “to tell\r\nyou that I deem it good that you should give the Sieur Fouquet another\r\nvalet, and that after the one who is ill is cured, you are to let him\r\ngo where he pleases, and the present letter being for no other end, I\r\npray God to take you into his holy keeping.”\r\n\r\n“Your letter of the 28th of the past month,” writes Louvois to\r\nSaint-Mars,[452] “has been delivered to me, and has informed me that\r\nthe valet of the Sieur Fouquet is afflicted with a very dangerous\r\nillness. It is well to continue to have him nursed, and if, after his\r\ncure, he does not wish to continue his services to the prisoner any\r\nlonger, prudence ordains that you should keep him in the donjon three\r\nor four months, in order that if he has transgressed his duty, time may\r\nfracture the measures he may have concerted with Monsieur Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“His Majesty leaves it to you,” he writes to Saint-Mars in 1669,[453]\r\n“to act as you please with respect to La Rivière, that is to say, to\r\nleave him with Monsieur Fouquet or to remove him; his Majesty counting\r\nthat, in case you remove him, you will only let him depart after an\r\nimprisonment of from seven to eight months, in order that, if he had\r\ntaken measures to carry news from his master, it would be so stale by\r\nthat time, that it could cause no annoyance.”\r\n\r\nWe see from these despatches that if, during the sixteen years he\r\npassed at Pignerol, Fouquet was the object of styles of treatment which\r\ndiffered greatly, it was never impossible for him to render other\r\npeople depositaries of his secrets, and through them to communicate\r\nthese secrets to his friends, his relations, or foreign sovereigns,\r\nas well as to the great lords of the court. He could have done this\r\nin 1665, in 1666, and in 1669, by means of his servants detained only\r\na few months as prisoners and then dismissed without conditions. He\r\ncould have done it later still more easily through the medium either of\r\nLauzun or of all those who came to visit him. One must therefore reject\r\nthe idea that Fouquet was the possessor of a dangerous State secret,\r\nand moreover, necessarily conclude from the much more humane conduct of\r\nLouis XIV. towards the Surintendant, that the King’s former resentment\r\nhad disappeared, and that in 1680 he no longer saw in the prisoner\r\nanything but an old man, very interesting both by his misfortunes and\r\nhis resignation.\r\n\r\nBut M. Lacroix invokes something else besides reasons of State;\r\naccording to him, the last and the most powerful of Louis XIV.’s\r\nfavourites was interested in the Surintendant’s disappearance. Formerly\r\nthe latter’s mistress, when she was the wife of Scarron, at the moment\r\nof her marriage with the King she had exacted from him an increase of\r\nrigour towards this troublesome Surintendant, that awkward witness of\r\nher former weaknesses.\r\n\r\nWill that which Madame de Sévigné calls “the first volume of Madame\r\nde Maintenon’s life,”[454] always remain a mystery? and shall we\r\nnever know the exact beginning of this illustrious _parvenue_ who\r\ndesired to be an enigma for posterity?[455] Like all those who have\r\nhad the honour to meet with eager detractors, she has found defenders,\r\nunreasonable without doubt, but who have shown the injustice[456] of\r\nthe passions excited against the ex-Huguenot converted to Catholicism,\r\nand afterwards wife of Louis XIV., at the moment of the Revocation of\r\nthe Edict of Nantes and the persecution of the Jansenists. It is the\r\nexaggeration of the attack, it is the violence of Saint-Simon, of the\r\nPrincess Palatine, and of La Fare, rather than any sudden attraction,\r\nthat has produced this change in public opinion, this current, general\r\nto-day and highly favourable to Madame de Maintenon. Her rehabilitation\r\nwas so necessary that every one has given his adhesion, but only from\r\na feeling of justice. In learning to know her better one has ceased to\r\ndespise her, without loving her any the more, and one has conceived\r\nmuch more esteem for her mind than inclination for her person. Never,\r\nin fact, even when looking back through ages, does one experience\r\nvery powerful feelings on behalf of those who were deficient in\r\nthem, and dry, cold virtue, without the passion that animates, and\r\nthe struggle that vivifies it, will always lack admirers. Madame de\r\nMaintenon not only appears austere and inflexible, but everything\r\nwith her is conventional and calculated. Her piety is not ardent in\r\nits outbursts, like La Vallière’s, but restrained and deliberate, and\r\nher scruples always turn to the advantage of her fortune. Not false,\r\nbut of consummate prudence; not perfidious, but always ready, if not\r\nto sacrifice, at least to abandon her friends; loving the appearance\r\nof good as much as good itself; without imagination, and consequently\r\nwithout illusions, this woman, superior by the intellect much more\r\nthan by the heart, was armed against all allurements, and the fear of\r\ncompromising her reputation placed her beyond all perils. “There is\r\nnothing more clever than an irreproachable conduct,” said she. This\r\nsentence paints her perfectly, and allows one to penetrate to the\r\nbottom of her soul. It explains and enlightens the whole of her life,\r\nand by its aid one can understand how this woman managed to live amidst\r\nthe dangers of a light and frivolous society without succumbing,\r\ntraverse youth without experiencing its temptations, undergo poverty\r\nwith honour, hold her own at court, be constant mistress of herself,\r\nand end by irrevocably securing in the heart of the King a place which\r\nneither La Vallière, despite her disinterested devotion, Fontanges,\r\ndespite her powers of fascination, nor Montespan, despite her\r\nlegitimated children, had known how to preserve. To a sound judgment,\r\nto a dignity imposing, but devoid of arrogance, to that marvellous art\r\nof being queen without appearing to pretend to it, and of receiving\r\nthe homage of the court with quite a Christian humility; to all these\r\nqualities, by which, as Louis XIV.’s wife, she showed herself worthy\r\nof her destiny, Madame de Maintenon had added, from her most tender\r\ninfancy, that proud desire “for a good reputation,” in which lay her\r\nstrength. “This was my hobby,” she said later.[457] “I did not trouble\r\nmyself about riches; I was infinitely above interest. But I wished for\r\nhonour. I did not seek to be loved privately by any one whatever. I\r\nwanted to be loved by everybody.”\r\n\r\nNothing indicates that her firm and decided will ever failed in\r\ncarrying out this proud engagement, undertaken in early life with\r\ncoolness and resolution. For a Saint-Simon and for a Ninon de\r\nLenclos, who incriminate her conduct, there are many less suspicious\r\nwitnesses who come forward in her favour. “We were all surprised,”\r\nsays the Intendant Basville, “that any one could unite such virtues,\r\nsuch poverty, and such charms.” M. Lacroix[458] invokes that note\r\ntranscribed by Conrart, said to have been found in Fouquet’s casket,\r\nand to have been written to him by Madame de Maintenon: “I do not\r\nknow you enough to love you, and if I knew you perhaps I should love\r\nyou less. I have always avoided vice, and I naturally hate sin. But I\r\nconfess to you that I hate poverty still more. I have received your\r\nten thousand crowns. If you will bring me another ten thousand in two\r\ndays, then I will see what I have to do.” But besides the fact that\r\nConrart ascribes to Madame de la Baulme this letter, the terms of\r\nwhich also contrast singularly with Madame de Maintenon’s style,[459]\r\nwe know from positive proofs what were the relations both of Scarron\r\nand his wife with the family of Fouquet. If some doubts may exist with\r\nrespect to Villarceaux, whom Saint-Simon and Ninon de Lenclos make\r\nMadame de Maintenon’s lover, no one can fail to recognize the perfect\r\npropriety and the dignity she exhibited in accepting the benefits of\r\nthe Surintendant. It is always to Madame Fouquet that she addresses\r\nherself; and when the latter, charmed by so much intelligence, wishes\r\nto have the wife of Scarron near her, she rejects with marvellous tact\r\na proposition full of perils both to her virtue, and, above all, to\r\nher good fame.[460] One day, however, she was obliged, on account of\r\nScarron’s infirmities, to go herself to solicit Fouquet “But,” says\r\nMadame de Caylus (and Mademoiselle d’Aumale confirms the accuracy of\r\nthis account), “she affected to go there in such great negligence that\r\nher friends were ashamed of taking her. Every one knows what M. Fouquet\r\nwas then, his weakness for women, and how much the highest sought to\r\nplease him. This conduct, and the just admiration that it excited,\r\nreached even the Queen’s ears.”[461]\r\n\r\nExtreme reserve towards the Surintendant, and affectionate gratitude\r\ntowards Madame Fouquet, such were, we see, the sentiments of Scarron’s\r\nwidow; and far from having to cause a weakness to be forgotten, Madame\r\nde Maintenon had, on the contrary, to remember the kindnesses of this\r\nfamily, and for her part to contribute to the alleviation of the\r\nprisoner’s lot.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in a very vague manner, and without furnishing any positive\r\nproofs, M. Lacroix reminds us that Fouquet was mixed up in those\r\nfamous poisoning trials which revealed so many monstrous scandals and\r\nimplicated certain great personages of the court, in which, too, we see\r\nthe audacity of the crimes still further increased by the revolting\r\ncynicism of the avowals, and which produced a profound commotion\r\nthroughout the whole of France and even abroad.\r\n\r\nThat Fouquet’s name may have been pronounced during the discussions,\r\none is not prepared either to contest or feel surprised at. As his\r\nenemy, Colbert, was one of the appointed victims, and as a conspiracy\r\nseemed to have been formed to poison him, it is very natural that\r\nthe accused persons should have invoked the recollection of the\r\nSurintendant. But how many other names, such as those of La Fontaine\r\nand Racine, were indicated to the lieutenant of police without their\r\nreputations being tarnished by it! M. Lacroix, with reason, regrets\r\nthat most of the papers relating to this dark business have not been\r\npublished. They are about to be, and not one of the innumerable\r\ndocuments relating to these various trials authorises us to accuse the\r\nSurintendant.[462] As for those which have already been published,\r\nand which include some declarations concerning Fouquet, an attentive\r\nexamination of the period at which they have been made proves that they\r\ncould have exercised no influence upon the fate of the prisoner of\r\nPignerol. “The woman Filastre said at the torture, that she had written\r\na contract by which the Duchess de Vivonne desired the restoration\r\nof M. Fouquet and the death of M. Colbert.” But this declaration was\r\nmade some months after the Surintendant’s death.[463] We have a letter\r\nfrom Louvois to the lieutenant of police, La Reynie, in which the\r\nlatter is thanked for having informed the King “what one named Debray\r\nhas said of the solicitation that was made to him by a man dependent\r\non Fouquet;”[464] but this letter is dated June 17, 1681, fifteen\r\nmonths after the death, or, if it is preferred, the period at which\r\nLouis XIV. had determined upon causing the Surintendant to disappear.\r\nWould the revelations of the Marchioness de Brinvilliers be relied\r\nupon by preference? But her trial dates from 1676, and if Fouquet had\r\nbeen seriously compromised at that time, wherefore those successive\r\nalleviations of his punishment during a period of four years?\r\n\r\nIn any case, if on such interested and doubtful depositions it be\r\nadmitted that Fouquet’s friends were the counsellors and accomplices of\r\na crime,[465] I can understand that, struck with the coincidence,--not\r\nprecisely exact, as we have just seen--between these accusations and\r\nthe Surintendant’s death, the suspicion might arise that the latter\r\nwas not a natural one. M. Pierre Clement, in his work, _La Police sous\r\nLouis XIV._, has expressed this idea with extreme circumspection, and\r\nhas contented himself with uttering a doubt. He accuses no one, as he\r\nis especially careful to declare. But he observes that the period at\r\nwhich Fouquet’s death occurred rendered it an untoward[466] event. He\r\nsuccumbed to an attack of apoplexy, and the nature of this complaint\r\nwould go far to accredit the theory of poison; but there conjectures\r\nought to stop. Let people hesitate to believe that he was really\r\nseized with an attack of this nature: I can conceive their doing so,\r\nalthough numerous reasons combine to make us place credence in it. But\r\neverything is entirely opposed to the hypothesis of his death[467]\r\nbeing simulated by Louis XIV.’s orders; and whether it was natural, or\r\nwhether it was hastened by a crime, it is unquestionably true that it\r\nreally took place in the month of March of the year 1680.\r\n\r\nWas it, in truth, a man in a good state of health who suddenly\r\nsuccumbed? It was an old man, who had been ailing for the last sixteen\r\nyears--a man unsettled by excess of blood[468]--a man whom the absence\r\nof every kind of exercise had rendered plethoric, and who, from a busy\r\nlife and one given up for a long time to pleasure, had suddenly passed\r\nto the privations and the inaction of captivity.\r\n\r\nWas it a prisoner, malignant and full of strong resentment, who was\r\nsuspected of having instigated his friends to poison Colbert? No,\r\nindeed. It was the most patient and the most resigned of captives,\r\nwho had expiated his faults by the most admirable behaviour, who had\r\npardoned his enemies, and whose mind, detached from the good things\r\nof the world, was raised to the contemplation of things divine,\r\nand who, offering his own life as an example, had devoted his long\r\nleisure to erecting a monument of his piety for the edification of his\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nDid he die mysteriously, without witnesses, save a gaoler capable of\r\na crime? It was in the presence of the Count de Vaux, his son, and\r\nof his daughter,[469]--it was in their arms that he yielded up his\r\nbreath. Saint-Mars, whom all his contemporaries represent to us as\r\na perfectly upright man, was the sole intermediary between the King\r\nand his prisoners. Lastly, when the news of his death arrives at the\r\ncourt, Louis XIV. immediately causes an order to be transmitted to his\r\nrepresentatives at Pignerol “to give up Fouquet’s corpse to his family,\r\nin order that they may have it transported whither it may seem good to\r\nthem.”[470]\r\n\r\nThese are decisive and material considerations, the value of which\r\ncannot be destroyed by that crowd of secondary arguments which M.\r\nLacroix has gathered up into a heap, and put forward with very great\r\nskill. But will even these resist a strict investigation? Can one\r\nbe astonished that the accounts of Fouquet’s death furnished by his\r\nfriends, separated from him for so long a time,[471] should differ\r\nfrom one another? Is it astonishing that some should attribute his\r\ndeath to suffocation, others to a fit, when we know that pulmonary\r\napoplexy is always accompanied by suffocation? Must we consider\r\nas significant the uselessness of the researches made at Pignerol\r\nby a learned Piedmontese,[472] when he himself explains it by the\r\nsuppression of the convent of Sainte-Claire, in which the body of\r\nFouquet was placed for the time being, by the alterations which have\r\ntaken place in the church,[473] and the dispersion of papers[474]\r\nbelonging to this monastery? Lastly, is there anything strange in\r\nthe silence of La Fontaine, in the laconism with which the _Gazette_\r\nand _Le Mercure_ announce Fouquet’s death, and in the absence of an\r\nostentatious inscription in the chapel of the Convent des Filles de\r\nla Visitation, to which his body was carried? Twenty years had passed\r\naway since the fall of the Surintendant. But in how much shorter space\r\nof time are services forgotten! In the especially fruitful period\r\nfrom 1660 to 1680, other and more illustrious names had filled the\r\nworld’s stage and usurped fame. In that court which he had dazzled\r\nwith his splendour, Fouquet had long since been forgotten, and only a\r\nfew friends sympathized with his misfortunes. If he who has lent such\r\ntouching language to the nymphs of Vaux was silent, if the death of his\r\nbenefactor inspired him with no theme, it was not because he declined\r\nto believe in it. But rather than suppose him insensible to it, will it\r\nnot be better to explain his silence as the result of indolence, and\r\nabandon the thought that La Fontaine was indifferent to Fouquet’s death?\r\n\r\nIf the real sentiments experienced under these circumstances by the\r\nfabulist are unknown to us, if the end of him who for so long kept a\r\nportion of the court at his feet occurred almost unperceived, he had at\r\nleast the honour of being mourned by Madame de Sévigné, who was always\r\nfaithful,[475] and the consolation of being surrounded by his family on\r\nhis death-bed; while even Saint-Mars himself must have regretted this\r\ninoffensive and resigned prisoner. A short time after Fouquet’s death\r\nLauzun was liberated.\r\n\r\nBut a year previous to this a few dragoons, commanded by an officer\r\nmysteriously despatched to Pignerol, had left the citadel during the\r\nnight and taken the road to Turin. Halting at an isolated inn, far\r\nfrom any other habitation, and situated a short distance from the\r\nlittle river Chisola, they penetrated inside the house and concealed\r\nthemselves with such care that their presence could not be detected.\r\nVery early the next morning a carriage containing three persons, two of\r\nwhom were priests, hastily set out from Turin. Arrived at the banks of\r\nthe stream, which was swollen by the rains, the travellers were obliged\r\nto dismount and traverse the torrent by means of some planks hurriedly\r\nput together. They then entered a room of the inn. Not long afterwards\r\nthe armed dragoons made their way into this room and seized one of the\r\ntravellers. An hour subsequently a carriage, surrounded by a cavalry\r\nescort, quitted the inn and conducted the prisoner to Pignerol. Three\r\ndays later another stranger arrived in his turn at this fatal house.\r\nImmediately surrounded and seized by the same dragoons, posted in the\r\nsame spot, he was also thrown into a carriage and rapidly whirled off\r\nto Pignerol.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[443] _Histoire de l’Homme au Masque de Fer_, by M.

But I confess that the last interview\r\nI had with you charmed me.

Pierre Clément, _La Police sous Louis XIV._, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[464] _Ibid._ p. 222.\r\n\r\n[465] A councillor to the Parliament named Pinon-Dumartray, a relation\r\nof Fouquet’s, was suspected of having been connected with the Sieur\r\nDamy, who was accused of a plot against Colbert’s life.\r\n\r\n[466] M. Pierre Clément, _La Police sous Louis XIV._, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[467] In support of this opinion, M. Lacroix (in the work already\r\nreferred to, pp. 251, 252) speaks of a letter written by Louis XIV.\r\nto Pope Clement X., in which he requested him “to grant him a secret\r\ndispensation in order that he might rid himself, without form of trial,\r\nof a man, dangerous and hurtful to his government.” M. Lacroix adds\r\nthat “Clement X. was probably opposed to the death of the prisoner at\r\nPignerol.” But M. Lacroix does not give this very strange letter of\r\nLouis XIV.’s, which he terms the keystone of his theory, contenting\r\nhimself with observing: “This letter, so strange that people would wish\r\nto deny its existence, is among the manuscripts in the _Bibliothèque du\r\nRoi_. M. Champollion-Figeac, who discovered it three years ago among\r\nthe _papiers de Bouillaud_, told me the tenour of it at that time, at\r\nthe very moment I was setting off on a long journey. But unfortunately\r\nhe forgot to take a note of the volume containing this singular paper,\r\nand since my return he has in vain sought to find it again. The learned\r\nM. Libri also remembers having seen this precious document.”\r\n\r\nThe following is the truth about this letter and the origin of the\r\nremarks of MM. Champollion-Figeac and Libri. It is in the _recueil\r\nBouillaud_, Manuscripts of the Imperial Library, SF 997, vol. xxxiii.,\r\ncatalogue, that this seventeenth-century collector speaks of a letter\r\n“in which the Cardinal de Richelieu begged the King to demand from the\r\nPope a brief allowing him to put to death, without any form of trial,\r\nthose whom he considered deserving of it, a request which Pope Urban\r\nVIII. refused.” M. P. Clément has already quoted this extract in note\r\n2, p. 222 of his _Police sous Louis XIV._\r\n\r\nM. Lacroix will thus see that his letter does not concern Louis XIV.,\r\nClement X., and Fouquet, but rather Louis XIII., Urban VIII., and some\r\nunknown victims.\r\n\r\n[468] Most of the complaints that Fouquet mentions in his letters are\r\ndue to a too great abundance of blood.\r\n\r\n[469] Letters from Louvois to Saint-Mars, April 3 and May 4, 1680.\r\n\r\n[470] _Ibid._, April 9, 1680.\r\n\r\n[471] M. Chéruel, who arrives at the conclusion that Fouquet died in\r\nMarch, 1680, observes, with reason, that a passage from the _Mémoires\r\nde Gourville_ is alone in contradiction with other contemporary\r\ntestimony, but that the contradiction is only apparent. According to\r\nBussy-Rabutin, Fouquet was authorised in 1680 to go to the waters\r\nof Bourbon. We have not referred to this authorisation, because no\r\ndocument makes mention of it. But the report was spread about at Paris,\r\nand it is not surprising that Gourville, writing his recollections long\r\nafter the events, should have confounded the authorisation with the\r\nrealization of this journey, and have said: “M. Fouquet having been set\r\nat liberty----.” It is nevertheless in reference to this passage that\r\nVoltaire writes in his _Siècle de Louis XIV._, “Hence it is not known\r\nwhere this unfortunate man died, whose most insignificant actions were\r\nof importance while he was powerful.” Voltaire has sacrificed truth to\r\neffect of style. Madame de Sévigné knew of it: “Poor Monsieur Fouquet\r\nis dead, I regret it; I have never lost so many friends.” Bussy knew of\r\nit: “You know, I think of the death of Fouquet by apoplexy at the time\r\nhe was permitted to take the Bourbon waters.” The family knew of it,\r\nsince several of its members were at Pignerol in March, 1680. Gourville\r\nwas the only one who was not correctly informed; but we have just seen\r\nin what manner and why he differs from other contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[472] Paroletti, _Sur la Mort du Surintendant Fouquet, notes\r\nreceuillies à Pignerol_, quarto, 24 pages.

Their occupations have never been lasting,\r\nbecause they have been in opposition to the true interests of France,\r\nand have violated natural boundary laws imposed upon the two countries\r\nby their geographical configurations. Charles VIII. conquered the\r\nKingdom of Naples, but Louis XII. lost it. The latter took possession\r\nof the Milanese, but Francois I. was obliged to evacuate it; and by\r\ngiving up Piedmont, which his father had made himself master of, Henri\r\nII. completed this retrograde movement. After having quitted the false\r\npath into which his three predecessors had dragged France, Henri II.\r\nindicated where the frontiers were to be enlarged, where national\r\nconquests were to be made, and what was the true direction to be\r\ngiven to her armies. He took Calais, thus pointing out the road to the\r\nNetherlands, and by becoming the master of the Trois-Evêchés he opened\r\nto his successors the glorious road to Alsace and the Rhine. While he\r\nwas so happily inaugurating a new struggle, he was also establishing\r\nthe basis of a new policy obscurely foreseen by Francois I., but the\r\nmerits of which certainly belong to Henri II. The latter understood\r\nthat the most effectual way of contending with the Emperor of Germany,\r\nthe head of the Catholic party, was to ally himself with the German\r\nPrinces and the Reformed party; and if he was too early interrupted\r\nin his scheme by a violent death--if the minority or the weakness of\r\nhis children for a long time suspended its execution--it was again\r\nundertaken, and we know with what success, by Henri IV., Richelieu,\r\nMazarin, and Louis XIV. To assure the neutrality of Spain, to watch\r\nItaly without attempting to establish himself there, to lead all his\r\nforces towards the North and the East, and to extend in this direction\r\nthe frontiers, which were too near to the capital: such was the\r\nglorious policy of Henri IV., suspended for a time after his death, but\r\nworthily continued by his successors.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it cannot be said that the latter were indifferent\r\nto the affairs of Italy. When, in 1627, the Dukes of Savoy and\r\nGuastalla, aided by the House of Austria, wished to secure to Charles\r\nde Gonzaga the Duke of Mantua’s inheritance, Louis XIII. loudly\r\nproclaimed the cause of this legitimate heir, and ensured the triumph\r\nof his rights. Rendered by victory master of the destiny of the House\r\nof Savoy, Richelieu did not allow himself to be dazzled by success.\r\nThis incomparable politician understood that to dispossess an Italian\r\ndynasty and to establish himself on the other side of the Alps,\r\nwould necessarily result in uniting the Italians to the Spaniards,\r\nin provoking against the French (who had suddenly become unpopular,\r\neven by their presence) a coalition sooner or later victorious, and\r\ncreating, in fact, outside the natural sphere of action of France,\r\nincessant grounds of anxiety, jealousies, struggles, and alarms. Thus,\r\nin 1631, by the treaty of Cherasco, the skilful Minister, sacrificing\r\nmany of the fruits of his victory, restored Piedmont and Savoy,\r\ncontenting himself with retaining Pignerol, so as always to keep open\r\none of the passes into Italy. To watch over her without alarming\r\nher, to be a protector of the rights of the Italian Princes without\r\nmenacing their independence, to exact complete confidence from them in\r\nreturn, to baffle the intrigues of the Spaniards, and to allow them to\r\naccumulate on themselves hatred and resentment; to assume, in a word,\r\nan attitude passive yet vigilant, firm but not menacing, such was the\r\njudicious conduct of Richelieu towards Italy.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. long remained faithful to this policy. It was towards the\r\nNorth and East that he led his victorious armies, and by a succession\r\nof enterprises, happily conceived and wonderfully well-conducted,\r\nhe extended the frontiers of France in the proper direction; and,\r\narbitrator of Europe, at the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and subsequently\r\nat that of Nimeguen, he inspired her with fear and admiration. In these\r\ntwo cities his will alone was the sole basis of the negotiations. While\r\nfor every one the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had never appeared to be\r\naught but a truce, that of Nimeguen combined all the conditions of a\r\ndefinitive peace. But even before this famous treaty was signed, Louis\r\nXIV. had conceived ambitious projects on the other side of the Alps,\r\nand the possession of Pignerol and the neighbouring valleys no longer\r\nappeared to him sufficient for the part he was desirous of playing\r\nin Italy. The influence of his government had, however, been better\r\naccepted there, when it was more dissembled, and when everything that\r\ncould give the slightest offence had been avoided with the greatest\r\ncare. But, when the policy of Richelieu and Mazarin, scrupulously\r\ncontinued by De Lionne, had ceased to prevail--when the invading and\r\nimpetuous Louvois established a sort of military diplomacy, which\r\nhe directed as he pleased--the sentiments of the Italians, and in\r\nparticular of the Piedmontese, became somewhat modified: confiding\r\ndeference gave place to restrained apprehension, and led by degrees to\r\na hatred which burst out against France at the moment she was oppressed\r\nby coalitions and defeats.\r\n\r\nCharles-Emmanuel, Duke of Savoy, had just died, leaving as his\r\nsuccessor a child, under the guardianship of a mother,[476] vain,\r\nardent, and impassioned, and whom littleness of mind, as much as\r\nhastiness of character, led to exaggerated resistance, soon to be\r\nfollowed by humiliating concessions. Instead of showing himself the\r\ndisinterested protector and sincere counsellor of Victor-Amadeus,\r\nLouis XIV. sought from that time forward to become powerful in Italy\r\nby profiting by the weakness of this government, the vanity of the\r\nRegent, the inexperience of her son, and by the passions aroused in\r\nthis court around a frivolous and capricious woman. By an altogether\r\nopposite line of conduct he might have eternally attached to himself\r\nthe young Duke, who, instead, was later to become his adversary, not\r\nthe most formidable, but certainly the most inconvenient, and who\r\nwas to contribute, above all others, to the diversion created in the\r\nSouth, to paralyze the power of France, and place her within an inch of\r\nher ruin. Victor-Amadeus has been represented, and with reason, as a\r\nperfidious enemy and unreliable ally. But, in the first place, it was\r\nthe conduct of his mother, and afterwards that of Louis XIV., which\r\nearly disposed this prince to dissimulation. Left in retirement by a\r\nhard and ambitious Regent, with his friends watched and suspected, and\r\nhimself isolated, yet not a stranger to the interests of his States,\r\ntaciturn, but thoughtful and observant, more patient than resigned, he\r\nwas submitting with apparent indifference to a double and oppressive\r\nguardianship, from which he only awaited the opportunity to escape or\r\nto be revenged. From this moment Louis XIV. himself prepared those\r\ndisasters which were to mark the end of his reign. Whilst those\r\naudaciously arbitrary decisions of the _Chambres de Réunion_ for the\r\naggrandisement of France by conquests made in full peace, profoundly\r\nirritated the North of Europe, he was about to agitate the South by\r\npretensions equally extravagant, for a long time concealed, then boldly\r\ndisclosed, and which tended to nothing less than to place a part of\r\nItaly under his exclusive dominion.\r\n\r\nThe complacency, or at least the neutrality, which the vanity and\r\nweakness of the Regent assured to Louis XIV., in Piedmont, was rendered\r\nnot less certain in Mantua by the frivolous indifference of Charles\r\nIV., its young duke. This prince, a degenerate representative of the\r\nHouse of Gonzaga, which has produced so many great men, and mingled\r\nits blood with the most illustrious families of Europe, showed himself\r\nunworthy of his rank and of his name, by the most extravagantly\r\ndissipated conduct. Careless and thoughtless, he was quite indifferent\r\nto the interests of his duchy, leaving its administration to\r\nincompetent favourites; and himself a non-resident duke, was in\r\nthe habit of spending the greater part of his existence amidst the\r\npleasures of Venice, and only dreaming of returning to Mantua, when the\r\npressing need of money called him thither. A great gambler, and lavish\r\nin his expenditure, he had soon exhausted in fêtes and adventures\r\nthe remnants of a fortune and of an equally broken constitution.\r\nAnticipating the revenues of his duchy, he had just obtained from\r\nsome Jews advances on the taxes for several years.[477] This sum was\r\nsoon squandered, and Charles IV. deprived of resources, but not less\r\neager for pleasure, ruined, but not less anxious to assist at all the\r\nfestivals given outside his States, was reduced to expedients, and\r\nin a manner compelled to sell himself. He was not long in finding a\r\npurchaser.\r\n\r\nUnder his authority was placed the marquisate of Montferrat--that rich\r\nand fertile country, so perpetually sought after, and the possession\r\nof which was frequently contested by arms. Taken by the Romans from\r\nthe Goths, then by the latter from the Lombards, afterwards forming a\r\nportion of the Empire of the West, eventually becoming an hereditary\r\nfief, several times claimed by the House of Savoy, conquered by Charles\r\nEmmanuel, then evacuated, this country had at length been annexed to\r\nthe Duchy of Mantua, from which vast States, nevertheless, separated\r\nit. Casale was its capital. This fortified place, situated on the Po,\r\nfifteen leagues to the east of Turin, was of the utmost importance, and\r\nespecially to Piedmont. From very remote times the Court of Turin had\r\ncoveted this natural dependency, which the defeats of Louis XIV. and\r\nthe conduct of Victor Amadeus would one day secure to it.\r\n\r\nThat the Duke of Mantua should possess this territory, bordering on\r\nPiedmont, was no doubt an anomaly, but was scarcely dangerous. The\r\nKing of France, on the contrary, being already master of Pignerol,\r\non securing possession of Casale, would, in reality, enclose the\r\nCourt of Turin between two formidable places, of which the one to the\r\nsouth-west gave access to the passage of the Alps, and the other,\r\nto the north-east, commanded the road to the Milanese. This was the\r\nproject formed by Louis XIV. The intrigue was mysteriously commenced\r\nin 1676; but for a long time previously he had turned his attention\r\nto this important town. On September 17, 1665, a few days subsequent\r\nto the death of Charles III., the preceding Duke of Mantua, he had\r\nhastened to send to the Regent, mother[478] of Charles IV., the Sieur\r\nd’Aubeville, instructed to insist “that no change should be tolerated\r\nin the garrison of Casale during the minority of the young Duke”.[479]\r\nThis demand, which was very natural on account of the contiguity of\r\nthe Spaniards, seemed--and, perhaps, was, at the time--extremely\r\ndisinterested. In 1676, however, he no longer troubled himself with the\r\nmaintenance of a Mantuan garrison at Casale, but rather with throwing\r\nthe place open to his own troops.\r\n\r\nOne of the great personages of Mantua was Ercole Antonio Matthioly.\r\nHe was born at Bologna, December 1, 1640, and belonged to an old and\r\ndistinguished family of the long robe. His grandfather, Constantino\r\nMatthioly, had been raised to the dignity of senator. One of his\r\nuncles, Ercole Matthioly, a Jesuit father, was a very celebrated\r\norator.[480] He himself early attracted attention by obtaining, when\r\nonly nineteen years of age, the prize in civil and canon law, and\r\nshortly afterwards the title of professor at the University of Bologna.\r\nHe subsequently made himself still further known by several much-prized\r\nworks; and after having formed an alliance with an honourable\r\nsenatorial family of Bologna, established himself at Mantua, where his\r\ntalents, dexterity, and early maturity caused him to be appreciated\r\nby Duke Charles III. de Gonzaga, one of whose Secretaries of State he\r\nbecame. After this prince’s death, his son, Charles IV. de Gonzaga,\r\nwhen he attained his majority, accorded his friendship to Matthioly,\r\nwhom he named Supenumerary Senator of Mantua, a dignity to which the\r\ntitle of Count was attached. Filled with ambition, Matthioly not only\r\nhoped to reacquire the office of Secretary of State, but also to become\r\nthe principal Minister of his young master. Knowing his position to\r\nbe most precarious, he was ardently desirous of rendering him one\r\nof those signal services which justify the highest rewards, and an\r\noccasion offered itself during the latter months of the year 1677.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé d’Estrades,[481] then ambassador of Louis XIV. to the Venetian\r\nRepublic, was as ambitious and as restless as Matthioly. Belonging to a\r\nfamily of _diplomates_, and anxious to become illustrious in his turn,\r\nhe had the cunning to enter resolutely into the views of the Court of\r\nVersailles, and knowing very well, moreover, that his conduct would\r\nbe approved, to concoct the intrigue which was to end in the cession\r\nof Casale to the King of France. Having long since been acquainted\r\nwith the condition of the Court of Mantua and with the individuals\r\nholding the chief rank in it, he cast his eyes upon Matthioly as\r\nbeing, from his character, the most likely to embrace the project of\r\nsurrender, and by using his influence over his master, to induce him\r\nto adopt it. But before entering directly into communication with\r\nMatthioly, he sent to Verona, where the latter frequently resided,\r\none Giuliani,[482] a perfectly sure man, whom his occupation of\r\njournalist obliged to travel from place to place to collect news, and\r\nwhose stay at Verona consequently would not excite suspicion. Giuliani\r\nhad Matthioly watched, and, observing him himself, ascertained his\r\naversion to the Spaniards, from whom he had never received anything but\r\nhopes. By degrees the connection became closer, and Giuliani was able\r\nto indicate to him without danger the plans of the Abbé d’Estrades,\r\nthe pecuniary advantages which the Duke of Mantua would derive from\r\nthe surrender of Casale to Louis XIV., and the security as well as the\r\nhonour of an alliance with so powerful a sovereign. Matthioly leapt at\r\nthe proposition,[483] and undertook to expound it to the Duke, whom\r\nhe had no great difficulty in convincing. The intercourse soon became\r\nmore direct. Giuliani saw Charles IV. at Mantua, and it was agreed that\r\nan interview between the latter and the Abbé d’Estrades might take\r\nplace at Venice with all the more secrecy, “as, in consequence of the\r\nCarnival, every one, even the Doge, the oldest Senators, the Cardinals,\r\nand the Nuncio, goes about masked.”[484] Louis XIV. and M. de Pomponne,\r\nhis Minister,[485] congratulated the Abbé d’Estrades with effusion on\r\nthe propitious commencement of this delicate negotiation,[486] and on\r\nJanuary 12, 1678, the King himself did not disdain to write to Count\r\nMatthioly, in order to thank him.[487]\r\n\r\nMatthioly and Charles IV., in fact, proceeded to Venice. They first\r\ndiscussed with the Abbé the price of the surrender, which was fixed at\r\n100,000 crowns,[488] payable after the exchange of the ratifications\r\nof the treaty, and in two sums at three months’ interval. At midnight\r\non March 13, 1678,[489] the Ambassador of the King of France and the\r\nDuke of Mantua met, as if by chance, in the middle of a public square\r\non leaving a ball, and there, away from every inquisitive ear, and\r\nconcealed from every glance by a mask similar to those then worn by\r\nall noblemen at Venice, conversed for quite an hour concerning the\r\nconditions of the treaty, the payments of the stipulated price, and\r\nthe manner in which Louis XIV. should defend Charles IV. against\r\nthe effects of the resentment of the Venetian Republic and the\r\nSpaniards. Distrustful as were the Italian princes, disposed as the\r\nVenetian Republic may have been to suspect an intrigue, and prevent so\r\ndangerous an intervention as that of the King of France in the north\r\nof Italy, numerous and accomplished as were the spies who swarmed\r\nin Venice, it was in this same city, almost under the very eyes of\r\nthe representatives of the different powers, that the bases of a\r\ntreaty which was one of the most menacing to the independence of the\r\nPeninsula, were settled, in a mysterious and impenetrable manner.\r\n\r\nWith the same precautions, and always without attracting the attention\r\nof the other princes, Charles IV. saw the Abbé d’Estrades several\r\ntimes afterwards. It was arranged between them that Matthioly should\r\nproceed secretly to France, and that he should sign at Versailles, in\r\nthe name of his master, the definitive treaty which would permit Louis\r\nXIV. to penetrate into the north of Italy. This journey of Matthioly’s\r\nwas delayed for some months, first by a rather lengthened illness,\r\nwhich kept him at Mantua, then by Louis XIV.’s desire to defer till\r\nthe following spring,--that is, till April, 1679,--the despatch of his\r\ntroops to Casale.[490] At the end of October, 1678, Count Matthioly\r\nand Giuliani, in order to avert suspicion, announced their intention\r\nof paying a visit to Switzerland, and, in fact, proceeded thither,\r\ntraversed it,[491] and arrived in Paris on November 28. At once placed\r\nin communication with M. de Pomponne, Minister of Exterior Relations,\r\nthey discussed, and drew up in the most profound secrecy, the treaty of\r\ncession, which was signed on December 8,[492] and which stated:--\r\n\r\n1st. That the Duke of Mantua should receive French troops into Casale;\r\n\r\n2nd. That he should be named Generalissimo of any French army which\r\nLouis XIV. might send into Italy;\r\n\r\n3rd. And that after the execution of the treaty the sum of 100,000\r\ncrowns should be paid to the prince.[493]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the signing of this document, Matthioly was received\r\nby Louis XIV. with the most flattering distinction in a secret\r\naudience. The King presented him with a valuable diamond in remembrance\r\nof his visit, caused him to be paid 400 double louis,[494] and promised\r\nhim that after the ratification of the treaty he should receive a much\r\nlarger sum for his reward, as well as a place for his son among the\r\nKing’s pages, and a rich abbey for his brother.[495]\r\n\r\nNo intrigue was ever better conducted or had more chances of success.\r\nIn Piedmont a court divided, powerless, and almost servilely devoted\r\nto France; in the remainder of Italy, as in Piedmont, princes kept in\r\nthe most complete ignorance; in Mantua a duke perfectly ready to sell\r\na portion of his states; lastly, the two ambassadors charged with the\r\nnegotiation of this affair having an equal interest in its success,\r\nsince it would enrich one and assure to both the gratitude of their\r\nmasters, and a high position.\r\n\r\nTwo months after Matthioly’s visit to France, the courts of Turin,\r\nMadrid, and Vienna, the Spanish Governor of the Milanese, and the State\r\nInquisitors of the Venetian Republic--that is to say, all those who\r\nwere most interested in opposing this project--were acquainted with\r\nthe minutest details of it, and were ignorant neither of the price to\r\nbe paid for the surrender, the time at which it was to take place, nor\r\nthe names of the negotiators. In one word, they knew everything, for\r\nat different times[496] they had received the confidence of the better\r\ninformed of the participators in this intrigue, of Count Matthioly\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBy what motive was he actuated? Must we see in this treason an act\r\ninspired by base cupidity? Was Matthioly a rogue, who, after having\r\nreceived Louis XIV.’s money, preceeded to sell himself by turns to\r\nthe Austrians, the Spaniards, the Venetians, and the Piedmontese?\r\nOr, disquieted in mind and suddenly struck by the apparition of\r\nhis country in danger, was he seized with remorse at the moment of\r\nbartering her away, and did he seek the only means of preserving her\r\nfrom the encroachments of an ambitious King? Was he an intriguer, a\r\nlow informer, or a man struggling between two opposing sentiments,\r\nwhose greedy ambition had first led him to assist his master’s criminal\r\nprojects, and whose patriotism had then suddenly determined him to\r\ncause them to miscarry? These are questions which nobody will ever be\r\nable to answer, because nobody ever received his confidences. It is,\r\nhowever, worthy of remark, that if cupidity alone had been Matthioly’s\r\nmotive, he would have stooped to the execution of the treaty of\r\nCasale, since this offered him many more material advantages than he\r\ncould hope for from a sudden change of conduct. That Matthioly should\r\nbe designated a rogue in the despatches afterwards exchanged between\r\nthe Court of Versailles and the French representatives in Italy, is not\r\nat all astonishing; this anger was the natural consequence of a bitter\r\ndisappointment. But the fact that there was room for a more noble\r\nmotive, and that a patriotic inspiration was possible, is sufficient to\r\nprevent us from unreservedly condemning this man, who perhaps thought\r\nto save his country. No doubt he ought to have cast aside all the\r\nappearances of knavery, to have returned Louis XIV. his presents, to\r\nhave first dissuaded Charles IV., and if the latter had persisted in\r\nintroducing the French army into Italy, then, and then only, to have\r\nrevealed the danger to the other princes. In this case it would have\r\nbeen necessary to do it openly, with frankness, without dissimulation,\r\nand by informing the Abbé d’Estrades of what would have no longer\r\nbeen a treason, but a truly patriotic act. Was, however, such a line\r\nof conduct open to Matthioly, surrounded with spies, watched over and\r\nhaving to fear a power so formidable as France, and a resentment so\r\ndangerous as Louis XIV.’s? Must we altogether blame him if he could\r\nnot strip his character of all its craftiness and duplicity, and if,\r\namid the dishonouring appearances of treason, he thought to perform\r\nan honourable act? To the present time people have seen in him only a\r\ncontemptible cheat, but however weak the contrary presumption may be,\r\ndo not let us altogether reject it. Let us cease to place ourselves\r\nonly in the French point of view, and by considering the peril to\r\nwhich Italy would have been exposed by the cession of Casale, let us\r\nnot refuse to suppose that Matthioly, by preventing it, understood,\r\nperhaps, the interest of his country better than his own, and that,\r\ninto a mind naturally greedy, a noble and disinterested sentiment was\r\nable to penetrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[476] Marie-Jeanne-Baptiste de Nemours, widow of Charles-Emmanuel and\r\nmother of Victor-Amadeus II.\r\n\r\n[477] Despatch of the Marquis de Villars to Pomponne, January 8,\r\n1677:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Savoy, 66.\r\n\r\n[478] Isabella Clara of Austria, daughter of the Archduke Leopold, who\r\nwas grandson of the Emperor Ferdinand III.

On December 31, 1678, she not only received his\r\nconfidence, but also had communicated to her all the original documents\r\nrelating to the negotiation, and took copies of them. She was alike\r\nvery pleased at knowing of this intrigue, and very much embarrassed\r\nas to the line of conduct she ought to pursue. Piedmont, indeed,\r\nhad most to suffer from the surrender of Casale to Louis XIV. To\r\noppose the execution of this project by arms, was far from the wish\r\nof this princess and far beyond the forces at her disposal. To place\r\nobstacles in the way of it exposed her to the resentment of the King\r\nof France. After having hesitated for a long time, and not doubting\r\nbut that Matthioly would, without delay, make the same revelations\r\nto the Spaniards and Austrians as he had to her, she preferred to\r\nleave to Spain and to the Empire the dangerous task of arresting\r\nLouis XIV.’s encroaching ambition in Italy. But to preserve silence\r\nand prudently await the result of the struggle, either armed or\r\ndiplomatic, which seemed likely to ensue, was not in accordance with\r\nthe frivolous character and general incapacity of this princess. To\r\nwhom, then, was she to confide this weighty and embarrassing secret?\r\nShe was too little of an Italian to resolve to make it known at Milan,\r\nVenice, and Florence, and thus provoke a coalition of the various\r\ninterests which were menaced. So it was to Louis XIV. himself that she\r\nrevealed Matthioly’s confidences.[498] In this manner, she secured to\r\nherself the merit of obliging a powerful sovereign, whose friendship\r\nshe retained without having anything to fear from him, thanks to\r\nthe vigorous measures which the courts of Vienna and Madrid would\r\nbe compelled to take. She deceived herself, however, in a portion\r\nof her calculations; since it was not till two months afterwards\r\nthat Matthioly, on seeing the uselessness of his confession to the\r\nregent, and learning that Louvois was continuing his preparations for\r\nentering into Casale, resolved to inform the Austrians, Venetians, and\r\nSpaniards.[499] If he had not done so, the King of France, meeting with\r\nno obstacle, and having received the Duchess of Savoy’s valuable piece\r\nof intelligence, would have immediately taken possession of Casale.\r\nLouis XIV. was greatly moved, and with reason felt very grateful to\r\nthe regent for her course of action. He expresses in his despatches\r\nsentiments of gratitude and of esteem towards the Duchess of Savoy,\r\nwhilst he stigmatizes what he terms the treason of the knave. But,\r\ndeceived as he had been by the one and enlightened by the other, was he\r\nin a position to judge properly the conduct of these two individuals?\r\nAnd, to place ourselves in another point of view to his, we may ask\r\nwho most compromised the true interests of this country, the man whose\r\ninformation--sold,[500] it is true, but well-timed--suddenly aroused\r\nthe other princes to vigilance; or the princess, who, more French than\r\nItalian, hastened to communicate this valuable confidence to Italy’s\r\nmost redoubtable and menacing enemy?\r\n\r\nThe regent’s letter reached Louis XIV. in the middle of the month of\r\nFebruary, 1679. The King’s disappointment and wrath were so much the\r\nmore lively since his plans were already in course of execution. All\r\nthose who were to play a part in the _dénoûment_ of this business were\r\nnot only appointed, but were actually at their posts. The far-sighted\r\nLouvois, who, previous to Napoleon, was, perhaps, the man who possessed\r\nin the highest degree the genius of organization and the spirit of\r\ndetail, had drawn up--a quality in which he excelled--the whole plan\r\nof the operation. His orders, clear, precise, and minute, had been\r\npunctually followed. Numerous troops, under the command of the Marquis\r\nde Boufflers, Colonel-General of Dragoons, were assembled at Briançon\r\nready to cross the frontier.[501] The Baron d’Asfeld,[502] Colonel of\r\nDragoons, left for Venice, on the mission of exchanging in that city\r\nthe ratification of the treaty.[503] Catinat,[504] then Brigadier of\r\nInfantry, arrived from Flanders, where he had already served with\r\ndistinction, and proceeded with the greatest secrecy to Pignerol.\r\nSaint-Mars had been enjoined[505] to leave the postern of the citadel\r\nopen, to meet himself the mysterious traveller, and to conduct him into\r\nthe donjon in such a manner that nobody might be able to suspect his\r\npresence there. This sham prisoner was even obliged to change his name,\r\nand the despatches addressed to him bore that of Richemont instead\r\nof Catinat.[506] Everything had been marvellously well conceived,\r\neverything was prepared, everything foreseen, save what the Government\r\nof Versailles termed the treason of Matthioly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Duchess of Savoy’s communication did not entirely\r\ndestroy Louis XIV.’s hopes; so he refrained from informing the Abbé\r\nd’Estrades, who had been transferred from the embassy of Venice to\r\nthat of Turin. He wished to look upon these first disclosures as only\r\na commencement of treason,--an accident to be regretted, it is true,\r\nbut one of which the consequences might perhaps be neutralized by\r\nexercising a pressure upon the Duke of Mantua, and by endeavouring\r\nto intimidate Matthioly. But the latter had become as laconic in\r\nhis letters as he was inexact in keeping his appointments. The Abbé\r\nd’Estrades, very much preoccupied with the result of a negotiation\r\nof which he had been the life and soul, only suspected a treason the\r\nfull reality of which he was not yet acquainted with. He sent courier\r\nafter courier to M. de Pinchesne at Venice, to Mantua for Matthioly, to\r\nthe principal towns of Italy for Duke Charles IV.; and from all these\r\ndifferent places he received the most unsatisfactory intelligence.\r\nSometimes Matthioly declared that he was detained at Verona by the\r\nstate of his health. At others, Charles IV. was attracted to Venice\r\nby the desire of assisting at a _carrousel_.[507] It was not that the\r\nDuke formally refused to execute the treaty of surrender, but that new\r\nobstacles were continually being raised by the very person who till\r\nthen had undertaken the direction of this affair--by Matthioly himself;\r\nand the young prince, thoughtless and frivolous, of a very versatile\r\ndisposition, and devoting himself to scarcely anything but pleasure,\r\nwas very glad to endorse his favourite’s views. Suddenly the news\r\narrived at Turin that Baron d’Asfeld had been arrested by the governor\r\nof the Milanese while proceeding to Increa in order to exchange the\r\nratifications there with Matthioly, and that he was detained a prisoner\r\nby the Spaniards.[508] However significant this arrest may have been,\r\nthe Court of Versailles did not yet despair. Catinat received orders to\r\nundertake the mission at first confided to D’Asfeld, and to start for\r\nIncrea, whither Matthioly was also invited to proceed.[509] The sham\r\nRichemont, accompanied by Saint-Mars, who adopted the name and dress\r\nof an officer belonging to Pignerol, left the citadel by night, and,\r\nwith numerous precautions, repaired to the place of meeting. But there\r\nthey awaited Matthioly in vain, and after many adventures, after having\r\nrun the risk of being arrested by a detachment from the garrison of\r\nCasale, after having been compelled to appear before the governor of\r\nthat place, and having preserved their incognito with difficulty, they\r\nat last returned to Pignerol, very happy at not having been recognized,\r\nbut without bringing back the instrument of surrender.[510]\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the doubts of the Abbé d’Estrades were changed\r\ninto certainty, and it was then that he first conceived the idea of\r\nMatthioly’s abduction. It is worthy of remark that it so happened\r\nwith this prisoner as with Avedick. Louis XIV. approved the conduct\r\nof d’Estrades as he was afterwards to ratify that of Ferriol. But\r\nit is his ambassadors who have executed the project of abduction,\r\neven before receiving the authorisation for doing so. This is clear\r\nfrom the evidence of the despatches which we are about to quote. It\r\nis, in truth, necessary to allow the principal author of this act of\r\nviolence to speak for himself, which we shall do hereafter more than\r\nonce; for, on approaching the conclusion of this work, we desire the\r\nreader to be self-convinced, and thus to participate in the pleasure\r\nwhich the solution of a problem affords. Having spared him long but\r\nnecessary researches, we shall in future often confine ourselves to\r\nbeing his guide; and by now and then putting him on the right track,\r\nby contenting ourselves with indicating the goal, and furnishing the\r\nelements of the pursuit, shall leave him all the gratification and all\r\nthe merit of the success of our common enterprise.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 1679, D’Estrades writes to M. de Pomponne:--[511]\r\n\r\n “... It is easy to discern, from what one learns on many sides, that\r\n it is owing to Mattioli’s indiscretion that this affair has become\r\n public, for it would be impossible for the particulars of it, and even\r\n those of his journey to Paris, and of the stay which he made there,\r\n to be so well known if he had not talked about them.... Still I am\r\n awaiting Mattioli’s arrival here in order to see if one can rely upon\r\n his good faith, and if he is in a position to perform what he has\r\n promised. I shall have him so well watched that I shall know if he\r\n holds any communication with Madame de Savoy or with the Ministers,\r\n and I shall perhaps also find the means of being informed concerning\r\n what he may be treating of with them. I beg you, sir, to let me know\r\n if, in the event of there being no doubt of his perfidy, and of its\r\n being necessary to compel him by fear to put everything in train for\r\n keeping his word, the King will approve his being taken to Pignerol,\r\n which will not be at all difficult for me to accomplish without its\r\n attracting attention; because, after his arrival there, without any\r\n one knowing that I had caused him to be abducted, it would be easy\r\n to say that he had gone of his own accord. Nevertheless, I shall not\r\n think of doing this until I have received your orders, and it would\r\n only be after having lost all hope with regard to him that we should\r\n adopt these measures.”\r\n\r\nOn April 22,[512] M. de Pomponne replies to him:--\r\n\r\n “Sir, I shall commence by replying to the two letters which you\r\n have been at the pains to write me on the 8th of the present month\r\n concerning the affair of Count Mattioli. His behaviour is sufficient\r\n to make us believe that he is a rogue; but, in order to assure you\r\n the better of it, his Majesty orders me to confide to you, under the\r\n seal of secrecy, what has occurred with reference to this matter. On\r\n the occasion of his journey to Turin, he informed the Duchess of Savoy\r\n generally of the papers with which he was charged, and of everything\r\n which had been arranged with him here. He has since given the same\r\n information to the Inquisitors of Venice, and caused M. d’Asfeld to\r\n be arrested during his journey in the Milanese, by the information\r\n which he gave to Count de Melgar. As he thinks that all this knavery\r\n is unknown, he has been in the habit of trifling with M. de Pinchesne,\r\n and you see by the letters which he writes to you that he wishes to\r\n trifle with you in the same manner. As he proposes to visit you at\r\n Turin, his Majesty does not wish you to let him know that you are\r\n acquainted with his conduct. You will continue to let him think that\r\n you are deceived, and you will make use of your apparent confidence,\r\n and of that which you will assure him the King continues to have, in\r\n order to endeavour to obtain the ratification of the treaty. He has\r\n stated at Venice that he has it in his possession. Perhaps he has it\r\n still. It is important to exert all your skill to obtain it from him.\r\n The King does not consider it advisable to cause the scandal of having\r\n him taken to Pignerol as you propose. The only case in which you could\r\n employ menaces and fear, would be if you were certain that he really\r\n possessed the ratification, and you considered these means necessary,\r\n in order to compel him to give it up to you. There is scarcely any\r\n room for doubt that, if he goes to Turin, he will see the Duchess of\r\n Savoy and will keep out of your way. You will not appear to take any\r\n notice of it, and you will not let this princess know that you are\r\n informed of this matter, although it is she herself who has given\r\n information concerning it to his Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe same day[513] the Abbé d’Estrades urges upon the Government of\r\nVersailles the necessity of granting the authorisation to kidnap\r\nMatthioly.\r\n\r\n “... I believe that what I have already had the honour of stating\r\n to the King proves Mattioli’s perfidy sufficiently clearly; he has\r\n been here for the last four days, and has come to see me with great\r\n precautions, as if he had much interest in concealing himself;\r\n nevertheless, every morning he has had conferences with a person named\r\n Tarin, who is the man that Madame R.[514] sent to Padua to ascertain\r\n what it was he had to communicate to her; he has insinuated a thousand\r\n falsehoods in his conversations with him; he has wished to have it\r\n believed that he saw me every day, although I have only spoken to\r\n him once; and that the Duke of Mantua had sent him here in order to\r\n declare to me that this Prince could not keep his word to his Majesty\r\n on the subject of the Casale treaty. Whilst I have been writing\r\n this despatch, Mattioli has again come to see me, and the manner in\r\n which he has spoken to me has so clearly shown me his bad faith,\r\n that, even if I could possibly have had any doubt concerning it, he\r\n would have left me in no uncertainty; he has proposed to me some\r\n ridiculous schemes which would tend only to involve his Majesty in\r\n fresh embarrassments; he has told me that he leaves to-morrow in order\r\n to have an interview with the governor of Casale, who was pressing\r\n him strongly to visit him, and who hoped that the place would soon be\r\n in the hands of the King; as he has assured me that he would return\r\n during the present week at the latest, and, as I know that a few days\r\n afterwards he is to go back to Venice, I have not time to await his\r\n Majesty’s orders to arrest him. It is, nevertheless, so important\r\n to do this, that there remains to me only to think of the means of\r\n executing the design without scandal, with the view that the rumours\r\n which would ensue should not revive those which have been caused by\r\n the affair which he was negotiating, and of its not being known what\r\n had become of him. I have thought that it was impossible for me to\r\n succeed in this, except by entrusting Madame Royale with the secret,\r\n since I could not make certain of the person of Mattioli in Turin or\r\n in the States of the Duke of Savoy, without resorting to a violence at\r\n which she would show herself offended, and by whatever pretext I might\r\n have wished to attract him towards Pignerol, this Princess, whom he\r\n informs of all that passes between himself and me, would have warned\r\n him, no doubt, to take care of himself; I have seen myself compelled\r\n to act thus, from what she said to me two days ago, that since\r\n Mattioli was here, he might dwell at Pignerol or take a stroll in\r\n France for longer than he imagined, I replied she was so enlightened\r\n that I thought I ought not to neglect the idea which she gave me;\r\n that I would reflect upon it, and that, meanwhile, I begged of her in\r\n the name of the King not to mention anything which could imperil the\r\n effect of the resolution which I might take for his Majesty’s service,\r\n but that I would not execute it without communicating with her. She\r\n promised me this, and, after having thanked me for having been so\r\n willing to act in concert with her, she charged me to behave in such a\r\n way that Mattioli should not be arrested on her territories, so that\r\n she might not have to reproach herself with having delivered up a man\r\n who, although guilty of a treason, had, nevertheless, confided in her.\r\n I was this morning with Madame Royale, and, after having represented\r\n to her that it was of extreme consequence that Mattioli should be put\r\n in a place where he could no longer pay his court to the Spaniards\r\n and Venetians by means of the false confidences which I knew him to\r\n be making to them every day, I have assured her that I would arrange\r\n my plans in such a way that he would be taken to Pignerol without\r\n his having any suspicion of it till he was out of the States of her\r\n Royal Highness, and on the point of entering the place; she has shown\r\n herself satisfied with my assurance, and she has said to me that I\r\n could plainly see that she was contributing as much as possible to\r\n what would be of service to the King, since she had not dissuaded\r\n Mattioli from the visit which he had made here, and of which he had\r\n advised her, although she had never had the smallest doubt of what\r\n would befall him through it.\r\n\r\n “Besides the reasons, Sir, which I have already explained to you, I\r\n have since had some news tending to determine me to seize Mattioli;\r\n first, I know that he has been unwilling to give up to the Duke of\r\n Mantua the originals of the papers relating to the treaty, no matter\r\n what pressure this Prince, who has only copies of them, may have put\r\n upon him, and that he retains them in order to show them to those from\r\n whom he wishes to extract money, and who would not believe him upon\r\n slighter proofs. Juliani [Giuliani] has written to me that D. Joseph\r\n Varano, who stands very well with M. de Mantua, and who has always\r\n manifested his desire that his master should place himself under\r\n the King’s protection by means of the treaty of Casale, and to whom\r\n my letter will be delivered, and not to Vialardi, as I had informed\r\n you--having in writing used one name for the other--was to have an\r\n interview with him about this affair, and that he will assuredly not\r\n enter into any engagement whilst Mattioli is at liberty. Lastly, I\r\n have received information from Milan that the Duke of Mantua has\r\n asked the Spaniards for six hundred thousand crowns,[515] declaring\r\n to them that not being able to fortify Casale without it, he would\r\n not answer for the safe custody of this place, and that the Count\r\n de Melgar, who was willing to give them to him, was making useless\r\n efforts to raise them, and that he will not obtain them; so that it\r\n is probable that this Prince, who is only looking out for money, on\r\n losing the hope of getting it from Spain, will listen to the offers\r\n made him on behalf of the King, and that his Majesty will find himself\r\n in possession of an important place, which will always remain in\r\n his hands, through the death of the Duke of Mantua, whose health is\r\n so ruined by his debauches, by the incurable diseases produced by\r\n them, and by the poison which it is publicly stated was given him a\r\n little while since--that according to all appearances he cannot have\r\n long to live. One may add that if this Prince should happen to die\r\n before the execution of the treaty, his Majesty would have the right\r\n of doing himself justice by producing M. de Mantua’s letter, and the\r\n full powers which sufficiently authorise the articles which have been\r\n agreed on, but it is necessary for this purpose to get them out of\r\n Mattioli’s hands, which cannot be done if we do not make ourselves\r\n masters of his person, since he never carries them about with him.\r\n\r\n “Such, Sir, are the motives which oblige me not to allow him to\r\n escape, and in order to succeed in the affair, I have written to M.\r\n de Catinat that it is necessary that we should see one another at the\r\n beginning of the present week; I shall inform him at length of the\r\n state in which matters are, and shall tell him to select me a place\r\n near to Pignerol, whither I can proceed with Mattioli on a given\r\n day, when he shall have returned from the visit which he has paid to\r\n Casale, and to send there secretly a few men well armed, because I\r\n know that he always carries two pistols in his pockets with two others\r\n and a poignard in his belt; I shall conduct him to this place in my\r\n carriage under the pretext of having a conference with M. Catinat,\r\n and I have already so well inclined him to it that he has testified\r\n to me his desire for it; as I have spoken to him in such a way as\r\n to remove all kind of suspicion, and as he affects to fear lest the\r\n intercourse which we have with one another here should be discovered,\r\n he has of himself entered into all the precautions that I have wished\r\n to take, and we have agreed, in order to avoid the accidents which\r\n might happen, that we will only meet M. Catinat [at a spot] both out\r\n of sight of Pignerol and of the States of the Duke of Savoy; it is\r\n there also that I hope to place him in good hands, and I have no doubt\r\n but that M. de Saint-Mars will be very willing to receive him on M.\r\n Catinat’s report and my word, at least until it shall have pleased his\r\n Majesty to order otherwise.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                            “I am, etc.\r\n\r\n                                                   “L’ABBÉ D’ESTRADES.”\r\n\r\nOn April 29[516] D’Estrades returns to the charge, and adduces the\r\nstrong reasons which he considers ought to determine Matthioly’s\r\narrest:--\r\n\r\n “Juliany (Giuliani) has told me that he has spoken to Don Joseph\r\n Varano, who has promised him to do his utmost to renew the affair of\r\n Casale, but that at present M. de Mantua did not wish to hear anything\r\n spoken of except capturing or killing Mattioli, who, he complains,\r\n has betrayed him. He has learnt from this same Varano that what most\r\n disquieted M. de Mantua was, that Mattioli had made him ratify the\r\n treaty, and that he had kept possession of the ratification with all\r\n the other papers concerning this affair; so that when we are masters\r\n of Mattioli’s person, we will compel him to give up this ratification\r\n together with the rest. And so, Sir, you see of what consequence it\r\n is to arrest him. I no longer hesitate, moreover, about doing it,\r\n especially since I have seen that M. Catinat, with whom I had an\r\n interview two days ago, and with whom I have taken all the necessary\r\n measures, considered, after what I had told him concerning everything,\r\n that the execution of this resolution ought not to be delayed. I hope\r\n that in four or five days’ time it will be a settled affair, and I\r\n shall inform you of the manner in which it has been accomplished. It\r\n seems to me that when one has obliged Mattioli to deliver up among the\r\n other papers the ratification of M. de Mantua, if he has indeed given\r\n it to this man, the King will have the right to demand the execution\r\n of the ratified treaty, in the event of this Prince not wishing to\r\n take the ways of agreeableness and negotiations.”\r\n\r\nAt length, on April 28, Louis consents to the arrest.[517] But when his\r\norders arrive at Turin, Matthioly had already been carried off since\r\nMay 2.\r\n\r\n “I must inform you,” wrote D’Estrades to Pomponne, “in what manner\r\n I have brought Mattioli into a secure place. I have already had the\r\n honour to acquaint you that I had been studious to exhibit towards\r\n him entire confidence, and to cause him to entertain the desire of\r\n having an interview with M. Catinat; Giuliani, who arrived here\r\n three or four days ago, and whose fidelity to speak truly deserves\r\n to be taken into consideration, furnished me with a new means which\r\n was very useful. He told me that Mattioli had informed him that the\r\n expenses of numerous journeys, and the presents which he had been\r\n obliged to give to M. de Mantua’s mistresses in order to render them\r\n favourable, had exhausted his resources, and that he was at present\r\n without money; Giuliani did not hesitate to promise that I would let\r\n him have what he might require, and on this intelligence I told him\r\n [Matthioly] in confidence that we had only to seek expedients to renew\r\n our affair; and that provided the Duke of Mantua still had the same\r\n sentiments, it would not be difficult for us to promptly execute the\r\n treaty, since M. Catinat not only possessed the power to cause the\r\n troops destined for that purpose to arrive and to command them, but\r\n that he also had a very considerable sum to meet all the expenses\r\n that he might consider necessary, that Giuliani had represented to\r\n me the state in which he was, and that I would cause to be given\r\n to him whatever he might desire. I added that there was no need to\r\n have any false delicacy about it; that it was neither my money nor\r\n M. Catinat’s which I was offering him, but his Majesty’s, who did\r\n not believe that he could employ it better than for so important an\r\n affair. As he is one of the greatest rogues who have ever lived, this\r\n proposition made him extremely impatient to see M. Catinat; and he\r\n pressed me with reasons which he at once concocted not to delay the\r\n conference that we were to have with him; we made an appointment for\r\n the following day, Tuesday, the 2nd of the present month; and I gave\r\n him a rendezvous half a mile from Turin in a church, whither I was to\r\n proceed and take him up in my carriage at six o’clock in the morning;\r\n unfortunately there had been three days of very bad weather; it was\r\n still raining heavily on that day, and as the streams of this country\r\n easily become swollen, we found one called the Guisiola, three miles\r\n from the place to which we had to go, the waters of which were so\r\n high that the horses could only cross it by swimming; there was only\r\n a single bridge, which was half destroyed, and I was in despair at\r\n this hindrance. When after having perceived that it was absolutely\r\n necessary to repair the bridge with planks in order to be able to\r\n cross on foot, Mattioli worked at it with so much zeal, that in an\r\n hour we put it into a state to make use of it.\r\n\r\n “I profited by this opportunity to leave my carriage and servants at\r\n this spot, with the view that what I was about to do should be more\r\n secret, and we proceeded on foot along very bad roads to the place\r\n where we were expected. M. Catinat had so well arranged everything\r\n that no one but himself appeared; he made us enter a room, and\r\n during the conversation I insensibly made Mattioli state what he had\r\n avowed to me two days previously, that he possessed all the original\r\n papers that concerned our affair, viz.: M. de Mantua’s letter to the\r\n King, his Majesty’s answer to him, the full powers of this Prince,\r\n the treaty which you had put into writing, the Marquis de Louvois’\r\n memorandum, and two signatures of M. de Mantua; one at the bottom\r\n of the treaty so as to serve for the ratification, and the other at\r\n the bottom of a sheet of blank paper, on which to write an order\r\n to the governor of Casale to receive his Majesty’s troops into his\r\n town whenever they might present themselves there; he added that this\r\n Prince had since done all that he could to oblige him to return these\r\n papers, but that he had never been willing to go and find them, that\r\n he had only sent him copies, and had deposited the originals with his\r\n wife in a convent of nuns at Bologna, called Saint-Louis; after having\r\n invited this confidence towards M. Catinat, I considered that my\r\n presence was no longer necessary, and when I had left he was arrested\r\n without disturbance.\r\n\r\n “I returned here with the Abbé de Montesquieu, my cousin-german whom\r\n I had taken with me for two reasons, which I trust his Majesty will\r\n approve. The first because I could not leave Turin alone without its\r\n being believed that I was not going to pay a visit as I had stated\r\n two days previously, and because I had already experienced that I had\r\n been watched during two or three drives I had expressly taken outside\r\n the town, with the view that people should not find it extraordinary\r\n when I wished to carry off Mattioli. The second and the strongest was,\r\n that all the precautions I had adopted in order to see M. Catinat\r\n at the Capucins, whose convent is outside this town, on a mountain\r\n where there is no other house but theirs, not having prevented our\r\n interview from being known, and the Marquis de Saint-Maurice from\r\n speaking of it rather indiscreetly, I thought that I ought not to risk\r\n fresh conferences with him, and that it would be still more dangerous\r\n if I went to Pignerol; which the Abbé de Montesquieu can do without\r\n attracting attention. Nevertheless I should not have made use of the\r\n latter, if during a stay of three years that we have made together at\r\n Venice, I had not become acquainted with his discretion, his address,\r\n and especially his fidelity, sufficiently well to be able to answer\r\n for him as for myself; it is this therefore which has obliged me to\r\n make him come here. And I have sent him this morning to Pignerol in\r\n consequence of the information which M. Catinat has given me, that\r\n he had twice interrogated Mattioli,[518] who had proposed to get his\r\n father to come to the place where he had been arrested, so that he\r\n might oblige him to go and seek the papers which we demand and bring\r\n them to Pignerol. But since it is necessary to distrust everything\r\n that he says, and as he will doubtless not be able to sustain the\r\n sight of Giuliani when he is confronted with him, in consequence of\r\n all the knavery he has been guilty of, I have wished that he should\r\n accompany the Abbé de Montesquieu to Pignerol, so as to proceed from\r\n that place by M. Catinat’s orders wherever Mattioli might declare\r\n the papers to be concealed. And thus that he who should be charged\r\n with this commission might not only be a safe man, but also have a\r\n complete acquaintance with the country and know the language, so as to\r\n avoid any kind of accident.\r\n\r\n “Two days after Mattioli had been taken to the donjon of Pignerol, I\r\n caused his valet to be conducted thither with all his clothing and\r\n valises by means of one of my servants whom I had already lent to M.\r\n Catinat during the journey which he made to Casale; for this I had\r\n taken the precaution to bear a letter from Mattioli which he had been\r\n made to write and in which he ordered this valet to come to him in\r\n a place where he was obliged to remain three or four days, and from\r\n which he was to depart without again passing through Turin; so that by\r\n this means one obtained all that Mattioli had brought here, without\r\n having recourse to violence. If I had made use of any other means, I\r\n should not have been able to obtain anything from him, since he would\r\n never have been willing of himself to give up to me papers which he\r\n has so much difficulty in resolving to surrender even while he is in\r\n a condition to fear the punishment of his perfidy; and if I had used\r\n towards him the least threat he would infallibly have left Turin the\r\n next day without its being possible to arrest him, except by causing a\r\n scandal which would have been very prejudicial.”\r\n\r\nAmong the papers seized on Matthioly’s person, there were none of those\r\nwhich emanated from the Government of Versailles, such as the treaty\r\nsigned by Pomponne, the instructions given by Louvois, the letter from\r\nLouis XIV. to the Duke of Mantua, and the latter’s ratification. It was\r\nessential to obtain possession of these, so as to deprive the other\r\npowers of the irrefutable testimony of the King of France’s attempt\r\nand failure. Matthioly at first gave incorrect information respecting\r\nthe place where they were to be found. But having been threatened with\r\ntorture,[519] and then with death, the unfortunate Count finished by\r\navowing that the famous papers were at Padua in a place which his\r\nfather alone knew of. A letter was dictated to the prisoner, in which,\r\nwithout even allowing his lot to be suspected, he begged his father\r\nto give all the documents relating to the negotiation to the Sieur\r\nGiuliani, the bearer of the letter.[520] Matthioly’s father, ignorant\r\nthat Giuliani was a spy, delivered everything to him, and the astute\r\nmessenger confided to M. de Pinchesne, the representative of the\r\nKing of France at Venice, the precious originals,[521] which were\r\nimmediately forwarded to Versailles under cover of the embassy.[522]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. was avenged. Arrived at the zenith of his power, arbiter of\r\nthe destinies of Europe, which was submissive and mute, audacious and\r\nmighty enough to arbitrarily annex vast territories to France in time\r\nof peace, having, as yet, broken through all obstacles and triumphed\r\nover all resistance, this potentate had just been tricked by a petty\r\nminister of a petty Italian court. That one of his projects, which\r\nseemed likely to succeed the best--thanks to the weakness as much\r\nas to the division or ignorance of his adversaries--that one of his\r\nprojects, on the execution of which so many important consequences\r\ndepended, and which he had long dreamed over and prepared with infinite\r\nprecaution and care, suddenly failed through the most unforeseen of\r\naccidents--the disaffection of the principal agent of the matter. What\r\na natural subject of raillery for Europe was so great an enterprise\r\nas this, resulting in an issue that was almost grotesque--the first\r\ncheck experienced by the King of France, produced by so insignificant\r\na cause--such disproportion between the importance of the preparations\r\nand their complete inutility--the fear of so grave a peril replaced\r\nby the certainty of being delivered from it! Louis XIV. endeavoured\r\nto save himself by destroying for ever the official proofs of his\r\nattempt and failure, by causing the chief culprit to disappear, and by\r\nrecalling his troops in as secret a manner as he had assembled them at\r\nBriançon. He renounced his enterprise with such promptitude, that in\r\nsome degree he seemed never to have commenced it. It was in vain that\r\nD’Estrades, who was so interested in the success of the negotiation,\r\nand caught at everything in order to prolong it, begged the Government\r\nof Versailles to leave him completely at liberty in this respect.[523]\r\nThe Minister’s refusal was formal, and tinged both with pride and\r\nbitterness. “It is not his Majesty’s intention,” writes Pomponne to\r\nD’Estrades, August 4, 1679, “to follow the course you propose in this\r\naffair, nor to commit so great an enterprise to the measures you might\r\nbe able to take. If he ever forms the design of pursuing it, _you may\r\nbe assured that those of which he may make use will not fail him_.\r\nSo you need not venture to attempt anything in this matter.”[524]\r\nNo doubt the Court of Savoy was fully aware of the intrigue, but\r\nLouis XIV. was master at Turin. No doubt Matthioly’s voice had made\r\nitself heard at Venice and Milan, but it was now stifled for ever; and\r\nwith the recollection of his warnings was to be mingled that of his\r\nmysterious disappearance, and a salutary fear caused by the strangeness\r\nof his fate. Moreover, however humiliated Louis XIV. may have been,\r\nhe still employed most haughty language towards Madrid. He exacted\r\nand obtained from Spain the immediate release of Baron d’Asfeld, who\r\nwas a prisoner at Milan, and also a formal disavowal of the governor\r\nwho had ordered his arrest. For Louis XIV. it was then a check, but\r\na check in part repaired by the prompt abandonment of his projects,\r\nand compensated for by the satisfaction of having rendered powerless\r\nand carried off, as it were, from the world, of having extinguished\r\nthe only being who could bear witness to the first humiliation of a\r\ngreat King. The report was spread abroad that Matthioly had died,\r\nthe victim of an accident encountered on a journey. Those who were\r\nmost entitled to doubt this appeared to believe in it. Charles IV.,\r\nsuspected, if not convicted, by the other princes of having wished to\r\nsell one of the keys of Italy to Louis XIV., sought to forget in fresh\r\npleasures the shame of the enterprise. Matthioly’s family, silent and\r\noverwhelmed, became dispersed. Did it believe in his death? No one\r\nknows. On its genealogical tree the date of Ercole Matthioly’s end\r\nhas been left blank.[525] His wife, the widow of a husband who was to\r\nsurvive her, shut herself up with her sorrow in the convent of the\r\nFilles de Saint-Louis at Bologna, the same place whither, seventeen\r\nyears previously, Matthioly had come to espouse her.[526] His father,\r\nwho received no further intelligence after the letter brought by\r\nGiuliani, dragged on his unhappy existence for some time yet at Padua,\r\nignorant whether he ought to lament the death of a beloved son, or to\r\nflatter himself that he was still alive. Among the members of this\r\nfamily, thus plunged in the most cruel uncertainty, no one dared\r\nto use any exertions, which, however, would have been useless, in\r\norder to endeavour to clear it up. Feeling themselves menaced by the\r\nmysterious blow which had fallen upon one of them, they were silent\r\nand submissive, assured of their want of power, and certain that their\r\ninquiries would be useless, and possibly not unattended with peril.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[497] Matthioly first addressed himself to President Truccki,\r\nex-Minister of Finance to the Regent, then to the latter.\r\n\r\n[498] Archives of the Ministry of War, 686; Archives of the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs, section Mantua, 4; Instructions given to M. de Gomont,\r\nambassador to the Duke of Mantua.\r\n\r\n[499] Letter from M. de Gomont to Louis XIV., May 14, 1680; copy of\r\nLetter from Matthioly to the Empress Eleonora of Austria:--Archives of\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Mantua, 5 and 11.\r\n\r\n[500] The following is the only document which establishes the fact\r\nthat Matthioly received payment from the Spaniards and Venetians.

He did not deny having\r\nspoken of the treaty to certain Venetians and to a partisan of Spain at\r\nPadua, but said he simply told them that the affair had failed; while\r\nas regarded the representative of Austria at Venice, he saw that he\r\nknew all about the treaty from the Duke of Mantua at Venice. In short,\r\nMatthioly pretended generally that the reason the ratification had been\r\ndelayed, was on account of the unwillingness of the Duke, acted upon by\r\nhis mother and the Court of Vienna, to complete the affair:--Letters\r\nfrom Catinat to Louvois, quoted by M. Roux-Fazillac.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[519] “I put him into the greatest possible fear of the torture if he\r\ndid not speak the truth:”--Letter from Catinat to Louvois, Archives of\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[520] Matthioly really wrote this letter, as will be seen by the\r\nannexed extract from a letter sent by Catinat to Louvois, and dated\r\nMay 10, 1679: “I have made him write three letters for the purpose of\r\ngetting possession of the original papers which are at Padua, which\r\nhave been put into the hands of the Sieur Giuliani, by the advice of\r\nthe Abbé d’Estrades, who places an entire confidence in him; he will\r\nmake use of these three letters as he shall judge most fit, according\r\nto the disposition in which he shall find the father of the Sieur de\r\nLestang. The first is only a letter of the Sieur de Lestang to his\r\nfather, in which he acquaints him, that there are reasons which oblige\r\nhim to remain at Turin, or in the neighbourhood, but that he may place\r\nan entire confidence in the Sieur Giuliani, and deliver to him such\r\nand such papers, of which I have made him give the inventory to the\r\nSieur Giuliani. The second acquaints his father with the real state in\r\nwhich he is, and that it is important, as well for his life as for his\r\nhonour, that his papers should be immediately delivered into the hands\r\nof the Sieur Giuliani. In the third, which is the last to be made use\r\nof, in case the first two have no effect, he desires him to come to\r\nTurin, and tells him that at the house of the Abbé d’Estrades he will\r\nbe instructed where he is, and the means to be employed to speak with\r\nhim. The Sieur de Lestang has no doubt of being able, in this interview\r\nbetween him and his father, to persuade the latter to all he may wish.\r\nI have inspired him with so great a fear of the punishments due to his\r\nbad conduct, that I find no repugnance in him to do all that I require\r\nof him:”--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[521] The ratification of the Duke of Mantua was not among them, but\r\nonly several signatures in blank given by this Prince to Matthioly,\r\non one of which the latter asserted that he was to have written the\r\nratification.\r\n\r\n[These sheets signed in blank were never found. The papers recovered\r\nby Giuliani comprised, in addition to the original treaty signed by\r\nMatthioly and M. de Pomponne, the instructions given to the former\r\nwhen he left the French Court, Louvois’ written authority for Pomponne\r\nto treat with Matthioly, and a letter from Louis XIV. to the Duke of\r\nMantua. “The ratification of the Duke of Mantua is not to be found,\r\nalthough the Sieur de Lestang said it was amongst them; whereupon I\r\ninterrogated him, having first obtained all the advantage over him\r\nI could, by abusing him and bringing soldiers into his room as if\r\npreparatory to administering the question[D] to him, which made him so\r\nmuch afraid that he promised to really tell the truth. Being asked\r\nwhether the Duke of Mantua had ratified the treaty, he answered that\r\nhe had never subscribed to all the articles, but that he had got from\r\nhim four blank papers signed, one of which was a blank paper, of two\r\nsheets, at the top of which he had written, ‘Ratification of the\r\ntreaty made with his Most Christian Majesty.’ That there were three\r\nother blank papers signed, of one sheet each, of which he intended to\r\nmake use to write in the name of his master to the three governors of\r\nthe town, citadel, and castle, to order them to receive the King’s\r\ntroops. Being asked where these papers signed in blank are at present,\r\nhe answered, that they are in the hands of the Governor of Casale, to\r\nwhom he sent them at the time that D’Asfeld left Venice. Being asked\r\nwhy he had sent them, without their being filled up, to the Governor\r\nof Casale, he answered he had sent them to him in a letter of Magnus,\r\nthe Secretary of the Duke of Mantua, in which the Governor was ordered\r\nto do, without hesitation, all that should be told him regarding the\r\nexecution of the orders contained in that packet,--that they were left\r\nblank, because he wished to make the ratification according to that of\r\nthe King, not knowing, as he says, the exact form in which it ought\r\nto have been made out. Being asked why in his first examination he\r\nhad said that this ratification was at Padua; he answered that he had\r\nnot wished to tell where it was before Giuliani, in order not to make\r\nhim acquainted in any way with his intelligence with the governor:\r\nhe added that he had never had any other ratification except that\r\none; and that whatever tortures might be inflicted on him, he could\r\nnever tell anything more.”--Letter from Catinat to Louvois, June 3,\r\n1679:--Archives of the Ministry of War.--_Trans._]\r\n\r\n [D] The first form of torture applied to prisoners to force them to\r\n confess.\r\n\r\n[522] Unpublished despatches from the Abbé d’Estrades to Pomponne,\r\nMay 13 and 27, and June 3, 1679:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, section Savoy, 68.

The project for the surrender of\r\nCasale was revived two years later and put into execution, thanks\r\nto the skill of the Abbé Morel, Minister of Louis XIV. to the Duke\r\nof Mantua, and without the intervention of the Abbé d’Estrades. On\r\nSeptember 30, 1681, Louis XIV.’s troops entered Casale. We know what\r\nthis policy led to, and how, at the peace of Ryswick, he was compelled\r\nto surrender everything, even Pignerol, his father’s valuable conquest.\r\nHowever, Louis XIV. was well advised to break off the negotiation\r\nin 1679, since Marshal d’Estrades acquainted him, on March 11, from\r\nNimeguen, “that this new attempt was of a nature to defer the exchange\r\nof the ratifications of the treaty of general peace:”--Unpublished\r\nletter of the Marshal d’Estrades, Imperial Library, Manuscripts,\r\n_Papiers du Maréchal d’Estrades_, vol. xii. p. 1015\r\n\r\n[525] _Arbor priscæ nobilisque masculinæ familiæ de\r\nMatthiolis_:--Archives of the Empire, M. 746.\r\n\r\n[526] Matthioly married in January, 1661, Camilla, widow of Bernardi\r\nPaleotti, by whom he had two sons.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n Period from which the Theory that makes Matthioly the Man with the\r\n Iron Mask dates--Numerous Writers who have concerned themselves with\r\n the Abduction of this Individual--Arguments of Reth, Roux-Fazillac,\r\n and Delort--M.

Poets alone imagine and sing the bitter sorrows\r\nof captivity.\r\n\r\nThe story of Matthioly’s imprisonment derives all its interest from\r\nthe supposition that he may possibly be the Man with the Iron Mask.\r\nOf the life of the captive in his prison, we have nothing or almost\r\nnothing.[527] Louis XIV. has succeeded in surrounding with uncertainty\r\nand mystery the punishment of the audacious man who had deceived him.\r\nA single attempt, if not to corrupt, at least to interest in his lot\r\none of his gaolers, the Sieur de Blainvilliers;[528] by turns the calm\r\nof the prisoner resigned to the definitive loss of his liberty, or\r\nthe momentary madness of the wretched being separated for ever from\r\nall that is dear to him; a few efforts, renewed after long intervals,\r\nto write and make known his name outside the walls within which he is\r\nconfined: this is all that we know, all that we shall ever know of\r\nMatthioly’s captivity. But what prisons did he successively inhabit?\r\nWhere did he drag out his existence, and, above all things, where did\r\nhe terminate it? Ought we to behold in him the Man with the Iron Mask?\r\n\r\nRoux-Fazillac and Delort are generally considered as having been the\r\nfirst to reveal, the one in 1800, and the other in a more complete\r\nmanner in 1825, the existence and abduction of Count Matthioly. This\r\nis a grave error, and we must go back long before these two writers\r\nin order to find the first traces and the first revelations of the\r\ndiplomatic intrigue relative to Casale. In 1682 there appeared at\r\nCologne a political pamphlet[529] in which the whole negotiation was\r\ndisclosed, and in which the Abbé d’Estrades and Matthioly, Giuliani\r\nand Pinchesne, D’Asfeld, Catinat, and the Duke of Mantua figured. In\r\nAugust, 1687, a work, published at Leyden with the title of _Histoire\r\nAbrégée de l’Europe_,[530] gave, under the head of Mantua, a French\r\ntranslation of an Italian letter which denounced the abduction of\r\nMatthioly. In 1749 the famous Muratori related, in his _Annali\r\nd’Italia_,[531] the story of the Casale negotiation, and the abduction\r\nof the principal agent in this intrigue. In the part of the _Journal\r\nEncyclopédique_[532] for August 15, 1770, was a letter from Baron\r\nd’Heiss, ex-captain in the regiment of Alsace, in which the whole of\r\nthis affair was made known; and there is a copy of this letter in\r\nthe number of the _Journal de Paris_[533] for December 22, 1779. In\r\n1786, the Italian Fantuzzi summarized in his _Notizie degli Scrittori\r\nBolognesi_,[534] the accounts already published on this subject. A\r\nsimilar opinion that Matthioly was the Man with the Iron Mask, was, in\r\n1789, supported by the Chevalier de B----, in a work with the title of\r\n_Londres, Correspondance interceptée_.[535] On November 26, 1795, M. de\r\nChambrier, ex-Minister of Prussia to the Court of Turin, read, before\r\nthe Division of Belles-Lettres of the Academy of Berlin,[536] a memoir\r\nin which “he endeavoured to establish, by tradition alone, that the\r\nIron Mask and Ercole Matthioly were one and the same person.” Lastly,\r\nthe 9 Pluviose, Year xi.,[537] the citizen Reth, the commissioner\r\ncharged with organizing the national lottery in the twenty-seventh\r\nmilitary division, addressed a long communication to the _Journal de\r\nParis_[538] tending towards the same conclusion.[539] Thus we see that\r\nneither Roux-Fazillac, nor Delort, nor still less any writer of our\r\nown days, can claim to be first to have put forward the theory that\r\nMatthioly was the Man with the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nHowever, Delort had the incontestable advantage over his numerous\r\npredecessors of furnishing a portion[540] of the official despatches\r\nrelating to the negotiation, and also of those which were exchanged\r\nbetween Saint-Mars and the various Ministers after Matthioly’s\r\nincarceration. Since then, and in our own days, M. Camille Rousset,\r\nin his _Histoire de Louvois_, has in his turn disclosed the intrigue\r\nconcocted by D’Estrades, the Duke of Mantua, and Matthioly; and\r\ncontenting himself with merely giving his opinion on the Iron Mask,\r\nin a short note,[541] has declared that he sees in him the faithless\r\nMinister who betrayed Louis XIV. Depping, in his _Correspondance\r\nAdministrative sous Louis XIV._, also adopts this view. But they have\r\nneither of them endeavoured--nor, indeed, did it belong to their\r\nsubject--to establish what I shall term the perfect agreement and exact\r\ncorrespondence between the individual carried off from near Pignerol,\r\nMay 2, 1679, and the prisoner who was interred in the Church of Saint\r\nPaul, November 20, 1703.\r\n\r\nHere is the knot of the question. We have just seen, and this,\r\nmoreover, has been known since a long time, that Matthioly was carried\r\noff in 1679 by a French ambassador and taken violently to Pignerol. But\r\nit is no longer a question merely of this intrigue, which is simply\r\na preliminary portion of the problem with which we are occupied. It\r\nis necessary to follow the Duke of Mantua’s Minister from prison to\r\nprison, and to ascertain, not only if he may not have been, but also if\r\nhe could have been, any other than the mysterious prisoner conducted in\r\n1698 by Saint-Mars from the Isles Sainte-Marguerite to the Bastille,\r\nwhere he died in 1703. Delort believed he had proved it. His conviction\r\nwas profound, and to many persons his demonstration seemed irrefutable.\r\nOn what grounds, then, did it rest, and how has a judicious writer of\r\nour own days entirely overthrown it?\r\n\r\nOn May 2 and 3, 1679, when Matthioly and his valet were incarcerated\r\nat Pignerol, this State prison contained, besides Fouquet and Lauzun,\r\nfour prisoners, incontestably obscure and of very slight importance.\r\nOne, Eustache d’Auger, brought there August 20, 1669, had for some time\r\nacted as Fouquet’s valet.[542] Another, arrived at Pignerol April 7,\r\n1674, was a Jacobin monk; “a finished scoundrel,” wrote Louvois, “who\r\ncannot be sufficiently maltreated or made to suffer the punishment\r\nhe has deserved.” The Minister recommended Saint-Mars “not to give\r\nhim a fire in his chamber except when great cold or illness obliged\r\nit, and not to provide him with any other diet but bread, wine, and\r\nwater.”[543] Louvois afterwards enjoined Saint-Mars “not to let him\r\nbe seen by any one, nor to give news of him to any person whatever.”\r\nBut this order was in some sort a mere form, since a like injunction\r\nhad been given to Saint-Mars, July 19, 1669, at the time Eustache\r\nd’Auger was sent to him.[544] The latter, as well as the Jacobin monk,\r\nand Caluzio, brought there in September, 1673,[545] and Dubreuil,\r\nimprisoned in June, 1676, were treated in exactly the same manner and\r\nwithout any kind of consideration. The expense for each of them was\r\nnot to exceed twenty sous a day,[546] and they were so insignificant,\r\nthat when Saint-Mars was called from the command of the donjon of\r\nPignerol to the government of Exiles, Louvois requested from him “a\r\nlist of the persons in his charge, begging him to indicate, at the\r\nside of each name, what he knew of the reasons for which they had been\r\narrested.”[547] It is certain, and this has never been a matter of\r\ndoubt to any of those who have occupied themselves with this problem,\r\nthat the Man with the Iron Mask is not to be sought for amongst these\r\nobscure wretches, the causes of whose confinement the Minister himself\r\nhad forgotten. We have seen that Fouquet, undoubtedly, died at Pignerol\r\nduring the month of March, 1680; and, with regard to Lauzun, it is not\r\nless incontestable that he left the citadel April 22, 1681.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of his arrest Matthioly received the fictitious name\r\nof Lestang, as a despatch of Catinat’s clearly shows.[548] He was\r\nsometimes designated by his right name, sometimes by this fictitious\r\none. A letter from Louvois, August 16, 1680, authorises Saint-Mars\r\n“to place the Sieur de Lestang with the Jacobin, so as to avoid\r\nany intercourse between two priests;” and Saint-Mars’ reply, dated\r\nSeptember 7, 1680, shows that Matthioly was confined with the Jacobin\r\nmonk in the lower tower. In this letter Saint-Mars informs the Minister\r\nthat Matthioly at first thought that he had been placed with a spy\r\ncharged to watch him and give an account of his conduct. But the monk,\r\na prisoner since several years, had become mad, of which Matthioly was\r\nsoon convinced “by seeing him one day get out of bed stark naked and\r\npreach, as well as he could, without rhyme or reason.” The same letter\r\nshows Saint-Mars to us just as we have always known him, and watching\r\nthrough a hole over the door what his prisoners were doing.[549]\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1681, Louvois, when announcing to Saint-Mars his nomination\r\nto the governorship of Exiles, rendered vacant by the death of the Duke\r\nde Lesdiguières, “orders him to take with him _the two prisoners of\r\nthe lower Tower_.” According to Roux-Fazillac, Delort, and all those\r\nwho have occupied themselves with this question, these two prisoners\r\nare undoubtedly Matthioly and the Jacobin monk. On January 20, 1687,\r\nSaint-Mars, whose health had been affected by the rigorous climate of\r\nExiles, was appointed to the governorship of the Isles Saint-Honorat\r\nand Sainte-Marguerite in the sea of Provence. He took with him one\r\nprisoner only. Reth and Delort do not hesitate to admit that, of the\r\ntwo prisoners in question, he who was taken by Saint-Mars to the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite was Matthioly. Though unable to furnish a sure proof\r\nof it, they have no doubt. Roux-Fazillac, more circumspect and less\r\npositive, contents himself with remarking that either the Jacobin monk\r\nor Matthioly was the Man with the Iron Mask; and it is by means of\r\ngeneral considerations, by proofs drawn from the mysterious manner in\r\nwhich the abduction had been accomplished, from Louis XIV.’s evident\r\ninterest in concealing such a violation of international law, that\r\nRoux-Fazillac endeavours to prove Matthioly’s identity with the Iron\r\nMask.\r\n\r\nThus, of the very numerous writers who have advanced this opinion,\r\nsome, such as Baron d’Heiss, M. de Chambrier, M. Depping, and\r\nM. Camille Rousset, have done so by only taking account of the\r\ncircumstances accompanying the abduction, by invoking probabilities,\r\nand by showing a preference. Others, such as Roux-Fazillac, Reth, and\r\nDelort, have endeavoured to support their demonstrations with more\r\nprecise and less general proofs, not occupying themselves exclusively\r\nwith the arrest of this individual, but with the captive’s existence\r\nand his changes of prison. They have, in a word, attempted to follow\r\nhim without losing sight of him for an instant, from the moment of his\r\nincarceration to that of his death. How have they succeeded?\r\n\r\nA very sagacious writer, M. Jules Loiseleur, has, for some years\r\npast, applied the processes of a rigorous historical criticism and the\r\nqualities of a penetrative mind to some of those secondary questions\r\nwhich the historian often neglects or avoids, either because they\r\nwould retard the rapidity of his progress, or because their exact\r\nsolution would perhaps be contrary to the general theory upon which\r\nthe _ensemble_ of his task has been conceived. These species of minute\r\ninquiries, pursued according to a judicial model, concentrate the\r\nattention upon certain points, isolated from all others, and present,\r\nwith some inconveniences, some precious advantages. For, if by such\r\na process, we cease to take account of the necessary influence of\r\ngeneral facts, if the marvellous chain of causes and effects be a\r\nlittle neglected, this method, in return, assures to him who employs it\r\nentire liberty to study the question under all its phases, and above\r\nall things frees him from any preconceived idea, from the necessity\r\nof sacrificing himself to a theory, or of obeying too servilely the\r\nconditions of art or the sovereign rules of proportion. It is thus\r\nthat M. Loiseleur has studied,[550] by introducing new documents into\r\nthe discussion, the question of the pretended poisoning of Gabrielle\r\nd’Estrées and of the supposed marriage of Anne of Austria and Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Man with the Iron Mask has also attracted the\r\nscrupulous attention and meditations of this trained mind. M. Loiseleur\r\nhas not brought forward any new documents in considering this question.\r\nIt is to those already published that he has directed his examination,\r\nand to the theory that makes Matthioly the Man with the Iron Mask.[551]\r\nThe following is the first result of his observations.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1681, at the moment when Saint-Mars is about to leave\r\nPignerol for Exiles, of which he had just been named Governor, he\r\nreceives an order from Louvois to defer his departure. The affair of\r\nCasale, abandoned, as we have seen after Matthioly’s arrest, had been\r\ntaken up again two years afterwards. The Abbé Morel, addressing himself\r\ndirectly to the Duke of Mantua to whom he was accredited, had obtained\r\nhis consent, and the treaty of surrender, this time confided to sure\r\nhands, was about to be definitively executed. As before, Boufflers\r\noccupied the frontier with his troops. As before, Catinat is about to\r\npenetrate to Pignerol, in order to proceed afterwards to Casale, and\r\ntake possession of the place. The following is the letter in which\r\nLouvois announces to Saint-Mars the early arrival of Catinat:--\r\n\r\n  “Fontainebleau, August 13, 1681.\r\n\r\n “The King having commanded M. de Catinat to proceed as soon as\r\n possible to Pignerol, on the same business that took him there at\r\n the commencement of the year 1679, I write you these lines by his\r\n Majesty’s order, to give you intelligence thereof, so that you may\r\n prepare him an apartment in which he may remain concealed during three\r\n weeks or a month; and also to tell you that when he shall send to let\r\n you know that he is arrived at the place where you went to meet him\r\n in the said year 1679, it is his Majesty’s intention that you should\r\n go there again to meet him and conduct him into the donjon of the\r\n citadel of the aforesaid Pignerol with all the precautions necessary\r\n to prevent any one’s knowing that he is with you. I do not charge you\r\n to assist him with your servants, your horses, and whatever carriages\r\n he may have occasion for, not doubting that you will do with pleasure\r\n on these heads, whatever he shall ask.”\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Loiseleur the words,--“the same business that took him\r\nthere at the commencement of the year 1679,” signifies to Saint-Mars\r\nthe arrest of a political prisoner. “Since,” says M. Loiseleur, “of\r\nall the occurrences of the negotiation undertaken in 1679, this was\r\nthe only one of which Saint-Mars was officially informed.”[552] This\r\ninterpretation is very important, because M. Loiseleur seems to\r\nconclude from it that in 1681, as in 1679, Catinat was sent to Pignerol\r\nto arrest a new individual, and confide him to the care of Saint-Mars.\r\nWe are unable to share this opinion. The words in question have\r\nevidently only one meaning,--the taking possession of Casale. Catinat\r\nwas not sent to Pignerol to arrest Matthioly, since Louvois’ letter\r\nannouncing to Saint-Mars the first arrival of this officer, is dated\r\nDecember 29, 1678, when there was not only no intention of carrying\r\noff the Mantuan Minister, but when his good offices were continued\r\nto be employed, without the suspicion of any treason, which, indeed,\r\ndid not as yet exist. Moreover, if Catinat remained three months at\r\nPignerol, during January, February and March, 1679, it was because\r\nthe execution of the treaty of Casale was continually hoped for,\r\nand because multiplied and diverse efforts were made to obtain from\r\nMatthioly the exchange of the ratifications. M. Loiseleur says, “There\r\nwas the greatest interest in surrounding Catinat’s mission and his\r\nstay at Pignerol with the most profound mystery; it was necessary, in\r\ntruth, to deceive the vigilance of the Court of Turin, so near to the\r\nscene of the events in preparation, and also of the Germans, Spaniards,\r\nVenetians, and Genoese, who were not less unquiet.” No doubt; and this\r\nis one of the reasons why Catinat took an assumed name. “How then,”\r\nadds this writer, “is it to be explained that Louvois should have\r\nconfided the purpose of this mission to so subordinate an agent as the\r\nCaptain Saint-Mars?”\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is neither searching nor exact. Not only was Saint-Mars\r\nreally in the secret of the political mission entrusted to Catinat\r\nin 1679, but, as we have seen, he also helped him to fulfil it, by\r\naccompanying him to Increa, for the meeting appointed by Matthioly\r\nto exchange the ratifications, by following him to Casale, and by\r\nsharing his danger. Saint-Mars, moreover, far from being a subordinate\r\nagent, possessed, and justly possessed, the entire confidence of Louis\r\nXIV. and Louvois;[553] and despatches which will be quoted hereafter\r\nshow him to have been on the most friendly terms with D’Estrades and\r\nCatinat.[554] The precautions adopted to conceal the stay of the\r\nlatter at Pignerol were designed to leave in ignorance the officers\r\nof the citadel, the notabilities of the town, the governor himself,\r\nthe Marquis d’Herleville--every one, in fact, except Saint-Mars, whose\r\npresence became so indispensable, that, for this reason alone, he\r\ndelayed his departure for Exiles. In fact, in a despatch addressed\r\nto Louvois, April 15, 1679, Catinat complains that the Marquis\r\nd’Herleville suspects his presence in the donjon, and at the same\r\ntime congratulates himself on the precautions which Saint-Mars adopts\r\nwith regard to him.[555] Moreover, we cannot too strongly insist\r\nthat the business which brought Catinat to Pignerol in 1679 was the\r\ntaking possession of Casale. This, for more than three months, was the\r\nappointed object of his exertions. The abduction of Matthioly was only\r\na second commission, much less honourable, and much less worthy of\r\nCatinat than the former. It was confided to him because he was on the\r\nscene of events, and because its accomplishment required a man who was\r\nresolute and sure in acting. But it was for him only an unexpected and\r\nsubordinate character, and formed but an incident, and a sad incident,\r\nof his visit, which could not in any way affect the prime, essential,\r\nand incontestable cause of his being there, viz., to take possession of\r\nCasale.\r\n\r\nM. Loiseleur insists the more upon this unfounded interpretation,\r\nbecause it is almost the sole pretext,[556] I will not say for the\r\ntheory--he is too cautious to call it so--but for the supposition\r\nthat an obscure and unknown spy was arrested by Catinat in 1681, and\r\nconfided, like Matthioly, to Saint-Mars’ care. Nothing, indeed--and M.\r\nLoiseleur does not deny this--absolutely nothing in the history of the\r\nresumption of the negotiations relative to Casale allows us to admit\r\nthe truth of this hypothesis. While in 1679, there was uncertainty,\r\nhesitation, and embarrassment produced by Matthioly’s equivocal\r\nbehaviour, in 1681 everything was simple, clear, and definitive. No\r\ndoubt the preparations were still concealed; but observe the rapidity\r\nof execution and the startling revenge taken by Louis XIV.! On July 8,\r\n1681, the treaty of surrender is signed at Mantua by the Duke himself\r\nand the Ambassador of the King of France. On August 2 Catinat is\r\nordered from Flanders. On the 13th Louvois announces to Saint-Mars the\r\njourney of this officer to Pignerol. From September 1 to 22 the French\r\ntroops muster at Briançon. On the 27th they  arrive at Pignerol. On\r\nthe 30th they enter Casale with the Marquis de Boufflers as commander\r\nand Catinat as governor of this new possession.[557] This time there\r\nwas no intermediary between the negotiators, no obstacle to Louis\r\nXIV.’s project; and no employment of an embarrassing or perfidious\r\nspy. There is nothing that is suspicious, nothing that is obscure\r\nin the despatches relating to this enterprise. There is no void in\r\nthem, nothing has been suppressed. Moreover--and this is a point upon\r\nwhich we cannot too strongly insist--the King, the ministers, and the\r\nambassadors who penned them, could not foresee that they would one day\r\nno longer be buried in the impenetrable archives of Versailles, but be\r\ndelivered to investigation and comment.\r\n\r\nWhere is there anything in them about that obscure spy whom Catinat\r\nis said to have arrested? M. Loiseleur has wished rather to open a\r\nnew field for conjecture than to put forward a definite opinion. He\r\nhas comprehended so well the fragile nature of his train of reasoning\r\nthat he does not hesitate to express himself in the following manner\r\nconcerning this pretended prisoner of 1681:--“There is nothing to\r\nexplain to us his true name, his position in life, or his crime. The\r\nonly two theories which are now current concerning the Iron Mask\r\nare both equally erroneous. This is all that we have intended to\r\nestablish.”[558]\r\n\r\nLet us hasten to say that he has completely succeeded. There is no need\r\nfor us to return to that one of these two theories which makes the\r\nMan with the Iron Mask a brother of Louis XIV.[559] But with reference\r\nto the other, which represents Matthioly as being the masked prisoner,\r\nM. Loiseleur’s refutation of it is very remarkable; and the researches\r\nwhich we have made, as well as the new documents which we have brought\r\nto light, confirm what his clear-sighted sagacity had enabled him to\r\ndiscover. “December 23, 1685,” says M. Loiseleur, “Saint-Mars writes\r\nfrom Exiles to Louvois, ‘My prisoners are always ill and taking\r\nremedies. For the rest, they are very quiet.’ We possess no official\r\ndocument relating to what passed at Exiles during the year 1686; but\r\nit was in this year, as we are about to establish, that Matthioly’s\r\ndeath took place. On January 20, 1687, Saint-Mars learns that the King\r\nhas just conferred on him the governorship of the Isles Honorat and\r\nSainte-Marguerite. He hastens to thank Louvois for it, and adds, ‘I\r\nshall give my orders for the care of my prisoner so well,’ &c. &c.”\r\n\r\nThence M. Loiseleur concludes that either in 1686, or in January,\r\n1687, one of the two prisoners had died.[560] He also adduces the\r\ntestimony of Father Papon, of the Oratory, who, visiting the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite, in 1778, questioned an officer there named Claude\r\nSouchon, then seventy-nine years old, and whose father had formed one\r\nof the free company of the islands in the time of Saint-Mars. Now, both\r\nin a memorandum drawn up at the request of the Marquis de Castellane,\r\ngovernor of the islands, and in his replies to Father Papon, the\r\nSieur Souchon said he had heard from his father that the envoy of the\r\nEmpire--the Duke of Mantua was a prince of the Empire--carried off by\r\norder of Louis XIV., died nine years after his arrest--that is to say,\r\nin 1688.[561] Muratori relates this tradition, and it is also confirmed\r\nby the fact “that the name of Matthioly disappeared entirely from\r\nSaint-Mars’ correspondence previous to his departure from Exiles.”\r\n\r\nThe following despatches from Louvois to Saint-Mars, till now\r\nunpublished, justify M. Loiseleur’s suppositions:--\r\n\r\n  “Fontainebleau. October 9, 1686.\r\n\r\n “I have received the letter that you have written to me the 26th of\r\n last month, which requires no answer except to say that you should\r\n have named to me which of your prisoners it is that has become\r\n dropsical.”\r\n\r\n  “Fontainebleau, November 3, 1686.\r\n\r\n “I have received your letter of the 4th of last month. It is right\r\n to cause that one of your two prisoners who has become dropsical to\r\n confess, when you perceive the appearance of an approaching death.\r\n Till then neither he nor his companion must have any communication.”\r\n\r\n  “Versailles, January 13, 1687.\r\n\r\n “I have received your letter of the 5th of this month, by which I\r\n learn the death of one of your prisoners. I do not reply to you\r\n concerning your desire to change your government, because you have\r\n since learnt that the King has granted you one more important[562]\r\n than yours, with a good climate, at which I am delighted, and I\r\n rejoice again with you at the share which I have taken in what\r\n concerns you.”[563]\r\n\r\nThus we see that the death of one of the two prisoners brought by\r\nSaint-Mars from Pignerol to Exiles is undeniable. Supposing that\r\nwe reject the testimony of the Sieur Souchon--which, although not\r\npossessing the character of an official document, does not the\r\nless deserve the most serious attention--supposing that we are\r\nnot absolutely convinced that the prisoner who died of dropsy was\r\nMatthioly, it is, nevertheless, necessary to admit that the fact of\r\nthis death places in the greatest uncertainty and almost entirely\r\ndestroys the value of the theory put forward by Baron d’Heiss, De\r\nChambrier, Reth, Roux-Fazillac, Delort, Depping, and Rousset. How,\r\nin fact, can one now insist that Matthioly was the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, who mysteriously entered the Bastille September 18, 1698, when we\r\nsee that he was confided to the care of Saint-Mars along with another\r\nprisoner; that one of the two captives died in 1687; and that from this\r\ntime the name of the Mantuan Minister altogether disappears from the\r\ncorrespondence of Louvois and Saint-Mars? After having attentively read\r\nM. Loiseleur’s work, and especially after having found the despatches\r\nconfirming the essential portions of it, I by no means arrived at the\r\nconclusion that Catinat in 1681 abducted some spy, the fact of whose\r\narrest or even existence is altogether devoid of proof; but I acquired\r\nthe conviction that this problem would never receive a definitive\r\nsolution, and that it was impossible to disperse the mysterious gloom\r\nwith which the Man with the Iron Mask was surrounded.\r\n\r\nSuch was my confirmed opinion when, studying more attentively one of\r\nthe despatches which I had been permitted to examine, a new direction\r\nwas impressed on my researches, and led me to a result which I am about\r\nto unfold.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[527] Louvois writes to Saint-Mars, May 15, 1679: “It is not the\r\nintention of the King that the Sieur de Lestang [the name given to\r\nMatthioly after his arrest] should be well treated, nor that, except\r\nthe absolute necessaries of life, anything should be given to him\r\nthat would enable him to pass his time agreeably.” Again, on May 22,\r\nhe writes: “You must keep the individual named Lestang in the severe\r\nconfinement I enjoined in my preceding letters, without allowing him\r\nto see a physician unless you know him to be in absolute need of one.”\r\nIn July he is allowed pen and ink “to put into writing whatever he may\r\nwish to say.” In February, 1680, Saint-Mars writes to Louvois that\r\nLestang “complains that he is not treated as a man of his quality and\r\nthe minister of a great prince ought to be,” to which Louvois replies\r\nin the July following: “With regard to the Sieur de Lestang, I wonder\r\nat your patience, and that you should wait for an order to treat such a\r\nrascal as he deserves when he is wanting in respect to you:”--Louvois\r\nto Saint-Mars and _vice versâ_, Archives of the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[528] “Sir,” said he to him, “here is a ring which I make a present to\r\nyou, and which I beg of you to accept.” It was no doubt the diamond\r\ngiven to Matthioly by Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n[Saint-Mars wrote to Louvois: “I believe he made him this present\r\nas much from fear as from any other cause: this prisoner having\r\npreviously used very violent language towards him, and written abusive\r\nsentences with charcoal on the walls of his room, which had obliged\r\nthat officer to threaten him with severe punishment, if he was not\r\nmore decorous and moderate in his language for the future. When he was\r\nput in the tower with the Jacobin, I charged Blainvilliers to tell\r\nhim, at the same time showing him a cudgel, that it was with that\r\nthe unruly were rendered manageable, and that if he did not speedily\r\nbecome so, he could easily be compelled. This message was conveyed to\r\nhim, and some days afterwards, as Blainvilliers was waiting upon him\r\nat dinner, he said, ‘Sir, here is a little ring which I wish to give\r\nyou, and I beg you to accept of it?’ Blainvilliers replied ‘that he\r\nonly took it to deliver it to me, as he could not receive anything\r\nhimself from the prisoners.’ I think it is well worth fifty or sixty\r\npistoles:”--Letter from Saint-Mars to Louvois, October 26, 1680, quoted\r\nby Roux-Fazillac.--_Trans._]\r\n\r\n[529] _La Prudenza Triomfante di Casale con l’Arni sole de trattati e\r\nnegotiati di Politici della M.

One of the two names is a\r\nsurname.” Now, September 14, 1675, Louvois writes to Saint-Mars: “You\r\nhave done right to give a sergeant and two soldiers to take the Sieur\r\nCaluzio to Lyons, and as to the Sieur Buticary, when the King is at\r\nSaint-Germain, I will willingly speak in his favour and endeavour to\r\nobtain his release.”\r\n\r\n[546] Delort, _Histoire de la Détention des Philosophes_, vol. i. and\r\nRoux-Fazillac.\r\n\r\n[547] Letter from Louvois to Saint-Mars, May 12, 1680.\r\n\r\n[548] Letter from Catinat to Louvois, May 3, 1679.\r\n\r\n[549] Letter from Louvois, August 16, 1680, and from Saint-Mars,\r\nSeptember 7 of the same year.\r\n\r\n[550] _Problèmes Historiques_, Paris.

He is responsible for the barbarous\r\ndevastation of the Palatinate, and for the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes. After having served his Sovereign faithfully for six-and-thirty\r\nyears, he fell under his displeasure, and was only saved from disgrace\r\nby a sudden death, which occurred in 1691, it is said from poison.\r\n\r\n[554] M. Loiseleur afterwards brings forward two arguments which\r\nare as little conclusive as those which have just been discussed.\r\n“Saint-Mars was so persistently left in ignorance,” he says, “that\r\nafter having confided to his lieutenant the care of recovering the\r\nimportant documents concealed at Padua, Catinat thought better of\r\nit, and charged a trusty servant of the Abbé d’Estrades with this\r\nmission.... When Louvois requested the list of the prisoners imprisoned\r\nat Pignerol, with the reasons for which they were detained, he added\r\nto his letter, ‘with reference to the two of the lower tower you need\r\nonly indicate them by this name, without putting anything else.’” If\r\nGiuliani was charged, as we have mentioned in the preceding chapter,\r\nto seek at Padua the papers in the possession of Matthioly’s father,\r\nit was because, being supposed a friend of Matthioly, he would inspire\r\nno suspicion, while it would have been very different if this mission\r\nhad been confided to Saint-Mars’ lieutenant. As for the letter in\r\nwhich Louvois requests from Saint-Mars the names of his prisoners, the\r\ndispensing with information concerning the prisoners in the lower Tower\r\ncan be explained in a very simple manner--by the fact that Louvois knew\r\nall about them, since a short time previously they had been referred to\r\nin the correspondence.\r\n\r\n[555] Delort, p. 206.\r\n\r\n[556] Louvois writes to Saint-Mars, September 20, 1681:--“The King does\r\nnot disapprove of your going from time to time to see the last prisoner\r\nthat you have in your care, when he is settled in his new prison.” M.\r\nLoiseleur concludes from this that at this period there was only one\r\nprisoner, and as two are again spoken of afterwards, he infers that a\r\nnew prisoner was confided to Saint-Mars. We shall hereafter concern\r\nourselves with this despatch, the meaning of which we shall explain.\r\n\r\n[557] Archives of the Ministry of War; _Mémoire de Chamlay_ on the\r\nevents of 1678 to 1688:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\nsections Mantua and Savoy.\r\n\r\n[558] _Revue Contemporaine_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n[559] See Chapters I. to V. of the present work.\r\n\r\n[560] _Revue Contemporaine_, p. 209, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[561] This is within a year of the date that M.

The approach to\r\nthem is rendered far from easy by the rocks and reefs with which nature\r\nhas surrounded them. Both are oblong in shape, lying from east to west,\r\nand the one nearest to the shore is also much the larger. Owing to\r\nthe great number of pines with which they are covered, the view from\r\nthem is limited; but if we ascend one of the highest towers, we behold\r\nthe most dazzling and wonderful of pictures. On every  side is a\r\nmarvellous profusion of light; just in front of us is Cannes, and its\r\nelegant villas, bathed by the waves of the sea; a little further inland\r\nlies the magnificent valley of Grasse, with its hills covered with\r\nolive-trees, its green mountain-slopes, and luxuriant vegetation;[565]\r\non the left is the sharp and varied outline of the long chain of the\r\nEsterel; on the right, the Maritime Alps, almost touching the sky, with\r\ntheir snowy summits glittering in the sun; and in the background, a\r\npile of savage mountains and gigantic rocks forms a striking contrast\r\nwith this privileged spot, and provides for it at once both a sure\r\nshelter and a most picturesque framework.\r\n\r\nThese two islands, so appropriately situated for the embellishment\r\nof these peerless localities, have no share in the life or animation\r\nthat surrounds them. As a rule, uncultivated, and inhabited solely\r\nby their garrison and a few fishermen’s families, intersected here\r\nand there by ancient salt-marshes, and of a sad and monotonous\r\nappearance, one would say that they belonged altogether to the past.\r\nOn these tranquil coasts everything tends to meditation and to poetry.\r\nDay-dreams are natural and easy here, for there is nothing to disturb\r\nthe grand recollections which the spot evokes, and in which history\r\nand legend have an equal share. The Romans have occupied these islets;\r\npious hermits have established themselves on them; the Saracens have\r\ninvaded and the Spaniards have pillaged them in turn.[566] In the early\r\npart of the fifth century, Saint-Honorat founded a monastery here,\r\nwhich was for a long time the most celebrated of Gaul, and in which\r\nthousands of apostles were trained in virtue and knowledge, of whom\r\nsome became celebrated bishops, and very many martyrs.[567] Everywhere\r\non this land of the past vestiges of ancient buildings[568] are to be\r\nperceived, and traces of savage devastation. Everywhere the uncertain\r\nand poetic recollections preserved by tradition are mingled with the\r\nunquestionable events of the history of France. Here, in the smaller\r\nof the two islands, is still to be seen the inexhaustible well that,\r\naccording to the legend, Saint-Honorat caused to be dug, and from which\r\nfresh water miraculously issued forth on to a salt and arid shore till\r\nthen deprived of it. Not a long while ago one used to be shown the\r\nplace where the Saint, perched on a high tree, escaped the flood of\r\nwaters he had called forth by his prayers, and which, on afterwards\r\nretiring, carried off with them the serpents with which the islands\r\nwere infested. It was here also that Francis I. stopped when a prisoner\r\nof the Spaniards after the fatal battle of Pavia, and this was the\r\nlast spot of French earth trodden by the unfortunate monarch before\r\ncommencing his rigorous captivity. It was here also--a recollection\r\nat once sad and glorious--that Prince Eugène and the Duke of Savoy\r\nencountered the most obstinate resistance when they were invading the\r\nSouth of France, and were marching first upon Cannes and then upon\r\nToulon by the road bordering the sea.[569] It was from here that the\r\ncannon-shots were fired which, by delaying the enemy’s march, gave\r\ntime for Toulon to be defended; and after the raising of the siege, it\r\nwas the attack from here that compelled the Germans and Piedmontese,\r\non their return, to leave the sea-shore, and take refuge among the\r\nhills and mountains, where they fell under the multiplied blows of the\r\nenergetic peasants of Provence.\r\n\r\nSuch are these two islands, sometimes designated under the common\r\nname of the Lerins, but better known under that of the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite and Saint-Honorat, where the most varied remains\r\nabound, but which the residence of the Man with the Iron Mask has\r\nespecially rendered for ever famous. Such are the spots which it\r\nis impossible to visit, pronounce the name of, or call to mind\r\nthe recollection, without both the name and the recollection of\r\nthe mysterious prisoner who was confined in the larger of the two\r\nislands--that of Sainte-Marguerite--immediately recurring also.\r\nWhether we follow the tradition which represents the masked man as\r\nbeing brought to Saint-Mars in this island,[570] or whether we think\r\nthat he was conducted thither by Saint-Mars himself, it is undeniable\r\nthat in 1698 the gaoler and his captive departed thence, for the\r\npurpose of undertaking that journey which was mysteriously pursued\r\nacross France, exciting everywhere an inquisitive astonishment, having\r\nVilleneuve-le-Roi for its principal halting-place and the Bastille for\r\ntermination. It is not less certain (and the unimpeachable journal[571]\r\nof Dujonca is evidence of this) that the individual conducted to Paris\r\nby Saint-Mars “in his litter, was an old prisoner whom he had at\r\nPignerol.”\r\n\r\nWho was this prisoner?\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that there nowhere exists a collection of documents\r\nspecially relating to the Man with the Iron Mask. Louis XIV. had too\r\ngreat an interest in surrounding this individual with uncertainty and\r\nobscurity for him to have been pleased to collect and leave behind him\r\nsure proofs of his identity. This interest in concealing the existence\r\nof the captive became, as we shall see further on, very much greater at\r\nthe time of his removal to the Bastille. So his real name disappeared\r\nalmost entirely, and he was simply termed “the prisoner from Provence.”\r\nIt is consequently necessary to go back long before the date of this\r\nremoval, in order to establish his identity, and this can only be done\r\nby comparing a great number of despatches, no one of which furnishes\r\nof itself an unexceptionable proof, though their comparison and the\r\nlogical deductions to be derived from them enable us to come to a sure\r\nconclusion. We must therefore request from our readers, especially at\r\nthis stage of the argument, a close and sustained attention.\r\n\r\nWe have terminated the preceding chapter by stating that M. Jules\r\nLoiseleur has pronounced a decisive judgment on the question of the\r\nMan with the Iron Mask, and we defy any attentive reader to study his\r\nwork without becoming convinced that the problem will never be solved.\r\nBut M. Loiseleur has made his inquiry merely with reference to the\r\ndocuments as yet published. “His demonstrations, so clear, luminous,\r\nand peremptory,” a critic has observed, “have exhausted the question,\r\nand, in default of fresh documents, no profound mind will again recur\r\nto it.”[572] It is these fresh documents which I am about to introduce\r\ninto the discussion, and I will proceed to state how I was led to\r\nsuppose their existence, and afterwards how I became the first to\r\nestablish it.\r\n\r\nAn unpublished despatch, addressed by Louvois to Saint-Mars, January 5,\r\n1682, is thus conceived:--\r\n\r\n “I have received your letter of the 28th of last month. You do not\r\n know what is advantageous for you, when you ask to exchange the\r\n governorship of Exiles for the command of the Château of Casale, which\r\n brings in only two thousand livres of salary. Consequently I do not\r\n advise you to think of it.”[573]\r\n\r\nAt first this despatch appears insignificant enough. It seems to\r\nfurnish but one proof more of Louvois’ kindly interest for Saint-Mars,\r\nan interest which was due to the Minister’s intense affection for his\r\nmistress, Madame Dufresnoy, sister-in-law to Saint-Mars, and also,\r\nwhich is perhaps a more legitimate reason, to the perfect devotion and\r\ntried fidelity of the gaoler of Fouquet and Lauzun. However, on reading\r\nit over again, I asked myself how Saint-Mars could dream, if Matthioly\r\nwas one of his prisoners, of soliciting to be sent to Casale, to a town\r\naltogether Italian and even Mantuan, where Matthioly might certainly\r\nhave succeeded, if not in escaping (we know that Saint-Mars’ prisoners\r\ncould scarcely indulge in that hope), at least in giving information\r\nconcerning himself, and revealing his situation. But the sole motive of\r\nLouvois’ refusal is, as we have just seen, the smallness of the salary\r\ngiven to the commandant of Casale. If Saint-Mars, to suppose what could\r\nnever have happened, had misconceived the danger likely to be caused\r\nby Matthioly’s presence at Casale, even as a prisoner, it is beyond\r\ndoubt that Louvois, naturally cautious (and here caution would have\r\nbeen a duty) would have written to him in something like the following\r\nwords: “I am astonished that you should have formed the design of\r\nremoving to Casale. It is necessary to give it up entirely.” But on the\r\ncontrary, Louvois finds no other inconvenience in this plan than that\r\nof the inferiority of the salary attached to the duties of Casale, and\r\nhe concludes with these words: “I do not advise you to think of it.”\r\nIt is the friend full of solicitude who speaks, and not the Minister\r\nenergetically rejecting a proposal so contrary to the interests\r\nconfided to him.\r\n\r\nIt was this despatch which first suggested to me the idea that,\r\ncontrary to the general opinion, Matthioly was not taken by Saint-Mars\r\nfrom Pignerol to Exiles. As yet this was, it is true, but a very\r\nweak presumption, which was destroyed by proofs that were apparently\r\nirrefutable and had been accepted as such up to the present. We have,\r\nin fact, seen that Matthioly, a short time after his arrest, was\r\nplaced in the lower Tower at Pignerol, and it was the prisoners of\r\nthis tower whom Saint-Mars was ordered to conduct to Exiles. Louvois’\r\ndespatch[574] of June 9, 1681, concludes with these words: “With regard\r\nto the effects belonging to the Sieur Matthioly, which are in your\r\npossession, you will have them taken to Exiles, in order to be able to\r\ngive them back to him if his Majesty should ever order him to be set at\r\nliberty.” This is an explicit statement, and has naturally confirmed\r\nevery one in the opinion that Matthioly was removed from Pignerol to\r\nExiles. But the doubt which the despatch of January 5, 1682, had made\r\nme conceive, was changed into certainty when I read the following\r\nletter, written by Saint-Mars, to the Abbé d’Estrades, June 25, 1681,\r\nand to be found in minute among the Estrades’ manuscripts in the\r\nImperial Library:--\r\n\r\n  “June 25, 1681.\r\n\r\n “Sir, I should not deserve your pardon if I was certain of having\r\n the government of Exiles without doing myself the honour to inform\r\n you of it, and besides the respect which I have for you, Sir, I am\r\n indebted to you to such a degree that I should be an ungrateful and\r\n dishonest man if, during the whole of my life, I did not honour you\r\n with the utmost affection and respect. Rely on me, Sir, as being the\r\n most devoted person in the world towards yourself and bound for the\r\n remainder of my days with heart and love to your service. I only\r\n received yesterday my supplies as governor of Exiles with two thousand\r\n livres of salary; my free company is preserved to me as well as two\r\n of my lieutenants, and I shall also have in custody two crows, whom\r\n I have here, who have no other names than Messieurs of the lower\r\n Tower; Matthioli will remain here with two other prisoners. One of my\r\n lieutenants named Villebois will look after them, and he has a warrant\r\n to command either in the citadel or in the donjon during my absence,\r\n and until M. de Rissan returns, or his Majesty shall have provided for\r\n this office of Lieutenant of the King by naming some other person. The\r\n Chevalier de Saint-Martin has been appointed Major of Montlouis with a\r\n salary of seven hundred crowns, and Blainvilliers, his comrade, Major\r\n of the citadel of Metz, with the same pay. I do not expect to leave\r\n here before the end of next month. I could if I chose go there from\r\n time to time in order to have the repairs made which are necessary\r\n for the good of the service, as I have received my orders to go into\r\n this place of exile whenever I please; but as nothing presses, and as\r\n it will be necessary to take up my residence in this place in order\r\n to pass the winter there with the whole of my family and the bears,\r\n it will take time for me to accommodate myself as well as possible.\r\n What consoles me is that I shall have the honour of being near to the\r\n States of their Royal Highnesses, to whom I am as much a debtor as a\r\n very respectful and humble servant.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, Matthioly was not the prisoner who died at Exiles, the\r\ncommencement of January, 1687.[575] He was therefore left at Pignerol,\r\nwhere we shall soon meet with him again in charge of the Sieur de\r\nVillebois. Louis XIV. at first had the idea of having him removed to\r\nExiles, as is proved by Louvois’ despatch of June 9, 1681, the last\r\nsentence of which we have quoted. But it is none the less certain\r\nthat this first design was abandoned, and that Matthioly was left at\r\nPignerol.\r\n\r\nThere is also another remarkable expression in Saint-Mars’ letter. He\r\nwrites, “I shall also have in custody two crows” (_merles_). Now even\r\nin our own time the word “crow” (_merle_) is applied only to common\r\nand insignificant persons, of as little notoriety as importance.\r\nUp to the present, however, it is in one of these two “crows” that\r\npeople have seen the Man with the Iron Mask. Is it objected that one\r\nproof alone is not sufficient to establish the entire obscurity of\r\nthese two prisoners of Saint Mars? But this is confirmed also by all\r\nwe have said concerning the treatment of which Saint-Mars’ prisoners\r\nat Pignerol were the objects, with the exception of Fouquet, Lauzun,\r\nand Matthioly.[576] Is additional testimony required? “You can have\r\nclothes made for your prisoners,” writes Louvois to Saint-Mars at\r\nExiles, December 14, 1681; “_but it is necessary that the clothes of\r\npeople like these should last three or four years_.”[577] As usual, the\r\nMinister’s orders were punctually executed by his representative, and\r\nwhen Saint-Mars left Exiles to proceed to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nhe wrote to Versailles “that the prisoner’s bed was so old and worn\r\nout” (we have previously seen that one of the prisoners was still alive\r\nin 1687, the other having died in the early part of January of the same\r\nyear), “as well as everything he made use of, both table-linen and\r\nfurniture, that it was not worth while to bring them here; they only\r\nsold for thirteen crowns.”[578] Assuredly if this is the Man with the\r\nIron Mask, and if he had that delicate taste for fine linen, of which\r\nso much has been said, he must have found considerable difficulty in\r\ngratifying it.\r\n\r\nSaint-Mars arrives at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, which as yet had\r\nnot been used as a State Prison, as they are at present.[579] Obeying\r\nLouvois’ orders he causes some new buildings to be erected,[580] in\r\nwhich he receives in turns various prisoners, especially Protestant\r\nministers.[581] Does the gaoler’s behaviour change at this period?\r\nIs it then that we find a trace of those peculiarities which are so\r\nabundantly proved, and which form one of the characteristic features of\r\nthe story of the Man with the Iron Mask? The following despatch from\r\nBarbézieux to Saint-Mars will furnish us with an answer:--\r\n\r\n  “At the Camp before Namur, June 29, 1692.[582]\r\n\r\n “I have received your letter of the fourth of this month. When any of\r\n the prisoners confided to your care will not do what you order them,\r\n or cause a mutiny, you have only to[583] punish them as you may think\r\n proper.”\r\n\r\nIt has been unceasingly repeated that Saint-Mars never quitted his\r\nfamous prisoner from the moment that he received him in charge. This is\r\nagain one of the features characterizing the mysterious captive, and\r\nthe two men are in some degree always represented as the prisoners of\r\none another. Do we find, either at Exiles or during the first years of\r\nSaint-Mars’ residence at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, this significant\r\npeculiarity? We are about to see:--\r\n\r\n  “December 14, 1681.\r\n\r\n “Nothing prevents you from going to Casale from time to time, in order\r\n to see Monsieur Catinat.”[584]\r\n\r\n  “December 22, 1681.\r\n\r\n “His Majesty does not disapprove of your sleeping away from Exiles for\r\n one night when you desire to pay a visit in the neighbourhood.”[585]\r\n\r\n  “Turin, January 9, 1682.\r\n\r\n “Monsieur de Saint-Mars arrived at Turin yesterday. _Some time ago\r\n when he passed through here_ he did me the honour to stop with me.\r\n But this time M. de Masin has the preference.”[586]\r\n\r\n  “April 18, 1682.\r\n\r\n “The King does not disapprove of your going to pay your respects to\r\n the Duke of Savoy.”\r\n\r\n  “March 7, 1685.\r\n\r\n “The King is willing that you should go for change of air to the place\r\n you may think best for your health.”\r\n\r\n  “March 20, 1685.\r\n\r\n “Madame de Saint-Mars having told me that you wished to go to the\r\n baths of Aix in Savoy, I have informed the King, and his Majesty\r\n has commanded me to acquaint you that he is pleased to grant you\r\n permission to absent yourself from Exiles on this ground for the space\r\n of a fortnight or three weeks.”\r\n\r\n  “July 5, 1688.[587]\r\n\r\n “The King approves of your absenting yourself from the place where you\r\n command, two days a month, and also of your returning the Governor of\r\n Nice the visit he has paid you.”[588]\r\n\r\nThus, save the precautions taken to prevent an escape--and we have seen\r\nthat these were prescribed to Saint-Mars, in the same form and with the\r\nsame minute instructions, for all prisoners alike, whoever they might\r\nbe, even for that Eustache d’Auger, who was turned into a servant for\r\nFouquet--save, I say, these precautions, necessary but exaggerated\r\nby Saint-Mars’ scruples, we do not find in these two captives any of\r\nthe essential characteristics of the Man with the Iron Mask. Not that\r\nwe accept all those with which romance has adorned him. But, however\r\ninsignificant exact history may represent him, is he to be recognized\r\nin one of those two men,[589] termed “crows” by Saint-Mars, “these sort\r\nof people” by Louvois, treated in the manner we have seen; the total\r\nvalue of whose effects, linen, and furniture, was only thirteen crowns,\r\nand whom their gaoler received permission to leave frequently and for\r\nconsiderable periods of time?\r\n\r\nBut there is another result of our researches, quite as unknown as that\r\nwhich we have just set forth.\r\n\r\nSaint-Mars is at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, which he does not scruple\r\nto leave from time to time. All at once, on February 26, 1694, the\r\nMinister announces to him the approaching arrival at the islands of\r\nthree State prisoners who are then in the donjon of Pignerol. He\r\ninquires of Saint-Mars “if there are secure places to confine them\r\nin,” and orders him to make preparations, repairs, and the necessary\r\narrangements for their reception.[590] In another letter, on  the\r\nfollowing 20th of March, Barbézieux adds these words, the great\r\nimportance of which it is unnecessary to point out: “You well know\r\nthat they are of more importance, _at least, one of them_, than those\r\nwho are now at the islands, and you ought to place them by preference\r\nin the most secure prisons.”[591] Then he orders him “to prepare the\r\nfurniture and plate necessary for their use, and impresses upon him\r\nthat the works which he is compelled to have done should be ready on\r\ntheir arrival.” By the same courier he forwards fifteen hundred livres\r\nto meet the first expenses.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, in fact, three prisoners arrived at the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite, surrounded by a very strong escort, in charge of\r\nthe commandant of Pignerol, who alone gave them their food,[592] and\r\nguided by two sure men sent on in advance by the Governor; among these\r\nprisoners, as we shall see hereafter, was the one whom Saint-Mars some\r\nyears later took to the Bastille.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[564] Thus named on account of a cross to which pilgrimages were\r\nformerly made:--_Promenades de Nice_, by Émile Negrin, p. 273.\r\n\r\n[565] _Visite aux Îles de Lérins_, by the Abbé Alliez, 1840.\r\n\r\n[566] _Notice sur Cannes et les Îles des Lérins_, by M.

With respect to the testimony of\r\nthe Sieur Souchon, which, following M. Loiseleur, we have given in the\r\npreceding chapter, it is rather confused in the _Mémoires d’un Voyageur\r\nqui se repose_ (vol. ii. pp. 204-210 of Bossange’s edition), and very\r\nclear in the work of Father Papon, but with the signification of _the\r\ndeath of the servant_ and not of Matthioly himself. The following is\r\nthe passage from the _Voyage Littéraire de Provence_ (pp. 148, 149,\r\nedition 1780), integrally reproduced: “The person who waited on the\r\nprisoner died at the Isle Sainte-Marguerite. The father of the officer\r\nof whom I have just spoken (Souchon, seventy-nine years old), who was\r\nin certain matters the man of confidence of M. de Saint-Mars, had\r\nalways told his son that he had taken the dead man from his prison\r\nat the hour of midnight, and had carried him on his shoulders to the\r\nburial-ground.”\r\n\r\n[576] We shall refer hereafter to the treatment of Matthioly.\r\n\r\n[577] Archives of the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[578] Letter given by Delort, p. 284.\r\n\r\n[579] In 1633, Richelieu had the Fort Royal built on the northern shore\r\nof the Isle Sainte-Marguerite, but it was on the arrival of Saint-Mars\r\nthat the buildings were erected which were to serve for prisoners of\r\nvery various classes. The following unpublished letter, written by M.\r\nde Grignan, Lieutenant-General of Provence, September 29, 1691, proves\r\nthat previous to this date the Isle Sainte-Marguerite was a State\r\nPrison:--\r\n\r\n“The guard which I had placed at Cannes have arrested a sailor,\r\nsupposed to belong to Oneglia, who was coming from the direction of\r\nGenoa, and who, from his replies, in which he has varied a great deal,\r\nhas given grounds for belief that he has been put ashore by the Spanish\r\ngalleys and is a spy, who, under pretence of carrying to Toulon a\r\nletter from a captain of Genoa, was going there to obtain information.\r\nHe has been taken to the Isles of Sainte-Marguerite.\r\n\r\n  “L. DE GRIGNAN, L. G. of Provence.\r\n\r\n  “September 29, 1691, to M. de Pontchartrain.”--Archives\r\n  of the Ministry of Marine, Correspondence.\r\n\r\nAnother letter, dated July 21, 1681, from Count de Grignan to M. de\r\nPontchartrain, shows that the island was beginning to be armed for the\r\ndefence of the coast:--\r\n\r\n“M. de Saint-Mars, governor of the islands of Sainte-Marguerite and\r\nSaint-Honorat de Lérins, speaks to me of provisions which he is obliged\r\nto fetch from the mainland, and of the twenty-five pieces of cannon\r\nwhich require carriages.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[580] In a despatch dated January 8, 1688, Saint-Mars hastens to\r\napprise Louvois that his new prisons are quite ready and waiting to be\r\noccupied:--\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,--I will do myself the honour to tell you that I have\r\nplaced my prisoner, who is generally in bad health, in one of the new\r\nprisons which I have had built according to your instructions. They are\r\nlarge, lofty, and light, and considering their excellence, I do not\r\nthink that there are any stronger or more secure in Europe, and in like\r\nmanner for everything that can concern the giving of intelligence by\r\nword of mouth from near and far, which was not the case in the places\r\nwhere I have had the care of the late Monsieur Fouquet from the moment\r\nthat he was arrested. With a little precaution one might even allow\r\nthe prisoners to walk about the whole of the island, without any fear\r\nof their escaping or of their giving or receiving news. I take the\r\nliberty, monseigneur, to point out to you in detail the excellence of\r\nthis place in case you may at any time have prisoners whom you wish to\r\nput in perfect security with a fair amount of liberty.\r\n\r\n“Throughout this province people say that mine is Monsieur de Beaufort\r\nand others the son of the late Cromwell.”\r\n\r\n[581] The greater portion of the despatches relating to the\r\nProtestants confined in the islands have been given by Depping in his\r\n_Correspondance Administrative sous Louis XIV._.\r\n\r\n[582] Unpublished despatch from Barbézieux to Saint-Mars, June 29,\r\n1692:--Archives of the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[583] The following words are here erased:--“beat them severely, and.”\r\n\r\n[584] Unpublished despatch from Louvois to Saint-Mars:--Archives of the\r\nMinistry of War.\r\n\r\n[585] _Ibid._:--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[586] Manuscripts of the Imperial Library, _Papiers d’Estrades_. This\r\nletter and several others in the same collection are a proof of the\r\nfriendship which subsisted between Saint-Mars and the Abbé d’Estrades.\r\n\r\n“On the first of next month, Monsieur de Catinat,” we read in a letter\r\nfrom Saint-Mars to the Abbé d’Estrades, September 27, 1681, “will be\r\nthe governor of the citadel which you have brought into the King’s\r\npossession.” He refers to Casale, and these words would suffice to\r\nprove, what is already attested by the active part played by Saint-Mars\r\nwith Catinat in 1679, viz., that Saint-Mars had been kept informed\r\nof all the details of the two negotiations. Consequently, as we have\r\nalready shown in the preceding chapter, the famous sentence of Louvois’\r\ndespatch to Saint-Mars, August 13, 1681--“The King having ordered\r\nMonsieur de Catinat to proceed as soon as possible to Pignerol _on the\r\nsame business which took him there at the commencement of the year\r\n1679_”--has and can have only one meaning, that is to say, the taking\r\npossession of Casale, and not the arrest of a new prisoner.\r\n\r\nBut M. Loiseleur brings forward another argument in order to attempt to\r\nprove that an obscure spy was arrested by Catinat in 1681. This is the\r\nfollowing letter from Louvois to Saint-Mars, September 20, 1681:--“The\r\nKing does not disapprove of your going from time to time to see the\r\nlast prisoner whom you have in charge, when he is settled in his new\r\nprison, and has left that in which you are keeping him. His Majesty\r\ndesires that you shall execute the order which he has sent you,” &c.\r\nAnd the same critic concludes, from a despatch from Saint-Mars to\r\nLouvois, March 11, 1682, which again mentions two prisoners, that,\r\nbetween September 20, 1681, and March 11, 1682, a new prisoner was\r\nconfided to Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\nLet us remark, firstly, that the space of time in question is much\r\nmore limited still. M. Loiseleur only made use of documents already\r\npublished. But, November 18, 1681, Louvois, in a despatch as yet\r\nunprinted, says to Saint-Mars, with reference to his prisoners: “The\r\nKing approves of your choosing a doctor to visit your prisoners, and of\r\nyour employing the Sieur Vignon to confess them once a year.” From this\r\nit would appear that a new prisoner was confided to Saint-Mars, between\r\nSeptember 20 and November 18, 1681; but, as we have already said in\r\nthe last chapter, there is nowhere any trace of this prisoner, this\r\nso-called spy. On the other hand, for the despatch of September 20,\r\n1681, to have the meaning which M. Loiseleur attributes to it, one of\r\nthe two prisoners of the lower Tower must have died some days previous\r\nto September 20, since at this date only one prisoner is spoken of. Of\r\nthis death or disappearance we have no proof or even trace. Thus the\r\nwhole argument rests upon this single despatch, of which M. Loiseleur\r\nnot only makes use in order to prove that a new prisoner had been\r\nconfided to Saint-Mars, but from which he also deduces that one of the\r\nprisoners previously confined had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis single despatch thus standing alone, and completely unsupported,\r\nwould be far from being sufficient to establish this theory.\r\nNevertheless, it is essential to discover its true meaning, so as\r\nto leave no doubt in the reader’s mind, and to make every part\r\nof our demonstration clear and plain. I acknowledge having spent\r\na considerable time in thinking over this despatch, which was\r\ncontradicted by all the others, which suited no theory, and which\r\nwas nevertheless authentic and very exactly reproduced, since I\r\nwent several times to read the draft of it, at the Archives of the\r\nMinistry of War. Even if it had possessed the meaning that M. Loiseleur\r\nattributed to it, it would not have destroyed my conclusions at\r\nall, since the proofs which I had furnished of the obscurity of the\r\nExiles prisoners were also applicable to this new prisoner brought\r\nbetween November and September, 1681, and because the superior\r\nimportance of the prisoners afterwards taken from Pignerol to the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite, would not have been demonstrated any the\r\nless clearly by the despatches which I am about to quote. But it\r\nwas repugnant to me to leave a single point obscure; and after much\r\nreflection, and after having been for a long while of M. Loiseleur’s\r\nopinion, although nothing outside of this despatch justifies his\r\ninterpretation, I believe that I have discovered its true meaning.\r\n\r\n“The King does not disapprove,” says the despatch which we are\r\ndiscussing, “of your going from time to time to see the last prisoner\r\nwhom you have in charge, when he is settled in his new prison and\r\nhas left that in which you are keeping him.” At first I thought it\r\nvery strange that one of Saint-Mars’ prisoners should “settle” in his\r\nprison without his gaoler, and connecting this fact with the numerous\r\ndespatches which show that at this period, or at least at one not very\r\nremote from it, Saint-Mars still had two prisoners, I have ended by\r\nconcluding that the word “prisoner” is not used here by Louvois in its\r\nordinary sense, but figuratively. I then recollected that in 1681, as\r\nin 1679, Catinat was at Pignerol, and treated in appearance at least as\r\na prisoner. The following despatch from Catinat to Louvois, September\r\n6, 1681, leaves no doubt on the subject: “I have called myself Guibert,\r\n(we have seen that in 1679, he had taken the name of Richemont), and\r\nI am supposed to be an engineer _who has been arrested_ by the King’s\r\norders for having deserted with a number of plans of places on the\r\nfrontiers of Flanders. M. de Saint-Mars _keeps me here with every\r\nappearance of my being a prisoner_,” &c. On the other hand, during\r\nCatinat’s two stays at Pignerol, with two years’ interval between them,\r\na profound friendship had sprung up between him and Saint-Mars. The\r\ndespatch which we are discussing was dated September 20, 1681. Now, on\r\nthe 28th, Catinat was to leave, and indeed did leave Pignerol, and on\r\nOctober 1, he was installed at Casale as governor. In an unpublished\r\nletter from Saint-Mars to the Abbé d’Estrades, September 27, 1681, is\r\nan expression which explains everything: “I have given your letter to\r\nM. de Catinat, and he will have the honour to communicate with you when\r\nhe is _settled_. He leaves to-morrow, Sunday, with the infantry, and no\r\none is more your servant than he is. The first of next month he will\r\nbe received as governor of the citadel which you have brought into the\r\nKing’s possession (Casale).”--Imperial Library, Manuscripts, _Papiers\r\nd’Estrades_. Now this very expression, “when he is settled,” occurs in\r\nLouvois’ despatch, September 20, which Saint-Mars had just received\r\nwhen he was writing to d’Estrades.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said, why does Louvois make use of the words “in his\r\nnew prison” to describe Casale? Because, no doubt, Catinat had not left\r\nLouvois ignorant that a monotonous residence at Casale was disagreeable\r\nto him, and that he would very much prefer to return to the army of\r\nFlanders. Lastly, December 14, 1681, Louvois writes to Saint-Mars, who,\r\nfrom his excessive scruples, had probably renewed his request for an\r\nauthorisation: “Nothing need prevent your going to Casale from time to\r\ntime, in order to visit M. Catinat.”\r\n\r\nIt is therefore to Catinat that reference is made in the despatch\r\nof September 20, 1681, to Catinat, the last of the prisoners whom\r\nSaint-Mars still had in his care, for, since the month of June,\r\nMatthioly had been confided to Villebois, and the two prisoners left\r\nto Saint-Mars were two “crows,” whom no doubt he had already taken to\r\nExiles.\r\n\r\nIt is to Catinat that he refers, and this despatch can no longer be\r\nmade to serve as a pretext for the theory according to which a new\r\nprisoner was arrested by Catinat in 1681.\r\n\r\n[587] Saint-Mars was now at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite.\r\n\r\n[588] This and the three preceding despatches are from Louvois to\r\nSaint-Mars, and are to be found in the Archives of the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[589] The “crow” taken by Saint-Mars to the Islands was undoubtedly the\r\nJacobin monk, as is proved by the following despatch from Barbézieux to\r\nSaint-Mars: “Versailles, August 13, 1691--Your letter of the 26th of\r\nlast month has been handed to me. When you have anything to inform me\r\nconcerning the prisoner who has been in your charge for the last twenty\r\nyears, I beg you to adopt the same precautions as you made use of when\r\ncommunicating with M. de Louvois.” Twenty years is undoubtedly a round\r\nnumber, and the Jacobin monk, imprisoned since 1674, had then suffered\r\nseventeen years of captivity. A great deal of importance has been\r\nascribed to this despatch, because it was one of the very few belonging\r\nto this period which were known to exist. We have just seen, however,\r\nthat its value is very much diminished by comparison with the other\r\nletters which we have transcribed. The recommendation that Barbézieux\r\ngives in it is purely a matter of form, and similar injunctions were\r\ntransmitted to Villebois and afterwards to Laprade, when charged with\r\nthe care of Matthioly.\r\n\r\n[590] Unpublished despatch from Barbézieux to Saint-Mars, February 26,\r\n1694:--Archives of the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[591] Unpublished despatch from Barbézieux to Saint-Mars, March 20,\r\n1694:--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[592] “The King charges you that no one but yourself shall give\r\nthem to eat, as you have done since they were confided to your\r\ncare;”--Unpublished despatch from Barbézieux to Laprade, who, on the\r\ndeath of Villebois, succeeded to the governorship of the donjon of\r\nPignerol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n Behaviour of Charles IV., Duke of Mantua, towards his ex-Minister--His\r\n true Sentiments with reference to him--Precautions prescribed to\r\n Villebois and Laprade for the Prisoners left by Saint-Mars at\r\n Pignerol.--Change in Louis XIV.’s Position in Italy--Transfer of the\r\n Pignerol Prisoners to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite--Instructions given\r\n to Marshal de Tessé--Increase of Saint-Mars’ Watchfulness--Mystery\r\n surrounding the three Prisoners--Great Importance of one of them\r\n compared with the others--It is he who was the Man with the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthioly was left by Saint-Mars at Pignerol, and the long silence\r\nconcerning him preserved by Louvois and Saint-Mars from the time of\r\nthe latter’s departure for Exiles, receives in that manner its natural\r\nexplanation. When I had assured myself of this, I sought in the\r\nArchives of the Ministry of War for all the despatches addressed either\r\nby Louis XIV. or by the Minister to the Sieur de Villebois, Governor of\r\nthe donjon, or to the Sieur Laprade, who, after the latter’s death, in\r\nApril 1692, replaced him in these duties. Now, I have not only found in\r\nthese despatches the confirmation of Matthioly’s presence at Pignerol,\r\nbut also fresh proofs of the very strict precautions of which the\r\nprisoners left in this citadel continued to be the objects.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked how it was that the Duke of Mantua should\r\nhave remained indifferent to the fate of his old favourite, and not\r\nhave inquired concerning him of Louis XIV., whom he ought to have\r\nknown was alone in a position to furnish him with information. As the\r\ndespatches from the Court of Mantua, published either by Delort or by\r\nothers, do not mention Matthioly’s name after the date of his arrest,\r\npeople have explained this silence by the frivolous indifference of the\r\nyoung duke, and it must be admitted that the character of this prince\r\nrendered such an explanation very probable. Moreover, this silence has\r\nvery much contributed to diminish the importance of Count Matthioly,\r\nand we have been told many times that there could have been nothing\r\nvery considerable in the position of a person who suddenly disappeared\r\nwithout his master even thinking of inquiring what had become of him.\r\nBut this is an error. However light and careless Charles IV. may have\r\nbeen, he did occupy himself with the fate of Matthioly; but far from\r\nendeavouring to deliver him, he regarded his release as a danger.\r\nIndeed, by breaking off the project of the cession of Casale by his\r\ndesertion, Matthioly had not only tricked Louis XIV., but had also\r\nprofoundly incensed the Duke of Mantua, whom he had thus surrendered\r\nto the violent recriminations, and perhaps later, to the vengeance\r\nof the other Italian princes. If Louis XIV. had not had him carried\r\noff, Charles IV. would have charged himself with this care, and would\r\nhave brought about the disappearance of the inconvenient witness\r\nof his intrigues with the Court of Versailles, the agent who had\r\nnegotiated the sale of one of the keys of Italy, the confidant whose\r\nvery existence was a reproach, whose words were an ever-threatened\r\naccusation, and whose testimony was invaluable to the enemies of the\r\nDuke of Mantua.\r\n\r\n“M. de Mantua,” writes the Abbé d’Estrades to Pomponne, June 10, 1679,\r\n“shows uneasiness as to what can have become of Matthioly, whose\r\nconduct he blames.... I inform him concerning Matthioly that, _although\r\nI do not know where he is_, and for the last two months have had no\r\nnews of him, I do not hesitate to assure him that he cannot interfere\r\nat all in our negotiation, and that he will not even have the least\r\nsuspicion of it; that he may set his mind at rest concerning this, and\r\nthat I pledge him my word for it.”[593]\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards the Abbé Morel, the French ambassador, when about\r\nto proceed to Mantua, to Charles IV., with the view of renewing the\r\nproject of surrender, writes from Turin to Louis XIV.:--\r\n\r\n  “Turin, August 9, 1681.\r\n\r\n “I have no doubt that on my return to Mantua, the Duke will question\r\n me as to what will be done with Matioly after the execution of the\r\n treaty. Perhaps it would be as well to give me a line of information\r\n on this point.”[594]\r\n\r\nAnd Louis XIV. himself replies in a manner to calm Charles IV.’s\r\nuneasiness, but still without revealing the place of Matthioly’s\r\nconfinement:--\r\n\r\n  “Fontainebleau, August 21, 1681.\r\n\r\n “I have already informed you that you may assure the Duke of Mantua\r\n that Mathioly will not leave the place where he is without the\r\n consent of that prince; and if there are any other measures to be\r\n taken for his satisfaction, you will inform me of them. On this,\r\n etc.”[595]\r\n\r\nCan one have any doubt of the true sentiments of the Duke of Mantua\r\nafter reading the following despatch?--\r\n\r\n “The Duke of Mantua has learnt with much joy and with sentiments of\r\n lively gratitude, what it has pleased your Majesty to order me to\r\n inform him concerning Matthioli. He had intended to thank me this\r\n evening personally in an audience which he wished to accord me; but I\r\n have found it impossible to attend, owing to a very painful rheumatism\r\n in the neck, which has forced me to keep my bed during the last three\r\n days.”[596]\r\n\r\nThis joy of Charles IV. on learning that he no longer had to dread the\r\nsudden appearance of his accomplice is sadly significant. He could\r\nagain treat with Louis XIV. without fearing lest his too well-informed\r\nex-minister should proceed to impress upon the attention of the other\r\nprinces the conditions to which the Duke of Mantua had agreed, by\r\nconsenting to put himself under the complete control of the most\r\ndangerous of Italy’s enemies. Everything thus combined to perpetuate\r\nthe confinement of the unfortunate Minister, and the interest of\r\nCharles IV. as much as the pride of Louis XIV. required that he who had\r\ndeceived the one and humiliated the other should be removed from the\r\nworld for ever.\r\n\r\nThis was done; and we have seen with what a mystery and with what\r\nan abundance of precautions and minute cares Villebois was charged\r\nto guard him at Pignerol, after Saint-Mars’ departure for Exiles.\r\nVillebois never once left his prisoner. On March 22, 1682,[597]\r\nactuated by a scruple similar to those which had often possessed\r\nSaint-Mars, Villebois asked the Minister, to whom he was to confide\r\nthe care of his prisoners if he should fall ill? Louvois replied, “To\r\nthe one in whom you have most confidence.” “The King approves,” wrote\r\nthe Minister, April 13, 1682, “of your lending the prisoners with\r\nwhose care you are charged the books of devotion which they ask of\r\nyou, taking all due precautions that these may not serve to give them\r\nintelligence of any kind.”[598] “With reference to the priest whom the\r\nprisoners ask for,” we read in a despatch of December 11, 1683, “I\r\nhave to tell you that they should only be allowed to confess once a\r\nyear.”[599] “I have received your letter of the 14th of last month,”\r\nwrites Louvois, May 1, 1684, “from which I perceive the rage of the\r\nSieur Matthioly’s servant (_valet_)[600] towards you, and the manner\r\nin which you have punished him, which must certainly be approved of,\r\nand you ought always to act in the same manner on a like occasion.”\r\nOn November 26, 1689, Louvois learns “that some one had come by night\r\nto a door of the bastion of Pignerol, where the apartments of the\r\nprisoners are situated, with the intention of getting in,” and he\r\norders Villebois “to omit nothing to endeavour to discover those who\r\nhave done so.”[601] On July 28, 1692, when the Sieur de Laprade is\r\nabout to assume the governorship, left vacant by Villebois’ death,\r\nBarbézieux writes to him “that he cannot take too many precautions for\r\nthe security of the prisoners with whose care he is charged.” The same\r\ninstructions are addressed to him on October 31 following.[602] Despite\r\nthese incessant precautions, and the vigilance of which he was the\r\nobject, Matthioly still endeavoured to give tidings of himself, but it\r\nwas only on the linings of his pockets that he managed to write a few\r\nwords. He was discovered, and the Minister writes to Laprade, December\r\n27, 1693, “You have merely to burn what remains of the little pieces\r\nof the pockets on which Matthioly and his man have written, and which\r\nyou have found in the lining of their coats, where they had hidden\r\nthem.”[603]\r\n\r\nThis care in destroying everything that might reveal Matthioly’s\r\npresence at Pignerol had at that time become especially necessary. It\r\nwas no longer, as in 1679, merely Louis XIV.’s pride which exacted that\r\nthe greatest mystery should surround his victim’s existence. Since\r\nthe date of the abduction, the face of things in Italy had changed.\r\nThe King of France could no longer hold forth there as a master; his\r\narmies had ceased to be constantly victorious, and he was expiating his\r\nimpolitic and inopportune interference in the affairs of the peninsula.\r\nThat petty Duke of Savoy, whom we saw twelve years previously\r\nsubmitting himself, with imprecations, to the yoke of his imperious\r\nneighbour, had, in 1693, attained a position which enabled him to\r\nexercise over the progress of events an influence much greater than\r\nthat due to the extent of his territories. This Prince had succeeded\r\nin counterbalancing the weakness of his position by his duplicity in\r\nchanging his alliances, by his dissembling language, and by his happy\r\npromptitude in making use of favourable circumstances. In his policy he\r\nhad always preferred sharp practices to honest acts, and he deceived\r\nin turn and with equal perfidy both Louis XIV. and the enemies of the\r\nKing of France. The latter was anxious for peace, with the view of\r\ndirecting all his efforts and all his attention towards the question\r\nof the Spanish succession, just about to open; and peace depended\r\nalmost entirely upon Victor-Amadeus, who, at first so humble, and for\r\na long time so despised, was now taking his revenge. “We are proud,\r\nand wish to make use of the necessity in which we know very well that\r\nthe King is placed, in order to make a general peace for ourselves,”\r\nsaid the Marquis de Saint-Thomas,[604] Minister of Savoy, to Count de\r\nTessé. So it was no longer the restitution of the conquests made in\r\nPiedmont, and the surrender of Caslae, that Victor-Amadeus demanded,\r\nbut the possession of Pignerol, that valuable acquisition of Richelieu,\r\na French town for the last sixty years, and whose surrender, which\r\nLouis XIV. finished by resigning himself, was a just expiation for\r\nhis ambitious projects of aggrandisement. Possessing already one of\r\nthe keys of Italy, he had wished to acquire the other, so as to keep\r\nunder his control the Duke of Savoy, who would thus have been enclosed\r\nbetween two formidable towns, and he was now compelled to cede him\r\nPignerol, and to withdraw his troops from Casale.\r\n\r\nMatthioly, who had played the principal part in the early negotiations\r\nrelating to the latter place, suffered in the obscurity of his prison\r\nthe consequence of this sudden change in Italian affairs; since he\r\nwas one of the three State-prisoners whom the King of France caused\r\nto be transferred from Pignerol to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, March\r\n19, 1694. Not that his name was then mentioned. After the despatch of\r\nDecember 27, 1693, concerning what he had written on his coat-pockets,\r\nhe was no longer named. Indeed, it was more than ever necessary to hide\r\nfrom every one this victim of an audacious and inexcusable offence\r\nagainst international law. The discontent of Europe against Louis XIV.\r\nbeing extremely strong, and the interests of his policy requiring him\r\nto calm it at any price, it was then especially essential to cover with\r\nimpenetrable mystery an existence which recalled at once the menacing\r\nambition, the audacity, and also the defeat of a great king. So there\r\nhave, perhaps, never been so many minute precautions imposed for a\r\njourney of this nature. At the same time that Laprade was receiving\r\nthe most circumstantial and precise instructions with reference to the\r\ntransfer, the Marquis d’Herleville, Governor of Pignerol, and the Count\r\nde Tessé, commanding the French troops in that place, had orders “to\r\nfurnish escorts and advance all the money required for the expenses\r\nof the journey.” Tessé was instructed not to inquire the names of the\r\nprisoners, and to absolutely overcome every temptation to a dangerous\r\ncuriosity.[605] The following unpublished despatch is a proof of this:--\r\n\r\n  “Turin, March 27, 1694.\r\n\r\n “I do not reply to you concerning that which you have done me the\r\n honour to write me _with your own hand_, with reference to the\r\n prisoners of the donjon, except that I shall conduct myself according\r\n to your orders and instructions with the greatest secrecy, entire\r\n circumspection, and every possible measure for the security of these\r\n prisoners, without having the slightest temptation to the least petty\r\n curiosity.”[606]\r\n\r\nBut, no matter how great the precautions taken may have been, no matter\r\nhow reserved from that date Barbézieux and Saint-Mars may have shown\r\nthemselves in their despatches, these still disclose something; and,\r\nfine as may be the thread which will permit us to follow Matthioly to\r\nhis death, it is nevertheless visible.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners delivered over by Laprade to Saint-Mars were old\r\ncaptives, whom the latter had already had in charge at Pignerol. This\r\nis clear: 1st, from a despatch, dated January 11, 1694, in which the\r\nMinister asks Saint-Mars the name of one of Laprade’s prisoners who\r\nhad just died;[607] 2nd, from the conclusion of the first despatch,\r\nannouncing to Saint-Mars the approaching arrival of the prisoners at\r\nPignerol: “I do not inform you of the number, persuaded that you know\r\nit;”[608] 3rd, from that significant phrase which we have already\r\nquoted from the second despatch relating to the transfer of these\r\nprisoners: “You know that they are of more consequence, or at least\r\none of them, than those who are now at the Islands, and you ought to\r\nplace them by preference in the surest prisons.”[609] Now it is quite\r\ncertain, that at the time of his departure from Pignerol to Exiles,\r\nSaint-Mars had no other considerable prisoner except Matthioly, Fouquet\r\nbeing dead and Lauzun set at liberty. We may remark, too, that it is\r\nin Villebois’ care that he leaves him, Villebois who, with Catinat,\r\nhad been charged with the mission of arresting Matthioly on the road\r\nto Turin.[610] When Villebois dies, it is another of Saint-Mars’\r\nconfidential lieutenants--the Sieur de Laprade, who is sent from\r\nthe Islands to command in the donjon of Pignerol.[611] Consequently\r\nSaint-Mars--and this is an essential point to establish,--did not cease\r\nto be acquainted with Matthioly’s fate, and it is his own lieutenants\r\nwho have replaced him for a time in guarding this prisoner.\r\n\r\nWe have shown, in the preceding chapter,[612] the evident obscurity\r\nof the insignificant prisoner brought by Saint-Mars from Exiles to\r\nthe Isles Sainte-Marguerite. His furniture and effects are only\r\nworth thirteen crowns; his gaoler leaves him without scruple; he is\r\ndesignated as “a crow.” A new prisoner, “of more consequence than the\r\nothers,” arrives at the Islands. From that moment Saint-Mars does not\r\nquit them; but immediately imagines fresh measures for the safety of\r\nhis prisoners, which the Minister approves, July 20, 1694.[613]\r\n\r\nIt is about this period that we find, in the official despatches,\r\nthe name of the Sieur Favre, whom the most unquestionable tradition\r\nrepresents as having been chaplain of the prison at the time that\r\nthe Man with the Iron Mask was confined there.[614] Barbézieux, who\r\npreviously had not been troubled with this anxiety, all at once\r\nthinks of what would happen if Saint-Mars should fall ill, and, with\r\nanxious solicitude, inquires[615] immediately what would be done if\r\nthis should occur.[616] On January 15, 1696, we find a new despatch\r\nfrom Barbézieux, expressing, in the King’s name and his own, the\r\nsatisfaction experienced on learning the precautions adopted.[617]\r\nOn October 29, 1696, the Minister causes the locks of the donjon of\r\nPignerol to be sent to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, in order to render\r\nthe confinement of the prisoners more secure.[618]\r\n\r\nBut there follows a despatch more significant still. Its existence was\r\nfirst revealed, then contested, and historical criticism finished by no\r\nlonger believing in it, and by rejecting it altogether. Nevertheless it\r\nexists, and I have reproduced it in Chapter V.[619] It concludes thus:\r\n“Without explaining yourself to any one whatever about what your old\r\nprisoner has done.”\r\n\r\nThese words: “Your old prisoner,” have grammatically but one\r\nmeaning--that is to say, the prisoner whom you formerly had in your\r\ncare, and who has been again confided to you. Besides, I may remark,\r\nthat if there should be any doubt about the meaning, this phrase cannot\r\npossibly apply to the prisoner brought by Saint-Mars from Exiles,\r\nsince he arrived at the island in April, 1687. For, how can we imagine\r\nthat the inhabitants of Sainte-Marguerite would have waited ten years,\r\nbefore concerning themselves with the causes of his confinement? This\r\ncuriosity of the inhabitants of the island, this astonishment, the\r\nprime origin of the legend which became current in the district, is\r\nvery naturally explained by the arrival of the prisoners from Pignerol,\r\nsurrounded by a strong escort, guarded by Saint-Mars’ confidential men,\r\nplaced, one at least, in the most secure prison, and the importance\r\nof whom was attested by the preparations, repairs, and purchases\r\nexecuted at the time by Saint-Mars. There is nothing striking in the\r\ntreatment of the prisoner brought from Exiles, nothing which could\r\nexcite surprise, and, anyhow, there is the positive certainty that this\r\nsurprise would have been produced in any case during the early years of\r\nhis residence at the Isles Sainte-Marguerite.\r\n\r\nPignerol was restored to the Duke of Savoy a short time after the\r\narrival of the new prisoners at the islands. I have carefully\r\nlooked through all the despatches exchanged between Lamothe-Guérin,\r\nSaint-Mars’ successor at the Islands, and the Court of Versailles,\r\nduring the ten years (1698 to 1708) which followed the latter’s\r\ndeparture for the Bastille.[620] Not one of them contains the name of\r\nMatthioly, or makes mention of an important prisoner, left behind by\r\nSaint-Mars. Matthioly was still at Pignerol on December 27, 1693, a few\r\nmonths previous to the transfer of the three prisoners to the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite. They were all old captives formerly in the care of\r\nSaint-Mars. The latter, we have seen, was ignorant of the causes of\r\ntheir detention, _save of Matthioly’s alone_. The logical conclusion\r\nof our preceding remarks is, therefore, that these words: “Without\r\nexplaining yourself to any one whatever about _what your old prisoner\r\nhas done_,” are applicable to what the Government of Versailles termed\r\nthe treason of Matthioly. ] If this be admitted--and we trust that our\r\nreaders will have no doubt with reference to it--if it be admitted that\r\nthe despatch of November 17, 1697, is applicable to Matthioly, the only\r\nprisoner, we must again repeat, whose crime Saint-Mars was acquainted\r\nwith, the identity of the Man with the Iron Mask is established.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1698, Barbézieux offers Saint-Mars the nomination to the\r\nGovernorship of the Bastille.[621] He accepts this offer, and, on June\r\n17, 1698, the Minister replies:--\r\n\r\n  “Versailles, June 17, 1698.\r\n\r\n “I have remained a long time without answering the letter which you\r\n have taken the trouble to write me the 8th of last month, because the\r\n King has not explained his intentions to me earlier. I shall now tell\r\n you that his Majesty has seen with pleasure that you are determined\r\n to come to the Bastille in order to be its governor. You can arrange\r\n everything so as to be ready to leave when I shall write to you, and\r\n bring your old prisoner with you in all safety.\r\n\r\n “I have agreed with Mons. Saumery that he shall give you two thousand\r\n crowns for your expenses in moving your furniture.”\r\n\r\nThe 19th July following, Barbézieux wrote again:--\r\n\r\n  “Marly, July 19, 1698.\r\n\r\n “I have received the letter that you have taken the trouble to write\r\n me the 9th of this month. The King approves of your leaving the Isles\r\n Sainte-Marguerite to come to the Bastille with your old prisoner,\r\n taking your precautions to prevent his being seen or known by any one.\r\n You can write in advance to his Majesty’s Lieutenant of this château\r\n to have a chamber ready to place this prisoner in on your arrival.”\r\n\r\nWe thus find, in the two despatches sent to Saint-Mars on the eve\r\nof his departure for the Bastille, at that very important moment\r\nwhen he is about to commence his journey across France, these same\r\ncharacteristic words:--“Your old prisoner.” This is not all. What I\r\nhave termed the perfect agreement, the exact correspondence between the\r\nprisoner who entered the Bastille, September 18, 1698, and Matthioly,\r\nis rendered more complete and more exact still by the only document\r\nconcerning the Man with the Iron Mask, besides despatches, which has\r\nas yet been admitted without controversy--viz., Dujonca’s Journal. If\r\nwe refer to Chapter XIII.[622] of the present work we shall perceive\r\nthat he too terms the prisoner who accompanied Saint-Mars “_his old\r\nprisoner_ whom he had at Pignerol.” At the Bastille he was called\r\nmerely the “prisoner from Provence,”[623] because it was in Provence\r\nthat he was confided to Saint-Mars, and Dujonca is none the less exact\r\nin terming him the old prisoner from Pignerol, since Matthioly had\r\nbeen two years at Pignerol under the care of Saint-Mars. Of all the\r\ncaptives of whom Saint-Mars was the gaoler, Matthioly is thus the\r\nonly one who reconciles the two apparently contradictory features of\r\nthe Man with the Iron Mask, whom an undoubted tradition represents as\r\nhaving been brought to Saint-Mars at the Islands, and whom indisputable\r\ndocuments show to have also been imprisoned at Pignerol. The general\r\nerror has been to represent the Iron Mask as going from Pignerol to\r\nExiles, the name of which was never mentioned by Dujonca, and not to\r\npay sufficient attention to this fact, viz., that tradition as well as\r\nrare contemporary documents assign only three prisons, and not four, to\r\nthe mysterious captive: Pignerol, the Isles Sainte-Marguerite, and the\r\nBastille.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[593] Unpublished despatch:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, section Savoy, 68.\r\n\r\n[594] Unpublished despatch from the Abbé Morel to Louis XIV.:--Archives\r\nof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Mantua, 15.\r\n\r\n[595] Unpublished despatch from Louis XIV. to the Abbé Morel:--Archives\r\nof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, section Mantua, 15.\r\n\r\n[596] Unpublished despatch from the Abbé Morel to Louis XIV.:--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[597] Unpublished despatch from Louvois to Villebois, March 30,\r\n1682:--Archives of the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[598] _Ibid._, April 13, 1682.\r\n\r\n[599] _Ibid._, December 11, 1685.\r\n\r\n[600] Here followed “de chambre,” but these two words have been erased.\r\n\r\n[601] Unpublished despatches from Louvois to Villebois of May 1, 1684,\r\nand November 26, 1689.\r\n\r\n[602] Unpublished despatch from Barbézieux to Laprade, July 28 1692.\r\n\r\n[603] _Ibid._, December 27, 1693.\r\n\r\n[604] Letter from Tessé to Barbézieux, December 1693:--Archives of the\r\nMinistry of War, 1271.

Topin when writing this work, but\r\nsubsequently published by him, and in which Saint-Mars describes the\r\nminute precautions he adopts in order to ensure the safe custody of\r\nhis prisoners and prevent them from communicating with any one, is\r\nsufficiently curious to be given at full length:--\r\n\r\n  “Monseigneur,--\r\n\r\n “You command me to inform you how people would act when I am absent or\r\n ill, with reference to the precautions which are taken and the visits\r\n which are paid every day to the prisoners who are committed to my care.\r\n\r\n “My two lieutenants give them to eat at fixed hours, as they have\r\n seen me do, and as I still do very often when I am well; and this is\r\n how, Monseigneur. The senior of my lieutenants takes the keys of the\r\n prison of my _old prisoner_, with whom they commence, opens the three\r\n doors and enters the chamber of the prisoner, who politely hands him\r\n the dishes and plates which he has placed on the top of one another in\r\n order to give them to the lieutenant, who only goes out through two of\r\n the doors to hand them to one of my sergeants, who receives them and\r\n carries them to a table two paces off, where is my second lieutenant,\r\n who examines everything that enters or leaves the prison, so that\r\n he may see that there is nothing written on the plate; and after\r\n everything necessary has been given him [the prisoner], a search is\r\n made in and under his bed and among the window-bars of his chamber, as\r\n well as in the whole of the chamber, and very often on himself; after\r\n having very civilly asked him if he has need of anything, they shut\r\n the doors and go to do the same for the other prisoners.\r\n\r\n “Twice a week their table-linen is changed, as well as their shirts\r\n and the linen of which they make use, which is given to them and taken\r\n away again after having been counted and after everything has been\r\n well searched.\r\n\r\n “One can be very much cheated about the linen when it leaves and\r\n enters for the service of prisoners who are people of consideration,\r\n as I have had some who have wished to bribe the laundresses, who have\r\n acknowledged to me, which they had little difficulty in doing, what\r\n had been said to them, on account of which I used to have all their\r\n linen steeped in water on leaving their chambers, and when it was\r\n clean and half dry, the laundresses came to iron and smooth it in my\r\n apartments in the presence of one of my lieutenants, who locked up\r\n the baskets in a chest until they were handed over to the servants of\r\n messieurs the prisoners. There is much to be distrusted in candles; I\r\n have found some which on being broken or used contained paper instead\r\n of wicks. I used to send to buy some at Turin at shops not tampered\r\n with. It is also very dangerous for ribbon to leave a prisoner’s\r\n apartment, as he writes on it as on linen without any one being aware\r\n of it.\r\n\r\n “The late Monsieur Fouquet made fine and good paper on which I\r\n allowed him to write, and afterwards I went and took it from a little\r\n pocket which he had made in the seat of his breeches, which I sent to\r\n Monseigneur your late father.”\r\n\r\n [The commencement of the second leaf has been torn; the following only\r\n remains:--]\r\n\r\n “As a last precaution, the prisoners are searched from time to time,\r\n both day and night, at hours which are not fixed, when it is often\r\n found that they have written on dirty linen that which they alone are\r\n able to read, as you will have seen from that which I have had the\r\n honour to forward you. If it is necessary, Monseigneur, that I should\r\n do anything else in order to more completely fulfil my duty, I shall\r\n glory all my life in obeying you with the same respect and submission\r\n as I am,\r\n\r\n  “Monseigneur,\r\n  “Your very humble, very obedient, and very obliged servant,\r\n  “DE SAINT-MARS.\r\n\r\n “At the Islands, this January 6, 1696.”\r\n\r\nThe above despatch, as well as the one given on p. 324, note\r\n17, _ante_, is to be found in draft in the collection of M.\r\nMauge-du-Bois-des-Entes.

He\r\nretired to his château of L’Etang at the boundary of the park of\r\nSaint-Cloud, where he feasted and rioted with his friends, and was\r\nseized with a fever consequent upon his excesses, of which he died\r\na few days afterwards at the age of thirty-three. See _Mémoires de\r\nSaint-Simon_.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[621] Unpublished despatch from Barbézieux to Saint-Mars. I reproduce\r\nit word for word:--\r\n\r\n  “At Versailles, the first of March, 1698.\r\n\r\n “I commence by offering you my condolence on the death of your\r\n brother-in-law, for which you will not doubt I am very sorry, both on\r\n account of his services and of my friendship for him.\r\n\r\n “I also write to you concerning the proposal to exchange your\r\n governorship of the Isles Sainte-Marguerite against that of the\r\n Bastille. The reply which you have made to him has been handed to me\r\n since his death. The revenue of this governorship consists of 15,168\r\n livres on the estates of the King, besides two thousand additional\r\n which M. Bezemaux derived from the shops around the Bastille and the\r\n ferry-boats depending on the governor.\r\n\r\n “It is true that out of this M. Bezemaux was obliged to pay a number\r\n of sergeants and soldiers for the guard of the prisoners in his care,\r\n but you know, from what you derive from your company, to what these\r\n expenses amount. Having enumerated the value of this governorship, I\r\n shall now say to you that it is for you to know your own interests,\r\n that the King does not force you to accept it, if it is not agreeable\r\n to you, and at the same time I do not doubt that you will take account\r\n of the profit that is generally made upon what the King gives for the\r\n keep of the prisoners, which profit may become considerable. There is\r\n also the pleasure of being in Paris with one’s family and friends,\r\n instead of being confined to an extremity of the kingdom. If I may\r\n give my opinion, it seems to me very advantageous, and I believe, for\r\n the reasons given above, that you would not lose by the exchange.\r\n I beg you nevertheless to write me your opinion frankly concerning\r\n that:”--Archives of the Ministry of War.\r\n\r\n[622] P. 164, _ante_.\r\n\r\n[623] The Count de Pontchartrain to Saint-Mars, November 3, 1698:\r\n“The King approves of your prisoner from Provence confessing and\r\ncommunicating whenever you think proper.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n The Use of a Mask formerly very general--Frequently adopted for\r\n Prisoners in Italy--Its Employment not difficult in the Case of\r\n Matthioly--Origin of the Legend of the Man with the Iron Mask--As\r\n to the Transmission of the Secret from King to King--Louis\r\n XV. and Louis XVIII.--How it is that the Despatches which we\r\n have quoted have remained unpublished--Concerning the Silence\r\n of Saint-Simon--Dujonca--Taulès’ Objection--Louvois’ harsh\r\n Language--Matthioly’s Age--Concerning the Name of Marchialy--Order for\r\n Matthioly’s Arrest--Arrival of the Duke of Mantua in Paris--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what about the mask? some one will say,--the mask, which is the\r\ncharacteristic feature of the mysterious prisoner, a feature more\r\nstriking than all the others, because that whilst the latter are\r\nonly known to those people who read, the former is recalled by the\r\nvery name of the famous captive, which one cannot pronounce without\r\npicturing him to oneself with a mask covering his face? Need we say\r\nthat the custom of wearing a mask was formerly very general among\r\nthe great? Need we quote the example of Marie de Medicis, whom the\r\nexact Héroard[624] represents as going to see the young Louis XIII.,\r\n“who kisses her beneath her mask?” Or the Duchess de Montpensier’s\r\nladies of honour whom she authorised to cover their faces with masks\r\nof  black velvet?[625] Or, again, the Maréchale de Clérambault, whom\r\nSaint-Simon[626] describes “as always wearing a mask of black velvet on\r\nthe high road or in the galleries?” Need we recall Madame de Maintenon\r\nconcealing her face under a mask,[627] when she comes seven different\r\ntimes to Versailles to seek the children just born of Madame de\r\nMontespan and Louis XIV., and to take them mysteriously to Paris in a\r\n_fiacre_. Or the wives of certain rich financiers who, in 1683, dared\r\nto wear a mask even in the churches,[628] and thus provoked a severe\r\n_ordonnance_ from La Reynie, the Lieutenant of Police?\r\n\r\nBut if at this period we find very frequent examples of the use of a\r\nmask in the ordinary course of life, there is absolutely no authentic\r\nexample of the wearing of a mask being enforced upon a prisoner,\r\nand such a measure is altogether peculiar to the famous captive.\r\nIt has been concluded from this that the prisoner so exceptionally\r\ntreated must have been of exceptional importance, and that there\r\nwas some especial interest in concealing his countenance. But, if\r\nthis were the case, why was he conducted to the Bastille, where a\r\nmoment of forgetfulness might cause him to be recognized by one of\r\nhis fellow-captives, and almost infallibly by one of the numerous\r\nofficers of the fortress? Would it not have been as prudent as it was\r\neasy to have avoided this danger by leaving him at the Isles Sainte\r\nMarguerite? In order to explain the removal, it has been said that\r\nLouis XIV. desired to have the prisoner nearer himself. This is\r\naltogether wrong. We have just given[629] the despatches which preceded\r\nSaint-Mars’ departure for the Bastille. Do they contain an imperious\r\norder, unanswerable, and founded on reasons of State? Far from it. The\r\nMinister informs Saint-Mars that the governorship of the Bastille has\r\njust become vacant, and inquires if he is willing to accept it. Far\r\nfrom speaking to him of “his old prisoner” in this first despatch,[630]\r\nhe touches only upon his private affairs, and the evident gain he would\r\nexperience by accepting this very advantageous proposition; and it is\r\nonly when Saint-Mars decides upon doing so that the Minister charges\r\nhim to bring “his old prisoner” with him. If this “old prisoner” had\r\npossessed in his features any resemblance “revealing his origin,” he\r\nwould not have been taken to Paris, or anyhow some mention would have\r\nbeen made of him in the first despatch in which the new duties are\r\nproposed to Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\nIn the case of an Italian like Matthioly, the use of the mask has a\r\nvery natural explanation. Indeed, it is only in Italy that we meet with\r\nthe custom of covering the face of a prisoner with a mask. Individuals\r\narrested in Venice by order of the State inquisitors were taken masked\r\nto their dungeons. Moreover, we have seen Matthioly concealing himself\r\nwith a mask in his secret interviews with the Abbé d’Estrades, Louis\r\nXIV.’s ambassador. This mask[631] the Minister of the Duke of Mantua\r\nand the companion of his pleasures used always to carry about with him.\r\nIt would certainly have formed part of the clothes and effects seized\r\nnear Turin in 1678, and which were sufficiently valuable for Louvois\r\nto authorise Saint-Mars to take them with him.[632] In 1698, as at the\r\ntime of his arrest, Matthioly was always under the ban of that order of\r\nabsolute secrecy contained in a despatch which we shall shortly give;\r\nand Saint-Mars, as we know, was as exact and as scrupulous in carrying\r\nout his instructions, whether they were twenty years old or quite\r\nrecent. Moreover, in 1678 Matthioly had come to Paris, charged with an\r\nofficial mission. He remained there a month. Supposing, as is probable,\r\nthat he ran no risk, after so long an absence, of being recognized by\r\nthe French whom he had visited, there was no reason why the Residents\r\nof the Duke of Mantua and the other Italian Princes should not do so.\r\nLastly, an unpublished letter of Saint-Mars[633] and several despatches\r\nof the Minister of Exterior Relations prove that there was then in the\r\nBastille a Count Boselli, an Italian, in whose detention the Marshal\r\nde Tallard appears to have been interested, and who, on account of\r\nhis different missions, had travelled throughout the whole of Italy,\r\nand had been brought into connection with many of the illustrious\r\nfamilies of Mantua and Bologna. He had doubtless known Matthioly’s,\r\nand perhaps Matthioly himself. For all these reasons, therefore, it\r\nwas necessary to preserve the absolute secrecy to which the latter had\r\nbeen condemned. Saint-Mars had the means at his disposal--a means\r\nexceptional and extraordinary, but still very familiar to Matthioly.\r\nHis face was therefore covered with a mask, and if this peculiarity\r\nwas so striking to the people at the Bastille, it was principally on\r\naccount of the prisoner’s arriving there with the new governor, and\r\nbecause their attention was already excited by the expected arrival of\r\nSaint-Mars, preceded probably by a reputation for rigorous severity,\r\nand awaited, anyhow, with that impatience to meet a new chief which all\r\nsubordinates display. It is this which has contributed to render so\r\nstrong in Dujonca the impression of surprise which we meet with in his\r\ningenuous journal. He has communicated this impression, thus received,\r\nto other officers of the Bastille. The mysterious memory of it is\r\nat first perpetuated within the walls of this formidable fortress.\r\nIt would still have been talked about during the first half of the\r\neighteenth century, when many men of letters were imprisoned there.\r\nThese last have certainly heard the tale which, after its passage from\r\none mouth to another, still contained a little of history and already\r\nmuch of legend. They have preserved profoundly engraven on their minds\r\nthis story, so much more striking because it was told them on the very\r\nscene of the events, and, once liberated, they have spread it abroad\r\namongst the public, and soon throughout the whole world. Imagination,\r\nvividly excited, has had free play. Various explanations have been\r\nproposed, supported, and contested. Great writers have taken part in\r\nthis controversy, and have lent it the lustre of their talents. With\r\nthe view of stimulating public curiosity, people have amused themselves\r\nwith adding to it much that was extraordinary and marvellous, and thus\r\nthe story of the Man with the Iron Mask has by degrees left the grave\r\ndomain of history to enter altogether into the seductive regions of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nNext, various episodes have been successively imagined and added as\r\nso many embellishments to the life of the romantic prisoner: such\r\nas--Louvois’ visit to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite; the silver dish\r\nthrown out of the window and recovered by a fisherman, luckily for\r\nhimself, uneducated; and especially the transmission of the gloomy\r\nsecret “from King to King, and to no other.”[634] Louvois, as we\r\nhave already said,[635] never went to the Isles Sainte-Marguerite,\r\nand it was a Protestant clergyman who threw out of the window a tin\r\ndish, covered with a few lines of writing. As to the transmission\r\nof the secret, which thus became, to a certain extent, an attribute\r\nof royalty, nothing proves that this ever took place when it was\r\npossible, and it is indisputable that it has not always been so. No\r\ndoubt Louis XIV., on his death-bed, had a private conversation with the\r\nDuke d’Orléans.[636] That after having conversed with him concerning\r\ngrave affairs of State, he should have spoken to him of the only two\r\nabductions of foreigners committed during his reign--those of Avedick\r\nand Matthioly; that at this supreme hour this King, who did not at all\r\nregret the persecutions inflicted upon his own subjects, because, even\r\nat his last moment, he was artfully made to consider them necessary\r\nfor religion; that this King, I say, should have understood, at such a\r\ntime, that to carry off an Armenian Patriarch, and to cause a foreign\r\nMinister to disappear, were two extreme acts, and manifest violations\r\nof international law; and that, acting under this impression, he\r\nshould have recounted them to his nephew, may be admitted. Afterwards,\r\nthe question of the Man with the Iron Mask having been suddenly\r\nmooted, it is probable the Duke d’Orléans or Cardinal Fleury may have\r\ninformed Louis XV. about it. All the replies of the latter, when\r\nquestioned, tend to confirm the opinion we have just established, by\r\nthe examination of the despatches and are perfectly applicable to\r\nMatthioly.[637] That Louis XV. may have transmitted the secret to his\r\ngrandson is also possible, although there is nothing to establish the\r\nfact of his having done so. But how was Louis XVIII. in a position\r\nto have been acquainted with it, as he is said to have been? When,\r\nas Count de Provence, he quitted Paris, Louis XVI. did not foresee\r\nthe catastrophe which was so near. Will it be said that in the depths\r\nof his prison, the unhappy King may have remembered the necessary\r\ntransmission, and have therefore occupied himself with informing his\r\nbrother? But then, also, Louis XVII. was still living. If, therefore,\r\nLouis XVIII. has, by means of skilfully obscured answers, given out\r\nthat he, too, was in the secret, it was only that he might not seem\r\nto be deprived of a privilege which some persons still regarded as a\r\nprerogative of the Crown.\r\n\r\nSuch are the embellishments with which time has adorned the story of\r\nthe masked prisoner, and which, by transfiguring him, have rendered\r\nhim unrecognizable. But, as has often been said to us, how is it\r\nthat, reduced to his proper proportions, he has not been previously\r\nrecognized in a definitive manner? How is it, too, since he has been\r\nthe object of such long researches, that people have passed over so\r\nmany despatches concerning him, without even reading them? To this we\r\nshall content ourselves with replying, that these despatches are in\r\nexistence, that their authenticity cannot be contested, and that any\r\none may take cognizance of them in the Archives of the Ministry of War\r\nor of Foreign Affairs. If they have remained unpublished to the present\r\ntime, it is doubtless because they have escaped notice, containing, as\r\nthey do, mere indications, and no proof revealing in a direct manner\r\nthe identity of the Man with the Iron Mask. It is by bringing them\r\ntogether, and comparing them, that light is thrown upon them. Isolated\r\nthey remain obscure; having no clearness of their own, they have not\r\nattracted attention, and have remained buried in the heaps of documents\r\namong which they are still to be found.\r\n\r\nWhat objection yet remains to combat the result of this minute\r\ninquiry carefully conducted among innumerable materials? Is it the\r\nsilence of Saint-Simon[639] in reference to this affair? But this\r\nvery silence tends to prove that the masked prisoner was the victim\r\nof an intrigue concocted abroad. This immortal writer has, indeed,\r\nthrown light into the most secret and obscure recesses of Louis XIV.’s\r\nCourt. None of its hidden wretchedness, none of its most secret\r\nintrigues, nothing concerning the interior of the Kingdom, has escaped\r\nthis self-constituted observer. But, on the other hand, he was only\r\nacquainted with the foreign affairs of the end of the reign, when his\r\nfriend, the Marquis de Torcy, had assumed the direction of them. He was\r\nas completely ignorant about all the others as he was well-informed\r\nconcerning what passed within the Kingdom. His silence, therefore,\r\nwhich would be very strange, if the Man with the Iron Mask had belonged\r\nto a French family, is easily explained by the fact that this prisoner\r\nwas arrested outside France, and in 1678.\r\n\r\nWill it still be maintained that the slight importance of a minister\r\nof the Duke of Mantua is incompatible with the care that Dujonca[640]\r\ntook to prepare the chamber in the Bastille for the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, when in the curious manuscript notes[641] which we have found\r\nin the Archives of the Arsenal, Dujonca himself states, “That on the\r\narrival of a prisoner, it is necessary to take care to have given and\r\nbrought to him all that is essential for the furnishing of his chamber,\r\npaying very dearly for it to the Governor’s upholsterer, or else to the\r\n_maîtresse d’autel_?”\r\n\r\nIs it still possible to draw an objection from the silence concerning\r\nMatthioly preserved in the despatches addressed by the Minister to\r\nSaint-Mars during the years 1680 to 1698,[642] now that we know that\r\nMatthioly, contrary to the opinion admitted up to the present time, had\r\nremained at Pignerol, and was only restored to Saint-Mars a few years\r\nbefore the latter’s departure for the Bastille?\r\n\r\nPeople have often spoken of the severe treatment of which Matthioly was\r\nthe object, and the harsh expressions used with reference to him by the\r\nMinister. But if there was indeed, for a long time, a certain harshness\r\nin Louvois’ language, the despatches of the Abbé d’Estrades explain\r\nit. This harshness was caused by the cruel disappointment experienced\r\nby the Minister, when, notwithstanding Matthioly’s promises, the\r\noriginal of the ratification of the treaty of Casale could not be found\r\namong his papers. Previously to this, Catinat had written to Louvois:\r\n“Monsieur de Saint-Mars treats the S. de Lestang[643] very kindly so\r\nfar as regards cleanliness and food, but very strictly in preventing\r\nhim holding intercourse with any one.”[644]\r\n\r\nLater, especially after the execution of the treaty, the old grievances\r\ndisappeared, and if an incessant surveillance was maintained, useless\r\nseverity was dispensed with. Moreover, these harsh, coarse, and painful\r\nexpressions were only too familiar to Louvois, and in some of his\r\ndespatches he has scarcely shown himself milder with reference to\r\nFouquet and De Lauzun.\r\n\r\nLastly, Voltaire declares that he had heard “from the Sieur Marsolan,\r\nthe son-in-law of the apothecary of the Bastille, that the latter,\r\na short time previous to the death of the masked prisoner, learnt\r\nfrom him that _he believed himself to be about sixty years old_.” Now\r\nMatthioly, born in 1640, was, in reality, sixty-three years of age when\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nHe died, and the registers of the Church of Saint-Paul[645]  bear\r\nthe name of _Marchialy_. The dissertations on this name have been\r\nas numerous as ingenious. Some persons--Father Griffet,[646] for\r\ninstance--have discovered in it the letters forming the words _hic\r\namiral_ (Vermandois and Beaufort were Admirals of France), as if\r\nthe employment of an anagram was probable under such circumstances!\r\nOthers[647] have beheld in it the word _mar_, which in the Armenian\r\ntongue signifies _Saint_, and in the East would be applied to the\r\npatriarchs, and the word _Kialy_, the Armenian diminutive of _Michael_,\r\nwhich was Avedick’s Christian name. Is it not more simple and natural\r\nto regard this word as standing for Matthioly’s name itself, which\r\nin several despatches Louvois writes Marthioly?[648] No one can\r\nbe ignorant of the negligence with which proper names were then\r\nspelt?[649] Here there is only one letter changed; how many examples do\r\nwe not come across of much more important modifications? No one could\r\nhave any suspicion of the date of Count Matthioly’s death. People were\r\nignorant that Dujonca kept a journal, and it was only afterwards, that\r\nguided by its statements they thought of searching among the registers\r\nof the Church of Saint-Paul for the date of November 20, 1703, which\r\nhe had assigned for the burial of the masked prisoner. But it must at\r\nleast be admitted that at the time of this burial there was nothing\r\nwhich could serve to attract attention towards the registration of\r\nNovember 20. Moreover, all danger of his imparting any confidence, all\r\nfear of a revelation of an odious violation of international law, had\r\ndisappeared with the possessor of Louis XIV.’s secret, with the victim\r\nof this violation. To inscribe his name upon the register of an obscure\r\nchurch, where no one had the means of seeking for it, was therefore\r\nnatural, and presented no danger. Everything that was essential or\r\nindispensable had been done. The abduction was accomplished with the\r\ngreatest mystery; Matthioly’s presence at Pignerol, and afterwards at\r\nthe Islands, was known only to his gaoler; his name merely mentioned\r\nin despatches which might be presumed to be placed for ever beyond\r\ninvestigations, then this name disappearing in its turn, and every\r\ntrace of the prisoner, as was believed, effaced by these means; his\r\nchanges of prison taking place with extraordinary precautions; all\r\nthis would have sufficed to have rendered any researches useless, and\r\nto have prevented the complete identification of Matthioly, if the\r\narchives at Versailles had remained impenetrable. Louis XIV.’s order\r\nwas scrupulously executed, as will be seen from the despatch,[650]\r\nwhich it is now time to give, and in which the King of France caused\r\nto be accorded to the Abbé d’Estrades, the authorisation which he had\r\nsolicited.\r\n\r\n  “Versailles, April 28, 1679.\r\n\r\n “The King has seen in your letter the confidence that Madame la\r\n Duchesse de Savoye had imparted to you concerning Count Matthioly’s\r\n perfidy. It is rather strange that, feeling himself guilty to such a\r\n degree towards his Majesty, he dares to trust himself in your hands.\r\n So the King thinks that it is good that he should not do so with\r\n impunity. _Since you believe you can get him carried off without\r\n the thing causing any scandal_, his Majesty desires that you should\r\n execute the idea that you have, and that you should have him taken\r\n secretly to Pignerol. An order is sent there to receive him, _and to\r\n have him kept there without any person knowing about it_. It will\r\n depend upon your skill to arrange a meeting, in order to speak with\r\n him in an unfrequented spot, and if possible, in the country. But in\r\n any case, if it is true that he has had the ratification of the Duke\r\n of Mantua, and should have it in his possession, it would be good to\r\n take him and make sure of him. It is not necessary that you should\r\n inform Madame la Duchesse de Savoye of this order which his Majesty\r\n gives you, and NO ONE MUST KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF THIS MAN.”\r\n\r\nOur task is ended. Can it be a matter for regret that the chief and\r\nnecessary consequence of our researches has been to annihilate a\r\ncreature of fantasy with a particularly handsome countenance, of\r\nlofty birth, and with an affecting destiny? Is not the charm of\r\ntruth superior to all others, and if it has been vouchsafed to us to\r\nintroduce it into these pages, if, into a question where, as we have\r\nseen, everything was uncertainty, we have succeeded in throwing a\r\nlittle fresh light, why should we fear to have finished by dissipating\r\nthat creation of popular imagination, that dubious and fanciful\r\nbeing, who, it seems to us, ought not to excite so much interest\r\nas he who has really lived, and whose existence we can follow step\r\nby step? Whilst, in fact, an inevitable uncertainty must always be\r\nmingled with the attraction exercised by the former, whilst the pity\r\nand emotion experienced must ever be restrained by the impossibility\r\nof proving even his birth; in the second case we are concerned with\r\na misfortune quite as great, and this time real, with an individual\r\nmuch less eminent, but who has indeed existed, and who, condemned\r\nlike the former to an unjust punishment, has really lived, suffered,\r\nand been persecuted. Wherefore, too, should one measure one’s pity\r\nby the importance of those who deserve it? Are not all the victims\r\nof arbitrary power equally worthy of interest, and does not the\r\npersistence of misfortune raise the persecuted to the level of those\r\nwho are great by birth and by splendour of position? Fouquet in the\r\ndepths of his prison, separated from every one that he loves, but\r\nfinding in his Christian sentiments sufficient strength to overcome his\r\nsorrow, seems to us a great deal more touching in his resignation than\r\ninteresting from the recollection of the splendid part he had played\r\nin the court of Louis XIV. Matthioly also was torn from his family\r\nand held a high position, but in a much less important court; he too\r\nsuffered the loneliness of captivity, and for him this loneliness was\r\nlasting. His wife took refuge in a convent, and thus withdrew from a\r\nworld from which Louis XIV. had violently carried off her husband. His\r\nfamily was dispersed, powerless, and silent, feeling itself threatened\r\nas it were by the blow which had struck its chief. He dragged out\r\nhis existence in various prisons, proceeding from Pignerol to the\r\nIsles Sainte-Marguerite, from these islands to the Bastille, sometimes\r\nresigned, at others disordered by grief, and in his fits of madness\r\ncalling himself a near relation of Louis XIV., and for this reason\r\ndemanding his liberty. On November 19, 1703, his misfortunes terminated\r\nwith his life.\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence, at the very moment of Matthioly’s death, his\r\nmaster, Charles IV., Duke of Mantua, arrived in Paris. But he--who had\r\nabandoned himself more and more to Louis XIV., to whom he had sold one\r\nof the keys of Italy, and had recently delivered up Mantua itself,\r\nbesides having several times permitted him to pass through his States\r\nin order to invade the peninsula--was fêted as he deserved to be, and\r\nwas received as a true Frenchman. He descended at the Palace of the\r\nLuxembourg, magnificently fitted up for him with the furniture of\r\nthe Crown. Seven tables were constantly served at the King’s expense\r\nfor the Duke and his suite, and brilliant fêtes were given him at\r\nMeudon and Versailles, where he received from Louis XIV. a splendid\r\nsword covered with diamonds.[651] It has been said[652] that it would\r\nhave been extremely imprudent to have inscribed Matthioly’s real\r\nname upon the registers of Saint-Paul’s, at the date of the Duke’s\r\narrival in Paris, since the latter might thus have become acquainted\r\nwith his death. We know what kind of interest Charles IV. took in his\r\nex-confidant, and we have seen that he only troubled himself with\r\nmaking sure of his positive disappearance. Instead, therefore, of the\r\nfact of this death being concealed from him, it is very possible that he was made acquainted with it,\r\nwith the view of altogether dissipating his alarms. However this\r\nmay be, history presents some singular meetings, and reality often\r\nsurpasses in interest the most romantic fancies of the imagination. Of\r\nthe two individuals who had played the principal part in the cession of\r\nCasale to Louis XIV., the Prince who had agreed to it contrary to his\r\nduty, in order to obtain a little money and satisfy his prodigality,\r\nwas the object of gorgeous fêtes; while at the same moment, in the\r\nsame town, and only a short distance off, his ex-Minister, whom he\r\nhad created Senator and Count, who was allied to the most illustrious\r\nfamilies of his country, and who had once also been magnificently\r\nreceived by Louis XIV. at Versailles, but who had afterwards for an\r\ninstant arrested the monarch’s overwhelming ambition and delayed\r\nthe servitude of Mantua, was dying far away from his friends, in a\r\nlittle chamber of the Bastille, after a captivity of four-and-twenty\r\nyears; and the next day, at the fall of night, was obscurely borne to\r\nthe neighbouring church, followed only by two subordinate officials\r\nbelonging to the fortress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[624] _Journal_, vol. i. p. 133.\r\n\r\n[625] _Mémoires de Mademoiselle de Montpensier_, vol. iii. p. 225.\r\n\r\n[626] _Mémoires de Saint-Simon_, vol. xiii. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[627] _Souvenirs de Madame de Caylus_.\r\n\r\n[628] _Correspondance Administrative sous Louis XIV._, vol. ii. p. 571.\r\nSee also M.

The Duke begged the King to tell\r\nhim what it was. But he could obtain no other reply save _that all\r\nthe conjectures as yet formed concerning this prisoner were mistaken\r\nones_.” As Madame Dubarry caused the Duke de Choiseul to be disgraced\r\nin 1770, the conversation narrated must have taken place previous to\r\nthis date. Now it was only on June 28, 1770, that Baron d’Heiss was the\r\nfirst person in France to advance, in a letter addressed to the authors\r\nof the _Journal Encyclopédique_, as we have stated in Chapter xxi., p.\r\n295, _ante_, the theory which makes Matthioly the Man with the Iron\r\nMask, and this letter was inserted in the part for August 15, 1770.\r\nThe abduction of Matthioly had been narrated at Leyden in 1687,[638]\r\nbut it was only in August, 1770, that the theory began to be known and\r\ndebated. Louis XV.’s reply to the Duke de Choiseul can therefore be\r\nvery well reconciled with the theory.\r\n\r\nDutens adds that some time afterwards Madame de Pompadour pressed the\r\nKing to give an explanation with reference to this subject, and that\r\nLouis XV. told her that he believed _it was a minister of an Italian\r\nprince_.\r\n\r\nM. Giraud (of the Institute) has often heard Madame de Boigne relate\r\nthe following anecdote which he has given me authority to publish.\r\nMadame de Boigne was the daughter of the Marquis d’Osmond, who held a\r\nhigh position at the court of Louis XVI. In one of her conversations\r\nwith the Marquis, Madame Adelaide related the check which her curiosity\r\nhad received with reference to the Iron Mask. She had persuaded her\r\nbrother the Dauphin to question the King concerning this famous\r\nprisoner, so that he might tell her the secret afterwards. The Dauphin\r\nwas then very young, and at the first word that he uttered, Louis XV.\r\ninquired, smiling: “Who has charged you to ask me this question?” The\r\nDauphin acknowledged that it was his sister. The King refused to give a\r\ncomplete answer, but observed that the secret had never been of great\r\nimportance, and at that time no longer possessed any interest.\r\n\r\nThe same anecdote has been related to us in almost identical words by\r\nM. Guillaume Guizot, who also had it from Madame de Boigne.\r\n\r\nIn page 47 of the _Souvenirs du Baron de Gleichen_ recently published\r\nby M. Grimblot, we read that the Duke de Choiseul had vainly made\r\nresearches among the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in\r\norder to discover the secret of the Iron Mask. There is nothing very\r\nsurprising in this. These Archives contain all the documents that we\r\nhave reproduced or quoted, treating of Matthioly’s abduction. They also\r\ncontain, spread among a number of series and volumes, the despatches\r\nwhich prove the evident interest that the Duke of Mantua had in the\r\ndefinitive disappearance of his ex-confidant. But if these documents,\r\nof which the greater portion were unpublished, have furnished me with\r\narguments for the support of the Matthioly theory, it is not in these\r\nArchives but in those of the Ministry of War that I have discovered the\r\ndespatches which have enabled me to establish the complete agreement\r\nbetween the individual carried off May 2, 1679, and the prisoner who\r\narrived at the Bastille with Saint-Mars, September 18, 1698, and died\r\nthere November 19, 1703. Researches made solely in the Archives of\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, would have led to nothing. It was\r\nnecessary to make them in all the collections, and afterwards to\r\ncompare the various results, the combination of which alone enables us\r\nto obtain a solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n[638] In a work entitled _Histoire abrégée de l’Europe_, which, after\r\nspeaking of Matthioly’s proceedings with reference to the treaty for\r\nthe surrender of Casale and describing his capture and imprisonment,\r\ngoes on to say: “At Pignerol he was thought to be too near Italy,\r\nand, though he was guarded very carefully, it was feared that the\r\nwalls might tell tales; he was therefore removed thence to the Isles\r\nSainte-Marguerite, where he is at present, under the care of M. de\r\nSaint-Mars, the governor.”--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[639] This objection has often been made.\r\n\r\n[640] This is one of the points on which Father Griffet relies most of\r\nall in order to prove the excessive importance of this prisoner. The\r\nquotation which we have given from Dujonca’s notes, establishes the\r\nfact that he was obliged to act thus for all the prisoners. But besides\r\nthese notes, as yet unpublished, the _Journal de Dujonca_ furnishes\r\nseveral proofs of what we advance.\r\n\r\n[641] We have given these notes in Chapter XIII. pp. 167-169, _ante_.\r\n\r\n[642] Taulès was the first to put forward this objection.\r\n\r\n[643] The reader will remember that this was Matthioly’s supposititious\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[644] Despatch from Catinat to Louvois, May 6, 1679. Given by Delort,\r\np. 214.\r\n\r\n[645] The following is a literal translation of the entry in the\r\nRegister in question, a facsimile of which forms the frontispiece to\r\nthe present volume:--\r\n\r\n“The 19th Marchialy aged forty-five years or about has died in the\r\nbastile, whose body has been buried in the cemetery of st. Paul his\r\nparish the 20th of the present [month] in the presence of Monsieur\r\nRosage major of the bastile and Mr. Reglhe surgeon-major of the bastile\r\nwho have signed.\r\n\r\n  “ROSARGES.”      “REILHE.”\r\n\r\nIn _La Bastille Dévoilée_, a work of doubtful authenticity, as also in\r\nthe _Mélanges d’Histoire et de Littérature_ of Mr. Quintin Craufurd,\r\nwho professes to make the statement on the authority of M. Delaunay,\r\nthe unfortunate governor of the Bastille in the reign of Louis XVI.,\r\nit is asserted that the prisoner “was buried in a winding-sheet of new\r\nlinen; and for the most part everything that was found in his chamber\r\nwas burnt, such as every part of his bed, including the mattresses, his\r\ntables, chairs, and other utensils, which were all reduced to powder\r\nand to cinders, and thrown into the drains. The rest of the things,\r\nsuch as the silver, copper, and pewter, were melted. This prisoner\r\nwas lodged in the third chamber of the tower Bertaudière, which room\r\nwas scraped and filed quite to the stone, and fresh whitewashed from\r\nthe top to the bottom. The doors and windows were burnt like the\r\nrest.”--_Trans._\r\n\r\n[646] Dissertation on the Man with the Iron Mask, in his _Traité des\r\nDifférentes Sortes de Preuves_.\r\n\r\n[647] _Mémoires de Mallet du Pan._\r\n\r\n[648] The name is written in several ways. I have chosen the\r\northography most generally adopted in the despatches. We find Matioli,\r\nMatheoli, and Marthioly. [Also Mattioli, Matioly, and Matthioli. Louis\r\nXIV. writes it indiscriminately Mathioly, Matthioli, and Matthioly--in\r\ndifferent ways even in the same despatch.--_Trans._]\r\n\r\n[649] M. P. Clément quotes a curious example of this negligence in\r\nhis _Police sous Louis XIV._, p. 102, note 1. The correct name of the\r\nItalian, accomplice of Sainte-Croix in the _Affaire des Poisons_, was\r\nEgidio, but in the documents he is called Exili.\r\n\r\n[650] Unpublished despatch:--Archives of the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, section Savoy, 68.
