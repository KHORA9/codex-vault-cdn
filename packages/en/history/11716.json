Widely\r\nseparated, engaged on other duties, and pressed for time, we have had\r\nno opportunity for interchange of views. Each must be held responsible,\r\ntherefore, for his own section alone. If there be any discrepancies in\r\nour writings (it is not unlikely in so disputed a field of history) we\r\ncan only regret an unfortunate result of the circumstances. Owing to\r\nrapid change in the relations of our country to the several Balkan\r\npeoples, the tone of a section written earlier may differ from that of\r\nanother written later. It may be well to state that the sections on\r\nSerbia and Bulgaria were finished before the decisive Balkan\r\ndevelopments of the past two months. Those on Greece and Rumania\r\nrepresent only a little later stage of the evolution. That on Turkey,\r\ncompiled between one mission abroad and another, was the latest to be\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nIf our sympathies are not all the same, or given equally to friends and\r\nfoes, none of us would find it possible to indite a Hymn of Hate about\r\nany Balkan people. Every one of these peoples, on whatever side he be\r\nfighting to-day, has a past worthy of more than our respect and\r\ninterwoven in some intimate way with our history. That any one of them\r\nis arrayed against us to-day is not to be laid entirely or chiefly at\r\nits own door. They are all fine peoples who have not obtained their\r\nproper places in the sun. The best of the Osmanli nation, the Anatolian\r\npeasantry, has yet to make its physical and moral qualities felt under\r\ncivilized conditions. As for the rest—the Serbs and the Bulgars, who\r\nhave enjoyed brief moments of barbaric glory in their past, have still\r\nto find themselves in that future which shall be to the Slav. The\r\nGreeks, who were old when we were not as yet, are younger now than we.\r\nThey are as incalculable a factor in a political forecast as another\r\nChosen Race, the Jews. Their past is the world’s glory: the present in\r\nthe Near East is theirs more than any people’s: the future—despite the\r\nlaws of corporate being and decline, dare we say they will have no part\r\nin it? Of Rumania what are we to think? Her mixed people has had the\r\nstart of the Balkan Slavs in modern civilization, and evidently her\r\nboundaries must grow wider yet. But the limits of her possible\r\nexpansion are easier to set than those of the rest.\r\n\r\nWe hope we have dealt fairly with all these peoples. Mediaeval history,\r\nwhether of the East or the West, is mostly a record of bloodshedding\r\nand cruelty; and the Middle Age has been prolonged to our own time in\r\nmost parts of the Balkans, and is not yet over in some parts. There are\r\ncertain things salutary to bear in mind when we think or speak of any\r\npart of that country to-day. First, that less than two hundred years\r\nago, England had its highwaymen on all roads, and its smuggler dens and\r\ncaravans, Scotland its caterans, and Ireland its moonlighters. Second,\r\nthat religious fervour has rarely mitigated and generally increased our\r\nown savagery. Thirdly, that our own policy in Balkan matters has been\r\nnone too wise, especially of late. In permitting the Treaty of Bucarest\r\nthree years ago, we were parties to making much of the trouble that has\r\nensued, and will ensue again. If we have not been able to write about\r\nthe Near East under existing circumstances altogether _sine ira et\r\nstudio_, we have tried to remember that each of its peoples has a case.\r\n\r\nD.G. HOGARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November_, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULGARIA AND SERBIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n_Introductory_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of what may be called the trunk or _massif_ of the Balkan\r\npeninsula, bounded on the north by the rivers Save and Danube, on the\r\nwest by the Adriatic, on the east by the Black Sea, and on the south by\r\na very irregular line running from Antivari (on the coast of the\r\nAdriatic) and the lake of Scutari in the west, through lakes Okhrida\r\nand Prespa (in Macedonia) to the outskirts of Salonika and thence to\r\nMidia on the shores of the Black Sea, following the coast of the Aegean\r\nSea some miles inland, is preponderatingly inhabited by Slavs. These\r\nSlavs are the Bulgarians in the east and centre, the Serbs and Croats\r\n(or Serbians and Croatians or Serbo-Croats) in the west, and the\r\nSlovenes in the extreme north-west, between Trieste and the Save; these\r\nnationalities compose the southern branch of the Slavonic race. The\r\nother inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula are, to the south of the\r\nSlavs, the Albanians in the west, the Greeks in the centre and south,\r\nand the Turks in the south-east, and, to the north, the Rumanians. All\r\nfour of these nationalities are to be found in varying quantities\r\nwithin the limits of the Slav territory roughly outlined above, but\r\ngreater numbers of them are outside it; on the other hand, there are a\r\nconsiderable number of Serbs living north of the rivers Save and\r\nDanube, in southern Hungary. Details of the ethnic distribution and\r\nboundaries will of course be gone into more fully later; meanwhile\r\nattention may be called to the significant fact that the name of\r\nMacedonia, the heart of the Balkan peninsula, has been long used by the\r\nFrench gastronomers to denote a dish, the principal characteristic of\r\nwhich is that its component parts are mixed up into quite inextricable\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nOf the three Slavonic nationalities already mentioned, the two first,\r\nthe Bulgarians and the Serbo-Croats, occupy a much greater space,\r\ngeographically and historically, than the third. The Slovenes, barely\r\none and a half million in number, inhabiting the Austrian provinces of\r\nCarinthia and Carniola, have never been able to form a political state,\r\nthough, with the growth of Trieste as a great port and the persistent\r\nefforts of Germany to make her influence if not her flag supreme on the\r\nshores of the Adriatic, this small people has from its geographical\r\nposition and from its anti-German (and anti-Italian) attitude achieved\r\nconsiderable notoriety and some importance.\r\n\r\nOf the Bulgars and Serbs it may be said that at the present moment the\r\nformer control the eastern, and the latter, in alliance with the\r\nGreeks, the western half of the peninsula. It has always been the\r\nambition of each of these three nationalities to dominate the whole, an\r\nambition which has caused endless waste of blood and money and untold\r\nmisery. If the question were to be settled purely on ethnical\r\nconsiderations, Bulgaria would acquire the greater part of the interior\r\nof Macedonia, the most numerous of the dozen nationalities of which is\r\nBulgarian in sentiment if not in origin, and would thus undoubtedly\r\nattain the hegemony of the peninsula, while the centre of gravity of\r\nthe Serbian nation would, as is ethnically just, move north-westwards.\r\nPolitical considerations, however, have until now always been against\r\nthis solution of the difficulty, and, even if it solved in this sense,\r\nthere would still remain the problem of the Greek nationality, whose\r\ndistribution along all the coasts of the Aegean, both European and\r\nAsiatic, makes a delimitation of the Greek state on purely ethnical\r\nlines virtually impossible. It is curious that the Slavs, though\r\nmasters of the interior of the peninsula and of parts of its eastern\r\nand western coasts, have never made the shores of the Aegean (the White\r\nSea, as they call it) or the cities on them their own. The Adriatic is\r\nthe only sea on the shore of which any Slavonic race has ever made its\r\nhome. In view of this difficulty, namely, the interior of the peninsula\r\nbeing Slavonic while the coastal fringe is Greek, and of the\r\napproximately equal numerical strength of all three nations, it is\r\nalmost inevitable that the ultimate solution of the problem and\r\ndelimitation of political boundaries will have to be effected by means\r\nof territorial compromise. It can only be hoped that this ultimate\r\ncompromise will be agreed upon by the three countries concerned, and\r\nwill be more equitable than that which was forced on them by Rumania in\r\n1913 and laid down in the Treaty of Bucarest of that year.\r\n\r\nIf no arrangement on a principle of give and take is made between them,\r\nthe road to the East, which from the point of view of the Germanic\r\npowers lies through Serbia, will sooner or later inevitably be forced\r\nopen, and the independence, first of Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania,\r\nand later of Bulgaria and Greece, will disappear, _de facto_ if not in\r\nappearance, and both materially and morally they will become the slaves\r\nof the central empires. If the Balkan League could be reconstituted,\r\nGermany and Austria would never reach Salonika or Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n_The Balkan Peninsula in Classical Times_\r\n400 B.C.–A.D. 500.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier historical times the whole of the eastern part of the\r\nBalkan peninsula between the Danube and the Aegean was known as\r\nThracia, while the western part (north of the forty-first degree of\r\nlatitude) was termed Illyricum; the lower basin of the river Vardar\r\n(the classical Axius) was called Macedonia. A number of the tribal and\r\npersonal names of the early Illyrians and Thracians have been\r\npreserved. Philip of Macedonia subdued Thrace in the fourth century\r\nB.C. and in 342 founded the city of Philippopolis. Alexander’s first\r\ncampaign was devoted to securing control of the peninsula, but during\r\nthe Third century B.C. Thrace was invaded from the north and laid waste\r\nby the Celts, who had already visited Illyria. The Celts vanished by\r\nthe end of that century, leaving a few place-names to mark their\r\npassage. The city of Belgrade was known until the seventh century A.D.\r\nby its Celtic name of Singidunum. Naissus, the modern Nish, is also\r\npossibly of Celtic origin. It was towards 230 B.C. that Rome came into\r\ncontact with Illyricum, owing to the piratical proclivities of its\r\ninhabitants, but for a long time it only controlled the Dalmatian\r\ncoast, so called after the Delmati or Dalmati, an Illyrian tribe. The\r\nreason for this was the formidable character of the mountains of\r\nIllyria, which run in several parallel and almost unbroken lines the\r\nwhole length of the shore of the Adriatic and have always formed an\r\neffective barrier to invasion from the west. The interior was only very\r\ngradually subdued by the Romans after Macedonia had been occupied by\r\nthem in 146 B.C. Throughout the first century B.C. conflicts raged with\r\nvarying fortune between the invaders and all the native races living\r\nbetween the Adriatic and the Danube. They were attacked both from\r\nAquileia in the north and from Macedonia in the south, but it was not\r\ntill the early years of our era that the Danube became the frontier of\r\nthe Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 6 Moesia, which included a large part of the modern\r\nkingdom of Serbia and the northern half of that of Bulgaria between the\r\nDanube and the Balkan range (the classical Haemus), became an imperial\r\nprovince, and twenty years later Thrace, the country between the Balkan\r\nrange and the Aegean, was incorporated in the empire, and was made a\r\nprovince by the Emperor Claudius in A.D. 46. The province of Illyricum\r\nor Dalmatia stretched between the Save and the Adriatic, and Pannonia\r\nlay between the Danube and the Save. In 107 A.D. the Emperor Trajan\r\nconquered the Dacians beyond the lower Danube, and organized a province\r\nof Dacia out of territory roughly equivalent to the modern Wallachia\r\nand Transylvania, This trans-Danubian territory did not remain attached\r\nto the empire for more than a hundred and fifty years; but within the\r\nriver line a vast belt of country, stretching from the head of the\r\nAdriatic to the mouths of the Danube on the Black Sea, was Romanized\r\nthrough and through. The Emperor Trajan has been called the Charlemagne\r\nof the Balkan peninsula; all remains are attributed to him (he was\r\nnicknamed the Wallflower by Constantine the Great), and his reign\r\nmarked the zenith of Roman power in this part of the world. The Balkan\r\npeninsula enjoyed the benefits of Roman civilization for three\r\ncenturies, from the first to the fourth, but from the second century\r\nonwards the attitude of the Romans was defensive rather than offensive.\r\nThe war against the Marcomanni under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, in\r\nthe second half of this century, was the turning-point. Rome was still\r\nvictorious, but no territory was added to the empire. The third century\r\nsaw the southward movement of the Germanic peoples, who took the place\r\nof the Celts. The Goths invaded the peninsula, and in 251 the Emperor\r\nDecius was killed in battle against them near Odessus on the Black Sea\r\n(the modern Varna). The Goths reached the outskirts of Thessalonica\r\n(Salonika), but were defeated by the Emperor Claudius at Naissus (Nish)\r\nin 269; shortly afterwards, however, the Emperor Aurelian had\r\ndefinitively to relinquish Dacia to them. The Emperor Diocletian, a\r\nnative of Dalmatia, who reigned from 284 to 305, carried out a\r\nredistribution of the imperial provinces. Pannonia and western Illyria,\r\nor Dalmatia, were assigned to the prefecture of Italy, Thrace to that\r\nof the Orient, while the whole centre of the peninsula, from the Danube\r\nto the Peloponnese, constituted the prefecture of Illyria, with\r\nThessalonica as capital. The territory to the north of the Danube\r\nhaving been lost, what is now western Bulgaria was renamed Dacia, while\r\nMoesia, the modern kingdom of Serbia, was made very much smaller.\r\nPraevalis, or the southern part of Dalmatia, approximately the modern\r\nMontenegro and Albania, was detached from that province and added to\r\nthe prefecture of Illyria. In this way the boundary between the\r\nprovince of Dalmatia and the Balkan peninsula proper ran from near the\r\nlake of Scutari in the south to the river Drinus (the modern Drina),\r\nwhose course it followed till the Save was reached in the north.\r\n\r\nAn event of far-reaching importance in the following century was the\r\nelevation by Constantine the Great of the Greek colony of Byzantium\r\ninto the imperial city of Constantinople in 325. This century also\r\nwitnessed the arrival of the Huns in Europe from Asia. They overwhelmed\r\nthe Ostrogoths, between the Dnieper and the Dniester, in 375, and the\r\nVisigoths, settled in Transylvania and the modern Rumania, moved\r\nsouthwards in sympathy with this event. The Emperor Valens lost his\r\nlife fighting against these Goths in 378 at the great battle of\r\nAdrianople (a city established in Thrace by the Emperor Hadrian in the\r\nsecond century). His successor, the Emperor Theodosius, placated them\r\nwith gifts and made them guardians of the northern frontier, but at his\r\ndeath, in 395, they overran and devastated the entire peninsula, after\r\nwhich they proceeded to Italy. After the death of the Emperor\r\nTheodosius the empire was divided, never to be joined into one whole\r\nagain. The dividing line followed that, already mentioned, which\r\nseparated the prefecture of Italy from those of Illyria and the Orient,\r\nthat is to say, it began in the south, on the shore of the Adriatic\r\nnear the Bocche di Cattaro, and went due north along the valley of the\r\nDrina till the confluence of that river with the Save. It will be seen\r\nthat this division had consequences which have lasted to the present\r\nday. Generally speaking, the Western Empire was Latin in language and\r\ncharacter, while the Eastern was Greek, though owing to the importance\r\nof the Danubian provinces to Rome from the military point of view, and\r\nthe lively intercourse maintained between them, Latin influence in them\r\nwas for a long time stronger than Greek. Its extent is proved by the\r\nfact that the people of modern Rumania are partly, and their language\r\nvery largely, defended from those of the legions and colonies of the\r\nEmperor Trajan.\r\n\r\nLatin influence, shipping, colonization, and art were always supreme on\r\nthe eastern shores of the Adriatic, just as were those of Greece on the\r\nshores of the Black Sea. The Albanians even, descendants of the ancient\r\nIllyrians, were affected by the supremacy of the Latin language, from\r\nwhich no less than a quarter of their own meagre vocabulary is derived;\r\nthough driven southwards by the Romans and northwards by the Greeks,\r\nthey have remained in their mountain fastnesses to this day, impervious\r\nto any of the civilizations to which they have been exposed.\r\n\r\nChristianity spread to the shores of the peninsula very early;\r\nMacedonia and Dalmatia were the parts where it was first established,\r\nand it took some time to penetrate into the interior. During the reign\r\nof Diocletian numerous martyrs suffered for the faith in the Danubian\r\nprovinces, but with the accession of Constantine the Great persecution\r\ncame to an end. As soon, however, as the Christians were left alone,\r\nthey started persecuting each other, and during the fourth century the\r\nArian controversy re-echoed throughout the peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century the Huns moved from the shores of the Black Sea to\r\nthe plains of the Danube and the Theiss; they devastated the Balkan\r\npeninsula, in spite of the tribute which they had levied on\r\nConstantinople in return for their promise of peace. After the death of\r\nAttila, in 453, they again retreated to Asia, and during the second\r\nhalf of the century the Goths were once more supreme in the peninsula.\r\nTheodoric occupied Singidunum (Belgrade) in 471 and, after plundering\r\nMacedonia and Greece, settled in Novae (the modern Svishtov), on the\r\nlower Danube, in 483, where he remained till he transferred the sphere\r\nof his activities to Italy ten years later. Towards the end of the\r\nfifth century Huns of various kinds returned to the lower Danube and\r\ndevastated the peninsula several times, penetrating as far as Epirus\r\nand Thessaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n_The Arrival of the Slavs in the Balkan Peninsula_, A.D. 500–650\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Balkan peninsula, which had been raised to a high level of security\r\nand prosperity during the Roman dominion, gradually relapsed into\r\nbarbarism as a result of these endless invasions; the walled towns,\r\nsuch as Salonika and Constantinople, were the only safe places, and the\r\ncountry became waste and desolate. The process continued unabated\r\nthroughout the three following centuries, and one is driven to one of\r\ntwo conclusions, either that these lands must have possessed very\r\nextraordinary powers of recuperation to make it worth while for\r\ninvaders to pillage them so frequently, or, what is more probable,\r\nthere can have been after some time little left to plunder, and\r\nconsequently the Byzantine historians’ accounts of enormous drives of\r\nprisoners and booty are much exaggerated. It is impossible to count the\r\nnumber of times the tide of invasion and devastation swept southwards\r\nover the unfortunate peninsula. The emperors and their generals did\r\nwhat they could by means of defensive works on the frontiers, of\r\npunitive expeditions, and of trying to set the various hordes of\r\nbarbarians at loggerheads with each other, but, as they had at the same\r\ntime to defend an empire which stretched from Armenia to Spain, it is\r\nnot surprising that they were not more successful. The growing riches\r\nof Constantinople and Salonika had an irresistible attraction for the\r\nwild men from the east and north, and unfortunately the Greek citizens\r\nwere more inclined to spend their energy in theological disputes and\r\ntheir leisure in the circus than to devote either the one or the other\r\nto the defence of their country. It was only by dint of paying them\r\nhuge sums of money that the invaders were kept away from the coast. The\r\ndeparture of the Huns and the Goths had made the way for fresh series\r\nof unwelcome visitors. In the sixth century the Slavs appear for the\r\nfirst time. From their original homes which were immediately north of\r\nthe Carpathians, in Galicia and Poland, but may also have included\r\nparts of the modern Hungary, they moved southwards and south-eastwards.\r\nThey were presumably in Dacia, north of the Danube, in the previous\r\ncentury, but they are first mentioned as having crossed that river\r\nduring the reign of the Emperor Justin I (518-27). They were a\r\nloosely-knit congeries of tribes without any single leader or central\r\nauthority; some say they merely possessed the instinct of anarchy,\r\nothers that they were permeated with the ideals of democracy. What is\r\ncertain is that amongst them neither leadership nor initiative was\r\ndeveloped, and that they lacked both cohesion and organisation. The\r\nEastern Slavs, the ancestors of the Russians, were only welded into\r\nanything approaching unity by the comparatively much smaller number of\r\nScandinavian (Varangian) adventurers who came and took charge of their\r\naffairs at Kiev. Similarly the Southern Slavs were never of themselves\r\nable to form a united community, conscious of its aim and capable of\r\npersevering in its attainment.\r\n\r\nThe Slavs did not invade the Balkan peninsula alone but in the company\r\nof the Avars, a terrible and justly dreaded nation, who, like the Huns,\r\nwere of Asiatic (Turkish or Mongol) origin. These invasions became more\r\nfrequent during the reign of the Emperor Justinian I (527-65), and\r\nculminated in 559 in a great combined attack of all the invaders on\r\nConstantinople under a certain Zabergan, which was brilliantly defeated\r\nby the veteran Byzantine general Belisarius. The Avars were a nomad\r\ntribe, and the horse was their natural means of locomotion. The Slavs,\r\non the other hand, moved about on foot, and seem to have been used as\r\ninfantry by the more masterful Asiatics in their warlike expeditions.\r\nGenerally speaking, the Avars, who must have been infinitely less\r\nnumerous than the Slavs, were settled in Hungary, where Attila and the\r\nHuns had been settled a little more than a century previously; that is\r\nto say, they were north of the Danube, though they were always\r\noverrunning into Upper Moesia, the modern Serbia. The Slavs, whose\r\nnumbers were without doubt very large, gradually settled all over the\r\ncountry south of the Danube, the rural parts of which, as a result of\r\nincessant invasion and retreat, had become waste and empty. During the\r\nsecond half of the sixth century all the military energies of\r\nConstantinople were diverted to Persia, so that the invaders of the\r\nBalkan peninsula had the field very much to themselves. It was during\r\nthis time that the power of the Avars reached its height. They were\r\nmasters of all the country up to the walls of Adrianople and Salonika,\r\nthough they did not settle there. The peninsula seems to have been\r\ncolonized by Slavs, who penetrated right down into Greece; but the\r\nAvars were throughout this time, both in politics and in war, the\r\ndirecting and dominating force. During another Persian war, which broke\r\nout in 622 and entailed the prolonged absence of the emperor from\r\nConstantinople, the Avars, not satisfied with the tribute extorted from\r\nthe Greeks, made an alliance against them with the Persians, and in 626\r\ncollected a large army of Slavs and Asiatics and attacked\r\nConstantinople both by land and sea from the European side, while the\r\nPersians threatened it from Asia. But the walls of the city and the\r\nships of the Greeks proved invincible, and, quarrels breaking out\r\nbetween the Slavs and the Avars, both had to save themselves in\r\nignominious and precipitate retreat.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing more was heard of the Avars in the Balkan peninsula,\r\nthough their power was only finally crushed by Charlemagne in 799. In\r\nRussia their downfall became proverbial, being crystallized in the\r\nsaying, ‘they perished like Avars’. The Slavs, on the other hand,\r\nremained. Throughout these stormy times their penetration of the Balkan\r\npeninsula had been peacefully if unostentatiously proceeding; by the\r\nmiddle of the seventh century it was complete. The main streams of\r\nSlavonic immigration moved southwards and westwards. The first covered\r\nthe whole of the country between the Danube and the Balkan range,\r\noverflowed into Macedonia, and filtered down into Greece. Southern\r\nThrace in the east and Albania in the west were comparatively little\r\naffected, and in these districts the indigenous population maintained\r\nitself. The coasts of the Aegean and the great cities on or near them\r\nwere too strongly held by the Greeks to be affected, and those Slavs\r\nwho penetrated into Greece itself were soon absorbed by the local\r\npopulations. The still stronger Slavonic stream, which moved westwards\r\nand turned up north-westwards, overran the whole country down to the\r\nshores of the Adriatic and as far as the sources of the Save and Drave\r\nin the Alps. From that point in the west to the shores of the Black Sea\r\nin the east became one solid mass of Slavs, and has remained so ever\r\nsince. The few Slavs who were left north of the Danube in Dacia were\r\ngradually assimilated by the inhabitants of that province, who were the\r\ndescendants of the Roman soldiers and colonists, and the ancestors of\r\nthe modern Rumanians, but the fact that Slavonic influence there was\r\nstrong is shown by the large number of words of Slavonic origin\r\ncontained in the Rumanian language.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BALKAN PENINSULA ETHNOLOGICAL]\r\n\r\nPlace-names are a good index of the extent and strength of the tide of\r\nSlav immigration. All along the coast, from the mouth of the Danube to\r\nthe head of the Adriatic, the Greek and Roman names have been retained\r\nthough places have often been given alternative names by the Slavonic\r\nsettlers. Thrace, especially the south-eastern part, and Albania have\r\nthe fewest Slavonic place-names. In Macedonia and Lower Moesia\r\n(Bulgaria) very few classical names have survived, while in Upper\r\nMoesia (Serbia) and the interior of Dalmatia (Bosnia, Hercegovina, and\r\nMontenegro) they have entirely disappeared. The Slavs themselves,\r\nthough their tribal names were known, were until the ninth century\r\nusually called collectively S(k)lavini ([Greek: Sklabaenoi]) by the\r\nGreeks, and all the inland parts of the peninsula were for long termed\r\nby them ‘the S(k)lavonias’ ([Greek: Sklabiniai]).\r\n\r\nDuring the seventh century, dating from the defeat of the Slavs and\r\nAvars before the walls of Constantinople in 626 and the final triumph\r\nof the emperor over the Persians in 628, the influence and power of the\r\nGreeks began to reassert itself throughout the peninsula as far north\r\nas the Danube; this process was coincident with the decline of the\r\nmight of the Avars. It was the custom of the astute Byzantine diplomacy\r\nto look on and speak of lands which had been occupied by the various\r\nbarbarian invaders as grants made to them through the generosity of the\r\nemperor; by this means, by dint also of lavishing titles and\r\nsubstantial incomes to the invaders’ chiefs, by making the most of\r\ntheir mutual jealousies, and also by enlisting regiments of Slavonic\r\nmercenaries in the imperial armies, the supremacy of Constantinople was\r\nregained far more effectively than it could have been by the continual\r\nand exhausting use of force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULGARIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n_The Arrival of the Bulgars in the Balkan Peninsula,_ 600–700\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Bulgars towards the Balkan peninsula, and indeed\r\nall their movements until their final establishment there in the\r\nseventh century, are involved in obscurity. They are first mentioned by\r\nname in classical and Armenian sources in 482 as living in the steppes\r\nto the north of the Black Sea amongst other Asiatic tribes, and it has\r\nbeen assumed by some that at the end of the fifth and throughout the\r\nsixth century they were associated first with the Huns and later with\r\nthe Avars and Slavs in the various incursions into and invasions of the\r\neastern empire which have already been enumerated. It is the tendency\r\nof Bulgarian historians, who scornfully point to the fact that the\r\nhistory of Russia only dates from the ninth century, to exaggerate the\r\nantiquity of their own and to claim as early a date as possible for the\r\nauthentic appearance of their ancestors on the kaleidoscopic stage of\r\nthe Balkan theatre. They are also unwilling to admit that they were\r\nanticipated by the Slavs; they prefer to think that the Slavs only\r\ninsinuated themselves there thanks to the energy of the Bulgars’\r\noffensive against the Greeks, and that as soon as the Bulgars had\r\nleisure to look about them they found all the best places already\r\noccupied by the anarchic Slavs.\r\n\r\nOf course it is very difficult to say positively whether Bulgars were\r\nor were not present in the welter of Asiatic nations which swept\r\nwestwards into Europe with little intermission throughout the fifth and\r\nsixth centuries, but even if they were, they do not seem to have\r\nsettled down as early as that anywhere south of the Danube; it seems\r\ncertain that they did not do so until the seventh century, and\r\ntherefore that the Slavs were definitely installed in the Balkan\r\npeninsula a whole century before the Bulgars crossed the Danube for\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgars, like the Huns and the Avars who preceded them, and like\r\nthe Magyars and the Turks who followed them, were a tribe from eastern\r\nAsia, of the stock known as Mongol or Tartar. The tendency of all these\r\npeoples was to move westwards from Asia into Europe, and this they did\r\nat considerable and irregular intervals, though in alarming and\r\napparently inexhaustible numbers, roughly from the fourth till the\r\nfourteenth centuries. The distance was great, but the journey, thanks\r\nto the flat, grassy, treeless, and well-watered character of the\r\nsteppes of southern Russia which they had to cross, was easy. They\r\noften halted for considerable periods by the way, and some never moved\r\nfurther westwards than Russia. Thus at one time the Bulgars settled in\r\nlarge numbers on the Volga, near its confluence with the Kama, and it\r\nis presumed that they were well established there in the fifth century.\r\nThey formed a community of considerable strength and importance, known\r\nas Great or White Bulgaria. These Bulgars fused with later Tartar\r\nimmigrants from Asia and eventually were consolidated into the powerful\r\nkingdom of Kazan, which was only crushed by the Tsar Ivan IV in 1552.\r\nAccording to Bulgarian historians, the basins of the rivers Volga and\r\nDon and the steppes of eastern Russia proved too confined a space for\r\nthe legitimate development of Bulgarian energy, and expansion to the\r\nwest was decided on. A large number of Bulgars therefore detached\r\nthemselves and began to move south-westwards. During the sixth century\r\nthey seem to have been settled in the country to the north of the Black\r\nSea, forming a colony known as Black Bulgaria. It is very doubtful\r\nwhether the Bulgars did take part, as they are supposed to have done,\r\nin the ambitious but unsuccessful attack on Constantinople in 559 under\r\nZabergan, chief of another Tartar tribe; but it is fairly certain that\r\nthey did in the equally formidable but equally unsuccessful attacks by\r\nthe Slavs and Avars against Salonika in 609 and Constantinople in 626.\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of the sixth and the first of the seventh\r\ncentury the various branches of the Bulgar nation, stretching from the\r\nVolga to the Danube, were consolidated and kept in control by their\r\nprince Kubrat, who eventually fought on behalf of the Greeks against\r\nthe Avars, and was actually baptized in Constantinople. The power of\r\nthe Bulgars grew as that of the Avars declined, but at the death of\r\nKubrat, in 638, his realm was divided amongst his sons. One of these\r\nestablished himself in Pannonia, where he joined forces with what was\r\nleft of the Avars, and there the Bulgars maintained themselves till\r\nthey were obliterated by the irruption of the Magyars in 893. Another\r\nson, Asparukh, or Isperikh, settled in Bessarabia, between the rivers\r\nPrut and Dniester, in 640, and some years later passed southwards.\r\nAfter desultory warfare with Constantinople, from 660 onwards, his\r\nsuccessor finally overcame the Greeks, who were at that time at war\r\nwith the Arabs, captured Varna, and definitely established himself\r\nbetween the Danube and the Balkan range in the year 679. From that year\r\nthe Danube ceased to be the frontier of the eastern empire.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the Bulgars who settled south of the Danube are not\r\nknown, but what happened to them is notorious. The well-known process,\r\nby which the Franks in Gaul were absorbed by the far more numerous\r\nindigenous population which they had conquered, was repeated, and the\r\nBulgars became fused with the Slavs. So complete was the fusion, and so\r\npreponderating the influence of the subject nationality, that beyond a\r\nfew personal names no traces of the language of the Bulgars have\r\nsurvived. Modern Bulgarian, except for the Turkish words introduced\r\ninto it later during the Ottoman rule, is purely Slavonic. Not so the\r\nBulgarian nationality; as is so often the case with mongrel products,\r\nthis race, compared with the Serbs, who are purely Slav, has shown\r\nconsiderably greater virility, cohesion, and driving-power, though it\r\nmust be conceded that its problems have been infinitely simpler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n_The Early Years of Bulgaria and the Introduction of Christianity_,\r\n700–893\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of their establishment in the country to which they have\r\ngiven their name the Bulgars became a thorn in the side of the Greeks,\r\nand ever since both peoples have looked on one another as natural and\r\nhereditary enemies. The Bulgars, like all the barbarians who had\r\npreceded them, were fascinated by the honey-pot of Constantinople, and,\r\nthough they never succeeded in taking it, they never grew tired of\r\nmaking the attempt.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred years after the death of Asparukh, in 661, the Bulgars\r\nwere perpetually fighting either against the Greeks or else amongst\r\nthemselves. At times a diversion was caused by the Bulgars taking the\r\npart of the Greeks, as in 718, when they ‘delivered’ Constantinople, at\r\nthe invocation of the Emperor Leo, from the Arabs, who were besieging\r\nit. From about this time the Bulgarian monarchy, which had been\r\nhereditary, became elective, and the anarchy of the many, which the\r\nBulgars found when they arrived, and which their first few autocratic\r\nrulers had been able to control, was replaced by an anarchy of the few.\r\nPrince succeeded prince, war followed war, at the will of the feudal\r\nnobles. This internal strife was naturally profitable to the Greeks,\r\nwho lavishly subsidized the rival factions.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighth century the Bulgars south of the Danube joined\r\nforces with those to the north in the efforts of the latter against the\r\nAvars, who, beaten by Charlemagne, were again pressing south-eastwards\r\ntowards the Danube. In this the Bulgars were completely successful\r\nunder the leadership of one Krum, whom, in the elation of victory, they\r\npromptly elected to the throne. Krum was a far more capable ruler than\r\nthey had bargained for, and he not only united all the Bulgars north\r\nand south of the Danube into one dominion, but also forcibly repressed\r\nthe whims of the nobles and re-established the autocracy and the\r\nhereditary monarchy. Having finished with his enemies in the north, he\r\nturned his attention to the Greeks, with no less success. In 809 he\r\ncaptured from them the important city of Sofia (the Roman Sardica,\r\nknown to the Slavs as Sredets), which is to-day the capital of\r\nBulgaria. The loss of this city was a blow to the Greeks, because it\r\nwas a great centre of commerce and also the point at which the\r\ncommercial and strategic highways of the peninsula met and crossed. The\r\nEmperor Nikiphóros, who wished to take his revenge and recover his lost\r\nproperty, was totally defeated by the Bulgars and lost his life in the\r\nBalkan passes in 811. After further victories, at Mesembria (the modern\r\nMisivria) in 812 and Adrianople in 813, Krum appeared before the\r\ncapital, where he nearly lost his life in an ambush while negotiating\r\nfor peace. During preparations for a final assault on Constantinople he\r\ndied suddenly in 815. Though Krum cannot be said to have introduced\r\ncivilisation into Bulgaria, he at any rate increased its power and gave\r\nit some of the more essential organs of government. He framed a code of\r\nlaws remarkable for their rigour, which was undoubtedly necessary in\r\nsuch a community and beneficial in its effect. He repressed civil\r\nstrife, and by this means made possible the reawakening of commerce and\r\nagriculture. His successor, of uncertain identity, founded in 822 the\r\ncity of Preslav (known to the Russians as Pereyaslav), situated in\r\neastern Bulgaria, between Varna and Silistria, which was the capital\r\nuntil 972.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Prince Boris (852-88) is remarkable because it witnessed\r\nthe definitive conversion to Christianity of Bulgaria and her ruler. It\r\nis within this period also that fell the activities of the two great\r\n‘Slavonic’ missionaries and apostles, the brothers Cyril and Methodius,\r\nwho are looked upon by all Slavs of the orthodox faith as the founders\r\nof their civilisation. Christianity had of course penetrated into\r\nBulgaria (or Moesia, as it was then) long before the arrival of the\r\nSlavs and Bulgars, but the influx of one horde of barbarians after\r\nanother was naturally not propitious to its growth. The conversion of\r\nBoris in 865, which was brought about largely by the influence of his\r\nsister, who had spent many years in Constantinople as a captive, was a\r\ntriumph for Greek influence and for Byzantium. Though the Church was at\r\nthis time still nominally one, yet the rivalry between Rome and\r\nConstantinople had already become acute, and the struggle for spheres\r\nof spiritual influence had begun. It was in the year 863 that the\r\nPrince of Moravia, anxious to introduce Christianity into his country\r\nin a form intelligible to his subjects, addressed himself to the\r\nEmperor Michael III for help. Rome could not provide any suitable\r\nmissionaries with knowledge of Slavonic languages, and the German, or\r\nmore exactly the Bavarian, hierarchy with which Rome entrusted the\r\nspiritual welfare of the Slavs of Moravia and Pannonia used its greater\r\nlocal knowledge for political and not religious ends. The Germans\r\nexploited their ecclesiastical influence in order completely to\r\ndominate the Slavs politically, and as a result the latter were only\r\nallowed to see the Church through Teutonic glasses.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this appeal the emperor sent the two brothers Cyril and\r\nMethodius, who were Greeks of Salonika and had considerable knowledge\r\nof Slavonic languages. They composed the Slavonic alphabet which is\r\nto-day used throughout Russia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro, and in\r\nmany parts of Austria-Hungary and translated the gospels into Slavonic;\r\nit is for this reason that they are regarded with such veneration by\r\nall members of the Eastern Church. Their mission proved the greatest\r\nsuccess (it must be remembered that at this time the various Slavonic\r\ntongues were probably less dissimilar than they are now), and the two\r\nbrothers were warmly welcomed in Rome by Pope Adrian II, who formally\r\nconsented to the use, for the benefit of the Slavs, of the Slavonic\r\nliturgy (a remarkable concession, confirmed by Pope John VIII). This\r\ntriumph, however, was short-lived; St. Cyril died in 869 and St.\r\nMethodius in 885; subsequent Popes, notably Stephen V, were not so\r\nbenevolent to the Slavonic cause; the machinations of the German\r\nhierarchy (which included, even in those days, the falsification of\r\ndocuments) were irresistible, and finally the invasion of the Magyars,\r\nin 893, destroyed what was left of the Slavonic Church in Moravia. The\r\nmissionary brothers had probably passed through Bulgaria on their way\r\nnorth in 863, but without halting. Many of their disciples, driven from\r\nthe Moravian kingdom by the Germans, came south and took refuge in\r\nBulgaria in 886, and there carried on in more favourable circumstances\r\nthe teachings of their masters. Prince Boris had found it easier to\r\nadopt Christianity himself than to induce all his subjects to do the\r\nsame. Even when he had enforced his will on them at the price of\r\nnumerous executions of recalcitrant nobles, he found himself only at\r\nthe beginning of his difficulties. The Greeks had been glad enough to\r\nwelcome Bulgaria into the fold, but they had no wish to set up an\r\nindependent Church and hierarchy to rival their own. Boris, on the\r\nother hand, though no doubt full of genuine spiritual ardour, was above\r\nall impressed with the authority and prestige which the basileus\r\nderived from the Church of Constantinople; he also admired the pomp of\r\necclesiastical ceremony, and wished to have a patriarch of his own to\r\ncrown him and a hierarchy of his own to serve him. Finding the Greeks\r\nunresponsive, he turned to Rome, and Pope Nicholas I sent him two\r\nbishops to superintend the ecclesiastical affairs of Bulgaria till the\r\ninvestiture of Boris at the hands of the Holy See could be arranged.\r\nThese bishops set to work with a will, substituted the Latin for the\r\nGreek rite, and brought Bulgaria completely under Roman influence. But\r\nwhen it was discovered that Boris was aiming at the erection of an\r\nindependent Church their enthusiasm abated and they were recalled to\r\nRome in 867.\r\n\r\nAdrian II proved no more sympathetic, and in 870, during the reign of\r\nthe Emperor Basil I, it was decided without more ado that the Bulgarian\r\nChurch should be directly under the Bishop of Constantinople, on the\r\nground that the kingdom of Boris was a vassal-state of the basileus,\r\nand that from the Byzantine point of view, as opposed to that of Rome,\r\nthe State came first and the Church next. The Moravian Gorazd, a\r\ndisciple of Methodius, was appointed Metropolitan, and at his death he\r\nwas succeeded by his fellow countryman and co-disciple Clement, who by\r\nmeans of the construction of numerous churches and monasteries did a\r\ngreat deal for the propagation of light and learning in Bulgaria. The\r\ndefinite subjection of the Bulgarian Church to that of Byzantium was an\r\nimportant and far-reaching event. Boris has been reproached with\r\nsubmitting himself and his country to Greek influence, but in those\r\ndays it was either Constantinople or Rome (there was no third way); and\r\nin view of the proximity of Constantinople and the glamour which its\r\ncivilization cast all over the Balkans, it is not surprising that the\r\nGreeks carried the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n_The Rise and Fall of the First Bulgarian Empire_, 893–972\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Simeon, second son of Boris, which lasted from 893\r\nto 927, Bulgaria reached a very high level of power and prosperity.\r\nSimeon, called the Great, is looked on by Bulgarians as their most\r\ncapable monarch and his reign as the most brilliant period of their\r\nhistory. He had spent his childhood at Constantinople and been educated\r\nthere, and he became such an admirer of Greek civilization that he was\r\nnicknamed _Hèmiargos_. His instructors had done their work so well that\r\nSimeon remained spellbound by the glamour of Constantinople throughout\r\nhis life, and, although he might have laid the foundations of a solid\r\nempire in the Balkans, his one ambition was to conquer Byzantium and to\r\nbe recognized as basileus—an ambition which was not to be fulfilled.\r\nHis first campaign against the Greeks was not very fruitful, because\r\nthe latter summoned the Magyars, already settled in Hungary, to their\r\naid and they attacked Simeon from the north. Simeon in return called\r\nthe Pechenegs, another fierce Tartar tribe, to his aid, but this merely\r\nresulted in their definite establishment in Rumania. During the twenty\r\nyears of peace, which strange to say filled the middle of his reign\r\n(894-913), the internal development of Bulgaria made great strides. The\r\nadministration was properly organized, commerce was encouraged, and\r\nagriculture flourished. In the wars against the Greeks which occupied\r\nhis last years he was more successful, and inflicted a severe defeat on\r\nthem at Anchialo (the modern Ahiolu) in 917; but he was still unable to\r\nget from them what he wanted, and at last, in 921, he was obliged to\r\nproclaim himself _basileus_ and _autocratōr_ of all Bulgars and Greeks,\r\na title which nobody else recognized. He reappeared before\r\nConstantinople the same year, but effected nothing more than the\r\ncustomary devastation of the suburbs. The year 923 witnessed a solemn\r\nreconciliation between Rome and Constantinople; the Greeks were clever\r\nenough to prevent the Roman legates visiting Bulgaria on their return\r\njourney, and thereby administered a rebuff to Simeon, who was anxious\r\nto see them and enter into direct relations with Rome. In the same year\r\nSimeon tried to make an alliance with the Arabs, but the ambassadors of\r\nthe latter were intercepted by the Greeks, who made it worth their\r\nwhile not to continue the journey to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nIn 924 Simeon determined on a supreme effort against Constantinople and\r\nas a preliminary he ravaged Macedonia and Thrace. When, however, he\r\narrived before the city the walls and the catapults made him hesitate,\r\nand he entered into negotiations, which, as usual, petered out and\r\nbrought him no adequate reward for all his hopes and preparations. In\r\nthe west his arms were more successful, and he subjected most of the\r\neastern part of Serbia to his rule. From all this it can be seen that\r\nhe was no diplomat, though not lacking in enterprise and ambition. The\r\nfact was that while he made his kingdom too powerful for the Greeks to\r\nsubdue (indeed they were compelled to pay him tribute), yet\r\nConstantinople with its impregnable walls, well-organized army,\r\npowerful fleet, and cunning and experienced statesmen, was too hard a\r\nnut for him to crack.\r\n\r\nSimeon extended the boundaries of his country considerably, and his\r\ndominion included most of the interior of the Balkan peninsula south of\r\nthe Danube and east of the rivers Morava and Ibar in Serbia and of the\r\nDrin in Albania. The Byzantine Church greatly increased its influence\r\nin Bulgaria during his reign, and works of theology grew like\r\nmushrooms. This was the only kind of literature that was ever popular\r\nin Bulgaria, and although it is usual to throw contempt on the literary\r\nachievements of Constantinople, we should know but little of Bulgaria\r\nwere it not for the Greek historians.\r\n\r\nSimeon died in 927, and his son Peter, who succeeded him, was a lover\r\nof peace and comfort; he married a Byzantine princess, and during his\r\nreign (927-69) Greek influence grew ever stronger, in spite of several\r\nrevolts on the part of the Bulgar nobles, while the capital Preslav\r\nbecame a miniature Constantinople. In 927 Rome recognized the kingdom\r\nand patriarchate of Bulgaria, and Peter was duly crowned by the Papal\r\nlegate. This was viewed with disfavour by the Greeks, and they still\r\ncalled Peter only _archōn_ or prince (_knyaz_ in Bulgarian), which was\r\nthe utmost title allowed to any foreign sovereign. It was not until 945\r\nthat they recognized Peter as _basileus_, the unique title possessed by\r\ntheir own emperors and till then never granted to any one else. Peter’s\r\nreign was one of misfortune for his country both at home and abroad. In\r\n931 the Serbs broke loose under their leader Časlav, whom Simeon had\r\ncaptured but who effected his escape, and asserted their independence.\r\nIn 963 a formidable revolt under one Shishman undermined the whole\r\nstate fabric. He managed to subtract Macedonia and all western\r\nBulgaria, including Sofia and Vidin, from Peter’s rule, and proclaimed\r\nhimself independent _tsar (tsar_ or _caesar_ was a title often accorded\r\nby Byzantium to relatives of the emperor or to distinguished men of\r\nGreek or other nationality, and though it was originally the equivalent\r\nof the highest title, it had long since ceased to be so: the emperor’s\r\ndesignations were _basileus_ and _autocratōr_). From this time there\r\nwere two Bulgarias—eastern and western. The eastern half was now little\r\nmore than a Byzantine province, and the western became the centre of\r\nnational life and the focus of national aspirations.\r\n\r\nAnother factor which militated against the internal progress of\r\nBulgaria was the spread of the Bogomil heresy in the tenth century.\r\nThis remarkable doctrine, founded on the dualism of the Paulicians, who\r\nhad become an important political force in the eastern empire, was\r\npreached in the Balkan peninsula by one Jeremiah Bogomil, for the rest\r\na man of uncertain identity, who made Philippopolis the centre of his\r\nactivity. Its principal features were of a negative character, and\r\nconsequently it was very difficult successfully to apply force against\r\nthem. The Bogomils recognized the authority neither of Church nor of\r\nState; the validity neither of oaths nor of human laws. They refused to\r\npay taxes, to fight, or to obey; they sanctioned theft, but looked upon\r\nany kind of punishment as unjustifiable; they discountenanced marriage\r\nand were strict vegetarians. Naturally a heresy so alarming in its\r\nindividualism shook to its foundations the not very firmly established\r\nBulgarian society. Nevertheless it spread with rapidity in spite of all\r\npersecutions, and its popularity amongst the Bulgarians, and indeed\r\namongst all the Slavs of the peninsula, is without doubt partly\r\nexplained by political reasons. The hierarchy of the Greek Church,\r\nwhich supported the ruling classes of the country and lent them\r\nauthority at the same time that it increased its own, was antipathetic\r\nto the Slavs, and the Bogomil heresy drew much strength from its\r\nnationalistic colouring and from the appeal which it made to the\r\ncharacter of the Balkan Slavs, who have always been intolerant of\r\ngovernment by the Church. But neither the civil nor the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities were able to cope with the problem; indeed they were apt to\r\nminimize its importance, and the heresy was never eradicated till the\r\narrival on the scene of Islam, which proved as attractive to the\r\nschismatics as the well-regulated Orthodox Church had been the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe third quarter of the tenth century witnessed a great recrudescence\r\nof the power of Constantinople under the Emperor Nikiphóros Phokas, who\r\nwrested Cyprus and Crete from the Arabs and inaugurated an era of\r\nprosperity for the eastern empire, giving it a new lease of vigorous\r\nand combative life. Wishing to reassert the Greek supremacy in the\r\nBalkan peninsula his first act was to refuse any further payment of\r\ntribute to the Bulgarians as from 966; his next was to initiate a\r\ncampaign against them, but in order to make his own success in this\r\nenterprise less costly and more assured he secured the co-operation of\r\nthe Russians under Svyatoslav, Prince of Kiev; this potentate’s mother\r\nOlga had visited Constantinople in 957 and been baptized (though her\r\nson and the bulk of the population were still ardent heathens), and\r\ncommercial intercourse between Russia and Constantinople by means of\r\nthe Dnieper and the Black Sea was at that time lively. Svyatoslav did\r\nnot want pressing, and arriving with an army of 10,000 men in boats,\r\novercame northern Bulgaria in a few days (967); they were helped by\r\nShishman and the western Bulgars, who did not mind at what price Peter\r\nand the eastern Bulgars were crushed. Svyatoslav was recalled to Russia\r\nin 968 to defend his home from attacks by the Tartar Pechenegs, but\r\nthat done, he made up his mind to return to Bulgaria, lured by its\r\nriches and by the hope of the eventual possession of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Nikiphóros was by now aware of the danger he had\r\nimprudently conjured up, and made a futile alliance with eastern\r\nBulgaria; but in January 969 Peter of Bulgaria died, and in December of\r\nthe same year Nikiphóros was murdered by the ambitious Armenian John\r\nTzimisces,[1] who thereupon became emperor. Svyatoslav, seeing the\r\nfield clear of his enemies, returned in 970, and in March of that year\r\nsacked and occupied Philippopolis. The Emperor John Tzimisces, who was\r\neven abler both as general and as diplomat than his predecessor,\r\nquietly pushed forward his warlike preparations, and did not meet the\r\nRussians till the autumn, when he completely defeated them at\r\nArcadiopolis (the modern Lule-Burgas). The Russians retired north of\r\nthe Balkan range, but the Greeks followed them. John Tzimisces besieged\r\nthem in the capital Preslav, which he stormed, massacring many of the\r\ngarrison, in April 972. Svyatoslav and his remaining troops escaped to\r\nSilistria (the Durostorum of Trajan) on the Danube, where again,\r\nhowever, they were besieged and defeated by the indefatigable emperor.\r\nAt last peace was made in July 972, the Russians being allowed to go\r\nfree on condition of the complete evacuation of Bulgaria and a gift of\r\ncorn; the adventurous Svyatoslav lost his life at the hands of the\r\nPechenegs while making his way back to Kiev. The triumph of the Greeks\r\nwas complete, and it can be imagined that there was not much left of\r\nthe earthenware Bulgaria after the violent collision of these two\r\nmighty iron vessels on the top of it. Eastern Bulgaria (i.e. Moesia and\r\nThrace) ceased to exist, becoming a purely Greek province; John\r\nTzimisces made his triumphal entry into Constantinople, followed by the\r\ntwo sons of Peter of Bulgaria on foot; the elder was deprived of his\r\nregal attributes and created _magistros_, the younger was made a\r\neunuch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: John the Little.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n_The Rise and Fall of ‘Western Bulgaria’ and the Greek Supremacy_,\r\n963–1186\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile western Bulgaria had not been touched, and it was thither\r\nthat the Bulgarian patriarch Damian removed from Silistria after the\r\nvictory of the Greeks, settling first in Sofia and then in Okhrida in\r\nMacedonia, where the apostate Shishman had eventually made his capital.\r\nWestern Bulgaria included Macedonia and parts of Thessaly, Albania,\r\nsouthern and eastern Serbia, and the westernmost parts of modern\r\nBulgaria. It was from this district that numerous anti-Hellenic revolts\r\nwere directed after the death of the Emperor John Tzimisces in 976.\r\nThese culminated during the reign of Samuel (977-1014), one of the sons\r\nof Shishman. He was as capable and energetic, as unscrupulous and\r\ninhuman, as the situation he was called upon to fill demanded. He began\r\nby assassinating all his relations and nobles who resented his desire\r\nto re-establish the absolute monarchy, was recognized as _tsar_ by the\r\nHoly See of Rome in 981, and then began to fight the Greeks, the only\r\npossible occupation for any self-respecting Bulgarian ruler. The\r\nemperor at that time was Basil II (976-1025), who was brave and\r\npatriotic but young and inexperienced. In his early campaigns Samuel\r\ncarried all before him; he reconquered northern Bulgaria in 985,\r\nThessaly in 986, and defeated Basil II near Sofia the same year. Later\r\nhe conquered Albania and the southern parts of Serbia and what is now\r\nMontenegro and Hercegovina. In 996 he threatened Salonika, but first of\r\nall embarked on an expedition against the Peloponnese; here he was\r\nfollowed by the Greek general, who managed to surprise and completely\r\noverwhelm him, he and his son barely escaping with their lives.\r\n\r\nFrom that year (996) his fortune changed; the Greeks reoccupied\r\nnorthern Bulgaria, in 999, and also recovered Thessaly and parts of\r\nMacedonia. The Bulgars were subjected to almost annual attacks on the\r\npart of Basil II; the country was ruined and could not long hold out.\r\nThe final disaster occurred in 1014, when Basil II utterly defeated his\r\ninveterate foe in a pass near Seres in Macedonia. Samuel escaped to\r\nPrilip, but when he beheld the return of 15,000 of his troops who had\r\nbeen captured and blinded by the Greeks he died of syncope. Basil II,\r\nknown as Bulgaroctonus, or Bulgar-killer, went from victory to victory,\r\nand finally occupied the Bulgarian capital of Okhrida in 1016. Western\r\nBulgaria came to an end, as had eastern Bulgaria in 972, the remaining\r\nmembers of the royal family followed the emperor to the Bosphorus to\r\nenjoy comfortable captivity, and the triumph of Constantinople was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nFrom 1018 to 1186 Bulgaria had no existence as an independent state;\r\nBasil II, although cruel, was far from tyrannical in his general\r\ntreatment of the Bulgars, and treated the conquered territory more as a\r\nprotectorate than as a possession. But after his death Greek rule\r\nbecame much more oppressive. The Bulgarian patriarchate (since 972\r\nestablished at Okhrida) was reduced to an archbishopric, and in 1025\r\nthe see was given to a Greek, who lost no time in eliminating the\r\nBulgarian element from positions of importance throughout his diocese.\r\nMany of the nobles were transplanted to Constantinople, where their\r\nopposition was numbed by the bestowal of honours. During the eleventh\r\ncentury the peninsula was invaded frequently by the Tartar Pechenegs\r\nand Kumans, whose aid was invoked both by Greeks and Bulgars; the\r\nresult of these incursions was not always favourable to those who had\r\npromoted them; the barbarians invariably stayed longer and did more\r\ndamage than had been bargained for, and usually left some of their\r\nnumber behind as unwelcome settlers.\r\n\r\nIn this way the ethnological map of the Balkan peninsula became ever\r\nmore variegated. To the Tartar settlers were added colonies of\r\nArmenians and Vlakhs by various emperors. The last touch was given by\r\nthe arrival of the Normans in 1081 and the passage of the crusaders in\r\n1096. The wholesale depredations of the latter naturally made the\r\ninhabitants of the Balkan peninsula anything but sympathetically\r\ndisposed towards their cause. One of the results of all this turmoil\r\nand of the heavy hand of the Greeks was a great increase in the\r\nvitality of the Bogomil heresy already referred to; it became a refuge\r\nfor patriotism and an outlet for its expression. The Emperor Alexis\r\nComnenus instituted a bitter persecution of it, which only led to its\r\ngrowth and rapid propagation westwards into Serbia from its centre\r\nPhilippopolis.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the complete overthrow of the Bulgarian monarchy by the\r\nGreeks was of course that the nation itself was totally lacking in\r\ncohesion and organization, and could only achieve any lasting success\r\nwhen an exceptionally gifted ruler managed to discount the centrifugal\r\ntendencies of the feudal nobles, as Simeon and Samuel had done. Other\r\ndiscouraging factors wore the permeation of the Church and State by\r\nByzantine influence, the lack of a large standing army, the spread of\r\nthe anarchic Bogomil heresy, and the fact that the bulk of the Slav\r\npopulation had no desire for foreign adventure or national\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n_The Rise and Fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire,_ 1186–1258\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1186 to 1258 Bulgaria experienced temporary resuscitation, the\r\nbrevity of which was more than compensated for by the stirring nature\r\nof the events that crowded it. The exactions and oppressions of the\r\nGreeks culminated in a revolt on the part of the Bulgars, which had its\r\ncentre in Tirnovo on the river Yantra in northern Bulgaria—a position\r\nof great natural strength and strategic importance, commanding the\r\noutlets of several of the most important passes over the Balkan range.\r\nThis revolt coincided with the growing weakness of the eastern empire,\r\nwhich, surrounded on all sides by aggressive enemies—Kumans, Saracens,\r\nTurks, and Normans—was sickening for one of the severe illnesses which\r\npreceded its dissolution. The revolt was headed by two brothers who\r\nwere Vlakh or Rumanian shepherds, and was blessed by the archbishop\r\nBasil, who crowned one of them, called John Asen, as _tsar_ in Tirnovo\r\nin 1186. Their first efforts against the Greeks were not successful,\r\nbut securing the support of the Serbs under Stephen Nemanja in 1188 and\r\nof the Crusaders in 1189 they became more so; but there was life in the\r\nGreeks yet, and victory alternated with defeat. John Asen I was\r\nassassinated in 1196 and was succeeded after many internal discords and\r\nmurders by his relative Kaloian or Pretty John. This cruel and\r\nunscrupulous though determined ruler soon made an end of all his\r\nenemies at home, and in eight years achieved such success abroad that\r\nBulgaria almost regained its former proportions. Moreover, he\r\nre-established relations with Rome, to the great discomfiture of the\r\nGreeks, and after some negotiations Pope Innocent III recognized\r\nKaloian as _tsar_ of the Bulgars and Vlakhs (roi de Blaquie et de\r\nBougrie, in the words of Villehardouin), with Basil as primate, and\r\nthey were both duly consecrated and crowned by the papal legate at\r\nTirnovo in 1204. The French, who had just established themselves in\r\nConstantinople during the fourth crusade, imprudently made an enemy of\r\nKaloian instead of a friend, and with the aid of the Tartar Kumans he\r\ndefeated them several times, capturing and brutally murdering Baldwin\r\nI. But in 1207 his career was cut short; he was murdered while\r\nbesieging Salonika by one of his generals who was a friend of his wife.\r\nAfter eleven years of further anarchy he was succeeded by John Asen II.\r\nDuring the reign of this monarch, which lasted from 1218 till 1241,\r\nBulgaria reached the zenith of its power. He was the most enlightened\r\nruler the country had had, and he not only waged war successfully\r\nabroad but also put an end to the internal confusion, restored the\r\npossibility of carrying on agriculture and commerce, and encouraged the\r\nfoundation of numerous schools and monasteries. He maintained the\r\ntradition of his family by making his capital at Tirnovo, which city he\r\nconsiderably embellished and enlarged.\r\n\r\nConstantinople at this time boasted three Greek emperors and one\r\nFrench. The first act of John Asen II was to get rid of one of them,\r\nnamed Theodore, who had proclaimed himself _basileus_ at Okhrida in\r\n1223. Thereupon he annexed the whole of Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly,\r\nand Epirus to his dominions, and made Theodore’s brother Manuel, who\r\nhad married one of his daughters, viceroy, established at Salonika.\r\nAnother of his daughters had married Stephen Vladislav, who was King of\r\nSerbia from 1233-43, and a third married Theodore, son of the Emperor\r\nJohn III, who reigned at Nicaea, in 1235. This daughter, after being\r\nsought in marriage by the French barons at Constantinople as a wife for\r\nthe Emperor Baldwin II, a minor, was then summarily rejected in favour\r\nof the daughter of the King of Jerusalem; this affront rankled in the\r\nmind of John Asen II and threw him into the arms of the Greeks, with\r\nwhom he concluded an alliance in 1234. John Asen II and his ally, the\r\nEmperor John III, were, however, utterly defeated by the French under\r\nthe walls of Constantinople in 1236, and the Bulgarian ruler, who had\r\nno wish to see the Greeks re-established there, began to doubt the\r\nwisdom of his alliance. Other Bulgarian tsars had been unscrupulous,\r\nbut the whole foreign policy of this one pivoted on treachery. He\r\ndeserted the Greeks and made an alliance with the French in 1237, the\r\nPope Gregory IX, a great Hellenophobe, having threatened him with\r\nexcommunication; he went so far as to force his daughter to relinquish\r\nher Greek husband. The following year, however, he again changed over\r\nto the Greeks; then again fear of the Pope and of his brother-in-law\r\nthe King of Hungary brought him back to the side of Baldwin II, to\r\nwhose help against the Greeks he went with a large army into Thrace in\r\n1239. While besieging the Greeks with indifferent success, he learned\r\nof the death of his wife and his eldest son from plague, and\r\nincontinently returned to Tirnovo, giving up the war and restoring his\r\ndaughter to her lonely husband. This adaptable monarch died a natural\r\ndeath in 1241, and the three rulers of his family who succeeded him,\r\nwhose reigns filled the period 1241-58, managed to undo all the\r\nconstructive work of their immediate predecessors. Province after\r\nprovince was lost and internal anarchy increased. This remarkable\r\ndynasty came to an inglorious end in 1258, when its last representative\r\nwas murdered by his own nobles, and from this time onwards Bulgaria was\r\nonly a shadow of its former self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n_The Serbian Supremacy and the Final Collapse,_ 1258–1393\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1258 onwards Bulgaria may be said to have continued flickering\r\nuntil its final extinction as a state in 1393, but during this period\r\nit never had any voice in controlling the destinies of the Balkan\r\npeninsula. Owing to the fact that no ruler emerged capable of keeping\r\nthe distracted country in order, there was a regular _chassé-croisé_ of\r\nrival princelets, an unceasing tale of political marriages and murders,\r\nconspiracies and revolts of feudal nobles all over the country, and\r\nperpetual ebb and flow of the boundaries of the warring principalities\r\nwhich tore the fabric of Bulgaria to pieces amongst them. From the\r\npoint of view of foreign politics this period is characterized\r\ngenerally by the virtual disappearance of Bulgarian independence to the\r\nprofit of the surrounding states, who enjoyed a sort of rotativist\r\nsupremacy. It is especially remarkable for the complete ascendancy\r\nwhich Serbia gained in the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nA Serb, Constantine, grandson of Stephen Nemanja, occupied the\r\nBulgarian throne from 1258 to 1277, and married the granddaughter of\r\nJohn Asen II. After the fall of the Latin Empire of Constantinople in\r\n1261, the Hungarians, already masters of Transylvania, combined with\r\nthe Greeks against Constantine; the latter called the Tartars of\r\nsouthern Russia, at this time at the height of their power, to his help\r\nand was victorious, but as a result of his diplomacy the Tartars\r\nhenceforward played an important part in the Bulgarian welter. Then\r\nConstantine married, as his second wife, the daughter of the Greek\r\nemperor, and thus again gave Constantinople a voice in his country’s\r\naffairs. Constantine was followed by a series of upstart rulers, whose\r\nactivities were cut short by the victories of King Uroš II of Serbia\r\n(1282-1321), who conquered all Macedonia and wrested it from the\r\nBulgars. In 1285 the Tartars of the Golden Horde swept over Hungary and\r\nBulgaria, but it was from the south that the clouds were rolling up\r\nwhich not much later were to burst over the peninsula. In 1308 the\r\nTurks appeared on the Sea of Marmora, and in 1326 established\r\nthemselves at Brussa. From 1295 to 1322 Bulgaria was presided over by a\r\nnobleman of Vidin, Svetoslav, who, unmolested by the Greeks, grown\r\nthoughtful in view of the approach of the Turks, was able to maintain\r\nrather more order than his subjects were accustomed to. After his death\r\nin 1322 chaos again supervened. One of his successors had married the\r\ndaughter of Uroš II of Serbia, but suddenly made an alliance with the\r\nGreeks against his brother-in-law Stephen Uroš III and dispatched his\r\nwife to her home. During the war which ensued the unwonted allies were\r\nutterly routed by the Serbs at Kustendil in Macedonia in 1330.\r\n\r\nFrom 1331 to 1365 Bulgaria was under one John Alexander, a noble of\r\nTartar origin, whose sister became the wife of Serbia’s greatest ruler,\r\nStephen Dušan; John Alexander, moreover, recognized Stephen as his\r\nsuzerain, and from thenceforward Bulgaria was a vassal-state of Serbia.\r\nMeanwhile the Turkish storm was gathering fast; Suleiman crossed the\r\nHellespont in 1356, and Murad I made Adrianople his capital in 1366.\r\nAfter the death of John Alexander in 1365 the Hungarians invaded\r\nnorthern Bulgaria, and his successor invoked the help of the Turks\r\nagainst them and also against the Greeks. This was the beginning of the\r\nend. The Serbs, during an absence of the Sultan in Asia, undertook an\r\noffensive, but were defeated by the Turks near Adrianople in 1371, who\r\ncaptured Sofia in 1382. After this the Serbs formed a huge southern\r\nSlav alliance, in which the Bulgarians refused to join, but, after a\r\ntemporary success against the Turks in 1387, they were vanquished by\r\nthem as the result of treachery at the famous battle of Kosovo in 1389.\r\nMeanwhile the Turks occupied Nikopolis on the Danube in 1388 and\r\ndestroyed the Bulgarian capital Tirnovo in 1393, exiling the Patriarch\r\nEuthymus to Macedonia. Thus the state of Bulgaria passed into the hands\r\nof the Turks, and its church into those of the Greeks. Many Bulgars\r\nadopted Islam, and their descendants are the Pomaks or Bulgarian\r\nMohammedans of the present day. With the subjection of Rumania in 1394\r\nand the defeat of an improvised anti-Turkish crusade from western\r\nEurope under Sigismund, King of Hungary, at Nikopolis in 1396 the\r\nTurkish conquest was complete, though the battle of Varna was not\r\nfought till 1444, nor Constantinople entered till 1453.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n_The Turkish Dominion and the Emancipation,_ 1393–1878\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1393 until 1877 Bulgaria may truthfully be said to have had no\r\nhistory, but nevertheless it could scarcely have been called happy.\r\nNational life was completely paralysed, and what stood in those days\r\nfor national consciousness was obliterated. It is common knowledge, and\r\nmost people are now reasonable enough to admit, that the Turks have\r\nmany excellent qualities, religious fervour and military ardour amongst\r\nothers; it is also undeniable that from an aesthetic point of view too\r\nmuch cannot be said in praise of Mohammedan civilization. Who does not\r\nprefer the minarets of Stambul and Edirne[1] to the architecture of\r\nBudapest, notoriously the ideal of Christian south-eastern Europe? On\r\nthe other hand, it cannot be contended that the Pax Ottomana brought\r\nprosperity or happiness to those on whom it was imposed (unless indeed\r\nthey submerged their identity in the religion of their conquerors), or\r\nthat its Influence was either vivifying or generally popular.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Turkish names for Constantinople and Adrianople.]\r\n\r\nTo the races they conquered the Turks offered two alternatives—serfdom\r\nor Turkdom; those who could not bring themselves to accept either of\r\nthese had either to emigrate or take to brigandage and outlawry in the\r\nmountains. The Turks literally overlaid the European nationalities of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula for five hundred years, and from their own point\r\nof view and from that of military history this was undoubtedly a very\r\nsplendid achievement; it was more than the Greeks or Romans had ever\r\ndone. From the point of view of humanitarianism also it is beyond a\r\ndoubt that much less human blood was spilt in the Balkan peninsula\r\nduring the five hundred years of Turkish rule than during the five\r\nhundred years of Christian rule which preceded them; indeed it would\r\nhave been difficult to spill more. It is also a pure illusion to think\r\nof the Turks as exceptionally brutal or cruel; they are just as\r\ngood-natured and good-humoured as anybody else; it is only when their\r\nmilitary or religious passions are aroused that they become more\r\nreckless and ferocious than other people. It was not the Turks who\r\ntaught cruelty to the Christians of the Balkan peninsula; the latter\r\nhad nothing to learn in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, however, from the point of view of the Slavs of\r\nBulgaria and Serbia, Turkish rule was synonymous with suffocation. If\r\nthe Turks were all that their greatest admirers think them the history\r\nof the Balkan peninsula in the nineteenth century would have been very\r\ndifferent from what it has been, namely, one perpetual series of\r\nanti-Turkish revolts.\r\n\r\nOf all the Balkan peoples the Bulgarians were the most completely\r\ncrushed and effaced. The Greeks by their ubiquity, their brains, and\r\ntheir money were soon able to make the Turkish storm drive their own\r\nwindmill; the Rumanians were somewhat sheltered by the Danube and also\r\nby their distance from Constantinople; the Serbs also were not so\r\nexposed to the full blast of the Turkish wrath, and the inaccessibility\r\nof much of their country afforded them some protection. Bulgaria was\r\nsimply annihilated, and its population, already far from homogeneous,\r\nwas still further varied by numerous Turkish and other Tartar colonies.\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons already mentioned Bulgaria was the last Balkan\r\nstate to emancipate itself; for these reasons also it is the least\r\ntrammelled by prejudices and by what are considered national\r\npredilections and racial affinities, while its heterogeneous\r\ncomposition makes it vigorous and enterprising. The treatment of the\r\nChristians by the Turks was by no means always the same; generally\r\nspeaking, it grew worse as the power of the Sultan grew less. During\r\nthe fifteenth century they were allowed to practise their religion and\r\nall their vocations in comparative liberty and peace. But from the\r\nsixteenth century onwards the control of the Sultan declined, power\r\nbecame decentralized, the Ottoman Empire grew ever more anarchic and\r\nthe rule of the provincial governors more despotic.\r\n\r\nBut the Mohammedan conquerors were not the only enemies and oppressors\r\nof the Bulgars. The rôle played by the Greeks in Bulgaria during the\r\nTurkish dominion was almost as important as that of the Turks\r\nthemselves. The contempt of the Turks for the Christians, and\r\nespecially for their religion, was so great that they prudently left\r\nthe management of it to them, knowing that it would keep them occupied\r\nin mutual altercation. From 1393 till 1767 the Bulgarians were under\r\nthe Greco-Bulgarian Patriarchate of Okhrida, an organization in which\r\nall posts, from the highest to the lowest, had to be bought from the\r\nTurkish administration at exorbitant and ever-rising prices; the\r\nPhanariote Greeks (so called because they originated in the Phanar\r\nquarter at Constantinople) were the only ones who could afford those of\r\nthe higher posts, with the result that the Church was controlled from\r\nConstantinople. In 1767 the independent patriarchates were abolished,\r\nand from that date the religious control of the Greeks was as complete\r\nas the political control of the Turks. The Greeks did all they could to\r\nobliterate the last traces of Bulgarian nationality which had survived\r\nin the Church, and this explains a fact which must never be forgotten,\r\nwhich had its origin in the remote past, but grew more pronounced at\r\nthis period, that the individual hatred of Greeks and Bulgars of each\r\nother has always been far more intense than their collective hatred of\r\nthe Turks.\r\n\r\nEver since the marriage of the Tsar Ivan III with the niece of the last\r\nGreek Emperor, in 1472, Russia had considered itself the trustee of the\r\neastern Christians, the defender of the Orthodox Church, and the direct\r\nheir of the glory and prestige of Constantinople; it was not until the\r\neighteenth century, however, after the consolidation of the Russian\r\nstate, that the Balkan Christians were championed and the eventual\r\npossession of Constantinople was seriously considered. Russian\r\ninfluence was first asserted in Rumania after the Treaty of\r\nKuchuk-Kainardji, in 1774. It was only the Napoleonic war in 1812 that\r\nprevented the Russians from extending their territory south of the\r\nDanube, whither it already stretched. Serbia was partially free by\r\n1826, and Greece achieved complete independence in 1830, when the\r\nRussian troops, in order to coerce the Turks, occupied part of Bulgaria\r\nand advanced as far as Adrianople. Bulgaria, being nearer to and more\r\neasily repressed by Constantinople, had to wait, and tentative revolts\r\nmade about this time were put down with much bloodshed and were\r\nfollowed by wholesale emigrations of Bulgars into Bessarabia and\r\nimportations of Tartars and Kurds into the vacated districts. The\r\nCrimean War and the short-sighted championship of Turkey by the western\r\nEuropean powers checked considerably the development at which Russia\r\naimed. Moldavia and Wallachia were in 1856 withdrawn from the\r\nsemi-protectorate which Russia had long exercised over them, and in\r\n1861 formed themselves into the united state of Rumania. In 1866 a\r\nGerman prince, Charles of Hohenzollern, came to rule over the country,\r\nthe first sign of German influence in the Near East; at this time\r\nRumania still acknowledged the supremacy of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century there took place a\r\nconsiderable intellectual renascence in Bulgaria, a movement fostered\r\nby wealthy Bulgarian merchants of Bucarest and Odessa. In 1829 a\r\nhistory of Bulgaria was published by a native of that country in\r\nMoscow; in 1835 the first school was established in Bulgaria, and many\r\nothers soon followed. It must be remembered that not only was nothing\r\nknown at that time about Bulgaria and its inhabitants in other\r\ncountries, but the Bulgars had themselves to be taught who they were.\r\nThe Bulgarian people in Bulgaria consisted entirely of peasants; there\r\nwas no Bulgarian upper or middle or ‘intelligent’ or professional\r\nclass; those enlightened Bulgars who existed were domiciled in other\r\ncountries; the Church was in the hands of the Greeks, who vied with the\r\nTurks in suppressing Bulgarian nationality.\r\n\r\nThe two committees of Odessa and Bucarest which promoted the\r\nenlightenment and emancipation of Bulgaria were dissimilar in\r\ncomposition and in aim; the members of the former were more intent on\r\neducational and religious reform, and aimed at the gradual and peaceful\r\nregeneration of their country by these means; the latter wished to\r\neffect the immediate political emancipation of Bulgaria by violent and,\r\nif necessary, warlike means.\r\n\r\nIt was the ecclesiastical question which was solved first. In 1856 the\r\nPorte had promised religious reforms tending to the appointment of\r\nBulgarian bishops and the recognition of the Bulgarian language in\r\nChurch and school. But these not being carried through, the Bulgarians\r\ntook the matter into their own hands, and in 1860 refused any longer to\r\nrecognize the Patriarch of Constantinople. The same year an attempt was\r\nmade to bring the Church of Bulgaria under that of Rome, but, owing to\r\nRussian opposition, proved abortive. In 1870, the growing agitation\r\nhaving at last alarmed the Turks, the Bulgarian Exarchate was\r\nestablished. The Bulgarian Church was made free and national and was to\r\nbe under an Exarch who should reside at Constantinople (Bulgaria being\r\nstill a Turkish province). The Greeks, conscious what a blow this would\r\nbe to their supremacy, managed for a short while to stave off the evil\r\nday, but in 1872 the Exarch was triumphantly installed in\r\nConstantinople, where he resided till 1908.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile revolutionary outbreaks began to increase, but were always\r\nput down with great rigour. The most notable was that of 1875,\r\ninstigated by Stambulóv, the future dictator, in sympathy with the\r\noutbreak in Montenegro, Hercegovina, and Bosnia of that year; the\r\nresult of this and of similar movements in 1876 was the series of\r\nnotorious Bulgarian massacres in that year. The indignation of Europe\r\nwas aroused and concerted representations were urgently made at\r\nConstantinople. Midhat Pasha disarmed his opponents by summarily\r\nintroducing the British constitution into Turkey, but, needless to say,\r\nBulgaria’s lot was not improved by this specious device. Russia had,\r\nhowever, steadily been making her preparations, and, Turkey having\r\nrefused to discontinue hostilities against Montenegro, on April 24,\r\n1877, war was declared by the Emperor Alexander II, whose patience had\r\nbecome exhausted; he was joined by Prince Charles of Rumania, who saw\r\nthat by doing so he would be rewarded by the complete emancipation of\r\nhis country, then still a vassal-state of Turkey, and its erection into\r\na kingdom. At the beginning of the war all went well for the Russians\r\nand Rumanians, who were soon joined by large numbers of Bulgarian\r\ninsurgents; the Turkish forces were scattered all over the peninsula.\r\nThe committee of Bucarest transformed itself into a provisional\r\ngovernment, but the Russians, who had undertaken to liberate the\r\ncountry, naturally had to keep its administration temporarily in their\r\nown hands, and refused their recognition. The Turks, alarmed at the\r\nearly victories of the Russians, brought up better generals and troops,\r\nand defeated the Russians at Plevna in July. They failed, however, to\r\ndislodge them from the important and famous Shipka Pass in August, and\r\nafter this they became demoralized and their resistance rapidly\r\nweakened. The Russians, helped by the Bulgarians and Rumanians, fought\r\nthroughout the summer with the greatest gallantry; they took Plevna,\r\nafter a three months’ siege, in December, occupied Sofia and\r\nPhilippopolis in January 1878, and pushed forward to the walls of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were at their last gasp, and at Adrianople, in March 1878,\r\nIgnatiyev dictated the terms of the Treaty of San Stefano, by which a\r\nprincipality of Bulgaria, under the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan,\r\nwas created, stretching from the Danube to the Aegean, and from the\r\nBlack Sea to Albania, including all Macedonia and leaving to the Turks\r\nonly the district between Constantinople and Adrianople, Chalcidice,\r\nand the town of Salonika; Bulgaria would thus have regained the\r\ndimensions it possessed under Tsar Simeon nine hundred and fifty years\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nThis treaty, which on ethnological grounds was tolerably just, alarmed\r\nthe other powers, especially Great Britain and Germany, who thought\r\nthey perceived in it the foundations of Russian hegemony in the\r\nBalkans, while it would, if put into execution, have blighted the\r\naspirations of Greece and Serbia. The Treaty of Berlin, inspired by\r\nBismarck and Lord Salisbury, anxious to defend, the former, the\r\ninterests of (ostensibly) Austria-Hungary, the latter (shortsightedly)\r\nthose of Turkey, replaced it in July 1878. By its terms Bulgaria was\r\ncut into three parts; northern Bulgaria, between the Danube and the\r\nBalkans, was made an autonomous province, tributary to Turkey; southern\r\nBulgaria, fancifully termed Eastern Rumelia (Rumili was the name always\r\ngiven by the Turks to the whole Balkan peninsula), was to have\r\nautonomous administration under a Christian governor appointed by the\r\nPorte; Macedonia was left to Turkey; and the Dobrudja, between the\r\nDanube and the Black Sea, was adjudged to Rumania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n_The Aftermath, and Prince Alexander of Battenberg, 1878–86_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Russians and the Bulgarians were better\r\nbefore the liberation of the latter by the former than after; this may\r\nseem unjust, because Bulgaria could never have freed herself so\r\ndecisively and rapidly alone, and Russia was the only power in whose\r\ninterest it was to free her from the Turks, and who could translate\r\nthat interest so promptly into action; nevertheless, the laws\r\ncontrolling the relationships of states and nationalities being much\r\nthe same as those which control the relationships of individuals, it\r\nwas only to be expected.\r\n\r\nWhat so often happens in the relationships of individuals happened in\r\nthose between Russia and Bulgaria. Russia naturally enough expected\r\nBulgaria to be grateful for the really large amount of blood and\r\ntreasure which its liberation had cost Russia, and, moreover, expected\r\nits gratitude to take the form of docility and a general acquiescence\r\nin all the suggestions and wishes expressed by its liberator. Bulgaria\r\nwas no doubt deeply grateful, but never had the slightest intention of\r\nexpressing its gratitude in the desired way; on the contrary, like most\r\npeople who have regained a long-lost and unaccustomed freedom of action\r\nor been put under an obligation, it appeared touchy and jealous of its\r\nright to an independent judgement. It is often assumed by Russophobe\r\nwriters that Russia wished and intended to make a Russian province of\r\nBulgaria, but this is very unlikely; the geographical configuration of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula would not lend itself to its incorporation in the\r\nRussian Empire, the existence between the two of the compact and\r\nvigorous national block of Rumania, a Latin race and then already an\r\nindependent state, was an insurmountable obstacle, and, finally, it is\r\nquite possible for Russia to obtain possession or control of\r\nConstantinople without owning all the intervening littoral.\r\n\r\nThat Russia should wish to have a controlling voice in the destinies of\r\nBulgaria and in those of the whole peninsula was natural, and it was\r\njust as natural that Bulgaria should resent its pretensions. The\r\neventual result of this, however, was that Bulgaria inevitably entered\r\nthe sphere of Austrian and ultimately of German influence or rather\r\ncalculation, a contingency probably not foreseen by its statesmen at\r\nthe time, and whose full meaning, even if it had, would not have been\r\ngrasped by them.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians, whatever the origin and the ingredients of their\r\nnationality, are by language a purely Slavonic people; their ancestors\r\nwere the pioneers of Slavonic civilization as expressed in its\r\nmonuments of theological literature. Nevertheless, they have never been\r\nenthusiastic Pan-Slavists, any more than the Dutch have ever been\r\nardent Pan-Germans; it is as unreasonable to expect such a thing of the\r\none people as it is of the other. The Bulgarians indeed think\r\nthemselves superior to the Slavs by reason of the warlike and glorious\r\ntraditions of the Tartar tribe that gave them their name and infused\r\nthe Asiatic element into their race, thus endowing them with greater\r\nstability, energy, and consistency than is possessed by purely Slav\r\npeoples. These latter, on the other hand, and notably the Serbians, for\r\nthe same reason affect contempt for the mixture of blood and for what\r\nthey consider the Mongol characteristics of the Bulgarians. What is\r\ncertain is that between Bulgarians and Germans (including German\r\nAustrians and Magyars) there has never existed that elemental,\r\nineradicable, and insurmountable antipathy which exists between German\r\n(and Magyar) and Slav wherever the two races are contiguous, from the\r\nBaltic to the Adriatic; nothing is more remarkable than the way in\r\nwhich the Bulgarian people has been flattered, studied, and courted in\r\nAustria-Hungary and Germany, during the last decade, to the detriment\r\nof the purely Slav Serb race with whom it is always compared. The\r\nreason is that with the growth of the Serb national movement, from 1903\r\nonwards, Austria-Hungary and Germany felt an instinctive and perfectly\r\nwell-justified fear of the Serb race, and sought to neutralize the\r\npossible effect of its growing power by any possible means.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say, in summing up, that Russian influence, which\r\nhad been growing stronger in Bulgaria up till 1877-8, has since been\r\nsteadily on the decline; Germany and Austria-Hungary, who reduced\r\nBulgaria to half the size that Count Ignatiyev had made it by the\r\nTreaty of San Stefano, reaped the benefit, especially the commercial\r\nbenefit, of the war which Russia had waged. Intellectually, and\r\nespecially as regards the replenishment and renovation of the Bulgarian\r\nlanguage, which, in spite of numerous Turkish words introduced during\r\nthe Ottoman rule, is essentially Slavonic both in substance and form,\r\nRussian influence was especially powerful, and has to a certain extent\r\nmaintained itself. Economically, owing partly to geographical\r\nconditions, both the Danube and the main oriental railway linking\r\nBulgaria directly with Budapest and Vienna, partly to the fact that\r\nBulgaria’s best customers for its cereals are in central and western\r\nEurope, the connexion between Bulgaria and Russia is infinitesimal.\r\nPolitically, both Russia and Bulgaria aiming at the same thing, the\r\npossession of Constantinople and the hegemony of the Balkan peninsula,\r\ntheir relations were bound to be difficult.\r\n\r\nThe first Bulgarian Parliament met in 1879 under trying conditions.\r\nBoth Russian and Bulgarian hopes had been dashed by the Treaty of\r\nBerlin. Russian influence was still paramount, however, and the viceroy\r\ncontrolled the organization of the administration. An ultra-democratic\r\nconstitution was arranged for, a fact obviously not conducive to the\r\nsuccessful government of their country by the quite inexperienced\r\nBulgarians. For a ruler recourse had inevitably to be had to the\r\nrabbit-warren of Germanic princes, who were still ingenuously\r\nconsidered neutral both in religion and in politics. The choice fell on\r\nPrince Alexander of Battenberg, nephew of the Empress of Russia, who\r\nhad taken part in the campaign of the Russian army. Prince Alexander\r\nwas conscientious, energetic, and enthusiastic, but he was no diplomat,\r\nand from the outset his honesty precluded his success. From the very\r\nfirst he failed to keep on good terms with Russia or its\r\nrepresentatives, who at that time were still numerous in Bulgaria,\r\nwhile he was helpless to stem the ravages of parliamentary government.\r\nThe Emperor Alexander III, who succeeded his father Alexander II in\r\n1881, recommended him to insist on being made dictator, which he\r\nsuccessfully did. But when he found that this only meant an increase of\r\nRussian influence he reverted to parliamentary government (in September\r\n1883); this procedure discomfited the representatives of Russia,\r\ndiscredited him with the Emperor, and threw him back into the vortex of\r\nparty warfare, from which he never extricated himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the question of eastern Rumelia, or rather southern Bulgaria,\r\nstill a Turkish province, began to loom. A vigorous agitation for the\r\nreunion of the two parts of the country had been going on for some\r\ntime, and on September 18, 1885, the inhabitants of Philippopolis\r\nsuddenly proclaimed the union under Prince Alexander, who solemnly\r\nannounced his approval at Tirnovo and triumphantly entered their city\r\non September 21. Russia frowned on this independence of spirit. Serbia,\r\nunder King Milan, and instigated by Austria, inaugurated the policy\r\nwhich has so often been followed since, and claimed territorial\r\ncompensation for Bulgaria’s aggrandisement; it must be remembered that\r\nit was Bismarck who, by the Treaty of Berlin, had arbitrarily confined\r\nSerbia to its inadequate limits of those day.\r\n\r\nOn November 13 King Milan declared war, and began to march on Sofia,\r\nwhich is not far from the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier. Prince Alexander,\r\nthe bulk of whose army was on the Turkish frontier, boldly took up the\r\nchallenge. On November 18 took place the battle of Slivnitsa, a small\r\ntown about twenty miles north-west of Sofia, in which the Bulgarians\r\nwere completely victorious. Prince Alexander, after hard fighting, took\r\nPirot in Serbia on November 27, having refused King Milan’s request for\r\nan armistice, and was marching on Nish, when Austria intervened, and\r\nthreatened to send troops into Serbia unless fighting ceased. Bulgaria\r\nhad to obey, and on March 3, 1886, a barren treaty of peace was imposed\r\non the belligerents at Bucarest. Prince Alexander’s position did not\r\nimprove after this, indeed it would have needed a much more skilful\r\nnavigator to steer through the many currents which eddied round him. A\r\nstrong Russophile party formed itself in the army; on the night of\r\nAugust 21, 1886, some officers of this party, who were the most capable\r\nin the Bulgarian army, appeared at Sofia, forced Alexander to resign,\r\nand abducted him; they put him on board his yacht on the Danube and\r\nescorted him to the Russian town of Reni, in Bessarabia; telegraphic\r\norders came from St. Petersburg, in answer to inquiries, that he could\r\nproceed with haste to western Europe, and on August 26 he found himself\r\nat Lemberg. But those who had carried out this _coup d’état_ found that\r\nit was not at all popular in the country. A counter-revolution, headed\r\nby the statesman Stambulóv, was immediately initiated, and on September\r\n3 Prince Alexander reappeared in Sofia amidst tumultuous applause.\r\nNevertheless his position was hopeless; the Emperor Alexander III\r\nforced him to abdicate, and on September 7, 1886, he left Bulgaria for\r\ngood, to the regret of the majority of the people. He died in Austria,\r\nin 1893, in his thirty-seventh year. At his departure a regency was\r\nconstituted, at the head of which was Stambulóv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n_The Regeneration under Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg,_ 1886–1908\r\n\r\n\r\nStambulóv was born at Tirnovo in 1854 and was of humble origin. He took\r\npart in the insurrection of 1876 and in the war of liberation, and in\r\n1884 became president of the Sóbraniye (Parliament). From 1886 till\r\n1894 he was virtually dictator of Bulgaria. He was intensely patriotic\r\nand also personally ambitious, determined, energetic, ruthlessly cruel\r\nand unscrupulous, but incapable of deceit; these qualities were\r\napparent in his powerful and grim expression of face, while his manner\r\ninspired the weak with terror and the strongest with respect. His\r\npolicy in general was directed against Russia. At the general election\r\nheld in October 1886 he had all his important opponents imprisoned\r\nbeforehand, while armed sentries discouraged ill-disposed voters from\r\napproaching the ballot-boxes. Out of 522 elected deputies, there were\r\n470 supporters of Stambulóv. This implied the complete suppression of\r\nthe Russophile party and led to a rupture with St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nWhatever were Stambulóv’s methods, and few would deny that they were\r\nharsh, there is no doubt that something of the sort was necessary to\r\nrestore order in the country. But once having started on this path he\r\nfound it difficult to stop, and his tyrannical bearing, combined with\r\nthe delay in finding a prince, soon made him unpopular. There were\r\nseveral revolutionary outbreaks directed against him, but these were\r\nall crushed. At length the, at that time not particularly alluring,\r\nthrone of Bulgaria was filled by Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, who\r\nwas born in 1861 and was the son of the gifted Princess Clémentine of\r\nBourbon-Orleans, daughter of Louis-Philippe. This young man combined\r\ngreat ambition and tenacity of purpose with extreme prudence,\r\nastuteness, and patience; he was a consummate diplomat. The election of\r\nthis prince was viewed with great disfavour by Russia, and for fear of\r\noffending the Emperor Alexander III none of the European powers\r\nrecognized him.\r\n\r\nFerdinand, unabashed, cheerfully installed himself in Sofia with his\r\nmother in July 1886, and took care to make the peace with his suzerain,\r\nthe Sultan Abdul Hamid. He wisely left all power in the hands of the\r\nunattractive and to him, unsympathetic prime minister, Stambulóv, till\r\nhe himself felt secure in his position, and till the dictator should\r\nhave made himself thoroughly hated. Ferdinand’s clever and wealthy\r\nmother cast a beneficent and civilizing glow around him, smoothing away\r\nmany difficulties by her womanly tact and philanthropic activity, and,\r\nthanks to his influential connexions in the courts of Europe and his\r\nattitude of calm expectancy, his prestige in his own country rapidly\r\nincreased. In 1893 he married Princess Marie-Louise of Bourbon-Parma.\r\nIn May 1894, as a result of a social misadventure in which he became\r\ninvolved, Stambulóv sent in his resignation, confidently expecting a\r\nrefusal. To his mortification it was accepted; thereupon he initiated a\r\nviolent press campaign, but his halo had faded, and on July 15 he was\r\nsavagely attacked in the street by unknown men, who afterwards escaped,\r\nand he died three days later. So intense were the emotions of the\r\npeople that his grave had to be guarded by the military for two months.\r\nIn November 1894 followed the death of the Emperor Alexander III, and\r\nas a result of this double event the road to a reconciliation with\r\nRussia was opened. Meanwhile the German Emperor, who was on good terms\r\nwith Princess Clémentine, had paved the way for Ferdinand at Vienna,\r\nand when, in March 1896, the Sultan recognized him as Prince of\r\nBulgaria and Governor-General of eastern Rumelia, his international\r\nposition was assured. Relations with Russia were still further improved\r\nby the rebaptism of the infant Crown Prince Boris according to the\r\nrites of the eastern Church, in February 1896, and a couple of years\r\nlater Ferdinand and his wife and child paid a highly successful state\r\nvisit to Peterhof. In September 1902 a memorial church was erected by\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas II at the Shipka Pass, and later an equestrian\r\nstatue of the Tsar-Liberator Alexander II was placed opposite the House\r\nof Parliament in Sofia.\r\n\r\nBulgaria meanwhile had been making rapid and astonishing material\r\nprogress. Railways were built, exports increased, and the general\r\ncondition of the country greatly improved. It is the fashion to compare\r\nthe wonderful advance made by Bulgaria during the thirty-five years of\r\nits new existence with the very much slower progress made by Serbia\r\nduring a much longer period. This is insisted on especially by\r\npublicists in Austria-Hungary and Germany, but it is forgotten that\r\neven before the last Balkan war the geographical position of Bulgaria\r\nwith its seaboard was much more favourable to its economic development\r\nthan that of Serbia, which the Treaty of Berlin had hemmed in by\r\nTurkish and Austro-Hungarian territory; moreover, Bulgaria being double\r\nthe size of the Serbia of those days, had far greater resources upon\r\nwhich to draw.\r\n\r\nFrom 1894 onwards Ferdinand’s power in his own country and his\r\ninfluence abroad had been steadily growing. He always appreciated the\r\nvalue of railways, and became almost as great a traveller as the German\r\nEmperor. His estates in the south of Hungary constantly required his\r\nattention, and he was a frequent visitor in Vienna. The German Emperor,\r\nthough he could not help admiring Ferdinand’s success, was always a\r\nlittle afraid of him; he felt that Ferdinand’s gifts were so similar to\r\nhis own that he would be unable to count on him in an emergency.\r\nMoreover, it was difficult to reconcile Ferdinand’s ambitions in\r\nextreme south-eastern Europe with his own. Ferdinand’s relations with\r\nVienna, on the other hand, and especially with the late Archduke\r\nFrancis Ferdinand, were both cordial and intimate.\r\n\r\nThe gradual aggravation of the condition of the Turkish Empire, notably\r\nin Macedonia, the unredeemed Bulgaria, where since the insurrection of\r\n1902-3 anarchy, always endemic, had deteriorated into a reign of\r\nterror, and, also the unmistakably growing power and spirit of Serbia\r\nsince the accession of the Karageorgevich dynasty in 1903, caused\r\nuneasiness in Sofia, no less than in Vienna and Budapest. The Young\r\nTurkish revolution of July 1908, and the triumph of the Committee of\r\nUnion and Progress, disarmed the critics of Turkey who wished to make\r\nthe forcible introduction of reforms a pretext for their interference;\r\nbut the potential rejuvenation of the Ottoman Empire which it\r\nforeshadowed indicated the desirability of rapid and decisive action.\r\nIn September, after fomenting a strike on the Oriental Railway in\r\neastern Roumelia (which railway was Turkish property), the Sofia\r\nCabinet seized the line with a military force on the plea of political\r\nnecessity. At the same time Ferdinand, with his second wife, the\r\nProtestant Princess Eleonora of Reuss, whom he had married in March of\r\nthat year, was received with regal honours by the Emperor of Austria at\r\nBudapest. On October 5, 1908, at Tirnovo, the ancient capital,\r\nFerdinand proclaimed the complete independence of Bulgaria and eastern\r\nRumelia under himself as King (_Tsar_ in Bulgarian), and on October 7\r\nAustria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, the\r\ntwo Turkish provinces administered by it since 1879, nominally under\r\nTurkish suzerainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n_The Kingdom_, 1908–13\r\n\r\n\r\n(cf. Chaps. 14, 20)\r\n\r\nThe events which have taken place in Bulgaria since 1908 hinge on the\r\nMacedonian question, which has not till now been mentioned. The\r\nMacedonian question was extremely complicated; it started on the\r\nassumption that the disintegration of Turkey, which had been proceeding\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century, would eventually be completed, and\r\nthe question was how in this eventuality to satisfy the territorial\r\nclaims of the three neighbouring countries, Bulgaria, Serbia, and\r\nGreece, claims both historical and ethnological, based on the numbers\r\nand distribution of their ‘unredeemed’ compatriots in Macedonia, and at\r\nthe same time avoid causing the armed interference of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the Macedonian question in its modern form do not go\r\nfarther back than 1885, when the ease with which eastern Rumelia (i.e.\r\nsouthern Bulgaria) threw off the Turkish yoke and was spontaneously\r\nunited with the semi-independent principality of northern Bulgaria\r\naffected the imagination of the Balkan statesmen. From that time Sofia\r\nbegan to cast longing eyes on Macedonia, the whole of which was claimed\r\nas ‘unredeemed Bulgaria’, and Stambulóv’s last success in 1894 was to\r\nobtain from Turkey the consent to the establishment of two bishops of\r\nthe Bulgarian (Exarchist) Church in Macedonia, which was a heavy blow\r\nfor the Greek Patriarchate at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nMacedonia had been envisaged by the Treaty of Berlin, article 23 of\r\nwhich stipulated for reforms in that province; but in those days the\r\nBalkan States were too young and weak to worry themselves or the\r\nEuropean powers over the troubles of their co-religionists in Turkey;\r\ntheir hands were more than full setting their own houses in some sort\r\nof order, and it was in nobody’s interest to reform Macedonia, so\r\narticle 23 remained the expression of a philanthropic sentiment. This\r\nindifference on the part of Europe left the door open for the Balkan\r\nStates, as soon as they had energy to spare, to initiate their campaign\r\nfor extending their spheres of influence in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nFrom 1894 onwards Bulgarian propaganda in Macedonia increased, and the\r\nBulgarians were soon followed by Greeks and Serbians. The reason for\r\nthis passionate pegging out of claims and the bitter rivalry of the\r\nthree nations which it engendered was the following: The population of\r\nMacedonia was nowhere, except in the immediate vicinity of the borders\r\nof these three countries, either purely Bulgar or purely Greek or\r\npurely Serb; most of the towns contained a percentage of at least two\r\nof these nationalities, not to mention the Turks (who after all were\r\nstill the owners of the country by right of conquest), Albanians,\r\nTartars, Rumanians (Vlakhs), and others; the city of Salonika was and\r\nis almost purely Jewish, while in the country districts Turkish,\r\nAlbanian, Greek, Bulgar, and Serb villages were inextricably confused.\r\nGenerally speaking, the coastal strip was mainly Greek (the coast\r\nitself purely so), the interior mainly Slav. The problem was for each\r\ncountry to peg out as large a claim as possible, and so effectively, by\r\nany means in their power, to make the majority of the population\r\ncontained in that claim acknowledge itself to be Bulgar, or Serb, or\r\nGreek, that when the agony of the Ottoman Empire was over, each part of\r\nMacedonia would automatically fall into the arms of its respective\r\ndeliverers. The game was played through the appropriate media of\r\nchurches and schools, for the unfortunate Macedonian peasants had first\r\nof all to be enlightened as to who they were, or rather as to who they\r\nwere told they had got to consider themselves, while the Church, as\r\nalways, conveniently covered a multitude of political aims; when those\r\nmethods flagged, a bomb would be thrown at, let us say, a Turkish\r\nofficial by an _agent provocateur_ of one of the three players,\r\ninevitably resulting in the necessary massacre of innocent Christians\r\nby the ostensibly brutal but really equally innocent Turks, and an\r\noutcry in the European press.\r\n\r\nBulgaria was first in the field and had a considerable start of the\r\nother two rivals. The Bulgars claimed the whole of Macedonia, including\r\nSalonika and all the Aegean coast (except Chalcidice), Okhrida, and\r\nMonastir; Greece claimed all southern Macedonia, and Serbia parts of\r\nnorthern and central Macedonia known as Old Serbia. The crux of the\r\nwhole problem was, and is, that the claims of Serbia and Greece do not\r\nclash, while that of Bulgaria, driving a thick wedge between Greece and\r\nSerbia, and thus giving Bulgaria the undoubted hegemony of the\r\npeninsula, came into irreconcilable conflict with those of its rivals.\r\nThe importance of this point was greatly emphasized by the existence of\r\nthe Nish-Salonika railway, which is Serbia’s only direct outlet to the\r\nsea, and runs through Macedonia from north to south, following the\r\nright or western bank of the river Vardar. Should Bulgaria straddle\r\nthat, Serbia would be economically at its mercy, just as in the north\r\nit was already, to its bitter cost, at the mercy of Austria-Hungary.\r\nNevertheless, Bulgarian propaganda had been so effectual that Serbia\r\nand Greece never expected they would eventually be able to join hands\r\nso easily and successfully as they afterwards did.\r\n\r\nThe then unknown quantity of Albania was also a factor. This people,\r\nthough small in numbers, was formidable in character, and had never\r\nbeen effectually subdued by the Turks. They would have been glad to\r\nhave a boundary contiguous with that of Bulgaria (with whom they had no\r\nquarrel) as a support against their hereditary enemies, Serbs in the\r\nnorth and Greeks in the south, who were more than inclined to encroach\r\non their territory. The population of Macedonia, being still under\r\nTurkish rule, was uneducated and ignorant; needless to say it had no\r\nnational consciousness, though this was less true of the Greeks than of\r\nthe Slavs. It is the Slav population of Macedonia that has engendered\r\nso much heat and caused so much blood to be spilt. The dispute as to\r\nwhether it is rather Serb or Bulgar has caused interminable and most\r\nbitter controversy. The truth is that it _was_ neither the one nor the\r\nother, but that, the ethnological and linguistic missionaries of\r\nBulgaria having been first in the field, a majority of the Macedonian\r\nSlavs had been so long and so persistently told that they were Bulgars,\r\nthat after a few years Bulgaria could, with some truth, claim that this\r\nfact was so.\r\n\r\nMacedonia had been successively under Greek, Bulgar, and Serb, before\r\nTurkish, rule, but the Macedonian Slavs had, under the last, been so\r\ncut off both from Bulgars and Serbs, that ethnologically and\r\nlinguistically they did not develop the characteristics of either of\r\nthese two races, which originally belonged to the same southern Slav\r\nstock, but remained a primitive neutral Slav type. If the Serbs had\r\nbeen first in the field instead of the Bulgars, the Macedonian Slavs\r\ncould just as easily have been made into Serbs, sufficiently plausibly\r\nto convince the most knowing expert. The well-known recipe for making a\r\nMacedonian Slav village Bulgar is to add _-ov_ or _-ev_ (pronounced\r\n_-off, -yeff_) on to the names of all the male inhabitants, and to make\r\nit Serb it is only necessary to add further the syllable _-ich, -ov_\r\nand _-ovich_ being respectively the equivalent in Bulgarian and Serbian\r\nof our termination _-son,_ e. g. _Ivanov_ in Bulgarian, and _Jovanovit_\r\nin Serbian = _Johnson_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these three nations Rumania also entered the lists,\r\nsuddenly horrified at discovering the sad plight of the Vlakh\r\nshepherds, who had probably wandered with unconcern about Macedonia\r\nwith their herds since Roman times. As their vague pastures could not\r\npossibly ever be annexed to Rumania, their case was merely used in\r\norder to justify Rumania in claiming eventual territorial compensation\r\nelsewhere at the final day of reckoning. Meanwhile, their existence as\r\na separate and authentic nationality in Turkey was officially\r\nrecognized by the Porte in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe stages of the Macedonian question up to 1908 must at this point be\r\nquite briefly enumerated. Russia and Austria-Hungary, the two ‘most\r\ninterested powers’, who as far back as the eighteenth century had\r\ndivided the Balkans into their respective spheres of interest, east and\r\nwest, came to an agreement in 1897 regarding the final settlement of\r\naffairs in Turkey; but it never reached a conclusive stage and\r\nconsequently was never applied. The Macedonian chaos meanwhile grew\r\nsteadily worse, and the serious insurrections of 1902-3, followed by\r\nthe customary reprisals, thoroughly alarmed the powers. Hilmi Pasha had\r\nbeen appointed Inspector-General of Macedonia in December 1902, but was\r\nnot successful in restoring order. In October 1903 the Emperor Nicholas\r\nII and the Emperor of Austria, with their foreign ministers, met at\r\nMürzsteg, in Styria, and elaborated a more definite plan of reform\r\nknown as the Mürzsteg programme, the drastic terms of which had been\r\nlargely inspired by Lord Lansdowne, then British Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs; the principal feature was the institution of an\r\ninternational gendarmerie, the whole of Macedonia being divided up into\r\nfive districts to be apportioned among the several great powers. Owing\r\nto the procrastination of the Porte and to the extreme complexity of\r\nthe financial measures which had to be elaborated in connexion with\r\nthis scheme of reforms, the last of the negotiations was not completed,\r\nnor the whole series ratified, until April 1907, though the gendarmerie\r\nofficers had arrived in Macedonia in February 1904.\r\n\r\nAt this point again it is necessary to recall the position in regard to\r\nthis question of the various nations concerned. Great Britain and\r\nFrance had no territorial stake in Turkey proper, and did their utmost\r\nto secure reform not only in the _vilayets_ of Macedonia, but also in\r\nthe realm of Ottoman finance. Italy’s interest centred in Albania,\r\nwhose eventual fate, for geographical and strategic reasons, could not\r\nleave it indifferent. Austria-Hungary’s only care was by any means to\r\nprevent the aggrandizement of the Serb nationality and of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, so as to secure the control, if not the possession, of the\r\nroutes to Salonika, if necessary over the prostrate bodies of those two\r\ncountries which defiantly barred Germanic progress towards the East.\r\nRussia was already fatally absorbed in the Far Eastern adventure, and,\r\nmoreover, had, ever since the war of 1878, been losing influence at\r\nConstantinople, where before its word had been law; the Treaty of\r\nBerlin had dealt a blow at Russian prestige, and Russia had ever since\r\nthat date been singularly badly served by its ambassadors to the Porte,\r\nwho were always either too old or too easy-going. Germany, on the other\r\nhand, had been exceptionally fortunate or prudent in the choice of its\r\nrepresentatives. The general trend of German diplomacy in Turkey was\r\nnot grasped until very much later, a fact which redounds to the credit\r\nof the German ambassadors at Constantinople. Ever since the triumphal\r\njourney of William II to the Bosphorus in 1889, German influence, under\r\nthe able guidance of Baron von Radowitz, steadily increased. This\r\nculminated in the régime of the late Baron Marschall von Bieberstein,\r\nwho was ambassador from 1897 to 1912. It was German policy to flatter,\r\nsupport, and encourage Turkey in every possible way, to refrain from\r\ntaking part with the other powers in the invidious and perennial\r\noccupation of pressing reforms on Abdul Hamid, and, above all, to give\r\nas much pocket-money to Turkey and its extravagant ruler as they asked\r\nfor. Germany, for instance, refused to send officers or to have a\r\ndistrict assigned it in Macedonia in 1904, and declined to take part in\r\nthe naval demonstration off Mitylene in 1905. This attitude of Germany\r\nnaturally encouraged the Porte in its policy of delay and subterfuge,\r\nand Turkey soon came to look on Germany as its only strong, sincere,\r\nand disinterested friend in Europe. For the indefinite continuance of\r\nchaos and bloodshed in Macedonia, after the other powers had really\r\nbraced themselves to the thankless task of putting the reforms into\r\npractice, Germany alone was responsible.\r\n\r\nThe blow which King Ferdinand had inflicted on the prestige of the\r\nYoung Turks in October 1908, by proclaiming his independence, naturally\r\nlent lustre to the Bulgarian cause in Macedonia. Serbia, baffled by the\r\nsimultaneous Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and\r\nmaddened by the elevation of Bulgaria to the rank of a kingdom (its\r\nmaterial progress had hitherto been discounted in Serbian eyes by the\r\nfact that it was a mere vassal principality), seemed about to be\r\ncrushed by the two iron pots jostling it on either side. Its\r\ninternational position was at that time such that it could expect no\r\nhelp or encouragement from western Europe, while the events of 1909\r\n(cf. p. 144) showed that Russia was not then in a position to render\r\nactive assistance. Greece, also screaming aloud for compensation, was\r\ntold by its friends amongst the great powers that if it made a noise it\r\nwould get nothing, but that if it behaved like a good child it might\r\nsome day be given Krete. Meanwhile Russia, rudely awakened by the\r\nevents of 1908 to the real state of affairs in the Near East, beginning\r\nto realize the growth of German influence at Constantinople, and seeing\r\nthe unmistakable resuscitation of Austria-Hungary as a great power,\r\nmade manifest by the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, temporarily\r\nreasserted its influence in Bulgaria. From the moment when Baron\r\nAehrenthal announced his chimerical scheme of an Austrian railway\r\nthrough the _Sandjak_ of Novi Pazar in January 1908— everybody knows\r\nthat the railway already built through Serbia along the Morava valley\r\nis the only commercially remunerative and strategically practicable\r\nroad from Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest to Salonika and\r\nConstantinople—Russia realized that the days of the Mürzsteg programme\r\nwere over, that henceforward it was to be a struggle between Slav and\r\nTeuton for the ownership of Constantinople and the dominion of the Near\r\nEast, and that something must be done to retrieve the position in the\r\nBalkans which it was losing. After Baron Aehrenthal, in January 1909,\r\nhad mollified the Young Turks by an indemnity, and thus put an end to\r\nthe boycott, Russia in February of the same year liquidated the remains\r\nof the old Turkish war indemnity of 1878 still due to itself by\r\nskilfully arranging that Bulgaria should pay off its capitalized\r\ntribute, owed to its ex-suzerain the Sultan, by very easy instalments\r\nto Russia instead.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effects of the Young Turk revolution amongst the Balkan\r\nStates, and the events, watched benevolently by Russia, which led to\r\nthe formation of the Balkan League, when it was joyfully realized that\r\nneither the setting-up of parliamentary government, nor even the\r\noverthrow of Abdul Hamid, implied the commencement of the millennium in\r\nMacedonia and Thrace, have been described elsewhere (pp. 141, 148).\r\nKing Ferdinand and M. Venezelos are generally credited with the\r\ninception and realisation of the League, though it was so secretly and\r\nskilfully concerted that it is not yet possible correctly to apportion\r\npraise for the remarkable achievement. Bulgaria is a very democratic\r\ncountry, but King Ferdinand, owing to his sagacity, patience, and\r\nexperience, and also thanks to his influential dynastic connexions and\r\npropensity for travel, has always been virtually his own foreign\r\nminister; in spite of the fact that he is a large feudal Hungarian\r\nlandlord, and has temperamental leanings towards the Central European\r\nEmpires, it is quite credible that King Ferdinand devoted all his\r\nundeniable talents and great energy to the formation of the League when\r\nhe saw that the moment had come for Bulgaria to realize its destiny at\r\nTurkey’s expense, and that, if the other three Balkan States could be\r\ninduced to come to the same wise decision, it would be so much the\r\nbetter for all of them. That Russia could do anything else than\r\nwhole-heartedly welcome the formation of the Balkan League was\r\nabsolutely impossible. Pan-Slavism had long since ceased to be the\r\nforce it was, and nobody in Russia dreamed of or desired the\r\nincorporation of any Balkan territory in the Russian Empire. It is\r\npossible to control Constantinople without possessing the Balkans, and\r\nRussia could only rejoice if a Greco-Slavonic league should destroy the\r\npower of the Turks and thereby make impossible the further advance of\r\nthe Germanic powers eastward.\r\n\r\nThat Russia was ever in the least jealous of the military successes of\r\nthe league, which caused such gnashing of teeth in Berlin, Vienna, and\r\nBudapest, is a mischievous fiction, the emptiness of which was evident\r\nto any one who happened to be in Russia during the winter of 1912-13.\r\n\r\nThe years 1908 to 1912 were outwardly uneventful in Bulgaria, though a\r\ngreat deal of quiet work was done in increasing the efficiency of the\r\narmy, and the material prosperity of the country showed no falling off.\r\nRelations with the other Balkan States, especially with Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, improved considerably, and there was ample room for such\r\nimprovement. This was outwardly marked by frequent visits paid to each\r\nother by members of the several royal families of the three Slavonic\r\nkingdoms of the Balkans. In May 1912 agreements for the eventual\r\ndelimitation of the provinces to be conquered from Turkey in the event\r\nof war were signed between Bulgaria and Serbia, and Bulgaria and\r\nGreece. The most controversial district was, of course, Macedonia.\r\nBulgaria claimed central Macedonia, with Monastir and Okhrida, which\r\nwas the lion’s share, on ethnical grounds which have been already\r\ndiscussed, and it was expected that Greece and Serbia, by obtaining\r\nother acquisitions elsewhere, would consent to have their territories\r\nseparated by the large Bulgarian wedge which was to be driven between\r\nthem. The exact future line of demarcation between Serbian and\r\nBulgarian territory was to be left to arbitration. The possible\r\ncreation of an independent Albania was not contemplated.\r\n\r\nIn August 1912 the twenty-fifth anniversary of King Ferdinand’s arrival\r\nin Bulgaria was celebrated with much rejoicing at the ancient capital\r\nof Tirnovo, and was marred only by the news of the terrible massacre of\r\nBulgars by Turks at Kochana in Macedonia; this event, however,\r\nopportune though mournful, tended considerably to increase the volume\r\nof the wave of patriotism which swept through the country. Later in the\r\nsame month Count Berchtold startled Europe with his ‘progressive\r\ndecentralization’ scheme of reform for Macedonia. The manner in which\r\nthis event led to the final arrangements for the declaration of war on\r\nTurkey by the four Balkan States is given in full elsewhere (cf. p.\r\n151).\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian army was fully prepared for the fray, and the autumn\r\nmanoeuvres had permitted the concentration unobserved of a considerable\r\nportion of it, ready to strike when the time came. Mobilisation was\r\nordered on September 30, 1912. On October 8 Montenegro declared war on\r\nTurkey. On October 13 Bulgaria, with the other Balkan States, replied\r\nto the remonstrances of Russia and Austria by declaring that its\r\npatience was at length exhausted, and that the sword alone was able to\r\nenforce proper treatment of the Christian populations in European\r\nTurkey. On October 17 Turkey, encouraged by the sudden and unexpected\r\nconclusion of peace with Italy after the Libyan war, declared war on\r\nBulgaria and Serbia, and on October 18 King Ferdinand addressed a\r\nsentimental exhortation to his people to liberate their\r\nfellow-countrymen, who were still groaning under the Crescent.\r\n\r\nThe number of Turkish troops opposing the Bulgarians in Thrace was\r\nabout 180,000, and they had almost exactly the same number wherewith to\r\noppose the Serbians in Macedonia; for, although Macedonia was\r\nconsidered by the Turks to be the most important theatre of war, yet\r\nthe proximity of the Bulgarian frontier to Constantinople made it\r\nnecessary to retain a large number of troops in Thrace. On October 19\r\nthe Bulgarians took the frontier town of Mustafa Pasha. On October 24\r\nthey defeated the Turks at Kirk-Kilissé (or Lozengrad), further east.\r\nFrom October 28 to November 2 raged the terrific battle of Lule-Burgas,\r\nwhich resulted in a complete and brilliant victory of the Bulgarians\r\nover the Turks. The defeat and humiliation of the Turks was as rapid\r\nand thorough in Thrace as it had been in Macedonia, and by the middle\r\nof November the remains of the Turkish army were entrenched behind the\r\nimpregnable lines of Chataldja, while a large garrison was shut up in\r\nAdrianople, which had been invested by the end of October. The\r\nBulgarian army, somewhat exhausted by this brilliant and lightning\r\ncampaign, refrained from storming the lines of Chataldja, an operation\r\nwhich could not fail to involve losses such as the Bulgarian nation was\r\nscarcely in a position to bear, and on December 3 the armistice was\r\nsigned. The negotiations conducted in London for two months led,\r\nhowever, to no result, and on February 3, 1913, hostilities were\r\nresumed. These, for the Bulgarians, resolved themselves into the more\r\nenergetic prosecution of the siege of Adrianople, which had not been\r\nraised during the armistice. To their assistance Serbia, being able to\r\nspare troops from Macedonia, sent 50,000 men and a quantity of heavy\r\nsiege artillery, an arm which the Bulgarians lacked. On March 26, 1913,\r\nthe fortress surrendered to the allied armies.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of London, which took place during the spring of that\r\nyear, fixed the new Turco-Bulgarian boundary by drawing the famous\r\nEnos-Midia line, running between these two places situated on the\r\nshores respectively of the Aegean and the Black Sea. This delimitation\r\nwould have given Bulgaria possession of Adrianople. But meanwhile\r\nGreece and especially Serbia, which latter country had been compelled\r\nto withdraw from the Adriatic coast by Austria, and was further\r\nprecluded from ever returning there by the creation of the independent\r\nstate of Albania, determined to retain possession of all that part of\r\nMacedonia, including the whole valley of the Vardar with its important\r\nrailway, which they had conquered, and thus secure their common\r\nfrontier. In May 1913 a military convention was concluded between them,\r\nand the Balkan League, the relations between the members of which had\r\nbeen becoming more strained ever since January, finally dissolved.\r\nBulgaria, outraged by this callous disregard of the agreements as to\r\nthe partition of Macedonia signed a year previously by itself and its\r\nex-allies, did not wait for the result of the arbitration which was\r\nactually proceeding in Russia, but in an access of indignation rushed\r\nto arms.\r\n\r\nThis second Balkan war, begun by Bulgaria during the night of June 30,\r\n1913, by a sudden attack on the Serbian army in Macedonia, resulted in\r\nits undoing. In order to defeat the Serbs and Greeks the south-eastern\r\nand northern frontiers were denuded of troops. But the totally\r\nunforeseen happened. The Serbs were victorious, defeating the Bulgars\r\nin Macedonia, the Turks, seeing Thrace empty of Bulgarian troops,\r\nre-occupied Adrianople, and the Rumanian army, determined to see fair\r\nplay before it was too late, invaded Bulgaria from the north and\r\nmarched on Sofia. By the end of July the campaign was over and Bulgaria\r\nhad to submit to fate.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the Treaty of Bucarest, which was concluded on August\r\n10, 1913, Bulgaria obtained a considerable part of Thrace and eastern\r\nMacedonia, including a portion of the Aegean coast with the seaport of\r\nDedeagach, but it was forced to ‘compensate’ Rumania with a slice of\r\nits richest province (the districts of Dobrich and Silistria in\r\nnorth-eastern Bulgaria), and it lost central Macedonia, a great part of\r\nwhich it would certainly have been awarded by Russia’s arbitration. On\r\nSeptember 22, 1913, the Treaty of Constantinople was signed by Bulgaria\r\nand Turkey; by its terms Turkey retained possession of Adrianople and\r\nof a far larger part of Thrace than its series of ignominious defeats\r\nin the autumn of 1912 entitled it to.\r\n\r\nIn the fatal quarrel between Bulgaria and Serbia which caused the\r\ndisruption of the Balkan League, led to the tragic second Balkan war of\r\nJuly 1913, and naturally left behind the bitterest feelings, it is\r\ndifficult to apportion the blame. Both Serbia and Bulgaria were\r\nundoubtedly at fault in the choice of the methods by which they sought\r\nto adjust their difference, but the real guilt is to be found neither\r\nin Sofia nor in Belgrade, but in Vicuna and Budapest. The Balkan League\r\nbarred the way of the Germanic Powers to the East; its disruption\r\nweakened Bulgaria and again placed Serbia at the mercy of the Dual\r\nMonarchy. After these trying and unremunerative experiences it is not\r\nastonishing that the Bulgarian people and its ambitious ruler should\r\nhave retired to the remote interior of their shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of Serbian orthography_\r\n\r\nc = ts\r\nč = ch (as in _church_)\r\nć = ” ” ” but softer\r\nš = sh\r\nž = zh (as z in _azure_)\r\ngj = g (as in _George_)\r\nj = y\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BALKAN PENINSULA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERBIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n_The Serbs under Foreign Supremacy_, 650–1168\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner of the arrival of the Slavs in the Balkan peninsula, of that\r\nof the Bulgars, and of the formation of the Bulgarian nationality has\r\nalready been described (cf. p. 26). The installation of the Slavs in\r\nthe lands between the Danube, the Aegean, and the Adriatic was\r\ncompleted by about A.D. 650. In the second half of the seventh century\r\nthe Bulgars settled themselves in the eastern half of the peninsula and\r\nbecame absorbed by the Slavs there, and from that time the nationality\r\nof the Slavs in the western half began to be more clearly defined.\r\nThese latter, split up into a number of tribes, gradually grouped\r\nthemselves into three main divisions: Serbs (or Serbians), Croats (or\r\nCroatians), and Slovenes. The Serbs, much the most numerous of the\r\nthree, occupied roughly the modern kingdom of Serbia (including Old\r\nSerbia and northern Macedonia), Montenegro, and most of Bosnia,\r\nHercegovina, and Dalmatia; the Croats occupied the more western parts\r\nof these last three territories and Croatia; the Slovenes occupied the\r\nmodern Carniola and southern Carinthia. Needless to say, none of these\r\ngeographical designations existed in those days except Dalmatia, on the\r\ncoast of which the Latin influence and nomenclature maintained itself.\r\nThe Slovenes, whose language is closely akin to but not identical with\r\nSerbian (or Croatian), even to-day only number one and a half million,\r\nand do not enter into this narrative, as they have never played any\r\npolitical rôle in the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe Serbs and the Croats were, as regards race and language, originally\r\none people, the two names having merely geographical signification. In\r\ncourse of time, for various reasons connected with religion and\r\npolitics, the distinction was emphasized, and from a historical point\r\nof view the Serbo-Croatian race has always been divided into two. It is\r\nonly within the last few years that a movement has taken place, the\r\nobject of which is to reunite Serbs and Croats into one nation and\r\neventually into one state. The movement originated in Serbia, the Serbs\r\nmaintaining that they and the Croats are one people because they speak\r\nthe same language, and that racial and linguistic unity outweighs\r\nreligious divergence. A very large number of Croats agree with the\r\nSerbs in this and support their views, but a minority for long\r\nobstinately insisted that there was a racial as well as a religious\r\ndifference, and that fusion was impossible. The former based their\r\nargument on facts, the latter theirs on prejudice, which is notoriously\r\ndifficult to overcome. Latterly the movement in favour of fusion grew\r\nvery much stronger among the Croats, and together with that in Serbia\r\nresulted in the Pan-Serb agitation which, gave the pretext for the\r\nopening of hostilities in July 1914.\r\n\r\nThe designation Southern Slav (or Jugo-Slav, _jug_, pronounced yug, =\r\n_south_ in Serbian) covers Serbs and Croats, and also includes\r\nSlovenes; it is only used with reference to the Bulgarians from the\r\npoint of view of philology (the group of South Slavonic languages\r\nincluding Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene; the East Slavonic,\r\nRussian; and the West Slavonic, Polish and Bohemian).\r\n\r\nIn the history of the Serbs and Croats, or of the Serbo-Croatian race,\r\nseveral factors of a general nature have first to be considered, which\r\nhave influenced its whole development. Of these, the physical nature of\r\nthe country in which they settled, between the Danube and Save and the\r\nAdriatic, is one of the most important. It is almost everywhere\r\nmountainous, and though the mountains themselves never attain as much\r\nas 10,000 feet in height, yet they cover the whole country with an\r\nintricate network and have always formed an obstacle to easy\r\ncommunication between the various parts of it. The result of this has\r\nbeen twofold. In the first place it has, generally speaking, been a\r\nprotection against foreign penetration and conquest, and in so far was\r\nbeneficial. Bulgaria, further east, is, on the whole, less mountainous,\r\nin spite of the Balkan range which stretches the whole length of it;\r\nfor this reason, and also on account of its geographical position, any\r\ninvaders coming from the north or north-east, especially if aiming at\r\nConstantinople or Salonika, were bound to sweep over it. The great\r\nimmemorial highway from the north-west to the Balkan peninsula crosses\r\nthe Danube at Belgrade and follows the valley of the Morava to Nish;\r\nthence it branches off eastwards, going through Sofia and again\r\ncrossing all Bulgaria to reach Constantinople, while the route to\r\nSalonika follows the Morava southwards from Nish and crosses the\r\nwatershed into the valley of the Vardar, which flows into the Aegean.\r\nBut even this road, following the course of the rivers Morava and\r\nVardar, only went through the fringe of Serb territory, and left\r\nuntouched the vast mountain region between the Morava and the Adriatic,\r\nwhich is really the home of the Serb race.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, while it has undoubtedly been a protection to the\r\nSerb race, it has also been a source of weakness. It has prevented a\r\nwelding together of the people into one whole, has facilitated the rise\r\nof numerous political units at various times, and generally favoured\r\nthe dissipation of the national strength, and militated against\r\nnational organization and cohesion. In the course of history this\r\nprocess has been emphasized rather than diminished, and to-day the Serb\r\nrace is split up into six political divisions, while Bulgaria, except\r\nfor those Bulgars claimed as ‘unredeemed’ beyond the frontier, presents\r\na united whole. It is only within the last thirty years, with the\r\ngradual improvement of communications (obstructed to an incredible\r\nextent by the Austro-Hungarian government) and the spread of education,\r\nthat the Serbs in the different countries which they inhabit have\r\nbecome fully conscious of their essential identity and racial unity.\r\n\r\nNo less important than the physical aspect of their country on the\r\ndevelopment of the Serbs has been the fact that right through the\r\nmiddle of it from south to north there had been drawn a line of\r\ndivision more than two centuries before their arrival. Artificial\r\nboundaries are proverbially ephemeral, but this one has lasted\r\nthroughout the centuries, and it has been baneful to the Serbs. This\r\ndividing line, drawn first by the Emperor Diocletian, has been\r\ndescribed on p. 14; at the division of the Roman Empire into East and\r\nWest it was again followed, and it formed the boundary between the\r\ndioceses of Italy and Dacia; the line is roughly the same as the\r\npresent political boundary between Montenegro and Hercegovina, between\r\nthe kingdom of Serbia and Bosnia; it stretched from the Adriatic to the\r\nriver Save right across the Serb territory. The Serbo-Croatian race\r\nunwittingly occupied a country that was cut in two by the line that\r\ndivides East from West, and separates Constantinople and the Eastern\r\nChurch from Rome and the Western. This curious accident has had\r\nconsequences fatal to the unity of the race, since it has played into\r\nthe hands of ambitious and unscrupulous neighbours. As to the extent of\r\nthe country occupied by the Serbs at the beginning of their history it\r\nis difficult to be accurate.\r\n\r\nThe boundary between the Serbs in the west of the peninsula and the\r\nBulgars in the east has always been a matter of dispute. The present\r\npolitical frontier between Serbia and Bulgaria, starting in the north\r\nfrom the mouth of the river Timok on the southern bank of the Danube\r\nand going southwards slightly east of Pirot, is ethnographically\r\napproximately correct till it reaches the newly acquired and\r\nmuch-disputed territories in Macedonia, and represents fairly\r\naccurately the line that has divided the two nationalities ever since\r\nthey were first differentiated in the seventh century. In the confused\r\nstate of Balkan politics in the Middle Ages the political influence of\r\nBulgaria often extended west of this line and included Nish and the\r\nMorava valley, while at other times that of Serbia extended east of it.\r\nThe dialects spoken in these frontier districts represent a\r\ntransitional stage between the two languages; each of the two peoples\r\nnaturally considers them more akin to its own, and resents the fact\r\nthat any of them should be included in the territory of the other.\r\nFurther south, in Macedonia, conditions are similar. Before the Turkish\r\nconquest Macedonia had been sometimes under Bulgarian rule, as in the\r\ntimes of Simeon, Samuel, and John Asen II, sometimes under Serbian,\r\nespecially during the height of Serbian power in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, while intermittently it had been a province of the Greek\r\nEmpire, which always claimed it as its own. On historical grounds,\r\ntherefore, each of the three nations can claim possession of Macedonia.\r\nFrom an ethnographic point of view the Slav population of Macedonia\r\n(there were always and are still many non-Slav elements) was originally\r\nthe same as that in the other parts of the peninsula, and probably more\r\nakin to the Serbs, who are pure Slavs, than to the Slavs of Bulgaria,\r\nwho coalesced with their Asiatic conquerors. In course of time,\r\nhowever, Bulgarian influences, owing to the several periods when the\r\nBulgars ruled the country, began to make headway. The Albanians also\r\n(an Indo-European or Aryan race, but not of the Greek, Latin, or Slav\r\nfamilies), who, as a result of all the invasions of the Balkan\r\npeninsula, had been driven southwards into the inaccessible mountainous\r\ncountry now known as Albania, began to spread northwards and eastwards\r\nagain during the Turkish dominion, pushing back the Serbs from the\r\nterritory where they had long been settled. During the Turkish dominion\r\nneither Serb nor Bulgar had any influence in Macedonia, and the\r\nMacedonian Slavs, who had first of all been pure Slavs, like the Serbs,\r\nthen been several times under Bulgar, and finally, under Serb\r\ninfluence, were left to themselves, and the process of differentiation\r\nbetween Serb and Bulgar in Macedonia, by which in time the Macedonian\r\nSlavs would have become either Serbs or Bulgars, ceased. The further\r\ndevelopment of the Macedonian question is treated elsewhere (cf. chap.\r\n13).\r\n\r\nThe Serbs, who had no permanent or well-defined frontier in the east,\r\nwhere their neighbours were the Bulgars, or in the south, where they\r\nwere the Greeks and Albanians, were protected on the north by the river\r\nSave and on the west by the Adriatic. They were split up into a number\r\nof tribes, each of which was headed by a chief called in Serbian\r\n_župan_ and in Greek _archōn_. Whenever any one of these managed,\r\neither by skill or by good fortune, to extend his power over a few of\r\nthe neighbouring districts he was termed _veliki_ (=great) _župan_.\r\nFrom the beginning of their history, which is roughly put at A.D. 650,\r\nuntil A.D. 1196, the Serbs were under foreign domination. Their\r\nsuzerains were nominally always the Greek emperors, who had ‘granted’\r\nthem the land they had taken, and whenever the emperor happened to be\r\nenergetic and powerful, as were Basil I (the Macedonian, 867-86), John\r\nTzimisces (969-76), Basil II (976-1025), and Manuel Comnenus (1143-80),\r\nthe Greek supremacy was very real. At those times again when Bulgaria\r\nwas very powerful, under Simeon (893-927), Samuel (977-1014), and John\r\nAsen II (1218-41), many of the more easterly and southerly Serbs came\r\nunder Bulgarian rule, though it is instructive to notice that the Serbs\r\nthemselves do not recognize the West Bulgarian or Macedonian kingdom of\r\nSamuel to have been a Bulgarian state. The Bulgars, however, at no time\r\nbrought all the Serb lands under their sway.\r\n\r\nIntermittently, whenever the power of Byzantium or of Bulgaria waned,\r\nsome Serb princeling would try to form a political state on a more\r\nambitious scale, but the fabric always collapsed at his death, and the\r\nSerbs reverted to their favourite occupation of quarrelling amongst\r\nthemselves. Such wore the attempts of Časlav, who had been made captive\r\nby Simeon of Bulgaria, escaped after his death, and ruled over a large\r\npart of central Serbia till 960, and later of Bodin, whose father,\r\nMichael, was even recognized as king by Pope Gregory VII; Bodin formed\r\na state near the coast, in the Zeta river district (now Montenegro),\r\nand ruled there from 1081 to 1101. But as a rule the whole of the\r\ncountry peopled by the Serbs was split into a number of tiny\r\nprincipalities always at war with one another. Generally speaking, this\r\ncountry gradually became divided into two main geographical divisions:\r\n(1) the _Pomorje_, or country _by the sea_, which included most of the\r\nmodern Montenegro and the southern halves of Hercegovina and Dalmatia,\r\nand (2) the _Zagorje_, or country _behind the hills_, which included\r\nmost of the modern Bosnia, the western half of the modern kingdom of\r\nSerbia, and the northern portions of Montenegro and Hercegovina,\r\ncovering all the country between the _Pomorje_ and the Save; to the\r\nnorth of the _Pomorje_ and _Zagorje_ lay Croatia. Besides their\r\nneighbours in the east and south, those in the north and west played an\r\nimportant part in Serbian history even in those early days.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eighth century, after the decline of the power\r\nof the Avars, Charlemagne extended his conquests eastwards (he made a\r\ngreat impression on the minds of the Slavs, whose word for king, _kral_\r\nor _korol_, is derived directly from his name), and his son Louis\r\nconquered the Serbs settled in the country between the rivers Save and\r\nDrave. This is commemorated in the name of the mass of hill which lies\r\nbetween the Danube and the Save, in eastern Slavonia, and is to this\r\nday known as _Fruška Gora_, or French Hill. The Serbs and Bulgars\r\nfought against the Franks, and while the Bulgars held their own, the\r\nSerbs were beaten, and those who did not like the rule of the\r\nnew-comers had to migrate southwards across the Save; at the same time\r\nthe Serbs between the rivers Morava and Timok (eastern Serbia) were\r\nsubjected by the Bulgars. With the arrival of the Magyars, in the ninth\r\ncentury, a wall was raised between the Serbs and central and western\r\nEurope on land. Croatia and Slavonia (between the Save and the Drave)\r\nwere gradually drawn into the orbit of the Hungarian state, and in\r\n1102, on the death of its own ruler, Croatia was absorbed by Hungary\r\nand has formed part of that country ever since. Hungary, aiming at an\r\noutlet on the Adriatic, at the same time subjected most of Dalmatia and\r\nparts of Bosnia. In the west Venice had been steadily growing in power\r\nthroughout the tenth century, and by the end of it had secured control\r\nof all the islands off Dalmatia and of a considerable part of the\r\ncoast. All the cities on the mainland acknowledged the supremacy of\r\nVenice and she was mistress of the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the Serb territory, during the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies, three political centres came into prominence and shaped\r\nthemselves into larger territorial units. These were: (1) Raska, which\r\nhad been Caslav’s centre and is considered the birth-place of the\r\nSerbian state (this district, with the town of Ras as its centre,\r\nincluded the south-western part of the modern kingdom of Serbia and\r\nwhat was the Turkish _sandjak_ or province of Novi-Pazar); (2) Zeta, on\r\nthe coast (the modern Montenegro); and (3) Bosnia, so called after the\r\nriver Bosna, which runs through it. Bosnia, which roughly corresponded\r\nto the modern province of that name, became independent in the second\r\nhalf of the tenth century, and was never after that incorporated in the\r\nSerbian state. At times it fell under Hungarian influence; in the\r\ntwelfth century, during the reign of Manuel Comnenus, who was\r\nvictorious over the Magyars, Bosnia, like all other Serb territories,\r\nhad to acknowledge the supremacy of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIt has already been indicated that the Serbs and Croats occupied\r\nterritory which, while the Church was still one, was divided between\r\ntwo dioceses, Italy and Dacia, and when the Church itself was divided,\r\nin the eleventh century, was torn apart between the two beliefs. The\r\ndividing line between the jurisdictions of Rome and Constantinople ran\r\nfrom north to south through Bosnia, but naturally there has always been\r\na certain vagueness about the extent of their respective jurisdictions.\r\nIn later years the terms Croat and Roman Catholic on the one hand, and\r\nSerb and Orthodox on the other, became interchangeable. Hercegovina and\r\neastern Bosnia have always been predominantly Orthodox, Dalmatia and\r\nwestern Bosnia predominantly Roman Catholic. The loyalty of the\r\nCroatians to Austria-Hungary has been largely owing to the influence of\r\nRoman Catholicism.\r\n\r\nDuring the first centuries of Serbian history Christianity made slow\r\nprogress in the western half of the Balkan peninsula. The Dalmatian\r\ncoast was always under the influence of Rome, but the interior was long\r\npagan. It is doubtful whether the brothers Cyril and Methodius (cf.\r\nchap. 5) actually passed through Serb territory, but in the tenth\r\ncentury their teachings and writings were certainly current there. At\r\nthe time of the division of the Churches all the Serb lands except the\r\nDalmatian coast, Croatia, and western Bosnia, were faithful to\r\nConstantinople, and the Greek hierarchy obtained complete control of\r\nthe ecclesiastical administration. The elaborate organisation and\r\nopulent character of the Eastern Church was, however, especially in the\r\nhands of the Greeks, not congenial to the Serbs, and during the\r\neleventh and twelfth centuries the Bogomil heresy (cf. chap, 6), a much\r\nmore primitive and democratic form of Christianity, already familiar in\r\nthe East as the Manichaean heresy, took hold of the Serbs’ imagination\r\nand made as rapid and disquieting progress in their country as it had\r\nalready done in the neighbouring Bulgaria; inasmuch as the Greek\r\nhierarchy considered this teaching to be socialistic, subversive, and\r\nhighly dangerous to the ecclesiastical supremacy of Constantinople, all\r\nof which indeed it was, adherence to it became amongst the Serbs a\r\ndirect expression of patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n_The Rise and Fall of the Serbian Empire and the Extinction of Serbian\r\nIndependence_, 1168–1496\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1168 the power of the Serbs, or rather of the central Serb state\r\nof Raska, and the extent of its territory gradually but steadily\r\nincreased. This was outwardly expressed in the firm establishment on\r\nthe throne of the national Nemanja dynasty, which can claim the credit\r\nof having by its energy, skill, and good fortune fashioned the most\r\nimposing and formidable state the Serb race has ever known. This\r\ndynasty ruled the country uninterruptedly, but not without many\r\nquarrels, feuds, and rivalries amongst its various members, from 1168\r\nuntil 1371, when it became extinct.\r\n\r\nThere were several external factors which at this time favoured the\r\nrise of the Serbian state. Byzantium and the Greek Empire, to which the\r\nEmperor Manuel Comnenus had by 1168 restored some measure of its former\r\ngreatness and splendour, regaining temporary control, after a long war\r\nwith Hungary, even over Dalmatia, Croatia, and Bosnia, after this date\r\nbegan definitively to decline, and after the troublous times of the\r\nfourth crusade (1204), when for sixty years a Latin empire was\r\nestablished on the Bosphorus, never again recovered as a Christian\r\nstate the position in the Balkan peninsula which it had so long\r\nenjoyed. Bulgaria, too, after the meteoric glory of its second empire\r\nunder the Asen dynasty (1186-1258), quite went to pieces, the eastern\r\nand northern parts falling under Tartar, the southern under Greek\r\ninfluence, while the western districts fell to Serbia. In the north, on\r\nthe other hand, Hungary was becoming a dangerous and ambitious\r\nneighbour. During the thirteenth century, it is true, the attention of\r\nthe Magyars was diverted by the irruption into and devastation of their\r\ncountry by their unwelcome kinsmen from Asia, the Tartars, who wrought\r\ngreat havoc and even penetrated as far as the Adriatic coast.\r\nNevertheless Hungary was always a menace to Serbia; Croatia, Slavonia,\r\nand the interior of Dalmatia, all purely Serb territories, belonged to\r\nthe Hungarian crown, and Bosnia was under the supremacy of the Magyars,\r\nthough nominally independent.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the Magyars were twofold—to attain the hegemony of the\r\nBalkan peninsula by conquering all the still independent Serb\r\nterritories, and to bring the peninsula within the pale of Rome. They\r\nwere not successful in either of these objects, partly because their\r\nwars with the Serbian rulers always failed to reach a decision, partly\r\nbecause their plans conflicted with those of the powerful Venetian\r\nrepublic. The relations between Venice and Serbia were always most\r\ncordial, as their ambitions did not clash; those of Venice were not\r\ncontinental, while those of Serbia were never maritime. The\r\nsemi-independent Slavonic city-republic of Ragusa (called Dubrovnik in\r\nSerbian) played a very important part throughout this period. It was\r\nunder Venetian supremacy, but was self-governing and had a large fleet\r\nof its own. It was the great place of exchange between Serbia and\r\nwestern Europe, and was really the meeting-place of East and West. Its\r\nrelations with Serbia were by no means always peaceful; it was a\r\nNaboth’s vineyard for the rulers and people of the inland kingdom, and\r\nit was never incorporated within their dominions. Ragusa and the other\r\ncities of the Dalmatian coast were the home during the Middle Ages of a\r\nflourishing school of Serbian literature, which was inspired by that of\r\nItaly. The influence of Italian civilization and of the Italian Church\r\nwas naturally strong in the Serb province, much of which was under\r\nVenetian rule; the reason for this was that communication by sea with\r\nItaly was easier and safer than that by land with Serbia. The long,\r\nformidable ranges of limestone mountains which divide the Serbian\r\ninterior from the Adriatic in almost unbroken and parallel lines have\r\nalways been a barrier to the extension of Serb power to the coast, and\r\nan obstacle to free commercial intercourse. Nevertheless Ragusa was a\r\ngreat trade centre, and one of the factors which most contributed to\r\nthe economic strength of the Serbian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Nemanja dynasty was Stephen, whose title was still\r\nonly _Veliki Župan_; he extended Serb territory southwards at the\r\nexpense of the Greeks, especially after the death of Manuel Comnenus in\r\n1180. He also persecuted the Bogomils, who took refuge in large numbers\r\nin the adjacent Serb state of Bosnia. Like many other Serbian rulers,\r\nhe abdicated in later life in favour of his younger son, Stephen,\r\ncalled Nemanjié (= Nemanya’s son), and himself became a monk (1196),\r\ntravelling for this purpose to Mount Athos, the great monastic centre\r\nand home of theological learning of the Eastern Church. There he saw\r\nhis youngest son, who some years previously had also journeyed thither\r\nand entered a monastery, taking the name of Sava.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for every Serbian ruler to found a sort of memorial\r\nchurch, for the welfare of his own soul, before his death, and to\r\ndecorate and endow it lavishly. Stephen and his son together\r\nsuperintended the erection in this sense of the church and monastery of\r\nHilandar on Mount Athos, which became a famous centre of Serbian church\r\nlife. Stephen died shortly after the completion of the building in\r\n1199, and was buried in it, but in 1207 he was reinterred in the\r\nmonastery of Studenica, in Serbia, also founded by him.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Stephen Nernanjić (1196-1223) opened with a quarrel\r\nbetween him and his elder brother, who not unnaturally felt he ought to\r\nhave succeeded his father; the Bulgarians profited by this and seized a\r\nlarge part of eastern Serbia, including Belgrade, Nish, Prizren, and\r\nSkoplje. This, together with the fall of Constantinople and the\r\nestablishment of the Latin Empire in 1204, alarmed the Serbs and\r\nbrought about a reconciliation between the brothers, and in 1207 Sava\r\nreturned to Serbia to organise the Church on national lines. In 1219 he\r\njourneyed to Nicaea and extracted from the Emperor Theodore Lascaris,\r\nwho had fallen on evil days, the concession for the establishment of an\r\nautonomous national Serbian Church, independent of the Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople. Sava himself was at the head of the new institution. In\r\n1220 he solemnly crowned his brother King _(Kralj)_ of Serbia, the\r\nnatural consequence of his activities in the previous year. For this\r\nreason Stephen Nemanjić is called ‘The First-Crowned’. He was succeeded\r\nin 1223 by his son Stephen Radoslav, and he in turn was deposed by his\r\nbrother Stephen Vladislav in 1233. Both these were crowned by Sava, and\r\nVladislav married the daughter of Tsar John Asen II, under whom\r\nBulgaria was then at the height of her power. Sava journeyed to\r\nPalestine, and on his return paid a visit to the Bulgarian court at\r\nTirnovo, where he died in 1236. His body was brought to Serbia and\r\nburied in the monastery of Mileševo, built by Vladislav. This extremely\r\nable churchman and politician, who did a great deal for the peaceful\r\ndevelopment of his country, was canonized and is regarded as the patron\r\nsaint of Serbia.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Vladislav’s son and successor, Stephen Uroš I (1242-76),\r\nwas characterized by economic development and the strengthening of the\r\ninternal administration. In external affairs he made no conquests, but\r\ndefeated a combination of the Bulgarians with Ragusa against him, and\r\nafter the war the Bulgarian ruler married his daughter. In his wars\r\nagainst Hungary he was unsuccessful, and the Magyars remained in\r\npossession of a large part of northern Serbia. In 1276 he was deposed\r\nby his son, Stephen Dragutin, who in his turn, after an unsuccessful\r\nwar against the Greeks, again masters of Constantinople since 1261, was\r\ndeposed and succeeded by his brother, Stephen Uroš II, named Milutin,\r\nin 1282. This king ruled from 1282 till 1321, and during his reign the\r\ncountry made very great material progress; its mineral wealth\r\nespecially, which included gold and silver mines, began to be\r\nexploited. He extended the boundaries of his kingdom in the north,\r\nmaking the Danube and the Save the frontier. The usual revolt against\r\npaternal authority was made by his son Stephen, but was unsuccessful,\r\nand the rebel was banished to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of the Serbian kings to give appanages to their sons,\r\nand the inevitable consequence of this system was the series of\r\nprovincial rebellions which occurred in almost every reign. When the\r\nrevolt succeeded, the father (or brother) was granted in his turn a\r\nsmall appanage. In this case it was the son who was exiled, but he was\r\nrecalled in 1319 and a reconciliation took place. Milutin died in 1321\r\nand was succeeded by his son, Stephen Uroš III, who reigned till 1331.\r\nHe is known as Stephen Dečanski, after the memorial church which he\r\nbuilt at Dečani in western Serbia. His reign was signalized by a great\r\ndefeat of the combined Bulgarians and Greeks at Kustendil in Macedonia\r\nin 1330. The following year his son, Stephen Dušan, rebelled against\r\nhim and deposed him. Stephen Dušan, who reigned from 1331 till 1355,\r\nwas Serbia’s greatest ruler, and under him the country reached its\r\nutmost limits. Provincial and family revolts and petty local disputes\r\nwith such places as Ragusa became a thing of the past, and he undertook\r\nconquest on a grand scale. Between 1331 and 1344 he subjected all\r\nMacedonia, Albania, Thessaly, and Epirus. He was careful to keep on\r\ngood terms with Ragusa and with Hungary, then under Charles Robert. He\r\nmarried the sister of the Bulgarian ruler, and during his reign\r\nBulgaria was completely under Serbian supremacy. The anarchy and civil\r\nwar which had become perennial at Constantinople, and the weakening of\r\nthe Greek Empire in face of the growing power of the Turks, no doubt to\r\nsome extent explain the facility and rapidity of his conquests;\r\nnevertheless his power was very formidable, and his success inspired\r\nconsiderable alarm in western Europe. This was increased when, in 1345,\r\nhe proclaimed his country an empire. He first called together a special\r\nChurch council, at which the Serbian Church, an archbishopric, whose\r\ncentre was then at Peć (in Montenegro, Ipek in Turkish), was proclaimed\r\na Patriarchate, with Archbishop Joannice as Patriarch; then this\r\nprelate, together with the Bulgarian Patriarch, Simeon, and Nicholas,\r\nArchbishop of Okhrida, crowned Stephen Tsar of the Serbs, Bulgars, and\r\nGreeks. Upon this the Patriarch of Constantinople gave himself the vain\r\nsatisfaction of anathematizing the whole of Serbia, as a punishment for\r\nthis insubordination.\r\n\r\nIn 1353 the Pope, Innocent VI, persuaded King Louis of Hungary to\r\nundertake a crusade against Serbia in the name of Catholicism, but\r\nStephen defeated him and re-established his frontier along the Save and\r\nDanube. Later he conquered the southern half of Dalmatia, and extended\r\nhis empire as far north as the river Cetina. In 1354 Stephen Dušan\r\nhimself approached the Pope, offering to acknowledge his spiritual\r\nsupremacy, if he would support him against the Hungarians and the\r\nTurks. The Pope sent him an embassy, but eventually Stephen could not\r\nagree to the papal conditions, and concluded an alliance, of greater\r\npractical utility, with the Venetians. In 1355, however, he suddenly\r\ndied, at the age of forty-six, and thus the further development and\r\naggrandisement of his country was prematurely arrested.\r\n\r\nStephen Dušan made a great impression on his contemporaries, both by\r\nhis imposing personal appearance and by his undoubted wisdom and\r\nability. He was especially a great legislator, and his remarkable code\r\nof laws, compiled in 1349 and enlarged in 1354, is, outside his own\r\ncountry, his greatest title to fame. During Stephen Dušan’s reign the\r\npolitical centre of Serbia, which had for many years gradually tended\r\nto shift southwards towards Macedonia, was at Skoplje (Üsküb in\r\nTurkish), which he made his capital. Stephen Dušan’s empire extended\r\nfrom the Adriatic in the west to the river Maritsa in the east, from\r\nthe Save and Danube in the north to the Aegean; it included all the\r\nmodern kingdoms of Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, and most of Greece,\r\nDalmatia as far north as the river Cetina, as well as the fertile\r\nMorava valley, with Nish and Belgrade—the whole eastern part of Serbia,\r\nwhich had for long been under either Bulgar or Magyar control. It did\r\nnot include the cities of Salonika or Ragusa, nor any considerable part\r\nof the modern kingdom of Bulgaria, nor Bosnia, Croatia, North Dalmatia,\r\nnor Slavonia (between the Save and Drave), ethnologically all purely\r\nSerb lands. From the point of view of nationality, therefore, its\r\nboundaries were far from ideal.\r\n\r\nStephen Dušan was succeeded by his son, known as Tsar Uroš, but he was\r\nas weak as his father had been strong. Almost as soon as he succeeded\r\nto the throne, disorders, rebellions, and dissensions broke out and the\r\nempire rapidly fell to pieces. With Serbia, as with Bulgaria, the\r\nempire entirely hinged on the personality of one man, and when he was\r\ngone chaos returned. Such an event for Serbia at this juncture was\r\nfatal, as a far more formidable foe than the ruler’s rebellious\r\nrelations was advancing against it. The Turkish conquests were\r\nproceeding apace; they had taken Gallipoli in 1354 and Demotika and\r\nAdrianople in 1361. The Serbs, who had already had an unsuccessful\r\nbrush with the advance guard of the new invaders near Demotika in 1351,\r\nmet them again on the Maritsa river in 1371, and were completely\r\ndefeated. Several of the upstart princes who had been pulling Stephen\r\nDušan’s empire to pieces perished, and Tsar Uroš only survived the\r\nbattle of the Maritsa two months; he was unmarried, and with him died\r\nthe Nemanja dynasty and the Serbian Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter this disaster the unity of the Serbian state was completely\r\ndestroyed, and it has never since been restored in the same measure.\r\n\r\nThat part of the country to the south of Skoplje fell completely under\r\nTurkish control; it was here that the famous national hero, Marko\r\nKraljević (or King’s son), renowned for his prowess, ruled as a vassal\r\nprince and mercenary soldier of the Turks; his father was one of the\r\nrebel princes who fell at the battle of the river Maritsa in 1371.\r\nNorth of Skoplje, Serbia, with Kruševac as a new political centre,\r\ncontinued to lead an independent but precarious existence, much reduced\r\nin size and glory, under a native ruler, Prince Lazar; all the\r\nconquests of Stephen Dušan were lost, and the important coastal\r\nprovince of Zeta, which later developed into Montenegro, had broken\r\naway and proclaimed its autonomy directly after the death of Tsar Uroš.\r\n\r\nIn 1375 a formal reconciliation was effected with the Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople; the ban placed on the Serbian Church in 1352 was\r\nremoved and the independence of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć (Ipek)\r\nrecognised. Meanwhile neither Greeks, Bulgars, nor Serbs were allowed\r\nany peace by the Turks.\r\n\r\nIn 1389 was fought the great battle of Kosovo Polje, or the Field of\r\nBlackbirds, a large plain in Old Serbia, at the southern end of which\r\nis Skoplje. At this battle Serbian armies from all the Serb lands,\r\nincluding Bosnia, joined together in defence of their country for the\r\nlast time. The issue of the battle was for some time in doubt, but was\r\ndecided by the treachery and flight at the critical moment of one of\r\nthe Serb leaders, Vuk Branković, son-in-law of Prince Lazar, with a\r\nlarge number of troops. Another dramatic incident was the murder of\r\nSultan Murad in his tent by another Serbian leader, Miloš Obilić, who,\r\naccused of treachery by his own countrymen, vowed he would prove his\r\ngood faith, went over to the Turks and, pretending to be a traitor,\r\ngained admission to the Sultan’s presence and proved his patriotism by\r\nkilling him. The momentary dismay was put an end to by the energetic\r\nconduct of Bayezid, son of Murad, who rallied the Turkish troops and\r\nultimately inflicted total defeat on the Serbians. From the effects of\r\nthis battle Serbia never recovered; Prince Lazar was captured and\r\nexecuted; his wife, Princess Milica, had to give her daughter to\r\nBayezid in marriage, whose son thus ultimately claimed possession of\r\nSerbia by right of inheritance. Princess Milica and her son Stephen\r\ncontinued to live at Kruševac, but Serbia was already a tributary of\r\nTurkey. In the north, Hungary profited by the course of events and\r\noccupied Belgrade and all northern Serbia, but in 1396 the Turks\r\ndefeated the Magyars severely at the battle of Nikopolis, on the\r\nDanube, making the Serbs under Stephen fight on the Turkish side.\r\nStephen also had to help Sultan Bajazet against the Tartars, and fought\r\nat the battle of Angora, in 1402, when Tamerlane captured Bayezid.\r\n\r\nAfter Stephen returned to Serbia he made an alliance with Hungary,\r\nwhich gave him back Belgrade and northern Serbia; it was at this time\r\n(1403) that Belgrade first became the capital, the political centre\r\nhaving in the course of fifty years moved from the Vardar to the\r\nDanube. The disorders which followed the defeat of Bayezid gave some\r\nrespite to the Serbs, but Sultan Murad II (1421-51) again took up arms\r\nagainst him, and invaded Serbia as far as Kruševac.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Stephen (Lazarević), in 1427, he was succeeded as\r\n_Despot_ by his nephew, George Branković; but the Sultan, claiming\r\nSerbia as his own, immediately declared war on him. The Serbian ruler\r\nhad to abandon Belgrade to the Magyars, and Nish and Kruševac to the\r\nTurks. He then built and fortified the town of Smederevo (or Semendria)\r\nlower down on the Danube, in 1428, and made this his capital. He gave\r\nhis daughter in marriage to the Sultan, but in spite of this war soon\r\nbroke out again, and in 1441 the Turks were masters of nearly the whole\r\nof Serbia. Later George Branković made another alliance with Hungary,\r\nand in 1444, with the help of John Hunyadi, defeated the Turks and\r\nliberated the whole of Serbia as far as the Adriatic, though he\r\nremained a tributary of the Sultan. The same year, however, the Magyars\r\nbroke the treaty of peace just concluded with the Turks, and marched\r\nagainst them under their Polish king, Ladislas; this ended in the\r\ndisastrous battle of Varna, on the Black Sea, where the king lost his\r\nlife. In 1451 Sultan Murad II died and was succeeded by the Sultan\r\nMohammed. In 1453 this sultan captured Constantinople (Adrianople had\r\nuntil then been the Turkish capital); in 1456 his armies were besieging\r\nBelgrade, but were defeated by John Hunyadi, who, unfortunately for the\r\nSerbs, died of the plague shortly afterwards. George Branković died the\r\nsame year, and at his death general disorder spread over the country.\r\nThe Turks profited by this, overran the whole of Serbia, and in 1459\r\ncaptured Smederevo, the last Serbian stronghold.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bosnia had been for nearly a hundred years enjoying a false\r\nsecurity as an independent Serb kingdom. Its rulers had hitherto been\r\nknown by the title of _Ban_, and were all vassals of the King of\r\nHungary; but in 1377 Ban Tvrtko profited by the embarrassments of his\r\nsuzerain in Poland and proclaimed himself king, the neighbouring\r\nkingdom of Serbia having, after 1371, ceased to exist, and was duly\r\ncrowned in Saint Sava’s monastery of Mileševo. The internal history of\r\nthe kingdom was even more turbulent than had been that of Serbia. To\r\nthe endemic troubles of succession and alternating alliances and wars\r\nwith foreign powers were added those of confession. Bosnia was always a\r\nno man’s land as regards religion; it was where the Eastern and Western\r\nChurches met, and consequently the rivalry between them there was\r\nalways, as it is now, intense and bitter. The Bogomil heresy, too,\r\nearly took root in Bosnia and became extremely popular; it was the\r\nobvious refuge for those who did not care to become involved in the\r\nstrife of the Churches. One of the kings of Bosnia, Stephen Thomas, who\r\nreigned from 1444 till 1461, was himself a Bogomil, and when at the\r\ninsistence of the Pope and of the King of Hungary, whose friendship he\r\nwas anxious to retain, he renounced his heresy, became ostensibly a\r\nRoman Catholic, and began to persecute the Bogomils, he brought about a\r\nrevolution. The rebels fled to the south of Bosnia, to the lands of one\r\nStephen, who sheltered them, proclaimed his independence of Bosnia, and\r\non the strength of the fact that Saint Sava’s monastery of Mileševo was\r\nin his territory, announced himself Herzog, or Duke (in Serbian Herceg,\r\nthough the real Serb equivalent is _Vojvoda_) of Saint Sava, ever since\r\nwhen (1448) that territory has been called Hercegovina. In spite of\r\nmany promises, neither the Pope nor the King of Hungary did anything to\r\nhelp Bosnia when the Turks began to invade the country after their\r\nfinal subjection of Serbia in 1459. In 1463 they invaded Bosnia and\r\npursued, captured, and slew the last king; their conquest of the\r\ncountry was complete and rapid. A great exodus of the Serb population\r\ntook place to the south, west, and north; but large numbers, especially\r\nof the landowning class, embraced the faith of their conquerors in\r\norder to retain possession of their property. In 1482 a similar fate\r\nbefell Hercegovina. Albania had already been conquered after stubborn\r\nresistance in 1478. There remained only the mountainous coastal\r\nprovince of Zeta, which had been an independent principality ever since\r\n1371. Just as inland Serbia had perished between the Turkish hammer and\r\nthe Hungarian anvil, so maritime Serbia was crushed between Turkey and\r\nVenice, only its insignificance and inaccessibility giving it a longer\r\nlease of independent life. Ivan Crnojević, one of the last independent\r\nrulers of Zeta, who had to fly to Italy in 1480, abandoning his\r\ncapital, Žabljak, to the Turks, returned in 1481, when the death of\r\nSultan Mohammed temporarily raised the hopes of the mountaineers, and\r\nfounded Cetinje and made it his capital. His son George, who succeeded\r\nhim and ruled from 1490 till 1496, is famous as having set up the first\r\nSerbian printing-press there. Its activities were naturally not\r\nencouraged by the Turkish conquest, but it was of great importance to\r\nthe national Serbian Church, for which books were printed with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1496, Venice having wisely made peace with the Sultan some years\r\npreviously, this last independent scrap of Serb territory was finally\r\nincorporated in the Turkish dominions. At the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury the Turks were masters of all the Serb lands except Croatia,\r\nSlavonia, and parts of Dalmatia, which belonged to Hungary, and the\r\nDalmatian coast and islands, which were Venetian. The Turkish conquest\r\nof Serbia, which began in 1371 at the battle of the Maritsa, and was\r\nrendered inevitable by the battle of Kosovo Polje, in 1389, thus took a\r\nhundred and twenty-five years to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n_The Turkish Dominion_, 1496–1796\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lot of the Serbs under Turkish rule was different from that of\r\ntheir neighbours the Bulgars; and though it was certainly not enviable,\r\nit was undoubtedly better. The Turks for various reasons never\r\nsucceeded in subduing Serbia and the various Serb lands as completely\r\nas they had subdued, or rather annihilated, Bulgaria. The Serbs were\r\nspread over a far larger extent of territory than were the Bulgars,\r\nthey were further removed from the Turkish centre, and the wooded and\r\nmountainous nature of their country facilitated even more than in the\r\ncase of Bulgaria the formation of bands of brigands and rebels and\r\nmilitated against its systematic policing by the Turks. The number of\r\ncentres of national life, Serbia proper, Bosnia, Hercogovina, and\r\nMontenegro, to take them in the chronological order of their conquest\r\nby the Turks, had been notoriously a source of weakness to the Serbian\r\nstate, as is still the case to-day, but at the same time made it more\r\ndifficult for the Turks to stamp out the national consciousness. What\r\nstill further contributed to this difficulty was the fact that many\r\nSerbs escaped the oppression of Turkish rule by emigrating to the\r\nneighbouring provinces, where they found people of their own race and\r\nlanguage, even though of a different faith. The tide of emigration\r\nflowed in two directions, westwards into Dalmatia and northwards into\r\nSlavonia and Hungary. It had begun already after the final subjection\r\nof Serbia proper and Bosnia by the Turks in 1459 and 1463, but after\r\nthe fall of Belgrade, which was the outpost of Hungary against the\r\nTurks, in 1521, and the battle of Mohacs, in 1526, when the Turks\r\ncompletely defeated the Magyars, it assumed great proportions. As the\r\nTurks pushed their conquests further north, the Serbs migrated before\r\nthem; later on, as the Turks receded, large Serb colonies sprang up all\r\nover southern Hungary, in the Banat (the country north of the Danube\r\nand east of the Theiss), in Syrmia (or Srem, in Serbian, the extreme\r\neastern part of Slavonia, between the Save and the Danube), in Bačka\r\n(the country between the Theiss and Danube), and in Baranya (between\r\nthe Danube and the Drave). All this part of southern Hungary and\r\nCroatia was formed by the Austrians into a military borderland against\r\nTurkey, and the Croats and immigrant Serbs were organized as military\r\ncolonists with special privileges, on the analogy of the Cossacks in\r\nsouthern Russia and Poland. In Dalmatia the Serbs played a similar rôle\r\nin the service of Venice, which, like Austria-Hungary, was frequently\r\nat war with the Turks. During the sixteenth century Ragusa enjoyed its\r\ngreatest prosperity; it paid tribute to the Sultan, was under his\r\nprotection, and never rebelled. It had a quasi monopoly of the trade of\r\nthe entire Balkan peninsula. It was a sanctuary both for Roman Catholic\r\nCroats and for Orthodox Serbs, and sometimes acted as intermediary on\r\nbehalf of its co-religionists with the Turkish authorities, with whom\r\nit wielded great influence. Intellectually also it was a sort of Serb\r\noasis, and the only place during the Middle Ages where Serbian\r\nliterature was able to flourish.\r\n\r\nMontenegro during the sixteenth century formed part of the Turkish\r\nprovince of Scutari. Here, as well as in Serbia proper, northern\r\nMacedonia (known after the removal northwards of the political centre,\r\nin the fourteenth century, as Old Serbia), Bosnia, and Hercegovina, the\r\nTurkish rule was firmest, but not harshest, during the first half of\r\nthe sixteenth century, when the power of the Ottoman Empire was at its\r\nheight. Soon after the fall of Smederevo, in 1459, the Patriarchate of\r\nPeć (Ipek) was abolished, the Serbian Church lost its independence, was\r\nmerged in the Greco-Bulgar Archbishopric of Okhrida (in southern\r\nMacedonia), and fell completely under the control of the Greeks. In\r\n1557, however, through the influence of a Grand Vizier of Serb\r\nnationality, the Patriarchate of Peć was revived. The revival of this\r\ncentre of national life was momentous; through its agency the Serbian\r\nmonasteries were restored, ecclesiastical books printed, and priests\r\neducated, and more fortunate than the Bulgarian national Church, which\r\nremained under Greek management, it was able to focus the national\r\nenthusiasms and aspirations and keep alive with hope the flame of\r\nnationality amongst those Serbs who had not emigrated.\r\n\r\nAlready, in the second half of the sixteenth century, people began to\r\nthink that Turkey’s days in Europe were numbered, and they were\r\nencouraged in this illusion by the battle of Lepanto (1571). But the\r\nseventeenth century saw a revival of Turkish power; Krete was added to\r\ntheir empire, and in 1683 they very nearly captured Vienna. In the war\r\nwhich followed their repulse, and in which the victorious Austrians\r\npenetrated as far south as Skoplje, the Serbs took part against the\r\nTurks; but when later the Austrians were obliged to retire, the Serbs,\r\nwho had risen against the Turks at the bidding of their Patriarch Arsen\r\nIII, had to suffer terrible reprisals at their hands, with the result\r\nthat another wholesale emigration, with the Patriarch at its head, took\r\nplace into the Austro-Hungarian military borderland. This time it was\r\nthe very heart of Serbia which was abandoned, namely, Old Serbia and\r\nnorthern Macedonia, including Peć and Prizren. The vacant Patriarchate\r\nwas for a time filled by a Greek, and the Albanians, many of whom were\r\nMohammedans and therefore Turcophil, spread northwards and eastwards\r\ninto lands that had been Serb since the seventh century. From the end\r\nof the seventeenth century, however, the Turkish power began\r\nunmistakably to wane. The Treaty of Carlowitz (1699) left the Turks\r\nstill in possession of Syrmia (between the Danube and Save) and the\r\nBanat (north of the Danube), but during the reign of the Emperor\r\nCharles VI their retreat was accelerated. In 1717 Prince Eugen of Savoy\r\ncaptured Belgrade, then, as now, a bulwark of the Balkan peninsula\r\nagainst invasion from the north, and by the Treaty of Passarowitz\r\n(Požarevac, on the Danube), in 1718, Turkey not only retreated\r\ndefinitively south of the Danube and the Save, but left a large part of\r\nnorthern Serbia in Austrian hands. By the same treaty Venice secured\r\npossession of the whole of Dalmatia, where it had already gained\r\nterritory by the Treaty of Curlowitz in 1699.\r\n\r\nBut the Serbs soon found out that alien populations fare little better\r\nunder Christian rule, when they are not of the same confession as their\r\nrulers, than under Mohammedan. The Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia suffered\r\nthenceforward from relentless persecution at the hands of the Roman\r\nCatholics. In Austria-Hungary too, and in that part of Serbia occupied\r\nby the Austrians after 1718, the Serbs discovered that the Austrians,\r\nwhen they had beaten the Turks largely by the help of Serbian levies,\r\nwere very different from the Austrians who had encouraged the Serbs to\r\nsettle in their country and form military colonies on their frontiers\r\nto protect them from Turkish invasion. The privileges promised them\r\nwhen their help had been necessary were disregarded as soon as their\r\nservices could be dispensed with. Austrian rule soon became more\r\noppressive than Turkish, and to the Serbs’ other woes was now added\r\nreligious persecution. The result of all this was that a\r\ncounter-emigration set in and the Serbs actually began to return to\r\ntheir old homes in Turkey. Another war between Austria-Hungary and\r\nTurkey broke out in 1737, in which the Austrians were unsuccessful.\r\nPrince Eugen no longer led them, and though the Serbs were again\r\npersuaded by their Patriarch, Arsen IV, to rise against the Turks, they\r\nonly did so half-heartedly. By the Treaty of Belgrade, in 1739, Austria\r\nhad to withdraw north of the Save and Danube, evacuating all northern\r\nSerbia in favour of the Turks. From this time onwards the lot of the\r\nSerbs, both in Austria-Hungary and in Turkey, went rapidly from bad to\r\nworse. The Turks, as the power of their empire declined, and in return\r\nfor the numerous Serb revolts, had recourse to measures of severe\r\nrepression; amongst others was that of the final abolition of the\r\nPatriarchate of Peé in 1766, whereupon the control of the Serbian\r\nChurch in Turkey passed entirely into the hands of the Greek\r\nPatriarchate of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government similarly, perceiving now for the first time\r\nthe elements of danger which the resuscitation of the Serbian\r\nnationality would contain for the rule of the Hapsburgs, embarked on a\r\nsystematic persecution of the Orthodox Serbs in southern Hungary and\r\nSlavonia. During the reign of Maria Theresa (1740-80), whose policy was\r\nto conciliate the Magyars, the military frontier zone was abolished, a\r\nseries of repressive measures was passed against those Serbs who\r\nrefused to become Roman Catholics, and the Serbian nationality was\r\nrefused official recognition. The consequence of this persecution was a\r\nseries of revolts which were all quelled with due severity, and finally\r\nthe emigration of a hundred thousand Serbs to southern Russia, where\r\nthey founded New Serbia in 1752-3.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of Joseph II (1780-90) and Leopold II (1790-2) their\r\ntreatment at the hands of the Magyars somewhat improved. From the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century Montenegro began to assume greater\r\nimportance in the extremely gradual revival of the national spirit of\r\nthe Serbs. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it had formed\r\npart of the Turkish dominions, though, thanks to the inaccessible\r\nnature of its mountain fastnesses, Turkish authority was never very\r\nforcibly asserted. It was ruled by a prince-bishop, and its religious\r\nindependence thus connoted a certain secular freedom of thought if not\r\nof action. In the seventeenth century warlike encounters between the\r\nTurks and the Montenegrins increased in frequency, and the latter tried\r\nto enlist the help of Venice on their side but with indifferent\r\nsuccess. The fighting in Montenegro was often rather civil in\r\ncharacter, being caused by the ill-feeling which existed between the\r\nnumerous Montenegrins who had become Mohammedans and those who remained\r\nfaithful to their national Church. In the course of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the rôle which fell to Montenegro became more important. In all\r\nthe other Serb countries the families which naturally took a leading\r\npart in affairs were either extinct or in exile, as in Serbia, or had\r\nbecome Mohammedan, and therefore to all intents and purposes Turkish,\r\nas in Bosnia and Hercegovina. Ragusa, since the great earthquake in\r\n1667, had greatly declined in power and was no longer of international\r\nimportance. In Montenegro, on the other hand, there had survived both a\r\ngreater independence of spirit (Montenegro was, after all, the ancient\r\nZeta, and had always been a centre of national life) and a number of at\r\nany rate eugenic if not exactly aristocratic Serb families; these\r\nfamilies naturally looked on themselves and on their bishop as destined\r\nto play an important part in the resistance to and the eventual\r\noverthrow of the Turkish dominion. The prince-bishop had to be\r\nconsecrated by the Patriarch of Peć, and in 1700 Patriarch Arsen III\r\nconsecrated one Daniel, of the house (which has been ever since then\r\nand is now still the reigning dynasty of Montenegro) of\r\nPetrović-Njegoš, to this office, after he had been elected to it by the\r\ncouncil of notables at Cetinje. Montenegro, isolated from the Serbs in\r\nthe north, and precluded from participating with them in the wars\r\nbetween Austria and Turkey by the intervening block of Bosnia, which\r\nthough Serb by nationality was solidly Mohammedan and therefore\r\npro-Turkish, carried on its feuds with the Turks independently of the\r\nother Serbs. But when Peter the Great initiated his anti-Turkish\r\npolicy, and, in combination with the expansion of Russia to the south\r\nand west, began to champion the cause of the Balkan Christians, he\r\ndeveloped intercourse with Montenegro and laid the foundation of that\r\nfriendship between the vast Russian Empire and the tiny Serb\r\nprincipality on the Adriatic which has been a quaint and persistent\r\nfeature of eastern European politics ever since. This intimacy did not\r\nprevent the Turks giving Montenegro many hard blows whenever they had\r\nthe time or energy to do so, and did not ensure any special protective\r\nclauses in favour of the mountain state whenever the various treaties\r\nbetween Russia and Turkey were concluded. Its effect was rather\r\npsychological and financial. From the time when the _Vladika_ (=\r\nBishop) Daniel first visited Peter the Great, in 1714, the rulers of\r\nMontenegro often made pilgrimages to the Russian capital, and were\r\nalways sure of finding sympathy as well as pecuniary if not armed\r\nsupport. Bishops in the Orthodox Church are compulsorily celibate, and\r\nthe succession in Montenegro always descended from uncle to nephew.\r\nWhen Peter I Petrović-Njegoš succeeded, in 1782, the Patriarchate of\r\nPeć was no more, so he had to get permission from the Austrian Emperor\r\nJoseph II to be consecrated by the Metropolitan of Karlovci\r\n(Carlowitz), who was then head of the Serbian national Church.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time (1787) an alliance was made between Russia and\r\nAustria-Hungary to make war together on Turkey and divide the spoils\r\nbetween them. Although a great rising against Turkey was organised at\r\nthe same time (1788) in the district of Šumadija, in Serbia, by a\r\nnumber of Serb patriots, of whom Kara-George was one and a certain\r\nCaptain Koča, after whom the whole war is called Kočina Krajina\r\n(=Koča’s country), another, yet the Austrians were on the whole\r\nunsuccessful, and on the death of Joseph II, in 1790, a peace was\r\nconcluded between Austria and Turkey at Svishtov, in Bulgaria, by which\r\nTurkey retained the whole of Bosnia and Serbia, and the Save and Danube\r\nremained the frontier between the two countries. Meanwhile the Serbs of\r\nMontenegro had joined in the fray and had fared better, inflicting some\r\nunpleasant defeats on the Turks under their bishop, Peter I. These\r\nculminated in two battles in 1796 (the Montenegrins, not being\r\nmentioned in the treaty of peace, had continued fighting), in which the\r\nTurks were driven back to Scutari. With this triumph, which the Emperor\r\nPaul of Russia signalized by decorating the Prince-Bishop Peter, the\r\nindependence of the modern state of Montenegro, the first Serb people\r\nto recover its liberty, was _de facto_ established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n_The Liberation of Serbia under Kara-George_ (1804–13) _and Miloš\r\nObrenović_ (1815–30): 1796–1830\r\n\r\n\r\nThe liberation of Serbia from the Turkish dominion and its\r\nestablishment as an independent state were matters of much slower and\r\nmore arduous accomplishment than were the same processes in the other\r\nBalkan countries. One reason for this was that Serbia by its peculiar\r\ngeographical position was cut off from outside help. It was easy for\r\nthe western powers to help Greece with their fleets, and for Russia to\r\nhelp Rumania and, later, Bulgaria directly with its army, because\r\ncommunication between them was easy. But Serbia on the one hand was\r\nseparated from the sea, first by Dalmatia, which was always in foreign\r\npossession, and then by Bosnia, Hercegovina, and the _sandjak_ (or\r\nprovince) of Novi-Pazar, all of which territories, though ethnically\r\nSerb, were strongholds of Turkish influence owing to their large\r\nMohammedan population. The energies of Montenegro, also cut off from\r\nthe sea by Dalmatia and Turkey, were absorbed in self-defence, though\r\nit gave Serbia all the support which its size permitted. Communication,\r\non the other hand, between Russia and Serbia was too difficult to\r\npermit of military help being rapidly and effectively brought to bear\r\nupon the Turks from that quarter. Bessarabia, Wallachia, and Moldavia\r\nwere then still under Turkish control, and either they had to be\r\ntraversed or the Danube had to be navigated from its mouth upwards\r\nthrough Turkish territory. The only country which could have helped\r\nSerbia was Austria, but as it was against their best interests to do\r\nso, the Austrians naturally did all they could not to advance, but to\r\nretard the Serbian cause. As a result of all this Serbia, in her long\r\nstruggle against the Turks, had to rely principally on its own\r\nresources, though Russian diplomacy several times saved the renascent\r\ncountry from disaster.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the slowness of the emancipation and development of\r\nmodern Serbia has been the proneness of its people to internal\r\ndissension. There was no national dynasty on whom the leadership of the\r\ncountry would naturally devolve after the first successful revolution\r\nagainst Turkish rule, there was not even any aristocracy left, and no\r\nforeign ruler was ever asked for by the Serbs or was ever imposed on\r\nthem by the other nations as in the case of Greece, Rumania, and\r\nBulgaria. On the other hand the rising against Turkey was a rising of\r\nthe whole people, and it was almost inevitable that as soon as some\r\nmeasure of independence was gained the unity the Serbs had shown when\r\nfighting against their oppressors should dissolve and be replaced by\r\nbitter rivalries and disputes amongst the various local leaders who had\r\nbecome prominent during the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThese rivalries early in the nineteenth century resolved themselves\r\ninto a blood-feud between two families, the Karagjorgjević and the\r\nObrenović, a quarrel that filled Serbian history and militated against\r\nthe progress of the Serb people throughout the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe same reasons which restricted the growth of the political\r\nindependence of Serbia have also impeded, or rather made impossible,\r\nits economic development and material prosperity. Until recent years\r\nAustria-Hungary and Turkey between them held Serbia territorially in\r\nsuch a position that whenever Serbia either demurred at its neighbours’\r\ntariffs or wished to retaliate by means of its own, the screw was\r\nimmediately applied and economic strangulation threatened. Rumania and\r\nBulgaria economically could never be of help to Serbia, because the\r\nproducts and the requirements of all three are identical, and Rumania\r\nand Bulgaria cannot be expected to facilitate the sale of their\r\nneighbours’ live stock and cereals, when their first business is to\r\nsell their own, while the cost of transit of imports from western\r\nEurope through those countries is prohibitive.\r\n\r\nAfter the unsuccessful rebellion of 1788, already mentioned, Serbia\r\nremained in a state of pseudo-quiescence for some years. Meanwhile the\r\nauthority of the Sultan in Serbia was growing ever weaker and the real\r\npower was wielded by local Turkish officials, who exploited the\r\ncountry, looked on it as their own property, and enjoyed\r\nsemi-independence. Their exactions and cruelties were worse than had\r\nbeen those of the Turks in the old days, and it was against them and\r\ntheir troops, not against those of the Sultan, that the first battles\r\nin the Serbian war of independence were fought. It was during the year\r\n1803 that the Serbian leaders first made definite plans for the rising\r\nwhich eventually took place in the following year. The ringleader was\r\nGeorge Petrović, known as Black George, or Kara-George, and amongst his\r\nconfederates was Miloš Obrenović. The centre of the conspiracy was at\r\nTopola, in the district of Šumadija in central Serbia (between the\r\nMorava and the Drina rivers), the native place of Kara-George. The\r\nfirst two years of fighting between the Serbians and, first, the\r\nprovincial janissaries, and, later, the Sultan’s forces, fully rewarded\r\nthe bravery and energy of the insurgents. By the beginning of 1807 they\r\nhad virtually freed all northern Serbia by their own unaided efforts\r\nand captured the towns of Požarevac, Smederevo, Belgrade, and Šabac.\r\nThe year 1804 is also notable as the date of the formal opening of\r\ndiplomatic relations directly between Serbia and Russia. At this time\r\nthe Emperor Alexander I was too preoccupied with Napoleon to be able to\r\nthreaten the Sultan (Austerlitz took place in November 1805), but he\r\ngave the Serbs financial assistance and commended their cause to the\r\nespecial care of his ambassador at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 war again broke out between Russia and Turkey, but after the\r\nPeace of Tilsit (June 1807) fighting ceased also between the Turks and\r\nthe Russians and the Serbs, not before the Russians had won several\r\nsuccesses against the Turks on the Lower Danube. It was during the two\r\nfollowing years of peace that dissensions first broke out amongst the\r\nSerbian leaders; fighting the Turks was the sole condition of existence\r\nwhich prevented them fighting each other. In 1809-10 Russia and the\r\nSerbs again fought the Turks, at first without success, but later with\r\nbetter fortune. In 1811 Kara-George was elected _Gospodar_, or\r\nsovereign, by a popular assembly, but Serbia still remained a Turkish\r\nprovince. At the end of that year the Russians completely defeated the\r\nTurks at Rustchuk in Bulgaria, and, if all had gone well, Serbia might\r\nthere and then have achieved complete independence.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon was already preparing his invasion and Russia had to\r\nconclude peace with Turkey in a hurry, which necessarily implied that\r\nthe Sultan obtained unduly favourable terms. In the Treaty of Bucarest\r\nbetween the two countries signed in May 1812, the Serbs were indeed\r\nmentioned, and promised vague internal autonomy and a general amnesty,\r\nbut all the fortified towns they had captured were to be returned to\r\nthe Turks, and the few Russian troops who had been helping the Serbs in\r\nSerbia had to withdraw. Negotiations between the Turks and the Serbs\r\nfor the regulation of their position were continued throughout 1812,\r\nbut finally the Turks refused all their claims and conditions and,\r\nseeing the European powers preoccupied with their own affairs, invaded\r\nthe country from Bosnia in the west, and also from the east and south,\r\nin August 1813. The Serbs, left entirely to their own resources,\r\nsuccumbed before the superior forces of the Turks, and by the beginning\r\nof October the latter were again masters of the whole country and in\r\npossession of Belgrade. Meanwhile Kara-George, broken in health and\r\nunable to cope with the difficulties of the situation, which demanded\r\nsuccessful strategy both against the overwhelming forces of the Turks\r\nin the field and against the intrigues of his enemies at home, somewhat\r\nignominiously fled across the river to Semlin in Hungary, and was duly\r\nincarcerated by the Austrian authorities.\r\n\r\nThe news of Napoleon’s defeat at Leipsic (October 1813) arrived just\r\nafter that of the re-occupation of Belgrade by the Turks, damped\r\n_feu-de-joie_ which they were firing at Constantinople, and made them\r\nrather more conciliatory and lenient to the Serbian rebels. But this\r\nattitude did not last long, and the Serbs soon had reason to make fresh\r\nefforts to regain their short-lived liberty. The Congress of Vienna met\r\nin the autumn of 1814, and during its whole course Serbian emissaries\r\ngave the Russian envoys no peace. But with the return of Napoleon to\r\nFrance in the spring of 1815 and the break-up of the Congress, all that\r\nRussia could do was, through its ambassador at Constantinople, to\r\nthreaten invasion unless the Turks left the Serbs alone. Nevertheless,\r\nconditions in Serbia became so intolerable that another rebellion soon\r\ntook shape, this time under Miloš Obrenović. This leader was no less\r\npatriotic than his rival, Kara-George, but he was far more able and a\r\nconsummate diplomat. Kara-George had possessed indomitable courage,\r\nenergy, and will-power, but he could not temporize, and his arbitrary\r\nmethods of enforcing discipline and his ungovernable temper had made\r\nhim many enemies. While the credit for the first Serbian revolt\r\n(1804-13) undoubtedly belongs chiefly to him, the second revolt owed\r\nits more lasting success to the skill of Miloš Obrenović. The fighting\r\nstarted at Takovo, the home of the Obrenović family, in April 1815, and\r\nafter many astonishing successes against the Turks, including the\r\ncapture of the towns of Rudnik, Čačak, Požarevac, and Kraljevo, was all\r\nover by July of the same year. The Turks were ready with large armies\r\nin the west in Bosnia, and also south of the Morava river, to continue\r\nthe campaign and crush the rebellion, but the news of the final defeat\r\nof Napoleon, and the knowledge that Russia would soon have time again\r\nto devote attention to the Balkans, withheld their appetites for\r\nrevenge, and negotiations with the successful rebels were initiated.\r\nDuring the whole of this period, from 1813 onwards, Miloš Obrenović, as\r\nhead of a district, was an official of the Sultan in Serbia, and it was\r\none of his principles never to break irreparably with the Turks, who\r\nwere still suzerains of the country. At the same time, owing to his\r\nskill and initiative he was recognized as the only real leader of the\r\nmovement for independence. From the cessation of the rebellion in 1815\r\nonwards he himself personally conducted negotiations in the name of his\r\npeople with the various pashas who were deputed to deal with him. While\r\nthese negotiations went on and the armistice was in force, he was\r\nconfronted, or rather harassed from behind, by a series of revolts\r\nagainst his growing authority on the part of his jealous compatriots.\r\n\r\nIn June 1817 Kara-George, who had been in Russia after being released\r\nby the Austrians in 1814, returned surreptitiously to Serbia,\r\nencouraged by the brighter aspect which affairs in his country seemed\r\nto be assuming. But the return of his most dangerous rival was as\r\nunwelcome to Miloš as it was to the Turkish authorities at Belgrade,\r\nand, measures having been concerted between them, Kara-George was\r\nmurdered on July 26,1817, and the first act in the blood-feud between\r\nthe two families thus committed. In November of the same year a\r\n_skupština_, or national assembly, was held at Belgrade, and Miloš\r\nObrenović, whose position was already thoroughly assured, was elected\r\nhereditary prince (_knez_) of the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events of considerable importance for the future of the Serb\r\nrace had been happening elsewhere. Dalmatia, the whole of which had\r\nbeen in the possession of Venice since the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699,\r\npassed into the hands of Austria by the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797,\r\nwhen the Venetian republic was extinguished by Napoleon. The Bocche di\r\nCuttaro, a harbour both strategically and commercially of immense\r\nvalue, which had in the old days belonged to the Serb principality of\r\nZeta or Montenegro, and is its only natural outlet on the Adriatic,\r\nlikewise became Venetian in 1699 and Austrian in 1797, one year after\r\nthe successful rebellion of the Montenegrins against the Turks.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Pressburg between France and Austria Dalmatia became\r\nFrench in 1805. But the Montenegrins, supported by the Russians,\r\nresisted the new owners and occupied the Bocche; at the Peace of Tilsit\r\nin 1807, however, this important place was assigned to France by\r\nRussia, and Montenegro had to submit to its loss. In 1806 the French\r\noccupied Ragusa, and in 1808 abolished the independence of the ancient\r\nSerb city-republic. In 1812 the Montenegrins, helped by the Russians\r\nand British, again expelled the French and reoccupied Cattaro; but\r\nAustria was by now fully alive to the meaning this harbour would have\r\nonce it was in the possession of Montenegro, and after the Congress of\r\nVienna in 1815 took definitive possession of it as well as of all the\r\nrest of Dalmatia, thus effecting the complete exclusion of the Serb\r\nrace for all political and commercial purposes from the Adriatic, its\r\nmost natural and obvious means of communication with western Europe.\r\n\r\nThough Miloš had been elected prince by his own people, it was long\r\nbefore he was recognized as such by the Porte. His efforts for the\r\nregularization of his position entailed endless negotiations in\r\nConstantinople; these were enlivened by frequent anti-Obrenović revolts\r\nin Serbia, all of which Miloš successfully quelled. The revolution in\r\nGreece in 1821 threw the Serbian question from the international point\r\nof view into the shade, but the Emperor Nicholas I, who succeeded his\r\nbrother Alexander I on the Russian throne in 1825, soon showed that he\r\ntook a lively and active interest in Balkan affairs. Pan-Slavism had\r\nscarcely become fashionable in those days, and it was still rather as\r\nthe protector of its co-religionists under the Crescent that Russia\r\nintervened. In 1826 Russian and Turkish delegates met at Akerman in\r\nBessarabia, and in September of that year signed a convention by which\r\nthe Russian protectorate over the Serbs was recognized, the Serbs were\r\ngranted internal autonomy, the right to trade and erect churches,\r\nschools, and printing-presses, and the Turks were forbidden to live in\r\nSerbia except in eight garrison towns; the garrisons were to be\r\nTurkish, and tribute was still to be paid to the Sultan as suzerain.\r\nThese concessions, announced by Prince Miloš to his people at a special\r\n_skupština_ held at Kragujevac in 1827, evoked great enthusiasm, but\r\nthe urgency of the Greek question again delayed their fulfilment. After\r\nthe battle of Navarino on October 20, 1827, in which the British,\r\nFrench, and Russian fleets defeated the Turkish, the Turks became\r\nobstinate and refused to carry out the stipulations of the Convention\r\nof Akerman in favour of Serbia. Thereupon Russia declared war on Turkey\r\nin April 1828, and the Russian armies crossed the Danube and the\r\nBalkans and marched on Constantinople.\r\n\r\nPeace was concluded at Adrianople in 1829, and Turkey agreed to carry\r\nout immediately all the stipulations of the Treaty of Bucarest (1812)\r\nand the Convention of Akerman (1826). The details took some time to\r\nsettle, but in November 1830 the _hatti-sherif_ of the Sultan,\r\nacknowledging Miloš as hereditary prince of Serbia, was publicly read\r\nin Belgrade. All the concessions already promised were duly granted,\r\nand Serbia became virtually independent, but still tributary to the\r\nSultan. Its territory included most of the northern part of the modern\r\nkingdom of Serbia, between the rivers Drina, Save, Danube, and Timok,\r\nbut not the districts of Nish, Vranja, and Pirot. Turkey still retained\r\nBosnia and Hercegovina, Macedonia, the _sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar, which\r\nseparated Serbia from Montenegro, and Old Serbia (northern Macedonia).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n_The Throes of Regeneration: Independent Serbia,_ 1830–1903\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his rule of Serbia, which lasted virtually from 1817 till 1839,\r\nPrince Miloš did a very great deal for the welfare of his country. He\r\nemancipated the Serbian Church from the trammels of the Greek\r\nPatriarchate of Constantinople in 1831, from which date onwards it was\r\nruled by a Metropolitan of Serb nationality, resident at Belgrade. He\r\nencouraged the trade of the country, a great deal of which he held in\r\nhis own hands; he was in fact a sort of prototype of those modern\r\nBalkan business-kings of whom King George of Greece and King Carol of\r\nRumania were the most notable examples. He raised an army and put it on\r\na permanent footing, and organized the construction of roads, schools,\r\nand churches. He was, however, an autocratic ruler of the old school,\r\nand he had no inclination to share the power for the attainment of\r\nwhich he had laboured so many years and gone through so much. From his\r\ndefinite installation as hereditary prince discontent at his arbitrary\r\nmethods of government amongst his ex-equals increased, and after\r\nseveral revolts he was forced eventually to grant a constitution in\r\n1835. This, however, remained a dead letter, and things went on as\r\nbefore. Later in the same year he paid a prolonged visit to his\r\nsuzerain at Constantinople, and while he was there the situation in\r\nSerbia became still more serious. After his return he was, after\r\nseveral years of delay and of growing unpopularity, compelled to agree\r\nto another constitution which was forced on him, paradoxically enough,\r\nby the joint efforts of the Tsar and of the Sultan, who seemed to take\r\nan unnatural pleasure in supporting the democratic Serbians against\r\ntheir successful colleague in autocracy, who had done so much for his\r\nturbulent subjects. Serbia even in those days was essentially and\r\nuncompromisingly democratic, but even so Miloš obstinately refused to\r\ncarry out the provisions of the constitution or in any way to submit to\r\na curtailment of his power, and in 1839 he left his ungrateful\r\nprincipality and took refuge in Rumania, where he possessed an estate,\r\nabdicating in favour of his elder son Milan. This Prince Milan, known\r\nas Obrenović II, was seriously ill at the time of his accession, and\r\ndied within a month of it. He was succeeded by his younger brother\r\nMichael, known as Obrenović III, who was then only sixteen years of\r\nage. This prince, though young, had a good head on his shoulders, and\r\neventually proved the most gifted ruler modern Serbia has ever had. His\r\nfirst reign (1840-2), however, did not open well. He inaugurated it by\r\npaying a state visit to Constantinople, but the Sultan only recognized\r\nhim as elective prince and insisted on his having two advisers approved\r\nand appointed by the Porte. Michael on his return showed his\r\ndetermination to have nothing to do with them, but this led to a\r\nrebellion headed by one of them, Vučić, and, though Michael’s rule was\r\nnot as arbitrary as his father’s, he had to bow to the popular will\r\nwhich supported Vučić and cross the river to Semlin. After a stormy\r\ninterval, during which the Emperor Nicholas I tried to intervene in\r\nfavour of Michael, Alexander Karagjorgjević, son of Kara-George, was\r\nelected prince (1843). No sooner was this representative of the rival\r\ndynasty installed, however, than rebellions in favour of Michael\r\noccurred. These were thrown into the shade by the events of 1848, In\r\nthat memorable year of revolutions the Magyars rose against Austria and\r\nthe Serbs in southern Hungary rose against the Magyars. Prince\r\nAlexander resolved to send military help to his oppressed countrymen\r\nnorth of the Save and Danube, and, though the insurgents were\r\nunsuccessful, Prince Alexander gained in popularity amongst the Serbs\r\nby the line of action he had taken. During the Crimean War, on the\r\nother hand, Serbia remained strictly neutral, to the annoyance of the\r\nTsar; at the Congress of Paris (1856) the exclusive protectorate of\r\nRussia was replaced by one of all the powers, and Russian influence in\r\nthe western Balkans was thereby weakened. Prince Alexander’s prudence,\r\nmoreover, cost him his popularity, and in 1858 he in his turn had to\r\nbid farewell to his difficult countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn December of the same year the veteran Prince Miloš Obrenović I was\r\nrecalled to power as hereditary prince. His activities during his\r\nsecond reign were directed against Turkish influence, which was still\r\nstrong, and he made efforts to have the Turkish populations removed\r\nfrom the eight garrison towns, including Belgrade, where they still\r\nlived in spite of the fact that their emigration had been stipulated\r\nfor in 1830. Unfortunately he did not live long enough to carry out his\r\nplans, for he fell ill at Topchider, the summer palace near Belgrade,\r\nin the autumn of 1860, and died a few days afterwards. He was again\r\nsucceeded by his son Michael Obrenović III, who was already thirty-six\r\nyears of age. This able prince’s second reign was brilliantly\r\nsuccessful, and it was a disaster for which his foolish countrymen had\r\nto pay dearly, when, by their fault, it was prematurely cut short in\r\n1868. His first act was with the consent of a specially summoned\r\n_skupština_ to abolish the law by which he could only appoint and\r\nremove his counsellers with the approval of the Porte. Next he set\r\nabout the organization and establishment of a regular army of 30,000\r\nmen. In 1862 an anti-Turkish rebellion broke out amongst the Serbs in\r\nHercegovina (still, with Bosnia, a Turkish province), and the Porte,\r\naccusing Prince Michael of complicity, made warlike preparations\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nEvents, however, were precipitated in such a way that, without waiting\r\nfor the opening of hostilities, the Turkish general in command of the\r\nfortress of Belgrade turned his guns on the city; this provoked the\r\nintervention of the powers at Constantinople, and the entire civilian\r\nTurkish population had to quit the country (in accordance with the\r\nstipulations of 1830), only Turkish garrisons remaining in the\r\nfortresses of Šabac, Belgrade, Smederevo, and Kladovo, along the\r\nnorthern river frontier, still theoretically the boundary of the\r\nSultan’s dominions. After this success Prince Michael continued his\r\nmilitary preparations in order to obtain final possession of the\r\nfortresses when a suitable occasion should arise. This occurred in\r\n1866, when Austria was engaged in the struggle with Prussia, and the\r\npolicy of Great Britain became less Turcophil than it had hitherto\r\nbeen. On April 6, 1867, the four fortresses, which had been in Serbian\r\npossession from 1804 to 1813, but had since then been garrisoned by the\r\nTurks, were delivered over to Serbia and the last Turkish soldier left\r\nSerbian soil without a shot having been fired. Though Serbia after this\r\nwas still a vassal state, being tributary to the Sultan, these further\r\nsteps on the road to complete independence were a great triumph,\r\nespecially for Prince Michael personally. But this very triumph\r\nactuated his political opponents amongst his own countrymen, amongst\r\nwhom were undoubtedly adherents of the rival dynasty, to revenge, and\r\nblind to the interests of their people they foolishly and most brutally\r\nmurdered this extremely capable and conscientious prince in the deer\r\npark near Topchider on June 10, 1868. The opponents of the Obrenović\r\ndynasty were, however, baulked in their plans, and a cousin of the late\r\nprince was elected to the vacant and difficult position. This ruler,\r\nknown as Milan Obrenović IV, who was only fourteen years of age at the\r\ntime of his accession (1868), was of a very different character from\r\nhis predecessor. The first thing that happened during his minority was\r\nthe substitution of the constitution of 1838 by another one which was\r\nmeant to give the prince and the national assembly much more power, but\r\nwhich, eventually, made the ministers supreme.\r\n\r\nThe prince came of age in 1872 when he was eighteen, and he soon showed\r\nthat the potential pleasures to be derived from his position were far\r\nmore attractive to him than the fulfilment of its obvious duties. He\r\nfound much to occupy him in Vienna and Paris and but little in\r\nBelgrade. At the same time the Serb people had lost, largely by its own\r\nfaults, much of the respect and sympathy which it had acquired in\r\nEurope during Prince Michael’s reign. In 1875 a formidable anti-Turkish\r\ninsurrection (the last of many) broke out amongst the Serbs of Bosnia\r\nand Hercegovina, and all the efforts of the Turks to quell it were\r\nunavailing. In June 1876 Prince Milan was forced by the pressure of\r\npublic opinion to declare war on Turkey in support of the ‘unredeemed’\r\nSerbs of Bosnia, and Serbia was joined by Montenegro. The country was,\r\nhowever, not materially prepared for war, the expected sympathetic\r\nrisings in other parts of Turkey either did not take place or failed,\r\nand the Turks turned their whole army on to Serbia, with the result\r\nthat in October the Serbs had to appeal to the Tsar for help and an\r\narmistice was arranged, which lasted till February 1877. During the\r\nwinter a conference was held in Constantinople to devise means for\r\nalleviating the lot of the Christians in Turkey, and a peace was\r\narranged between Turkey and Serbia whereby the _status quo ante_ was\r\nrestored. But after the conference the heart of Turkey was again\r\nhardened and the stipulations in favour of the Christians were not\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Russia declared war on Turkey (cf. chap. 10), and in the autumn\r\nof the same year Serbia joined in. This time the armies of Prince Milan\r\nwere more successful, and conquered and occupied the whole of southern\r\nSerbia including the towns and districts of Nish, Pirot, Vranja, and\r\nLeskovac, Montenegro, which had not been included in the peace of the\r\nprevious winter, but had been fighting desperately and continuously\r\nagainst the Turks ever since it had begun actively to help the Serb\r\nrebels of Hercegovina in 1875, had a series of successes, as a result\r\nof which it obtained possession of the important localities of Nikšić,\r\nPodgorica, Budua, Antivari, and Dulcigno, the last three on the shore\r\nof the Adriatic. By the Treaty of San Stefano the future interests of\r\nboth Serbia and Montenegro were jeopardised by the creation of a Great\r\nBulgaria, but that would not have mattered if in return they had been\r\ngiven control of the purely Serb provinces of Bosnia and Hercegovina,\r\nwhich ethnically they can claim just as legitimately as Bulgaria claims\r\nmost of Macedonia. The Treaty of San Stefano was, however, soon\r\nreplaced by that of Berlin. By its terms both Serbia and Montenegro\r\nachieved complete independence and the former ceased to be a tributary\r\nstate of Turkey. The Serbs were given the districts of southern Serbia\r\nwhich they had occupied, and which are all ethnically Serb except\r\nPirot, the population of which is a sort of cross between Serb and\r\nBulgar. The Serbs also undertook to build a railway through their\r\ncountry to the Turkish and Bulgarian frontiers. Montenegro was nearly\r\ndoubled in size, receiving the districts of Nikšić, Podgorica, and\r\nothers; certain places in the interior the Turks and Albanians\r\nabsolutely refused to surrender, and to compensate for these Montenegro\r\nwas given a strip of coast with the townlets of Antivari and Dulcigno.\r\nThe memory of Gladstone, who specially espoused Montenegro’s cause in\r\nthis matter, is held in the greatest reverence in the brave little\r\nmountain country, but unfortunately the ports themselves are\r\neconomically absolutely useless. Budua, higher up the Dalmatian coast,\r\nwhich would have been of some use, was handed over to Austria, to which\r\ncountry, already possessed of Cattaro and all the rest of Dalmatia, it\r\nwas quite superfluous. Greatest tragedy of all for the future of the\r\nSerb race, the administration of Bosnia and Hercegovina was handed over\r\n‘temporarily’ to Austria-Hungary, and Austrian garrisons were quartered\r\nthroughout those two provinces, which they were able to occupy only\r\nafter the most bitter armed opposition on the part of the inhabitants,\r\nand also in the Turkish _sandjak_ or province of Novi-Pazar, the\r\nancient Raska and cradle of the Serb state; this strip of mountainous\r\nterritory under Turkish administrative and Austrian military control\r\nwas thus converted into a fortified wedge which effectually kept the\r\ntwo independent Serb states of Serbia and Montenegro apart. After all\r\nthese events the Serbs had to set to work to put their enlarged house\r\nin order. But the building of railways and schools and the organization\r\nof the services cost a lot of money, and as public economy is not a\r\nSerbian virtue the debt grew rapidly. In 1882 Serbia proclaimed itself\r\na kingdom and was duly recognized by the other nations. But King Milan\r\ndid not learn to manage the affairs of his country any better as time\r\nwent on. He was too weak to stand alone, and having freed himself from\r\nTurkey he threw himself into the arms of Austria, with which country he\r\nconcluded a secret military convention. In 1885, when Bulgaria and\r\n‘Eastern Rumelia’ successfully coalesced and Bulgaria thereby received\r\na considerable increase of territory and power, the Serbs, prompted by\r\njealousy, began to grow restless, and King Milan, at the instigation of\r\nAustria, foolishly declared war on Prince Alexander of Battenberg. This\r\nspeedily ended in the disastrous battle of Slivnitsa (cf. chap. II);\r\nAustria had to intervene to save its victim, and Serbia got nothing for\r\nits trouble but a large increase of debt and a considerable decrease of\r\nmilitary reputation. In addition to all this King Milan was unfortunate\r\nin his conjugal relations; his wife, the beautiful Queen Natalie, was a\r\nRussian, and as he himself had Austrian sympathies, they could scarcely\r\nbe expected to agree on politics. But the strife between them extended\r\nfrom the sphere of international to that of personal sympathies and\r\nantipathies. King Milan was promiscuous in affairs of the heart and\r\nQueen Natalie was jealous. Scenes of domestic discord were frequent and\r\nviolent, and the effect of this atmosphere on the character of their\r\nonly child Alexander, who was born in 1876, was naturally bad.\r\n\r\nThe king, who had for some years been very popular with, his subjects\r\nwith all his failings, lost his hold on the country after the\r\nunfortunate war of 1885, and the partisans of the rival dynasty began\r\nto be hopeful once more. In 1888 King Milan gave Serbia a very much\r\nmore liberal constitution, by which the ministers were for the first\r\ntime made really responsible to the _skupština_ or national assembly,\r\nreplacing that of 1869, and the following year, worried by his\r\npolitical and domestic failures, discredited and unpopular both at home\r\nand abroad, he resigned in favour of his son Alexander, then aged\r\nthirteen. This boy, who had been brought up in what may be called a\r\npermanent storm-centre, both domestic and political, was placed under a\r\nregency, which included M. Ristić, with a radical ministry under M.\r\nPašić, an extremely able and patriotic statesman of pro-Russian\r\nsympathies, who ever since he first became prominent in 1877 had been\r\ngrowing in power and influence. But trouble did not cease with the\r\nabdication of King Milan. He and his wife played Box and Cox at\r\nBelgrade for the next four years, quarrelling and being reconciled,\r\nintriguing and fighting round the throne and person of their son. At\r\nlast both parents agreed to leave the country and give the unfortunate\r\nyouth a chance. King Milan settled in Vienna, Queen Natalie in\r\nBiarritz. In 1893 King Alexander suddenly declared himself of age and\r\narrested all his ministers and regents one evening while they were\r\ndining with him. The next year he abrogated the constitution of 1888,\r\nunder which party warfare in the Serbian parliament had been bitter and\r\nuninterrupted, obstructing any real progress, and restored that of\r\n1869. Ever since 1889 (the date of the accession of the German Emperor)\r\nBerlin had taken more interest in Serbian affairs, and it has been\r\nalleged that it was William II who, through the wife of the Rumanian\r\nminister at his court, who was sister of Queen Natalie, influenced King\r\nAlexander in his abrupt and ill-judged decisions. It was certainly\r\nGerman policy to weaken and discredit Serbia and to further Austrian\r\ninfluence at Belgrade at the expense of that of Russia. King Milan\r\nreturned for a time to Belgrade in 1897, and the reaction, favourable\r\nto Austria, which had begun in 1894, increased during his presence and\r\nunder the ministry of Dr. Vladan Gjorgjević, which lasted from 1897\r\ntill 1900. This state of repression caused unrest throughout the\r\ncountry. All its energies were absorbed in fruitless political party\r\nstrife, and no material or moral progress was possible. King Alexander,\r\ndistracted, solitary, and helpless in the midst of this unending welter\r\nof political intrigue, committed an extremely imprudent act in the\r\nsummer of 1900. Having gone for much-needed relaxation to see his\r\nmother at Biarritz, he fell violently in love with her lady in waiting,\r\nMadame Draga Mašin, the divorced wife of a Serbian officer. Her\r\nsomewhat equivocal past was in King Alexander’s eyes quite eclipsed by\r\nher great beauty and her wit, which had not been impaired by conjugal\r\ninfelicity. Although she was thirty-two, and he only twenty-four, he\r\ndetermined to marry her, and the desperate opposition of his parents,\r\nhis army, his ministers, and his people, based principally on the fact\r\nthat the woman was known to be incapable of child-birth, only\r\nprecipitated the accomplishment of his intention. This unfortunate and\r\nheadstrong action on the part of the young king, who, though deficient\r\nin tact and intuition, had plenty of energy and was by no means stupid,\r\nmight have been forgiven him by his people if, as was at first thought\r\npossible, it had restored internal peace and prosperity in the country\r\nand thereby enabled it to prepare itself to take a part in the solution\r\no£ those foreign questions which vitally affected Serb interests and\r\nwere already looming on the horizon. But it did not. In 1901 King\r\nAlexander granted another constitution and for a time attempted to work\r\nwith a coalition ministry; but this failed, and a term of reaction with\r\npro-Austrian tendencies, which were favoured by the king and queen, set\r\nin. This reaction, combined with the growing disorganization of the\r\nfinances and the general sense of the discredit and failure which the\r\nfollies of its rulers had during the last thirty years brought on the\r\ncountry; completely undermined the position of the dynasty and made a\r\ncatastrophe inevitable. This occurred, as is well known, on June 10,\r\n1903, when, as the result of a military conspiracy, King Alexander, the\r\nlast of the Obrenović dynasty, his wife, and her male relatives were\r\nmurdered. This crime was purely political, and it is absurd to gloss it\r\nover or to explain it merely as the result of the family feud between\r\nthe two dynasties. That came to an end in 1868, when the murder of\r\nKara-George in 1817 by the agency of Miloš Obrenović was avenged by the\r\nlunatic assassination of the brilliant Prince Michael Obrenović III. It\r\nis no exaggeration to say that, from the point of view of the Serbian\r\npatriot, the only salvation of his country in 1903 lay in getting rid\r\nof the Obrenović dynasty, which had become pro-Austrian, had no longer\r\nthe great gifts possessed by its earlier members, and undoubtedly by\r\nits vagaries hindered the progress of Serbia both in internal and\r\nexternal politics. The assassination was unfortunately carried out with\r\nunnecessary cruelty, and it is this fact that made such a bad\r\nimpression and for so long militated against Serbia in western Europe;\r\nbut it must be remembered that civilization in the Balkans, where\r\npolitical murder, far from being a product of the five hundred years of\r\nTurkish dominion, has always been endemic, is not on the same level in\r\nmany respects as it is in the rest of Europe. Life is one of the\r\ncommodities which are still cheap in backward countries.\r\n\r\nAlthough King Alexander and his wife can in no sense be said to have\r\ndeserved the awful fate that befell them, it is equally true that had\r\nany other course been adopted, such as deposition and exile, the\r\nwire-pulling and intriguing from outside, which had already done the\r\ncountry so much harm, would have become infinitely worse. Even so, it\r\nwas long before things in any sense settled down. As for the alleged\r\ncomplicity of the rival dynasty in the crime, it is well established\r\nthat that did not exist. It was no secret to anybody interested in\r\nSerbian affairs that something catastrophic was about to happen, and\r\nwhen the tragedy occurred it was natural to appeal to the alternative\r\nnative dynasty to step into the breach. But the head of that dynasty\r\nwas in no way responsible for the plot, still less for the manner in\r\nwhich it was carried out, and it was only after much natural hesitation\r\nand in the face of his strong disinclination that Prince Peter\r\nKaragjorgjević was induced to accept the by no means enviable, easy, or\r\nprofitable task of guiding Serbia’s destiny. The Serbian throne in 1903\r\nwas a source neither of glory nor of riches, and it was notoriously no\r\nsinecure.\r\n\r\nAfter the tragedy, the democratic constitution of 1888 was first of all\r\nrestored, and then Prince Peter Karagjorgjević, grandson of\r\nKara-George, the leader of the first Serbian insurrection of 1804-13,\r\nwho was at that time fifty-nine years of age, was unanimously elected\r\nking. He had married in 1883 a daughter of Prince Nicholas of\r\nMontenegro and sister of the future Queen of Italy, but she had been\r\ndead already some years at the time of his accession, leaving him with\r\na family of two sons and a daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n_Serbia, Montenegro, and the Serbo-Croats in Austria-Hungary,_ 1903–8\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that, after the sensation which such an event could\r\nnot fail to cause in twentieth-century Europe, it should take the\r\ncountry where it occurred some time to live down the results. Other\r\npowers, especially those of western Europe, looked coldly on Serbia and\r\nwere in no hurry to resume diplomatic intercourse, still less to offer\r\ndiplomatic support. The question of the punishment and exile of the\r\nconspirators was almost impossible of solution, and only time was able\r\nto obliterate the resentment caused by the whole affair. In Serbia\r\nitself a great change took place. The new sovereign, though he laboured\r\nunder the greatest possible disadvantages, by his irreproachable\r\nbehaviour, modesty, tact, and strictly constitutional rule, was able to\r\nwithdraw the court of Belgrade from the trying limelight to which it\r\nhad become used. The public finances began to be reorganized, commerce\r\nbegan to improve in spite of endless tariff wars with Austria-Hungary,\r\nand attention was again diverted from home to foreign politics. With\r\nthe gradual spread of education and increase of communication, and the\r\ngrowth of national self-consciousness amongst the Serbs and Croats of\r\nAustria-Hungary and the two independent Serb states, a new movement for\r\nthe closer intercourse amongst the various branches of the Serb race\r\nfor south Slav unity, as it was called, gradually began to take shape.\r\nAt the same time a more definitely political agitation started in\r\nSerbia, largely inspired by the humiliating position of economic\r\nbondage in which the country was held by Austria-Hungary, and was\r\nroughly justified by the indisputable argument: ‘Serbia must expand or\r\ndie.’ Expansion at the cost of Turkey seemed hopeless, because even the\r\nacquisition of Macedonia would give Serbia a large alien population and\r\nno maritime outlet. It was towards the Adriatic that the gaze of the\r\nSerbs was directed, to the coast which was ethnically Serbian and could\r\nlegitimately be considered a heritage of the Serb race.\r\n\r\nMacedonia was also taken into account, schools and armed bands began\r\ntheir educative activity amongst those inhabitants of the unhappy\r\nprovince who were Serb, or who lived in places where Serbs had lived,\r\nor who with sufficient persuasion could be induced to call themselves\r\nSerb; but the principal stream of propaganda was directed westwards\r\ninto Bosnia and Hercegovina. The antagonism between Christian and\r\nMohammedan, Serb and Turk, was never so bitter as between Christian and\r\nChristian, Serb and German or Magyar, and the Serbs were clever enough\r\nto see that Bosnia and Hercegovina, from every point of view, was to\r\nthem worth ten Macedonias, though it would he ten times more difficult\r\nto obtain. Bosnia and Hercegovina, though containing three confessions,\r\nwere ethnically homogeneous, and it was realised that these two\r\nprovinces were as important to Serbia and Montenegro as the rest of\r\nItaly had been to Piedmont.\r\n\r\nIt must at this time be recalled in what an extraordinary way the Serb\r\nrace had fortuitously been broken up into a number of quite arbitrary\r\npolitical divisions. Dalmatia (three per cent. of the population of\r\nwhich is Italian and all the rest Serb or Croat, preponderatingly Serb\r\nand Orthodox in the south and preponderating Croat or Roman Catholic in\r\nthe north) was a province of Austria and sent deputies to the\r\nReichsrath at Vienna; at the same time it was territorially isolated\r\nfrom Austria and had no direct railway connexion with any country\r\nexcept a narrow-gauge line into Bosnia. Croatia and Slavonia,\r\npreponderatingly Roman Catholic, were lands of the Hungarian crown, and\r\nthough they had a provincial pseudo-autonomous diet at Agram, the\r\ncapital of Croatia, they sent deputies to the Hungarian parliament at\r\nBudapest. Thus what had in the Middle Ages been known as the triune\r\nkingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, with a total Serbo-Croat\r\npopulation of three millions, was divided between Austria and Hungary.\r\n\r\nFurther, there were about 700,000 Serbs and Croats in the south of\r\nHungary proper, cast and north of the Danube, known as the Banat and\r\nBačka, a district which during the eighteenth and early nineteenth\r\ncenturies was the hearth and home of Serb literature and education, but\r\nwhich later waned in importance in that respect as independent Serbia\r\ngrew. These Serbs were directly dependent on Budapest, the only\r\nautonomy they possessed being ecclesiastical. Bosnia and Hercegovina,\r\nstill nominally Turkish provinces, with a Slav population of nearly two\r\nmillion (850,000 Orthodox Serbs, 650,000 Mohammedan Serbs, and the rest\r\nRoman Catholics), were to all intents and purposes already imperial\r\nlands of Austria-Hungary, with a purely military and police\r\nadministration; the shadow of Turkish sovereignty provided sufficient\r\nexcuse to the _de facto_ owners of these provinces not to grant the\r\ninhabitants parliamentary government or even genuine provincial\r\nautonomy. The Serbs in Serbia numbered nearly three millions, those in\r\nMontenegro about a quarter of a million; while in Turkey, in what was\r\nknown as Old Serbia (the _sandjak_ of Novi-Pasar between Serbia and\r\nMontenegro and the vilayet of Korovo), and in parts of northern and\r\ncentral Macedonia, there were scattered another half million. These\r\nlast, of course, had no voice at all in the management of their own\r\naffairs. Those in Montenegro lived under the patriarchal autocracy of\r\nPrince Nicholas, who had succeeded his uncle, Prince Danilo, in 1860,\r\nat the age of nineteen. Though no other form of government could have\r\nturned the barren rocks of Montenegro into fertile pastures, many of\r\nthe people grew restless with the restricted possibilities of a career\r\nwhich the mountain principality offered them, and in latter years\r\nmigrated in large numbers to North and South America, whither\r\nemigration from Dalmatia and Croatia too had already readied serious\r\nproportions. The Serbs in Serbia were the only ones who could claim to\r\nbe free, but even this was a freedom entirely dependent on the economic\r\nmalevolence of Austria-Hungary and Turkey. Cut up in this way by the\r\nhand of fate into such a number of helpless fragments, it was\r\ninevitable that the Serb race, if it possessed any vitality, should\r\nattempt, at any cost, to piece some if not all of them together and\r\nform an ethnical whole which, economically and politically, should be\r\nmaster of its own destinies. It was equally inevitable that the policy\r\nof Austria-Hungary should be to anticipate or definitively render any\r\nsuch attempt impossible, because obviously the formation of a large\r\nsouth Slav state, by cutting off Austria from the Adriatic and\r\neliminating from the dual monarchy all the valuable territory between\r\nthe Dalmatian coast and the river Drave, would seriously jeopardize its\r\nposition as a great power; it must be remembered, also, that\r\nAustria-Hungary, far from decomposing, as it was commonly assumed was\r\nhappening, had been enormously increasing in vitality ever since 1878.\r\n\r\nThe means adopted by the governments of Vienna and Budapest to nullify\r\nthe plans of Serbian expansion were generally to maintain the political\r\n_émiettement_ of the Serb race, the isolation of one group from\r\nanother, the virtually enforced emigration of Slavs on a large scale\r\nand their substitution by German colonists, and the encouragement of\r\nrivalry and discord between Roman Catholic Croat and Orthodox Serb. No\r\nrailways were allowed to be built in Dalmatia, communication between\r\nAgram and any other parts of the monarchy except Fiume or Budapest was\r\nrendered almost impossible; Bosnia and Hercegovina were shut off into a\r\nwatertight compartment and endowed with a national flag composed of the\r\ninspiring colours of brown and buff; it was made impossible for Serbs\r\nto visit Montenegro or for Montenegrins to visit Serbia except via\r\nFiume, entailing the bestowal of several pounds on the Hungarian state\r\nsteamers and railways. As for the _sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar, it was\r\nturned into a veritable Tibet, and a legend was spread abroad that if\r\nany foreigner ventured there he would be surely murdered by Turkish\r\nbrigands; meanwhile it was full of Viennese ladies giving picnics and\r\ndances and tennis parties to the wasp-waisted officers of the Austrian\r\ngarrison. Bosnia and Hercegovina, on the other hand, became the model\r\ntouring provinces of Austria-Hungary, and no one can deny that their\r\ngreat natural beauties were made more enjoyable by the construction of\r\nrailways, roads, and hotels. At the same time this was not a work of\r\npure philanthropy, and the emigration statistics are a good indication\r\nof the joy with which the Bosnian peasants paid for an annual influx of\r\nadmiring tourists. In spite of all these disadvantages, however, the\r\nSerbo-Croat provinces of Austria-Hungary could not be deprived of all\r\nthe benefits of living within a large and prosperous customs union,\r\nwhile being made to pay for all the expenses of the elaborate imperial\r\nadministration and services; and the spread of education, even under\r\nthe Hapsburg régime, began to tell in time. Simultaneously with the\r\nagitation which emanated from Serbia and was directed towards the\r\nadvancement, by means of schools and religious and literary propaganda,\r\nof Serbian influence in Bosnia and Hercegovina, a movement started in\r\nDalmatia and Croatia for the closer union of those two provinces. About\r\n1906 the two movements found expression in the formation of the\r\nSerbo-Croat or Croato-Serb coalition party, composed of those elements\r\nin Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slavonia which favoured closer union between\r\nthe various groups of the Serb race scattered throughout those\r\nprovinces, as well as in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Hercegovina, and\r\nTurkey. Owing to the circumstances already described, it was impossible\r\nfor the representatives of the Serb race to voice their aspirations\r\nunanimously in any one parliament, and the work of the coalition,\r\nexcept in the provincial diet at Agram, consisted mostly of conducting\r\npress campaigns and spreading propaganda throughout those provinces.\r\nThe most important thing about the coalition was that it buried\r\nreligious antagonism and put unity of race above difference of belief.\r\nIn this way it came into conflict with the ultramontane Croat party at\r\nAgram, which wished to incorporate Bosnia, Hercegovina, and Dalmatia\r\nwith Croatia and create a third purely Roman Catholic Slav state in the\r\nempire, on a level with Austria and Hungary; also to a lesser extent\r\nwith the intransigent Serbs of Belgrade, who affected to ignore Croatia\r\nand Roman Catholicism, and only dreamed of bringing Bosnia,\r\nHercegovina, and as much of Dalmatia as they could under their own\r\nrule; and finally it had to overcome the hostility of the Mohammedan\r\nSerbs of Bosnia, who disliked all Christians equally, could only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty be persuaded that they were really Serbs and\r\nnot Turks, and honestly cared for nothing but Islam and Turkish coffee,\r\nthus considerably facilitating the germanization of the two provinces.\r\nThe coalition was wisely inclined to postpone the programme of final\r\npolitical settlement, and aimed immediately at the removal of the\r\nmaterial and moral barriers placed between the Serbs of the various\r\nprovinces of Austria-Hungary, including Bosnia and Hercegovina. If they\r\nhad been sure of adequate guarantees they would probably have agreed to\r\nthe inclusion of _all_ Serbs and Croats within the monarchy, because\r\nthe constitution of all Serbs and Croats in an independent state (not\r\nnecessarily a kingdom) without it implied the then problematic\r\ncontingencies of a European war and the disruption of Austria-Hungary.\r\nConsidering the manifold handicaps under which Serbia and its cause\r\nsuffered, the considerable success which its propaganda met with in\r\nBosnia and Hercegovina and other parts of Austria-Hungary, from 1903\r\ntill 1908, is a proof, not only of the energy and earnestness of its\r\npromoters and of the vitality of the Serbian people, but also, if any\r\nwere needed, of the extreme unpopularity of the Hapsburg régime in the\r\nsouthern Slav provinces of the dual monarchy. Serbia had no help from\r\noutside. Russia was entangled in the Far East and then in the\r\nrevolution, and though the new dynasty was approved in St. Petersburg\r\nRussian sympathy with Serbia was at that time only lukewarm. Relations\r\nwith Austria-Hungary were of course always strained; only one single\r\nline of railway connected the two countries, and as Austria-Hungary was\r\nthe only profitable market, for geographical reasons, for Serbian\r\nproducts, Serbia could be brought to its knees at any moment by the\r\ncommercial closing of the frontier. It was a symbol of the economic\r\nvassalage of Serbia and Montenegro that the postage between both of\r\nthese countries and any part of Austria-Hungary was ten centimes, that\r\nfor letters between Serbia and Montenegro, which had to make the long\r\ndétour through Austrian territory, was twenty-five. But though this\r\nopened the Serbian markets to Austria, it also incidentally opened\r\nBosnia, when the censor could be circumvented to propaganda by pamphlet\r\nand correspondence. Intercourse with western Europe was restricted by\r\ndistance, and, owing to dynastic reasons, diplomatic relations were\r\naltogether suspended for several years between this country and Serbia.\r\nThe Balkan States Exhibition held in London during the summer of 1907,\r\nto encourage trade between Great Britain and the Balkans, was hardly a\r\nsuccess. Italy and Serbia had nothing in common. With Montenegro even,\r\ndespite the fact that King Peter was Prince Nicholas’s son-in-law,\r\nrelations were bad. It was felt in Serbia that Prince Nicholas’s\r\nautocratic rule acted as a brake on the legitimate development of the\r\nnational consciousness, and Montenegrin students who visited Belgrade\r\nreturned to their homes full of wild and unsuitable ideas. However, the\r\nrevolutionary tendencies, which some of them undoubtedly developed, had\r\nno fatal results to the reigning dynasty, which continued as before to\r\nenjoy the special favour as well as the financial support of the\r\nRussian court, and which, looked on throughout Europe as a picturesque\r\nand harmless institution, it would have been dangerous, as it was quite\r\nunnecessary, to touch.\r\n\r\nSerbia was thus left entirely to its own resources in the great\r\npropagandist activity which filled the years 1903 to 1908. The\r\nfinancial means at its disposal were exiguous in the extreme,\r\nespecially when compared with the enormous sums lavished annually by\r\nthe Austrian and German governments on their secret political services,\r\nso that the efforts of its agents cannot be ascribed to cupidity. Also\r\nit must be admitted that the kingdom of Serbia, with its capital\r\nBelgrade, thanks to the internal chaos and dynastic scandals of the\r\nprevious forty years, resulting in superficial dilapidation,\r\nintellectual stagnation, and general poverty, lacked the material as\r\nwell as the moral glamour which a successful Piedmont should possess.\r\nNobody could deny, for instance, that, with all its natural advantages,\r\nBelgrade was at first sight not nearly such an attractive centre as\r\nAgram or Sarajevo, or that the qualities which the Serbs of Serbia had\r\ndisplayed since their emancipation were hardly such as to command the\r\nunstinted confidence and admiration of their as yet unredeemed\r\ncompatriots. Nevertheless the Serbian propaganda in favour of what was\r\nreally a Pan-Serb movement met with great success, especially in\r\nBosnia, Hercegovina, and Old Serbia (northern Macedonia).\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the work of the Serbo-Croat coalition in Dalmatia,\r\nCroatia, and Slavonia made considerable progress in spite of clerical\r\nopposition and desperate conflicts with the government at Budapest.\r\nBoth the one movement and the other naturally evoked great alarm and\r\nemotion in the Austrian and Hungarian capitals, as they were seen to be\r\ngenuinely popular and also potentially, if not actually, separatist in\r\ncharacter. In October 1906 Baron Achrenthal succeeded Count Goluchowski\r\nas Minister for Foreign Affairs at Vienna, and very soon initiated a\r\nmore vigorous and incidentally anti-Slav foreign policy than his\r\npredecessor. What was now looked on as the Serbian danger had in the\r\neyes of Vienna assumed such proportions that the time for decisive\r\naction was considered to have arrived. In January 1908 Baron Achrenthal\r\nannounced his scheme for a continuation of the Bosnian railway system\r\nthrough the _sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar to link up with the Turkish\r\nrailways in Macedonia. This plan was particularly foolish in\r\nconception, because, the Bosnian railways being narrow and the Turkish\r\nnormal gauge, the line would have been useless for international\r\ncommerce, while the engineering difficulties were such that the cost of\r\nconstruction would have been prohibitive. But the possibilities which\r\nthis move indicated, the palpable evidence it contained of the\r\nnotorious _Drang nach Osten_ of the Germanic powers towards Salonika\r\nand Constantinople, were quite sufficient to fill the ministries of\r\nEurope, and especially those of Russia, with extreme uneasiness. The\r\nimmediate result of this was that concerted action between Russia and\r\nAustria-Hungary in the Balkans was thenceforward impossible, and the\r\nMürzsteg programme, after a short and precarious existence, came to an\r\nuntimely end (cf. chap. 12). Serbia and Montenegro, face to face with\r\nthis new danger which threatened permanently to separate their\r\nterritories, were beside themselves, and immediately parried with the\r\nproject, hardly more practicable in view of their international credit,\r\nof a Danube-Adriatic railway. In July 1908 the nerves of Europe were\r\nstill further tried by the Young Turk revolution in Constantinople. The\r\nimminence of this movement was known to Austro-German diplomacy, and\r\ndoubtless this knowledge, as well as the fear of the Pan-Serb movement,\r\nprompted the Austrian foreign minister to take steps towards the\r\ndefinitive regularization of his country’s position in Bosnia and\r\nHercegovina—provinces whose suzerain was still the Sultan of Turkey.\r\nThe effect of the Young Turk coup in the Balkan States was as any one\r\nwho visited them at that time can testify, both pathetic and intensely\r\nhumorous. The permanent chaos of the Turkish empire, and the process of\r\nwatching for years its gradual but inevitable decomposition, had\r\ncreated amongst the neighbouring states an atmosphere of excited\r\nanticipation, which was really the breath of their nostrils; it had\r\nstimulated them during the endless Macedonian insurrections to commit\r\nthe most awful outrages against each other’s nationals and then lay the\r\nblame at the door of the unfortunate Turk; and if the Turk should\r\nreally regenerate himself, not only would their occupation be gone, but\r\nthe heavily-discounted legacies would assuredly elude their grasp. At\r\nthe same time, since the whole policy of exhibiting and exploiting the\r\nhorrors of Macedonia, and of organizing guerilla bands and provoking\r\nintervention, was based on the refusal of the Turks to grant reforms,\r\nas soon as the ultra-liberal constitution of Midhat Pasha, which, had\r\nbeen withdrawn after a brief and unsuccessful run in 1876, was restored\r\nby the Young Turks, there was nothing left for the Balkan States to do\r\nbut to applaud with as much enthusiasm as they could simulate. The\r\nemotions experienced by the Balkan peoples during that summer, beneath\r\nthe smiles which they had to assume, were exhausting even for southern\r\ntemperaments. Bulgaria, with its characteristic matter-of-factness, was\r\nthe first to adjust itself to the new and trying situation in which the\r\nonly certainty was that something decisive had got to be done with all\r\npossible celerity. On October 5, 1908, Prince Ferdinand sprang on an\r\nastonished continent the news that he renounced the Turkish suzerainty\r\n(ever since 1878 the Bulgarian principality had been a tributary and\r\nvassal state of the Ottoman Empire, and therefore, with all its\r\nastonishingly rapid progress and material prosperity, a subject for\r\ncommiseration in the kingdoms of Serbia and Greece) and proclaimed the\r\nindependence of Bulgaria, with himself, as Tsar of the Bulgars, at its\r\nhead. Europe had not recovered from this shock, still less Belgrade and\r\nAthens, when, two days later. Baron Aehrenthal announced the formal\r\nannexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina by the Emperor Francis Joseph.\r\nWhereas most people had virtually forgotten the Treaty of Berlin and\r\nhad come to look on Austria as just as permanently settled in these two\r\nprovinces as was Great Britain in Egypt and Cyprus, yet the formal\r\nbreach of the stipulations of that treaty on Austria’s part, by\r\nannexing the provinces without notice to or consultation with the other\r\nparties concerned, gave the excuse for a somewhat ridiculous hue and\r\ncry on the part of the other powers, and especially on that of Russia.\r\nThe effect of these blows from right and left on Serbia was literally\r\nparalysing. When Belgrade recovered the use of its organs, it started\r\nto scream for war and revenue, and initiated an international crisis\r\nfrom which Europe did not recover till the following year. Meanwhile,\r\nalmost unobserved by the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro, Austria had,\r\nin order to reconcile the Turks with the loss of their provinces,\r\ngood-naturedly, but from the Austrian point of view short-sightedly,\r\nwithdrawn its garrisons from the _sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar, thus\r\nevacuating the long-coveted corridor which was the one thing above all\r\nelse necessary to Serbia and Montenegro for the realization of their\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n_Serbia and Montenegro, and the two Balkan Wars,_ 1908–13 (cf. Chap,\r\n13)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1908-9 marked the lowest ebb of Serbia’s fortunes. The\r\nsuccessive _coups_ and _faits accomplis_ carried out by Austria,\r\nTurkey, and Bulgaria during 1908 seemed destined to destroy for good\r\nthe Serbian plans for expansion in any direction whatever, and if these\r\ncould not be realized then Serbia must die of suffocation. It was also\r\nwell understood that for all the martial ardour displayed in Belgrade\r\nthe army was in no condition to take the field any more than was the\r\ntreasury to bear the cost of a campaign; Russia had not yet recovered\r\nfrom the Japanese War followed by the revolution, and indeed everything\r\npointed to the certainty that if Serbia indulged in hostilities against\r\nAustria-Hungary it would perish ignominiously and alone. The worst of\r\nit was that neither Serbia nor Montenegro had any legal claim to Bosnia\r\nand Hercegovina: they had been deluding themselves with the hope that\r\ntheir ethnical identity with the people of these provinces, supported\r\nby the effects of their propaganda, would induce a compassionate and\r\ngenerous Europe at least to insist on their being given a part of the\r\ncoveted territory, and thus give Serbia access to the coast, when the\r\nambiguous position of these two valuable provinces, still nominally\r\nTurkish but already virtually Austrian, came to be finally regularized.\r\nAs a matter of fact, ever since Bismarck, Gorchakóv, and Beaconsfield\r\nhad put Austria-Hungary in their possession in 1878, no one had\r\nseriously thought that the Dual Monarchy would ever voluntarily retire\r\nfrom one inch of the territory which had been conquered and occupied at\r\nsuch cost, and those who noticed it were astonished at the evacuation\r\nby it of the _sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar. At the same time Baron Achrenthal\r\nlittle foresaw what a hornet’s nest he would bring about his ears by\r\nthe tactless method in which the annexation was carried out. The first\r\neffect was to provoke a complete boycott of Austro-Hungarian goods and\r\ntrading vessels throughout the Ottoman Empire, which was so harmful to\r\nthe Austrian export trade that in January 1909 Count Achrenthal had to\r\nindemnify Turkey with the sum of £2,500,000 for his technically stolen\r\nproperty. Further, the attitude of Russia and Serbia throughout the\r\nwhole winter remained so provocative and threatening that, although war\r\nwas generally considered improbable, the Austrian army had to be kept\r\non a war footing, which involved great expense and much popular\r\ndiscontent. The grave external crisis was only solved at the end of\r\nMarch 1909; Germany had had to deliver a veiled ultimatum at St.\r\nPetersburg, the result of which was the rescue of Austria-Hungary from\r\nan awkward situation by the much-advertised appearance of its faithful\r\nally in shining armour. Simultaneously Serbia had to eat humble pie and\r\ndeclare, with complete absence of truth, that the annexation of Bosnia\r\nand Hercegovina had not affected its interests.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the internal complications in the southern Slav provinces of\r\nAustria-Hungary were growing formidable. Ever since the summer of 1908\r\narrests had been going on among the members of the Croato-Serb\r\ncoalition, who were accused of favouring the subversive Pan-Serb\r\nmovement. The press of Austria-Hungary magnified the importance of this\r\nagitation in order to justify abroad the pressing need for the formal\r\nannexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina. The fact was that, though\r\nimmediate danger to the monarchy as a result of the Pan-Serb agitation\r\nwas known not to exist, yet in the interests of Austrian foreign\r\npolicy, the Serbs had to be compromised in the eyes of Europe, the\r\nCroato-Serb coalition within the Dual Monarchy had to be destroyed to\r\ngratify Budapest in particular, and the religious and political discord\r\nbetween Croat and Serb, on which the foundation of the power of\r\nAustria-Hungary, and especially that of Hungary, in the south rested,\r\nand which was in a fair way of being eliminated through the efforts of\r\nthe coalition, had to be revived by some means or other. It is not\r\npossible here to go into the details of the notorious Agram high\r\ntreason trial, which was the outcome of all this. It suffices to say\r\nthat it was a monstrous travesty of justice which lasted from March\r\ntill October 1909, and though it resulted in the ostensible destruction\r\nof the coalition and the imprisonment of many of its members, it\r\ndefeated its own ends, as it merely fanned the flame of nationalistic\r\nfeeling against Vienna and Budapest, and Croatia has ever since had to\r\nbe governed virtually by martial law. This was followed in December\r\n1909 by the even more famous Friedjung trial. In March 1909 Count\r\nAchrenthal had begun in Vienna a violent press campaign against Serbia,\r\naccusing the Serbian Government and dynasty of complicity in the\r\nconcoction of nefarious designs and conspiracies against the integrity\r\nof Austria-Hungary. This campaign was thought to be the means of\r\nforeshadowing and justifying the immediate military occupation of\r\nSerbia. Unfortunately its instigator had not been sufficiently\r\nparticular as to the choice of his tools and his methods of using them.\r\nAmong the contributors of the highly tendencious articles was the\r\nwell-known historian Dr. Friedjung, who made extensive use of documents\r\nsupplied him by the Vienna Foreign Office. His accusations immediately\r\nprovoked an action for libel on the part of three leaders of the\r\nCroato-Serb coalition who were implicated, in December 1909. The trial,\r\nwhich was highly sensational, resulted in the complete vindication and\r\nrehabilitation both of those three Austrian subjects in the eyes of the\r\nwhole of Austria-Hungary and of the Belgrade Foreign Office in those of\r\nEurope; the documents on which the charges were based were proven to be\r\npartly forgeries, partly falsified, and partly stolen by various\r\ndisreputable secret political agents of the Austrian Foreign Office,\r\nand one of the principal Serbian ‘conspirators’, a professor of\r\nBelgrade University, proved that he was in Berlin at the time when he\r\nhad been accused of presiding over a revolutionary meeting at Belgrade.\r\nBut it also resulted in the latter discrediting of Count Achrenthal as\r\na diplomat and of the methods by which he conducted the business of the\r\nAustrian Foreign Office, and involved his country in the expenditure of\r\ncountless millions which it could ill afford.\r\n\r\nThere never was any doubt that a subversive agitation had been going\r\non, and that it emanated in part from Serbia, but the Serbian Foreign\r\nOffice, under the able management of Dr. Milovanović and Dr.\r\nSpalajković (one of the principal witnesses at the Friedjung trial),\r\nwas far too clever to allow any of its members, or indeed any\r\nresponsible person in Serbia, to be concerned in it, and the brilliant\r\nway in which the clumsy and foolish charges were refuted redounded\r\ngreatly to the credit of the Serbian Government. Count Achrenthal had\r\noverreached himself, and moreover the wind had already been taken out\r\nof his sails by the public recantation on Serbia’s part of its\r\npretensions to Bosnia, which, as already mentioned, took place at the\r\nend of March 1909, and by the simultaneous termination of the\r\ninternational crisis marked by Russia’s acquiescence in the _fait\r\naccompli_ of the annexation. At the same time the Serbian Crown Prince\r\nGeorge, King Peter’s elder son, who had been the leader of the\r\nchauvinist war-party in Serbia, and was somewhat theatrical in\r\ndemeanour and irresponsible in character, renounced his rights of\r\nsuccession in favour of his younger brother Prince Alexander, a much\r\nsteadier and more talented young man. It is certain that when he\r\nrealized how things were going to develop Count Achrenthal tried to\r\nhush up the whole incident, but it was too late, and Dr. Friedjung\r\ninsisted on doing what he could to save his reputation as a historian.\r\nIn the end he was made the principal scapegoat, though the press of\r\nVienna voiced its opinion of the Austrian Foreign Office in no measured\r\ntones, saying, amongst other things, that if the conductors of its\r\ndiplomacy must use forgeries, they might at any rate secure good ones.\r\nEventually a compromise was arranged, after the defendant had clearly\r\nlost his case, owing to pressure being brought to bear from outside,\r\nand the Serbian Government refrained from carrying out its threat of\r\nhaving the whole question threshed out before the Hague Tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of all these exciting and trying experiences was\r\nthe growth of a distinctly more sympathetic feeling towards Serbia in\r\nEurope at large, and especially a rallying of all the elements\r\nthroughout the Serb and Croat provinces of Austria-Hungary, except the\r\nextreme clericals of Agram, to the Serbian cause; briefly, the effect\r\nwas the exact opposite of that desired by Vienna and Budapest.\r\nMeanwhile events had been happening elsewhere which revived the\r\ndrooping interest and flagging hopes of Serbia in the development of\r\nforeign affairs. The attainment of power by the Young Turks and the\r\nintroduction of parliamentary government had brought no improvement to\r\nthe internal condition of the Ottoman Empire, and the Balkan peoples\r\nmade no effort to conceal their satisfaction at the failure of the\r\nrevolution to bring about reform by magic. The counter-revolution of\r\nApril 1909 and the accession of the Sultan Mohammed V made things no\r\nbetter. In Macedonia, and especially in Albania, they had been going\r\nfrom bad to worse. The introduction of universal military service and\r\nobligatory payment of taxes caused a revolution in Albania, where such\r\ninnovations were not at all appreciated. From 1909 till 1911 there was\r\na state of perpetual warfare in Albania, with which the Young Turks, in\r\nspite of cruel reprisals, were unable to cope, until, in the summer of\r\nthat year, Austria threatened to intervene unless order were restored;\r\nsome sort of settlement was patched up, and an amnesty was granted to\r\nthe rebels by the new Sultan. This unfortunate man, after being\r\nrendered almost half-witted by having been for the greater part of his\r\nlife kept a prisoner by his brother the tyrant Abdul Hamid, was now the\r\ncaptive of the Young Turks, and had been compelled by them to make as\r\ntriumphal a progress as fears for his personal safety would allow\r\nthrough the provinces of European Turkey. But it was obvious to Balkan\r\nstatesmen that Turkey was only changed in name, and that, if its\r\nthreatened regeneration had slightly postponed their plans for its\r\npartition amongst themselves, the ultimate consummation of these plans\r\nmust be pursued with, if possible, even greater energy and expedition\r\nthan before. It was also seen by the more perspicacious of them that\r\nthe methods hitherto adopted must in future be radically altered. A\r\nrejuvenated though unreformed Turkey, bent on self-preservation, could\r\nnot be despised, and it was understood that if the revolutionary bands\r\nof the three Christian nations (Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria) were to\r\ncontinue indefinitely to cut each others’ throats in Macedonia the\r\ntables might conceivably be turned on them.\r\n\r\nFrom 1909 onwards a series of phenomena occurred in the Balkans which\r\nought to have given warning to the Turks, whose survival in Europe had\r\nbeen due solely to the fact that the Balkan States had never been able\r\nto unite. In the autumn of 1909 King Ferdinand of Bulgaria met Crown\r\nPrince Alexander of Serbia and made an expedition in his company to\r\nMount Kopaonik in Serbia, renowned for the beauty of its flora. This\r\nmust have struck those who remembered the bitter feelings which had\r\nexisted between the two countries for years and had been intensified by\r\nthe events of 1908. Bulgaria had looked on Serbia’s failures with\r\npersistent contempt, while Serbia had watched Bulgaria’s successful\r\nprogress with speechless jealousy, and the memory of Slivnitsa was not\r\nyet obliterated. In the summer of 1910 Prince Nicholas of Montenegro\r\ncelebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his reign and his golden\r\nwedding. The festivities were attended by King Ferdinand of Bulgaria\r\nand the Crown Prince Boris, by the Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia and\r\nhis sister, grandchildren of Prince Nicholas, by his two daughters the\r\nQueen of Italy and the Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia, and by their\r\nhusbands, King Victor Emmanuel and the Grand Duke Nicholas. The\r\nhappiness of the venerable ruler, who was as respected throughout\r\nEurope as he was feared throughout his principality, was at the same\r\ntime completed by his recognition as king by all the governments and\r\nsovereigns of the continent. The hopes that he would simultaneously\r\nintroduce a more liberal form of government amongst his own people were\r\nunfortunately disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe year 1911, it need scarcely be recalled, was extremely fateful for\r\nthe whole of Europe. The growing restlessness and irritability\r\nmanifested by the German Empire began to make all the other governments\r\nfeel exceedingly uneasy. The French expedition to Fez in April was\r\nfollowed by the Anglo-Franco-German crisis of July; war was avoided,\r\nand France was recognized as virtually master of Morocco, but the\r\nsoreness of the diplomatic defeat rendered Germany a still more trying\r\nneighbour than it had been before. The first repercussion was the war\r\nwhich broke out in September 1911 between Italy and Turkey for the\r\npossession of Tripoli and Cyrenaica, which Italy, with its usual\r\ninsight, saw was vital to its position as a Mediterranean power and\r\ntherefore determined to acquire before any other power had time or\r\ncourage to do so. In the Balkans this was a year of observation and\r\npreparation. Serbia, taught by the bitter lesson of 1908 not to be\r\ncaught again unprepared, had spent much money and care on its army\r\nduring the last few years and had brought it to a much higher state of\r\nefficiency. In Austria-Hungary careful observers wore aware that\r\nsomething was afoot and that the gaze of Serbia, which from 1903 till\r\n1908 had been directed westwards to Bosnia and the Adriatic, had since\r\n1908 been fixed on Macedonia and the Aegean. The actual formation of\r\nthe Balkan League by King Ferdinand and M. Venezelos may not have been\r\nknown, but it was realized that action of some sort on the part of the\r\nBalkan States was imminent, and that something must be done to\r\nforestall it. In February 1912 Count Aehrenthal died, and was succeeded\r\nby Count Berchtold as Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs. In\r\nAugust of the same year this minister unexpectedly announced his new\r\nand startling proposals for the introduction of reforms in Macedonia,\r\nwhich nobody in the Balkans who had any material interest in the fate\r\nof that province genuinely desired at that moment; the motto of the new\r\nscheme was ‘progressive decentralization’, blessed words which soothed\r\nthe great powers as much as they alarmed the Balkan Governments. But\r\nalready in May 1912 agreements between Bulgaria and Greece and between\r\nBulgaria and Serbia had been concluded, limiting their respective zones\r\nof influence in the territory which they hoped to conquer. It was, to\r\nany one who has any knowledge of Balkan history, incredible that the\r\nvarious Governments had been able to come to any agreement at all. That\r\narrived at by Bulgaria and Serbia divided Macedonia between them in\r\nsuch a way that Bulgaria should obtain central Macedonia with Monastir\r\nand Okhrida, and Serbia northern Macedonia or Old Serbia; there was an\r\nindeterminate zone between the two spheres, including Skoplje (Üsküb,\r\nin Turkish), the exact division of which it was agreed to leave to\r\narbitration at a subsequent date.\r\n\r\nThe Macedonian theatre of war was by common consent regarded as the\r\nmost important, and Bulgaria here promised Serbia the assistance of\r\n100,000 men. The Turks meanwhile were aware that all was not what it\r\nseemed beyond the frontiers, and in August 1912 began collecting troops\r\nin Thrace, ostensibly for manoeuvres. During the month of September the\r\npatience of the four Governments of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, and\r\nMontenegro, which had for years with the utmost self-control been\r\npassively watching the awful sufferings of their compatriots under\r\nTurkish misrule, gradually became exhausted. On September 28 the four\r\nBalkan Governments informed Russia that the Balkan League was an\r\naccomplished fact, and on the 30th the representatives of all four\r\nsigned the alliance, and mobilization was ordered in Greece, Bulgaria,\r\nand Serbia. The population of Montenegro was habitually on a war\r\nfooting, and it was left to the mountain kingdom from its\r\ngeographically favourable position to open hostilities. On October 8\r\nMontenegro declared war on Turkey, and after a series of brilliant\r\nsuccesses along the frontier its forces settled down to the wearisome\r\nand arduous siege of Scutari with its impregnable sentinel, Mount\r\nTaraboš, converted into a modern fortress; the unaccustomed nature of\r\nthese tasks, to which the Montenegrin troops, used to the adventures of\r\nirregular warfare, were little suited, tried the valour and patience of\r\nthe intrepid mountaineers to the utmost. By that time Europe was in a\r\nferment, and both Russia and Austria, amazed at having the initiative\r\nin the regulation of Balkan affairs wrested from them, showered on the\r\nBalkan capitals threats and protests, which for once in a way were\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nOn October 13 Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia replied that the offer of\r\noutside assistance and advice had come too late, and that they had\r\ndecided themselves to redress the intolerable and secular wrongs of\r\ntheir long-suffering compatriots in Macedonia by force of arms. To\r\ntheir dismay a treaty of peace was signed at Lausanne about the same\r\ntime between Turkey and Italy, which power, it had been hoped, would\r\nhave distracted Turkey’s attention by a continuance of hostilities in\r\nnorthern Africa, and at any rate immobilized the Turkish fleet.\r\nEncouraged by this success Turkey boldly declared war on Bulgaria and\r\nSerbia on October 17, hoping to frighten Greece and detach it from the\r\nleague; but on the 18th the Greek Government replied by declaring war\r\non Turkey, thus completing the necessary formalities. The Turks were\r\nconfident of an early and easy victory, and hoped to reach Sofia, not\r\nfrom Constantinople and Thrace, but pushing up north-eastwards from\r\nMacedonia. The rapid offensive of the Serbian army, however, took them\r\nby surprise, and they were completely overwhelmed at the battle of\r\nKumanovo in northern Macedonia on October 23-4, 1912. On the 31st King\r\nPeter made his triumphal entry into Skoplje (ex-Üsküb), the ancient\r\ncapital of Serbia under Tsar Stephen Dušan in the fourteenth century.\r\nFrom there the Serbian army pursued the Turks southward, and at the\r\nbattles of Prilep (November 5) and Monastir (November 19), after\r\nencountering the most stubborn opposition, finally put an end to their\r\nresistance in this part of the theatre of war. On November 9 the Greeks\r\nentered Salonika.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other divisions of the Serbian army had joined hands with the\r\nMontenegrins, and occupied almost without opposition the long-coveted\r\n_sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar (the ancient Serb Raška), to the inexpressible\r\nrage of Austria-Hungary, which had evacuated it in 1908 in favour of\r\nits rightful owner, Turkey. At the same time a Serbian expeditionary\r\ncorps marched right through Albania, braving great hardships on the\r\nway, and on November 30 occupied Durazzo, thus securing at last a\r\nfoothold on the Adriatic. Besides all this, Serbia, in fulfilment of\r\nits treaty obligations, dispatched 50,000 splendidly equipped men,\r\ntogether with a quantity of heavy siege artillery, to help the\r\nBulgarians at the siege of Adrianople. On December 3 an armistice was\r\nsigned between the belligerents, with the condition that the three\r\nbesieged Turkish fortresses of Adrianople, Scutari, and Yanina must not\r\nbe re-victualled, and on December 16, 1912, peace negotiations were\r\nopened between representatives of the belligerent countries in London.\r\nMeanwhile the Germanic powers, dismayed by the unexpected victories of\r\nthe Balkan armies and humiliated by the crushing defeats in the field\r\nof the German-trained Turkish army, had since the beginning of November\r\nbeen doing everything in their power to support their client Turkey and\r\nprevent its final extinction and at the same time the blighting of\r\ntheir ambitions eventually to acquire the Empire of the Near East.\r\nDuring the conference in London between the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nbelligerents, parallel meetings took place between the representatives\r\nof the great powers, whose relations with each other were strained and\r\ndifficult in the extreme. The Turkish envoys prolonged the\r\nnegotiations, as was their custom; they naturally were unwilling to\r\nconcede their European provinces to the despised and hated Greek and\r\nSlavonic conquerors, but the delays implied growing hardships for their\r\nbesieged and starving garrisons in Thrace, Epirus, and Albania. On\r\nJanuary 23, 1913, a quasi-revolution occurred in the Turkish army,\r\nheaded by Enver Bey and other Young Turk partisans, and approved by the\r\nAustrian and German embassies, with the object of interrupting the\r\nnegotiations and staking all on the result of a final battle. As a\r\nresult of these events, and of the palpable disingenuousness of the\r\nTurks in continuing the negotiations in London, the Balkan delegates on\r\nJanuary 29 broke them off, and on February 3, 1913, hostilities were\r\nresumed. At length, after a siege of nearly five months, Adrianople,\r\nsupplied with infinitely better artillery than the allies possessed,\r\nwas taken by the combined Serbian and Bulgarian forces on March 26,\r\n1913. The Serbian troops at Adrianople captured 17,010 Turkish\r\nprisoners, 190 guns, and the Turkish commander himself, Shukri Pasha.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war in the autumn of 1912 the Balkan States had\r\nobserved all the conventions, disavowing designs of territorial\r\naggrandizement and proclaiming their resolve merely to obtain\r\nguarantees for the better treatment of the Christian inhabitants of\r\nMacedonia; the powers, for their part, duly admonished the naughty\r\nchildren of south-eastern Europe to the effect that no alteration of\r\nthe territorial _status quo ante_ would under any circumstances be\r\ntolerated. During the negotiations in London, interrupted in January,\r\nand resumed in the spring of 1913 after the fall of Adrianople, it was\r\nsoon made clear that in spite of all these magniloquent declarations\r\nnothing would be as it had been before. Throughout the winter\r\nAustria-Hungary had been mobilizing troops and massing them along the\r\nfrontiers of Serbia and Montenegro, any increase in the size of which\r\ncountries meant a crushing blow to the designs of the Germanic powers\r\nand the end to all the dreams embodied in the phrase ‘Drang nach Osten’\r\n(‘pushing eastwards’).\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1913 Serbia and Montenegro, instead of being defeated\r\nby the brave Turks, as had been confidently predicted in Vienna and\r\nBerlin would be the case, found themselves in possession of the\r\n_sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar, of northern and central Macedonia (including\r\nOld Serbia), and of the northern half of Albania. The presence of\r\nSerbian troops on the shore of the Adriatic was more than Austria could\r\nstand, and at the renewed conference of London it was decided that they\r\nmust retire. In the interests of nationality, in which the Balkan\r\nStates themselves undertook the war, it was desirable that at any rate\r\nan attempt should be made to create an independent state of Albania,\r\nthough no one who knew the local conditions felt confident as to its\r\nultimate career. Its creation assuaged the consciences of the Liberal\r\nGovernment in Great Britain and at the same time admirably suited the\r\nstrategic plans of Austria-Hungary. It left that country a loophole for\r\nfuture diplomatic efforts to disturb the peace of south-eastern Europe,\r\nand, with its own army in Bosnia and its political agents and irregular\r\ntroops in Albania, Serbia and Montenegro, even though enlarged as it\r\nwas generally recognized they must be, would be held in a vice and\r\ncould be threatened and bullied from the south now as well as from the\r\nnorth whenever it was in the interests of Vienna and Budapest to apply\r\nthe screw. The independence of Albania was declared at the conference\r\nof London on May 30, 1913. Scutari was included in it as being a purely\r\nAlbanian town, and King Nicholas and his army, after enjoying its\r\ncoveted flesh-pots for a few halcyon weeks, had, to their\r\nmortification, to retire to the barren fastnesses of the Black\r\nMountain. Serbia, frustrated by Austria in its attempts, generally\r\nrecognized as legitimate, to obtain even a commercial outlet on the\r\nAdriatic, naturally again diverted its aims southwards to Salonika. The\r\nGreeks were already in possession of this important city and seaport,\r\nas well as of the whole of southern Macedonia. The Serbs were in\r\npossession of central and northern Macedonia, including Monastir and\r\nOkhrida, which they had at great sacrifices conquered from the Turks.\r\nIt had been agreed that Bulgaria, as its share of the spoils, should\r\nhave all central Macedonia, with Monastir and Okhrida, although on\r\nethnical grounds the Bulgarians have only very slightly better claim to\r\nthe country and towns west of the Vardar than any of the other Balkan\r\nnationalities. But at the time that the agreement had been concluded it\r\nhad been calculated in Greece and Serbia that Albania, far from being\r\nmade independent, would be divided between them, and that Serbia,\r\nassured of a strip of coast on the Adriatic, would have no interest in\r\nthe control of the river Vardar and of the railway which follows its\r\ncourse connecting the interior of Serbia with the port of Salonika.\r\nGreece and Serbia had no ground whatever for quarrel and no cause for\r\nmutual distrust, and they were determined, for political and commercial\r\nreasons, to have a considerable extent of frontier from west to east in\r\ncommon. The creation of an independent Albania completely altered the\r\nsituation. If Bulgaria should obtain central Macedonia and thus secure\r\na frontier from north to south in common with the newly-formed state of\r\nAlbania, then Greece would be at the mercy of its hereditary enemies\r\nthe Bulgars and Arnauts (Albanians) as it had previously been at the\r\nmercy of the Turks, while Serbia would have two frontiers between\r\nitself and the sea instead of one, as before, and its complete economic\r\nstrangulation would be rendered inevitable and rapid. Bulgaria for its\r\nown part naturally refused to waive its claim to central Macedonia,\r\nwell knowing that the master of the Vardar valley is master of the\r\nBalkan peninsula. The first repercussion of the ephemeral treaty of\r\nLondon of May 30, 1913, which created Albania and shut out Serbia from\r\nthe Adriatic, was, therefore, as the diplomacy of the Germanic powers\r\nhad all along intended it should be, the beginning of a feud between\r\nGreece and Serbia on the one hand, and Bulgaria on the other, the\r\ndisruption of the Balkan League and the salvation, for the ultimate\r\nbenefit of Germany, of what was left of Turkey in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe dispute as to the exact division of the conquered territory in\r\nMacedonia between Serbia and Bulgaria had, as arranged, been referred\r\nto arbitration, and, the Tsar of Russia having been chosen as judge,\r\nthe matter was being threshed out in St. Petersburg during June 1913.\r\nMeanwhile Bulgaria, determined to make good its claim to the chestnuts\r\nwhich Greece and Serbia had pulled out of the Turkish fire, was\r\nsecretly collecting troops along its temporary south-western\r\nfrontier[1] with the object, in approved Germanic fashion, of suddenly\r\ninvading and occupying all Macedonia, and, by the presentation of an\r\nirrevocable _fait accompli_, of relieving the arbitrator of his\r\ninvidious duties or at any rate assisting him in the task.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This was formed by the stream Zletovska, a tributary of\r\nthe river Bregalnica, which in its turn falls into the Vardar on its\r\nleft or eastern bank about 40 miles south of Skoplje (Üsküb).]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the relations between Bulgaria and its two allies\r\nhad been noticeably growing worse ever since January 1913; Bulgaria\r\nfelt aggrieved that, in spite of its great sacrifices, it had not been\r\nable to occupy so much territory as Greece and Serbia, and the fact\r\nthat Adrianople was taken with Serbian help did not improve the feeling\r\nbetween the two Slav nations. The growth of Bulgarian animosity put\r\nGreece and Serbia on their guard, and, well knowing the direction which\r\nan eventual attack would take, these two countries on June 2, 1913,\r\nsigned a military convention and made all the necessary dispositions\r\nfor resisting any aggression on Bulgaria’s part. At one o’clock in the\r\nmorning of June 30 the Bulgarians, without provocation, without\r\ndeclaration of war, and without warning, crossed the Bregalnica (a\r\ntributary of the Vardar) and attacked the Serbs. A most violent battle\r\nensued which lasted for several days; at some points the Bulgarians,\r\nthanks to the suddenness of their offensive, were temporarily\r\nsuccessful, but gradually the Serbs regained the upper hand and by July\r\n1 the Bulgarians were beaten. The losses were very heavy on both sides,\r\nbut the final issue was a complete triumph for the Serbian army.\r\nSlivnitsa was avenged by the battle of the Bregalnica, just as Kosovo\r\nwas by that of Kumanovo. After a triumphant campaign of one month, in\r\nwhich the Serbs were joined by the Greeks, Bulgaria had to bow to the\r\ninevitable. The Rumanian army had invaded northern Bulgaria, bent on\r\nmaintaining the Balkan equilibrium and on securing compensation for\r\nhaving observed neutrality during the war of 1912-13, and famine\r\nreigned at Sofia. A conference was arranged at Bucarest, and the treaty\r\nof that name was signed there on August 10, 1913. By the terms of this\r\ntreaty Serbia retained the whole of northern and central Macedonia,\r\nincluding Monastir and Okhrida, and the famous _sandjak_ of Novi-Pazar\r\nwas divided between Serbia and Montenegro. Some districts of\r\neast-central Macedonia, which were genuinely Bulgarian, were included\r\nin Serbian territory, as Serbia naturally did not wish, after the\r\ndisquieting and costly experience of June and July 1913, to give the\r\nBulgarians another chance of separating Greek from Serbian territory by\r\na fresh surprise attack, and the further the Bulgarians could be kept\r\nfrom the Vardar river and railway the less likelihood there was of\r\nthis. The state of feeling in the Germanic capitals and in Budapest\r\nafter this ignominious defeat of their protégé Bulgaria and after this\r\nfresh triumph of the despised and hated Serbians can be imagined.\r\nBitterly disappointed first at seeing the Turks vanquished by the\r\nBalkan League—their greatest admirers could not even claim that the\r\nTurks had had any ‘moral’ victories—their chagrin, when they saw the\r\nBulgarians trounced by the Serbians, knew no bounds. That the secretly\r\nprepared attack on Serbia by Bulgaria was planned in Vienna and\r\nBudapest there is no doubt. That Bulgaria was justified in feeling\r\ndisappointment and resentment at the result of the first Balkan War no\r\none denies, but the method chosen to redress its wrongs could only have\r\nbeen suggested by the Germanic school of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nIn Serbia and Montenegro the result of the two successive Balkan Wars,\r\nthough these had exhausted the material resources of the two countries,\r\nwas a justifiable return of national self-confidence and rejoicing such\r\nas the people, humiliated and impoverished as it had habitually been by\r\nits internal and external troubles, had not known for very many years.\r\nAt last Serbia and Montenegro had joined hands. At last Old Serbia was\r\nrestored to the free kingdom. At last Skoplje, the mediaeval capital of\r\nTsar Stephen Dušan, was again in Serbian territory. At last one of the\r\nmost important portions of unredeemed Serbia had been reclaimed.\r\nAmongst the Serbs and Croats of Bosnia, Hercegovina, Dalmatia, Croatia,\r\nSlavonia, and southern Hungary the effect of the Serbian victories was\r\nelectrifying. Military prowess had been the one quality with which\r\nthey, and indeed everybody else, had refused to credit the Serbians of\r\nthe kingdom, and the triumphs of the valiant Serbian peasant soldiers\r\nimmediately imparted a heroic glow to the country whose very name, at\r\nany rate in central Europe, had become a byword, and a synonym for\r\nfailure; Belgrade became the cynosure and the rallying-centre of the\r\nwhole Serbo-Croatian race. But Vienna and Budapest could only lose\r\ncourage and presence of mind for the moment, and the undeniable success\r\nof the Serbian arms merely sharpened their appetite for revenge. In\r\nAugust 1913 Austria-Hungary, as is now known, secretly prepared an\r\naggression on Serbia, but was restrained, partly by the refusal of\r\nItaly to grant its approval of such action, partly because the\r\npreparations of Germany at that time were not complete. The fortunate\r\nAlbanian question provided, for the time being, a more convenient rod\r\nwith which to beat Serbia. Some Serbian troops had remained in\r\npossession of certain frontier towns and districts which were included\r\nin the territory of the infant state of Albania pending the final\r\nsettlement of the frontiers by a commission. On October 18, 1913,\r\nAustria addressed an ultimatum to Serbia to evacuate these, as its\r\ncontinued occupation of them caused offence and disquiet to the Dual\r\nMonarchy. Serbia meekly obeyed. Thus passed away the last rumble of the\r\nstorms which had filled the years 1912-13 in south-eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe credulous believed that the Treaty of Bucarest had at last brought\r\npeace to that distracted part of the world. Those who knew their\r\ncentral Europe realized that Berlin had only forced Vienna to acquiesce\r\nin the Treaty of Bucarest because the time had not yet come. But come\r\nwhat might, Serbia and Montenegro, by having linked up their territory\r\nand by forming a mountain barrier from the Danube to the Adriatic, made\r\nit far more difficult for the invader to push his way through to the\r\nEast than it would have been before the battles of Kumanovo and\r\nBregalnica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREECE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n_From Ancient to Modern Greece_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Greece has two entirely different associations in our\r\nminds. Sometimes it calls up a wonderful literature enshrined in a\r\n‘dead language’, and exquisite works of a vanished art recovered by the\r\nspade; at other times it is connected with the currant-trade returns\r\nquoted on the financial page of our newspapers or with the ‘Balance of\r\nPower’ discussed in their leading articles. Ancient and Modern Greece\r\nboth mean much to us, but usually we are content to accept them as\r\nindependent phenomena, and we seldom pause to wonder whether there is\r\nany deeper connexion between them than their name. It is the purpose of\r\nthese pages to ask and give some answer to this question.\r\n\r\nThe thought that his own Greece might perish, to be succeeded by\r\nanother Greece after the lapse of more than two thousand years, would\r\nhave caused an Ancient Greek surprise. In the middle of the fifth\r\ncentury B.C., Ancient Greek civilization seemed triumphantly vigorous\r\nand secure. A generation before, it had flung back the onset of a\r\npolitical power which combined all the momentum of all the other\r\ncontemporary civilizations in the world; and the victory had proved not\r\nmerely the superiority of Greek arms—the Spartan spearman and the\r\nAthenian galley—but the superior vitality of Greek politics—the\r\nself-governing, self-sufficing city-state. In these cities a wonderful\r\nculture had burst into flower—an art expressing itself with equal\r\nmastery in architecture, sculpture, and drama, a science which ranged\r\nfrom the most practical medicine to the most abstract mathematics, and\r\na philosophy which blended art, science, and religion into an\r\never-developing and ever more harmonious view of the universe. A\r\ncivilization so brilliant and so versatile as this seemed to have an\r\ninfinite future before it, yet even here death lurked in ambush.\r\n\r\nWhen the cities ranged themselves in rival camps, and squandered their\r\nstrength on the struggle for predominance, the historian of the\r\nPeloponnesian war could already picture Athens and Sparta in ruins,[1]\r\nand the catastrophe began to warp the soul of Plato before he had\r\ncarried Greek philosophy to its zenith. This internecine strife of free\r\ncommunities was checked within a century by the imposition of a single\r\nmilitary autocracy over them all, and Alexander the Great crowned his\r\nfather Philip’s work by winning new worlds for Hellenism from the\r\nDanube to the Ganges and from the Oxus to the Nile. The city-state and\r\nits culture were to be propagated under his aegis, but this vision\r\nvanished with Alexander’s death, and Macedonian militarism proved a\r\ndisappointment. The feuds of these crowned condottieri harassed the\r\ncities more sorely than their own quarrels, and their arms could not\r\neven preserve the Hellenic heritage against external foes. The Oriental\r\nrallied and expelled Hellenism again from the Asiatic hinterland, while\r\nthe new cloud of Rome was gathering in the west. In four generations[2]\r\nof the most devastating warfare the world had seen, Rome conquered all\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean. Greek city and Greek dynast went down\r\nbefore her, and the political sceptre passed irrevocably from the\r\nHellenic nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Thucydides, Book I, chap. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 264-146 B.C.]\r\n\r\nYet this political abdication seemed to open for Hellenic culture a\r\nfuture more brilliant and assured than ever. Rome could organize as\r\nwell as conquer. She accepted the city-state as the municipal unit of\r\nthe Roman Empire, thrust back the Oriental behind the Euphrates, and\r\npromoted the Hellenization of all the lands between this river-frontier\r\nand the Balkans with much greater intensity than the Macedonian\r\nimperialists. Her political conquests were still further\r\ncounterbalanced by her spiritual surrender, and Hellenism was the soul\r\nof the new Latin culture which Rome created, and which advanced with\r\nRoman government over the vast untutored provinces of the west and\r\nnorth, bringing them, too, within the orbit of Hellenic civilization.\r\nUnder the shadow of the Roman Empire, Plutarch, the mirror of\r\nHellenism, could dwell in peace in his little city-state of Chaeronea,\r\nand reflect in his writings all the achievements of the Hellenic spirit\r\nas an ensample to an apparently endless posterity.\r\n\r\nYet the days of Hellenic culture were also numbered. Even Plutarch\r\nlived[1] to look down from the rocky citadel of Chaeronea upon Teutonic\r\nraiders wasting the Kephisos vale, and for more than three centuries\r\nsuccessive hordes of Goths searched out and ravaged the furthest\r\ncorners of European Greece. Then the current set westward to sweep\r\naway[2] the Roman administration in the Latin provinces, and Hellenism\r\nseemed to have been granted a reprieve. The Greek city-state of\r\nByzantium on the Black Sea Straits had been transformed into the Roman\r\nadministrative centre of Constantinople, and from this capital the\r\nEmperor Justinian in the sixth century A.D. still governed and defended\r\nthe whole Greek-speaking world. But this political glamour only threw\r\nthe symptoms of inward dissolution into sharper relief. Within the\r\nframework of the Empire the municipal liberty of the city-state had\r\nbeen stifled and extinguished by the waxing jungle of bureaucracy, and\r\nthe spiritual culture which the city-state fostered, and which was more\r\nessential to Hellenism than any political institutions, had been part\r\nejected, part exploited, and wholly compromised by a new gospel from\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: About A.D. 100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A.D. 404-476]\r\n\r\nWhile the Oriental had been compelled by Rome to draw his political\r\nfrontier at the Euphrates, and had failed so far to cross the\r\nriver-line, he had maintained his cultural independence within sight of\r\nthe Mediterranean. In the hill country of Judah, overlooking the high\r\nroad between Antioch and Alexandria, the two chief foci of Hellenism in\r\nthe east which the Macedonians had founded, and which had grown to\r\nmaturity under the aegis of Rome, there dwelt a little Semitic\r\ncommunity which had defied all efforts of Greek or Roman to assimilate\r\nit, and had finally given birth to a world religion about the time that\r\na Roman punitive expedition razed its holy city of Jerusalem to the\r\nground.[1] Christianity was charged with an incalculable force, which\r\nshot like an electric current from one end of the Roman Empire to the\r\nother. The highly-organized society of its adherents measured its\r\nstrength in several sharp conflicts with the Imperial administration,\r\nfrom which it emerged victorious, and it was proclaimed the official\r\nreligious organization of the Empire by the very emperor that founded\r\nConstantinople.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Constantine the Great recognized Christianity in A.D. 313\r\nand founded Constantinople in A.D. 328.]\r\n\r\nThe established Christian Church took the best energies of Hellenism\r\ninto its service. The Greek intellectuals ceased to become lecturers\r\nand professors, to find a more human and practical career in the\r\nbishop’s office. The Nicene Creed, drafted by an ‘oecumenical’\r\nconference of bishops under the auspices of Constantine himself,[1] was\r\nthe last notable formulation of Ancient Greek philosophy. The cathedral\r\nof Aya Sophia, with which Justinian adorned Constantinople, was the\r\nlast original creation of Ancient Greek art.[2] The same Justinian\r\nclosed the University of Athens, which had educated the world for nine\r\nhundred years and more, since Plato founded his college in the Academy.\r\nSix recalcitrant professors went into exile for their spiritual\r\nfreedom, but they found the devout Zoroastrianism of the Persian court\r\nas unsympathetic as the devout Christianity of the Roman. Their\r\nhumiliating return and recantation broke the ‘Golden Chain’ of Hellenic\r\nthought for ever.\r\n\r\nHellenism was thus expiring from its own inanition, when the inevitable\r\navalanche overwhelmed it from without. In the seventh century A.D.\r\nthere was another religious eruption in the Semitic world, this time in\r\nthe heart of Arabia, where Hellenism had hardly penetrated, and under\r\nthe impetus of Islam the Oriental burst his bounds again after a\r\nthousand years. Syria was reft away from the Empire, and Egypt, and\r\nNorth Africa as far as the Atlantic, and their political severance\r\nmeant their cultural loss to Greek civilization. Between the Koran and\r\nHellenism no fusion was possible. Christianity had taken Hellenism\r\ncaptive, but Islam gave it no quarter, and the priceless library of\r\nAlexandria is said to have been condemned by the caliph’s order to feed\r\nthe furnaces of the public baths.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 325.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Completed A.D. 538.]\r\n\r\nWhile Hellenism was thus cut short in the east, a mortal blow was\r\nstruck at its heart from the north. The Teuton had raided and passed\r\non, but the lands he had depopulated were now invaded by immigrants who\r\nhad come to stay. As soon as the last Goth and Lombard had gone west of\r\nthe Isonzo, the Slavs poured in from the north-eastern plains of Europe\r\nthrough the Moravian gap, crossed the Danube somewhere near the site of\r\nVienna, and drifted down along the eastern face of the Alps upon the\r\nAdriatic littoral. Rebuffed by the sea-board, the Slavonic migration\r\nwas next deflected east, and filtered through the Bosnian mountains,\r\nscattering the Latin-speaking provincials before it to left and right,\r\nuntil it debouched upon the broad basin of the river Morava. In this\r\nconcentration-area it gathered momentum during the earlier part of the\r\nseventh century A.D., and then burst out with irresistible force in all\r\ndirections, eastward across the Maritsa basin till it reached the Black\r\nSea, and southward down the Vardar to the shores of the Aegean.\r\n\r\nBeneath this Slavonic flood the Greek race in Europe was engulfed. A\r\nfew fortified cities held out, Adrianople on the Maritsa continued to\r\ncover Constantinople; Salonika at the mouth of the Vardar survived a\r\ntwo hundred years siege; while further south Athens, Korinth, and\r\nPatras escaped extinction. But the tide of invasion surged around their\r\nwalls. The Slavs mastered all the open country, and, pressing across\r\nthe Korinthian Gulf, established themselves in special force throughout\r\nthe Peloponnesos. The thoroughness of their penetration is witnessed to\r\nthis day by the Slavonic names which still cling to at least a third of\r\nthe villages, rivers, and mountains in European Greece, and are found\r\nin the most remote as well as in the most accessible quarters of the\r\nland.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For example: Tsimova and Panitsa in the Tainaron peninsula\r\n(Maina); Tsoupana and Khrysapha in Lakonia; Dhimitzana, Karytena, and\r\nAndhritsena in the centre of Peloponnesos, and Vostitsa on its north\r\ncoast; Dobrena and Kaprena in Boiotia; Vonitza on the Gulf of Arta;\r\nKardhitsa in the Thessalian plain.]\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the Slavs darkness descends like a curtain upon\r\nGreek history. We catch glimpses of Arab hosts ranging across Anatolia\r\nat will and gazing at Slavonic hordes across the narrow Bosphorus. But\r\nalways the Imperial fleet patrols the waters between, and always the\r\ntriple defences of Constantinople defy the assailant. Then after about\r\ntwo centuries the floods subside, the gloom disperses, and the Greek\r\nworld emerges into view once more. But the spectacle before us is\r\nunfamiliar, and most of the old landmarks have been swept away.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the ninth century A.D., the Imperial Government had\r\nreduced the Peloponnesos to order again, and found itself in the\r\npresence of three peoples. The greater part of the land was occupied by\r\n‘Romaioi’—normal, loyal, Christian subjects of the empire—but in the\r\nhilly country between Eurotas, Taygetos, and the sea, two Slavonic\r\ntribes still maintained themselves in defiant savagery and worshipped\r\ntheir Slavonic gods, while beyond them the peninsula of Tainaron, now\r\nknown as Maina, sheltered communities which still clung to the pagan\r\nname of Hellene and knew no other gods but Zeus, Athena, and Apollo.\r\nHellene and Slav need not concern us. They were a vanishing minority,\r\nand the Imperial Government was more successful in obliterating their\r\nindividuality than in making them contribute to its exchequer. The\r\nfuture lay with the Romaioi.\r\n\r\nThe speech of these Romaioi was not the speech of Rome. ‘Romaikà,’ as\r\nit is still called popularly in the country-side, is a development of\r\nthe ‘koinè’ or ‘current’ dialect of Ancient Greek, in which the\r\nSeptuagint and the New Testament are written. The vogue of these books\r\nafter the triumph of Christianity and the oncoming of the Dark Age,\r\nwhen they were the sole intellectual sustenance of the people, gave the\r\nidiom in which they were composed an exclusive prevalence. Except in\r\nTzakonia—the iron-bound coast between Cape Malea and Nauplia Bay—all\r\nother dialects of Ancient Greek became extinct, and the varieties of\r\nthe modern language are all differentiations of the ‘koinè’, along\r\ngeographical lines which in no way correspond with those which divided\r\nDoric from Ionian. Yet though Romaic is descended from the ‘koinè’, it\r\nis almost as far removed from it as modern Italian is from the language\r\nof St. Augustine or Cicero. Ancient Greek possessed a pitch-accent\r\nonly, which allowed the quantitative values of syllables to be measured\r\nagainst one another, and even to form the basis of a metrical system.\r\nIn Romaic the pitch-accent has transformed itself into a stress-accent\r\nalmost as violent as the English, which has destroyed all quantitative\r\nrelation between accented and unaccented syllables, often wearing away\r\nthe latter altogether at the termination of words, and always\r\nimpoverishing their vowel sounds. In the ninth century A.D. this new\r\nenunciation was giving rise to a new poetical technique founded upon\r\naccent and rhyme, which first essayed itself in folk-songs and\r\nballads,[1] and has since experimented in the same variety of forms as\r\nEnglish poetry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The earliest products of the modern technique were called\r\n‘city’ verses, because they originated in Constantinople, which has\r\nremained ‘the city’ _par excellence_ for the Romaic Greek ever since\r\nthe Dark Age made it the asylum of his civilization.]\r\n\r\nThese humble beginnings of a new literature were supplemented by the\r\nrudiments of a new art. Any visitor at Athens who looks at the three\r\ntiny churches [1] built in this period of first revival, and compares\r\nthem with the rare pre-Norman churches of England, will find the same\r\npromise of vitality in the Greek architecture as in his own. The\r\nmaterial—worked blocks of marble pillaged from ancient monuments,\r\nalternating with courses of contemporary brick—produces a completely\r\nnew aesthetic effect upon the eye; and the structure—a grouping of\r\nlesser cupolas round a central dome— is the very antithesis of the\r\n‘upright-and-horizontal’ style which confronts him in ruins upon the\r\nAkropolis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Old Metropolitan, the Kapnikaria, and St. Theodore.]\r\n\r\nThese first achievements of Romaic architecture speak by implication of\r\nthe characteristic difference between the Romaios and the Hellene. The\r\nlinguistic and the aesthetic change were as nothing compared to the\r\nchange in religion, for while the Hellene had been a pagan, the Romaios\r\nwas essentially a member of the Christian Church. Yet this new and\r\ndetermining characteristic was already fortified by tradition. The\r\nChurch triumphant had swiftly perfected its organisation on the model\r\nof the Imperial bureaucracy. Every Romaios owed ecclesiastical\r\nallegiance, through a hierarchy of bishops and metropolitans, to a\r\nsupreme patriarch at Constantinople, and in the ninth century this\r\nadministrative segregation of the imperial from the west-European\r\nChurch had borne its inevitable fruit in a dogmatic divergence, and\r\nripened into a schism between the Orthodox Christianity of the east on\r\nthe one hand and the Catholicism of the Latin world on the other.\r\n\r\nThe Orthodox Church exercised an important cultural influence over its\r\nRomaic adherents. The official language of its scriptures, creeds, and\r\nritual had never ceased to be the Ancient Greek ‘koinè’ and by keeping\r\nthe Romaios familiar with this otherwise obsolete tongue it kept him in\r\ntouch with the unsurpassable literature of his Ancient Greek\r\npredecessors. The vast body of Hellenic literature had perished during\r\nthe Dark Age, when all the energies of the race were absorbed by the\r\nmomentary struggle for survival; but about a third of the greatest\r\nauthors’ greatest works had been preserved, and now that the stress was\r\nrelieved, the wreckage of the remainder was sedulously garnered in\r\nanthologies, abridgements, and encyclopaedias. The rising monasteries\r\noffered a safe harbourage both for these compilations and for such\r\noriginals as survived unimpaired, and in their libraries they were\r\nhenceforth studied, cherished, and above all recopied with more or less\r\nsystematic care.\r\n\r\nThe Orthodox Church was thus a potent link between past and present,\r\nbut the most direct link of all was the political survival of the\r\nEmpire. Here, too, many landmarks had been swept away. The marvellous\r\nsystem of Roman Law had proved too subtle and complex for a world in\r\nthe throes of dissolution. Within a century of its final codification\r\nby Justinian’s commissioners) it had begun to fall into disuse, and was\r\nnow replaced by more summary legislation, which was as deeply imbued\r\nwith Mosaic principles as the literary language with the Hebraisms of\r\nthe New Testament, and bristled with barbarous applications of the _Lex\r\nTalionis_. The administrative organization instituted by Augustus and\r\nelaborated by Diocletian had likewise disappeared, and the army-corps\r\ndistricts were the only territorial units that outlasted the Dark Age.\r\nYet the tradition of order lived on. The army itself preserved Roman\r\ndiscipline and technique to a remarkable degree, and the military\r\ndistricts were already becoming the basis for a reconstituted civil\r\ngovernment. The wealth of Latin technicalities incorporated in the\r\nGreek style of ninth-century officialdom witnesses to this continuity\r\nwith the past and to the consequent political superiority of the Romaic\r\nEmpire over contemporary western Europe.\r\n\r\nWithin the Imperial frontiers the Romaic race was offered an apparently\r\nsecure field for its future development. In the Balkan peninsula the\r\nSlav had been expelled or assimilated to the south of a line stretching\r\nfrom Avlona to Salonika. East of Salonika the empire still controlled\r\nlittle more in Europe than the ports of the littoral, and a military\r\nhighway linking them with each other and with Constantinople. But\r\nbeyond the Bosphorus the frontier included the whole body of Anatolia\r\nas far as Taurus and Euphrates, and here was the centre of gravity both\r\nof the Romaic state and of the Romaic nation.\r\n\r\nA new Greek nation had in fact come into being, and it found itself in\r\ntouch with new neighbours, whom the Ancient Greek had never known.\r\nEastward lay the Armenians, reviving, like the Greeks, after the ebb of\r\nthe Arab flood, and the Arabs themselves, quiescent within their\r\nnatural bounds and transfusing the wisdom of Aristotle and Hippokrates\r\ninto their native culture. Both these peoples were sundered from the\r\nOrthodox Greek by religion[1] as well as by language, but a number of\r\nnationalities established on his opposite flank had been evangelized\r\nfrom Constantinople and followed the Orthodox patriarch in his schism\r\nwith Rome. The most important neighbour of the Empire in this quarter\r\nwas the Bulgarian kingdom, which covered all the Balkan hinterland from\r\nthe Danube and the Black Sea to the barrier-fortresses of Adrianople\r\nand Salonika. It had been founded by a conquering caste of non-Slavonic\r\nnomads from the trans-Danubian steppes, but these were completely\r\nabsorbed in the Slavonic population which they had endowed with their\r\nname and had preserved by political consolidation from the fate of\r\ntheir brethren further south. This Bulgarian state included a large\r\n‘Vlach’ element descended from those Latin-speaking provincials whom\r\nthe Slavs had pushed before them in their original migration; while the\r\nmain body of the ‘Rumans’, whom the same thrust of invasion had driven\r\nleftwards across the Danube, had established itself in the mountains of\r\nTransylvania, and was just beginning to push down into the Wallachian\r\nand Moldavian plains. Like the Bulgars, this Romance population had\r\nchosen the Orthodox creed, and so had the purely Slavonic Serbs, who\r\nhad replaced the Rumans in the basin of the Morava and the Bosnian\r\nhills, as far westward as the Adriatic coast. Beyond, the heathen\r\nMagyars had pressed into the Danubian plains like a wedge, and cut off\r\nthe Orthodox world from the Latin-Teutonic Christendom of the west; but\r\nit looked as though the two divisions of Europe were embarked upon the\r\nsame course of development. Both were evolving a system of\r\nstrongly-knit nationalities, neither wholly interdependent nor wholly\r\nself-sufficient, but linked together in their individual growth by the\r\nties of common culture and religion. In both the darkness was passing.\r\nThe future of civilization seemed once more assured, and in the\r\nOrthodox world the new Greek nation seemed destined to play the leading\r\npart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Armenians split off from the Catholic Church four\r\ncenturies before the schism between the Roman and Orthodox sections of\r\nthe latter.]\r\n\r\nHis cultural and political heritage from his ancient predecessors gave\r\nthe Romaic Greek in this period of revival an inestimable advantage\r\nover his cruder neighbours, and his superiority declared itself in an\r\nexpansion of the Romaic Empire. In the latter half of the tenth century\r\nA.D. the nest of Arab pirates from Spain, which had established itself\r\nin Krete and terrorized the Aegean, was exterminated by the Emperor\r\nNikiphóros Phokas, and on the eastern marches Antioch was gathered\r\nwithin the frontier at the Arabs’ expense, and advanced posts pushed\r\nacross Euphrates. In the first half of the eleventh century Basil,\r\n‘Slayer of the Bulgars’, destroyed the Balkan kingdom after a\r\ngeneration of bitter warfare, and brought the whole interior of the\r\npeninsula under the sway of Constantinople. His successors turned their\r\nattention to the cast again, and attracted one Armenian principality\r\nafter another within the Imperial protectorate. Nor was the revival\r\nconfined to politics. The conversion of the Russians about A.D. 1000\r\nopened a boundless hinterland to the Orthodox Church, and any one who\r\nglances at a series of Greek ivory carvings or studies Greek history\r\nfrom the original sources, will here encounter a literary and artistic\r\nrenaissance remarkable enough to explain the fascination which the\r\nbarbarous Russian and the outlandish Armenian found in Constantinople.\r\nYet this renaissance had hardly set in before it was paralysed by an\r\nunexpected blow, which arrested the development of Modern Greece for\r\nseven centuries.\r\n\r\nModern, like Ancient, Greece was assailed in her infancy by a conqueror\r\nfrom the east, and, unlike Ancient Greece, she succumbed. Turkish\r\nnomads from the central Asiatic steppes had been drifting into the\r\nMoslem world as the vigour of the Arabs waned. First they came as\r\nslaves, then as mercenaries, until at last, in the eleventh century,\r\nthe clan of Seljuk grasped with a strong hand the political dominion of\r\nIslam. As champions of the caliph the Turkish sultans disputed the\r\ninfidels encroachment on the Moslem border. They challenged the Romaic\r\nEmpire’s progress in Armenia, and in A.D. 1071—five years after the\r\nNorman founded at Hastings the strong government which has been the\r\nmaking of England—the Seljuk Turk shattered at the battle of Melasgerd\r\nthat heritage of strong government which had promised so much to\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nMelasgerd opened the way to Anatolia. The Arab could make no lodgement\r\nthere, but in the central steppe of the temperate plateau the Turk\r\nfound a miniature reproduction of his original environment. Tribe after\r\ntribe crossed the Oxus, to make the long pilgrimage to these new\r\nmarches which their race had won for Islam on the west, and the\r\ncivilization developed in the country by fifteen centuries of intensive\r\nand undisturbed Hellenization was completely blotted out. The cities\r\nwore isolated from one another till their commerce fell into decay. The\r\nelaborately cultivated lands around them were left fallow till they\r\nwere good for nothing but the pasturage which was all that the nomad\r\nrequired. The only monuments of architecture that have survived in\r\nAnatolia above ground are the imposing khans or fortified rest-houses\r\nbuilt by the Seljuk sultans themselves after the consolidation of their\r\nrule, and they are the best witnesses of the vigorous barbarism by\r\nwhich Romaic culture was effaced. The vitality of the Turk was indeed\r\nunquestionable. He imposed his language and religion upon the native\r\nAnatolian peasantry, as the Greek had imposed his before him, and in\r\ntime adopted their sedentary life, though too late to repair the\r\nmischief his own nomadism had wrought. Turk and Anatolian coalesced\r\ninto one people; every mountain, river, lake, bridge, and village in\r\nthe country took on a Turkish name, and a new nation was established\r\nfor ever in the heart of the Romaic world, which nourished itself on\r\nthe life-blood of the Empire and was to prove the supreme enemy, of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThis sequel to Melasgerd sealed the Empire’s doom. Robbed of its\r\nAnatolian governing class and its Anatolian territorial army, it ceased\r\nto be self-sufficient, and the defenders it attracted from the west\r\nwere at least as destructive as its eastern foes. The brutal régime of\r\nthe Turks in the pilgrimage places of Syria had roused a storm of\r\nindignation in Latin Europe, and a cloud gathered in the west once\r\nmore. It was heralded by adventurers from Normandy, who had first\r\nserved the Romaic Government as mercenaries in southern Italy and then\r\nexpelled their employers, about the time of Melasgerd, from their last\r\nfoothold in the peninsula. Raids across the straits of Otranto carried\r\nthe Normans up to the walls of Salonika, their fleets equipped in\r\nSicily scoured the Aegean, and, before the eleventh century was out,\r\nthey had followed up these reconnoitring expeditions by conducting\r\nLatin Christendom on its first crusade. The crusaders assembled at\r\nConstantinople, and the Imperial Government was relieved when the flood\r\nrolled on and spent itself further east. But one wave was followed by\r\nanother, and the Empire itself succumbed to the fourth. In A.D. 1204,\r\nConstantinople was stormed by a Venetian flotilla and the crusading\r\nhost it conveyed on board, and more treasures of Ancient Hellenism were\r\ndestroyed in the sack of its hitherto inviolate citadel than had ever\r\nperished by the hand of Arab or Slav.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the capital the Empire dissolved in chaos, Venice and\r\nGenoa, the Italian trading cities whose fortune had been made by the\r\ncrusades, now usurped the naval control of the Mediterranean which the\r\nEmpire had exercised since Nikiphóros pacified Krete. They seized all\r\nstrategical points of vantage on the Aegean coasts, and founded an\r\n‘extra-territorial’ community at Pera across the Golden Horn, to\r\nmonopolize the trade of Constantinople with the Black Sea. The Latins\r\nfailed to retain their hold on Constantinople itself, for the puppet\r\nemperors of their own race whom they enthroned there were evicted\r\nwithin a century by Romaic dynasts, who clung to such fragments of\r\nAnatolia as had escaped the Turk. But the Latin dominion was less\r\nephemeral in the southernmost Romaic provinces of Europe. The Latins’\r\ncastles, more conspicuous than the relics of Hellas, still crown many\r\nhigh hills in Greece, and their French tongue has added another strain,\r\nto the varied nomenclature of the country.[1] Yet there also\r\npandemonium prevailed. Burgundian barons, Catalan condottieri, and\r\nFlorentine bankers snatched the Duchy of Athens from one another in\r\nbewildering succession, while the French princes of Achaia were at feud\r\nwith their kindred vassals in the west of the Peloponnesos whenever\r\nthey were not resisting the encroachments of Romaic despots in the\r\nsouth and east. To complete the anarchy, the non-Romaic peoples in the\r\ninterior of the Balkan peninsula had taken the fall of Constantinople\r\nas a signal to throw off the Imperial yoke. In the hinterland of the\r\ncapital the Bulgars had reconstituted their kingdom. The\r\nRomance-speaking Vlachs of Pindus moved down into the Thessalian\r\nplains. The aboriginal Albanians, who with their back to the Adriatic\r\nhad kept the Slavs at bay, asserted their vitality and sent out\r\nmigratory swarms to the south, which entered the service of the warring\r\nprincelets and by their prowess won broad lands in every part of\r\ncontinental Greece, where Albanian place-names are to this day only\r\nless common than Slavonic. South-eastern Europe was again in the throes\r\nof social dissolution, and the convulsions continued till they were\r\nstilled impartially by the numbing hand of their ultimate author the\r\nTurk.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: e.g. Klemoutsi, Glarentsa (Clarence) and Gastouni—villages\r\nof the currant district in Peloponnesos—and Sant-Omeri, the mountain\r\nthat overlooks them.]\r\n\r\nThe Seljuk sultanate in Anatolia, shaken by the crusades, had gone the\r\nway of all oriental empires to make room for one of its fractions,\r\nwhich showed a most un-oriental faculty of organic growth. This was the\r\nextreme march on the north-western rim of the Anatolian plateau,\r\noverlooking the Asiatic littoral of the Sea of Marmora. It had been\r\nfounded by one of those Turkish chiefs who migrated with their clans\r\nfrom beyond the Oxus; and it was consolidated by Othman his son, who\r\nextended his kingdom to the cities on the coast and invested his\r\nsubjects with his own name. In 1355 the Narrows of Gallipoli passed\r\ninto Ottoman hands, and opened a bridge to unexpected conquests in\r\nEurope. Serbia and Bulgaria collapsed at the first attack, and the\r\nhosts which marched to liberate them from Hungary and from France only\r\nministered to Ottoman prestige by their disastrous discomfiture. Before\r\nthe close of the fourteenth century the Ottoman sultan had transferred\r\nhis capital to Adrianople, and had become immeasurably the strongest\r\npower in the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nAfter that the end came quickly. At Constantinople the Romaic dynasty\r\nof Palaiologos had upheld a semblance of the Empire for more than a\r\ncentury after the Latin was expelled. But in 1453 the Imperial city\r\nfell before the assault of Sultan Mohammed; and before his death the\r\nconqueror eliminated all the other Romaic and Latin principalities from\r\nPeloponnesos to Trebizond, which had survived as enclaves to mar the\r\nuniformity of the Ottoman domain. Under his successors the tide of\r\nOttoman conquest rolled on for half a century more over south-eastern\r\nEurope, till it was stayed on land beneath the ramparts of Vienna,[1]\r\nand culminated on sea, after the systematic reduction of the Venetian\r\nstrongholds, in the capture of Rhodes from the Knights of St. John.[2]\r\nThe Romaic race, which had been split into so many fragments during the\r\ndissolution of the Empire, was reunited again in the sixteenth century\r\nunder the common yoke of the Turk.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1526.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 1522.]\r\n\r\nEven in the Dark Age, Greece had hardly been reduced to so desperate a\r\ncondition as now. Through the Dark Age the Greek cities had maintained\r\na continuous life, but Mohammed II depopulated Constantinople to\r\nrepeople it with a Turkish majority from Anatolia. Greek commerce would\r\nnaturally have benefited by the ejection of the Italians from the\r\nLevant, had not the Ottoman Government given asylum simultaneously to\r\nthe Jews expelled from Spain. These Sephardim established themselves at\r\nConstantinople, Salonika, and all the other commercial centres of the\r\nOttoman dominion, and their superiority in numbers and industry made\r\nthem more formidable urban rivals of the Greeks than the Venetians and\r\nGenoese had ever been.\r\n\r\nOusted from the towns, the Greek race depended for its preservation on\r\nthe peasantry, yet Greece had never suffered worse rural oppression\r\nthan under the Ottoman régime. The sultan’s fiscal demands were the\r\nleast part of the burden. The paralysing land-tax, collected in kind by\r\nirresponsible middlemen, was an inheritance from the Romaic Empire, and\r\nthough it was now reinforced by the special capitation-tax levied by\r\nthe sultan on his Christian subjects, the greater efficiency and\r\nsecurity of his government probably compensated for the additional\r\ncharge. The vitality of Greece was chiefly sapped by the ruthless\r\nmilitary organization of the Ottoman state. The bulk of the Ottoman\r\narmy was drawn from a feudal cavalry, bound to service, as in the\r\nmediaeval Latin world, in return for fiefs or ‘timaria’ assigned to\r\nthem by their sovereign; and many beys and agas have bequeathed their\r\nnames in perpetuity to the richest villages on the Messenian and\r\nThessalian plains, to remind the modern peasant that his Christian\r\nancestors once tilled the soil as serfs of a Moslem timariot. But the\r\nsultan, unlike his western contemporaries, was not content with\r\nirregular troops, and the serf-communes of Greece had to deliver up a\r\nfifth of their male children every fourth year to be trained at\r\nConstantinople as professional soldiers and fanatical Moslems. This\r\ncorps of ‘Janissaries’[1] was founded in the third generation of the\r\nOttoman dynasty, and was the essential instrument of its military\r\nsuccess. One race has never appropriated and exploited the vitality of\r\nanother in so direct or so brutal a fashion, and the institution of\r\n‘tribute-children’, so long as it lasted, effectually prevented any\r\nrecovery of the Greek nation from the untimely blows which had stricken\r\nit down.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Yeni Asker—New soldiery.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n_The Awakening of the Nation_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the two centuries that followed the Ottoman conquest of\r\nConstantinople, the Greek race was in serious danger of annihilation.\r\nIts life-blood was steadily absorbed into the conquering\r\ncommunity—quite regularly by the compulsory tribute of children and\r\nspasmodically by the voluntary conversion of individual households. The\r\nrich apostasized, because too heavy a material sacrifice was imposed\r\nupon them by loyalty to their national religion; the destitute, because\r\nthey could not fail to improve their prospects by adhering to the\r\nprivileged faith. Even the surviving organization of the Church had\r\nonly been spared by the Ottoman Government in order to facilitate its\r\nown political system—by bringing the peasant, through the hierarchy of\r\npriest, bishop, and patriarch, under the moral control of the new\r\nMoslem master whom the ecclesiastics henceforth served.\r\n\r\nThe scale on which wholesale apostasy was possible is shown by the case\r\nof Krete, which was conquered by the Turks from Venice just after these\r\ntwo centuries had closed, and was in fact the last permanent addition\r\nto the Turkish Empire. No urban or feudal settlers of Turkish blood\r\nwere imported into the island. To this day the uniform speech of all\r\nKretans is their native Greek. And yet the progressive conversion of\r\nwhole clans and villages had transferred at least 20 per cent. of the\r\npopulation to the Moslem ranks before the Ottoman connexion was severed\r\nagain in 1897.\r\n\r\nThe survival of the Greek nationality did not depend on any efforts of\r\nthe Greeks themselves. They were indeed no longer capable of effort,\r\nbut lay passive under the hand of the Turk, like the paralysed quarry\r\nof some beast of prey. Their fate was conditional upon the development\r\nof the Ottoman state, and, as the two centuries drew to a close, that\r\nstate entered upon a phase of transformation and of consequent\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman organism has always displayed (and never more conspicuously\r\nthan at the present moment) a much greater stability and vitality than\r\nany of its oriental predecessors. There was a vein of genius in its\r\ncreators, and its youthful expansion permeated it with so much European\r\nblood that it became partly Europeanized in its inner\r\ntissues—sufficiently to partake, at any rate, in that faculty of\r\nindefinite organic growth which has so far revealed itself in European\r\nlife. This acquired force has carried it on since the time when the\r\nimpetus of its original institutions became spent—a time when purely\r\noriental monarchies fall to pieces, and when Turkey herself hesitated\r\nbetween reconstruction and dissolution. That critical period began for\r\nher with the latter half of the seventeenth century, and incidentally\r\nopened new opportunities of life to her subject Greeks.\r\n\r\nSubstantial relief from their burdens—the primary though negative\r\ncondition of national revival—accrued to the Greek peasantry from the\r\ndecay of Ottoman militarism in all its branches. The Turkish feudal\r\naristocracy, which had replaced the landed nobility of the Romaic\r\nEmpire in Anatolia and established itself on the choicest lands in\r\nconquered Europe, was beginning to decline in strength. We have seen\r\nthat it failed to implant itself in Krete, and its numbers were already\r\nstationary elsewhere. The Greek peasant slowly began to regain ground\r\nupon his Moslem lord, and he profited further by the degeneration of\r\nthe janissary corps at the heart of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe janissaries had started as a militant, almost monastic body,\r\ncondemned to celibacy, and recruited exclusively from the Christian\r\ntribute-children. But in 1566 they extorted the privilege of legal\r\nmarriage for themselves, and of admittance into the corps for the sons\r\nof their wedlock. The next century completed their transformation from\r\na standing army into a hereditary urban militia—an armed and privileged\r\n_bourgeoisie_, rapidly increasing in numbers and correspondingly\r\njealous of extraneous candidates for the coveted vacancies in their\r\nranks. They gradually succeeded in abolishing the enrolment of\r\nChristian recruits altogether, and the last regular levy of children\r\nfor that purpose was made in 1676. Vested interests at Constantinople\r\nhad freed the helpless peasant from the most crushing burden of all.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the contemporary tendency in western Europe towards\r\nbureaucratic centralization began to extend itself to the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. Its exponents were the brothers Achmet and Mustapha Köprili,\r\nwho held the grand-vizierate in succession. They laid the foundations\r\nof a centralized administration, and, since the unadaptable Turk\r\noffered no promising material for their policy, they sought their\r\ninstruments in the subject race. The continental Greeks were too\r\neffectively crushed to aspire beyond the preservation of their own\r\nexistence; but the islands had been less sorely tried, and Khios, which\r\nhad enjoyed over two centuries[1] of prosperity under the rule of a\r\nGenoese chartered company, and exchanged it for Ottoman sovereignty\r\nunder peculiarly lenient conditions, could still supply Achmet a\r\ncentury later with officials of the intelligence and education he\r\nrequired, Khiots were the first to fill the new offices of ‘Dragoman of\r\nthe Porte’ (secretary of state) and ‘Dragoman of the Fleet’ (civil\r\ncomplement of the Turkish capitan-pasha); and they took care in their\r\nturn to staff the subordinate posts of their administration with a host\r\nof pushing friends and dependants. The Dragoman of the Fleet wielded\r\nthe fiscal, and thereby in effect the political, authority over the\r\nGreek islands in the Aegean; but this was not the highest power to\r\nwhich the new Greek bureaucracy attained. Towards the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century Moldavia and Wallachia—the two ‘Danubian Provinces’\r\nnow united in the kingdom of Rumania—were placed in charge of Greek\r\nofficials with the rank of voivode or prince, and with practically\r\nsovereign power within their delegated dominions. A Danubian\r\nprincipality became the reward of a successful dragoman’s career, and\r\nthese high posts were rapidly monopolized by a close ring of official\r\nfamilies, who exercised their immense patronage in favour of their\r\nrace, and congregated round the Greek patriarch in the ‘Phanari’,[2]\r\nthe Constantinopolitan slum assigned him for his residence by Mohammed\r\nthe Conqueror.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1346-1566.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ‘Lighthouse-quarter.’]\r\n\r\nThe alliance of this parvenu ‘Phanariot’ aristocracy with the\r\nconservative Orthodox Church was not unnatural, for the Church itself\r\nhad greatly extended its political power under Ottoman suzerainty. The\r\nOttoman Government hardly regarded its Christian subjects as integral\r\nmembers of the state, and was content to leave their civil government\r\nin the hands of their spiritual pastors to an extent the Romaic\r\nemperors would never have tolerated. It allowed the Patriarchate at\r\nConstantinople to become its official intermediary with the Greek race,\r\nand it further extended the Greek patriarch’s authority over the other\r\nconquered populations of Orthodox faith—Bulgars, Rumans, and\r\nSerbs—which had never been incorporated in the ecclesiastical or\r\npolitical organization of the Romaic Empire, but which learnt under\r\nOttoman rule to receive their priests and bishops from the Greek\r\necclesiastics of the capital, and even to call themselves by the Romaic\r\nname. In 1691 Mustapha Köprili recognized and confirmed the rights of\r\nall Christian subjects of the Sultan by a general organic law.\r\n\r\nMustapha’s ‘New Ordinance’ was dictated by the reverses which\r\nChristians beyond the frontier were inflicting upon the Ottoman arms,\r\nfor pressure from without had followed hard upon disintegration within.\r\nAchmet’s pyrrhic triumph over Candia in 1669 was followed in 1683 by\r\nhis brother Mustapha’s disastrous discomfiture before the walls of\r\nVienna, and these two sieges marked the turn of the Ottoman tide. The\r\nebb was slow, yet the ascendancy henceforth lay with Turkey’s Christian\r\nneighbours, and they began to cut short her frontiers on every side.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians had never lost hold upon the ‘Ionian’ chain of islands—\r\nCorfù, Cefalonia, Zante, and Cerigo—which flank the western coast of\r\nGreece, and in 1685 they embarked on an offensive on the mainland,\r\nwhich won them undisputed possession of Peloponnesos for twenty\r\nyears.[1] Venice was far nearer than Turkey to her dissolution, and\r\nspent the last spasm of her energy on this ephemeral conquest. Yet she\r\nhad maintained the contact of the Greek race with western Europe during\r\nthe two centuries of despair, and the interlude of her rule in\r\nPeloponnesos was a fitting culmination to her work; for, brief though\r\nit was, it effectively broke the Ottoman tradition, and left behind it\r\na system of communal self-government among the Peloponnesian Greeks\r\nwhich the returning Turk was too feeble to sweep away. The Turks gained\r\nnothing by the rapid downfall of Venice, for Austria as rapidly stepped\r\ninto her place, and pressed with fresh vigour the attack from the\r\nnorth-west. North-eastward, too, a new enemy had arisen in Russia,\r\nwhich had been reorganized towards the turn of the century by Peter the\r\nGreat with a radical energy undreamed of by any Turkish Köprili, and\r\nwhich found its destiny in opposition to the Ottoman Empire. The new\r\nOrthodox power regarded itself as the heir of the Romaic Empire from\r\nwhich it had received its first Christianity and culture. It aspired to\r\nrepay the Romaic race in adversity by championing it against its Moslem\r\noppressors, and sought its own reward in a maritime outlet on the Black\r\nSea. From the beginning of the eighteenth century Russia repeatedly\r\nmade war on Turkey, either with or without the co-operation of Austria;\r\nbut the decisive bout in the struggle was the war of 1769-74. A Russian\r\nfleet appeared in the Mediterranean, raised an insurrection in\r\nPeloponnesos, and destroyed the Turkish squadron in battle. The Russian\r\narmies were still more successful on the steppes, and the Treaty of\r\nKutchuk Kainardji not only left the whole north coast of the Black Sea\r\nin Russia’s possession, but contained an international sanction for the\r\nrights of the sultan’s Orthodox subjects. In 1783 a supplementary\r\ncommercial treaty extorted for the Ottoman Greeks the right to trade\r\nunder the Russian flag. The territorial sovereignty of Turkey in the\r\nAegean remained intact, but the Russian guarantee gave the Greek race a\r\nmore substantial security than the shadowy ordinance of Mustapha\r\nKöprili. The paralysing prestige of the Porte was broken, and Greek\r\neyes were henceforth turned in hope towards Petersburg.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1699-1718.]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the eighteenth century the condition of the Greeks had in\r\nfact changed remarkably for the better, and the French and English\r\ntravellers who now began to visit the Ottoman Empire brought away the\r\nimpression that a critical change in its internal equilibrium was at\r\nhand. The Napoleonic wars had just extinguished the Venetian Republic\r\nand swept the Ionian Islands into the struggle between England and\r\nFrance for the mastery of the Mediterranean. England had fortified\r\nherself in Cefalonia and Zante, France in Corfù, and interest centred\r\non the opposite mainland, where Ali Pasha of Yannina maintained a\r\nformidable neutrality towards either power.\r\n\r\nThe career of Ali marked that phase in the decline of an Oriental\r\nempire when the task of strong government becomes too difficult for the\r\ncentral authority and is carried on by independent satraps with greater\r\nefficiency in their more limited sphere. Ali governed the Adriatic\r\nhinterland with practically sovereign power, and compelled the sultan\r\nfor some years to invest his sons with the pashaliks of Thessaly and\r\nPeloponnesos. The greater part of the Greek race thus came in some\r\ndegree under his control, and his policy towards it clearly reflected\r\nthe transition from the old to the new. He waged far more effective war\r\nthan the distant sultan upon local liberties, and, though the\r\nelimination of the feudal Turkish landowner was pure gain to the\r\nGreeks, they suffered themselves from the loss of traditional\r\nprivileges which the original Ottoman conquest had left intact. The\r\nArmatoli, a local Christian militia who kept order in the mountainous\r\nmainland north of Peloponnesos where Turkish feudatories were rare,\r\nwere either dispersed by Ali or enrolled in his regular army. And he\r\nwas ruthless in the extermination of recalcitrant communities, like\r\nAgrapha on the Aspropotarno, which had never been inscribed on the\r\ntaxation-rolls of the Romaic or the Ottoman treasury, or Suli, a robber\r\nclan ensconced in the mountains Immediately west of Ali’s capital. On\r\nthe other hand, the administration of these pacified and consolidated\r\ndominions became as essentially Greek in character as the Phanariot\r\nrégime beyond the Danube. Ali was a Moslem and an Albanian, but the\r\nOrthodox Greeks were in a majority among his subjects, and he knew how\r\nto take advantage of their abilities. His business was conducted by\r\nGreek secretaries in the Greek tongue, and Yannina, his capital, was a\r\nGreek city. European visitors to Yannina (for every one began the\r\nLevantine tour by paying his respects to Ali) were struck by the\r\nenterprise and intelligence of its citizens. The doctors were\r\ncompetent, because they had taken their education in Italy or France;\r\nthe merchants were prosperous, because they had established members of\r\ntheir family at Odessa, Trieste, or even Hamburg, as permanent agents\r\nof their firm. A new Greek _bourgeoisie_ had arisen, in close contact\r\nwith the professional life of western Europe, and equally responsive to\r\nthe new philosophical and political ideas that were being propagated by\r\nthe French Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis intellectual ferment was the most striking change of all. Since\r\nthe sack of Constantinople in 1204, Greek culture had retired into the\r\nmonasteries—inaccessible fastnesses where the monks lived much the same\r\nlife as the clansmen of Suli or Agrapha. Megaspélaion, the great cave\r\nquarried in the wall of a precipitous Peloponnesian ravine; Metéora,\r\nsuspended on half a dozen isolated pinnacles of rock in Thessaly, where\r\nthe only access was by pulley or rope-ladder; ‘Ayon Oros’, the\r\nconfederation of monasteries great and small upon the\r\nmountain-promontory of Athos—these succeeded in preserving a shadow of\r\nthe old tradition, at the cost of isolation from all humane influences\r\nthat might have kept their spiritual inheritance alive. Their spirit\r\nwas mediaeval, ecclesiastical, and as barren as their sheltering rocks;\r\nand the new intellectual disciples of Europe turned to the monasteries\r\nin vain. The biggest ruin on Athos is a boys’ school planned in the\r\neighteenth century to meet the educational needs of all the Orthodox in\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, and wrecked on the reefs of monastic obscurantism.\r\nBut its founder, the Corfiot scholar Evyénios Voulgáris, did not\r\nhesitate to break with the past. He put his own educational ideas into\r\npractice at Yannina and Constantinople, and contributed to the great\r\nachievement of his contemporary, the Khiot Adhamandios Koráis, who\r\nsettled in Paris and there evolved a literary adaptation of the Romaic\r\npatois to supersede the lifeless travesty of Attic style traditionally\r\naffected by ecclesiastical penmen. But the renaissance was not confined\r\nto Greeks abroad. The school on Athos failed, but others established\r\nthemselves before the close of the eighteenth century in the people’s\r\nmidst, even in the smaller towns and the remoter villages. The still\r\nflourishing secondary school of Dhimitzána, in the heart of\r\nPeloponnesos, began its existence in this period, and the national\r\nrevival found expression in a new name. Its prophets repudiated the\r\n‘Romaic’ name, with its associations of ignorance and oppression, and\r\ntaught their pupils to think of themselves as ‘Hellenes’ and to claim\r\nin their own right the intellectual and political liberty of the\r\nAncient Greeks.\r\n\r\nThis spiritual ‘Hellenism’, however, was only one manifestation of\r\nreturning vitality, and was ultimately due to the concrete economic\r\ndevelopment with which it went hand in hand. The Greeks, who had found\r\nculture in western Europe, had come there for trade, and their\r\ncommercial no less than their intellectual activity reacted in a\r\npenetrating way upon their countrymen at home. A mountain village like\r\nAmbelakia in Thessaly found a regular market for its dyed goods in\r\nGermany, and the commercial treaty of 1783 between Turkey and Russia\r\nencouraged communities which could make nothing of the land to turn\r\ntheir attention to the sea. Galaxhidi, a village on the northern shore\r\nof the Korinthian Gulf, whose only asset was its natural harbour, and\r\nHydhra, Spetza, and Psarà, three barren little islands in the Aegean,\r\nhad begun to lay the foundations of a merchant marine, when Napoleon’s\r\nboycott and the British blockade, which left no neutral flag but the\r\nOttoman in the Mediterranean, presented the Greek shipmen that sailed\r\nunder it with an opportunity they exploited to the full. The\r\nwhitewashed houses of solid stone, rising tier above tier up the naked\r\nlimestone mountainside, still testify to the prosperity which chance\r\nthus suddenly brought to the Hydhriots and their fellow islanders, and\r\ndid not withdraw again till it had enabled them to play a decisive part\r\nin their nation’s history.\r\n\r\nTheir ships were small, but they were home-built, skilfully navigated,\r\nand profitably employed in the carrying trade of the Mediterranean\r\nports. Their economic life was based on co-operation, for the sailors,\r\nas well as the captain and owner of the ship, who were generally the\r\nsame person, took shares in the outlay and profit of each voyage; but\r\ntheir political organization was oligarchical—an executive council\r\nelected by and from the owners of the shipping. Feud and intrigue were\r\nrife between family and family, class and class, and between the native\r\ncommunity and the resident aliens, without seriously affecting the\r\nvigour and enterprise of the commonwealth as a whole. These seafaring\r\nislands on the eve of the modern Greek Revolution were an exact\r\nreproduction of the Aigina, Korinth, and Athens which repelled the\r\nPersian from Ancient Greece. The germs of a new national life were thus\r\nspringing up among the Greeks in every direction— in mercantile\r\ncolonies scattered over the world from Odessa to Alexandria and from\r\nSmyrna to Trieste; among Phanariot princes in the Danubian Provinces\r\nand their ecclesiastical colleagues at Constantinople; in the islands\r\nof the Aegean and the Ionian chain, and upon the mountains of Suli and\r\nAgrapha. But the ambitions this national revival aroused were even\r\ngreater than the reality itself. The leaders of the movement did not\r\nmerely aspire to liberate the Greek nation from the Turkish yoke. They\r\nwere conscious of the assimilative power their nationality possessed.\r\nThe Suliots, for example, were an immigrant Albanian tribe, who had\r\nlearnt to speak Greek from the Greek peasants over whom they\r\ntyrannized. The Hydhriot and Spetziot islanders were Albanians too, who\r\nhad even clung to their primitive language during the two generations\r\nsince they took up their present abode, but had become none the less\r\nfirmly linked to their Greek-speaking neighbours in Peloponnesos by\r\ntheir common fellowship in the Orthodox Church. The numerous Albanian\r\ncolonies settled up and down the Greek continent were at least as Greek\r\nin feeling as they. And why should not the same prove true of the\r\nBulgarian population, in the Balkans, who had belonged from the\r\nbeginning to the Orthodox Church, and had latterly been brought by\r\nimprovident Ottoman policy within the Greek patriarch’s fold? Or why\r\nshould not the Greek administrators beyond the Danube imbue their Ruman\r\nsubjects with a sound Hellenic sentiment? In fact, the prophets of\r\nHellenism did not so much desire to extricate the Greek nation from the\r\nOttoman Empire as to make it the ruling element in the empire itself by\r\nejecting the Moslem Turks from their privileged position and\r\nassimilating all populations of Orthodox faith. These dreams took shape\r\nin the foundation of a secret society—the ‘Philikì Hetairía’ or ‘League\r\nof Friends’—which established itself at Odessa in 1814 with the\r\nconnivence of the Russian police, and opened a campaign of propaganda\r\nin anticipation of an opportunity to strike.\r\n\r\nThe initiative came from the Ottoman Government itself. At the weakest\r\nmoment in its history the empire found in Sultan Mahmud a ruler of\r\npeculiar strength, who saw that the only hope of overcoming his dangers\r\nlay in meeting them half-way. The national movement of Hellenism was\r\ngathering momentum in the background, but it was screened by the\r\npersonal ambitions of Ali of Yannina, and Mahmud reckoned to forestall\r\nboth enemies by quickly striking Ali down.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1819-20 Ali was outlawed, and in the spring the\r\ninvasion of his territories began. Both the Moslem combatants enlisted\r\nChristian Armatoli, and all continental Greece was under arms. By the\r\nend of the summer Ali’s outlying strongholds had fallen, his armies\r\nwere driven in, and he himself was closely invested in Yannina; but\r\nwith autumn a deadlock set in, and the sultan’s reckoning was thrown\r\nout. In November 1820 the veteran soldier Khurshid was appointed to the\r\npashalik of Peloponnesos to hold the Greeks in check and close accounts\r\nwith Ali. In March 1821, after five months spent in organizing his\r\nprovince, Khurshid felt secure enough to leave it for the Yannina\r\nlines. But he was mistaken; for within a month of his departure\r\nPeloponnesos was ablaze.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Philikì Hetairía’ had decided to act, and the Peloponnesians\r\nresponded enthusiastically to the signal. In the north Germanòs,\r\nmetropolitan bishop of Patras, rallied the insurgents at the monastery\r\nof Megaspélaion, and unfurled the monastic altar-cloth as a national\r\nstandard. In the south the peninsula of Maina, which had been the\r\nlatest refuge of ancient Hellenism, was now the first to welcome the\r\nnew, and to throw off the shadowy allegiance it had paid for a thousand\r\nyears to Romaic archonts and Ottoman capitan-pashas. Led by Petros\r\nMavromichalis, the chief of the leading clan, the Mainates issued from\r\ntheir mountains. This was in April, and by the middle of May all the\r\nopen country had been swept clear, and the hosts joined hands before\r\nTripolitza, which was the seat of Ottoman government at the central\r\npoint of the province. The Turkish garrison attacked, but was heavily\r\ndefeated at Valtetzi by the tactical skill of Theodore Kolokotrónis the\r\n‘klepht’, who had become experienced in guerrilla warfare through his\r\nalternate professions of brigand and gendarme—a career that had\r\nincreased its possibilities as the Ottoman system decayed. After\r\nKolokotrónis’s victory, the Greeks kept Tripolitza under a close\r\nblockade. Early in October it fell amid frightful scenes of pillage and\r\nmassacre, and Ottoman dominion in the Peloponnesos fell with it. On\r\nJanuary 22, 1822, Korinth, the key to the isthmus, passed into the\r\nGreeks’ hands, and only four fortresses—Nauplia, Patras, Koron, and\r\nModhon—still held out within it against Greek investment. Not a Turk\r\nsurvived in the Peloponnesos beyond their walls, for the slaughter at\r\nTripolitza was only the most terrible instance of what happened\r\nwherever a Moslem colony was found. In Peloponnesos, at any rate, the\r\nrevolution had been grimly successful.\r\n\r\nThere had also been successes at sea. The merchant marine of the Greek\r\nislands had suffered grievously from the fall of Napoleon and the\r\nsettlement at Vienna, which, by restoring normal conditions of trade,\r\nhad destroyed their abnormal monopoly. The revolution offered new\r\nopportunities for profitable venture, and in April 1821 Hydhra, Spetza\r\nand Psarà hastened to send a privateering fleet to sea. As soon as the\r\nfleet crossed the Aegean, Samos rid itself of the Turks. At the\r\nbeginning of June the rickety Ottoman squadron issued from the\r\nDardanelles, but it was chased back by the islanders under the lee of\r\nMitylini. Memories of Russian naval tactics in 1770 led the Psariots to\r\nexperiment in fire-ships, and one of the two Turkish ships of the line\r\nfell a victim to this attack. Within a week of setting sail, the\r\ndiminished Turkish squadron was back again in the Dardanelles, and the\r\nislanders were left with the command of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe general Christian revolution thus seemed fairly launched, and in\r\nthe first panic the threatened Moslems began reprisals of an equally\r\ngeneral kind. In the larger Turkish cities there were massacres of\r\nChristian minorities, and the Government lent countenance to them by\r\nmurdering its own principal Christian official Gregorios, the Greek\r\npatriarch at Constantinople, on April 22, 1821. But Sultan Mahmud\r\nquickly recovered himself. He saw that his empire could not survive a\r\nracial war, and determined to prevent the present revolt from assuming\r\nsuch a character. His plan was to localize it by stamping out the more\r\ndistant sparks with all his energy, before concentrating his force at\r\nleisure upon the main conflagration.\r\n\r\nThis policy was justified by the event. On March 6 the ‘Philikì\r\nHetairia’ at Odessa had opened its own operations in grandiose style by\r\nsending a filibustering expedition across the Russo-Turkish frontier\r\nunder command of Prince Alexander Hypsilantis, a Phanariot in the\r\nRussian service. Hypsilantis played for a general revolt of the Ruman\r\npopulation in the Danubian Principalities and a declaration of war\r\nagainst Turkey on the part of Russia. But the Rumans had no desire to\r\nassist the Greek bureaucrats who oppressed them, and the Tsar Alexander\r\nhad been converted by the experiences of 1812-13 to a pacifistic\r\nrespect for the _status quo_. Prince Hypsilantis was driven\r\nignominiously to internment across the Austrian frontier, little more\r\nthan a hundred days after his expedition began; and his fiasco assured\r\nthe Ottoman Government of two encouraging facts—that the revolution\r\nwould not carry away the whole Orthodox population but would at any\r\nrate confine itself to the Greeks; and that the struggle against it\r\nwould be fought out for the present, at least, without foreign\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nIn the other direction, however, rebellion was spreading northward from\r\nPeloponnesos to continental Greece. Galaxídhi revolted in April, and\r\nwas followed in June by Mesolonghi—a prosperous town of fishermen,\r\nimpregnably situated in the midst of the lagoons at the mouth of the\r\nAspropotamo, beyond the narrows of the Korinthian Gulf. By the end of\r\nthe month, north-western Greece was free as far as the outposts of\r\nKhurshid Pasha beyond the Gulf of Arta.\r\n\r\nFurther eastward, again, in the mountains between the Gulf of Korinth\r\nand the river Elládha (Sperkheiòs), the Armatoli of Ali’s faction had\r\nheld their ground, and gladly joined the revolution on the initiative\r\nof their captains Dhiakos and Odhyssèvs. But the movement found its\r\nlimits. The Turkish garrison of Athens obstinately held out during the\r\nwinter of 1821-2, and the Moslems of Negrepont (Euboía) maintained\r\ntheir mastery in the island. In Agrapha they likewise held their own,\r\nand, after one severely punished raid, the Agraphiot Armatoli were\r\ninduced to re-enter the sultan’s service on liberal terms. The Vlachs\r\nin the gorges of the Aspropotamo were pacified with equal success; and\r\nDramali, Khurshid’s lieutenant, who guarded the communications between\r\nthe army investing Yannina and its base at Constantinople, was easily\r\nable to crush all symptoms of revolt in Thessaly from his head-quarters\r\nat Lárissa. Still further east, the autonomous Greek villages on the\r\nmountainous promontories of Khalkidhiki had revolted in May, in\r\nconjunction with the well-supplied and massively fortified monasteries\r\nof the ‘Ayon Oros’; but the Pasha of Salonika called down the South\r\nSlavonic Moslem landowners from the interior, sacked the villages, and\r\namnestied the monastic confederation on condition of establishing a\r\nTurkish garrison in their midst and confiscating their arms. The monks’\r\ncompliance was assisted by the excommunication under which the new\r\npatriarch at Constantinople had placed all the insurgents by the\r\nsultan’s command.\r\n\r\nThe movement was thus successfully localised on the European continent,\r\nand further afield it was still more easily cut short. After the\r\nwithdrawal of the Turkish squadron, the Greek fleet had to look on at\r\nthe systematic destruction of Kydhonies,[1] a flourishing Greek\r\nindustrial town on the mainland opposite Mitylini which had been\r\nfounded under the sultan’s auspices only forty years before. All that\r\nthe islanders could do was to take off the survivors in their boats;\r\nand when they dispersed to their ports in autumn, the Ottoman ships\r\ncame out again from the Dardanelles, sailed round Peloponnesos into the\r\nKorinthian Gulf, and destroyed Galaxídhi. A still greater catastrophe\r\nfollowed the reopening of naval operations next spring. In March 1822\r\nthe Samians landed a force on Khios and besieged the Turkish garrison,\r\nwhich was relieved after three weeks by the arrival of the Ottoman\r\nfleet. A month later the Greek fleet likewise appeared on the scene,\r\nand on June 18 a Psariot captain, Constantine Kanaris, actually\r\ndestroyed the Ottoman flag-ship by a daring fire-ship attack. Upon this\r\nthe Ottoman fleet fled back as usual to the Dardanelles; yet the only\r\nconsequence was the complete devastation, in revenge, of helpless\r\nKhios. The long-shielded prosperity of the island was remorselessly\r\ndestroyed, the people were either enslaved or massacred, and the\r\nvictorious fleet had to stand by as passively this time as at the\r\ndestruction of Kydhonies the season before. In the following summer,\r\nagain, the same fate befell Trikéri, a maritime community on the Gulf\r\nof Volo which had gained its freedom when the rest of Thessaly stirred\r\nin vain; and so in 1823 the revolution found itself confined on sea, as\r\nwell as on land, to the focus where it had originated in April 1821.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Turkish Aivali.]\r\n\r\nThis isolation was a practical triumph for Sultan Mahmud. The\r\nmaintenance of the Ottoman Empire on the basis of Moslem ascendancy was\r\nthereby assured; but it remained to be seen whether the isolated area\r\ncould now be restored to the _status quo_ in which the rest of his\r\ndominions had been retained.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole season of 1821 the army of Khurshid had been held\r\nbefore Yannina. But in February 1822 Yannina fell, Ali was slain, his\r\ntreasure seized, and his troops disbanded. The Ottoman forces were\r\nliberated for a counterattack on Peloponnesos. Already in April\r\nKhurshid broke up his camp at Lárissa, and his lieutenant Dramali was\r\ngiven command of the new expedition towards the south. He crossed the\r\nSperkheiòs at the beginning of July with an army of twenty thousand\r\nmen.[1] Athens had capitulated to Odhyssèvs ten days before; but it had\r\nkept open the road for Dramali, and north-eastern Greece fell without\r\nresistance into his hands. The citadel of Korinth surrendered as tamely\r\nas the open country, and he was master of the isthmus before the end of\r\nthe month. Nauplia meanwhile had been treating with its besiegers for\r\nterms, and would have surrendered to the Greeks already if they had not\r\ndriven their bargain so hard. Dramali hurried on southward into the\r\nplain to the fortress’s relief, raised the siege, occupied the town of\r\nArgos, and scattered the Greek forces into the hills. But the citadel\r\nof Argos held out against him, and the positions were rapidly reversed.\r\nUnder the experienced direction of Kolokotrónis, the Greeks from their\r\nhill-fastnesses ringed round the plain of Argos and scaled up every\r\nissue. Dramali’s supplies ran out. An attempt of his vanguard to break\r\nthrough again towards the north was bloodily repulsed, and he barely\r\nsucceeded two days later in extricating the main body in a demoralized\r\ncondition, with the loss of all his baggage-train. The Turkish army\r\nmelted away, Dramali was happy to die at Korinth, and Khurshid was\r\nexecuted by the sultan’s command. The invasion of Peloponnesos had\r\nbroken down, and nothing could avert the fall of Nauplia. The Ottoman\r\nfleet hovered for one September week in the offing, but Kanaris’s\r\nfire-ships took another ship of the line in toll at the roadsteads of\r\nTenedos before it safely regained the Dardanelles. The garrison of\r\nNauplia capitulated in December, on condition of personal security and\r\nliberty, and the captain of a British frigate, which arrived on the\r\nspot, took measures that the compact should be observed instead of\r\nbeing broken by the customary massacre. But the strongest fortress in\r\nPeloponnesos was now in Greek hands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Including a strong contingent of Moslem Slavs—Bulgarian\r\nPomaks from the Aegean hinterland and Serbian Bosniaks from the\r\nAdriatic.]\r\n\r\nIn the north-west the season had not passed so well. When the Turks\r\ninvested Ali in Yannina, they repatriated the Suliot exiles in their\r\nnative mountains. But a strong sultan was just as formidable to the\r\nSuliots as a strong pasha, so they swelled their ranks by enfranchising\r\ntheir peasant-serfs, and made common cause with their old enemy in his\r\nadversity. Now that Ali was destroyed, the Suliots found themselves in\r\na precarious position, and turned to the Greeks for aid. But on July 16\r\nthe Greek advance was checked by a severe defeat at Petta in the plain\r\nof Arta. In September the Suliots evacuated their impregnable\r\nfortresses in return for a subsidy and a safe-conduct, and Omer Vrioni,\r\nthe Ottoman commander in the west,[1] was free to advance in turn\r\ntowards the south. On November 6 he actually laid siege to Mesolonghi,\r\nbut here his experiences were as discomfiting as Dramali’s. He could\r\nnot keep open his communications, and after heavy losses retreated\r\nagain to Arta in January 1823.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: He was a renegade officer of Ali’s.]\r\n\r\nIn 1823 the struggle seemed to be lapsing into stalemate. The liberated\r\nPeloponnesos had failed to propagate the revolution through the\r\nremainder of the Ottoman Empire; the Ottoman Government had equally\r\nfailed to reconquer the Peloponnesos by military invasion. This\r\nseason’s operations only seemed to emphasize the deadlock. The Ottoman\r\ncommander in the west raised an auxiliary force of Moslem and Catholic\r\nclansmen from northern Albania, and attempted to reach Mesolonghi once\r\nmore. But he penetrated no further than Anatolikòn—the Mesolonghiots’\r\noutpost village at the head of the lagoons—and the campaign was only\r\nmemorable for the heroic death of Marko Botzaris the Suliot in a night\r\nattack upon the Ottoman camp. At sea, the two fleets indulged in\r\ndesultory cruises without an encounter, for the Turks were still timid\r\nand incompetent, while the growing insubordination and dissension on\r\nthe Greek ships made concerted action there, too, impossible. By the\r\nend of the season it was clear that the struggle could only\r\ndefinitively be decided by the intervention of a third party on one\r\nside or the other—unless the Greeks brought their own ruin upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis indeed was not unlikely to happen; for the new house of Hellenism\r\nhad hardly arisen before it became desperately divided against itself.\r\nThe vitality of the national movement resided entirely in the local\r\ncommunes. It was they that had found the fighting men, kept them armed\r\nand supplied, and by spontaneous co-operation expelled the Turk from\r\nPeloponnesos. But if the co-operation was to be permanent it must have\r\na central organization, and with the erection of this superstructure\r\nthe troubles began. As early as June 1821 a ‘Peloponnesian Senate’ was\r\nconstituted and at once monopolized by the ‘Primates’, the propertied\r\nclass that had been responsible for the communal taxes under the Romaic\r\nand Ottoman régimes and was allowed to control the communal government\r\nin return. About the same time two Phanariot princes threw in their lot\r\nwith the revolution— Alexander Mavrokordatos and Demetrius, the more\r\nestimable brother of the futile Alexander Hypsilantis. Both were\r\nsaturated with the most recent European political theory, and they\r\ncommitted the peasants and seamen of the liberated districts to an\r\nambitious constitutionalism. In December 1821 a ‘National Assembly’ met\r\nat Epidauros, passed an elaborate organic law, and elected\r\nMavrokordatos first president of the Hellenic Republic.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for life and death in 1822 had staved off the internal\r\ncrisis, but the Peloponnesian Senate remained obstinately recalcitrant\r\ntowards the National Government in defence of its own vested interests;\r\nand the insubordination of the fleet in 1823 was of one piece with the\r\npolitical faction which broke out as soon as the immediate danger from\r\nwithout was removed.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1823 European ‘Philhellenes’ began to arrive in\r\nGreece. In those dark days of reaction that followed Waterloo,\r\nself-liberated Hellas seemed the one bright spot on the continent; but\r\nthe idealists who came to offer her their services were confronted with\r\na sorry spectacle. The people were indifferent to their leaders, and\r\nthe leaders at variance among themselves. The gentlemanly Phanariots\r\nhad fallen into the background. Mavrokordatos only retained influence\r\nin north-western Greece. In Peloponnesos the Primates were\r\nall-powerful, and Kolokotrónis the klepht was meditating a popular\r\ndictatorship at their expense. In the north-east the adventurer\r\nOdhyssévs had won a virtual dictatorship already, and was suspected of\r\nintrigue with the Turks; and all this factious dissension rankled into\r\ncivil war as soon as the contraction of a loan in Great Britain had\r\ninvested the political control of the Hellenic Republic with a\r\nprospective value in cash. The first civil war was fought between\r\nKolokotrónis on the one side and the Primates of Hydhra and\r\nPeloponnesos on the other; but the issue was decided against\r\nKolokotrónis by the adhesion to the coalition of Kolettis the Vlach,\r\nonce physician to Mukhtar Pasha, the son of Ali, and now political\r\nagent for all the northern Armatoli in the national service. The\r\nfighting lasted from November 1823 to June 1824, and was followed by\r\nanother outbreak in November of the latter year, when the victors\r\nquarrelled over the spoils, and the Primates were worsted in turn by\r\nthe islanders and the Armatoli. The nonentity Kondouriottis of Hydhra\r\nfinally emerged as President of Greece, with the sharp-witted Kolettis\r\nas his principal wire-puller, but the disturbances did not cease till\r\nthe last instalment of the loan had been received and squandered and\r\nthere was no more spoil to fight for.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sultan Mahmud had been better employed. Resolved to avert\r\nstalemate by the only possible means, he had applied in the course of\r\n1823 to Mohammed Ali Pasha of Egypt, a more formidable, though more\r\ndistant, satrap than Ali of Yannina himself. Mohammed Ali had a\r\nstanding army and navy organized on the European model. He had also a\r\nson Ibrahim, who knew how to manoeuvre them, and was ambitious of a\r\nkingdom. Mahmud hired the father’s troops and the son’s generalship for\r\nthe re-conquest of Peloponnesos, under engagement to invest Ibrahim\r\nwith the pashalik as soon as he should effectively make it his own. By\r\nthis stroke of diplomacy a potential rebel was turned into a willing\r\nally, and the preparations for the Egyptian expedition went forward\r\nbusily through the winter of 1823-4.\r\n\r\nThe plan of campaign was systematically carried out. During the season\r\nof respite the Greek islanders had harried the coasts and commerce of\r\nAnatolia and Syria at will. The first task was to deprive them of their\r\noutposts in the Aegean, and an advanced squadron of the Egyptian fleet\r\naccordingly destroyed the community of Kasos in June 1824, while the\r\nOttoman squadron sallied out of the Dardanelles a month later and dealt\r\nout equal measure to Psarà. The two main flotillas then effected a\r\njunction off Rhodes; and, though the crippled Greek fleet still\r\nventured pluckily to confront them, it could not prevent Ibrahim from\r\ncasting anchor safely in Soudha Bay and landing his army to winter in\r\nKrete. In February 1825 he transferred these troops with equal impunity\r\nto the fortress of Modhon, which was still held for the sultan by an\r\nOttoman garrison. The fire-ships of Hydhra came to harry his fleet too\r\nlate, and on land the Greek forces were impotent against his trained\r\nsoldiers. The Government in vain promoted Kolokotrónis from captivity\r\nto commandership-in-chief. The whole south-western half of Peloponnesos\r\npassed into Ibrahim’s hands, and in June 1825 he even penetrated as far\r\nas the mills of Lerna on the eastern coast, a few miles south of Argos\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Ottoman army of the west moved south again under a\r\nnew commander, Rashid Pasha of Yannina, and laid final siege on April\r\n27 to Mesolonghi, just a year after Byron had died of fever within its\r\nwalls. The Greeks were magnificent in their defence of these frail\r\nmud-bastions, and they more than held their own in the amphibious\r\nwarfare of the lagoons. The struggle was chequered by the continual\r\ncoming and going of the Greek and Ottoman fleets. They were indeed the\r\ndecisive factor; for without the supporting squadron Rashid would have\r\nfound himself in the same straits as his predecessors at the approach\r\nof autumn, while the slackness of the islanders in keeping the sea\r\nallowed Mesolonghi to be isolated in January 1826. The rest was\r\naccomplished by the arrival of Ibrahim on the scene. His heavy\r\nbatteries opened fire in February; his gunboats secured command of the\r\nlagoons, and forced Anatolikòn to capitulate in March. In April\r\nprovisions in Mesolonghi itself gave out, and, scorning surrender, the\r\ngarrison—men, women, and children together— made a general sortie on\r\nthe night of April 22. Four thousand fell, three thousand were taken,\r\nand two thousand won through. It was a glorious end for Mesolonghi, but\r\nit left the enemy in possession of all north-western Greece.\r\n\r\nThe situation was going from bad to worse. Ibrahim returned to\r\nPeloponnesos, and steadily pushed forward his front, ravaging as\r\nsteadily as he went. Rashid, after pacifying the north-west, moved on\r\nto the north-eastern districts, where the national cause had been\r\nshaken by the final treachery and speedy assassination of Odhyssèvs.\r\nSiege was laid to Athens in June, and the Greek Government enlisted in\r\nvain the military experience of its Philhellenes. Fabvier held the\r\nAkropolis, but Generalissimo Sir Richard Church was heavily defeated in\r\nthe spring of 1827 in an attempt to relieve him from the Attic coast;\r\nGrand Admiral Cochrane saw his fleet sail home for want of payment in\r\nadvance, when he summoned it for review at Poros; and Karaiskakis, the\r\nGreek captain of Armatoli, was killed in a skirmish during his more\r\nsuccessful efforts to harass Rashid’s communications by land. On June\r\n5, 1827, the Greek garrison of the Akropolis marched out on terms.\r\n\r\nIt looked as if the Greek effort after independence would be completely\r\ncrushed, and as if Sultan Mahmud would succeed in getting his empire\r\nunder control. In September 1826 he had rid it at last of the mischief\r\nat its centre by blowing up the janissaries in their barracks at\r\nConstantinople. Turkey seemed almost to have weathered the storm when\r\nshe was suddenly overborne by further intervention on the other side.\r\n\r\nTsar Alexander, the vaccillator, died in November 1825, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Nicholas I, as strong a character and as active a\r\nwill as Sultan Mahmud himself. Nicholas approached the Greek question\r\nwithout any disinclination towards a Turkish war; and both Great\r\nBritain and France found an immediate interest in removing a ground of\r\nprovocation which might lead to such a rude disturbance of the European\r\n‘Balance of Power’. On July 6, 1827, a month after Athens surrendered,\r\nthe three powers concluded a treaty for the pacification of Greece, in\r\nwhich they bound over both belligerent parties to accept an armistice\r\nunder pain of military coercion. An allied squadron appeared off\r\nNavarino Bay to enforce this policy upon the Ottoman and Egyptian fleet\r\nwhich lay united there, and the intrusion of the allied admirals into\r\nthe bay itself precipitated on October 20 a violent naval battle in\r\nwhich the Moslem flotilla was destroyed. The die was cast; and in April\r\n1828 the Russian and Ottoman Governments drifted into a formal war,\r\nwhich brought Russian armies across the Danube as far as Adrianople,\r\nand set the Ottoman Empire at bay for the defence of its capital.\r\nThanks to Mahmud’s reorganization, the empire did not succumb to this\r\nassault; but it had no more strength to spare for the subjugation of\r\nGreece. The Greeks had no longer to reckon with the sultan as a\r\nmilitary factor; and in August 1828 they wore relieved of Ibrahim’s\r\npresence as well, by the disembarkation of 14,000 French troops in\r\nPeloponnesos to superintend the withdrawal of the Egyptian forces. In\r\nMarch 1829 the three powers delimited the Greek frontier. The line ran\r\neast and west from the Gulf of Volo to the Gulf of Arta, and assigned\r\nto the new state no more and no less territory than the districts that\r\nhad effectively asserted their independence against the sultan in 1821.\r\nThis settlement was the only one possible under the circumstances; but\r\nit was essentially transitory, for it neglected the natural line of\r\nnationality altogether, and left a numerical majority of the Greek\r\nrace, as well as the most important centres of its life, under the old\r\nrégime of servitude.\r\n\r\nEven the liberated area was not at the end of its troubles. In the\r\nspring of 1827, when they committed themselves into the hands of their\r\nforeign patrons, the Greeks had found a new president for the republic\r\nin John Kapodistrias, an intimate of Alexander the tsar. Kapodistrias\r\nwas a Corfiote count, with a Venetian education and a career in the\r\nRussian diplomatic service, and no one could have been more\r\nfantastically unsuitable for the task of reconstructing the country to\r\nwhich he was called. Kapodistrias’ ideal was the _fin-de-siècle_\r\n‘police-state’; but ‘official circles’ did not exist in Greece, and he\r\nhad no acquaintance with the peasants and sailors whom he hoped to\r\nredeem by bureaucracy. He instituted a hierarchically centralized\r\nadministration which made the abortive constitution of Mavrokordatos\r\nseem sober by comparison; he trampled on the liberty of the rising\r\npress, which was the most hopeful educational influence in the country;\r\nand he created superfluous ministerial portfolios for his untalented\r\nbrothers. In fact he reglamented Greece from his palace at Aigina like\r\na divinely appointed autocrat, from his arrival in January 1828 till\r\nthe summer of 1831, when he provoked the Hydhriots to open rebellion,\r\nand commissioned the Russian squadron in attendance to quell them by a\r\nnaval action, with the result that Poros was sacked by the President’s\r\nregular army and the national fleet was completely destroyed. After\r\nthat, he attempted to rule as a military dictator, and fell foul of the\r\nMavromichalis of Maina. The Mainates knew better how to deal with the\r\n‘police-state’ than the Hydhriots; and on October 9, 1831, Kapodistrias\r\nwas assassinated in Nauplia, at the church door, by two representatives\r\nof the Mavromichalis clan.\r\n\r\nThe country lapsed into utter anarchy. Peloponnesians and Armatoli,\r\nKolokotronists and Kolettists, alternately appointed and deposed\r\nsubservient national assemblies and governing commissions by naked\r\nviolence, which culminated in a gratuitous and disastrous attack upon\r\nthe French troops stationed in Peloponnesos for their common\r\nprotection. The three powers realized that it was idle to liberate\r\nGreece from Ottoman government unless they found her another in its\r\nplace. They decided on monarchy, and offered the crown, in February\r\n1832, to Prince Otto, a younger son of the King of Bavaria. The\r\nnegotiations dragged on many months longer than Greece could afford to\r\nwait. But in July 1832 the sultan recognized the sovereign independence\r\nof the kingdom of Hellas in consideration of a cash indemnity; and in\r\nFebruary 1833, just a year after the first overtures had been made, the\r\nappointed king arrived at Nauplia with a decorative Bavarian staff and\r\na substantial loan from the allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n_The Consolidation of the State_\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf the story of Greece is told. We have watched the nation awake and\r\nput forth its newly-found strength in a great war of independence, and\r\nwe have followed the course of the struggle to its result—the\r\nfoundation of the kingdom of Hellas.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to close this chapter of Greek history without a sense\r\nof disappointment. The spirit of Greece had travailed, and only a\r\nprincipality was born, which gathered within its frontiers scarcely\r\none-third of the race, and turned for its government to a foreign\r\nadministration which had no bond of tradition or affinity with the\r\npopulation it was to rule. And yet something had been achieved. An\r\noasis had been wrested from the Turkish wilderness, in which Hellenism\r\ncould henceforth work out its own salvation untrammelled, and extend\r\nits borders little by little, until it brought within them at last the\r\nwhole of its destined heritage. The fleeting glamour of dawn had\r\npassed, but it had brought the steady light of day, in which the work\r\nbegun could be carried out soberly and indefatigably to its conclusion.\r\nThe new kingdom, in fact, if it fulfilled its mission, might become the\r\npolitical nucleus and the spiritual ensample of a permanently awakened\r\nnation—an ‘education of Hellas’ such as Pericles hoped to see Athens\r\nbecome in the greatest days of Ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we turn to the history of the kingdom, our\r\ndisappointment is all the more intense, for in the first fifty years of\r\nits existence there is little development to record. In 1882 King\r\nOtto’s principality presented much the same melancholy spectacle as it\r\ndid in 1833, when he landed in Nauplia Bay, except that Otto himself\r\nhad left the scene. His Bavarian staff belonged to that reactionary\r\ngeneration that followed the overthrow of Napoleon in Europe, and\r\nattempted, heedless of Kapodistrias’ fiasco, to impose on Greece the\r\nbureaucracy of the _ancien régime_. The Bavarians’ work was entirely\r\ndestructive. The local liberties which had grown up under the Ottoman\r\ndominion and been the very life of the national revival, were\r\neffectively repressed. Hydhriot and Spetziot, Suliot and Mainate,\r\nforfeited their characteristic individuality, but none of the benefits\r\nof orderly and uniform government were realized. The canker of\r\nbrigandage defied all efforts to root it out, and in spite of the loans\r\nwith which the royal government was supplied by the protecting powers,\r\nthe public finance was subject to periodical breakdowns. In 1837 King\r\nOtto, now of age, took the government into his own hands, only to have\r\nit taken out of them again by a revolution in 1843. Thereafter he\r\nreigned as a constitutional monarch, but he never reconciled himself to\r\nthe position, and in 1862 a second revolution drove him into exile, a\r\nscapegoat for the afflictions of his kingdom. Bavarian then gave place\r\nto Dane, yet the afflictions continued. In 1882 King George had been\r\nnineteen years on the throne[1] without any happier fortune than his\r\npredecessor’s. It is true that the frontiers of the kingdom had been\r\nsomewhat extended. Great Britain had presented the new sovereign with\r\nthe Ionian Islands as an inaugural gift, and the Berlin Conference had\r\nrecently added the province of Thessaly. Yet the major part of the\r\nGreek race still awaited liberation from the Turkish yoke, and regarded\r\nthe national kingdom, chronically incapacitated by the twin plagues of\r\nbrigandage and bankruptcy, with increasing disillusionment. The kingdom\r\nof Hellas seemed to have failed in its mission altogether.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: King George, like King Otto, was only seventeen years old\r\nwhen he received his crown.]\r\n\r\nWhat was the explanation of this failure? It was that the very nature\r\nof the mission paralysed the state from taking the steps essential to\r\nits accomplishment. The phenomenon has been, unhappily, only too\r\nfamiliar in the Nearer East, and any one who travelled in the Balkans\r\nin 1882, or even so recently as 1912, must at once have become aware of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nUntil a nation has completely vindicated its right to exist, it is hard\r\nfor it to settle down and make its life worth living. We nations of\r\nwestern Europe (before disaster fell upon us) had learnt to take our\r\nexistence for granted, and ‘Politics’ for us had come to mean an\r\norganized effort to improve the internal economy of our community. But\r\na foreigner who picked up a Greek newspaper would have found in it none\r\nof the matter with which he was familiar in his own, no discussion of\r\nfinancial policy, economic development, or social reconstruction. The\r\nnews-columns would have been monopolized by foreign politics, and in\r\nthe cafes he would have heard the latest oscillation in the\r\ninternational balance of power canvassed with the same intense and\r\nminute interest that Englishmen in a railway-carriage would have been\r\ndevoting to Old Age Pensions, National Health Insurance, or Land\r\nValuation. He would have been amazed by a display of intimate knowledge\r\nsuch as no British quidnunc could have mustered if he had happened to\r\nstumble across these intricacies of international competition, and the\r\nconversation would always have terminated in the same unanswered but\r\ninconscionable challenge to the future: ‘When will the oppressed\r\nmajority of our race escape the Turkish yoke? If the Ottoman dominion\r\nis destroyed, what redistribution of its provinces will follow? Shall\r\nwe then achieve our national unity, or will our Balkan neighbours\r\nencroach upon the inheritance which is justly ours?’\r\n\r\nThis preoccupation with events beyond the frontiers was not caused by\r\nany lack of vital problems within them. The army was the most\r\nconspicuous object of public activity, but it was not an aggressive\r\nspeculation, or an investment of national profits deliberately\r\ncalculated to bring in one day a larger return. It was a necessity of\r\nlife, and its efficiency was barely maintained out of the national\r\npoverty. In fact, it was almost the only public utility with which the\r\nnation could afford to provide itself, and the traveller from Great\r\nBritain would have been amazed again at the miserable state of all\r\nreproductive public works. The railways were few and far between, their\r\nroutes roundabout, and their rolling-stock scanty, so that trains were\r\nboth rare and slow. Wheel-roads were no commoner a feature in Greece\r\nthan railways are here, and such stretches as had been constructed had\r\noften never come into use, because they had just failed to reach their\r\ngoal or were still waiting for their bridges, so that they were simply\r\nfalling into decay and converting the outlay of capital upon them into\r\na dead loss. The Peiraeus was the only port in the country where\r\nsteamers could come alongside a quay, and discharge their cargoes\r\ndirectly on shore. Elsewhere, the vessel must anchor many cables’\r\nlengths out, and depend on the slow and expensive services of lighters,\r\nfor lack of pier construction and dredging operations. For example,\r\nKalamata, the economic outlet for the richest part of Peloponnesos, and\r\nthe fifth largest port in the kingdom,[1] was and still remains a mere\r\nopen roadstead, where all ships that call are kept at a distance by the\r\nsilt from a mountain torrent, and so placed in imminent danger of being\r\ndriven, by the first storm, upon the rocks of a neighbouring peninsula.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The four chief ports being Peiraeus, Patras, Syra, and\r\nVolos.]\r\n\r\nThese grave shortcomings were doubtless due in part to the geographical\r\ncharacter of the country, though it was clear, from what had actually\r\nbeen accomplished, that it would have been both possible and profitable\r\nto attempt much more, if the nation’s energy could have been secured\r\nfor the work. But it is hard to tinker at details when you are kept in\r\na perpetual fever by a question of life and death, and the great\r\npreliminary questions of national unity and self-government remained\r\nstill unsettled.\r\n\r\nBefore these supreme problems all other interests paled, for they were\r\nno will-o’-the-wisps of theoretical politics. It needs a long political\r\neducation to appreciate abstract ideas, and the Greeks were still in\r\ntheir political infancy, but the realization of Greater Greece implied\r\nfor them the satisfaction of all their concrete needs at once.\r\n\r\nSo long as the _status quo_ endured, they were isolated from the rest\r\nof Europe by an unbroken band of Turkish territory, stretching from the\r\nAegean to the Adriatic Sea. What was the use of overcoming great\r\nengineering difficulties to build a line of European gauge from Athens\r\nright up to the northern frontier, if Turkey refused to sanction the\r\nconstruction of the tiny section that must pass through her territory\r\nbetween the Greek railhead and the actual terminus of the European\r\nsystem at Salonika? Or if, even supposing she withdrew her veto, she\r\nwould have it in her power to bring pressure on Greece at any moment by\r\nthreatening to sever communications along this vital artery? So long as\r\nTurkey was there, Greece was practically an island, and her only\r\ncommunication with continental Europe lay through her ports. But what\r\nuse to improve the ports, when the recovery of Salonika, the fairest\r\nobject of the national dreams, would ultimately change the country’s\r\neconomic centre of gravity, and make her maritime as well as her\r\noverland commerce flow along quite other channels than the present?\r\n\r\nThus the Greek nation’s present was overshadowed by its future, and its\r\nactions paralysed by its hopes. Perhaps a nation with more power of\r\napplication and less of imagination would have schooled itself to the\r\nthought that these sordid, obtrusive details were the key to the\r\nsplendours of the future, and would have devoted itself to the\r\nsystematic amelioration of the cramped area which it had already\r\nsecured for its own. This is what Bulgaria managed to do during her\r\nshort but wonderful period of internal growth between the Berlin Treaty\r\nof 1878 and the declaration of war against Turkey in 1912. But\r\nBulgaria, thanks to her geographical situation, was from the outset\r\nfreer from the tentacles of the Turkish octopus than Greece had\r\ncontrived to make herself by her fifty years’ start, while her\r\ntemperamentally sober ambitions were not inflamed by such past\r\ntraditions as Greece had inherited, not altogether to her advantage. Be\r\nthat as it may, Greece, whether by fault or misfortune, had failed\r\nduring this half-century to apply herself successfully to the cure of\r\nher defects and the exploitation of her assets, though she did not lack\r\nleaders strong-minded enough to summon her to the dull business of the\r\npresent. Her history during the succeeding generation was a struggle\r\nbetween the parties of the Present and the Future, and the unceasing\r\ndiscomfiture of the former is typified in the tragedy of Trikoupis, the\r\ngreatest modern Greek statesman before the advent of Venezelos.\r\n\r\nTrikoupis came into power in 1882, just after the acquisition of the\r\nrich agricultural province of Thessaly under the Treaty of Berlin had\r\ngiven the kingdom a fresh start. There were no such continuous areas of\r\ngood arable land within the original frontiers, and such rare patches\r\nas there were had been desolated by those eight years of savage\r\nwarfare[1] which had been the price of liberty. The population had been\r\nswept away by wholesale massacres of racial minorities in every\r\ndistrict; the dearth of industrious hands had allowed the torrents to\r\nplay havoc with the cultivation-terraces on the mountain slopes; and\r\nthe spectre of malaria, always lying in wait for its opportunity, had\r\nclaimed the waterlogged plains for its own. During the fifty years of\r\nstagnation little attempt had been made to cope with the evil, until\r\nnow it seemed almost past remedy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1821-28]\r\n\r\nIf, however, the surface of the land offered little prospect of wealth\r\nfor the moment, there were considerable treasures to be found beneath\r\nit. A metalliferous bolt runs down the whole east coast of the Greek\r\nmainland, cropping up again in many of the Aegean islands, and some of\r\nthe ores, of which there is a great variety, are rare and valuable. The\r\nlack of transit facilities is partly remedied by the fact that workable\r\nveins often lie near enough to the sea for the produce to be carried\r\nstraight from mine to ship, by an endless-chain system of overhead\r\ntrolleys; so that, once capital is secured for installing the plant and\r\nopening the mine, profitable operations can be carried on irrespective\r\nof the general economic condition of the country. Trikoupis saw how\r\nmuch potential wealth was locked up in these mineral seams. The problem\r\nwas how to attract the capital necessary to tap it. The nucleus round\r\nwhich have accumulated those immense masses of mobilised capital that\r\nare the life-blood of modern European industry and commerce, was\r\noriginally derived from the surplus profits of agriculture. But a\r\ncountry that finds itself reduced, like Greece in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, to a state of agricultural bankruptcy, has obviously failed to\r\nsave any surplus in the process, so that it is unable to provide from\r\nits own pocket the minimum outlay it so urgently needs in order to open\r\nfor itself some new activity. If it is to obtain a fresh start on other\r\nlines, it must secure the co-operation of the foreign investor, and the\r\ncapitalist with a ready market for his money will only put it into\r\nenterprises where he has some guarantee of its safety. There was little\r\ndoubt that the minerals of Greece would well repay extraction; the\r\nuncertain element was the Greek nation itself. The burning question of\r\nnational unity might break out at any moment into a blaze of war, and,\r\nin the probable case of disaster, involve the whole country and all\r\ninterests connected with it in economic as well as political ruin.\r\nWestern Europe would not commit itself to Greek mining enterprise,\r\nunless it felt confident that the statesman responsible for the\r\ngovernment of Greece would and could restrain his country from its\r\ninstinctive impulse towards political adventure.\r\n\r\nThe great merit of Trikoupis was that he managed to inspire this\r\nconfidence. Greece owes most of the wheelroads, railways, and mines of\r\nwhich she can now boast to the dozen years of his more or less\r\nconsecutive administration. But the roads are unfinished, the\r\nrailway-network incomplete, the mines exploited only to a fraction of\r\ntheir capacity, because the forces against Trikoupis were in the end\r\ntoo strong for him. It may be that his eye too rigidly followed the\r\nforeign investor’s point of view, and that by adopting a more\r\nconciliatory attitude towards the national ideal, he might have\r\nstrengthened his position at home without impairing his reputation\r\nabroad; but his position was really made impossible by a force quite\r\nbeyond his control, the irresponsible and often intolerable behaviour\r\nwhich Turkey, under whatever régime, has always practised towards\r\nforeign powers, and especially towards those Balkan states which have\r\nwon their freedom in her despite, while perforce abandoning a large\r\nproportion of their race to the protracted outrage of Turkish\r\nmisgovernment.\r\n\r\nSeveral times over the Porte, by wanton insults to Greece, wrecked the\r\nefforts of Trikoupis to establish good relations between the two\r\ngovernments, and played the game of the chauvinist party led by\r\nTrikoupis’ rival, Deliyannis. Deliyannis’ tenures of office were always\r\nbrief, but during them he contrived to undo most of the work\r\naccomplished by Trikoupis in the previous intervals. A particularly\r\ntense ‘incident’ with Turkey put him in power in 1893, with a strong\r\nenough backing from the country to warrant a general mobilization. The\r\nsole result was the ruin of Greek credit. Trikoupis was hastily\r\nrecalled to office by the king, but too late. He found himself unable\r\nto retrieve the ruin, and retired altogether from politics in 1895,\r\ndying abroad next year in voluntary exile and enforced disillusionment.\r\n\r\nWith the removal of Trikoupis from the helm, Greece ran straight upon\r\nthe rocks. A disastrous war with Turkey was precipitated in 1897 by\r\nevents in Krete. It brought the immediate _débâcle_ of the army and the\r\nreoccupation of Thessaly for a year by Turkish troops, while its final\r\npenalties were the cession of the chief strategical positions along the\r\nnorthern frontier and the imposition of an international commission of\r\ncontrol over the Greek finances, in view of the complete national\r\nbankruptcy entailed by the war. The fifteen years that followed 1895\r\nwere almost the blackest period in modern Greek history; yet the time\r\nwas not altogether lost, and such events as the draining of the\r\nKopais-basin by a British company, and its conversion from a malarious\r\nswamp into a rich agricultural area, marked a perceptible economic\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThis comparative stagnation was broken at last by the Young Turk\r\n_pronunciamiento_ at Salonika in 1908, which produced such momentous\r\nrepercussions all through the Nearer East. The Young Turks had struck\r\nin order to forestall the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, but the\r\nopportunity was seized by every restive element within it to extricate\r\nitself, if possible, from the Turkish coils. Now, just as in 1897,\r\nGreece was directly affected by the action of the Greek population in\r\nKrete. As a result of the revolt of 1896-7, Krete had been constituted\r\nan autonomous state subject to Ottoman suzerainty, autonomy and\r\nsuzerainty alike being guaranteed by four great powers. Prince George\r\nof Greece, a son of the King of the Hellenes, had been placed at the\r\nhead of the autonomous government as high commissioner; but his\r\nautocratic tendency caused great discontent among the free-spirited\r\nKretans, who had not rid themselves of the Turkish régime in order to\r\nforfeit their independence again in another fashion. Dissension\r\nculminated in 1906, when the leaders of the opposition took to the\r\nmountains, and obtained such support and success in the guerrilla\r\nfighting that followed, that they forced Prince George to tender his\r\nresignation. He was succeeded as high commissioner by Zaimis, another\r\ncitizen of the Greek kingdom, who inaugurated a more constitutional\r\nrégime, and in 1908 the Kretans believed that the moment for realizing\r\nthe national ideal had come. They proclaimed their union with Greece,\r\nand elected deputies to the Parliament at Athens. But the guarantor\r\npowers carried out their obligations by promptly sending a combined\r\nnaval expedition, which hauled down the Greek flag at Canea, and\r\nprevented the deputies from embarking for Peiraeus. This apparently\r\npedantic insistence upon the _status quo_ was extremely exasperating to\r\nGreek nationalism. It produced a ferment in the kingdom, which grew\r\nsteadily for nine months, and vented itself in July 1909 in the _coup\r\nd’état_ of the ‘Military League’, a second-hand imitation of the\r\nTurkish ‘Committee of Union and Progress’. The royal family was\r\ncavalierly treated, and constitutional government superseded by a junta\r\nof officers. But at this point the policy of the four powers towards\r\nKrete was justified. Turkey knew well that she had lost Krete in 1897,\r\nbut she could still exploit her suzerainty to prevent Greece from\r\ngaining new strength by the annexation of the island. The Young Turks\r\nhad seized the reins of government, not to modify the policy of the\r\nPorte, but to intensify its chauvinism, and they accordingly intimated\r\nthat they would consider any violation of their suzerain rights over\r\nKrete a _casus belli_ against Greece. Greece, without army or allies,\r\nwas obviously not in a position to incur another war, and the ‘Military\r\nLeague’ thus found that it had reached the end of its tether. There\r\nensued a deadlock of another eight months, only enlivened by a naval\r\nmutiny, during which the country lay paralysed, with no programme\r\nwhatsoever before it.\r\n\r\nThen the man demanded by the situation appeared unexpectedly from the\r\ncentre of disturbance, Krete. Venezelos started life as a successful\r\nadvocate at Canea. He entered Kretan politics in the struggle for\r\nconstitutionalism, and distinguished himself in the successful\r\nrevolution of 1906, of which he was the soul. Naturally, he became one\r\nof the leading statesmen under Zaimis’ régime, and he further\r\ndistinguished himself by resolutely opposing the ‘Unionist’ agitation\r\nas premature, and yet retaining his hold over a people whose paramount\r\npolitical preoccupation was their national unity. The crisis of 1908-9\r\nbrought him into close relations with the government of the Greek\r\nkingdom; and the king, who had gauged his calibre, now took the\r\npatriotic step of calling in the man who had expelled his son from\r\nKrete, to put his own house in order. It speaks much for both men that\r\nthey worked together in harmony from the beginning. Upon the royal\r\ninvitation Venezelos exchanged Kretan for Greek citizenship, and took\r\nin hand the ‘Military League’. After short negotiations, he persuaded\r\nit to dissolve in favour of a national convention, which was able to\r\nmeet in March 1910.\r\n\r\nThus Greece became a constitutional country once more, and Venezelos\r\nthe first premier of the new era. During five years of continuous\r\noffice he was to prove himself the good genius of his country. When he\r\nresigned his post in April 1915, he left the work of consolidating the\r\nnational state on the verge of completion, and it will be his country’s\r\nloss if he is baulked of achievement. Results speak for themselves, and\r\nthe remainder of this pamphlet will be little more than a record of his\r\nstatesmanship; but before we pass on to review his deeds, we must say a\r\nword about the character to which they are due. In March 1912 the time\r\ncame for the first general election since Venezelos had taken office.\r\nTwo years’ experience of his administration had already won him such\r\npopularity and prestige, that the old party groups, purely personal\r\nfollowings infected with all the corruption, jingoism, and insincerity\r\nof the dark fifteen years, leagued themselves in a desperate effort to\r\ncast him out. Corruption on a grand scale was attempted, but Venezelos’\r\nsuccess at the polls was sweeping. The writer happened to be spending\r\nthat month in Krete. The Kretans had, of course, elected deputies in\r\ngood time to the parliament at Athens, and once more the foreign\r\nwarships stopped them in the act of boarding the steamer for Peiraeus,\r\nwhile Venezelos, who was still responsible for the Greek Government\r\ntill the new parliament met, had declared with characteristic frankness\r\nthat the attendance of the Kretan deputies could not possibly be\r\nsanctioned, an opening of which his opponents did not fail to take\r\nadvantage. Meanwhile, every one in Krete was awaiting news of the\r\npolling in the kingdom. They might have been expected to feel, at any\r\nrate, lukewarmly towards a man who had actually taken office on the\r\nprogramme of deferring their cherished ‘union’ indefinitely; but, on\r\nthe contrary, they greeted his triumph with enormous enthusiasm. Their\r\nfeeling was explained by the comment of an innkeeper. ‘Venezelos!’ he\r\nsaid: ‘Why, he is a man who can say “No”. He won’t stand any nonsense.\r\nIf you try to get round him, he’ll put you in irons.’ And clearly he\r\nhad hit the mark. Venezelos would in any case have done well, because\r\nhe is a clever man with an excellent power of judgement; but acuteness\r\nis a common Greek virtue, and if he has done brilliantly, it is because\r\nhe has the added touch of genius required to make the Greek take ‘No’\r\nfor an answer, a quality, very rare indeed in the nation, which\r\nexplains the dramatic contrast between his success and Trikoupis’\r\nfailure. Greece has been fortunate indeed in finding the right man at\r\nthe crucial hour.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1911-12 and the succeeding summer, the foreign\r\ntraveller met innumerable results of Venezelos’ activity in every part\r\nof the country, and all gave evidence of the same thing: a sane\r\njudgement and its inflexible execution. For instance, a resident in\r\nGreece had needed an escort of soldiers four years before, when he made\r\nan expedition into the wild country north-west of the Gulf of Patras,\r\non account of the number of criminals ‘wanted’ by the government who\r\nwere lurking in that region as outlaws. In August 1912 an inquiry\r\nconcerning this danger was met with a smile: ‘Oh, yes, it was so,’ said\r\nthe gendarme, ‘but since then Venezelos has come. He amnestied every\r\none “out” for minor offences, and then caught the “really bad ones”, so\r\nthere are no outlaws in Akarnania now.’ And he spoke the truth. You\r\ncould wander all about the forests and mountains without molestation.\r\n\r\nSo far Venezelos had devoted himself to internal reconstruction, after\r\nthe precedent of Trikoupis, but he was not the man to desert the\r\nnational idea. The army and navy were reorganized by French and British\r\nmissions, and when the opportunity appeared, he was ready to take full\r\nadvantage of it. In the autumn of 1912, Turkey had been for a year at\r\nwar with Italy; her finances had suffered a heavy drain, and the\r\nItalian command of the sea not only locked up her best troops in\r\nTripoli, but interrupted such important lines of communication between\r\nher Asiatic and European provinces as the direct route by sea from\r\nSmyrna to Salonika, and the devious sea-passage thence round Greece to\r\nScutari, which was the only alternative for Turkish troops to running\r\nthe gauntlet of the Albanian mountaineers. Clearly the Balkan nations\r\ncould find no better moment for striking the blow to settle that\r\nimplacable ‘preliminary question.’ of national unity which had dogged\r\nthem all since their birth. Their only chance of success, however, was\r\nto strike in concert, for Turkey, handicapped though she was, could\r\nstill easily outmatch them singly. Unless they could compromise between\r\ntheir conflicting claims, they would have to let this common\r\nopportunity for making them good slip by altogether.\r\n\r\nOf the four states concerned, two, Serbia and Montenegro, were of the\r\nsame South-Slavonic nationality, and had been drawn into complete\r\naccord with each other since the formal annexation of Bosnia by\r\nAustria-Hungary in 1908, which struck a hard blow at their common\r\nnational idea, while neither of them had any conflicting claims with\r\nGreece, since the Greek and South-Slavonic nationalities are at no\r\npoint geographically in contact. With Bulgaria, a nation of Slavonic\r\nspeech and culture, though not wholly Slavonic in origin, Serbia had\r\nquarrelled for years over the ultimate destiny of the Üsküb district in\r\nnorth-western Macedonia, which was still subject to Turkey; but in the\r\nsummer of 1912 the two states compromised in a secret treaty upon their\r\nrespective territorial ambitions, and agreed to refer the fate of one\r\ndebatable strip to the arbitration of Russia, after their already\r\nprojected war with Turkey had been carried through. There was a more\r\nformidable conflict of interests between Bulgaria and Greece. These two\r\nnationalities are conterminous over a very wide extent of territory,\r\nstretching from the Black Sea on the east to the inland Lake of Okhrida\r\non the west, and there is at no point a sharp dividing line between\r\nthem. The Greek element tends to predominate towards the coast and the\r\nBulgar towards the interior, but there are broad zones where Greek and\r\nBulgar villages are inextricably interspersed, while purely Greek towns\r\nare often isolated in the midst of purely Bulgar rural districts. Even\r\nif the racial areas could be plotted out on a large-scale map, it was\r\nclear that no political frontier could be drawn to follow their\r\nconvolutions, and that Greece and Bulgaria could only divide the spoils\r\nby both making up their minds to give and take. The actual lines this\r\nnecessary compromise would follow, obviously depended on the degree of\r\nthe allies’ success against Turkey in the common war that was yet to be\r\nfought, and Venezelos rose to the occasion. He had the courage to offer\r\nBulgaria the Greek alliance without stipulating for any definite\r\nminimum share in the common conquests, and the tact to induce her to\r\naccept it on the same terms. Greece and Bulgaria agreed to shelve all\r\nterritorial questions till the war had been brought to a successful\r\nclose; and with the negotiation of this understanding (another case in\r\nwhich Venezelos achieved what Trikoupis had attempted only to fail) the\r\nBalkan League was complete.\r\n\r\nThe events that followed are common knowledge. The Balkan allies opened\r\nthe campaign in October, and the Turks collapsed before an impetuous\r\nattack. The Bulgarians crumpled up the Ottoman field armies in Thrace\r\nat the terrific battle of Lule Burgas; the Serbians disposed of the\r\nforces in the Macedonian interior, while the Greeks effected a junction\r\nwith the Serbians from the south, and cut their way through to\r\nSalonika. Within two months of the declaration of war, the Turks on\r\nland had been driven out of the open altogether behind the shelter of\r\nthe Chataldja and Gallipoli lines, and only three\r\nfortresses—Adrianople, Yannina, and Scutari—held out further to the\r\nwest. Their navy, closely blockaded by the Greek fleet within the\r\nDardanelles, had to look on passively at the successive occupation of\r\nthe Aegean Islands by Greek landing-parties. With the winter came\r\nnegotiations, during which an armistice reigned at Adrianople and\r\nScutari, while the Greeks pursued the siege of Yannina and the\r\nDardanelles blockade. The negotiations proved abortive, and the result\r\nof the renewed hostilities justified the action of the Balkan\r\nplenipotentiaries in breaking them off. By the spring of 1913 the three\r\nfortresses had fallen, and, under the treaty finally signed at London,\r\nTurkey ceded to the Balkan League, as a whole, all her European\r\nterritories west of a line drawn from Ainos on the Aegean to Midía on\r\nthe Black Sea, including Adrianople and the lower basin of the river\r\nMaritsa.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come for Greece and Bulgaria to settle their account,\r\nand the unexpected extent of the common gains ought to have facilitated\r\ntheir division. The territory in question included the whole north\r\ncoast of the Aegean and its immediate hinterland, and Venezelos\r\nproposed to consider it in two sections. (1) The eastern section,\r\nconveniently known as Thrace, consisted of the lower basin of the\r\nMaritsa. As far as Adrianople the population was Bulgar, but south of\r\nthat city it was succeeded by a Greek element, with a considerable\r\nsprinkling of Turkish settlements, as far as the sea. Geographically,\r\nhowever, the whole district is intimately connected with Bulgaria, and\r\nthe railway that follows the course of the Maritsa down to the port of\r\nDedeagatch offers a much-needed economic outlet for large regions\r\nalready within the Bulgarian frontier. Venezelos, then, was prepared to\r\nresign all Greek claims to the eastern section, in return for a\r\ncorresponding concession by Bulgaria in the west. (2) The western\r\nsection, consisting of the lower basins of the Vardar and Struma, lay\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of the former frontier of Greece; but\r\nthe Greek population of Salonika,[1] and the coast-districts east of\r\nit, could not be brought within the Greek frontier without including as\r\nwell a certain hinterland inhabited mainly by Bulgarians. The cession\r\nof this was the return asked for by Venezelos, and he reduced it to a\r\nminimum by abstaining from pressing the quite well-founded claims of\r\nGreece in the Monastir district, which lay further inland still.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The predominant element within the walls of Salonika\r\nitself is neither Greek nor Bulgarian, but consists of about 80,000 of\r\nthose Spanish-speaking Jews who settled in Turkey as refugees during\r\nthe sixteenth century.]\r\n\r\nBut Venezelos’ conciliatory proposals met with no response from the\r\nBulgarian Government, which was in an ‘all or nothing’ mood. It\r\nswallowed Venezelos’ gift of Thrace, and then proceeded to exploit the\r\nBulgar hinterland of Salonika as a pretext for demanding the latter\r\ncity as well. This uncompromising attitude made agreement impossible,\r\nand it was aggravated by the aggressive action of the Bulgarian troops\r\nin the occupied territory, who persistently endeavoured to steal ground\r\nfrom the Greek forces facing them. In May there was serious fighting to\r\nthe east of the Struma, and peace was only restored with difficulty.\r\nBulgarian relations with Serbia were becoming strained at the same\r\ntime, though in this case Bulgaria had more justice on her side. Serbia\r\nmaintained that the veto imposed by Austria upon her expansion to the\r\nAdriatic, in coincidence with Bulgaria’s unexpected gains on the\r\nMaritsa to which Serbian arms had contributed, invalidated the secret\r\ntreaty of the previous summer, and she announced her intention of\r\nretaining the Monastir district and the line of the Salonika railway as\r\nfar as the future frontier of Greece. Bulgaria, on the other hand, shut\r\nher eyes to Serbia’s necessity for an untrammelled economic outlet to\r\none sea-board or the other, and took her stand on her strictly legal\r\ntreaty-rights. However the balance of justice inclined, a lasting\r\nsettlement could only have been reached by mutual forbearance and\r\ngoodwill; but Bulgaria put herself hopelessly in the wrong towards both\r\nher allies by a treacherous night-attack upon them all along the line,\r\nat the end of June 1913. This disastrous act was the work of a single\r\npolitical party, which has since been condemned by most sections of\r\nBulgarian public opinion; but the punishment, if not the responsibility\r\nfor the crime, fell upon the whole nation. Greece and Serbia had\r\nalready been drawn into an understanding by their common danger. They\r\nnow declared war against Bulgaria in concert. The counter-strokes of\r\ntheir armies met with success, and the intervention of Rumania made\r\nBulgaria’s discomfiture certain.\r\n\r\nThe results of the one month’s war were registered in the Treaty of\r\nBucarest. Many of its provisions were unhappily, though naturally,\r\ninspired by the spirit of revenge; but the Greek premier, at any rate,\r\nshowed a statesmanlike self-restraint in the negotiations. Venezelos\r\nadvocated the course of taking no more after the war than had been\r\ndemanded before it. He desired to leave Bulgaria a broad zone of Aegean\r\nlittoral between the Struma and Maritsa rivers, including ports capable\r\nof satisfying Bulgaria’s pressing need for an outlet towards the south.\r\nBut, in the exasperated state of public feeling, even Venezelos’\r\nprestige failed to carry through his policy in its full moderation.\r\nKing George had just been assassinated in his year of jubilee, in the\r\nstreets of the long-desired Salonika; and King Constantine, his son,\r\nflushed by the victory of Kilkish and encouraged by the Machiavellian\r\ndiplomacy of his Hohenzollern brother-in-law, insisted on carrying the\r\nnew Greek frontier as far east as the river Mesta, and depriving\r\nBulgaria of Kavala, the natural harbour for the whole Bulgarian\r\nhinterland in the upper basins of the Mesta and Struma.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Greece did not exact as much as she might have done.\r\nBulgaria was still allowed to possess herself of a coastal strip east\r\nof the Mesta, containing the tolerable harbours of Porto Lagos and\r\nDedeagatch, which had been occupied during hostilities by the Greek\r\nfleet, and thus her need for an Aegean outlet was not left unsatisfied\r\naltogether; while Greece on her part was cleverly shielded for the\r\nfuture from those drawbacks involved in immediate contact with Turkish\r\nterritory, which she had so often experienced in the past. It is also\r\ntrue that the Kavala district is of great economic value in itself—it\r\nproduces the better part of the Turkish Régie tobacco crop—and that on\r\ngrounds of nationality alone Bulgaria has no claim to this prize, since\r\nthe tobacco-growing peasantry is almost exclusively Greek or Turk,\r\nwhile the Greek element has been extensively reinforced during the last\r\ntwo years by refugees from Anatolia and Thrace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is already clear that Venezelos’ judgement was the\r\nbetter. The settlement at the close of the present war may even yet\r\nbring Bulgaria reparation in many quarters. If the Ruman and South\r\nSlavonic populations at present included in the complexus of\r\nAustria-Hungary are freed from their imprisonment and united with the\r\nSerbian and Rumanian national states, Bulgaria may conceivably recover\r\nfrom the latter those Bulgarian lands which the Treaty of Bucarest made\r\nover to them in central Macedonia and the Dobrudja, while it would be\r\nstill more feasible to oust the Turk again from Adrianople, where he\r\nslipped back in the hour of Bulgaria’s prostration and has succeeded in\r\nmaintaining himself ever since. Yet no amount of compensation in other\r\ndirections and no abstract consideration for the national principle\r\nwill induce Bulgaria to renounce her claim on Greek Kavala. Access to\r\nthis district is vital to Bulgaria from the geographical point of view,\r\nand she will not be satisfied here with such rights as Serbia enjoys at\r\nSalonika—free use of the port and free traffic along a railway\r\nconnecting it with her own hinterland. Her heart is set on complete\r\nterritorial ownership, and she will not compose her feud with Greece\r\nuntil she has had her way.\r\n\r\nSo long, therefore, as the question of Kavala remains unsettled, Greece\r\nwill not be able to put the preliminary problem of ‘national\r\nconsolidation’ behind her, and enter upon the long-deferred chapter of\r\n‘internal development’. To accomplish once for all this vital\r\ntransition, Venezelos is taking the helm again into his hands, and it\r\nis his evident intention to close the Greek account with Bulgaria just\r\nas Serbia and Rumania hope to close theirs with the same state—by a\r\nbold territorial concession conditional upon adequate territorial\r\ncompensation elsewhere.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The above paragraph betrays its own date; for, since it\r\nwas written, the intervention of Bulgaria on the side of the Central\r\nPowers has deferred indefinitely the hope of a settlement based upon\r\nmutual agreement.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of such compensation is offered by certain outstanding\r\nproblems directly dependent upon the issue of the European conflict,\r\nand we must glance briefly at these before passing on to consider the\r\nnew chapter of internal history that is opening for the Greek nation.\r\n\r\nThe problems in question are principally concerned with the ownership\r\nof islands.\r\n\r\nThe integrity of a land-frontier is guaranteed by the whole strength of\r\nthe nation included within it, and can only be modified by a struggle\r\nfor existence with the neighbor on whom it borders; but islands by\r\ntheir geographical nature constitute independent political units,\r\neasily detached from or incorporated with larger domains, according to\r\nthe momentary fluctuation in the balance of sea-power. Thus it happened\r\nthat the arrival of the _Goeben_ and _Breslau_ at the Dardanelles in\r\nAugust 1914 led Turkey to reopen promptly certain questions concerning\r\nthe Aegean. The islands in this sea are uniformly Greek in population,\r\nbut their respective geographical positions and political fortunes\r\ndifferentiate them into several groups.\r\n\r\n1. The Cyclades in the south-west, half submerged vanguards of mountain\r\nranges in continental Greece, have formed part of the modern kingdom\r\nfrom its birth, and their status has never since been called into\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n2. Krete, the largest of all Greek islands, has been dealt with\r\nalready. She enjoyed autonomy under Turkish suzerainty for fifteen\r\nyears before the Balkan War, and at its outbreak she once more\r\nproclaimed her union with Greece. This time at last her action was\r\nlegalized, when Turkey expressly abandoned her suzerain rights by a\r\nclause in the Treaty of London.\r\n\r\n3. During the war itself, the Greek navy occupied a number of islands\r\nwhich had remained till then under the more direct government of\r\nTurkey, The parties to the Treaty of London agreed to leave their\r\ndestiny to the decision of the powers, and the latter assigned them all\r\nto Greece, with the exception of Imbros and Tenedos which command\r\nstrategically the mouth of the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nThe islands thus secured to Greece fall in turn into several\r\nsub-groups.\r\n\r\nTwo of these are _(a)_ Thasos, Samothraki, and Lemnos, off the European\r\ncoast, and _(b)_ Samos and its satellite Nikarià, immediately off the\r\nwest coast of Anatolia; and these five islands seem definitely to have\r\nbeen given up by Turkey for lost. The European group is well beyond the\r\nrange of her present frontiers; while Samos, though it adjoins the\r\nTurkish mainland, does not mask the outlet from any considerable port,\r\nand had moreover for many years possessed the same privileged autonomy\r\nas Krete, so that the Ottoman Government did not acutely feel its final\r\nseverance.\r\n\r\n_(c)_ A third group consists of Mitylini and Khios,[1] and concerning\r\nthis pair Greece and Turkey have so far come to no understanding. The\r\nTurks pointed out that the littoral off which these islands lie\r\ncontains not only the most indispensable ports of Anatolia but also the\r\nlargest enclaves of Greek population on the Asiatic mainland, and they\r\ndeclared that the occupation of this group by Greece menaced the\r\nsovereignty of the Porte in its home territory. ‘See’, they said, ‘how\r\nthe two islands flank both sides of the sea-passage to Smyrna, the\r\nterminus of all the railways which penetrate the Anatolian interior,\r\nwhile Mitylini barricades Aivali and Edremid as well. As soon as the\r\nGreek Government has converted the harbours of these islands into naval\r\nbases, Anatolia will be subject to a perpetual Greek blockade, and this\r\nviolent intimidation of the Turkish people will be reinforced by an\r\ninsidious propaganda among the disloyal Greek elements in our midst.’\r\nAccordingly the Turks refused to recognize the award of the powers, and\r\ndemanded the re-establishment of Ottoman sovereignty in Mitylini and\r\nKhios, under guarantee of an autonomy after the precedent of Krete and\r\nSamos.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Including its famous satellite Psarà.]\r\n\r\nTo these arguments and demands the Greeks replied that, next to Krete;\r\nthese are the two largest, most wealthy, and most populous Greek\r\nislands in the Aegean; that their inhabitants ardently desire union\r\nwith the national kingdom; and that the Greek Government would hesitate\r\nto use them as a basis for economic coercion and nationalistic\r\npropaganda against Turkey, if only because the commerce of western\r\nAnatolia is almost exclusively in the hands of the Greek element on the\r\nAsiatic continent. Greek interests were presumably bound up with the\r\neconomic prosperity and political consolidation of Turkey in Asia, and\r\nthe Anatolian Greeks would merely have been alienated from their\r\ncompatriots by any such impolitic machinations. ‘Greek sovereignty in\r\nMitylini and Khios’, the Greeks maintained, ‘does not threaten Turkish\r\nsovereignty on the Continent. But the restoration of Turkish suzerainty\r\nover the islands would most seriously endanger the liberty of their\r\ninhabitants; for Turkish promises are notoriously valueless, except\r\nwhen they are endorsed by the guarantee of some physically stronger\r\npower.’\r\n\r\nNegotiations were conducted between Greece and Turkey from these\r\nrespective points of view without leading to any result, and the two\r\nstandpoints were in fact irreconcilable, since either power required\r\nthe other to leave vital national interests at the mercy of an ancient\r\nenemy, without undertaking to make corresponding sacrifices itself. The\r\nproblem probably would never have been solved by compromise; but\r\nmeanwhile the situation has been entirely transformed by the\r\nparticipation of Turkey in the European War, and the issue between\r\nGreece and Turkey, like the issue between Greece and Bulgaria, has been\r\nmerged in the general problem of the European settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan War of 1912 doomed the Ottoman power in Europe, but left its\r\nAsiatic future unimpaired. By making war against the Quadruple Entente,\r\nTurkey has staked her existence on both continents, and is threatened\r\nwith political extinction if the Central Powers succumb in the\r\nstruggle. In this event Greece will no longer have to accommodate her\r\nrégime in the liberated islands to the susceptibilities of a Turkey\r\nconsolidated on the opposite mainland, but will be able to stretch out\r\nher hand over the Anatolian coast and its hinterland, and compensate\r\nherself richly in this quarter for the territorial sacrifices which may\r\nstill be necessary to a lasting understanding with her Bulgarian\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nThe shores that dominate the Dardanelles will naturally remain beyond\r\nher grasp, but she may expect to establish herself on the western\r\nlittoral from a point as far north as Mount Ida and the plain of\r\nEdremid. The Greek coast-town of Aivali will be hers, and the still\r\nmore important focus of Greek commerce and civilization at Smyrna;\r\nwhile she will push her dominion along the railways that radiate from\r\nSmyrna towards the interior. South-eastward, Aidin will be hers in the\r\nvalley of the Mendere (Maiandros). Due eastward she will re-baptize the\r\nglistening city of Ala Shehr with its ancient name of Philadelphia,\r\nunder which it held out heroically for Hellenism many years after Aidin\r\nhad become the capital of a Moslem principality and the Turkish\r\navalanche had rolled past it to the sea. Maybe she will follow the\r\nrailway still further inland, and plant her flag on the Black Castle of\r\nAfiun, the natural railway-centre of Anatolia high up on the innermost\r\nplateau. All this and more was once Hellenic ground, and the Turkish\r\nincomer, for all his vitality, has never been able here to obliterate\r\nthe older culture or assimilate the earlier population. In this western\r\nregion Turkish villages are still interspersed with Greek, and under\r\nthe government of compatriots the unconquerable minority would\r\ninevitably reassert itself by the peaceful weapons of its superior\r\nenergy and intelligence.\r\n\r\n4. If Greece realizes these aspirations through Venezelos’\r\nstatesmanship, she will have settled in conjunction her outstanding\r\naccounts with both Bulgaria and Turkey; but a fourth group of islands\r\nstill remains for consideration, and these, though formerly the\r\nproperty of Turkey, are now in the hands of other European powers.\r\n\r\n_(a)_ The first of those in question are the Sporades, a chain of\r\nislands off the Anatolian coast which continues the line of Mitylini,\r\nKhios, and Samos towards the south-east, and includes Kos, Patmos,\r\nAstypalià, Karpathos, Kasos, and, above all, Rhodes. The Sporades were\r\noccupied by Italy during her war with Turkey in 1911-12, and she\r\nstipulated in the Peace of Lausanne that she should retain them as a\r\npledge until the last Ottoman soldier in Tripoli had been withdrawn,\r\nafter which she would make them over again to the Porte. The continued\r\nunrest in Tripoli may or may not have been due to Turkish intrigues,\r\nbut in any case it deferred the evacuation of the islands by Italy\r\nuntil the situation was transformed here also by the successive\r\nintervention of both powers in the European War. The consequent lapse\r\nof the Treaty of Lausanne simplifies the status of the Sporades, but it\r\nis doubtful what effect it will have upon their destiny. In language\r\nand political sympathy their inhabitants are as completely Greek as all\r\nthe other islanders of the Aegean, and if the Quadruple Entente has\r\nmade the principle of nationality its own, Italy is morally bound, now\r\nthat the Sporades are at her free disposal, to satisfy their national\r\naspirations by consenting to their union with the kingdom of Greece. On\r\nthe other hand, the prospective dissolution of the Ottoman Empire has\r\nincreased Italy’s stake in this quarter. In the event of a partition,\r\nthe whole southern littoral of Anatolia will probably fall within the\r\nItalian sphere, which will start from the Gulf of Iskanderun, include\r\nthe districts of Adana and Adalia, and march with the new Anatolian\r\nprovinces of Greece along the line of the river Mendere. This\r\ncontinental domain and the adjacent islands are geographically\r\ncomplementary to one another, and it is possible that Italy may for\r\nstrategical reasons insist on retaining the Sporades in perpetuity if\r\nshe realizes her ambitions on the continent. This solution would be\r\nless ideal than the other, but Greece would be wise to reconcile\r\nherself to it, as Italy has reconciled herself to the incorporation of\r\nCorsica in France; for by submitting frankly to this detraction from\r\nher national unity she would give her brethren in the Sporades the best\r\nopportunity of developing their national individuality untrammelled\r\nunder a friendly Italian suzerainty.\r\n\r\n_(b)_ The advance-guard of the Greek race that inhabits the great\r\nisland of Cyprus has been subject to British government since 1878,\r\nwhen the provisional occupation of the island by Great Britain under a\r\ncontract similar to that of Lausanne was negotiated in a secret\r\nagreement between Great Britain and Turkey on the eve of the Conference\r\nat Berlin. The condition of evacuation was in this case the withdrawal\r\nof Russia from Kars, and here likewise it never became operative till\r\nit was abrogated by the outbreak of war. Cyprus, like the Sporades, is\r\nnow at the disposal of its _de facto_ possessor, and on November 5,\r\n1914, it was annexed to the British Empire. But whatever decision Italy\r\nmay take, it is to be hoped that our own government at any rate will\r\nnot be influenced exclusively by strategical considerations, but will\r\nproclaim an intention of allowing Cyprus ultimately to realize its\r\nnational aspirations by union with Greece.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the above was written, this intention, under a\r\ncertain condition, has definitely been expressed.]\r\n\r\nThe whole population of the island is Greek in language, while under an\r\nexcellent British administration its political consciousness has been\r\nawakened, and has expressed itself in a growing desire for national\r\nunity among the Christian majority. It is true that in Cyprus, as in\r\nKrete, there is a considerable Greek-speaking minority of Moslems[1]\r\nwho prefer the _status quo_; but, since the barrier of language is\r\nabsent, their antipathy to union may not prove permanent. However\r\nimportant the retention of Cyprus may be to Great Britain from the\r\nstrategical point of view, we shall find that even in the balance of\r\nmaterial interests it is not worth the price of alienating the sympathy\r\nof an awakened and otherwise consolidated nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Cyprus about 22 per cent.]\r\n\r\nThis rather detailed review of problems in the islands and Anatolia\r\nbrings out the fact that Greek nationalism is not an artificial\r\nconception of theorists, but a real force which impels the most\r\nscattered and down-trodden populations of Greek speech to travail\r\nunceasingly for political unity within the national state. Yet by far\r\nthe most striking example of this attractive power in Hellenism is the\r\nhistory of it in ‘Epirus’.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The name coined to include the districts of Himarra,\r\nArgyrokastro, and Koritsà.]\r\n\r\nThe Epirots are a population of Albanian race, and they still speak an\r\nAlbanian dialect in their homes; while the women and children, at any\r\nrate, often know no other language. But somewhat over a century ago the\r\npolitical organism created by the remarkable personality of Ali Pasha\r\nin the hinterland of the Adriatic coast, and the relations of Great\r\nBritain and France with this new principality in the course of their\r\nstruggle for the Mediterranean, began to awaken in the Epirots a desire\r\nfor civilization. Their Albanian origin opened to them no prospects,\r\nfor the race had neither a literature nor a common historical\r\ntradition; and they accordingly turned to the Greeks, with whom they\r\nwere linked in religion by membership of the Orthodox Church, and in\r\npolitics by subjection to Ali’s Government at Yannina, which had\r\nadopted Greek as its official language.\r\n\r\nThey had appealed to the right quarter; for we have seen how Greek\r\nculture accumulated a store of latent energy under the Turkish yoke,\r\nand was expending it at this very period in a vigorous national\r\nrevival. The partially successful War of Liberation in the ‘twenties of\r\nthe nineteenth century was only the political manifestation of the new\r\nlife. It has expressed itself more typically in a steady and universal\r\nenthusiasm for education, which throughout the subsequent generations\r\nof political stagnation has always opened to individual Greeks\r\ncommercial and professional careers of the greatest brilliance, and\r\noften led them to spend the fortunes so acquired in endowing the nation\r\nwith further educational opportunities. Public spirit is a Greek\r\nvirtue. There are few villages which do not possess monuments of their\r\nsuccessful sons, and a school is an even commoner gift than a church;\r\nwhile the State has supplemented the individual benefactor to an extent\r\nremarkable where public resources are so slender. The school-house, in\r\nfact, is generally the most prominent and substantial building in a\r\nGreek village, and the advantage offered to the Epirots by a\r\n_rapprochement_ with the Greeks is concretely symbolized by the Greek\r\nschools established to-day in generous numbers throughout their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor the Epirot boy the school is the door to the future. The language\r\nhe learns there makes him the member of a nation, and opens to him a\r\nworld wide enough to employ all the talent and energy he may possess,\r\nif he seeks his fortune at Patras or Peiraeus, or in the great Greek\r\ncommercial communities of Alexandria and Constantinople; while, if he\r\nstays at home, it still affords him a link with the life of civilized\r\nEurope through the medium of the ubiquitous Greek newspaper.[1] The\r\nEpirot has thus become Greek in soul, for he has reached the conception\r\nof a national life more liberal than the isolated existence of his\r\nnative village through the avenue of Greek culture. ‘Hellenism’ and\r\nnationality have become for him identical ideas; and when at last the\r\nhour of deliverance struck, he welcomed the Greek armies that marched\r\ninto his country from the south and the east, after the fall of Yannina\r\nin the spring of 1913, with the same enthusiasm with which all the\r\nenslaved populations of native Greek dialect greeted the consummation\r\nof a century’s hopes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is still practically no literature printed in the\r\nAlbanian language.]\r\n\r\nThe Greek troops arrived only just in time, for the ‘Hellenism’ of the\r\nEpirots had been terribly proved by murderous attacks from their Moslem\r\nneighbours on the north. The latter speak a variety of the same\r\nAlbanian tongue, but were differentiated by a creed which assimilated\r\nthem to the ruling race. They had been superior to their Christian\r\nkinsmen by the weight of numbers and the possession of arms, which\r\nunder the Ottoman régime were the monopoly of the Moslem. At last,\r\nhowever, the yoke of oppression was broken and the Greek occupation\r\nseemed a harbinger of security for the future. Unluckily, however,\r\nEpirus was of interest to others besides its own inhabitants. It\r\noccupies an important geographical position facing the extreme heel of\r\nItaly, just below the narrowest point in the neck of the Adriatic, and\r\nthe Italian Government insisted that the country should be included in\r\nthe newly erected principality of Albania, which the powers had\r\nreserved the right to delimit in concert by a provision in the Treaty\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nItaly gave two reasons for her demand. First, she declared it\r\nincompatible with her own vital interests that both shores of the\r\nstrait between Corfù and the mainland should pass into the hands of the\r\nsame power, because the combination of both coasts and the channel\r\nbetween them offered a site for a naval base that might dominate the\r\nmouth of the Adriatic. Secondly, she maintained that the native\r\nAlbanian speech of the Epirots proved their Albanian nationality, and\r\nthat it was unjust to the new Albanian state to exclude from it the\r\nmost prosperous and civilized branch of the Albanian nation. Neither\r\nargument is cogent.\r\n\r\nThe first argument could easily be met by the neutralization of the\r\nCorfù straits,[1] and it is also considerably weakened by the fact that\r\nthe position which really commands the mouth of the Adriatic from the\r\neastern side is not the Corfù channel beyond it but the magnificent bay\r\nof Avlona just within its narrowest section, and this is a Moslem\r\ndistrict to which the Epirots have never laid claim, and which would\r\ntherefore in any case fall within the Albanian frontier. The second\r\nargument is almost ludicrous. The destiny of Epirus is not primarily\r\nthe concern of the other Albanians, of for that matter of the Greeks,\r\nbut of the Epirots themselves, and it is hard to see how their\r\nnationality can be defined except in terms of their own conscious and\r\nexpressed desire; for a nation is simply a group of men inspired by a\r\ncommon will to co-operate for certain purposes, and cannot be brought\r\ninto existence by the external manipulation of any specific objective\r\nfactors, but solely by the inward subjective impulse of its\r\nconstituents. It was a travesty of justice to put the Orthodox Epirots\r\nat the mercy of a Moslem majority (which had been massacring them the\r\nyear before) on the ground that they happened to speak the same\r\nlanguage. The hardship was aggravated by the fact that all the routes\r\nconnecting Epirus with the outer world run through Yannina and\r\nSalonika, from which the new frontier sundered her; while great natural\r\nbarriers separate her from Avlona and Durazzo, with which the same\r\nfrontier so ironically signalled her union.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Corfù itself is neutralized already by the agreement under\r\nwhich Great Britain transferred the Ionian Islands to Greece in 1863.]\r\n\r\nThe award of the powers roused great indignation in Greece, but\r\nVenezelos was strong enough to secure that it should scrupulously be\r\nrespected; and the ‘correct attitude’ which he inflexibly maintained\r\nhas finally won its reward. As soon as the decision of the powers was\r\nannounced, the Epirots determined to help themselves. They raised a\r\nmilitia, and asserted their independence so successfully, that they\r\ncompelled the Prince of Wied, the first (and perhaps the last) ruler of\r\nthe new ‘Albania’, to give them home rule in matters of police and\r\neducation, and to recognise Greek as the official language for their\r\nlocal administration. They ensured observance of this compact by the\r\nmaintenance of their troops under arms. So matters continued, until a\r\nrebellion among his Moslem subjects and the outbreak of the European\r\nWar in the summer of 1914 obliged the prince to depart, leaving Albania\r\nto its natural state of anarchy. The anarchy might have restored every\r\ncanton and village to the old state of contented isolation, had it not\r\nbeen for the religious hatred between the Moslems and the Epirots,\r\nwhich, with the removal of all external control, began to vent itself\r\nin an aggressive assault of the former upon the latter, and entailed\r\nmuch needless misery in the autumn months.\r\n\r\nThe reoccupation of Epirus by Greek troops had now become a matter of\r\nlife and death to its inhabitants, and in October 1914 Venezelos took\r\nthe inevitable step, after serving due notice upon all the signatories\r\nto the Treaty of London. Thanks in part to the absorption of the powers\r\nin more momentous business, but perhaps even in a greater degree to the\r\nconfidence which the Greek premier had justly won by his previous\r\nhandling of the question, this action was accomplished without protest\r\nor opposition. Since then Epirus has remained sheltered from the\r\nvicissitudes of civil war within and punitive expeditions from without,\r\nto which the unhappy remnant of Albania has been incessantly exposed;\r\nand we may prophesy that the Epiroi, unlike their repudiated brethren\r\nof Moslem or Catholic faith, have really seen the last of their\r\ntroubles. Even Italy, from whom they had most to fear, has obtained\r\nsuch a satisfactory material guarantee by the occupation on her own\r\npart of Avlona, that she is as unlikely to demand the evacuation of\r\nEpirus by Greece as she is to withdraw her own force from her long\r\ncoveted strategical base on the eastern shore of the Adriatic. In\r\nAvlona and Epirus the former rivals are settling down to a neighbourly\r\ncontact, and there is no reason to doubt that the _de facto_ line of\r\ndemarcation between them will develop into a permanent and officially\r\nrecognized frontier. The problem of Epirus, though not, unfortunately,\r\nthat of Albania, may be regarded as definitely closed.\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of Epirus is perhaps the most honourable achievement of\r\nthe Greek national revival, but it is by no means an isolated\r\nphenomenon. Western Europe is apt to depreciate modern ‘Hellenism’,\r\nchiefly because its ambitious denomination rather ludicrously\r\nchallenges comparison with a vanished glory, while any one who has\r\nstudied its rise must perceive that it has little more claim than\r\nwestern Europe itself to be the peculiar heir of ancient Greek culture.\r\nAnd yet this Hellenism of recent growth has a genuine vitality of its\r\nown. It displays a remarkable power of assimilating alien elements and\r\ninspiring them to an active pursuit of its ideals, and its allegiance\r\nsupplants all others in the hearts of those exposed to its charm. The\r\nEpirots are not the only Albanians who have been Hellenized. In the\r\nheart of central Greece and Peloponnesus, on the plain of Argos, and in\r\nthe suburbs of Athens, there are still Albanian enclaves, derived from\r\nthose successive migrations between the fourteenth and the eighteenth\r\ncenturies; but they have so entirely forgotten their origin that the\r\nvillagers, when questioned, can only repeat: ‘We can’t say why we\r\nhappen to speak “Arvanitikà”, but we are Greeks like everybody else.’\r\nThe Vlachs again, a Romance-speaking tribe of nomadic shepherds who\r\nhave wandered as far south as Akarnania and the shores of the\r\nKorinthian Gulf, are settling down there to the agricultural life of\r\nthe Greek village, so that Hellenism stands to them for the transition\r\nto a higher social phase. Their still migratory brethren in the\r\nnorthern ranges of Pindus are already ‘Hellenes’ in political\r\nsympathy,[1] and are moving under Greek influence towards the same\r\nsocial evolution. In distant Cappadocia, at the root of the Anatolian\r\npeninsula, the Orthodox Greek population, submerged beneath the Turkish\r\nflood more than eight centuries ago, has retained little individuality\r\nexcept in its religion, and nothing of its native speech but a garbled\r\nvocabulary embedded in a Turkified syntax. Yet even this dwindling\r\nrear-guard has been overtaken just in time by the returning current of\r\nnational life, bringing with it the Greek school, and with the school a\r\ncommunity of outlook with Hellenism the world over. Whatever the fate\r\nof eastern Anatolia may be, the Greek element is now assured a\r\nprominent part in its future.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Greece owed her naval supremacy in 1912-13 to the new\r\ncruiser _Georgios Averof_, named after a Vlach millionaire who made his\r\nfortune in the Greek colony at Alexandria and left a legacy for the\r\nship’s construction at his death.]\r\n\r\nThese, moreover, are the peripheries of the Greek world; and at its\r\ncentre the impulse towards union in the national state readies a\r\npassionate intensity. ‘Aren’t you better off as you are?’ travellers\r\nused to ask in Krete during the era of autonomy. ‘If you get your\r\n“Union”, you will have to do two years’ military service instead of one\r\nyear’s training in the militia, and will be taxed up to half as much\r\nagain.’ ‘We have thought of that,’ the Kretans would reply, ‘but what\r\ndoes it matter, if we are united with Greece?’\r\n\r\nOn this unity modern Hellenism has concentrated its efforts, and after\r\nnearly a century of ineffective endeavour it has been brought by the\r\nstatesmanship of Venezelos within sight of its goal. Our review of\r\noutstanding problems reveals indeed the inconclusiveness of the\r\nsettlement imposed at Bucarest; but this only witnesses to the wisdom\r\nof the Greek nation in reaffirming its confidence in Venezelos at the\r\npresent juncture, and recalling him to power to crown the work which he\r\nhas so brilliantly carried through. Under Venezelos’ guidance we cannot\r\ndoubt that the heart’s desire of Hellenism will be accomplished at the\r\nimpending European settlement by the final consolidation of the\r\nHellenic national state.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This paragraph, again, has been superseded by the dramatic\r\nturn of events; but the writer has left it unaltered, for the end is\r\nnot yet.]\r\n\r\nYet however attractive the sincerity of such nationalism may be,\r\npolitical unity is only a negative achievement. The history of a nation\r\nmust be judged rather by the positive content of its ideals and the\r\npositive results which it attains, and herein the Hellenic revival\r\ndisplays certain grave shortcomings. The internal paralysis of social\r\nand economic life has already been noted and ascribed to the urgency of\r\nthe ‘preliminary question’; but we must now add to this the growing\r\nembitterment which has poisoned the relations of Greece with her Balkan\r\nneighbours during the crises through which the ‘preliminary question’\r\nhas been worked out to its solution. Now that this solution is at hand,\r\nwill Hellenism prove capable of casting out these two evils, and adapt\r\nitself with strength renewed to the new phase of development that lies\r\nbefore it?\r\n\r\nThe northern territories acquired in 1913 will give a much greater\r\nimpetus to economic progress than Thessaly gave a generation ago; for\r\nthe Macedonian littoral west as well as east of the Struma produces a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the Turkish Régie tobacco, while the\r\npine-forests of Pindus, if judiciously exploited, will go far to remedy\r\nthe present deficiency of home-grown timber, even if they do not\r\nprovide quantities sufficient for export abroad. If we take into\r\naccount the currant-crop of the Peloponnesian plain-lands which already\r\nalmost monopolizes the world-market, the rare ores of the south-eastern\r\nmountains and the Archipelago, and the vintages which scientific\r\ntreatment might bring into competition with the wines of the Peninsula\r\nand France, we can see that Greece has many sources of material\r\nprosperity within her reach, if only she applies her liberated energy\r\nto their development. Yet these are all of them specialized products,\r\nand Greece will never export any staple commodity to rival the grain\r\nwhich Rumania sends in such quantities to central Europe already, and\r\nwhich Bulgaria will begin to send within a few years’ time. Even the\r\nconsolidated Greek kingdom will be too small in area and too little\r\ncompact in geographical outline to constitute an independent economic\r\nunit, and the ultimate economic interests of the country demand\r\nco-operation in some organization more comprehensive than the political\r\nmolecule of the national state.\r\n\r\nSuch an association should embrace the Balkans in their widest extent—\r\nfrom the Black Sea to the Adriatic and from the Carpathians to the\r\nAegean; for, in sharp contrast to the inextricable chaos of its\r\nlinguistic and ecclesiastical divisions, the region constitutes\r\neconomically a homogeneous and indivisible whole, in which none of the\r\nparts can divest themselves of their mutual interdependence. Greece,\r\nfor example, has secured at last her direct link with the railway\r\nsystem of the European continent, but for free transit beyond her own\r\nfrontier she still depends on Serbia’s good-will, just, as Serbia\r\ndepends on hers for an outlet to the Aegean at Salonika. The two states\r\nhave provided for their respective interests by a joint proprietorship\r\nof the section of railway between Salonika and Belgrade; and similar\r\nrailway problems will doubtless bring Rumania to terms with Serbia for\r\naccess to the Adriatic, and both with Bulgaria for rights of way to\r\nConstantinople and the Anatolian hinterland beyond. These common\r\ncommercial arteries of the Balkans take no account of racial or\r\npolitical frontiers, but link the region as a whole with other regions\r\nin a common economic relation.\r\n\r\nSouth-eastern and central Europe are complementary economic areas in a\r\nspecial degree. The industries of central Europe will draw upon the raw\r\nproducts of the south-east to an increasing extent, and the south-east\r\nwill absorb in turn increasing quantities of manufactured plant from\r\ncentral Europe for the development of its own natural resources. The\r\ntwo areas will become parties in a vast economic nexus, and, as in all\r\nbusiness transactions, each will try to get the best of the continually\r\nintensified bargaining. This is why co-operation is so essential to the\r\nfuture well-being of the Balkan States. Isolated individually and\r\nmutually competitive as they are at present, they must succumb to the\r\neconomic ascendancy of Vienna and Berlin as inevitably as unorganized,\r\nunskilled labourers fall under the thraldom of a well-equipped\r\ncapitalist. Central Europe will have in any event an enormous initial\r\nsuperiority over the Balkans in wealth, population, and business\r\nexperience; and the Balkan peoples can only hope to hold their own in\r\nthis perilous but essential intercourse with a stronger neighbour, if\r\nthey take more active and deliberate steps towards co-operation among\r\nthemselves, and find in railway conventions the basis for a Balkan\r\nzollverein. A zollverein should be the first goal of Balkan\r\nstatesmanship in the new phase of history that is opening for Europe;\r\nbut economic relations on this scale involve the political factor, and\r\nthe Balkans will not be able to deal with their great neighbours on\r\nequal terms till the zollverein has ripened into a federation. The\r\nalternative is subjection, both political and economic; and neither the\r\nexhaustion of the Central Powers in the present struggle nor the\r\nindividual consolidation of the Balkan States in the subsequent\r\nsettlement will suffice by themselves to avert it in the end.\r\n\r\nThe awakening of the nation and the consolidation of the state, which\r\nwe have traced in these pages, must accordingly lead on to the\r\nconfederation of the Balkans, if all that has been so painfully won is\r\nnot to perish again without result; and we are confronted with the\r\nquestion: Will Balkan nationalism rise to the occasion and transcend\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nMany spectators of recent history will dismiss the suggestion as\r\nUtopian. ‘Nationality’, they will say, ‘revealed itself first as a\r\nconstructive force, and Europe staked its future upon it; but now that\r\nwe are committed to it, it has developed a sinister destructiveness\r\nwhich we cannot remedy. Nationality brought the Balkan States into\r\nbeing and led them to final victory over the Turk in 1912, only to set\r\nthem tearing one another to pieces again in 1913. In the present\r\ncatastrophe the curse of the Balkans has descended upon the whole of\r\nEurope, and laid bare unsuspected depths of chaotic hatred; yet Balkan\r\nantagonisms still remain more ineradicable than ours. The cure for\r\nnationality is forgetfulness, but Balkan nationalism is rooted\r\naltogether in the past. The Balkan peoples have suffered one shattering\r\nexperience in common—the Turk, and the waters of Ottoman oppression\r\nthat have gone over their souls have not been waters of Lethe. They\r\nhave endured long centuries of spiritual exile by the passionate\r\nremembrance of their Sion, and when they have vindicated their heritage\r\nat last, and returned to build up the walls of their city and the\r\ntemple of their national god, they have resented each other’s\r\nneighbourhood as the repatriated Jew resented the Samaritan. The Greek\r\ndreams with sullen intensity of a golden age before the Bulgar was\r\nfound in the land, and the challenge implied in the revival of the\r\nHellenic name, so far from being a superficial vanity, is the dominant\r\ncharacteristic of the nationalism which has adopted it for its title.\r\nModern Hellenism breathes the inconscionable spirit of the _émigré_.’\r\n\r\nThis is only too true. The faith that has carried them to national\r\nunity will suffice neither the Greeks nor any other Balkan people for\r\nthe new era that has dawned upon them, and the future would look dark\r\nindeed, but for a strange and incalculable leaven, which is already\r\npotently at work in the land.\r\n\r\nSince the opening of the present century, the chaotic, unneighbourly\r\nraces of south-eastern Europe, whom nothing had united before but the\r\ncommon impress of the Turk, have begun to share another experience in\r\ncommon— America. From the Slovak villages in the Carpathians to the\r\nGreek villages in the Laconian hills they have been crossing the\r\nAtlantic in their thousands, to become dockers and navvies, boot-blacks\r\nand waiters, confectioners and barbers in Chicago, St. Louis, Omaha,\r\nand all the other cities that have sprung up like magic to welcome the\r\nimmigrant to the hospitable plains of the Middle West. The intoxication\r\nof his new environment stimulates all the latent industry and vitality\r\nof the Balkan peasant, and he abandons himself whole-heartedly to\r\nAmerican life; yet he does not relinquish the national tradition in\r\nwhich he grew up. In America work brings wealth, and the Greek or\r\nSlovak soon worships his God in a finer church and reads his language\r\nin a better-printed newspaper than he ever enjoyed in his native\r\nvillage. The surplus flows home in remittances of such abundance that\r\nthey are steadily raising the cost of living in the Balkans themselves,\r\nor, in other words, the standard of material civilization; and sooner\r\nor later the immigrant goes the way of his money orders, for\r\nhome-sickness, if not a mobilization order, exerts its compulsion\r\nbefore half a dozen years are out.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange experience to spend a night in some remote\r\nmountain-village of Greece, and see Americanism and Hellenism face to\r\nface. Hellenism is represented by the village schoolmaster. He wears a\r\nblack coat, talks a little French, and can probably read Homer; but his\r\nlongest journey has been to the normal school at Athens, and it has not\r\naltered his belief that the ikon in the neighbouring monastery was made\r\nby St. Luke and the Bulgar beyond the mountains by the Devil. On the\r\nother side of you sits the returned emigrant, chattering irrepressibly\r\nin his queer version of the ‘American language’, and showing you the\r\nnewspapers which are mailed to him every fortnight from the States. His\r\nclean linen collar and his well-made American boots are conspicuous\r\nupon him, and he will deprecate on your behalf and his own the\r\ndiscomfort and squalor of his native surroundings. His home-coming has\r\nbeen a disillusionment, but it is a creative phenomenon; and if any one\r\ncan set Greece upon a new path it is he. He is transforming her\r\nmaterial life by his American savings, for they are accumulating into a\r\ncapital widely distributed in native hands, which will dispense the\r\nnation from pawning its richest mines and vineyards to the European\r\nexploiter, and enable it to carry on their development on its own\r\naccount at this critical juncture when European sources of capital are\r\ncut off for an indefinite period by the disaster of the European War.\r\nThe emigrant will give Greece all Trikoupis dreamed of, but his\r\ngreatest gift to his country will be his American point of view. In the\r\nWest he has learnt that men of every language and religion can live in\r\nthe same city and work at the same shops and sheds and mills and\r\nswitch-yards without desecrating each other’s churches or even\r\nsuppressing each other’s newspapers, not to speak of cutting each\r\nother’s throats; and when next he meets Albanian or Bulgar on Balkan\r\nground, he may remember that he has once dwelt with him in fraternity\r\nat Omaha or St. Louis or Chicago. This is the gospel of Americanism,\r\nand unlike Hellenism, which spread downwards from the patriarch’s\r\nresidence and the merchant’s counting-house, it is being preached in\r\nall the villages of the land by the least prejudiced and most\r\nenterprising of their sons (for it is these who answer America’s call);\r\nand spreading upward from the peasant towards the professor in the\r\nuniversity and the politician in parliament.\r\n\r\nWill this new leaven conquer, and cast out the stale leaven of\r\nHellenism before it sours the loaf? Common sense is mighty, but whether\r\nit shall prevail in Greece and the Balkans and Europe lies on the knees\r\nof the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUMANIA: HER HISTORY AND POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n_Introduction_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the origin and formation of the Rumanian nation has\r\nalways provided matter for keen disputation among historians, and the\r\ntheories which have been advanced are widely divergent. Some of these\r\ndiscussions have been undertaken solely for political reasons, and in\r\nsuch cases existing data prove conveniently adaptable. This elastic\r\ntreatment of the historical data is facilitated by the fact that a long\r\nand important period affecting the formation and the development of the\r\nRumanian nation (270-1220) has bequeathed practically no contemporary\r\nevidence. By linking up, however, what is known antecedent to that\r\nperiod with the precise data available regarding the following it, and\r\nby checking the inferred results with what little evidence exists\r\nrespecting the obscure epoch of Rumanian history, it has been possible\r\nto reconstruct, almost to a certainty, the evolution of the Rumanians\r\nduring the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nA discussion of the varying theories would be out of proportion, and\r\nout of place, in this essay. Nor is it possible to give to any extent a\r\ndetailed description of the epic struggle which the Rumanians carried\r\non for centuries against the Turks. I shall have to deal, therefore, on\r\nbroad lines, with the historical facts—laying greater stress only upon\r\nthe three fundamental epochs of Rumanian history: the formation of the\r\nRumanian nation; its initial casting into a national polity (foundation\r\nof the Rumanian principalities); and its final evolution into the\r\nactual unitary State; and shall then pass on to consider the more\r\nrecent internal and external development of Rumania, and her present\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n_Formation of the Rumanian Nation_\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the fifth century B.C., when the population of the\r\nBalkan-Carpathian region consisted of various tribes belonging to the\r\nIndo-European family, the northern portion of the Balkan peninsula was\r\nconquered by the Thracians and the Illyrians. The Thracians spread\r\nnorth and south, and a branch of their race, the Dacians, crossed the\r\nDanube. The latter established themselves on both sides of the\r\nCarpathian ranges, in the region which now comprises the provinces of\r\nOltenia (Rumania), and Banat and Transylvania (Hungary). The Dacian\r\nEmpire expanded till its boundaries touched upon those of the Roman\r\nEmpire. The Roman province of Moesia (between the Danube and the\r\nBalkans) fell before its armies, and the campaign that ensued was so\r\nsuccessful that the Dacians were able to compel Rome to an alliance.\r\n\r\nTwo expeditions undertaken against Dacia by the Emperor Trajan (98-117)\r\nreleased Rome from these ignominious obligations, and brought Dacia\r\nunder Roman rule (A.D. 106). Before his second expedition Trajan\r\nerected a stone bridge over the Danube, the remains of which can still\r\nbe seen at Turnu-Severin, a short distance below the point where the\r\nDanube enters Rumanian territory. Trajan celebrated his victory by\r\nerecting at Adam Klissi (in the province of Dobrogea) the recently\r\ndiscovered _Tropaeum Traiani_, and in Rome the celebrated ‘Trajan’s\r\nColumn’, depicting in marble reliefs various episodes of the Dacian\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nThe new Roman province was limited to the regions originally inhabited\r\nby the Dacians, and a strong garrison, estimated by historians at\r\n25,000 men, was left to guard it. Numerous colonists from all parts of\r\nthe Roman Empire were brought here as settlers, and what remained of\r\nthe Dacian population completely amalgamated with them. The new\r\nprovince quickly developed under the impulse of Roman civilization, of\r\nwhich numerous inscriptions and other archaeological remains are\r\nevidence. It became one of the most flourishing dependencies of the\r\nRoman Empire, and was spoken of as _Dacia Felix_.\r\n\r\nAbout a century and a half later hordes of barbarian invaders, coming\r\nfrom the north and east, swept over the country. Under the strain of\r\nthose incursions the Roman legions withdrew by degrees into Moesia, and\r\nin A.D. 271 Dacia was finally evacuated. But the colonists remained,\r\nretiring into the Carpathians, where they lived forgotten of history.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful of these invaders were the Goths (271-375), who,\r\ncoming from the shores of the Baltic, had shortly before settled north\r\nof the Black Sea. Unaccustomed to mountain life, they did not penetrate\r\nbeyond the plains between the Carpathians and the Dnjester. They had\r\nconsequently but little intercourse with the Daco-Roman population, and\r\nthe total absence in the Rumanian language and in Rumanian place-names\r\nof words of Gothic origin indicates that their stay had no influence\r\nupon country or population. Material evidence of their occupation is\r\nafforded, however, by a number of articles made of gold found in 1837\r\nat Petroasa (Moldavia), and now in the National Museum at Bucarest.\r\n\r\nAfter the Goths came the Huns (375-453), under Attila, the Avars\r\n(566-799), both of Mongolian race, and the Gepidae (453-566), of Gothic\r\nrace—all savage, bloodthirsty raiders, passing and repassing over the\r\nRumanian regions, pillaging and burning everywhere. To avoid\r\ndestruction the Daco-Roman population withdrew more and more into the\r\ninaccessible wooded regions of the mountains, and as a result were in\r\nno wise influenced by contact with the invaders.\r\n\r\nBut with the coming of the Slavs, who settled in the Balkan peninsula\r\nabout the beginning of the seventh century, certain fundamental changes\r\ntook place in the ethnical conditions prevailing on the Danube. The\r\nRumanians were separated from the Romans, following the occupation by\r\nthe Slavs of the Roman provinces between the Adriatic and the Black\r\nSea. Such part of the population as was not annihilated during the\r\nraids of the Avars was taken into captivity, or compelled to retire\r\nsouthwards towards modern Macedonia and northwards towards the Dacian\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nParts of the Rumanian country became dependent upon the new state\r\nfounded between the Balkans and the Danube in 679 by the Bulgarians, a\r\npeople of Turanian origin, who formerly inhabited the regions north of\r\nthe Black Sea between the Volga and the mouth of the Danube.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversion of the Bulgarians to Christianity (864) the\r\nSlovenian language was introduced into their Church, and afterwards\r\nalso into the Church of the already politically dependent Rumanian\r\nprovinces.[1] This finally severed the Daco-Rumanians from the Latin\r\nworld. The former remained for a long time under Slav influence, the\r\nextent of which is shown by the large number of words of Slav origin\r\ncontained in the Rumanian language, especially in geographical and\r\nagricultural terminology.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Rumanians north and south of the Danube embraced the\r\nChristian faith after its introduction into the Roman Empire by\r\nConstantine the Great (325), with Latin as religious language and their\r\nchurch organization under the rule of Rome. A Christian basilica,\r\ndating from that period, has been discovered by the Rumanian;\r\narchaeologist, Tocilescu, at Adam Klissi (Dobrogea).]\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Hungarians (a people of Mongolian race) about the end\r\nof the ninth century put an end to the Bulgarian domination in Dacia.\r\nWhile a few of the existing Rumanian duchies were subdued by Stephen\r\nthe Saint, the first King of Hungary (995-1038), the ‘land of the\r\nVlakhs’ (_Terra Blacorum_), in the south-eastern part of Transylvania,\r\nenjoyed under the Hungarian kings a certain degree of national\r\nautonomy. The Hungarian chronicles speak of the Vlakhs as ‘former\r\ncolonists of the Romans’. The ethnological influence of the Hungarians\r\nupon the Rumanian population has been practically nil. They found the\r\nRumanian nation firmly established, race and language, and the latter\r\nremained pure of Magyarisms, even in Transylvania. Indeed, it is easy\r\nto prove—and it is only what might be expected, seeing that the\r\nRumanians had attained a higher state of civilization than the\r\nHungarian invaders—that the Hungarians were largely influenced by the\r\nDaco-Romans. They adopted Latin as their official language, they copied\r\nmany of the institutions and customs of the Rumanians, and recruited a\r\nlarge number of their nobles from among the Rumanian nobility, which\r\nwas already established on a feudal basis when the Hungarians arrived.\r\n\r\nA great number of the Rumanian nobles and freemen were, however,\r\ninimical to the new masters, and migrated to the regions across the\r\nmountains. This the Hungarians used as a pretext for bringing parts of\r\nRumania under their domination, and they were only prevented from\r\nfurther extending it by the coming of the Tartars (1241), the last\r\npeople of Mongolian origin to harry these regions. The Hungarians\r\nmaintained themselves, however, in the parts which they had already\r\noccupied, until the latter were united into the principality of the\r\n‘Rumanian land’.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: ‘The Rumanians are living to-day where fifteen centuries ago\r\ntheir ancestors were living. The possession of the regions on the Lower\r\nDanube passed from one nation to another, but none endangered the\r\nRumanian nation as a national entity. “The water passes, the stones\r\nremain”; the hordes of the migration period, detached from their native\r\nsoil, disappeared as mist before the sun. But the Roman element bent\r\ntheir heads while the storm passed over them, clinging to the old\r\nplaces until the advent of happier days, when they were able to stand\r\nup and stretch their limbs.’[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Traugott Tamm, _Über den Ursprung der Rumänen,_, Bonn,\r\n1891.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n_The Foundation and Development of the Rumanian Principalities_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to organize itself into a political entity was made\r\nby the Rumanian nation in the thirteenth century, when, under the\r\nimpulse of the disaffected nobles coming from Hungary, the two\r\nprincipalities of ‘Muntenia’ (Mountain Land), commonly known as\r\nWallachia and ‘Moldavia’, came into being. The existence of Rumanians\r\non both sides of the Carpathians long before Wallachia was founded is\r\ncorroborated by contemporary chroniclers. We find evidence of it in as\r\ndistant a source as the _History of the Mongols,_ of the Persian\r\nchronicler, Rashid Al-Din, who, describing the invasion of the Tartars,\r\nsays: ‘In the middle of spring (1240) the princes (Mongols or Tartars)\r\ncrossed the mountains in order to enter the country of the Bulares\r\n(Bulgarians) and of the Bashguirds (Hungarians). Orda, who was marching\r\nto the right, passed through the country of the Haute (Olt), where\r\nBazarambam met him with an army, but was beaten. Boudgek crossed the\r\nmountains to enter the Kara-Ulak, and defeated the Ulak (Vlakh)\r\npeople.’[1] Kara-Ulak means Black Wallachia; Bazarambam is certainly\r\nthe corrupted name of the Ban Bassarab, who ruled as vassal of Hungary\r\nover the province of Oltenia, and whose dynasty founded the\r\nprincipality of Muntenia. The early history of this principality was\r\nmarked by efforts to free it from Hungarian domination, a natural\r\ndevelopment of the desire for emancipation which impelled the Rumanians\r\nto migrate from the subdued provinces in Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Xenopol, _Histoire des Roumains,_ Paris, 1896, i, 168.]\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Moldavia dates from after the retreat of the Tartars,\r\nwho had occupied the country for a century (1241-1345). They were\r\ndriven out by an expedition under Hungarian leadership, with the aid of\r\nRumanians from the province of Maramuresh. It was the latter who then\r\nfounded the principality of Moldavia under the suzerainty of Hungary,\r\nthe chroniclers mentioning as its first ruler the Voivod Dragosh.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The legend as to the foundation of Moldavia tells us that\r\nDragosh, when hunting one day in the mountains, was pursuing a bison\r\nthrough the dense forest. Towards sunset, just when a successful shot\r\nfrom his bow had struck and killed the animal, he emerged at a point\r\nfrom which the whole panorama of Moldavia was unfolded before his\r\nastonished eyes. Deeply moved by the beauty of this fair country, he\r\nresolved to found a state there. It is in commemoration of this event\r\nthat Moldavia bears the head of a wild bison on her banner.]\r\n\r\nThe rudimentary political formations which already existed before the\r\nfoundation of the principalities were swept away by the invasion of the\r\nTartars, who destroyed all trace of constituted authority in the plains\r\nbelow the Carpathians. In consequence the immigrants from Transylvania\r\ndid not encounter any resistance, and were even able to impose\r\nobedience upon the native population, though coming rather as refugees\r\nthan as conquerors. These new-comers were mostly nobles (boyards).\r\nTheir emigration deprived the masses of the Rumanian population of\r\nTransylvania of all moral and political support—especially as a part of\r\nthe nobility had already been won over by their Hungarian masters—and\r\nwith time the masses fell into servitude. On the other hand the\r\nimmigrating nobles strengthened and secured the predominance of their\r\nclass in the states which were to be founded. In both cases the\r\nsituation of the peasantry became worse, and we have, curiously enough,\r\nthe same social fact brought about by apparently contrary causes.\r\n\r\nThough the Rumanians seem to have contributed but little, up to the\r\nnineteenth century, to the advance of civilization, their part in\r\nEuropean history is nevertheless a glorious one, and if less apparent,\r\nperhaps of more fundamental importance. By shedding their blood in the\r\nstruggle against the Ottoman invasion, they, together with the other\r\npeoples of Oriental Europe, procured that security which alone made\r\npossible the development of western civilization. Their merit, like\r\nthat of all with whom they fought, ‘is not to have vanquished time and\r\nagain the followers of Mohammed, who always ended by gaining the upper\r\nhand, but rather to have resisted with unparalleled energy,\r\nperseverance, and bravery the terrible Ottoman invaders, making them\r\npay for each step advanced such a heavy price, that their resources\r\nwere drained, they were unable to carry on the fight, and thus their\r\npower came to an end’.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Xenopol, op. cit., i. 266.]\r\n\r\nFrom the phalanx of Christian warriors stand out the names of a few who\r\nwere the bravest of a time when bravery was common; but while it is at\r\nleast due that more tribute than a mere mention of their names should\r\nbe paid to the patriot princes who fought in life-long conflict against\r\nTurkish domination, space does not permit me to give more than the\r\nbriefest summary of the wars which for centuries troubled the country.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1389, when Mircea the Old was Prince of Wallachia, that the\r\nunited Balkan nations attempted for the first time to check Ottoman\r\ninvasion. The battle of Kosovo, however, was lost, and Mircea had to\r\nconsent to pay tribute to the Turks. For a short space after the battle\r\nof Rovine (1398), where Mircea defeated an invading Turkish army, the\r\ncountry had peace, until Turkish victories under the Sultan Mohammed\r\nresulted, in 1411, in further submissions to tribute.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of mention that it was on the basis of tribute that the\r\nrelations between Turkey and Rumania rested until 1877, the Rumanian\r\nprovinces becoming at no time what Hungary was for a century and a\r\nhalf, namely, a Turkish province.\r\n\r\nIn a battle arising following his frustration—by means not unconnected\r\nwith his name—of a Turkish plot against his person, Vlad the Impaler\r\n(1458-62) completely defeated the Turks under Mohammed II; but an\r\nunfortunate feud against Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia, put an\r\nend to the reign of Vlad—a fierce but just prince.\r\n\r\nA period of the most lamentable decadence followed, during which\r\nTurkish domination prevailed more and more in the country. During an\r\ninterval of twenty-five years (1521-46) no less than eleven princes\r\nsucceeded one another on the throne of Muntenia, whilst of the nineteen\r\nprinces who ruled during the last three-quarters of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, only two died a natural death while still reigning.\r\n\r\nIn Moldavia also internal struggles were weakening the country. Not\r\npowerful enough to do away with one another, the various aspirants to\r\nthe throne contented themselves with occupying and ruling over parts of\r\nthe province. Between 1443-7 there were no less than three princes\r\nreigning simultaneously, whilst one of them, Peter III, lost and\r\nregained the throne three times.\r\n\r\nFor forty-seven years (1457-1504) Stephen the Great fought for the\r\nindependence of Moldavia. At Racova, in 1475, he annihilated an Ottoman\r\narmy in a victory considered the greatest ever secured by the Cross\r\nagainst Islam. The Shah of Persia, Uzun Hasan, who was also fighting\r\nthe Turks, offered him an alliance, urging him at the same time to\r\ninduce all the Christian princes to unite with the Persians against the\r\ncommon foe. These princes, as well as Pope Sixtus IV, gave him great\r\npraise; but when Stephen asked from them assistance in men and money,\r\nnot only did he receive none, but Vladislav, King of Hungary, conspired\r\nwith his brother Albert, King of Poland, to conquer and divide Moldavia\r\nbetween them. A Polish army entered the country, but was utterly\r\ndestroyed by Stephen in the forest of Kosmin.\r\n\r\nHaving had the opportunity of judging at its right value the friendship\r\nof the Christian princes, on his death-bed Stephen advised his son\r\nBogdan to make voluntary submission to the Turks. Thus Moldavia, like\r\nWallachia, came under Turkish suzerainty.\r\n\r\nFor many years after Stephen’s death the Turks exploited the Rumanian\r\ncountries shamelessly, the very candidates for the throne having to pay\r\ngreat sums for Turkish support. The country groaned under the resultant\r\ntaxation and the promiscuousness of the tribute exacted till, in 1572,\r\nJohn the Terrible ascended the Moldavian throne. This prince refused to\r\npay tribute, and repeatedly defeated the Turks. An army of 100,000 men\r\nadvanced against John; but his cavalry, composed of nobles not\r\nover-loyal to a prince having the peasant cause so much at heart,\r\ndeserted to the enemy, with the result that, after a gallant and\r\nprolonged resistance, he suffered defeat.\r\n\r\nMichael the Brave, Prince of Muntenia (1593-1601), was the last of the\r\nVlakhs to stand up against Turkish aggression. This prince not only\r\nsucceeded in crushing a Turkish army sent against him, but he invaded\r\nTransylvania, whose prince had leanings towards Turkey, pushed further\r\ninto Moldavia, and succeeded in bringing the three Rumanian countries\r\nunder his rule. Michael is described in the documents of the time as\r\n‘Prince of the whole land of Hungro-Wallachia, of Transylvania, and of\r\nMoldavia’. He ruled for eight years. ‘It was not the Turkish sword\r\nwhich put an end to the exploits of Michael the Brave. The Magyars of\r\nTransylvania betrayed him; the German emperor condemned him; and a\r\nGreek in Austria’s service, General Basta, had him sabred: as though it\r\nwere fated that all the enemies of the Rumanian race, the Magyar, the\r\nGerman, and the Greek, should unite to dip their hands in the blood of\r\nthe Latin hero.’[1] The union of the Rumanian lands which he realized\r\ndid not last long; but it gave form and substance to the idea which was\r\nfrom that day onward to be the ideal of the Rumanian nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Alfred Rumbaud, Introduction to Xenopol, op, cit., i.\r\nxix.]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental cause of all the sufferings of the Rumanian\r\nprincipalities was the hybrid ‘hereditary-elective’ system of\r\nsuccession to the throne, which prevailed also in most of the\r\nneighbouring countries. All members of the princely family were\r\neligible for the succession; but the right of selecting among them lay\r\nwith an assembly composed of the higher nobility and clergy. All was\r\nwell if a prince left only one successor. But if there were several,\r\neven if illegitimate children, claiming the right to rule, then each\r\nendeavoured to gain over the nobility with promises, sometimes,\r\nmoreover, seeking the support of neighbouring countries. This system\r\nrendered easier and hastened the establishment of Turkish domination;\r\nand corruption and intrigues, in which the Sultan’s harem had a share,\r\nbecame capital factors in the choice and election of the ruler.\r\n\r\nEconomically and intellectually all this was disastrous. The Rumanians\r\nwere an agricultural people. The numerous class of small freeholders\r\n(moshneni and razeshi), not being able to pay the exorbitant taxes,\r\noften had their lands confiscated by the princes. Often, too, not being\r\nable to support themselves, they sold their property and their very\r\nselves to the big landowners. Nor did the nobles fare better. Formerly\r\nfree, quasi-feudal warriors, seeking fortune in reward for services\r\nrendered to their prince, they were often subjected to coercive\r\ntreatment on his part now that the throne depended upon the goodwill of\r\ninfluential personages at Constantinople. Various civil offices were\r\ncreated at court, either necessitated by the extension of the relations\r\nof the country or intended to satisfy some favourite of the prince.\r\nSources of social position and great material benefit, these offices\r\nwere coveted greedily by the boyards, and those who obtained none could\r\nonly hope to cheat fortune by doing their best to undermine the\r\nposition of the prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n_The Phanariote Rule_\r\n\r\n\r\nThese offices very presently fell to the lot of the Phanariotes (Greek\r\nmerchants and bankers inhabiting the quarter of Phanar), who had in\r\nsome way or another assisted the princes to their thrones, these being\r\nnow practically put up to auction in Constantinople. As a natural\r\nconsequence of such a state of affairs the thoughts of the Rumanian\r\nprinces turned to Russia as a possible supporter against Ottoman\r\noppression. A formal alliance was entered into in 1711 with Tsar Peter\r\nthe Great, but a joint military action against the Turks failed, the\r\nTsar returned to Russia, and the Porte threatened to transform\r\nMoldavia, in order to secure her against incipient Russian influence,\r\ninto a Turkish province with a pasha as administrator. The nobles were\r\npreparing to leave the country, and the people to retire into the\r\nmountains, as their ancestors had done in times of danger. It is not to\r\nbe wondered at that, under the menace of losing their autonomy, the\r\nRumanians ‘welcomed the nomination of the dragoman of the Porte,\r\nNicholas Mavrocordato, though he was a Greek. The people greeted with\r\njoy the accession of the first Phanariote to the throne of the\r\nprincipality of Moldavia’[1] (1711).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Xenopol, op. cit., ii. 138]\r\n\r\nKnowledge of foreign languages had enabled the Phanariotes to obtain\r\nimportant diplomatic positions at Constantinople, and they ended by\r\nacquiring the thrones of the Rumanian principalities as a recompense\r\nfor their services. But they had to pay for it, and to make matters\r\nmore profitable the Turks devised the ingenious method of transferring\r\nthe princes from one province to another, each transference being\r\nconsidered as a new nomination. From 1730 to 1741 the two reigning\r\nprinces interchanged thrones in this way three times. They acquired the\r\nthrone by gold, and they could only keep it by gold. All depended upon\r\nhow much they wore able to squeeze out of the country. The princes soon\r\nbecame past masters in the art of spoliation. They put taxes upon\r\nchimneys, and the starving peasants pulled their cottages down and went\r\nto live in mountain caves; they taxed the animals, and the peasants\r\npreferred to kill the few beasts they possessed. But this often proved\r\nno remedy, for we are told that the Prince Constantin Mavrocordato,\r\nhaving prescribed a tax on domestic animals at a time when an epidemic\r\nhad broken out amongst them, ordered the tax to be levied on the\r\ncarcasses. ‘The Administrative régime during the Phanariote period was,\r\nin general, little else than organized brigandage,’ says Xenopol[1]. In\r\nfact the Phanariote rule was instinct with corruption, luxury, and\r\nintrigue. Though individually some of them may not deserve blame, yet\r\nconsidering what the Phanariotes took out of the country, what they\r\nintroduced into it, and to what extent they prevented its development,\r\ntheir era was the most calamitous in Rumanian history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ibid, op. cit., ii. 308]\r\n\r\nThe war of 1768 between Russia and Turkey gave the former power a vague\r\nprotectorate over the Rumanian provinces (Treaty of Kutchuk Kainardji).\r\nIn 1774 Austria acquired from the Turks, by false promises, the\r\nnorthern part of Moldavia, the pleasant land of Bucovina. During the\r\nnew conflict between Turkey and Russia, the Russian armies occupied and\r\nbattened upon the Rumanian provinces for six years. Though they had\r\nagain to abandon their intention of making the Danube the southern\r\nboundary of their empire—to which Napoleon had agreed by the secret\r\ntreaty with Tsar Alexander (Erfurt, September 27, 1808)—they obtained\r\nfrom Turkey the cession of Bessarabia (Treaty of Bucarest, May 28,\r\n1812), together with that part of Moldavia lying between the Dnjester\r\nand the Pruth, the Russians afterwards giving to the whole region the\r\nname of Bessarabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n_Modern Period to 1866_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the Greek revolution, striving to create an independent Greece,\r\nbroke out on Rumanian ground, supported by the princes of Moldavia and\r\nMuntenia. Of this support the Rumanians strongly disapproved, for, if\r\nsuccessful, the movement would have strengthened the obnoxious Greek\r\ndomination; If unsuccessful, the Turks were sure to take a terrible\r\nrevenge for the assistance given by the Rumanian countries. The\r\nmovement, which was started about the same time by the ennobled\r\npeasant, Tudor Vladimirescu, for the emancipation of the lower classes,\r\nsoon acquired, therefore, an anti-Greek tendency. Vladimirescu was\r\nassassinated at the instigation of the Greeks; the latter were\r\ncompletely checked by the Turks, who, grown suspicious after the Greek\r\nrising and confronted with the energetic attitude of the Rumanian\r\nnobility, consented in 1822 to the nomination of two native boyards,\r\nJonitza Sturdza and Gregory Ghica, recommended by their countrymen, as\r\nprinces of Moldavia and Wallachia. The iniquitous system of ‘the throne\r\nto the highest bidder’ had come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe period which marks the decline of Greek influence in the Rumanian\r\nprincipalities also marks the growth of Russian influence; the first\r\nmeant economic exploitation, the second was a serious menace to the\r\nvery existence of the Rumanian nation. But if Russia seemed a possible\r\nfuture danger, Turkey with its Phanariote following was a certain and\r\nimmediate menace. When, therefore, at the outbreak of the conflict with\r\nTurkey in 1828 the Russians once more passed the Pruth, the country\r\nwelcomed them. Indeed, the Rumanian boyards, who after the rising of\r\n1821 and the Turkish occupation had taken refuge in Transylvania, had\r\neven more than once invited Russian intervention.[1] Hopes and fears\r\nalike were realized. By the Treaty of Adrianople (1829) the rights of\r\nTurkey as suzerain were limited to the exaction of a monetary tribute\r\nand the right of investiture of the princes, one important innovation\r\nbeing that these last were to be elected by national assemblies for\r\nlife. But, on the other hand, a Russian protectorate was established,\r\nand the provinces remained in Russian military occupation up to 1834,\r\npending the payment of the war indemnity by Turkey. The ultimate aim of\r\nRussia may be open to discussion. Her immediate aim was to make Russian\r\ninfluence paramount in the principalities; this being the only possible\r\nexplanation of the anomalous fact that, pending the payment of the war\r\nindemnity, Russia herself was occupying the provinces whose autonomy\r\nshe had but now forcibly retrieved from Turkey. The _Règlement\r\nOrganique_, the new constitutional law given to the principalities by\r\ntheir Russian governor, Count Kisseleff, truly reflected the tendency.\r\nFrom the administrative point of view it was meant to make for\r\nprogress; from the political point of view it was meant to bind the two\r\nprincipalities to the will of the Tsar. The personal charm of Count\r\nKisseleff seemed to have established as it were an unbreakable link\r\nbetween Russians and Rumanians. But when he left the country in 1834\r\n‘the liking for Russia passed away to be replaced finally by the two\r\nsentiments which always most swayed the Rumanian heart: love for their\r\ncountry, and affection towards France’.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sec P. Eliade, _Histoire de l’Esprit Public en Roumanie_,\r\ni, p. 167 et seq.]\r\n\r\nFrench culture had been introduced into the principalities by the\r\nPhanariote princes who, as dragomans of the Porte, had to know the\r\nlanguage, and usually employed French secretaries for themselves and\r\nFrench tutors for their children. With the Russian occupation a fresh\r\nimpetus was given to French culture, which was pre-eminent in Russia at\r\nthe time; and the Russian officials, not speaking the language of the\r\ncountry, generally employed French in their relations with the Rumanian\r\nauthorities, French being already widely spoken in Rumania. The contact\r\nwith French civilization, at an epoch when the Rumanians were striving\r\nto free themselves from Turkish, Greek, and Russian political\r\ninfluence, roused in them the sleeping Latin spirit, and the younger\r\ngeneration, in constantly increasing numbers, flocked to Paris in\r\nsearch of new forms of civilization and political life. At this\r\nturning-point in their history the Rumanians felt themselves drawn\r\ntowards France, no less by racial affinity than by the liberal ideas to\r\nwhich that country had so passionately given herself during several\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Adrianople the Black Sea was opened to the commercial\r\nvessels of all nations. This made for the rapid economic development of\r\nthe principalities by providing an outlet for their agricultural\r\nproduce, the chief source of their wealth. It also brought them nearer\r\nto western Europe, which began to be interested in a nation whose\r\nspirit centuries of sufferings had failed to break. Political,\r\nliterary, and economic events thus prepared the ground for the Rumanian\r\nRenascence, and when in 1848 the great revolution broke out, it spread\r\nat once over the Rumanian countries, where the dawn of freedom had been\r\nstruggling to break since 1821. The Rumanians of Transylvania rose\r\nagainst the tyranny of the Magyars; those of Moldavia and Muntenia\r\nagainst the oppressive influence of Russia. The movement under the\r\ngallant, but inexperienced, leadership of a few patriots, who,\r\nsignificantly enough, had almost all been educated in France, was,\r\nhowever, soon checked in the principalities by the joint action of\r\nRussian and Turkish forces which remained in occupation of the country.\r\nMany privileges were lost (Convention of Balta Liman, May 1, 1849); but\r\nthe revolution had quickened the national sentiment of the younger\r\ngeneration in all classes of society, and the expatriated leaders,\r\ndispersed throughout the great capitals of Europe, strenuously set to\r\nwork to publish abroad the righteous cause of their country. In this\r\nthey received the enthusiastic and invaluable assistance of Edgar\r\nQuinet, Michelet, Saint-Marc Girardin, and others.\r\n\r\nThis propaganda had the fortune to be contemporaneous and in agreement\r\nwith the political events leading to the Crimean War, which was entered\r\nupon to check the designs of Russia. A logical consequence was the\r\nidea, raised at the Paris Congress of 1856, of the union of the\r\nRumanian principalities as a barrier to Russian expansion. This idea\r\nfound a powerful supporter in Napoleon III, ever a staunch upholder of\r\nthe principle of nationality. But at the Congress the unexpected\r\nhappened. Russia favoured the idea of union, ‘to swallow the two\r\nprincipalities at a gulp,’ as a contemporary diplomatist maliciously\r\nsuggested; while Austria opposed it strongly. So, inconceivably enough,\r\ndid Turkey, whose attitude, as the French ambassador at Constantinople,\r\nThouvenel, put it, ‘was less influenced by the opposition of Austria\r\nthan by the approval of Russia’.[1] Great Britain also threw in her\r\nweight with the powers which opposed the idea of union, following her\r\ntraditional policy of preserving the European equilibrium. The treaty\r\nof March 30, 1856, re-incorporated with Moldavia the southern part of\r\nBessarabia, including the delta of the Danube, abolished the Russian\r\nprotectorate, but confirmed the suzerainty of Turkey—not unnaturally,\r\nsince the integrity of the Ottoman Empire had been the prime motive of\r\nthe war. By prohibiting Turkey, however, from entering Rumanian\r\nterritory, save with the consent of the great powers, it was recognized\r\nindirectly that the suzerainty was merely a nominal one. Article 23 of\r\nthe treaty, by providing that the administration of the principalities\r\nwas to be on a national basis, implicitly pointed to the idea of union,\r\nas the organization of one principality independently of the other\r\nwould not have been national. But as the main argument of Turkey and\r\nAustria was that the Rumanians themselves did not desire the union, it\r\nwas decided to convene in both principalities special assemblies\r\n(divans _ad hoc_) representing all classes of the population, whose\r\nwishes were to be embodied, by a European commission, in a report for\r\nconsideration by the Congress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A. Xenopol, _Unionistii si Separatistii_ (Paper read\r\nbefore the Rumanian Academy), 1909.]\r\n\r\nTo understand the argument of the two powers concerned and the decision\r\nto which it led, it must be borne in mind that the principalities were\r\nin the occupation of an Austrian army, which had replaced the Russian\r\narmies withdrawn in 1854, and that the elections for the assemblies\r\nwere to be presided over by Turkish commissaries. Indeed, the latter,\r\nin collaboration with the Austrian consuls, so successfully doctored\r\nthe election lists,[1] that the idea of union might once more have\r\nfallen through, had it not been for the invaluable assistance which\r\nNapoleon III gave the Rumanian countries. As Turkish policy was relying\r\nmainly on England’s support, Napoleon brought about a personal meeting\r\nwith Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, at Osborne (August 1857), the\r\nresult of which was a compromise: Napoleon agreed to defer for the time\r\nbeing the idea of an effective union of the two principalities, England\r\nundertaking, on the other hand, to make the Porte cancel the previous\r\nelections, and proceed to new ones after revision of the electoral\r\nlists. The corrupt Austrian and Turkish influence on the old elections\r\nwas best demonstrated by the fact that only three of the total of\r\neighty-four old members succeeded in securing re-election. The\r\nassemblies met and proclaimed as imperatively necessary to the future\r\nwelfare of the provinces, their union, ‘for no frontier divides us, and\r\neverything tends to bring us closer, and nothing to separate us, save\r\nthe ill-will of those who desire to see us disunited and weak’;\r\nfurther, a foreign hereditary dynasty, because ‘the accession to the\r\nthrone of princes chosen from amongst us has been a constant pretext\r\nfor foreign interference, and the throne has been the cause of unending\r\nfeud among the great families of this country’. Moreover, if the union\r\nof the two principalities was to be accomplished under a native prince,\r\nit is obvious that the competition would have become doubly keen; not\r\nto speak of the jealousies likely to be arousal between Moldavians and\r\nMuntenians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The edifying correspondence between the Porte and its\r\ncommissary Vorgoridès regarding the arrangements for the Rumanian\r\nelections fell into the hands of Rumanian politicians, and caused a\r\ngreat sensation when it appeared in _L’Etoile du Danube_, published in\r\nBrussels by Rumanian _émigrés_.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the indisputable wishes of the Rumanians, based on knowledge\r\nof men and facts, and arising out of the desire to see their country\r\nwell started on the high road of progress. But Europe had called for\r\nthe expression of these wishes only to get the question shelved for the\r\nmoment, as in 1856 everybody was anxious for a peace which should at\r\nall costs be speedy. Consequently, when a second Congress met in Paris,\r\nin May 1858, three months of discussion and the sincere efforts of\r\nFrance only resulted in a hybrid structure entitled the ‘United\r\nPrincipalities’. These were to have a common legislation, a common\r\narmy, and a central committee composed of representatives of both\r\nassemblies for the discussion of common affairs; but were to continue\r\nto form two separate states, with independent legislative and executive\r\ninstitutions, each having to elect a prince of Rumanian descent for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in their hopes and reasonable expectations, the Rumanians\r\nadopted the principle of ‘help yourself and God will help you’, and\r\nproceeded to the election of their rulers. Several candidates competed\r\nin Moldavia. To avoid a split vote the name of an outsider was put\r\nforward the day before the election, and on January 17, 1859, Colonel\r\nAlexander Ioan Cuza was unanimously elected. In Wallachia the outlook\r\nwas very uncertain when the assembly met, amid great popular\r\nexcitement, on February 5. The few patriots who had realized that the\r\npowers, seeking only their own interests, were consciously and of set\r\npurpose hampering the emancipation of a long-suffering nation, put\r\nforth and urged the election of Cuza, and the assembly unanimously\r\nadopted this spirited suggestion. By this master-stroke the Rumanians\r\nhad quietly accomplished the reform which was an indispensable\r\ncondition towards assuring a better future. The political moment was\r\npropitious. Italy’s military preparation prevented Austria from\r\nintervening, and, as usual when confronted with an accomplished fact,\r\nthe great powers and Turkey finished by officially recognizing the\r\naction of the principalities in December 1861. The central commission\r\nwas at once abolished, the two assemblies and cabinets merged into one,\r\nand Bucarest became the capital of the new state ‘Rumania’.\r\n\r\nIf the unsympathetic attitude of the powers had any good result, it was\r\nto bring home for the moment to the Rumanians the necessity for\r\nnational unity. When the danger passed, however, the wisdom which it\r\nhad evoked followed suit. Cuza cherished the hope of realizing various\r\nideal reforms. Confronted with strong opposition, he did not hesitate\r\nto override the constitution by dissolving the National Assembly (May\r\n2, 1864) and arrogating to himself the right, till the formation of a\r\nnew Chamber, to issue decrees which had all the force of law. He thus\r\ngave a dangerous example to the budding constitutional polity;\r\npolitical passions were let loose, and a plot organized by the\r\nOpposition led to the forced abdication of Cuza on February 23, 1866.\r\nThe prince left the country for ever a few days later. No disturbance\r\nwhatever took place, not one drop of blood was shed.\r\n\r\nA series of laws, mostly adapted from French models, was introduced by\r\nCuza. Under the Education Act of 1864 all degrees of education were\r\nfree, and elementary education compulsory. A large number of special\r\nand technical schools were founded, as well as two universities, one at\r\nJassy (1860) and one at Bucarest (1864). After the _coup d’état_ of\r\n1864 universal suffrage was introduced, largely as an attempt to\r\n‘swamp’ the fractious political parties with the peasant vote; while at\r\nthe same time a ‘senate’ was created as a ‘moderating assembly’ which,\r\ncomposed as it was of members by right and members nominated by the\r\nprince, by its very nature increased the influence of the crown. The\r\nchief reforms concerned the rural question. Firstly, Cuza and his\r\nminister, Cogalniceanu, secularized and converted to the state the\r\ndomains of the monasteries, which during the long period of Greek\r\ninfluence had acquired one-fifth of the total area of the land, and\r\nwere completely in the hands of the Greek clergy (Law of December 13,\r\n1863). More important still, as affecting fundamentally the social\r\nstructure of the country, was the Rural Law (promulgated on August 26,\r\n1864), which had been the cause of the conflict between Cuza and the\r\nvarious political factions, the Liberals clamouring for more thorough\r\nreforms, the Conservatives denouncing Cuza’s project as revolutionary.\r\nAs the peasant question is the most important problem left for Rumania\r\nto solve, and as I believe that, in a broad sense, it has a\r\nconsiderable bearing upon the present political situation in that\r\ncountry, it may not be out of place here to devote a little space to\r\nits consideration.\r\n\r\nOriginally the peasant lived in the village community as a free\r\nland-owner. He paid a certain due (one-tenth of his produce and three\r\ndays’ labour yearly) to his leader (_cneaz_) as recompense for his\r\nleadership in peace and war. The latter, moreover, solely enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of carrying on the occupations of miller and innkeeper, and\r\nthe peasant was compelled to mill with him. When after the foundation\r\nof the principalities the upper class was established on a feudal\r\nbasis, the peasantry were subjected to constantly increasing burdens.\r\nImpoverished and having in many cases lost their land, the peasants\r\nwere also deprived at the end of the sixteenth century of their freedom\r\nof movement. By that time the cneaz, from being the leader of the\r\ncommunity, had become the actual lord of the village, and his wealth\r\nwas estimated by the number of villages he possessed. The peasant\r\nowners paid their dues to him in labour and in kind. Those peasants who\r\nowned no land were his serfs, passing with the land from master to\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nUnder the Turkish domination the Rumanian provinces became the granary\r\nof the Ottoman Empire. The value of land rose quickly, as did also the\r\ntaxes. To meet these taxes—from the payment of which the boyards (the\r\ndescendants of the cneazi) were exempt—the peasant owners had\r\nfrequently to sacrifice their lands; while, greedy after the increased\r\nbenefits, the boyards used all possible means to acquire more land for\r\nthemselves. With the increase of their lands they needed more labour,\r\nand they obtained permission from the ruler not only to exact increased\r\nlabour dues from the peasantry, but also to determine the amount of\r\nwork that should be done in a day. This was effected in such a way that\r\nthe peasants had, in fact, to serve three and four times the number of\r\ndays due.\r\n\r\nThe power to acquire more land from the freeholders, and to increase\r\nthe amount of labour due by the peasants, was characteristic of the\r\nlegislation of the eighteenth century. By a decree of Prince Moruzi, in\r\n1805, the lords were for the first time empowered to reserve to their\r\nown use part of the estate, namely, one-fourth of the meadow land, and\r\nthis privilege was extended in 1828 to the use of one-third of the\r\narable land. The remaining two-thirds were reserved for the peasants,\r\nevery young married couple being entitled to a certain amount of land,\r\nin proportion to the number of traction animals they owned. When the\r\nTreaty of Adrianople of 1829 opened the western markets to Rumanian\r\ncorn, in which markets far higher prices were obtainable than from the\r\nTurks, Rumanian agriculture received an extraordinary impetus.\r\nHenceforth the efforts of the boyards were directed towards lessening\r\nthe amount of land to which the peasants were entitled. By the\r\n_Règlement Organique_ they succeeded in reducing such land to half its\r\nprevious area, at the same time maintaining and exacting from the\r\npeasant his dues in full. It is in the same Act that there appears for\r\nthe first time the fraudulent title ‘lords of the land’, though the\r\nboyards had no exclusive right of property; they had the use of\r\none-third of the estate, and a right to a due in labour and in kind\r\nfrom the peasant holders, present or prospective, of the other\r\ntwo-thirds.\r\n\r\nWith a view to ensuring, on the one hand, greater economic freedom to\r\nthe land-owners, and, on the other, security for the peasants from the\r\nenslaving domination of the upper class, the rural law of 1864\r\nproclaimed the peasant-tenants full proprietors of their holdings, and\r\nthe land-owners full proprietors of the remainder of the estate. The\r\noriginal intention of creating common land was not carried out in the\r\nBill. The peasant’s holding in arable land being small, he not\r\ninfrequently ploughed his pasture, and, as a consequence, had either to\r\ngive up keeping beasts, or pay a high price to the land-owners for\r\npasturage. Dues in labour and in kind were abolished, the land-owners\r\nreceiving an indemnity which was to be refunded to the state by the\r\npeasants in instalments within a period of fifteen years. This reform\r\nis characteristic of much of the legislation of Cuza: despotically\r\npursuing the realization of some ideal reform, without adequate study\r\nof and adaptation to social circumstances, his laws provided no\r\npractical solution of the problem with which they dealt. In this case,\r\nfor example, the reform benefited the upper class solely, although\r\ngenerally considered a boon to the peasantry. Of ancient right\r\ntwo-thirds of the estate were reserved for the peasants; but the new\r\nlaw gave them possession of no more than the strip they were holding,\r\nwhich barely sufficed to provide them with the mere necessaries of\r\nlife. The remainder up to two-thirds of the estate went as a gift, with\r\nfull proprietorship; to the boyard. For the exemption of their dues in\r\nkind and in labour, the peasants had to pay an indemnity, whereas the\r\nright of their sons to receive at their marriage a piece of land in\r\nproportion to the number of traction animals they possessed was lost\r\nwithout compensation. Consequently, the younger peasants had to sell\r\ntheir labour, contracting for periods of a year and upwards, and became\r\na much easier prey to the spoliation of the upper class than when they\r\nhad at least a strip of land on which to build a hut, and from which to\r\nprocure their daily bread; the more so as the country had no industry\r\nwhich could compete with agriculture in the labour market. An\r\ninvestigation undertaken by the Home Office showed that out of 1,265\r\nlabour contracts for 1906, chosen at random, only 39.7 per cent, were\r\nconcluded at customary wages; the others were lower in varying degrees,\r\n13.2 per cent. of the cases showing wages upwards of 75 per cent. below\r\nthe usual rates.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions of poverty and economic serfdom the peasantry\r\nwas not able to participate in the enormous development of Rumanian\r\nagriculture, which had resulted from increased political security and\r\nthe establishment of an extensive network of railways. While the\r\nboyards found an increasing attraction in politics, a new class of\r\nmiddlemen came into existence, renting the land from the boyards for\r\nperiods varying generally from three to five years. Owing to the\r\nresultant competition, rents increased considerably, while conservative\r\nmethods of cultivation kept production stationary. Whereas the big\r\ncultivator obtained higher prices to balance the increased cost of\r\nproduction, the peasant, who produced for his own consumption, could\r\nonly face such increase by a corresponding decrease in the amount of\r\nfood consumed. To show how much alive the rural question is, it is\r\nenough to state that peasant risings occurred in 1888, 1889, 1894,\r\n1900, and 1907; that new distributions of land took place in 1881 and\r\n1889; that land was promised to the peasants as well at the time of the\r\ncampaign of 1877 as at that of 1913; and that more or less happily\r\nconceived measures concerning rural questions have been passed in\r\nalmost every parliamentary session. The general tendency of such\r\nlegislation partook of the ‘free contract’ nature, though owing to the\r\nsocial condition of the peasantry the acts in question had to embody\r\nprotective measures providing for a maximum rent for arable and pasture\r\nland, and a minimum wage for the peasant labourer.\r\n\r\nSolutions have been suggested in profusion. That a solution is possible\r\nno one can doubt. One writer, basing his arguments on official\r\nstatistics which show that the days of employment in 1905 averaged only\r\nninety-one for each peasant, claims that only the introduction of\r\ncirculating capital and the creation of new branches of activity can\r\nbring about a change. The suggested remedy may be open to discussion;\r\nbut our author is undoubtedly right when, asking himself why this\r\nsolution has not yet been attempted, he says: ‘Our country is governed\r\nat present by an agrarian class…. Her whole power rests in her\r\nownership of the land, our only wealth. The introduction of circulating\r\ncapital would result in the disintegration of that wealth, in the loss\r\nof its unique quality, and, as a consequence, in the social decline of\r\nits possessors.’[1] This is the fundamental evil which prevents any\r\nsolution of the rural question. A small class of politicians, with the\r\ncomplicity of a large army of covetous and unscrupulous officials, live\r\nin oriental indolence out of the sufferings of four-fifths of the\r\nRumanian nation. Though elementary education is compulsory, more than\r\n60 per cent. of the population are still illiterate, mainly on account\r\nof the inadequacy of the educational budget. Justice is a myth for the\r\npeasant. Of political rights he is, in fact, absolutely deprived. The\r\nlarge majority, and by far the sanest part of the Rumanian nation, are\r\nthus fraudulently kept outside the political and social life of the\r\ncountry. It is not surmising too much, therefore, to say that the\r\nopportunity of emancipating the Transylvanians would not have been\r\nwilfully neglected, had that part of the Rumanian nation in which the\r\nold spirit still survives had any choice in the determination of their\r\nown fate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: St. Antim, _Cbestiunea Socială în România,_ 1908, p. 214.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n_Contemporary Period: Internal Development_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to obviate internal disturbances or external interference, the\r\nleaders of the movement which had dethroned Prince Cuza caused\r\nparliament to proclaim, on the day of Cuza’s abdication, Count Philip\r\nof Flanders— the father of King Albert of Belgium—Prince of Rumania.\r\nThe offer was, however, not accepted, as neither France nor Russia\r\nfavoured the proposal. Meanwhile a conference had met again in Paris at\r\nthe instance of Turkey and vetoed the election of a foreign prince. But\r\nevents of deeper importance were ripening in Europe, and the Rumanian\r\npoliticians rightly surmised that the powers would not enforce their\r\nprotests if a candidate were found who was likely to secure the support\r\nof Napoleon III, then ‘schoolmaster’ of European diplomacy. This\r\ncandidate was found in the person of Prince Carol of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen, second son of the head of the elder branch of\r\nthe Hohenzollerns (Catholic and non-reigning). Prince Carol was cousin\r\nto the King of Prussia, and related through his grandmother to the\r\nBonaparte family. He could consequently count upon the support of\r\nFrance and Prussia, while the political situation fortunately secured\r\nhim from the opposition of Russia, whose relations with Prussia were at\r\nthe time friendly, and also from that of Austria, whom Bismarck\r\nproposed to ‘keep busy for some time to come’. The latter must have\r\nviewed with no little satisfaction the prospect of a Hohenzollern\r\noccupying the throne of Rumania at this juncture; and Prince Carol,\r\nallowing himself to be influenced by the Iron Chancellor’s advice,\r\nanswered the call of the Rumanian nation, which had proclaimed him as\r\n‘Carol I, Hereditary Prince of Rumania’. Travelling secretly with a\r\nsmall retinue, the prince second class, his suite first, Prince Carol\r\ndescended the Danube on an Austrian steamer, and landed on May 8 at\r\nTurnu-Severin, the very place where, nearly eighteen centuries before,\r\nthe Emperor Trajan had alighted and founded the Rumanian nation.\r\n\r\nBy independent and energetic action, by a conscious neglect of the will\r\nof the powers, which only a young constitutional polity would have\r\ndared, by an active and unselfish patriotism, Rumania had at last\r\nchosen and secured as her ruler the foreign prince who alone had a\r\nchance of putting a stop to intrigues from within and from without. And\r\nthe Rumanians had been extremely fortunate in their hasty and not quite\r\nindependent choice. A prince of Latin origin would probably have been\r\nmore warmly welcomed to the hearts of the Rumanian people; but after so\r\nmany years of political disorder, corrupt administration, and arbitrary\r\nrule, a prince possessed of the German spirit of discipline and order\r\nwas best fitted to command respect and impose obedience and sobriety of\r\nprinciple upon the Rumanian politicians.\r\n\r\nPrince Carol’s task was no easy one. The journal compiled by the\r\nprovisional government, which held the reins for the period elapsing\r\nbetween the abdication of Cuza and the accession of Prince Carol,\r\ndepicts in the darkest colours the economic situation to which the\r\nfaults, the waste, the negligence, and short-sightedness of the\r\nprevious régime had reduced the country, ‘the government being in the\r\nhumiliating position of having brought disastrous and intolerable\r\nhardship alike upon its creditors, its servants, its pensioners, and\r\nits soldiers’.[1] Reforms were badly needed, and the treasury had\r\nnothing in hand but debts. To increase the income of the state was\r\ndifficult, for the country was poor and not economically independent.\r\nUnder the Paris Convention of 1858, Rumania remained bound, to her\r\ndetriment, by the commercial treaties of her suzerain, Turkey, the\r\npowers not being willing to lose the privileges they enjoyed under the\r\nTurkish capitulations. Moreover, she was specially excluded from the\r\narrangement of 1860, which allowed Turkey to increase her import taxes.\r\nThe inheritance of ultra-liberal measures from the previous regime made\r\nit difficult to cope with the unruly spirit of the nation. Any attempt\r\nat change in this direction would have savoured of despotism to the\r\npeople, who, having at last won the right to speak aloud, believed that\r\nto clamour against anything that meant ‘rule’ was the only real and\r\nfull assertion of liberty. And the dissatisfied were always certain of\r\nfinding a sympathetic ear and an open purse in the Chancellories of\r\nVienna and St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: D.A. Sturdza, _Treizeci de ani de Domnie ai Regelui\r\nCarol,_ 1900, i.82.]\r\n\r\nPrince Carol, not being sufficiently well acquainted with the\r\nconditions of the country nor possessing as yet much influence with the\r\ngoverning class, had not been in a position to influence at their\r\ninception the provisions of the extremely liberal constitution passed\r\nonly a few weeks after his accession to the throne. The new\r\nconstitution, which resembled that of Belgium more nearly than any\r\nother, was framed by a constituent assembly elected on universal\r\nsuffrage, and, except for slight modifications introduced in 1879 and\r\n1884, is in vigour to-day. It entrusts the executive to the king and\r\nhis ministers, the latter alone being responsible for the acts of the\r\ngovernment.[1] The legislative power is vested in the king and two\r\nassemblies—a senate and a chamber—the initiative resting with any one\r\nof the three.[2] The budget and the yearly bills fixing the strength of\r\nthe army, however, must first be passed by the Chamber. The agreement\r\nof the two Chambers and the sanction of the king are necessary before\r\nany bill becomes law. The king convenes, adjourns, and dissolves\r\nparliament. He promulgates the laws and is invested with the right of\r\nabsolute veto. The constitution proclaims the inviolability of\r\ndomicile, the liberty of the press and of assembly, and absolute\r\nliberty of creed and religion, in so far as its forms of celebration do\r\nnot come into conflict with public order and decency. It recognizes no\r\ndistinction of class and privilege; all the citizens share equally\r\nrights and duties within the law. Education is free in the state\r\nschools, and elementary education compulsory wherever state schools\r\nexist. Individual liberty and property are guaranteed; but only\r\nRumanian citizens can acquire rural property. Military service is\r\ncompulsory, entailing two years in the infantry, three years in the\r\ncavalry and artillery, one year in all arms for those having completed\r\ntheir studies as far as the university stage. Capital punishment does\r\nnot exist, except for military offences in time of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are at present nine departments: Interior, Foreign\r\nAffairs, Finance, War, Education and Religion, Domains and Agriculture,\r\nPublic Works, Justice, and Industry and Commerce. The President of the\r\nCabinet is Prime Minister, with or without portfolio.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: All citizens of full age paying taxes, with various\r\nexemptions, are electors, voting according to districts and census. In\r\nthe case of the illiterate country inhabitants, with an income from\r\nland of less than £12 a year, fifty of them choose one delegate having\r\none vote in the parliamentary election. The professorial council of the\r\ntwo universities of Jassy and Bucarest send one member each to the\r\nSenate, the heir to the throne and the eight bishops being members by\r\nright.]\r\n\r\nThe state religion is Greek Orthodox. Up to 1864 the Rumanian Church\r\nwas subordinate to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In that year it\r\nwas proclaimed independent, national, and autocephalous, though this\r\nchange was not recognized by the Patriarchate till 1885, while the\r\nsecularization of the property of the monasteries put an end _de facto_\r\nto the influence of the Greek clergy. Religious questions of a dogmatic\r\nnature are settled by the Holy Synod of Bucarest, composed of the two\r\nmetropolitans of Bucarest and Jassy and the eight bishops; the Minister\r\nfor Education, with whom the administrative part of the Church rests,\r\nhaving only a deliberative vote. The maintenance of the Church and of\r\nthe clergy is included in the general budget of the country, the\r\nministers being state officials (Law of 1893).\r\n\r\nReligion has never played an important part in Rumanian national life,\r\nand was generally limited to merely external practices. This may be\r\nattributed largely to the fact that as the Slavonic language had been\r\nused in the Church since the ninth century and then was superseded by\r\nGreek up to the nineteenth century, the clergy was foreign, and was\r\nneither in a position nor did it endeavour to acquire a spiritual\r\ninfluence over the Rumanian peasant. There is no record whatever in\r\nRumanian history of any religious feuds or dissensions. The religious\r\npassivity remained unstirred even during the domination of the Turks,\r\nwho contented themselves with treating the unbelievers with contempt,\r\nand squeezing as much money as possible out of them. Cuza having made\r\nno provision for the clergy when he converted the wealth of the\r\nmonasteries to the state, they were left for thirty years in complete\r\ndestitution, and remained as a consequence outside the general\r\nintellectual development of the country. Though the situation has much\r\nimproved since the Law of 1893, which incorporated the priests with the\r\nother officials of the Government, the clergy, recruited largely from\r\namong the rural population, are still greatly inferior to the Rumanian\r\npriests of Bucovina and Transylvania. Most of them take up Holy orders\r\nas a profession: ‘I have known several country parsons who were\r\nthorough atheists.’[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: R. Rosetti, _Pentru ce s-au răsculat țăranii_, 1907, p.\r\n600]\r\n\r\nHowever difficult his task, Prince Carol never deviated from the\r\nstrictly constitutional path: his opponents were free to condemn the\r\nprince’s opinions; he never gave them the chance of questioning his\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nPrince Carol relied upon the position in which his origin and family\r\nalliances placed him in his relations with foreign rulers to secure him\r\nthe respect of his new subjects. Such considerations impressed the\r\nRumanians. Nor could they fail to be aware of ‘the differences between\r\nthe previously elected princes and the present dynasty, and the\r\nimproved position which the country owed to the latter’.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Augenzeuge, _Aus dem Leben König Karls von Rumănien,\r\n1894-1900,_ iii. 177.]\r\n\r\nTo inculcate the Rumanians with the spirit of discipline the prince\r\ntook in hand with energy and pursued untiringly, in spite of all\r\nobstacles, the organization of the army. A reliable and well-organized\r\narmed force was the best security against internal trouble-mongers, and\r\nthe best argument in international relations, as subsequent events\r\namply proved.\r\n\r\nThe Rumanian political parties were at the outset personal parties,\r\nsupporting one or other of the candidates to the throne. When Greek\r\ninfluence, emanating from Constantinople, began to make itself felt, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, a national party arose for the purpose of\r\nopposing it. This party counted upon the support of one of the\r\nneighbouring powers, and its various groups were known accordingly as\r\nthe Austrian, the Russian, &c., parties. With the election of Cuza the\r\nexternal danger diminished, and the politicians divided upon principles\r\nof internal reform. Cuza not being in agreement with either party, they\r\nunited to depose him, keeping truce during the period preceding the\r\naccession of Prince Carol, when grave external dangers wore\r\nthreatening, and presiding in a coalition ministry at the introduction\r\nof the new constitution of 1866. But this done, the truce was broken.\r\nPolitical strife again awoke with all the more vigour for having been\r\ntemporarily suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe reforms which it became needful to introduce gave opportunity for\r\nthe development of strong divergence of views between the political\r\nparties. The Liberals—the Red Party, as they were called at the\r\ntime—(led by C.A. Rosetti and Ioan Bratianu, both strong Mazzinists,\r\nboth having taken an important part in the revolutionary movements of\r\n1848 and in that which led to the deposition of Cuza) were advocating\r\nreforms hardly practicable even in an established democracy; the\r\nConservatives (led by Lascar Catargiu) were striving to stem the flood\r\nof ideal liberal measures on which all sense of reality was being\r\ncarried away.[1] In little more than a year there were four different\r\nCabinets, not to mention numerous changes in individual ministers.\r\n‘Between the two extreme tendencies Prince Carol had to strive\r\nconstantly to preserve unity of direction, he himself being the only\r\nstable element in that ever unstable country.’ It was not without many\r\nuntoward incidents that he succeeded. His person was the subject of\r\nmore than one unscrupulous attack by politicians in opposition, who did\r\nnot hesitate to exploit the German origin and the German sympathies of\r\nthe prince in order to inflame the masses. These internal conflicts\r\nentered upon an acute phase at the time of the Franco-German conflict\r\nof 1870. Whilst, to satisfy public opinion, the Foreign Secretary of\r\nthe time, M.P.P. Carp, had to declare in parliament, that ‘wherever the\r\ncolours of France are waving, there are our interests and sympathies’,\r\nthe prince wrote to the King of Prussia assuring him that ‘his\r\nsympathies will always be where the black and white banner is waving’.\r\nIn these so strained circumstances a section of the population of\r\nBucarest allowed itself to be drawn into anti-German street riots.\r\nDisheartened and despairing of ever being able to do anything for that\r\n‘beautiful country’, whose people ‘neither know how to govern\r\nthemselves nor will allow themselves to be governed’, the prince\r\ndecided to abdicate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A few years ago a group of politicians, mainly of the old\r\nConservative party, detached themselves and became the\r\nConservative-Democratic party under the leadership of M. Take Ionescu.]\r\n\r\nSo strong was the feeling in parliament roused by the prince’s decision\r\nthat one of his most inveterate opponents now declared that it would be\r\nan act of high treason for the prince to desert the country at such a\r\ncrisis. We have an inkling of what might have resulted in the letter\r\nwritten by the Emperor of Austria to Prince Carol at the time, assuring\r\nhim that ‘my Government will eagerly seize any opportunity which\r\npresents itself to prove by deeds the interest it takes in a country\r\nconnected by so many bonds to my empire’. Nothing but the efforts of\r\nLascar Catargiu and the sound patriotism of a few statesmen saved the\r\ncountry from what would have been a real misfortune. The people were\r\nwell aware of this, and cheers lasting several minutes greeted that\r\nportion of the message from the throne which conveyed to the new\r\nparliament the decision of the prince to continue reigning.\r\n\r\nThe situation was considerably strengthened during a period of five\r\nyears’ Conservative rule. Prince Carol’s high principles and the\r\ndignified example of his private life secured for him the increasing\r\nrespect of politicians of all colours; while his statesmanlike\r\nqualities, his patience and perseverance, soon procured him an\r\nunlimited influence in the affairs of the state. This was made the more\r\npossible from the fact that, on account of the political ignorance of\r\nthe masses, and of the varied influence exercised on the electorate by\r\nthe highly centralized administration, no Rumanian Government ever\r\nfails to obtain a majority at an election. Any statesman can undertake\r\nto form a Cabinet if the king assents to a dissolution of parliament.\r\nBetween the German system, where the emperor chooses the ministers\r\nindependently of parliament, and the English system, where the members\r\nof the executive are indicated by the electorate through the medium of\r\nparliament, independently of the Crown, the Rumanian system takes a\r\nmiddle path. Neither the crown, nor the electorate, nor parliament\r\npossesses exclusive power in this direction. The Government is not,\r\ngenerally speaking, defeated either by the electorate or by parliament.\r\nIt is the Crown which has the final decision in the changes of régime,\r\nand upon the king falls the delicate task of interpreting the\r\nsignificance of political or popular movements. The system—which comes\r\nnearest to that of Spain—undoubtedly has its advantages in a young and\r\nturbulent polity, by enabling its most stable element, the king, to\r\nensure a continuous and harmonious policy. But it also makes the\r\nresults dangerously dependent on the quality of that same element.\r\nUnder the leadership of King Carol it was an undoubted success; the\r\nprogress made by the country from an economic, financial, and military\r\npoint of view during the last half-century is really enormous. Its\r\nposition was furthermore strengthened by the proclamation of its\r\nindependence, by the final settlement of the dynastic question,[1] and\r\nby its elevation on May 10, 1881, to the rank of kingdom, when upon the\r\nhead of the first King of Rumania was placed a crown of steel made from\r\none of the guns captured before Plevna from an enemy centuries old.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the absence of direct descendants and according to the\r\nconstitution, Prince Ferdinand (born 1865), second son of King Carol’s\r\nelder brother, was named Heir Apparent to the Rumanian throne. He\r\nmarried in 1892 Princess Marie of Coburg, and following the death of\r\nKing Carol in 1914, he acceded to the throne as Ferdinand I.]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of internal politics progress has been less\r\nsatisfactory. The various reforms once achieved, the differences of\r\nprinciple between the political parties degenerated into mere\r\nopportunism, the Opposition opposing, the Government disposing. The\r\nparties, and especially the various groups within the parties, are\r\ngenerally known by the names of their leaders, these denominations not\r\nimplying any definite political principle or Government programme. It\r\nis, moreover, far from edifying that the personal element should so\r\nfrequently distort political discussion. ‘The introduction of modern\r\nforms of state organization has not been followed by the\r\ndemocratization of all social institutions…. The masses of the people\r\nhave remained all but completely outside political life. Not only are\r\nwe yet far from government of the people by the people, but our\r\nliberties, though deeply graven on the facade of our constitution, have\r\nnot permeated everyday life nor even stirred in the consciousness of\r\nthe people.’[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: C. Stere, _Social-democratizm sau Poporanizm_, Jassy.]\r\n\r\nIt is strange that King Carol, who had the welfare of the people\r\nsincerely at heart, should not have used his influence to bring about a\r\nsolution of the rural question; but this may perhaps be explained by\r\nthe fact that, from Cuza’s experience, he anticipated opposition from\r\nall political factions. It would almost seem as if, by a tacit\r\nunderstanding, and anxious to establish Rumania’s international\r\nposition, King Carol gave his ministers a free hand in the rural\r\nquestion, reserving for himself an equally free hand in foreign\r\naffairs. This seems borne out by the fact that, in the four volumes in\r\nwhich an ‘eyewitness’, making use of the king’s private correspondence\r\nand personal notes, has minutely described the first fifteen years of\r\nthe reign, the peasant question is entirely ignored.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The ‘eyewitness’ was Dr. Schaeffer, formerly tutor to\r\nPrince Carol.]\r\n\r\nAddressing himself, in 1871, to the Rumanian representative at the\r\nPorte, the Austrian ambassador, von Prokesch-Osten, remarked: ‘If\r\nPrince Carol manages to pull through without outside help, and make\r\nRumania governable, it will be the greatest _tour de force_ I have ever\r\nwitnessed in my diplomatic career of more than half a century. It will\r\nbe nothing less than a conjuring trick.’ King Carol succeeded; and only\r\nthose acquainted with Rumanian affairs can appreciate the truth of the\r\nambassador’s words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n_Contemporary Period: Foreign Affairs_\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to 1866 Rumanian foreign politics may be said to have been\r\nnon-existent. The offensive or defensive alliances against the Turks\r\nconcluded by the Rumanian rulers with neighbouring princes during the\r\nMiddle Ages were not made in pursuance of any definite policy, but\r\nmerely to meet the moment’s need. With the establishment of Turkish\r\nsuzerainty Rumania became a pawn in the foreign politics of the\r\nneighbouring empires, and we find her repeatedly included in their\r\nprojects of acquisition, partition, or compensation (as, for instance,\r\nwhen she was put forward as eventual compensation to Poland for the\r\nterritories lost by that country in the first partition).[1] Rumania\r\nmay be considered fortunate in not having lost more than Bucovina to\r\nAustria (1775), Bessarabia to Russia (1812), and, temporarily, to\r\nAustria the region between the Danube and the Aluta, called Oltenia\r\n(lost by the Treaty of Passarowitz, 1718; recovered by the Treaty of\r\nBelgrade, 1739).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Albert Sorel, _The Eastern Question in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury_ (Engl. ed.), 1898, pp. 141, 147 &c.]\r\n\r\nWhile her geographical position made of Rumania the cynosure of many\r\ncovetous eyes, it at the same time saved her from individual attack by\r\nexciting countervailing jealousies. Moreover, the powers came at last\r\nto consider her a necessary rampart to the Ottoman Empire, whose\r\ndissolution all desired but none dared attempt. Austria and Russia,\r\nlooking to the future, were continually competing for paramount\r\ninfluence in Rumania, though it is not possible to determine where\r\ntheir policy of acquisition ended and that of influence began.\r\n\r\nThe position of the principalities became more secure after the Paris\r\nCongress of 1858, which placed them under the collective guarantee of\r\nthe great powers; but this fact, and the maintenance of Turkish\r\nsuzerainty, coupled with their own weakness, debarred them from any\r\nindependence in their foreign relations.\r\n\r\nA sudden change took place with the accession of Prince Carol; a\r\nHohenzollern prince related to the King of Prussia and to Napoleon III\r\ncould not be treated like one of the native boyards. The situation\r\ncalled for the more delicacy of treatment by the powers in view of the\r\npossibility of his being able to better those internal conditions which\r\nmade Rumania ‘uninteresting’ as a factor in international politics. In\r\nfact, the prince’s personality assured for Rumania a status which she\r\ncould otherwise have attained only with time, by a political, economic,\r\nand military consolidation of her home affairs; and the prince does not\r\nfail to remark in his notes that the attentions lavished upon him by\r\nother sovereigns were meant rather for the Hohenzollern prince than for\r\nthe Prince of Rumania. Many years later even, after the war of 1878,\r\nwhile the Russians were still south of the Danube with their lines of\r\ncommunication running through Rumania, Bratianu begged of the prince to\r\ngive up a projected journey on account of the difficulties which might\r\nat any moment arise, and said: ‘Only the presence of your Royal\r\nHighness keeps them [the Russians] at a respectful distance.’ It was\r\nbut natural under these circumstances that the conduct of foreign\r\naffairs should have devolved almost exclusively on the prince. The\r\nascendancy which his high personal character, his political and\r\ndiplomatic skill, his military capacity procured for him over the\r\nRumanian statesmen made this situation a lasting one; indeed it became\r\nalmost a tradition. Rumania’s foreign policy since 1866 may be said,\r\ntherefore, to have been King Carol’s policy. Whether one agrees with it\r\nor not, no one can deny with any sincerity that it was inspired by the\r\ninterests of the country, as the monarch saw them. Rebuking Bismarck’s\r\nunfair attitude towards Rumania in a question concerning German\r\ninvestors, Prince Carol writes to his father in 1875: ‘I have to put\r\nRumania’s interests above those of Germany. My path is plainly mapped\r\nout, and I must follow It unflinchingly, whatever the weather.’\r\n\r\nPrince Carol was a thorough German, and as such naturally favoured the\r\nexpansion of German influence among his new subjects. But if he desired\r\nRumania to follow in the wake of German foreign policy, it was because\r\nof his unshaken faith in the future of his native country, because he\r\nconsidered that Rumania had nothing to fear from Germany, whilst it was\r\nall in the interest of that country to see Rumania strong and firmly\r\nestablished. At the same time, acting on the advice of Bismarck, he did\r\nnot fail to work toward a better understanding with Russia, ‘who might\r\nbecome as well a reliable friend as a dangerous enemy to the Rumanian\r\nstate’. The sympathy shown him by Napoleon III was not always shared by\r\nthe French statesmen,[1] and the unfriendly attitude of the French\r\nambassador in Constantinople caused Prince Carol to remark that ‘M. de\r\nMoustier is considered a better Turk than the Grand Turk himself’.\r\nUnder the circumstances a possible alliance between France and Russia,\r\ngiving the latter a free hand in the Near East, would have proved a\r\ngrave danger to Rumania; ‘it was, consequently, a skilful, if imperious\r\nact, to enter voluntarily, and without detriment to the existing\r\nfriendly relations with France, within the Russian sphere of influence,\r\nand not to wait till compelled to do so.’\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _Revue des Deux Mondes_, June 15, 1866, article by\r\nEugène Forcade.]\r\n\r\nThe campaigns of 1866 and 1870 having finally established Prussia’s\r\nsupremacy in the German world, Bismarck modified his attitude towards\r\nAustria. In an interview with the Austrian Foreign Secretary, Count\r\nBeust (Gastein, October 1871), he broached for the first time the\r\nquestion of an alliance and, touching upon the eventual dissolution of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, ‘obligingly remarked that one could not conceive of\r\na great power not making of its faculty for expansion a vital\r\nquestion’.[2] Quite in keeping with that change were the counsels\r\nhenceforth tendered to Prince Carol. Early that year Bismarck wrote of\r\nhis sorrow at having been forced to the conclusion that Rumania had\r\nnothing to expect from Russia, while Prince Anthony, Prince Carol’s\r\nfather and faithful adviser, wrote soon after the above interview\r\n(November 1871), that ‘under certain circumstances it would seem a\r\nsound policy for Rumania to rely upon the support of Austria’.\r\nPersevering in this crescendo of suggestion, Austria’s new foreign\r\nsecretary, Count Andrassy, drifted at length to the point by plainly\r\ndeclaring not long afterwards that ‘Rumania is not so unimportant that\r\none should deprecate an alliance with her’.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Gabriel Hanotaux, _La Guerre des Balkans et l’Europe_\r\n(Beust, Mémoires), Paris, 1914, p. 297.]\r\n\r\nPrince Carol had accepted the throne with the firm intention of shaking\r\noff the Turkish suzerainty at the first opportunity, and not\r\nunnaturally he counted upon Germany’s support to that end. He and his\r\ncountry were bitterly disappointed, therefore, when Bismarck appealed\r\ndirectly to the Porte for the settlement of a difference between the\r\nRumanian Government and a German company entrusted with the\r\nconstruction of the Rumanian railways; the more so as the Paris\r\nConvention had expressly forbidden any Turkish interference in\r\nRumania’s internal affairs. It thus became increasingly evident that\r\nRumania could not break away from Russia, the coming power in the East.\r\nThe eyes of Russia were steadfastly fixed on Constantinople: by joining\r\nher, Rumania had the best chance of gaining her independence; by not\r\ndoing so, she ran the risk of being trodden upon by Russia on her way\r\nto Byzantium. But though resolved to co-operate with Russia in any\r\neventual action in the Balkans, Prince Carol skilfully avoided\r\ndelivering himself blindfold into her hands by deliberately cutting\r\nhimself away from the other guaranteeing powers. To the conference\r\nwhich met in Constantinople at the end of 1876 to settle Balkan affairs\r\nhe addressed the demand that ‘should war break out between one of the\r\nguaranteeing powers and Turkey, Rumania’s line of conduct should be\r\ndictated, and her neutrality and rights guaranteed, by the other\r\npowers’. This _démarche_ failed. The powers had accepted the invitation\r\nto the conference as one accepts an invitation to visit a dying man.\r\nNobody had any illusions on the possibility of averting war, least of\r\nall the two powers principally interested. In November 1876 Ali Bey and\r\nM. de Nelidov arrived simultaneously and secretly in Bucarest to sound\r\nRumania as to an arrangement with their respective countries, Turkey\r\nand Russia. In opposition to his father and Count Andrassy, who\r\ncounselled neutrality and the withdrawal of the Rumanian army into the\r\nmountains, and in sympathy with Bismarck’s advice, Prince Carol\r\nconcluded a Convention with Russia on April 16, 1877. Rumania promised\r\nto the Russian army ‘free passage through Rumanian territory and the\r\ntreatment due to a friendly army’; whilst Russia undertook to respect\r\nRumania’s political rights, as well as ‘to maintain and defend her\r\nactual integrity’. ‘It is pretty certain’, wrote Prince Carol to his\r\nfather, ‘that this will not be to the liking of most of the great\r\npowers; but as they neither can nor will offer us anything, we cannot\r\ndo otherwise than pass them by. A successful Russian campaign will free\r\nus from the nominal dependency upon Turkey, and Europe will never allow\r\nRussia to take her place.’\r\n\r\nOn April 23 the Russian armies passed the Pruth. An offer of active\r\nparticipation by the Rumanian forces in the forthcoming campaign was\r\nrejected by the Tsar, who haughtily declared that ‘Russia had no need\r\nfor the cooperation of the Rumanian army’, and that ‘it was only under\r\nthe auspices of the Russian forces that the foundation of Rumania’s\r\nfuture destinies could be laid’. Rumania was to keep quiet and accept\r\nin the end what Russia would deign to give her, or, to be more correct,\r\ntake from her. After a few successful encounters, however, the Tsar’s\r\nsoldiers met with serious defeats before Plevna, and persistent appeals\r\nwere now urged for the participation of the Rumanian army in the\r\nmilitary operations. The moment had come for Rumania to bargain for her\r\ninterests. But Prince Carol refused to make capital out of the serious\r\nposition of the Russians; he led his army across the Danube and, at the\r\nexpress desire of the Tsar, took over the supreme command of the united\r\nforces before Plevna. After a glorious but terrible struggle Plevna,\r\nfollowed at short intervals by other strongholds, fell, the peace\r\npreliminaries were signed, and Prince Carol returned to Bucarest at the\r\nhead of his victorious army.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the flattering words in which the Tsar spoke of the\r\nRumanian share in the success of the campaign, Russia did not admit\r\nRumania to the Peace Conference. By the Treaty of San Stefano (March\r\n3,1878) Rumania’s independence was recognized; Russia obtained from\r\nTurkey the Dobrudja and the delta of the Danube, reserving for herself\r\nthe right to exchange these territories against the three southern\r\ndistricts of Bessarabia, restored to Rumania by the Treaty of Paris,\r\n1856. This stipulation was by no means a surprise to Rumania, Russia’s\r\nintention to recover Bessarabia was well known to the Government, who\r\nhoped, however, that the demand would not be pressed after the\r\neffective assistance rendered by the Rumanian army. ‘If this be not a\r\nground for the extension of our territory, it is surely none for its\r\ndiminution,’ remarked Cogalniceanu at the Berlin Congress. Moreover,\r\nbesides the promises of the Tsar, there was the Convention of the\r\nprevious year, which, in exchange for nothing more than free passage\r\nfor the Russian armies, guaranteed Rumania’s integrity. But upon this\r\nstipulation Gorchakov put the jesuitical construction that, the\r\nConvention being concluded in view of a war to be waged against Turkey,\r\nit was only against Turkey that Russia undertook to guarantee Rumania’s\r\nintegrity; as to herself, she was not in the least bound by that\r\narrangement. And should Rumania dare to protest against, or oppose the\r\naction of the Russian Government, ‘the Tsar will order that Rumania be\r\noccupied and the Rumanian army disarmed’. ‘The army which fought at\r\nPlevna’, replied Prince Carol through his minister, ‘may well be\r\ndestroyed, but never disarmed.’\r\n\r\nThere was one last hope left to Rumania: that the Congress which met in\r\nBerlin in June 1878 for the purpose of revising the Treaty of San\r\nStefano, would prevent such an injustice. But Bismarck was anxious that\r\nno ‘sentiment de dignité blessée’ should rankle in Russia’s future\r\npolicy; the French representative, Waddington, was ‘above all a\r\npractical man’; Corti, the Italian delegate, was ‘nearly rude’ to the\r\nRumanian delegates; while Lord Beaconsfield, England’s envoy, receiving\r\nthe Rumanian delegates privately, had nothing to say but that ‘in\r\npolitics the best services are often rewarded with ingratitude’. Russia\r\nstrongly opposed even the idea that the Rumanian delegates should be\r\nallowed to put their case before the Congress, and consent was obtained\r\nonly with difficulty after Lord Salisbury had ironically remarked that\r\n‘having heard the representatives of Greece, which was claiming foreign\r\nprovinces, it would be but fair to listen also to the representatives\r\nof a country which was only seeking to retain what was its own’.\r\nShortly before, Lord Salisbury, speaking in London to the Rumanian\r\nspecial envoy, Callimaki Catargiu, had assured him of England’s\r\nsympathy and of her effective assistance in case either of war or of a\r\nCongress. ‘But to be quite candid he must add that there are questions\r\nof more concern to England, and should she be able to come to an\r\nunderstanding with Russia with regard to them, she would not wage war\r\nfor the sake of Rumania.’ Indeed, an understanding came about, and an\r\nindiscretion enabled the _Globe_ to make its tenor public early in June\r\n1878. ‘The Government of her Britannic Majesty’, it said, ‘considers\r\nthat it will feel itself bound to express its deep regret should Russia\r\npersist in demanding the retrocession of Bessarabia…. England’s\r\ninterest in this question is not such, however, as to justify her\r\ntaking upon herself alone the responsibility of opposing the intended\r\nexchange.’ So Bessarabia was lost, Rumania receiving instead Dobrudja\r\nwith the delta of the Danube. But as the newly created state of\r\nBulgaria was at the time little else than a detached Russian province,\r\nRussia, alone amongst the powers, opposed and succeeded in preventing\r\nthe demarcation to the new Rumanian province of a strategically sound\r\nfrontier. Finally, to the exasperation of the Rumanians, the Congress\r\nmade the recognition of Rumania’s independence contingent upon the\r\nabolition of Article 7 of the Constitution—which denied to\r\nnon-Christians the right of becoming Rumanian citizens—and the\r\nemancipation of the Rumanian Jews.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rumania only partially gave way to this intrusion of the\r\npowers into her internal affairs. The prohibition was abolished; but\r\nonly individual naturalization was made possible, and that by special\r\nAct of Parliament. Only a very small proportion of the Jewish\r\npopulation has since been naturalized. The Jewish question in Rumania\r\nis undoubtedly a very serious one; but the matter is too controversial\r\nto be dealt with in a few lines without risking misrepresentation or\r\ndoing an injustice to one or other of the parties. For which reason it\r\nhas not been included in this essay.]\r\n\r\nIt was only after innumerable difficulties and hardships that, at the\r\nbeginning of 1880, Rumania secured recognition of an independence which\r\nshe owed to nobody but herself. Whilst Russia was opposing Rumania at\r\nevery opportunity in the European conferences and commissions, she was\r\nat pains to show herself more amenable in _tête-à-tête_, and approached\r\nRumania with favourable proposals. ‘Rather Russia as foe than\r\nguardian,’ wrote Prince Carol to his father; and these words indicate\r\nan important turning-point in Rumania’s foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIn wresting Bessarabia from Rumania merely as a sop to her own pride,\r\nand to make an end of all that was enacted by the Treaty of Paris,\r\n1856, Russia made a serious political blunder. By insisting that\r\nAustria should share in the partition of Poland, Frederick the Great\r\nhad skilfully prevented her from remaining the one country towards\r\nwhich the Poles would naturally have turned for deliverance. Such an\r\nopportunity was lost by Russia through her short-sighted policy in\r\nBessarabia—that of remaining the natural ally of Rumania against\r\nRumania’s natural foe, Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nRumania had neither historical, geographical, nor any important\r\nethnographical points of contact with the region south of the Danube;\r\nthe aims of a future policy could only have embraced neighbouring\r\ntracts of foreign territory inhabited by Rumanians. Whereas up to the\r\ndate of the Berlin Congress such tracts were confined to\r\nAustria-Hungary, by that Congress a similar sphere of attraction for\r\nRumanian aspirations was created in Russia.[1] The interests of a\r\npeaceful development demanded that Rumania should maintain friendly\r\nrelations with both the powers striving for domination in the Near\r\nEast; it was a vital necessity for her, however, to be able to rely\r\nupon the effective support of at least one of them in a case of\r\nemergency. Russia’s conduct had aroused a deep feeling of bitterness\r\nand mistrust in Rumania, and every lessening of her influence was a\r\nstep in Austria’s favour. Secondary considerations tended to intensify\r\nthis: on the one hand lay the fact that through Russia’s interposition\r\nRumania had no defendable frontier against Bulgaria; on the other hand\r\nwas the greatly strengthened position created for Austria by her\r\nalliance with Germany, in whose future Prince Carol had the utmost\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is probable that this confederation had much to do with\r\nthe readiness with which Bismarck supported the demands of his good\r\nfriend, Gorchakov.]\r\n\r\nGermany’s attitude towards Rumania had been curiously hostile during\r\nthese events; but when Prince Carol’s father spoke of this to the\r\nGerman Emperor, the latter showed genuine astonishment: Bismarck had\r\nobviously not taken the emperor completely into his confidence. When, a\r\nfew days later, Sturdza had an interview with Bismarck at the latter’s\r\ninvitation, the German Chancellor discovered once more that Rumania had\r\nnothing to expect from Russia. Indeed, Rumania’s position between\r\nRussia and the new Slav state south of the Danube might prove\r\ndangerous, were she not to seek protection and assistance from her two\r\n‘natural friends’, France and Germany. And, with his usual liberality\r\nwhen baiting his policy with false hopes, Bismarck went on to say that\r\n‘Turkey is falling to pieces; nobody can resuscitate her; Rumania has\r\nan important role to fulfil, but for this she must be wise, cautious,\r\nand strong’. This new attitude was the natural counterpart of the\r\nchange which was at that time making itself felt in Russo-German\r\nrelations. While a Franco-Russian alliance was propounded by Gorchakov\r\nin an interview with a French journalist, Bismarck and Andrassy signed\r\nin Gastein the treaty which allied Austria to Germany (September 1879).\r\nAs Rumania’s interests were identical with those of Austria—wrote Count\r\nAndrassy privately to Prince Carol a few months later—namely, to\r\nprevent the fusion of the northern and the southern Slavs, she had only\r\nto express her willingness to become at a given moment the third party\r\nin the compact. In 1883 King Carol accepted a secret treaty of\r\ndefensive alliance from Austria. In return for promises relating to\r\nfuture political partitions in the Balkans, the monarch pledged himself\r\nto oppose all developments likely to speed the democratic evolution, of\r\nRumania. Though the treaty was never submitted to parliament for\r\nratification, and notwithstanding a tariff war and a serious difference\r\nwith Austria on the question of control of the Danube navigation,\r\nRumania was, till the Balkan wars, a faithful ‘sleeping partner’ of the\r\nTriple Alliance.\r\n\r\nAll through that externally quiet period a marked discrepancy existed\r\nand developed between that line of policy and the trend of public\r\nopinion. The interest of the Rumanians within the kingdom centred\r\nincreasingly on their brethren in Transylvania, the solution of whose\r\nhard case inspired most of the popular national movements. Not on\r\naccount of the political despotism of the Magyars, for that of the\r\nRussians was in no way behind it. But whilst the Rumanians of\r\nBessarabia were, with few exceptions, illiterate peasants, in\r\nTransylvania there was a solidly established and spirited middle class,\r\nwhose protests kept pace with the oppressive measures. Many of them—and\r\nof necessity the more turbulent—migrated to Rumania, and there kept\r\nalive the ‘Transylvanian Question’. That the country’s foreign policy\r\nhas nevertheless constantly supported the Central Powers is due, to\r\nsome extent, to the fact that the generation most deeply impressed by\r\nthe events of 1878 came gradually to the leadership of the country; to\r\na greater extent to the increasing influence of German education,[1]\r\nand the economic and financial supremacy which the benevolent passivity\r\nof England and France enabled Germany to acquire; but above all to the\r\npersonal influence of King Carol. Germany, he considered, was at the\r\nbeginning of her development and needed, above all, peace; as Rumania\r\nwas in the same position the wisest policy was to follow Germany,\r\nneglecting impracticable national ideals. King Carol outlined his views\r\nclearly in an interview which he had in Vienna with the Emperor Franz\r\nJoseph in 1883: ‘No nation consents to be bereaved of its political\r\naspirations, and those of the Rumanians are constantly kept at fever\r\nheat by Magyar oppression. But this was no real obstacle to a friendly\r\nunderstanding between the two neighbouring states.’\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Many prominent statesmen like Sturdza, Maiorescu, Carp,\r\n&c. were educated in Germany, whereas the school established by the\r\nGerman community (_Evangelische Knaben und Realschule_), and which it\r\nunder the direct control of the German Ministry of Education, is\r\nattended by more pupils than any other school in Bucarest.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the position when the Balkan peoples rose in 1912 to sever the\r\nlast ties which bound them to the decadent Turkish Empire. King Carol,\r\nwho had, sword in hand, won the independence of his country, could have\r\nno objection to such a desire for emancipation. Nor to the Balkan\r\nLeague itself, unfortunately so ephemeral; for by the first year of his\r\nreign he had already approached the Greek Government with proposals\r\ntoward such a league, and toward freeing the Balkans from the\r\nundesirable interference of the powers.[1] It is true that Rumania,\r\nlike all the other states, had not foreseen the radical changes which\r\nwere to take place, and which considerably affected her position in the\r\nNear East. But she was safe as long as the situation was one of stable\r\nequilibrium and the league remained in existence. ‘Rumania will only be\r\nmenaced by a real danger when a Great Bulgaria comes into existence,’\r\nremarked Prince Carol to Bismarck in 1880, and Bulgaria had done\r\nnothing since to allay Rumanian suspicions. On the contrary, the\r\nproviso of the Berlin Convention that all fortifications along the\r\nRumania frontier should be razed to the ground had not been carried out\r\nby the Bulgarian Government. Bulgarian official publications regarded\r\nthe Dobrudja as a ‘Bulgaria Irredenta’, and at the outset of the first\r\nBalkan war a certain section of the Bulgarian press speculated upon the\r\nBulgarian character of the Dobrudja.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Augenzeuge, op. cit., i. 178]\r\n\r\nThe Balkan League having proclaimed, however, that their action did not\r\ninvolve any territorial changes, and the maintenance of the _status\r\nquo_ having been insisted upon by the European Concert, Rumania\r\ndeclared that she would remain neutral. All this jugglery of mutual\r\nassurances broke down with the unexpected rout of the Turks; the\r\nformula ‘the Balkans to the Balkan peoples’ made its appearance, upon\r\nwhich Bulgaria was at once notified that Rumania would insist upon the\r\nquestion of the Dobrudja frontier being included in any fundamental\r\nalteration of the Berlin Convention. The Bulgarian Premier, M. Danev,\r\nconcurred in this point of view, but his conduct of the subsequent\r\nLondon negotiations was so ‘diplomatic’ that their only result was to\r\nstrain the patience of the Rumanian Government and public opinion to\r\nbreaking point. Nevertheless, the Rumanian Government agreed that the\r\npoint in dispute should be submitted to a conference of the\r\nrepresentatives of the great powers in St. Petersburg, and later\r\naccepted the decision of that conference, though the country considered\r\nit highly unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Balkan League, and especially the collapse of\r\nTurkey, had meant a serious blow to the Central Powers’ policy of\r\npeaceful penetration. Moreover, ‘for a century men have been labouring\r\nto solve the Eastern. Question. On the day when it shall be considered\r\nsolved, Europe will inevitably witness the propounding of the Austrian\r\nQuestion.’[1] To prevent this and to keep open a route to the East\r\nAustro-German diplomacy set to work, and having engineered the creation\r\nof Albania succeeded in barring Serbia’s way to the Adriatic; Serbia\r\nwas thus forced to seek an outlet in the south, where her interests\r\nwere doomed to clash with Bulgarian aspirations. The atmosphere grew\r\nthreatening. In anticipation of a conflict with Bulgaria, Greece and\r\nSerbia sought an alliance with Rumania. The offer was declined; but, in\r\naccordance with the policy which Bucarest had already made quite clear\r\nto Sofia, the Rumanian army was ordered to enter Bulgaria immediately\r\nthat country attacked her former allies. The Rumanians advanced\r\nunopposed to within a few miles of Sofia, and in order to save the\r\ncapital Bulgaria declared her willingness to comply with their claims.\r\nRumania having refused, however, to conclude a separate peace, Bulgaria\r\nhad to give way, and the Balkan premiers met in conference at Bucarest\r\nto discuss terms. The circumstances were not auspicious. The way in\r\nwhich Bulgaria had conducted previous negotiations, and especially the\r\nattack upon her former allies, had exasperated the Rumanians and the\r\nBalkan peoples, and the pressure of public opinion hindered from the\r\noutset a fair consideration of the Bulgarian point of view. Moreover,\r\ncholera was making great ravages in the ranks of the various armies,\r\nand, what threatened to be even more destructive, several great powers\r\nwere looking for a crack in the door to put their tails through, as the\r\nRumanian saying runs. So anxious were the Balkan statesmen to avoid any\r\nsuch interference that they agreed between themselves to a short time\r\nlimit: on a certain day, and by a certain hour, peace was to be\r\nconcluded, or hostilities were to start afresh. The treaty was signed\r\non August 10, 1913, Rumania obtaining the line\r\nTurtukai-Dobrich-Balchik, this being the line already demanded by her\r\nat the time of the London negotiations. The demand was put forth\r\noriginally as a security against the avowed ambitions of Bulgaria; it\r\nwas a strategical necessity, but at the same time a political mistake\r\nfrom the point of view of future relations. The Treaty of Bucarest,\r\nimperfect arrangement as it was, had nevertheless a great historical\r\nsignificance. ‘Without complicating the discussion of our interests,\r\nwhich we are best in a position to understand, by the consideration of\r\nother foreign, interests,’ remarked the President of the Conference,\r\n‘we shall have established for the first time by ourselves peace and\r\nharmony amongst our peoples.’ Dynastic interests and impatient\r\nambitions, however, completely subverted this momentous step towards a\r\nsatisfactory solution of the Eastern Question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Albert Sorel, op, cit., p. 266.]\r\n\r\nThe natural counter-effect of the diplomatic activity of the Central\r\nPowers was a change in Rumanian policy. Rumania considered the\r\nmaintenance of the Balkan equilibrium a vital question, and as she had\r\nentered upon a closer union with Germany against a Bulgaria subjected\r\nto Russian influence, so she now turned to Russia as a guard against a\r\nBulgaria under German influence. This breaking away from the\r\n‘traditional’ policy of adjutancy-in-waiting to the Central Powers was\r\nindicated by the visit of Prince Ferdinand—now King of Rumania—to St.\r\nPetersburg, and the even more significant visit which Tsar Nicholas\r\nafterwards paid to the late King Carol at Constanza. Time has been too\r\nshort, however, for those new relations so to shape themselves as to\r\nexercise a notable influence upon Rumania’s present attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n_Rumania and the Present War_\r\n\r\n\r\n_(a) The Rumanians outside the Kingdom_\r\n\r\nThe axis on which Rumanian foreign policy ought naturally to revolve is\r\nthe circumstance that almost half the Rumanian nation lives outside\r\nRumanian territory. As the available official statistics generally show\r\npolitical bias it is not possible to give precise figures; but roughly\r\nspeaking there are about one million Rumanians in Bessarabia, a quarter\r\nof a million in Bucovina, three and a half millions in Hungary, while\r\nsomething above half a million form scattered colonies in Bulgaria,\r\nSerbia, and Macedonia. All these live in more or less close proximity\r\nto the Rumanian frontiers.\r\n\r\nThat these Rumanian elements have maintained their nationality is due\r\nto purely intrinsic causes. We have seen that the independence of\r\nRumania in her foreign relations had only recently been established,\r\nsince when the king, the factor most influential in foreign politics,\r\nhad discouraged nationalist tendencies, lest the country’s internal\r\ndevelopment might be compromised by friction with neighbouring states.\r\nThe Government exerted its influence against any active expression of\r\nthe national feeling, and the few ‘nationalists’ and the ‘League for\r\nthe cultural unity of all Rumanians’ had been, as a consequence, driven\r\nto seek a justification for their existence in antisemitic agitation.\r\n\r\nThe above circumstances had little influence upon the situation in\r\nBucovina. This province forms an integral part of the Habsburg\r\nmonarchy, with which it was incorporated as early as 1775. The\r\npolitical situation of the Rumanian principalities at the time, and the\r\nabsence of a national cultural movement, left the detached population\r\nexposed to Germanization, and later to the Slav influence of the\r\nrapidly expanding Ruthene element. That language and national\r\ncharacteristics have, nevertheless, not been lost is due to the fact\r\nthat the Rumanian population of Bucovina is peasant almost to a man—a\r\nclass little amenable to changes of civilization.\r\n\r\nThis also applies largely to Bessarabia, which, first lost in 1812, was\r\nincorporated with Rumania in 1856, and finally detached in 1878. The\r\nfew Rumanians belonging to the landed class were won over by the new\r\nmasters. But while the Rumanian population was denied any cultural and\r\nliterary activities of its own, the reactionary attitude of the Russian\r\nGovernment towards education has enabled the Rumanian peasants to\r\npreserve their customs and their language. At the same time their\r\nresultant ignorance has kept them outside the sphere of intellectual\r\ninfluence of the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe Rumanians who live in scattered colonies south of the Danube are\r\nthe descendants of those who took refuge in these regions during the\r\nninth and tenth centuries from the invasions of the Huns. Generally\r\nknown as Kutzo-Vlakhs, or, among themselves, as Aromuni, they are—as\r\neven Weigand, who undoubtedly has Bulgarophil leanings, recognizes—the\r\nmost intelligent and best educated of the inhabitants of Macedonia. In\r\n1905 the Rumanian Government secured from the Porte official\r\nrecognition of their separate cultural and religious organizations on a\r\nnational basis. Exposed as they are to Greek influence, it will be\r\ndifficult to prevent their final assimilation with that people. The\r\ninterest taken in them of late by the Rumanian Government arose out of\r\nthe necessity to secure them against pan-Hellenic propaganda, and to\r\npreserve one of the factors entitling Rumania to participate in the\r\nsettlement of Balkan affairs.\r\n\r\nI have sketched elsewhere the early history of the Rumanians of\r\nTransylvania, the cradle of the Rumanian nation. As already mentioned,\r\npart of the Rumanian nobility of Hungary went over to the Magyars, the\r\nremainder migrating over the mountains. Debarred from the support of\r\nthe noble class, the Rumanian peasantry lost its state of autonomy,\r\nwhich changed into one of serfdom to the soil upon which they toiled.\r\nDesperate risings in 1324, 1437, 1514, 1600, and 1784 tended to case\r\nthe Hungarian oppression, which up to the nineteenth century strove\r\nprimarily after a political and religious hegemony. But the Magyars\r\nhaving failed in 1848 in their attempt to free themselves from Austrian\r\ndomination (defeated with the assistance of a Russian army at Villagos,\r\n1849), mainly on account of the fidelity of the other nationalities to\r\nthe Austrian Crown, they henceforth directed their efforts towards\r\nstrengthening their own position by forcible assimilation of those\r\nnationalities. This they were able to do, however, only after\r\nKöniggrätz, when a weakened Austria had to give way to Hungarian\r\ndemands. In 1867 the Dual Monarchy was established, and Transylvania,\r\nwhich up to then formed a separate duchy enjoying full political\r\nrights, was incorporated with the new Hungarian kingdom. The Magyars\r\nwere handicapped in their imperialist ambitions by their numerical\r\ninferiority. As the next best means to their end, therefore, they\r\nresorted to political and national oppression, class despotism, and a\r\ncomplete disregard of the principles of liberty and humanity.[1]\r\nHungarian was made compulsory in the administration, even in districts\r\nwhere the bulk of the population did not understand that language. In\r\nvillages completely inhabited by Rumanians so-called ‘State’ schools\r\nwere founded, in which only Hungarian was to be spoken, and all\r\nchildren upwards of three years of age had to attend them. The\r\nelectoral regulations were drawn up in such a manner that the Rumanians\r\nof Transylvania, though ten times more numerous than the Magyars, sent\r\na far smaller number than do the latter to the National Assembly. To\r\nquash all protest a special press law was introduced for Transylvania.\r\nBut the Rumanian journalists being usually acquitted by the juries a\r\nnew regulation prescribed that press offences should be tried only at\r\nKluj (Klausenburg)—the sole Transylvanian town with a predominating\r\nHungarian population—a measure which was in fundamental contradiction\r\nto the principles of justice.[2] In 1892 the Rumanian grievances were\r\nembodied in a memorandum which was to have been presented to the\r\nemperor by a deputation. An audience was, however, refused, and at the\r\ninstance of the Hungarian Government the members of the deputation were\r\nsentenced to long terms of imprisonment for having plotted against the\r\nunity of the Magyar state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Rumanians inhabit mainly the province of Transylvania,\r\nBanat, Crishiana, and Maramuresh. They represent 46.2 per cent. of the\r\ntotal population of these provinces, the Magyars 32.5 per cent., the\r\nGermans 11.5 per cent., and the Serbs 4.5 per cent. These figured are\r\ntaken from official Hungarian statistics, and it may therefore be\r\nassumed that the Rumanian percentage represents a minimum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Over a period of 22 years (1886-1908) 850 journalists were\r\ncharged, 367 of whom were Rumanians; the sentences totalling 216 years\r\nof imprisonment, the fines amounting to Fcs. 138,000.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these disabilities the Rumanians of Transylvania\r\nenjoyed a long period of comparative social and economic liberty at a\r\ntime when Turkish and Phanariote domination was hampering all progress\r\nin Rumania. Office under the Government growing increasingly difficult\r\nto obtain, the Rumanians in Transylvania turned largely to commercial\r\nand the open professions, and, as a result, a powerful middle class now\r\nexists. In their clergy, both of the Orthodox and the Uniate\r\nChurch—which last, while conducting its ritual in the vernacular,\r\nrecognizes papal supremacy— the Rumanians have always found strong\r\nmoral support, while the national struggle tends to unite the various\r\nclasses. The Rumanians of Hungary form by far the sanest element in the\r\nRumanian nation. From the Rumanians within the kingdom they have\r\nreceived little beside sympathy. The important part played by the\r\ncountry at the Peace of Bucarest, and her detachment from\r\nAustria-Hungary, must necessarily have stimulated the national\r\nconsciousness of the Transylvanians; while at the same time all hope\r\nfor betterment from within must have ceased at the death of Archduke\r\nFrancis Ferdinand, an avowed friend of the long-suffering\r\nnationalities. It is, therefore, no mere matter of conjecture that the\r\npassive attitude of the Rumanian Government at the beginning of the\r\npresent conflict must have been a bitter disappointment to them.\r\n\r\n_(b) Rumania’s Attitude_\r\n\r\nThe tragic development of the crisis in the summer of 1914 threw\r\nRumania into a vortex of unexpected hopes and fears. Aspirations till\r\nthen considered little else than Utopian became tangible possibilities,\r\nwhile, as suddenly, dangers deemed far off loomed large and near. Not\r\nonly was such a situation quite unforeseen, nor had any plan of action\r\nbeen preconceived to meet it, but it was in Rumania’s case a situation\r\nunique from the number of conflicting considerations and influences at\r\nwork within it. Still under the waning influence of the thirty years\r\nquasi-alliance with Austria, Rumania was not yet acclimatized to her\r\nnew relations with Russia. Notwithstanding the inborn sympathy with and\r\nadmiration for France, the Rumanians could not be blind to Germany’s\r\nmilitary power. The enthusiasm that would have sided with France for\r\nFrance’s sake was faced by the influence of German finance. Sympathy\r\nwith Serbia existed side by side with suspicion of Bulgaria. Popular\r\nsentiment clashed with the views of the king; and the bright vision of\r\nthe ‘principle of nationality’ was darkened by the shadow of Russia as\r\ndespot of the Near East.\r\n\r\nOne fact in the situation stood out from the rest, namely, the\r\nunexpected opportunity of redeeming that half of the Rumanian nation\r\nwhich was still under foreign rule; the more so as one of the parties\r\nin the conflict had given the ‘principle of nationality’ a prominent\r\nplace in its programme. But the fact that both Austria-Hungary and\r\nRussia had a large Rumanian population among their subjects rendered a\r\npurely national policy impossible, and Rumania could do nothing but\r\nweigh which issue offered her the greater advantage.\r\n\r\nThree ways lay open: complete neutrality, active participation on the\r\nside of the Central Powers, or common cause with the Triple Entente.\r\nComplete neutrality was advocated by a few who had the country’s\r\nmaterial security most at heart, and also, as a _pis aller_, by those\r\nwho realized that their opinion that Rumania should make common cause\r\nwith the Central Powers had no prospect of being acted upon.\r\n\r\nThat King Carol favoured the idea of a joint action with Germany is\r\nlikely enough, for such a policy was in keeping with his faith in the\r\npower of the German Empire. Moreover, he undoubtedly viewed with\r\nsatisfaction the possibility of regaining Bessarabia, the loss of which\r\nmust have been bitterly felt by the victor of Plevna. Such a policy\r\nwould have met with the approval of many Rumanian statesmen, notably of\r\nM. Sturdza, sometime leader of the Liberal party and Prime Minister; of\r\nM. Carp, sometime leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister;\r\nof M. Maiorescu, ex-Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, who presided\r\nat the Bucarest Conference of 1913; of M. Marghiloman, till recently\r\nleader of the Conservative party, to name only the more important. M.\r\nSturdza, the old statesman who had been one of King Carol’s chief\r\ncoadjutors in the making of modern Rumania, and who had severed for\r\nmany years his connexion with active politics, again took up his pen to\r\nraise a word of warning. M. Carp, the political aristocrat who had\r\nretired from public life a few years previously, and had professed a\r\nlifelong contempt for the ‘Press and all its works’, himself started a\r\ndaily paper (_Moldova_) which, he intended should expound his views.\r\nWell-known writers like M. Radu Rosetti wrote[1] espousing the cause\r\nfavoured by the king, though not for the king’s reasons: Carol had\r\nfaith in Germany, the Rumanians mistrusted Russia. They saw no\r\nadvantage in the dismemberment of Austria, the most powerful check to\r\nRussia’s plans in the Near East. They dreaded the idea of seeing Russia\r\non the Bosphorus, as rendering illusory Rumania’s splendid position at\r\nthe mouth of the Danube. For not only is a cheap waterway absolutely\r\nnecessary for the bulky products forming the chief exports of Rumania;\r\nbut these very products, corn, petroleum, and timber, also form the\r\nchief exports of Russia, who, by a stroke of the pen, may rule Rumania\r\nout of competition, should she fail to appreciate the political\r\nleadership of Petrograd. Paris and Rome were, no doubt, beloved\r\nsisters; but Sofia, Moscow, and Budapest were next-door neighbours to\r\nbe reckoned with.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See R. Rosetti, _Russian Politics at Work in the Rumanian\r\nCountries_, facts compiled from French official documents, Bucarest,\r\n1914.]\r\n\r\nThose who held views opposed to those, confident in the righteousness\r\nof the Allies’ cause and in their final victory, advocated immediate\r\nintervention, and to that end made the most of the two sentiments which\r\nanimated public opinion: interest in the fate of the Transylvanians,\r\nand sympathy with France. They contended that though a purely national\r\npolicy was not possible, the difference between Transylvania and\r\nBessarabia in area and in number and quality of the population was such\r\nthat no hesitation was admissible. The possession of Transylvania was\r\nassured if the Allies were successful; whereas Russia would soon\r\nrecover if defeated, and would regain Bessarabia by force of arms, or\r\nhave it once more presented to her by a Congress anxious to soothe her\r\n‘sentiment de dignité blessée’. A Rumania enlarged in size and\r\npopulation had a better chance of successfully withstanding any\r\neventual pressure from the north, and it was clear that any attempt\r\nagainst her independence would be bound to develop into a European\r\nquestion. Rumania could not forget what she owed to France; and if\r\ncircumstances had made the Transylvanian question one ‘à laquelle on\r\npense toujours et dont on ne parle jamais’, the greater was the duty,\r\nnow that a favourable opportunity had arisen, to help the brethren\r\nacross the mountains. It was also a duty to fight for right and\r\ncivilization, proclaimed M. Take Ionescu, the exponent of progressive\r\nideas in Rumanian politics; and he, together with the prominent\r\nConservative statesman, M. Filipescu, who loathes the idea of the\r\nRumanians being dominated by the inferior Magyars, are the leaders of\r\nthe interventionist movement. It was due to M. Filipescu’s activity,\r\nespecially, that M. Marghiloman was forced by his own party to resign\r\nhis position as leader on account of his Austrophil sentiments—an event\r\nunparalleled in Rumanian politics.\r\n\r\nThese were the two main currents of opinion which met in conflict at\r\nthe Crown Council—a committee _ad hoc_ consisting of the Cabinet and\r\nthe leaders of the Opposition—summoned by the king early in August\r\n1914, when Rumania’s neutrality was decided upon. The great influence\r\nwhich the Crown can always wield under the Rumanian political system\r\nwas rendered the more potent in the present case by the fact that the\r\nPremier, M. Bratianu, is above all a practical man, and the Liberal\r\nCabinet over which he presides one of the most colourless the country\r\never had: a Cabinet weak to the point of being incapable of realizing\r\nits own weakness and the imperative necessity at this fateful moment of\r\nplacing the helm in the hands of a national ministry. M. Bratianu\r\nconsidered that Rumania was too exposed, and had suffered too much in\r\nthe past for the sake of other countries, to enter now upon such an\r\nadventure without ample guarantees. There would always be time for her\r\nto come in. This policy of opportunism he was able to justify by\r\npowerful argument. The supply of war material for the Rumanian army had\r\nbeen completely in the hands of German and Austrian arsenals, and\r\nespecially in those of Krupp. For obvious reasons Rumania could no\r\nlonger rely upon that source; indeed, Germany was actually detaining\r\ncontracts for war and sanitary material placed with her before the\r\noutbreak of the war. There was the further consideration that, owing to\r\nthe nature of Rumania’s foreign policy in the past, no due attention\r\nhad been given to the defence of the Carpathians, nor to those branches\r\nof the service dealing with mountain warfare. On the other hand, a\r\ncontinuous line of fortifications running from Galatz to Focshani\r\nformed, together with the lower reaches of the Danube, a strong barrier\r\nagainst attack from the north. Rumania’s geographical position is such\r\nthat a successful offensive from Hungary could soon penetrate to the\r\ncapital, and by cutting the country in two could completely paralyse\r\nits organization. Such arguments acquired a magnified importance in the\r\nlight of the failure of the negotiations with Bulgaria, and found many\r\na willing ear in a country governed by a heavily involved landed class,\r\nand depending almost exclusively in its banking organization upon\r\nGerman and Austrian capital.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of practical politics only the issue of the\r\nconflict will determine the wisdom or otherwise of Rumania’s attitude.\r\nBut, though it is perhaps out of place to enlarge upon it here, it is\r\nimpossible not to speak of the moral aspect of the course adopted. By\r\ngiving heed to the unspoken appeal from Transylvania the Rumanian\r\nnational spirit would have been quickened, and the people braced to a\r\nwholesome sacrifice. Many were the wistful glances cast towards the\r\nCarpathians by the subject Rumanians, as they were being led away to\r\nfight for their oppressors; but, wilfully unmindful, the leaders of the\r\nRumanian state buried their noses in their ledgers, oblivious of the\r\nfact that in these times of internationalism a will in common, with\r\naspirations in common, is the very life-blood of nationality. That\r\nsentiment ought not to enter into politics is an argument untenable in\r\na country which has yet to see its national aspirations fulfilled, and\r\nwhich makes of these aspirations definite claims. No Rumanian statesman\r\ncan contend that possession of Transylvania is necessary to the\r\nexistence of the Rumanian state. What they can maintain is that\r\ndeliverance from Magyar oppression is vital to the existence of the\r\nTransylvanians. The right to advance such a claim grows out of their\r\nvery duty of watching over the safety of the subject Rumanians. ‘When\r\nthere are squabbles in the household of my brother-in-law,’ said the\r\nlate Ioan Bratianu when speaking on the Transylvanian question, ‘it is\r\nno affair of mine; but when he raises a knife against his wife, it is\r\nnot merely my right to intervene, it is my duty.’ It is difficult to\r\naccount for the obliquity of vision shown by so many Rumanian\r\npoliticians. ‘The whole policy of such a state [having a large\r\ncompatriot population living in close proximity under foreign\r\ndomination] must be primarily influenced by anxiety as to the fate of\r\ntheir brothers, and by the duty of emancipating them,’ affirms one of\r\nthe most ardent of Rumanian nationalist orators; and he goes on to\r\nassure us that ‘if Rumania waits, it is not from hesitation as to her\r\nduty, but simply in order that she may discharge it more\r\ncompletely’.[1] Meantime, while Rumania waits, regiments composed\r\nalmost completely of Transylvanians have been repeatedly and of set\r\npurpose placed in the forefront of the battle, and as often\r\nannihilated. Such could never be the simple-hearted Rumanian peasant’s\r\nconception of his duty, and here, as in so many other cases in the\r\npresent conflict, the nation at large must not be judged by the policy\r\nof the few who hold the reins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Quarterly Review_, London, April, 1915, pp. 449-50.]\r\n\r\nRumania’s claims to Transylvania are not of an historical nature. They\r\nare founded upon the numerical superiority of the subject Rumanians in\r\nTransylvania, that is upon the ‘principle of nationality’, and are\r\nmorally strengthened by the treatment the Transylvanians suffer at the\r\nhands of the Magyars. By its passivity, however, the Rumanian\r\nGovernment has sacrificed the prime factor of the ‘principle of\r\nnationality’ to the attainment of an object in itself subordinate to\r\nthat factor; that is, it has sacrificed the ‘people’ in order to make\r\nmore sure of the ‘land’. In this way the Rumanian Government has\r\nentered upon a policy of acquisition; a policy which Rumania is too\r\nweak to pursue save under the patronage of one or a group of great\r\npowers; a policy unfortunate inasmuch as it will deprive her of freedom\r\nof action in her external politics. Her policy will, in its\r\nconsequences, certainly react to the detriment of the position acquired\r\nby the country two years ago, when independent action made her arbiter\r\nnot only among the smaller Balkan States, but also among those and her\r\nlate suzerain, Turkey.\r\n\r\nSuch, indeed, must inevitably be the fate of Balkan politics in\r\ngeneral. Passing from Turkish domination to nominal Turkish suzerainty,\r\nand thence to independence within the sphere of influence of a power or\r\ngroup of powers, this gradual emancipation of the states of\r\nsouth-eastern Europe found its highest expression in the Balkan League.\r\nThe war against Turkey was in effect a rebellion against the political\r\ntutelage of the powers. But this emancipation was short-lived. By their\r\ngreed the Balkan States again opened up a way to the intrusion of\r\nforeign diplomacy, and even, as we now see, of foreign troops. The\r\nfirst Balkan war marked the zenith of Balkan political emancipation;\r\nthe second Balkan war was the first act in the tragic _débâcle_ out of\r\nwhich the present situation developed. The interval between August 1913\r\n(Peace of Bucarest) and August 1914 was merely an armistice during\r\nwhich Bulgaria and Turkey recovered their breath, and German and\r\nAustrian diplomacy had time to find a pretext for war on its own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n‘Exhausted but not vanquished we have had to furl our glorious\r\nstandards in order to await better days,’ said Ferdinand of Bulgaria to\r\nhis soldiers after the conclusion of the Peace of Bucarest; and\r\nBudapest, Vienna, and Berlin have no doubt done their best to keep this\r\nspirit of revenge alive and to prevent a renascence of the Balkan\r\nAlliance. They have succeeded. They have done more: they have succeeded\r\nin causing the ‘principle of nationality’—that idea which involves the\r\ndisruption of Austria—to be stifled by the very people whom it was\r\nmeant to save. For whilst the German peoples are united in this\r\nconflict, the majority of the southern Slavs, in fighting the German\r\nbattles, are fighting to perpetuate the political servitude of the\r\nsubject races of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nHowever suspicious Rumania may be of Russia, however bitter the\r\nquarrels between Bulgars, Greeks, and Serbs, it is not, nor can it ever\r\nbe natural, that peoples who have groaned under Turkish despotism for\r\ncenturies should, after only one year of complete liberation, join\r\nhands with an old and dreaded enemy not only against their fellow\r\nsufferers, but even against those who came ‘to die that they may live’.\r\nThese are the Dead Sea fruits of dynastic policy. Called to the thrones\r\nof the small states of the Near East for the purpose of creating order\r\nand peace, the German dynasties have overstepped their function and\r\nabused the power entrusted to them. As long as, in normal times,\r\npolitical activities were confined to the diplomatic arena there was no\r\nperil of rousing the masses out of their ignorant indolence; but, when\r\ntimes are abnormal, it is a different and a dangerous thing to march\r\nthese peoples against their most intimate feelings. When, as the\r\noutcome of the present false situation, sooner or later the dynastic\r\npower breaks, it will then be for the powers who are now fighting for\r\nbetter principles not to impose their own views upon the peoples, or to\r\nplace their own princes upon the vacant thrones. Rather must they see\r\nthat the small nations of the Near East are given a chance to develop\r\nin peace and according to their proper ideals; that they be not again\r\nsubjected to the disintegrating influence of European diplomacy; and\r\nthat, above all, to the nations in common, irrespective of their\r\npresent attitude, there should be a just application of the ‘principle\r\nof nationality’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nTurkey is no better name for the Osmanli dominion or any part of it\r\nthan Normandy would be for Great Britain. It is a mediaeval error of\r\nnomenclature sanctioned by long usage in foreign mouths, but without\r\nany equivalent in the vernacular of the Osmanlis themselves. The real\r\n‘Turkey’ is Turkestan, and the real Turks are the Turcomans. The\r\nOsmanlis are the least typical Turks surviving. Only a very small\r\nproportion of them have any strain of Turkish blood, and this is\r\ndiluted till it is rarely perceptible in their physiognomy: and if\r\nenvironment rather than blood is to be held responsible for racial\r\nfeatures, it can only be said that the territory occupied by the\r\nOsmanlis is as unlike the homeland of the true Turks as it can well be,\r\nand is quite unsuited to typically Turkish life and manners.\r\n\r\nWhile of course it would be absurd to propose at this time of day any\r\nchange in the terms by which the civilized world unanimously designates\r\nthe Osmanlis and their dominion, it is well to insist on their\r\nincorrectness, because, like most erroneous names, they have bred\r\nerroneous beliefs. Thanks in the main to them, the Ottoman power is\r\nsupposed to have originated in an overwhelming invasion of Asia Minor\r\nby immense numbers of Central Asiatic migrants, who, intent, like the\r\nearly Arab armies, on offering to Asia first and Europe second the\r\nchoice of apostasy or death, absorbed or annihilated almost all the\r\nprevious populations, and swept forward into the Balkans as\r\nsingle-minded apostles of Islam. If the composition and the aims of the\r\nOsmanlis had been these, it would pass all understanding how they\r\ncontrived, within a century of their appearance on the western scene,\r\nto establish in North-west Asia and South-east Europe the most\r\ncivilized and best-ordered state of their time. Who, then, are the\r\nOsmanlis in reality? What have they to do with true Turks? and in\r\nvirtue of what innate qualities did they found and consolidate their\r\npower?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n_Origin of the Osmanlis_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear of Turks first from Chinese sources. They were then the\r\ninhabitants, strong and predatory, of the Altai plains and valleys: but\r\nlater on, about the sixth century A.D., they are found firmly\r\nestablished in what is still called Turkestan, and pushing westwards\r\ntowards the Caspian Sea. Somewhat more than another century passes,\r\nand, reached by a missionary faith of West Asia, they come out of the\r\nFar Eastern darkness into a dim light of western history. One Boja,\r\nlord of Kashgar and Khan of what the Chinese knew as the people of\r\nThu-Kiu—probably the same name as ‘Turk’—embraced Islam and forced it\r\non his Mazdeist subjects; but other Turkish tribes, notably the\r\npowerful Uighurs, remained intolerant of the new dispensation, and\r\nexpelled the Thu-Kiu _en masse_ from their holding in Turkestan into\r\nPersia. Here they distributed themselves in detached hordes over the\r\nnorth and centre. At this day, in some parts of Persia, e.g.\r\nAzerbaijan, Turks make the bulk of the population besides supplying the\r\nreigning dynasty of the whole kingdom. For the Shahs of the Kajar house\r\nare not Iranian, but purely Turkish.\r\n\r\nThis, it should be observed, was the western limit of Turkish expansion\r\nin the mass. Azerbaijan is the nearest region to us in which Turki\r\nblood predominates, and the westernmost province of the true Turk\r\nhomeland. All Turks who have passed thence into Hither Asia have come\r\nin comparatively small detachments, as minorities to alien majorities.\r\nThey have invaded as groups of nomads seeking vacant pasturage, or as\r\nbands of military adventurers who, first offering their swords to\r\nprinces of the elder peoples, have subsequently, on several occasions\r\nand in several localities, imposed themselves on their former masters.\r\nTo the first category belong all those Turcoman, Avshar, Yuruk, and\r\nother Turki tribes, which filtered over the Euphrates into unoccupied\r\nor sparsely inhabited parts of Syria and Asia Minor from the seventh\r\ncentury onwards, and survive to this day in isolated patches,\r\ndistinguished from the mass of the local populations, partly by an\r\nineradicable instinct for nomadic life, partly by retention of the\r\npre-Islamic beliefs and practices of the first immigrants. In the\r\nsecond category—military adventurers—fall, for example, the Turkish\r\npraetorians who made and unmade not less than four caliphs at Bagdad in\r\nthe ninth century, and that bold _condottiere_, Ahmed ibn Tulun, who\r\ncaptured a throne at Cairo. Even Christian emperors availed themselves\r\nof these stout fighters. Theophilus of Constantinople anticipated the\r\nOttoman invasion of Europe by some five hundred years when he\r\nestablished Vardariote Turks in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nThe most important members of the second category, however, were the\r\nSeljuks. Like the earlier Thu-Kiu, they were pushed out of Turkestan\r\nlate in the tenth century to found a power in Persia. Here, in\r\nKhorasan, the mass of the horde settled and remained: and it was only a\r\ncomparatively small section which went on westward as military\r\nadventurers to fall upon Bagdad, Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor. This\r\nfirst conquest was little better than a raid, so brief was the\r\nresultant tenure; but a century later two dispossessed nephews of Melek\r\nShah of Persia set out on a military adventure which had more lasting\r\nconsequences. Penetrating with, a small following into Asia Minor, they\r\nseized Konia, and instituted there a kingdom nominally feudatory to the\r\nGrand Seljuk of Persia, but in reality independent and destined to last\r\nabout two centuries. Though numerically weak, their forces, recruited\r\nfrom the professional soldier class which had bolstered up the Abbasid\r\nEmpire and formed the Seljukian kingdoms of Persia and Syria, were\r\nsuperior to any Byzantine troops that could be arrayed in southern or\r\ncentral Asia Minor. They constituted indeed the only compact body of\r\nfighting men seen in these regions for some generations. It found\r\nreinforcement from the scattered Turki groups introduced already, as we\r\nhave seen, into the country; and even from native Christians, who,\r\ndescended from the Iconoclasts of two centuries before, found the rule\r\nof Moslem image-haters more congenial, as it was certainly more\r\neffective, than that of Byzantine emperors. The creed of the Seljuks\r\nwas Islam of an Iranian type. Of Incarnationist colour, it repudiated\r\nthe dour illiberal spirit of the early Arabian apostles which\r\nlatter-day Sunnite orthodoxy has revived. Accordingly its professors,\r\nbacked by an effective force and offering security and privilege,\r\nquickly won over the aborigines—Lycaonians, Phrygians, Cappadocians,\r\nand Cilicians—and welded them into a nation, leaving only a few\r\ndetached communities here and there to cherish allegiance to Byzantine\r\nChristianity. In the event, the population of quite two-thirds of the\r\nAnatolian peninsula had already identified itself with a ruling Turki\r\ncaste before, early in the thirteenth century, fresh Turks appeared on\r\nthe scene—those Turks who were to found the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThey entered Asia Minor much as the earlier Turcomans had entered it—a\r\nsmall body of nomadic adventurers, thrown off by the larger body of\r\nTurks settled in Persia to seek new pastures west of the Euphrates.\r\nThere are divers legends about the first appearance and establishment\r\nof these particular Turks: but all agree that they were of\r\ninconsiderable number— not above four hundred families at most.\r\nDrifting in by way of Armenia, they pressed gradually westward from\r\nErzerum in hope of finding some unoccupied country which would prove\r\nboth element and fertile. Byzantine influence was then at a very low\r\nebb. With Constantinople itself in Latin hands, the Greek writ ran only\r\nalong the north Anatolian coast, ruled from two separate centres, Isnik\r\n(Nicaea) and Trebizond: and the Seljuk kingdom was run in reality much\r\nmore vigorous. Though apparently without a rival, it was subsisting by\r\nconsent, on the prestige of its past, rather than on actual power. The\r\nmoment of its dissolution was approaching, and the Anatolian peninsula,\r\ntwo-thirds Islamized, but ill-organised and very loosely knit, was\r\nbecoming once more a fair field for any adventurer able to command a\r\nsmall compact force.\r\n\r\nThe newly come Turks were invited finally to settle on the extreme\r\nnorth-western fringe of the Seljuk territory—in a region so near Nicaea\r\nthat their sword would be a better title to it than any which the\r\nfeudal authority of Konia could confer. In fact it was a debatable\r\nland, an angle pushed up between the lake plain of Nicaea on the one\r\nhand and the plain of Brusa on the other, and divided from each by not\r\nlofty heights, Yenishehr, its chief town, which became the Osmanli\r\nchief Ertogrul’s residence, lies, as the crow flies, a good deal less\r\nthan fifty miles from the Sea of Marmora, and not a hundred miles from\r\nConstantinople itself. Here Ertogrul was to be a Warden of the Marches,\r\nto hold his territory for the Seljuk and extend it for himself at the\r\nexpense of Nicaea if he could. If he won through, so much the better\r\nfor Sultan Alaeddin; if he failed, _vile damnum!_\r\n\r\nHardly were his tribesmen settled, however, among the Bithynians and\r\nGreeks of Yenishehr, before the Seljuk collapse became a fact. The\r\nTartar storm, ridden by Jenghis Khan, which had overwhelmed Central\r\nAsia, spent its last force on the kingdom of Konia, and, withdrawing,\r\nleft the Seljuks bankrupt of force and prestige and Anatolia without an\r\noverlord. The feudatories were free everywhere to make or mar\r\nthemselves, and they spent the last half of the thirteenth century in\r\nfighting for whatever might be saved from the Seljuk wreck before it\r\nfoundered for ever about 1300 A.D. In the south, the centre, and the\r\neast of the peninsula, where Islam had long rooted itself as the\r\npopular social system, various Turki emirates established themselves on\r\na purely Moslem basis—certain of these, like the Danishmand emirate of\r\nCappadocia, being restorations of tribal jurisdictions which had\r\nexisted before the imposition of Seljuk overlordship.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme north-west, however, where the mass of society was still\r\nChristian and held itself Greek, no Turkish, potentate could either\r\nrevive a pre-Seljukian status or simply carry on a Seljukian system in\r\nminiature. If he was to preserve independence at all, he must rely on a\r\nsociety which was not yet Moslem and form a coalition with the\r\n‘Greeks’, into whom the recent recovery of Constantinople from the\r\nLatins had put fresh heart. Osman, who had succeeded Ertogrul in 1288,\r\nrecognized where his only possible chance of continued dominion and\r\nfuture aggrandizement lay. He turned to the Greeks, as an element of\r\nvitality and numerical strength to be absorbed into his nascent state,\r\nand applied himself unremittingly to winning over and identifying with\r\nhimself the Greek feudal seigneurs in his territory or about its\r\nfrontiers. Some of these, like Michael, lord of Harmankaya, readily\r\nenough stood in with the vigorous Turk and became Moslems. Others, as\r\nthe new state gained momentum, found themselves obliged to accept it or\r\nbe crushed. There are to this day Greek communities in the Brusa\r\ndistrict jealously guarding privileges which date from compacts made\r\nwith their seigneurs by Osman and his son Orkhan.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the Seljuk kingdom was finally extinguished, in or\r\nabout 1300 A.D. that Osman assumed at Yenishehr the style and title of\r\na sultan. Acknowledged from Afium Kara Hissar, in northern Phrygia, to\r\nthe Bithynian coast of the Marmora, beside whose waters his standards\r\nhad already been displayed, he lived on to see Brusa fall to his son\r\nOrkhan, in 1326, and become the new capital. Though Nicaea still held\r\nout, Osman died virtual lord of the Asiatic Greeks; and marrying his\r\nson to a Christian girl, the famous Nilufer, after whom the river of\r\nBrusa is still named, he laid on Christian foundations the strength of\r\nhis dynasty and his state. The first regiment of professional Ottoman\r\nsoldiery was recruited by him and embodied later by Orkhan, his son,\r\nfrom Greek and other Christian-born youths, who, forced to apostatize,\r\nwere educated as Imperial slaves in imitation of the Mamelukes,\r\nconstituted more than a century earlier in Egypt, and now masters where\r\nthey had been bondmen. It is not indeed for nothing that Osman’s latest\r\nsuccessor, and all who hold by him, distinguish themselves from other\r\npeoples by his name. They are Osmanlis (or by a European use of the\r\nmore correct form Othman, ‘Ottomans’), because they derived their being\r\nas a nation and derive their national strength, not so much from\r\ncentral Asia as from the blend of Turk and Greek which Osman promoted\r\namong his people. This Greek strain has often been reinforced since his\r\nday and mingled with other Caucasian strains.\r\n\r\nIt was left to Orkhan to round off this Turco-Grecian realm in\r\nByzantine Asia by the capture first of Ismid (Nicomedia) and then of\r\nIsnik (Nicaea); and with this last acquisition the nucleus of a\r\nself-sufficient sovereign state was complete. After the peaceful\r\nabsorption of the emirate of Karasi, which added west central Asia\r\nMinor almost as far south as the Hermus, the Osmanli ruled in 1338 a\r\ndominion of greater area than that of the Greek emperor, whose capital\r\nand coasts now looked across to Ottoman shores all the way from the\r\nBosphorus to the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n_Expansion of the Osmanli Kingdom_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the new state was to expand by conquest, its line of advance was\r\nalready foreshadowed. For the present, it could hardly break back into\r\nAsia Minor, occupied as this was by Moslem principalities sanctioned by\r\nthe same tradition as itself, namely, the prestige of the Seljuks. To\r\nattack these would be to sin against Islam. But in front lay a rich but\r\nweak Christian state, the centre of the civilization to which the\r\npopular element in the Osmanli society belonged. As inevitably as the\r\nstate of Nicaea had desired, won, and transferred itself to,\r\nConstantinople, so did the Osmanli state of Brusa yearn towards the\r\nsame goal; and it needed no invitation from a Greek to dispose an\r\nOttoman sultan to push over to the European shore.\r\n\r\nSuch an invitation, however, did in fact precede the first Osmanli\r\ncrossing in force. In 1345 John Cantacuzene solicited help of Orkhan\r\nagainst the menace of Dushan, the Serb. Twelve years later came a\r\nsecond invitation. Orkhan’s son, Suleiman, this time ferried a large\r\narmy over the Hellespont, and, by taking and holding Gallipoli and\r\nRodosto, secured a passage from continent to continent, which the\r\nOttomans would never again let go.\r\n\r\nSuch invitations, though they neither prompted the extension of the\r\nOsmanli realm into Europe nor sensibly precipitated it, did\r\nnevertheless divert the course of the Ottoman arms and reprieve the\r\nGreek empire till Timur and his Tartars could come on the scene and,\r\nall unconsciously, secure it a further respite. But for these\r\ndiversions there is little doubt Constantinople would have passed into\r\nOttoman hands nearly a century earlier than the historic date of its\r\nfall. The Osmanli armies, thus led aside to make the Serbs and not the\r\nGreeks of Europe their first objective, became involved at once in a\r\ntangle of Balkan affairs from which they only extricated themselves\r\nafter forty years of incessant fighting in almost every part of the\r\npeninsula except the domain of the Greek emperor. This warfare, which\r\nin no way advanced the proper aims of the lords of Brusa and Nicaea,\r\nnot only profited the Greek emperor by relieving him of concern about\r\nhis land frontier but also used up strength which might have made head\r\nagainst the Tartars. Constantinople then, as now, was detached from the\r\nBalkans. The Osmanlis, had they possessed themselves of it, might well\r\nhave let the latter be for a long time to come. Instead, they had to\r\nbattle, with the help now of one section of the Balkan peoples, now of\r\nanother, till forced to make an end of all their feuds and treacheries\r\nby annexations after the victories of Kosovo in 1389 and Nikopolis in\r\n1396.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. They became involved also with certain peoples of the\r\nmain continent of Europe, whose interests or sympathies had been\r\naffected by those long and sanguinary Balkan wars. There was already\r\nbad blood and to spare between the Osmanlis on the one hand, and\r\nHungarians, Poles, and Italian Venetians on the other, long before any\r\nsecond opportunity to attack Constantinople occurred: and the Osmanlis\r\nwere in for that age-long struggle to secure a ‘scientific frontier’\r\nbeyond the Danube, whence the Adriatic on the one flank and the Euxine\r\non the other could be commanded, which was to make Ottoman history down\r\nto the eighteenth century and spell ruin in the end.\r\n\r\nIt is a vulgar error to suppose that the Osmanlis set out for Europe,\r\nin the spirit of Arab apostles, to force their creed and dominion on\r\nall the world. Both in Asia and Europe, from first to last, their\r\nexpeditions and conquests have been inspired palpably by motives\r\nsimilar to those active among the Christian powers, namely, desire for\r\npolitical security and the command of commercial areas. Such wars as\r\nthe Ottoman sultans, once they were established at Constantinople, did\r\nwage again and again with knightly orders or with Italian republics\r\nwould have been undertaken, and fought with the same persistence, by\r\nany Greek emperor who felt himself strong enough. Even the Asiatic\r\ncampaigns, which Selim I and some of his successors, down to the end of\r\nthe seventeenth century, would undertake, were planned and carried out\r\nfrom similar motives. Their object was to secure the eastern basin of\r\nthe Mediterranean by the establishment of some strong frontier against\r\nIran, out of which had come more than once forces threatening the\r\ndestruction of Ottoman power. It does not, of course, in any respect\r\ndisprove their purpose that, in the event, this object was never\r\nattained, and that an unsatisfactory Turco-Persian border still\r\nillustrates at this day the failures of Selim I and Mohammed IV.\r\n\r\nBy the opening of the fifteenth century, when, all unlooked for, a most\r\nterrible Tartar storm was about to break upon western Asia, the Osmanli\r\nrealm had grown considerably, not only in Europe by conquest, but also\r\nin Asia by the peaceful effect of marriages and heritages. Indeed it\r\nnow comprised scarcely less of the Anatolian peninsula than the last\r\nSeljuks had held, that is to say, the whole of the north as far as the\r\nHalys river beyond Angora, the central plateau to beyond Konia, and all\r\nthe western coast-lands. The only emirs not tributary were those of\r\nKaramania, Cappadocia, and Pontus, that is of the southern and eastern\r\nfringes; and one detached fragment of Greek power survived in the\r\nlast-named country, the kingdom of Trebizond. As for Europe, it had\r\nbecome the main scene of Osmanli operations, and now contained the\r\nadministrative capital, Adrianople, though Brusu kept a sentimental\r\nprimacy. Sultan Murad, who some years after his succession in 1359 had\r\ndefinitely transferred the centre of political gravity to Thrace, was\r\nnevertheless carried to the Bithynian capital for burial, Bulgaria,\r\nSerbia, and districts of both Bosnia and Macedonia were now integral\r\nparts of an empire which had come to number at least as many Christian\r\nas Moslem subjects, and to depend as much on the first as on the last.\r\nNot only had the professional Osmanli soldiery, the Janissaries,\r\ncontinued to be recruited from the children of native Christian races,\r\nbut contingents of adult native warriors, who still professed\r\nChristianity, had been invited or had offered themselves to fight\r\nOsmanli battles—even those waged against men of the True Faith in Asia.\r\nA considerable body of Christian Serbs had stood up in Murad’s line at\r\nthe battle of Konia in 1381, before the treachery of another body of\r\nthe same race gave him the victory eight years later at Kosovo. So\r\nlittle did the Osmanli state model itself on the earlier caliphial\r\nempires and so naturally did it lean towards the Roman or Byzantine\r\nimperial type.\r\n\r\nAnd just because it had come to be in Europe and of Europe, it was able\r\nto survive the terrible disaster of Angora in 1402. Though the Osmanli\r\narmy was annihilated by Timur, and an Osmanli sultan, for the first and\r\nlast time in history, remained in the hands of the foe, the\r\nadministrative machinery of the Osmanli state was not paralysed. A new\r\nruler was proclaimed at Adrianople, and the European part of the realm\r\nheld firm. The moment that the Tartars began to give ground, the\r\nOsmanlis began to recover it. In less than twenty years they stood\r\nagain in Asia as they were before Timur’s attack, and secure for the\r\ntime on the east, could return to restore their prestige in the west,\r\nwhere the Tartar victory had bred unrest and brought both the\r\nHungarians and the Venetians on the Balkan scene. Their success was\r\nonce more rapid and astonishing: Salonika passed once and for all into\r\nOttoman hands: the Frank seigneurs and the despots of Greece were alike\r\nhumbled; and although Murad II failed to crush the Albanian,\r\nSkanderbey, he worsted his most dangerous foe, John Hunyadi, with the\r\nhelp of Wallach treachery at the second battle of Kosovo. At his death,\r\nthree years later, he left the Balkans quiet and the field clear for\r\nhis successor to proceed with the long deferred but inevitable\r\nenterprise of attacking all that was left of Greek empire, the district\r\nand city of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe doom of New Rome was fulfilled within two years. In the end it\r\npassed easily enough into the hands of those who already had been in\r\npossession of its proper empire for a century or more. Historians have\r\nmade more of this fall of Constantinople in 1453 than contemporary\r\nopinion seems to have made of it. No prince in Europe was moved to any\r\naction by its peril, except, very half-heartedly, the Doge. Venice\r\ncould not feel quite indifferent to the prospect of the main part of\r\nthat empire, which, while in Greek hands, had been her most serious\r\ncommercial competitor, passing into the stronger hands of the Osmanlis.\r\nOnce in Constantinople, the latter, long a land power only, would be\r\nbound to concern themselves with the sea also. The Venetians made no\r\neffort worthy of their apprehensions, though these were indeed\r\nexceedingly well founded; for, as all the world knows, to the sea the\r\nOsmanlis did at once betake themselves. In less than thirty years they\r\nwere ranging all the eastern Mediterranean and laying siege to Rhodes,\r\nthe stronghold of one of their most dangerous competitors, the Knights\r\nHospitallers.\r\n\r\nIn this consequence consists the chief historic importance of the\r\nOsmanli capture of Constantinople. For no other reason can it he called\r\nan epoch-marking event. If it guaranteed the Empire of the East against\r\npassing into any western hands, for example, those of Venice or Genoa,\r\nit did not affect the balance of power between Christendom and Islam;\r\nfor the strength of the former had long ceased to reside at all in\r\nConstantinople. The last Greek emperor died a martyr, but not a\r\nchampion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n_Heritage and Expansion of Byzantine Empire_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of his victory, Mohammed the Conqueror took pains to make\r\nit clear that his introduction of a new heaven did not entail a new\r\nearth. As little as might be would be changed. He had displaced a\r\nPalaeologus by an Osmanli only in order that an empire long in fact\r\nOsmanli should henceforth be so also _de jure_. Therefore he confirmed\r\nthe pre-existing Oecumenical patriarch in his functions and the\r\nByzantine Greeks in their privileges, renewed the rights secured to\r\nChristian foreigners by the Greek emperors, and proclaimed that, for\r\nhis accession to the throne, there should not be made a Moslem the more\r\nor a Christian the less. Moreover, during the thirty years left to him\r\nof life, Mohammed devoted himself to precisely those tasks which would\r\nhave fallen to a Greek emperor desirous of restoring Byzantine power.\r\nHe thrust back Latins wherever they were encroaching on the Greek\r\nsphere, as were the Venetians of the Morea, the Hospitallers of Rhodes,\r\nand the Genoese of the Crimea: and he rounded off the proper Byzantine\r\nholding by annexing, in Europe, all the Balkan peninsula except the\r\nimpracticable Black Mountain, the Albanian highlands, and the Hungarian\r\nfortress of Belgrade; and, in Asia, what had remained independent in\r\nthe Anatolian peninsula, the emirates of Karamania and Cappadocia.\r\n\r\nBefore Mohammed died in 1481 the Osmanli Turco-Grecian nation may be\r\nsaid to have come into its own. It was lord _de facto et de jure belli_\r\nof the eastern or Greek Empire, that is of all territories and seas\r\ngrouped geographically round Constantinople as a centre, with only a\r\nfew exceptions unredeemed, of which the most notable were the islands\r\nof Cyprus, Rhodes, and Krete, still in Latin hands. Needless to say,\r\nthe Osmanlis themselves differed greatly from their imperial\r\npredecessors. Their official speech, their official creed, their family\r\nsystem were all foreign to Europe, and many of their ideas of\r\ngovernment had been learned in the past from Persia and China, or were\r\nderived from the original tribal organization of the true Turks. But if\r\nthey were neither more nor less Asiatics than the contemporary\r\nRussians, they were quite as much Europeans as many of the Greek\r\nemperors had been—those of the Isaurian dynasty, for instance. They had\r\ngiven no evidence as yet of a fanatical Moslem spirit—this was to be\r\nbred in them by subsequent experiences—and their official creed had\r\ngoverned their policy hardly more than does ours in India or Egypt.\r\nMohammed the Conqueror had not only shown marked favour to Christians,\r\nwhether his _rayas_ or not, but encouraged letters and the arts in a\r\nvery un-Arabian spirit. Did he not have himself portrayed by Gentile\r\nBellini? The higher offices of state, both civil and military, were\r\nconfided (and would continue so to be for a century to come) almost\r\nexclusively to men of Christian origin. Commerce was encouraged, and\r\nwestern traders recognized that their facilities were greater now than\r\nthey had been under Greek rule. The Venetians, for example, enjoyed in\r\nperfect liberty a virtual monopoly of the Aegean and Euxine trade. The\r\nsocial condition of the peasantry seems to have been better than it had\r\nbeen under Greek seigneurs, whether in Europe or in Asia, and better\r\nthan it was at the moment in feudal Christendom. The Osmanli military\r\norganization was reputed the best in the world, and its fame attracted\r\nadventurous spirits from all over Europe to learn war in the first\r\nschool of the age. Ottoman armies, it is worth while to remember, were\r\nthe only ones then attended by efficient medical and commissariat\r\nservices, and may be said to have introduced to Europe these\r\nalleviations of the horrors of war.\r\n\r\nHad the immediate successors of Mohammed been content—or, rather, had\r\nthey been able—to remain within his boundaries, they would have robbed\r\nOttoman history of one century of sinister brilliance, but might have\r\npostponed for many centuries the subsequent sordid decay; for the seeds\r\nof this were undoubtedly sown by the three great sultans who followed\r\nthe taker of Constantinople. Their ambitions or their necessities led\r\nto a great increase of the professional army which would entail many\r\nevils in time to come. Among these were praetorianism in the capital\r\nand the great provincial towns; subjection of land and peasantry to\r\nmilitary seigneurs, who gradually detached themselves from the central\r\ncontrol; wars undertaken abroad for no better reason than the\r\nemployment of soldiery feared at home; consequent expansion of the\r\nterritorial empire beyond the administrative capacity of the central\r\ngovernment; development of the ‘tribute-children’ system of recruiting\r\ninto a scourge of the _rayas_ and a continual offence to neighbouring\r\nstates, and the supplementing of that system by acceptance of any and\r\nevery alien outlaw who might offer himself for service: lastly, revival\r\nof the dormant crusading spirit of Europe, which reacted on the\r\nOsmanlis, begetting in them an Arabian fanaticism and disposing them to\r\nrevert to the obscurantist spirit of the earliest Moslems. To sum the\r\nmatter up in other words: the omnipotence and indiscipline of the\r\nJanissaries; the contumacy of ‘Dere Beys’ (‘Lords of the Valleys,’ who\r\nmaintained a feudal independence) and of provincial governors; the\r\nconcentration of the official mind on things military and religious, to\r\nthe exclusion of other interests; the degradation and embitterment of\r\nthe Christian elements in the empire; the perpetual financial\r\nembarrassment of the government with its inevitable consequence of\r\noppression and neglect of the governed; and the constant provocation in\r\nChristendom of a hostility which was always latent and recurrently\r\nactive— all these evils, which combined to push the empire nearer and\r\nnearer to ruin from the seventeenth century onwards, can be traced to\r\nthe brilliant epoch of Osmanli history associated with the names of\r\nBayezid II, Selim I, and Suleiman the Magnificent.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Fate, rather than any sultan, must be blamed. It was\r\nimpossible to forgo some further extension of the empire, and very\r\ndifficult to arrest extension at any satisfactory static point. For one\r\nthing, as has been pointed out already, there were important\r\nterritories in the proper Byzantine sphere still unredeemed at the\r\ndeath of Mohammed. Rhodes, Krete, and Cyprus, whose possession carried\r\nwith it something like superior control of the Levantine trade, were in\r\nLatin hands. Austrian as well as Venetian occupation of the best\r\nharbours was virtually closing the Adriatic to the masters of the\r\nBalkans. Nor could the inner lands of the Peninsula be quite securely\r\nheld while the great fortress of Belgrade, with the passage of the\r\nDanube, remained in Hungarian keeping, Furthermore, the Black Sea,\r\nwhich all masters of the Bosphorus have desired to make a Byzantine\r\nlake, was in dispute with the Wallachs and the Poles; and, in the reign\r\nof Mohammed’s successor, a cloud no bigger than a man’s hand came up\r\nabove its northern horizon—the harbinger of the Muscovite.\r\n\r\nAs for the Asiatic part of the Byzantine sphere, there was only one\r\nlittle corner in the south-east to be rounded off to bring all the\r\nAnatolian peninsula under the Osmanli. But that corner, the Cilician\r\nplain, promised trouble, since it was held by another Islamic power,\r\nthat of the Egyptian Mamelukes, which, claiming to be at least equal to\r\nthe Osmanli, possessed vitality much below its pretensions. The\r\ntemptation to poach on it was strong, and any lord of Constantinople\r\nwho once gave way to this, would find himself led on to assume control\r\nof all coasts of the easternmost Levant, and then to push into inland\r\nAsia in quest of a scientific frontier at their back—perilous and\r\ncostly enterprise which Rome had essayed again and again and had to\r\nrenounce in the end. Bayezid II took the first step by summoning the\r\nMameluke to evacuate certain forts near Tarsus, and expelling his\r\ngarrisons _vi et armis_. Cilicia passed to the Osmanli; but for the\r\nmoment he pushed no farther. Bayezid, who was under the obligation\r\nalways to lead his army in person, could make but one campaign at a\r\ntime; and a need in Europe was the more pressing. In quitting Cilicia,\r\nhowever, he left open a new question in Ottoman politics—the Asiatic\r\ncontinental question—and indicated to his successor a line of least\r\nresistance on which to advance. Nor would this be his only dangerous\r\nlegacy. The prolonged and repeated raids into Adriatic lands, as far\r\nnorth as Carniola and Carinthia, with which the rest of Bayezid’s reign\r\nwas occupied, brought Ottoman militarism at last to a point, whose\r\neventual attainment might have been foreseen any time in the past\r\ncentury— the point at which, strong in the possession of a new arm,\r\nartillery, it would assume control of the state.\r\n\r\nBayezid’s seed was harvested by Selim. First in a long series of\r\npraetorian creatures which would end only with the destroyer of the\r\npraetorians themselves three centuries later, he owed his elevation to\r\na Janissary revolt, and all the eight bloody years of his reign were to\r\nbe punctuated by Janissary tumults. To keep his creators in any sort of\r\norder and contentment he had no choice but to make war from his first\r\nyear to his last. When he died, in 1520, the Ottoman Empire had been\r\nswelled to almost as wide limits in Asia and Africa as it has ever\r\nattained since his day. Syria, Armenia, great part of Kurdistan,\r\nnorthern Mesopotamia, part of Arabia, and last, but not least, Egypt,\r\nwere forced to acknowledge Osmanli suzerainty, and for the first time\r\nan Osmanli sultan had proclaimed himself caliph. True that neither by\r\nhis birth nor by the manner of his appointment did Selim satisfy the\r\northodox caliphial tradition; but, besides his acquisition of certain\r\nvenerated relics of the Prophet, such as the _Sanjak i-sherif_ or holy\r\nstandard, and besides a yet more important acquisition—the control of\r\nthe holy cities of the faith— he could base a claim on the unquestioned\r\nfact that the office was vacant, and the equally certain fact that he\r\nwas the most powerful Moslem prince in the world. Purists might deny\r\nhim if they dared: the vulgar Sunni mind was impressed and disposed to\r\naccept. The main importance, however, of Selim’s assumption of the\r\ncaliphate was that it consecrated Osmanli militarism to a religious\r\nend—to the original programme of Islam. This was a new thing, fraught\r\nwith dire possibilities from that day forward. It marked the\r\nsupersession of the Byzantine or European ideal by the Asiatic in\r\nOsmanli policy, and introduced a phase of Ottoman history which has\r\nendured to our own time.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable process was continued in the next reign. Almost all the\r\nmilitary glories of Suleiman—known to contemporary Europe as ‘the\r\nMagnificent’ and often held by historians the greatest of Osmanli\r\nsultans— made for weakening, not strengthening, the empire. His\r\nearliest operations indeed, the captures of Rhodes from the Knights and\r\nof Belgrade and Šabac from the Hungarians, expressed a legitimate\r\nByzantine policy; and the siege of Malta, one of his latest ventures,\r\nmight also be defended as a measure taken in the true interests of\r\nByzantine commerce. But the most brilliant and momentous of his\r\nachievements bred evils for which military prestige and the material\r\nprofits to be gained from the oppression of an irreconcilable\r\npopulation were inadequate compensation. This was the conquest of\r\nHungary. It would result in Buda and its kingdom remaining Ottoman\r\nterritory for a century and a half, and in the principalities of\r\nWallachia and Moldavia abiding under the Ottoman shadow even longer,\r\nand passing for all time out of the central European into the Balkan\r\nsphere; but also it would result in the Osmanli power finding itself on\r\na weak frontier face to face at last with a really strong Christian\r\nrace, the Germanic, before which, since it could not advance, it would\r\nhave ultimately to withdraw; and in the rousing of Europe to a sense of\r\nits common danger from Moslem activity. Suleiman’s failure to take\r\nVienna more than made good the panic which had followed on his victory\r\nat Mohacs. It was felt that the Moslem, now that he had failed against\r\nthe bulwark of central Europe, was to go no farther, and that the hour\r\nof revenge was near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ottoman Empire (Except the Arabian and African\r\nprovinces)]\r\n\r\nIt was nearer than perhaps was expected. Ottoman capacity to administer\r\nthe overgrown empire in Europe and Asia was strained already almost to\r\nbreaking-point, and it was in recognition of this fact that Suleiman\r\nmade the great effort to reorganize his imperial system, which has\r\nearned him his honourable title of _El Kanun_, the Regulator. But if he\r\ncould reset and cleanse the wheels of the administrative machine, he\r\ncould not increase its capacity. New blood was beginning to fail for\r\nthe governing class just as the demands on it became greater. No longer\r\ncould it be manned exclusively from the Christian born. Two centuries\r\nof recruiting in the Balkans and West Asia had sapped their resources.\r\nEven the Janissaries were not now all ‘tribute-children’. Their own\r\nsons, free men Moslem born, began to be admitted to the ranks. This\r\nchange was a vital infringement of the old principle of Osmanli rule,\r\nthat all the higher administrative and military functions should be\r\nvested in slaves of the imperial household, directly dependent on the\r\nsultan himself; and once breached, this principle could not but give\r\nway more and more. The descendants of imperial slaves, free-born\r\nMoslems, but barred from the glory and profits of their fathers’\r\nfunction, had gradually become a very numerous class of country\r\ngentlemen distributed over all parts of the empire, and a very\r\nmalcontent one. Though it was still subservient, its dissatisfaction at\r\nexclusion from the central administration was soon to show itself\r\npartly in assaults on the time-honoured system, partly in assumption of\r\nlocal jurisdiction, which would develop into provincial independence.\r\n\r\nThe overgrowth of his empire further compelled Suleiman to divide the\r\nstanding army, in order that more than one imperial force might take\r\nthe field at a time. Unable to lead all his armies in person, he\r\nelected, in the latter part of his reign, to lead none, and for the\r\nfirst time left the Janissaries to march without a sultan to war.\r\nRemaining himself at the centre, he initiated a fashion which would\r\nencourage Osmanli sultans to lapse into half-hidden beings, whom their\r\nsubjects would gradually invest with religious character. Under these\r\nconditions the ruler, the governing class (its power grew with this\r\ndevolution), the dominant population of the state, and the state itself\r\nall grew more fanatically Moslem.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the seventeenth century, Ahmed I being on the\r\nthrone, the Ottoman Empire embraced the widest territorial area which\r\nit was ever to cover at any one moment. In what may be called the\r\nproper Byzantine field, Cyprus had been recovered and Krete alone stood\r\nout. Outside that field, Hungary on the north and Yemen (since Selim’s\r\nconquest in 1516) on the south were the frontier provinces, and the\r\nOttoman flag had been carried not only to the Persian Gulf but also far\r\nupon the Iranian plateau, in the long wars of Murad III, which\r\nculminated in 1588 with the occupation of Tabriz and half Azerbaijan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n_Shrinkage and Retreat_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fringes of this vast empire, however, none too surely held, were\r\nalready involving it in insoluble difficulties and imminent dangers. On\r\nthe one hand, in Asia, it had been found impossible to establish\r\nmilitary fiefs in Arabia, Kurdistan, or anywhere east of it, on the\r\nsystem which had secured the Osmanli tenure elsewhere. On the other\r\nhand, in Europe, as we have seen, the empire had a very unsatisfactory\r\nfrontier, beyond which a strong people not only set limits to further\r\nprogress but was prepared to dispute the ground already gained. In a\r\ntreaty signed at Sitvatorok, in 1606, the Osmanli sultan was forced to\r\nacknowledge definitely the absolute and equal sovereignty of his\r\nnorthern neighbour, Austria; and although, less than a century later,\r\nVienna would be attacked once more, there was never again to be serious\r\nprospect of an extension of the empire in the direction of central\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nMoreover, however appearances might be maintained on the frontiers, the\r\nheart of the empire had begun patently to fail. The history of the next\r\ntwo centuries, the seventeenth and eighteenth, is one long record of\r\npraetorian tumults at home; and ever more rarely will these be\r\ncompensated by military successes abroad. The first of these centuries\r\nhad not half elapsed ere the Janissaries had taken the lives of two\r\nsultans, and brought the Grand Vizierate to such a perilous pass that\r\nno ordinary holder of it, unless backed by some very powerful Albanian\r\nor other tribal influence, could hope to save his credit or even his\r\nlife. During this period indeed no Osmanli of the older stocks ever\r\nexercised real control of affairs. It was only among the more recently\r\nassimilated elements, such as the Albanian, the Slavonic, or the Greek,\r\nthat men of the requisite character and vigour could be found. The\r\nrally which marked the latter half of the seventeenth century was\r\nentirely the work of Albanians or of other generals and admirals, none\r\nof whom had had a Moslem grandfather. Marked by the last Osmanli\r\nconquest made at the expense of Europe—that of Krete; by the definite\r\nsubjugation of Wallachia; by the second siege of Vienna; by the\r\nrecovery of the Morea from Venice; and finally by an honourable\r\narrangement with Austria about the Danube frontier—it is all to be\r\ncredited to the Kuprili ‘dynasty’ of Albanian viziers, which\r\nconspicuously outshone the contemporary sovereigns of the dynasty of\r\nOsman, the best of them, Mohammed IV, not excepted. It was, however, no\r\nmore than a rally; for greater danger already threatened from another\r\nquarter. Agreement had not been reached with Austria at Carlowitz, in\r\n1699, before a new and baleful planet swam into the Osmanli sky.\r\n\r\nIt was, this time, no central European power, to which, at the worst,\r\nall that lay north of the proper Byzantine sphere might be abandoned;\r\nbut a claimant for part of that sphere itself, perhaps even for the\r\nvery heart of it. Russia, seeking an economic outlet, had sapped her\r\nway south to the Euxine shore, and was on the point of challenging the\r\nOsmanli right to that sea. The contest would involve a vital issue; and\r\nif the Porte did not yet grasp this fact, others had grasped it. The\r\nfamous ‘Testament of Peter the Great’ may or may not be a genuine\r\ndocument; but, in either case, it proves that certain views about the\r\nnecessary policy of Russia in the Byzantine area, which became\r\ncommonplaces of western political thinkers as the eighteenth century\r\nadvanced, were already familiar to east European minds in the earlier\r\npart of that century.\r\n\r\nBattle was not long in being joined. In the event, it would cost Russia\r\nabout sixty years of strenuous effort to reduce the Byzantine power of\r\nthe Osmanlis to a condition little better than that in which Osman had\r\nfound the Byzantine power of the Greeks four centuries before. During\r\nthe first two-thirds of this period the contest was waged not\r\nunequally. By the Treaty of Belgrade, in 1739, Sultan Mahmud I appeared\r\nfor a moment even to have gained the whole issue, Russia agreeing to\r\nher own exclusion from the Black Sea, and from interference in the\r\nDanubian principalities. But the success could not be sustained.\r\nRepeated effort was rapidly exhausting Osmanli strength, sapped as it\r\nwas by increasing internal disease: and when a crisis arrived with the\r\naccession of the Empress Catherine, it proved too weak to meet it.\r\nDuring the ten years following 1764 Osmanli hold on the Black Sea was\r\nlost irretrievably. After the destruction of the fleet at Chesme the\r\nCrimea became untenable and was abandoned to the brief mercies of\r\nRussia: and with a veiled Russian protectorate established in the\r\nDanubian principalities, and an open Russian occupation in Morean\r\nports, Constantinople had lost once more her own seas. When Selim III\r\nwas set on a tottering throne, in 1787, the wheel of Byzantine destiny\r\nseemed to have come again almost full circle: and the world was\r\nexpecting a Muscovite succession to that empire which had acknowledged\r\nalready the Roman, the Greek, and the Osmanli.\r\n\r\nCertainly history looked like repeating itself. As in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, so in the eighteenth, the imperial provinces, having shaken\r\noff almost all control of the capital, were administering themselves,\r\nand happier for doing so. Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt, and Trebizond\r\nacknowledged adventurers as virtually independent lords. Asia Minor, in\r\ngeneral, was being controlled, in like disregard of imperial majesty,\r\nby a group of ‘Dere Beys’, descended, in different districts, from\r\ntribal chieftains or privileged tax-farmers, or, often, from both. The\r\nlatter part of the eighteenth century was the heyday of the Anatolian\r\nfeudal families—of such as the Chapanoghlus of Yuzgad, whose sway\r\nstretched from Pontus to Cilicia, right across the base of the\r\npeninsula, or the Karamanoghlus of Magnesia, Bergama, and Aidin, who\r\nruled as much territory as the former emirs of Karasi and Sarukhan, and\r\nwere recognized by the representatives of the great trading companies\r\nas wielding the only effective authority in Smyrna. The wide and rich\r\nregions controlled by such families usually contributed neither an\r\n_asper_ to the sultan’s treasury nor a man to the imperial armies.\r\n\r\nOn no mountain of either Europe or Asia—and mountains formed a large\r\npart of the Ottoman empire in both—did the imperial writ run. Macedonia\r\nand Albania were obedient only to their local beys, and so far had gone\r\nthe devolution of Serbia and Bosnia to Janissary aghas, feudal beys,\r\nand the Beylerbey of Rumili, that these provinces hardly concerned\r\nthemselves more with the capital. The late sultan, Mustapha III, had\r\nlost almost the last remnant of his subjects’ respect, not so much by\r\nthe ill success of his mutinous armies as by his depreciation of the\r\nimperial coinage. He had died bankrupt of prestige, leaving no visible\r\nassets to his successor. What might become of the latter no one in the\r\nempire appeared to care. As in 1453, it waited other lords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n_Revival_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been waiting, nevertheless, ever since—waiting for much more\r\nthan a century; and perhaps the end is not even yet. Why, then, have\r\nexpectations not only within but without the empire been so greatly at\r\nfault? How came Montesquieu, Burke, and other confident prophets since\r\ntheir time to be so signally mistaken? There were several co-operating\r\ncauses, but one paramount. Constantinople was no longer, as in 1453, a\r\nmatter of concern only to itself, its immediate neighbours, and certain\r\ntrading republics of Italy. It had become involved with the commercial\r\ninterests of a far wider circle, in particular of the great trading\r\npeoples of western Europe, the British, the French, and the Dutch, and\r\nwith the political interests of the Germanic and Russian nations. None\r\nof these could be indifferent to a revolution in its fortunes, and\r\nleast of all to its passing, not to a power out of Asia, but to a rival\r\npower among themselves. Europe was already in labour with the doctrine\r\nof the Balance of Power. The bantling would not be born at Vienna till\r\nearly in the century to come: but even before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury it could be foreseen that its life would be bound up with the\r\nmaintenance of Constantinople in independence of any one of the parent\r\npowers—that is, with the prolongation of the Osmanli phase of its\r\nimperial fortunes. This doctrine, consistently acted upon by Europe,\r\nhas been the sheet anchor of the Ottoman empire for a century. Even to\r\nthis day its Moslem dynasty has never been without one powerful\r\nChristian champion or another.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some thirty years still to elapse after Selim’s\r\naccession before that doctrine was fully born: and had her hands been\r\nfree, Russia might well have been in secure possession of the Byzantine\r\nthrone long before 1815. For, internally, the Osmanli state went from\r\nbad to worse. The tumultuous insubordination of the Janissaries became\r\nan ever greater scandal. Never in all the long history of their riots\r\nwas their record for the years 1807-9 equalled or even approached.\r\nNever before, also, had the provinces been so utterly out of hand. This\r\nwas the era of Jezzar the Butcher at Acre, of the rise of Mehemet Ali\r\nin Egypt, of Ali Pasha in Epirus, and of Pasvanoghlu at Vidin. When\r\nMahmud II was thrust on to the throne in 1809, he certainly began his\r\nreign with no more personal authority and no more imperial prestige or\r\njurisdiction than the last Greek emperor had enjoyed on his accession\r\nin 1448.\r\n\r\nThe great European war, however, which had been raging intermittently\r\nfor nearly twenty years, had saved Mahmud an empire to which he could\r\nsucceed in name and try to give substance. Whatever the Osmanlis\r\nsuffered during that war, it undoubtedly kept them in Constantinople.\r\nTemporary loss of Egypt and the small damage done by the British attack\r\non Constantinople in 1807 were a small price to pay for the diversion\r\nof Russia’s main energies to other than Byzantine fields, and for the\r\nassurance, made doubly sure when the great enemy did again attack, that\r\nshe would not be allowed to settle the account alone. Whatever Napoleon\r\nmay have planned and signed at Tilsit, the aegis of France was\r\nconsistently opposed to the enemies of the Osmanlis down to the close\r\nof the Napoleonic age.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that those thirty perilous years passed without the\r\nexpected catastrophe. There was still a successor of Osman reigning in\r\nConstantinople when the great Christian powers, met in conclave at\r\nVienna, half unconsciously guaranteed the continued existence of the\r\nOsmanli Empire simply by leaving it out of account in striking a\r\nBalance of Power in Europe. Its European territory, with the capital\r\nwithin it, was of quite enough importance to disturb seriously the nice\r\nadjustment agreed at Vienna; and, therefore, while any one’s henceforth\r\nto take or leave, it would become always some one’s to guard. A few\r\nyears had yet to pass before the phrase, the Maintenance of the\r\nIntegrity of the Ottoman Empire, would be a watchword of European\r\ndiplomacy: but, whether formulated thus or not, that principle became a\r\nsure rock of defence for the Osmanli Empire on the birthday of the\r\ndoctrine of the Balance of Power.\r\n\r\nSecure from destruction by any foes but those of his own household, as\r\nnone knew better than he, the reigning Osmanli was scheming to regain\r\nthe independence and dignity of his forefathers. Himself a creature of\r\nthe Janissaries, Mahmud had plotted the abolition of his creators from\r\nthe first year of his reign, but making a too precipitate effort after\r\nthe conclusion of peace with Russia, had ignominiously failed and\r\nfallen into worse bondage than ever. Now, better assured of his\r\nimperial position and supported by leading men of all classes among his\r\nsubjects, he returned not only to his original enterprise but to\r\nschemes for removing other checks on the power of the sovereign which\r\nhad come into being in the last two centuries—notably the feudal\r\nindependence of the Dere Beys, and the irresponsibility of provincial\r\ngovernors.\r\n\r\nProbably Mahmud II—if he is to be credited with personal initiation of\r\nthe reforms always associated with his name—was not conscious of any\r\npurpose more revolutionary than that of becoming master in his own\r\nhouse, as his ancestors had been. What he ultimately accomplished,\r\nhowever, was something of much greater and more lasting moment to the\r\nOsmanli state. It was nothing less than the elimination of the most\r\nByzantine features in its constitution and government. The substitution\r\nof national forces for mercenary praetorians: the substitution of\r\ndirect imperial government of the provinces for devolution to\r\nseigneurs, tribal chiefs, and irresponsible officers: the substitution\r\nof direct collection for tax-farming: and the substitution of\r\nadministration by bureaucrats for administration by household\r\nofficers—these, the chief reforms carried through under Mahmud, were\r\nall anti-Byzantine. They did not cause the Osmanli state to be born\r\nanew, but, at least, they went far to purge it of original sin.\r\n\r\nThat Mahmud and his advisers could carry through such reforms at all in\r\nso old a body politic is remarkable: that they carried them through\r\namid the events of his reign is almost miraculous. One affront after\r\nanother was put on the Sultan, one blow after another was struck at his\r\nempire. Inspired by echoes of the French Revolution and by Napoleon’s\r\nrecognition of the rights of nationalities, first the Serbs and then\r\nthe Greeks seized moments of Ottoman disorder to rise in revolt against\r\ntheir local lords. The first, who had risen under Selim III, achieved,\r\nunder Mahmud, autonomy, but not independence, nothing remaining to the\r\nsultan as before except the fortress of Belgrade with five other\r\nstrongholds. The second, who began with no higher hopes than the Serbs,\r\nwere encouraged, by the better acquaintance and keener sympathy of\r\nEurope, to fight their way out to complete freedom. The Morea and\r\ncentral Greece passed out of the empire, the first provinces so to pass\r\nsince the Osmanli loss of Hungary. Yet it was in the middle of that\r\nfatal struggle that Mahmud settled for ever with the Janissaries, and\r\nduring all its course he was settling one after another with the Dere\r\nBeys!\r\n\r\nWhen he had thus sacrificed the flower of his professional troops and\r\nhad hardly had time to replace the local governments of the provinces\r\nby anything much better than general anarchy, he found himself faced by\r\na Russian assault. His raw levies fought as no other raw levies than\r\nthe Turkish can, and, helped by manifestations of jealousy by the other\r\npowers, staved off the capture of Constantinople, which, at one moment,\r\nseemed about to take place at last. But he had to accept humiliating\r\nterms, amounting virtually, to a cession of the Black Sea. Mahmud\r\nrecognized that such a price he must pay for crossing the broad stream\r\nbetween Byzantinism and Nationalism, and kept on his way.\r\n\r\nFinally came a blow at the hands of one of his own household and creed.\r\nMehemet Ali of Egypt, who had faithfully fought his sovereign’s battles\r\nin Arabia and the Morea, held his services ill requited and his claim\r\nto be increased beyond other pashas ignored, and proceeded to take what\r\nhad not been granted. He went farther than he had intended—more than\r\nhalf-way across Asia Minor—after the imperial armies had suffered three\r\nsignal defeats, before he extorted what he had desired at first: and in\r\nthe end, after very brief enjoyment, he had to resign all again to the\r\nmandate, not of his sovereign, but of certain European powers who\r\ncommanded his seas. Mahmud, however, who lived neither to see himself\r\nsaved by the _giaur_ fleets, nor even to hear of his latest defeat, had\r\ngone forward with the reorganization of the central and provincial\r\nadministration, undismayed by Mehemet Ali’s contumacy or the insistence\r\nof Russia at the gate of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nAs news arrived from time to time in the west of Mahmud’s disasters, it\r\nwas customary to prophesy the imminent dissolution of his empire. We,\r\nhowever, looking backward now, can see that by its losses the Osmanli\r\nstate in reality grew stronger. Each of its humiliations pledged some\r\npower or group of powers more deeply to support it: and before Mahmud\r\ndied, he had reason to believe that, so long as the European Concert\r\nshould ensue the Balance of Power, his dynasty would not be expelled\r\nfrom Constantinople. His belief has been justified. At every fresh\r\ncrisis of Ottoman fortunes, and especially after every fresh Russian\r\nattack, foreign protection has unfailingly been extended to his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, only in virtue of the increasing solicitude of the\r\npowers on its behalf that during the nineteenth century the empire was\r\ngrowing and would grow stronger, but also in virtue of certain assets\r\nwithin itself. First among these ranked the resources of its Asiatic\r\nterritories, which, as the European lands diminished, became more and\r\nmore nearly identified with the empire. When, having got rid of the old\r\narmy, Mahmud imposed service on all his Moslem subjects, in theory, but\r\nin effect only on the Osmanlis (not the Arabs, Kurds, or other half\r\nassimilated nomads and hillmen), it meant more than a similar measure\r\nwould have meant in a Christian empire. For, the life of Islam being\r\nwar, military service binds Moslems together and to their chiefs as it\r\nbinds men under no other dispensation; therefore Mahmud, so far as he\r\nwas able to enforce his decree, created not merely a national army but\r\na nation. His success was most immediate and complete in Anatolia, the\r\nhomeland of the Osmanlis. There, however, it was attained only by the\r\nprevious reduction of those feudal families which, for many\r\ngenerations, had arrogated to themselves the levying and control of\r\nlocal forces. Hence, as in Constantinople with the Janissaries, so in\r\nthe provinces with the Dere Beys, destruction of a drastic order had to\r\nprecede construction, and more of Mahmud’s reign had to be devoted to\r\nthe former than remained for the latter.\r\n\r\nHe did, however, live to see not only the germ of a nation emerge from\r\nchaos, but also the framework of an organization for governing it well\r\nor ill. The centralized bureaucracy which he succeeded in initiating\r\nwas, of course, wretchedly imperfect both in constitution and\r\nequipment. But it promised to promote the end he had in view and no\r\nother, inasmuch as, being the only existent machine of government, it\r\nderived any effective power it had from himself alone. Dependent on\r\nStambul, it served to turn thither the eyes and prayers of the\r\nprovincials. The naturally submissive and peaceful population of Asia\r\nMinor quickly accustomed itself to look beyond the dismantled\r\nstrongholds of its fallen beys. As for the rest— contumacious and\r\nbellicose beys and sheikhs of Kurdish hills and Syrian steppes—their\r\nhour of surrender was yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe eventual product of Mahmud’s persistency was the ‘Turkey’ we have\r\nseen in our own time—that Turkey irretrievably Asiatic in spirit under\r\na semi-European system of administration, which has governed\r\ndespotically in the interests of one creed and one class, with\r\nslipshod, makeshift methods, but has always governed, and little by\r\nlittle has extended its range. Knowing its imperfections and its\r\nweakness, we have watched with amazement its hand feeling forward none\r\nthe less towards one remote frontier district after another, painfully\r\nbut surely getting its grip, and at last closing on Turcoman chiefs and\r\nKurdish beys, first in the Anatolian and Cilician hills, then in the\r\nmountains of Armenia, finally in the wildest Alps of the Persian\r\nborderland. We have marked its stealthy movement into the steppes and\r\ndeserts of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia— now drawn back, now pushed\r\nfarther till it has reached and held regions over which Mahmud could\r\nclaim nothing but a suzerainty in name. To judge how far the shrinkage\r\nof the Osmanli European empire has been compensated by expansion of its\r\nAsiatic, one has only to compare the political state of Kurdistan, as\r\nit was at the end of the eighteenth century, and as it has been in our\r\nown time.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to believe that the Greek Empire, however buttressed\r\nand protected by foreign powers, could ever have reconstituted itself\r\nafter falling so low as it fell in the fourteenth century and as the\r\nOsmanli Empire fell in the eighteenth; and it is clear that the latter\r\nmust still have possessed latent springs of vitality, deficient in the\r\nformer. What can these have been? It is worth while to try to answer\r\nthis question at the present juncture, since those springs, if they\r\nexisted a hundred years ago, can hardly now be dry.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it had its predominant creed. This had acted as\r\nIslam acts everywhere, as a very strong social bond, uniting the vast\r\nmajority of subjects in all districts except certain parts of the\r\nEuropean empire, in instinctive loyalty to the person of the padishah,\r\nwhatever might be felt about his government. Thus had it acted with\r\nspecial efficacy in Asia Minor, whose inhabitants the Osmanli emperors,\r\nunlike the Greek, had always been at some pains to attach to\r\nthemselves. The sultan, therefore, could still count on general support\r\nfrom the population of his empire’s heart, and had at his disposal the\r\nresources of a country which no administration, however improvident or\r\nmalign, has ever been able to exhaust.\r\n\r\nIn the second place the Osmanli ‘Turks’, however fallen away from the\r\nvirtues of their ancestors, had not lost either ‘the will to power’ or\r\ntheir capacity for governing under military law. If they had never\r\nsucceeded in learning to rule as civilians they had not forgotten how\r\nto rule as soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the third place the sultanate of Stambul had retained a vague but\r\nvaluable prestige, based partly on past history, partly on its\r\npretension to religious influence throughout a much larger area than\r\nits proper dominions; and the conservative population of the latter was\r\nin great measure very imperfectly informed of its sovereign’s actual\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth and last place, among the populations on whose loyalty\r\nthe Osmanli sultan could make good his claim, were several strong\r\nunexhausted elements, especially in Anatolia. There are few more\r\nvigorous and enduring peoples than the peasants of the central plateau\r\nof Asia Minor, north, east, and south. With this rock of defence to\r\nstand upon, the sultan could draw also on the strength of other more\r\ndistant races, less firmly attached to himself, but not less vigorous,\r\nsuch, for example, as the Albanians of his European mountains and the\r\nKurds of his Asiatic. However decadent might be the Turco-Grecian\r\nOsmanli (he, unfortunately, had the lion’s share of office), those\r\nother elements had suffered no decline in physical or mental\r\ndevelopment. Indeed, one cannot be among them now without feeling that\r\ntheir day is not only not gone, but is still, for the most part, yet to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nSuch were latent assets of the Osmanli Empire, appreciated imperfectly\r\nby the prophets of its dissolution. Thanks to them, that empire\r\ncontinued not only to hold together throughout the nineteenth century\r\nbut, in some measure, to consolidate itself. Even when the protective\r\nfence, set up by European powers about it, was violated, as by Russia\r\nseveral times—in 1829, in 1854, and in 1877—the nation, which Mahmud\r\nhad made, always proved capable of stout enough resistance to delay the\r\nenemy till European diplomacy, however slow of movement, could come to\r\nits aid, and ultimately to dispose the victor to accept terms\r\nconsistent with its continued existence. It was an existence, of\r\ncourse, of sufferance, but one which grew better assured the longer it\r\nlasted. By an irony of the Osmanli position, the worse the empire was\r\nadministered, the stronger became its international guarantee. No\r\nbetter example can be cited than the effect of its financial follies.\r\nWhen national bankruptcy, long contemplated by its Government,\r\nsupervened at last, the sultan had nothing more to fear from Europe. He\r\nbecame, _ipso facto_, the cherished protégé of every power whose\r\nnationals had lent his country money.\r\n\r\nConsidering the magnitude of the change which Mahmud instituted, the\r\nstage at which he left it, and the character of the society in which it\r\nhad to be carried out, it was unfortunate that he should have been\r\nfollowed on the throne by two well-meaning weaklings, of whom the first\r\nwas a voluptuary, the second a fantastic spendthrift of doubtful\r\nsanity. Mahmud, as has been said, being occupied for the greater part\r\nof his reign in destroying the old order, had been able to reconstruct\r\nlittle more than a framework. His operations had been almost entirely\r\nforcible—of a kind understood by and congenial to the Osmanli\r\ncharacter—and partly by circumstances but more by his natural\r\nsympathies, he had been identified from first to last with military\r\nenterprises. Though he was known to contemplate the eventual supremacy\r\nof civil law, and the equality of all sorts and conditions of his\r\nsubjects before it, he did nothing to open this vista to public view.\r\nConsequently he encountered little or no factious opposition. Very few\r\nheld briefs for either the Janissaries or the Dere Beys; and fewer\r\nregretted them when they were gone. Osmanli society identified itself\r\nwith the new army and accepted the consequent reform of the central or\r\nprovincial administration. Nothing in these changes seemed to affect\r\nIslam or the privileged position of Moslems in the empire.\r\n\r\nIt was quite another matter when Abdul Mejid, in the beginning of his\r\nreign, promulgated an imperial decree—the famous Tanzimat or Hatti\r\nSherif of Gulkhaneh—which, amid many excellent and popular provisions\r\nfor the continued reform of the administration, proclaimed the equality\r\nof Christian and Moslem subjects in service, in reward, and before the\r\nlaw. The new sultan, essentially a civilian and a man of easy-going\r\ntemperament, had been induced to believe that the end of an evolution,\r\nwhich had only just begun, could be anticipated _per saltum_, and that\r\nhe and all his subjects would live happily together ever after. His\r\ncounsellors had been partly politicians, who for various reasons, good\r\nand bad, wished to gain West European sympathy for their country,\r\ninvolved in potential bondage to Russia since the Treaty of Unkiar\r\nSkelessi (1833), and recently afflicted by Ibrahim Pasha’s victory at\r\nNizib; and they looked to Great Britain to get them out of the Syrian\r\nmess. Partly also Abdul Mejid had been influenced by enthusiasts, who\r\nset more store by ideas or the phrases in which they were expressed,\r\nthan by the evidence of facts. There were then, as since, ‘young men in\r\na hurry’ among the more Europeanized Osmanlis. The net result of the\r\nsultan’s precipitancy was to set against himself and his policy all who\r\nwished that such it consummation of the reform process might never come\r\nand all who knew it would never come, if snatched at thus—that is, both\r\nthe ‘Old Turks’ and the moderate Liberals; and, further, to change for\r\nthe worse the spirit in which the new machine of government was being\r\nworked and in which fresh developments of it would be accepted.\r\n\r\nTo his credit, however, Abdul Mejid went on with administrative reform.\r\nThe organization of the army into corps—the foundation of the existing\r\nsystem—and the imposition of five years’ service on all subjects of the\r\nempire (in theory which an Albanian rising caused to be imperfectly\r\nrealized in fact), belong to the early part of his reign; as do also,\r\non the civil side, the institution of responsible councils of state and\r\nformation of ministries, and much provision for secondary education. To\r\nhis latest years is to be credited the codification of the civil law.\r\nHe had the advantage of some dozen initial years of comparative\r\nsecurity from external foes, after the Syrian question had been settled\r\nin his favour by Great Britain and her allied powers at the cheap price\r\nof a guarantee of hereditary succession to the house of Mehemet Ali.\r\nThanks to the same support, war with Persia was avoided and war with\r\nRussia postponed.\r\n\r\nBut the provinces, even if quiet (which some of them, e.g. the Lebanon\r\nin the early ‘forties’, were not), proved far from content. If the form\r\nof Osmanli government had changed greatly, its spirit had changed\r\nlittle, and defective communications militated against the\r\nresponsibility of officials to the centre. Money was scarce, and the\r\npaper currency—an ill-omened device of Mahmud’s—was depreciated,\r\ndistrusted, and regarded as an imperial betrayal of confidence.\r\nFinally, the hostility of Russia, notoriously unabated, and the\r\nencouragement of aspiring _rayas_ credited to her and other foreign\r\npowers made bad blood between creeds and encouraged opposition to the\r\nexecution of the pro-Christian Tanzimat. When Christian turbulence at\r\nlast brought on, in 1854, the Russian attack which developed into the\r\nCrimean War, and Christian allies, though they frustrated that attack,\r\nmade a peace by which the Osmanlis gained nothing, the latter were in\r\nno mood to welcome the repetition of the Tanzimat, which Abdul Mejid\r\nconsented to embody in the Treaty of Paris. The reign closed amid\r\nturbulence and humiliations—massacre and bombardment at Jidda, massacre\r\nand Franco-British coercion in Syria—from all of which the sultan took\r\nrefuge with women and wine, to meet in 1861 a drunkard’s end.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Abdul Aziz, had much the same intentions, the same\r\ncivilian sympathies, the same policy of Europeanization, and a\r\ndifferent, but more fatal, weakness of character. He was, perhaps,\r\nnever wholly sane; but his aberration, at first attested only by an\r\nexalted conviction of his divine character and inability to do wrong,\r\nexcited little attention until it began to issue in fantastic\r\nexpenditure. By an irony of history, he is the one Osmanli sultan upon\r\nthe roll of our Order of the Garter, the right to place a banner in St,\r\nGeorge’s Chapel having been offered to this Allah-possessed caliph on\r\nthe occasion of his visit to the West in 1867.\r\n\r\nDespite the good intentions of Abdul Aziz himself—as sincere as can be\r\ncredited to a disordered brain—-and despite more than one minister of\r\noutstanding ability, reform and almost everything else in the empire\r\nwent to the bad in this unhappy reign. The administration settled down\r\nto lifeless routine and lapsed into corruption: the national army was\r\nstarved: the depreciation of the currency grew worse as the revenue\r\ndeclined and the sultan’s household and personal extravagance\r\nincreased. Encouraged by the inertia of the imperial Government, the\r\nChristians of the European provinces waxed bold. Though Montenegro was\r\nseverely handled for contumacy, the Serbs were able to cover their\r\npenultimate stage towards freedom by forcing in 1867 the withdrawal of\r\nthe last Ottoman garrisons from their fortresses. Krete stood at bay\r\nfor three years and all but won her liberty. Bosnia rose in arms, but\r\ndivided against herself. Pregnant with graver trouble than these,\r\nBulgaria showed signs of waking from long sleep. In 1870 she obtained\r\nrecognition as a nationality in the Ottoman Empire, her Church being\r\ndetached from the control of the Oecumenical Patriarch of the Greeks\r\nand placed under an Exarch. Presently, her peasantry growing ever more\r\nrestive, passed from protest to revolt against the Circassian\r\nrefugee-colonists with whom the Porte was flooding the land. The\r\nsultan, in an evil hour, for lack of trained troops, let loose\r\nirregulars on the villages, and the Bulgarian atrocities, which they\r\ncommitted in 1875, sowed a fatal harvest for his successor to reap. His\r\nown time was almost fulfilled. The following spring a dozen high\r\nofficials, with the assent of the Sheikh-ul-Islam and the active\r\ndissent of no one, took Abdul Aziz from his throne to a prison, wherein\r\ntwo days later he perished, probably by his own hand. A puppet reigned\r\nthree months as Murad V, and then, at the bidding of the same\r\nking-makers whom his uncle had obeyed, left the throne free for his\r\nbrother Abdul Hamid, a man of affairs and ability, who was to be the\r\nmost conspicuous, or rather, the most notorious Osmanli sultan since\r\nSuleiman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n_Relapse_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new sultan, who had not expected his throne, found his realm in\r\nperilous case. Nominally sovereign and a member of the Concert of\r\nEurope, he was in reality a semi-neutralized dependant, existing, as an\r\nundischarged bankrupt, on sufferance of the powers. Should the Concert\r\nbe dissolved, or even divided, and any one of its members be left free\r\nto foreclose its Ottoman mortgages, the empire would be at an end.\r\nInternally it was in many parts in open revolt, in all the rest\r\nstagnant and slowly rotting. The thrice-foiled claimant to its\r\nsuccession, who six years before had denounced the Black Sea clause of\r\nthe Treaty of Paris and so freed its hands for offence, was manifestly\r\npreparing a fresh assault. Something drastic must be done; but what?\r\n\r\nThis danger of the empire’s international situation, and also the\r\ndisgrace of it, had been evident for some time past to those who had\r\nany just appreciation of affairs; and in the educated class, at any\r\nrate, something like a public opinion, very apprehensive and very much\r\nashamed, had struggled into being. The discovery of a leader in Midhat\r\nPasha, former governor-general of Bagdad, and a king-maker of recent\r\nnotoriety, induced the party of this opinion to take precipitate\r\naction. Murad had been deposed in August. Before the year was out\r\nMidhat presented himself before Abdul Hamid with a formal demand for\r\nthe promulgation of a Constitution, proposing not only to put into\r\nexecution the pious hopes of the two Hatti Sherifs of Abdul Mejid but\r\nalso to limit the sovereign and govern the empire by representative\r\ninstitutions. The new sultan, hardly settled on his uneasy throne,\r\ncould not deny those who had deposed his two predecessors, and,\r\nshrewdly aware that ripe facts would not be long in getting the better\r\nof immature ideas, accepted. A parliament was summoned; an electorate,\r\nwith only the haziest notions of what it was about, went through the\r\nform of sending representatives to Constantinople; and the sittings\r\nwere inaugurated by a speech from the throne, framed on the most\r\napproved Britannic model, the deputies, it is said, jostling and\r\ncrowding the while to sit, as many as possible, on the right, which\r\nthey understood was always the side of powers that be.\r\n\r\nIt is true this extemporized chamber never had a chance. The Russians\r\ncrossed the Pruth before it had done much more than verify its powers,\r\nand the thoughts and energies of the Osmanlis were soon occupied with\r\nthe most severe and disastrous struggle in which the empire had ever\r\nengaged. But it is equally certain that it could not have turned to\r\naccount any chance it might have had. Once more the ‘young men in a\r\nhurry’ had snatched at the end of an evolution hardly begun, without\r\ntaking into account the immaturity of Osmanli society in political\r\neducation and political capacity. After suspension during the war, the\r\nparliament was dissolved unregretted, and its creator was tried for his\r\nlife, and banished. In failing, however, Midhat left bad to become so\r\nmuch worse that the next reformers would inevitably have a more\r\nconvinced public opinion behind them, and he had virtually destroyed\r\nthe power of Mahmud’s bureaucracy. If the only immediate effect was the\r\nsubstitution of an unlimited autocracy, the Osmanli peoples would be\r\nable thenceforward to ascribe their misfortunes to a single person,\r\nmeditate attack, on a single position, and dream of realizing some day\r\nan ideal which had been definitely formulated.\r\n\r\nThe Russian onslaught, which began in both Europe and Asia in the\r\nspring of 1877, had been brought on, after a fashion become customary,\r\nby movements in the Slavonic provinces of the Ottoman Empire and in\r\nRumania; and the latter province, now independent in all but name and,\r\nin defiance of Ottoman protests, disposing of a regular army, joined\r\nthe invader. In campaigns lasting a little less than a year, the\r\nOsmanli Empire was brought nearer to passing than ever before, and it\r\nwas in a suburb of Constantinople itself that the final armistice was\r\narranged. But action by rival powers, both before the peace and in the\r\nrevision of it at Berlin, gave fresh assurance that the end would not\r\nbe suffered to come yet; and, moreover, through the long series of\r\ndisasters, much latent strength of the empire and its peoples had been\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nWhen that empire had emerged, shorn of several provinces—in Europe, of\r\nRumania, Serbia, and northern Greece, with Bulgaria also well on the\r\nroad they had travelled to emancipation, and in Asia, of a broad slice\r\nof Caucasia—Abdul Hamid cut his losses, and, under the new guarantee of\r\nthe Berlin Treaty, took heart to try his hand at reviving Osmanli\r\npower. He and his advisers had their idea, the contrary of the idea of\r\nMidhat and all the sultans since Mahmud. The empire must be made, not\r\nmore European, but more Asiatic. In the development of Islamic spirit\r\nto pan-Islamic unity it would find new strength; and towards this end\r\nin the early eighties, while he was yet comparatively young, with\r\nintelligence unclouded and courage sufficient, Abdul Hamid patiently\r\nset himself. In Asia, naturally sympathetic to autocracy, and the home\r\nof the faith of his fathers, he set on foot a pan-Islamic propaganda.\r\nHe exalted his caliphate; he wooed the Arabs, and he plotted with\r\nextraneous Moslems against whatever foreign government they might have\r\nto endure.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that this idea was based on the logic of facts,\r\nand, if it could be realized, promised better than Midhat’s for escape\r\nfrom shameful dependence. Indeed, Abdul Hamid, an autocrat bent on\r\nremaining one, could hardly have acted upon any other. By far the\r\ngreater part of the territorial empire remaining to him lay in Asia.\r\nThe little left in Europe would obviously soon be reduced to less. The\r\nBalkan lands were waking, or already awake, to a sense of separate\r\nnationality, and what chance did the Osmanli element, less progressive\r\nthan any, stand in them? The acceptance of the Ottoman power into the\r\nConcert of Europe, though formally notified to Abdul Mejid, had proved\r\nan empty thing. In that galley there was no place for a sultan except\r\nas a dependent or a slave. As an Asiatic power, however, exerting\r\ntemporal sway over some eighteen million bodies and religious influence\r\nover many times more souls, the Osmanli caliph might command a place in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe result belied these hopes. Abdul Hamid’s failure was owed in the\r\nmain to facts independent of his personality or statecraft. The\r\nexpansion of Islam over an immense geographical area and among peoples\r\nliving in incompatible stages of sophistication, under most diverse\r\npolitical and social conditions, has probably made any universal\r\ncaliphial authority for ever impossible. The original idea of the\r\ncaliphate, like that of the _jehad_ or holy war of the faithful,\r\npresupposed that all Moslems were under governments of their own creed,\r\nand, perhaps, under one government. Moreover, if such a caliph were\r\never to be again, an Osmanli sultan would not be a strong candidate.\r\nApart from the disqualification of his blood, he being not of the\r\nProphet’s tribe nor even an Arab, he is lord of a state irretrievably\r\ncompromised in purist eyes (as Wahabis and Senussis have testified once\r\nand again) by its Byzantine heritage of necessary relations with\r\ninfidels. Abdul Hamid’s predecessors for two centuries or more had been\r\nat no pains to infuse reality into their nominal leadership of the\r\nfaithful. To call a real caliphate out of so long abeyance could hardly\r\nhave been effected even by a bold soldier, who appealed to the general\r\nimagination of Moslems; and certainly was beyond the power of a timid\r\ncivilian.\r\n\r\nWhen Abdul Hamid had played this card and failed, he had no other; and\r\nhis natural pusillanimity and shiftiness induced him to withdraw ever\r\nmore into the depths of his palace, and there use his intelligence in\r\nexploiting this shameful dependence of his country on foreign powers.\r\nUnable or unwilling to encourage national resistance, he consoled\r\nhimself, as a weak malcontent will, by setting one power against\r\nanother, pin-pricking the stronger and blustering to the weaker. The\r\nhistory of his reign is a long record of protests and surrenders to the\r\ngreat in big matters, as to Great Britain in the matter of Egypt in\r\n1881, to Russia in that of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, to France on the\r\nquestion of the Constantinople quays and other claims, and to all the\r\npowers in 1881 in the matter of the financial control. Between times he\r\nput in such pin-pricks as he could, removing his neighbours’ landmarks\r\nin the Aden _hinterland_ or the Sinaitic peninsula. He succeeded,\r\nhowever, in keeping his empire out of a foreign war with any power for\r\nabout thirty years, with the single exception of a brief conflict with\r\nGreece in 1897. While in the first half of his reign he was at pains to\r\nmake no European friend, in the latter he fell more and more under the\r\ninfluence of Germany, which, almost from the accession of Kaiser\r\nWilhelm II, began to prepare a southward way for future use, and alone\r\nof the powers, never browbeat the sultan.\r\n\r\nInternally, the empire passed more and more under the government of the\r\nimperial household. Defeated by the sheer geographical difficulty of\r\ncontrolling directly an area so vast and inadequately equipped with\r\nmeans of communication, Abdul Hamid soon relaxed the spasmodic efforts\r\nof his early years to better the condition of his subjects; and,\r\nuncontrolled and demoralized by the national disgrace, the\r\nadministration went from bad to much worse. Ministers irresponsible;\r\nofficials without sense of public obligation; venality in all ranks;\r\nuniversal suspicion and delation; violent remedies, such as the\r\nArmenian massacres of 1894, for diseases due to neglect; the peasantry,\r\nwhether Moslem or Christian, but especially Christian, forced\r\nultimately to liquidate all accounts; impoverishment of the whole\r\nempire by the improvidence and oppression of the central power— such\r\nphrasing of the conventional results of ‘Palace’ government expresses\r\ninadequately the fruits of Yildiz under Abdul Hamid II.\r\n\r\n_Pari passu_ with this disorder of central and provincial\r\nadministration increased the foreign encroachments on the empire. The\r\nnation saw not only rapid multiplication of concessions and\r\nhypothecations to aliens, and of alien persons themselves installed in\r\nits midst under extra-territorial immunity from its laws, secured by\r\nthe capitulations, but also whole provinces sequestered, administered\r\nindependently of the sultan’s government, and prepared for eventual\r\nalienation. Egypt, Tunisia, Eastern Rumelia, Krete—these had all been\r\nwithdrawn from Ottoman control since the Berlin settlement, and now\r\nMacedonia seemed to be going the same way. Bitter to swallow as the\r\nother losses had been—pills thinly sugared with a guarantee of\r\nsuzerainty—the loss of Macedonia would be more bitter still; for, if it\r\nwere withdrawn from Ottoman use and profit, Albania would follow and so\r\nwould the command of the north Aegean and the Adriatic shores; while an\r\nancient Moslem population would remain at Christian mercy.\r\n\r\nIt was partly Ottoman fault, partly the fault of circumstances beyond\r\nOttoman control, that this district had become a scandal and a\r\nreproach. In the days of Osmanli greatness Macedonia had been neglected\r\nin favour of provinces to the north, which were richer and more nearly\r\nrelated to the ways into central Europe. When more attention began to\r\nbe paid to it by the Government, it had already become a cockpit for\r\nthe new-born Christian nationalities, which had been developed on the\r\nnorth, east, and south. These were using every weapon, material and\r\nspiritual, to secure preponderance in its society, and had created\r\nchronic disorder which the Ottoman administration now weakly encouraged\r\nto save itself trouble, now violently dragooned. Already the powers had\r\nnot only proposed autonomy for it, but begun to control its police and\r\nits finance. This was the last straw. The public opinion which had\r\nslowly been forming for thirty years gained the army, and Midhat’s seed\r\ncame to fruit.\r\n\r\nBy an irony of fate Macedonia not only supplied the spectacle which\r\nexasperated the army to revolt, but by its very disorder made the\r\npreparation of that revolt possible; for it was due to local\r\nlimitations of Ottoman sovereignty that the chief promoters of\r\nrevolution were able to conspire in safety. By another irony, two of\r\nthe few progressive measures ever encouraged by Abdul Hamid contributed\r\nto his undoing. If he had not sent young officers to be trained abroad,\r\nthe army, the one Ottoman institution never allowed wholly to decay,\r\nwould have remained outside the conspiracy. If he had never promoted\r\nthe construction of railways, as he began to do after 1897, the\r\nSalonika army could have had no such influence on affairs in\r\nConstantinople as it exerted in 1908 and again in 1909. As it was, the\r\nsultan, at a mandate from Resna in Macedonia, re-enacted Midhat’s\r\nConstitution, and, a year later, saw an army from Salonika arrive to\r\nuphold that Constitution against the reaction he had fostered, and to\r\nsend him, dethroned and captive, to the place whence itself had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n_Revolution_\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back on this revolution across seven years of its consequences,\r\nwe see plainly enough that it was inspired far less by desire for\r\nhumane progress than by shame of Osmanli military decline. The\r\n‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity’ programme which its authors put forward\r\n(a civilian minority among them, sincerely enough), Europe accepted,\r\nand the populace of the empire acted upon for a moment, did not express\r\nthe motive of the movement or eventually guide its course. The essence\r\nof that movement was militant nationalism. The empire was to be\r\nregenerated, not by humanizing it but by Ottomanizing it. The Osmanli,\r\nthe man of the sword, was the type to which all others, who wished to\r\nbe of the nation, were to conform. Such as did not so wish must be\r\neliminated by the rest.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary Committee in Salonika, called ‘of Union and\r\nProgress’, held up its cards at first, but by 1910 events had forced\r\nits hand on the table. The definite annexation of Bosnia and\r\nHercegovina by Austria-Hungary in 1908, and the declaration of\r\nindependence and assumption of the title Tsar by the ruler of Bulgaria,\r\nsince they were the price to be paid by the revolutionaries for a\r\nsuccess largely made in Germany, were opposed officially only _pro\r\nforma_; but when uninformed opinion in the empire was exasperated\r\nthereby against Christendom, the Committee, to appease reactionaries,\r\nhad to give premature proof of pan-Osmanli and pro-Moslem intentions by\r\ntaking drastic action against _rayas_. The Greeks of the empire, never\r\nwithout suspicions, had failed to testify the same enthusiasm for\r\nOttoman fraternity which others, e.g. the Armenians, had shown; now\r\nthey resumed their separatist attitude, and made it clear that they\r\nstill aspired, not to Ottoman, but to Hellenic nationality. Nor were\r\neven the Moslems of the empire unanimous for fraternity among\r\nthemselves. The Arab-speaking societies complained of\r\nunder-representation in the councils and offices of the state, and made\r\nno secret of their intention not to be assimilated by the Turk-speaking\r\nOsmanlis. To all suggestions, however, of local home-rule and\r\nconciliation of particularist societies in the empire, the Committee\r\nwas deaf. Without union, it believed in no progress, and by union it\r\nunderstood the assimilation of all societies in the empire to the\r\nOsmanli.\r\n\r\nLogic was on the side of the Committee in its choice of both end and\r\nmeans. In pan-Ottomanism, if it could be effected, lay certainly the\r\nsingle chance of restoring Osmanli independence and power to anything\r\nlike the position they had once held. In rule by a militarist oligarchy\r\nfor some generations to come, lay the one hope of realizing the\r\npan-Ottoman idea and educating the resultant nation to self-government.\r\nThat end, however, it was impossible to realize under the circumstances\r\nin which past history had involved the Ottoman Empire. There was too\r\nmuch bad blood between different elements of its society which Osmanli\r\nrulers had been labouring for centuries rather to keep apart than to\r\nunite; and certain important elements, both Moslem and Christian, had\r\nalready developed too mature ideas of separate nationality. With all\r\nits defects, however, the new order did undoubtedly rest on a wider\r\nbasis than the old, and its organization was better conceived and\r\nexecuted. It retained some of the sympathy of Europe which its\r\nbeginnings had excited, and the western powers, regarding its\r\nrepresentative institutions as earnests of good government, however ill\r\nthey might work at the first, were disposed to give it every chance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Young Turks were in a hurry to bring on their\r\nmillennium, and careless of certain neighbouring powers, not formidable\r\nindividually but to be reckoned with if united, to whom the prospect of\r\nregenerated Osmanlis assimilating their nationals could not be welcome.\r\nHad the Young Turks been content to put their policy of Ottomanization\r\nin the background for awhile, had they made no more than a show of\r\naccepting local distinctions of creed and politics, keeping in the\r\nmeantime a tight rein on the Old Turks, they might long have avoided\r\nthe union of those neighbours, and been in a better position to resist,\r\nshould that union eventually be arrayed against themselves.\r\n\r\nBut a considerable and energetic element among them belonged to the\r\nnervous Levantine type of Osmanli, which is as little minded to\r\ncompromise as any Old Turk, though from a different motive. It elected\r\nto deal drastically and at once with Macedonia, the peculiar object not\r\nonly of European solicitude but also of the interest of Bulgaria,\r\nSerbia, and Greece. If ever a province required delicate handling it\r\nwas this. It did not get it. The interested neighbours, each beset by\r\nfugitives of its oppressed nationals, protested only to be ignored or\r\nbrowbeaten. They drew towards one another; old feuds and jealousies\r\nwere put on one side; and at last, in the summer of 1912, a Holy League\r\nof Balkan States, inspired by Venezelos, the new Kretan Prime Minister\r\nof Greece, and by Ferdinand of Bulgaria, was formed with a view to\r\ncommon action against the oppressor of Greek, Serbian, and Bulgarian\r\nnationals in Macedonia. Montenegro, always spoiling for a fight, was\r\ndeputed to fire the train, and at the approach of autumn the first\r\nBalkan war blazed up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n_Balkan War_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of the struggle is described elsewhere in this volume. Its\r\nevent illustrates the danger of an alliance succeeding beyond the\r\nexpectations in which it was formed. The constituent powers had looked\r\nfor a stiff struggle with the Ottoman armies, but for final success\r\nsufficient to enable them, at the best, to divide Macedonia among\r\nthemselves, at the worst, to secure its autonomy under international\r\nguarantee. Neither they nor any one else expected such an Ottoman\r\ncollapse as was in store. Their moment of attack was better chosen than\r\nthey knew. The Osmanli War Office was caught fairly in the middle of\r\nthe stream. Fighting during the revolution, subsequently against\r\nAlbanians and other recalcitrant provincials, and latterly against the\r\nItalians, who had snatched at Tripoli the year before, had reduced the\r\n_Nizam_, the first line of troops, far below strength. The _Redif_, the\r\nsecond line, had received hardly more training, thanks to the\r\ndisorganization of Abdul Hamid’s last years and of the first years of\r\nthe new order, than the _Mustafuz_, the third and last line. Armament,\r\nauxiliary services, and the like had been disorganized preparatory to a\r\nscheme for thorough reorganization, which had been carried, as yet, but\r\na very little way. A foreign (German) element, introduced into the\r\ncommand, had had time to impair the old spirit of Ottoman soldiers, but\r\nnot to create a new one. The armies sent against the Bulgarians in\r\nThrace were so many mobs of various arms; those which met the Serbs, a\r\nlittle better; those which opposed the Greeks, a little worse.\r\n\r\nIt followed that the Bulgarians, who had proposed to do no more in\r\nThrace than block Adrianople and immobilize the Constantinople forces,\r\nwere carried by their own momentum right down to Chataldja, and there\r\nand at Adrianople had to prosecute siege operations when they ought to\r\nhave been marching to Kavala and Salonika. The Serbs, after hard\r\nfighting, broke through not only into Macedonia but into Albania, and\r\nreached the Adriatic, but warned off this by the powers, consoled\r\nthemselves with the occupation of much more Macedonian territory than\r\nthe concerted plans of the allies had foreseen. The Greeks, instead of\r\nhard contests for the Haliacmon Valley and Epirus—their proper\r\nIrredenta—pushed such weak forces before them that they got through to\r\nSalonika just in time to forestall a Bulgarian column. Ottoman collapse\r\nwas complete everywhere, except on the Chataldja front. It remained to\r\ndivide the spoil. Serbia might not have Adriatic Albania, and therefore\r\nwanted as much Macedonia as she had actually overrun. Greece wanted the\r\nrest of Macedonia and had virtually got it. Remained Bulgaria who, with\r\nmore of Thrace than she wanted, found herself almost entirely crowded\r\nout of Macedonia, the common objective of all.\r\n\r\nFaced with division _ex post facto_, the allies found their _a priori_\r\nagreement would not resolve the situation. Bulgaria, the predominant\r\npartner and the most aggrieved, would neither recognize the others’\r\nrights of possession nor honestly submit her claims to the only\r\npossible arbiter, the Tsar of Russia. Finding herself one against two,\r\nshe tried a _coup de main_ on both fronts, failed, and brought on a\r\nsecond Balkan war, in which a new determining factor, Rumania,\r\nintervened at a critical moment to decide the issue against her. The\r\nOttoman armies recovered nearly all they had lost in eastern and\r\ncentral Thrace, including Adrianople, almost without firing a shot, and\r\nwere not ill pleased to be quit of a desperate situation at the price\r\nof Macedonia, Albania, and western Thrace.\r\n\r\nDefeated and impoverished, the Ottoman power came out of the war\r\nclinging to a mere remnant of its European empire—one single mutilated\r\nprovince which did not pay its way. With the lost territories had gone\r\nabout one-eighth of the whole population and one-tenth of the total\r\nimperial revenue. But when these heavy losses had been cut, there was\r\nnothing more of a serious nature to put to debit, but a little even to\r\ncredit. Ottoman prestige had suffered but slightly in the eyes of the\r\npeople. The obstinate and successful defence of the Chataldja lines and\r\nthe subsequent recovery of eastern Thrace with Adrianople, the first\r\nEuropean seat of the Osmanlis, had almost effaced the sense of Osmanli\r\ndisgrace, and stood to the general credit of the Committee and the\r\nindividual credit of its military leader, Enver Bey. The loss of some\r\nthousands of soldiers and much material was compensated by an\r\ninvaluable lesson in the faultiness of the military system, and\r\nespecially the _Redif_ organization. The way was now clearer than\r\nbefore for re-making the army on the best European model, the German.\r\nThe campaign had not been long, nor, as wars go, costly to wage. In the\r\npeace Turkey gained a new lease of life from the powers, and,\r\nprofligate that she was, the promise of more millions of foreign money.\r\n\r\nOver and above all this an advantage, which she rated above\r\ninternational guarantees, was secured to her—the prospective support of\r\nthe strongest military power in Europe. The success of Serbia so\r\nmenaced Germano-Austrian plans for the penetration of the Balkans, that\r\nthe Central Powers were bound to woo Turkey even more lavishly than\r\nbefore, and to seek alliance where they had been content with\r\ninfluence. In a strong Turkey resided all their hope of saving from the\r\nSlavs the way to the Mediterranean. They had kept this policy in view\r\nfor more than twenty years, and in a hundred ways, by introduction of\r\nGermans into the military organization, promotion of German financial\r\nenterprise, pushing of German commerce, pressure on behalf of German\r\nconcessions which would entail provincial influence (for example, the\r\nconstruction of a transcontinental railway in Asia), those powers had\r\nbeen manifesting their interest in Turkey with ever-increasing\r\nsolicitude. Now they must attach her to themselves with hoops of steel\r\nand, with her help, as soon as might be, try to recast the Balkan\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the recent war and the prospect in the future made\r\ncontinuance and accentuation of military government in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire inevitable. The Committee, which had made its way back to power\r\nby violent methods, now suppressed its own Constitution almost as\r\ncompletely as Abdul Hamid had suppressed Midhat’s parliament.\r\nRe-organization of the military personnel, accumulation of war\r\nmaterial, strengthening of defences, provision of arsenals, dockyards,\r\nand ships, together with devices for obtaining money to pay for all\r\nthese things, make Ottoman history for the years 1912-14. The bond with\r\nGermany was drawn lighter. More German instructors were invited, more\r\nGerman engineers commissioned, more munitions of war paid for in French\r\ngold. By 1914 it had become so evident that the Osmanlis must array\r\nthemselves with Austro-Germany in any European war, that one wonders\r\nwhy a moment’s credit was ever given to their protestations of\r\nneutrality when that war came at last in August 1914. Turkey then\r\nneeded other three months to complete her first line of defences and\r\nmobilize. These were allowed to her, and in the late autumn she entered\r\nthe field against Great Britain, France, and Russia, armed with German\r\nguns, led by German officers, and fed with German gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n_The Future_\r\n\r\n\r\nTurkey’s situation, therefore, in general terms has become this. With\r\nthe dissolution of the Concert of Europe the Ottoman Empire has lost\r\nwhat had been for a century its chief security for continued existence.\r\nIts fate now depends on that of two European powers which are at war\r\nwith the rest of the former Concert. Among the last named are Turkey’s\r\ntwo principal creditors, holding together about seventy-five per cent.\r\nof her public debt. In the event of the defeat of her friends, these\r\ncreditors will be free to foreclose, the debtor being certainly in no\r\nposition to meet her obligations. Allied with Christian powers, the\r\nOsmanli caliph has proved no more able than his predecessors to unite\r\nIslam in his defence; but, for what his title is worth, Mohammed V is\r\nstill caliph, no rival claim having been put forward. The loyalty of\r\nthe empire remains where it was, pending victory or defeat, the\r\nprovinces being slow to realize, and still slower to resent, the\r\ndisastrous economic state to which the war is reducing them.\r\n\r\nThe present struggle may leave the Osmanli Empire in one of three\r\nsituations: (1) member of a victorious alliance, reinforced, enlarged,\r\nand lightened of financial burdens, as the wages of its sin; (2) member\r\nof a defeated alliance, bound to pay the price of blood in loss of\r\nterritory, or independence, or even existence; (3) party to a\r\ncompromise under which its territorial empire might conceivably remain\r\nOttoman, but under even stricter European tutelage than of old.\r\n\r\nThe first alternative it would be idle to discuss, for the result of\r\nconditions so novel are impossible to foresee. Nor, indeed, when\r\nimmediate events are so doubtful an at the present moment, is it\r\nprofitable to attempt to forecast the ultimate result of any of the\r\nalternatives. Should, however, either the second or the third become\r\nfact, certain general truths about the Osmanlis will govern the\r\nconsequences; and these must be borne in mind by any in whose hands the\r\ndisposal of the empire may lie.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Osmanlis in their empire to-day resides in three\r\nthings: first, in their possession of Constantinople; second, in the\r\nsultan’s caliphate and his guardianship of the holy cities of Islam;\r\nthird, in certain qualities of Osmanli character, notably ‘will to\r\npower’ and courage in the field.\r\n\r\nWhat Constantinople means for the Osmanlis is implied in that name\r\n_Roum_ by which the western dominions of the Turks have been known ever\r\nsince the Seljuks won Asia Minor. Apart from the prestige of their own\r\nearly conquests, the Osmanlis inherited, and in a measure retain in the\r\nNear East, the traditional prestige of the greatest empire which ever\r\nheld it. They stand not only for their own past but also for whatever\r\nstill lives of the prestige of Rome. Theirs is still the repute of the\r\nimperial people _par excellence_, chosen and called to rule.\r\n\r\nThat this repute should continue, after the sweeping victories of\r\nSemites and subsequent centuries of Ottoman retreat before other heirs\r\nof Rome, is a paradox to be explained only by the fact that a large\r\npart of the population of the Near East remains at this day in about\r\nthe same stage of civilization and knowledge as in the time of, say,\r\nHeraclius. The Osmanlis, be it remembered, were and are foreigners in a\r\ngreat part of their Asiatic empire equally with the Greeks of Byzantium\r\nor the Romans of Italy; and their establishment in Constantinople\r\nnearly five centuries ago did not mean to the indigenous peoples of the\r\nNear East what it meant to Europe—a victory of the East over the\r\nWest—so much as a continuation of immemorial ‘Roman’ dominion still\r\nexercised from the same imperial centre. Since Rome first spread its\r\nshadow over the Near East, many men of many races, whose variety was\r\nimperfectly realised, if realised at all, by the peasants of Asia\r\nMinor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, have ruled in its name; the\r\nOsmanlis, whose governmental system was in part the Byzantine, made but\r\none more change which meant the same old thing. The peasants know, of\r\ncourse, about those Semitic victories; but they know also that if the\r\nSemite has had his day of triumph and imposed, as was right and proper,\r\nhis God and his Prophet on Roum—even on all mankind as many believed,\r\nand some may be found in remoter regions who still believe—he has\r\nreturned to his own place south of Taurus; and still Roum is Roum,\r\nnatural indefeasible Lord of the World.\r\n\r\nSuch a belief is dying now, of course; but it dies slowly and hard. It\r\nstill constitutes a real asset of the Osmanlis, and will not cease to\r\nhave value until they lose Constantinople. On the possession of the old\r\nimperial city it depends for whatever vitality it has. You may\r\ndemonstrate, as you will, and as many publicists have done since the\r\nBalkan War and before, what and how great economic, political, and\r\nsocial advantages would accrue to the Osmanlis, if they could bring\r\nthemselves to transfer their capital to Asia. Here they would be rid of\r\nRumelia, which costs, and will always cost them, more than it yields.\r\nHere they could concentrate Moslems where their co-religionists are\r\nalready the great majority, and so have done with the everlasting\r\nfriction and weakness entailed in jurisdiction over preponderant\r\nChristian elements. Here they might throw off the remnants of their\r\nByzantinism as a garment and, no longer forced to face two ways, live\r\nand govern with single minds as the Asiatics they are.\r\n\r\nVain illusion, as Osmanli imperialists know! It is their empire that\r\nwould fall away as a garment so soon as the Near East realized that\r\nthey no longer ruled in the Imperial City. Enver Pasha and the\r\nCommittee were amply justified in straining the resources of the\r\nOttoman Empire to cracking-point, not merely to retain Constantinople\r\nbut also to recover Adrianople and a territory in Europe large enough\r\nto bulk as Roum. Nothing that happened in that war made so greatly for\r\nthe continuation of the old order in Asiatic Turkey as the reoccupation\r\nof Adrianople. The one occasion on which Europeans in Syria had reason\r\nto expect a general explosion was when premature rumours of the entry\r\nof the Bulgarian army into Stambul gained currency for a few hours.\r\nThat explosion, had the news proved true or not been contradicted in\r\ntime, would have been a panic-stricken, ungovernable impulse of\r\nanarchy—of men conscious that an old world had passed away and ignorant\r\nwhat conceivable new world could come to be.\r\n\r\nBut the perilous moment passed, to be succeeded by general diffusion of\r\na belief that the inevitable catastrophe was only postponed. In the\r\nbreathing-time allowed, Arabs, Kurds, and Armenians discussed and\r\nplanned together revolt from the moribund Osmanli, and, separately, the\r\nmutual massacre and plundering of one another. Arab national\r\norganizations and nationalist journals sprang to life at Beirut and\r\nelsewhere. The revival of Arab empire was talked of, and names of\r\npossible capitals and kings were bandied about. One Arab province, the\r\nHasa, actually broke away. Then men began to say that the Bulgarians\r\nwould not advance beyond Chataldja: the Balkan States were at war among\r\nthemselves: finally, Adrianople had been re-occupied. And all was as in\r\nthe beginning. Budding life withered in the Arab movement, and the Near\r\nEast settled down once more in the persistent shadow of Roum.\r\n\r\nSuch is the first element in Osmanli prestige, doomed to disappear the\r\nmoment that the Ottoman state relinquishes Europe. Meanwhile there it\r\nis for what it is worth; and it is actually worth a tradition of\r\nsubmission, natural and honourable, to a race of superior destiny,\r\nwhich is instinctive in some millions of savage simple hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat of the second element? The religious prestige of the Ottoman power\r\nas the repository of caliphial authority and trustee for Islam in the\r\nHoly Land of Arabia, is an asset almost impossible to estimate. Would a\r\ndeath struggle of the Osmanlis in Europe rouse the Sunni world? Would\r\nthe Moslems of India, Afghanistan, Turkestan, China, and Malaya take up\r\narms for the Ottoman sultan as caliph? Nothing but the event will prove\r\nthat they would. Jehad, or Holy War, is an obsolescent weapon difficult\r\nand dangerous for Young Turks to wield: difficult because their own\r\nIslamic sincerity is suspect and they are taking the field now as\r\nclients of _giaur_ peoples; dangerous because the Ottoman nation itself\r\nincludes numerous Christian elements, indispensable to its economy.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, however, the Ottoman sultanate can count on its religious\r\nprestige appealing widely, overriding counteracting sentiments, and, if\r\nit rouses to action, rousing the most dangerous temper of all. It is\r\nfutile to ignore the caliph because he is not of the Koreish, and owes\r\nhis dignity to a sixteenth-century transfer. These facts are either\r\nunknown or not borne in mind by half the Sunnites on whom he might\r\ncall, and weigh far less with the other half than his hereditary\r\ndominion over the Holy Cities, sanctioned by the prescription of nearly\r\nfour centuries.\r\n\r\nOne thing can be foretold with certainty. The religious prestige of an\r\nOttoman sultan, who had definitely lost control of the Holy Places,\r\nwould cease as quickly and utterly as the secular prestige of one who\r\nhad evacuated Constantinople: and since the loss of the latter would\r\nprobably precipitate an Arab revolt, and cut off the Hejaz, the\r\nreligious element in Ottoman prestige may be said to depend on\r\nConstantinople as much as the secular. All the more reason why the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress should not have accepted that\r\nwell-meant advice of European publicists! A successful revolt of the\r\nArab-speaking provinces would indeed sound the death-knell of the\r\nOttoman Empire. No other event would be so immediately and surely\r\ncatastrophic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third element in Osmanli prestige, inherent qualities of the\r\nOsmanli ‘Turk’ himself, will be admitted by every one who knows him and\r\nhis history. To say that he has the ‘will to power’ is not, however, to\r\nsay that he has an aptitude for government. He wishes to govern others;\r\nhis will to do so imposes itself on peoples who have not the same will;\r\nthey give way to him and he governs them indifferently, though often\r\nbetter than they can govern themselves. For example, bad as, according\r\nto our standards, Turkish government is, native Arab government, when\r\nnot in tutelage to Europeans, has generally proved itself worse, when\r\ntried in the Ottoman area in modern times. Where it is of a purely\r\nBedawi barbaric type, as in the emirates of central Arabia, it does\r\nwell enough; but if the population be contaminated ever so little with\r\nnon-Arab elements, practices, or ideas, Arab administration seems\r\nincapable of producing effective government. It has had chances in the\r\nHoly Cities at intervals, and for longer periods in the Yemen. But a\r\nEuropean, long resident in the latter country, who has groaned under\r\nTurkish administration, where it has always been most oppressive, bore\r\nwitness that the rule of the native Imam only served to replace\r\noppressive government by oppressive anarchy.\r\n\r\nAs for the Osmanli’s courage as a fighting man, that has often been\r\nexemplified, and never better than in the Gallipoli peninsula. It is\r\nadmitted. The European and Anatolian Osmanlis yield little one to the\r\nother in this virtue; but the palm, if awarded at all, must be given to\r\nthe levies from northern and central Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Constantinople should be lost, the Arab-speaking parts of the empire\r\nwould in all likelihood break away, carrying the Holy Cities with them.\r\nWhen the constant risk of this consummation, with the cataclysmic\r\nnature of its consequences is considered, one marvels why the\r\nCommittee, which has shown no mean understanding of some conditions\r\nessential to Osmanli empire, should have done so little hitherto to\r\nconciliate Arab susceptibilities. Neither in the constitution of the\r\nparliament nor in the higher commands of the army have the\r\nArab-speaking peoples been given anything like their fair share; and\r\nloudly and insistently have they protested. Perhaps the Committee,\r\nwhose leading members are of a markedly Europeanized type, understands\r\nAsia less well than Europe. Certainly its programme of Ottomanization,\r\nelaborated by military ex-attachés, by Jew bankers and officials from\r\nSalonika, and by doctors, lawyers, and other _intellectuels_ fresh from\r\nParis, was conceived on lines which offered the pure Asiatic very\r\nlittle scope. The free and equal Osmanlis were all to take their cue\r\nfrom men of the Byzantine sort which the European provinces, and\r\nespecially the city of Constantinople, breed. After the revolution,\r\nnothing in Turkey struck one so much as the apparition on the top of\r\nthings everywhere of a type of Osmanli who has the characteristic\r\nqualities of the Levantine Greek. Young officers, controlling their\r\nelders, only needed a change of uniform to pass in an Athenian crowd.\r\nSpare and dapper officials, presiding in seats of authority over Kurds\r\nand Arabs, reminded one of Greek journalists. Osmanli journalists\r\nthemselves treated one to rhodomontades punctuated with restless\r\ngesticulation, which revived memories of Athenian cafés in war-time. It\r\nwas the Byzantine triumphing over the Asiatic; and the most Asiatic\r\nelements in the empire were the least likely to meet with the\r\nappreciation or sympathy of the Byzantines.\r\n\r\nAre the Arab-speaking peoples, therefore, likely to revolt, or be\r\nsuccessful in splitting the Ottoman Empire, if they do? The present\r\nwriter would like to say, in parenthesis, that, in his opinion, this\r\nconsummation of the empire is not devoutly to be wished. The\r\nsubstitution of Arab administration for Osmanli would necessarily\r\nentail European tutelage of the parts of the Arab-speaking area in\r\nwhich powers, like ourselves, have vital interests—Syria, for example,\r\nsouthern Mesopotamia, and, probably, Hejaz. The last named, in\r\nparticular, would involve us in so ticklish and thankless a task, that\r\none can only be thankful for the Turkish caretaker there to-day, and\r\nloth to see him dismissed.\r\n\r\nAn Arab revolt, however, might break out whether the Triple Entente\r\ndesired its success or not. What chance of success would it have? The\r\npeoples of the Arab part of the Ottoman Empire are a congeries of\r\ndiffering races, creeds, sects, and social systems, with no common bond\r\nexcept language. The physical character of their land compels a good\r\nthird of them to be nomadic, predatory barbarians, feared by the other\r\ntwo-thirds. The settled folk are divided into Moslem and Christian (not\r\nto mention a large Jewish element), the cleavage being more abrupt than\r\nin western Turkey and the tradition and actual spirit of mutual enmity\r\nmore separative. Further, each of those main creed-divisions is\r\nsubdivided. Even Islam in this region includes a number of incompatible\r\nsects, such as the Ansariye, the Metawali, and the Druses in the Syrian\r\nmountains, Shiite Arabs on the Gulf coast and the Persian border, with\r\npagan Kurds and Yezidis in the latter region and north Mesopotamia. As\r\nfor the Christians, their divisions are notorious, most of these being\r\nsubdivided again into two or more hostile communions apiece. It is\r\nalmost impossible to imagine the inhabitants of Syria concerting a\r\ncommon plan or taking common action. The only elements among them which\r\nhave shown any political sense or capacity for political organization\r\nare Christian. The Maronites of the Lebanon are most conspicuous among\r\nthese; but neither their numbers nor their traditional relations with\r\ntheir neighbours qualify them to form the nucleus of a free united\r\nSyria. The ‘Arab Movement’ up to the present has consisted in little\r\nmore than talk and journalese. It has not developed any considerable\r\norganization to meet that stable efficient organization which the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress has directed throughout the Ottoman\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the empire, Asia Minor will stand by the Osmanli\r\ncause, even if Europe and Constantinople, and even if the Holy Places\r\nand all the Arab-speaking provinces be lost. Its allegiance does not\r\ndepend on either the tradition of Roum or the caliphate, but on\r\nessential unity with the Osmanli nation. Asia Minor is the nation.\r\nThere, prepared equally by Byzantine domination and by Seljukian\r\ninfluence, the great mass of the people long ago identified itself\r\ninsensibly and completely with the tradition and hope of the Osmanlis.\r\nThe subsequent occupation of the Byzantine capital by the heirs of the\r\nByzantine system, and their still later assumption of caliphial\r\nresponsibility, were not needed to cement the union. Even a military\r\noccupation by Russia or by another strong power would not detach\r\nAnatolia from the Osmanli unity; for a thing cannot be detached from\r\nitself. But, of course, that occupation might after long years cause\r\nthe unity itself to cease to be.\r\n\r\nSuch an occupation, however, would probably not be seriously resisted\r\nor subsequently rebelled against by the Moslem majority in Asia Minor,\r\nsupposing Osmanli armaments to have been crushed. The Anatolian\r\npopulation is a sober, labouring peasantry, essentially agricultural\r\nand wedded to the soil. The levies for Yemen and Europe, which have\r\ngone far to deplete and exhaust it of recent years, were composed of\r\nmen who fought to order and without imagination, steadily and\r\nfaithfully, as their fathers had fought. They have no lust for war, no\r\nArabian tradition of fighting for its own sake, and little, if any,\r\nfanaticism. Attempts to inspire Anatolian troops with religious rage in\r\nthe Balkan War were failures. They were asked to fight in too modern a\r\nway under too many Teutonic officers. The result illustrated a prophecy\r\nascribed to Ghasri Mukhtar Pasha. When German instructors were first\r\nintroduced into Turkey, he foretold that they would be the end of the\r\nOttoman army. No, these Anatolians desire nothing better than to follow\r\ntheir plough-oxen, and live their common village life, under any master\r\nwho will let them be.\r\n\r\nElements of the Christian minority, however, Armenian and Greek, would\r\ngive trouble with their developed ideas of nationality and\r\nirrepressible tendency to ‘Europize’. They would present, indeed,\r\nproblems of which at present one cannot foresee the solution. It seems\r\ninevitable that an autonomous Armenia, like an autonomous Poland, must\r\nbe constituted ere long; but where? There is no geographical unit of\r\nthe Ottoman area in which Armenians are the majority. If they cluster\r\nmore thickly in the vilayets of Angora, Sivas, Erzerum, Kharput, and\r\nVan, i.e. in easternmost Asia Minor, than elsewhere, and form a village\r\npeople of the soil, they are consistently a minority in any large\r\nadministrative district. Numerous, too, in the trans-Tauric vilayets of\r\nAdana and Aleppo, the seat of their most recent independence, they are\r\ntownsmen in the main, and not an essential element of the agricultural\r\npopulation. Even if a considerable proportion of the Armenians, now\r\ndispersed through towns of western Asia Minor and in Constantinople,\r\ncould be induced to concentrate in a reconstituted Armenia (which is\r\ndoubtful, seeing how addicted they are to general commerce and what may\r\nbe called parasitic life), they could not fill out both the Greater and\r\nthe Lesser Armenias of history, in sufficient strength to overbear the\r\nOsmanli and Kurdish elements. The widest area which might he\r\nconstituted an autonomous Armenia with good prospect of\r\nself-sufficiency would be the present Russian province, where the\r\nhead-quarters of the national religion lie, with the addition of the\r\nprovinces of Erzerum, Van, and Kharput.\r\n\r\nBut, if Russia had brought herself to make a self-denying ordinance,\r\nshe would have to police her new Armenia very strongly for some years;\r\nfor an acute Kurdish problem would confront it, and no concentration of\r\nnationals could be looked for from the Armenia Irredenta of Diarbekr,\r\nUrfa, Aleppo, Aintab, Marash, Adana, Kaisariyeh, Sivas, Angora, and\r\nTrebizond (not to mention farther and more foreign towns), until public\r\nsecurity was assured in what for generations has been a cockpit. The\r\nKurd is, of course, an Indo-European as much as the Armenian, and\r\nrarely a true Moslem; but it would be a very long time indeed before\r\nthese facts reconciled him to the domination of the race which he has\r\nplundered for three centuries. Most of the Osmanlis of eastern Asia\r\nMinor are descendants of converted Armenians; but their assimilation\r\nwould be slow and doubtful. Islam, more rapidly and completely than any\r\nother creed, extinguishes racial sympathies and groups its adherents\r\nanew.\r\n\r\nThe Anatolian Greeks are less numerous but not less difficult to\r\nprovide for. The scattered groups of them on the plateau—in Cappadocia,\r\nPontus, the Konia district—and on the eastward coast-lands would offer\r\nno serious difficulty to a lord of the interior. But those in the\r\nwestern river-basins from Isbarta to the Marmora, and those on the\r\nwestern and north-western littorals, are of a more advanced and\r\ncohesive political character, imbued with nationalism, intimate with\r\ntheir independent nationals, and actively interested in Hellenic\r\nnational politics. What happens at Athens has long concerned them more\r\nthan what happens at Constantinople; and with Greece occupying the\r\nislands in the daily view of many of them, they are coming to regard\r\nthemselves more and more every day as citizens of Graecia Irredenta.\r\nWhat is to be done with these? What, in particular, with Smyrna, the\r\nsecond city of the Ottoman Empire and the first of ‘Magna Graecia’? Its\r\nthree and a half hundred thousand souls include the largest Greek urban\r\npopulation resident in any one city. Shall it be united to Greece?\r\nGreece herself might well hesitate. It would prove a very irksome\r\npossession, involving her in all sorts of continental difficulties and\r\nrisks. There is no good frontier inland for such an _enclave_. It could\r\nhardly be held without the rest of westernmost Asia, from Caria to the\r\nDardanelles, and in this region the great majority of the population is\r\nMoslem of old stocks, devotedly attached both to their faith and to the\r\nOsmanli tradition.\r\n\r\nThe present writer, however, is not among the prophets. He has but\r\ntried to set forth what may delay and what may precipitate the collapse\r\nof an empire, whose doom has been long foreseen, often planned,\r\ninvariably postponed; and, further, to indicate some difficulties\r\nwhich, being bound to confront heirs of the Osmanlis, will be better\r\nmet the better they are understood before the final agony—If this is,\r\nindeed, to be!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbasid Empire,\r\nAbdul Aziz, Sultan,\r\nAbdul Hamid, Sultan,\r\nAbdul Mejid, Sultan,\r\nAchaia,\r\nAchmet III: _see_ Ahmed
