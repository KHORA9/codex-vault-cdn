Among those who have more recently devoted\r\ntheir energies to the subject may be mentioned W.J. Lawrence, T.S.\r\nGraves, G.F. Reynolds, V.E. Albright, A.H. Thorndike, and B.\r\nNeuendorff, each of whom has embodied the results of his\r\ninvestigations in one or more noteworthy volumes. But the history of\r\nthe playhouses themselves, a topic equally important, has not hitherto\r\nbeen attempted. If we omit the brief notices of the theatres in Edmond\r\nMalone's _The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare_ (1790) and John\r\nPayne Collier's _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1831), the\r\nsole book dealing even in part with the topic is T.F. Ordish's _The\r\nEarly London Theatres in the Fields_. This book, however, though good\r\nfor its time, was written a quarter of a century ago, before most of\r\nthe documents relating to early theatrical history were discovered,\r\nand it discusses only six playhouses. The present volume takes\r\nadvantage of all the materials made available by the industry of later\r\nscholars, and records the history of seventeen regular, and five\r\ntemporary or projected, theatres. The book is throughout the result of\r\na first-hand examination of original sources, and represents an\r\nindependent interpretation of the historical evidences. As a\r\nconsequence of this, as well as of a comparison (now for the first\r\ntime possible) of the detailed records of the several playhouses, many\r\nconclusions long held by scholars have been set aside. I have made no\r\nsystematic attempt to point out the cases in which I depart from\r\npreviously accepted opinions, for the scholar will discover them for\r\nhimself; but I believe I have never thus departed without being aware\r\nof it, and without having carefully weighed the entire evidence.\r\nSometimes the evidence has been too voluminous or complex for detailed\r\npresentation; in these instances I have had to content myself with\r\nreference by footnotes to the more significant documents bearing on\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nIn a task involving so many details I cannot hope to have escaped\r\nerrors--errors due not only to oversight, but also to the limitations\r\nof my knowledge or to mistaken interpretation. For such I can offer no\r\nexcuse, though I may request from my readers the same degree of\r\ntolerance which I have tried to show other laborers in the field. In\r\nreproducing old documents I have as a rule modernized the spelling and\r\nthe punctuation, for in a work of this character there seems to be no\r\nadvantage in preserving the accidents and perversities of early\r\nscribes and printers. I have also consistently altered the dates when\r\nthe Old Style conflicted with our present usage.\r\n\r\nI desire especially to record my indebtedness to the researches of\r\nProfessor C.W. Wallace, the extent of whose services to the study of\r\nthe Tudor-Stuart drama has not yet been generally realized, and has\r\nsometimes been grudgingly acknowledged; and to the labors of Mr. E.K.\r\nChambers and Mr. W.W. Greg, who, in the _Collections_ of The Malone\r\nSociety, and elsewhere, have rendered accessible a wealth of important\r\nmaterial dealing with the early history of the stage.\r\n\r\nFinally, I desire to express my gratitude to Mr. Hamilton Bell and the\r\neditor of _The Architectural Record_ for permission to reproduce the\r\nillustration and description of Inigo Jones's plan of the Cockpit; to\r\nthe Governors of Dulwich College for permission to reproduce three\r\nportraits from the Dulwich Picture Gallery, one of which, that of Joan\r\nAlleyn, has not previously been reproduced; to Mr. C.W. Redwood,\r\nformerly technical artist at Cornell University, for expert assistance\r\nin making the large map of London showing the sites of the playhouses,\r\nand for other help generously rendered; and to my colleagues,\r\nProfessor Lane Cooper and Professor Clark S. Northup, for their\r\nkindness in reading the proofs.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH QUINCY ADAMS\r\n\r\nITHACA, NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.

Many examples of such\r\ninn-yards are still to be seen in various parts of England; a picture\r\nof the famous White Hart, in Southwark, is given opposite page 4 by\r\nway of illustration. In the yard a temporary platform--a few boards,\r\nit may be, set on barrel-heads[1]--could be erected for a stage; in\r\nthe adjacent stables a dressing-room could be provided for the actors;\r\nthe rabble--always the larger and more enthusiastic part of the\r\naudience--could be accommodated with standing-room about the stage;\r\nwhile the more aristocratic members of the audience could be\r\ncomfortably seated in the galleries overhead. Thus a ready-made and\r\nvery serviceable theatre was always at the command of the players; and\r\nit seems to have been frequently made use of from the very beginning\r\nof professionalism in acting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Thou shalt not need to travel with thy pumps full of\r\ngravel any more, after a blind jade and a hamper, and stalk upon\r\nboards and barrel-heads.\" (_Poetaster_, III, i.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest extant moralities, _Mankind_, acted by strollers\r\nin the latter half of the fifteenth century, gives us an interesting\r\nglimpse of an inn-yard performance. The opening speech makes distinct\r\nreference to the two classes of the audience described above as\r\noccupying the galleries and the yard:\r\n\r\n     O ye sovereigns that sit, and ye brothers that stand right\r\n     up.\r\n\r\nThe \"brothers,\" indeed, seem to have stood up so closely about the\r\nstage that the actors had great difficulty in passing to and from\r\ntheir dressing-room. Thus, Nowadays leaves the stage with the request:\r\n\r\n     Make space, sirs, let me go out!\r\n\r\nNew Gyse enters with the threat:\r\n\r\n     Out of my way, sirs, for dread of a beating!\r\n\r\nWhile Nought, with even less respect, shouts:\r\n\r\n     Avaunt, knaves! Let me go by!\r\n\r\nLanguage such as this would hardly be appropriate if addressed to the\r\n\"sovereigns\" who sat in the galleries above; but, as addressed to the\r\n\"brothers,\" it probably served to create a general feeling of good\r\nnature. And a feeling of good nature was desirable, for the actors\r\nwere facing the difficult problem of inducing the audience to pay for\r\nits entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis problem they met by taking advantage of the most thrilling moment\r\nof the plot. The Vice and his wicked though jolly companions, having\r\nwholly failed to overcome the hero, Mankind, decide to call to their\r\nassistance no less a person than the great Devil himself; and\r\naccordingly they summon him with a \"Walsingham wystyle.\" Immediately\r\nhe roars in the dressing-room, and shouts:\r\n\r\n     I come, with my legs under me!\r\n\r\nThere is a flash of powder, and an explosion of fireworks, while the\r\neager spectators crane their necks to view the entrance of this\r\n\"abhomynabull\" personage. But nothing appears; and in the expectant\r\nsilence that follows the actors calmly announce a collection of money,\r\nfacetiously making the appearance of the Devil dependent on the\r\nliberality of the audience:\r\n\r\n     _New Gyse._ Now ghostly to our purpose, worshipful sovereigns,\r\n     We intend to gather money, if it please your negligence.\r\n     For a man with a head that of great omnipotence--\r\n\r\n     _Nowadays_ [_interrupting_]. Keep your tale, in goodness, I\r\n     pray you, good brother!\r\n\r\n     [_Addressing the audience, and pointing towards the\r\n     dressing-room, where the Devil roars again._]\r\n\r\n     He is a worshipful man, sirs, saving your reverence.\r\n     He loveth no groats, nor pence, or two-pence;\r\n     Give us red royals, if ye will see his abominable presence.\r\n\r\n     _New Gyse._ Not so! Ye that may not pay the one, pay the other.\r\n\r\nAnd with such phrases as \"God bless you, master,\" \"Ye will not say\r\nnay,\" \"Let us go by,\" \"Do them all pay,\" \"Well mote ye fare,\" they\r\npass through the audience gathering their groats, pence, and twopence;\r\nafter which they remount the stage, fetch in the Devil, and continue\r\ntheir play without further interruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INN-YARD\r\n\r\nThe famous White Hart, in Southwark. The ground-plan shows the\r\narrangement of a carriers' inn with the stabling below; the guest\r\nrooms were on the upper floors.]\r\n\r\nIn the smaller towns the itinerant players might, through a letter of\r\nrecommendation from their noble patron, or through the good-will of\r\nsome local dignitary, secure the use of the town-hall, of the\r\nschoolhouse, or even of the village church. In such buildings, of\r\ncourse, they could give their performances more advantageously, for\r\nthey could place money-takers at the doors, and exact adequate payment\r\nfrom all who entered. In the great city of London, however, the\r\nplayers were necessarily forced to make use almost entirely of public\r\ninn-yards--an arrangement which, we may well believe, they found far\r\nfrom satisfactory. Not being masters of the inns, they were merely\r\ntolerated; they had to content themselves with hastily provided and\r\ninadequate stage facilities; and, worst of all, for their recompense\r\nthey had to trust to a hat collection, at best a poor means of\r\nsecuring money. Often too, no doubt, they could not get the use of a\r\ngiven inn-yard when they most needed it, as on holidays and festive\r\noccasions; and at all times they had to leave the public in\r\nuncertainty as to where or when plays were to be seen. Their street\r\nparade, with the noise of trumpets and drums, might gather a motley\r\ncrowd for the yard, but in so large a place as London it was\r\ninadequate for advertisement among the better classes. And as the\r\ntroupes of the city increased in wealth and dignity, and as the\r\nplaygoing public grew in size and importance, the old makeshift\r\narrangement became more and more unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAt last the unsatisfactory situation was relieved by the specific\r\ndedication of certain large inns to dramatic purposes; that is, the\r\nproprietors of certain inns found it to their advantage to subordinate\r\ntheir ordinary business to the urgent demands of the actors and the\r\nplaygoing public. Accordingly they erected in their yards permanent\r\nstages adequately equipped for dramatic representations, constructed\r\nin their galleries wooden benches to accommodate as many spectators as\r\npossible, and were ready to let the use of their buildings to the\r\nactors on an agreement by which the proprietor shared with the troupe\r\nin the \"takings\" at the door. Thus there came into existence a number\r\nof inn-playhouses, where the actors, as masters of the place, could\r\nmake themselves quite at home, and where the public without special\r\nnotification could be sure of always finding dramatic entertainment.\r\n\r\nRichard Flecknoe, in his _Discourse of the English Stage_ (1664), goes\r\nso far as to dignify these reconstructed inns with the name\r\n\"theatres.\" At first, says he, the players acted \"without any certain\r\ntheatres or set companions, till about the beginning of Queen\r\nElizabeth's reign they began here to assemble into companies, and set\r\nup theatres, first in the city (as in the inn-yards of the Cross Keys\r\nand Bull in Grace and Bishop's Gate Street at this day to be seen),\r\ntill that fanatic spirit [i.e., Puritanism], which then began with the\r\nstage and after ended with the throne, banished them thence into the\r\nsuburbs\"--that is, into Shoreditch and the Bankside, where, outside\r\nthe jurisdiction of the puritanical city fathers, they erected their\r\nfirst regular playhouses.\r\n\r\nThe \"banishment\" referred to by Flecknoe was the Order of the Common\r\nCouncil issued on December 6, 1574. This famous document described\r\npublic acting as then taking place \"in great inns, having chambers and\r\nsecret places adjoining to their open stages and galleries\"; and it\r\nordered that henceforth \"no inn-keeper, tavern-keeper, nor other\r\nperson whatsoever within the liberties of this city shall openly\r\nshow, or play, nor cause or suffer to be openly showed or played\r\nwithin the house yard or any other place within the liberties of this\r\ncity, any play,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHow many inns were let on special occasions for dramatic purposes we\r\ncannot say; but there were five \"great inns,\" more famous than the\r\nrest, which were regularly used by the best London troupes. Thus\r\nHowes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (p. 1004), in attempting\r\nto give a list of the playhouses which had been erected \"within London\r\nand the suburbs,\" begins with the statement, \"Five inns, or common\r\nosteryes, turned to playhouses.\" These five were the Bell and the\r\nCross Keys, hard by each other in Gracechurch Street, the Bull, in\r\nBishopsgate Street, the Bell Savage, on Ludgate Hill, and the Boar's\r\nHead, in Whitechapel Street without Aldgate.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: All historians of the drama have confused this great\r\ncarriers' inn with the Boar's Head in Eastcheap made famous by\r\nFalstaff. The error seems to have come from the _Analytical Index of\r\nthe Remembrancia_, which (p. 355) incorrectly catalogues the letter of\r\nMarch 31, 1602, as referring to the \"Boar's Head in Eastcheap.\" The\r\nletter itself, however, when examined, gives no indication whatever of\r\nEastcheap, and other evidence shows conclusively that the inn was\r\nsituated in Whitechapel just outside of Aldgate.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Flecknoe referred to the Order of the Common Council as a\r\n\"banishment,\" it did not actually drive the players from the city.\r\nThey were able, through the intervention of the Privy Council, and on\r\nthe old excuse of rehearsing plays for the Queen's entertainment, to\r\noccupy the inns for a large part of each year.[3] John Stockwood, in a\r\nsermon preached at Paul's Cross, August 24, 1578, bitterly complains\r\nof the \"eight ordinary places\" used regularly for plays, referring, it\r\nseems, to the five inns and the three playhouses--the Theatre,\r\nCurtain, and Blackfriars--recently opened to the public.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See especially _The Acts of the Privy Council_ and _The\r\nRemembrancia_ of the City of London.]\r\n\r\nRichard Reulidge, in _A Monster Lately Found Out and Discovered_\r\n(1628), writes that \"soon after 1580\" the authorities of London\r\nreceived permission from Queen Elizabeth and her Privy Council \"to\r\nthrust the players out of the city, and to pull down all playhouses\r\nand dicing-houses within their liberties: which accordingly was\r\neffected; and the playhouses in Gracious Street [i.e., the Bell and\r\nthe Cross Keys], Bishopsgate Street [i.e., the Bull], that nigh Paul's\r\n[i.e., Paul's singing school?], that on Ludgate Hill [i.e., the Bell\r\nSavage], and the Whitefriars[4] were quite put down and suppressed by\r\nthe care of these religious senators.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: There is some error here. The city had no jurisdiction\r\nover Whitefriars, or Blackfriars either; but there was a playhouse in\r\nBlackfriars at the time, and it was suppressed in 1584, though not by\r\nthe city authorities. Possibly Reulidge should have written\r\n\"Whitechapel.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF LONDON SHOWING THE INN-PLAYHOUSES\r\n\r\n1. The Bell Savage; 2. The Cross Keys; 3. The Bell; 4. The Bull; 5.\r\nThe Boar's Head.]\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of what Reulidge says, these five inns continued to be\r\nused by the players for many years.[5] No doubt they were often used\r\nsurreptitiously. In _Martin's Month's Mind_ (1589), we read that a\r\nperson \"for a penie may have farre better [entertainment] by oddes at\r\nthe Theatre and Curtaine, and _any blind playing house_ everie\r\nday.\"[6] But the more important troupes were commonly able, through\r\nthe interference of the Privy Council, to get official permission to\r\nuse the inns during a large part of each year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _The Remembrancia_ shows that the inn-playhouses remained\r\nfor many years as sharp thorns in the side of the puritanical city\r\nfathers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Grosart, _Nash_, I, 179.]\r\n\r\nThere is not enough material about these early inn-playhouses to\r\nenable one to write their separate histories. Below, however, I have\r\nrecorded in chronological order the more important references to them\r\nwhich have come under my observation.\r\n\r\n1557. On September 5 the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon \"that some of his officers do forthwith repair to the Boar's\r\nHead without Aldgate, where, the Lords are informed, a lewd play\r\ncalled _A Sackful of News_ shall be played this day,\" to arrest the\r\nplayers, and send their playbook to the Council.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VI, 168.]\r\n\r\n1573. During this year there were various fencing contests held at the\r\nBull in Bishopsgate.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235.]\r\n\r\n1577. In February the Office of the Revels made a payment of 10_d._\r\n\"ffor the cariadge of the parts of ye well counterfeit from the Bell\r\nin gracious strete to St. Johns, to be performed for the play of\r\n_Cutwell_.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A. Feuillerat, _Documents Relating to the Office of the\r\nRevels in the Time of Queen Elizabeth_, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n1579. On June 23 James Burbage was arrested for the sum of £5 13_d._\r\n\"as he came down Gracious Street towards the Cross Keys there to a\r\nplay.\" The name of the proprietor of this inn-playhouse is preserved\r\nin one of the interrogatories connected with the case: \"Item. Whether\r\ndid you, John Hynde, about xiii years past, in _anno_ 1579, the xxiii\r\nof June, about two of the clock in the afternoon, send the sheriff's\r\nofficer unto the Cross Keys in Gratious Street, being then the\r\ndwelling house of Richard Ibotson, citizen and brewer of London,\"\r\netc.[10] Nothing more, I believe, is known of this person.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Burbage _v._ Brayne, printed in C.W. Wallace, _The First\r\nLondon Theatre_, pp. 82, 90. Whether Burbage was going to the Cross\r\nKeys as a spectator or as an actor is not indicated; but the\r\npresumption is that he was then playing at the inn, although he was\r\nproprietor of the Theatre.]\r\n\r\n1579. Stephen Gosson, in _The Schoole of Abuse_, writes favorably of\r\n\"the two prose books played at the Bell Savage, where you shall find\r\nnever a word without wit, never a line without pith, never a letter\r\nplaced in vain; the _Jew_ and _Ptolome_, shown at the Bull ... neither\r\nwith amorous gesture wounding the eye, nor with slovenly talk hurting\r\nthe ears of the chast hearers.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Arber's _English Reprints_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n1582. On July 1 the Earl of Warwick wrote to the Lord Mayor requesting\r\nthe city authorities to \"give license to my servant, John David, this\r\nbearer, to play his profest prizes in his science and profession of\r\ndefence at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or some other convenient place to\r\nbe assigned within the liberties of London.\" The Lord Mayor refused to\r\nallow David to give his fencing contest \"in an inn, which was somewhat\r\ntoo close for infection, and appointed him to play in an open place of\r\nthe Leaden Hall,\" which, it may be added, was near the Bull.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 55-57.]\r\n\r\n1583. William Rendle, in _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 235, states\r\nthat in this year \"Tarleton, Wilson, and others note the stay of the\r\nplague, and ask leave to play at the Bull in Bishopsgate, or the Bell\r\nin Gracechurch Street,\" citing as his authority merely \"City MS.\" The\r\nPrivy Council on November 26, 1583, addressed to the Lord Mayor a\r\nletter requesting \"that Her Majesty's Players [i.e., Tarleton, Wilson,\r\netc.] may be suffered to play within the liberties as heretofore they\r\nhave done.\"[13] And on November 28 the Lord Mayor issued to them a\r\nlicense to play \"at the sign of the Bull in Bishopsgate Street, and\r\nthe sign of the Bell in Gracious Street, and nowhere else within this\r\nCity.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: C.W. Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, p. 11.]\r\n\r\n1587. \"James Cranydge played his master's prize the 21 of November,\r\n1587, at the Bellsavage without Ludgate, at iiij sundry kinds of\r\nweapons.... There played with him nine masters.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by J.O. Halliwell in\r\nhis edition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. The Bell Savage seems to have\r\nbeen especially patronized by fencers. George Silver, in his _Paradoxe\r\nof Defence_ (1599), tells how he and his brother once challenged two\r\nItalian fencers to a contest \"to be played at the Bell Savage upon the\r\nscaffold, when he that went in his fight faster back than he ought,\r\nshould be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold.\"]\r\n\r\nBefore 1588. In _Tarlton's Jests_[16] we find a number of references\r\nto that famous actor's pleasantries in the London inns used by the\r\nQueen's Players. It is impossible to date these exactly, but Tarleton\r\nbecame a member of the Queen's Players in 1583, and he died in 1588.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: First printed in 1611; reprinted by J.O. Halliwell for\r\nThe Shakespeare Society in 1844.]\r\n\r\n     At the Bull in Bishops-gate-street, where the Queen's\r\n     Players oftentimes played, Tarleton coming on the stage, one\r\n     from the gallery threw a pippin at him.\r\n\r\n     There was one Banks, in the time of Tarleton, who served the\r\n     Earl of Essex, and had a horse of strange qualities; and\r\n     being at the Cross Keys in Gracious Street getting money\r\n     with him, as he was mightily resorted to. Tarleton then,\r\n     with his fellows playing at the Bell by, came into the Cross\r\n     Keys, amongst many people, to see fashions.\r\n\r\n     At the Bull at Bishops-gate was a play of Henry the Fifth.\r\n\r\nThe several \"jests\" which follow these introductory sentences indicate\r\nthat the inn-yards differed in no essential way from the early public\r\nplayhouses.\r\n\r\n1588. \"John Mathews played his master's prize the 31 day of January,\r\n1588, at the Bell Savage without Ludgate.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _MS. Sloane_, 2530, f. 6-7, quoted by Halliwell in his\r\nedition of _Tarlton's Jests_, p. xi. There is some difficulty with the\r\ndate. One of the \"masters\" before whom the prize was played was\r\n\"Rycharde Tarlton,\" whom Halliwell takes to be the famous actor of\r\nthat name; but Tarleton the actor died on September 3, 1588. Probably\r\nHalliwell in transcribing the manuscript silently modernized the date\r\nfrom the Old Style.]\r\n\r\n1589. In November Lord Burghley directed the Lord Mayor to \"give order\r\nfor the stay of all plays within the city.\" In reply the Lord Mayor\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     According to which your Lordship's good pleasure, I\r\n     presently sent for such players as I could hear of; so as\r\n     there appeared yesterday before me the Lord Strange's\r\n     Players, to whom I specially gave in charge and required\r\n     them in Her Majesty's name to forbear playing until further\r\n     order might be given for their allowance in that respect.\r\n     Whereupon the Lord Admiral's Players very dutifully obeyed;\r\n     but the others, in very contemptuous manner departing from\r\n     me, went to the Cross Keys and played that afternoon.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Lansdowne MSS._ 60, quoted by Collier, _History of\r\nEnglish Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 265.]\r\n\r\n1594. On October 8, Henry, Lord Hunsdon, the Lord Chamberlain and the\r\npatron of Shakespeare's company, wrote to the Lord Mayor:\r\n\r\n     After my hearty commendations. Where my now company of\r\n     players have been accustomed for the better exercise of\r\n     their quality, and for the service of Her Majesty if need so\r\n     require, to play this winter time within the city at the\r\n     Cross Keys in Gracious Street, these are to require and pray\r\n     your Lordship (the time being such as, thanks to God, there\r\n     is now no danger of the sickness) to permit and suffer them\r\n     so to do.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _The Remembrancia_, The Malone Society's _Collections_,\r\nI, 73.]\r\n\r\nBy such devices as this the players were usually able to secure\r\npermission to act \"within the city\" during the disagreeable months of\r\nthe winter when the large playhouses in the suburbs were difficult of\r\naccess.\r\n\r\n1594. Anthony Bacon, the elder brother of Francis, came to lodge in\r\nBishopsgate Street. This fact very much disturbed his good mother, who\r\nfeared lest his servants might be corrupted by the plays to be seen at\r\nthe Bull near by.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: See W. Rendle, _The Inns of Old Southwark_, p. 236.]\r\n\r\n1596. William Lambarde, in his _Perambulation of Kent_,[21] observes\r\nthat none of those who go \"to Paris Garden, the Bell Savage, or\r\nTheatre, to behold bear-baiting, interludes, or fence play, can\r\naccount of any pleasant spectacle unless they first pay one penny at\r\nthe gate, another at the entry of the scaffold, and the third for a\r\nquiet standing.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The passage does not appear in the earlier edition of\r\n1576, though it was probably written shortly after the erection of the\r\nTheatre in the autumn of 1576.]\r\n\r\n1602. On March 31 the Privy Council wrote to the Lord Mayor that the\r\nplayers of the Earl of Oxford and of the Earl of Worcester had been\r\n\"joined by agreement together in one company, to whom, upon notice of\r\nHer Majesty's pleasure, at the suit of the Earl of Oxford, toleration\r\nhath been thought meet to be granted.\" The letter concludes:\r\n\r\n     And as the other companies that are allowed, namely of me\r\n     the Lord Admiral, and the Lord Chamberlain, be appointed\r\n     their certain houses, and one and no more to each company,\r\n     so we do straightly require that this third company be\r\n     likewise [appointed] to one place. And because we are\r\n     informed the house called the Boar's Head is the place they\r\n     have especially used and do best like of, we do pray and\r\n     require you that the said house, namely the Boar's Head, may\r\n     be assigned unto them.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _The Remembrancia_, The Malone Society's _Collections_,\r\nI, 85.]\r\n\r\nThat the strong Oxford-Worcester combination should prefer the Boar's\r\nHead to the Curtain or the Rose Playhouse,[23] indicates that the\r\ninn-yard was not only large, but also well-equipped for acting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: They had to use the Rose nevertheless; see page 158.]\r\n\r\n1604. In a draft of a license to be issued to Queen Anne's Company,\r\nthose players are allowed to act \"as well within their now usual\r\nhouses, called the Curtain and the Boar's Head, within our County of\r\nMiddlesex, as in any other playhouse not used by others.\"[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 265.]\r\n\r\nIn 1608 the Boar's Head seems to have been occupied by the newly\r\norganized Prince Charles's Company. In William Kelly's extracts from\r\nthe payments of the city of Leicester we find the entry: \"Itm. Given\r\nto the Prince's Players, of Whitechapel, London, xx _s._\"\r\n\r\nIn 1664, as Flecknoe tells us, the Cross Keys and the Bull still gave\r\nevidence of their former use as playhouses; perhaps even then they\r\nwere occasionally let for fencing and other contests. In 1666 the\r\ngreat fire completely destroyed the Bell, the Cross Keys, and the Bell\r\nSavage; the Bull, however, escaped, and enjoyed a prosperous career\r\nfor many years after. Samuel Pepys was numbered among its patrons, and\r\nwriters of the Restoration make frequent reference to it. What became\r\nof the Boar's Head without Aldgate I am unable to learn; its memory,\r\nhowever, is perpetuated to-day in Boar's Head Yard, between Middlesex\r\nStreet and Goulston Street, Whitechapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HOSTILITY OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the actors rapidly increased in number and importance, and as\r\nLondoners flocked in ever larger crowds to witness plays, the\r\nanimosity of two forces was aroused, Puritanism and Civic\r\nGovernment,--forces which opposed the drama for different reasons, but\r\nwith almost equal fervor. And when in the course of time the Governors\r\nof the city themselves became Puritans, the combined animosity thus\r\nproduced was sufficient to drive the players out of London into the\r\nsuburbs.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans attacked the drama as contrary to Holy Writ, as\r\ndestructive of religion, and as a menace to public morality. Against\r\nplays, players, and playgoers they waged in pulpit and pamphlet a\r\nwarfare characterized by the most intense fanaticism. The charges they\r\nmade--of ungodliness, idolatrousness, lewdness, profanity, evil\r\npractices, enormities, and \"abuses\" of all kinds--are far too numerous\r\nto be noted here; they are interesting chiefly for their\r\nunreasonableness and for the violence with which they were urged.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, however much the Puritans might rage, they were\r\nhelpless; authority to restrain acting was vested in the Lord Mayor,\r\nhis brethren the Aldermen, and the Common Council. The attitude of\r\nthese city officials towards the drama was unmistakable: they had no\r\nmore love for the actors than had the Puritans. They found that \"plays\r\nand players\" gave them more trouble than anything else in the entire\r\nadministration of municipal affairs. The dedication of certain \"great\r\ninns\" to the use of actors and to the entertainment of the\r\npleasure-loving element of the city created new and serious problems\r\nfor those charged with the preservation of civic law and order. The\r\npresence in these inns of private rooms adjoining the yard and\r\nbalconies gave opportunity for immorality, gambling, fleecing, and\r\nvarious other \"evil practices\"--an opportunity which, if we may\r\nbelieve the Common Council, was not wasted. Moreover, the proprietors\r\nof these inns made a large share of their profits from the beer, ale,\r\nand other drinks dispensed to the crowds before, during, and after\r\nperformances (the proprietor of the Cross Keys, it will be recalled,\r\nwas described as \"citizen and brewer of London\"); and the resultant\r\nintemperance among \"such as frequented the said plays, being the\r\nordinary place of meeting for all vagrant persons, and masterless men\r\nthat hang about the city, theeves, horse-stealers, whoremongers,\r\ncozeners, cony-catching persons, practicers of treason, and such other\r\nlike,\"[25] led to drunkenness, frays, bloodshed, and often to general\r\ndisorder. Sometimes, as we know, turbulent apprentices and other\r\nfactions met by appointment at plays for the sole purpose of starting\r\nriots or breaking open jails. \"Upon Whitsunday,\" writes the Recorder\r\nto Lord Burghley, \"by reason no plays were the same day, all the city\r\nwas quiet.\"[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: So the Lord Mayor characterized playgoers; see _The\r\nRemembrancia_, in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 164.]\r\n\r\nTrouble of an entirely different kind arose when in the hot months of\r\nthe summer the plague was threatening. The meeting together at plays\r\nof \"great multitudes of the basest sort of people\" served to spread\r\nthe infection throughout the city more quickly and effectively than\r\ncould anything else. On such occasions it was exceedingly difficult\r\nfor the municipal authorities to control the actors, who were at best\r\na stubborn and unruly lot; and often the pestilence had secured a full\r\nstart before acting could be suppressed.\r\n\r\nThese troubles, and others which cannot here be mentioned, made one of\r\nthe Lord Mayors exclaim in despair: \"The Politique State and\r\nGovernment of this City by no one thing is so greatly annoyed and\r\ndisquieted as by players and plays, and the disorders which follow\r\nthereupon.\"[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _The Remembrancia_, in The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 69.]\r\n\r\nThis annoyance, serious enough in itself, was aggravated by the fact\r\nthat most of the troupes were under the patronage of great noblemen,\r\nand some were even high in favor with the Queen. As a result, the\r\nattempts on the part of the Lord Mayor and his Aldermen to regulate\r\nthe players were often interfered with by other or higher authority.\r\nSometimes it was a particular nobleman, whose request was not to be\r\nignored, who intervened in behalf of his troupe; most often, however,\r\nit was the Privy Council, representing the Queen and the nobility in\r\ngeneral, which championed the cause of the actors and countermanded\r\nthe decrees of the Lord Mayor and his brethren. One of the most\r\nnotable things in the City's _Remembrancia_ is this long conflict of\r\nauthority between the Common Council and the Privy Council over actors\r\nand acting.\r\n\r\nIn 1573 the situation seems to have approached a crisis. The Lord\r\nMayor had become strongly puritanical, and in his efforts to suppress\r\n\"stage-plays\" was placing more and more obstacles in the way of the\r\nactors. The temper of the Mayor is revealed in two entries in the\r\nrecords of the Privy Council. On July 13, 1573, the Lords of the\r\nCouncil sent a letter to him requesting him \"to permit liberty to\r\ncertain Italian players\"; six days later they sent a second letter,\r\nrepeating the request, and \"marveling that he did it not at their\r\nfirst request.\"[28] His continued efforts to suppress the drama\r\nfinally led the troupes to appeal for relief to the Privy Council. On\r\nMarch 22, 1574, the Lords of the Council dispatched \"a letter to the\r\nLord Mayor to advertise their Lordships what causes he hath to\r\nrestrain plays.\" His answer has not been preserved, but that he\r\npersisted in his hostility to the drama is indicated by the fact that\r\nin May the Queen openly took sides with the players. To the Earl of\r\nLeicester's troupe she issued a special royal license, authorizing\r\nthem to act \"as well within our city of London and liberties of the\r\nsame, as also within the liberties and freedoms of any our cities,\r\ntowns, boroughs, etc., whatsoever\"; and to the mayors and other\r\nofficers she gave strict orders not to interfere with such\r\nperformances: \"Willing and commanding you, and every of you, as ye\r\ntender our pleasure, to permit and suffer them herein without any your\r\nlets, hindrances, or molestation during the term aforesaid, any act,\r\nstatute, proclamation, or commandment heretofore made, or hereafter to\r\nbe made, to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VIII, 131, 132.]\r\n\r\nThis license was a direct challenge to the authority of the Lord\r\nMayor. He dared not answer it as directly; but on December 6, 1574, he\r\nsecured from the Common Council the passage of an ordinance which\r\nplaced such heavy restrictions upon acting as virtually to nullify the\r\nlicense issued by the Queen, and to regain for the Mayor complete\r\ncontrol of the drama within the city. The Preamble of this remarkable\r\nordinance clearly reveals the puritanical character of the City\r\nGovernment:\r\n\r\n     Whereas heretofore sundry great disorders and inconveniences\r\n     have been found to ensue to this city by the inordinate\r\n     haunting of great multitudes of people, specially youths, to\r\n     plays, interludes, and shews: namely, occasion of frays and\r\n     quarrels; evil practises of incontinency in great inns\r\n     having chambers and secret places adjoining to their open\r\n     stages and galleries; inveigling and alluring of maids,\r\n     specially orphans and good citizens' children under age, to\r\n     privy and unmeet contracts; the publishing of unchaste,\r\n     uncomly, and unshamefaced speeches and doings; withdrawing\r\n     of the Queen's Majesty's subjects from divine service on\r\n     Sundays and holy days, at which times such plays were\r\n     chiefly used; unthrifty waste of the money of the poor and\r\n     fond persons; sundry robberies by picking and cutting of\r\n     purses; uttering of popular, busy, and seditious matters;\r\n     and many other corruptions of youth, and other enormities;\r\n     besides that also sundry slaughters and maimings of the\r\n     Queen's subjects have happened by ruins of scaffolds,\r\n     frames, and stages, and by engines, weapons, and powder used\r\n     in plays. And whereas in time of God's visitation by the\r\n     plague such assemblies of the people in throng and press\r\n     have been very dangerous for spreading of infection.... And\r\n     for that the Lord Mayor and his brethren the Aldermen,\r\n     together with the grave and discreet citizens in the Common\r\n     Council assembled, do doubt and fear lest upon God's\r\n     merciful withdrawing his hand of sickness from us (which God\r\n     grant), the people, specially the meaner and most unruly\r\n     sort, should with sudden forgetting of His visitation,\r\n     without fear of God's wrath, and without due respect of the\r\n     good and politique means that He hath ordained for the\r\n     preservation of common weals and peoples in health and good\r\n     order, return to the undue use of such enormities, to the\r\n     great offense of God....[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: For the complete document see W.C. Hazlitt, _The English\r\nDrama and Stage_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe restrictions on playing imposed by the ordinance may be briefly\r\nsummarized:\r\n\r\n1. Only such plays should be acted as were free from all unchastity,\r\nseditiousness, and \"uncomely matter.\"\r\n\r\n2. Before being acted all plays should be \"first perused and allowed\r\nin such order and form, and by such persons as by the Lord Mayor and\r\nCourt of Aldermen for the time being shall be appointed.\"\r\n\r\n3. Inns or other buildings used for acting, and their proprietors,\r\nshould both be licensed by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen.\r\n\r\n4. The proprietors of such buildings should be \"bound to the\r\nChamberlain of London\" by a sufficient bond to guarantee \"the keeping\r\nof good order, and avoiding of\" the inconveniences noted in the\r\nPreamble.\r\n\r\n5. No plays should be given during the time of sickness, or during any\r\ninhibition ordered at any time by the city authorities.\r\n\r\n6. No plays should be given during \"any usual time of divine service,\"\r\nand no persons should be admitted into playing places until after\r\ndivine services were over.\r\n\r\n7. The proprietors of such places should pay towards the support of\r\nthe poor a sum to be agreed upon by the city authorities.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, to avoid trouble with the Queen, or those noblemen\r\nwho were accustomed to have plays given in their homes for the private\r\nentertainment of themselves and their guests, the Common Council\r\nadded, rather grudgingly, the following proviso:\r\n\r\n     Provided alway that this act (otherwise than touching the\r\n     publishing of unchaste, seditious, and unmeet matters) shall\r\n     not extend to any plays, interludes, comedies, tragedies, or\r\n     shews to be played or shewed in the private house, dwelling,\r\n     or lodging of any nobleman, citizen, or gentleman, which\r\n     shall or will then have the same there so played or shewed\r\n     in his presence for the festivity of any marriage, assembly\r\n     of friends, or other like cause, without public or common\r\n     collections of money of the auditory or beholders thereof.\r\n\r\nSuch regulations if strictly enforced would prove very annoying to the\r\nplayers. But, as the Common Council itself informs us, \"these orders\r\nwere not then observed.\" The troupes continued to play in the city,\r\nprotected against any violent action on the part of the municipal\r\nauthorities by the known favor of the Queen and the frequent\r\ninterference of the Privy Council. This state of affairs was not, of\r\ncourse, comfortable for the actors; but it was by no means desperate,\r\nand for several years after the passage of the ordinance of 1574 they\r\ncontinued without serious interruption to occupy their inn-playhouses.\r\n\r\nThe long-continued hostility of the city authorities, however, of\r\nwhich the ordinance of 1574 was an ominous expression, led more or\r\nless directly to the construction of special buildings devoted to\r\nplays and situated beyond the jurisdiction of the Common Council. As\r\nthe Reverend John Stockwood, in _A Sermon Preached at Paules Crosse,\r\n1578_, indignantly puts it:\r\n\r\n     Have we not _houses of purpose_, built with great charges\r\n     for the maintenance of plays, and that _without the\r\n     liberties_, as who would say \"_There, let them say what they\r\n     will say, we will play!_\"\r\n\r\nThus came into existence playhouses; and with them dawned a new era in\r\nthe history of the English drama.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FIRST PLAYHOUSES\r\n\r\nFinsbury Field and Holywell. The man walking from the Field towards\r\nShoreditch is just entering Holywell Lane.\r\n\r\n(From Agas's _Map of London_, representing the city as it was about\r\n1560.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE THEATRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the city to the drama was unquestionably the main\r\ncause of the erection of the first playhouse; yet combined with this\r\nwere two other important causes, usually overlooked. The first was the\r\nneed of a building specially designed to meet the requirements of the\r\nplayers and of the public, a need yearly growing more urgent as plays\r\nbecame more complex, acting developed into a finer art, and audiences\r\nincreased in dignity as well as in size. The second and the more\r\nimmediate cause was the appearance of a man with business insight\r\nenough to see that such a building would pay. The first playhouse, we\r\nshould remember, was not erected by a troupe of actors, but by a\r\nmoney-seeking individual.[30] Although he was himself an actor, and\r\nthe manager of a troupe, he did not, it seems, take the troupe into\r\nhis confidence. In complete independence of any theatrical\r\norganization he proceeded with the erection of his building as a\r\nprivate speculation; and, we are told, he dreamed of the \"continual\r\ngreat profit and commodity through plays that should be used there\r\nevery week.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: I emphasize this point because the opposite is the\r\naccepted opinion. We find it expressed in _The Cambridge History of\r\nEnglish Literature_, VI, 431, as follows: \"Certain players, finding\r\nthe city obdurate, and unwilling to submit to its severe regulations,\r\nbegan to look about them for some means of carrying on their business\r\nout of reach of the mayor's authority,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nThis man, \"the first builder of playhouses,\"--and, it might have been\r\nadded, the pioneer in a new field of business,--was James Burbage,\r\noriginally, as we are told by one who knew him well, \"by occupation a\r\njoiner; and reaping but a small living by the same, gave it over and\r\nbecame a common player in plays.\"[31] As an actor he was more\r\nsuccessful, for as early as 1572 we find him at the head of\r\nLeicester's excellent troupe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Deposition by Robert Myles, 1592, printed in Wallace's\r\n_The First London Theatre_, p. 141.]\r\n\r\nHaving in 1575 conceived the notion of erecting a building specially\r\ndesigned for dramatic entertainments, he was at once confronted with\r\nthe problem of a suitable location. Two conditions narrowed his\r\nchoice: first, the site had to be outside the jurisdiction of the\r\nCommon Council; secondly, it had to be as near as possible to the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he at once thought of the two suburbs that were specially\r\ndevoted to recreation, the Bankside to the south, and Finsbury Field\r\nto the north of the city. The Bankside had for many years been\r\nassociated in the minds of Londoners with \"sports and pastimes.\"\r\nThither the citizens were accustomed to go to witness bear-baiting\r\nand bull-baiting, to practice archery, and to engage in various\r\nathletic sports. Thither, too, for many years the actors had gone to\r\npresent their plays. In 1545 King Henry VIII had issued a proclamation\r\nagainst vagabonds, ruffians, idle persons, and common players,[32] in\r\nwhich he referred to their \"fashions commonly used at the Bank.\" The\r\nBankside, however, was associated with the lowest and most vicious\r\npleasures of London, for here were situated the stews, bordering the\r\nriver's edge. Since the players were at this time subject to the\r\nbitterest attacks from the London preachers, Burbage wisely decided\r\nnot to erect the first permanent home of the drama in a locality\r\nalready a common target for puritan invective.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See page 134.]\r\n\r\nThe second locality, Finsbury Field, had nearly all the advantages,\r\nand none of the disadvantages, of the Bankside. Since 1315 the Field\r\nhad been in the possession of the city,[33] and had been used as a\r\npublic playground, where families could hold picnics, falconers could\r\nfly their hawks, archers could exercise their sport, and the militia\r\non holidays could drill with all \"the pomp and circumstance of\r\nglorious war.\" In short, the Field was eminently respectable, was\r\naccessible to the city, and was definitely associated with the idea of\r\nentertainment. The locality, therefore, was almost ideal for the\r\npurpose Burbage had in mind.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See _The Remembrancia_, p. 274; Stow, _Survey_. The\r\nCorporation of London held the manor on lease from St. Paul's\r\nCathedral until 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Doubtless, too, Burbage was influenced in his choice by\r\nthe fact that he had already made his home in the Liberty of\r\nShoreditch, near Finsbury Field.]\r\n\r\nThe new playhouse, of course, could not be erected in the Field\r\nitself, which was under the control of the city; but just to the east\r\nof the Field certain vacant land, part of the dissolved Priory of\r\nHolywell, offered a site in every way suitable to the purpose. The\r\nHolywell property, at the dissolution of the Priory, had passed under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Crown, and hence the Lord Mayor and the\r\nAldermen could not enforce municipal ordinances there. Moreover, it\r\nwas distant from the city wall not much more than half a mile. The old\r\nconventual church had been demolished, the Priory buildings had been\r\nconverted into residences, and the land near the Shoreditch highway\r\nhad been built up with numerous houses. The land next to the Field,\r\nhowever, was for the most part undeveloped. It contained some\r\ndilapidated tenements, a few old barns formerly belonging to the\r\nPriory, and small garden plots, conspicuous objects in the early maps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FIRST PLAYHOUSES\r\n\r\nFinsbury Field lies to the north (beyond Moor Field, the small\r\nrectangular space next to the city wall), and the Holywell Property\r\nlies to the right of Finsbury Field, between the Field and the\r\nhighway. Holywell Lane divides the garden plots; the Theatre was\r\nerected just to the north, and the Curtain just to the south of this\r\nlane, facing the Field. (From the _Map of London_ by Braun and\r\nHogenbergius representing the city as it was in 1554-1558.)]\r\n\r\nBurbage learned that a large portion of this land lying next to the\r\nField was in the possession of a well-to-do gentleman named Gyles\r\nAlleyn,[35] and that Alleyn was willing to lease a part of his\r\nholding on the conditions of development customary in this section of\r\nLondon. These conditions are clearly revealed in a chancery suit of\r\n1591:\r\n\r\n     The ground there was for the most part converted first into\r\n     garden plots, and then leasing the same to diverse tenants\r\n     caused them to covenant or promise to build upon the same,\r\n     by occasion whereof the buildings which are there were for\r\n     the most part erected and the rents increased.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: For a detailed history of the property from the year\r\n1128, and for the changes in the ownership of Alleyn's portion after\r\nthe dissolution, see Braines, _Holywell Priory_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 365. The suit\r\nconcerns the Curtain property, somewhat south of the Alleyn property,\r\nbut a part of the Priory.]\r\n\r\nThe part of Alleyn's property on which Burbage had his eye was in sore\r\nneed of improvement. It consisted of five \"paltry tenements,\"\r\ndescribed as \"old, decayed, and ruinated for want of reparation, and\r\nthe best of them was but of two stories high,\" and a long barn \"very\r\nruinous and decayed and ready to have fallen down,\" one half of which\r\nwas used as a storage-room, the other half as a slaughter-house. Three\r\nof the tenements had small gardens extending back to the Field, and\r\njust north of the barn was a bit of \"void ground,\" also adjoining the\r\nField. It was this bit of \"void ground\" that Burbage had selected as a\r\nsuitable location for his proposed playhouse. The accompanying map of\r\nthe property[37] will make clear the position of this \"void ground\"\r\nand of the barns and tenements about it. Moreover, it will serve to\r\nindicate the exact site of the Theatre. If one will bear in mind the\r\nfact that in the London of to-day Curtain Road marks the eastern\r\nboundary of Finsbury Field, and New Inn Yard cuts off the lower half\r\nof the Great Barn, he will be able to place Burbage's structure within\r\na few yards.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: I have based this map in large measure on the documents\r\npresented by Braines in his excellent pamphlet, _Holywell Priory_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: For proof see Braines, _op. cit._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF BURBAGE'S HOLYWELL PROPERTY\r\n\r\nBased on the lease, and on the miscellaneous documents printed by\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps and by Braines. The \"common sewer\" is now marked\r\nby Curtain Road, and the \"ditch from the horse-pond\" by New Inn Yard.]\r\n\r\nThe property is carefully described in the lease--quoted below--which\r\nBurbage secured from Alleyn, but the reader will need to refer to the\r\nmap in order to follow with ease the several paragraphs of\r\ndescription:[39]\r\n\r\n     All those two houses or tenements, with appurtenances, which\r\n     at the time of the said former demise made were in the\r\n     several tenures or occupations of Joan Harrison, widow, and\r\n     John Dragon.\r\n\r\n     And also all that house or tenement with the appurtenances,\r\n     together with the garden ground lying behind part of the\r\n     same, being then likewise in the occupation of William\r\n     Gardiner; which said garden plot doth extend in breadth from\r\n     a great stone wall there which doth enclose part of the\r\n     garden then or lately being in the occupation of the said\r\n     Gyles, unto the garden there then in the occupation of Edwin\r\n     Colefox, weaver, and in length from the same house or\r\n     tenement unto a brick wall there next unto the fields\r\n     commonly called Finsbury Fields.\r\n\r\n     And also all that house or tenement, with the appurtenances,\r\n     at the time of the said former demise made called or known\r\n     by the name of the Mill-house; together with the garden\r\n     ground lying behind part of the same, also at the time of\r\n     the said former demise made being in the tenure or\r\n     occupation of the aforesaid Edwin Colefox, or of his\r\n     assigns; which said garden ground doth extend in length from\r\n     the same house or tenement unto the aforesaid brick wall\r\n     next unto the aforesaid Fields.\r\n\r\n     And also all those three upper rooms, with the\r\n     appurtenances, next adjoining to the aforesaid Mill-house,\r\n     also being at the time of the said former demise made in the\r\n     occupation of Thomas Dancaster, shoemaker, or of his\r\n     assigns; and also all the nether rooms, with the\r\n     appurtenances, lying under the same three upper rooms, and\r\n     next adjoining also to the aforesaid house or tenement\r\n     called the Mill-house, then also being in the several\r\n     tenures or occupations of Alice Dotridge, widow, and Richard\r\n     Brockenbury, or of their assigns; together with the garden\r\n     ground lying behind the same, extending in length from the\r\n     same nether rooms down unto the aforesaid brick wall next\r\n     unto the aforesaid Fields, and then or late being also in\r\n     the tenure or occupation of the aforesaid Alice Dotridge.\r\n\r\n     And also so much of the ground and soil lying and being\r\n     afore all the tenements or houses before granted, as\r\n     extendeth in length from the outward part of the aforesaid\r\n     tenements being at the time of the making of the said former\r\n     demise in the occupation of the aforesaid Joan Harrison and\r\n     John Dragon, unto a pond there being next unto the barn or\r\n     stable then in the occupation of the right honorable the\r\n     Earl of Rutland or of his assigns, and in breadth from the\r\n     aforesaid tenement or Mill-house to the midst of the well\r\n     being afore the same tenements.\r\n\r\n     And also all that Great Barn, with the appurtenances, at the\r\n     time of the making of the said former demise made being in\r\n     the several occupations of Hugh Richards, innholder, and\r\n     Robert Stoughton, butcher; and also a little piece of ground\r\n     then inclosed with a pale and next adjoining to the\r\n     aforesaid barn, and then or late before that in the\r\n     occupation of the said Robert Stoughton; together also with\r\n     all the ground and soil lying and being between the said\r\n     nether rooms last before expressed, and the aforesaid Great\r\n     Barn, and the aforesaid pond; that is to say, extending in\r\n     length from the aforesaid pond unto a ditch beyond the brick\r\n     wall next the aforesaid Fields.\r\n\r\n     And also the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife do by these\r\n     presents demise, grant, and to farm lett unto the said James\r\n     Burbage all the right, title, and interest which the said\r\n     Gyles and Sara have or ought to have in or to all the\r\n     grounds and soil lying between the aforesaid Great Barn and\r\n     the barn being at the time of the said former demise in the\r\n     occupation of the Earl of Rutland or of his assigns,\r\n     extending in length from the aforesaid pond and from the\r\n     aforesaid stable or barn then in the occupation of the\r\n     aforesaid Earl of Rutland or of his assigns, down to the\r\n     aforesaid brick wall next the aforesaid Fields.[40]\r\n\r\n     And also the said Gyles and Sara do by these presents\r\n     demise, grant, and to farm lett to the said James all the\r\n     said void ground lying and being betwixt the aforesaid ditch\r\n     and the aforesaid brick wall, extending in length from the\r\n     aforesaid [great stone] wall[41] which encloseth part of the\r\n     aforesaid garden being at the time of the making of the said\r\n     former demise or late before that in the occupation of the\r\n     said Gyles Allen, unto the aforesaid barn then in the\r\n     occupation of the aforesaid Earl or of his assigns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: The original lease may be found incorporated in Alleyn\r\n_v._ Street, Coram Rege, 1599-1600, printed in full by Wallace, _The\r\nFirst London Theatre_, pp. 163-80, and again in Alleyn _v._ Burbage,\r\nQueen's Bench, 1602, Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 267-75. The lease, I\r\nthink, was in English not Latin, and hence is more correctly given in\r\nthe first document; in the second document the scrivener has\r\ntranslated it into Latin. The lease is also given in part on page\r\n187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: This part of the property was claimed by the Earl of\r\nRutland, and was being used by him. For a long time it was the subject\r\nof dispute. Ultimately, it seems, the Earl secured the title, as he\r\nhad always had the use of the property. This probably explains why\r\nBurbage did not attempt to erect his playhouse there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The document by error reads \"brick wall\" but the mistake\r\nis obvious, and the second version of the lease does not repeat the\r\nerror. This clause merely means that the ditch, not the brick wall,\r\nconstituted the western boundary of the property.]\r\n\r\nThe lease was formally signed on April 13, 1576, and Burbage entered\r\ninto the possession of his property. Since the terms of the lease are\r\nimportant for an understanding of the subsequent history of the\r\nplayhouse, I shall set these forth briefly:\r\n\r\nFirst, the lease was to run for twenty-one years from April 13, 1576,\r\nat an annual rental of £14.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Burbage was to spend before the expiration of ten years the\r\nsum of £200 in rebuilding and improving the decayed tenements.\r\n\r\nThirdly, in view of this expenditure of £200, Burbage was to have at\r\nthe end of the ten years the right to renew the lease at the same\r\nrental of £14 a year for twenty-one years, thus making the lease good\r\nin all for thirty-one years:\r\n\r\n     And the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife did thereby\r\n     covenant with the said James Burbage that they should and\r\n     would at any time within the ten years next ensuing at or\r\n     upon the lawful request or demand of the said James Burbage\r\n     make or cause to be made to the said James Burbage a new\r\n     lease or grant like to the same presents for the term of one\r\n     and twenty years more, to begin from the date of making the\r\n     same lease, yielding therefor the rent reserved in the\r\n     former indenture.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Quoted from Burbage _v._ Alleyn, Court of Requests,\r\n1600, Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 182. I have stripped the passage of some\r\nof its legal verbiage.]\r\n\r\nFourthly, it was agreed that at any time before the expiration of the\r\nlease, Burbage might take down and carry away to his own use any\r\nbuilding that in the mean time he might have erected on the vacant\r\nground for the purpose of a playhouse:\r\n\r\n     And farther, the said Gyles Alleyn and Sara his wife did\r\n     covenant and grant to the said James Burbage that it should\r\n     and might be lawful to the said James Burbage (in\r\n     consideration of the imploying and bestowing the foresaid\r\n     two hundred pounds in forme aforesaid) at any time or times\r\n     before the end of the said term of one and twenty years, to\r\n     have, take down, and carry away to his own proper use for\r\n     ever all such buildings and other things as should be\r\n     builded, erected, or set up in or upon the gardens and void\r\n     grounds by the said James, either for a theatre or playing\r\n     place, or for any other lawful use, without any stop, claim,\r\n     let, trouble, or interruption of the said Gyles Alleyn and\r\n     Sara his wife.[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Quoted from Burbage _v._ Alleyn, Court of Requests,\r\n1600, Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 182.]\r\n\r\nProtected by these specific terms, Burbage proceeded to the erection\r\nof his playhouse. He must have had faith and abundant courage, for he\r\nwas a poor man, quite unequal to the large expenditures called for by\r\nhis plans. A person who had known him for many years, deposed in 1592\r\nthat \"James Burbage was not at the time of the first beginning of the\r\nbuilding of the premises worth above one hundred marks[44] in all his\r\nsubstance, for he and this deponent were familiarly acquainted long\r\nbefore that time and ever since.\"[45] We are not surprised to learn,\r\ntherefore, that he was \"constrained to borrow diverse sums of money,\"\r\nand that he actually pawned the lease itself to a money-lender.[46]\r\nEven so, without assistance, we are told, he \"should never be able to\r\nbuild it, for it would cost five times as much as he was worth.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: That is, about £80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 134; cf. p. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 151. Cuthbert Burbage declared\r\nin 1635: \"The Theatre he built with many hundred pounds taken up at\r\ninterest.\" (Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 317.)]\r\n\r\nFortunately he had a wealthy brother-in-law, John Brayne,[47] a London\r\ngrocer, described as \"worth five hundred pounds at the least, and by\r\ncommon fame worth a thousand marks.\"[48] In some way Brayne became\r\ninterested in the new venture. Like Burbage, he believed that large\r\nprofits would flow from such a novel undertaking; and as a result he\r\nreadily agreed to share the expense of erecting and maintaining the\r\nbuilding. Years later members of the Brayne faction asserted that\r\nJames Burbage \"induced\" his brother-in-law to venture upon the\r\nenterprise by unfairly representing the great profits to ensue;[49]\r\nbut the evidence, I think, shows that Brayne eagerly sought the\r\npartnership. Burbage himself asserted in 1588 that Brayne \"practiced\r\nto obtain some interest therein,\" and presumed \"that he might easily\r\ncompass the same by reason that he was natural brother\"; and that he\r\nvoluntarily offered to \"bear and pay half the charges of the said\r\nbuilding then bestowed and thereafter to be bestowed\" in order \"that\r\nhe might have the moiety[50] of the above named Theatre.\"[51] As a\r\nfurther inducement, so the Burbages asserted, he promised that \"for\r\nthat he had no children,\" the moiety at his death should go to the\r\nchildren of James Burbage, \"whose advancement he then seemed greatly\r\nto tender.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The name is often spelled \"Braynes.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 139 _seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: That is, half-interest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nWhatever caused Brayne to interest himself in the venture, he quickly\r\nbecame fired with such hopes of great gain that he not only spent upon\r\nthe building all the money he could gather or borrow, but sold his\r\nstock of groceries for £146, disposed of his house for £100, even\r\npawned his clothes, and put his all into the new structure. The spirit\r\nin which he worked to make the venture a success, and the personal\r\nsacrifices that he and his wife made, fully deserve the quotation\r\nhere of two legal depositions bearing on the subject:\r\n\r\n     This deponent, being servant, in Bucklersbury, aforesaid, to\r\n     one Robert Kenningham, grocer, in which street the said John\r\n     Brayne dwelled also, and of the same trade, he, the said\r\n     Brayne, at the time he joined with the said James Burbage in\r\n     the aforesaid lease, was reputed among his neighbors to be\r\n     worth one thousand pounds at the least, and that after he\r\n     had joined with the said Burbage in the matter of the\r\n     building of the said Theatre, he began to slack his own\r\n     trade, and gave himself to the building thereof, and the\r\n     chief care thereof he took upon him, and hired workmen of\r\n     all sorts for that purpose, bought timber and all other\r\n     things belonging thereunto, and paid all. So as, in this\r\n     deponent's conscience, he bestowed thereupon for his owne\r\n     part the sum of one thousand marks at the least, in so much\r\n     as his affection was given so greatly to the finishing\r\n     thereof, in hope of great wealth and profit during their\r\n     lease, that at the last he was driven to sell to this\r\n     deponent's father his lease of the house wherein he dwelled\r\n     for £100, and to this deponent all such wares as he had left\r\n     and all that belonged thereunto remaining in the same, for\r\n     the sum of £146 and odd money, whereof this deponent did pay\r\n     for him to one Kymbre, an ironmonger in London, for iron\r\n     work which the said Brayne bestowed upon the said Theatre,\r\n     the sum of £40. And afterwards the said Brayne took the\r\n     matter of the said building so upon him as he was driven to\r\n     borrow money to supply the same, saying to this deponent\r\n     that his brother Burbage was not able to help the same, and\r\n     that he found not towards it above the value of fifty\r\n     pounds, some part in mony and the rest in stuff.[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 136.]\r\n\r\nIn reading the next deposition, one should bear in mind the fact that\r\nthe deponent, Robert Myles, was closely identified with the Brayne\r\nfaction, and was, therefore, a bitter enemy to the Burbages. Yet his\r\ntestimony, though prejudiced, gives us a vivid picture of Brayne's\r\nactivity in the building of the Theatre:\r\n\r\n     So the said John Brayne made a great sum of money of purpose\r\n     and intent to go to the building of the said playhouse, and\r\n     thereupon did provide timber and other stuff needful for the\r\n     building thereof, and hired carpenters and plasterers for\r\n     the same purpose, and paid the workmen continually. So as he\r\n     for his part laid out of his own purse and what upon credit\r\n     about the same to the sum of £600 or £700 at the least. And\r\n     in the same time, seeing the said James Burbage nothing able\r\n     either of himself or by his credit to contribute any like\r\n     sum towards the building thereof, being then to be finished\r\n     or else to be lost that had been bestowed upon it already,\r\n     the said Brayne was driven to sell his house he dwelled in\r\n     in Bucklersbury, and all his stock that was left, and give\r\n     up his trade, yea in the end to pawn and sell both his own\r\n     garments and his wife's, and to run in debt to many for\r\n     money, to finish the said playhouse, and so to employ\r\n     himself only upon that matter, and all whatsoever he could\r\n     make, to his utter undoing, for he saieth that in the latter\r\n     end of the finishing thereof, the said Brayne and his wife,\r\n     the now complainants, were driven to labor in the said work\r\n     for saving of some of the charge in place of two laborers,\r\n     whereas the said James Burbage went about his own business,\r\n     and at sometimes when he did take upon him to do some thing\r\n     in the said work, he would be and was allowed a workman's\r\n     hire as other the workman there had.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Brayne _v._ Burbage, 1592. Printed in full by Wallace,\r\n_op cit._ p. 141.]\r\n\r\nThe last fling at Burbage is quite gratuitous; yet it is probably true\r\nthat the main costs of erecting the playhouse fell upon the shoulders\r\nof Brayne. The evidence is contradictory; some persons assert that\r\nBurbage paid half the cost of the building,[54] others that Brayne\r\npaid nearly all,[55] and still others content themselves with saying\r\nthat Brayne paid considerably more than half. The last statement may\r\nbe accepted as true. The assertion of Gyles Alleyn in 1601, that the\r\nTheatre was \"erected at the costs and charges of one Brayne and not of\r\nthe said James Burbage, to the value of one thousand marks,\"[56] is\r\ndoubtless incorrect; more correct is the assertion of Robert Myles,\r\nexecutor of the Widow Brayne's will, in 1597: \"The said John Brayne\r\ndid join with the said James [Burbage] in the building aforesaid, and\r\ndid expend thereupon greater sums than the said James, that is to say,\r\nat least five or six hundred pounds.\"[57] Since there is evidence\r\nthat the playhouse ultimately cost about £700,[58] we might hazard the\r\nguess that of this sum Brayne furnished about £500,[59] and Burbage\r\nabout £200. To equalize the expenditure it was later agreed that \"the\r\nsaid Brayne should take and receive all the rents and profits of the\r\nsaid Theatre to his own use until he should be answered such sums of\r\nmoney which he had laid out for and upon the same Theatre more than\r\nthe said Burbage had done.\"[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 213, 217, 263, 265, _et al._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 137, 141, 142, 148, 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Alleyn _v._ Burbage, Star Chamber Proceedings, 1601-02;\r\nprinted by Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Myles _v._ Burbage and Alleyn, 1597; printed by Wallace,\r\n_op. cit._, p. 159; cf. pp. 263, 106, 152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: This agrees with the claim of Brayne's widow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 120.]\r\n\r\nBut if Burbage at the outset was \"nothing able to contribute any\"\r\ngreat sum of ready money towards the building of the first playhouse,\r\nhe did contribute other things equally if not more important. In the\r\nfirst place, he conceived the idea, and he carried it as far towards\r\nrealization as his means allowed. In the second place, he planned the\r\nbuilding--its stage as well as its auditorium--to meet the special\r\ndemands of the actors and the comfort of the audience. This called for\r\nbold originality and for ingenuity of a high order, for, it must be\r\nremembered, he had no model to study--he was designing the first\r\nstructure of its kind in England.[61] For this task he was well\r\nprepared. In the first place, he was an actor of experience; in the\r\nsecond place, he was the manager of one of the most important troupes\r\nin England; and, in the third place, he was by training and early\r\npractice a carpenter and builder. In other words, he had exact\r\nknowledge of what was needed, and the practical skill to meet those\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Mr. E.K. Chambers (_The Mediæval Stage_, I, 383, note 2;\r\nII, 190, note 4) calls attention to a \"theatre\" belonging to the city\r\nof Essex as early as 1548. Possibly the Latin document he cites\r\nreferred to an amphitheatre of some sort near the city which was used\r\nfor dramatic performances; at any rate \"in theatro\" does not\r\nnecessarily imply the existence of a playhouse (cf., for example, _op.\r\ncit._, I, 81-82). There is also a reference (quoted by Chambers, _op.\r\ncit._, II, 191, note 1, from _Norfolk Archæology_, XI, 336) to a\r\n\"game-house\" built by the corporation of Yarmouth in 1538 for dramatic\r\nperformances. What kind of house this was we do not know, but the\r\ncorporation leased it for other purposes, with the proviso that it\r\nshould be available \"at all such times as any interludes or plays\r\nshould be ministered or played.\" Howes, in his continuation of Stow's\r\n_Annals_ (1631), p. 1004, declares that before Burbage's time he\r\n\"neither knew, heard, nor read of any such theatres, set stages, or\r\nplayhouses as have been purposely built, within man's memory\"; and\r\nCuthbert Burbage confidently asserted that his father \"was the first\r\nbuilder of playhouses\"--an assertion which, I think, cannot well be\r\ndenied.]\r\n\r\nThe building that he designed and erected he named--as by virtue of\r\npriority he had a right to do--\"The Theatre.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Theatre, unfortunately, we have no pictorial representation,\r\nand no formal description, so that our knowledge of its size, shape,\r\nand general arrangement must be derived from scattered and\r\nmiscellaneous sources. That the building was large we may feel sure;\r\nthe cost of its erection indicates as much. The Fortune, one of the\r\nlargest and handsomest of the later playhouses, cost only £520, and\r\nthe Hope, also very large, cost £360. The Theatre, therefore, built at\r\na cost of £700, could not have been small. It is commonly referred to,\r\neven so late as 1601, as \"the great house called the Theatre,\" and the\r\nauthor of _Skialetheia_ (1598) applied to it the significant adjective\r\n\"vast.\" Burbage, no doubt, had learned from his experience as manager\r\nof a troupe the pecuniary advantage of having an auditorium large\r\nenough to receive all who might come. Exactly how many people his\r\nbuilding could accommodate we cannot say. The Reverend John Stockwood,\r\nin 1578, exclaims bitterly: \"Will not a filthy play, with the blast of\r\na trumpet, sooner call thither a thousand than an hour's tolling of\r\nthe bell bring to the sermon a hundred?\"[62] And Fleetwood, the City\r\nRecorder, in describing a quarrel which took place in 1584 \"at Theatre\r\ndoor,\" states that \"near a thousand people\" quickly assembled when the\r\nquarrel began.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: The rest of his speech indicates that he had the Theatre\r\nin mind. The passage, of course, is rhetorical.]\r\n\r\nIn shape the building was probably polygonal, or circular. I see no\r\ngood reason for supposing that it was square; Johannes de Witt\r\nreferred to it as an \"amphitheatre,\" and the Curtain, erected the\r\nfollowing year in imitation, was probably polygonal.[63] It was built\r\nof timber, and its exterior, no doubt, was--as in the case of\r\nsubsequent playhouses--of lime and plaster. The interior consisted of\r\nthree galleries surrounding an open space called the \"yard.\" The\r\nGerman traveler, Samuel Kiechel, who visited London in the autumn of\r\n1585, described the playhouses--i.e., the Theatre and the Curtain--as\r\n\"singular [_sonderbare_] houses, which are so constructed that they\r\nhave about three galleries, one above the other.\"[64] And Stephen\r\nGosson, in _Plays Confuted_ (_c._ 1581) writes: \"In the playhouses at\r\nLondon, it is the fashion for youths to go first into the yard, and to\r\ncarry their eye through every gallery; then, like unto ravens, where\r\nthey spy the carrion, thither they fly, and press as near to the\r\nfairest as they can.\" The \"yard\" was unroofed, and all persons there\r\nhad to stand during the entire performance. The galleries, however,\r\nwere protected by a roof, were divided into \"rooms,\" and were provided\r\nfor the most part with seats. Gyles Alleyn inserted in the lease he\r\ngranted to Burbage the following condition:\r\n\r\n     And further, that it shall or may [be] lawful for the said\r\n     Gyles and for his wife and family, upon lawful request\r\n     therefor made to the said James Burbage, his executors or\r\n     assigns, to enter or come into the premises, and there in\r\n     some one of the upper rooms to have such convenient place to\r\n     sit or stand to see such plays as shall be there played,\r\n     freely without anything therefor paying.[65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: One cannot be absolutely sure, yet the whole history of\r\nearly playhouses indicates that the Theatre was polygonal (or\r\ncircular) in shape. The only reason for suspecting that it might have\r\nbeen square, doubtfully presented by T.S. Graves in \"The Shape of the\r\nFirst London Theatre\" (_The South Atlantic Quarterly_, July, 1914),\r\nseems to me to deserve no serious consideration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Quoted by W.B. Rye, _England as Seen by Foreigners_, p.\r\n88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 177.]\r\n\r\nThe stage was a platform, projecting into the yard, with a\r\ntiring-house at the rear, and a balcony overhead. The details of the\r\nstage, no doubt, were subject to alteration as experience suggested,\r\nfor its materials were of wood, and histrionic and dramatic art were\r\nboth undergoing rapid development.[66] The furnishings and\r\ndecorations, as in the case of modern playhouses, seem to have been\r\nornate. Thus T[homas] W[hite], in _A Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse,\r\non Sunday the Thirde of November, 1577_, exclaims: \"Behold the\r\nsumptuous Theatre houses, a continual monument of London's\r\nprodigality\"; John Stockwood, in _A Sermon Preached at Paules Cross,\r\n1578_, refers to it as \"the gorgeous playing place erected in the\r\nFields\"; and Gabriel Harvey could think of no more appropriate epithet\r\nfor it than \"painted\"--\"painted theatres,\" \"painted stage.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: There is no reason whatever to suppose, with Ordish,\r\nMantzius, Lawrence, and others, that the stage of the Theatre was\r\nremovable; for although the building was frequently used by fencers,\r\ntumblers, etc., it was never, so far as I can discover, used for\r\nanimal-baiting.]\r\n\r\nThe building was doubtless used for dramatic performances in the\r\nautumn of 1576, although it was not completed until later; John\r\nGrigges, one of the carpenters, deposed that Burbage and Brayne\r\n\"finished the same with the help of the profits that grew by plays\r\nused there before it was fully finished.\"[67] Access to the playhouse\r\nwas had chiefly by way of Finsbury Field and a passage made by Burbage\r\nthrough the brick wall mentioned in the lease.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: For depositions to this effect see Halliwell-Phillipps,\r\n_Outlines_, I, 350 ff.]\r\n\r\nThe terms under which the owners let it to the actors were simple: the\r\nactors retained as their share the pennies paid at the outer doors for\r\ngeneral admission, and the proprietors received as their share the\r\nmoney paid for seats or standings in the galleries.[69] Cuthbert\r\nBurbage states in 1635: \"The players that lived in those first times\r\nhad only the profits arising from the doors, but now the players\r\nreceive all the comings in at the doors to themselves, and half the\r\ngalleries.\"[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: I suspect that the same terms were made with the actors\r\nby the proprietors of the inn-playhouses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 317.]\r\n\r\nBefore the expiration of two years, or in the early summer of 1578,\r\nBurbage and Brayne began to quarrel about the division of the money\r\nwhich fell to their share. Brayne apparently thought that he should at\r\nonce be indemnified for all the money he had expended on the playhouse\r\nin excess of Burbage; and he accused Burbage of \"indirect\r\ndealing\"--there were even whispers of \"a secret key\" to the \"common\r\nbox\" in which the money was kept.[71] Finally they agreed to \"submit\r\nthemselves to the order and arbitrament of certain persons for the\r\npacification thereof,\" and together they went to the shop of a notary\r\npublic to sign a bond agreeing to abide by the decision of the\r\narbitrators. There they \"fell a reasoning together,\" in the course of\r\nwhich Brayne asserted that he had disbursed in the Theatre \"three\r\ntimes at the least as much more as the sum then disbursed by the said\r\nJames Burbage.\" In the end Brayne unwisely hinted at \"ill dealing\" on\r\nthe part of Burbage, whereupon \"Burbage did there strike him with his\r\nfist, and so they went together by the ears, in so much,\" says the\r\nnotary, \"that this deponent could hardly part them.\" After they were\r\nparted, they signed a bond of £200 to abide by the decision of the\r\narbitrators. The arbitrators, John Hill and Richard Turnor, \"men of\r\ngreat honesty and credit,\" held their sessions \"in the Temple church,\"\r\nwhither they summoned witnesses. Finally, on July 12, 1578, after\r\n\"having thoroughly heard\" both sides, they awarded that the profits\r\nfrom the Theatre should be used first to pay the debts upon the\r\nbuilding, then to pay Brayne the money he had expended in excess of\r\nBurbage, and thereafter to be shared \"in divident equally between\r\nthem.\"[72] These conditions, however, were not observed, and the\r\nfailure to observe them led to much subsequent discord.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 142, 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: For the history of this quarrel, and for other details\r\nof the award see Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 102, 119, 138, 142, 143,\r\n148, 152.]\r\n\r\nThe arbitrators also decided that \"if occasion should move them\r\n[Burbage and Brayne] to borrow any sum of money for the payment of\r\ntheir debts owing for any necessary use and thing concerning the said\r\nTheatre, that then the said James Burbage and the said John Brayne\r\nshould _join_ in pawning or mortgageing of their estate and interest\r\nof and in the same.\"[73] An occasion for borrowing money soon arose.\r\nSo on September 26, 1579, the two partners mortgaged the Theatre to\r\nJohn Hide for the sum of £125 8_s._ 11_d._ At the end of a year, by\r\nnon-payment, they forfeited the mortgage, and the legal title to the\r\nproperty passed to Hide. It seems, however, that because of some\r\nspecial clause in the mortgage Hide was unable to expel Burbage and\r\nBrayne, or to dispose of the property to others. Hence he took no\r\nsteps to seize the Theatre; but he constantly annoyed the occupants by\r\narrest and otherwise. This unfortunate transference of the title to\r\nHide was the cause of serious quarreling between the Burbages and the\r\nBraynes, and finally led to much litigation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nIn 1582 a more immediate disaster threatened the owners of the\r\nTheatre. One Edmund Peckham laid claim to the land on which the\r\nplayhouse had been built, and brought suit against Alleyn for\r\nrecovery. More than that, Peckham tried to take actual possession of\r\nthe playhouse, so that Burbage \"was fain to find men at his own charge\r\nto keep the possession thereof from the said Peckham and his\r\nservants,\" and was even \"once in danger of his own life by keeping\r\npossession thereof.\" As a result of this state of affairs, Burbage\r\n\"was much disturbed and troubled in his possession of the Theatre, and\r\ncould not quietly and peaceably enjoy the same. And therefore the\r\nplayers forsook the said Theatre, to his great loss.\"[74] In order to\r\nreimburse himself in some measure for this loss Burbage retained £30\r\nof the rental due to Alleyn. The act led to a bitter quarrel with\r\nAlleyn, and figured conspicuously in the subsequent litigation that\r\ncame near overwhelming the Theatre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 201, 239, 240, 242.]\r\n\r\nIn 1585 Burbage, having spent the stipulated £200 in repairing and\r\nrebuilding the tenements on the premises, sought to renew the lease,\r\naccording to the original agreement, for the extended period of\r\ntwenty-one years. On November 20, 1585, he engaged three skilled\r\nworkmen to view the buildings and estimate the sum he had disbursed in\r\nimprovements. They signed a formal statement to the effect that in\r\ntheir opinion at least £220 had been thus expended on the premises.\r\nBurbage then \"tendered unto the said Alleyn a new lease devised by his\r\ncounsel, ready written and engrossed, with labels and wax thereunto\r\naffixed, agreeable to the covenant.\" But Alleyn refused to sign the\r\ndocument. He maintained that the new lease was not a verbatim copy of\r\nthe old lease, that £200 had not been expended on the buildings, and\r\nthat Burbage was a bad tenant and owed him rent. In reality, Alleyn\r\nwanted to extort a larger rental than £14 for the property, which had\r\ngreatly increased in value.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 1586, Burbage engaged six men, all expert laborers, to\r\nview the buildings again and estimate the cost of the improvements.\r\nThey expressed the opinion in writing that Burbage had expended at\r\nleast £240 in developing the property.[75] Still Alleyn refused to\r\nsign an extension of the lease. His conduct must have been very\r\nexasperating to the owner of the Theatre. Cuthbert Burbage tells us\r\nthat his father \"did often in gentle manner solicit and require the\r\nsaid Gyles Alleyn for making a new lease of the said premises\r\naccording to the purporte and effect of the said covenant.\" But\r\ninvariably Alleyn found some excuse for delay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 229, 234, 228, 233.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Brayne, in August, 1586, led John Hide, who by reason of\r\nthe defaulted mortgage was legally the owner of the Theatre, to\r\nredouble his efforts to collect his debt. He \"gave it out in speech\r\nthat he had set over and assigned the said lease and bonds to one\r\nGeorge Clough, his ... father-in-law (but in truth he did not so),\"\r\nand \"the said Clough, his father-in-law, did go about to put the said\r\ndefendant [Burbage] out of the Theatre, or at least did threaten to\r\nput him out.\" As we have seen, there was a clause in the mortgage\r\nwhich prevented Hide from ejecting Burbage;[76] yet Clough was able to\r\nmake so much trouble, \"divers and sundry times\" visiting the Theatre,\r\nthat at last Burbage undertook to settle the debt out of the profits\r\nof the playhouse. As Robert Myles deposed in 1592, Burbage allowed the\r\nwidow of Brayne for \"a certain time to take and receive the one-half\r\nof the profits of the galleries of the said Theatre ... then on a\r\nsudden he would not suffer her to receive any more of the profits\r\nthere, saying that he must take and receive all till he had paid the\r\ndebts. And then she was constrained, as his servant, to gather the\r\nmoney and to deliver it unto him.\"[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Ibid._, p. 105.]\r\n\r\nFor some reason, however, the debt was not settled, and Hide continued\r\nhis futile demands. Several times Burbage offered to pay the sum in\r\nfull if the title of the Theatre were made over to his son Cuthbert\r\nBurbage; and Brayne's widow made similar offers in an endeavor to gain\r\nthe entire property for herself. But Hide, who seems to have been an\r\nhonest man, always declared that since Burbage and Brayne \"did jointly\r\nmortgage it unto him\" he was honor-bound to assign the property back\r\nto Burbage and the widow of Brayne jointly. So matters stood for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, in 1589, Hide declared that \"since he had forborne\r\nhis money so long, he could do it no more, so as they that came first\r\nshould have it of him.\" Thereupon Cuthbert Burbage came bringing not\r\nonly the money in hand, but also a letter from his master and patron,\r\nWalter Cape, gentleman usher to the Lord High Treasurer, requesting\r\nHide to make over the Theatre to Cuthbert, and promising in return to\r\nassist Hide with the Lord Treasurer when occasion arose. Under this\r\npressure, Hide accepted full payment of his mortgage, and made over\r\nthe title of the property to Cuthbert Burbage. Thus Brayne's widow was\r\nlegally excluded from any share in the ownership of the Theatre. Myles\r\ndeposed, in 1592, that henceforth Burbage \"would not suffer her to\r\nmeddle in the premises, but thrust her out of all.\"\r\n\r\nThis led at once to a suit, in which Robert Myles acted for the widow.\r\nHe received an order from the Court of Chancery in her favor, and\r\narmed with this, and accompanied by two other persons, he came on\r\nNovember 16, 1590, to Burbage's \"dwelling house near the Theatre,\"\r\ncalled to the door Cuthbert Burbage, and in \"rude and exclamable sort\"\r\ndemanded \"the moiety of the said Theatre.\" James Burbage \"being within\r\nthe house, hearing a noise at the door, went to the door, and there\r\nfound his son, the said Cuthbert, and the said Myles speaking loud\r\ntogether.\" Words were bandied, until finally Burbage, \"dared by the\r\nsame Myles with great threats and words that he would do this and\r\ncould do that,\" lost his temper, and threatened to beat Myles off the\r\nground.[78]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 57, 60, 62.]\r\n\r\nNext the widow, attended by Robert Myles and others, visited the home\r\nof the Burbages \"to require them to perform the said award\" of the\r\ncourt. They were met by James Burbage's wife, who \"charged them to go\r\nout of her grounds, or else she would make her son break their knaves'\r\nheads.\" Aroused by this noise, \"James Burbage, her husband, looking\r\nout a window upon them, called the complainant [Widow Brayne]\r\nmurdering whore, and ... the others villaines, rascals, and knaves.\"\r\nAnd when Mistress Brayne spoke of the order of the court, \"he cryed\r\nunto her, 'Go, go. A cart, a cart for you! I will obey no such order,\r\nnor I care not for any such orders, and therefore it were best for you\r\nand your companions to be packing betimes, for if my son [Cuthbert]\r\ncome he will thump you hence!'\" Just then Cuthbert did \"come home, and\r\nin very hot sort bid them get thence, or else he would set them\r\nforwards, saying 'I care for no such order. The Chancery shall not\r\ngive away what I have paid for.'\" And so, after \"great and horrible\r\noathes\" by James Burbage and his son, the widow and her attendants\r\n\"went their ways.\"[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Ibid._, p. 121.]\r\n\r\nReceiving thus no satisfaction from these visits to the home of James\r\nBurbage, the widow and Robert Myles came several times to the Theatre,\r\nbearing the order of the court in their hands; but each time they were\r\nrailed upon and driven out. Finally, the widow, with her ever-faithful\r\nadjutant Robert Myles, his son Ralph, and his business partner,\r\nNicholas Bishop, went \"to the Theatre upon a play-day to stand at the\r\ndoor that goeth up to the galleries of the said Theatre to take and\r\nreceive for the use of the said Margaret half of the money that should\r\nbe given to come up into the said gallery.\" In the Theatre they were\r\nmet by Richard Burbage, then about nineteen years old, and his mother,\r\nwho \"fell upon the said Robert Myles and beat him with a broom staff,\r\ncalling him murdering knave.\" When Myles's partner, Bishop, ventured\r\nto protest at this contemptuous treatment of the order of the court,\r\n\"the said Richard Burbage,\" so Bishop deposed, \"scornfully and\r\ndisdainfully playing with this deponent's nose, said that if he dealt\r\nin the matter, he would beat him also, and did challenge the field of\r\nhim at that time.\" One of the actors then coming in, John\r\nAlleyn--brother of the immortal Edward Alleyn--\"found the foresaid\r\nRichard Burbage, the youngest son of the said James Burbage, there\r\nwith a broom staff in his hand; of whom when this deponent Alleyn\r\nasked what stir was there, he answered in laughing phrase how they\r\ncame for a moiety, 'But,' quod he (holding up the said broom staff)\r\n'I have, I think, delivered him a moiety with this, and sent them\r\npacking.'\" Alleyn thereupon warned the Burbages that Myles could bring\r\nan action of assault and battery against them. \"'Tush,' quod the\r\nfather, 'no, I warrant you; but where my son hath now beat him hence,\r\nmy sons, if they will be ruled by me, shall at their next coming\r\nprovide charged pistols, with powder and hempseed, to shoot them in\r\nthe legs.'\"[80]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 63, 97, 100, 101, 114.]\r\n\r\nBut if the Burbages could laugh at the efforts of Myles and the widow\r\nto secure a moiety of the Theatre from Cuthbert, they were seriously\r\ntroubled by the continued refusal of Gyles Alleyn to renew the lease.\r\nJames Burbage many times urged his landlord to fulfill the original\r\nagreement, but in vain. At last, Alleyn, \"according to his own will\r\nand discretion, did cause a draft of a lease to be drawn, wherein were\r\ninserted many unreasonable covenants.\" The new conditions imposed by\r\nAlleyn were: (1) that Burbage should pay a rental of £24 instead of\r\n£14 a year; (2) that he should use the Theatre as a place for acting\r\nfor only five years after the expiration of the original\r\ntwenty-one-year lease, and should then convert the building to other\r\nuses; (3) that he should ultimately leave the building in the\r\npossession of Alleyn.[81] The first and third conditions, though\r\nunjust, Burbage was willing to accept, but the second condition--that\r\nhe should cease to use the Theatre for plays--he \"utterly refused\" to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: See Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 195, 212, 216, 250, 258,\r\n_et al._]\r\n\r\nFinally, perceiving that it was useless to deal further with Alleyn,\r\nhe made plans to secure a new playhouse in the district of\r\nBlackfriars, a district which, although within the city walls, was not\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the city authorities. He purchased there the\r\nold Blackfriars refectory for £600, and then at great expense made the\r\nrefectory into a playhouse. But certain influential noblemen and\r\nothers living near by protested against this, and the Privy Council\r\nordered that the building should not be used as a public playhouse.\r\nAll this belongs mainly to the history of the Second Blackfriars\r\nPlayhouse, and for further details the reader is referred to the\r\nchapter dealing with that theatre.\r\n\r\nShortly after the order of the Privy Council cited above, Burbage\r\ndied, just two months before the expiration of his lease from Alleyn;\r\nand the Theatre with all its troubles passed to his son Cuthbert. By\r\nevery means in his power Cuthbert sought to induce Alleyn to renew the\r\nlease: \"Your said subject was thereof possessed, and being so\r\npossessed, your said servant did often require the said Alleyn and\r\nSara his wife to make unto him the said new lease of the premises,\r\naccording to the agreement of the said indenture.\" Cuthbert's\r\nimportunity in the matter is clearly set forth in a deposition by\r\nHenry Johnson, one of Alleyn's tenants. It was Alleyn's custom to come\r\nto London at each of the four pay terms of the year, and stop at the\r\nGeorge Inn in Shoreditch to receive his rents; and on such occasions\r\nJohnson often observed Cuthbert's entreaties with Alleyn. In his\r\ndeposition he says that he \"knoweth that the said complainant\r\n[Cuthbert Burbage] hath many times labored and entreated the defendant\r\n[Gyles Alleyn] to make him a new lease of the premises in question,\r\nfor this deponent sayeth that many times when the defendant hath come\r\nup to London to receive his rents, he, this deponent, hath been with\r\nhim paying him certain rent; and then he hath seen the plaintiff with\r\nhis landlord, paying his rent likewise; and then, finding opportunity,\r\nthe plaintiff would be intreating the defendant to make him a new\r\nlease of the premises in question; and sayeth that it is at least\r\nthree years since [i.e., in 1597] he, this deponent, first heard the\r\nplaintiff labor and entreat the defendant for a new lease.\"[82]\r\nCuthbert tells us that Alleyn did not positively refuse to renew the\r\nlease, \"but for some causes, which he feigned, did defer the same from\r\ntime to time, but yet gave hope to your subject, and affirmed that he\r\nwould make him such a lease.\"[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Ibid._, p. 184.]\r\n\r\nCuthbert's anxiety in this matter is explained by the fact that the\r\nold lease gave him the right to tear down the Theatre and carry away\r\nthe timber and other materials to his own use, provided he did so\r\nbefore the expiration of the twenty-one years. Yet, relying on\r\nAlleyn's promises to renew the lease, he \"did forbear to pull downe\r\nand carry away the timber and stuff employed for the said Theatre and\r\nplaying-house at the end of the said first term of one and twenty\r\nyears.\" A failure to renew the lease would mean, of course, the loss\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\nAlleyn, though deferring to sign a new lease, allowed Burbage to\r\ncontinue in possession of the property at \"the old rent of £14.\" Yet\r\nthe Theatre seems not to have been used for plays after the original\r\nlease expired.[84] The Lord Chamberlain's Company, which had been\r\noccupying the Theatre, and of which Richard Burbage was the chief\r\nactor, had moved to the Curtain; and the author of _Skialetheia_,\r\nprinted in 1598, refers to the old playhouse as empty: \"But see,\r\nyonder, one, like the unfrequented Theatre, walks in dark silence and\r\nvast solitude.\"[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: The lease expired on April 13, 1597; on July 28 the\r\nPrivy Council closed all playhouses until November. The references to\r\nthe Theatre in _The Remembrancia_ (see The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 78) do not necessarily imply that the building was\r\nthen actually used by the players.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: The same fact is revealed in the author's remark, \"If my\r\ndispose persuade me to a play, I'le to the Rose or Curtain,\" for at\r\nthis time only the Chamberlain's Men and the Admiral's Men were\r\nallowed to play.]\r\n\r\nTo Cuthbert Burbage such a state of affairs was intolerable, and on\r\nSeptember 29, 1598, he made a new appeal to Alleyn. Alleyn proffered a\r\nlease already drawn up, but Cuthbert would not \"accept thereof\"\r\nbecause of the \"very unreasonable covenants therein contained.\"[86]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 216, 249.]\r\n\r\nShortly after this fruitless interview, or late in 1598, Gyles Alleyn\r\nresolved to take advantage of the fact that Cuthbert Burbage had not\r\nremoved the Theatre before the expiration of the first twenty-one\r\nyears. He contended that since Cuthbert had \"suffered the same there\r\nto continue till the expiration of the said term ... the right and\r\ninterest of the said Theatre was both in law and conscience absolutely\r\nvested\" now in himself; accordingly he planned \"to pull down the same,\r\nand to convert the wood and timber thereof to some better use for the\r\nbenefit\" of himself.[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Ibid._, pp. 277, 288.]\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for Alleyn, Cuthbert Burbage \"got intelligence\" of\r\nthis purpose, and at once set himself to the task of saving his\r\nproperty. He and his brother Richard, the great actor, took into their\r\nconfidence the chief members of the Lord Chamberlain's Company, then\r\nperforming at the Curtain Playhouse, namely William Shakespeare, John\r\nHeminges, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, and William Kempe. These\r\nmen agreed to form with the Burbages a syndicate to finance the\r\nerection of a new playhouse. The two Burbages agreed to bear one-half\r\nthe expense, including the timber and other materials of the old\r\nTheatre, and the five actors promised to supply the other half.\r\nTogether they leased a suitable plot of land on the Bankside near\r\nHenslowe's Rose, the lease dating from December 25, 1598. These\r\ndetails having been arranged, it remained only for the Burbages to\r\nsave their building from the covetousness of Alleyn.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 28, 1598,[88] Alleyn being absent in the\r\ncountry, Cuthbert Burbage, his brother Richard, his friend William\r\nSmith, \"of Waltham Cross, in the County of Hartford, gentleman,\" Peter\r\nStreet, \"cheefe carpenter,\" and twelve others described as \"laborers\r\nsuch as wrought for wages,\" gathered at the Theatre and began to tear\r\ndown the building. We learn that the widow of James Burbage \"was\r\nthere, and did see the doing thereof, and liked well of it\";[89] and\r\nwe may suspect that at some time during the day Shakespeare and the\r\nother actors were present as interested spectators.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: The date, January 20, 1599, seems to be an error.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 238.]\r\n\r\nThe episode is thus vividly described by the indignant Gyles Allen:\r\n\r\n     The said Cuthbert Burbage, having intelligence of your\r\n     subject's purpose herein, and unlawfully combining and\r\n     confederating himself with the said Richard Burbage and one\r\n     Peter Street, William Smith, and diverse other persons to\r\n     the number of twelve, to your subject unknown, did about\r\n     the eight and twentieth day of December, in the one and\r\n     fortieth year of your highness reign, and sithence your\r\n     highness last and general pardon, by the confederacy\r\n     aforesaid, riotously assembled themselves together, and then\r\n     and there armed themselves with diverse and many unlawful\r\n     and offensive weapons, as namely swords, daggers, bills,\r\n     axes, and such like, and so armed did then repair unto the\r\n     said Theatre, and then and there armed as aforesaid, in very\r\n     riotous, outrageous, and forceable manner, and contrary to\r\n     the laws of your highness realm, attempted to pull down the\r\n     said Theatre. Whereupon, diverse of your subjects, servants\r\n     and farmers, then going about in peaceable manner to procure\r\n     them to desist from that unlawful enterprise, they, the said\r\n     riotous persons aforesaid, notwithstanding procured then\r\n     therein with great violence, not only then and there\r\n     forcibly and riotously resisting your subjects, servants,\r\n     and farmers, but also then and there pulling, breaking, and\r\n     throwing down the said Theatre in very outrageous, violent,\r\n     and riotous sort.[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 278-79. This document was\r\ndiscovered by J.O. Halliwell-Phillipps, who printed extracts in his\r\n_Outlines_. See also Ordish, _Early London Theatres_, pp. 75-76.]\r\n\r\nThe workmen, under the expert direction of Peter Street, carried the\r\ntimber and other materials of the old Theatre to the tract of land on\r\nthe Bankside recently leased by the new syndicate--as Gyles Alleyn\r\nputs it, \"did then also in most forcible and riotous manner take and\r\ncarry away from thence all the wood and timber thereof unto the\r\nBankside, in the Parish of St. Mary Overies, and there erected a new\r\nplayhouse with the said timber and wood.\"\r\n\r\nThe playhouse thus erected was, of course, an entirely new structure.\r\nNearly a quarter of a century had elapsed since James Burbage designed\r\nthe old Theatre, during which time a great development had taken place\r\nboth in histrionic art and in play writing; and, no doubt, many\r\nimprovements were possible in the stage and in the auditorium to\r\nprovide better facilities for the actors and greater comfort for the\r\nspectators. In designing such improvements the architect had the\r\nadvice and help of the actors, including Shakespeare; and he succeeded\r\nin producing a playhouse that was a model of excellence. The name\r\nselected by the syndicate for their new building was \"The Globe.\" For\r\nfurther details as to its construction, and for its subsequent\r\nhistory, the reader is referred to the chapter dealing with that\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWhen Gyles Alleyn learned that the Burbages had demolished the Theatre\r\nand removed the timber to the Bankside, he was deeply incensed, not\r\nonly at the loss of the building, but also, no doubt, at being\r\ncompletely outwitted. At once he instituted suit against Cuthbert\r\nBurbage; but he was so intemperate in his language and so reckless in\r\nhis charges that he weakened his case. The suit dragged for a few\r\nyears, was in part referred to Francis Bacon, and finally in the\r\nsummer of 1601 was dismissed. Thus the history of the first London\r\nplayhouse, which is chiefly the history of quarrels and litigation,\r\ncame to a close.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible now to indicate exactly the stay of the different\r\ntroupes at the Theatre; the evidence is scattered and incomplete, and\r\nthe inferences to be drawn are often uncertain.\r\n\r\nWhen the building was opened in 1576, it was, no doubt, occupied by\r\nthe Earl of Leicester's troupe, of which Burbage was the manager, and\r\nfor which, presumably, the structure had been designed. Yet other\r\ntroupes of players may also have been allowed to use the\r\nbuilding--when Leicester's Men were touring the provinces, or,\r\npossibly, on days when Leicester's Men did not act. This arrangement\r\nlasted about six years.\r\n\r\nIn 1582 the use of the Theatre was interrupted by the interference of\r\nPeckham. For a long time the actors \"could not enjoy the premises,\"\r\nand Burbage was forced to keep Peckham's servants out of the building\r\nwith an armed guard night and day. As a result of this state of\r\naffairs, Leicester's troupe was dissolved; \"many of the players,\" we\r\nare told, were driven away, and the rest \"forsook the said Theatre.\"\r\nThe last notice of these famous players is a record of their\r\nperformance at Court on February 10, 1583.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, in March, 1583, Tilney, the Master of the Revels,\r\norganized under royal patronage a new company called the Queen's Men.\r\nFor this purpose he selected twelve of the best actors of the realm,\r\nincluding some of the members of Leicester's company.[91] The two\r\nbest-known actors in the new organization were the Queen's favorite\r\ncomedian, Richard Tarleton, the immortal \"Lord of Mirth,\" and John\r\nLanham, the leader and apparently the manager of the troupe. James\r\nBurbage, who may by this time, if not before, have retired from\r\nacting, was not included.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: For a list of the Queen's Men see Wallace, _op. cit._,\r\np. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe newly organized Queen's Men in all probability occupied the\r\nTheatre which had been left vacant by the dissolution of Leicester's\r\ncompany. Mr. Wallace denies this, mainly on the evidence of a permit\r\nissued by the Lord Mayor, November 28, 1583, granting the Queen's Men\r\nthe privilege of acting \"at the sign of the Bull [Inn] in Bishopgate\r\nStreet, and the sign of the Bell [Inn] in Gracious Street, and nowhere\r\nelse within this city.\" But this permit, I think, lends scant support\r\nto Mr. Wallace's contention. The Lord Mayor had no authority to issue\r\na license for the Queen's Men to play at the Theatre, for that\r\nstructure was outside the jurisdiction of the city. The Privy Council\r\nitself, no doubt, had issued such a general license when the company\r\nwas organized under royal patronage.[92] And now, ten months later,\r\non November 26, 1583, the Council sends to the Lord Mayor a request\r\n\"that Her Majesty's players may be suffered to play ... within the\r\ncity and liberties _between this and shrovetide next_\"[93]--in other\r\nwords, during the winter season when access to the Theatre was\r\ndifficult. It was customary for troupes to seek permission to act\r\nwithin the city during the winter months.[94] Thus the Queen's Men, in\r\na petition written probably in the autumn of the following year, 1584,\r\nrequested the Privy Council to dispatch \"favorable letters unto the\r\nLord Mayor of London to permit us to exercise within the city,\" and\r\nthe Lord Mayor refused, with the significant remark that \"if in winter\r\n... the foulness of season do hinder the passage into the fields to\r\nplay, the remedy is ill conceived to bring them into London.\"[95]\r\nObviously the Queen's Men were seeking permission to play in the city\r\nonly during the cold winter months; during the balmy spring, summer,\r\nand autumn months--for actors the best season of the year--they\r\noccupied their commodious playhouse in \"the fields.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Such a license would include also permission to act in\r\nthe provinces. This latter was soon needed, for shortly after their\r\norganization the Queen's Men were driven by the plague to tour the\r\nprovinces. They were in Cambridge on July 9, and probably returned to\r\nLondon shortly after. See Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Lord Hunsdon, on October 8, 1594, requested the Lord\r\nMayor to permit the Chamberlain's Men \"to play this winter time within\r\nthe city at the Cross Keys in Gracious Street.\" See The Malone\r\nSociety's _Collections_, I, 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 170, 172.]\r\n\r\nThat this playhouse for a time, at least, was the Theatre is indicated\r\nby several bits of evidence. Thus the author of _Martin's Month's\r\nMind_ (1589) speaks of \"twittle-twattles that I had learned in\r\nale-houses and at the Theatre of Lanham and his fellows.\" Again, Nash,\r\nin _Pierce Penniless_ (1592), writes: \"Tarleton at the Theatre made\r\njests of him\"; Harrington, in _The Metamorphosis of Ajax_ (1596):\r\n\"Which word was after admitted into the Theatre with great applause,\r\nby the mouth of Master Tarleton\"; and the author of _Tarlton's Newes\r\nout of Purgatory_ (_c._ 1589) represents Tarleton as connected with\r\nthe Theatre. Now, unless Lanham, Tarleton, and their \"fellows\" usually\r\nor sometimes acted at the Theatre, it is hard to understand these and\r\nother similar passages.\r\n\r\nThe following episode tends to prove the same thing. On June 18, 1584,\r\nWilliam Fleetwood, Recorder, wrote to Lord Burghley:[96]\r\n\r\n     Right honorable and my very good lord. Upon Whitsunday there\r\n     was a very good sermon preached at the new churchyard near\r\n     Bethelem, whereat my Lord Mayor was with his brethren; and\r\n     by reason no plays were the same day, all the city was\r\n     quiet. Upon Monday I was at the Court.... That night I\r\n     returned to London and found all the wards full of watchers;\r\n     the cause thereof was for that very near the Theatre or\r\n     Curtain, at the time of the plays, there lay a prentice\r\n     sleeping upon the grass; and one Challes, at Grostock, did\r\n     turn upon the toe upon the belly of the same prentice.\r\n     Whereupon the apprentice start up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: The letter is printed in full in The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 164.]\r\n\r\nIn the altercation that followed, Challes remarked that \"prentices\r\nwere but the scum of the world.\" This led to a general rising of\r\napprentices, and much disorder throughout the city. Fleetwood records\r\nthe upshot thus:\r\n\r\n     Upon Sunday my Lord [Mayor] sent two aldermen to the court\r\n     for the suppressing and pulling down of the Theatre and\r\n     Curtain. All the Lords [of the Privy Council] agreed\r\n     thereunto saving my Lord Chamberlain and Mr.\r\n     Vice-Chamberlain. But we obtained a letter to suppress them\r\n     all. Upon the same night I sent for the Queen's Players [at\r\n     the Theatre?] and my Lord Arundel's Players [at the\r\n     Curtain?] and they all willingly obeyed the Lords's letters.\r\n     The chiefest of Her Highness's Players advised me to send\r\n     for the owner of the Theatre [James Burbage[97]], who was a\r\n     stubborn fellow, and to bind him. I did so. He sent me word\r\n     he was my Lord of Hundson's man, and that he would not come\r\n     at me; but he would in the morning ride to my lord.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: This could not have been Hide, as usually stated. Hide\r\nhad nothing to do with the management of the Theatre, and was not \"my\r\nLord of Hunsdon's man.\" Hide's connection with the Theatre as sketched\r\nin this chapter shows the absurdity of such an interpretation of the\r\ndocument.]\r\n\r\nThe natural inference from all this is that the Queen's Men and Lord\r\nArundel's Men were then playing _outside the city_ where they could be\r\ncontrolled only by \"the Lords's Letters\"; that the Queen's Men were\r\noccupying the Theatre, and that James Burbage was (as we know) not a\r\nmember of that company, but merely stood to them in the relation of\r\n\"owner of the Theatre.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Burbage meant by calling himself \"my Lord of Hunsdon's man\" is\r\nnot clear. Mr. Wallace contends that when Leicester's Men were\r\ndissolved, Burbage organized \"around the remnants of Leicester's\r\nCompany\" a troupe under the patronage of Lord Hunsdon, and that this\r\ntroupe, and not the Queen's Men, occupied the Theatre thereafter.[98]\r\nBut we hear of Hunsdon's Men at Ludlow in July, 1582; and we find them\r\npresenting a play at Court on December 27, 1582. Since Leicester's\r\ntroupe is recorded as acting at Court as late as February 10, 1583, it\r\nseems unlikely that Mr. Wallace's theory as to the origin of Hunsdon's\r\nMen is true. It may be, however, that after the dissolution of\r\nLeicester's Men, Burbage associated himself with Hunsdon's Men, and it\r\nmay be that he allowed that relatively unimportant company to occupy\r\nthe Theatre for a short time. Hunsdon's Men seem to have been mainly a\r\ntraveling troupe; Mr. Murray states that notices of them \"occur\r\nfrequently in the provinces,\" but we hear almost nothing of them in\r\nLondon. Indeed, at the time of the trouble described by Fleetwood,\r\nHunsdon's Men were in Bath.[99] If Burbage was a member of the troupe,\r\nhe certainly did not accompany them on their extended tours; and when\r\nthey played in London, if they used the Theatre, they must have used\r\nit jointly with the Queen's Men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 321.]\r\n\r\nLate in 1585 the Theatre was affiliated with the adjacent Curtain.\r\nBurbage and Brayne made an agreement with the proprietor of that\r\nplayhouse whereby the Curtain might be used \"as an easore\" [easer?] to\r\nthe Theatre, and \"the profits of the said two playhouses might for\r\nseven years space be in divident between them.\" This agreement, we\r\nknow, was carried out, but whether it led to an exchange of companies,\r\nor what effect it had upon the players, we cannot say. Possibly to\r\nthis period of joint management may be assigned the witticism of Dick\r\nTarleton recorded as having been uttered \"at the Curtain\" where the\r\nQueen's Men were then playing.[100] It may even be that as one result\r\nof the affiliation of the two houses the Queen's Men were transferred\r\nto the Curtain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Tarlton's Jests_, ed. by J.O. Halliwell, p. 16.\r\nTarleton died in 1588.]\r\n\r\nIn 1590, as we learn from the deposition of John Alleyn, the Theatre\r\nwas being used by the Admiral's Men.[101] This excellent company had\r\nbeen formed early in 1589 by the separation of certain leading players\r\nfrom Worcester's Men, and it had probably occupied the Theatre since\r\nits organization. Its star actor, Edward Alleyn, was then at the\r\nheight of his powers, and was producing with great success Marlowe's\r\nsplendid plays. We may suppose that the following passage refers to\r\nthe performance of the Admiral's Men at the Theatre:\r\n\r\n     He had a head of hair like one of my devils in _Dr.\r\n     Faustus_, when the old Theatre crackt and frightened the\r\n     audience.[102]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 101, 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _The Black Booke_, 1604.]\r\n\r\nLate in 1590 the Admiral's Men seem to have been on bad terms with\r\nBurbage,[103] and when John Alleyn made his deposition, February 6,\r\n1592, they had certainly left the Theatre. Mr. Greg, from entirely\r\ndifferent evidence, has concluded that they were dispersed in\r\n1591,[104] and this conclusion is borne out by the legal document\r\ncited above.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, 83. The Admiral's Men\r\nwere reorganized in 1594, and occupied the Rose under Henslowe's\r\nmanagement.]\r\n\r\nThe next company that we can definitely associate with the Theatre was\r\nthe famous Lord Chamberlain's Men. On April 16, 1594, Lord Strange,\r\nthe Earl of Derby, died, and the chief members of his troupe--William\r\nShakespeare, Richard Burbage, John Heminges, William Kempe, Thomas\r\nPope, George Bryan, and Augustine Phillips--organized a new company\r\nunder the patronage of the Lord Chamberlain. For ten days, in June,\r\n1594, they acted at Newington Butts under the management of Philip\r\nHenslowe, then went, probably at once, to the Theatre, which they made\r\ntheir home until the Burbage lease of the property expired in the\r\nspring of 1597. Here, among other famous plays, they produced the\r\noriginal _Hamlet_, thus referred to by Lodge in _Wit's Miserie_, 1596:\r\n\r\n     He looks as pale as the visard of the ghost which cries so\r\n     miserably at the Theatre, like an oyster-wife, \"Hamlet,\r\n     revenge!\"\r\n\r\nAnd here, too, they presented all of Shakespeare's early masterpieces.\r\n\r\nTheir connection with the building ceased in 1597 at the expiration of\r\nthe Burbage lease; but their association with the proprietors of the\r\nTheatre was permanent. Their subsequent history, as also the history\r\nof the Burbage brothers, will be found in the chapters dealing with\r\nthe Globe and the Second Blackfriars.[105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: For other but unimportant references to the Theatre see\r\nThe Malone Society's _Collections_, vol.

It was erected a short distance to the\r\nsouth of the Theatre,--that is, nearer the city,--and, like that\r\nbuilding, it adjoined Finsbury Field.[106] To the two playhouses the\r\naudiences came trooping over the meadows, in \"great multidudes,\" the\r\nLord Mayor tells us; and the author of _Tarlton's Newes out of\r\nPurgatory_ (_c._ 1589) describes their return to London thus: \"With\r\nthat I waked, and saw such concourse of people through the fields that\r\nI knew the play was done.\"[107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: The site is probably marked by Curtain Court in\r\nChasserau's survey of 1745, reproduced on page 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Ed. by J.O. Halliwell, for The Shakespeare Society\r\n(1844), p. 105.]\r\n\r\nThe new playhouse derived its name from the Curtain estate, on which\r\nit was erected.[108] This estate was formerly the property of the\r\nPriory of Holywell, and was described in 1538 as \"scituata et\r\nexistentia extra portas ejusdem nuper monasterii prope pasturam dicte\r\nnuper Priorisse, vocatam _the Curteine_.\"[109] Why it was so called\r\nis not clear. The name may have been derived from some previous owner\r\nof the property; it may, as Collier thought, have come from some early\r\nassociation with the walls (_curtains_) or defenses of the city; or,\r\nit may have come, as Tomlins suggests, from the mediæval Latin\r\n_cortina_, meaning a court, a close, a farm enclosure.[110] Whatever\r\nits origin--the last explanation seems the most plausible--the\r\ninteresting point is that it had no connection whatever with a stage\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: The Rose and the Red Bull derived their names in a\r\nsimilar way from the estates on which they were erected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 364.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Tomlins, _Origin of the Curtain Theatre, and Mistakes\r\nRegarding It_, in The Shakespeare Society's Papers (1844), p. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe building was probably opened to the London public in the summer or\r\nautumn of 1577. The first reference to it is found in T[homas]\r\nW[hite]'s _Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse on Sunday the Thirde of\r\nNovember, 1577_: \"Behold the sumptuous theatre houses, a continual\r\nmonument of London's prodigality and folly\";[111] and a reference to\r\nit by name appears in Northbrooke's _A Treatise_, licensed December,\r\n1577: \"Those places, also, which are made up and builded for such\r\nplays and interludes, as the Theatre and Curtain.\"[112]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: J.D. Wilson, _The Cambridge History of English\r\nLiterature_, VI, 435, says that this sermon was \"delivered at Paul's\r\ncross on 9 December, 1576 and, apparently, repeated on 3 November in\r\nthe following year.\" This is incorrect; White did preach a sermon at\r\nPaul's Cross on December 9, but not the sermon from which this\r\nquotation is drawn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Ed. by J.P. Collier, for The Shakespeare Society\r\n(1843), p. 85.]\r\n\r\nLike the Theatre, the Curtain was a peculiarly shaped building,\r\nspecially designed for acting; \"those playhouses that are erected and\r\nbuilt _only for such purposes_ ... namely the Curtain and the\r\nTheatre,\"[113] writes the Privy Council; and the German traveler,\r\nSamuel Kiechel, who visited London in 1585, describes them as\r\n\"_sonderbare_\" structures. They are usually mentioned together, and in\r\nsuch a way as to suggest similarity of shape as well as of purpose. We\r\nmay, I think, reasonably suppose that the Curtain was in all essential\r\ndetails a copy of Burbage's Theatre.[114] Presumably, then, it was\r\npolygonal (or circular) in shape,[115] was constructed of timber, and\r\nwas finished on the outside with lime and plaster. The interior, as\r\nthe evidence already cited in the chapter on the Theatre shows,\r\nconsisted of three galleries surrounding an open yard. There was a\r\nplatform projecting into the middle of the yard, with dressing-rooms\r\nat the rear, \"heavens\" overhead, and a flagpole rising above the\r\n\"heavens.\" That some sign was displayed in front of the door is\r\nlikely. Malone writes: \"The original sign hung out at this playhouse\r\n(as Mr. Steevens has observed) was the painting of a curtain\r\nstriped.\"[116] Aubrey records that Ben Jonson \"acted and wrote, but\r\nboth ill, at the Green Curtain, a kind of nursery or obscure playhouse\r\nsomewhere in the suburbs, I think towards Shoreditch or\r\nClerkenwell.\"[117] By \"at the Green Curtain\" Aubrey means, of course,\r\n\"at the sign of the Green Curtain\"; but the evidence of Steevens and\r\nof Aubrey is too vague and uncertain to warrant any definite\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVII, 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: It seems, however, to have been smaller than the\r\nTheatre.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Johannes de Witt describes the Theatre and the Curtain\r\nalong with the Swan and the Rose as \"amphitheatra\" (see page 167). It\r\nis quite possible that Shakespeare refers to the Curtain in the\r\nPrologue to _Henry V_ as \"this wooden O,\" though the reference may be\r\nto the Globe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 54; cf. also Ellis, _The\r\nParish of St. Leonard_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Did Steevens base his statement on this passage in\r\nAubrey?]\r\n\r\nOf the early history of the Curtain we know little, mainly because it\r\nwas not, like certain other playhouses, the subject of extensive\r\nlitigation. We do not even know who planned and built it. The first\r\nevidence of its ownership appears fifteen years after its erection, in\r\nsome legal documents connected with the Theatre.[118] In July, 1592,\r\nHenry Lanman, described as \"of London, gentleman, of the age of 54\r\nyears,\" deposed: \"That true it is about 7 years now shall be this next\r\nwinter, they, the said Burbage and Brayne, having the profits of plays\r\nmade at the Theatre, and this deponent having the profits of the plays\r\ndone at the house called the Curtain near to the same, the said\r\nBurbage and Brayne, taking the Curtain as an esore[119] to their\r\nplayhouse, did of their own motion move this deponent that he would\r\nagree that the profits of the said two playhouses might for seven\r\nyears space be in divident between them.\"[120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Brayne _v._ Burbage, 1592, printed in full by Wallace,\r\n_The First London Theatre_, pp. 109-52. See especially pp. 126, 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Easer?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 148; cf. p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE CURTAIN PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\nFrom _An Actual Survey of the Parish of St Leonard in Shoreditch taken\r\nin the year 1745_ by Peter Chasserau, Surveyor. The key to the map\r\ngives \"93\" as Curtain Court, probably the site of the old playhouse,\r\n\"87\" as New Inn Yard, and \"94\" as Holywell Court, both interesting in\r\nconnection with Burbage's Theatre. (Redrawn from the original for this\r\nvolume.)]\r\n\r\nFrom this statement it is evident that Henry Lanman was the sole\r\nproprietor of the Curtain as far back as 1585, and the presumption is\r\nthat his proprietorship was of still earlier date. This presumption is\r\nstrengthened by the fact that in a sale of the Curtain estate early in\r\n1582, he is specifically mentioned as having a tenure of an \"edifice\r\nor building\" erected in the Curtain Close, that is, that section of\r\nthe estate next to the Field, on which the playhouse was built.[121]\r\nSince Lanman is not mentioned as having any other property on the\r\nestate, the \"edifice or building\" referred to was probably the\r\nplayhouse. The document gives no indication as to how long he had held\r\npossession of the \"edifice,\" but the date of sale, March, 1582,\r\ncarries us back to within four years of the erection of the Curtain,\r\nand it seems reasonable to suppose, though of course we cannot be\r\nsure, that Lanman had been proprietor of the building from the very\r\nbeginning.[122]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Tomlins, _op. cit._, pp. 29-31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Of this Henry Lanman we know nothing beyond the facts\r\nhere revealed. Possibly he was a brother of the distinguished actor\r\nJohn Lanman (the name is variously spelled Lanman, Laneman, Lenmann,\r\nLaneham, Laynman, Lanham), one of the chief members of Leicester's\r\ntroupe, and one of the twelve men selected in 1583 to form the Queen's\r\nMen. But speculation of this sort is vain. It is to be hoped that in\r\nthe future some student will investigate the life of this obscure\r\ntheatrical manager, and trace his connection with the early history of\r\nthe drama.]\r\n\r\nCertain records of the sale of the Curtain estate shortly before and\r\nshortly after the erection of the playhouse are preserved, but these\r\nthrow very little light upon the playhouse itself. We learn that on\r\nFebruary 20, 1567, Lord Mountjoy and his wife sold the estate to\r\nMaurice Longe, clothworker, and his son William Longe, for the sum of\r\n£60; and that on August 23, 1571, Maurice Longe and his wife sold it\r\nto the then Lord Mayor, Sir William Allyn, for the sum of £200. In\r\nboth documents the property is described in the same words: \"All that\r\nhouse, tenement or lodge commonly called the _Curtain_, and all that\r\nparcel of ground and close, walled and enclosed with a brick wall on\r\nthe west and north parts, called also the _Curtain Close_.\" The lodge\r\nhere referred to, generally known as \"Curtain House,\" was on, or very\r\nnear, Holywell Lane;[123] the playhouse, as already stated, was\r\nerected in the close near the Field.[124]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 365.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: The Privy Council on March 10, 1601, refers to it as\r\n\"The Curtaine in Moorefeildes\"; in ancient times, says Stow,\r\nMoorefields extended to Holywell. See Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_,\r\nI, 364.]\r\n\r\nHow long Sir William Allyn held the property, or why it reverted to\r\nthe Longe family, we do not know. But on March 18, 1582, we find\r\nWilliam Longe, the son of \"Maurice Longe, citizen and clothworker, of\r\nLondon, deceased,\" selling the same property, described in the same\r\nwords, to one \"Thomas Harberte, citizen and girdler, of London.\" In\r\nthe meantime, of course, the playhouse had been erected, but no clear\r\nor direct mention of the building is made in the deed of sale.\r\nPossibly it was included in the conventionally worded phrase: \"and all\r\nand singular other messuages, tenements, edifices, and buildings, with\r\nall and singular their appurtenances, erected and builded upon the\r\nsaid close called the Curtain.\"[125] Among the persons named as\r\nholding tenures of the above-mentioned \"edifices and buildings\" in the\r\nclose was Henry Lanman. It seems not improbable, therefore, that the\r\nCurtain, like the Theatre, was erected on leased ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Tomlins, _op. cit._, p. 31.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give a connected history of the Curtain. Most of\r\nthe references to it that we now possess are invectives in early\r\npuritanical writings, or bare mention, along with other playhouses, in\r\nletters or ordinances of the Privy Council and the Lord Mayor. Such\r\nreferences as these do not much help us in determining what companies\r\nsuccessively occupied the building, or what varying fortunes marked\r\nits ownership and management. Yet a few scattered facts have sifted\r\ndown to us, and these I have arranged in chronological order.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of April 6, 1580, an earthquake, especially severe in\r\nHolywell, shook the building during the performance of a play, and\r\ngreatly frightened the audience. Munday says merely: \"at the\r\nplayhouses the people came running forth, surprised with great\r\nastonishment\";[126] but Stubbes, the Puritan, who saw in the event a\r\n\"fearful judgment of God,\" writes with fervor: \"The like judgment\r\nalmost did the Lord show unto them a little before, being assembled at\r\ntheir theatres to see their bawdy interludes and other trumperies\r\npractised, for He caused the earth mightily to shake and quaver, as\r\nthough all would have fallen down; whereat the people, sore amazed,\r\nsome leapt down from the top of the turrets, pinnacles, and towers\r\nwhere they stood, to the ground, whereof some had their legs broke,\r\nsome their arms, some their backs, some hurt one where, some another,\r\nand many score crushed and bruised.\"[127]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _View of Sundry Examples_, 1580.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _The Anatomy of Abuses_, ed. F.J. Furnivall, New\r\nShakspere Society, p. 180. For other descriptions of this earthquake\r\nsee Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 369.]\r\n\r\nThe disturbance at the Theatre and the Curtain in 1584, when one\r\nChalles \"did turn upon the toe upon the belly of\" an apprentice\r\n\"sleeping upon the grass\" in the Field near by, has been mentioned in\r\nthe preceding chapter. If the interpretation of the facts there given\r\nis correct, Lord Arundel's Players were then occupying the Curtain.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1585 Lanman entered into his seven years' agreement\r\nwith Burbage and Brayne by which the Theatre and the Curtain were\r\nplaced under one management, and the profits shared \"in divident\r\nbetween them.\" This agreement was faithfully kept by both parties, but\r\nthere is no evidence that after the expiration of the seven years, in\r\nthe winter of 1592, the affiliation was continued. What effect the\r\narrangement had upon the companies of players occupying the two\r\ntheatres we cannot now determine. To this period, however, I would\r\nassign the appearance of the Queen's Men at the Curtain.[128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Tarlton's Jests_, ed. by J.O. Halliwell for the\r\nShakespeare Society (1844), p. 16. For a discussion see the preceding\r\nchapter on the Theatre, p. 72.]\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1597, as a result of the performance of Thomas Nashe's\r\n_The Isle of Dogs_, by Pembroke's Men at the Swan,[129] the Privy\r\nCouncil ordered the plucking down of \"the Curtain and the\r\nTheatre.\"[130] The order, however, was not carried out, and in October\r\nplays were allowed again as before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: For details see the chapter on the Swan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVII, 313.]\r\n\r\nAt this time the Lord Chamberlain's men were at the Curtain, having\r\nrecently moved thither in consequence of the difficulties Cuthbert\r\nBurbage was having with Gyles Alleyn over the Theatre property. During\r\nthe stay of the Chamberlain's Company, which numbered among its\r\nmembers William Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, William Kempe (who had\r\nsucceeded Tarleton in popular favor as a clown), John Heminges, Thomas\r\nPope, and Augustine Phillips, the playhouse probably attained its\r\ngreatest distinction. Both Shakespeare and Jonson wrote plays for the\r\ntroupe; _Romeo and Juliet_, we are told, \"won Curtain plaudities,\" as\r\nno doubt did many other of Shakespeare's early masterpieces; and\r\nJonson's _Every Man in His Humour_ created such enthusiasm here on its\r\nfirst performance as to make its author famous.[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Marston, _The Scourge of Villainy_ (1598); Bullen, _The\r\nWorks of John Marston_, III, 372.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1599 the Chamberlain's Men moved into their splendid\r\nnew home, the Globe, on the Bankside, and the Curtain thus abandoned\r\nfell on hard times. Perhaps it was let occasionally to traveling\r\ntroupes; in Jeaffreson's _Middlesex County Records_, under the date of\r\nMarch 11, 1600, is a notice of the arrest of one William Haukins\r\n\"charged with a purse taken at a play at the Curtain.\" But shortly\r\nafter, in April, 1600, when Henslowe and Alleyn began to erect their\r\nsplendid new Fortune Playhouse, they were able to give the impression\r\nto Tilney, the Master of the Revels, and to the Privy Council, that\r\nthe Curtain was to be torn down. Thus in the Council's warrant for the\r\nbuilding of the Fortune, dated April 8, 1600, we read that \"another\r\nhouse is [to be] pulled down instead of it\";[132] and when the\r\nPuritans later made vigorous protests against the erection of the\r\nFortune, the Council defended itself by stating that \"their Lordships\r\nhave been informed by Edmund Tilney, Esquire, Her Majesty's servant,\r\nand Master of the Revels, that the house now in hand to be built by\r\nthe said Edward Alleyn is not intended to increase the number of the\r\nplayhouses, but to be instead of another, namely the Curtain, which is\r\neither to be ruined and plucked down, or to be put to some other good\r\nuse.\"[133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 82.]\r\n\r\nAll this talk of the Curtain's being plucked down or devoted to other\r\nuses suggests a contemplated change in the ownership or management of\r\nthe building. We do not know when Lanman died (in 1592 he described\r\nhimself as fifty-four years of age),[134] but we do know that at some\r\ndate prior to 1603 the Curtain had passed into the hands of a\r\nsyndicate. When this syndicate was organized, or who constituted its\r\nmembers, we cannot say. Thomas Pope, in his will, dated July 22, 1603,\r\nmentions his share \"of, in, and to all that playhouse, with the\r\nappurtenances, called the Curtain\";[135] and John Underwood, in his\r\nwill, dated October 4, 1624, mentions his \"part or share ... in the\r\nsaid playhouses called the Blackfriars, the Globe on the Bankside, and\r\nthe Curtain.\"[136] It may be significant that both Pope and Underwood\r\nwere sharers also in the Globe. Since, however, further information\r\nis wanting, it is useless to speculate. We can only say that at some\r\ntime after the period of Lanman's sole proprietorship, the Curtain\r\npassed into the hands of a group of sharers; and that after a\r\ndiscussion in 1600 of demolishing the building or devoting it to other\r\nuses, it entered upon a long and successful career.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: J.P. Collier, _Lives of the Original Actors in\r\nShakespeare's Plays_, p. 127. In exactly the same words Pope disposed\r\nof his share in the Globe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: _Ibid._, p. 230.]\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1601, \"the actors at the Curtain\"[137] gave serious offense\r\nby representing on the stage persons \"of good desert and quality, that\r\nare yet alive, under obscure manner, but yet in such sort as all the\r\nhearers may take notice both of the matter and the persons that are\r\nmeant thereby.\" The Privy Council ordered the Justices of the Peace to\r\nexamine into the case and to punish the offenders.[138]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Possibly Derby's Men.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: See Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXXI, 346.]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1604 a draft of a royal patent for Queen Anne's Players--who\r\nhad hitherto been under the patronage of Worcester[139]--gives those\r\nplayers permission to act \"within their now usual houses, called the\r\nCurtain, and the Boar's Head.\"[140] On April 9, 1604, the Privy\r\nCouncil authorized the three companies of players that had been taken\r\nunder royal patronage \"to exercise their plays in their several and\r\nusual houses for that purpose, and no other, viz., the Globe,\r\nscituate in Maiden Lane on the Bankside in the County of Surrey, the\r\nFortune in Golding Lane, and the Curtain in Holywell.\"[141] The King's\r\nMen (the Burbage-Shakespeare troupe) occupied the Globe; Prince\r\nHenry's Men (the Henslowe-Alleyn troupe), the Fortune; and Queen\r\nAnne's Men, the Curtain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: The company was formed by an amalgamation of Oxford's\r\nand Worcester's Men in 1602.

It\r\nwas small and antiquated, and it must have suffered by comparison with\r\nthe more splendid Globe and Fortune. So the Queen's players had built\r\nfor themselves a new and larger playhouse, called \"The Red Bull.\" This\r\nwas probably ready for occupancy in 1605, yet it is impossible to say\r\nexactly when the Queen's Men left the Curtain; their patent of April\r\n15, 1609, gives them permission to act \"within their now usual houses\r\ncalled the Red Bull, in Clerkenwell, and the Curtain in\r\nHolywell.\"[142] It may be that they retained control of the Curtain in\r\norder to prevent competition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 270.]\r\n\r\nWhat company occupied the Curtain after Queen Anne's Men finally\r\nsurrendered it is not clear. Mr. Murray is of the opinion that Prince\r\nCharles's Men moved into the Curtain \"about December, 1609, or early\r\nin 1610.\"[143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 230.]\r\n\r\nIn 1613 \"a company of young men\" acted _The Hector of Germany_ \"at\r\nthe Red Bull and at the Curtain.\" Such plays, however, written and\r\nacted by amateurs, were not uncommon, and no significance can be\r\nattached to the event.\r\n\r\nIn 1622, as we learn from the Herbert Manuscripts, the Curtain was\r\nbeing occupied by Prince Charles's Servants.[144] In the same year the\r\nauthor of _Vox Graculi, or The Jack Daw's Prognostication for 1623_,\r\nrefers to it thus: \"If company come current to the Bull and Curtain,\r\nthere will be more money gathered in one afternoon than will be given\r\nto Kingsland Spittle in a whole month; also, if at this time about the\r\nhours of four and five it wax cloudy and then rain downright, they\r\nshall sit dryer in the galleries than those who are the understanding\r\nmen in the yard.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 59; cf. Chalmers's\r\n_Supplemental Apology_, p. 213, note _y_. Murray gives the date\r\nincorrectly as 1623.]\r\n\r\nPrince Charles's Men did not remain long at the Curtain. At some date\r\nbetween June 10 and August 19, 1623, they moved to the larger and more\r\nhandsome Red Bull.[145] After this, so far as I can discover, there is\r\nno evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic performances.\r\nMalone, who presumably bases his statements on the now lost records of\r\nHerbert, says that shortly after the accession of King Charles I it\r\n\"seems to have been used only by prize-fighters.\"[146]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 237, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 54, note 2.]\r\n\r\nThe last mention of the Curtain is found in the _Middlesex County\r\nRecords_ under the date February 21, 1627.[147] It is merely a passing\r\nreference to \"the common shoare near the Curtain playhouse,\" yet it is\r\nsignificant as indicating that the building was then still standing.\r\nWhat ultimately became of it we do not know. For a time, however, its\r\nmemory survived in Curtain Court (see page 79), and to-day its fame is\r\nperpetuated in Curtain Road.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: See Jeaffreson, _Middlesex County Records_, III, 164,\r\nfrom which the notice was quoted by Ordish, _Early London Theatres_,\r\np. 106.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BLACKFRIARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe choir boys of the Chapel Royal, of Windsor, and of Paul's were all\r\nengaged in presenting dramatic entertainments before Queen Elizabeth.\r\nEach organization expected to be called upon one or more times a\r\nyear--at Christmas, New Year's, and other like occasions--to furnish\r\nrecreation to Her Majesty; and in return for its efforts each received\r\na liberal \"reward\" in money. Richard Farrant, Master of the Windsor\r\nChapel, was especially active in devising plays for the Queen's\r\nentertainment. But having a large family, he was poor in spite of his\r\nregular salary and the occasional \"rewards\" he received for the\r\nperformances of his Boys at Court; and doubtless he often cast about\r\nin his mind for some way in which to increase his meagre income.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1576 James Burbage, having conceived the idea of a\r\nbuilding devoted solely to plays, had leased a plot of ground for the\r\npurpose, and had begun the erection of the Theatre. By the autumn, no\r\ndoubt, the building was nearing completion, if, indeed, it was not\r\nactually open to the public; and the experiment, we may suppose, was\r\nexciting much interest in the dramatic circles of London. It seems to\r\nhave set Farrant to thinking. The professional actors, he observed,\r\nhad one important advantage over the child actors: not only could they\r\npresent their plays before the Queen and receive the usual court\r\nreward, but in addition they could present their plays before the\r\npublic and thus reap a second and richer harvest. Since the child\r\nactors had, as a rule, more excellent plays than the professional\r\ntroupes, and were better equipped with properties and costumes, and\r\nsince they expended just as much energy in devising plays and in\r\nmemorizing and rehearsing their parts, Farrant saw no reason why they,\r\ntoo, should not be allowed to perform before the public. This, he\r\nthought, might be done under the guise of rehearsals for the Court.\r\nPossibly the Queen might even wink at regular performances before the\r\ngeneral public when she understood that this would train the Boys to\r\nbe more skilful actors, would provide Her Majesty with more numerous\r\nand possibly more excellent plays, and would enable the Master and his\r\nassistants to live in greater comfort without affecting the royal\r\npurse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACKFRIARS MONASTERY\r\n\r\nA plan of the various buildings as they appeared before the\r\ndissolution, based on the Loseley Manuscripts and other documents,\r\nsurveys, and maps. The Buttery became Farrant's, the Frater Burbage's\r\nplayhouse. (Drawn by the author.)]\r\n\r\nFor Farrant to build a playhouse specifically for the use of the\r\nChildren was out of the question. In the first place, it would be too\r\nconspicuously a capitalization of the royal choristers for private\r\ngain; and in the second place, it would be far too hazardous a\r\nbusiness venture for so poor a man as he to undertake. The more\r\nsensible thing for him to do was to rent somewhere a large hall which\r\ncould at small expense be converted into a place suitable for training\r\nthe Children in their plays, and for the entertainment of\r\nselect--possibly at first invited--audiences. The performances, of\r\ncourse, were not to be heralded by a trumpet-and-drum procession\r\nthrough the street, by the flying of a flag, and by such-like vulgar\r\nadvertising as of a public show; instead, they were to be quiet,\r\npresumably \"private,\" and were to attract only noblemen and those\r\ncitizens of the better class who were interested in the drama.[148]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: From this notion of privacy, I take it, arose the term\r\n\"private\" theatre as distinguished from \"common\" or \"public\" theatre.\r\nThe interpretation of the term suggested by Mr. W.J. Lawrence, and\r\napproved by Mr. William Archer, namely, that it was a legal device to\r\nescape the city ordinance of 1574, cannot be accepted. The city had no\r\njurisdiction over the precinct of Blackfriars, nor did Farrant live in\r\nthe building.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITES OF THE TWO BLACKFRIARS PLAYHOUSES\r\n\r\nThe smaller rectangle at the north represents the Buttery, later\r\nFarrant's playhouse, the larger rectangle represents the Frater, later\r\nBurbage's playhouse. (From Ogilby and Morgan's _Map of London_, 1677,\r\nthe sites marked by the author.)]\r\n\r\nSuch was Farrant's scheme. In searching for a hall suitable for his\r\npurpose, his mind at once turned to the precinct of Blackfriars, where\r\nin former years the Office of the Revels had been kept, and where the\r\nChildren had often rehearsed their plays. The precinct had once, as\r\nthe name indicates, been in the possession of the Dominican or \"Black\"\r\nFriars. The Priory buildings had consisted chiefly of a great church\r\ntwo hundred and twenty feet long and sixty-six feet broad, with a\r\ncloister on the south side of the church forming a square of one\r\nhundred and ten feet, and a smaller cloister to the south of this. At\r\nthe dissolution of the religious orders, the property had passed into\r\nthe possession of the Crown; hence, though within the city walls, it\r\nwas not under the jurisdiction of the city authorities. Farrant\r\nprobably did not anticipate any interference on the part of the Common\r\nCouncil with the royal choristers \"practicing\" their plays in order\r\n\"to yield Her Majesty recreation and delight,\" yet the absolute\r\ncertainty of being free from the adverse legislation of the London\r\nauthorities was not to be ignored. Moreover, the precinct was now the\r\nhome of many noblemen and wealthy gentlemen, and Farrant probably\r\nthought that, as one of the most fashionable residential districts in\r\nLondon, it was suitable for \"private\" performances to be given by\r\nmembers of Her Majesty's household.\r\n\r\nIn furthering his project he sought the counsel and aid of his \"very\r\nfriend\" Sir Henry Neville, Lieutenant of Windsor, who, it is to be\r\npresumed, was interested in the Windsor Boys. It happened that Neville\r\nknew of exactly such rooms as were desired, rooms in the old monastery\r\nof Blackfriars which he himself had once leased as a residence, and\r\nwhich, he heard, were \"to be let either presently, or very shortly.\"\r\nThese rooms were in the southwestern corner of the monastery, on the\r\nupper floor of two adjoining buildings formerly used by the monks as a\r\nbuttery and a frater. A history of the rooms up to the time of their\r\nuse as a theatre may be briefly sketched.\r\n\r\nIn 1548 the buttery and frater, with certain other buildings, were let\r\nby King Edward to Sir Thomas Cawarden, Master of the Revels; and in\r\n1550 they were granted to him outright. In 1554 Cawarden sold the\r\nnorthern section of the buttery, fifty-two feet in length, to Lord\r\nCobham, whose mansion it adjoined. The rest of the buttery, forty-six\r\nfeet in length, and the frater, he converted into lodgings. Since the\r\nfrater was of exceptional breadth--fifty-two feet on the outside,\r\nforty-six feet on the inside--he ran a partition through its length,\r\ndividing it into two parts. The section of the frater on the west of\r\nthis partition he let to Sir Richard Frith; the section on the east,\r\nwith the remainder of the buttery not sold to Lord Cobham, he let to\r\nSir John Cheeke. It is with the Cheeke Lodgings that we are especially\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAbout September, 1554, Cheeke went to travel abroad, and surrendered\r\nhis rooms in the Blackfriars. Sir Thomas Cawarden thereupon made use\r\nof them \"for the Office of the Queen's Majesty's Revells\"; thus for a\r\ntime the Cheeke Lodgings were intimately connected with dramatic\r\nactivities. But at the death of Cawarden, in 1559, the Queen\r\ntransferred the Office of the Revels to St. John's, and the\r\nBlackfriars property belonging to Cawarden passed into the possession\r\nof Sir William More.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF FARRANT'S PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\nFrith's Lodging and the four southern rooms of Farrant's Lodging were\r\non the upper floor of the Frater; the two northern rooms of Farrant's\r\nLodging were on the upper floor of the Buttery. The playhouse was\r\nerected in the two rooms last mentioned.]\r\n\r\nIn 1560 the new proprietor let the Cheeke Lodgings to Sir Henry\r\nNeville, with the addition of \"a void piece of ground\" eighteen feet\r\nwide extending west to Water Lane.[149] During his tenancy Neville\r\nerected certain partitions, built a kitchen in the \"void piece of\r\nground,\" and a large stairway leading to the rooms overhead. In 1568\r\nhe surrendered his lease, and More let the rooms first to some \"sylk\r\ndyers,\" and then in 1571 to Lord Cobham. In 1576 Cobham gave up the\r\nrooms, and More was seeking a tenant. It was at this auspicious moment\r\nthat Farrant planned a private theatre, and enlisted the aid of Sir\r\nHenry Neville.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: This was enclosed with brick walls, and the greater\r\npart used as a wood-yard. This yard was later purchased by James\r\nBurbage when he secured the frater for his playhouse. The kitchen,\r\nshed, and stairs, built on the eastern part, were sold to Cobham.]\r\n\r\nOn August 27 Farrant and Neville separately wrote letters to Sir\r\nWilliam More about the matter. Farrant respectfully solicited the\r\nlease, and made the significant request that he might \"pull down one\r\npartition, and so make two rooms--one.\" Neville, in a friendly letter\r\nbeginning with \"hearty commendations unto you and to Mrs. More,\" and\r\nending with light gossip, urged Sir William to let the rooms to\r\nFarrant, and recommended Farrant as a desirable tenant (\"I dare answer\r\nfor him\"). Neither letter mentioned the purpose for which the rooms,\r\nespecially the large room referred to by Farrant, were to be used; but\r\nMore doubtless understood that the Windsor Children were to practice\r\ntheir plays there, with occasional private rehearsals. Largely as a\r\nresult of Neville's recommendation, More decided to let the rooms to\r\nFarrant. The progress of the negotiations is marked by a letter from\r\nFarrant to More, dated September 17, 1576, requesting that there be\r\ngranted him also a certain \"little dark room,\" which he found would be\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThe lease as finally signed describes the property thus:\r\n\r\n     Sir William More hath demised, granted, and to ferm letten,\r\n     and by these presents doth demise, grant, and to ferm let\r\n     unto the said Richard Farrant all those his six upper\r\n     chambers, lofts, lodgings, or rooms, lying together within\r\n     the precinct of the late dissolved house or priory of the\r\n     Blackfriars, otherwise called the friars preachers, in\r\n     London; which said six upper chambers, lofts, lodgings, or\r\n     rooms, were lately, amongst others, in the tenure and\r\n     occupation of the right honourable Sir William Brooke,\r\n     Knight, Lord Cobham; and do contain in length from the north\r\n     end thereof to the south end of the same one hundred fifty\r\n     and six foot and a half of assize; whereof two of the said\r\n     six upper chambers, lofts, lodgings, or rooms in the north\r\n     end of the premises, together with the breadth of the little\r\n     room under granted, do contain in length forty[150] and six\r\n     foot and a half, and from the east to the west part thereof\r\n     in breadth twenty and five foot of assize;[151] and the\r\n     four other chambers, or rooms, residue of the said six upper\r\n     chambers, do contain in length one hundred and ten foot, and\r\n     in breadth from the east to the west part thereof twenty-two\r\n     foot of assize.... And also ... the great stairs lately\r\n     erected and made by the said Sir Henry Neville upon part of\r\n     the said void ground and way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: By an error in the manuscript this reads \"fifty\"; but\r\nthe rooms are often described and always as \"forty-six\" feet in\r\nlength; moreover, the error is made obvious by the rest of the lease.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: The breadth is elsewhere given as twenty-six, and\r\ntwenty-seven feet.]\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the lease should run for twenty-one years, and that\r\nthe rental should be £14 per annum. But Sir William More, being a most\r\ncareful and exacting landlord, with the interest of his adjacent\r\nlodgings to care for, inserted in the lease the following important\r\nproviso, which was destined to make trouble, and ultimately to wreck\r\nthe theatre:\r\n\r\n     Provided also that the said Richard Farrant, his executors\r\n     or assigns, or any of them, shall not in any wise demise,\r\n     let, grant, assign, set over, or by any ways or means put\r\n     away his or their interest or term of years, or any part of\r\n     the same years, of or in the said premises before letten, or\r\n     any part, parcel, or member thereof to any person, or\r\n     persons, at any time hereafter during this present lease and\r\n     term of twenty-one years, without the special license,\r\n     consent, and agreement of the said Sir William More, his\r\n     heirs and assigns, first had, and obtained in writing under\r\n     his and their hands and seals.\r\n\r\nThe penalty affixed to a violation of this provision was the immediate\r\nforfeiture of the lease.\r\n\r\nApparently Farrant entered into possession of the rooms on September\r\n29[152] (although the formal lease was not signed until December 20),\r\nand we may suppose that he at once set about converting the two upper\r\nrooms at the north end of the lodgings into a suitable theatre.[153]\r\nNaturally he took for his model the halls at Court in which the\r\nChildren had been accustomed to act. First, we are told, he \"pulled\r\ndown partitions to make that place apt for that purpose\"; next, he\r\n\"spoiled\" the windows--by which is meant, no doubt, that he stopped up\r\nthe windows, for the performances were to be by candle-light. At one\r\nend of the hall he erected a platform to serve as a stage, and in the\r\nauditorium he placed benches or chairs. There was, presumably, no room\r\nfor a gallery; if such had been erected, the indignant More would\r\ncertainly have mentioned it in his bill of complaints.[154]\r\nChandeliers over the stage, and, possibly, footlights, completed the\r\nnecessary arrangements. For these alterations Farrant, we are told,\r\nbecame \"greatly indebted,\" and he died three or four years later with\r\nthe debt still unpaid. More complained that the alterations had put\r\nthe rooms into a state of \"great ruin,\" which meant, of course, from\r\nthe point of view of a landlord desiring to let them again for\r\nresidential purposes. Just how costly or how extensive the alterations\r\nwere we cannot now determine; but we may reasonably conclude that\r\nFarrant made the hall not only \"commodious for his purpose,\" but also\r\nattractive to the aristocratic audiences he intended to gather there\r\nto see his plays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: The date from which the lease was made to run.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: It is usually said that he converted the entire seven\r\nrooms into his theatre, but that seems highly unlikely. The northern\r\nsection was 46 x 26 feet, the southern section 110 x 22--absurd\r\ndimensions for an auditorium. Moreover, that Farrant originally\r\nplanned to use only the northern section is indicated by his request\r\nto be allowed to \"pull down one partition and so make two rooms--one.\"\r\nThe portion not used for the playhouse he rented; in 1580, we are\r\ntold, he let \"two parcels thereof to two several persons.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: M. Feuillerat, I think, is wrong in supposing that\r\nthere was a gallery. He deduces no proof for his contention, and the\r\nevidence is against him.]\r\n\r\nTo reach the hall, playgoers had to come first into Water Lane, thence\r\nthrough \"a way leading from the said way called Water Lane\" to \"a\r\ncertain void ground\" before the building. Here \"upon part of the said\r\nvoid ground\" they found a \"great stairs, which said great stairs do\r\nserve and lead into\" the upper rooms--or, as we may now say,\r\nBlackfriars Playhouse.[155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: There must have been two stairways leading to the upper\r\nrooms; I have assumed that playgoers used Neville's stairs to reach\r\nthe theatre.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided a playhouse, Farrant next provided an adequate\r\ncompany of boy actors. To do this, he combined the Children of Windsor\r\nwith the Children of the Chapel Royal, of which William Hunnis was\r\nmaster. What arrangement he made with Hunnis we do not know, but the\r\nCourt records show that Farrant was regarded as the manager of the new\r\norganization; he is actually referred to in the payments as \"Master of\r\nthe Children of Her Majesty's Chapel,\" and Hunnis's official\r\nconnection with the Children is ignored.\r\n\r\nFarrant may have been able to open his playhouse before the close of\r\nthe year; or he may have first begun performances there in the early\r\nmonths of 1577. He would certainly be anxious to make use of the new\r\nplay he was preparing for presentation at Court on Twelfth Day,\r\nJanuary 6, 1577.\r\n\r\nFor four years, 1576-1580, the playhouse was operated without trouble.\r\nSir William More, however, was not pleased at the success with which\r\nthe actors were meeting. He asserted that when he made the lease he\r\nwas given to understand that the building was to be used \"only for the\r\nteaching of the Children of the Chapel\"--with, no doubt, a few\r\nrehearsals to which certain persons would be _privately_ invited. But,\r\nnow, to his grief, he discovered that Farrant had \"made it a continual\r\nhouse for plays.\" He asserted that the playhouse had become offensive\r\nto the precinct; and doubtless some complaints had been made to him,\r\nas landlord, by the more aristocratic inhabitants.[156] At any rate,\r\nhe became anxious to regain possession of the building.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: I suspect that the theatre gave greater offense to More\r\nhimself than it did to any one else, for it adjoined his home, and the\r\naudience made use of the private passage which led from Water Lane to\r\nhis mansion. Unquestionably he suffered worse than any one else both\r\nfrom the noise and the crowds.]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1580 he saw an opportunity to break the lease and\r\nclose the playhouse. Farrant made the mistake of letting \"two parcels\r\nthereof to two severall persons\" without first gaining the written\r\nconsent of More, and at once More \"charged him with forfeiture of his\r\nlease.\" But before More could \"take remedy against him\" Farrant died,\r\nNovember 30, 1580. More, however, \"entered upon the house, and refused\r\nto receive any rent but conditionally.\"\r\n\r\nBy his will, proved March 1, 1581, Farrant left the lease of the\r\nBlackfriars to his widow, Anne Farrant. But she had no authority over\r\nthe royal choristers, nor was she qualified to manage a company of\r\nactors, even if she had had the time to do so after caring for her\r\n\"ten little ones.\" What use, if any, was made of the playhouse during\r\nthe succeeding winter we do not know. The widow writes that she,\r\n\"being a sole woman, unable of herself to use the said rooms to such\r\npurpose as her said husband late used them, nor having any need or\r\noccasion to occupy them to such commodity as would discharge the rents\r\ndue for the said rooms in the bill alledged, nor being able to\r\nsustain, repair, and amend the said rooms,\" etc.;[157] the natural\r\ninference from which is that for a time the playhouse stood unused.\r\nThe widow, of course, was anxious to sublet the building to some one\r\nwho could make use of it as a playhouse; and on December 25, 1580, she\r\naddressed a letter to Sir William More asking his written permission\r\nto make such a disposal of the lease. The letter has a pathetic\r\ninterest that justifies its insertion here:\r\n\r\n     _To the right worshipful Sir William More, Knight, at his\r\n     house near Guilford, give these with speed._\r\n\r\n     _Right worshipful Sir:_\r\n\r\n     After my humble commendations, and my duty also\r\n     remembered--where it hath pleased your worship to grant unto\r\n     my husband in his life time one lease of your house within\r\n     the Blackfriars, for the term of twenty-one years, with a\r\n     proviso in the end thereof that he cannot neither let nor\r\n     set the same without your worship's consent under your hand\r\n     in writing. And now for that it hath pleased God to call my\r\n     said husband unto His mercy, having left behind him the\r\n     charge of ten small children upon my hand, and my husband\r\n     besides greatly indebted, not having the revenue of one\r\n     groat any way coming in, but by making the best I may of\r\n     such things as he hath left behind him, to relieve my little\r\n     ones. May it therefore please your worship, of your abundant\r\n     clemency and accustomed goodness, to consider a poor widow's\r\n     distressed estate, and for God's cause to comfort her with\r\n     your worship's warrant under your hand to let and set the\r\n     same to my best comodity during the term of years in the\r\n     said lease contained, not doing any waste. In all which\r\n     doing, I shall evermore most abundantly pray unto God for\r\n     the preservation of your worship's long continuance. From\r\n     Grenwich, the twenty-fifth of December,\r\n\r\n     By a poor and sorrowful widow,\r\n\r\n     ANNE FARRANT.[158]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: Wallace, _The Evolution of the English Drama_, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Wallace, _The Evolution of the English Drama_, p.\r\n153.]\r\n\r\nWhether she secured in writing the permission she requested we do not\r\nknow. Four years later More said that she did not. Possibly, however,\r\nshe was orally given to understand that she might transfer the lease\r\nto her husband's former partner in the enterprise, William\r\nHunnis.[159] Hunnis naturally was eager to make use of the building in\r\npreparation for the Christmas plays at Court. At some date before\r\nSeptember 19, he secured the use of the playhouse on a temporary\r\nagreement with the widow; but in order to avoid any difficulty with\r\nMore, he interviewed the latter, and presented a letter of\r\nrecommendation from the Earl of Leicester. This letter has been\r\npreserved among Sir William's papers:\r\n\r\n     _Sir William More:_\r\n\r\n     Whereas my friend, Mr. Hunnis, this bearer, informeth me\r\n     that he hath of late bought of Farrant's widow her lease of\r\n     that house in Blackfriars which you made to her husband,\r\n     deceased, and means there to practice the Queen's Children\r\n     of the Chapel, being now in his charge, in like sort as his\r\n     predecessor did, for the better training them to do Her\r\n     Majesty's service; he is now a suitor to me to recommend him\r\n     to your good favour--which I do very heartily, as one that I\r\n     wish right well unto, and will give you thanks for any\r\n     continuance or friendship you shall show him for the\r\n     furtherance of this his honest request. And thus, with my\r\n     hearty commendations, I wish you right heartily well to\r\n     fare. From the Court, this nineteenth of September, 1581.\r\n\r\n     Your very friend,\r\n\r\n     R. LEICESTER.[160]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: More had \"refused to accept any rent but\r\nconditionally.\" Probably he refused written consent to the sublease\r\nfor the same reason.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Wallace, _The Evolution of the English Drama_, p. 154.]\r\n\r\nThe result of this interview we do not know. But on December 20\r\nfollowing, the widow made a formal lease of the property to William\r\nHunnis and John Newman, at a rental of £20 13_s._ 4_d._ a year, an\r\nincrease of £6 13_s._ 4_d._ over the rental she had to pay More. She\r\nrequired of them a bond of £100 to guarantee their performance of all\r\nthe covenants of the lease. Thereupon the theatre under Hunnis and\r\nNewman resumed its career--if, indeed, this had ever been seriously\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, More's anxiety to recover possession of the\r\nhall seems to have increased. The quarterly payments were not promptly\r\nmet by the widow, and the repairs on the building were not made to his\r\nsatisfaction. Probably through fear of the increasing dissatisfaction\r\non the part of More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their lease, in\r\n1583, to a young Welsh scrivener, Henry Evans, who had become\r\ninterested in dramatic affairs. This transfer of the lease without\r\nMore's written consent was a second clear breach of the original\r\ncontract, and it gave More exactly the opportunity he sought.\r\nAccordingly, he declared the original lease to Farrant void, and made\r\na new lease of the house \"unto his own man, Thomas Smallpiece, to try\r\nthe said Evans his right.\" But Evans, being a lawyer, knew how to take\r\ncare of himself. He \"demurred in law,\" and \"kept the same in his hands\r\nwith long delays.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow, alarmed at the prospect of losing her lease, brought suit,\r\nin December, 1583, against Hunnis and Newman separately for the\r\nforfeiture of their several bonds of £100, contending that they had\r\nnot paid promptly according to their agreement, and had not kept the\r\nbuilding in proper repair. Hunnis and Newman separately brought suit\r\nin the Court of Requests for relief against the widow's suits.\r\nMeanwhile More was demanding judgment against Evans. Hunnis, it seems,\r\ncarried his troubles to the Court and there sought help. Queen\r\nElizabeth could take no direct action, because Sir William More was a\r\ngood friend of hers, who had entertained her in his home. But she\r\nmight enlist the aid of one of her noblemen who were interested in the\r\ndrama. However this was, the young Earl of Oxford, himself a\r\nplaywright and the patron of a troupe of boy-actors, came to the\r\nrescue of the theatre. He bought the lease of the building from Evans,\r\nand undertook to reorganize its affairs. To Hunnis's twelve Children\r\nof the Chapel he added the Children of St. Paul's Cathedral, making\r\nthus a company of adequate size. He retained Hunnis, no doubt, as one\r\nof the trainers of the Boys, and he kept Evans as manager of the\r\ntroupe. Moreover, shortly after the purchase, probably in June, 1583,\r\nhe made a free gift of the lease to his private secretary, John Lyly,\r\na young man who had recently won fame with the first English novel,\r\n_Euphues_. The object of this, like the preceding transfers of title,\r\nit seems, was to put as many legal blocks in the path of Sir William\r\nMore as possible. More realized this, and complained specifically that\r\n\"the title was posted from one to another\"; yet he had firmly made up\r\nhis mind to recover the property, and in spite of Oxford's\r\ninterference, he instructed his \"learned council\" to \"demand\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the dramatic organization at Blackfriars continued under the\r\ndirection of Hunnis, Evans, and Lyly, with the Earl of Oxford as\r\npatron. Not only was Lyly the proprietor of the theatre, but he\r\nattempted to supply it with the necessary plays. He had already shown\r\nhis power to tell in effective prose a pleasing love romance. That\r\npower he now turned to the production of his first play, written in\r\nhaste for the Christmas festivities. The play, _Alexander and\r\nCampaspe_, was presented before Her Majesty on January 1, 1584, and at\r\nBlackfriars, with great applause. Lyly's second play, _Sapho and\r\nPhao_, was produced at Court on March 3, following, and also at\r\nBlackfriars before the general public.\r\n\r\nBut at the Easter term, 1584, Sir William More got judgment in his\r\nfavor. The widow begged Sir Francis Walsingham to intercede in her\r\nbehalf, declaring that the loss of the lease \"might be her utter\r\nundoing.\"[161] Walsingham sent the letter to More, and apparently\r\nurged a consideration of her case. More, however, refused to yield. He\r\nbanished Lyly, Hunnis, Evans, and the Children from the \"great upper\r\nhall,\" and reconverted the building into tenements.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: The letter is printed in full by Mr. Wallace in _The\r\nEvolution of the English Drama_, p. 158. Mr. Wallace, however,\r\nmisdates it. It was not written until after More had \"recovered it\r\n[the lease] against Evans.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nST. PAUL'S\r\n\r\n\r\nAs shown in the preceding chapter, not only were the Children of the\r\nChapel Royal and of Windsor called upon to entertain the Queen with\r\ndramatic performances, but the Children of St. Paul's were also\r\nexpected to amuse their sovereign on occasion. And following the\r\nexample of the Children of the Chapel and of Windsor in giving\r\nperformances before the public in Blackfriars, the Paul's Boys soon\r\nbegan to give such performances in a building near the Cathedral.[162]\r\nThe building so employed was doubtless one of the structures owned by\r\nthe Church. Burbage and Heminges refer to it as \"the said house near\r\nSt. Paul's Church.\"[163] Richard Flecknoe, in _A Discourse of the\r\nEnglish Stage_ (1664), places it \"behind the Convocation-house in\r\nPaul's\";[164] and Howes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_\r\n(1631), says that it was the \"singing-school\" of the Cathedral.[165]\r\nThat the auditorium was small we may well believe. So was the stage.\r\nCertain speakers in the Induction to _What You Will_, acted at Paul's\r\nin 1600, say: \"Let's place ourselves within the curtains, for, good\r\nfaith, the stage is so very little, we shall wrong the general eye\r\nelse very much.\" Both Fleay and Lawrence[166] contend that the\r\nbuilding was \"round, like the Globe,\" and as evidence they cite the\r\nPrologue to Marston's _Antonio's Revenge_, acted at Paul's in 1600, in\r\nwhich the phrases \"within this round\" and \"within this ring\" are\r\napplied to the theatre. The phrases, however, may have reference\r\nmerely to the circular disposition of the benches about the stage.\r\nThat high prices of admission to the little theatre were charged we\r\nlearn from a marginal note in _Pappe with an Hatchet_ (1589), which\r\nstates that if a tragedy \"be showed at Paul's, it will cost you four\r\npence; at the Theatre two pence.\"[167] The Children, indeed, catered\r\nto a very select public. Persons who went thither were gentle by birth\r\nand by behavior as well; and playwrights, we are told, could always\r\nfeel sure there of the \"calm attention of a choice audience.\"[168]\r\nLyly, in the Prologue to _Midas_, acted at Paul's in 1589, says: \"Only\r\nthis doth encourage us, that presenting our studies before\r\n_Gentlemen_, though they receive an inward dislike, we shall not be\r\nhissed with an open disgrace.\" Things were quite otherwise in the\r\npublic theatres of Shoreditch and the Bankside.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 325,\r\nerroneously says: \"Their public place was, probably, from the first,\r\nthe courtyard of St. Paul's Cathedral.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: That is, in or near Pater Noster Row.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: _Annales, or A Generall Chronicle of England_, 1631,\r\nsignature liii 1, verso.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: F.G. Fleay, _A Biographical Chronicle of the English\r\nDrama_, II, 76; W.J. Lawrence, _The Elizabethan Playhouse_, p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: R.W. Bond, _The Complete Works of John Lyly_, III, 408.\r\nHigher prices of admission were charged to all the private\r\nplayhouses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: John Marston, _Antonio's Revenge_, acted at Paul's in\r\n1600.]\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of their master, Sebastian Westcott, the Boys\r\nacted before the public at least as early as 1578,[169] for in\r\nDecember of that year the Privy Council ordered the Lord Mayor to\r\npermit them to \"exercise plays\" within the city;[170] and Stephen\r\nGosson, in his _Plays Confuted_, written soon afterwards, mentions\r\n_Cupid and Psyche_ as having been recently \"plaid at Paules.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: There is a record of a play by the Paul's Boys in 1527\r\nbefore ambassadors from France, dealing with the heretic Luther; but\r\nexactly when they began to give public performances for money we do\r\nnot know.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 432.]\r\n\r\nWestcott died in 1582, and was succeeded by Thomas Gyles. Shortly\r\nafter this we find the Children of Paul's acting publicly with the\r\nChildren of the Chapel Royal at the little theatre in Blackfriars. For\r\nthem John Lyly wrote his two earliest plays, _Campaspe_ and _Sapho and\r\nPhao_, as the title-pages clearly state. But their stay at Blackfriars\r\nwas short. When in 1584 Sir William More closed up the theatre there,\r\nthey fell back upon their singing-school as the place for their public\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Queen became greatly interested in promoting\r\ntheir dramatic activities. To their master, Thomas Gyles, she issued,\r\nin April, 1585, a special commission \"to take up apt and meet\r\nchildren\" wherever he could find them. It was customary for the Queen\r\nto issue such a commission to the masters of her two private chapels,\r\nbut never before, or afterwards, had this power to impress children\r\nbeen conferred upon a person not directly connected with the royal\r\nchoristers. Its issuance to Gyles in 1585 clearly indicates the\r\nQueen's interest in the Paul's Boys as actors, and her expectation of\r\nbeing frequently entertained by them. And to promote her plans still\r\nfurther, she appointed the successful playwright John Lyly as their\r\nvice-master, with the understanding, no doubt, that he was to keep\r\nthem--and her--supplied with plays. This he did, for all his comedies,\r\nexcept the two just mentioned, were written for the Cathedral\r\nChildren, and were acted by them at Court, and in their little theatre\r\n\"behind the Convocation House.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately under Lyly's leadership the Boys became involved in the\r\nbitter Martin Marprelate controversy, for which they were suppressed\r\nnear the end of 1590. The printer of Lyly's _Endimion_, in 1591, says\r\nto the reader: \"Since the plays in Paul's were dissolved, there are\r\ncertain comedies come to my hands by chance, which were presented\r\nbefore Her Majesty at several times by the Children of Paul's.\"\r\n\r\nExactly how long the Children were restrained it is hard to determine.\r\nIn 1596 Thomas Nash, in _Have With You to Saffron Walden_, expressed\r\na desire to see \"the plays at Paul's up again.\" Mr. Wallace thinks\r\nthey may have been allowed \"up again\" in 1598;[171] Fleay, in 1599 or\r\n1600;[172] the evidence, however, points, I think, to the spring or\r\nearly summer of 1600. The Children began, naturally, with old plays,\r\n\"musty fopperies of antiquity\"; the first, or one of the first, new\r\nplays they presented was Marston's _Jack Drum's Entertainment_, the\r\ndate of which can be determined within narrow limits. References to\r\nKempe's Morris, which was danced in February, 1600, as being still a\r\ncommon topic of conversation, and the entry of the play in the\r\nStationers' Registers on September 8, 1600, point to the spring or\r\nearly summer of 1600 as the date of composition. This makes very\r\nsignificant the following passage in the play referring to the Paul's\r\nBoys as just beginning to act again after their long inhibition:\r\n\r\n     _Sir Ed._ I saw the Children of Paul's last night,\r\n     And troth they pleas'd me pretty, pretty well.\r\n     The Apes in time will do it handsomely.\r\n\r\n     _Plan._ S'faith, I like the audience that frequenteth there\r\n     With much applause. A man shall not be choak't\r\n     With the stench of garlic, nor be pasted\r\n     To the barmy jacket of a beer-brewer.\r\n\r\n     _Bra. Ju._ 'Tis a good, gentle audience; and I hope the Boys\r\n     Will come one day into the Court of Requests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: _The Children of the Chapel_, p. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _A Chronicle History of the London Stage_, p. 152.]\r\n\r\nShortly after this the Boys were indeed called \"into the Court of\r\nRequests,\" for on New Year's Day, 1601, they were summoned to present\r\na play before Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nTheir master now was Edward Pierce, who had succeeded Thomas Gyles. In\r\n1605 the experienced Edward Kirkham, driven from the management of the\r\nBlackfriars Theatre, became an assistant to Pierce in the management\r\nof Paul's. In this capacity we find him in 1606 receiving the payment\r\nfor the two performances of the Boys at Court that year.[173]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Cunningham, _Extracts from the Accounts of the Revels_,\r\np. XXXVIII.]\r\n\r\nAmong the playwrights engaged by Pierce to write for Paul's were\r\nMarston, Middleton, Chapman, Dekker, Webster, and Beaumont; and, as a\r\nresult, some of the most interesting dramas of the period were first\r\nacted on the small stage of the singing-school. Details in the history\r\nof the Children, however, are few. We find an occasional notice of\r\ntheir appearance at Court, but our record of them is mainly secured\r\nfrom the title-pages of their plays.\r\n\r\nThe last notice of a performance by them is as follows: \"On the 30th\r\nof July, 1606, the youths of Paul's, commonly called the Children of\r\nPaul's, played before the two Kings [of England and of Denmark] a play\r\ncalled _Abuses_, containing both a comedy and a tragedy, at which the\r\nKings seemed to take great delight and be much pleased.\"[174]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Nichols, _The Progresses of James_, IV, 1073.]\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Children ceased to act is made clear in the lawsuit\r\nof Keysar _v._ Burbage _et al._, recently discovered and printed by\r\nMr. Wallace.[175] From this we learn that when Rosseter became manager\r\nof the Children of the Queen's Revels at the private playhouse of\r\nWhitefriars in 1609, he undertook to increase his profits by securing\r\na monopoly both of child-acting and of private theatres. Blackfriars\r\nhad been deserted, and the only other private theatre then in\r\nexistence was Paul's. So Rosseter agreed to pay Pierce a dead rent of\r\n£20 a year to keep the Paul's playhouse closed:\r\n\r\n     One Mr. Rosseter, a partner of the said complainant, dealt\r\n     for and compounded with the said Mr. Pierce to the only\r\n     benefit of him, the said Mr. Rosseter, the now complainant,\r\n     the rest of their partners and Company [at the Whitefriars]\r\n     ... that thereby they might ... advance their gains and\r\n     profit to be had and made in their said house in the\r\n     Whitefriars, that there might be a cessation of playing and\r\n     plays to be acted in the said house near St. Paul's Church\r\n     aforesaid, for which the said Rosseter compounded with the\r\n     said Pierce to give him the said Pierce twenty pounds per\r\n     annum.[176]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _Ibid._, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nIn this attempt to secure a monopoly in private playhouses Rosseter\r\nwas foiled by the coming of Shakespeare's troupe to the Blackfriars;\r\nbut the King's Men readily agreed to join in the payment of the dead\r\nrent to Pierce, for it was to their advantage also to eliminate\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe agreement which Rosseter secured from Pierce was binding \"for one\r\nwhole year\"; whether it was renewed we do not know, but the Children\r\nnever again acted in \"their house near St. Paul's Church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BANKSIDE AND THE BEAR GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time out of mind the suburb of London known as \"the\r\nBankside\"--the term was loosely applied to all the region south of the\r\nriver and west of the bridge--had been identified with sports and\r\npastimes. On Sundays, holidays, and other festive occasions, the\r\ncitizens, their wives, and their apprentices were accustomed to seek\r\noutdoor entertainment across the river, going thither in boats (of\r\nwhich there was an incredible number, converting \"the silver sliding\r\nThames\" almost into a Venetian Grand Canal), or strolling on foot over\r\nold London Bridge. On the Bankside the visitors could find maypoles\r\nfor dancing, butts for the practice of archery, and broad fields for\r\nathletic games; or, if so disposed, they could visit bull-baitings,\r\nbear-baitings, fairs, stage-plays, shows, motions, and other\r\namusements of a similar sort.\r\n\r\nNot all the attractions of the Bankside, however, were so innocent.\r\nFor here, in a long row bordering the river's edge, were situated the\r\nfamous stews of the city, licensed by authority of the Bishop of\r\nWinchester; and along with the stews, of course, such places as thrive\r\nin a district devoted to vice--houses for gambling, for\r\nconey-catching, and for evil practices of various sorts. The less said\r\nof this feature of the Bankside the better.\r\n\r\nMore needs to be said of the bull- and bear-baiting, which probably\r\nconstituted the chief amusement of the crowds from the city, and which\r\nwas later closely associated with the drama and with playhouses. This\r\nsport, now surviving in the bull-fights of Spain and of certain\r\nSpanish-American countries, was in former times one of the most\r\npopular species of entertainment cultivated by the English. Even so\r\nearly as 1174, William Fitz-Stephen, in his _Descriptio Nobilissimæ\r\nCiuitatis Londoniæ_, under the heading _De Ludis_, records that the\r\nLondon citizens diverted themselves on holiday occasions with the\r\nbaiting of beasts, when \"strong horn-goring bulls, or immense bears,\r\ncontend fiercely with dogs that are pitted against them.\"[177] In some\r\ntowns the law required that bulls intended for the butcher-shop should\r\nfirst be baited for the amusement of the public before being led to\r\nthe slaughter-house. Erasmus speaks of the \"many herds of bears\" which\r\nhe saw in England \"maintained for the purpose of baiting.\" The baiting\r\nwas accomplished by tying the bulls or bears to stakes, or when\r\npossible releasing them in an amphitheatre, and pitting against them\r\nbull-dogs, bred through centuries for strength and ferocity.\r\nOccasionally other animals, as ponies and apes, were brought into the\r\nfight, and the sport was varied in miscellaneous ways. Some of the\r\nanimals, by unusual courage or success, endeared themselves to the\r\nheart of the sporting public. Harry Hunks, George Stone, and Sacarson\r\nwere famous bears in Shakespeare's time; and the names of many of the\r\n\"game bulls\" and \"mastiff dogs\" became household words throughout\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: \"Pingues tauri cornupetæ, seu vrsi immanes, cum\r\nobiectis depugnant canibus.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANKSIDE\r\n\r\nShowing the Bear- and Bull-baiting Rings. (From the _Map of London_ by\r\nBraun and Hogenbergius, representing the city in 1554-1558.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANKSIDE\r\n\r\nThis was the second district of London used for public playhouses.\r\nNotice the amphitheatres for animal-baiting. (From William Smith's MS.\r\nof the Description of England, _c._ 1580.)]\r\n\r\nThe home of this popular sport was the Bankside. The earliest extant\r\nmap of Southwark,[178] drawn about 1542, shows in the very centre of\r\nHigh Street, just opposite London Bridge, a circular amphitheatre\r\nmarked \"The Bull Ring\"; and doubtless there were other places along\r\nthe river devoted to the same purpose. The baiting of bears was more\r\nclosely identified with the Manor of Paris Garden,[179] that section\r\nof the Bank lying to the west of the Clink, over towards the marshes\r\nof Lambeth. The association of bear-baiting with this particular\r\nsection was probably due to the fact that in early days the butchers\r\nof London used a part of the Manor of Paris Garden for the disposal\r\nof their offal,[180] and the entrails and other refuse from the\r\nslaughtered beasts furnished cheap and abundant food for the bears and\r\ndogs. The Earl of Manchester wrote to the Lord Mayor and the Common\r\nCouncil, in 1664, that he had been informed by the master of His\r\nMajesty's Game of Bears and Bulls, and others, that \"the Butcher's\r\nCompany had formerly caused all their offal in Eastcheap and Newgate\r\nMarket to be conveyed by the beadle of the Company unto two barrow\r\nhouses, conveniently placed on the river side, for the provision and\r\nfeeding of the King's Game of Bears.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: The map is reproduced in facsimile by Rendle as a\r\nfrontispiece to _Old Southwark and its People_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Or Parish Garden, possibly the more correct form. For\r\nthe early history of the Manor see William Bray, _The History and\r\nAntiquities of the County of Surrey_, III, 530; Wallace, in _Englische\r\nStudien_ (1911), XLIII, 341, note 3; Ordish, _Early London Theatres_,\r\np. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: Blount, in his _Glossographia_ (1681), p. 473, says of\r\nParis Garden: \"So called from Robert de Paris, who had a house and\r\ngarden there in Richard II.'s time; who by proclamation, ordained that\r\nthe butchers of London should buy that garden for receipt of their\r\ngarbage and entrails of beasts, to the end the city might not be\r\nannoyed thereby.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAR- AND BULL-BAITING RINGS\r\n\r\nThese \"rings\" later gave place to the Bear Garden. (From Agas's _Map\r\nof London_, representing the city as it was about 1560.)]\r\n\r\nAt first, apparently, the baiting of bears was held in open\r\nplaces,[181] with the bear tied to a stake and the spectators crowding\r\naround, or at best standing on temporary scaffolds. But later,\r\npermanent amphitheatres were provided. In Braun and Hogenberg's _Map\r\nof London_, drawn between 1554 and 1558, and printed in 1572, we find\r\ntwo well-appointed amphitheatres, with stables and kennels attached,\r\nlabeled respectively \"The Bear Baiting\" and \"The Bull Baiting.\" When\r\nthese amphitheatres were erected we do not know, but probably they do\r\nnot antedate by much the middle of the century.[182]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: See Gilpin's _Life of Cranmer_ for a description of a\r\nbear-baiting before the King held on or near the river's edge. See\r\nalso the proclamation of Henry VIII in 1546 against the stews, which\r\nimplies the non-existence of regular amphitheatres.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Sir Sidney Lee (_Shakespeare's England_, II, 428) says\r\nthat one of the amphitheatres was erected in 1526. I do not know his\r\nauthority; he was apparently misled by one of Rendle's statements.\r\nNeither of the amphitheatres is shown in Wyngaerde's careful _Map of\r\nLondon_ made about 1530-1540; possibly they are referred to in the\r\n_Diary_ of Henry Machyn under the date of May 26, 1554. The old \"Bull\r\nRing\" in High Street had then disappeared, and the baiting of bulls\r\nwas henceforth more or less closely associated, as was natural, with\r\nthe baiting of bears.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that at this time neither \"The Bull Baiting\" nor\r\n\"The Bear Baiting\" is in the Manor of Paris Garden, but close by in\r\nthe Liberty of the Clink. Yet the name \"Paris Garden\" continued to be\r\nused of the animal-baiting place for a century and more. Possibly the\r\nidentification of bear-baiting with Paris Garden was of such long\r\nstanding that Londoners could not readily adjust themselves to the\r\nchange; they at first confused the terms \"Bear Garden\" and \"Paris\r\nGarden,\" and later extended the term \"Paris Garden\" to include that\r\nsection of the Clink devoted to the baiting of animals.\r\n\r\nThe two amphitheatres, it seems, were used until 1583, when a serious\r\ncatastrophe put an end to one if not both of them. Stow, in his\r\n_Annals_, gives the following account of the accident:\r\n\r\n     The same thirteenth day of January, being Sunday, about four\r\n     of the clock in the afternoon, the old and underpropped\r\n     scaffolds round about the Bear Garden, commonly called Paris\r\n     Garden, on the south side of the river of Thamis over\r\n     against the city of London, overcharged with people, fell\r\n     suddenly down, whereby to the number of eight persons, men\r\n     and women, were slain, and many others sore hurt and bruised\r\n     to the shortening of their lives.[183]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: Stow, _Annals_ (ed. 1631), p. 696.]\r\n\r\nStubbes, the Puritan, writes in his more heightened style:\r\n\r\n     Upon the 13 day of January last, being the Saboth day,\r\n     _Anno_ 1583, the people, men, women, and children, both\r\n     young and old, an infinite number, flocking to those\r\n     infamous places where these wicked exercises are usually\r\n     practised (for they have their courts, gardens, and yards\r\n     for the same purpose), when they were all come together and\r\n     mounted aloft upon their scaffolds and galleries, and in the\r\n     midst of all their jolity and pastime, all the whole\r\n     building (not one stick standing) fell down with a most\r\n     wonderful and fearful confusion. So that either two or three\r\n     hundred men, women, and children (by estimation), whereof\r\n     seven were killed dead, some were wounded, some lamed, and\r\n     otherwise bruised and crushed almost to death. Some had\r\n     their brains dashed out, some their heads all to-squashed,\r\n     some their legs broken, some their arms, some their backs,\r\n     some their shoulders, some one hurt, some another.[184]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Philip Stubbes, _The Anatomie of Abuses_ (ed.\r\nFurnivall), p. 179.]\r\n\r\nThe building, which the Reverend John Field described as \"old and\r\nrotten,\"[185] was a complete ruin; \"not a stick was left so high as\r\nthe bear was fastened to.\" The Puritan preachers loudly denounced the\r\nunholy spectacles, pointing to the catastrophe as a clear warning from\r\nthe Almighty; and the city authorities earnestly besought the Privy\r\nCouncil to put an end to such performances. Yet the owners of the\r\nbuilding set to work at once, and soon had erected a new house,\r\nstronger and larger and more pretentious than before. The Lord Mayor,\r\nin some indignation, wrote to the Privy Council on July 3, 1583, that\r\n\"the scaffolds are new builded, and the multitudes on the Saboth day\r\ncalled together in most excessive number.\"[186]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: _A Godly Exhortation by Occasion of the Late Judgement\r\nof God, Shewed at Paris-Garden_ (London, 1583). Another account of the\r\ndisaster may be found in Vaughan's _Golden Grove_ (1600).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 65.]\r\n\r\nThe New Bear Garden, octagonal in form, was probably modeled after the\r\nplayhouses in Shoreditch, and made in all respects superior to the old\r\namphitheatre which it supplanted.[187] We find that it was reckoned\r\namong the sights of the city, and was exhibited to distinguished\r\nforeign visitors. For example, when Sir Walter Raleigh undertook to\r\nentertain the French Ambassador, he carried him to view the monuments\r\nin Westminster Abbey and to see the new Bear Garden.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: What became of the other amphitheatre labeled \"The Bull\r\nBaiting\" I do not know. Stow, in his _Survey_, 1598, says: \"Now to\r\nreturn to the west bank, there be two bear gardens, the old and new\r\nplaces, wherein be kept bears, bulls, and other beasts to be baited.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAR GARDEN\r\n\r\nFrom Visscher's _Map of London_, published in 1616, but representing\r\nthe city as it was several years earlier.]\r\n\r\nA picture of the building is to be seen in the Hondius _View of\r\nLondon_, 1610 (see page 149), and in the small inset views from the\r\ntitle-pages of Holland's _Her[Greek: ô]ologia_, 1620, and Baker's\r\n_Chronicle_, 1643 (see page 147), all three of which probably go back\r\nto a view of London made between 1587 and 1597, and now lost. Another\r\nrepresentation of the structure is to be seen in the Delaram portrait\r\nof King James, along with the Rose and the Globe (see opposite page\r\n246). The best representation of the building, however, is in\r\nVisscher's _View of London_ (see page 127), printed in 1616, but drawn\r\nseveral years earlier.[188]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: For a fuller discussion of these various maps and views\r\nsee pages 146, 248, and 328. Norden's map of 1594 (see page 147)\r\nmerely indicates the site of the building.]\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not directly concerned with the history of the Bear\r\nGarden,[189] a few descriptions of \"the royal game of bears, bulls,\r\nand dogs\" drawn from contemporary sources will be of interest and of\r\nspecific value for the discussion of the Hope Playhouse--itself both a\r\nbear garden and a theatre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: For such a history the reader is referred to Ordish,\r\n_Early London Theatres_; Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, and _Henslowe\r\nPapers_; Young, _The History of Dulwich College_; Rendle, _The\r\nBankside_, and _The Playhouses at Bankside_.]\r\n\r\nRobert Laneham, in his _Description of the Entertainment at\r\nKenilworth_ (1575), writes thus of a baiting of bears before the\r\nQueen:\r\n\r\n     Well, syr, the Bearz wear brought foorth intoo the Coourt,\r\n     the dogs set too them.... It was a Sport very pleazaunt of\r\n     theez beastz; to see the bear with his pink nyez leering\r\n     after hiz enemiez approoch, the nimbleness & wayt of ye dog\r\n     to take his auauntage, and the fors & experiens of the bear\r\n     agayn to auoyd the assauts: if he war bitten in one place,\r\n     how he woold pynch in an oother to get free: that if he wear\r\n     taken onez, then what shyft, with byting, with clawing, with\r\n     rooring, tossing, & tumbling he woold woork to wynd hym self\r\n     from them: and when he waz lose, to shake his earz tywse or\r\n     thryse, wyth the blud and the slauer aboout his fiznomy, waz\r\n     a matter of a goodly releef.\r\n\r\nJohn Houghton, in his _Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and\r\nTrade_,[190] gives a vivid account of the baiting of the bull. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     The bull takes great care to watch his enemy, which is a\r\n     mastiff dog (commonly used to the sport) with a short nose\r\n     that his teeth may take the better hold; this dog, if right,\r\n     will creep upon his belly that he may, if possible, get the\r\n     bull by the nose; which the bull as carefully strives to\r\n     defend by laying it close to the ground, where his horns are\r\n     also ready to do what in them lies to toss the dog; and this\r\n     is the true sport. But if more dogs than one come at once,\r\n     or they are cowardly and come under his legs, he will, if he\r\n     can, stamp their guts out. I believe I have seen a dog\r\n     tossed by a bull thirty, if not forty foot high; and when\r\n     they are tossed, either higher or lower, the men above\r\n     strive to catch them on their shoulders, lest the fall might\r\n     mischief the dogs. They commonly lay sand about that if they\r\n     fall upon the ground it may be the easier. Notwithstanding\r\n     this care a great many dogs are killed, more have their\r\n     limbs broke, and some hold so fast that, by the bull's\r\n     swinging them, their teeth are often broken out.... The true\r\n     courage and art is to hold the bull by the nose 'till he\r\n     roars, which a courageous bull scorns to do.... This is a\r\n     sport the English much delight in; and not only the baser\r\n     sort, but the greatest lords and ladies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: No. 108, August, 1694. Quoted by J.P. Malcolm,\r\n_Anecdotes of the Manners and Customs of London from the Roman\r\nInvasion to the Year 1700_ (London, 1811), p. 433.]\r\n\r\nAn attendant upon the Duke of Nexara, who visited England in 1544,\r\nwrote the following account of a bear-baiting witnessed in London:\r\n\r\n     In another part of the city we saw seven bears, some of them\r\n     of great size. They were led out every day to an enclosure,\r\n     where being tied with a long rope, large and intrepid dogs\r\n     are thrown to them, in order that they may bite and make\r\n     them furious. It is no bad sport to see them fight, and the\r\n     assaults they give each other. To each of the large bears\r\n     are matched three or four dogs, which sometimes get the\r\n     better and sometimes are worsted, for besides the fierceness\r\n     and great strength of the bears to defend themselves with\r\n     their teeth, they hug the dogs with their paws so tightly,\r\n     that, unless the masters came to assist them, they would be\r\n     strangled by such soft embraces. Into the same place they\r\n     brought a pony with an ape fastened on its back, and to see\r\n     the animal kicking amongst the dogs, with the screams of the\r\n     ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of\r\n     the pony, is very laughable.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: The original manuscript of this narrative, in Spanish,\r\nis preserved in the British Museum. I quote the translation by\r\nFrederick Madden, in _Archæologia_, XIII, 354-55.]\r\n\r\nOrazio Busino, the chaplain of the Venetian Embassy in London, writes\r\nin his _Anglipotrida_ (1618):\r\n\r\n     The dogs are detached from the bear by inserting between the\r\n     teeth ... certain iron spattles with a wooden handle; whilst\r\n     they take them off the bull (keeping at a greater distance)\r\n     with certain flat iron hooks which they apply to the thighs\r\n     or even to the neck of the dog, whose tail is simultaneously\r\n     dexterously seized by another of these rufflers. The bull\r\n     can hardly get at anybody, as he wears a collar round his\r\n     neck with only fifteen feet of rope, which is fastened to a\r\n     stake deeply planted in the middle of the theatre. Other\r\n     rufflers are at hand with long poles to put under the dog so\r\n     as to break his fall after he has been tossed by the bull;\r\n     the tips of these [poles] are covered with thick leather to\r\n     prevent them from disembowelling the dogs. The most spirited\r\n     stroke is considered to be that of the dog who seizes the\r\n     bull's lip, clinging to it and pinning the animal for some\r\n     time; the second best hit is to seize the eyebrows; the\r\n     third, but far inferior, consists in seizing the bull's\r\n     ear.[192]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: _The Calendar of State Papers_, Venetian, XV, 258.]\r\n\r\nPaul Hentzner, the German traveler who visited London in 1598, wrote\r\nthus of the Bear Garden:\r\n\r\n     There is still another place, built in the form of a\r\n     theatre, which serves for the baiting of bulls and bears;\r\n     they are fastened behind, and then worried by great English\r\n     bull-dogs, but not without great risk to the dogs, from the\r\n     horns of the one, and the teeth of the other; and it\r\n     sometimes happens they are killed upon the spot; fresh ones\r\n     are immediately supplied in the places of those that are\r\n     wounded or tired. To this entertainment there often follows\r\n     that of whipping a blinded bear, which is performed by five\r\n     or six men standing circularly with whips, which they\r\n     exercise upon him without any mercy, as he cannot escape\r\n     from them because of his chain; he defends himself with all\r\n     his force and skill, throwing down all who come within his\r\n     reach, and are not active enough to get out of it, and\r\n     tearing the whips out of their hands and breaking them.\r\n\r\nThe following passage is taken from the diary of the Duke of\r\nWirtemberg (who visited London in 1592), \"noted down daily in the most\r\nconcise manner possible, at his Highness's gracious command, by his\r\nprivate secretary\":[193]\r\n\r\n     On the 1st of September his Highness was shown in London the\r\n     English dogs, of which there were about 120, all kept in the\r\n     same enclosure, but each in separate kennel. In order to\r\n     gratify his Highness, and at his desire, two bears and a\r\n     bull were baited; at such times you can perceive the breed\r\n     and mettle of the dogs, for although they receive serious\r\n     injuries from the bears, and are caught by the horns of the\r\n     bull and tossed into the air so as frequently to fall down\r\n     again upon the horns, they do not give in, [but fasten on\r\n     the bull so firmly] that one is obliged to pull them back by\r\n     the tails and force open their jaws. Four dogs at once were\r\n     set on the bull; they however could not gain any advantage\r\n     over him, for he so artfully contrived to ward off their\r\n     attacks that they could not well get at him; on the\r\n     contrary, the bull served them very scurvily by striking and\r\n     beating at them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: The secretary was named Jacob Rathgeb, and the diary\r\nwas published at Tübingen in 1602 with a long title beginning: _A True\r\nand Faithful Narrative of the Bathing Excursion which His Serene\r\nHighness_, etc. A translation will be found in Rye, _England as Seen\r\nby Foreigners_, pp. 3-53.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a letter from one William Faunte to Edward Alleyn,\r\nthen proprietor of the Bear Garden, regarding the sale of some game\r\nbulls:\r\n\r\n     I understood by a man which came with two bears from the\r\n     garden, that you have a desire to buy one of my bulls. I\r\n     have three western bulls at this time, but I have had very\r\n     ill luck with them, for one of them hath lost his horn to\r\n     the quick, that I think he will never be able to fight\r\n     again; that is my old Star of the West: he was a very easy\r\n     bull. And my bull Bevis, he hath lost one of his eyes, but I\r\n     think if you had him he would do you more hurt than good,\r\n     for I protest I think he would either throw up your dogs\r\n     into the lofts, or else ding out their brains against the\r\n     grates.[194]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Collier, _The Alleyn Papers_, p. 31.]\r\n\r\nFinally, among the Alleyn papers of Dulwich College is an interesting\r\nbill, or advertisement, of an afternoon's performance at the Bear\r\nGarden:\r\n\r\n     To-morrow being Thursday shall be seen at the Bear Garden on\r\n     the Bankside a great match played by the gamesters of Essex,\r\n     who hath challenged all comers whatsoever to play five dogs\r\n     at the single bear for five pounds, and also to weary a bull\r\n     dead at the stake; and for your better content [you] shall\r\n     have pleasant sport with the horse and ape and whipping of\r\n     the blind bear. _Vivat Rex!_\r\n\r\nIn 1613 the Bear Garden was torn down, and a new and handsomer\r\nstructure erected in its place. For the history of this building the\r\nreader is referred to the chapter on \"The Hope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nNEWINGTON BUTTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bankside, as the preceding chapter indicates, offered unusual\r\nattractions to the actors. It had, indeed, long been associated with\r\nthe drama: in 1545 King Henry VIII, in a proclamation against\r\nvagabonds, players,[195] etc., noted their \"fashions commonly used at\r\nthe Bank, and such like naughty places, where they much haunt\"; and in\r\n1547 the Bishop of Winchester made complaint that at a time when he\r\nintended to have a dirge and mass for the late King, the actors in\r\nSouthwark planned to exhibit \"a solemn play, to try who shall have the\r\nmost resort, they in game or I in earnest.\"[196] The players,\r\ntherefore, were no strangers to \"the Bank.\" And when later in the\r\ncentury the hostility of the Common Council drove them to seek homes\r\nin localities not under the jurisdiction of the city, the suburb\r\nacross the river offered them a suitable refuge. For, although a large\r\nportion of Southwark was under the jurisdiction of London, certain\r\nparts were not, notably the Liberty of the Clink and the Manor of\r\nParis Garden, two sections bordering the river's edge, and the\r\ndistrict of Newington lying farther back to the southwest. In these\r\nplaces the actors could erect their houses and entertain the public\r\nwithout fear of the ordinances of the Corporation, and without danger\r\nof interruption by puritanical Lord Mayors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: It is just possible--but, I think, improbable--that the\r\nterm \"common players\" as used in this proclamation referred to\r\ngamblers. The term is regularly used in law to designate actors.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1547_,\r\nFebruary 5, p. 1; cf. Tytler's _Edward VI and Mary_, I, 20.]\r\n\r\nYet, as we have seen, the first public playhouses were erected not on\r\nthe Bankside--a \"naughty\" place,--but near Finsbury Field to the north\r\nof the city; and the reasons which led to the selection of such a\r\nquiet and respectable district have been pointed out.[197] It was\r\ninevitable, however, that sooner or later a playhouse should make its\r\nappearance in the region to the south of the city. And at an early\r\ndate--how early it is impossible to say, but probably not long after\r\nthe erection of the Theatre and the Curtain--there appeared in\r\nSouthwark a building specially devoted to the use of players. Whether\r\nit was a new structure modeled after the theatres of Shoreditch, or\r\nmerely an old building converted into a playhouse, we cannot say. It\r\nseems to have been something more than an inn-yard fitted up for\r\ndramatic purposes, and yet something less than the \"sumptuous theatre\r\nhouses\" erected \"on purpose\" for plays to the north of the city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: See page 29.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the building was, it was situated at Newington Butts (a\r\nplace so called from the butts for archery anciently erected there),\r\nand, unfortunately, at a considerable distance from the river. Exactly\r\nhow far playgoers from London had to walk to reach the theatre after\r\ncrossing over the river we do not know; but the Privy Council speaks\r\nof \"the tediousness of the way\" thither,[198] and Stow notes that the\r\nparish church of Newington was \"distant one mile from London Bridge.\"\r\nFurther information about the building--its exact situation, its size,\r\nits exterior shape, its interior arrangement, and such-like\r\ndetails--is wholly lacking.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: The Council again refers to the building in the phrase\r\n\"in any of these remote places.\" (Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_,\r\nXII, 15.)]\r\n\r\nNor are we much better off in regard to its ownership, management, and\r\ngeneral history. This seems to be due to the fact that it was not\r\nintimately associated with any of the more important London troupes;\r\nand to the fact that after a few unsuccessful years it ceased to\r\nexist. Below I have recorded the few and scattered references which\r\nconstitute our meagre knowledge of its history.\r\n\r\nThe first passage cited may refer to the playhouse at Newington Butts.\r\nIt is an order of the Privy Council, May 13, 1580, thus summarized by\r\nthe clerk:\r\n\r\n     A letter to the Justices of Peace of the County of Surrey,\r\n     that whereas their Lordships do understand that\r\n     notwithstanding their late order given to the Lord Mayor to\r\n     forbid all plays within and about the city until Michaelmas\r\n     next for avoiding of infection, nevertheless certain players\r\n     do play sundry days every week at Newington Butts in that\r\n     part of Surrey without the jurisdiction of the said Lord\r\n     Mayor, contrary to their Lordship's order; their Lordships\r\n     require the Justices not only to inquire who they be that\r\n     disobey their commandment in that behalf, and not only to\r\n     forbid them expressly for playing in any of these remote\r\n     places near unto the city until Michaelmas, but to have\r\n     regard that within the precinct of Surrey none be permitted\r\n     to play; if any do, to commit them and to advertise them,\r\n     &c.[199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XII, 15.]\r\n\r\nThe next passage clearly refers to \"the theatre\" at Newington Butts.\r\nOn May 11, 1586, the Privy Council dispatched a letter to the Lord\r\nMayor, which the clerk thus summarized:\r\n\r\n     A letter to the Lord Mayor: his Lordship is desired,\r\n     according to his request made to their Lordships by his\r\n     letters of the vii th of this present, to give order for the\r\n     restraining of plays and interludes within and about the\r\n     city of London, for the avoiding of infection feared to grow\r\n     and increase this time of summer by the common assemblies of\r\n     people at those places; and that their Lordships have taken\r\n     the like order for the prohibiting of the use of plays at\r\n     the theatre, and the other places about Newington, out of\r\n     his charge.[200]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Ibid._, XIV, 102.]\r\n\r\nChalmers[201] thought the word \"theatre\" was used of the Newington\r\nPlayhouse, and for this he was taken to task by Collier,[202] who\r\nsays: \"He confounds it with the playhouse emphatically called 'the\r\nTheatre' in Shoreditch; and on consulting the Register, we find that\r\nno such playhouse as the Newington Theatre is there spoken of.\" But\r\nChalmers was right; for if we consult the \"Registers\" we find the\r\nfollowing letter, dispatched to the Justices of Surrey on the very\r\nsame day that the letter just quoted was sent to the Lord Mayor:\r\n\r\n     A letter to the Justices of Surrey, that according to such\r\n     direction as hath been given by their Lordships to the Lord\r\n     Mayor to restrain and inhibit the use of plays and\r\n     interludes in public places in and about the City of London,\r\n     in respect of the heat of the year now drawing on, for the\r\n     avoiding of the infection like to grow and increase by the\r\n     ordinary assemblies of the people to those places, they are\r\n     also required in like sort to take order that the plays and\r\n     assemblies of the people at the theatre or any other places\r\n     about Newington be forthwith restrained and forborn as\r\n     aforesaid, &c.[203]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: _Apology_, p. 403.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), III, 131.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XIV, 99.]\r\n\r\nThe phrase, \"the theatre or any other places about Newington,\" when\r\naddressed to the \"Justices of the Peace of Surrey\" could refer only to\r\nthe Newington Butts Playhouse.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 1592, because of a riot in Southwark, the Privy Council\r\nclosed all the playhouses in and about London.[204] Shortly after this\r\nthe Lord Strange's Men, who were then occupying the Rose, petitioned\r\nthe Council to be allowed to resume acting in their playhouse. The\r\nCouncil granted them instead permission to act three times a week at\r\nNewington Butts; but the players, not relishing this proposal, chose\r\nrather to travel in the provinces. Soon finding that they could not\r\nmake their expenses in the country, they returned to London, and again\r\nappealed to the Privy Council to be allowed to perform at the\r\nRose.[205] The warrant issued by the Council in reply to this second\r\npetition tells us for the first time something definite about the\r\nNewington Butts Theatre:\r\n\r\n     To the Justices, Bailiffs, Constables, and Others to Whom it\r\n     Shall Appertain:\r\n\r\n     Whereas not long since, upon some considerations, we did\r\n     restrain the Lord Strange his servants from playing at the\r\n     Rose on the Bankside, and enjoyned them to play three days\r\n     [a week] at Newington Butts; now forasmuch as we are\r\n     satisfied that by reason of the tediousness of the way, and\r\n     that of long time plays have not there been used on working\r\n     days, and for that a number of poor watermen are thereby\r\n     relieved, you shall permit and suffer them, or any other,\r\n     there [at the Rose] to exercise themselves in such sort as\r\n     they have done heretofore, and that the Rose may be at\r\n     liberty without any restraint so long as it shall be free\r\n     from infection, any commandment from us heretofore to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding.[206]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, 50, 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: _Ibid._, pp. 43-44.]\r\n\r\nFrom this warrant we learn that so early as 1592 the Newington house\r\nwas almost deserted, and that \"of long time\" plays had been given\r\nthere only occasionally.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, on June 3, 1594, Henslowe sent the Admiral's and the\r\nChamberlain's Men to play temporarily at the half-deserted old\r\nplayhouse, probably in order to give opportunity for needed repairs at\r\nthe Rose.[207] The section of his _Diary_, under the heading, \"In the\r\nname of god Amen begininge at newington my Lord Admeralle men & my\r\nLord Chamberlen men As followethe 1594,\" constitutes the fullest and\r\nclearest--and, one may add, the most illustrious--chapter in the\r\nhistory of this obscure building; for although it extends over only\r\nten days, it tells us that Edward Alleyn, Richard Burbage, and William\r\nShakespeare then trod the Newington stage, and it records the\r\nperformance there of such plays as _The Jew of Malta_, _Andronicus_,\r\n_The Taming of a Shrew_, and _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: There is no evidence that Henslowe owned the house at\r\nNewington; he might very well have rented it for this particular\r\noccasion.]\r\n\r\nWe next hear of the building near the end of the century: in 1599,\r\nsays Mr. Wallace, it was \"only a memory, as shown by a contemporary\r\nrecord to be published later.\"[208]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Wallace, _The First London Theatre_, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nTwo other references close the history. In _A Woman is a Weathercock_,\r\nIII, iii, printed in 1612, but written earlier, one of the actors\r\nexclaims of an insufferable pun: \"O Newington Conceit!\" The fact that\r\nthis sneer is the only reference to the Newington Playhouse found in\r\ncontemporary literature is a commentary on the low esteem in which the\r\nbuilding was held by the Elizabethans, and its relative unimportance\r\nfor the history of the drama.\r\n\r\nThe last notice is in Howe's continuation of Stow's _Annals_\r\n(1631).[209] After enumerating all the theatres built in London and\r\nthe suburbs \"within the space of three-score years,\" he adds vaguely,\r\n\"besides one in former time at Newington Butts.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: Page 1004.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless one reason for the obscure rôle which the theatre at\r\nNewington played in the history of the drama was \"the tediousness of\r\nthe way\" thither. The Rose, the second theatre to make its appearance\r\nin Surrey, was much more conveniently situated with respect to the\r\ncity, for it was erected in the Liberty of the Clink and very near the\r\nriver's edge. As a result, it quickly attained popularity with London\r\nplaygoers, and before the end of the century had caused the centre of\r\ndramatic activity to be shifted from Finsbury Field to the Bank.\r\n\r\nThe builder of the Rose was one Philip Henslowe, then, so far as our\r\nevidence goes, unknown to the dramatic world, but destined soon to\r\nbecome the greatest theatrical proprietor and manager of the\r\nTudor-Stuart age. We find him living on the Bankside and in the\r\nLiberty of the Clink at least as early as 1577. At first, so we are\r\ntold, he was \"but a poor man,\" described as \"servant ... unto one Mr.\r\nWoodward.\" Upon the death of his employer, Woodward, he married the\r\nwidow, Agnes Woodward, and thus came into the possession of\r\nconsiderable property. \"All his wealth came by her,\" swore the\r\ncharwoman Joan Horton. This, however, simply means that Henslowe\r\nobtained his original capital by his marriage; for, although very\r\nilliterate, he was shrewd in handling money, and he quickly amassed\r\n\"his wealth\" through innumerable business ventures.\r\n\r\nAs one of these ventures, no doubt, he leased from the Parish of St.\r\nMildred, on March 24, 1585, a small piece of property on the Bankside\r\nknown as \"The Little Rose.\" \"Among the early surveys, 1 Edward VI,\"\r\nsays Rendle, \"we see that this was not merely a name--the place was a\r\nveritable Rose Garden.\"[210] At the time of the lease the property is\r\ndescribed as consisting of a dwelling-house called \"The Rose,\" \"two\r\ngardens adjoining the same\" consisting of \"void ground,\" and at least\r\none other small building. The dwelling-house Henslowe probably leased\r\nas a brothel--for this was the district of the stews; and the small\r\nbuilding mentioned above, situated at the south end of one of the\r\ngardens, he let to a London grocer named John Cholmley, who used it\r\n\"to keep victualing in.\"[211]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: W. Rendle, in _The Antiquarian Magazine and\r\nBibliographer_, VIII, 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: For the earlier history of the Rose estate see Rendle,\r\n_The Bankside_, p. xv, and Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, 43. \"The plan\r\nof the Rose estate in the vestry of St. Mildred's Church in London\r\nmarks the estate exactly, but not the precise site of the Rose\r\nPlayhouse. The estate consisted of three rods, and was east of Rose\r\nAlley.\" (Rendle, _The Bankside_, p. xxx.)]\r\n\r\nNot satisfied, however, with the income from these two buildings,\r\nHenslowe a year and a half later was planning to utilize a part of the\r\n\"void ground\" for the erection of a theatre. What interested him in\r\nthe drama we do not know, but we may suppose that the same reason\r\nwhich led Burbage, Brayne, Lanman, and others to build playhouses\r\ninfluenced him, namely, the prospect of \"great gains to ensue\r\ntherefrom.\"[212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Possibly the fact that Burbage had just secured control\r\nof the Curtain, and hence had a monopoly of playhouses, was one of the\r\nreasons for a new playhouse.]\r\n\r\nFor the site of his proposed playhouse he allotted a small parcel of\r\nground ninety-four feet square and lying in the corner formed by Rose\r\nAlley and Maiden Lane (see page 245). Then he interested in the\r\nenterprise his tenant Cholmley, for, it seems, he did not wish to\r\nundertake so expensive and precarious a venture without sharing the\r\nrisk with another. On January 10, 1587, he and Cholmley signed a\r\nformal deed of partnership, according to which the playhouse was to be\r\nerected at once and at the sole cost of Henslowe; Cholmley, however,\r\nwas to have from the beginning a half-interest in the building, paying\r\nfor his share by installments of £25 10_s._ a quarter for a period of\r\neight years and three months.[213] The total sum to be paid by\r\nCholmley, £816, possibly represents the estimated cost of the\r\nbuilding and its full equipment, plus rental on the land.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: The deed of partnership is preserved among the Henslowe\r\npapers at Dulwich College. For an abstract of the deed see Greg,\r\n_Henslowe Papers_, p. 2. Henslowe seems to have driven a good bargain\r\nwith Cholmley.]\r\n\r\nThe building is referred to in the deed of January 10 as \"a playhouse\r\nnow in framing and shortly to be erected and set up.\" Doubtless it was\r\nready for occupancy early in the summer. That performances were given\r\nthere before the close of the year is at least indicated by an order\r\nof the Privy Council dated October 29, 1587:\r\n\r\n     A letter to the Justices of Surrey, that whereas the\r\n     inhabitants of Southwark had complained unto their Lordships\r\n     declaring that the order by their Lordships set down for the\r\n     restraining of plays and interludes within that county on\r\n     the Sabbath Days is not observed, and especially within the\r\n     Liberty of the Clink, and in the Parish of St.\r\n     Saviours....[214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XV, 271.]\r\n\r\nThe Rose was in \"the Liberty of the Clink and in the Parish of St.\r\nSaviours,\" and so far as we have any evidence it was the only place\r\nthere devoted to plays. Moreover, a distinct reference to it by name\r\nappears in the Sewer Records in April, 1588, at which date the\r\nbuilding is described as \"new.\"[215]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Discovered by Mr. Wallace and printed in the London\r\n_Times_, April 30, 1914.]\r\n\r\nIn Norden's _Map of London_ (1593), the Rose and the adjacent Bear\r\nGarden are correctly placed with respect to each other, but are\r\ncrudely drawn (see page 147). The representation of both as\r\ncircular--the Bear Garden, we know, was polygonal--was due merely to\r\nthis crudeness; yet the Rose seems to have been indeed circular in\r\nshape, \"the Bankside's round-house\" referred to in _Tom Tell Troth's\r\nMessage_. The building is so pictured in the Hondius map of 1610 (see\r\npage 149), and in the inset maps on the title-pages of Holland's\r\n_Her[Greek: ô]ologia_, 1620, and Baker's _Chronicle_, 1643 (see page\r\n147), all three of which apparently go back to an early map of London\r\nnow lost. The building is again pictured as circular, with the Bear\r\nGarden at the left and the Globe at the right, in the Delaram portrait\r\nof King James (opposite page 246).[216]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: The circular building pictured in these maps has been\r\nwidely heralded as the First Globe, but without reason; all the\r\nevidence shows that it was the Rose. For further discussion see the\r\nchapters dealing with the Bear Garden, the Globe, and the Hope. In the\r\nMerian _View_, issued in Frankfort in 1638, the Bear Garden and the\r\nGlobe, each named, are shown conspicuously in the foreground; in the\r\nbackground is vaguely represented an unnamed playhouse polygonal in\r\nshape. This could not possibly be the Rose. Merian's _View_ was a\r\ncompilation from Visscher's _View_ of 1616 and some other view of\r\nLondon not yet identified; it has no independent authority, and no\r\nvalue whatever so far as the Rose is concerned.]\r\n\r\nFrom Henslowe's _Diary_ we learn that the playhouse was of timber, the\r\nexterior of lath and plaster, the roof of thatch; and that it had a\r\nyard, galleries, a stage, a tiring-house, heavens, and a flagpole.\r\nThus it differed in no essential way from the playhouses already\r\nerected in Shoreditch or subsequently erected on the Bank.[217]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: If we may believe Johannes de Witt, the Rose was \"more\r\nmagnificent\" than the theatres in Shoreditch. See page 167.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAR GARDEN AND THE ROSE\r\n\r\nThe upper view, from Norden's _Map of London_, 1593, shows the\r\nrelative position of the Bear Garden and Rose. The lower view, an\r\ninset from the title-page of Baker's _Chronicle_, 1643, also shows the\r\nrelative position, and gives a more detailed picture of the two\r\nstructures. The Bear Garden is represented as polygonal, the Rose as\r\ncircular.]\r\n\r\nWhat troupes of actors used the Rose during the first five years of\r\nits existence we do not know; indeed, until 1592 we hear nothing\r\nfurther of the playhouse. As a result, some scholars have wrongly\r\ninferred that the building was not erected until the spring of\r\n1592.[218] It seems likely, as Mr. Greg suggests, that Henslowe and\r\nCholmley let the house to some company of players at a stipulated\r\nannual rent, and so had nothing to do with the management of its\r\nfinances. This would explain the complete absence of references to the\r\nplayhouse in Henslowe's accounts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Ordish, _Early London Theatres_, p. 155; Mantzius, _A\r\nHistory of Theatrical Art_, p. 58. Mr. Wallace's discovery of a\r\nreference to the Rose in the Sewer Records for April, 1588, quite\r\noverthrows this hypothesis.]\r\n\r\nDuring this obscure period of five years Cholmley disappears from the\r\nhistory of the Rose. It may be that he withdrew from the undertaking\r\nat the outset;[219] it may be that he failed to meet his payments, and\r\nso forfeited his moiety; or it may be that, becoming dissatisfied with\r\nhis bargain, he sold out to Henslowe. Whatever the cause, his interest\r\nin the playhouse passed over to Henslowe, who appears henceforth as\r\nthe sole proprietor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: This seems unlikely. At the beginning of Henslowe's\r\n_Diary_ we find the scrawl \"Chomley when\" (Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_ I,\r\n217); this was written not earlier than 1592, and it shows that\r\nCholmley was at that time in Henslowe's mind.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAR GARDEN AND THE ROSE\r\n\r\nA small inset view of London, from the map entitled \"The Kingdome of\r\nGreat Britaine and Ireland,\" printed in Speed's _Atlas_ (1611). The\r\nmap is dated 1610, but the inset view of London was copied, like the\r\ninset views to Baker's _Chronicle_ (1643) and to Holland's _Her[Greek:\r\nô]ologia_ (1620), from a lost map of London drawn about 1589-1599.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1592 the building was in need of repairs, and\r\nHenslowe spent a large sum of money in thoroughly overhauling it.[220]\r\nThe lathing and plastering of the exterior were done over, the roof\r\nwas re-thatched, new rafters were put in, and much heavy timber was\r\nused, indicating important structural alterations. In addition, the\r\nstage was painted, the lord's room and the tiring-house were provided\r\nwith ceilings, a new flagpole was erected, and other improvements were\r\nintroduced. Clearly an attempt was made to render the building not\r\nonly stronger, but also more attractive in appearance and more modern\r\nin equipment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 7.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate occasion for these extensive alterations and repairs was\r\nthe engagement of Lord Strange's Men to occupy the playhouse under\r\nHenslowe's management. This excellent troupe, with Edward Alleyn at\r\nits head, was perhaps the best company of actors then in London. It\r\nlater became the Lord Chamberlain's Company, with which Shakespeare\r\nwas identified; even at this early date, although documentary proof is\r\nlacking, he may have been numbered among its obscure members. The\r\ntroupe opened the Rose on February 19, 1592, with a performance of\r\nRobert Greene's _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, and followed this with\r\nmany famous plays, such as _The Spanish Tragedy_, _The Jew of Malta_,\r\n_Orlando Furioso_, and _Henry VI_.[221]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: For a list of their plays see Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_,\r\nI, 13 ff.]\r\n\r\nThe coming of Lord Strange's Men to the Rose led to a close friendship\r\nbetween Henslowe and Edward Alleyn, then twenty-six years of age, and\r\nat the height of his fame as an actor, a friendship which was cemented\r\nin the autumn by Alleyn's marriage to Henslowe's stepdaughter (and\r\nonly child) Joan Woodward. The two men, it seems, were thoroughly\r\ncongenial, and their common interests led to the formation of a\r\nbusiness partnership which soon became the most important single force\r\nin the theatrical life of the time.\r\n\r\nLord Strange's Men continued to act at the Rose from February 19 until\r\nJune 23, 1592, when the Privy Council, because of a serious riot in\r\nSouthwark, ordered the closing of all playhouses in and about London\r\nuntil Michaelmas following. Strange's Men very soon petitioned the\r\nCouncil to be allowed to reopen their playhouse; the Council, in\r\nreply, compromised by granting them permission to act three days a\r\nweek at Newington Butts. This, however, did not please the actors, and\r\nthey started on a tour of the provinces. In a short time, discovering\r\nthat they could not pay their expenses on the road, they again\r\npetitioned for permission to open the Rose, complaining that \"our\r\ncompany is great, and thereby our charge intolerable in traveling the\r\ncountry,\" and calling attention to the fact that \"the use of our\r\nplayhouse on the Bankside, by reason of the passage to and from the\r\nsame by water, is a great relief to the poor watermen there.\"[222] The\r\npetition was accompanied by a supporting petition from the watermen\r\nasking the Council \"for God's sake and in the way of charity to\r\nrespect us your poor watermen.\" As a result of these petitions the\r\nCouncil gave permission, probably late in August, 1592, for the\r\nreopening of the playhouse.[223] But before Strange's Men could take\r\nadvantage of this permission, a severe outbreak of the plague caused a\r\ngeneral inhibition of acting, and not until December 29, 1592, were\r\nthey able to resume their performances at the Rose. A month later the\r\nplague broke out again with unusual severity, and on February 1, 1593,\r\nplaying was again inhibited. The year rapidly developed into one of\r\nthe worst plague-years in the history of the city; between ten and\r\nfifteen thousand persons died of the epidemic, and most of the London\r\ncompanies, including Strange's Men, went on an extended tour of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: See Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 43. For a general\r\ndiscussion of various problems involved, see Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_,\r\nII, 51-2.]\r\n\r\nNear the close of the year, and while Strange's Men were still\r\ntraveling, the plague temporarily subsided, and Sussex's Men, who were\r\nthen in London, secured the use of the Rose. They began to act there\r\non December 27, 1593; but on February 6, 1594, the plague having again\r\nbecome threatening, acting was once more inhibited. This brief\r\noccupation of the Rose by Sussex's Men was notable only for the first\r\nperformance of _Titus Andronicus_.[224]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOAN WOODWARD ALLEYN\r\n\r\nThe stepdaughter and only child of Philip Henslowe, whose marriage to\r\nthe great actor Edward Alleyn led to the Henslowe-Alleyn theatrical\r\nenterprises. The portrait is here reproduced for the first time. (From\r\nthe Dulwich Picture Gallery, by permission.)]\r\n\r\nAt Easter, April 1, Strange's Men being still absent, Henslowe allowed\r\nthe Rose to be used for eight days by \"the Queen's Men and my Lord of\r\nSussex's together.\" This second brief chapter in the long and varied\r\nhistory of the playhouse is interesting only for two performances of\r\nthe old _King Leir_.[225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 17.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the severe plague and the long continued inhibition of\r\nacting, there was a general confusion and subsequent reorganization of\r\nthe various London troupes. The Admiral's Men, who had been dispersed\r\nin 1591, some joining Strange's Men, some going to travel in Germany,\r\nwere brought together again; and Edward Alleyn, who had formerly been\r\ntheir leader, and who even after he became one of Strange's Men\r\ncontinued to describe himself as \"servant to the right honorable the\r\nLord Admiral,\"[226] was induced to rejoin them. Alleyn thereupon\r\nbrought them to the Rose, where they began to perform on May 14, 1594.\r\nAfter three days, however, they ceased, probably to allow Henslowe to\r\nmake repairs or improvements on the building.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: He is so described, for example, in the warrant issued\r\nby the Privy Council on May 6, 1593, to Strange's Men.]\r\n\r\nStrange's Men also had undergone reorganization. On April 16, 1594,\r\nthey lost by death their patron, the Earl of Derby. Shortly afterwards\r\nthey secured the patronage of the Lord Chamberlain, and before June\r\n3, 1594, they had arrived in London and reported to their former\r\nmanager, Henslowe.\r\n\r\nAt this time, apparently, the Rose was still undergoing repairs; so\r\nHenslowe sent both the Admiral's and the Chamberlain's Men to act at\r\nNewington Butts, where they remained from June 3 to June 13, 1594. On\r\nJune 15 the Admiral's Men moved back to the Rose, which henceforth\r\nthey occupied alone; and the Chamberlain's Men, thus robbed of their\r\nplayhouse, went to the Theatre in Shoreditch.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Lent, 1595, Henslowe took occasion to make\r\nfurther repairs on his playhouse, putting in new pales, patching the\r\nexterior with new lath and plaster, repainting the woodwork, and\r\notherwise furbishing up the building. The total cost of this work was\r\n£108 10_s._ And shortly after, as a part of these improvements, no\r\ndoubt, he paid £7 2_s._ for \"making the throne in the heavens.\"[227]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 4.]\r\n\r\nNear the close of July, 1597, Pembroke's Men at the Swan acted Nashe's\r\nsatirical play, _The Isle of Dogs_, containing, it seems, a burlesque\r\non certain persons high in authority. As a result the Privy Council on\r\nJuly 28 ordered all acting in and about London to cease until November\r\n1, and all public playhouses to be plucked down and ruined.[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: For the details of this episode see the chapter on the\r\nSwan.]\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the order, happily, was not put into effect, and on\r\nOctober 11 the Rose was allowed to open again. The Privy Council,\r\nhowever, punished the Swan and Pembroke's Company by ordering that\r\nonly the Admiral's Men at the Rose and the Chamberlain's Men at the\r\nCurtain should henceforth be \"allowed.\" As a consequence of this\r\ntrouble with the authorities the best actors of Pembroke's Company\r\njoined the Admiral's Men under Henslowe. This explains the entry in\r\nthe _Diary_: \"In the name of God, amen. The xi of October began my\r\nLord Admiral's and my Lord Pembroke's Men to play at my house,\r\n1597.\"[229] The two companies were very soon amalgamated, and the\r\nstrong troupe thus formed continued to act at the Rose under the name\r\nof the Admiral's Men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 54.]\r\n\r\nThe Chamberlain's Men, who in 1594 had been forced to surrender the\r\nRose to the Admiral's Men and move to the Theatre, and who in 1597 had\r\nbeen driven from the Theatre to the Curtain, at last, in 1599, built\r\nfor themselves a permanent home, the Globe, situated on the Bankside\r\nand close to the Rose. Henslowe's ancient structure[230] was eclipsed\r\nby this new and handsome building, \"the glory of the Bank\"; and the\r\nAdmiral's Men, no doubt, felt themselves placed at a serious\r\ndisadvantage. As a result, in the spring of 1600, Henslowe and Alleyn\r\nbegan the erection of a splendid new playhouse, the Fortune, designed\r\nto surpass the Globe in magnificence, and to furnish a suitable and\r\npermanent home for the Admiral's Men. The building was situated in the\r\nsuburb to the north of the city, far away from the Bankside and the\r\nGlobe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: In January, 1600, the Earl of Nottingham refers to \"the\r\ndangerous decay\" of the Rose. See Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 45; cf.\r\np. 52.]\r\n\r\nThe erection of this handsome new playhouse led to violent outbursts\r\nfrom the Puritans, and vigorous protests from the city fathers.\r\nAccordingly the Privy Council on June 22, 1600, issued the following\r\norder:[231]\r\n\r\n     Whereas divers complaints have heretofore been made unto the\r\n     Lords and other of Her Majesty's Privy Council of the\r\n     manifold abuses and disorders that have grown and do\r\n     continue by occasion of many houses erected and employed in\r\n     and about London for common stage-plays; and now very lately\r\n     by reason of some complaint exhibited by sundry persons\r\n     against the building of the like house [the Fortune] in or\r\n     near Golding Lane ... the Lords and the rest of Her\r\n     Majesty's Privy Council with one and full consent have\r\n     ordered in manner and form as follows. First, that there\r\n     shall be about the city two houses, and no more, allowed to\r\n     serve for the use of the common stage-plays; of the which\r\n     houses, one [the Globe] shall be in Surrey, in that place\r\n     which is commonly called the Bankside, or thereabouts; and\r\n     the other [the Fortune], in Middlesex.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXX, 395.]\r\n\r\nThis sealed the fate of the Rose.\r\n\r\nIn July the Admiral's Men had a reckoning with Henslowe, and prepared\r\nto abandon the Bankside. After they had gone, but before they had\r\nopened the Fortune, Henslowe, on October 28, 1600, let the Rose to\r\nPembroke's Men for two days.[232] Possibly the troupe had secured\r\nspecial permission to use the playhouse for this limited time;\r\npossibly Henslowe thought that since the Fortune was not yet open to\r\nthe public, no objection would be made. Of course, after the Admiral's\r\nMen opened the Fortune--in November or early in December, 1600--the\r\nRose, according to the order of the Privy Council just quoted, had to\r\nstand empty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 131.]\r\n\r\nIts career, however, was not absolutely run. In the spring of 1602\r\nWorcester's Men and Oxford's Men were \"joined by agreement together in\r\none company,\" and the Queen, \"at the suit of the Earl of Oxford,\"\r\nordered that this company be \"allowed.\" Accordingly the Privy Council\r\nwrote to the Lord Mayor on March 31, 1602, informing him of the fact,\r\nand adding: \"And as the other companies that are allowed, namely of me\r\nthe Lord Admiral and the Lord Chamberlain, be appointed their certain\r\nhouses, and one and no more to each company, so we do straightly\r\nrequire that this company be likewise [appointed] to one place. And\r\nbecause we are informed the house called the Boar's Head is the place\r\nthey have especially used and do best like of, we do pray and require\r\nyou that that said house, namely the Boar's Head, may be assigned unto\r\nthem.\"[233] But the Lord Mayor seems to have opposed the use of the\r\nBoar's Head, and the upshot was that the Council gave permission for\r\nthis \"third company\" to open the Rose. In Henslowe's _Diary_, we read:\r\n\"Lent unto my Lord of Worcester's Players as followeth, beginning the\r\n17 day of August, 1602.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: _The Remembrancia_, II, 189; The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 85.]\r\n\r\nThis excellent company, destined to become the Queen's Company after\r\nthe accession of King James, included such important actors as William\r\nKempe, John Lowin, Christopher Beeston, John Duke, Robert Pallant, and\r\nRichard Perkins; and it employed such well-known playwrights as Thomas\r\nHeywood (the \"prose Shakespeare,\" who was also one of the troupe),\r\nHenry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, John Day, Wentworth Smith, Richard\r\nHathway, and John Webster. The company continued to act at the Rose\r\nuntil March 16, 1603, when it had a reckoning with Henslowe and left\r\nthe playhouse.[234] In May, however, after the coming of King James,\r\nit returned to the Rose, and we find Henslowe opening a new account:\r\n\"In the name of God, amen. Beginning to play again by the King's\r\nlicense, and laid out since for my Lord of Worcester's Men, as\r\nfolloweth, 1603, 9 of May.\"[235] Since only one entry follows, it is\r\nprobable that the company did not remain long at the Rose. No doubt,\r\nthe outbreak of the plague quickly drove them into the country; and on\r\ntheir return to London in the spring of 1604 they occupied the Boar's\r\nHead and the Curtain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: On March 19 the Privy Council formally ordered the\r\nsuppression of all plays. This was five days before the death of Queen\r\nElizabeth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 190.]\r\n\r\nAfter this there is no evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nHenslowe's lease of the Little Rose property, on which his playhouse\r\nstood, expired in 1605, and the Parish of St. Mildred's demanded an\r\nincrease in rental. The following note in the _Diary_ refers to a\r\nrenewal of the lease:\r\n\r\n     _Memorandum_, that the 25 of June, 1603, I talked with Mr.\r\n     Pope at the scrivener's shop where he lies,[236] concerning\r\n     the taking of the lease anew of the little Rose, and he\r\n     shewed me a writing betwixt the parish and himself which\r\n     was to pay twenty pound a year rent,[237] and to bestow a\r\n     hundred marks upon building, which I said I would rather\r\n     pull down the playhouse than I would do so, and he bad me\r\n     do, and said he gave me leave, and would bear me out, for it\r\n     was in him to do it.[238]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: Some scholars have supposed that this was Morgan Pope,\r\na part owner of the Bear Garden; but he is last heard of in 1585, and\r\nby 1605 was probably dead. Mr. Greg is of the opinion that Thomas\r\nPope, the well-known member of the King's Men at the Globe, is\r\nreferred to. From this has been developed the theory that Pope, acting\r\nfor the Globe players, had rented the Rose and closed it in order to\r\nprevent competition with the Globe on the Bankside. I believe,\r\nhowever, that the \"Mr. Pope\" here referred to was neither of these\r\nmen, but merely the agent of the Parish of St. Mildred. It is said\r\nthat he lived at a scrivener's shop. This could not apply to the actor\r\nThomas Pope, for we learn from his will, made less than a month later,\r\nthat he lived in a house of his own, furnished with plate and\r\nhousehold goods, and cared for by a housekeeper; and with him lived\r\nSusan Gasquine, whom he had \"brought up ever since she was born.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: The old rental was £7 a year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 178.]\r\n\r\nHenslowe did not renew his lease of the property. On October 4, 1605,\r\nthe Commissioners of the Sewers amerced him for the Rose, but return\r\nwas made that it was then \"out of his hands.\"[239] From a later entry\r\nin the Sewer Records, February 14, 1606, we learn that the new owner\r\nof the Rose was one Edward Box, of Bread Street, London. Box, it\r\nseems, either tore down the building, or converted it into tenements.\r\nThe last reference to it in the Sewer Records is on April 25, 1606,\r\nwhen it is referred to as \"the late playhouse.\"[240]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Wallace in the London _Times_, April 30, 1914, p. 10.\r\nIn view of these records it seems unnecessary to refute those persons\r\nwho assert that the Rose was standing so late as 1622. I may add,\r\nhowever, that before Mr. Wallace published the Sewer Records I had\r\nsuccessfully disposed of all the evidence which has been collected to\r\nshow the existence of the Rose after 1605. The chief source of this\r\nerror is a footnote by Malone in _Variorum_, III, 56; the source of\r\nMalone's error is probably to be seen in his footnote, _ibid._, p.\r\n66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: For the tourist the memory of the old playhouse to-day\r\nlingers about Rose Alley on the Bank.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SWAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manor of Paris Garden,[241] situated on the Bankside just to the\r\nwest of the Liberty of the Clink and to the east of the Lambeth\r\nmarshes, had once been in the possession of the Monastery of\r\nBermondsey. At the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, the\r\nproperty passed into the possession of the Crown; hence it was free\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, and\r\nwas on this account suitable for the erection of a playhouse. From the\r\nCrown the property passed through several hands, until finally, in\r\n1589, the entire \"lordship and manor of Paris Garden\" was sold for\r\n£850 to Francis Langley, goldsmith and citizen of London.[242]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: Or \"Parish Garden.\" See the note on page 121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: The sale took the form of a lease for one thousand\r\nyears.]\r\n\r\nLangley had purchased the Manor as an investment, and was ready to\r\nmake thereon such improvements as seemed to offer profitable returns.\r\nBurbage and Henslowe were reputed to be growing wealthy from their\r\nplayhouses, and Langley was tempted to erect a similar building on his\r\nnewly acquired property. Accordingly at some date before November,\r\n1594, he secured a license to erect a theatre in Paris Garden. The\r\nlicense was promptly opposed by the Lord Mayor of London, who\r\naddressed to the Lord High Treasurer on November 3, 1594, the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n     I understand that one Francis Langley ... intendeth to erect\r\n     a new stage or theatre (as they call it) for the exercising\r\n     of plays upon the Bankside. And forasmuch as we find by\r\n     daily experience the great inconvenience that groweth to\r\n     this city and the government thereof by the said plays, I\r\n     have emboldened myself to be an humble suitor to your good\r\n     Lordship to be a means for us rather to suppress all such\r\n     places built for that kind of exercise, than to erect any\r\n     more of the same sort.[243]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 74-76.]\r\n\r\nThe protest of the Lord Mayor, however, went unheeded, and Langley\r\nproceeded with the erection of his building. Presumably it was\r\nfinished and ready for the actors in the earlier half of 1595.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MANOR OF PARIS GARDEN AND THE SWAN\r\n\r\nA survey executed in 1627 by royal command.\r\n\r\n(Printed from Rendle's _The Bankside_.)]\r\n\r\nThe name given to the new playhouse was \"The Swan.\" What caused\r\nLangley to adopt this name we do not know;[244] but we may suppose\r\nthat it was suggested to him by the large number of swans which\r\nbeautified the Thames. Foreigners on their first visit to London were\r\nusually very much impressed by the number and the beauty of these\r\nbirds. Hentzner, in 1598, stated that the river \"abounds in swans,\r\nswimming in flocks; the sight of them and their noise is vastly\r\nagreeable to the boats that meet them in their course\"; and the\r\nItalian Francesco Ferretti observed that the \"broad river of Thames\"\r\nwas \"most charming, and quite full of swans white as the very\r\nsnow.\"[245]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: The swan was not uncommon as a sign, especially along\r\nthe river; for example, it was the sign of one of the famous brothels\r\non the Bankside, as Stow informs us.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: Quoted in Rye, _England as Seen by Foreigners_, p.\r\n183.]\r\n\r\nFrom a map of the Manor of Paris Garden carefully surveyed by order of\r\nthe King in 1627[246] (see page 163), we learn the exact situation of\r\nthe building. It was set twenty-six poles, or four hundred and\r\ntwenty-six feet, from the bank of the river, in that corner of the\r\nestate nearest London Bridge. Most of the playgoers from London,\r\nhowever, came not over the Bridge, but by water, landing at the Paris\r\nGarden Stairs, or at the near-by Falcon Stairs, and then walking the\r\nshort distance to the theatre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: Reproduced by Rendle, _The Bankside, Southwark, and the\r\nGlobe Playhouse_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWAN PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\n(From Visscher's _View of London_, 1616).]\r\n\r\nAn excellent picture of the exterior of the Swan is furnished by\r\nVisscher's _View of London_, 1616, (see page 165). From this, as well\r\nas from the survey of 1627 just mentioned, we discover that the\r\nbuilding was duodecahedral--at least on the outside, for the interior\r\nprobably was circular. At the time of its erection it was, so we are\r\ntold, \"the largest and the most magnificent playhouse\" in London. It\r\ncontained three galleries surrounding an open pit, with a stage\r\nprojecting into the pit; and probably it differed in no essential\r\nrespect from the playhouses already built. In one point, however, it\r\nmay have differed--although of this I cannot feel sure: it may have\r\nbeen provided with a stage that could be removed so as to allow the\r\nbuilding to be used on occasions for animal-baiting. The De Witt\r\ndrawing shows such a stage; and possibly Stow in his _Survey_ (1598)\r\ngives evidence that the Swan was in early times employed for\r\nbear-baiting:\r\n\r\n     And to begin at the west bank as afore, thus it followeth.\r\n     On this bank is the bear gardens, in number twain; to wit,\r\n     the old bear garden [i.e., the one built in 1583?] and the\r\n     new [i.e., the Swan?], places wherein be kept bears, bulls,\r\n     and other beasts, to be baited at stakes for pleasure; also\r\n     mastiffs to bait them in several kennels are there\r\n     nourished.[247]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: Stow's original manuscript (Harl. MSS., 544), quoted by\r\nCollier, _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), III, 96, note 3.\r\nThe text of the edition of 1598 differs very slightly.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, in 1613 Henslowe used the Swan as the model for the Hope, a\r\nbuilding designed for both acting and animal-baiting. It should be\r\nnoted, however, that in all documents the Swan is invariably referred\r\nto as a _playhouse_, and there is no evidence--beyond that cited\r\nabove--to indicate that the building was ever employed for the baiting\r\nof bears and bulls.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1596 a Dutch traveler named Johannes de Witt, a\r\npriest of St. Mary's in Utrecht, visited London, and saw, as one of\r\nthe most interesting sights of the city, a dramatic performance at the\r\nSwan. Later he communicated a description of the building to his\r\nfriend Arend van Buchell,[248] who recorded the description in his\r\ncommonplace-book, along with a crude and inexact drawing of the\r\ninterior (see page 169), showing the stage, the three galleries, and\r\nthe pit.[249] The description is headed: \"Ex Observationibus\r\nLondinensibus Johannis de Witt.\" After a brief notice of St. Paul's,\r\nand a briefer reference to Westminster Cathedral, the traveler begins\r\nto describe what obviously interested him far more. I give below a\r\ntranslation of that portion relating to the playhouses:\r\n\r\n     There are four amphitheatres in London [the Theatre,\r\n     Curtain, Rose, and Swan] of notable beauty, which from their\r\n     diverse signs bear diverse names. In each of them a\r\n     different play is daily exhibited to the populace. The two\r\n     more magnificent of these are situated to the southward\r\n     beyond the Thames, and from the signs suspended before them\r\n     are called the Rose and the Swan. The two others are outside\r\n     the city towards the north on the highway which issues\r\n     through the Episcopal Gate, called in the vernacular\r\n     Bishopgate.[250] There is also a fifth [the Bear Garden],\r\n     but of dissimilar structure, devoted to the baiting of\r\n     beasts, where are maintained in separate cages and\r\n     enclosures many bears and dogs of stupendous size, which are\r\n     kept for fighting, furnishing thereby a most delightful\r\n     spectacle to men. Of all the theatres,[251] however, the\r\n     largest and the most magnificent is that one of which the\r\n     sign is a swan, called in the vernacular the Swan\r\n     Theatre;[252] for it accommodates in its seats three\r\n     thousand persons, and is built of a mass of flint stones (of\r\n     which there is a prodigious supply in Britain),[253] and\r\n     supported by wooden columns painted in such excellent\r\n     imitation of marble that it is able to deceive even the most\r\n     cunning. Since its form resembles that of a Roman work, I\r\n     have made a sketch of it above.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: Apparently he allowed Van Buchell to transcribe the\r\ndescription and the rough pen-sketch from his notebook or traveler's\r\ndiary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: This interesting document was discovered by Dr. Karl T.\r\nGaedertz, and published in full in _Zur Kenntnis der altenglischen\r\nBühne_ (Bremen, 1888).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: \"Viâ quâ itur per Episcopalem portam vulgariter\r\nBiscopgate nuncupatam.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: \"Theatrorum.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: \"Id cuius intersignium est cygnus (vulgo te theatre off\r\nte cijn).\" Mr. Wallace proposes to emend the last clause to read: \"te\r\ntheatre off te cijn off te Swan,\" thus making \"cijn\" mean \"sign\"; but\r\nis not this Flemish, and does not \"cijn\" mean \"Swan\"?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: It is commonly thought that De Witt was wrong in\r\nstating that the Swan was built of flint stones. Possibly the plaster\r\nexterior deceived him; or possibly in his memory he confused this\r\ndetail of the building with the exterior of the church of St. Mary\r\nOveries, which was indeed built of \"a mass of flint stones.\" On the\r\nother hand, the long life of the building after it had ceased to be of\r\nuse might indicate that it was built of stones.]\r\n\r\nExactly when the Swan was opened to the public, or what troupes of\r\nactors first made use of it, we do not know. The visit of Johannes de\r\nWitt, however, shows that the playhouse was occupied in 1596; and this\r\nfact is confirmed by a statement in the lawsuit of Shaw _v._\r\nLangley.[254] We may reasonably suppose that not only in 1596, but\r\nalso in 1595 the building was used by the players.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Discovered by Mr. Wallace and printed in _Englische\r\nStudien_ (1911), XLIII, 340-95. These documents have done much to\r\nclear up the history of the Swan and the Rose in the year 1597.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAN PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\nSketched by Johannes de Witt in 1596.]\r\n\r\nOur definite history of the Swan, however, begins with 1597. In\r\nFebruary of that year eight distinguished actors, among whom were\r\nRobert Shaw, Richard Jones, Gabriel Spencer, William Bird, and\r\nThomas Downton, \"servants to the right honorable the Earl of\r\nPembroke,\" entered into negotiations with Langley, or, as the legal\r\ndocument puts it, \"fell into conference with the said Langley for and\r\nabout the hireing and taking a playhouse of the said Langley, situate\r\nin the old Paris Garden, in the Parish of St. Saviours, in the County\r\nof Surrey, commonly called and known by the name of the sign of the\r\nSwan.\" The result of this conference was that the members of\r\nPembroke's Company[255] became each severally bound for the sum of\r\n£100 to play at the Swan for one year, beginning on February 21, 1597.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: I cannot agree with Mr. Wallace that Langley induced\r\nthese players to desert Henslowe, secured for them the patronage of\r\nPembroke, and thus was himself responsible for the organization of the\r\nPembroke Company.]\r\n\r\nThis troupe contained some of the best actors in London; and Langley,\r\nin anticipation of a successful year, \"disbursed and laid out for\r\nmaking of the said house ready, and providing of apparel fit and\r\nnecessary for their playing, the sum of £300 and upwards.\" Since he\r\nwas at very little cost in making the Swan ready, \"for the said house\r\nwas then lately afore used to have plays in it,\" most of this sum went\r\nfor the purchase of \"sundry sort of rich attire and apparel for them\r\nto play withall.\"\r\n\r\nEverything seems to have gone well until near the end of July, when\r\nthe company presented _The Isle of Dogs_, a satirical play written in\r\npart by the \"young Juvenal\" of the age, Thomas Nashe, and in part by\r\ncertain \"inferior players,\" chief of whom seems to have been Ben\r\nJonson.[256] The play apparently attacked under a thin disguise some\r\npersons high in authority. The exact nature of the offense cannot now\r\nbe determined, but Nashe himself informs us that \"the troublesome stir\r\nwhich happened about it is a general rumour that hath filled all\r\nEngland,\"[257] and the Queen herself seems to have been greatly\r\nangered. On July 28, 1597, the Privy Council sent a letter to the\r\nJustices of Middlesex and of Surrey informing them that Her Majesty\r\n\"hath given direction that not only no plays shall be used within\r\nLondon or about the city or in any public place during this time of\r\nsummer, but that also those playhouses that are erected and built only\r\nfor such purposes shall be plucked down.\" Accordingly the Council\r\nordered the Justices to see to it that \"there be no more plays used in\r\nany public place within three miles of the city until Allhallows\r\n[i.e., November 1] next\"; and, furthermore, to send for the owners of\r\nthe various playhouses \"and enjoin them by vertue hereof forthwith to\r\npluck down quite the stages, galleries, and rooms that are made for\r\npeople to stand in, and so to deface the same as they may not be\r\nemployed again to such use.\"[258]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: For an account of _The Isle of Dogs_ see E.K. Chambers,\r\n_Modern Language Review_ (1909), IV, 407, 511; R.B. McKerrow, _The\r\nWorks of Thomas Nashe_, V, 29; and especially the important article by\r\nMr. Wallace in _Englische Studien_ already referred to.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: _Nashes Lenten Stuffe_ (1599), ed. McKerrow, III, 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVII, 313.\r\nPossibly the other public playhouses were suppressed along with the\r\nSwan in response to the petition presented to the Council on July 28,\r\n(i.e. on the same day) by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen requesting the\r\n\"final suppressing of the said stage plays, as well at the Theatre,\r\nCurtain, and Bankside as in all other places in and about the city.\"\r\nSee The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 78.]\r\n\r\nThe Council, however, did not stop with this. It ordered the arrest of\r\nthe authors of the play and also of the chief actors who took part in\r\nits performance. Nashe saved himself by precipitate flight, but his\r\nlodgings were searched and his private papers were turned over to the\r\nauthorities. Robert Shaw and Gabriel Spencer, as leaders of the\r\ntroupe, and Ben Jonson, as one of the \"inferior players\" who had a\r\npart in writing the play,[259] were thrown into prison. The rest of\r\nthe company hurried into the country, their speed being indicated by\r\nthe fact that we find them acting in Bristol before the end of July.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: In a marginal gloss to _Nashes Lenten Stuffe_ (1599),\r\ned. McKerrow, III, 154, Nashe says: \"I having begun but the induction\r\nand first act of it, the other four acts without my consent or the\r\nbest guess of my drift or scope, by the players were supplied, which\r\nbred both their trouble and mine too.\"]\r\n\r\nSome of these events are referred to in the following letter,\r\naddressed by the Privy Council \"to Richard Topclyfe, Thomas Fowler,\r\nand Richard Skevington, esquires, Doctor Fletcher, and Mr.\r\nWilbraham\":\r\n\r\n     Upon information given us of a lewd play that was played in\r\n     one of the playhouses on the Bankside, containing very\r\n     seditious and slanderous matter, we caused some of the\r\n     players [Robert Shaw, Gabriel Spencer, and Ben Jonson[260]]\r\n     to be apprehended and committed to prison, whereof one of\r\n     them [Ben Jonson] was not only an actor but a maker of part\r\n     of the said play. Forasmuch as it is thought meet that the\r\n     rest of the players or actors in that matter shall be\r\n     apprehended to receive such punishment as their lewd and\r\n     mutinous behaviour doth deserve, these shall be therefore to\r\n     require you to examine those of the players that are\r\n     committed (whose names are known to you, Mr. Topclyfe), what\r\n     is become of the rest of their fellows that either had their\r\n     parts in the devising of that seditious matter, or that were\r\n     actors or players in the same, what copies they have given\r\n     forth[261] of the said play, and to whom, and such other\r\n     points as you shall think meet to be demanded of them,\r\n     wherein you shall require them to deal truly, as they will\r\n     look to receive any favour. We pray you also to peruse such\r\n     papers as were found in Nashe his lodgings, which Ferrys, a\r\n     messenger of the Chamber, shall deliver unto you, and to\r\n     certify us the examinations you take.[262]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: The identity of the three players is revealed in an\r\norder of the Privy Council dated October 8, 1597: \"A warrant to the\r\nKeeper of the Marshalsea to release Gabriel Spencer and Robert Shaw,\r\nstage-players, out of prison, who were of late committed to his\r\ncustody. The like warrant for the releasing of Benjamin Jonson.\"\r\n(Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVIII, 33.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: Such a copy was formerly preserved in a volume of\r\nmiscellaneous manuscripts at Alnwick Castle, but has not come down to\r\nmodern times. See F.J. Burgoyne, _Northumberland Manuscripts_ (London,\r\n1904).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVII, 338.]\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate occurrence destroyed Langley's dream of a successful\r\nyear. It also destroyed the splendid Pembroke organization, for\r\nseveral of its chief members, even before the inhibition was raised,\r\njoined the Admiral's Men. On August 6 Richard Jones went to Henslowe\r\nand bound himself to play for two years at the Rose, and at the same\r\ntime he bound his friend Robert Shaw, who was still in prison; on\r\nAugust 10 William Bird came and made a similar agreement; on October 6\r\nThomas Downton did likewise. Their leader, Gabriel Spencer, also\r\nprobably had an understanding with Henslowe, although he signed no\r\nbond; and upon his release from the Marshalsea he joined his friends\r\nat the Rose.[263]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: Langley sued these actors on their bond to him of £100\r\nto play only at the Swan; see the documents printed by Mr. Wallace.\r\nBen Jonson also joined Henslowe's forces at the Rose, as did Anthony\r\nand Humphrey Jeffes, who were doubtless members of the Pembroke\r\nCompany.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Queen's anger was abating, and the trouble was\r\nblowing over. The order to pluck down all the public playhouses was\r\nnot taken seriously by the officers of the law, and Henslowe actually\r\nsecured permission to reopen the Rose on October 11. The inhibition\r\nitself expired on November 1, but the Swan was singled out for further\r\npunishment. The Privy Council ordered that henceforth license should\r\nbe granted to two companies only: namely, the Admiral's at the Rose,\r\nand the Chamberlain's at the Curtain. This meant, of course, the\r\nclosing of the Swan.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this order, however, the members of Pembroke's Company\r\nremaining after the chief actors had joined Henslowe, taking on\r\nrecruits and organizing themselves into a company, began to act at the\r\nSwan without a license. For some time they continued unmolested, but\r\nat last the two licensed companies called the attention of the Privy\r\nCouncil to the fact, and on February 19, 1598, the Council issued the\r\nfollowing order to the Master of the Revels and the Justices of both\r\nMiddlesex and Surrey:\r\n\r\n     Whereas license hath been granted unto two companies of\r\n     stage players retayned unto us, the Lord Admiral and Lord\r\n     Chamberlain ... and whereas there is also a third company\r\n     who of late (as we are informed) have by way of intrusion\r\n     used likewise to play ... we have therefore thought good to\r\n     require you upon receipt hereof to take order that the\r\n     aforesaid third company may be suppressed, and none suffered\r\n     hereafter to play but those two formerly named, belonging to\r\n     us, the Lord Admiral and Lord Chamberlain.[264]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXVIII, 327.]\r\n\r\nThus, after February 19, 1598, the Swan stood empty, so far as plays\r\nwere concerned, and we hear very little of it during the next few\r\nyears. Indeed, it never again assumed an important part in the history\r\nof the drama.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1598[265] it was used by Robert Wilson for a contest\r\nin extempore versification. Francis Meres, in his _Palladis Tamia_,\r\nwrites: \"And so is now our witty Wilson, who for learning and\r\nextemporall wit in this faculty is without compare or compeere, as, to\r\nhis great and eternal commendations, he manifested in his challenge at\r\nthe Swan on the Bankside.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: After the order of February 19, when the \"intruding\r\ncompany\" was driven out, and before September 7 when Meres's _Palladis\r\nTamia_ was entered in the Stationers' Registers.]\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1600, Peter Bromvill was licensed to use the Swan \"to show\r\nhis feats of activity at convenient times in that place without let or\r\ninterruption.\"[266] The Privy Council in issuing the license observed\r\nthat Bromvill \"hath been recommended unto Her Majesty from her good\r\nbrother the French King, and hath shewed some feats of great activity\r\nbefore Her Highness.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, XXX, 327.]\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1600, the Privy Council \"with one and full consent\"\r\nordered \"that there shall be about the city two houses, and no more,\r\nallowed to serve for the use of the common stage plays; of the which\r\nhouses, one [the Globe] shall be in Surrey ... and the other [the\r\nFortune] in Middlesex.\"[267] This order in effect merely confirmed the\r\norder of 1598 which limited the companies to two, the Admiral's and\r\nthe Chamberlain's.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: _Ibid._, 395.]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1601 Langley died; and in January, 1602, his widow, as\r\nadministratrix, sold the Manor of Paris Garden, including the Swan\r\nPlayhouse, to Hugh Browker, a prothonotary of the Court of Common\r\nPleas. The property remained in the possession of the Browker family\r\nuntil 1655.[268]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: For this and other details as to the subsequent history\r\nof the property see Wallace, _Englische Studien_, XLIII, 342; Rendle,\r\n_The Antiquarian Magazine_, VII, 207; and cf. the map on page 163.]\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1602, the building was the scene of the famous hoax\r\nknown as _England's Joy_, perpetrated upon the patriotic citizens of\r\nLondon by one Richard Vennar.[269] Vennar scattered hand-bills over\r\nthe city announcing that at the Swan Playhouse, on Saturday, November\r\n6, a company of \"gentlemen and gentlewomen of account\" would present\r\nwith unusual magnificence a play entitled _England's Joy_, celebrating\r\nQueen Elizabeth. It was proposed to show the coronation of Elizabeth,\r\nthe victory of the Armada, and various other events in the life of\r\n\"England's Joy,\" with the following conclusion: \"And so with music,\r\nboth with voice and instruments, she is taken up into heaven; when\r\npresently appears a throne of blessed souls; and beneath, under the\r\nstage, set forth with strange fire-works, diverse black and damned\r\nsouls, wonderfully described in their several torments.\"[270] The\r\nprice of admission to the performance was to be \"two shillings, or\r\neighteen pence at least.\" In spite of this unusually high price, an\r\nenormous audience, including a \"great store of good company and many\r\nnoblemen,\" passed into the building. Whereupon Vennar seized the money\r\npaid for admission, and showed his victims \"a fair pair of heels.\" The\r\nmembers of the audience, when they found themselves thus duped,\r\n\"revenged themselves upon the hangings, curtains, chairs, stools,\r\nwalls, and whatsoever came in their way, very outrageously, and made\r\ngreat spoil.\"[271]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: Many writers, including Mr. Wallace, have confused this\r\nRichard Vennar with William Fennor, who later challenged Kendall to a\r\ncontest of wit at the Fortune. For a correct account, see T.S. Graves,\r\n\"Tricks of Elizabethan Showmen\" (in _The South Atlantic Quarterly_,\r\nApril, 1915, XIV) and \"A Note on the Swan Theatre\" (in _Modern\r\nPhilology_, January, 1912, IX, 431).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: From the broadside printed in _The Harleian\r\nMiscellany_, X, 198. For a photographic facsimile, see Lawrence, _The\r\nElizabethan Playhouse_ (Second Series), p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: _Letters Written by John Chamberlain_, Camden Society\r\n(1861), p. 163; _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1601-1603_,\r\np. 264. See also Manningham's _Diary_, pp. 82, 93.]\r\n\r\nOn February 8, 1603, John Manningham recorded in his _Diary_: \"Turner\r\nand Dun, two famous fencers, playd their prizes this day at the\r\nBankside, but Turner at last run Dun so far in the brain at the eye,\r\nthat he fell down presently stone dead; a goodly sport in a Christian\r\nstate, to see one man kill another!\" The place where the contest was\r\nheld is not specifically mentioned, but in all probability it was the\r\nSwan.[272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: This seems to be the source of the statement by Mr.\r\nWallace (_Englische Studien_, XLIII, 388), quoting Rendle (_The\r\nAntiquarian Magazine_, VII, 210): \"In 1604, a man named Turner, in a\r\ncontest for a prize at the Swan, was killed by a thrust in the eye.\"\r\nRendle cites no authority for his statement.]\r\n\r\nFor the next eight years all is silence, but we may suppose that the\r\nbuilding was occasionally let for special entertainments such as those\r\njust enumerated.\r\n\r\nIn 1611 Henslowe undertook to manage the Lady Elizabeth's Men,\r\npromising among other things to furnish them with a suitable\r\nplayhouse. Having disposed of the Rose in 1605, he rented the Swan and\r\nestablished his company there. In 1613, however, he built the Hope,\r\nand transferred the Lady Elizabeth's Men thither.\r\n\r\nThe Swan seems thereafter to have been occupied for a time by Prince\r\nCharles's Men. But the history of this company and its intimate\r\nconnection with the Lady Elizabeth's Company is too vague to admit of\r\ndefinite conclusions. So far as we can judge, the Prince's Men\r\ncontinued at the Swan until 1615, when Henslowe transferred them to\r\nthe Hope.[273]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: These dates are in a measure verified by the records of\r\nthe Overseers of the Poor for the Liberty of Paris Garden, printed by\r\nMr. Wallace (_Englische Studien_, XLIII, 390, note 1). Mr. Wallace\r\nseems to labor under the impression that this chapter in the history\r\nof the Swan (1611-1615) was unknown before, but it was adequately\r\ntreated by Fleay and later by Mr. Greg.]\r\n\r\nAfter 1615 the Swan was deserted for five years so far as any records\r\nshow. But in 1621 the old playhouse seems to have been again used by\r\nthe actors. The Overseers of the Poor in the Liberty of Paris Garden\r\nrecord in their Account Book: \"Monday, April the 9th, 1621, received\r\nof the players £5 3_s._ 6_d._\"[274] From this it is evident that in\r\nthe spring of 1621 some company of players, the name of which has not\r\nyet been discovered, was occupying the Swan. Apparently, however, the\r\ncompany did not remain there long, for the Account Book records no\r\npayment the following year; nor, although it extends to the year 1671,\r\ndoes it again record any payments from actors at the Swan. There is,\r\nindeed, no evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic\r\nperformances after 1621.[275] In the map of 1627 it is represented as\r\nstill standing, but is labeled \"the _old_ playhouse,\" and is not even\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 390, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Rendle quotes a license of 1623 for \"T.B. and three\r\nassistants to make shows of Italian motions at the Princes Arms or the\r\nSwan.\" (_The Antiquarian Magazine_, 1885, VII, 211.) But this may be a\r\nreference to an inn rather than to the large playhouse.]\r\n\r\nFive years later it is referred to in Nicolas Goodman's _Holland's\r\nLeaguer_ (1632), a pamphlet celebrating one of the most notorious\r\nhouses of ill fame on the Bankside.[276] Dona Britannica Hollandia,\r\nthe proprietress of this house, is represented as having been much\r\npleased with its situation:\r\n\r\n     Especially, and above all the rest, she was most taken with\r\n     the report of three famous amphitheatres, which stood so\r\n     near situated that her eye might take view of them from the\r\n     lowest turret. One was the _Continent of the World_ [i.e.,\r\n     the Globe], because half the year a world of beauties and\r\n     brave spirits resorted unto it; the other was a building of\r\n     excellent _Hope_, and though wild beasts and gladiators did\r\n     most possess it, yet the gallants that came to behold those\r\n     combats, though they were of a mixt society, yet were many\r\n     noble worthies amongst them; the last which stood, and, as\r\n     it were, shak'd hands with this fortress, being in times\r\n     past as famous as any of the other, was now fallen to decay,\r\n     and like a dying _Swanne_, hanging down her head, seemed to\r\n     sing her own dirge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: What seems to be a picture of this famous house may be\r\nseen in Merian's _View of London_, 1638 (see opposite page 256), with\r\na turret, and standing just to the right of the Swan.]\r\n\r\nThis is the last that we hear of the playhouse, that was \"in times\r\npast as famous as any of the other.\" What finally became of the\r\nbuilding we do not know. It is not shown in Hollar's _View of London_,\r\nin 1647, and probably it had ceased to exist before the outbreak of\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BLACKFRIARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1596 Burbage's lease of the plot of ground on which he had erected\r\nthe Theatre was drawing to a close, and all his efforts at a renewal\r\nhad failed. The owner of the land, Gyles Alleyn, having, in spite of\r\nthe terms of the original contract, refused to extend the lease until\r\n1606, was craftily plotting for a substantial increase in the rental;\r\nmoreover, having become puritanical in his attitude towards the drama,\r\nhe was insisting that if the lease were renewed, the Theatre should be\r\nused as a playhouse for five years only, and then should either be\r\ntorn down, or be converted into tenements. Burbage tentatively agreed\r\nto pay the increased rental, but, of course, he could not possibly\r\nagree to the second demand; and when all negotiations on this point\r\nproved futile, he realized that he must do something at once to meet\r\nthe awkward situation.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty years that had elapsed since the erection of the Theatre\r\nand the Curtain in Holywell, the Bankside had been developed as a\r\ntheatrical district, and the Rose and the Swan, not to mention the\r\nBear Garden, had made the south side of the river the popular place\r\nfor entertainments. Naturally, therefore, any one contemplating the\r\nerection of a playhouse would immediately think of this locality.\r\nBurbage, however, was a man of ideas. He believed that he could\r\nimprove on the Bankside as a site for his theatre. He remembered how,\r\nat the outset of his career as a theatrical manager, he had had to\r\nface competition with Richard Farrant who had opened a small \"private\"\r\nplayhouse in Blackfriars. Although that building had not been used as\r\na \"public\" playhouse, and had been closed up after a few years of sore\r\ntribulation, it had revealed to Burbage the possibilities of the\r\nBlackfriars precinct for theatrical purposes. In the first place, the\r\nprecinct was not under the jurisdiction of the city, so that actors\r\nwould not there be subject to the interference of the Lord Mayor and\r\nhis Aldermen. As Stevens writes in his _History of Ancient Abbeys,\r\nMonasteries, etc._: \"All the inhabitants within it were subject to\r\nnone but the King ... neither the Mayor, nor the sheriffs, nor any\r\nother officers of the City of London had the least jurisdiction or\r\nauthority therein.\" Blackfriars, therefore, in this fundamental\r\nrespect, was just as desirable a location for theatres as was Holywell\r\nto the north of the city, or the Bankside to the south. In the second\r\nplace, Blackfriars had a decided advantage over those two suburban\r\nlocalities in that it was \"scituated in the bosome of the\r\nCittie,\"[277] near St. Paul's Cathedral, the centre of London life,\r\nand hence was readily accessible to playgoers, even during the\r\ndisagreeable winter season. In the third place, the locality was\r\ndistinctly fashionable. To give some notion of the character of its\r\ninhabitants, I record below the names of a few of those who lived in\r\nor near the conventual buildings at various times after the\r\ndissolution: George Brooke, Lord Cobham; William Brooke, Lord Cobham,\r\nLord Chamberlain of the Queen's Household; Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham,\r\nLord Warden of the Cinque Ports; Sir Thomas Cheney, Treasurer of the\r\nQueen's Household, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports; Henry Carey,\r\nLord Hunsdon, Lord Chamberlain of the Queen's Household; George Carey,\r\nLord Hunsdon, who as Lord Chamberlain was the patron of Shakespeare's\r\ntroupe; Sir Thomas Cawarden, Master of the Revels; Sir Henry\r\nJerningham, Fee Chamberlain to the Queen's Highness; Sir Willam More,\r\nChamberlain of the Exchequer; Lord Zanche; Sir John Portynary; Sir\r\nWilliam Kingston; Sir Francis Bryan; Sir John Cheeke; Sir George\r\nHarper; Sir Philip Hoby, Lady Anne Gray; Sir Robert Kyrkham; Lady\r\nPerrin; Sir Christopher More; Sir Henry Neville; Sir Thomas Saunders;\r\nSir Jerome Bowes; and Lady Jane Guildford.[278] Obviously the\r\nlocality was free from the odium which the public always associated\r\nwith Shoreditch and the Bankside, the recognized homes of the London\r\nstews.[279]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: The Petition of 1619, in The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: It is true that poor people also, feather-dealers and\r\nsuch-like, lived in certain parts of Blackfriars, but this, of course,\r\ndid not affect the reputation of the precinct as the residence of\r\nnoblemen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: In Samuel Rowlands's _Humors Looking Glass_ (1608), a\r\nrich country gull is represented as filling his pockets with money and\r\ncoming to London. Here a servant \"of the Newgate variety\" shows him\r\nthe sights of the city:\r\n\r\n     Brought him to the Bankside where bears do dwell,\r\n     And unto Shoreditch where the whores keep hell.]\r\n\r\nThus, a playhouse erected in the precinct of Blackfriars would escape\r\nall the grave disadvantages of situation which attached to the\r\nexisting playhouses in the suburbs, and, on the other hand, would gain\r\nseveral very important advantages.\r\n\r\nBurbage's originality, however, did not stop with the choice of\r\nBlackfriars as the site of his new theatre; he determined to improve\r\non the form of building as well. The open-air structure which he had\r\ndesigned in 1576, and which had since been copied in all public\r\ntheatres, had serious disadvantages in that it offered no protection\r\nfrom the weather. Burbage now resolved to provide a large \"public\"\r\nplayhouse, fully roofed in, with the entire audience and the actors\r\nprotected against the inclemency of the sky and the cold of winter. In\r\nshort, his dream was of a theatre centrally located, comfortably\r\nheated, and, for its age, luxuriously appointed.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic energy and courage he at once set about the task\r\nof realizing this dream. He found in the Blackfriars precinct a large\r\nbuilding which, he thought, would admirably serve his purpose. This\r\nbuilding was none other than the old Frater of the Monastery, a\r\nstructure one hundred and ten feet long and fifty-two feet wide, with\r\nstone walls three feet thick, and a flat roof covered with lead. From\r\nthe Loseley documents, which M. Feuillerat has placed at the disposal\r\nof scholars,[280] we are now able to reconstruct the old Frater\r\nbuilding, and to point out exactly that portion which was made into a\r\nplayhouse.[281]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: _Blackfriars Records_, in The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, (1913).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: For a reconstruction of the Priory buildings and\r\ngrounds, and for specific evidence of statements made in the following\r\nparagraphs, the reader is referred to J.Q. Adams, _The Conventual\r\nBuildings of Blackfriars, London_, in the University of North Carolina\r\n_Studies in Philology_, XIV, 64.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the dissolution, the top story consisted of a single\r\nlarge room known as the \"Upper Frater,\" and also as the \"Parliament\r\nChamber\" from the fact that the English Parliament met here on several\r\noccasions; here, also, was held the trial before Cardinals Campeggio\r\nand Wolsey for the divorce of the unhappy Queen Catherine and Henry\r\nVIII--a scene destined to be reënacted in the same building by\r\nShakespeare and his fellows many years later. In 1550 the room was\r\ngranted, with various other properties in Blackfriars, to Sir Thomas\r\nCawarden.[282]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, pp. 7, 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN ILLUSTRATING THE SECOND BLACKFRIARS PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe Playhouse was made by combining the Hall and the Parlor.]\r\n\r\nThe space below the Parliament Chamber was divided into three units.\r\nAt the northern end was a \"Hall\" extending the width of the building.\r\nIt is mentioned in the Survey[283] of 1548 as \"a Hall ... under the\r\nsaid Frater\"; and again in the side-note: \"Memorandum, my Lorde Warden\r\nclaimeth the said Hall.\" Just to the south of the Hall was a \"Parlor,\"\r\nor dining-chamber, \"where commonly the friars did use to break their\r\nfast.\" It is described in the Survey as being \"under the said Frater,\r\nof the same length and breadth.\" The room could not have been of the\r\n\"same length and breadth\" as the great Parliament Chamber, for not\r\nonly would such dimensions be absurd for an informal dining-room, but,\r\nas we are clearly told, the \"Infirmary\" was also under the Parliament\r\nChamber, and was approximately one-third the size of the latter.[284]\r\nAccordingly I have interpreted the phrase, \"of the same length and\r\nbreadth,\" to mean that the Parlor was square. When the room was sold\r\nto Burbage it was said to be fifty-two feet in length from north to\r\nsouth, which is exactly the breadth of the building from east to west.\r\nThe Parlor, as well as the Hall, was claimed by the Lord Warden; and\r\nboth were granted to Sir Thomas Cawarden in 1550.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, pp. 105-06.]\r\n\r\nSouth of the Parlor was the Infirmary, described as being \"at the\r\nwestern corner of the Inner Cloister\" (of which the Frater building\r\nconstituted the western side), as being under the Parliament Chamber,\r\nand as being approximately one-third the size of the Parliament\r\nChamber. The Infirmary seems to have been structurally distinct from\r\nthe Hall and Parlor.[285] It was three stories high, consisting of a\r\n\"room beneath the Fermary,\" the Infirmary itself, a \"room above the\r\nsame\";[286] while the Parliament Chamber, extending itself \"over the\r\nroom above the Fermary,\" constituted a fourth story. Furthermore, not\r\nonly was the Infirmary a structural unit distinct from the Hall and\r\nthe Parlor at the north, but it never belonged to Cawarden or More,\r\nand hence was not included in the sale to Burbage. It was granted in\r\n1545 to Lady Mary Kingston,[287] from whom it passed to her son, Sir\r\nHenry Jerningham, then to Anthony Kempe, who later sold it to Lord\r\nHunsdon;[288] and at the time the playhouse was built, the Infirmary\r\nwas still in the occupation of Hunsdon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: In all probability it was separated from the Hall and\r\nParlor by a passage leading through the Infirmary into the Inner\r\nCloister yard.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: One reason for the greater height may have been the\r\nslope of the ground towards the river; a second reason was the unusual\r\nheight of the Parlor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: _Ibid._, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of the Frater building, and extending westward,\r\nwas a narrow structure fifty feet in length, sixteen feet in breadth,\r\nand three stories in height, regarded as a \"part of the frater\r\nparcel.\" The middle story, which was on the same level with the\r\nParliament Chamber, was known as the \"Duchy Chamber,\" possibly because\r\nof its use in connection with the sittings of Parliament, or with the\r\nmeetings of the Privy Council there. The building was granted to\r\nCawarden in 1550.[289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, p. 8.]\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Cawarden all his Blackfriars holdings passed into\r\nthe possession of Sir William More. From More, in 1596, James Burbage\r\npurchased those sections of the Frater building which had originally\r\nbeen granted to Cawarden[290]--that is, all the Frater building except\r\nthe Infirmary--for the sum of £600, in modern valuation about\r\n$25,000.[291] Evidently he had profited by Farrant's experience with\r\nMore and by his own experience with Gyles Alleyn, and had determined\r\nto risk no more leases, but in the future to be his own landlord, cost\r\nwhat it might.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: For the deed of sale see _ibid._, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: It should be observed, however, that Burbage paid only\r\n£100 down, and that he immediately mortgaged the property for more\r\nthan £200. The playhouse was not free from debt until 1605. See\r\nWallace, _The First London Theatre_, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe properties which he thus secured were:\r\n\r\n(1) The Parliament Chamber, extending over the Hall, Parlor, and\r\nInfirmary. This great chamber, it will be recalled, had previously\r\nbeen divided by Cawarden into the Frith and Cheeke Lodgings;[292] but\r\nnow it was arranged as a single tenement of seven rooms, and was\r\noccupied by the eminent physician William de Lawne:[293] \"All those\r\nseven great upper rooms as they are now divided, being all upon one\r\nfloor, and sometime being one great and entire room, with the roof\r\nover the same, covered with lead.\" Up into this tenement led a special\r\npair of stairs which made it wholly independent of the rest of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: The northern section of the Cheeke Lodging (a portion\r\nof the old Buttery) which had constituted Farrant's private theatre,\r\nand which was no real part of the Frater building, had been converted\r\nby More into the Pipe Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: A prosperous physician. His son was one of the\r\nillustrious founders of the Society of Apothecaries, and one of its\r\nchief benefactors. His portrait may be seen to-day in Apothecaries'\r\nHall. See C.R.B. Barrett, _The History of the Society of Apothecaries\r\nof London_.]\r\n\r\n(2) The friar's \"Parlor,\" now made into a tenement occupied by Thomas\r\nBruskett, and called \"the Middle Rooms, or Middle Stories\"--possibly\r\nfrom the fact that it was the middle of three tenements, possibly from\r\nthe fact that having two cellars under its northern end it was the\r\nmiddle of three stories. It is described as being fifty-two feet in\r\nlength north and south, and thirty-seven feet in width. Why a strip of\r\nnine feet should have been detached on the eastern side is not clear;\r\nbut that this strip was also included in the sale to Burbage is shown\r\nby later documents.\r\n\r\n(3) The ancient \"Hall\" adjoining the \"Parlor\" on the north, and now\r\nmade into two rooms. These rooms were combined with the ground floor\r\nof the Duchy Chamber building to constitute a tenement occupied by\r\nPeter Johnson: \"All those two lower rooms now in the occupation of the\r\nsaid Peter Johnson, lying directly under part of the said seven great\r\nupper rooms.\" The dimensions are not given, but doubtless the two\r\nrooms together extended the entire width of the building and were\r\napproximately as broad as the Duchy Chamber building, with which they\r\nwere united.\r\n\r\n(4) The Duchy Chamber building \"at the north end of the said seven\r\ngreat upper rooms, and at the west side thereof.\" At the time of the\r\nsale the ground floor of this building was occupied by Peter Johnson,\r\nwho had also the Hall adjoining it on the west; the middle story was\r\noccupied by Charles Bradshaw; and the top story by Edward Merry.[294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: Mr. Wallace's description of the building and the way\r\nin which it was converted into a playhouse (_The Children of the\r\nChapel at Blackfriars_, pp. 37-41) is incorrect. For the various\r\ndetails cited above see the deed of sale to Burbage.]\r\n\r\nOut of this heterogeneous property Burbage was confronted with the\r\nproblem of making a playhouse. Apparently he regarded the Parliament\r\nChamber as too low, or too inaccessible for the purposes of a theatre;\r\nthis part of his property, therefore, he kept as a lodging, and for\r\nmany years it served as a dormitory for the child-actors. The Duchy\r\nChamber building, being small and detached from the Frater building,\r\nhe reserved also as a lodging.[295] In the Hall and the Parlor,\r\nhowever, he saw the possibility of a satisfactory auditorium. Let us\r\ntherefore examine this section of the Frater building more in detail,\r\nand trace its history up to the time of the purchase.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: This may have contained the two rooms in which Evans\r\nlived, and \"the schoolhouse and the chamber over the same,\" which are\r\ndescribed (see the documents in Fleay's _A Chronicle History of the\r\nLondon Stage_, p. 210 ff.) as being \"severed from the said great\r\nhall.\" In another document this schoolhouse is described as \"schola,\r\nanglice _schoolhouse_, ad borealem finem Aulæ prædictæ.\" (Wallace,\r\n_The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, p. 40.)]\r\n\r\nThe Parlor was described as \"a great room, paved,\" and was said to\r\nhave been \"used and occupied by the friars themselves to their own\r\nproper use as a parlor to dine and sup in.\"[296] Sir John Portynary,\r\nwhose house adjoined the Duchy Chamber, tells us that in 1550, when\r\nKing Edward granted the Blackfriars property to Cawarden, \"Sir Thomas\r\nCawarden, knight, entered into the same house in the name of all that\r\nwhich the King had given him within the said friars, and made his\r\nlodging there; and about that time did invite this examinant and his\r\nwife to supper there, together with diverse other gentlemen; and they\r\nall supped together with the said Sir Thomas Cawarden, in the same\r\nroom [the Parlor] where the said school of fence is now kept, and did\r\nthere see a play.\"[297]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, pp. 43, 47, 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: _Ibid._, p. 52.]\r\n\r\nLater Cawarden leased the Parlor to a keeper of an ordinary: \"One\r\nWoodman did hold the said house where the said school of fence is\r\nkept, and another house thereby of Sir Thomas Cawarden, and in the\r\nother room kept an ordinary table, and had his way to the same through\r\nthe said house where the said school of fence is kept.\"[298]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: _Ibid._, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nIn 1563 William Joyner established in the rooms the school of fence\r\nmentioned above, which was still flourishing in 1576.[299]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: Feuillerat, _Blackfriars Records_, p. 121.]\r\n\r\nWhen in 1583 John Lyly became interested in the First Blackfriars\r\nPlayhouse, he obtained a lease of the rooms, but it is not clear for\r\nwhat purpose. Later he sold the lease to Rocho Bonetti, the Italian\r\nfencing-master, who established there his famous school of fence.[300]\r\nIn George Silver's _Paradoxes of Defence_, 1599, is a description of\r\nBonetti's school, which will, I think, help us to reconstruct in our\r\nimagination the \"great room, paved\" which was destined to become\r\nShakespeare's playhouse:\r\n\r\n     He caused to be fairely drawne and set round about the\r\n     schoole all the Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Armes that were\r\n     his schollers, and, hanging right under their Armes, their\r\n     Rapiers, Daggers, Gloves of Male, and Gantlets. Also he had\r\n     benches and stooles, the roome being verie large, for\r\n     Gentlemen to sit about his schoole to behold his teaching.\r\n\r\n     He taught none commonly under twentie, fortie, fifty, or an\r\n     hundred pounds. And because all things should be verie\r\n     necessary for the Noblemen and Gentlemen, he had in his\r\n     schoole a large square table, with a green carpet, done\r\n     round with a verie brode rich fringe of gold; alwaies\r\n     standing upon it a verie faire standish covered with crimson\r\n     velvet, with inke, pens, pen-dust, and sealing-waxe, and\r\n     quiers of verie excellent fine paper, gilded, readie for the\r\n     Noblemen and Gentlemen (upon occasion) to write their\r\n     letters, being then desirous to follow their fight, to send\r\n     their men to dispatch their businesse.\r\n\r\n     And to know how the time passed, he had in one corner of his\r\n     Schoole, a Clocke, with a verie faire large diall; he had\r\n     within that Schoole a roome the which he called his privie\r\n     schoole, with manie weapons therein, where he did teach his\r\n     schollers his secret fight, after he had perfectly taught\r\n     them their rules. He was verie much loved in the Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: _Ibid._, p. 122.]\r\n\r\nWe are further told by Silver that Bonetti took it upon himself \"to\r\nhit anie Englishman with a thrust upon anie button.\" It is no wonder\r\nthat Shakespeare ridiculed him in _Romeo and Juliet_ as \"the very\r\nbutcher of a silk button,\" and laughed at his school and his fantastic\r\nfencing-terms:\r\n\r\n     _Mercutio._ Ah! the immortal \"passado\"! the \"punto reverso\"!\r\n     the \"hay\"!\r\n\r\n     _Benvolio._ The what?\r\n\r\n     _Mercutio._ The pox of such antick, lisping, affecting\r\n     fantasticoes! These new tuners of accents!--\"By Jesu, a very\r\n     good blade!\"\r\n\r\nAt the date of the sale to Burbage, February 4, 1596, the fencing\r\nschool of Bonetti, had become \"those rooms and lodgings, with the\r\nkitchen thereunto adjoining, called the Middle Rooms or Middle\r\nStories, late being in the tenure or occupation of Rocco Bonetti, and\r\nnow being in the tenure or occupation of Thomas Bruskett, gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nTo make his playhouse Burbage removed all the partitions in the Middle\r\nRooms, and restored the Parlor to its original form--a great room\r\ncovering the entire breadth of the building, and extending fifty-two\r\nfeet in length from north to south. To this he added the Hall at the\r\nnorth, which then existed as two rooms in the occupation of Peter\r\nJohnson. The Hall and Parlor when combined made an auditorium\r\ndescribed as \"per estimacionem in longitudine ab australe ad borealem\r\npartem eiusdem sexaginta et sex pedes assissæ sit plus sive minus, et\r\nin latitudine ab occidentale ad orientalem partem eiusdem quadraginto\r\net sex pedes assissæ sit plus sive minus.\"[301] The forty-six feet of\r\nwidth corresponds to the interior width of the Frater building, for\r\nalthough it was fifty-two feet wide in outside measurement, the stone\r\nwalls were three feet thick. The sixty-six feet of length probably\r\nrepresents the fifty-two feet of the Parlor plus the breadth of the\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: Wallace, _The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_,\r\np. 39, note 1.]\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of these two rooms must have been of unusual height. The\r\nInfirmary, which was below the Parliament Chamber at the south, was\r\nthree stories high; and the windows of the Parlor, if we may believe\r\nPierce the Ploughman, were \"wrought as a chirche\":\r\n\r\n     An halle for an heygh kinge · an household to holden,\r\n     With brode bordes abouten · y-benched well clene,\r\n     With windowes of glas · wrought as a chirche.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF BLACKFRIARS\r\n\r\nThis remnant of the old monastery was discovered in 1872 on the\r\nrebuilding of the offices of _The Times_. It illustrates the\r\nsubstantial character of the Blackfriars buildings, and may even be a\r\npart of the old Frater, for _The Times_ occupies that portion of the\r\nmonastery. The windows of the Frater, according to Pierce the\r\nPloughman, were \"wrought as a chirche.\" (From a painting in the\r\nGuildhall Museum.)]\r\n\r\nAs a result Burbage was able to construct within the auditorium at\r\nleast two galleries,[302] after the manner of the public theatres.\r\nThe Parliament Chamber above was kept, as I have stated, for\r\nresidential purposes. This is why the various legal documents almost\r\ninvariably refer to the playhouse as \"that great hall or room, with\r\nthe rooms over the same.\"[303]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: Mr. Wallace, _The Children of the Chapel at\r\nBlackfriars_, p. 42, quotes from the Epilogue to Marston's _The Dutch\r\nCourtesan_, acted at Blackfriars, \"And now, my fine Heliconian\r\ngallants, and you, my worshipful friends in the middle region,\" and\r\nadds that the \"reference to 'the middle region' makes it clear there\r\nwere three\" galleries. Does it not, however, indicate that there were\r\nonly two galleries?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: See the documents printed in Fleay's _A Chronicle\r\nHistory of the London Stage_, pp. 211, 215, 240, etc. Mr. Wallace,\r\nhowever (_The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, p. 40 ff.),\r\nwould have us believe that an additional story was added: \"the roof\r\nwas changed, and rooms, probably of the usual dormer sort, were built\r\nabove.\" I am quite sure he is mistaken.]\r\n\r\nThe main entrance to the playhouse was at the north, over the \"great\r\nyard\" which extended from the Pipe Office to Water Lane.[304] The\r\nstage was opposite this entrance, or at the southern end of the hall,\r\nas is shown by one of the documents printed by Mr. Wallace.[305] Since\r\nthe building was not, like the other playhouses of London, open to the\r\nsky, the illumination was supplied by candles, hung in branches over\r\nthe stage; as Gerschow noted, after visiting Blackfriars, \"alle bey\r\nLichte agiret, welches ein gross Ansehen macht.\"[306] The obvious\r\nadvantage of artificial light for producing beautiful stage effects\r\nmust have added not a little to the popularity of the Blackfriars\r\nPlayhouse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: Cf. Playhouse Yard in the London of to-day.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: _The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, p. 43,\r\nnote 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: _The Diary of the Duke of Stettin-Pomerania_, in\r\n_Transactions of the Royal Historical Society_ (1892), VI, 26.]\r\n\r\nThe cost of all the alterations and the equipment could hardly have\r\nbeen less than £300, so that the total cost of the property was at\r\nleast £900, or in modern valuation approximately $35,000. Burbage's\r\nsons, in referring to the building years later, declared that their\r\nfather had \"made it into a playhouse with great charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" they added significantly, \"with great trouble.\" The\r\naristocratic inhabitants of the Blackfriars precinct did not welcome\r\nthe appearance in their midst of a \"public,\" or, as some more\r\nscornfully designated it, a \"common,\" playhouse; and when they\r\ndiscovered the intentions of Burbage, they wrote a strong petition to\r\nthe Privy Council against the undertaking. This petition, presented to\r\nthe Council in November, 1596, I quote below in part:\r\n\r\n     To the right honorable the Lords and others of Her Majesty's\r\n     most honorable Privy Council.--Humbly shewing and beseeching\r\n     your honors, the inhabitants of the precinct of the\r\n     Blackfriars, London, that whereas one Burbage hath lately\r\n     bought certain rooms in the same precinct near adjoining\r\n     unto the dwelling houses of the right honorable the Lord\r\n     Chamberlaine [Lord Cobham] and the Lord of Hunsdon, which\r\n     rooms the said Burbage is now altering, and meaneth very\r\n     shortly to convert and turn the same into a common\r\n     playhouse, which will grow to be a very great annoyance and\r\n     trouble, not only to all the noblemen and gentlemen\r\n     thereabout inhabiting, but also a general inconvenience to\r\n     all the inhabitants of the same precinct, both by reason of\r\n     the great resort and gathering together of all manner of\r\n     vagrant and lewd persons ... as also for that there hath not\r\n     at any time heretofore been used any common playhouse within\r\n     the same precinct, but that now all players being banished\r\n     by the Lord Mayor from playing within the city ... they now\r\n     think to plant themselves in liberties, etc.[307]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: For the full document see Halliwell-Phillipps,\r\n_Outlines_, I, 304. For the date, see The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 91.]\r\n\r\nThe first person to sign the petition was the Dowager Lady Elizabeth\r\nRussell; the second was none other than George Cary, Lord Hunsdon, at\r\nthe time the patron of Burbage's company of actors.[308] It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that as a result of this petition the Lords of\r\nthe Privy Council (of which Lord Cobham was a conspicuous member)\r\nissued an order in which they \"forbad the use of the said house for\r\nplays.\"[309] This order wrecked the plans of Burbage quite as\r\neffectively as did the stubbornness of Gyles Alleyn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: Shortly after this he was appointed Lord Chamberlain,\r\nunder which name his troupe was subsequently known.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: Petition of 1619, The Malone Society's _Collections_,\r\nI, 91.]\r\n\r\nPossibly the mental distress Burbage suffered at the hands of the\r\nPrivy Council and of Gyles Alleyn affected his health; at least he did\r\nnot long survive this last sling of fortune. In February, 1597, just\r\nbefore the expiration of the Alleyn lease, he died, leaving the\r\nTheatre to his son Cuthbert, the bookseller, Blackfriars to his\r\nactor-son, Richard, the star of Shakespeare's troupe, and his troubles\r\nto both. With good reason Cuthbert declared many years later that the\r\nultimate success of London theatres had \"been purchased by the\r\ninfinite cost and pains of the family of Burbages.\"\r\n\r\nWhen later in 1597 the Lord Chamberlain's Players were forced to leave\r\nCuthbert's Theatre, Richard Burbage was not able to establish them in\r\nhis comfortable Blackfriars house; instead, they first went to the old\r\nCurtain in Shoreditch, and then, under the leadership of the Burbage\r\nsons, erected for themselves a brand-new home on the Bankside, called\r\n\"The Globe.\"\r\n\r\nThe order of the Privy Council had summarily forbidden the use of\r\nBlackfriars as a \"public\" playhouse. Its proprietor, however, Richard\r\nBurbage, might take advantage of the precedent established in the days\r\nof Farrant, and let the building for use as a \"private\" theatre.[310]\r\nExactly when he was first able to lease the building as a \"private\"\r\nhouse we do not know, for the history of the building between 1597\r\n(when it was completed) and 1600 (when it was certainly occupied by\r\nthe Children of the Chapel) is very indistinct. We have no definite\r\nevidence to connect the Chapel Children, or, indeed, any specific\r\ntroupe, with Blackfriars during these years. Yet prior to 1600 the\r\nbuilding seems to have been used for acting. Richard Burbage himself\r\nseems to say so. In leasing the building to Evans, in 1600, he says\r\nthat he considered \"with himself that\" Evans could not pay the rent\r\n\"except the said Evans could erect and keep a company of playing-boys\r\nor others to play plays and interludes in the said playhouse in such\r\nsort _as before time had been there used_.\"[311] Now, unless this\r\nrefers to Farrant's management of the Chapel Boys in Blackfriars--nearly\r\na quarter of a century earlier--it means that before 1600 some actors,\r\npresumably \"playing-boys,\" had used Burbage's theatre. Moreover, there\r\nseems to be evidence to show that the troupe thus vaguely referred to\r\nwas under the management of Evans; for, in referring to his lease of\r\nBlackfriars in 1600, Evans describes the playhouse as \"then or late in\r\nthe tenure or occupation of your said oratour.\"[312] What these vague\r\nreferences mean we cannot now with our limited knowledge determine.\r\nBut there is not sufficient evidence to warrant the usual assumption\r\nthat Evans and Giles had opened the Blackfriars with the Children of\r\nthe Chapel in 1597.[313]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: The constables and other officers in the Petition of\r\n1619 say: \"The owner of the said playhouse, doth under the name of a\r\nprivate house ... convert the said house to a public playhouse.\" (The\r\nMalone Society's _Collections_, I, 91.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: Fleay, _A Chronicle History of the London Stage_, p.\r\n234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: _Ibid._, p. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: This theory has been urged by Fleay, by Mr. Wallace in\r\n_The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, and by others.]\r\n\r\nThe known history of Blackfriars as a regular theatre may be said to\r\nbegin in the autumn of 1600. On September 2 of that year, Henry Evans\r\nsigned a lease of the playhouse for a period of twenty-one years, at\r\nan annual rental of £40. This interesting step on the part of Evans\r\ncalls for a word of explanation as to his plans.\r\n\r\nThe Children of the Chapel Royal, who had attained such glory at\r\nBlackfriars during the Farrant-Hunnis-Evans-Oxford-Lyly régime, had\r\nthereafter sunk into dramatic insignificance. Since 1584, when Lyly\r\nwas forced to give up his playhouse, they had not presented a play at\r\nCourt. Probably they did not entirely cease to act, for they can be\r\nvaguely traced in the provinces during a part of this period; but\r\ntheir dramatic glory was almost wholly eclipsed. Evans, who had\r\nmanaged the Boys under Hunnis, Oxford, and Lyly, hoped now to\r\nreëstablish the Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars as they had been\r\nin his younger days. Like James Burbage, he was a man of ideas. His\r\nplan was to interest in his undertaking the Master of the Chapel,\r\nNathaniel Giles, who had succeeded to the office at the death of\r\nHunnis in 1597, and then to make practical use of the patent granted\r\nto the Masters of the Children to take up boys for Her Majesty's\r\nservice. Such a patent, in the normal course of events, had been\r\ngranted to Giles, as it had been to his predecessors. It read in part\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth, by the grace of God, &c., to all mayors,\r\n     sheriffs, bailiffs, constables, and all other our officers,\r\n     greeting. For that it is meet that our Chapel Royal should\r\n     be furnished with well-singing children from time to time,\r\n     we have, and by these presents do authorize our\r\n     well-beloved servant, Nathaniel Giles, Master of our\r\n     Children of our said Chapel, or his deputy, being by his\r\n     bill subscribed and sealed, so authorized, and having this\r\n     our present commission with him, to take such and so many\r\n     children as he, or his sufficient deputy, shall think meet,\r\n     in all cathedral, collegiate, parish churches, chapels, or\r\n     any other place or places, as well within liberty as\r\n     without, within this our realm of England, whatsoever they\r\n     be.[314]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: The full commission is printed in Wallace, _The\r\nChildren of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nIn such a commission Evans saw wonderful possibilities. He reasoned\r\nthat since the Queen had forced upon the Chapel Children the twofold\r\nservice of singing at royal worship and of acting plays for royal\r\nentertainment, this twofold service should be met by a twofold\r\norganization, the one part designed mainly to furnish sacred music,\r\nthe other designed mainly to furnish plays. Such a dual organization,\r\nit seemed to him, was now more or less necessary, since the number of\r\nboy choristers in the Chapel Royal was limited to twelve, whereas the\r\nacting of plays demanded at least twice as many. Once the principle\r\nthat the Chapel Royal should supply the Queen with plays was granted,\r\nthe commission could be used to furnish the necessary actors; and the\r\nold fiction, established by Farrant and Hunnis, of using a \"private\"\r\nplayhouse as a means of exercising or training the boys for Court\r\nservice, would enable the promoters to give public performances and\r\nthus handsomely reimburse themselves for their trouble.\r\n\r\nSuch was Evans's scheme, based upon his former experience with the\r\nChildren at Farrant's Blackfriars, and suggested, perhaps, by the\r\nexistence of Burbage's Blackfriars now forbidden to the \"common\"\r\nplayers. He presented his scheme to Giles, the Master of the Children;\r\nand Giles, no doubt, presented it at Court; for he would hardly dare\r\nthus abuse the Queen's commission, or thus make a public spectacle of\r\nthe royal choristers, without in some way first consulting Her\r\nMajesty, and securing at least her tacit consent. That Giles and Evans\r\ndid secure royal permission to put their scheme into operation is\r\ncertain, although the exact nature of this permission is not clear.\r\nLater, for misdemeanors on the part of the management, the Star\r\nChamber ordered \"that all assurances made to the said Evans concerning\r\nthe said house, or plays, or interludes, should be utterly void, and\r\nto be delivered up to be cancelled.\"[315]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: Fleay, _A Chronicle History of the London Stage_, p.\r\n248.]\r\n\r\nArmed with these written \"assurances,\" and with the royal commission\r\nto take up children, Evans and Giles began to form their company. This\r\nexplains the language used by Heminges and Burbage: \"let the said\r\nplayhouse unto Henry Evans ... who intended then presently to erect or\r\nset up a company of boys.\"[316] Their method of recruiting players\r\nmay best be told by Henry Clifton, in his complaint to the Queen:\r\n\r\n     But so it is, most excellent Sovereign, that the said\r\n     Nathaniel Giles, confederating himself with one James\r\n     Robinson, Henry Evans, and others,[317] yet unto Your\r\n     Majesty's said subject unknown how [many], by color of Your\r\n     Majesty's said letters patents, and the trust by Your\r\n     Highness thereby to him, the said Nathaniel Giles,\r\n     committed, endeavoring, conspiring, and complotting how to\r\n     oppress diverse of Your Majesty's humble and faithful\r\n     subjects, and thereby to make unto themselves an unlawful\r\n     gain and benefit, they, the said confederates, devised,\r\n     conspired, and concluded, for their own corrupt gain and\r\n     lucre, to erect, set up, furnish, and maintain a playhouse,\r\n     or place in the Blackfriars, within Your Majesty's city of\r\n     London; and to the end they might the better furnish their\r\n     said plays and interludes with children, whom they thought\r\n     most fittest to act and furnish the said plays, they, the\r\n     said confederates, abusing the authority and trust by Your\r\n     Highness to him, the said Nathaniel Giles, and his deputy or\r\n     deputies, by Your Highness's said letters patents given and\r\n     reposed, hath, sithence Your Majesty's last free and general\r\n     pardon, most wrongfully, unduly, and unjustly taken diverse\r\n     and several children from diverse and sundry schools of\r\n     learning and other places, and apprentices to men of trade\r\n     from their masters, no way fitting for Your Majesty's\r\n     service in or for your Chapel Royal, but the children have\r\n     so taken and employed in acting and furnishing of the said\r\n     plays and interludes, so by them complotted and agreed to\r\n     be erected, furnished, and maintained, against the wills of\r\n     the said children, their parents, tutors, masters, and\r\n     governors, and to the no small grief and oppressions [of]\r\n     Your Majesty's true and faithful subjects. Amongst which\r\n     numbers, so by the persons aforesaid and their agents so\r\n     unjustly taken, used and employed, they have unduly taken\r\n     and so employed one John Chappell, a grammar school scholar\r\n     of one Mr. Spykes School near Cripplegate, London; John\r\n     Motteram, a grammar scholar in the free school at\r\n     Westminster; Nathaniel Field, a scholar of a grammar school\r\n     in London kept by one Mr. Monkaster;[318] Alvery Trussell,\r\n     an apprentice to one Thomas Gyles; one Phillipp Pykman and\r\n     [one] Thomas Grymes, apprentices to Richard and George\r\n     Chambers; Salmon Pavy,[319] apprentice to one Peerce; being\r\n     children no way able or fit for singing, nor by any the said\r\n     confederates endeavoured to be taught to sing, but by them,\r\n     the said confederates, abusively employed, as aforesaid,\r\n     only in plays and interludes.[320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: _Ibid._, p. 234. Note that Evans is not to \"continue\" a\r\ntroupe there, as Fleay and Wallace believe, but to \"erect\" one.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: Possibly Robinson and the \"others\" were merely\r\ndeputies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: Field became later famous both as an actor and\r\nplaywright. His portrait is preserved at Dulwich College.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: Salathiel Pavy, whose excellent acting is celebrated in\r\nJonson's tender elegy, quoted in part below.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: Star Chamber Proceedings, printed in full by Fleay,\r\n_op. cit._, p. 127.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the obvious animosity inspiring Clifton's words, we get\r\nfrom his complaint a clear notion of how Evans and Giles supplemented\r\nthe Children of the Chapel proper with actors. In a short time they\r\nbrought together at Blackfriars a remarkable troupe of boy-players,\r\nwho, with Jonson and Chapman as their poets, began to astonish London.\r\nFor, in spite of certain limitations, \"the children\" could act with a\r\ncharm and a grace that often made them more attractive than their\r\ngrown-up rivals. Middleton advises the London gallant \"to call in at\r\nthe Blackfriars, where he should see a nest of boys able to ravish a\r\nman.\"[321] Jonson gives eloquent testimony to the power of little\r\nSalathiel Pavy to portray the character of old age:\r\n\r\n     Years he numbered scarce thirteen\r\n       When Fates turned cruel,\r\n     Yet three filled zodiacs had he been\r\n       The stage's jewel;\r\n     And did act, what now we moan,\r\n       Old men so duly,\r\n     As, sooth, the Parcae thought him one,\r\n       He played so truly.[322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: _Father Hubbard's Tales_ (ed. Bullen, VIII, 77).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: Jonson, _Epigrams_, CXX, _An Epitaph on Salathiel Pavy,\r\na Child of Queen Elizabeth's Chapel_.]\r\n\r\nAnd Samuel Pepys records the effectiveness of a child-actor in the\r\nrôle of women: \"One Kinaston, a boy, acted the Duke's sister, but made\r\nthe loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life.\"[323]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: _Diary_, August 18, 1660.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, to expert acting these Boys of the Chapel Royal added the\r\ncharms of vocal and instrumental music, for which many of them had\r\nbeen specially trained. The Duke of Stettin-Pomerania, who upon his\r\ngrand tour of the European countries in 1602 attended a play at\r\nBlackfriars, bears eloquent testimony to the musical powers of the\r\nchildren: \"For a whole hour before the play begins, one listens to\r\ncharming [_köstliche_] instrumental music played on organs, lutes,\r\npandorins, mandolins, violins, and flutes; as, indeed, on this\r\noccasion, a boy sang _cum voce tremula_ to the accompaniment of a\r\nbass-viol, so delightfully [_lieblich_] that, if the Nuns at Milan did\r\nnot excel him, we had not heard his equal in our travels.\"[324] In\r\naddition, the Children were provided with splendid apparel--though not\r\nat the cost of the Queen, as Mr. Wallace contends.[325] Naturally they\r\nbecame popular. On January 6, 1601, they were summoned to Court to\r\nentertain Her Majesty--the first recorded performance of the Children\r\nof the Chapel at Court since the year 1584, when Sir William More\r\nclosed the first Blackfriars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: _The Diary of the Duke of Stettin-Pomerania_, printed\r\nin _Transactions of the Royal Historical Society_ (1890). The diary\r\nwas written by the Duke's tutor, Gerschow, at the express command of\r\nthe Duke.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: It is hard to believe Mr. Wallace's novel theory that\r\nthe Children of the Chapel were subsidized by Elizabeth, as presented\r\nin his otherwise valuable _The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_.\r\nBurbage and Heminges knew nothing of such a royal patronage at\r\nBlackfriars (see Fleay, _op. cit._, p. 236), nor did Kirkham, the\r\nYeoman of the Revels (_ibid._, p. 248). Kirkham and his partners spent\r\n£600 on apparel, etc., according to Kirkham's statement.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting testimony to the success of the Chapel\r\nChildren in their new playhouse is that uttered by Shakespeare in\r\n_Hamlet_ (1601), in which he speaks of the performances by the \"little\r\neyases\" as a \"late innovation.\" The success of the \"innovation\" had\r\ndriven Shakespeare and his troupe of grown-up actors to close the\r\nGlobe and travel in the country, even though they had _Hamlet_ as an\r\nattraction. The good-natured way in which Shakespeare treats the\r\nsituation is worthy of special observation:\r\n\r\n     _Ham._ What players are they?\r\n\r\n     _Ros._ Even those you were wont to take delight in, the\r\n     tragedians of the city.[326]\r\n\r\n     _Ham._ How chances it they travel? their residence, both in\r\n     reputation and profit, was better both ways.[327]\r\n\r\n     _Ros._ I think their inhibition comes by means of the late\r\n     innovation.\r\n\r\n     _Ham._ Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was\r\n     in the city? are they so followed?\r\n\r\n     _Ros._ No, indeed, they are not!\r\n\r\n     _Ham._ How comes it? do they grow rusty?\r\n\r\n     _Ros._ Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but\r\n     there is, sir, an aerie of children,[328] little eyases,\r\n     that cry out on the top of question, and are most\r\n     tyrannically clapped for 't. These are now the fashion, and\r\n     so berattle the \"common stages\"--so they call them--that\r\n     many wearing rapiers [i.e., gallants] are afraid of\r\n     goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.\r\n\r\n     _Ham._ What! are they children? who maintains 'em? how are\r\n     they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than\r\n     they can sing?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: The Children were acting light comedies such as\r\n_Cynthia's Revels_; the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting _Hamlet_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: Shakespeare's troupe is known to have been traveling in\r\nthe spring of 1601.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: Cf. Middleton's _Father Hubbard's Tales_, already\r\nquoted, \"a nest of boys.\" Possibly the idea was suggested by the fact\r\nthat the children were lodged and fed in the building.]\r\n\r\nThe passage ends with the question from Hamlet: \"Do the boys carry it\r\naway?\" which gives Rosencrantz an opportunity to pun on the sign of\r\nthe Globe Playhouse: \"Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his\r\nload, too.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the great dramatist had penned these words, the\r\nmanagement of Blackfriars met with disaster. The cause, however, went\r\nback to December 13, 1600, when Giles and Evans were gathering their\r\nplayers. In their overweening confidence they made a stupid blunder in\r\n\"taking up\" for their troupe the only son and heir of Henry Clifton, a\r\nwell-to-do gentleman of Norfolk, who had come to London for the\r\npurpose of educating the boy. Clifton says in his complaint that\r\nGiles, Evans, and their confederates, \"well knowing that your\r\nsubject's said son had no manner of sight in song, nor skill in\r\nmusic,\" on the 13th day of December, 1600, did \"waylay the said Thomas\r\nClifton\" as he was \"walking quietly from your subject's said house\r\ntowards the said school,\" and \"with great force and violence did seize\r\nand surprise, and him with like force and violence did, to the great\r\nterror and hurt of him, the said Thomas Clifton, haul, pull, drag, and\r\ncarry away to the said playhouse.\" As soon as the father learned of\r\nthis, he hurried to the playhouse and \"made request to have his said\r\nson released.\" But Giles and Evans \"utterly and scornfully refused to\r\ndo\" this. Whereupon Clifton threatened to complain to the Privy\r\nCouncil. But Evans and Giles \"in very scornful manner willed your said\r\nsubject to complain to whom he would.\" Clifton suggested that \"it was\r\nnot fit that a gentleman of his sort should have his son and heir\r\n(and that his only son) to be so basely used.\" Giles and Evans \"most\r\narrogantly then and there answered that they had authority sufficient\r\nso to take any nobleman's son in this land\"; and further to irritate\r\nthe father, they immediately put into young Thomas's hand \"a scroll of\r\npaper, containing part of one of their said plays or interludes, and\r\nhim, the said Thomas Clifton, commanded to learn the same by heart,\"\r\nwith the admonition that \"if he did not obey the said Evans, he should\r\nbe surely whipped.\"[329]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: The full complaint is printed by Fleay, _op. cit._, p.\r\n127.]\r\n\r\nClifton at once appealed to his friend, Sir John Fortescue, a member\r\nof the Privy Council, at whose order young Thomas was released and\r\nsent back to his studies. Apparently this ended the episode. But\r\nClifton, nourishing his animosity, began to investigate the management\r\nof Blackfriars, and to collect evidence of similar abuses of the\r\nQueen's commission, with the object of making complaint to the Star\r\nChamber. In October, 1601, Evans, it seems, learned of Clifton's\r\npurpose, for on the 21st of that month he deeded all his property to\r\nhis son-in-law, Alexander Hawkins.[330] Clifton finally presented his\r\ncomplaint to the Star Chamber on December 15, 1601,[331] but his\r\ncomplaint was probably not acted on until early in 1602, for during\r\nthe Christmas holidays the Children were summoned as usual to present\r\ntheir play before the Queen.[332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: _Ibid._, pp. 244-45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: Wallace, _The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_,\r\np. 84, note 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: On December 29, 1601, Sir Dudley Carleton wrote to his\r\nfriend John Chamberlain: \"The Queen dined this day privately at My\r\nLord Chamberlain's. I came even now from the Blackfriars, where I saw\r\nher at the play with all her _candidæ auditrices_.\" From this it has\r\nbeen generally assumed that Elizabeth visited the playhouse in\r\nBlackfriars to see the Children act there; and Mr. Wallace, in his\r\n_The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, pp. 26, 87, 95-97, lays\r\ngreat emphasis upon it to show that the Queen was directly responsible\r\nfor establishing and managing the Children at Blackfriars. But the\r\nassumption that the Queen attended a performance at the Blackfriars\r\nPlayhouse is, I think, unwarranted. The Lord Chamberlain at this time\r\nwas Lord Hunsdon, who lived \"in the Blackfriars.\" No doubt on this\r\nChristmas occasion he entertained the Queen with a great dinner, and\r\nafter the dinner with a play given, not in a playhouse, but in his\r\nmansion. (Lord Cobham, who was formerly Lord Chamberlain, and who also\r\nlived in Blackfriars, had similarly entertained the Queen with plays\r\n\"in Blackfriars\"; cf. also The Malone Society's _Collections_, II,\r\n52.) Furthermore, the actors on this occasion were probably not the\r\nChildren of the Chapel, as Mr. Wallace thinks, but Lord Hunsdon's own\r\ntroupe. Possibly one of Shakespeare's new plays (_Hamlet_?) was then\r\npresented before the Queen for the first time.]\r\n\r\nShortly after this, however, the Star Chamber passed on Clifton's\r\ncomplaint. The decree itself is lost, but the following reference to\r\nit is made in a subsequent lawsuit: \"The said Evans ... was censured\r\nby the right honorable Court of Star Chamber for his unorderly\r\ncarriage and behaviour in taking up of gentlemen's children against\r\ntheir wills and to employ them for players, and for other misdemeanors\r\nin the said Decree contained; and further that all assurances made to\r\nthe said Evans concerning the said house or plays or interludes\r\nshould be utterly void, and to be delivered up to be canceled.\"[333]\r\nDoubtless the decree fell with equal force upon Giles and the others\r\nconnected with the enterprise, for after the Star Chamber decree Giles\r\nand Robinson disappear from the management of the playhouse. Evans was\r\nforbidden to have any connection with plays there; and for a time, no\r\ndoubt, the building was closed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: Fleay, _op. cit._, p. 248.]\r\n\r\nEvans, however, still held the lease, and was under the necessity of\r\npaying the rent as before. Then came forward Edward Kirkham, who, in\r\nhis official capacity as Yeoman of the Revels, had become acquainted\r\nwith the dramatic activities of the Children of the Chapel. He saw an\r\nopportunity to take over the Blackfriars venture now that Evans and\r\nprobably Giles had been forbidden by the Star Chamber to have any\r\nconnection with plays in that building. Having associated with him\r\nWilliam Rastell, a merchant, and Thomas Kendall,[334] a haberdasher,\r\nhe made overtures to Evans, the owner of the lease. Evans, however,\r\nwas determined to retain a half-interest in the playhouse, and to\r\nevade the order of the Star Chamber by using his son-in-law, Alexander\r\nHawkins, as his agent. Accordingly, on April 20, 1602, \"Articles of\r\nAgreement\" were signed between Evans and Hawkins on the one part, and\r\nKirkham, Rastell, and Kendall on the other part, whereby the latter\r\nwere admitted to a half-interest in the playhouse and in the troupe of\r\nchild-actors. Kirkham, Rastell, and Kendall agreed to pay one-half of\r\nthe annual rent of £40,[335] to pay one-half of the repairs on the\r\nbuilding, and in addition to spend £400 on apparel and furnishings for\r\nthe troupe. Under this reorganization--with Evans as a secret\r\npartner--the Children continued to act with their customary success.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: We find in Henslowe's _Diary_ a player named William\r\nKendall, but we do not know that he was related to Thomas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: The agreements remind one of the organization of the\r\nGlobe. It seems clear that Kirkham, Rastell, and Kendall held their\r\nmoiety in joint tenancy.]\r\n\r\nAbout a month later, however, Lord Hunsdon, the Lord Chamberlain,\r\nwhose house adjoined Blackfriars, seems to have inquired into the\r\naffairs of the new organization.[336] What Kirkham told him led him to\r\norder Evans off the premises. Evans informs us that he was \"commanded\r\nby his Lordship to avoid and leave the same; for fear of whose\r\ndispleasure, the complainant [Evans] was forced to leave the\r\ncountry.\"[337] He felt it prudent to remain away from London \"for a\r\nlong space and time\"; yet he \"lost nothing,\" for \"he left the said\r\nAlexander Hawkins to deal for him and to take such benefit of the said\r\nhouse as should belong unto him in his absence.\"[338]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: Fleay, _op. cit._, pp. 211-13; 216; 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: _Ibid._, p. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: _Ibid._, p. 217.]\r\n\r\nIf we may judge from the enthusiastic account given by the Duke of\r\nStettin-Pomerania, who visited Blackfriars in the September\r\nfollowing, the Children were just as effective under Kirkham's\r\nmanagement as they had been under the management of Giles and Evans.\r\nIt is to be noted, however, that Elizabeth did not again invite the\r\nBlackfriars troupe to the Court.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Queen in 1603 led to the closing of all playhouses.\r\nThis was followed by a long attack of the plague, so that for many\r\nmonths Blackfriars was closed, and \"by reason thereof no such profit\r\nand commodity was raised and made of and by the said playhouse as was\r\nhoped for.\"[339] Evans actually \"treated\" with Richard Burbage \"about\r\nthe surrendering and giving up the said lease,\" but Burbage declined\r\nto consider the matter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: Fleay, _op. cit._, p. 235.]\r\n\r\nShortly after this the plague ceased, and acting, stimulated by King\r\nJames's patronage, was resumed with fervor. The Blackfriars Company\r\nwas reorganized under Edward Kirkham, Alexander Hawkins (acting for\r\nEvans), Thomas Kendall, and Robert Payne: and on February 4, 1604, it\r\nsecured a royal patent to play under the title \"The Children of the\r\nQueen's Revels.\"[340] According to this patent, the poet Samuel\r\nDaniel was specially appointed to license their plays: \"Provided\r\nalways that no such plays or shows shall be presented before the said\r\nQueen our wife by the said Children, or by them anywhere publicly\r\nacted, but by the approbation and allowance of Samuel Daniel, whom her\r\npleasure is to appoint for that purpose.\" At this time, too, or not\r\nlong after, John Marston was allowed a share in the organization, and\r\nthus was retained as one of its regular playwrights.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: For the patent, commonly misdated January 30, see The\r\nMalone Society's _Collections_, I, 267. Mr. Wallace, in _The Century\r\nMagazine_ (September, 1910, p. 747), says that the company secured its\r\npatent \"through the intercessions of the poet Samuel Daniel.\" It is\r\ntrue that the Children of Her Majesty's Royal Chamber of Bristol\r\nsecured their patent in 1615 at the intercession of Daniel, but I know\r\nof no evidence that he intervened in behalf of the Blackfriars\r\ntroupe.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the new company is indicated by the fact that it was\r\nsummoned to present a play at Court in February, 1604, and again two\r\nplays in January, 1605. Evans's activity in the management of the\r\ntroupe in spite of the order of the Star Chamber is evident from the\r\nfact that the payment for the last two court performances was made\r\ndirectly to him.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1604 the company gave serious offense by acting\r\nSamuel Daniel's _Philotas_, which was supposed to relate to the\r\nunfortunate Earl of Essex; but the blame must have fallen largely on\r\nDaniel, who not only wrote the play, but also licensed its\r\nperformance. He was summoned before the Privy Council to explain, and\r\nseems to have fully proved his innocence. Shortly after this he\r\npublished the play with an apology affixed.[341]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: A letter from Daniel to the Earl of Devonshire\r\nvindicating the play is printed in Grosart's _Daniel_, I, xxii.]\r\n\r\nThe following year the Children gave much more serious offense by\r\nacting _Eastward Hoe_, a comedy in which Marston, Chapman, and Jonson\r\ncollaborated. Not only did the play ridicule the Scots in general, and\r\nKing James's creation of innumerable knights in particular, but one of\r\nthe little actors was actually made, it seems, to mimic the royal\r\nbrogue: \"I ken the man weel; he is one of my thirty pound Knights.\"\r\nMarston escaped by timely flight, but Jonson and Chapman were arrested\r\nand lodged in jail, and were for a time in some danger of having their\r\nnostrils slit and their ears cropped. Both Chapman and Jonson asserted\r\nthat they were wholly innocent, and Chapman openly put the blame of\r\nthe offensive passages on Marston.[342] Marston, however, was beyond\r\nthe reach of the King's wrath, so His Majesty punished instead the men\r\nin control of Blackfriars. It was discovered that the manager,\r\nKirkham, had presented the play without securing the Lord\r\nChamberlain's allowance. As a result, he and the others in charge of\r\nthe Children were prohibited from any further connection with the\r\nplayhouse. This doubtless explains the fact that Kirkham shortly after\r\nappears as one of the managers of Paul's Boys.[343] It explains, also,\r\nthe following statement made by Evans in the course of one of the\r\nlater legal documents: \"After the King's most excellent Majesty, upon\r\nsome misdemeanors committed in or about the plays there, _and\r\nspecially upon the defendant's_ [Kirkham's] _acts and doings there_,\r\nhad prohibited that no plays should be more used there,\" etc.[344] Not\r\nonly was Kirkham driven from the management of the troupe and the\r\nplayhouse closed for a time, but the Children were denied the Queen's\r\npatronage. No longer were they allowed to use the high-sounding title\r\n\"The Children of the Queen's Majesty's Revels\"; instead, we find them\r\ndescribed merely as \"The Children of the Revels,\" or as \"The Children\r\nof Blackfriars.\"[345]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: See Dobell, \"Newly Discovered Documents,\" in _The\r\nAthenæum_, March 30, 1901.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: Cunningham, _Revels_, p. xxxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: Fleay, _op. cit._, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: Except carelessly, as when sometimes called \"The\r\nChildren of the Chapel.\"]\r\n\r\nFor a time, no doubt, affairs at the playhouse were at a standstill.\r\nEvans again sought to surrender his lease to Burbage, but without\r\nsuccess.[346] Marston, having escaped the wrath of the King by flight,\r\ndecided to end his career as a playwright and turn country parson. It\r\nwas shortly after this, in all probability, that he sold his share in\r\nthe Blackfriars organization to one Robert Keysar, a goldsmith of\r\nLondon, for the sum of £100.[347]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: _Ibid._, pp. 81, 86, 89, 93.]\r\n\r\nKeysar, it seems, undertook to reopen the playhouse, and to continue\r\nthe Children there at his own expense.[348] From the proprietors he\r\nrented the playhouse, the stock of apparel, the furnishings, and\r\nplaybooks. This, I take it, explains the puzzling statement made by\r\nKirkham some years later:\r\n\r\n     This repliant [Kirkham] and his said partners [Rastell and\r\n     Kendall] have had and received the sum of one hundred pounds\r\n     per annum for their part and moiety in the premises without\r\n     any manner of charges whatsoever [i.e., during Kirkham's\r\n     management of the troupe prior to 1605].[349] And after that\r\n     this replyant and his said partners had received the\r\n     foresaid profits [i.e., after Kirkham and his partners had\r\n     to give up the management of the Children in 1605], the said\r\n     Children, which the said Evans in his answer affirmeth to be\r\n     the Queen's Children [i.e., they are no longer the Queen's\r\n     Children, for after 1605 they had been deprived of the\r\n     Queen's patronage; but Kirkham was in error, for Evans with\r\n     legal precision had referred to the company as 'The Queen's\r\n     Majesty's Children of the Revels (for so it was often\r\n     called)'] were masters themselves [i.e., their own\r\n     managers], and this complainant and his said partners\r\n     received of them, and of one Keysar who was interest with\r\n     them, above the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds per\r\n     annum only for the use of the said great hall, without all\r\n     manner of charges, as this replyant will make it manifest to\r\n     this honorable court.[350]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p. 80\r\nff.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: That is, £33, more or less, a share. We have\r\ndocumentary evidence to show that a share in the Red Bull produced\r\n£30, and a share in the Globe £30 to £40 per annum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: Fleay, _op. cit._, p. 249. The yearly rental must have\r\nincluded not only the playhouse and its equipment, but the playbooks,\r\napparel, properties, etc., belonging to the Children. These were on\r\nJuly 26, 1608, divided up among the sharers, Kirkham, Rastell,\r\nKendall, and Evans.]\r\n\r\nUnder Keysar's management the Blackfriars troupe continued to act as\r\nthe Children of the Revels. But, unfortunately, they had not learned\r\nwisdom from their recent experience, and in the very following year we\r\nfind them again in serious trouble. John Day's _Isle of Guls_, acted\r\nin February, 1606, gave great offense to the Court. Sir Edward Hoby,\r\nin a letter to Sir Thomas Edwards,[351] writes: \"At this time was much\r\nspeech of a play in the Blackfriars, where, in the _Isle of Guls_,\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest, all men's parts were acted of two\r\ndiverse nations. As I understand, sundry were committed to\r\nBridewell.\"[352]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: Birch, _Court and Times of James the First_, I, 60;\r\nquoted by E.K. Chambers, in _Modern Language Review_, IV, 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: Possibly an aftermath of the King's displeasure is to\r\nbe found in the cancellation of Giles's long-standing commission to\r\ntake up boys for the Chapel, and the issuance of a new commission to\r\nhim, November 7, 1606, with the distinct proviso that \"none of the\r\nsaid choristers or children of the Chapel so to be taken by force of\r\nthis commission shall be used or employed as commedians or stage\r\nplayers.\" (The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 357.)]\r\n\r\nThe Children, however, were soon allowed to resume playing, and they\r\ncontinued for a time without mishap. But in the early spring of 1608\r\nthey committed the most serious offense of all by acting Chapman's\r\n_Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron_. The French\r\nAmbassador took umbrage at the uncomplimentary representation of the\r\ncontemporary French Court, and had an order made forbidding them to\r\nact the play. But the Children, \"voyant toute la Cour dehors, ne\r\nlaisserent de la faire, et non seulement cela, mais y introduiserent\r\nla Reine et Madame de Verneuil, traitant celle-ci fort mal de\r\nparoles, et lui donnant un soufflet.\" Whereupon the French Ambassador\r\nmade special complaint to Salisbury, who ordered the arrest of the\r\nauthor and the actors. \"Toutefois il ne s'en trouva que trois, qui\r\naussi-tôt furent menés à la prison où ils sont encore; mais le\r\nprincipal, qui est le compositeur, échapa.\"[353] The Ambassador\r\nobserves also that a few days before the Children of the Revels had\r\ngiven offense by a play on King James: \"Un jour ou deux avant, ils\r\navoient dépêché leur Roi, sa mine d'Ecosse, et tous ses Favoris d'une\r\nétrange sorte; car aprés lui avoir fait dépiter le Ciel sur le vol\r\nd'un oisseau, et fait battre un Gentilhomme pour avoir rompu ses\r\nchiens, ils le dépeignoient ivre pour le moins une fois le jour.\"[354]\r\nAs a result of these two offenses, coming as a climax to a long series\r\nof such offenses, the King was \"extrêmement irrité contre ces\r\nmarauds-là,\" and gave order for their immediate suppression. This\r\nmarked the end of the child-actors at Blackfriars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: From the report of the French Ambassador, M. de la\r\nBoderie, to M. de Puisieux at Paris, _Ambassades de Monsieur de la\r\nBoderie en Angleterre_, 1750, III, 196; quoted by E.K. Chambers in\r\n_Modern Language Review_, IV, 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: The name of this play is not known; probably the King\r\nwas satirized in a comic scene foisted upon an otherwise innocent\r\npiece. Mr. Wallace, in _The Century Magazine_ (September, 1910, p.\r\n747), says: \"From a document I have found in France the Blackfriars\r\nboys now satirized the King's efforts to raise money, made local jokes\r\non the recent discovery of his silver mine in Scotland, brought him on\r\nthe stage as drunk, and showed such to be his condition at least three\r\ntimes a day, caricatured him in his favorite pastime of hawking, and\r\nrepresented him as swearing and cursing at a gentleman for losing a\r\nbird.\" I do not know what document Mr. Wallace has found; the French\r\ndocument quoted above has been known for a long time.]\r\n\r\nNaturally Kirkham, Rastell, and Kendall, since there was \"no profit\r\nmade of the said house, but a continual rent of forty pounds to be\r\npaid for the same,\" became sick of their bargain with Evans. An\r\nadditional reason for their wishing to withdraw finally from the\r\nenterprise was the rapid increase of the plague, which about July 25\r\nclosed all playhouses. So Kirkham, \"at or about the 26 of July, 1608,\r\ncaused the apparrels, properties, and goods belonging to the\r\ncopartners, sharers, and masters\" to be divided. Kirkham and his\r\nassociates took away their portions, and \"quit the place,\" the\r\none-time manager using to Evans some unkind words: \"said he would deal\r\nno more with it, 'for,' quod he, 'it is a base thing,' or used words\r\nto such or very like effect.\"[355] Evans, thus deserted by Kirkham,\r\nRastell, and Kendall, regarded the organization of the Blackfriars as\r\ndissolved; he \"delivered up their commission which he had under the\r\nGreat Seal authorizing them to play, and discharged diverse of the\r\npartners and poets.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: Fleay, _op. cit._, pp. 221-22.]\r\n\r\nRobert Keysar, however, the old manager, laid plans to keep the\r\nChildren together, and continue them as a troupe after the cessation\r\nof the plague. For a while, we are told, he maintained them at his own\r\nexpense, \"in hope to have enjoyed his said bargain ... upon the\r\nceasing of the general sickness.\"[356] And he expected, by virtue of\r\nthe share he had purchased from John Marston, to be able to use the\r\nBlackfriars Playhouse for his purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, pp.\r\n83, 97.]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Evans began negotiations with Burbage for the\r\nsurrender of the lease: \"By reason the said premises lay then and had\r\nlong lyen void and without use for plays, whereby the same became not\r\nonly burthensome and unprofitable unto the said Evans, but also ran\r\nfar into decay for want of reparations ... the said Evans began to\r\ntreat with the said Richard Burbage about a surrender of the said\r\nEvans his said lease.\"[357] This time Burbage listened to the\r\nproposal, for he and his fellow-actors at the Globe \"considered that\r\nthe house would be fit for themselves.\" So in August, 1608, he agreed\r\nto take over the building for the use of the King's Men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: _Ibid._, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nEven after Evans's surrender of the lease, Keysar, it seems, made an\r\neffort to keep the Children together. On the following Christmas,\r\n1608-09, we find a record of payment to him for performances at Court,\r\nby \"The Children of Blackfriars.\" But soon after this the troupe must\r\nhave been disbanded. Keysar says that they were \"enforced to be\r\ndispersed and turned away to the abundant hurt of the said young\r\nmen\";[358] and the Burbages and Heminges declare that the children\r\n\"were dispersed and driven each of them to provide for himself by\r\nreason that the plays ceasing in the City of London, either through\r\nsickness, or for some other cause, he, the said complainant [Keysar],\r\nwas no longer able to maintain them together.\"[359] In the autumn of\r\n1609, however, Keysar assembled the Children again, reorganized them\r\nwith the assistance of Philip Rosseter, and placed them in Whitefriars\r\nPlayhouse, recently left vacant by the disruption of the Children of\r\nHis Majesty's Revels. Their subsequent history will be found related\r\nin the chapter dealing with that theatre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: _Ibid._, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n97.]\r\n\r\nWhen in August, 1608, Richard Burbage secured from Evans the surrender\r\nof the Blackfriars lease, he at once proceeded to organize from the\r\nGlobe Company a syndicate to operate the building as a playhouse. He\r\nadmitted to partnership in the new enterprise all of the then sharers\r\nin the Globe except Witter and Nichols, outsiders who had secured\r\ntheir interest through marriage with the heirs of Pope and Phillips,\r\nand who, therefore, were not entitled to any consideration. In\r\naddition, he admitted Henry Evans, doubtless in fulfillment of a\r\ncondition in the surrender of the lease. The syndicate thus formed was\r\nmade up of seven equal sharers, as follows: Richard Burbage, Cuthbert\r\nBurbage, Henry Evans, William Shakespeare, John Heminges, Henry\r\nCondell, and William Slye. These sharers leased the building from\r\nRichard Burbage for a period of twenty-one years,[360] at the old\r\nrental of £40 per annum, each binding himself to pay annually the sum\r\nof £5 14_s._ 4_d._[361] The method of distributing the profits between\r\nthe sharers (known as \"housekeepers\") and the actors (known as the\r\n\"company\") was to be the same as that practiced at the Globe.[362]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: Twenty-one years was a very common term for a lease to\r\nrun; but in this case, no doubt, it was intended that the lease of\r\nBlackfriars should last as long as the lease of the Globe, which then\r\nhad exactly twenty-one years to run.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: Shortly after this agreement had been made William Slye\r\ndied, and his executrix delivered up his share to Richard Burbage \"to\r\nbe cancelled and made void.\" See the Heminges-Osteler documents\r\nprinted by Mr. Wallace in the London _Times_, October 4, 1909. In 1611\r\nBurbage let William Osteler have this share.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: The method is clearly explained in the documents of\r\n1635 printed by Halliwell-Phillipps, in _Outlines_, I, 312.]\r\n\r\nSoon after this organization was completed, the King's Men moved from\r\nthe Globe to the Blackfriars. They did not, of course, intend to\r\nabandon the Globe. Their plan was to use the Blackfriars as a \"winter\r\nhome,\" and the Globe as a \"summer house.\"[363] Malone observed from\r\nthe Herbert Manuscript that \"the King's Company usually began to play\r\nat the Globe in the month of May\";[364] although he failed to state at\r\nwhat time in the autumn they usually moved to the Blackfriars, the\r\nevidence points to the first of November.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: See Wright, _Historia Histrionica_, Hazlitt's Dodsley,\r\nXV, 406.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 71.]\r\n\r\nSuch a plan had many advantages. For one thing, it would prevent the\r\npecuniary losses often caused by a severe winter. In the _Poetaster_\r\n(1601), Jonson makes Histrio, representing the Globe Players, say: \"O,\r\nit will get us a huge deal of money, and we have need on't, for this\r\nwinter has made us all poorer than so many starved snakes; nobody\r\ncomes at us.\"[365] This could not be said of the King's Men after they\r\nmoved to the Blackfriars. Edward Kirkham, a man experienced in\r\ntheatrical finances, offered to prove to the court in 1612 that the\r\nKing's Men \"got, and as yet doth, more in one winter in the said great\r\nhall by a thousand pounds than they were used to get on the\r\nBankside.\"[366]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: Act III, scene iv. Cf. also Webster's Preface to _The\r\nWhite Devil_, acted at the Red Bull about 1610.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: Fleay, _A Chronicle History of the London Stage_, p.\r\n248.]\r\n\r\nKirkham's testimony as to the popularity of the King's Men in their\r\nwinter home is borne out by a petition to the city authorities made by\r\n\"the constables and other officers and inhabitants of Blackfriars\" in\r\nJanuary, 1619. They declared that to the playhouse \"there is daily\r\nsuch resort of people, and such multitudes of coaches (whereof many\r\nare hackney-coaches, bringing people of all sorts), that sometimes all\r\nour streets cannot contain them, but that they clog up Ludgate also,\r\nin such sort that both they endanger the one the other, break down\r\nstalls, throw down men's goods from their shops, and the inhabitants\r\nthere cannot come to their houses, nor bring in their necessary\r\nprovisions of beer, wood, coal, or hay, nor the tradesmen or\r\nshopkeepers utter their wares, nor the passenger go to the common\r\nwater stairs without danger of their lives and limbs.\" \"These\r\ninconveniences\" were said to last \"every day in the winter time from\r\none or two of the clock till six at night.\"[367]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 91.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of this petition the London Common Council ordered,\r\nJanuary 21, 1619, that \"the said playhouses be suppressed, and that\r\nthe players shall from thenceforth forbear and desist from playing in\r\nthat house.\"[368] But the players had at Court many influential\r\nfriends, and these apparently came to their rescue. The order of the\r\nCommon Council was not put into effect; and so far as we know the only\r\nresult of this agitation was that King James on March 27 issued to his\r\nactors a new patent specifically giving them--described as his\r\n\"well-beloved servants\"--the right henceforth to play unmolested in\r\nBlackfriars. The new clause in the patent runs: \"as well within their\r\ntwo their now usual houses called the Globe, within our County of\r\nSurrey, and their private house situate in the precinct of the\r\nBlackfriars, within our city of London.\"[369] At the accession of King\r\nCharles I, the patent was renewed, June 24, 1625, with the same clause\r\nregarding the use of Blackfriars.[370]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 311.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 281.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: _Ibid._, I, 282.]\r\n\r\nIn 1631, however, the agitation was renewed, this time in the form of\r\na petition from the churchwardens and constables of the precinct of\r\nBlackfriars to William Laud, then Bishop of London. The document gives\r\nsuch eloquent testimony to the popularity of the playhouse that I have\r\ninserted it below in full:\r\n\r\n     To the Right Honorable and Right Reverend Father in God,\r\n     William, Lord Bishop of London, one of His Majesty's\r\n     Honorable Privy Council. The humble petition of the\r\n     churchwardens and constables of Blackfriars, on the behalf\r\n     of the whole Parish, showing that by reason of a playhouse,\r\n     exceedingly frequented, in the precinct of the said\r\n     Blackfriars, the inhabitants there suffer many grievances\r\n     upon the inconveniences hereunto annexed, and many other.\r\n\r\n     May it therefore please your Lordship to take the said\r\n     grievances into your honorable consideration for the\r\n     redressing thereof. And for the reviving the order, which\r\n     hath been heretofore made by the Lords of the Council, and\r\n     the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen, for the removal of\r\n     them. And they shall, according to their duties, ever pray\r\n     for your Lordship.\r\n\r\n     Reasons and Inconveniences Inducing the Inhabitants of\r\n     Blackfriars, London, to Become Humble Suitors to Your\r\n     Lordship for Removing the Playhouse in the Said Blackfriars:\r\n\r\n     1. The shopkeepers in divers places suffer much, being\r\n     hindered by the great recourse to the plays (especially of\r\n     coaches) from selling their commodities, and having their\r\n     wares many times broken and beaten off their stalls.\r\n\r\n     2. The recourse of coaches is many times so great that the\r\n     inhabitants cannot in an afternoon take in any provision of\r\n     beer, coals, wood, or hay, the streets being known to be so\r\n     exceeding straight and narrow.\r\n\r\n     3. The passage through Ludgate to the water [i.e., Water\r\n     Lane] is many times stopped up, people in their ordinary\r\n     going much endangered, quarrels and bloodshed many times\r\n     occasioned, and many disorderly people towards night\r\n     gathered thither, under pretense of attending and waiting\r\n     for those at the plays.\r\n\r\n     4. If there should happen any misfortune of fire, there is\r\n     not likely any present order could possibly be taken, for\r\n     the disorder and number of the coaches, since there could be\r\n     no speedy passage made for quenching the fire, to the\r\n     endangering of the parish and city.\r\n\r\n     5. Christenings and burials, which usually are in the\r\n     afternoon, are many times disturbed, and persons endangered\r\n     in that part, which is the greatest part of the parish.\r\n\r\n     6. Persons of honor and quality that dwell in the parish are\r\n     restrained by the number of coaches from going out, or\r\n     coming home in seasonable time, to the prejudice of their\r\n     occasions. And some persons of honor have left, and others\r\n     have refused houses for this very inconvenience, to the\r\n     prejudice and loss of the parish.\r\n\r\n     7. The Lords of the Council in former times have by order\r\n     directed that there shall be but two playhouses tolerated,\r\n     and those _without the city_, the one at the Bankside, the\r\n     other near Golding Lane (which these players still have and\r\n     use all summer), which the Lords did signify by their\r\n     letters to the Lord Mayor; and in performance thereof the\r\n     Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen did give order that\r\n     they should forbear to play any longer there, which the\r\n     players promised to the Lord Chief Justice of the Common\r\n     Pleas (while he was Recorder of London) to observe,\r\n     entreating only a little time to provide themselves\r\n     elsewhere.[371]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: Collier, _History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879),\r\nI, 455.]\r\n\r\nBishop Laud endorsed the petition with his own hand \"To the Coun.\r\nTable,\" and in all probability he submitted it to the consideration of\r\nthe Privy Council. If so, the Council took no action.\r\n\r\nBut in 1633, as a result of further complaints about the crowding of\r\ncoaches, the Privy Council appointed a committee to estimate the value\r\nof the Blackfriars Theatre and \"the buildings thereunto belonging,\"\r\nwith the idea of removing the playhouse and paying the owners\r\ntherefor. The committee reported that \"the players demanded £21,000.\r\nThe commissioners [Sir Henry Spiller, Sir William Beecher, and\r\nLaurence Whitaker] valued it at near £3000. The Parishioners offered\r\ntowards the removing of them £100.\"[372] Obviously the plan of removal\r\nwas not feasible, if indeed the Privy Council seriously contemplated\r\nsuch action. The only result of this second agitation was the\r\nissuance on November 20 of special instructions to coachmen: \"If any\r\npersons, men or women, of what condition soever, repair to the\r\naforesaid playhouse in coach, as soon as they are gone out of their\r\ncoaches, the coachmen shall depart thence and not return till the end\r\nof the play.\"[373] Garrard, in a letter to the Lord Deputy dated\r\nJanuary 9, 1633, says: \"Here hath been an order of the Lords of the\r\nCouncil hung up in a table near Paul's and the Blackfriars to command\r\nall that resort to the playhouse there to send away their coaches, and\r\nto disperse abroad in Paul's Churchyard, Carter Lane, the Conduit in\r\nFleet Street, and other places, and not to return to fetch their\r\ncompany, but they must trot afoot to find their coaches. 'Twas kept\r\nvery strictly for two or three weeks, but now I think it is disordered\r\nagain.\"[374] The truth is that certain distinguished patrons of the\r\ntheatre did not care \"to trot afoot to find their coaches,\" and so\r\nmade complaint at Court. As a result it was ordered, at a sitting of\r\nthe Council, December 29, 1633 (the King being present): \"Upon\r\ninformation this day given to the Board of the discommodity that\r\ndiverse persons of great quality, especially Ladies and Gentlewomen,\r\ndid receive in going to the playhouse of Blackfriars by reason that no\r\ncoaches may stand ... the Board ... think fit to explain the said\r\norder in such manner that as many coaches as may stand within the\r\nBlackfriars Gate may enter and stay there.\"[375]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: The _Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1633_, p. 293.\r\nThe report of the commissioners in full, as printed by Collier in _New\r\nFacts_ (1835), p. 27, and again in _History of English Dramatic\r\nPoetry_ (1879), I, 477, is not above suspicion, although Mr. E.K.\r\nChambers is inclined to think it genuine. According to this document\r\nthe actors estimated the property to be worth £21,990, but the\r\ncommittee thought that the actors might be persuaded to accept £2900\r\n13_s._ 4_d._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 99; 387.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: _The Earl of Strafforde's Letters_ (Dublin, 1740), I,\r\n175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 388.]\r\n\r\nAll this agitation about coaches implies a fashionable and wealthy\r\npatronage of the Blackfriars. An interesting glimpse of high society\r\nat the theatre is given in a letter written by Garrard, January 25,\r\n1636: \"A little pique happened betwixt the Duke of Lenox and the Lord\r\nChamberlain about a box at a new play in the Blackfriars, of which the\r\nDuke had got the key, which, if it had come to be debated betwixt\r\nthem, as it was once intended, some heat or perhaps other\r\ninconvenience might have happened.\"[376] The Queen herself also\r\nsometimes went thither. Herbert records, without any comment, her\r\npresence there on the 13 of May, 1634.[377] It has been generally\r\nassumed that she attended a regular afternoon performance; but this, I\r\nam sure, was not the case. The Queen engaged the entire building for\r\nthe private entertainment of herself and her specially invited guests,\r\nand the performance was at night. In a bill presented by the King's\r\nMen for plays acted before the members of the royal family during the\r\nyear 1636 occurs the entry: \"The 5th of May, at the Blackfryers, for\r\nthe Queene and the Prince Elector ... _Alfonso_.\" Again, in a similar\r\nbill for the year 1638 (see the bill on page 404) is the entry: \"At\r\nthe Blackfryers, the 23 of Aprill, for the Queene ... _The\r\nUnfortunate Lovers_.\" The fact that the actors did not record the loss\r\nof their \"day\" at their house, and made their charge accordingly,\r\nshows that the plays were given at night and did not interfere with\r\nthe usual afternoon performances before the public.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: _The Earl of Strafforde's Letters_ (Dublin, 1740), I,\r\n511.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: The Herbert MS., Malone, _Variorum_, III, 167.]\r\n\r\nThe King's Men continued to occupy the Blackfriars as their winter\r\nhome until the closing of the theatres in 1642. Thereafter the\r\nbuilding must have stood empty for a number of years. In 1653 Sir\r\nAston Cokaine, in a poem prefixed to Richard Brome's _Plays_, looked\r\nforward prophetically to the happy day when\r\n\r\n     Black, and White Friars too, shall flourish again.\r\n\r\nBut the prophecy was not to be fulfilled; for although Whitefriars\r\n(i.e., Salisbury Court) did flourish as a Restoration playhouse, the\r\nmore famous Blackfriars had ceased to exist before acting was allowed\r\nagain. The manuscript note in the Phillipps copy of Stow's _Annals_\r\n(1631) informs us that \"the Blackfriars players' playhouse in\r\nBlackfriars, London, which had stood many years, was pulled down to\r\nthe ground on Monday the 6 day of August, 1655, and tenements built in\r\nthe room.\"[378]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: See _The Academy_, 1882, XXII, 314. Exactly the same\r\nfate had overtaken the Globe ten years earlier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE GLOBE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs related more fully in the chapter on \"The Theatre,\" when Cuthbert\r\nand Richard Burbage discovered that Gyles Alleyn not only refused to\r\nrenew the lease for the land on which their playhouse stood, but was\r\nactually planning to seize the building and devote it to his private\r\nuses, they took immediate steps to thwart him. And in doing so they\r\nevolved a new and admirable scheme of theatrical management. They\r\nplanned to bring together into a syndicate or stock-company some of\r\nthe best actors of the day, and allow these actors to share in the\r\nownership of the building. Hitherto playhouses had been erected merely\r\nas pecuniary investments by profit-seeking business men,--Burbage,[379]\r\nBrayne, Lanman, Henslowe, Cholmley, Langley,--and had been conducted\r\nin the interests of the proprietors rather than of the actors.[380] As\r\na result, these proprietors had long reaped an unduly rich harvest\r\nfrom the efforts of the players, taking all or a large share of the\r\nincome from the galleries. The new scheme was designed to remedy these\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: That even James Burbage is to be put in this class\r\ncannot be disputed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: Cuthbert Burbage in 1635 says: \"The players that lived\r\nin those first times had only the profits arising from the doors, but\r\nnow the players receive all the comings-in at the doors to themselves\r\nand half the galleries from the housekeepers.\" (Halliwell-Phillipps,\r\n_Outlines_, I, 317.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD BURBAGE\r\n\r\n(Reproduced by permission from a painting in the Dulwich Picture\r\nGallery; photograph by Emery Walker, Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nFor participation in this scheme the Burbages selected the following\r\nmen: William Shakespeare, not only a successful actor, but a poet who\r\nhad already made his reputation as a writer of plays, and who gave\r\npromise of greater attainments; John Heminges, a good actor and an\r\nexceptionally shrewd man of business, who until his death managed the\r\npecuniary affairs of the company with distinguished success; Augustine\r\nPhillips and Thomas Pope, both ranked with the best actors of the\r\nday;[381] and William Kempe, the greatest comedian since Tarleton,\r\ndescribed in 1600 as \"a player in interludes, and partly the Queen's\r\nMajesty's jester.\" When to this group we add Richard Burbage himself,\r\nthe Roscius of his age, we have an organization of business,\r\nhistrionic, and poetic ability that could not be surpassed. It was\r\ncarefully planned, and it deserved the remarkable success which it\r\nattained. The superiority of the Globe Company over all others was\r\nacknowledged in the days of James and Charles, and to-day stands out\r\nas one of the most impressive facts in the history of the early drama.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: See, for example, Thomas Heywood's _Apology for Actors_\r\n(1612). In enumerating the greatest actors of England he says:\r\n\"Gabriel, Singer, Pope, Phillips, Sly--all the right I can do them is\r\nbut this, that though they be dead, their deserts yet live in the\r\nremembrance of many.\"]\r\n\r\nAccording to the original plan there were to be ten shares in the new\r\nenterprise, the Burbage brothers holding between them one-half the\r\nstock, or two and a half shares each, and the five actors holding the\r\nother half, or one share each. All the expenses of leasing a site,\r\nerecting a building, and subsequently operating the building as a\r\nplayhouse, and likewise all the profits to accrue therefrom, were to\r\nbe divided among the sharers according to their several holdings.\r\n\r\nThis organization, it should be understood, merely concerned the\r\nownership of the building. Its members stood in the relation of\r\nlandlords to the players, and were known by the technical name of\r\n\"housekeepers.\" Wholly distinct was the organization of the players,\r\nknown as the \"company.\" The company, too, was divided into shares for\r\nthe purpose of distributing its profits. The \"housekeepers,\" in return\r\nfor providing the building, received one-half of the income from the\r\ngalleries; the company, for entertaining the public, received the\r\nother half of the income from the galleries, plus the takings at the\r\ndoors. Those actors who were also \"housekeepers\" shared twice in the\r\nprofits of the playhouse; and it was a part of the plan of the\r\n\"housekeepers\" to admit actors to be sharers in the building as soon\r\nas they attained eminence, or otherwise made their permanent\r\nconnection with the playhouse desirable. Thus the two organizations,\r\nthough entirely distinct, were interlocking.\r\n\r\nSuch a scheme had many advantages. In the first place, it prevented\r\nthe company from shifting from one playhouse to another, as was\r\nfrequently the case with other troupes. In the second place, it\r\nguaranteed both the excellence and the permanency of the company. Too\r\noften good companies were dissolved by the desertion of a few\r\nimportant members; as every student of the drama knows, the constant\r\nreorganization of troupes is one of the most exasperating features of\r\nElizabethan theatrical history. In the third place, the plan, like all\r\nprofit-sharing schemes, tended to elicit from each member of the\r\norganization his best powers. The opportunity offered to a young actor\r\nultimately to be admitted as a sharer in the ownership of the building\r\nwas a constant source of inspiration,[382] and the power to admit at\r\nany time a new sharer enabled the company to recruit from other\r\ntroupes brilliant actors when such appeared; as, for example, William\r\nOsteler and Nathaniel Field, who had attained fame with the Children\r\nat Blackfriars and elsewhere. Finally, the plan brought the actors\r\ntogether in a close bond of friendship that lasted for life. Heminges\r\nwas loved and trusted by them all. Shakespeare was admired and\r\nrevered; three members of the troupe seem to have named their sons\r\nfor him. Indeed, there is nothing more inspiring in a close study of\r\nall the documents relating to the Globe than the mutual loyalty and\r\ndevotion of the original sharers. The publication of Shakespeare's\r\nplays by Heminges and Condell is merely one out of many expressions of\r\nthis splendid comradeship.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: \"The petitioners have a long time with much patience\r\nexpected to be admitted sharers in the playhouses of the Globe and the\r\nBlackfriars, whereby they might reap some better fruit of their labour\r\nthan hitherto they have done, and be encouraged to proceed therein\r\nwith cheerfulness.\" (The Young Players' Petition, 1635, printed by\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 312.)]\r\n\r\nThe plan of organization having been evolved, and the original members\r\nhaving been selected, the first question presenting itself was, Where\r\nshould the new playhouse be erected? Burbage, Heminges, and the\r\nrest--including Shakespeare--probably gave the question much thought.\r\nTheir experience in Holywell had not been pleasant; the precinct of\r\nBlackfriars, they now well realized, was out of the question; so they\r\nturned their eyes to the Bankside. That section had recently become\r\nthe theatrical centre of London. There were situated the Rose, the\r\nSwan, and the Bear Garden, and thither each day thousands of persons\r\nflocked in search of entertainment. Clearly the Bankside was best\r\nsuited to their purpose. Near the fine old church of St. Mary Overies,\r\nand not far from the Rose and the Bear Garden, they found a plot of\r\nland that met their approval. Its owner, Sir Nicholas Brend, was\r\nwilling to lease it for a long term of years, and at a very reasonable\r\nrate. They made a verbal contract with Brend, according to which the\r\nlease was to begin on December 25, 1598.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nShakespeare seems to have been equally with Burbage a leader in erecting\r\nthe Globe. In 1599 the building is officially described as \"vna domo de\r\nnovo edificata ... in occupacione Willielmi Shakespeare et aliorum.\"]\r\n\r\nThree days later, on December 28, Richard and Cuthbert Burbage, having\r\nsecured the services of the carpenter, Peter Street, and his workmen,\r\ntore down the old Theatre and transported the timber and other\r\nmaterials to this new site across the river; and shortly after the\r\nGlobe began to lift itself above the houses of the Bankside--a\r\nhandsome theatre surpassing anything then known to London playgoers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the lawyers had drawn up the lease, and this was\r\nformally signed on February 21, 1599. The company had arranged a\r\n\"tripartite lease,\" the three parties being Sir Nicholas Brend, the\r\nBurbage brothers, and the five actors.[383] To the Burbages Sir\r\nNicholas leased one-half of the property at a yearly rental of £7\r\n5_s._; and to the five actors, he leased the other half, at the same\r\nrate. Thus the total rent paid for the land was £14 10_s._ The lease\r\nwas to run for a period of thirty-one years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: Exact information about the lease and the organization\r\nof the company is derived from the Heminges-Osteler and the\r\nWitter-Heminges documents, both discovered and printed by Mr. Wallace.\r\nAnd with these one should compare the article by the same author in\r\nthe London _Times_, April 30, May 1, 1914.]\r\n\r\nThe five actors, not satisfied with tying up the property in the\r\n\"tripartite lease,\" proceeded at once to arrange their holdings in the\r\nform of a \"joint tenancy.\" This they accomplished by the following\r\ndevice:\r\n\r\n     William Shakespeare, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, John\r\n     Heminges, and William Kempe did shortly after grant and\r\n     assign all the said moiety of and in the said gardens and\r\n     grounds unto William Levison and Thomas Savage, who\r\n     regranted and reassigned to every one of them severally a\r\n     fifth part of the said moiety of the said gardens and\r\n     grounds.[384]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n53. Shakespeare's leadership in the erection of the Globe is indicated\r\nin several documents; for example, the post-mortem inquisition of the\r\nestate of Sir Thomas Brend, May 16, 1599.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the \"joint tenancy\" was to prevent any member of the\r\norganization from disposing of his share to an outsider. Legally at\r\nthe death of a member his share passed into the possession of the\r\nother members, so that the last survivor would receive the whole. In\r\nreality, however, the members used the \"joint tenancy\" merely to\r\ncontrol the disposition of the shares, and they always allowed the\r\nheirs-at-law to receive the share of a deceased member.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this arrangement was quickly shown, for \"about the time\r\nof the building of said playhouse and galleries, or shortly after,\"\r\nWilliam Kempe decided to withdraw from the enterprise. He had to\r\ndispose of his share to the other parties in the \"joint tenancy,\"\r\nShakespeare, Heminges, Phillips, and Pope, who at once divided it\r\nequally among themselves, and again went through the process necessary\r\nto place that share in \"joint tenancy.\" After the retirement of Kempe,\r\nthe organization, it will be observed, consisted of six men, and the\r\nshares were eight in number, owned as follows: Richard Burbage and\r\nCuthbert Burbage, each two shares, Shakespeare, Heminges, Phillips,\r\nand Pope, each one share.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF THE GLOBE PROPERTY\r\n\r\nBased on the lease and on other documents and references to the\r\nproperty.]\r\n\r\nThe tract of land on which the new playhouse was to be erected is\r\nminutely described in the lease[385] as follows:\r\n\r\n     All that parcel of ground just recently before enclosed and\r\n     made into four separate garden plots, recently in the tenure\r\n     and occupation of Thomas Burt and Isbrand Morris, diers, and\r\n     Lactantius Roper, salter, citizen of London, containing in\r\n     length from east to west two hundred and twenty feet in\r\n     assize or thereabouts, lying and adjoining upon a way or\r\n     lane there on one [the south] side, and abutting upon a\r\n     piece of land called The Park[386] upon the north, and upon\r\n     a garden then or recently in the tenure or occupation of one\r\n     John Cornishe toward the west, and upon another garden plot\r\n     then or recently in the tenure or occupation of one John\r\n     Knowles toward the east, with all the houses, buildings,\r\n     structures, ways, easements, commodities, and appurtenances\r\n     thereunto belonging.... And also all that parcel of land\r\n     just recently before enclosed and made into three separate\r\n     garden plots, whereof two of the same [were] recently in the\r\n     tenure or occupation of John Roberts, carpenter, and another\r\n     recently in the occupation of one Thomas Ditcher, citizen\r\n     and merchant tailor of London ... containing in length from\r\n     east to west by estimation one hundred fifty and six feet of\r\n     assize or thereabouts, and in breadth from the north to the\r\n     south one hundred feet of assize by estimation or\r\n     thereabouts, lying and adjoining upon the other side of the\r\n     way or lane aforesaid, and abutting upon a garden plot there\r\n     then or recently just before in the occupation of William\r\n     Sellers toward the east, and upon one other garden plot\r\n     there, then or recently just before, in the tenure of John\r\n     Burgram, sadler, toward the west, and upon a lane there\r\n     called Maiden Lane towards the south, with all the\r\n     houses....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: The lease is incorporated in the Heminges-Osteler\r\ndocuments, which Mr. Wallace has translated from the Anglicized Latin.\r\nThe original Latin text may be found in Martin, _The Site of the Globe\r\nPlayhouse of Shakespeare_, pp. 161-62. Since, however, that text is\r\nfaultily reproduced, I quote Mr. Wallace's translation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: What is meant by \"The Park\" is a matter of dispute.\r\nSome contend that the Park of the Bishop of Winchester is meant; it\r\nmay be, however, that some small estate is referred to. In support of\r\nthe latter contention, one might cite Collier's _Memoirs of Edward\r\nAlleyn_, p. 91. Part of the document printed by Collier may have been\r\ntampered with, but there is no reason to suspect the two references to\r\n\"The Parke.\"]\r\n\r\nThis document clearly states that the Globe property was situated to\r\nthe north of Maiden Lane, and consequently near the river. Virtually\r\nall the contemporary maps of London show the Globe as so situated. Mr.\r\nWallace has produced some very specific evidence to support the\r\ndocument cited above, and he claims to have additional evidence as yet\r\nunpublished. On the other hand, there is at least some evidence to\r\nindicate that the Globe was situated to the south of Maiden Lane.[387]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: For the discussions of the subject, see the\r\nBibliography.]\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this book it is sufficient to know that the Globe\r\nwas \"situate in Maiden Lane\"; whether on the north side or the south\r\nside is of less importance. More important is the nature of the site.\r\nStrype, in his edition of Stow's _Survey_, gives this description:\r\n\"Maiden Lane, a long straggling place, with ditches on each side, the\r\npassage to the houses being over little bridges, with little garden\r\nplots before them, especially on the north side, which is best both\r\nfor houses and inhabitants.\" In Maiden Lane, near one of these ditches\r\nor \"sewers,\" the Globe was erected; and like the other houses there\r\nsituated, it was approached over a bridge.[388] In February, 1606,\r\nthe Sewer Commission ordered that \"the owners of the playhouse called\r\nthe Globe, in Maid Lane, shall before the 20 day of April next pull up\r\nand take clean out of the sewer the props or posts which stand under\r\ntheir bridge on the north side of Maid Lane.\"[389] The ground on which\r\nthe building was erected was marshy, and the foundations were made by\r\ndriving piles deep into the soil. Ben Jonson tersely writes:[390]\r\n\r\n     The Globe, the glory of the Bank.... Flanked with a ditch,\r\n     and forced out of a marish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: This was probably not the only means of approach.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: Wallace, in the London _Times_, April 30, 1914, p. 10;\r\n_Notes and Queries_ (XI series), XI, 448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: _An Execration upon Vulcan._]\r\n\r\nInto the construction of the new playhouse went the timber and other\r\nmaterials secured from the old Theatre; but much new material, of\r\ncourse, had to be added. It is a mistake to believe that the Globe was\r\nmerely the old \"Theatre\" newly set up on the Bankside, and perhaps\r\nstrengthened here and there. When it was completed, it was regarded as\r\nthe last word in theatrical architecture. Dekker seems to have had the\r\nGlobe in mind in the following passage: \"How wonderfully is the world\r\naltered! and no marvel, for it has lyein sick almost five thousand\r\nyears: so that it is no more like the old _Theater du munde_, than old\r\nParis Garden is like the King's garden at Paris. What an excellent\r\nworkman therefore were he, that could cast the _Globe_ of it into a\r\nnew mould.\"[391] In 1600 Henslowe and Alleyn used the Globe as\r\nthe model of their new and splendid Fortune. They sought, indeed, to\r\nshow some originality by making their playhouse square instead of\r\nround; but this, the one instance in which they departed from the\r\nGlobe, was a mistake; and when the Fortune was rebuilt in 1623 it was\r\nmade circular in shape.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: _The Guls Hornbook_, published in 1609, but written\r\nearlier.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITES OF THE BEAR GARDEN, THE ROSE, AND THE GLOBE\r\n\r\nMarked by the author on a plan of the Bankside printed in Strype's\r\n_Survey of London_, 1720.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAR GARDEN, THE ROSE, AND THE FIRST GLOBE\r\n\r\nCompare this view of the Bankside with the preceding map. (From an\r\nequestrian portrait of King James I, by Delaram. The city is\r\nrepresented as it was when James came to the throne in 1603.)]\r\n\r\nA few quotations from the Fortune contract will throw some light upon\r\nthe Globe:\r\n\r\n     With such-like stairs, conveyances, and divisions [to the\r\n     galleries], without and within, as are made and contrived in\r\n     and to the late-erected playhouse ... called the Globe.\r\n\r\n     And the said stage to be in all other proportions contrived\r\n     and fashioned like unto the stage of the said playhouse\r\n     called the Globe.\r\n\r\n     And the said house, and other things before mentioned to be\r\n     made and done, to be in all other contrivations,\r\n     conveyances, fashions, thing, and things, effected, finished\r\n     and done according to the manner and fashion of the said\r\n     house called the Globe, saving only that all the principal\r\n     and main posts ... shall be square and wrought pilasterwise,\r\n     with carved proportions called satyrs to be placed and set\r\n     on the top of every of the said posts.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of columns were used in the Globe and how they were\r\nornamented, we do not know, but presumably they were round. Jonson, in\r\n_Every Man Out of His Humour_, presented on the occasion of, or\r\nshortly after, the opening of the Globe in 1599, says of one of his\r\ncharacters: \"A well-timbered fellow! he would have made a good column\r\nan he had been thought on when the house was abuilding.\"[392] That\r\nJonson thought well of the new playhouse is revealed in several\r\nplaces; he speaks with some enthusiasm of \"this fair-fitted\r\nGlobe,\"[393] and in the passage already quoted he calls it \"the glory\r\nof the Bank.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: _Jonson's Works_, ed. Cunningham, I, 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: In the first quarto edition of _Every Man Out of His\r\nHumour_.]\r\n\r\nIn shape the building was unquestionably polygonal or circular, most\r\nprobably polygonal on the outside and circular within. Mr. E.K.\r\nChambers thinks it possible that it was square;[394] but there is\r\nabundant evidence to show that it was not. The very name, Globe, would\r\nhardly be suitable to a square building; Jonson describes the interior\r\nas a \"round\";[395] the ballad on the burning of the house refers to\r\nthe roof as being \"round as a tailor's clew\"; and the New Globe, which\r\ncertainly was not square, was erected on the old foundation.[396] The\r\nframe, we know, was of timber, and the roof of thatch. In front of\r\nthe main door was suspended a sign of Hercules bearing the globe upon\r\nhis shoulders,[397] under which was written, says Malone, the old\r\nmotto, _Totus mundus agit histrionem_.[398]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: _The Stage of the Globe_, p. 356.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: Induction to _Every Man Out of His Humour_ (ed.\r\nCunningham, I, 66).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: I have not space to discuss the question further. The\r\nforeign traveler who visited a Bankside theatre, probably the Globe,\r\non July 3, 1600, described it as \"Theatrum ad morem antiquorum\r\nRomanorum constructum ex lignis\" (London _Times_, April 11, 1914).\r\nThomas Heywood, in his _Apology for Actors_ (1612), describing the\r\nRoman playhouses, says: \"After these they composed others, but\r\ndiffering in form from the theatre or amphitheatre, and every such was\r\ncalled _Circus_, the frame _globe_-like and merely round.\" The\r\nevidence is cumulative, and almost inexhaustible.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: See _Hamlet_, II, ii, 378.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 67.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest representation of the building is probably to be found in\r\nthe Delaram _View of London_ (opposite page 246), set in the\r\nbackground of an engraving of King James on horseback. This view,\r\nwhich presents the city as it was in 1603 when James came to the\r\nthrone, shows the Bear Garden at the left, polygonal in shape, the\r\nRose in the centre, circular in shape, and the Globe at the right,\r\npolygonal in shape. It is again represented in Visscher's magnificent\r\n_View of London_, which, though printed in 1616, presents the city as\r\nit was several years earlier (see page 253). The Merian _View_ of 1638\r\n(opposite page 256) is copied from Visscher, and the _View_ in\r\nHowell's _Londinopolis_ (1657) is merely a slavish copy of Merian;\r\nthese two views, therefore, so far as the Globe is concerned, have no\r\nspecial value.[399]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: The circular playhouse in Delaram's _View_ is commonly\r\naccepted as a representation of the First Globe, but without reason.\r\nThe evidence which establishes the identity of the several playhouses\r\npictured in the various maps of the Bankside comes from a careful\r\nstudy of the Bear Garden, the Hope, the Rose, the First Globe, the\r\nSecond Globe, and their sites, together with a study of all the maps\r\nand views of London, considered separately and in relation to one\r\nanother. Such evidence is too complicated to be given here in full,\r\nbut it is quite conclusive.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST GLOBE\r\n\r\nFrom an old drawing in an extra-illustrated copy of Pennant's _London_\r\nnow in the British Museum. Apparently the drawing is based on Visscher's\r\n_View_.]\r\n\r\nThe cost of the finished building is not exactly known. Mr. Wallace\r\nobserves that it was erected \"at an original cost, according to a\r\nlater statement, of £600, but upon better evidence approximately\r\n£400.\"[400] I am not aware of the \"better evidence\" to which Mr.\r\nWallace refers,[401] nor do I know whether the estimate of £400\r\nincludes the timber and materials of the old Theatre furnished by the\r\nBurbages. If the Theatre of 1576 cost nearly £700, and the second\r\nGlobe cost £1400, the sum of £400 seems too small.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: The London _Times_, October 2, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: Possibly he gives this evidence in his _The Children of\r\nthe Chapel at Blackfriars_, p. 29, note 4.]\r\n\r\nNor do we know exactly when the Globe was finished and opened to the\r\npublic. On May 16, 1599, a post-mortem inquisition of the estate of\r\nSir Thomas Brend, father of Sir Nicholas, was taken. Among his other\r\nproperties in Southwark was listed the Globe playhouse, described as\r\n\"vna domo de novo edificata ... in occupacione Willielmi Shakespeare\r\net aliorum.\"[402] From this statement Mr. Wallace infers that the\r\nGlobe was finished and opened before May 16, 1599. Though this is\r\npossible, the words used seem hardly to warrant the conclusion.\r\nHowever, we may feel sure that the actors, the Lord Chamberlain's Men,\r\nhad moved into the building before the end of the summer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: Wallace, in the London _Times_, May 1, 1914.]\r\n\r\nAlmost at once they rose to the position of leadership in the drama,\r\nfor both Shakespeare and Burbage were now at the height of their\r\npowers. It is true that in 1601 the popularity of the Children at\r\nBlackfriars, and the subsequent \"War of the Theatres\" interfered\r\nsomewhat with their success; but the interference was temporary, and\r\nfrom this time on until the closing of the playhouses in 1642, the\r\nsupremacy of the Globe players was never really challenged. When James\r\ncame to the throne, he recognized this supremacy by taking them under\r\nhis royal patronage. On May 19, 1603, he issued to them a patent to\r\nplay as the King's Men[403]--an honor that was as well deserved as it\r\nwas signal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: Printed in The Malone Society _Collections_, I, 264.]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1608 the proprietors of the Globe acquired the\r\nBlackfriars Theatre for the use of their company during the severe\r\nwinter months. This splendid building, situated in the very heart of\r\nthe city, was entirely roofed in, and could be comfortably heated in\r\ncold weather. Henceforth the open-air Globe was used only during the\r\npleasant season of the year; that is, according to the evidence of the\r\nHerbert Manuscript, from about the first of May until the first of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1613, the Globe caught fire during the performance of a\r\nplay, and was burned to the ground--the first disaster of the sort\r\nrecorded in English theatrical history. The event aroused great\r\ninterest in London, and as a result we have numerous accounts of the\r\ncatastrophe supplying us with full details. We learn that on a warm\r\n\"sunne-shine\" afternoon the large building was \"filled with\r\npeople\"--among whom were Ben Jonson, John Taylor (the Water-Poet), and\r\nSir Henry Wotton--to witness a new play by William Shakespeare and\r\nJohn Fletcher, called _All is True_, or, as we now know it, _Henry\r\nVIII_, produced with unusual magnificence. Upon the entrance of the\r\nKing in the fourth scene of the first act, two cannon were discharged\r\nin a royal salute. One of the cannon hurled a bit of its wadding upon\r\nthe roof and set fire to the thatch; but persons in the audience were\r\nso interested in the play that for a time they paid no attention to\r\nthe fire overhead. As a result they were soon fleeing for their lives;\r\nand within \"one short hour\" nothing was left of the \"stately\" Globe.\r\n\r\nI quote below some of the more interesting contemporary accounts of\r\nthis notable event. Howes, the chronicler, thus records the fact in\r\nhis continuation of Stow's _Annals_:\r\n\r\n     Upon St. Peter's Day last, the playhouse or theatre called\r\n     the Globe, upon the Bankside, near London, by negligent\r\n     discharge of a peal of ordnance, close to the south side\r\n     thereof, the thatch took fire, and the wind suddenly\r\n     dispersed the flames round about, and in a very short space\r\n     the whole building was quite consumed; and no man hurt: the\r\n     house being filled with people to behold the play, _viz._ of\r\n     Henry the Eight.[404]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: Howes's continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (1631), p.\r\n1003.]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Wotton, in a letter to a friend, gives the following gossipy\r\naccount:\r\n\r\n     Now to let matters of state sleep. I will entertain you at\r\n     the present with what happened this week at the Bankside.\r\n     The King's Players had a new play, called _All is True_,\r\n     representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry the\r\n     Eighth, which was set forth with many extraordinary\r\n     circumstances of pomp and majesty, even to the matting of\r\n     the stage; the Knights of the Order with their Georges and\r\n     Garter, the guards with their embroidered coats, and the\r\n     like--sufficient in truth within awhile to make greatness\r\n     very familiar, if not ridiculous. Now King Henry, making a\r\n     masque at the Cardinal Wolsey's house, and certain cannons\r\n     being shot off at his entry, some of the paper or other\r\n     stuff wherewith one of them was stopped, did light on the\r\n     thatch, where being thought at first but an idle smoke, and\r\n     their eyes more attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly,\r\n     and ran round like a train, consuming within less than an\r\n     hour the whole house to the very ground. This was the fatal\r\n     period of that virtuous fabrick; wherein yet nothing did\r\n     perish but wood and straw, and a few forsaken cloaks; only\r\n     one man had his breeches set on fire, that would perhaps\r\n     have broiled him, if he had not, by the benefit of a\r\n     provident wit, put it out with bottle ale.[405]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: _Reliquiæ Wottonianæ_ (ed. 1672), p. 425.]\r\n\r\nJohn Chamberlain, writing to Sir Ralph Winwood, July 8, 1613, refers\r\nto the accident thus:\r\n\r\n     The burning of the Globe or playhouse on the Bankside on St.\r\n     Peter's Day cannot escape you; which fell out by a peal of\r\n     chambers (that I know not upon what occasion were to be used\r\n     in the play), the tampin or stopple of one of them lighting\r\n     in the thatch that cover'd the house, burn'd it down to the\r\n     ground in less than two hours, with a dwelling house\r\n     adjoining; and it was a great marvel and fair grace of God\r\n     that the people had so little harm, having but two narrow\r\n     doors to get out.[406]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: Ralph Winwood, _Memorials of Affairs of State_ (ed.\r\n1725), III, 469.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST GLOBE\r\n\r\nFrom Visscher's _View of London_, published in 1616, but representing\r\nthe city as it was several years earlier.]\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Thomas Lorkin writes from London to Sir Thomas Puckering\r\nunder the date of June 30, 1613:\r\n\r\n     No longer since than yesterday, while Burbage's company were\r\n     acting at the Globe the play of _Henry VIII_, and there\r\n     shooting off certain chambers in way of triumph, the fire\r\n     catched and fastened upon the thatch of the house, and there\r\n     burned so furiously, as it consumed the whole house, all in\r\n     less than two hours, the people having enough to do to save\r\n     themselves.[407]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: Printed in Birch, _The Court and Times of James the\r\nFirst_ (1849), I, 251.]\r\n\r\nA contemporary ballad[408] gives a vivid and amusing account of the\r\ndisaster:\r\n\r\n     _A Sonnet upon the Pitiful Burning of the Globe\r\n     Playhouse in London_\r\n\r\n     Now sit thee down, Melpomene,\r\n     Wrapt in a sea-coal robe,\r\n     And tell the dolefull tragedy\r\n     That late was played at Globe;\r\n     For no man that can sing and say\r\n     Was scared on St. Peter's day.\r\n       _Oh sorrow, pitiful sorrow, and yet all this is true._[409]\r\n\r\n     All you that please to understand,\r\n     Come listen to my story;\r\n     To see Death with his raking brand\r\n     Mongst such an auditory;\r\n     Regarding neither Cardinall's might,\r\n     Nor yet the rugged face of Henry the eight.\r\n       _Oh sorrow_, etc.\r\n\r\n     This fearful fire began above,\r\n     A wonder strange and _true_,\r\n     And to the stage-house did remove,\r\n     As round as taylor's clew,\r\n     And burnt down both beam and snagg,\r\n     And did not spare the silken flagg.\r\n       _Oh sorrow_, etc.\r\n\r\n     Out run the Knights, out run the lords,\r\n     And there was great ado;\r\n     Some lost their hats, and some their swords;\r\n     Then out run Burbage, too.\r\n     The reprobates, though drunk on Monday,\r\n     Prayd for the fool and Henry Condy.\r\n       _Oh sorrow_, etc.\r\n\r\n     The periwigs and drum-heads fry\r\n     Like to a butter firkin;\r\n     A woeful burning did betide\r\n     To many a good buff jerkin.\r\n     Then with swolen eyes, like drunken Flemminges\r\n     Distressed stood old stuttering Heminges.\r\n       _Oh sorrow_, etc.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: Printed by Haslewood in _The Gentleman's Magazine_\r\n(1816), from an old manuscript volume of poems.

I follow Halliwell-Phillipps's text, but\r\nomit the last three stanzas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: Punning on the title _All is True_.]\r\n\r\nBen Jonson, who saw the disaster, left us the following brief account:\r\n\r\n                   The Globe, the glory of the Bank,\r\n     Which, though it were the fort of the whole parish,\r\n     Flanked with a ditch, and forced out of a marish,\r\n     I saw with two poor chambers taken in,\r\n     And razed ere thought could urge this might have been!\r\n     See the world's ruins! nothing but the piles\r\n     Left--and wit since to cover it with tiles.[410]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: _An Execration upon Vulcan._]\r\n\r\nThe players were not seriously inconvenienced, for they could shift to\r\ntheir other house, the Blackfriars, in the city. The owners of the\r\nbuilding, however, suffered a not inconsiderable pecuniary loss. For a\r\ntime they hesitated about rebuilding, one cause of their hesitation\r\nbeing the short term that their lease of the ground had to run.\r\nPossibly a second cause was a doubt as to the ownership of the ground,\r\narising from certain transactions recorded below. In October, 1600,\r\nSir Nicholas Brend had been forced to transfer the Globe estate, with\r\nother adjacent property, to Sir Matthew Brown and John Collett as\r\nsecurity for a debt of £2500; and a few days after he died. Since the\r\nson and heir, Matthew Brend, was a child less than two years old, an\r\nuncle, Sir John Bodley, was appointed trustee. In 1608 Bodley, by\r\nunfair means, it seems, purchased from Collett the Globe property, and\r\nthus became the landlord of the actors. But young Matthew Brend was\r\nstill under age, and Bodley's title to the property was not regarded\r\nas above suspicion.[411]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: These interesting facts were revealed by Mr. Wallace in\r\nthe London _Times_, April 30 and May 1, 1914.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERIAN'S VIEW OF LONDON\r\n\r\nA section from Merian's _View_, showing the Bankside playhouses. This\r\n_View_, printed in Ludvig Gottfried's _Neuwe Archontologia Cosmica_\r\n(Frankfurt am Mayn, 1638), represents London as it was about the year\r\n1612, and was mainly based on Visscher's _View_, with some additions\r\nfrom other sources.]\r\n\r\nFour months after the burning of the Globe, on October 26, 1613, Sir\r\nJohn Bodley granted the proprietors of the building a renewal of the\r\nlease with an extension of the term until December 25, 1635.[412] But\r\na lease from Bodley alone, in view of the facts just indicated, was\r\nnot deemed sufficient; so on February 14, 1614, Heminges, the two\r\nBurbages, and Condell visited the country-seat of the Brends, and\r\nsecured the signature of the young Matthew Brend, and of his mother as\r\nguardian, to a lease of the Globe site with a term ending on December\r\n25, 1644.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: Did he increase the amount of the rental to £25 per\r\nannum? The rent paid for the Blackfriars was £40 per annum; in 1635\r\nthe young actors state that the housekeepers paid for both playhouses\r\n\"not above £65.\"]\r\n\r\nProtected by these two leases, the Globe sharers felt secure; and they\r\nwent forward apace with the erection of their new playhouse. They made\r\nan assessment of \"£50 or £60\" upon each share.[413] Since at this time\r\nthere were fourteen shares, the amount thus raised was £700 or £840.\r\nThis would probably be enough to erect a building as large and as well\r\nequipped as the old Globe. But the proprietors determined upon a\r\nlarger and a very much handsomer building. As Howes, the continuer of\r\nStow's _Annals_, writes, \"it was new builded in far fairer manner than\r\nbefore\"; or as John Taylor, the Water-Poet, puts it:\r\n\r\n     As gold is better that's in fire tried,\r\n     So is the Bankside _Globe_ that late was burn'd.[414]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: _Works_ (1630), p. 31; The Spenser Society reprint, p.\r\n515.]\r\n\r\nNaturally the cost of rebuilding exceeded the original estimate.\r\nHeminges tells us that on one share, or one-fourteenth, he was\r\nrequired to pay for \"the re-edifying about the sum of £120.\"[415]\r\nThis would indicate a total cost of \"about\" £1680. Heminges should\r\nknow, for he was the business manager of the organization; and his\r\ntruthfulness cannot be questioned. Since, however, the adjective\r\n\"about,\" especially when multiplied by fourteen, leaves a generous\r\nmargin of uncertainty, it is gratifying to have a specific statement\r\nfrom one of the sharers in 1635 that the owners had \"been at the\r\ncharge of £1400 in building of the said house upon the burning down of\r\nthe former.\"[416] Heminges tells us that \"he found that the\r\nre-edifying of the said playhouse would be a very great charge,\" and\r\nthat he so \"doubted what benefit would arise thereby\" that he actually\r\ngave away half of one share \"to Henry Condell, _gratis_.\"[417] But his\r\nfears were unfounded. We learn from Witter that after the rebuilding\r\nof the Globe the \"yearly value\" of a share was greater \"by much\" than\r\nit had been before.[418]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 316. This evidence\r\nseems to me unimpeachable. I should add, however, that Mr. Wallace\r\nconsiders the estimate \"excessive,\" and says that he has \"other\r\ncontemporary documents showing the cost was far less than £1400.\" (The\r\nLondon _Times_, October 2, 1909.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n61. There is, I think, no truth in the statement made by the\r\ninaccurate annotator of the Phillipps copy of Stow's _Annals_, that\r\nthe Globe was built \"at the great charge of King James and many\r\nnoblemen and others.\" (See _The Academy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314.)\r\nThe Witter-Heminges documents sufficiently disprove that. We may well\r\nbelieve, however, that the King and his noblemen were interested in\r\nthe new building, and encouraged the actors in many ways.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n70.]\r\n\r\nThe New Globe, like its predecessor, was built of timber,[419] and on\r\nthe same site--indeed the carpenters made use of the old foundation,\r\nwhich seems not to have been seriously injured. In a \"return\" of 1634,\r\npreserved at St. Saviour's, we read: \"The Globe playhouse, near Maid\r\nLane, built by the company of players, with a dwelling house thereto\r\nadjoining, built with timber, about 20 years past, upon an old\r\nfoundation.\"[420] In spite of the use made of the old foundation, the\r\nnew structure was unquestionably larger than the First Globe; Marmion,\r\nin the Prologue to _Holland's Leaguer_, acted at Salisbury Court in\r\n1634, speaks of \"the vastness of the Globe,\" and Shirley, in the\r\nPrologue to _Rosania_, applies the adjective \"vast\" to the building.\r\nMoreover, the builders had \"the wit,\" as Jonson tells us, \"to cover it\r\nwith tiles.\" John Taylor, the Water-Poet, writes:\r\n\r\n     For where before it had a thatched hide,\r\n     Now to a stately theatre is turn'd.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: I see no reason to accept Mr. Wallace's suggestion\r\n(_The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_, p. 34, note 7) that \"it\r\nseems questionable, but not unlikely, that the timber framework was\r\nbrick-veneered and plastered over.\" Mr. Wallace mistakenly accepts\r\nWilkinson's view of the second Fortune as genuine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: Rendle, _Bankside_, p. xvii.]\r\n\r\nThe Second Globe is represented, but unsatisfactorily, in Hollar's\r\n_View of London_, dated 1647 (opposite page 260). It should be noted\r\nthat the artist was in banishment from 1643 (at which time the Globe\r\nwas still standing) until 1652, and hence, in drawing certain\r\nbuildings, especially those not reproduced in earlier views of London,\r\nhe may have had to rely upon his memory. This would explain the\r\ngeneral vagueness of his representation of the Globe.\r\n\r\nThe construction was not hurried, for the players had Blackfriars as a\r\nhome. Under normal conditions they did not move from the city to the\r\nBankside until some time in May; and shortly after that date, in the\r\nearly summer of 1614, the New Globe was ready for them. John\r\nChamberlain writes to Mrs. Alice Carleton on June 30, 1614:\r\n\r\n     I have not seen your sister Williams since I came to town,\r\n     though I have been there twice. The first time she was at a\r\n     neighbor's house at cards, and the next she was gone to the\r\n     New Globe to a play. Indeed, I hear much speech of this new\r\n     playhouse, which is said to be the fairest that ever was in\r\n     England.[421]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: Birch, _The Court and Times of James the First_, I,\r\n329; quoted by Wallace, _The Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars_,\r\np. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECOND GLOBE\r\n\r\nFrom Hollar's _View of London_ (1647).]\r\n\r\nWith this New Globe Shakespeare had little to do, for his career as a\r\nplaywright had been run, and probably he had already retired from\r\nacting. Time, indeed, was beginning to thin out the little band of\r\nfriends who had initiated and made famous the Globe organization.\r\nThomas Pope had died in 1603, Augustine Phillips in 1605, William Slye\r\nin 1608, and, just a few months after the opening of the new\r\nplayhouse, William Osteler, who had been admitted to the\r\npartnership in 1611. He had begun his career as a child-actor at\r\nBlackfriars, had later joined the King's Men, and had married\r\nHeminges's daughter Thomasine.\r\n\r\nA more serious blow to the company, however, fell in April, 1616, when\r\nShakespeare himself died. To the world he had been \"the applause,\r\ndelight, the wonder\" of the stage; but to the members of the Globe\r\nCompany he had been for many years a \"friend and fellow.\" Only Burbage\r\nand Heminges (described in 1614 as \"old Heminges\"), now remained of\r\nthe original venturers. And Burbage passed away on March 13, 1619:\r\n\r\n     He's gone! and with him what a world are dead\r\n     Which he reviv'd--to be revived so\r\n     No more. Young Hamlet, old Hieronimo,\r\n     Kind Lear, the grieved Moor, and more beside\r\n     That lived in him have now for ever died![422]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: From a folio MS. in the Huth Library, printed by J.P.\r\nCollier in _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 411,\r\nand by various others.]\r\n\r\nMany elegies in a similar vein were written celebrating his wonderful\r\npowers as an actor; yet the tribute that perhaps affects us most deals\r\nwith him merely as a man. The Earl of Pembroke, writing to the\r\nAmbassador to Germany, gives the court news about the mighty ones of\r\nthe kingdom: \"My Lord of Lenox made a great supper to the French\r\nAmbassador this night here, and even now all the company are at a\r\nplay; which I, being tender-hearted, could not endure to see so soon\r\nafter the loss of my old acquaintance Burbage.\"[423]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: Printed by Mrs. Stopes, _Burbage and Shakespeare's\r\nStage_, p. 117, with many other interesting references to the great\r\nactor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRADITIONAL SITE OF THE GLOBE\r\n\r\nFrom Wilkinson's _Theatrum Illustrata_ (1825). This site is still\r\nadvocated by some scholars. Compare page 245.]\r\n\r\nIn 1623 Heminges and Condell, with great \"care and paine,\" collected\r\nand published the plays of Shakespeare, \"onely to keep the memory of\r\nso worthy a Friend and Fellow alive\"; and shortly after, they too\r\ndied, Condell in 1627 and Heminges in 1630.\r\n\r\nAfter the passing of this group of men, whose names are so familiar to\r\nus, the history of the playhouse seems less important, and may be\r\nchronicled briefly.\r\n\r\nWhen young Matthew Brend came of age he recovered possession of the\r\nGlobe property by a decree of the Court of Wards. Apparently he\r\naccepted the lease executed by his uncle and guardian, Bodley, by\r\nwhich the actors were to remain in possession of the Globe until\r\nDecember 25, 1635; but in 1633 he sought to cancel the lease he\r\nhimself had executed as a minor, by which the actors were to remain in\r\npossession until 1644. His purpose in thus seeking to gain possession\r\nof the Globe was to lease it to other actors at a material increase in\r\nhis profits.[424] Naturally the owners of the Globe were alarmed, and\r\nthey brought suit in the Court of Requests. In 1635, one of the\r\nsharers, John Shanks, declares that he \"is without any hope to renew\"\r\nthe lease; and he refers thus to the suit against Brend: \"When your\r\nsuppliant purchased his parts [in 1634] he had no certainty thereof\r\nmore than for one year in the Globe, and there was a chargeable suit\r\nthen pending in the Court of Requests between Sir Mathew Brend,\r\nKnight, and the lessees of the Globe and their assigns, for the adding\r\nof nine years to their lease in consideration that their predecessors\r\nhad formerly been at the charge of £1400 in building of the said\r\nhouse.\"[425] The lessees ultimately won their contention, and thus\r\nsecured the right to occupy the Globe until December 25, 1644--a term\r\nwhich, as it happened, was quite long enough, for the Puritans closed\r\nall playhouses in 1642.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: Wallace, \"Shakespeare and the Globe,\" in the London\r\n_Times_, April 30 and May 1, 1914.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: The Petition of the Young Actors, printed by\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 312. Mrs. Stopes, in _Burbage and\r\nShakespeare's Stage_, p. 129, refers to a record of the suit mentioned\r\nby Shanks, dated February 6, 1634.]\r\n\r\nWhat disposition, if any, the sharers made of the Globe between 1642\r\nand 1644 we do not know. But before the lease expired, it seems, Brend\r\ndemolished the playhouse and erected tenements on its site. In the\r\nmanuscript notes to the Phillipps copy of Stow's _Annals_, we find the\r\nstatement that the Globe was \"pulled down to the ground by Sir Mathew\r\nBrend, on Monday the 15 of April, 1644, to make tenements in the room\r\nof it\";[426] and the statement is verified by a mortgage, executed in\r\n1706, between Elizabeth, the surviving daughter and heir of Thomas\r\nBrend, and one William James, citizen of London. The mortgage concerns\r\n\"all those messuages or tenements ... most of which ... were erected\r\nand built where the late playhouse called the Globe stood, and upon\r\nthe ground thereunto belonging.\"[427]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: Printed in _The Academy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314.\r\nShould we read the date as 1644/5?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: William Martin, _The Site of the Globe_, p. 171.]\r\n\r\nAfter this the history of the property becomes obscure. Mrs. Thrale\r\n(later Mrs. Piozzi), the friend of Samuel Johnson, whose residence was\r\nnear by in Deadman's Place, thought that she saw certain \"remains of\r\nthe Globe\" discovered by workmen in the employ of her husband:[428]\r\n\"For a long time, then,--or I thought it such,--my fate was bound up\r\nwith the old Globe Theatre, upon the Bankside, Southwark; the alley it\r\nhad occupied having been purchased and [the tenements] thrown down by\r\nMr. Thrale to make an opening before the windows of our\r\ndwelling-house. When it lay desolate in a black heap of rubbish, my\r\nmother one day in a joke called it the Ruins of Palmyra; and after\r\nthat they had laid it down in a grass-plot Palmyra was the name it\r\nwent by.... But there were really curious remains of the old Globe\r\nPlayhouse, which though hexagonal in form without, was round within.\"\r\nIn spite of serious difficulties in this narrative it is possible that\r\nthe workmen, in digging the ground preparatory to laying out the\r\ngarden, uncovered the foundation of the Globe, which, it will be\r\nrecalled, was formed of piles driven deep into the soil, and so well\r\nmade that it resisted the fire of 1613.[429]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: Printed in _The Builder_, March 26, 1910, from the\r\nConway MSS. in Mrs. Thrale's handwriting.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: For later discoveries of supposed Globe relics, all\r\nvery doubtful, see the London _Times_, October 8, 1909; George\r\nHubbard, _The Site of the Globe Theatre_; and William Martin, _The\r\nSite of the Globe_, p. 201.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time the site of the Globe is covered by the extensive\r\nbrewery of Messrs. Barclay, Perkins, and Company. Upon one of the\r\nwalls of the brewery, on the south side of Park Street, which was\r\nformerly Maiden Lane, has been placed a bronze memorial tablet[430]\r\nshowing in relief the Bankside, with what is intended to be the Globe\r\nPlayhouse conspicuously displayed in the foreground. This is a\r\ncircular building designed after the circular playhouse in the\r\nSpeed-Hondius _View of London_, and represents, as I have tried to\r\nshow, not the Globe, but the Rose. At the left side of the tablet is\r\na bust of the poet modeled after the Droeshout portrait. At the right\r\nis the simple inscription:\r\n\r\n     HERE STOOD THE GLOBE PLAYHOUSE OF SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: The tablet was designed by Dr. William Martin and\r\nexecuted by Professor Lanteri. For photographs of it and of the place\r\nin which it is erected, see _The London Illustrated News_, October 9,\r\n1909, CXXXV, 500.]\r\n\r\nYet it is very doubtful whether the Globe really stood there. Mr.\r\nWallace has produced good evidence to show that the building was on\r\nthe north side of Park Street near the river; and in the course of the\r\npresent study I have found that site generally confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE FORTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe erection of the Globe on the Bankside within a few hundred yards\r\nof the Rose was hardly gratifying to the Admiral's Men. Not only did\r\nit put them in close competition with the excellent Burbage-Shakespeare\r\norganization, but it caused their playhouse (now nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury old, and said to be in a state of \"dangerous decay\") to suffer\r\nin comparison with the new and far handsomer Globe, \"the glory of the\r\nBank.\" Accordingly, before the Globe had been in operation much more\r\nthan half a year, Henslowe and Alleyn decided to move to another\r\nsection of London, and to erect there a playhouse that should surpass\r\nthe Globe both in size and in magnificence. To the authorities,\r\nhowever, they gave as reasons for abandoning the Rose, first, \"the\r\ndangerous decay\" of the building, and secondly, \"for that the same\r\nstandeth very noisome for resort of people in the winter time.\"\r\n\r\nThe new playhouse was undertaken by Henslowe and Alleyn jointly,\r\nalthough the exact arrangement between them is not now clear. Alleyn\r\nseems to have advanced the money and to have held the titles of\r\nownership; but on April 4, 1601, he leased to Henslowe a moiety (or\r\none-half interest) in the playhouse and other properties connected\r\nwith it for a period of twenty-four years at an annual rental of £8--a\r\nsum far below the real value of the moiety.[431]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 25; Wallace, _Three London\r\nTheatres_, p. 53. Later, Alleyn rented to the actors the playhouse\r\nalone for £200 per annum. In the document, Alleyn _v._ William\r\nHenslowe, published by Mr. Wallace in _Three London Theatres_, p. 52,\r\nit is revealed that this annual rental of £8 was canceled by Alleyn's\r\nrental of a house from Henslowe on the Bankside; hence no actual\r\npayments by Henslowe appear in the Henslowe-Alleyn papers.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the details of the arrangement between the two partners, the\r\nmain outlines of their procedure are clear. On December 22, 1599,\r\nAlleyn purchased for £240 a thirty-three-year lease[432] of a plot of\r\nground situated to the north of the city, in the Parish of St. Giles\r\nwithout Cripplegate. This plot of ground, we are told, stood \"very\r\ntolerable, near unto the Fields, and so far distant and remote from\r\nany person or place of account as that none can be annoyed\r\nthereby\";[433] and yet, as the Earl of Nottingham wrote, it was \"very\r\nconvenient for the ease of people.\"[434]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: Later, by a series of negotiations ending in 1610,\r\nAlleyn secured the freehold of the property. The total cost to him was\r\n£800. See Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, pp. 14, 17, 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: _Ibid._, p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: _Ibid._, p. 49; cf. p. 51.]\r\n\r\nThe property thus acquired lay between Golding Lane and Whitecross\r\nStreet, two parallel thoroughfares running north and south. There were\r\ntenements on the edge of the property facing Whitecross Street,\r\ntenements on the edge facing Golding Lane, and an open space between.\r\nAlleyn and Henslowe planned to erect their new playhouse in this open\r\nspace \"between Whitecross Street and Golding Lane,\" and to make \"a way\r\nleading to it\" from Golding Lane. The ground set aside for the\r\nplayhouse is described as \"containing in length from east to west one\r\nhundred twenty and seven feet and a half, a little more or less, and\r\nin breadth, from north to south, one hundred twenty and nine feet, a\r\nlittle more or less.\"[435]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: Collier, _The Alleyn Papers_, p. 98. For a slightly\r\ndifferent measurement of the plot see Collier, _Memoirs of Edward\r\nAlleyn_, p. 167.]\r\n\r\nThe lease of this property having been consummated on December 22,\r\n1599, on January 8, 1600, Henslowe and Alleyn signed a contract with\r\nthe carpenter, Peter Street (who had recently gained valuable\r\nexperience in building the Globe), to erect the new playhouse. The\r\ncontract called for the completion of the building by July 25, 1600,\r\nprovided, however, the workmen were \"not by any authority restrained.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter clause may indicate that Peter Street anticipated\r\ndifficulties. If so, he was not mistaken, for when early in January\r\nhis workmen began to assemble material for the erection of the\r\nbuilding, the authorities, especially those of the Parish of St.\r\nGiles, promptly interfered. Alleyn thereupon appealed to the patron of\r\nthe troupe, the Earl of Nottingham, the Lord Admiral. On January 12,\r\n1600, Nottingham issued a warrant to the officers of the county \"to\r\npermit and suffer my said servant [Edward Alleyn] to proceed in the\r\neffecting and furnishing of the said new house, without any your let\r\nor molestation toward him or any of his workmen.\"[436] This warrant,\r\nhowever, seems not to have prevented the authorities of St. Giles from\r\ncontinuing their restraint. Alleyn was then forced to play his trump\r\ncard--through his great patron to secure from the Privy Council itself\r\na warrant for the construction of the building. First, however, by\r\noffering \"to give a very liberal portion of money weekly\" towards the\r\nrelief of \"the poor in the parish of St. Giles,\" he persuaded many of\r\nthe inhabitants to sign a document addressed to the Privy Council, in\r\nwhich they not only gave their full consent to the erection of the\r\nplayhouse, but actually urged \"that the same might proceed.\"[437] This\r\ndocument he placed in the hands of Nottingham to use in influencing\r\nthe Council. The effort was successful. On April 8 the Council issued\r\na warrant \"to the Justices of the Peace of the County of Middlesex,\r\nespecially of St. Giles without Cripplegate, and to all others whom it\r\nshall concern,\" that they should permit Henslowe and Alleyn \"to\r\nproceed in the effecting and finishing of the same new house.\"[438]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: _Ibid._, p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: _Ibid._, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FORTUNE PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe site of the Fortune is marked by Playhouse Yard, connecting Golden\r\nLane and Whitecross Street. (From Ogilby and Morgan's _Map of London_,\r\n1677.)]\r\n\r\nThis warrant, of course, put an end to all interference by local\r\nauthorities. But as the playhouse reared itself high above the walls\r\nof the city to the north, the Puritans were aroused to action. They\r\nmade this the occasion for a most violent attack on actors and\r\ntheatres in general, and on the Fortune in particular. With this\r\nattack the city authorities, for reasons of their own, heartily\r\nsympathized, but they had no jurisdiction over the Parish of St.\r\nGiles, or over the other localities in which playhouses were situated.\r\nSince the Privy Council had specially authorized the erection of the\r\nFortune, the Lord Mayor shifted the attack to that body, and himself\r\ndispatched an urgent request to the Lords for reformation. In response\r\nto all this agitation the Lords of the Privy Council on June 22, 1600,\r\nissued the following order:\r\n\r\n     Whereas divers complaints have heretofore been made unto the\r\n     Lords and other of Her Majesty's Privy Council of the\r\n     manifold abuses and disorders that have grown and do\r\n     continue by occasion of many houses erected and employed in\r\n     and about London for common stage-plays; and now very lately\r\n     by reason of some complaint exhibited by sundry persons\r\n     against the building of the like house in or near Golding\r\n     Lane ... the Lords and the rest of Her Majesty's Privy\r\n     Council with one and full consent have ordered in manner and\r\n     form as follows. First, that there shall be about the city\r\n     two houses, and no more, allowed to serve for the use of the\r\n     common stage-plays; of the which houses, one [the Globe]\r\n     shall be in Surrey, in that place which is commonly called\r\n     the Bankside or thereabouts, and the other [the Fortune] in\r\n     Middlesex. Secondly, ... it is likewise ordered that the two\r\n     several companies of players assigned unto the two houses\r\n     allowed may play each of them in their several houses twice\r\n     a week and no oftener; and especially that they shall\r\n     refrain to play on the Sabbath day ... and that they shall\r\n     forbear altogether in the time of Lent.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this order, limiting the playhouses and companies to\r\ntwo, was merely a repetition of the order of 1598.[439] It meant that\r\nthe Lords of the Privy Council formally licensed the Admiral's and the\r\nLord Chamberlain's Companies to play in London (of course the Lords\r\nmight, when they saw fit, license other companies for specific\r\nperiods). The second part of the order, limiting the number of\r\nperformances, was more serious, for no troupe could afford to act only\r\ntwice a week. The order if carried out would mean the ruin of the\r\nFortune and the Globe Companies. But it was not carried out. The\r\nactors, as we learn from Henslowe's _Diary_, did not restrict\r\nthemselves to two plays a week. Why, then, did the Lords issue this\r\norder, and why was it not put into effect? A study of the clever way\r\nin which Alleyn, Nottingham, and the Privy Council overcame the\r\nopposition of the puritanical officers of St. Giles who were\r\ninterfering with the erection of the Fortune will suggest the\r\nexplanation. The Lords were making a shrewd move to quiet the noisy\r\nenemies of the drama. They did not intend that the Admiral's and the\r\nChamberlain's Men should be driven out of existence; they were merely\r\nmeeting fanaticism with craft.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: See page 174.]\r\n\r\nAlleyn and Henslowe must have understood this,--possibly they learned\r\nit directly from their patron Nottingham,--for they proceeded with the\r\nerection of their expensive building. The work, however, had been so\r\nseriously delayed by the restraints of the local authorities that the\r\nfoundations were not completed until May 8.[440] On that day\r\ncarpenters were brought from Windsor, and set to the task of erecting\r\nthe frame. Since the materials had been accumulating on the site since\r\nJanuary 17, the work of erection must have proceeded rapidly. The\r\ndaily progress of this work is marked in Henslowe's _Diary_ by the\r\ndinners of Henslowe with the contractor, Peter Street. On August 8,\r\nthese dinners ceased, so that on that date, or shortly after, we may\r\nassume, the building proper was finished.[441]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 158-59.]\r\n\r\nFor erecting the building Street received £440. But this did not\r\ninclude the painting of the woodwork (which, if we may judge from De\r\nWitt's description of the Swan, must have been costly), or the\r\nequipment of the stage. We learn from Alleyn's memoranda that the\r\nfinal cost of the playhouse was £520.[442] Hence, after Street's work\r\nof erection was finished in August, the entire building had to be\r\npainted, and the stage properly equipped with curtains, hangings,\r\nmachines, etc. This must have occupied at least two months. From\r\nHenslowe's _Diary_ it appears that the playhouse was first used about\r\nthe end of November or the early part of December, 1600.[443]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 124.]\r\n\r\nThe original contract of Henslowe and Alleyn with Peter Street for the\r\nerection of the Fortune, preserved among the papers at Dulwich\r\nCollege, supplies us with some very exact details of the size and\r\nshape of the building. Although the document is long, and is couched\r\nin the legal verbiage of the day, it will repay careful study. For the\r\nconvenience of the reader I quote below its main specifications:[444]\r\n\r\n     _Foundation._ A good, sure, and strong foundation, of piles,\r\n     brick, lime, and sand, both without and within, to be\r\n     wrought one foot of assize at the least above the ground.\r\n\r\n     _Frame._ The frame of the said house to be set square, and\r\n     to contain fourscore foot of lawful assize every way square\r\n     without, and fifty-five foot of like assize square every way\r\n     within.\r\n\r\n     _Materials._ And shall also make all the said frame in every\r\n     point for scantlings larger and bigger in assize than the\r\n     scantlings of the said new-erected house called the Globe.\r\n\r\n     _Exterior._ To be sufficiently enclosed without with lath,\r\n     lime, and hair.\r\n\r\n     _Stairs._ With such like stairs, conveyances, and divisions,\r\n     without and within, as are made and contrived in and to the\r\n     late erected playhouse ... called the Globe.... And the\r\n     staircases thereof to be sufficiently enclosed without with\r\n     lath, lime, and hair.\r\n\r\n     _Height of galleries._ And the said frame to contain three\r\n     stories in height; the first, or lower story to contain\r\n     twelve foot of lawful assize in height; the second story\r\n     eleven foot of lawful assize in height; and the third, or\r\n     upper story, to contain nine foot of lawful assize in\r\n     height.\r\n\r\n     _Breadth of galleries._ All which stories shall contain\r\n     twelve foot of lawful assize in breadth throughout. Besides\r\n     a jutty forward in either of the said two upper stories of\r\n     ten inches of lawful assize.\r\n\r\n     _Protection of lowest gallery._ The lower story of the said\r\n     frame withinside ... [to be] paled in below with good,\r\n     strong, and sufficient new oaken boards.... And the said\r\n     lower story to be also laid over and fenced with strong iron\r\n     pikes.\r\n\r\n     _Divisions of galleries._ With four convenient divisions for\r\n     gentlemen's rooms, and other sufficient and convenient\r\n     divisions for two-penny rooms.... And the gentlemen's rooms\r\n     and two-penny rooms to be ceiled with lath, lime, and hair.\r\n\r\n     _Seats._ With necessary seats to be placed and set, as well\r\n     in those rooms as throughout all the rest of the galleries.\r\n\r\n     _Stage._ With a stage and tiring-house to be made, erected,\r\n     and set up within the said frame; with a shadow or cover\r\n     over the said stage. Which stage shall be placed and set (as\r\n     also the staircases of the said frame) in such sort as is\r\n     prefigured in a plot thereof drawn. [The plot has been\r\n     lost.] And which stage shall contain in length forty and\r\n     three foot of lawful assize, and in breadth to extend to\r\n     the middle of the yard of the said house. The same stage to\r\n     be paled in below with good, strong, and sufficient new\r\n     oaken boards.... And the said stage to be in all other\r\n     proportions contrived and fashioned like unto the stage of\r\n     the said playhouse called the Globe.... And the said ...\r\n     stage ... to be covered with tile, and to have a sufficient\r\n     gutter of lead to carry and convey the water from the\r\n     covering of the said stage to fall backwards.\r\n\r\n     _Tiring-house._ With convenient windows and lights, glazed,\r\n     to the said tiring-house.\r\n\r\n     _Flooring._ And all the floors of the said galleries,\r\n     stories, and stage to be boarded with good and sufficient\r\n     new deal boards, of the whole thickness where need shall be.\r\n\r\n     _Columns._ All the principal and main posts of the said\r\n     frame and stage forward shall be square, and wrought\r\n     pilaster-wise, with carved proportions called satyrs to be\r\n     placed and set on the top of every of the said posts.\r\n\r\n     _Roof._ And the said frame, stage, and staircases to be\r\n     covered with tile.\r\n\r\n     _Miscellaneous._ To be in all other contrivations,\r\n     conveyances, fashions, thing and things, effected, finished,\r\n     and done, according to the manner and fashion of the said\r\n     house called the Globe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: For the full document see Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p.\r\n4.]\r\n\r\nIt is rather unfortunate for us that the building was to be in so many\r\nrespects a copy of the Globe, for that deprives us of further detailed\r\nspecifications; and it is unfortunate, too, that the plan or drawing\r\nshowing the arrangement of the stage was not preserved with the rest\r\nof the document. Yet we are able to derive much exact information\r\nfrom the contract; and with this information, at least two modern\r\narchitects have made reconstructions of the building.[445]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: See the Bibliography. A model of the Fortune by Mr.\r\nW.H. Godfrey is preserved in the Dramatic Museum of Columbia\r\nUniversity in New York City, and a duplicate is in the Museum of\r\nEuropean Culture at the University of Illinois. For a description of\r\nthe model see the _Architect and Builders' Journal_ (London), August\r\n16, 1911.]\r\n\r\nNo representation of the exterior of the Fortune has come down to us.\r\nIn the so-called Ryther _Map of London_, there is, to be sure, what\r\nseems to be a crude representation of the playhouse (see page 278);\r\nbut if this is really intended for the Fortune, it does little more\r\nthan mark the location. Yet one can readily picture in his imagination\r\nthe playhouse--a plastered structure, eighty feet square and\r\napproximately forty feet high,[446] with small windows marking the\r\ngalleries, a turret and flagpole surmounting the red-tiled roof, and\r\nover the main entrance a sign representing Dame Fortune:\r\n\r\n     I'le rather stand here,\r\n     Like a statue in the fore-front of your house,\r\n     For ever, like the picture of Dame Fortune\r\n     Before the Fortune Playhouse.[447]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: The three galleries (twelve, eleven, and nine feet,\r\nrespectively) were thirty-two feet in height; but to this must be\r\nadded the elevation of the first gallery above the yard, the space\r\noccupied by the ceiling and flooring of the several galleries, and,\r\nfinally, the roof.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: Thomas Heywood, _The English Traveller_ (1633), ed.\r\nPearson, IV, 84. We do not know when the play was written, but the\r\nreference is probably to the New Fortune, built in 1623. Heywood\r\ngenerally uses \"picture\" in the sense of \"statue.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FORTUNE PLAYHOUSE (?)\r\n\r\nThe curious structure with the flag may be intended to mark the site\r\nof the Fortune. (From the so-called Ryther _Map of London_, drawn\r\nabout 1630-40.)]\r\n\r\nNor is there any pictorial representation of the interior of the\r\nplayhouse. In the absence of such, I offer the reader a verbal picture\r\nof the interior as seen from the stage during the performance of a\r\nplay. In Middleton and Dekker's _The Roaring Girl_, acted at the\r\nFortune, Sir Alexander shows to his friends his magnificent house.\r\nAdvancing to the middle of the stage, and pointing out over the\r\nbuilding, he asks them how they like it:\r\n\r\n     _Goshawk._ I like the prospect best.\r\n\r\n     _Laxton._                           See how 't is furnished!\r\n\r\n     _Sir Davy._ A very fair sweet room.\r\n\r\n     _Sir Alex._                         Sir Davy Dapper,\r\n     The furniture that doth adorn this room\r\n     Cost many a fair grey groat ere it came here;\r\n     But good things are most cheap when they're most dear.\r\n     Nay, when you look into my galleries,\r\n     How bravely they're trimm'd up, you all shall swear\r\n     You're highly pleas'd to see what's set down there:\r\n     Stories of men and women, mix'd together,\r\n     Fair ones with foul, like sunshine in wet weather;\r\n     Within one square a thousand heads are laid,\r\n     So close that all of heads the room seems made;\r\n     As many faces there, fill'd with blithe looks\r\n     Shew like the promising titles of new books\r\n     Writ merrily, the readers being their own eyes,\r\n     Which seem to move and to give plaudities;\r\n     And here and there, whilst with obsequious ears\r\n     Throng'd heaps do listen, a cut-purse thrusts and leers\r\n     With hawk's eyes for his prey; I need not shew him;\r\n     By a hanging, villainous look yourselves may know him,\r\n     The face is drawn so rarely: then, sir, below,\r\n     The very floor, as 't were, waves to and fro,\r\n     And, like a floating island, seems to move\r\n     Upon a sea bound in with shores above.\r\n\r\n     _All._ These sights are excellent![448]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: _The Roaring Girl_, I, i. Pointed out by M.W. Sampson,\r\n_Modern Language Notes_, June, 1915.]\r\n\r\nA closer view of this audience--\"men and women, mix'd together, fair\r\nones with foul\"--is furnished by one of the letters of Orazio\r\nBusino,[449] the chaplain of the Venetian Embassy, who visited the\r\nFortune playhouse shortly after his arrival in London in 1617:\r\n\r\n     The other day, therefore, they determined on taking me to\r\n     one of the many theatres where plays are performed, and we\r\n     saw a tragedy, which diverted me very little, especially as\r\n     I cannot understand a word of English, though some little\r\n     amusement may be derived from gazing at the very costly\r\n     dresses of the actors, and from the various interludes of\r\n     instrumental music and dancing and singing; but the best\r\n     treat was to see such a crowd of nobility so very well\r\n     arrayed that they looked like so many princes, listening as\r\n     silently and soberly as possible. These theatres are\r\n     frequented by a number of respectable and handsome ladies,\r\n     who come freely and seat themselves among the men without\r\n     the slightest hesitation. On the evening in question his\r\n     Excellency [the Venetian Ambassador] and the Secretary were\r\n     pleased to play me a trick by placing me amongst a bevy of\r\n     young women. Scarcely was I seated ere a very elegant dame,\r\n     but in a mask, came and placed herself beside me.... She\r\n     asked me for my address, both in French and English; and on\r\n     my turning a deaf ear, she determined to honour me by\r\n     showing me some fine diamonds on her fingers, repeatedly\r\n     taking off no fewer than three gloves, which were worn one\r\n     over the other.... This lady's bodice was of yellow satin\r\n     richly embroidered, her petticoat of gold tissue with\r\n     stripes, her robe of red velvet with a raised pile, lined\r\n     with yellow muslin, with broad stripes of pure gold. She\r\n     wore an apron of point lace of various patterns; her\r\n     head-tire was highly perfumed, and the collar of white satin\r\n     beneath the delicately-wrought ruff struck me as extremely\r\n     pretty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: \"Diaries and Despatches of the Venetian Embassy at the\r\nCourt of King James I, in the Years 1617, 1618.

It is true that the notice\r\nof this letter in _The Calendar of State Papers, Venetian_, XV, 67,\r\nmakes no mention of the Fortune; but the writer in _The Quarterly\r\nReview_, who had before him the entire manuscript, states positively\r\nthat the Fortune was the playhouse visited. I have not been able to\r\nexamine the manuscript itself, which is preserved in Venice.]\r\n\r\nThat the players were prepared to entertain distinguished visitors\r\nboth during the performance and after is shown by a letter from John\r\nChamberlain, July 21, 1621, to Sir Dudley Carleton. \"The Spanish\r\nAmbassador,\" he writes, \"is grown so affable and familiar, that on\r\nMonday, with his whole train, he went to a common play at the Fortune\r\nin Golding Lane; and the players (not to be overcome with courtesy)\r\nmade him a banquet, when the play was done, in the garden\r\nadjoining.\"[450]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: Nichols, _The Progresses of King James_, IV, 67.]\r\n\r\nUpon its completion the new building was occupied by the Admiral's\r\nMen, for whom it had been erected. This troupe of players, long famous\r\nunder the leadership of Edward Alleyn, was now one of the two\r\ncompanies authorized by the Privy Council, and the chief rival of the\r\nChamberlain's Men at the Globe. Henslowe was managing their affairs,\r\nand numerous poets were writing plays for them. They continued to act\r\nat the Fortune under the name, \"The Admiral's Men,\" until May 5, 1603,\r\nwhen, as Henslowe put it, they \"left off play now at the King's\r\ncoming.\"[451]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, I, 174.]\r\n\r\nAfter a short interruption on account of the plague, during a part of\r\nwhich time they traveled in the provinces, the Admiral's Men were\r\ntaken under the patronage of the youthful Henry, Prince of Wales, and\r\nin the early spring of 1604 they resumed playing at the Fortune under\r\ntheir new name, \"The Prince's Servants.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD ALLEYN\r\n\r\n(Reproduced by permission from a painting in the Dulwich Picture\r\nGallery; photograph by Emery Walker, Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nFor a time all went well. But from July, 1607, until December, 1609,\r\nthe plague was severe in London, and acting was seriously interrupted.\r\nDuring this long period of hardship for the players, Henslowe and\r\nAlleyn seem to have made an attempt to hold the troupe together by\r\nadmitting its chief members to a partnership in the building, just as\r\nthe Burbages had formerly admitted their chief players to a\r\npartnership in the Globe. At this time there were in the troupe eight\r\nsharers, or chief actors.[452] Henslowe and Alleyn, it seems, proposed\r\nto allot to these eight actors one-fourth of the Fortune property. In\r\nother words, according to this scheme, there were to be thirty-two\r\nsharers in the new Fortune organization, Alleyn and Henslowe together\r\nholding three-fourths of the stock, or twelve shares each, and the\r\neight actors together holding one-fourth of the stock, or one share\r\neach. A document was actually drawn up by Henslowe and Alleyn, with\r\nthe name of the leader of the Fortune troupe, Thomas Downton,\r\ninserted;[453] but since the document was not executed, the scheme,\r\nit is to be presumed, was unsuccessful--at least, we hear nothing\r\nfurther about it.[454]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: See the Company's Patent of 1606, in The Malone\r\nSociety's _Collections_, I, 268.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: For an ordinance concerning \"lewd jiggs\" at the Fortune\r\nin 1612, see _Middlesex County Records_, II, 83.]\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1612, the death of the young Prince of Wales left the\r\ncompany without a \"service.\" On January 4, 1613, however, a new patent\r\nwas issued to the players, placing them under the protection of the\r\nPalsgrave, or Elector Palatine, after which date they are known as\r\n\"The Palsgrave's Men.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 9, 1616, Henslowe, so long associated with the company and\r\nthe Fortune, died; and a year later his widow, Agnes, followed him. As\r\na result the entire Fortune property passed into the hands of Alleyn.\r\nBut Alleyn, apparently, did not care to be worried with the management\r\nof the playhouse; so on October 31, 1618, he leased it to the\r\nPalsgrave's Men for a period of thirty-one years, at an annual rental\r\nof £200 and two rundlets of wine at Christmas.[455]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 27; Young, _The History of\r\nDulwich College_, II, 260.]\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1620, Alleyn executed a deed of grant of lands by which\r\nhe transferred the Fortune, along with various other properties, to\r\nDulwich College.[456] But he retained during his lifetime the whole of\r\nthe revenues therefrom, and he specifically reserved to himself the\r\nright to grant leases for any length of years. The transference of\r\nthe title, therefore, in no way affected the playhouse, and Alleyn\r\ncontinued to manage the property as he had been accustomed to do in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: The deed is printed by Young, _op. cit._, I, 50. The\r\nFortune property, I believe, is still a part of the endowment of the\r\ncollege.]\r\n\r\nHis services in this capacity were soon needed, for on December 9,\r\n1621, the Fortune was burned to the ground. Alleyn records the event\r\nin his _Diary_ thus: \"_Memorandum._ This night at 12 of the clock the\r\nFortune was burnt.\" In a less laconic fashion John Chamberlain writes\r\nto Sir Dudley Carleton: \"On Sunday night here was a great fire at the\r\nFortune in Golding-Lane, the fairest playhouse in this town. It was\r\nquite burnt down in two hours, and all their apparel and playbooks\r\nlost, whereby those poor companions are quite undone.\"[457]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: Birch, _The Court and Times of James the First_, II,\r\n280. Howes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (1631), p. 1004,\r\nattributes the fire to \"negligence of a candle,\" but gives no\r\ndetails.]\r\n\r\nThe \"poor companions\" thus referred to were, of course, the players,\r\nwho lost not only their stock of apparel, playbooks, and stage\r\nfurniture, but also their lease, which assured them of a home. Alleyn,\r\nhowever, was quite able and ready to reconstruct the building for\r\nthem; and we find him on May 20, 1621, already organizing a syndicate\r\nto finance \"a new playhouse\" which \"there is intended to be erected\r\nand set up.\" The stock of the new enterprise he divided into twelve\r\nequal shares, which he disposed of, as the custom was, in the form of\r\nwhole and half shares, reserving for himself only one share.[458] The\r\nplot of ground on which the old playhouse stood he leased to the\r\nseveral sharers for a period of fifty-one years at an annual rental of\r\n£10 13_s._ 10_d._ a share, with the express condition that the\r\nbuilding to be erected thereon should never be used for any purpose\r\nother than the acting of stage-plays. The sharers then proceeded to\r\nthe task of constructing their playhouse. It was proposed to make the\r\nnew building larger[459] and handsomer than the old one, and to build\r\nit of brick[460] with a tiled roof--possibly an attempt at fireproof\r\nconstruction. It was decided, also, to abandon the square shape in\r\nfavor of the older and more logical circular shape. Wright, in his\r\n_Historia Histrionica_, describes the New Fortune as \"a large, round,\r\nbrick building,\"[461] and Howes assures us that it was \"farre fairer\"\r\nthan the old playhouse.[462] We do not know how much the building\r\ncost. At the outset each sharer was assessed £83 6_s._ 8_d._ towards\r\nthe cost of construction,[463] which would produce exactly £1000; but\r\nthe first assessment was not necessarily all that the sharers were\r\ncalled upon to pay. For example, when the Globe was rebuilt each\r\nsharer was at first assessed \"£50 or £60,\" but before the building was\r\nfinished each had paid more than £100. So the Fortune may well have\r\ncost more than the original estimate of £1000. In 1656 two expert\r\nassessors appointed by the authorities of Dulwich College to examine\r\nthe playhouse declared that \"the said building did in our opinions\r\ncost building about two thousand pound.\"[464] This estimate is\r\nprobably not far wrong. The playhouse was completed in June or July of\r\n1623, and was again occupied by the Palsgrave's Men.[465]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, pp. 28-30; 112. The names of\r\nthe sharers are not inspiring: Thomas Sparks, merchant tailor; William\r\nGwalter, innholder; John Fisher, barber-surgeon; Thomas Wigpitt,\r\nbricklayer; etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: Prynne, _Histriomastix_, Epistle Dedicatory.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: The writer of the manuscript notes in the Phillipps\r\ncopy of Stow's _Annals_ (see _The Academy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314),\r\nwho is not trustworthy, says that the Fortune was burned down in 1618,\r\nand \"built again with brick work on the outside,\" from which Mr.\r\nWallace assumed that he meant that the building was merely\r\nbrick-veneered. If the writer meant this he was in error. See the\r\nreport of the commission appointed by Dulwich College to examine the\r\nbuilding (Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 95).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: Hazlitt's Dodsley, XV, 408.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: Stow, _Annals_, 1631.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 29. Half-shares were £41\r\n13_s._ 4_d._, which Murray (_English Dramatic Companies_) confuses\r\nwith whole shares.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 95. This estimate was made\r\nafter the interior of the building had been \"pulled down,\" and hence\r\nrefers merely to the cost of erection.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: For an account of \"a dangerous and great riot committed\r\nin Whitecross Street at the Fortune Playhouse\" in May, 1626, see\r\nJeaffreson, _Middlesex County Records_, III, 161-63.]\r\n\r\nOn November 25, 1626, Edward Alleyn died, and the Fortune property\r\ncame into the full possession of Dulwich College. This, however, did\r\nnot in any way affect the syndicate of the Fortune housekeepers, who\r\nheld from Alleyn a lease of the property until 1672. According to the\r\nterms of this lease each of the twelve sharers had to pay a yearly\r\nrental of £10 13_s._ 10_d._; this rental now merely went to the\r\nCollege instead of to Alleyn.\r\n\r\nIn 1631 the Palsgrave's Men seem to have fallen on hard times; at any\r\nrate, they had to give up the Fortune, and the playhouse was taken\r\nover, about December, by the King's Revels, who had been playing at\r\nthe small private playhouse of Salisbury Court.[466] The Palsgrave's\r\nMen were reorganized, taken under the patronage of the infant Prince\r\nCharles, and placed in the Salisbury Court Playhouse just vacated by\r\nthe King's Revels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: For details of this move see the chapter on the\r\nSalisbury Court Playhouse.]\r\n\r\nIn 1635 there was a general shifting of houses on the part of the\r\nLondon companies. The King's Revels left the Fortune and returned to\r\ntheir old quarters at Salisbury Court; the Prince Charles's Men, who\r\nhad been at Salisbury Court, moved to the Red Bull; and the Red Bull\r\nCompany transferred itself to the Fortune.\r\n\r\nThe stay of the Red Bull Company at the Fortune was not happy. Towards\r\nthe end of 1635 the plague was seriously interfering with their\r\nperformance of plays;[467] and on May 10, 1636, the Privy Council\r\nclosed all theatres, and kept them closed, except for a few days,\r\nuntil October 2, 1637.[468] This long inhibition not only impoverished\r\nthe actors and drove them into the country, but came near ruining the\r\nlessees of the Fortune, who, having no revenue from the playhouse,\r\ncould not make their quarterly payments to the College. On September\r\n4, 1637, the Court of Assistants at Dulwich noted that the lessees\r\nwere behind in their rent to the extent of £132 12_s._ 11_d._; \"and,\"\r\nthe court adds, \"there will be a quarter's rent more at Michaelmas\r\nnext [i.e., in twenty-five days], which is doubted will be also\r\nunpaid, amounting to £33 1_s._ 4_d._\"[469] The excuse of the lessees\r\nfor their failure to pay was the \"restraint from playing.\"[470]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: Young, _The History of Dulwich College_, I, 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 391, 392;\r\nMalone, _Variorum_, III, 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: Young, _The History of Dulwich College_, I, 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: The College appealed to the Lord Keeper, who on January\r\n26 ordered the payment of the sum. But two years later, February,\r\n1640, we find the College again petitioning the Lord Keeper to order\r\nthe lessees of the Fortune property to pay an arrearage of £104 14_s._\r\n5_d._ See Collier, _The Alleyn Papers_, pp. 95-98.]\r\n\r\nThis \"restraint\" was removed on October 2, 1637, and the players\r\nresumed their performances at the Fortune. But in the early summer of\r\n1639 they fell victims to another bit of ill luck even more serious\r\nthan their long inhibition. In a letter of Edmond Rossingham, dated\r\nMay 8, 1639, we read: \"Thursday last the players of the Fortune were\r\nfined £1000 for setting up an altar, a bason, and two candlesticks,\r\nand bowing down before it upon the stage; and although they allege it\r\nwas an old play revived, and an altar to the heathen gods, yet it was\r\napparent that this play was revived on purpose in contempt of the\r\nceremonies of the Church.\"[471]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: Printed in _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic,\r\n1639_, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Easter period, 1640, the players returned to their old\r\nquarters at the Red Bull. After their unhappy experiences at the\r\nFortune they were apparently glad to occupy again their former home.\r\nThe event is celebrated in a Prologue entitled _Upon the Removing of\r\nthe Late Fortune Players to the Bull_, written by John Tatham, and\r\nprinted in _Fancies Theatre_ (1640):[472]\r\n\r\n     Here, gentlemen, our anchor's fixt; and we\r\n     Disdaining _Fortune's_ mutability,\r\n     Expect your kind acceptance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: The Prologue is printed in full by Malone, _Variorum_,\r\nIII, 79.]\r\n\r\nThe writer then hurls some uncomplimentary remarks at the Fortune,\r\nobserving complacently: \"We have ne'er an actor here has mouth enough\r\nto tear language by the ears.\" It is true that during these later\r\nyears the Fortune had fallen into ill repute with persons of good\r\ntaste. But so had the Red Bull, and the actors there had no right to\r\nthrow stones. Apparently the large numbers that could be accommodated\r\nin the great public theatres, and the quality of the audience\r\nattracted by the low price of admission, made noise and rant\r\ninevitable.[473] As chief sinners in this respect the Fortune and the\r\nRed Bull are usually mentioned together.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: Not even the Globe was entirely free from this; see the\r\nPrologue to _The Doubtful Heir_.]\r\n\r\nUpon the departure of the Red Bull Company, the Prince Charles's Men\r\n(originally the Admiral's, and later the Palsgrave's Men), who had\r\nbeen occupying the Red Bull, came to the Fortune.[474] Thus after an\r\nabsence of nearly nine years, the old company (though sadly altered in\r\npersonnel), for which the Fortune had been built, returned to its home\r\nto remain there until the end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 79.]\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 1642, the Long Parliament passed an ordinance\r\nsuppressing all stage-plays; but for a time the actors at the Fortune\r\nseem to have continued their performances. In the fifth number of _The\r\nWeekly Account_, September 27-October 4, 1643, we find among other\r\nentries: \"The players' misfortune at the Fortune in Golding Lane,\r\ntheir players' clothes being seized upon in the time of a play by\r\nauthority from the Parliament.\"[475] This, doubtless, led to the\r\nclosing of the playhouse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1643_, p.\r\n564.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Fortune was thus closed, the lessees were in a predicament.\r\nBy a specific clause in their lease they were prevented from using the\r\nbuilding for any purpose other than the acting of stage-plays, and now\r\nParliament by a specific ordinance had forbidden the acting of\r\nstage-plays. Hence the lessees, some of whom were poor persons, being\r\nunable to make any profit from the building, refused to pay any rent.\r\nThe College entered suit against them, and exhausted all legal means\r\nto make them pay, but without success.[476]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: For an interesting comment on the situation, especially\r\nin the year 1649, see _Notes and Queries_ (series X), I, 85.]\r\n\r\nWhen the ordinance prohibiting plays expired in January, 1648, the\r\nactors promptly reopened the Fortune, and we learn from _The Kingdom's\r\nWeekly Intelligencer_ that on January 27 no fewer than one hundred and\r\ntwenty coaches were crowded about the building. But on February 9\r\nParliament passed a new and even more stringent ordinance against\r\ndramatic performances, placing penalties not only upon the players,\r\nbut also upon the spectators. This for ever put an end to acting at\r\nthe Fortune.\r\n\r\nIn 1649 the arrears of the lessees having reached the sum of £974\r\n5_s._ 8_d._, the authorities of the College took formal possession of\r\nthe playhouse.\r\n\r\nFrom certain manuscript notes[477] entered in the Phillipps copy of\r\nStow's _Annals_ (1631), we learn that \"a company of soldiers, set on\r\nby the sectaries of these sad times, on Saturday, the 24 day of March,\r\n1649,\" sacked the Salisbury Court Playhouse, the Phoenix, and the\r\nFortune. The note states that the Fortune was \"pulled down on the\r\ninside by the soldiers\"; that is, the stage and the seats were\r\ndismantled[478] so as to render the building unusable for dramatic\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: Printed in _The Academy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: See _The Journals of the House of Commons_, July 26,\r\n1648.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1650, the inhabitants of the Parish of St.\r\nGiles \"represent that they are poor, and unable to build a place of\r\nworship for themselves, but think it would be convenient if that large\r\nbuilding commonly known by the name of the Fortune Playhouse might be\r\nallotted and set apart for that purpose.\" The request was not\r\ngranted.[479]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: Warner, _Catalogue_, XXXI; Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_,\r\nII, 65.]\r\n\r\nBy July, 1656, the condition of the old playhouse was such that the\r\nMasters and Wardens of the College appointed two experts to view the\r\nbuilding and make recommendations. They reported \"that by reason the\r\nlead hath been taken from the said building, the tiling not secured,\r\nand the foundation of the said playhouse not kept in good repair,\r\ngreat part of the said playhouse is fallen to the ground, the timber\r\nthereof much decayed and rotten, and the brick walls so rent and torn\r\nthat the whole structure is in no condition capable of repair, but in\r\ngreat danger of falling, to the hazard of passengers' lives\"; and they\r\nadd: \"The charge for demolishing the same will be chargeable and\r\ndangerous. Upon these considerations our opinion is that the said\r\nmaterials may not be more worth than eighty pound.\"[480]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: The entire report is printed in Greg, _Henslowe\r\nPapers_, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Dulwich took no action on this report. However, on\r\nMarch 5, 1660, they ordered that the property be leased, making a\r\ncasual reference to the playhouse as \"at present so ruinous that part\r\nthereof is already fallen down, and the rest will suddenly follow.\"\r\nAccordingly, they inserted in the _Mercurius Politicus_ of February\r\n14-21, 1661, the following advertisement: \"The Fortune Playhouse,\r\nsituate between Whitecross Street and Golding Lane, in the parish of\r\nSt. Giles, Cripplegate, with the ground thereto belonging, is to be\r\nlet to be built upon.\"[481]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: Discovered by Stevens, and printed in Malone,\r\n_Variorum_, III, 55, note 5. Mr. W.J. Lawrence, _Archiv für das\r\nStudium der Neueren Sprachen und Literaturen_ (1914), p. 314, says\r\nthat the date of this advertisement is 1660. But the same\r\nadvertisement is reprinted by H.R. Plomer in _Notes and Queries_\r\n(series X), VI, 107, from _The Kingdom's Intelligencer_ of March 18,\r\n1661.]\r\n\r\nNo one seems to have cared to lease the property; so on March 16,\r\nfollowing, the materials of the building were sold to one William\r\nBeaven for the sum of £75;[482] and in the records of the College,\r\nMarch 4, 1662, we read that \"the said playhouse ... is since totally\r\ndemolished.\"[483]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: Young, _The History of Dulwich College_, II, 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: Collier, _The Alleyn Papers_, p. 101. I am aware of the\r\nfact that there are references to later incidents at the Fortune (for\r\nexample, the statement that it was visited by officers in November,\r\n1682, in an attempt to suppress secret conventicles that had long been\r\nheld there), but in view of the unimpeachable documentary evidence\r\ncited above (in 1662 the College authorities again refer to it as \"the\r\nlate ruinous and now demolished Fortune playhouse\"), we must regard\r\nthese later references either as inaccurate, or as referring to\r\nanother building later erected in the same neighborhood. The so-called\r\npicture of the Fortune, printed in Wilkinson's _Londina Illustrata_,\r\nand often reproduced by modern scholars, cannot possibly be that of\r\nthe playhouse erected by Alleyn. For an interesting surmise as to the\r\nhistory of this later building see W.J. Lawrence, _Restoration Stage\r\nNurseries_, in _Archiv für das Studium der Neueren Sprachen und\r\nLiteraturen_ (1914), p. 301.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE RED BULL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe builder of the Red Bull Playhouse[484] was \"one Aaron Holland,\r\nyeoman,\" of whom we know little more than that he \"was utterly\r\nunlearned and illiterate, not being able to read.\"[485] He had leased\r\n\"for many years\" from Anne Beddingfield, \"wife and administratrix of\r\nthe goods and chattles of Christopher Beddingfield, deceased,\" a small\r\nplot of land, known by the name of \"The Red Bull.\" This plot of land,\r\nwhich contained one house, was situated \"at the upper end of St.\r\nJohn's Street\" in the Parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, the exact\r\nlocation being marked by \"Red Bull Yard\" in Ogilby and Morgan's _Map\r\nof London_, printed in 1677. The property was not much more distant\r\nfrom the heart of the city than the Fortune property, and since it\r\ncould be easily reached through St. John's Gate, it was quite as well\r\nsituated for dramatic purposes as was the Fortune.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: This playhouse is not to be confused with the famous\r\nBull Tavern in Bishopsgate Street, for many years used as a theatre.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: These statements are based upon the Woodford _v._\r\nHolland documents, first discovered by Collier, later by Greenstreet,\r\nand finally printed in full by Wallace, _Three London Theatres_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE RED BULL PLAYHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe site is indicated by Red Bull Yard. (From Ogilby and Morgan's _Map\r\nof London_, 1677.)]\r\n\r\nIn or before 1605[486] Holland erected on this plot of ground \"a\r\nplayhouse for acting and setting forth plays, comedies, and\r\ntragedies.\" We may suspect that he did this at the instigation of the\r\nEarl of Worcester's Men, who had just been taken under the patronage\r\nof the Queen, and had been selected by the Privy Council as one of\r\nthree companies to be \"allowed.\" The warrant of the Privy Council,\r\nApril 9, 1604, orders the Lord Mayor to \"permit and suffer the three\r\ncompanies of players to the King, Queen, and Prince publickly to\r\nexercise their plays in their several and usual houses for that\r\npurpose, and no other, viz. the Globe, situate in Maiden Lane on the\r\nBankside in the county of Surrey, the Fortune in Golding Lane, and the\r\nCurtain, in Holywell.\"[487] Among these three companies, as Dekker\r\ntells us, there was much rivalry.[488] No doubt the Queen's Men,\r\nforced to occupy the old Curtain Playhouse, suffered by comparison\r\nwith the King's Men at the handsome Globe, and the Prince's Men at the\r\nnew and magnificent Fortune; and this, I suspect, furnished the\r\nimmediate cause for the erection of the Red Bull. In a draft of a\r\nlicense to the Queen's Men, made late in 1603 or early in 1604, the\r\nfact is disclosed that the actors, of whom Thomas Greene was the\r\nleader, were contemplating a new playhouse. The company was licensed\r\nto use any \"playhouse not used by others, by the said Thomas Greene\r\nelected, _or by him hereafter to be built_.\"[489] Whether or no Greene\r\nand his fellows had some understanding with Holland, we cannot say.\r\nBut in 1605 we find Holland disposing of one share in the new\r\nplayhouse to Thomas Swynnerton, a member of Queen Anne's Troupe; and\r\nhe may at the same time have disposed of other shares to other\r\nmembers, for his transaction with Swynnerton comes to our notice only\r\nthrough a subsequent lawsuit. The words used in the documents\r\nconnected with the suit clearly suggest that the playhouse was\r\ncompleted at the time of the purchase. From the fact that Holland\r\ngranted \"a seventh part of the said playhouse and galleries, with a\r\ngatherer's place thereto belonging or appertaining, unto the said\r\nThomas Swynnerton for diverse years,\"[490] it appears that the\r\nownership of the playhouse had been divided into seven shares, some of\r\nwhich, according to custom, may have been subdivided into half-shares.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: Sir Sidney Lee (_A Life of William Shakespeare_, p. 60)\r\nsays that the Red Bull was \"built about 1600.\" He gives no evidence,\r\nand the statement seems to be merely a repetition from earlier and\r\nunauthoritative writers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: The original warrant is preserved at Dulwich, and\r\nprinted by Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 61. Cf. also Dasent, _Acts of\r\nthe Privy Council_, XXXII, 511.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: _Raven's Almanack_ (1609); Dekker's _Works_ (ed.\r\nGrosart), IV, 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: Wallace, _Three London Theatres_, p. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe name of the playhouse, as in the case of the Rose and the Curtain,\r\nwas taken from the name of the estate on which it was erected. Of the\r\nbuilding we have no pictorial representation; the picture in Kirkman's\r\n_The Wits_ (1672), so often reproduced by scholars as \"The Interior\r\nof the Red Bull,\" has nothing whatever to do with that building. The\r\nKirkman picture shows a small enclosed room, with a narrow stage\r\nilluminated by chandeliers and footlights; the Red Bull, on the\r\ncontrary, was a large, open-air building, with its stage illuminated\r\nby the sun. It is thus described in Wright's _Historia Histrionica_\r\n(1699): \"The Globe, Fortune, and Bull were large houses, and lay\r\npartly open to the weather.\"[491] Before its door was displayed a sign\r\non which was painted a red bull; hence the playhouse is sometimes\r\nreferred to simply as \"at the sign of the Red Bull.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: Hazlitt's Dodsley, XV, 408. If the Kirkham picture\r\nrepresents the interior of any playhouse, it more likely represents\r\nthe Cockpit, which was standing at the time of the Restoration.]\r\n\r\nThe building, as I have indicated, seems to have been completed in or\r\nbefore 1605; but exactly when the Queen's Men moved thither from the\r\nCurtain is not clear. The patent issued to the company on April 15,\r\n1609, gives them license to play \"within their now usual houses,\r\ncalled the Red Bull in Clerkenwell, and the Curtain in Holywell.\"[492]\r\nSince they would hardly make use of two big public playhouses at the\r\nsame time, we might suspect that they were then arranging for the\r\ntransfer. Moreover, Heath, in his _Epigrams_, printed in 1610 but\r\nprobably written a year or two earlier, refers to the three important\r\npublic playhouses of the day as the Globe, the Fortune, and the\r\nCurtain. Yet, that the Queen's Men were playing regularly at the Red\r\nBull in 1609 is clear from Dekker's _Raven's Almanack_,[493] and they\r\nmay have been playing there at intervals after 1605.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: Dekker's _Works_ (ed. Grosart), IV, 210-11. I cannot\r\nunderstand why Murray (_English Dramatic Companies_, I, 152-53) and\r\nothers say that Dekker refers to the Fortune, the Globe, and the\r\nCurtain. His puns are clear: \"_Fortune_ must favour some ... the\r\n_whole world_ must stick to others ... and a third faction must fight\r\nlike _Bulls_.\"]\r\n\r\nDekker, in the pamphlet just mentioned, predicted \"a deadly war\"\r\nbetween the Globe, the Fortune, and the Red Bull. And he had good\r\nreasons for believing that the Queen's Men could successfully compete\r\nwith the two other companies, for it numbered among its players some\r\nof the best actors of the day. The leader of the troupe was Thomas\r\nGreene, now chiefly known for the amusing comedy named, after him,\r\n_Greene's Tu Quoque_, but then known to all Londoners as the cleverest\r\ncomedian since Tarleton and Kempe:\r\n\r\n     _Scat._ Yes, faith, brother, if it please you; let's go see\r\n     a play at the Globe.\r\n\r\n     _But._ I care not; any whither, so the clown have a part;\r\n     for, i' faith, I am nobody without a fool.\r\n\r\n     _Gera._ Why, then, we'll go to the Red Bull; they say\r\n     Green's a good clown.[494]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: _Greene's Tu Quoque_, Hazlitt's Dodsley, XI, 240. In\r\nMay, 1610, there was \"a notable outrage at the Playhouse called the\r\nRed Bull\"; see _Middlesex County Records_, II, 64-65.]\r\n\r\nThe chief playwright for the troupe was the learned and industrious\r\nThomas Heywood, who, like Shakespeare, was also an actor and full\r\nsharer in his company. Charles Lamb, who was an ardent admirer of\r\nHeywood's plays, enthusiastically styled him \"a prose Shakespeare\";\r\nand Wordsworth, with hardly less enthusiasm, declared him to have been\r\n\"a great man.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1612 Thomas Greene died, and the leadership of the troupe was taken\r\nover by Christopher Beeston, a man well known in the theatrical life\r\nof the time. Late in February, 1617, Beeston transferred the Queen's\r\nMen to his new playhouse in Drury Lane, the Cockpit; in little more\r\nthan a week the sacking of the Cockpit drove them back to their old\r\nquarters, where they remained until the following June. But even after\r\nthis they seem not to have abandoned the Red Bull entirely.\r\n\r\nEdward Alleyn, in his _Account Book_, writes: \"Oct. 1, 1617, I came to\r\nLondon in the coach and went to the Red Bull\"; and again under the\r\ndate of October 3: \"I went to the Red Bull, and received for _The\r\nYounger Brother_ but £3 6_s._ 4_d._\"[495] What these two passages mean\r\nit is hard to say, for they constitute the only references to the Red\r\nBull in all the Alleyn papers; but they do not necessarily imply, as\r\nsome have thought, that Alleyn was part owner of the playhouse;\r\npossibly he was merely selling to the Red Bull Company the manuscript\r\nof an old play.[496]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 495: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 223; Young, _The History of\r\nDulwich College_, II, 51; Warner, _Catalogue_, p. 165; Collier,\r\n_Memoirs of Edward Alleyn_, p. 107.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: The play is not otherwise known; a play with this\r\ntitle, however, was entered on the Stationers' Register in 1653.]\r\n\r\nAt the death of Queen Anne, March 2, 1619, the company was deprived of\r\nits \"service,\" and after attending her funeral on May 13, was\r\ndissolved. Christopher Beeston joined Prince Charles's Men, and\r\nestablished that troupe at the Cockpit;[497] the other leading members\r\nof Queen Anne's Men seem to have continued at the Red Bull under the\r\nsimple title \"The Red Bull Company.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: For details of this change, and of the quarrels that\r\nfollowed, see the chapter on the Cockpit.]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1622, a feltmaker's apprentice named John Gill,[498] while\r\nseated on the Red Bull stage, was accidentally injured by a sword in\r\nthe hands of one of the actors, Richard Baxter. A few days later Gill\r\ncalled upon his fellow-apprentices to help him secure damages. In the\r\nforenoon he sent the following letter, now somewhat defaced by time,\r\nto Baxter:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Blackster [_sic_]. So it is that upon Monday last it ...\r\n     to be upon your stage, intending no hurt to any one, where I\r\n     was grievously wounded in the head, as may appear; and in\r\n     the surgeon's hands, who is to have x_s._ for the cure; and\r\n     in the meantime my Master to give me maintenance ... [to my]\r\n     great loss and hindrance; and therefore in kindness I desire\r\n     you to give me satisfaction, seeing I was wounded by your\r\n     own hand ... weapon. If you refuse, then look to yourself\r\n     and avoid the danger which shall this day ensue upon your\r\n     company and house. For ... as you can, for I am a\r\n     feltmaker's prentice, and have made it known to at least one\r\n     hundred and forty of our ... who are all here present, ready\r\n     to take revenge upon you unless willingly you will give\r\n     present satisfaction. Consider there ... think fitting. And\r\n     as you have a care for your own safeties, so let me have\r\n     answer forthwith.[499]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: The name is also given, incorrectly, as Richard Gill.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: Jeaffreson, _Middlesex County Records_, II, 165-66;\r\n175-76.]\r\n\r\nBaxter turned the letter over to the authorities of Middlesex (hence\r\nits preservation), who took steps to guard the playhouse and actors.\r\nThe only result was that prentices \"to the number of one hundred\r\npersons on the said day riotously assembled at Clerkenwell, to the\r\nterror and disquiet of persons dwelling there.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1622, the Red Bull Company secured a license \"to bring up\r\nchildren in the quality and exercise of playing comedies, histories,\r\ninterludes, morals, pastorals, stage-plays and such like ... to be\r\ncalled by the name of the Children of the Revels.\"[500] The Children\r\nof the Revels occupied the Red Bull until the summer of the following\r\nyear, 1623, when they were dissolved. The last reference to them is in\r\nthe Herbert Manuscript under the date of May 10, 1623.[501]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 500: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 62; The Malone Society's\r\n_Collections_, I, 284.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: Chalmers, _Supplemental Apology_, p. 213.]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1623, we find the Red Bull occupied by Prince Charles's\r\nMen,[502] who, after the dissolution of the Revels Company, had moved\r\nthither from the less desirable Curtain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: _Ibid._, pp. 213-14.]\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1625, Prince Charles became King, and took under\r\nhis patronage his father's troupe, the King's Men. Some of the\r\nmembers of the Prince Charles Troupe were transferred to the King's\r\nMen, and the rest constituted a nucleus about which a new company was\r\norganized, known simply as \"The Red Bull Company.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time, it seems, the playhouse was rebuilt and enlarged. The\r\nFortune had been destroyed by fire in 1621, and had just been rebuilt\r\nin a larger and handsomer form. In 1625 one W.C., in _London's\r\nLamentation for her Sins_, writes: \"Yet even then, Oh Lord, were the\r\ntheatres magnified and enlarged.\"[503] This doubtless refers to the\r\nrebuilding of the Fortune and the Red Bull. Prynne specifically states\r\nin his _Histriomastix_ (1633) that the Fortune and Red Bull had been\r\n\"lately reedified [and] enlarged.\" But nothing further is known of the\r\n\"re-edification and enlargement\" of the Red Bull.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: Quoted by Collier, _The History of English Dramatic\r\nPoetry_ (1879), III, 121.]\r\n\r\nAfter its enlargement the playhouse seems to have acquired a\r\nreputation for noise and vulgarity. Carew, in 1630, speaks of it as a\r\nplace where \"noise prevails\" and a \"drowth of wit,\" and yet as always\r\ncrowded with people while the better playhouses stood empty. In _The\r\nCareless Shepherdess_, acted at Salisbury Court, we read:\r\n\r\n     And I will hasten to the money-box,\r\n     And take my shilling out again;\r\n     I'll go to the Bull, or Fortune, and there see\r\n     A play for two-pence, and a jig to boot.[504]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 70.]\r\n\r\nIn 1638, a writer of verses prefixed to Randolph's _Poems_ speaks of\r\nthe \"base plots\" acted with great applause at the Red Bull.[505] James\r\nWright informs us, in his _Historia Histrionica_, that the Red Bull\r\nand the Fortune were \"mostly frequented by citizens and the meaner\r\nsort of people.\"[506] And Edmund Gayton, in his _Pleasant Notes_,\r\nwittily remarks: \"I have heard that the poets of the Fortune and Red\r\nBull had always a mouth-measure for their actors (who were terrible\r\ntear-throats) and made their lines proportionable to their compass,\r\nwhich were sesquipedales, a foot and a half.\"[507] Probably the ill\r\nrepute of the large public playhouses at this time was chiefly due to\r\nthe rise of private playhouses in the city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: Randolph's _Works_ (ed. Hazlitt), p. 504.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: Hazlitt's Dodsley, XV, 407.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: _Pleasant Notes on Don Quixote_, p. 24.]\r\n\r\nIn 1635 the Red Bull Company moved to the Fortune, and Prince\r\nCharles's Men occupied the Red Bull.\r\n\r\nFive years later, at Easter, 1640, Prince Charles's Men moved back to\r\nthe Fortune, and the Red Bull Company returned to its old home. In a\r\nprologue written to celebrate the event,[508] the members of the\r\ncompany declared:\r\n\r\n     Here, gentlemen, our anchor's fix't.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: J. Tatham, _Fancies Theatre_. For a fuller discussion\r\nof the shifting of companies in 1635 and 1640 see the chapter on \"The\r\nFortune.\"]\r\n\r\nThis proved true, for the company remained at the Red Bull until\r\nParliament passed the ordinance of 1642 closing the playhouses and\r\nforbidding all dramatic performances. The ordinance, which was to hold\r\ngood during the continuance of the civil war, was renewed in 1647,\r\nwith January 1, 1648, set as the date of its expiration. Through some\r\noversight a new ordinance was not immediately passed, and the actors\r\nwere prompt to take advantage of the fact. They threw open the\r\nplayhouses, and the Londoners flocked in great crowds to hear plays\r\nagain. At the Red Bull, so we learn from the newspaper called _Perfect\r\nOccurrences_, was given a performance of Beaumont and Fletcher's _Wit\r\nWithout Money_.\r\n\r\nBut on February 9, 1648, Parliament made up for its oversight by\r\npassing an exceptionally severe ordinance against dramatic\r\nexhibitions, directing that actors be publicly flogged, and that each\r\nspectator be fined the sum of five shillings.\r\n\r\nDuring the dark years that followed, the Red Bull, in spite of this\r\nordinance, was occasionally used by venturous actors. James Wright, in\r\nhis _Historia Histrionica_, tells us that upon the outbreak of the war\r\nthe various London actors had gone \"into the King's army, and, like\r\ngood men and true, served their old master, though in a different, yet\r\nmore honourable capacity. Robinson was killed at the taking of a place\r\n(I think Basing House) by Harrison.... Mohun was a captain.... Hart\r\nwas cornet of the same troop, and Shatterel quartermaster. Allen, of\r\nthe Cockpit, was a major.... The rest either lost or exposed their\r\nlives for their king.\"[509] He concludes the narrative by saying that\r\nwhen the wars were over, those actors who were left alive gathered to\r\nLondon, \"and for a subsistence endeavoured to revive their old trade\r\nprivately.\" They organized themselves into a company in 1648 and\r\nattempted \"to act some plays with as much caution and privacy as could\r\nbe at the Cockpit\"; but after three or four days they were stopped by\r\nsoldiers. Thereafter, on special occasions \"they used to bribe the\r\nofficer who commanded the guard at Whitehall, and were thereupon\r\nconnived at to act for a few days at the Red Bull, but were sometimes,\r\nnotwithstanding, disturbed by soldiers.\"[510] To such clandestine\r\nperformances Kirkman refers in his Preface to _The Wits, or Sport upon\r\nSport_ (1672): \"I have seen the Red Bull Playhouse, which was a large\r\none, so full that as many went back for want of room as had entered;\r\nand as meanly as you may now think of these drolls, they were then\r\nacted by the best comedians then and now in being.\" Not, however,\r\nwithout occasional trouble. In Whitelocke's _Memorials_, p. 435, we\r\nread: \"20 Dec., 1649. Some stage-players in St. John's Street were\r\napprehended by troopers, their clothes taken away, and themselves\r\ncarried to prison\"; again, in _The Perfect Account_, December\r\n27-January 3, 1654-1655: \"Dec. 30, 1654.--This day the players at the\r\nRed Bull, being gotten into all their borrowed gallantry and ready to\r\nact, were by some of the soldiery despoiled of all their bravery; but\r\nthe soldiery carried themselves very civilly towards the\r\naudience.\"[511] In the _Weekly Intelligencer_, September 11-18, 1655,\r\nwe find recorded still another sad experience for the actors: \"Friday,\r\nSeptember 11, 1655.--This day proved tragicall to the players at the\r\nRed Bull; their acting being against the Act of Parliament, the\r\nsoldiers secured the persons of some of them who were upon the stage,\r\nand in the tiring-house they seized also upon their clothes in which\r\nthey acted, a great part whereof was very rich.\"[512]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: Hazlitt's Dodsley, XV, 409.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: _Ibid._, 409-10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: Cited by C.H. Firth, in _Notes and Queries_, August 18,\r\n1888, series VII, vol. VI, p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, however, the soldiers, instead of carrying\r\nthemselves \"very civilly\" towards the audience, undertook to exact\r\nfrom each of the spectators the fine of five shillings. The ordinance\r\nof Parliament, passed February 9, 1648, read: \"And it is hereby\r\nfurther ordered and ordained, that every person or persons which shall\r\nbe present and a spectator at such stage-play or interlude, hereby\r\nprohibited, shall for every time he shall be present, forfeit and pay\r\nthe sum of five shillings to the use of the poor of the parish.\"[513]\r\nBut the spectators did not submit to this fine without a struggle.\r\nJeremiah Banks wrote to Williamson on September 16, 1655: \"At the\r\nplayhouse this week many were put to rout by the soldiers and had\r\nbroken crowns; the corporal would have been entrapped had he not been\r\nvigilant.\"[514] And in the _Weekly Intelligencer_, September 11-18, we\r\nread: \"It never fared worse with the spectators than at this present,\r\nfor those who had monies paid their five shillings apiece; those who\r\nhad none, to satisfy their forfeits, did leave their cloaks behind\r\nthem. The Tragedy of the spectators was the Comedy of the soldiers.\r\nThere was abundance of the female sex, who, not able to pay five\r\nshillings, did leave some gage or other behind them, insomuch that\r\nalthough the next day after the Fair was expected to be a new fair of\r\nhoods, of aprons, and of scarfs; all which, their poverty being made\r\nknown, and after some check for their trespass, were civilly again\r\nrestored to the owners.\"[515]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: Hazlitt, _The English Drama and Stage_, p. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1655_, p.\r\n336.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: For a further account of this episode see _Mercurius\r\nFumigosus_, No. 69.]\r\n\r\nAt the period of the Restoration the Red Bull was among the first\r\nplayhouses to reopen. John Downes, in his _Roscius Anglicanus_,\r\nwrites: \"The scattered remnant of several of these houses, upon King\r\nCharles' Restoration, framed a company, who acted again at the\r\nBull.\"[516] Apparently the company was brought together by the famous\r\nold Elizabethan actor, Anthony Turner. From the _Middlesex County\r\nRecords_ (III, 279) we learn that at first the players were\r\ninterrupted by the authorities:\r\n\r\n     12 May, 1659.--Recognizances, taken before Ra: Hall, esq.\r\n     J.P., of William Wintershall and Henry Eaton, both of\r\n     Clerkenwell, gentlemen, in the sum of fifty pounds each;\r\n     \"Upon condition that Antony Turner shall personally appear\r\n     at the next Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden at\r\n     Hicks Hall for the said County of Middlesex; for the\r\n     unlawful maintaining of stage-plays and interludes at the\r\n     Red Bull in St. John's Street, which house he affirms that\r\n     they hire of the parishioners of Clerkenwell at the rate of\r\n     twenty shillings a day over and above what they have agreed\r\n     to pay towards the relief of their poor and repairing their\r\n     highways, and in the meantime to be of good behaviour and\r\n     not to depart the Court without license.--Ra: Hall.\" Also\r\n     similar Recognizances, taken on the same day, before the\r\n     same J.P., of the same William Wintershall and Henry Eaton,\r\n     gentlemen, in the same sum of fifty pounds each; for the\r\n     appearance of Edward Shatterall at the next. Q.S.P. for\r\n     Middlesex at Hicks Hall, \"to answer for the unlawful\r\n     maintaining of stage-plays and interludes at the Red Bull in\r\n     St. John's Street &c.\" S.P.R., 17, May, 1659.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: Cf. Wright, _Historia Histrionica_, p. 412; and for the\r\ngeneral history of the actors at the Red Bull during this period see\r\nthe Herbert records in Halliwell-Phillipps, _A Collection of Ancient\r\nDocuments_.]\r\n\r\nLater, it seems, they secured a license from the authorities, and\r\nthenceforth acted without interruption. Samuel Pepys made plans \"to go\r\nto the Red Bull Playhouse\" with Mrs. Pierce and her husband on August\r\n3, 1660, but was prevented by business. An account of his visit there\r\non March 23, 1661, is thus given in his _Diary_:\r\n\r\n     All the morning at home putting papers in order; dined at\r\n     home, and then out to the Red Bull (where I had not been\r\n     since plays came up again), but coming too soon I went out\r\n     again and walked up and down the Charterhouse Yard and\r\n     Aldersgate Street. At last came back again and went in,\r\n     where I was led by a seaman that knew me, but is here as a\r\n     servant, up to the tiring-room, where strange the confusion\r\n     and disorder that there is among them in fitting themselves,\r\n     especially here, where the clothes are very poor and the\r\n     actors but common fellows. At last into the pit, where I\r\n     think there was not above ten more than myself, and not one\r\n     hundred in the whole house. And the play, which is called\r\n     _All's Lost by Lust_, poorly done; and with so much\r\n     disorder, among others, that in the musique-room, the boy\r\n     that was to sing a song not singing it right, his master\r\n     fell about his ears and beat him so, that it put the whole\r\n     house in an uproar.\r\n\r\nThe actors, however, did not remain long at the Red Bull. They built\r\nfor themselves a new theatre in Drury Lane, whither they moved on\r\nApril 8, 1663;[517] and after this the old playhouse was deserted. In\r\nDavenant's _The Play-House to Be Let_ (1663), I, i, we read:\r\n\r\n     Tell 'em the Red Bull stands empty for fencers:[518]\r\n     There are no tenants in it but old spiders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: After November 8, 1660, they acted also in Gibbon's\r\nTennis Court in Clare Market, which they had fitted up as a theatre;\r\nsee Halliwell-Phillipps, _A Collection of Ancient Documents_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: See Pepys' _Diary_, April 25, 1664.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWHITEFRIARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district of Whitefriars, lying just outside the city wall to the\r\nwest, and extending from Fleet Street to the Thames, was once in the\r\npossession of the order of White Friars, and the site of an important\r\nmonastery; but in Elizabeth's time the church had disappeared, most of\r\nthe ancient buildings had been dismantled, and in their place, as Stow\r\ntells us, were \"many fair houses builded, lodgings for noblemen and\r\nothers.\" Since at the dissolution of the monasteries the property had\r\ncome into the possession of the Crown, it was not under the\r\njurisdiction of the London Common Council--a fact which made\r\nWhitefriars, like Blackfriars, a desirable refuge for players seeking\r\nto escape the hostility of the city authorities.[519] One might\r\nnaturally expect the appearance of playing here at an early date, but\r\nthe evidence is slight.[520]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: Whitefriars passed under city control in 1608 by grant\r\nof King James I, but certain rights remained, notably that of\r\nsanctuary. This has been celebrated in Shadwell's play, _The Squire of\r\nAlsatia_, and in Scott's romance, _The Fortunes of Nigel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: Prynne, in _Histriomastix_ (1633), p. 491, quotes a\r\npassage from Richard Reulidge's _Monster Lately Found Out and\r\nDiscovered_ (1628), in which there is a reference to a playhouse as\r\nexisting in Whitefriars \"not long after\" 1580. By \"playhouse\" Reulidge\r\npossibly meant an inn used for acting; but the whole passage, written\r\nby a Puritan after the lapse of nearly half a century, is open to\r\ngrave suspicion, especially in its details. Again Richard Flecknoe, in\r\n_A Short Discourse of the English Stage_ (1664), states that the\r\nChildren of the Chapel Royal acted in Whitefriars. But that he\r\nconfused the word \"Whitefriars\" with \"Blackfriars\" is shown by the\r\nrest of his statement.]\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of a regular playhouse in Whitefriars dates from\r\nthe early years of King James's reign. With our present knowledge we\r\ncannot fix the date exactly, yet we can feel reasonably certain that\r\nit was not long before 1607--probably about 1605.\r\n\r\nThe chief spirit in the organization of the new playhouse seems to\r\nhave been the poet Michael Drayton, who had secured a patent from King\r\nJames to \"erect\" a company of child actors, to be known as \"The\r\nChildren of His Majesty's Revels.\"[521] Obviously his hope was to make\r\nthe Children of His Majesty's Revels at Whitefriars rival the\r\nsuccessful Children of Her Majesty's Revels at Blackfriars. In this\r\nambitious enterprise he associated with himself a wealthy London\r\nmerchant, Thomas Woodford, whom we know as having been interested in\r\nvarious theatrical investments.[522] These two men leased from Lord\r\nBuckhurst for a short period of time a building described as a\r\n\"mansion house\" formerly a part of the Whitefriars monastery: \"the\r\nrooms of which are thirteen in number, three below, and ten above;\r\nthat is to say, the great hall, the kitchen by the yard, and a cellar,\r\nwith all the rooms from the Master of the Revells' office as the same\r\nare now severed and divided.\"[523] The \"great hall\" here mentioned,\r\nonce the refectory of the monks, was made into the playhouse. Its\r\n\"great\" size may be inferred from the fact that there were ten rooms\r\n\"above\"; and its general excellence may be inferred from the fact that\r\nit was leased at £50 per annum, whereas Blackfriars, in a more\r\ndesirable location and fully equipped as a theatre, was rented for\r\nonly £40.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: Fleay, Murray, and others are wrong in assuming that\r\nthis troupe was merely a continuation of the Paul's Boys. So far as I\r\ncan discover, there is no official record of the patent issued to\r\nDrayton; but that such a patent was issued is clear from the lawsuits\r\nof 1609, printed by Greenstreet in _The New Shakspere Society's\r\nTransactions_ (1887-90), p. 269.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: He was part proprietor of the Red Bull. In the case of\r\nWitter _v._ Heminges and Condell he was examined as a witness (see\r\nWallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p. 74), but what\r\nconnection, if any, he had with the Globe does not appear.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: Greenstreet, _The New Shakspere Society's Transactions_\r\n(1887-90), p. 275.]\r\n\r\nFrom an early seventeenth-century survey of the Whitefriars property\r\n(see the opposite page), we are able to place the building very\r\nexactly. The part of the monastery used as a playhouse--the\r\nFrater--was the southern cloister, marked in the plan, \"My Lords\r\nCloyster.\" The \"kitchen by the yard\" mentioned in the document just\r\nquoted is clearly represented in the survey by the \"Scullere.\" The\r\nsize of the playhouse is hard to ascertain, but it was approximately\r\nthirty-five feet in width and eighty-five feet in length.[524] In the\r\nLondon of to-day it extended roughly from Bouverie Street to\r\nAshen-tree Court, and lay just north of George Yard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: The stipple walls, in the original survey colored gray,\r\nwere of stone; the thinner walls of the adjoining \"tenements,\" in the\r\noriginal colored red, were of brick.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF WHITEFRIARS\r\n\r\nA portion of an early seventeenth-century survey of the Whitefriars\r\nproperty. The playhouse adjoined the \"Scullere\" on the south. (This\r\nsurvey was discovered in the Print Room of the British Museum by Mr.\r\nA.W. Clapham, and reproduced in _The Journal of the British\r\nArchæological Association_, 1910.)]\r\n\r\nOf the career of the Children under the joint management of Drayton\r\nand Woodford we know almost nothing. But in March, 1608, a new\r\nmanagement assumed charge of the troupe, and from this point on the\r\nhistory of the playhouse is reasonably clear.\r\n\r\nThe original lease of the building, it seems, expired on March 5,\r\n1608. But before the expiration--in the latter part of 1607 or in the\r\nearly part of 1608--Drayton and Woodford secured a new lease on the\r\nproperty for six years, eight months, and twenty days, or until\r\nDecember 25 (one of the four regular feasts of the year), 1614. In\r\nFebruary, 1608, after having secured this renewal of the lease, Thomas\r\nWoodford suddenly determined to retire from the enterprise; and he\r\nsold his moiety to one David Lording Barry,[525] author of the play\r\n_Ram Alley_. Barry and Drayton at once made plans to divide the\r\nproperty into six shares, so as to distribute the expenses and the\r\nrisks as well as the hoped-for profits. Barry induced his friend,\r\nGeorge Androwes, to purchase one share, and hence the lawsuit from\r\nwhich we derive most of our knowledge of the playhouse. From this suit\r\nI quote below the more significant part relating to the new\r\norganization:\r\n\r\n     Humbly complaining, sheweth unto your honorable lordship,\r\n     your daily orator, George Androwes, of London, silkweaver,\r\n     that whereas one Lordinge Barry, about February which was in\r\n     the year of our Lord 1607 [i.e., 1608], pretending himself\r\n     to be lawfully possessed of one moiety of a messuage or\r\n     mansion house, parcel of the late dissolved monastery called\r\n     the Whitefriars, in Fleet Street, in the suburbs of London,\r\n     by and under a lease made thereof, about March then next\r\n     following, from the right honorable Robert, Lord Buckhurst,\r\n     unto one Michael Drayton and Thomas Woodford, for the term\r\n     of six years, eight months, and twenty days then following,\r\n     for and under the yearly rent of fifty pounds reserved\r\n     thereupon; the moiety of which said lease and premisses, by\r\n     mean assignment from the said Thomas Woodford, was lawfully\r\n     settled in the said Lordinge Barry, as he did pretend,\r\n     together with the moiety of diverse play-books, apparel, and\r\n     other furnitures and necessaries used and employed in and\r\n     about the said messuage and the Children of the Revels,[526]\r\n     there being, in making and setting forth plays, shows, and\r\n     interludes, and such like. And the said Lordinge Barry ...\r\n     being desirous to join others with him in the interest of\r\n     the same, who might be contributory to such future charges\r\n     as should arise in setting forth of plays and shows there,\r\n     did thereupon ... solicit and persuade your orator to\r\n     take from the said Barry an assignment of a sixth part of\r\n     the messuage, premisses, and profits aforesaid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: By a stupid error often called Lodowick Barry. For an\r\nexplanation of the error see an article by the present writer in\r\n_Modern Philology_, April, 1912, IX, 567. Mr. W.J. Lawrence has\r\nrecently shown (_Studies in Philology_, University of North Carolina,\r\nApril, 1917) that David Barry was the eldest son of the ninth Viscount\r\nButtevant, and was called \"Lording\" by courtesy. At the time he became\r\ninterested in the Whitefriars Playhouse he was twenty-two years old.\r\nHe died in 1610.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: At this time the Children of Blackfriars had lost their\r\npatent, so that the Children at Whitefriars were the only Revels\r\ntroupe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICHAEL DRAYTON\r\n\r\n(From a painting in the National Portrait Gallery, London: photograph\r\ncopyrighted by Emery Walker, Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nThis passage gives us an interesting glimpse of Drayton and Barry in\r\ntheir efforts to organize a syndicate for exploiting the Children of\r\nHis Majesty's Revels. They induced several other persons to buy\r\nhalf-shares; and then they engaged, as manager of the Children, Martin\r\nSlaiter,[527] a well-known and thoroughly experienced actor. For his\r\nservices as manager, Slaiter was to receive one whole share in the\r\norganization, and lodgings for himself and his family of ten in the\r\nbuilding. The syndicate thus formed was made up of four whole-sharers,\r\nMichael Drayton, Lordinge Barry, George Androwes, and Martin Slaiter,\r\nand four half-sharers, William Trevell, William Cooke, Edward\r\nSibthorpe, and John Mason.[528]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: Also spelled Slater, Slaughter, Slather, Slawghter.\r\nHenslowe often refers to him as \"Martin.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: Mr. Wallace (_The Century Magazine_, 1910, LXXX, 511)\r\nincorrectly says that Whitefriars was held by \"six equal sharers.\"]\r\n\r\nThe \"great hall\" had, of course, already been fitted up for the acting\r\nof plays, and the new lessees did not at first contemplate any\r\nexpenditure on the building. Later, however,--if we can believe\r\nAndrowes,--they spent a not inconsiderable sum for improvements. The\r\nChildren already had certain plays, and to these were added some new\r\nones. Among the plays in their repertoire were Day's _Humour Out of\r\nBreath_, Middleton's _Family of Love_, Armin's _The Two Maids of\r\nMoreclacke_, Sharpham's _Cupid's Whirligig_, Markham and Machin's _The\r\nDumb Knight_, Barry's _Ram Alley_, and Mason's _The Turk_. The last\r\ntwo writers were sharers, and it seems likely that Drayton, also a\r\nsharer and experienced as a dramatist, contributed some plays towards\r\nthe stock of the company.\r\n\r\nThe new organization, with bright prospects for success, was launched\r\nin March, 1608. Almost at once, however, it began to suffer from ill\r\nluck. In April the Children at Blackfriars, by their performance of\r\n_Byron_, caused King James to close all playhouses in London. How long\r\nhe kept them closed we do not know, but we find the lessees of\r\nWhitefriars joining with the three other London companies in seeking\r\nto have the inhibition raised. As the French Ambassador informed his\r\nGovernment: \"Pour lever cette défense, quatres autres compagnies, qui\r\ny sont encore, offrent déjà cent mille francs, lesquels pourront bien\r\nleur en ordonner la permission.\"[529]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: Letter of M. De La Boderie, the French Ambassador to\r\nEngland; quoted by E.K. Chambers, _Modern Language Review_, IV, 159.]\r\n\r\nEven if this inhibition was shortly raised, the Whitefriars\r\norganization was not much better off, for in July the plague set in\r\nwith unusual violence, and acting was seriously if not wholly\r\ninterrupted for the next twelve months and more. As a result, the\r\nprofits from the theatre did not come up to the \"fair and false\r\nflattering speeches\" which at the outset Barry had made to prospective\r\ninvestors, and this led to bad feeling among the sharers.\r\n\r\nThe company at Blackfriars, of course, was suffering in a similar way.\r\nOn August 8, 1608, their playhouse was surrendered to the owner,\r\nRichard Burbage, and the Children being thus left without a home were\r\ndispersed. Early in 1609, probably in February, Robert Keysar (the\r\nmanager of the Blackfriars troupe), Philip Rosseter, and others\r\nsecured the lease of the Whitefriars Playhouse from Drayton and the\r\nrest of the discontented sharers, and reassembled there the Children\r\nof Blackfriars. What became of the Whitefriars troupe we do not know;\r\nbut it is highly likely that the new organization took over the better\r\nactors from Drayton's company. At any rate, we do not hear again of\r\nthe Children of His Majesty's Revels.\r\n\r\nWhen Keysar and this new troupe of child-actors moved into\r\nWhitefriars, Slaiter and his family of ten were expelled from the\r\nbuilding. This led to a lawsuit, and explains much in the legal\r\ndocuments printed by Greenstreet. Slaiter complained with no little\r\nfeeling that he had been \"riotously, willfully, violently, and\r\nunlawfully, contrary to the said articles and pretended agreement [by\r\nwhich he had been not only engaged as a manager, but also guaranteed a\r\nhome for the period of \"all the term of years in the lease\"], put and\r\nkept out of his said rooms of habitation for him, this defendant, and\r\nhis family, and all other his means of livelihood, thereby leaving\r\nthis defendant and his whole family, being ten in number, to the world\r\nto seek for bread and other means to live by.\"[530]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: Greenstreet, _The New Shakspere Society's Transactions_\r\n(1887-90), p. 283.]\r\n\r\nThe new Whitefriars troupe acted five plays at Court during the winter\r\nof 1609-10. Payments therefor were made to Robert Keysar, and the\r\ncompany was referred to merely as \"The Children of the Whitefriars.\"\r\nBut on January 4, 1610, the company secured a royal patent authorizing\r\nthe use of the title \"The Children of the Queen's Revels.\"[531] The\r\npatent was granted to Robert Daborne, Philip Rosseter, John Tarbock,\r\nRichard Jones, and Robert Browne; but Keysar, though not named in the\r\ngrant, was still one of the important sharers.[532]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: Printed in The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: See Keysar _v._ Burbage _et al._, printed by Mr.\r\nWallace, in his _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, pp. 80 ff.]\r\n\r\nThe troupe well deserved the patronage of the Queen. Keysar described\r\nthe Blackfriars Children whom he had reorganized as \"a company of the\r\nmost expert and skillful actors within the realm of England, to the\r\nnumber of eighteen or twenty persons, all or most of them, trained up\r\nin that service in the reign of the late Queen Elizabeth for ten years\r\ntogether.\"[533] And to these, as I have pointed out, it seems likely\r\nthat the best members of the bankrupt Children of His Majesty's Revels\r\nhad been added. The chief actor of the new organization was\r\nNathaniel Field, whose histrionic ability placed him beside Edward\r\nAlleyn and Richard Burbage. One of the first plays he was called upon\r\nto act in his new theatre was Jonson's brilliant comedy, _Epicoene_,\r\nin which he took the leading rôle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: _Ibid._, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITES OF THE WHITEFRIARS AND THE SALISBURY COURT\r\nPLAYHOUSES\r\n\r\nThe Whitefriars Playhouse was just north of \"K. 46\"; the Salisbury\r\nCourt Playhouse was just south of the court of that name. (From Ogilby\r\nand Morgan's _Map of London_, 1677.)]\r\n\r\nThe idea then occurred to Rosseter to secure a monopoly on\r\nchild-acting and on private playhouses. The Children of His Majesty's\r\nRevels had ceased to exist. The Blackfriars Playhouse had been closed\r\nby royal command, and its lease had been surrendered to its owner,\r\nRichard Burbage. The only rival to the Children at Whitefriars was the\r\ntroupe of Paul's Boys acting in their singing-school behind the\r\nCathedral. How Rosseter attempted to buy them off is thus recorded by\r\nRichard Burbage and John Heminges:\r\n\r\n     There being, as these defendants verily think, but only\r\n     three private playhouses in the city of London, the one of\r\n     which being in the Blackfriars and in the hands of these\r\n     defendants or of their assigns, one other being in the\r\n     Whitefriars in the hands or occupation of the said\r\n     complainant himself [Keysar], his partners [Rosseter, _et\r\n     al._], or assigns, and the third near St. Paul's Church,\r\n     then being in the hands of one Mr. Pierce, but then unused\r\n     for a playhouse. One Mr. Rosseter, a partner of the said\r\n     complainant [Keysar] dealt for and compounded with the said\r\n     Mr. Pierce [Master of the Paul's Boys] to the only benefit\r\n     of him, the said Rosseter, the now complainant [Keysar], the\r\n     rest of their partners and company, and without the privity,\r\n     knowledge, or consent of these defendants [the King's\r\n     Company], or any of them, and that thereby they, the said\r\n     complainant [Keysar] and the said Rosseter and their\r\n     partners and company might advance their gains and profit to\r\n     be had and made in their said house in Whitefriars, that\r\n     there might be a cessation of playing and plays to be acted\r\n     in the said house near St. Paul's Church aforesaid, for\r\n     which the said Rosseter compounded with the said Pierce to\r\n     give him, the said Pierce, twenty pounds per annum.[534]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: Wallace, _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p.\r\n95.]\r\n\r\nBy this means Rosseter disposed of the competition of the Paul's Boys.\r\nBut, although he secured a monopoly on child-acting, he failed to\r\nsecure a monopoly on private playhouses, for shortly after he had\r\nsealed this bargain with Pierce, the powerful King's Men opened up at\r\nBlackfriars. Rosseter promptly requested them to pay half the \"dead\r\nrent\" to Pierce, which they good-naturedly agreed to do.\r\n\r\nIn 1613 Whitefriars was rented by certain London apprentices for the\r\nperformance \"at night\" of Robert Taylor's _The Hog Hath Lost His\r\nPearl_. The episode is narrated by Sir Henry Wotton in a letter to Sir\r\nEdmund Bacon:\r\n\r\n     On Sunday last, at night, and no longer, some sixteen\r\n     apprentices (of what sort you shall guess by the rest of the\r\n     story) having secretly learnt a new play without book,[535]\r\n     entitled _The Hog Hath Lost His Pearl_, took up the\r\n     Whitefriars for their theatre, and having invited thither\r\n     (as it should seem) rather their mistresses than their\r\n     masters, who were all to enter _per buletini_ for a note of\r\n     distinction from ordinary comedians. Towards the end of the\r\n     play the sheriffs (who by chance had heard of it) came in\r\n     (as they say) and carried some six or seven of them to\r\n     perform the last act at Bridewell. The rest are fled. Now it\r\n     is strange to hear how sharp-witted the city is, for they\r\n     will needs have Sir John Swinerton, the Lord Mayor, be meant\r\n     by the Hog, and the late Lord Treasurer by the Pearl.[536]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: Miss Gildersleeve, in her valuable _Government\r\nRegulation of the Elizabethan Drama_, p. 112, says: \"Just what is the\r\nmeaning of 'a new Play without Book' no one seems to have\r\nconjectured.\" And she develops the theory that \"it refers to the\r\nabsence of a licensed play-book,\" etc. The phrase \"to learn without\r\nbook\" meant simply \"to memorize.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: _Reliquiæ Wottonianæ_ (ed. 1672), p. 402. The letter is\r\ndated merely 1612-13. In connection with the play one should study\r\n_The Hector of Germany_, 1615.]\r\n\r\nApparently the Children of the Queen's Revels continued successfully\r\nat Whitefriars until March, 1613. On that date Rosseter agreed with\r\nHenslowe to join the Revels with the Lady Elizabeth's Men then acting\r\nat the Swan. The new organization, following the example of the King's\r\nMen, used Whitefriars as a winter, and the Swan as a summer, house.\r\nThus for a time at least Whitefriars came under the management of\r\nHenslowe.\r\n\r\nRosseter's lease of the building was to expire in the following year.\r\nHe seems to have made plans--possibly with the assistance of\r\nHenslowe--to erect in Whitefriars a more suitable playhouse for the\r\nnewly organized company; at least that is a plausible interpretation\r\nof the following curious entry in Sir George Buc's Office Book: \"July\r\n13, 1613, for a license to erect a new playhouse in Whitefriars, &c.\r\n£20.\"[537] But the new playhouse thus projected never was built,\r\ndoubtless because of strong local opposition. Instead, Henslowe\r\nerected for the company a public playhouse on the Bankside, known as\r\n\"The Hope.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 52.]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1614, at the expiration of one year, Rosseter withdrew from\r\nhis partnership with Henslowe. On December 25, 1614, his lease of the\r\nWhitefriars expired, and he was apparently unable to renew it.\r\nThereupon he attempted to fit up a private playhouse in the district\r\nof Blackfriars, and on June 3, 1615, he actually secured a royal\r\nlicense to do so. But in this effort, too, he was foiled.[538]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: See the chapter on \"Rosseter's Blackfriars.\" The\r\ndocuments concerned in this venture are printed in The Malone\r\nSociety's _Collections_, I, 277.]\r\n\r\nAfter this we hear little or nothing of the Whitefriars Playhouse. Yet\r\nthe building may occasionally have been used for dramatic purposes.\r\nCunningham says: \"The case of Trevill _v._ Woodford, in the Court of\r\nRequests, informs us that plays were performed at the Whitefriars\r\nTheatre as late as 1621; Sir Anthony Ashley, the then landlord of the\r\nhouse, entering the theatre in that year, and turning the players out\r\nof doors, on pretense that half a year's rent was yet unpaid to\r\nhim.\"[539] I have not been able to examine this document. Neither\r\nFleay nor Murray has found any trace of a company at Whitefriars after\r\nRosseter's departure; hence for all practical purposes we may regard\r\nthe Whitefriars Playhouse as having come to the end of its career in\r\n1614.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 539: _The Shakespeare Society's Papers_, IV, 90. The\r\ndocument printed by Collier in _New Facts Regarding the Life of\r\nShakespeare_ (1835), p. 44, as from a manuscript in his possession,\r\nis, I think, an obvious forgery.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE HOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 29, 1611, Henslowe became manager of the Lady Elizabeth's\r\nMen. Having agreed among other things to furnish them with a\r\nplayhouse,[540] and no longer being in possession of the Rose, he\r\nrented the old Swan and maintained them there throughout the year\r\n1612.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 540: The agreement has been lost, but for a probably similar\r\nagreement, made with the actor Nathaniel Field, see Greg, _Henslowe\r\nPapers_, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nIn March of the following year, 1613, he entered into a partnership\r\nwith Philip Rosseter (the manager of the private playhouse of\r\nWhitefriars), and \"joined\" the Lady Elizabeth's Men with Rosseter's\r\nexcellent troupe of the Queen's Revels. Apparently the intention of\r\nHenslowe and Rosseter was to form a company strong enough to compete\r\non equal terms with the King's Men. In imitation of the King's Men,\r\nwho used the Globe as a summer and the Blackfriars as a winter home,\r\nthe newly amalgamated company was to use the Swan and the\r\nWhitefriars.[541] And the chief actor of the troupe, corresponding to\r\nRichard Burbage of the King's Men, was to be Nathaniel Field, then at\r\nthe height of his powers:\r\n\r\n     _Cokes._ Which is your Burbage now?\r\n\r\n     _Leatherhead._ What mean you by that, sir?\r\n\r\n     _Cokes._ Your best actor, your Field.\r\n\r\n     _Littlewit._ Good, i' faith! you are even with me, sir.[542]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: Daborne writes to Henslowe on June 5, 1613: \"The\r\ncompany told me you were expected there yesterday to conclude about\r\ntheir coming over ... my own play which shall be ready before they\r\ncome over.\" This, I suspect, refers to the moving of the company to\r\nthe Swan for the summer. (See Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 72.) That\r\nHenslowe was manager of a \"private\" house in 1613 is revealed by\r\nanother letter from Daborne, dated December 9, 1613. (See Greg,\r\n_ibid._, p. 79.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: _Bartholomew Fair_, V, iii. The part of Littlewit was\r\npresumably taken by Field himself.]\r\n\r\nAmong their playwrights were Ben Jonson, Philip Massinger, John\r\nFletcher, and Robert Daborne, not to mention Field, who in addition to\r\nacting wrote excellent plays.\r\n\r\nIf it was the purpose of Henslowe and Rosseter to compete with the\r\nGlobe Company in a winter as well as in a summer house, that purpose\r\nwas endangered by the fact that Rosseter's lease of his private\r\ntheatre expired within a year and a half, and could not be renewed.\r\nRosseter and Henslowe, as pointed out in the preceding chapter, seem\r\nto have attempted to erect in Whitefriars a winter home for their\r\ntroupe; so, at least, I have interpreted the curious entry in Sir\r\nGeorge Buc's Office Book: \"July 13, 1613, for a license to erect a new\r\nplayhouse in the Whitefriars, &c. £20.\"[543] The attempt, however, was\r\nfoiled, probably by the strong opposition of the inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 52.]\r\n\r\nShortly after this, Henslowe made plans to provide the company with a\r\nnew and better public playhouse on the Bankside, more conveniently\r\nsituated than the Swan. The old Bear Garden was beginning to show\r\nsigns of decay, and, doubtless, would soon have to be rebuilt. This\r\nsuggested to Henslowe the idea of tearing down that ancient structure\r\nand erecting in its place a larger and handsomer building to serve\r\nboth for the performance of plays and for the baiting of animals. To\r\nthis plan Jacob Meade, Henslowe's partner in the ownership of the Bear\r\nGarden, agreed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOPE PLAYHOUSE, OR SECOND BEAR GARDEN\r\n\r\nFrom Hollar's _View of London_ (1647).]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on August 29, 1613, Henslowe and Meade signed a contract\r\nwith a carpenter named Katherens to pull down the Bear Garden and\r\nerect in its place a new structure. The original contract, preserved\r\namong the Henslowe Papers, is one of the most valuable documents we\r\nhave relating to the early theatres. It is too long and verbose for\r\ninsertion here, but I give below a summary of its contents.[544]\r\nKatherens agreed:\r\n\r\n     1. To \"pull down\" the Bear Garden and \"the stable wherein\r\n     the bulls and horses\" had been kept; and \"near or upon the\r\n     said place where the said game-place did heretofore stand,\"\r\n     to \"newly erect, build, and set up\" a \"playhouse, fit and\r\n     convenient in all things both for players to play in, and\r\n     for the game of bears and bulls to be baited in.\"\r\n\r\n     2. \"To build the same of such large compass, form, wideness,\r\n     and height as the playhouse called the Swan.\"\r\n\r\n     3. To provide for the building \"a good sure, and sufficient\r\n     foundation of bricks ... thirteen inches at the least above\r\n     the ground.\"\r\n\r\n     4. To make three galleries: \"the inner principal posts of\r\n     the first story to be twelve feet in height, and ten inches\r\n     square; in the middle story ... eight inches square; in the\r\n     upper story ... seven inches square.\"[545]\r\n\r\n     5. To \"make two boxes in the lowermost story, fit and decent\r\n     for gentlemen to sit in,\" and in the rest of the galleries\r\n     \"partitions between the rooms as they are in the said\r\n     playhouse called the Swan.\"\r\n\r\n     6. To construct \"a stage, to be carried and taken away, and\r\n     to stand upon tressels, good, substantial, and sufficient\r\n     for the carrying and bearing of such a stage.\"\r\n\r\n     7. To \"build the heavens all over the said stage, to be\r\n     borne or carried without any posts or supporters to be fixed\r\n     or set upon the said stage.\"\r\n\r\n     8. To equip the stage with \"a fit and convenient\r\n     tyre-house.\"\r\n\r\n     9. To \"build two staircases without and adjoining to the\r\n     said playhouse ... of such largeness and height as the\r\n     staircases of the said playhouse called the Swan.\"\r\n\r\n     10. \"To new build, erect, and set up the said bull-house and\r\n     stable ... of that largeness and fitness as shall be\r\n     sufficient to keep and hold six bulls and three horses.\"\r\n\r\n     11. \"To new tyle with English tyles all the upper roof of\r\n     the said playhouse ... and stable.\"\r\n\r\n     12. To have the playhouse finished \"upon or before the last\r\n     day of November,\" 1613.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: The contract is printed in full in Greg, _Henslowe\r\nPapers_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: The height is given for the first story only. We may\r\nassume that the middle and uppermost stories were of diminishing\r\nheights, as in the case of the Fortune Playhouse, in which the\r\ngalleries were respectively twelve, eleven, and nine feet in height.]\r\n\r\nFor all this Katherens was to receive the sum of £360; but since\r\nHenslowe and Meade supplied a large share of the lumber and other\r\nmaterials, the total cost of the building may be estimated as not less\r\nthan £600.\r\n\r\nWhen completed, the new playhouse was appropriately christened \"The\r\nHope.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been generally assumed that a picture of the Hope is given in\r\nVisscher's _View of London_, published in 1616; but this, I think, is\r\nexceedingly doubtful. In drawing the Bankside, Visscher rather\r\nslavishly copied the Agas map of 1560, inserting a few new\r\nbuildings,--notably the playhouses,--and it is virtually certain that\r\nhe represented the \"Bear Garden\" (so he distinctly calls it) and the\r\nGlobe as they were before their reconstruction.[546] The first\r\nrepresentation of the Hope is to be found in Hollar's splendid _View\r\nof London_ published in 1647 (see page 326). At this time the\r\nbuilding, which had for many years been devoted wholly to the royal\r\nsports of bull- and bear-baiting, was still standing. It is hard to\r\nbelieve that an artist who so carefully represented the famous\r\nedifices of the city should have greatly erred in drawing the \"Bear\r\nBaiting House,\"--a structure more curious than they, and quite as\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: The Merian _View of London_, published in 1638 at\r\nFrankfort-am-Main, is merely a copy of the Visscher view with the\r\naddition of certain details from another and earlier view not yet\r\nidentified. It has no independent value. The _View of London_ printed\r\nin Howell's _Londinopolis_ (1657), is merely a slavish copy of the\r\nMerian view. Visscher's representation of the Bear Garden does not\r\ndiffer in any essential way from the representation in Hondius's\r\n_View_ of 1610. For a fuller discussion see pages 126, 146, 248.]\r\n\r\nHollar represents the Hope as circular. According to the contract\r\nKatherens was \"to build the same of such large compass, form,\r\nwideness, and height as the playhouse called the Swan.\" Whether the\r\nword \"form\" was intended to apply to the exterior of the building we\r\ndo not know. The Swan was decahedral; Visscher represents the \"Bear\r\nGarden\" as octagonal (which is correct for the Bear Garden that\r\npreceded the Hope). But since the exterior was of lime and plaster,\r\nand a decahedral form had no advantage, Katherens may well have\r\nconstructed a circular building as Hollar indicates. Perhaps it is\r\nsignificant in this connection that John Taylor, the Water-Poet, in\r\nhis _Bull, Bear, and Horse_, refers to the Hope as a \"sweet,\r\n_rotuntious_ college.\" Significant also, perhaps, is the clause in\r\nthe contract by which Katherens was required to \"build the heavens all\r\nover the stage,\" for this exactly describes the heavens as drawn by\r\nHollar. I see no reason to doubt that in the _View_ of 1647 we have a\r\nreasonably faithful representation of the Hope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOPE PLAYHOUSE, OR SECOND BEAR GARDEN\r\n\r\nThe upper view is from Hollar's Post-conflagration map in the Crace\r\nCollection of the British Museum; the lower view is from Faithorne's\r\nMap of London (1658).]\r\n\r\nThe Hope was probably opened shortly after November 30, 1613, the date\r\nat which Katherens had bound himself to have the building \"fully\r\nfinished,\" and it was occupied, of course, by the Henslowe and\r\nRosseter troupe of actors. The arrangement of the movable stage\r\nenabled Henslowe and Meade to use the building also for\r\nanimal-baiting. According to the contract with the actors, the latter\r\nwere to \"lie still one day in fourteen\" for the baiting.[547] This may\r\nnot have been a serious interruption for the players; but the presence\r\nof the stable, the bear dens, and the kennels for the dogs must have\r\nrendered the playhouse far from pleasant to the audiences. Ben Jonson,\r\nin the Induction to his _Bartholomew Fair_, acted at the Hope in\r\nOctober, 1614, remarks: \"And though the Fair be not kept in the same\r\nregion that some here perhaps would have it, yet think that therein\r\nthe author hath observed a special decorum, the place being as dirty\r\nas Smithfield, and as stinking every whit.\"[548]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 88; cf. p. 125, where\r\nanimal-baiting is said to be used \"one day of every four days\"--a\r\npossible error for \"fourteen days.\" In the manuscript notes to the\r\nPhillipps copy of Stow's _Survey_ (1631), we are told that baiting was\r\nused at the Hope on Tuesdays and Thursdays; but the anonymous\r\ncommentator is very inaccurate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 548: The Rose Playhouse was likewise affected. Dekker, in\r\n_Satiromastix_, III, iv, says: \"Th'ast a breath as sweet as the Rose\r\nthat grows by the Bear Garden.\"]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1614,--that is, at the completion of one full year under the\r\njoint management of Henslowe and Rosseter,--the amalgamated company\r\nwas \"broken,\" and Rosseter withdrew, selling his interest in the\r\ncompany's apparel to Henslowe and Meade for £63. The latter at once\r\nreorganized the actors under the patent of the Lady Elizabeth's Men,\r\nand continued them at the Hope.[549] The general excellence of the\r\ntroupe thus formed is referred to by John Taylor, the Water-Poet, in\r\nthe lines:\r\n\r\n     And such a company (I'll boldly say)\r\n     That better (nor the like) e'er play'd a play.[550]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 87. The articles of\r\nagreement between Henslowe and Meade and the company, are printed by\r\nGreg on page 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: _Works_, Folio of 1630; The Spenser Society's reprint,\r\np. 307.]\r\n\r\nBut this encomium may have been in large measure due to gratitude, for\r\nthe company had just saved the Water-Poet from a very embarrassing\r\nsituation. The amusing episode which gave occasion to this deserves to\r\nbe chronicled in some detail.\r\n\r\nWith \"a thousand bills posted over the city\" Taylor had advertised to\r\nthe public that at the Hope Playhouse on October 7, 1614, he would\r\nengage in a contest of wit with one William Fennor, who proudly styled\r\nhimself \"The King's Majesty's Riming Poet.\"[551] On the appointed day\r\nthe house was \"fill'd with a great audience\" that had paid extra money\r\nto hear the contest between two such well-known extemporal wits. But\r\nFennor did not appear. The result may best be told by Taylor himself:\r\n\r\n     I then stept out, their angers to appease;\r\n     But they all raging, like tempestuous seas,\r\n     Cry'd out, their expectations were defeated,\r\n     And how they all were cony-catch'd and cheated.\r\n     Some laught, some swore, some star'd and stamp'd and curst,\r\n     And in confusèd humors all out burst.\r\n     I (as I could) did stand the desp'rate shock,\r\n     And bid the brunt of many dang'rous knock.\r\n     For now the stinkards, in their ireful wraths,\r\n     Bepelted me with lome, with stones, with laths.\r\n     One madly sits like bottle-ale and hisses;\r\n     Another throws a stone, and 'cause he misses,\r\n     He yawnes and bawles, ...\r\n     Some run to th' door to get again their coin ...\r\n     One valiantly stepped upon the stage,\r\n     And would tear down the hangings in his rage ...\r\n     What I endur'd upon that earthly hell\r\n     My tongue or pen cannot describe it well.[552]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: Fennor is not to be confused (as is commonly done) with\r\nVennar (see p. 177). Such wit-contests were popular; Fennor had\r\nrecently challenged Kendall, on the Fortune Stage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: John Taylor's _Works_, Folio of 1630, p. 142; The\r\nSpenser Society's reprint, p. 304.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the actors came to his rescue and presented a play that\r\nmollified the audience. Taylor had to content himself with a printed\r\njustification. The bitter invective of Taylor against Fennor,\r\nFennor's reply, and Taylor's several answers are to be found in the\r\nfolio edition of the Water-Poet's works. The episode doubtless\r\nfurnished much amusement to the city.\r\n\r\nSome three weeks after this event, on October 31, 1614, the Lady\r\nElizabeth's Men produced with great success Jonson's _Bartholomew\r\nFair_; and on November 1 they were called upon to give the play at\r\nCourt. But the career of the company was in the main unhappy. Henslowe\r\nmanaged their affairs on the theory that \"should these fellows come\r\nout of my debt, I should have no rule with them.\"[553] Accordingly in\r\nthree years he \"broke\" and again reorganized them no fewer than five\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nAt last, in February, 1615, he not only \"broke\" the company, but\r\nsevered his connection with them for ever. He turned the hired men\r\nover to other troupes, and sold the stock of apparel \"to strangers\"\r\nfor £400. The indignant actors, in June, 1615, drew up \"Articles of\r\nGrievance\" in which they charged Henslowe with having extorted from\r\nthe company by unjust means the sum of £567; and also \"Articles of\r\nOppression\" in which they accused him of various dishonorable\r\npractices in his dealings with them.[554]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 554: _Ibid._, pp. 86, 89.]\r\n\r\nShortly after severing his connection with the Lady Elizabeth's Men,\r\nHenslowe, in March, 1615, seems to have taken over Prince Charles's\r\nMen, who, it appears, had been acting at the Swan. To this new\r\ncompany--the \"strangers\" referred to, I think--he had already\r\ntransferred some of the hirelings, and had sold the Hope stock of\r\napparel for £400.\r\n\r\nHenslowe died early in January of the following year, 1616, and his\r\ninterest in the theatre passed to Edward Alleyn. On March 20, 1616,\r\nAlleyn and Meade engaged Prince Charles's Men to continue at the Hope\r\n\"according to the former articles of agreement had and made with the\r\nsaid Philip [Henslowe] and Jacob [Meade].\"[555] The actors\r\nacknowledged themselves indebted to Henslowe \"for a stock of apparel\r\nused for playing apparel, to the value of £400, heretofore delivered\r\nunto them by the said Philip,\"[556]--the stock formerly used by the\r\nLady Elizabeth's Men; and Alleyn and Meade agreed to accept £200 in\r\nfull discharge of that debt.[557]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 555: Collier, _Memoirs of Edward Alleyn_, p. 127; Greg,\r\n_Henslowe Papers_, p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 556: Collier, _Memoirs of Edward Alleyn_, p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 557: My interpretation of the relation of Henslowe to Prince\r\nCharles's Men differs from the interpretation given by Fleay and\r\nadopted by Greg and others. For the evidence bearing on the case see\r\nFleay, _Stage_, pp. 188, 262; Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, 138; Greg,\r\n_Henslowe Papers_, p. 90, note; Chambers, _Modern Language Review_,\r\nIV, 165; Cunningham, _Revels_, p. xliv; Wallace, _Englische Studien_,\r\nXLIII, 390; Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_.]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1616-17, Prince Charles's Men quarreled with Meade,\r\nwho had appropriated an extra day for his bear-baiting. Rosseter had\r\njust completed a new private theatre in Porter's Hall, Blackfriars,\r\nand that stood invitingly open. So about February they abandoned the\r\nHope, and wrote a letter of explanation to Edward Alleyn: \"I hope you\r\nmistake not our removal from the Bankside. We stood the intemperate\r\nweather, 'till more intemperate Mr. Meade thrust us over, taking the\r\nday from us which by course was ours.\"[558]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 558: Greg, _Henslowe Papers_, p. 93. Cf. also the chapter on\r\n\"Rosseter's Blackfriars.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter the company quarreled with Meade and deserted the Hope, there is\r\nno evidence that the building was again used for plays. It became\r\nassociated almost entirely with animal-baiting, fencing, feats of\r\nactivity, and such-like performances; and gradually the very name\r\n\"Hope,\" which was identified with acting, gave way to the earlier\r\ndesignation \"Bear Garden.\" In 1632 the author of _Holland's Leaguer_\r\nremarks that \"wild beasts and gladiators did most possess it\"; and\r\nsuch must have been the chief use of the building down to 1642, when\r\nanimal-baiting was prohibited by Parliament.[559]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 559: Collier, _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_\r\n(1879), III, 102; Ordish, _Early London Theatres_, p. 237.]\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1647, at the disposition of the Church lands, the Hope\r\nwas sold for £1783 15_s._[560]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: Arthur Tiler, _St. Saviour's_, p. 51; Reed's Dodsley,\r\nIX, 175.]\r\n\r\nIn certain manuscript notes entered in the Phillipps copy of Stow's\r\n_Annals_ (1631), we read:\r\n\r\n     The Hope, on the Bankside, in Southwarke, commonly called\r\n     the Bear Garden, a playhouse for stage-plays on Mondays,\r\n     Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and for the baiting of\r\n     Bears on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the stage being made to\r\n     take up and down when they please. It was built in the year\r\n     1610, and now pulled down to make tenements, by Thomas\r\n     Walker, a petticoat-maker in Cannon Street, on Tuesday, the\r\n     25 day of March, 1656. Seven of Mr. Godfrey's bears, by the\r\n     command of Thomas Pride, then high sheriff of Surrey, were\r\n     then shot to death on Saturday the 9 day of February, 1655\r\n     [i.e. 1656], by a company of soldiers.[561]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: Printed in _The Academy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314. As\r\nto \"Mr. Godfrey\" see Collier, _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_\r\n(1879), III, 102.]\r\n\r\nThe mistakes in the earlier part of this note are obvious, yet the\r\nlatter part is so circumstantial that we cannot well doubt its general\r\naccuracy. The building, however, was not pulled down \"to the ground,\"\r\nthough its interior may have been converted into tenements.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration, when the royal sport of bear-baiting was revived,\r\nthe Hope was again fitted up as an amphitheatre and opened to the\r\npublic. The Earl of Manchester, on September 29, 1664, wrote to the\r\ncity authorities, requesting that the butchers be required, as of old,\r\nto provide food for the dogs and bears:\r\n\r\n     He had been informed by the Master of His Majesty's Game of\r\n     Bears and Bulls, and others, that the Butchers' Company had\r\n     formerly caused all their offal in Eastcheap and Newgate\r\n     Market to be conveyed by the beadle of that Company unto\r\n     two barrow houses, conveniently placed on the river side,\r\n     for the provision and feeding of the King's Game of Bears,\r\n     which custom had been interrupted in the late troubles when\r\n     the bears were killed. His Majesty's game being now removed\r\n     to the usual place on the Bankside, by Order of the Council,\r\n     he recommended the Court of Aldermen to direct the Master\r\n     and Wardens of the Butchers' Company to have their offal\r\n     conveyed as formerly for the feeding of the bears, &c.[562]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: _The Remembrancia_, p. 478. Quoted by Ordish, _Early\r\nLondon Theatres_, p. 241.]\r\n\r\nFor some years the Bear Garden flourished as it had in the days of\r\nElizabeth and James. It was frequently visited by Samuel Pepys, who\r\nhas left vivid accounts of several performances there. In his _Diary_,\r\nAugust 14, 1666, he writes:\r\n\r\n     After dinner with my wife and Mercer to the Bear-garden;\r\n     where I have not been, I think, of many years, and saw some\r\n     good sport of the bull's tossing of the dogs: one into the\r\n     very boxes. But it is a very rude and nasty pleasure. We had\r\n     a great many hectors in the same box with us (and one, very\r\n     fine, went into the pit, and played his dog for a wager,\r\n     which was a strange sport for a gentleman), where they drank\r\n     wine, and drank Mercer's health first; which I pledged with\r\n     my hat off.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn, likewise, in his _Diary_, June 16, 1670, records a visit\r\nto the Bear Garden:\r\n\r\n     I went with some friends to the Bear Garden, where was\r\n     cock-fighting, dog-fighting, bear- and bull-baiting, it\r\n     being a famous day for all these butcherly sports, or rather\r\n     barbarous cruelties. The bulls did exceeding well; but the\r\n     Irish wolf-dog exceeded, which was a tall greyhound, a\r\n     stately creature indeed, who beat a cruel mastiff. One of\r\n     the bulls tossed a dog full into a lady's lap as she sat in\r\n     one of the boxes at a considerable height from the arena.\r\n     Two poor dogs were killed; and so all ended with the ape on\r\n     horseback, and I most heartily weary of the rude and dirty\r\n     pastime, which I had not seen, I think, in twenty years\r\n     before.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 1676, the Spanish Ambassador was entertained at the Bear\r\nGarden, as we learn from a warrant, dated March 28, 1676, for the\r\npayment of £10 \"to James Davies, Esq., Master of His Majesty's Bears,\r\nBulls, and Dogs, for making ready the rooms at the Bear Garden, and\r\nbaiting of the bears before the Spanish Ambassador, the 7 January\r\nlast, 1675 {6}.\"[563]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: British Museum Additional MSS. 5750; quoted by\r\nCunningham, _Handbook of London_ (1849), I, 67.]\r\n\r\nRendle[564] quotes from _The Loyal Protestant_ an advertisement of an\r\nentertainment to be given so late as 1682 \"at the Hope on the\r\nBankside, being His Majesty's Bear Garden.\" And Malcolm writes the\r\nfollowing account of the baiting of a horse there in April of the same\r\nyear:\r\n\r\n     Notice was given in the papers that on the twelfth of April\r\n     a horse, of uncommon strength, and between 18 and 19 hands\r\n     high, would be _baited to death at his Majesty's\r\n     Bear-Garden_ at the Hope on the Bankside, for the amusement\r\n     of the Morocco ambassador, many of the nobility who knew the\r\n     horse, and any others who would pay the price of admission.\r\n     It seems this animal originally belonged to the Earl of\r\n     Rochester, and being of a ferocious disposition, had killed\r\n     several of his brethren; for which misdeed he was sold to\r\n     the Earl of Dorchester; in whose service, committing several\r\n     similar offenses, he was transferred to the worse than\r\n     savages who kept the Bear-Garden. On the day appointed\r\n     several dogs were set upon the vindictive steed, which he\r\n     destroyed or drove from the arena; at this instant his\r\n     owners determined to preserve him for a future day's sport,\r\n     and directed a person to lead him away; but before the horse\r\n     had reached London Bridge the spectators demanded the\r\n     fulfilment of the promise of baiting him to death, and began\r\n     to destroy the building: to conclude, the poor beast was\r\n     brought back, and other dogs set upon him, without effect,\r\n     when he was stabbed to death with a sword.[565]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: _The Antiquarian Magazine and Bibliographer_, VIII,\r\n59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: James Peller Malcolm, _Anecdotes of the Manners and\r\nCustoms of London from the Roman Invasion to the Year 1700_ (London,\r\n1811), p. 425.]\r\n\r\nThis is the last reference to the Hope that I have been able to\r\ndiscover. Soon after this date the \"royal sport of bulls, bears, and\r\ndogs\" was moved to Hockley-in-the-hole, Clerkenwell, where, as the\r\nadvertisements inform us, at \"His Majesty's Bear Garden\" the baiting\r\nof animals was to be frequently seen.[566] Strype, in his _Survey of\r\nLondon_, thus describes Bear Garden Alley on the Bankside:\r\n\r\n     Bear Alley runs into Maiden Lane. Here is a Glass House; and\r\n     about the middle is a new-built Court, well inhabited,\r\n     called Bear Garden Square, so called as built in the place\r\n     where the _Bear Garden_ formerly stood, until removed to the\r\n     other side of the water: which is more convenient for the\r\n     butchers, and such like who are taken with such rustic\r\n     sports as the baiting of bears and bulls.[567]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: The earliest advertisement of the Bear Garden at\r\nHockley-in-the-hole that I have come upon is dated 1700. For a\r\ndiscussion of the sports there see J.P.

I, chap. I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: Ordish (_Early London Theatres_, p. 242) is mistaken in\r\nthinking that the old building was converted into a glass house. He\r\nsays: \"The last reference to the Hope shows that it had declined to\r\nthe point of extinction,\" and he quotes an advertisement from the\r\n_Gazette_, June 18, 1681, as follows: \"There is now made at the Bear\r\nGarden glass-house, on the Bankside, crown window-glass, much\r\nexceeding French glass in all its qualifications, which may be squared\r\ninto all sizes of sashes for windows, and other uses, and may be had\r\nat most glaziers in London.\" From Strype's _Survey_ it is evident that\r\nthe glass house was in Bear Garden Alley, but not on the site of the\r\nold Bear Garden.]\r\n\r\nIn the map which he gives of this region (reproduced on page 245) the\r\nposition of the Hope is clearly marked by the square near the middle\r\nof Bear Alley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nROSSETER'S BLACKFRIARS, OR PORTER'S HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Rosseter, the poet and musician, first appears as a theatrical\r\nmanager in 1610, when he secured a royal patent for the Children of\r\nthe Queen's Revels to act at Whitefriars. This company performed there\r\nsuccessfully under his management until March, 1613, when, for some\r\nunknown reason, he formed a partnership with Philip Henslowe, who was\r\nmanaging the Lady Elizabeth's Men at the Swan. The two companies were\r\ncombined, and the new organization, under the name of \"The Lady\r\nElizabeth's Men,\" made use of both playhouses, the Swan as a summer\r\nand the Whitefriars as a winter home.\r\n\r\nAs already explained in the preceding chapters, Rosseter's lease on\r\nthe Whitefriars Playhouse was to expire in 1614, and apparently he was\r\nunable to renew the lease.[568] Naturally he and his partner Henslowe\r\nwere anxious to secure a private playhouse in the city to serve as a\r\nwinter home for their troupe, especially since the Swan was poorly\r\nsituated for winter patronage. This may explain the following entry in\r\nSir George Buc's Office-Book: \"July 13, 1613, for a license to erect a\r\nnew playhouse in Whitefriars &c. £20.\"[569] The new playhouse,\r\nhowever, was not built. Probably the opposition of the inhabitants of\r\nthe district led to its prohibition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: Nathaniel Field, the leading actor at Whitefriars,\r\npublished _A Woman is a Weathercock_ in 1612, with the statement to\r\nthe reader: \"If thou hast anything to say to me, thou know'st where to\r\nhear of me for a year or two, and no more, I assure thee.\" Possibly\r\nthis reflects the failure of the managers to renew the lease; after\r\n1614 Field did not know where he would be acting. But editors have\r\ngenerally regarded it as meaning that Field intended to withdraw from\r\nacting.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 52.]\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of one year, in March, 1614, Rosseter withdrew from\r\nhis partnership with Henslowe, and on the old patent of the Children\r\nof the Queen's Revels (which he had retained) organized a new company\r\nto travel in the country.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1615, he and certain others, Philip Kingman,\r\nRobert Jones, and Ralph Reeve, secured a lease of \"diverse buildings,\r\ncellars, sollars, chambers, and yards for the building of a playhouse\r\nthereupon for the better practising and exercise of the said Children\r\nof the Revels; all which premises are situate and being within the\r\nprecinct of the Blackfriars, near Puddlewharf, in the suburbs of\r\nLondon, called by the name of the Lady Saunders's House, or otherwise\r\nPorter's Hall.\"[570] It was their purpose to convert this hall into a\r\nplayhouse to rival the near-by Blackfriars; and in accordance with\r\nthis purpose, on June 3, 1615, Rosseter secured a royal license under\r\nthe Great Seal of England \"to erect, build, and set up in and upon the\r\nsaid premises before mentioned one convenient playhouse for the said\r\nChildren of the Revels, the same playhouse to be used by the Children\r\nof the Revels for the time being of the Queene's Majesty, and for the\r\nPrince's Players, and for the Lady Elizabeth's Players.\"[571]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 277. For the\r\nlocation of Puddlewharf see the map of the Blackfriars precinct on\r\npage 94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 277.]\r\n\r\nThe work of converting Porter's Hall into a playhouse seems to have\r\nbegun at once. On September 26, 1615, the Privy Council records \"that\r\none Rosseter, and others, having obtained license under the Great Seal\r\nof England for the building of a playhouse, have pulled down [i.e.,\r\nstripped the interior of] a great messuage in Puddlewharf, which was\r\nsometimes the house of the Lady Saunders, within the precinct of the\r\nBlackfriars, and are now erecting a new playhouse in that place.\"[572]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: _Ibid._, p. 373.]\r\n\r\nThe city authorities, always hostile to the actors and jealous of any\r\nnew theatres, made so vigorous a complaint to the Privy Council that\r\nthe Lords of the Council \"thought fit to send for Rosseter.\" He came,\r\nbringing his royal license. This document was carefully \"perused by\r\nthe Lord Chief Justice of England,\" who succeeded in discovering in\r\nthe wording of one of its clauses a trivial flaw that would enable the\r\nPrivy Council, on a technicality, to prohibit the building: \"The Lord\r\nChief Justice did deliver to their Lordships that the license granted\r\nto the said Rosseter did extend to the building of a playhouse without\r\nthe liberties of London, and not within the city.\"[573] Now, in 1608\r\nthe liberty of Blackfriars had by a special royal grant been placed\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the city. Rosseter's license unluckily had\r\ndescribed the Lady Saunders's house as being \"in the suburbs,\" though,\r\nof course, the description was otherwise specific enough: \"all which\r\npremises are situate and being within the precinct of the Blackfriars,\r\nnear Puddlewharf, in the suburbs of London, called by the name of the\r\nLady Saunders's House, or otherwise Porter's Hall.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 573: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 373.]\r\n\r\nSince \"the inconveniences urged by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were\r\nmany,\" the Lords of the Privy Council decided to take advantage of the\r\nflaw discovered by the Lord Chief Justice, and prohibit the erection\r\nof the playhouse. Their order, issued September 26, 1615, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     It was this day ordered by their Lordships that there shall\r\n     be no playhouse erected in that place, and that the Lord\r\n     Mayor of London shall straightly prohibit the said Rosseter\r\n     and the rest of the patentees, and their workmen to proceed\r\n     in the making and converting the said building into a\r\n     playhouse. And if any of the patentees or their workmen\r\n     shall proceed in their intended building contrary to this\r\n     their Lordships' inhibition, that then the Lord Mayor shall\r\n     commit him or them so offending unto prison and certify\r\n     their Lordships of their contempt in that behalf.[574]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThis order, for the time being, halted work on the new playhouse. The\r\nChildren of the Revels were forced to spend the next year traveling in\r\nthe provinces; and the Lady Elizabeth's Men and Prince Charles's Men\r\nhad to remain on the Bankside and endure the oppressions of Henslowe\r\nand later of Meade. Possibly their sufferings at the hands of Meade\r\nled them to urge Rosseter to complete at once the much desired house\r\nin the city. At any rate, in the winter of 1616, Rosseter, believing\r\nhimself strongly enough entrenched behind his royal patent, resumed\r\nwork on converting Porter's Hall into a theatre. The city authorities\r\nissued \"diverse commandments and prohibitions,\" but he paid no\r\nattention to these, and pushed the work to completion. The building\r\nseems to have been ready for the actors about the first of January,\r\n1617. Thereupon the company which had been occupying the Hope deserted\r\nthat playhouse and \"came over\" to Rosseter's Blackfriars.[575] In the\r\nnew playhouse they presented Nathaniel Field's comedy, _Amends for\r\nLadies_, which was printed the following year \"as it was acted at the\r\nBlackfriars both by the Prince's Servants and the Lady Elizabeth's.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: See the chapter on \"The Hope.\"]\r\n\r\nThe actors, however, were not allowed to enjoy their new home very\r\nlong. On January 27, 1617, the Privy Council dispatched the following\r\nletter to the Lord Mayor:\r\n\r\n     Whereas His Majesty is informed that notwithstanding diverse\r\n     commandments and prohibitions to the contrary, there be\r\n     certain persons that go about to set up a playhouse in the\r\n     Blackfriars near unto His Majesty's Wardrobe, and for that\r\n     purpose have lately erected and made fit a building, which\r\n     is almost if not fully finished. You shall understand that\r\n     His Majesty hath this day expressly signified his pleasure\r\n     that the same shall be pulled down, so as it be made unfit\r\n     for any such use; whereof we require your Lordship to take\r\n     notice and to cause it to be performed accordingly, with all\r\n     speed, and thereupon to certify us of your proceeding.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that an order so peremptory, carrying the\r\nauthority both of the Privy Council and of the King, and requiring an\r\nimmediate report, was performed \"with all speed.\" After this we hear\r\nnothing more of the playhouse in Puddlewharf.[576]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: I can find no further reference to the Puddlewharf\r\nTheatre either in the _Records_ of the Privy Council or in the\r\n_Remembrancia_ of the City. Collier, however, in his _History of\r\nEnglish Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 384, says: \"The city authorities\r\nproceeded immediately to the work, and before three days had elapsed,\r\nthe Privy Council was duly and formally made acquainted with the fact\r\nthat Rosseter's theatre had been 'made unfit for any such use' as that\r\nfor which it had been constructed.\" Collier fails to cite his\r\nauthority for the statement; the passage he quotes may be found in the\r\norder of the Privy Council printed above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PHOENIX, OR COCKPIT IN DRURY LANE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe private playhouse opened in Drury Lane[577] in 1617 seems to have\r\nbeen officially named \"The Phoenix\"; but to the players and the\r\npublic alike it was more commonly known as \"The Cockpit.\" This implies\r\nsome earlier connection of the site or of the building with\r\ncock-fighting, from time out of mind a favorite sport in England.\r\nStowe writes in his _Survey_: \"Cocks of the game are yet cherished by\r\ndiverse men for their pleasures, much money being laid on their heads,\r\nwhen they fight in pits, whereof some be costly made for that\r\npurpose.\" These pits, it seems, were circular in shape, and if large\r\nenough might well be used for dramatic purposes. Shakespeare, in\r\n_Henry V_ (1599), likens his playhouse to a cockpit:\r\n\r\n                           Can this cockpit hold\r\n     The vasty fields of France? or may we cram\r\n     Within this wooden O the very casques\r\n     That did affright the air at Agincourt?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: Its exact position in Drury Lane is indicated by an\r\norder of the Privy Council, June 8, 1623, concerning the paving of a\r\nstreet at the rear of the theatre: \"Whereas the highway leading along\r\nthe backside of the Cockpit Playhouse near Lincolns Inn Fields, and\r\nthe street called Queens Street adjoining to the same, are become very\r\nfoul,\" etc. (See The Malone Society _Collections_, I, 383. Queens\r\nStreet may be readily found in Faithorne's _Map of London_.) Malone\r\n(_Variorum_, III, 53) states that \"it was situated opposite the Castle\r\nTavern.\" The site is said to be marked by Pit Court.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible, then, that the building was an old cockpit made into a\r\nplayhouse. Howes,[578] in enumerating the London theatres, says: \"Five\r\ninns or common hostelries turned into playhouses, one cockpit, St.\r\nPaul's singing-school,\" etc. And Thomas Randolph, in verses prefixed\r\nto James Shirley's _Grateful Servant_ (printed in 1630 as it was acted\r\n\"in the private house in Drury Lane\"), suggests the same\r\nmetamorphosis:\r\n\r\n     When thy intelligence on the Cockpit stage\r\n     Gives it a soul from her immortal rage,\r\n     I hear the Muse's birds with full delight\r\n     Sing where the birds of Mars were wont to fight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: Stow's _Annals_ (1631), p. 1004.]\r\n\r\nBut in this fantastic conceit Randolph may have been thinking simply\r\nof the name of the theatre; possibly he knew nothing of its early\r\nhistory. On the whole it seems more likely that the playhouse was\r\nnewly erected in 1617 upon the site of an old cockpit. The name\r\n\"Phoenix\" suggests that possibly the old cockpit had been destroyed\r\nby fire, and that from its ashes had arisen a new building.[579]\r\nHowes describes the Phoenix as being in 1617 \"a new playhouse,\"[580]\r\nand Camden, who is usually accurate in such matters, refers to it in\r\nthe same year as \"nuper erectum.\"[581]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: Some scholars have supposed that the playhouse, when\r\nattacked by the apprentices in 1617, was burned, and that the name\r\n\"Phoenix\" was given to the building after its reconstruction. But\r\nthe building was not burned; it was merely wrecked on the inside by\r\napprentices.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: Continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (1631), p. 1026.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: William Camden, _Annals_, under the date of March 4,\r\n1617. Yet Sir Sidney Lee (_A Life of William Shakespeare_, p. 60)\r\nsays, \"built about 1610.\"]\r\n\r\nOf its size and shape all our information comes from James Wright, who\r\nin his _Historia Histrionica_[582] tells us that the Cockpit differed\r\nin no essential feature from Blackfriars and Salisbury Court, \"for\r\nthey were all three built almost exactly alike for form and bigness.\"\r\nSince we know that Blackfriars and Salisbury Court were small\r\nrectangular theatres, the former constructed in a hall forty-six feet\r\nbroad and sixty-six feet long, the latter erected on a plot of ground\r\nforty-two feet broad and one hundred and forty feet long, we are not\r\nleft entirely ignorant of the shape and the approximate size of the\r\nCockpit.[583] And from Middleton's _Inner Temple Masque_ (1618) we\r\nlearn that it was constructed of brick. Its sign, presumably, was that\r\nof a phoenix rising out of flames.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: Hazlitt's Dodsley, XV, 408.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: Fleay and Lawrence are wrong in supposing that the\r\nCockpit was circular.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SITE OF THE COCKPIT IN DRURY LANE\r\n\r\nThe site is marked by Cockpit Court. (From Rocque's _Map of London_,\r\n1746.)]\r\n\r\nThe playhouse was erected and managed by Christopher Beeston,[584] one\r\nof the most important actors and theatrical managers of the\r\nElizabethan period. We first hear of him as a member of Shakespeare's\r\ntroupe. In 1602 he joined Worcester's Company. In 1612 he became the\r\nmanager of Queen Anne's Company at the Red Bull. He is described at\r\nthat time as \"a thriving man, and one that was of ability and\r\nmeans.\"[585] He continued as manager of the Queen Anne's Men at the\r\nRed Bull until 1617, when he transferred them to his new playhouse in\r\nDrury Lane.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: _Alias_ Christopher Hutchinson. Several actors of the\r\nday employed _aliases_: Nicholas Wilkinson, _alias_ Tooley; Theophilus\r\nBourne, _alias_ Bird; James Dunstan, _alias_ Tunstall, etc. Whether\r\nBeeston admitted other persons to a share in the building I cannot\r\nlearn. In a passage quoted by Malone (_Variorum_, III, 121) from the\r\nHerbert Manuscript, dated February 20, 1635, there is a reference to\r\n\"housekeepers,\" indicating that Beeston had then admitted \"sharers\" in\r\nthe proprietorship of the building. And in an order of the Privy\r\nCouncil, May 12, 1637 (The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 392), we\r\nread: \"Command the keepers of the playhouse called the Cockpit in\r\nDrury Lane, who either live in it or have relation to it, not to\r\npermit plays to be acted there till further order.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: Wallace, _Three London Theatres_, p. 35.]\r\n\r\nThe playhouse seems to have been ready to receive the players about\r\nthe end of February, 1617. We know that they were still performing at\r\nthe Red Bull as late as February 23;[586] but by March 4 they had\r\ncertainly moved to the Cockpit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: Wallace, _ibid._, pp. 32, 46. John Smith was delivering\r\nsilk and other clothes to the Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull from\r\n1612 until February 23, 1617.]\r\n\r\nOn the latter date, during the performance of a play, the Cockpit was\r\nentered by a mob of disorderly persons, who proceeded to demolish the\r\ninterior. The occasion for the wrecking of the new playhouse was the\r\nShrove Tuesday saturnalia of the London apprentices, who from time\r\nimmemorial had employed this holiday to pull down houses of ill-fame\r\nin the suburbs. That the Cockpit was situated in the neighborhood of\r\nsuch houses cannot be doubted. We may suppose that the mob, fresh from\r\nsacking buildings, had crowded into the playhouse in the afternoon,\r\nand before the play was over had wrecked that building too.\r\n\r\nThe event created a great stir at the time. William Camden, in his\r\n_Annals_, wrote under the date of March 4, 1617:\r\n\r\n     Theatrum ludiorum, nuper erectum in Drury Lane, a furente\r\n     multitudine diruitur, et apparatus dilaceratur.\r\n\r\nHowes, in his continuation of Stow's _Annals_, writes:\r\n\r\n     Shrove-Tuesday, the fourth of March, many disordered persons\r\n     of sundry kinds, amongst whom were very many young boys and\r\n     lads, that assembled themselves in Lincolnes Inn Field,\r\n     Finsbury Field, in Ratcliffe, and Stepney Field, where in\r\n     riotous manner they did beat down the walls and windows of\r\n     many victualing houses and of all other houses which they\r\n     suspected to be bawdy houses. And that afternoon they\r\n     spoiled a new playhouse, and did likewise more hurt in\r\n     diverse other places.[587]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: _Annals_ (1631), p. 1026.]\r\n\r\nThat several persons were killed, and many injured, is disclosed by a\r\nletter from the Privy Council to the Lord Mayor, dated March 5, 1617:\r\n\r\n     It is not unknown unto you what tumultuous outrages were\r\n     yesterday committed near unto the city of London in diverse\r\n     places by a rowt of lewd and loose persons, apprentices and\r\n     others, especially in Lincolns Inn Fields and Drury Lane,\r\n     where in attempting to pull down a playhouse belonging to\r\n     the Queen's Majesty's Servants, there were diverse persons\r\n     slain, and others hurt and wounded, the multitude there\r\n     assembled being to the number of many thousands, as we are\r\n     credibly informed.[588]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 374. Collier, in\r\n_The History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 386, prints a long\r\nballad on the event; but he does not give its source, and its\r\ngenuineness has been questioned. The following year threats to pull\r\ndown the Fortune, the Red Bull, and the Cockpit led to the setting of\r\nspecial watches. See The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 377.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen's Men returned to the Red Bull and acted there until their\r\nruined playhouse could be repaired. Three months later, on June 3,\r\nthey again occupied the Cockpit,[589] and continued there until the\r\ndeath of Queen Anne on March 2, 1619.[590]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: Greenstreet, Documents, _The New Shakspere Society's\r\nTransactions_ (1880-86), p. 504.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: Mr. Wallace (_Three London Theatres_, p. 29) says that\r\nthe documents he prints make it \"as certain as circumstances\r\nunsupported by contemporary declaration can make it, that Queen Anne's\r\ncompany occupied the Red Bull continuously from the time of its\r\nerection ... till their dissolution, 1619.\" His documents make it\r\ncertain only that Queen Anne's Men occupied the Red Bull until\r\nFebruary 23, 1617. Other documents prove that they occupied the\r\nCockpit from 1617 until 1619. (Note the letter of the Privy Council\r\nquoted above.) The documents printed by Greenstreet show that Queen\r\nAnne's Men moved to the Cockpit on June 3, 1617, and continued there.]\r\n\r\nThis event led to the dissolution of the company. For a year or more\r\nits members had been \"falling at variance and strife amongst\r\nthemselves,\" and when the death of the Queen deprived them of a\r\n\"service,\" they \"separated and divided themselves into other\r\ncompanies.\"[591] As a result of the quarrels certain members of the\r\ncompany made charges against their former manager, Beeston: \"The said\r\nBeeston having from the beginning a greater care for his own private\r\ngain, and not respecting the good of these defendants and the rest of\r\nhis fellows and companions, hath in the place and trust aforesaid much\r\nenriched himself, and hath of late given over his coat and\r\ncondition,[592] and separated and divided himself from these\r\ndefendants, carrying away not only all the furniture and apparel,\"\r\netc.[593] The charges against Beeston's honesty may be dismissed; but\r\nit seems clear that he had withdrawn from his former companions, and\r\nwas preparing to entertain a new troupe of actors at his playhouse.\r\nAnd Beeston himself tells us, on November 23, 1619, that \"after Her\r\nMajesty's decease, he entered into the service of the most noble\r\nPrince Charles.\"[594] Thus Prince Charles's Men, after their\r\nunfortunate experiences at the Hope and at Rosseter's Blackfriars,\r\ncame to Beeston's playhouse, where they remained until 1622. In the\r\nspring of that year, however, they moved to the Curtain, and the\r\nPrincess Elizabeth's Men occupied the Cockpit.[595] Under their\r\ntenancy, the playhouse seems to have attained an enviable reputation.\r\nHeminges and Condell, in the epistle to the readers, prefixed to the\r\nFolio of Shakespeare (1623), bear testimony to this in the following\r\nterms: \"And though you be a Magistrate of Wit, and sit on the stage at\r\nBlackfriars, or the Cockpit, to arraign plays daily.\" A further\r\nindication of their prosperity is to be found in the records of St.\r\nGiles's Church; for when in 1623 the parish undertook the erection of\r\na new church building, \"the players of the Cockpit,\" we are informed,\r\ncontributed the large sum of £20, and the proprietors, represented by\r\nChristopher Beeston, gave £19 1_s._ 5_d._[596]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: Wallace, _Three London Theatres_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: He had joined Prince Charles's Men.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 593: Wallace, _Three London Theatres_, p. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 594: _Ibid._, p. 40. Fleay, Murray, and others have\r\ncontended that the Princess Elizabeth's Men came to the Cockpit in\r\n1619, and have denied the accuracy of the title-page of _The Witch of\r\nEdmonton_ (1658), which declares that play to have been \"acted by the\r\nPrince's Servants at the Cockpit often.\" (See Fleay, _A Chronicle\r\nHistory of the London Stage_, p. 299.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 595: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: John Parton, _Some Account of the Hospital and Parish\r\nof St. Giles in the Fields_, p. 235. From a parish entry in 1660 we\r\nlearn that the players had to contribute 2_d._ to the parish poor for\r\neach day that there was acting at the Cockpit. (See _ibid._, p. 236.)]\r\n\r\nThe Princess Elizabeth's Men continued to act at the Cockpit until\r\nMay, 1625, when all theatres were closed on account of the plague.\r\nBeeston made this the occasion to organize a new company called \"Queen\r\nHenrietta's Men\"; and when the theatres were allowed to reopen, about\r\nDecember, 1625,[597] this new company was in possession of the\r\nCockpit. But the reputation of the playhouse seems not to have been\r\nenhanced by the performances of this troupe. In 1629, Lenton, in _The\r\nYoung Gallant's Whirligig_, writes sneeringly:\r\n\r\n     The Cockpit heretofore would serve his wit,\r\n     But now upon the Friars' Stage he'll sit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: In the _Middlesex County Records_, III, 6, we find that\r\non December 6, 1625, because \"the drawing of people together to places\r\nwas a great means of spreading and continuing the infection ... this\r\nCourt doth prohibit the players of the house at the Cockpit, being\r\nnext to His Majesty's Court at Whitehall, commanding them to surcease\r\nall such their proceedings until His Majesty's pleasure be further\r\nsignified.\" Apparently the playhouses in general had been allowed to\r\nresume performances; and since by December 24 there had been no deaths\r\nfrom the plague for a week, the special inhibition of the Cockpit\r\nPlayhouse was soon lifted.]\r\n\r\nAnd in the following year, 1630, Thomas Carew in verses prefixed to\r\nDavenport's _Just Italian_, attacks the Red Bull and the Cockpit as\r\n\"adulterate\" stages where \"noise prevails,\" and \"not a tongue of th'\r\nuntun'd kennel can a line repeat of serious sense.\" Queen Henrietta's\r\nMen probably continued to occupy the building until May 12, 1636, when\r\nthe theatres were again closed on account of a serious outbreak of the\r\nplague. The plague continued for nearly a year and a half, and during\r\nthis time the company was dissolved.[598]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: \"When Her Majesty's Servants were at the Cockpit, being\r\nall at liberty, they dispersed themselves to several companies.\"\r\n(Heton's Patent, 1639, _The Shakespeare Society Papers_, IV, 96.)]\r\n\r\nBefore the plague had ceased, early in 1637, \"Mr. Beeston was\r\ncommanded to make a company of boys.\"[599] In the Office-Book of the\r\nLord Chamberlain we find, under the date of February 21, 1637:\r\n\"Warrant to swear Mr. Christopher Beeston His Majesty's Servant in the\r\nplace of Governor of the new company of The King's and Queen's\r\nBoys.\"[600] The first recorded performance by this new company was at\r\nCourt on February 7, 1637.[601] On February 23, the number of deaths\r\nfrom the plague having diminished, acting was again permitted; but at\r\nthe expiration of one week, on March 2, the number of deaths having\r\nincreased, all playhouses were again closed. During this single week\r\nthe King's and Queen's Boys, we may suppose, acted at the\r\nCockpit.[602]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: Herbert Manuscript, Malone, _Variorum_, III, 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 600: Stopes, \"Shakespeare's Fellows and Followers,\"\r\nShakespeare _Jahrbuch_, XLVI, 99. In 1639 Heton applied for a patent\r\nas \"Governor\" of the company at Salisbury Court.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 601: On May 10 Beeston was paid for \"two plays acted by the\r\nNew Company.\" See Stopes, \"Shakespeare's Fellows and Followers,\" in\r\nthe Shakespeare _Jahrbuch_, XLVI, 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602: Herbert Manuscript, Malone, _Variorum_, III, 240.]\r\n\r\nOn May 12, Beeston was arrested and brought before the Privy Council\r\nfor having allowed his Boys to act a play at the Cockpit during the\r\ninhibition.[603] In his apology he explains this as follows:\r\n\"Petitioner being commanded to erect and prepare a company of young\r\nactors for Their Majesties's service, and being desirous to know how\r\nthey profited by his instructions, invited some noblemen and\r\ngentlemen to see them act at his house, the Cockpit. For which, since\r\nhe perceives it is imputed as a fault, he is very sorry, and craves\r\npardon.\"[604]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 392.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604: _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1636-1637_, p.\r\n254.]\r\n\r\nOn September 17, 1637, \"Christopher Beeston, His Majesty's servant, by\r\npetition to the Board, showed that he hath many young actors lying\r\nunpractised by reason of the restraint occasioned by infection of the\r\nplague, whereby they are much disabled to perform their service, and\r\nbesought that they might have leave to practise. It was ordered that\r\nBeeston should be at liberty to practise his actors at Michaelmas next\r\n[September 29], if there be no considerable increase of the sickness,\r\nnor that there die more than died last week.\"[605]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: _Ibid._, _1637_, p. 420.]\r\n\r\nOn October 2, 1637, the plague having abated, all playhouses were\r\nopened, and the King's and Queen's Boys, Herbert tells us, began to\r\nplay at the Cockpit \"the same day.\"[606] Here, under the popular name\r\nof \"Beeston's Boys,\" they enjoyed a long and successful career, which\r\nended only with the prohibition of acting in 1642.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 240.]\r\n\r\nIn 1639 Christopher Beeston died, and the position of Governor of the\r\nBoys was conferred upon his son, William Beeston, who had long been\r\nassociated in the management of the company,[607] and who, if we may\r\nbelieve Francis Kirkman, was admirably qualified for the position. In\r\ndedicating to him _The Loves and Adventures of Clerico and Lozia_,\r\nKirkman says:\r\n\r\n     Divers times in my hearing, to the admiration of the whole\r\n     company, you have most judiciously discoursed of Poesie:\r\n     which is the cause I presume to choose you for my patron and\r\n     protector, who are the happiest interpreter and judge of our\r\n     English stage-plays this nation ever produced; which the\r\n     poets and actors of these times cannot (without ingratitude)\r\n     deny; for I have heard the chief and most ingenious\r\n     acknowledge their fames and profits essentially sprung from\r\n     your instruction, judgment, and fancy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: He is referred to as their Governor on August 10, 1639;\r\nsee Malone, _Variorum_, III, 159.]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all this, William Beeston's career as Governor was of\r\nshort duration. About the first of May, 1640, he allowed the Boys to\r\nact without license a play that gave great offense to the King.\r\nHerbert, the Master of the Revels, writes of this play that it \"had\r\nrelation to the passages of the King's journey into the north, and was\r\ncomplained of by His Majesty to me, with command to punish the\r\noffenders.\"[608] In the Office-Book of the Lord Chamberlain, under the\r\ndate of May 3, 1640, we read:\r\n\r\n     Whereas William Beeston and the company of the players of\r\n     the Cockpit, in Drury Lane, have lately acted a new play\r\n     without any license from the Master of His Majesty's Revels,\r\n     and being commanded to forbear playing or acting of the same\r\n     play by the said Master of the Revels, and commanded\r\n     likewise to forbear all manner of playing, have\r\n     notwithstanding, in contempt of the authority of the said\r\n     Master of the Revels, and the power granted unto him under\r\n     the Great Seal of England, acted the said play, and others,\r\n     to the prejudice of His Majesty's service, and in contempt\r\n     of the Office of the Revels, [whereby] he and they and all\r\n     other companies ever have been and ought to be governed and\r\n     regulated: These are therefore in His Majesty's name, and\r\n     signification of his royal pleasure, to command the said\r\n     William Beeston and the rest of that company of the Cockpit\r\n     players from henceforth and upon sight hereof, to forbear to\r\n     act any plays whatsoever until they shall be restored by the\r\n     said Master of the Revels unto their former liberty. Whereof\r\n     all parties concernable are to take notice, and conform\r\n     accordingly, as they and every one of them will answer it at\r\n     their peril.[609]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 241.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: Collier, _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_\r\n(1879), II, 32; Stopes, _op. cit._, p. 102.]\r\n\r\nHerbert records in his Office-Book:\r\n\r\n     On Monday the 4 May, 1640, William Beeston was taken by a\r\n     messenger and committed to the Marshalsea by my Lord\r\n     Chamberlain's warrant, for playing a play without license.\r\n     The same day the company at the Cockpit was commanded by my\r\n     Lord Chamberlain's warrant to forbear playing, for playing\r\n     when they were forbidden by me, and for other disobedience,\r\n     and lay still Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. On Thursday,\r\n     at my Lord Chamberlain's entreaty, I gave them their\r\n     liberty, and upon their petition of submission subscribed by\r\n     the players, I restored them to their liberty on\r\n     Thursday.[610]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 610: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 241. Herbert did not forget\r\nBeeston's insubordination, and in 1660, in issuing to Beeston a\r\nlicense to use the Salisbury Court Playhouse, he inserted clauses to\r\nprevent further difficulty of this kind (see _Variorum_, III, 243).]\r\n\r\nTo this period of Beeston's imprisonment I should refer the puzzling\r\nEpilogue of Brome's _The Court Beggar_:\r\n\r\n     There's wit in that now. But this small Poet vents none but\r\n     his own, and his by whose care and directions this Stage is\r\n     govern'd, who has for many years, both in his father's days,\r\n     and since, directed Poets to write and Players to speak,\r\n     till he trained up these youths here to what they are now.\r\n     Aye, some of 'em from before they were able to say a grace\r\n     of two lines long to have more parts in their pates than\r\n     would fill so many Dry-vats. And to be serious with you, if\r\n     after all this, by the venomous practice of some, who study\r\n     nothing more than his destruction, he should fail us, both\r\n     Poets and Players would be at loss in reputation.\r\n\r\nHis \"destruction\" was wrought, nevertheless, for as a result of his\r\nindiscretion he was deposed from his position as Governor of the\r\nKing's and Queen's Company, and William Davenant was appointed in his\r\nplace. In the Office-Book of the Lord Chamberlain under the date of\r\nJune 27, 1640,[611] appears the following entry with the heading, \"Mr.\r\nDavenant Governor of the Cockpit Players\":\r\n\r\n     Whereas in the playhouse or theatre commonly called the\r\n     Cockpit, in Drury Lane, there are a company of players\r\n     authorized by me (as Lord Chamberlain to His Majesty) to\r\n     play or act under the title of The King's and Queen's\r\n     Servants, and that by reason of some disorders lately\r\n     amongst them committed they are disabled in their service\r\n     and quality: These are therefore to signify that by the same\r\n     authority I do authorize and appoint William Davenant,\r\n     Gent., one of Her Majesty's servants, for me and in my name\r\n     to take into his government and care the said company of\r\n     players, to govern, order, and dispose of them for action\r\n     and presentments, and all their affairs in the said house,\r\n     as in his discretion shall seem best to conduce to His\r\n     Majesty's service in that quality. And I do hereby enjoin\r\n     and command them, all and every of them, that are so\r\n     authorized to play in the said house under the privilege of\r\n     His or Her Majesty's Servants, and every one belonging as\r\n     prentices or servants to those actors to play under the same\r\n     privilege, that they obey the said Mr. Davenant and follow\r\n     his orders and directions, as they will answer the contrary;\r\n     which power and privilege he is to continue and enjoy during\r\n     that lease which Mrs. Elizabeth Beeston, _alias_ Hucheson,\r\n     hath or doth hold in the said playhouse, provided he be\r\n     still accountable to me for his care and well ordering the\r\n     said company.[612]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 611: Stopes (_op. cit._) dates this June 5, but Collier,\r\nMalone, and Chalmers all give June 27, and Mrs. Stopes is not always\r\nquite accurate in such matters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: Collier, _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_\r\n(1879), II, 32, note 1.]\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of Davenant the company acted at the Cockpit until\r\nthe closing of the theatres two years later.\r\n\r\nThe history of the playhouse during the troubled years that followed\r\nis varied. In the churchwarden's account of St. Giles's Parish is\r\nfound the entry: \"1646. Paid and given to the teacher at the Cockpit\r\nof the children, 6_d._\"[613] Apparently the old playhouse was then\r\nbeing temporarily used as a school.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 613: John Parton, _Some Account of the Hospital and Parish\r\nof St. Giles in the Fields_, p. 235.]\r\n\r\nWright, in his _Historia Histrionica_, tells us that at the outbreak\r\nof the civil war most of the actors had joined the royal army and\r\nserved His Majesty, \"though in a different, yet more honorable\r\ncapacity.\" Some were killed, many won distinction; and \"when the wars\r\nwere over, and the royalists totally subdued, most of 'em who were\r\nleft alive gathered to London, and for a subsistence endeavored to\r\nrevive their old trade privately. They made up one company out of all\r\nthe scattered members of several, and in the winter before the King's\r\nmurder, 1648, they ventured to act some plays, with as much caution\r\nand privacy as could be, at the Cockpit.\" John Evelyn records in his\r\n_Diary_, under the date of February 5, 1648: \"Saw a tragicomedy acted\r\nin the Cockpit after there had been none of these diversions for many\r\nyears during the war.\" Trouble, however, was brewing for these daring\r\nactors. As Wright records: \"They continued undisturbed for three or\r\nfour days, but at last, as they were presenting the tragedy of _The\r\nBloody Brother_ (in which Lowin acted Aubery; Taylor, Rollo; Pollard,\r\nthe Cook; Burt, Latorch; and, I think, Hart, Otto), a party of\r\nfoot-soldiers beset the house, surprised 'em about the middle of the\r\nplay, and carried 'em away in their habits, not admitting them to\r\nshift, to Hatton House, then a prison, where, having detained them\r\nsome time, they plundered them of their clothes, and let 'em loose\r\nagain.\"[614]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: Hazlitt's Dodsley, XV, 409.]\r\n\r\nIn 1649 the interior of the building was sacked, if we may trust the\r\nmanuscript note entered in the Phillipps copy of Stow's _Annals_\r\n(1631): \"The playhouse in Salisbury Court, in Fleet Street, was pulled\r\ndown by a company of soldiers set on by the sectaries of these sad\r\ntimes, on Saturday the 24 day of March, 1649. The Phoenix, in Drury\r\nLane, was pulled down also this day, being Saturday the 24 day of\r\nMarch, 1649, by the same soldiers.\"[615] In the passage quoted,\r\n\"pulled-down\" merely means that the stage and its equipment, and\r\npossibly a part of the galleries and the seats, were wrecked, not that\r\nthe walls of the building itself were thrown down.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: See _The Academy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314. The\r\nsoldiers here mentioned also \"pulled down on the inside\" the Fortune\r\nplayhouse.]\r\n\r\nIn 1656 Sir William Davenant undertook to create a form of dramatic\r\nentertainment which would be tolerated by the authorities. The Lord\r\nProtector was known to be a lover of music. Sir William, therefore,\r\napplied for permission to give operatic entertainments, \"after the\r\nmanner of the antients,\" the \"story sung in recitative music,\" and the\r\nrepresentation made \"by the art of perspective in scenes.\" To such\r\nentertainments, he thought, no one could object. He was wise enough to\r\ngive his first performances at Rutland House; but in 1658 he moved to\r\nthe Cockpit, where, says Aubrey, \"were acted very well, _stylo\r\nrecitativo_, _Sir Francis Drake_ and _The Siege of Rhodes_ (1st and 2d\r\nparts). It did affect the eye and ear extremely. This first brought\r\nscenes in fashion in England; before at plays was only a hanging.\"\r\nThus the Cockpit had the distinction of being the first English\r\nplayhouse in which scenery was employed, and, one should add, the\r\nfirst English home of the opera.[616]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: For a discussion of Davenant's attempts to introduce\r\nthe opera into England, see W.J. Lawrence, _The Elizabethan Playhouse_\r\n(Second Series), pp. 129 ff.]\r\n\r\nLater in the same year, 1658, Davenant exhibited at the Cockpit _The\r\nCruelty of the Spaniards in Peru_; but this performance excited the\r\nsuspicion of the authorities, who on December 23 sent for \"the poet\r\nand the actors\" to explain \"by what authority the same is exposed to\r\npublic view.\"[617]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 617: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 93; Collier, _The History of\r\nEnglish Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), II, 48.]\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1659,\" writes John Downes in his _Roscius Anglicanus_,\r\n\"General Monk marching then his army out of Scotland to London, Mr.\r\nRhodes, a bookseller, being wardrobe-keeper formerly (as I am\r\ninformed) to King Charles the First's company of commedians in\r\nBlackfriars, getting a license from the then governing state,[618]\r\nfitted up a house then for acting, called the _Cockpit_, in Drury\r\nLane, and in a short time completed his company.\" If this statement is\r\ncorrect, the time must have been early in the year 1659-60, and the\r\ncompany must have attempted at first to play without a proper license.\r\nFrom the _Middlesex County Records_ (III, 282), we learn that one of\r\ntheir important actors, Thomas Lilleston, was held under bond for\r\nhaving performed \"a public stage-play this present 4th of February\r\n[1659-60] in the Cockpit in Drury Lane in the parish of St.\r\nGiles-in-the-Fields, contrary to the law in that case made\"; and in\r\nthe Parish Book[619] of St. Giles we find the entry: \"1659. Received\r\nof Isack Smith, which he received at the Cockpit playhouse of several\r\noffenders, by order of the justices, £3 8_s._ 6_d._\" Shortly after\r\nthis, it is to be presumed, the company under Rhodes's management\r\nsecured the \"license of the then governing state\" mentioned by Downes,\r\nand continued thereafter without interruption. The star of this\r\ncompany was Betterton, whose splendid acting at once captivated\r\nLondon. Pepys went often to the theatre, and has left us some\r\ninteresting notes of his experiences there. On August 18, 1660, he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     Captain Ferrers, my Lord's Cornet, comes to us, who after\r\n     dinner took me and Creed to the Cockpit play, the first that\r\n     I have had time to see since my coming from sea, _The Loyall\r\n     Subject_, where one Kinaston, a boy, acted the Duke's\r\n     sister, but made the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my\r\n     life, only her voice not very good.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 618: For his troubles with the Master of the Revels see\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, _A Collection of Ancient Documents_, p. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 619: Parton, _op. cit._, p. 236.]\r\n\r\nAgain on October 11, 1660, he writes:\r\n\r\n     Here in the Park we met with Mr. Salisbury, who took Mr.\r\n     Creed and me to the Cockpit to see _The Moor of Venice_,\r\n     which was well done. Burt acted the Moor, by the same token\r\n     a very pretty lady that sat by me called out to see\r\n     Desdemona smothered.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the Cockpit falls outside the scope of the\r\npresent treatise. The reader who desires to trace the part the\r\nbuilding played in the Restoration would do well to consult the\r\nnumerous documents printed by Malone from the Herbert Manuscript.[620]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 620: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 244 ff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSALISBURY COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Salisbury Court Playhouse[621] was projected and built by two men\r\nwhose very names are unfamiliar to most students of the drama--Richard\r\nGunnell and William Blagrove. Yet Gunnell was a distinguished actor,\r\nand was associated with the ownership and management of at least two\r\ntheatres. Even so early as 1613 his reputation as a player was\r\nsufficient to warrant his inclusion as a full sharer in the\r\nPalsgrave's Company, then acting at the Fortune. When the Fortune was\r\nrebuilt after its destruction by fire in 1621, he purchased one of the\r\ntwelve shares in the new building, and rose to be manager of the\r\ncompany.[622] In addition to managing the company he also, as we learn\r\nfrom the Herbert Manuscript, supplied the actors with plays. In 1623\r\nhe composed _The Hungarian Lion_, obviously a comedy, and in the\r\nfollowing year _The Way to Content all Women, or How a Man May Please\r\nhis Wife_.[623] Of William Blagrove I can learn little more than that\r\nhe was Deputy to the Master of the Revels. In this capacity he signed\r\nthe license for Glapthorne's _Lady Mother_, October 15, 1635; and his\r\nname appears several times in the Herbert Manuscript in connection\r\nwith the payments of various companies.[624] Possibly he was related\r\nto Thomas Blagrove who during the reign of Elizabeth was an important\r\nmember of the Revels Office, and who for a time served as Master of\r\nthe Revels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: The playhouse discussed in this chapter was officially\r\nknown as \"The Salisbury Court Playhouse,\" and it should always be\r\nreferred to by that name. Unfortunately, owing to its situation near\r\nthe district of Whitefriars, it was sometimes loosely, though\r\nincorrectly, called \"Whitefriars.\" Since it had no relation whatever\r\nto the theatre formerly in the Manor-House of Whitefriars, a\r\nperpetuation of this false nomenclature is highly undesirable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 623: Chalmers's _Supplemental Apology_, pp. 216-17. He may\r\nalso have been the author of a play called _The Masque_, which Herbert\r\nin 1624 licensed: \"For the Palsgrave's Company, a new play called _The\r\nMasque_.\" In the list of manuscript plays collected by Warburton we\r\nfind the title _A Mask_, and the authorship ascribed to R. Govell.\r\nSince \"R. Govell\" is not otherwise heard of, we may reasonably suppose\r\nthat this was Warburton's reading of \"R. Gunell.\" Gunnell also\r\nprefixed a poem to the Works of Captain John Smith, 1626.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 624: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 66, 122, 176, 177.]\r\n\r\nWhat threw these two men together in a theatrical partnership we do\r\nnot know. But in the summer of 1629 they decided to build a private\r\nplayhouse to compete with the successful Blackfriars and Cockpit; and\r\nfor this purpose they leased from the Earl of Dorset a plot of ground\r\nsituated to the east of the precinct of Whitefriars. The ground thus\r\nleased opened on Salisbury Court; hence the name, \"The Salisbury Court\r\nPlayhouse.\" In the words of the legal document, the Earl of Dorset \"in\r\nconsideration that Richard Gunnell and William Blagrove should at\r\ntheir costs and charges erect a playhouse and other buildings at the\r\nlower end of Salisbury Court, in the parish of St. Bridges, in the\r\nward of Farringdon Without, did demise to the said Gunnell and\r\nBlagrove a piece of ground at the same lower end of Salisbury Court,\r\ncontaining one hundred and forty foot in length and forty-two in\r\nbreadth ... for forty-one years and a half.\" The lease was signed on\r\nJuly 6, 1629. Nine days later, on July 15, the Earl of Dorset, \"in\r\nconsideration of nine hundred and fifty pounds paid to the said late\r\nEarl by John Herne, of Lincoln's Inn, Esquire, did demise to hire the\r\nsaid piece of ground and [the] building [i.e., the playhouse]\r\nthereupon to be erected, and the rent reserved upon the said lease\r\nmade to Gunnell and Blagrove.\" Herne's lease was for a term of\r\nsixty-one years. The effect of this second lease was merely to make\r\nHerne, instead of the Earl of Dorset, the landlord of the players.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF THE SALISBURY COURT PROPERTY\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the lease. (Drawn by the author.)]\r\n\r\nThe plot of ground selected for the playhouse is described with\r\nexactness in the lease printed below. The letters inserted in brackets\r\nrefer to the accompanying diagram (see page 371):\r\n\r\n     All that soil and ground whereupon the Barn {A}, at the\r\n     lower end of the great back court, or yard of Salisbury\r\n     Court, now stands; and so much of the soil whereupon the\r\n     whole south end of the great stable in the said court or\r\n     yard stands, or contains, from that end of that stable\r\n     towards the north end thereof sixteen foot of assize, and\r\n     the whole breadth of the said stable {B}; and all the ground\r\n     and soil on the east and west side of that stable lying\r\n     directly against the said sixteen foot of ground at the\r\n     south end thereof between the wall of the great garden\r\n     belonging to the mansion called Dorset House and the wall\r\n     that severs the said Court from the lane called Water Lane\r\n     {C and D}; and all the ground and soil being between the\r\n     said walls on the east and west part thereof, and the said\r\n     barn, stable, and ground on both side the same on the south\r\n     and north parts thereof {E}. Which said several parcells of\r\n     soil and ground ... contain, in the whole length ... one\r\n     hundred and forty foot of assize, and in breadth ... forty\r\n     and two foot of assize, and lies together at the lower end\r\n     of the said Court.\r\n\r\nThis plot, one hundred and forty feet in length by forty-two in\r\nbreadth, was small for its purpose, and the playhouse must have\r\ncovered all the breadth and most of the length of the leased\r\nground;[625] there was no actual need of leaving any part of the plot\r\nvacant, for the theatre adjoined the Court, and \"free ingress, egress,\r\nand regress\" to the building were stipulated in the lease \"by,\r\nthrough, and on any part of the Court called Salisbury Court.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 625: The Blackfriars auditorium was sixty-six feet in length\r\nand forty-six feet in breadth.]\r\n\r\nAt once Gunnell and Blagrove set about the erection of their\r\nplayhouse. They may have utilized in some way the \"great barn\" which\r\noccupied most of their property; one of the legal documents printed by\r\nCunningham contains the phrase: \"and the great barn, which was\r\nafterwards the playhouse.\"[626] If this be true--I think it very\r\ndoubtful--the reconstruction must have been thorough, for Howes, in\r\nhis continuation of Stow's _Annals_ (1631), speaks of Salisbury Court\r\nas \"a new, fair playhouse\";[627] and in all respects it seems to have\r\nranked with the best.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 626: Cunningham, _The Shakespeare Society's Papers_, IV,\r\n104. In his _Handbook for London_ Cunningham says that the Salisbury\r\nCourt Playhouse \"was originally the 'barn.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627: _Annals_ (1631), p. 1004. In 1633 Prynne\r\n(_Histriomastix_) refers to it as a \"new theatre erected.\"]\r\n\r\nWe know very little of the building. But Wright, in his _Historia\r\nHistrionica_, informs us that it was \"almost exactly like\" the two\r\nother private houses, the Blackfriars and the Cockpit:\r\n\r\n     _True._ The Blackfriars, Cockpit, and Salisbury Court were\r\n     called private houses, and were very small to what we see\r\n     now. The Cockpit was standing since the Restoration, and\r\n     Rhodes' company acted there for some time.\r\n\r\n     _Love._ I have seen that.\r\n\r\n     _True._ Then you have seen the other two in effect, for they\r\n     were all three built almost exactly alike for form and\r\n     bigness.[628]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 628: Collier, _The History of English Dramatic Literature_\r\n(1879), III, 106, thought that Salisbury Court was a round playhouse,\r\nbasing his opinion on a line in Sharpe's _Noble Stranger_ acted at\r\n\"the private house in Salisbury Court\": \"Thy Stranger to the\r\nGlobe-like theatre.\"]\r\n\r\nIn spite of what Wright says, however, there is some reason for\r\nbelieving that Salisbury Court was smaller than the other two private\r\nhouses. The Epilogue to _Totenham Court_ refers to it as \"my little\r\nhouse\"; and the Epistle affixed to the second edition of _Sir Giles\r\nGoosecappe_ is said to convey the same impression of smallness.[629]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629: I have not been able to examine this. In the only copy\r\nof the second edition accessible to me the Epistle is missing.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Malone, Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, was\r\n\"one of the proprietors\" of the house, and held a \"ninth share\" in the\r\nprofits.[630] This, however, is not strictly accurate. Sir Henry, by\r\nvirtue of his power to license playhouses, demanded from each\r\norganization of players an annual fee. The King's Men gave him two\r\nbenefit performances a year; Christopher Beeston, on behalf of the\r\nCockpit in Drury Lane, paid him £60 a year; as for the rest, Herbert\r\ntells us that he had \"a share paid by the Fortune Players, and a share\r\nby the Bull Players, and a share by the Salisbury Court Players.\"[631]\r\nIt seems, therefore, that the Salisbury Court organization was divided\r\ninto eight shares, and that of the profits an extra, or ninth, share\r\nwas set aside as a fee for the Master of the Revels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 630: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: Halliwell-Phillipps, _A Collection of Ancient\r\nDocuments_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe playhouse was ready for use in all probability in the autumn of\r\n1629; and to occupy it a new company of actors was organized, known as\r\n\"The King's Revels.\" The chief members of this company were George\r\nStutville, John Young, William Cartwright, William Wilbraham, and\r\nChristopher Goad; Gunnell and Blagrove probably acted as managers. In\r\nthe books of the Lord Chamberlain we find a warrant for the payment of\r\n£30 to William Blagrove \"and the rest of his company\" for three plays\r\nacted by the Children of the Revels, at Whitehall, 1631.[632] The\r\nChildren continued at Salisbury Court until about December, 1631, when\r\nthey abandoned the playhouse in favor of the much larger Fortune,\r\nsurrendered by the Palsgrave's Men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: See Mrs. Stopes's extracts from the Lord Chamberlain's\r\nbooks, in the Shakespeare _Jahrbuch_ (1910), XLVI, 97. This entry\r\nprobably led Cunningham to say (_The Shakespeare Society's Papers_,\r\nIV, 92) that Blagrove was \"Master of the Children of the Revels in the\r\nreign of Charles I.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Palsgrave's Men, who for many years had occupied the Fortune, seem\r\nto have fallen on bad times and to have disbanded. They were\r\nreorganized, however, possibly by their old manager, Richard Gunnell,\r\nand established in Salisbury Court. The Earl of Dorset, who took a\r\nspecial interest in Salisbury Court, obtained for the troupe a patent\r\nto play under the name of the infant Prince Charles, then little more\r\nthan a year old.[633] The patent bears the date of December 7, 1631;\r\nand \"The Servants of the High and Mighty Prince Charles\" opened at\r\nSalisbury Court very soon after[634] with a play by Marmion entitled\r\n_Holland's Leaguer_. The Prologue refers to the going of the King's\r\nRevels to the Fortune, and the coming of the new troupe to Salisbury\r\nCourt:\r\n\r\n     Gentle spectators, that with graceful eye\r\n     Come to behold the Muses' colony\r\n     New planted in this soil, forsook of late\r\n     By the inhabitants, since made _Fortunate_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: For Dorset's interest in the matter see Cunningham,\r\n_The Shakespeare Society's Papers_, IV, 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: In December, 1631; see Malone, _Variorum_, III, 178.]\r\n\r\nThe Prologue closes thus:\r\n\r\n     That on our branches now new poets sing;\r\n     And when with joy he shall see this resort\r\n     Phoebus shall not disdain to styl't his _Court_.\r\n\r\nBut the audiences at Salisbury Court were not large. For six\r\nperformances of the play, says Malone, Sir Henry Herbert received\r\n\"but one pound nineteen shillings, in virtue of the ninth share which\r\nhe possessed as one of the proprietors of the house.\"[635]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 178.]\r\n\r\nOf the \"new poets\" referred to by the Prologue, one, of course, was\r\nMarmion himself. Another, I venture to say, was James Shirley, who, as\r\nI think, had been engaged to write the company's second play. This was\r\n_The Changes_, brought out at Salisbury Court on January 10. The\r\nPrologue is full of allusions to the company, its recent misfortunes,\r\nand its present attempt to establish itself in its new quarters:\r\n\r\n     That Muse, whose song within another sphere[636]\r\n     Hath pleased some, and of the best, whose ear\r\n     Is able to distinguish strains that are\r\n     Clear and Phoebean from the popular\r\n     And sinful dregs of the adulterate brain,\r\n     By me salutes your candour once again;\r\n     And begs this noble favour, that this place,\r\n     And weak performances, may not disgrace\r\n     His fresh Thalia.[637] 'Las, our poet knows\r\n     We have no name; a torrent overflows\r\n     Our little island;[638] miserable we\r\n     Do every day play our own Tragedy.\r\n     But 't is more noble to create than kill,\r\n     He says; and if but with his flame, your will\r\n     Would join, we may obtain some warmth, and prove\r\n     Next them that now do surfeit with your love.\r\n     Encourage our beginning. Nothing grew\r\n     Famous at first. And, gentlemen, if you\r\n     Smile on this barren mountain, soon it will\r\n     Become both fruitful and the Muses hill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: The Cockpit, for which Shirley had been writing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 637: Cf. \"new poets\" of Marmion's Prologue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: An allusion to the smallness of the Salisbury Court\r\nPlayhouse?]\r\n\r\nThe similarity of this to the Prologue of _Holland's Leaguer_ is\r\nstriking; and the Epilogue is written in the same vein:\r\n\r\n                                   Opinion\r\n     Comes hither but on crutches yet; the sun\r\n     Hath lent no beam to warm us. If this play\r\n     Proceed more fortunate, we shall bless the day\r\n     And love that brought you hither. 'T is in you\r\n     To make a little sprig of laurel grow,\r\n     And spread into a grove.\r\n\r\nAll scholars who have written on the subject--Collier, Fleay, Greg,\r\nMurray, etc.--have contended that the King's Revels Company did not\r\nleave Salisbury Court until after January 10, 1632, because Herbert\r\nlicensed Shirley's _The Changes_ on that date,[639] and the title-page\r\nof the only edition of _The Changes_ states that it was acted at\r\nSalisbury Court by His Majesty's Revels. But Herbert records payments\r\nfor six representations of Marmion's _Leaguer_ by Prince Charles's Men\r\nat Salisbury Court \"in December, 1631.\"[640] This latter date must be\r\ncorrect, for on January 26 _Holland's Leaguer_ was entered on the\r\nStationers' Register \"as it hath been lately and often acted with\r\ngreat applause ... at the private house in Salisbury Court.\"\r\nAccording to the generally accepted theory, however, the King's Men\r\nwere still at Salisbury Court, and actually bringing out a new play\r\nthere so late as January 10. This error has led to much confusion, and\r\nto no little difficulty for historians of the stage; for example, Mr.\r\nMurray is forced to suppose that two royal patents were granted to\r\nPrince Charles's Company.[641] It seems to me likely that the\r\ntitle-page of _The Changes_ is incorrect in stating that the play was\r\nacted by the King's Revels. The play must have been acted by the new\r\nand as yet unpopular Prince Charles's Men, who had occupied Salisbury\r\nCourt as early as December, and, as Herbert tells us, with poor\r\nsuccess. The various dates cited clearly indicate this; and the\r\nPrologue and the Epilogue are both wholly unsuited for utterance by\r\nthe successful Revels Company which had just been \"made Fortunate,\"\r\nbut are quite in keeping with the condition of the newly organized and\r\nstruggling Prince Charles's Men, who might naturally ask the public to\r\n\"encourage our beginning.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 639: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 232. But Malone was a careless\r\ntranscriber, and Herbert himself sometimes made errors. Possibly the\r\ncorrect date is January 10, 1631.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 640: _Ibid._, III, 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 641: _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 221.]\r\n\r\nWhether Prince Charles's Men ultimately succeeded in winning the favor\r\nof the public we do not know. Presumably they did, for at some date\r\nbefore 1635 they moved to the large Red Bull Playhouse. Richard Heton\r\nwrote: \"And whereas my Lord of Dorset had gotten for a former company\r\nat Salisbury Court the Prince's service, they, being left at liberty,\r\ntook their opportunity of another house, and left the house in\r\nSalisbury Court destitute both of a service and company.\"[642]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 642: Richard Heton, \"Instructions for my Pattent,\" _The\r\nShakespeare Society's Papers_, IV, 96.]\r\n\r\nThis person, Richard Heton, who describes himself as \"one of the\r\nSewers of Her Majesty's Chamber Extraordinary,\" had now obtained\r\ncontrol of Salisbury Court, and had become manager of its\r\naffairs.[643] He apparently induced the Company of His Majesty's\r\nRevels to leave the Fortune and return to Salisbury Court, for in 1635\r\nthey acted there Richard Brome's _The Sparagus Garden_. But their\r\ncareer at Salisbury Court was short; on May 12 of the following year\r\nall playhouses were closed by the plague, and acting was not allowed\r\nagain for nearly a year and a half. During this long period of\r\ninactivity, the Company of His Majesty's Revels was largely dispersed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: We find a payment to Richard Heton, \"for himself and\r\nthe rest of the company of the players at Salisbury Court,\" for\r\nperforming a play before his Majesty at Court, October, 1635.\r\n(Chalmers's _Apology_, p. 509.) Exactly when he took charge of\r\nSalisbury Court I am unable to learn.]\r\n\r\nWhen at last, on October 2, 1637, the playhouses were allowed to open,\r\nHeton found himself with a crippled troupe of actors. Again the Earl\r\nof Dorset interested himself in the theatre. Queen Henrietta's\r\nCompany, which had been at the Cockpit since 1625, having \"disperst\r\nthemselves,\" Dorset took \"care to make up a new company for the\r\nQueen\";[644] and he placed this new company under Heton at Salisbury\r\nCourt. Heton writes: \"How much I have done for the upbuilding of this\r\nCompany, I gave you some particulars of in a petition to my Lord of\r\nDorset.\" This reorganization of the Queen's Men explains, perhaps, the\r\npuzzling entry in Herbert's Office-Book, October 2, 1637: \"I disposed\r\nof Perkins, Sumner, Sherlock, and Turner, to Salisbury Court, and\r\njoyned them with the best of that company.\"[645] Doubtless Herbert,\r\nlike Dorset, was anxious for the Queen to have a good troupe of\r\nplayers. This new organization of the Queen's Men continued at\r\nSalisbury Court without interruption, it seems, until the closing of\r\nthe playhouses in 1642.[646]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: Cunningham, _The Shakespeare Society's Papers_, IV,\r\n96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 645: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 646: For certain troubles at Salisbury Court in 1644 and\r\n1648, see Collier, _The History of English Dramatic Poetry_ (1879),\r\nII, 37, 40, 47.]\r\n\r\nIn 1649 John Herne, son of the John Herne who in 1629 had secured a\r\nlease on the property for sixty-one years, made out a deed of sale of\r\nthe playhouse to William Beeston,[647] for the sum of £600. But the\r\ndocument was not signed. The reason for this is probably revealed in\r\nthe following passage: \"The playhouse in Salisbury Court, in Fleet\r\nStreet, was pulled down[648] by a company of soldiers set on by the\r\nsectaries of these sad times, on Saturday, the 24 day of March,\r\n1649.\"[649]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 647: William Beeston was the son of the famous actor\r\nChristopher Beeston, who was once a member of the Lord Chamberlain's\r\nMen, later manager of the Fortune, and finally proprietor of the\r\nCockpit. In 1639 William had been appointed manager of the Cockpit\r\nCompany. (See pages 358 ff.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 648: That is, stripped of its benches, stage-hangings, and\r\nother appliances for dramatic performances.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 649: The manuscript entry in Stow's _Annals_. See _The\r\nAcademy_, October 28, 1882, p. 314. On the same date the soldiers\r\n\"pulled down on the inside\" also the Phoenix and the Fortune.]\r\n\r\nThree years later, however, Beeston, through his agent Theophilus\r\nBird, secured the property from Herne at the reduced price of £408:\r\n\"John Herne, by indenture dated the five and twentieth day of May,\r\n1652, for £408, to him paid by Theophilus Bird, did assign the\r\npremises and all his estate therein in trust for the said William\r\nBeeston.\"[650]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 650: Cunningham, _The Shakespeare Society's Papers_, IV,\r\n103.]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1660 Beeston, anticipating the return of King Charles, and\r\nthe reëstablishment of the drama, decided to put his building back\r\ninto condition to serve as a playhouse; and he secured from Herbert,\r\nthe Master of the Revels, a license to do so.[651] On April 5, 1660,\r\nhe contracted with two carpenters, Fisher and Silver, \"for the\r\nrebuilding the premises\"; and to secure them he mortgaged the\r\nproperty. The carpenters later swore that they \"expended in the same\r\nwork £329 9_s._ 4_d._\"[652]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 651: Printed in Malone, _Variorum_, III, 243, and\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, _A Collection of Ancient Documents_, p. 85. The\r\nlanguage clearly indicates that Beeston was to _reconvert_ the\r\nbuilding into a theatre.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 652: Cunningham, _The Shakespeare Society's Papers_, IV,\r\n103.]\r\n\r\nThe reconstructed playhouse was opened in 1660, probably as early as\r\nJune, with a performance of _The Rump_, by Tatham. It was engaged by\r\nSir William Davenant for his company of actors until his \"new theatre\r\nwith scenes\" could be erected in Lincoln's Inn Fields.[653] The\r\nubiquitous Pepys often went thither, and in his _Diary_ gives us some\r\ninteresting accounts of the performances he saw there. On March 2,\r\n1661, he witnessed a revival of Thomas Heywood's _Love's Mistress, or\r\nThe Queen's Masque_ before a large audience:\r\n\r\n     After dinner I went to the Theatre [i.e., Killigrew's\r\n     playhouse] where I found so few people (which is strange,\r\n     and the reason I did not know) that I went out again; and so\r\n     to Salisbury Court, where the house as full as could be; and\r\n     it seems it was a new play, _The Queen's Masque_, wherein\r\n     are some good humours: among others a good jeer to the old\r\n     story of the Siege of Troy, making it to be a common country\r\n     tale. But above all it was strange to see so little a boy as\r\n     that was to act Cupid, which is one of the greatest parts in\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 257; Halliwell-Phillipps, _A\r\nCollection of Ancient Documents_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nAgain, on March 26, he found Salisbury Court crowded:\r\n\r\n     After dinner Mrs. Pierce and her husband, and I and my wife,\r\n     to Salisbury Court, where coming late, he and she light of\r\n     Col. Boone, that made room for them; and I and my wife sat\r\n     in the pit, and there met with Mr. Lewes and Tom Whitton,\r\n     and saw _The_ _Bondman_[654] done to admiration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: By Philip Massinger.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the playhouse during these years falls outside the\r\nscope of this volume. Suffice it to say that before Beeston finished\r\npaying the carpenters for their work of reconstruction, the great fire\r\nof 1666 swept the building out of existence; as Fisher and Silver\r\ndeclared: \"The mortgaged premises by the late dreadful fire in London\r\nwere totally burned down and consumed.\"[655]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: The subsequent history of Salisbury Court is traced in\r\nthe legal documents printed by Cunningham. Beeston lost the property,\r\nand Fisher and Silver erected nearer the river a handsome new\r\nplayhouse, known as \"The Duke's Theatre,\" at an estimated cost of\r\n£1000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE COCKPIT-IN-COURT, OR THEATRE ROYAL AT WHITEHALL\r\n\r\n\r\nOn birthdays, holidays, and festive occasions in general the\r\nsovereigns of England and the members of the royal family were wont to\r\nsummon the professional actors to present plays at Court. For the\r\naccommodation of the players and of the audience, the larger halls at\r\nHampton, Windsor, Greenwich, St. James, Whitehall, or wherever the\r\nsovereign happened to be at the time, were specially fitted up, often\r\nat great expense. At one end of the hall was erected a temporary stage\r\nequipped with a \"music-room,\" \"players' houses of canvas,\" painted\r\nproperties, and such other things as were necessary to the actors. In\r\nthe centre of the hall, on an elevated dais, were provided seats for\r\nthe royal family, and around and behind the dais, stools for the more\r\ndistinguished guests; a large part of the audience was allowed to\r\nstand on platforms raised in tiers at the rear of the room. Since the\r\nplays were almost invariably given at night, the stage was illuminated\r\nby special \"branches\" hung on wires overhead, and carrying many\r\nlights. In the accounts of the Office of the Revels one may find\r\ninteresting records of plays presented in this manner, with the\r\nmiscellaneous items of expense for making the halls ready.\r\n\r\nUsually the Court performances, like the masques, were important,\r\nalmost official occasions, and many guests, including the members of\r\nthe diplomatic corps, were invited. To provide accommodation for so\r\nnumerous an audience, a large room was needed. Hampton Court possessed\r\na splendid room for the purpose in the Great Banqueting Hall, one\r\nhundred and six feet in length and forty feet in breadth. But the\r\npalace at Whitehall for many years had no room of a similar character.\r\nFor the performance of a masque there in 1559 the Queen erected a\r\ntemporary \"Banqueting House.\" Again, in 1572, to entertain the Duke of\r\nMontmorency, Ambassador from France, she had a large \"Banketting House\r\nmade at Whitehall,\" covered with canvas and decorated with ivy and\r\nflowers gathered fresh from the fields. An account of the structure\r\nmay be found in the records of the Office of the Revels. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, the most elaborate and substantial of these \"banqueting\r\nhouses\" was that erected in 1581, to entertain the ambassadors from\r\nFrance who came to treat of a marriage between Elizabeth and the Duc\r\nd'Anjou. The structure is thus described by Holinshed in his\r\n_Chronicle_:[656]\r\n\r\n     This year (against the coming of certain commissioners out\r\n     of France into England), by Her Majesty's appointment, on\r\n     the sixth and twentieth day of March, in the morning (being\r\n     Easter Day), a Banqueting House was begun at Westminster, on\r\n     the south-west side of Her Majesty's palace of Whitehall,\r\n     made in manner and form of a long square, three hundred\r\n     thirty and two foot in measure about; thirty principals made\r\n     of great masts, being forty foot in length apiece, standing\r\n     upright; between every one of these masts ten foot asunder\r\n     and more. The walls of this house were closed with canvas,\r\n     and painted all the outsides of the same most artificially,\r\n     with a work called rustic, much like stone. This house had\r\n     two hundred ninety and two lights of glass. The sides within\r\n     the same house was made with ten heights of degrees for\r\n     people to stand upon; and in the top of this house was\r\n     wrought most cunningly upon canvas works of ivy and holly,\r\n     with pendants made of wicker rods, garnished with bay, rue,\r\n     and all manner of strange flowers garnished with spangles of\r\n     gold; as also beautified with hanging toseans made of holly\r\n     and ivy, with all manner of strange fruits, as pomegranates,\r\n     oranges, pompions, cucumbers, grapes, carrots, with such\r\n     other like, spangled with gold, and most richly hanged.\r\n     Betwixt these works of bays and ivy were great spaces of\r\n     canvas, which was most cunningly painted, the clouds with\r\n     stars, the sun and sun-beams, with diverse other coats of\r\n     sundry sorts belonging to the Queen's Majesty, most richly\r\n     garnished with gold. There were of all manner of persons\r\n     working on this house to the number of three hundred seventy\r\n     and five: two men had mischances, the one broke his leg, and\r\n     so did the other. This house was made in three weeks and\r\n     three days, and was ended the eighteenth day of April, and\r\n     cost one thousand seven hundred forty and four pounds,\r\n     nineteen shillings, and od mony, as I was credibly informed\r\n     by the worshipful master Thomas Grave, surveyor unto Her\r\n     Majesty's works, who served and gave order for the same.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: Edition of 1808, IV, 434. See also Stow's _Chronicle_,\r\nunder the year 1581.]\r\n\r\nAlthough built in such a short time, and of such flimsy material, this\r\nexpensive Banqueting House seems to have been allowed to stand, and to\r\nhave been used thereafter for masques and plays. Thus, when King James\r\ncame to the throne, he ordered plays to be given there in November,\r\n1604. We find the following entry in the Treasurer's accounts:\r\n\r\n     For making ready the Banqueting House at Whitehall for the\r\n     King's Majesty against the plays, by the space of four days\r\n     ... 78_s._ 7_d._\r\n\r\nAnd the accounts of the Revels' Office inform us:\r\n\r\n     Hallomas Day, being the first of November, a play in the\r\n     Banqueting House at Whitehall, called _The Moor of Venice_.\r\n\r\nApparently, however, the King was not pleased with the Banqueting\r\nHouse as a place for dramatic performances, for he promptly ordered\r\nthe Great Hall of the palace--a room approximately ninety feet in\r\nlength and forty feet in breadth[657]--to be made ready for the next\r\nplay:\r\n\r\n     For making ready the Great Chamber at Whitehall for the\r\n     King's Majesty to see the play, by the space of two days ...\r\n     39_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: This had once already, on Shrove Tuesday, 1604, been\r\nused for a play. The situation and ground-plan of the \"Great Hall\" are\r\nclearly shown in Fisher's _Survey_ of the palace, made about 1670, and\r\nengraved by Vertue, 1747.]\r\n\r\nThe work was completed with dispatch, for on the Sunday following the\r\nperformance of _Othello_ in the Banqueting House, _The Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor_ was acted in the Great Hall. The next play to be given at\r\nCourt was also presented in the same room:\r\n\r\n     On St. Stephen's Night, in the Hall, a play called _Measure\r\n     for Measure_.\r\n\r\nAnd from this time on the Great Hall was the usual place for Court\r\nperformances. The abandonment of the Banqueting House was probably due\r\nto the facts that the Hall was smaller in size, could be more easily\r\nheated in the winter, and was in general better adapted to dramatic\r\nperformances. Possibly the change was due also to the decayed\r\ncondition of the old structure and to preparations for its removal.\r\nStow, in his _Annals_ under the date of 1607, writes:\r\n\r\n     The last year the King pulled down the old, rotten,\r\n     slight-builded Banqueting House at Whitehall, and\r\n     new-builded the same this year very strong and stately,\r\n     being every way larger than the first.[658]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: Stow's _Annals_, continued by Edmund Howes (1631), p.\r\n891.]\r\n\r\nThis new Banqueting House was completed in the early part of 1608.\r\nJohn Chamberlain writes to Sir Dudley Carleton on January 5, 1608:\r\n\"The masque goes forward at Court for Twelfth Day, tho' I doubt the\r\nNew Room will be scant ready.\"[659] Thereafter the Banqueting House,\r\n\"every way larger than the first,\" was regularly used for the\r\npresentation of masques. But it was rarely if ever used for plays.\r\nThroughout the reign of James, the ordinary place for dramatic\r\nperformances, as has been observed, was the Great Hall.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: John Nichols, _The Progresses of James_, II, 162.]\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1619, as a result of negligence during the preparations\r\nfor a masque, the Banqueting House caught fire and was burned to the\r\nground. The Reverend Thomas Lorkin writes to Sir Thomas Puckering on\r\nJanuary 19, 1619:\r\n\r\n     The unhappy accident that chanced at Whitehall last week by\r\n     fire you cannot but have heard of; but haply not the manner\r\n     how, which was this. A joiner was appointed to mend some\r\n     things that were out of order in the device of the masque,\r\n     which the King meant to have repeated at Shrovetide, who,\r\n     having kindled a fire upon a false hearth to heat his\r\n     glue-pot, the force thereof pierced soon, it seems, the\r\n     single brick, and in a short time that he absented himself\r\n     upon some occasion, fastened upon the basis, which was of\r\n     dry deal board, underneath; which suddenly conceiving flame,\r\n     gave fire to the device of the masque, all of oiled paper,\r\n     and dry fir, etc. And so, in a moment, disposed itself among\r\n     the rest of that combustible matter that it was past any\r\n     man's approach before it was almost discovered. Two hours\r\n     begun and ended that woful sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COCKPIT\r\n\r\nProbably as built by Henry VIII. (From Faithorne's _Map of London_,\r\n1658. The Whitehall district is represented as it was many years\r\nearlier, compare Agas's _Map_, 1560).]\r\n\r\nInigo Jones, who had dreamed of a magnificent palace at Whitehall, and\r\nwho had drawn elaborate plans for a royal residence which should\r\nsurpass anything in Europe, now took charge of building a new\r\nBanqueting House as a first step in the realization of his scheme.\r\nThe noble structure which he erected is to-day one of his chief\r\nmonuments, and the sole relic of the once famous royal palace. It was\r\ncompleted in the spring of 1622; but, as in the case of its\r\npredecessor, it was not commonly used for dramatic entertainments.\r\nThough masques might be given there, the regular place for plays\r\ncontinued to be the Great Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, however, there had been developed at Court the\r\ncustom of having small private performances in the Cockpit, in\r\naddition to the more elaborate performances in the Great Hall. Since\r\nthis ultimately led to the establishment of a theatre royal, known as\r\n\"The Cockpit-in-Court,\" it will be necessary to trace in some detail\r\nthe history of that structure.\r\n\r\nThe palace of Whitehall, anciently called York House, and the home of\r\nthirty successive Archbishops of York, was seized by King Henry VIII\r\nat the fall of Wolsey and converted into a royal residence.[660] The\r\nnew proprietor at once made improvements after his own taste, among\r\nwhich were tennis-courts, bowling-alleys, and an amphitheatre for the\r\n\"royal sport\" of cock-fighting. In Stow's description of the palace we\r\nread:\r\n\r\n     On the right hand be diverse fair tennis courts, bowling\r\n     alleys, and a Cockpit, all built by King Henry the Eight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: Shakespeare writes (_Henry VIII_, IV, i, 94-97):\r\n\r\n                          Sir you\r\n     Must no more call it York-place, that is past;\r\n     For since the Cardinal fell, that title's lost:\r\n     'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.]\r\n\r\nStrype, in his edition of Stow's _Survey_ (1720), adds the information\r\nthat the Cockpit was made \"out of certain old tenements.\"[661] It is\r\npictured in Agas's _Map of London_ (1570), and more clearly in\r\nFaithorne's _Map_ (see page 390), printed in 1658, but apparently\r\nrepresenting the city at an earlier date.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 661: Book VI, page 6.]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth the Cockpit, so far as I can ascertain,\r\nwas never used for plays. In the voluminous documents relating to the\r\nOffice of the Revels there is only one reference to the building: in\r\n1572 flowers were temporarily stored there that were to be used for\r\ndecking the \"Banketting House.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of King James that the Cockpit began to be\r\nused for dramatic representations. John Chamberlain writes from London\r\nto Sir Ralph Winwood, December 18, 1604: \"Here is great provision for\r\nCockpit to entertain him [the King] at home, and of masques and revels\r\nagainst the marriage of Sir Herbert and Lady Susan Vere.\"[662] Since,\r\nhowever, King James was very fond of cock-fighting, it may be that\r\nChamberlain was referring to that royal entertainment rather than to\r\nplays. The small Cockpit was certainly a very unusual place for the\r\nformal presentation of plays before His Majesty and the Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: _Winwood State Papers_ (1725), II, 41.]\r\n\r\nBut the young Prince Henry, whose official residence was in St.\r\nJames's Palace, often had private or semi-private performances of\r\nplays in the Cockpit. In the rolls of the expenses of the Prince we\r\nfind the following records:[663]\r\n\r\n     For making ready the Cockpit four several times for plays,\r\n     by the space of four days, in the month of December, 1610,\r\n     £2 10_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n     For making ready the Cockpit for plays two several times, by\r\n     the space of four days, in the months of January and\r\n     February, 1611, 70_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n     For making ready the Cockpit for a play, by the space of two\r\n     days, in the month of December, 1611, 30_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: See Cunningham, _Extracts from the Accounts of the\r\nRevels_, pp. xiii-xiv.]\r\n\r\nThe building obviously, was devoted for the most part to other\r\npurposes, and had to be \"made ready\" for plays at a considerable\r\nexpense. Nor was the Prince the only one who took advantage of its\r\nsmall amphitheatre. John Chamberlain, in a letter to Sir Dudley\r\nCarleton on September 22, 1612, describing the reception accorded to\r\nthe Count Palatine by the Lady Elizabeth, writes: \"On Tuesday she sent\r\nto invite him as he sat at supper to a play of her own servants in the\r\nCockpit.\"[664]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: John Nichols, _The Progresses of James_, II, 466.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that at times throughout the reign of James\r\ndramatic performances were given in the Cockpit; but the auditorium\r\nwas small, and the performances must have been of a semi-private\r\nnature. The important Court performances, to which many guests were\r\ninvited, were held in the Great Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the next sovereign, however, a change came about. In\r\nthe year 1632 or 1633, as well as I am able to judge with the evidence\r\nat command, King Charles reconstructed the old Cockpit into a \"new\r\ntheatre at Whitehall,\" which from henceforth was almost exclusively\r\nused for Court performances. The opening of this \"new theatre royal\"\r\nis celebrated by a _Speech_ from the pen of Thomas Heywood:\r\n\r\n     _A Speech Spoken to Their Two Excellent Majesties at the\r\n     First Play Play'd by the Queen's Servants in the New Theatre\r\n     at Whitehall._\r\n\r\n     When Greece, the chief priority might claim\r\n     For arts and arms, and held the eminent name\r\n     Of Monarchy, they erected divers places,\r\n     Some to the Muses, others to the Graces,\r\n     Where actors strove, and poets did devise,\r\n     With tongue and pen to please the ears and eyes\r\n     Of Princely auditors. The time was, when\r\n     To hear the rapture of one poet's pen\r\n     A Theatre hath been built.\r\n\r\n     By the Fates' doom,\r\n     When th' Empire was removed from thence to Rome,\r\n     The Potent Cæsars had their _circi_, and\r\n     Large amphitheatres, in which might stand\r\n     And sit full fourscore thousand, all in view\r\n     And touch of voice. This great Augustus knew,\r\n     Nay Rome its wealth and potency enjoyed,\r\n     Till by the barbarous Goths these were destroy'd.\r\n\r\n     But may this structure last, and you be seen\r\n     Here a spectator, with your princely Queen,\r\n     In your old age, as in your flourishing prime,\r\n     To outstrip Augustus both in fame and time.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of this _Speech_ is not given, but it was printed[665]\r\nin 1637 along with \"The Prologue to the Famous Tragedy of _The Rich\r\nJew of Malta_, as it Was Played Before the King and Queen in His\r\nMajesty's Theatre at Whitehall\"; and this Prologue Heywood had already\r\npublished with the play itself in 1633. He dedicated the play to Mr.\r\nThomas Hammon, saying, \"I had no better a New-Year's gift to present\r\nyou with.\" Apparently, then, the play had been acted at Court shortly\r\nbefore New Year's, 1633; and this sets a forward date to Heywood's\r\n_Speech_. Other evidence combines with this to show that \"His\r\nMajesty's Theatre at Whitehall\" was \"new\" at the Christmas season of\r\n1632-33.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: See _The Dramatic Works of Thomas Heywood_ (1874), VI,\r\n339.]\r\n\r\nIn erecting this, the first \"theatre royal,\" King Charles would\r\nnaturally call for the aid of the great Court architect Inigo\r\nJones,[666] and by good luck we have preserved for us Jones's original\r\nsketches for the little playhouse (see page 396). These were\r\ndiscovered a few years ago by Mr. Hamilton Bell in the Library of\r\nWorcester College (where many valuable relics of the great architect\r\nare stored), and printed in _The Architectural Record_ of New York,\r\nMarch, 1913. Mr. Bell accompanied the plans with a valuable\r\ndiscussion, but he was unable to discover their purpose. He writes:\r\n\r\n     We have still no clue as to what purpose this curiously\r\n     anomalous and most interesting structure was to\r\n     serve--whether the plan was ever carried out, or whether it\r\n     remained part of a lordly pleasure-house which its prolific\r\n     designer planned for the delectation of his own soul.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: Whether he merely made over the old Cockpit which Henry\r\nVIII had constructed \"out of certain old tenements,\" or erected an\r\nentirely new building, I have not been able to ascertain. Heywood's\r\n_Speech_ indicates a \"new\" and \"lasting\" structure.]\r\n\r\nThat the plan actually was carried out, at least in part, is shown by\r\na sketch of the Whitehall buildings made by John Fisher at some date\r\nbefore 1670, and engraved by Vertue in 1747, (see page 398).[667]\r\nHere, in the northeast corner of the palace, we find a little theatre,\r\nlabeled \"The Cockpit.\" Its identity with the building sketched by\r\nInigo Jones is obvious at a glance; even the exterior measurements,\r\nwhich are ascertainable from the scales of feet given on the two\r\nplans, are the same.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: Vertue conservatively dates the survey \"about 1680\";\r\nbut the names of the occupants of the various parts of the palace show\r\nthat it was drawn before 1670, and nearer 1660 than 1680.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INIGO JONES'S PLANS FOR THE COCKPIT-IN-COURT\r\n\r\nNow preserved in the Worcester College Library at Oxford; discovered\r\nby Mr. Hamilton Bell, and reproduced in _The Architectural Record_, of\r\nNew York, 1913.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHER'S SURVEY OF WHITEHALL SHOWING THE\r\nCOCKPIT-IN-COURT\r\n\r\nA section from Vertue's engraving, 1747, of a survey of Whitehall made\r\nby John Fisher, 1660-1670. Compare \"The Cockpit\" with Inigo Jones's\r\nplans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THEATRO OLYMPICO AT VICENZA\r\n\r\nWhich probably inspired Inigo Jones's plans for the Cockpit-in-Court.]\r\n\r\nMr. Bell describes the plan he discovered as follows:[668]\r\n\r\n     It represents within a square building, windowed on three\r\n     sides and on one seemingly attached to another building, an\r\n     auditorium occupying five sides of an octagon, on the floor\r\n     of which are shown the benches of a pit, or the steps, five\r\n     in number, on which they could be set. These are curiously\r\n     arranged at an angle of forty-five degrees on either side of\r\n     a central aisle, so that the spectators occupying them\r\n     could never have directly faced the stage. Surrounding this\r\n     pit on five sides is a balcony ten feet deep, with, it would\r\n     seem, two rows of benches on four of its sides; the fifth\r\n     side in the centre, directly opposite the stage, being\r\n     partitioned off into a room or box, in the middle of which\r\n     is indicated a platform about five feet by seven, presumably\r\n     for the Royal State. Three steps descend from this box to\r\n     the centre aisle of the pit. To the left of and behind this\r\n     royal box appears another enclosure or box, partitioned off\r\n     from the rest of the balcony.\r\n\r\n     The staircases of access to this auditorium are clearly\r\n     indicated; one small door at the rear of the _salle_ with\r\n     its own private stairway, communicating with the adjoining\r\n     building, opens directly into the royal box; as in the Royal\r\n     Opera House in Berlin to-day.\r\n\r\n     There is another door, with a triangular lobby, into the\r\n     rear of the left-hand balcony. Two windows are shown on each\r\n     side of the house, opening directly into the theatre from\r\n     the outer air.\r\n\r\n     The stage runs clear across the width of the pit, about\r\n     thirty-five feet, projecting in an \"apron\" or _avant scène_\r\n     five feet beyond the proscenium wall, and is surrounded on\r\n     the three outward sides by a low railing of classic design\r\n     about eighteen inches in height, just as in many Elizabethan\r\n     playhouses.\r\n\r\n     If one may trust an elevation of the stage, drawn on the\r\n     same sheet to twice the scale of the general plan, the stage\r\n     was four feet six inches above the floor of the pit. This\r\n     elevation exhibits the surprising feature of a classic\r\n     façade, Palladian in treatment, on the stage of what so far\r\n     we have regarded as a late modification of a playhouse of\r\n     Shakespeare's day. Evidently Inigo Jones contemplated the\r\n     erection of a permanent architectural _proscenium_, as the\r\n     ancients called it, of the type, though far more modest,\r\n     both in scale and ornamentation, of Palladio's Theatro\r\n     Olimpico at Vicenza, which we know he visited in about 1600,\r\n     some twenty years after its erection. This _proscenium_,\r\n     given in plan and elevation, shows a semi-circular structure\r\n     with a radius of fifteen feet, two stories in height, of the\r\n     Corinthian or Composite order. In the lower story are five\r\n     doorways, the centre of which is a large archway flanked by\r\n     pedestals, on which are inscribed in Greek characters,\r\n     Melpomene--Thalia; over these and over the smaller doors are\r\n     tablets.\r\n\r\n     The second story contains between its lighter engaged\r\n     columns, over the four side doors, niches with corbels\r\n     below, destined to carry statues as their inscribed bases\r\n     indicate. So far as these inscriptions are legible,--the\r\n     clearest reading \"phocles,\" probably Sophocles,--these were\r\n     to represent Greek dramatists, most likely Æschylus,\r\n     Euripides, Sophocles and Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n     The curved pediment of the central archway runs up into this\r\n     story and is broken in the middle by a tablet bearing the\r\n     inscription \"Prodesse et Delectare,\" which is flanked by two\r\n     reclining genii holding garlands.\r\n\r\n     Above these are two busts on brackets, Thespis and Epicurus,\r\n     or possibly Epicharmus. The space directly above this\r\n     pediment is occupied by a window-like opening five by four\r\n     feet, the traditional Elizabethan music-room, in all\r\n     probability, which, Mr. W.J. Lawrence has shown us, occupied\r\n     this position both in Shakespeare's day and for some time\r\n     after the Restoration; an arrangement which was revived by\r\n     Mr. Steele Mackaye in the Madison Square Theatre, and\r\n     originally in the first little Lyceum, New York, both now\r\n     pulled down. The pyramidal pediment above this opening\r\n     projects above the upper cornice into a coved ceiling, which\r\n     would appear from the rendering of the drawing to form an\r\n     apse above the semi-circular stage. Behind the _proscenium_\r\n     is a large space with staircases of approach, two windows at\r\n     the rear, and apparently a fireplace for the comfort of the\r\n     waiting players. Communication with the front of the house\r\n     is provided by a door in the proscenium wall opening into\r\n     the stage door lobby, whence the outside of the building may\r\n     be reached.\r\n\r\n     There is no indication of galleries, unless some marks on\r\n     the angles of the front wall of the balcony may be\r\n     interpreted without too much license into the footings of\r\n     piers or posts to carry one; the total interior height shown\r\n     in the elevation from what I have assumed to be the floor of\r\n     the pit to the ceiling being only twenty-eight feet, there\r\n     would hardly have been room for more than one. The only\r\n     staircases which could have served it are at the rear of the\r\n     building in the corners behind the stage wall....\r\n\r\n     The general dimensions would appear to be:\r\n\r\n     Total width of the auditorium                   58 ft.\r\n     Total width of the pit                          36 ft.\r\n     Total width of the front stage or \"apron\"       35 ft.\r\n     Total depth of the stage from the railing to\r\n       the centre of the _proscenium_                16 ft.\r\n         The entire building is 58 feet square inside, cut to\r\n         an octagon of 28 feet each side.\r\n     Height from floor to ceiling                    28 ft.\r\n     Height from stage to ceiling              about 23 ft. 6 in.\r\n     The lower order of the _proscenium_             10 ft. 6 in.\r\n     The upper order of the _proscenium_              9 ft. 6 in.\r\n\r\n     The scale on the drawing may not be absolutely correct, as\r\n     measured by it the side doors of the _proscenium_ are only\r\n     five feet high and two feet nine inches wide: this, however,\r\n     may be an error in the drawing, since we have it on very\r\n     good authority that Inigo Jones designed without the use of\r\n     a scale, proportioning his various members by his\r\n     exquisitely critical eye alone, subsequently adding the\r\n     dimensions in writing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 668: Reprinted here by the kind permission of Mr. Bell and\r\nthe editors of _The Architectural Record_.]\r\n\r\nI record below some of the references to the Cockpit which I have\r\ngathered from the Herbert Manuscript and the Office-Books of the Lord\r\nChamberlain. The earliest payment for plays there, it will be\r\nobserved, is dated March 16, 1633. Abundant evidence shows that the\r\nactors gave their performance in the Cockpit at night without\r\ninterfering with their regular afternoon performance at their\r\nplayhouses, and for their pains received the sum of £10. If, however,\r\nfor any reason they \"lost their day\" at their house they were paid\r\n£20.\r\n\r\n     1633. March 16.

The first and second part of _Arviragus and Philicia_\r\n     were acted at the Cockpit before the King and Queen, the\r\n     Prince, and Prince Elector, the 18 and 19 April, 1636, being\r\n     Monday and Tuesday in Easter week.[674]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 669: Lord Chamberlain's Office-Book, C.C.

One more will suffice--the most interesting of\r\nall, since it shows how frequently the little theatre was employed for\r\nthe entertainment of the royal family. It is a bill presented by the\r\nBlackfriars Company, the King's Men, for Court performances during the\r\nyear 1637. This bill was discovered and reproduced in facsimile by\r\nGeorge R. Wright, F.S.A., in _The Journal of the British\r\nArchæological Association_ for 1860; but it was wholly misunderstood\r\nby its discoverer, who regarded it as drawn up by the company of\r\nplayers that \"performed at the Cockpit in Drury Lane.\" He was indeed\r\nsomewhat puzzled by the reference to the Blackfriars Playhouse, but\r\nmet the difficulty by saying: \"There can be little doubt that the\r\nlast-named theatre was lent for the occasion to the Cockpit Company,\"\r\nalthough he suggests no reason for this strange borrowing of a theatre\r\nby a troupe that possessed a house of its own, and much nearer the\r\nCourt, too. It did not even occur to him, it seems, to inquire how the\r\nCockpit Company secured the plays which we know belonged to\r\nShakespeare's old company. Because of these obvious difficulties\r\nscholars have looked upon the document with suspicion, and apparently\r\nhave treated it as a forgery.[675] But that it is genuine is indicated\r\nby the history of \"The Cockpit-in-Court\" as sketched above, and is\r\nproved beyond any question by the fact that the Office-Book of the\r\nLord Chamberlain shows that the bill was paid:\r\n\r\n     12th March 1638 {9}.--Forasmuch as His Majesty's Servants,\r\n     the company at the Blackfriars, have by special command, at\r\n     divers times within the space of this present year 1638,\r\n     acted 24 plays before His Majesty, six whereof have been\r\n     performed at Hampton-court and Richmond, by means whereof\r\n     they were not only at the loss of their day at home, but at\r\n     extraordinary charges by traveling and carriage of their\r\n     goods, in consideration whereof they are to have £20 apiece\r\n     for those plays, and £10 apiece for the other 18 acted at\r\n     Whitehall, which in the whole amounted to the sum of\r\n     £300.--These are therefore to pray and require you out of\r\n     His Majesty's treasure in your charge to pay....[676]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 675: Fleay in his elaborate studies of performances at Court\r\nignores it entirely, as do subsequent scholars.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: Chalmers, _Apology_, p. 510.]\r\n\r\nA photographic facsimile of this interesting document may be seen in\r\n_The Journal of the British Archæological Association_, already\r\nreferred to; but for the convenience of those who do not read\r\nElizabethan script with ease, I have reproduced it in type facsimile\r\non page 404.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Transcriber's Note: The dashes below represent\r\nhandwritten check-marks in the facsimile.]\r\n\r\nbefore the king & queene this\r\nyeare of our lord 1638\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 26th of march               The lost ladie\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 27th of march               Damboyes\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 3d of Aprill                Aglaura\r\n\r\nAt the blackfryers the 23 of Aprill\r\nfor the queene                                the vnfortunate lou[ers]\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 29th of may\r\nthe princes berthnight                        ould Castel\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the last of may agayne the      vnfortunate louers\r\n\r\nAt Sumerset-house the 10th of July & our day\r\n\r\n-- lost at our house mr Carlels play the first part of the pasionate louers\r\n\r\n-- At Hamton Court the 30th of September      The vnfortunate louer[s]\r\n\r\n-- At Richmount the 6th of november for the ladie }  The mery divell\r\n   maries berthnight & the day lost at our house  }  of Edmonto[n]\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 8th of november             The fox\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 13th of november            Ceaser\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 15th of november            The mery wifes of winser\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 20th of november            The fayre favorett\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 22th of november            Chances\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 27th of november            The Costome of the C[ountry]\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 29th of november            The northen las\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 6th of desember             The spanish Curatt\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 11th of desember agayne     The fayre favorett\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 18th of desember m Carlels\r\nplay agayne the first part of                 The pasionate louers\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 20th of desember\r\nthe 2d part of                                The pasionate louers\r\n\r\nAt the Cocpit the 27 of desember the 2d part agayne of the pasionate louers\r\n\r\n-- At Richmount the 28 of desember the ladie        }\r\n   Elsabeths berthnight & our day lost at our house }  The northen las\r\n\r\n-- At Richmount on newyeares day }\r\n   and our day lost at our house }  beggers bush\r\n\r\n-- At Richmount the 7th of Janeuarye }\r\n   and our day lost at our house     }  The spanish Cura[tt]]\r\n\r\nThe check-marks at the left were probably made by the clerk in the\r\nChamberlain's office to ascertain how many times the players \"lost\r\ntheir day\" at their house, and hence were entitled to £20 in payment.\r\nFor the play given \"at the blackfriars the 23 of Aprill for the\r\nqueene\" (presumably the general public was excluded) only the usual\r\n£10 was allowed.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of the civil war, the Cockpit, like the public\r\ntheatres, suffered an eclipse. Sir Henry Herbert writes: \"On Twelfth\r\nNight, 1642, the Prince had a play called _The Scornful Lady_ at the\r\nCockpit; but the King and Queen were not there, and it was the only\r\nplay acted at court in the whole Christmas.\"[677] During the dark days\r\nthat followed we hear nothing of plays in the Cockpit. Later\r\nCromwell himself occupied this section of the palace, and naturally\r\nsaw to it that no dramatic exhibitions were held there. But at the\r\nRestoration \"the Prince,\" now become the King, could have his plays\r\nagain; and he did not wait long. On November 20, 1660, Edward Gower\r\nwrote to Sir Richard Leveson: \"Yesternight the King, Queen, Princess,\r\netc., supped at the Duke d'Albemarle's, where they had _The Silent\r\nWoman_ acted in the Cockpit.\"[678] From this time on the theatre royal\r\nwas in constant use for the entertainment of the Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677: Herbert MS., Malone, _Variorum_, III, 241.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: Historical Manuscripts Commission, Fifth Report, p.\r\n200. Pepys, under the date November 20, 1660, gives an anecdote about\r\nthe King's behavior on this occasion.]\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys, as he rose in the world, became a frequent visitor\r\nthere.[679] In the absence of other descriptions of the building, I\r\nsubjoin a few of the entries from his _Diary_. Under the date of\r\nOctober 2, 1662, he writes:\r\n\r\n     At night by coach towards Whitehall, took up Mr. Moore and\r\n     set him at my Lord's, and myself, hearing that there was a\r\n     play at the Cockpit (and my Lord Sandwich, who came to town\r\n     last night, at it), I do go thither, and by very great\r\n     fortune did follow four or five gentlemen who were carried\r\n     to a little private door in a wall, and so crept through a\r\n     narrow place and come into one of the boxes next the King's,\r\n     but so as I could not see the King or Queen, but many of the\r\n     fine ladies, who yet are really not so handsome generally\r\n     as I used to take them to be, but that they are finely\r\n     dressed. Here we saw _The Cardinal_,[680] a tragedy I had\r\n     never seen before, nor is there any great matter in it. The\r\n     company that came in with me into the box were all Frenchmen\r\n     that could speak no English, but Lord! what sport they made\r\n     to ask a pretty lady that they got among them that\r\n     understood both French and English to make her tell them\r\n     what the actors said.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: He first \"got in\" on April 20, 1661, \"by the favour of\r\none Mr. Bowman.\" John Evelyn also visited the Cockpit; see his\r\n_Diary_, January 16 and February 11, 1662.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: By James Shirley, licensed 1641.]\r\n\r\nThe next time he went to the Cockpit, on November 17, 1662, he did not\r\nhave to creep in by stealth. He writes:\r\n\r\n     At Whitehall by appointment, Mr. Crew carried my wife and I\r\n     to the Cockpit, and we had excellent places, and saw the\r\n     King, Queen, Duke of Monmouth, his son, and my Lady\r\n     Castlemaine, and all the fine ladies; and _The Scornful\r\n     Lady_, well performed. They had done by eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe fine ladies, as usual, made a deep impression on him, as did the\r\n\"greatness and gallantry\" of the audience. On December 1, 1662, he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     This done we broke up, and I to the Cockpit, with much\r\n     crowding and waiting, where I saw _The Valiant Cid_[681]\r\n     acted, a play I have read with great delight, but is a most\r\n     dull thing acted, which I never understood before, there\r\n     being no pleasure in it, though done by Betterton and by\r\n     Ianthe,[682] and another fine wench that is come in the room\r\n     of Roxalana; nor did the King or Queen once smile all the\r\n     whole play, nor any of the company seem to take any pleasure\r\n     but what was in the greatness and gallantry of the company.\r\n     Thence ... home, and got thither by 12 o'clock, knocked up\r\n     my boy, and put myself to bed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: By Corneille.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: Mrs. Betterton.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COCKPIT-IN-COURT\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving by Mazell in Pennant's _London_. Mr. W.L. Spiers,\r\nwho reproduces this engraving in the _London Topographical Record_\r\n(1903), says that it is \"undated, but probably copied from a\r\ncontemporary drawing of the seventeenth century.\"]\r\n\r\nTwo entries, from an entirely different source, must suffice for this\r\nhistory of the Cockpit. In the Paper-Office Chalmers discovered a\r\nrecord of the following payments, made in 1667:\r\n\r\n     To the Keeper of the theatre at Whitehall, £30. To the same\r\n     for Keeping clean that place, _p. ann._ £6.[683]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: Chalmers, _Apology_, p. 530. Cunningham says, in his\r\n_Handbook of London_: \"I find in the records of the Audit Office a\r\npayment of £30 per annum 'to the Keeper of our Playhouse called the\r\nCockpit in St. James Park'\"; but he does not state the year in which\r\nthe payment was made.]\r\n\r\nAnd in the Lord Chamberlain's Accounts is preserved the following\r\nwarrant:\r\n\r\n     1674, March 27. Warrant to deliver to Monsieur Grabu, or to\r\n     such as he shall appoint, such of the scenes remaining in\r\n     the theatre at Whitehall as shall be useful for the French\r\n     Opera at the theatre in Bridges Street, and the said\r\n     Monsieur to return them again safely after 14 days' time to\r\n     the theatre at Whitehall.[684]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 684: I quote from W.J. Lawrence, _The Elizabethan Playhouse_\r\n(First Series), p. 144.]\r\n\r\nWhat became of the theatre at Whitehall I have not been able to\r\nascertain.[685] Presumably, after the fire of January, 1698, which\r\ndestroyed the greater part of the palace and drove the royal family to\r\nseek quarters elsewhere, the building along with the rest of the\r\nCockpit section was made over into the Privy Council offices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: The reasons why the Cockpit at Whitehall has remained\r\nso long in obscurity (its history is here attempted for the first\r\ntime) are obvious. Some scholars have confused it with the public\r\nplayhouse of the same name, a confusion which persons in the days of\r\nCharles avoided by invariably saying \"The Cockpit in Drury Lane.\"\r\nOther scholars have confused it with the residential section of\r\nWhitehall which bore the same name. During the reign of James several\r\nlarge buildings which had been erected either on the site of the old\r\ncockpit of Henry VIII, or around it, were converted into lodgings for\r\nmembers of the royal family or favorites of the King, and were\r\ncommonly referred to as \"the Cockpit.\" Other scholars have assumed\r\nthat all plays during the reigns of Elizabeth, James, and Charles were\r\ngiven either in the Banqueting House or in the Great Hall. Finally,\r\nstill other scholars (e.g., Sir Sidney Lee, in _Shakespeare's\r\nEngland_, 1916) have confused the Cockpit at Whitehall with the Royal\r\nCockpit in St. James's Park. Exactly when the latter was built I have\r\nnot been able to discover, but it was probably erected near the close\r\nof the seventeenth century. It stood at the end of Dartmouth Street,\r\nadjacent to Birdcage Walk, but not in the Park itself. John Strype, in\r\nhis edition of Stow's _Survey_ (1720), bk. VI, p. 64, says of\r\nDartmouth Street: \"And here is a very fine Cockpit, called the King's\r\nCockpit, well resorted unto.\" A picture of the building is given by\r\nStrype on page 62, and a still better picture may be found in J.T.\r\nSmith's _The Antiquities of Westminster_. The Royal Cockpit in\r\nDartmouth Street survived until 1816, when it was torn down. Hogarth,\r\nin his famous representation of a cock-fight, shows its interior as\r\ncircular, and as embellished with the royal coat of arms. Another\r\ninteresting picture of the interior will be found in Ackermann's _The\r\nMicrocosm of London_ (1808). It is needless to add that this building\r\nhad nothing whatever to do with the theatre royal of the days of King\r\nCharles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWOLF'S THEATRE IN NIGHTINGALE LANE, NEAR EAST SMITHFIELD\r\n\r\nIn Jeaffreson's _Middlesex County Records_ (I, 260), we find the\r\nfollowing entry, dated April 1, 1600:\r\n\r\n     1 April, 42 Elizabeth.--Recognizance, taken before Sir John\r\n     Peyton knt., Lieutenant of the Tower of London, and Thomas\r\n     Fowler, Tobias Woode, Edward Vaghan and Henry Thoresby\r\n     esqs., Justices of the Peace, of John Wolf, of\r\n     Eastsmithfield, co. Midd., stationer, in the sum of forty\r\n     pounds; The condition of the recognizance being \"that,\r\n     whereas the above-bounden John Wolf hath begun to erect and\r\n     build a playhouse in Nightingale Lane near East Smithfield\r\n     aforesaid, contrary to Her Majesty's proclamation and orders\r\n     set down in Her Highness's Court of Starchamber. If\r\n     therefore the said John Wolf do not proceed any further in\r\n     building or erecting of the same playhouse, unless he shall\r\n     procure sufficient warrant from the Rt. Honourable the Lords\r\n     of Her Majesty's most honourable Privy Council for further\r\n     ... then this recognizance to be void, or else to remain in\r\n     full force.\"\r\n\r\nThe only stationer in London named John Wolf was the printer and\r\npublisher who at this time had his shop in Pope's Head Alley, Lombard\r\nStreet. For several reasons he is well known to bibliographers; and\r\nhis strong personality and tireless energy might easily have led him\r\ninto the field of the theatre. For many years he was a member of the\r\nFishmongers' Company, to which also, in all probability, his father\r\nhad belonged. After a ten years' apprenticeship with the eminent\r\nprinter, John Day, he spent several years abroad \"gadding from country\r\nto country,\" but learning the printing trade from the best\r\nestablishments on the Continent. His longest stay was in Italy, where\r\nhe was connected with the printing-office of the Giunti, and also, it\r\nseems, of Gabriel Giolito. In 1576 he printed two _Rappresentazioni_,\r\n\"ad instanzia di Giovanni Vuolfio, Inglese.\" About the year 1579 he\r\nestablished himself in London (where he was dubbed by his fellows\r\n\"Machiavel\"), and began an energetic warfare on the monopolies secured\r\nby certain favored printers. The fact that he was for a time\r\n\"committed to the Clink\" failed to deter him. We are told that he\r\n\"affirmed openly in the Stationers' Hall that it was lawful for all\r\nmen to print all lawful books, what commandment soever Her Majesty\r\ngave to the contrary.\" And being \"admonished that he, being but one,\r\nso mean a man, should not presume to contrary Her Highness'\r\ngovernment: 'Tush,' said he, 'Luther was but one man, and reformed all\r\nthe world for religion, and I am _that one man_ that must and will\r\nreform the government in this trade.'\" The courage and energy here\r\nrevealed characterized his entire life. In 1583 he was admitted a\r\nfreeman of the Company of Stationers. In 1593 he was elected Printer\r\nto the City. In the spring of 1600 he was in serious difficulties with\r\nthe authorities over the printing of John Hayward's _Life and Raigne\r\nof King Henrie IV_, and was forced to spend two weeks in jail. He died\r\nin 1601.[686]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 686: For the life of John Wolf see the following: Edward\r\nArber, _A Transcript of the Stationers' Registers_, especially II,\r\n779-93; _The Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1598-1601_, pp. 405,\r\n449, 450; A.

Whereas at the humble suit of our servants John\r\n     Cotton, John Williams, and Thomas Dixon, and in recompence\r\n     of their services, we have been pleased to license them to\r\n     build an Amphitheatre, which hath passed our Signet and is\r\n     stayed at our Privy Seal; and finding therein contained some\r\n     such words and clauses, as may, in some constructions, seem\r\n     to give them greater liberty both in point of building and\r\n     using of exercises than is any way to be permitted, or was\r\n     ever by us intended, we have thought fit to command and give\r\n     authority unto you, or any four of you, to cause that\r\n     already passed to be cancelled, and to give order unto our\r\n     Solicitor General for the drawing up of a new warrant for\r\n     our signature to the same parties, according to such\r\n     directions and reservations as herewith we send you. Wherein\r\n     we are more particular, both in the affirmative and the\r\n     negative, to the end that, as on one side we would have\r\n     nothing pass us to remain upon record which either for the\r\n     form might not become us or for the substance might cross\r\n     our many proclamations (pursued with good success) for\r\n     buildings, or, on the other side, might give them cause to\r\n     importune us after they had been at charges; to which end we\r\n     wish that you call them before you and let them know our\r\n     pleasure and resolution therein.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: See _State Papers, Domestic, 1619-1623_, p. 181. I have\r\nquoted the letter from Collier, _The History of English Dramatic\r\nPoetry_ (1879), I, 408.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly the license was canceled, and no new license was issued.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, however, John Williams and Thomas Dixon (what had become of\r\nJohn Cotton we do not know) made an attempt to secure a license from\r\nKing Charles, then newly come to the throne, to erect an amphitheatre\r\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields. Apparently they so worded the proposed grant\r\nas to authorize them to present in their amphitheatre not only\r\nspectacles, but dramatic performances and animal-baitings as well,\r\nwith the power to restrain all other places of amusement for one day\r\nin each week, on giving two days' warning.\r\n\r\nA \"bill\" to this effect was drawn up and submitted to Thomas Coventry,\r\nthe Lord Keeper, who examined it hastily, and dispatched it to Lord\r\nConway with the following letter:[690]\r\n\r\n     _My very good Lord_,--I have perused this Bill, and do call\r\n     to mind that about three or four years past when I was\r\n     Attorney General, a patent for an Amphitheatre was in hand\r\n     to have passed; but upon this sudden, without search of my\r\n     papers, I cannot give your lordship any account of the true\r\n     cause wherefore it did not pass, nor whether that and this\r\n     do vary in substance: neither am I apt upon a sudden to take\r\n     impertinent exceptions to anything that is to pass, much\r\n     less to a thing that is recommended by so good a friend. But\r\n     if upon perusal of my papers which I had while I was\r\n     Attorney, or upon more serious thoughts, I shall observe\r\n     anything worthy to be represented to His Majesty, or to the\r\n     Council, I shall then acquaint your lordship; and in the\r\n     meantime I would be loath to be the author of a motion to\r\n     His Majesty to stay it: but if you find His Majesty at\r\n     fitting leisure, to move him that he will give leave to\r\n     think of it in this sort as I have written, it may do well;\r\n     and I assure your lordship, unless I find matter of more\r\n     consequence than I observe on this sudden, it is not like to\r\n     be stayed. And so I rest your lordship's very assured to do\r\n     you service,\r\n\r\n     THO.

But the scheme soon evoked the bitter opposition of the various\r\ntroupes of players, and of the owners of the various theatres and\r\nother places of amusement. An echo of the quarrel is found in\r\nMarmion's _Holland's Leaguer_, II, iii:\r\n\r\n     Twill dead all my device in making matches,\r\n     My plots of architecture, and erecting\r\n     New amphitheatres to draw custom\r\n     From playhouses once a week, and so pull\r\n     A curse upon my head from the poor scoundrels.[691]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: _The Dramatic Works of Shackerley Marmion_, in\r\n_Dramatists of the Restoration_, p. 37. Fleay (_A Biographical\r\nChronicle of the English Drama_, II, 66) suggests that the impostors\r\nAgurtes and Autolichus are meant to satirize Williams and Dixon\r\nrespectively.]\r\n\r\nThe \"poor scoundrels\"--i.e., the players--seem to have caused the\r\nauthorities to examine the bill more closely; and on September 28,\r\n1626, the Lord Keeper sent to Lord Conway a second letter in which he\r\ncondemned the measure in strong terms:[692]\r\n\r\n     _My Lord_,--According to His Majesty's good pleasure, which\r\n     I received from your lordship, I have considered of the\r\n     grant desired by John Williams and Thomas Dixon for building\r\n     an Amphitheatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields; and comparing it\r\n     with that which was propounded in King James his time, do\r\n     find much difference between them: for that former was\r\n     intended principally for martiall exercises, and\r\n     extraordinary shows, and solemnities for ambassadors and\r\n     persons of honor and quality, with a cessation from other\r\n     shows and sports for one day in a month only, upon 14 days'\r\n     warning: whereas by this new grant I see little probability\r\n     of anything to be used but common plays, or ordinary sports\r\n     now used or showed at the Bear Garden or the common\r\n     playhouses about London, for all sorts of beholders, with a\r\n     restraint to all other plays and shows for one day in the\r\n     week upon two days' warning: with liberty to erect their\r\n     buildings in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where there are too many\r\n     buildings already; and which place in the late King's time\r\n     upon a petition exhibited by the Prince's comedians for\r\n     setting up a playhouse there, was certified by eleven\r\n     Justices of Peace under their hands to be very inconvenient.\r\n     And therefore, not holding this new grant fit to pass, as\r\n     being no other in effect but to translate the playhouses and\r\n     Bear Garden from the Bankside to a place much more unfit, I\r\n     thought fit to give your lordship these reasons for it;\r\n     wherewithal you may please to acquaint His Majesty, if there\r\n     shall be cause. And so remain your lordship's very assured\r\n     friend to do you service,\r\n\r\n     THO. COVENTRYE.\r\n\r\n     CANBURY, 28 _Sept._, 1626.\r\n       LO. CONWAY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 692: I quote the letter from Collier, _The History of\r\nEnglish Dramatic Poetry_ (1879), I, 444.]\r\n\r\nOn the letter Lord Conway has written the indorsement: \"That it is\r\nunfit the grant for the Amphitheatre should passe.\" And such, no\r\ndoubt, was the ultimate decision of the Privy Council, for we hear\r\nnothing more of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOGILBY'S DUBLIN THEATRE\r\n\r\nIn 1635 a playhouse was opened in Dublin by John\r\nOgilby,--dancing-master, theatrical manager, playwright, scholar,\r\ntranslator, poet,--now best known, perhaps, for the ridicule he\r\ninspired in Dryden's _MacFlecknoe_ and Pope's _Dunciad_. At the\r\nbeginning of his versatile career he was a successful London\r\ndancing-master, popular with \"the nobility and gentry.\" When Thomas\r\nEarl of Strafford was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he took\r\nOgilby with him to Dublin, to teach his wife and children the art of\r\ndancing, and also to help with the secretarial duties. Under\r\nStrafford's patronage, Ogilby was appointed to the post of Master of\r\nthe Revels for Ireland; and in this capacity he built a small\r\nplayhouse in Dublin and began to cultivate dramatic representations\r\nafter the manner of London. Anthony à Wood in _Athenæ Oxonienses_,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     He built a little theatre to act plays in, in St. Warburg's\r\n     street in Dublin, and was then and there valued by all\r\n     ingenious men for his great industry in promoting morality\r\n     and ingenuity.[693]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: Bliss's edition, III, 741.]\r\n\r\nAubrey writes:\r\n\r\n     He had a warrant from the Lord Lieutenant to be Master of\r\n     the Ceremonies for that kingdom; and built a pretty[694]\r\n     little theatre in St. Warburgh Street in Dublin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: \"Pretty little theatre\" is the reading of _MS. Aubr.\r\n7_, folio 20; _MS. Aubr. 8_ omits the adjective \"pretty.\" For Aubrey's\r\nfull account of Ogilby see Andrew Clark's _Brief Lives_ (1898), 2\r\nvols.]\r\n\r\nThe history of this \"little theatre\" is not known in detail. For its\r\nactors Ogilby himself wrote at least one play, entitled _The Merchant\r\nof Dublin_,[695] and Henry Burnell a tragi-comedy entitled\r\n_Landgartha_, printed in 1641 \"as it was presented in the new theatre\r\nin Dublin with good applause.\" But its chief playwright was James\r\nShirley, who came to Dublin in 1636 under the patronage of the Earl of\r\nKildare. For the Irish stage he wrote _The Royal Master_, published in\r\n1638 as \"acted in the new theatre in Dublin\"; _Rosania, or Love's\r\nVictory_, now known as _The Doubtful Heir_, under which title it was\r\nlater printed; _St. Patrick for Ireland_;[696] and in all probability\r\n_The Constant Maid_.[697] The actors, however, had little need to buy\r\noriginal plays, for they were free, no doubt, to take any of the\r\nnumerous London successes. From Shirley's _Poems_ we learn that they\r\nwere presenting Jonson's _Alchemist_, Middleton's _No Wit_, two of\r\nFletcher's plays, unnamed, and two anonymous plays entitled _The Toy_\r\nand _The General_; and we may fairly assume that they honored several\r\nof Shirley's early plays in the same way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: Aubrey mentions this as having been \"written in Dublin,\r\nand never printed.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 696: Published in 1640 as \"the first part,\" and both the\r\nPrologue and the Epilogue speak of a second part; but no second part\r\nwas printed, and in all probability it never was written.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 697: Never licensed for England; reprinted in 1657 with _St.\r\nPatrick for Ireland_.]\r\n\r\nThe theatre came to a sudden end with the outbreak of the rebellion in\r\n1641. In October the Lords Justices prohibited playing there; and\r\nshortly after, we are told, the building was \"ruined and spoiled, and\r\na cow-house made of the stage.\"[698]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: _MS. Aubr. 7_, folio 20 v. Ogilby's second theatre in\r\nDublin, built after the Restoration, does not fall within the scope of\r\nthe present work.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH PLAYERS' TEMPORARY THEATRE IN DRURY LANE\r\n\r\nIn February, 1635, a company of French players, under the leadership\r\nof the eminent actor, Josias de Soulas, better known by his stage-name\r\nof Floridor,[699] appeared in London, and won such favor at Court that\r\nthey were ultimately allowed to fit up a house in Drury Lane for a\r\ntemporary theatre. The history of these players is mainly found in the\r\nrecords of the Master of the Revels and of the Lord Chamberlain. From\r\nthe former, Malone has preserved the following entries by Herbert:\r\n\r\n     On Tuesday night the 17 of February, 1634 [i.e., 1635], a\r\n     French company of players, being approved of by the Queen at\r\n     her house two nights before, and commended by Her Majesty to\r\n     the King, were admitted to the Cockpitt in Whitehall, and\r\n     there presented the King and Queen with a French comedy\r\n     called _Melise_,[700] with good approbation: for which play\r\n     the King gave them ten pounds.\r\n\r\n     This day being Friday, and the 20 of the same month, the\r\n     King told me his pleasure, and commanded me to give order\r\n     that this French company should play the two sermon days in\r\n     the week during their time of playing in Lent [i.e.,\r\n     Wednesdays and Fridays, on which days during Lent the\r\n     English companies were not allowed to play], and in the\r\n     house of Drury Lane [i.e., the Cockpit Playhouse], where the\r\n     Queen's Players usually play. The King's pleasure I\r\n     signified to Mr. Beeston [the manager of the Cockpit] the\r\n     same day, who obeyed readily. The housekeepers are to give\r\n     them by promise the benefit of their interest[701] for the\r\n     two days of the first week. They had the benefit of playing\r\n     on the sermon days, and got two hundred pounds at least;\r\n     besides many rich clothes were given them. They had freely\r\n     to themselves the whole week before the week before\r\n     Easter,[702] which I obtained of the King for them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: See Frederick Hawkins, _Annals of the French Stage_\r\n(1884), I, 148 ff., for the career of this player on the French stage.\r\n\"Every gift required by the actor,\" says Hawkins, \"was possessed by\r\nFloridor.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: _La Melise, ou Les Princes Reconnus_, by Du Rocher,\r\nfirst acted in Paris in 1633; see _The Athenæum_, July 11, 1891, p.\r\n73; and cf. _ibid._, p. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 701: \"Housekeepers\" were owners, who always demanded of the\r\nplayers as rental for the building a certain part of each day's\r\ntakings. The passage quoted means that the housekeepers allowed the\r\nFrench players to receive _all_ money taken on the two sermon days of\r\nthe _first_ week, and after that exacted their usual share as rental\r\nfor the building.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 702: That is, Passion Week, during which time the English\r\ncompanies were never allowed to give performances.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the Cockpit in Drury Lane came to an end at Easter, for the\r\nQueen's own troupe, under Beeston's management, regularly occupied\r\nthat building. But the King summoned the French players to act at\r\nCourt on several occasions. Thus Herbert records:\r\n\r\n     The 4 April, on Easter Monday,[703] they played the\r\n     _Trompeur Puny_[704] with better approbation than the\r\n     other.\r\n\r\n     On Wednesday night, the 16 April,[705] 1635, the French\r\n     played _Alcimedor_[706] with good approbation.[707]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 703: This must be an error, for Easter Monday fell on March\r\n30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704: _Le Trompeur Puni, ou Histoire Septentrionale_, by\r\nScuderi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: Wednesday was the 15th.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: _Alcimedon_, by Duryer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 121, note.]\r\n\r\nClearly these actors were in high favor at Court. Sir Henry, who did\r\nnot as a rule show any hesitancy in accepting fees, notes in the\r\nmargin of his book: \"The French offered me a present of £10; but I\r\nrefused it, and did them many other courtesies gratis to render the\r\nQueen my mistress an acceptable service.\" In view of this royal favor,\r\nit is not surprising to find that, after they were driven from the\r\nCockpit, they received permission to fit up a temporary playhouse in\r\nthe manage, or riding-school, of one M. Le Febure, in Drury Lane. The\r\nLord Chamberlain's Office-Book contains the following entry on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n     18 April, 1635: His Majesty hath commanded me to signify his\r\n     royal pleasure that the French comedians (having agreed with\r\n     Mons. le Febure) may erect a stage, scaffolds, and seats,\r\n     and all other accommodations which shall be convenient, and\r\n     act and present interludes and stage plays at his house [and\r\n     manage[708]] in Drury Lane, during His Majesty's pleasure,\r\n     without any disturbance, hindrance, or interruption. And\r\n     this shall be to them, and Mr. le Febure, and to all others,\r\n     a sufficient discharge, &c.[709]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: This clause I insert from Mrs. Stopes's notes on the\r\nLord Chamberlain's records, in the Shakespeare _Jahrbuch_, XLVI, 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: I have chosen to reproduce the record from Chalmers's\r\n_Apology_, p. 506, note _s_, rather than from Mrs. Stopes's apparently\r\nless accurate notes in the Shakespeare _Jahrbuch_, XLVI, 97.]\r\n\r\nApparently the players lost little time in fitting up the building,\r\nfor we read in Herbert's Office-Book:\r\n\r\n     A warrant granted to Josias D'Aunay,[710] Hurfries de Lau,\r\n     and others, for to act plays at a new house in Drury Lane,\r\n     during pleasure, the 5 May, 1635.\r\n\r\n     The King was pleased to command my Lord Chamberlain to\r\n     direct his warrant to Monsieur Le Fevure, to give him a\r\n     power to contract with the Frenchmen for to build a\r\n     playhouse in the manage-house, which was done accordingly by\r\n     my advice and allowance.[711]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: Should we place a comma after \"Josias\"? That \"Josias\r\nFloridor\" was the leader of the troupe we know from two separate\r\nentries; cf. Chalmers, _Apology_, pp. 508, 509.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: Malone, _Variorum_, III, 122, note.]\r\n\r\nIn Glapthorne's _The Ladies' Priviledge_ is a good-natured allusion to\r\nthe French Company and their vivacious style of acting:[712]\r\n\r\n     _La._ But, Adorni,\r\n     What think you of the French?\r\n\r\n     _Ador._ Very airy people, who participate\r\n     More fire than earth; yet generally good,\r\n     And nobly disposition'd, something inclining\r\n     To over-weening fancy. This lady\r\n     Tells my remembrance of a comic scene\r\n     I once saw in their Theatre.\r\n\r\n     _Bon._ Add it to\r\n     Your former courtesies, and express it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: Act II, Scene i. This passage is pointed out by\r\nLawrence, _The Elizabethan Playhouse_, p. 137.]\r\n\r\nWhereupon, according to the stage direction, Adorni \"acts furiously.\"\r\n\r\nIn the margin of his Office-Book Sir Henry Herbert writes\r\ncomplacently: \"These Frenchmen were commended unto me by the Queen,\r\nand have passed through my hands gratis.\" This was indeed a rare favor\r\nfrom Herbert; but they did not so easily escape his deputy, William\r\nBlagrove, who accepted from them the sum of \"three pounds for his\r\npains.\"\r\n\r\nHow long the French actors occupied their temporary playhouse in Drury\r\nLane is not clear. In the Lord Chamberlain's book we find an entry\r\nshowing that they presented a play at Court in December, 1635:\r\n\"Warrant to pay £10 to Josias Floridor for himself and the rest of the\r\nFrench players for a tragedy by them played before His Majesty Dec.\r\nlast.\"[713] The entry is dated January 8, 1636, and, so far as I can\r\ndiscover, this is the last reference to the French players in London.\r\nWe may suppose that shortly after this they returned to Paris.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: Stopes, _op. cit._, p. 98, Chalmers, _Apology_, p.\r\n509.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDAVENANT'S PROJECTED THEATRE IN FLEET STREET\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1639, William Davenant, who had succeeded Ben Jonson as\r\nPoet Laureate, secured from King Charles a royal patent under the\r\nGreat Seal of England to erect a playhouse in Fleet Street, to be used\r\nnot only for regular plays, but also for \"musical entertainments\" and\r\n\"scenic representations.\" Davenant, as we know, was especially\r\ninterested in \"the art of perspective in scenes,\" and also in the\r\nItalian _opera musicale_. The royal patent--unusually verbose even for\r\na patent--is printed in full in Rymer's _Foedera_, XX, 377; I cite\r\nbelow all the essential passages:\r\n\r\n     [_The Building._] Know ye, that we, of our especial grace,\r\n     certain knowledge, and meere motion, and upon the humble\r\n     petition of our servant William Davenant, gentleman, have\r\n     given and granted, and by these presents, for us, our heirs,\r\n     and successors, do give and grant unto the said William\r\n     Davenant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns,\r\n     full power, license, and authority ... to frame, new-build,\r\n     and set up ... a Theatre or Playhouse, with necessary tiring\r\n     and retiring rooms, and other places convenient, containing\r\n     in the whole forty yards square at the most,[714] wherein\r\n     plays, musical entertainments, scenes, or other like\r\n     presentments may be presented ... so as the outwalls of the\r\n     said Theatre or Playhouse, tiring or retiring rooms, be made\r\n     or built of brick or stone, according to the tenor of our\r\n     proclamations in that behalf.\r\n\r\n     [_Its Location._] Upon a parcel of ground lying near unto or\r\n     behind the Three Kings Ordinary in Fleet Street, in the\r\n     parishes of Saint Dunstan's in the West, London, or in Saint\r\n     Bride's, London, or in either of them; or in any other\r\n     ground in or about that place, or in the whole street\r\n     aforesaid, already allotted to him for that use, or in any\r\n     other place that is or hereafter shall be assigned or\r\n     allotted out to the said William Davenant by our right\r\n     trusty and right well-beloved cousin and counsellor Thomas,\r\n     Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshall of England, or any\r\n     other of our commissioners for building for that time being\r\n     in that behalf.\r\n\r\n     [_Its Uses._] And we do hereby, for us, our heirs, and\r\n     successors, grant to the said William Davenant, his heirs,\r\n     executors, administrators, and assigns, that it shall and\r\n     may be lawful to and for him, the said William Davenant, his\r\n     heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, from time to\r\n     time to gather together, entertain, govern, privilege, and\r\n     keep, such and so many players and persons, to exercise\r\n     action, musical presentments, scenes, dancing, and the like,\r\n     as he, the said William Davenant, his heirs, executors,\r\n     administrators, and assigns shall think fit and approve for\r\n     the said house; and such persons to permit and continue at\r\n     and during the pleasure of the said William Davenant, his\r\n     heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, from time to\r\n     time to act plays in such house so to be by him or them\r\n     erected; and exercise music, musical presentments, scenes,\r\n     dancing, or other the like, at the same, or other, hours, or\r\n     times, or after plays are ended,[715] peaceably and quietly,\r\n     without the impeachment or impediment of any person or\r\n     persons whatsoever, for the honest recreation of such as\r\n     shall desire to see the same. And that it shall and may be\r\n     lawful to and for the said William Davenant, his heirs,\r\n     executors, administrators, and assigns, to take and receive\r\n     of such our subjects as shall resort to see or hear any such\r\n     plays, scenes, and entertainments whatsoever, such sum or\r\n     sums of money as is, are, or hereafter from time to time\r\n     shall be accustomed to be given or taken in other playhouses\r\n     and places for the like plays, scenes, presentments, and\r\n     entertainments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: The Fortune was only eighty feet square, but the stage\r\nprojected to the middle of the yard. Davenant probably wished to\r\nprovide for an alcove stage of sufficient depth to accommodate his\r\n\"scenes.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: That is, he may give his \"musical presentments,\" etc.,\r\neither at the hours when he was accustomed to give plays, or after his\r\nplays are ended. This does not necessarily imply evening\r\nentertainments.]\r\n\r\nThe novelty of the scheme and the great size of the proposed building\r\nmust have alarmed the owners of playhouses. That the established\r\ntheatrical proprietors were hostile is clearly indicated by the\r\nattitude of Richard Heton, one of the Sewers of the Chamber to Queen\r\nHenrietta, and at the time manager of the Salisbury Court Playhouse.\r\nIn September, 1639, he wrote out a document entitled \"Instructions for\r\nmy Patent,\" in which he advanced reasons why he should receive the\r\nsole power to elect the members of the Queen's Company of Players. He\r\nobserves that under the existing arrangement the company was free to\r\nleave the Salisbury Court Playhouse at their pleasure, \"as in one year\r\nand a half of their being here they have many times threatened\"; and\r\nhe concludes by adding: \"and one now of the chief fellows [i.e.,\r\nsharers of the company], an agent for one [William Davenant] that hath\r\ngot a grant from the King for the building of a new playhouse which\r\nwas intended to be in Fleet Street, which no man can judge that a\r\nfellow of our Company, and a well-wisher to those that own the house,\r\nwould ever be an actor in.\"[716] Doubtless the owners of other houses\r\nhad the same sentiments, and exercised what influence they possessed\r\nagainst the scheme. But the most serious opposition in all probability\r\ncame from the citizens and merchants living in the neighborhood. We\r\nknow how bitterly they complained about the coaches that brought\r\nplaygoers to the small Blackfriars Theatre, and how strenuously from\r\nyear to year they sought the expulsion of the King's Men from the\r\nprecinct.[717] They certainly would not have regarded with complacency\r\nthe erection in their midst of a still larger theatre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: Cunningham, _The Whitefriars Theatre_, in _The\r\nShakespeare Society's Papers_, IV, 96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: See the chapter on the Second Blackfriars.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the opposition, it was so powerful that on October 2 Davenant\r\nwas compelled to make an indenture by which he virtually\r\nrenounced[718] for himself and his heirs for ever the right to build a\r\ntheatre in Fleet Street, or in any other place \"in or near the cities,\r\nor suburbs of the cities, of London or Westminster,\" without further\r\nand special permission granted. This document, first printed by\r\nChalmers in his _Supplemental Apology_, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     This indenture made the second day of October, in the\r\n     fifteenth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord Charles,\r\n     by the grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, and\r\n     Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, &c. _Anno Domini_ 1639.\r\n     Between the said King's most excellent Majesty of the first\r\n     part, and William Davenant of London, Gent., of the other\r\n     part. Whereas the said King's most excellent Majesty, by His\r\n     Highness's letters patents under the Great Seal of England\r\n     bearing date the six and twentieth day of March last past\r\n     before the date of these presents, did give and grant unto\r\n     the said William Davenant, his heirs, executors,\r\n     administrators, and assigns full power, license, and\r\n     authority that he, they, and every of them, by him and\r\n     themselves and by all and every such person or persons as he\r\n     or they shall depute or appoint, and his and their laborers,\r\n     servants, and workmen, shall and may lawfully, quietly, and\r\n     peaceably frame, erect, new build, and set up upon a parcel\r\n     of ground lying near unto or behind the Three Kings Ordinary\r\n     in Fleet Street in the Parish of St. Dunstan's in the West,\r\n     London, or in St. Bride's London, or in either of them, or\r\n     in any other ground in or about that place, or in the whole\r\n     street aforesaid, already allotted to him for that use, or\r\n     in any other place that is or hereafter shall be assigned\r\n     and allotted out to the said William Davenant by the Right\r\n     Honorable Thomas, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshall\r\n     of England, or any other His Majesty's Commissioners for\r\n     Building, for the time being in that behalf, a theatre or\r\n     playhouse with necessary tiring and retiring rooms and other\r\n     places convenient, containing in the whole forty yards\r\n     square at the most, wherein plays, musical entertainments,\r\n     scenes, or other the like presentments may be presented by\r\n     and under certain provisors or conditions in the same\r\n     contained, as in and by the said letters patents, whereunto\r\n     relation being had more fully and at large, it doth and may\r\n     appear.\r\n\r\n     Now this indenture witnesseth, and the said William Davenant\r\n     doth by these presents declare, His Majesty's intent,\r\n     meaning at and upon the granting of the said license was and\r\n     is that he, the said William Davenant, his heirs,\r\n     executors, administrators nor assigns should not frame,\r\n     build, or set up the said theatre or playhouse in any place\r\n     inconvenient, and that the said parcel of ground lying near\r\n     unto or behind the Three Kings Ordinary in Fleet Street in\r\n     the said Parish of St. Dunstan's in the West, London, or in\r\n     St. Bride's, London, or in either of them, or in any other\r\n     ground in or about that place, or in the whole street\r\n     aforesaid, and is sithence found inconvenient and unfit for\r\n     that purpose, therefore the said William Davenant doth for\r\n     himself his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns,\r\n     and every of them, covenant, promise, and agree to and with\r\n     our said Sovereign Lord the King, his heirs and successors,\r\n     that he, the said William Davenant, his heirs, executors,\r\n     administrators, nor assigns shall not, nor will not, by\r\n     virtue of the said license and authority to him granted as\r\n     aforesaid, frame, erect, new build, or set up upon the said\r\n     parcel of ground in Fleet Street aforesaid, or in any other\r\n     part of Fleet Street, a theatre or playhouse, nor will not\r\n     frame, erect, new build, or set up upon any other parcel of\r\n     ground lying in or near the cities, or suburbs of the\r\n     cities, of London or Westminster any theatre or playhouse,\r\n     unless the said place shall be first approved and allowed by\r\n     warrant under His Majesty's sign manual, or by writing under\r\n     the hand and seal of the said Right Honorable Thomas, Earl\r\n     of Arundel and Surrey. In witness whereof to the one part of\r\n     this indenture the said William Davenant hath set his hand\r\n     and seal the day and year first above written.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM DAVENANT. L.S.\r\n\r\n     Signed sealed and delivered\r\n       in the presence of\r\n       Edw. Penruddoks.\r\n       Michael Baker.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: That he did not actually surrender the patent is shown\r\nby the fact that he claimed privileges by virtue of it after the\r\nRestoration; see Halliwell-Phillipps, _A Collection of Ancient\r\nDocuments_, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nPossibly as a recompense for this surrender of his rights, Davenant\r\nwas made Governor of the King's and Queen's Servants at the Cockpit in\r\nJune of the following year; and from this time until the suppression\r\nof acting in 1642, he expended his energies in managing the affairs of\r\nthis important playhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the following list are included the books and articles\r\nconstituting the main authorities upon which the present study is\r\nbased. The list is not intended to be an exhaustive bibliography,\r\nthough from the nature of the case it is fairly complete. For the\r\nguidance of scholars the more important titles are marked with\r\nasterisks. It will be seen that not all the works are included which\r\nare cited in the text, or referred to in footnotes; the list, in fact,\r\nis strictly confined to works bearing upon the history of the\r\npre-Restoration playhouses. Considerations of space have led to the\r\nomission of a large number of books dealing with the topography of\r\nLondon, and of the counties of Middlesex and Surrey, although a\r\nknowledge of these is essential to any thorough study of the\r\nplayhouses. Furthermore, titles of contemporary plays, pamphlets, and\r\ntreatises are excluded, except a few of unusual and general value.\r\nFinally, discussions of the structure of the early stage, of the\r\nmanner of dramatic performances in the time of Shakespeare, and of the\r\ntravels of English actors on the Continent are omitted, except when\r\nthese contain also material important for the study of the theatres.\r\nAt the close is appended a select list of early maps and views of\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: In the original book, the numbers of the entries\r\nbelow are at the end of the entry at the right margin, preceded by a\r\nsingle square bracket.
