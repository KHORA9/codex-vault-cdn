The dream of centuries was now a little nearer towards\r\nfulfilment. But many obstacles remained. There would presumably be\r\nopposition on the part of the Italian and Roumanian Governments, for it\r\nwas too much to hope that these would waive the treaties they had wrung\r\nfrom the Entente, and would consent to have their boundaries regulated\r\nby the wishes of the people living in disputed lands. Some individual\r\nItalians and Roumanians might even be less reasonable than their\r\nGovernments. If Austria and Hungary were in too great a chaos to have\r\nany attitude as nations, there would be doubtless local opposition to\r\nthe Yugoslavs. And as soon as the Magyars had found their feet they\r\nwould be sure to bombard the Entente with protestations, setting forth\r\nthat subject nationalities were intended by the Creator to be subject\r\nnationalities. A large pamphlet, _The Hungarian Nation_, was issued at\r\nBuda-Pest in February 1920. It displayed a very touching solicitude for\r\nthe Croats, whom the Serbs would be sure to tyrannize most horribly. If\r\nonly Croatia would remain in the Hungarian State, says Mr. A. Kovacs,\r\nMinisterial Councillor in the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, then\r\nthe Magyars would instantly bestow on her both Bosnia (which belonged to\r\nthe Empire as a whole) and Dalmatia (which belonged to Austria). That is\r\nthe worst of being a Ministerial Statistical Councillor. Another\r\ngentleman, Professor Dr. Fodor, has the bright idea that \"the race is\r\nthe multitude of individuals who inhabit one uniform region.\" ...\r\nPassing to Yugoslavia's domestic obstacles, it was impossible to think\r\nthat all the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes would forthwith subscribe to\r\nthe Declaration of Corfu and become excellent Yugoslavs. Some would be\r\nhonestly unable to throw off what centuries had done to them, and\r\nrealize that if they had been made so different from their brothers,\r\nthey were brothers still. For ten days there was a partly domestic,\r\npartly foreign obstacle, but as the King of Montenegro did not take his\r\ncourage in both hands and descend on the shores of that country with an\r\nItalian army, he lost his chance for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUMANIAN ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThere was indeed far less trouble from the Roumanian than from the\r\nItalian side. On October 29, 1918, one could say that all military power\r\nin the Banat was at an end. The Hungarian army took what food it wanted\r\nand made off, leaving everywhere, in barracks and in villages, guns,\r\nrifles, ammunition. Vainly did the officers attempt to keep their men\r\ntogether. And scenes like this were witnessed all over the Banat. Then\r\nsuddenly, on Sunday, November 3, the Roumanians, that is the Roumanians\r\nliving in the country, made attacks on many villages, and the Roumanians\r\nof Transylvania acted in a similar fashion. With the Hungarian equipment\r\nand with weapons of their own they started out to terrorize. Among their\r\ntargets were the village notaries, in whom was vested the administrative\r\nauthority. At Old Moldava, on the Danube, they decapitated the notary, a\r\nman called Kungel, and threw his head into the river. At a village near\r\nAnina they buried the notary except for his head, which they proceeded\r\nto kick until he died. Nor did they spare the notaries of Roumanian\r\norigin, which made it seem as if this outbreak of lawlessness--directed\r\nfrom who knows where--had the high political end of making the country\r\nappear to the Entente in such a desperate condition that an army must be\r\nintroduced, and as the Serbs were thought to be a long way off, with the\r\nrailways and the roads before them ruined by the Austrians, it looked as\r\nif Roumania's army was the only one available. On the Monday and the\r\nTuesday these Roumanian freebooters, who had all risen on the same day\r\nin regions extending over hundreds of square kilometres, started\r\nplundering the large estates. Near Bela Crkva, on the property of Count\r\nBissingen-Nippenburg, a German, they did damage to the sum of eight and\r\na half million crowns. At the monastery of Me[vs]ica, near Ver[vs]ac,\r\nthe Roumanians of a neighbouring village devastated the archimandrate's\r\nlarge library, sacked the chapel and smashed his bee-hives, so that they\r\nwere not impelled by poverty and hunger. In the meantime there had been\r\nformed at Ver[vs]ac a National Roumanian Military Council. The placard,\r\nprinted of course in Roumanian, is dated Ver[vs]ac, November 4, and is\r\naddressed to \"The Roumanian Officers and Soldiers born in the Banat,\"\r\nand announces that they have formed the National Council. It is a\r\nCouncil, we are told, in which one can have every confidence; moreover,\r\nit is prepared to co-operate in every way with a view to maintaining\r\norder _in l[)a]untra [s,]i in afar[)a]_ (both internal and external).\r\nThe subjoined names of the committee are numerous; they range from\r\nLieut.-Colonel Gavriil Mihailov and Major Petru Jucu downwards to a\r\ndozen privates. The archimandrate, who fortunately happened to be at his\r\nhouse in Ver[vs]ac, begged his friend Captain Singler of the\r\n_gendarmerie_ to take some steps. About twenty Hungarian officers\r\nundertook to go, with a machine gun, to the monastery on November 7; at\r\neleven on the previous night Mihailov ordered the captain to come to see\r\nhim; he wanted to know by whom this expedition had been authorized. The\r\ncaptain answered that Me[vs]ica was in his district, and that he had no\r\nanimus against Roumanians but only against plunderers. After his arrival\r\nat Me[vs]ica the trouble was brought to an end. Nor was it long before\r\nthe Serbian troops, riding up through their own country at a rate which\r\nno one had foreseen, crossed the Danube and occupied the Banat, in\r\nconjunction with the French. The rapidity of this advance astounded the\r\nRoumanians; they gaped like Lavengro when he wondered how the stones\r\never came to Stonehenge.... When the Serbian commandant at Ver[vs]ac\r\ninvited these enterprising Roumanian officers to an interview he was\r\nasked by one of them, Major Iricu, whether or not they were to be\r\ninterned. \"What made you print that placard?\" asked the commandant; and\r\nthey replied that their object had been to preserve order. They had not\r\nimagined, so they said, that the Serbs would come so quickly. \"I will be\r\nglad,\" said the commandant, \"if you will not do this kind of thing any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN FRAME OF MIND\r\n\r\nItaly was not in a good humour. She was well aware that in the countries\r\nof her Allies there was a marked tendency to underestimate her\r\noverwhelming triumphs of the last days of the War. Perhaps those\r\nexploits would have been more difficult if Austria's army had not\r\nsuffered a deterioration, but still one does not take 300,000 prisoners\r\nevery day. Some faithful foreigners were praising Italy--and she\r\ndeserved it--for having persevered at all after Caporetto. That disaster\r\nhad been greatly due to filling certain regiments with several thousand\r\nmunition workers who had taken part in a revolt at Turin, and then\r\nconcentrating these regiments in the Caporetto salient, which was the\r\nmost vulnerable sector in the eastern Italian front. How much of the\r\ndisaster was due to the Vatican will perhaps never be known. But as for\r\nthe uneducated, easily impressed peasants of the army, it was wonderful\r\nthat all, except the second army and a small part of the third,\r\nretreated with such discipline in view of what they had been brooding on\r\nbefore the day of Caporetto. They had such vague ideas what they were\r\nfighting for, and if the Socialists kept saying that the English paid\r\ntheir masters to continue with the War--how were they to know what was\r\nthe truth? The British regiments, who were received not merely with\r\ncigars and cigarettes and flowers and with little palm crosses which\r\ntheir trustful little weavers had blessed, but also with showers of\r\nstones as they passed through Italian villages in 1917, must have\r\nsometimes understood and pardoned. Then the troops were in distress\r\nabout their relatives, for things were more and more expensive, and\r\nwhere would it end? In face of these discouragements it was most\r\nadmirable that the army and the nation rallied and reconstituted their\r\n_morale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSITIVENESS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ARMY\r\n\r\nOf course one should not generalize regarding nations, except in vague\r\nor very guarded terms; but possibly it would not be unjust to say that\r\nthe Italians, apart from those of northern provinces and of Sardinia,\r\nhave too much imagination to make first-class soldiers. And they are too\r\nsensitive, as you could see in an Italian military hospital. Their task\r\nwas also not a trifling one--to stand for all those months in territory\r\nso forbidding. And there would have been more sympathy with the Italians\r\nin the autumn of 1918 if they had not had such very crushing triumphs\r\nwhen the War was practically over. What was the condition of the\r\nAustrian army? About October 15, in one section of the front--35\r\nkilometres separating the extreme points from one another--the following\r\nincidents occurred: the Army Command at St. Vitto issued an order to the\r\nofficers invariably to carry a revolver, since the men were now\r\nattacking them; a Magyar regiment revolted and marched away, under the\r\ncommand of a Second-Lieutenant whom they had elected; at Stino di\r\nLivenza, while the officers were having their evening meal, two hand\r\ngrenades were thrown into the mess by soldiers; at Codroipo a regiment\r\nrevolted, attacked the officers' mess, and wounded several of the people\r\nthere, including the general in command. Such was the Austrian army in\r\nthose days; and it was only human if comparisons were made--not making\r\nany allowances for Italy's economic difficulties, her coal, her social\r\nand her religious difficulties--but merely bald comparisons were made\r\nbetween these wholesale victories against the Austrians as they were in\r\nthe autumn of 1918 and the scantier successes of the previous years. In\r\nSeptember 1916 when the eighth or ninth Italian offensive had pierced\r\nthe Austrian front and the Italians reached a place called Provachina,\r\nMarshal Boroevi['c] had only one reserve division. The heavy artillery\r\nwas withdrawn, the light artillery was packed up, the company commanders\r\nhaving orders to retire in the night. Only a few rapid-fire batteries\r\nwere left with a view to deceiving the enemy. But as the Italians\r\nappeared to the Austrians to have no heart to come on--there may have\r\nbeen other reasons--the artillery was unpacked and the Austrians\r\nreturned to their old front. In May 1917, between Monte Gabriele and\r\nDoberdo, Boroevi['c] had no reserve battalion; his troops, in full\r\nmarching kit, had to defend the whole front: they were able to do so by\r\nproceeding now to this sector and now to that. No army is immune from\r\nserious mistakes--\"We won in 1871,\" said Bismarck, \"although we made\r\nvery many mistakes, because the French made even more\"--but the\r\nYugoslavs in the Austrian army could not forget such incidents as that\r\nconnected with the name of Professor Pivko. This gentleman, who is now\r\nliving at Maribor, was made the subject of a book, _Der Verrath bei\r\nCarzano_ (\"The Treachery near Carzano\"), which was published by the\r\nAustrian General Staff. His battalion commander was a certain\r\nLieut.-Colonel Vidale, who was a first cousin of the C.O., General\r\nVidale; and when an orderly overheard Pivko, who is a Slovene, and\r\nseveral Czech officers, discussing a plan which would open the front to\r\nthe Italians, he ran all the way to the General's headquarters and gave\r\nthe information. The General telephoned to his cousin, who said that the\r\nallegation was absurd and that Pivko was one of his best officers. The\r\norderly was therefore thrown into prison, and Pivko, having turned off\r\nthe electricity from the barbed wires and arranged matters with a\r\nBosnian regiment, made his way to the Italians. The suggestion is that,\r\nowing to the lie of the land and the weak Austrian forces, it was\r\npossible for the Italians to reach Trent; anyhow the Austrians were\r\namazed when they ceased to advance and the German regiment which was in\r\nTrent did not have to come out to defend it. Everyone in the Austrian\r\narmy recognized that the Italian artillery was pre-eminent and that the\r\nofficers were most gallant, especially in the early part of the War,\r\nwhen one would frequently find an officer lying dead with no men near\r\nhim. But such episodes as the above-mentioned--it would be possible, but\r\nwearisome, to describe others--could not but have some effect on the\r\nopposing army, and would be recalled when the Italians sang their final\r\npanegyric. The reasons for the Austrian _debacle_ on the Piave are as\r\nfollows: when the Allied troops had reached Rann, Susegana, Ponte di\r\nPiave and Montiena, the Austrian High Command decided on October 24 to\r\nthrow against them the 36th Croat division, the 21st Czech, the 44th\r\nSlovene, a German division and the 12th Croat Regiment of Uhlans.\r\nHowever, the 16th and 116th Croat, the 30th Regiment of Czech Landwehr\r\nand the 71st Slovene Landwehr Regiment declared that they would not\r\nfight against the French and English, and, instead of advancing,\r\nretired. The 78th Croat Regiment, as well as three other Czech\r\nRegiments, abandoned the front, after having made a similar declaration.\r\nAt the same time the 96th and 135th Croat Regiments, in agreement with\r\nthe Czech detachments, made a breach for the Italians on the left wing\r\nat Stino di Livenza, while Slav marching formations revolted at Udine.\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian troops consequently had to retreat.... No one\r\nexpects of the Italian army, as a whole, that it will be on a level\r\nwith the best, but when the British officers who were with the Serbs on\r\nthe Salonica front compare their reminiscences with those of the British\r\nofficers on the Italian front, it is improbable that garlands will be\r\nstrewn for the Italians. Towards the end of October a plan was adopted\r\nby the British and Italian staffs for capturing the island of Papadopoli\r\nin the Piave; this island, about three miles in length, formed the\r\noutpost line of the Austrian defences. On the night of October 23-24 an\r\nattack was to be made by the 2nd H.A.C., while three companies of the\r\n1st Royal Welsh Fusiliers were to act as reserve. This operation is most\r\nvividly described by the Senior Chaplain of the 7th Division, the Rev.\r\nE. C. Crosse, D.S.O., M.C.;[1] and he says nothing as to what occurred\r\non that part of the island which was to be seized by the Italians. Well,\r\nnothing had occurred, for the Italians did not get across and when the\r\nwater rose they said they could do nothing on that night. These are the\r\nwords of Mr. Crosse's footnote: \"The obvious question, 'What was going\r\nto be done with the farther half of the island?' we have purposely left\r\nundiscussed here. This half was outside the area of the 7th Division,\r\nand as such it falls outside the scope of this work for the time being.\r\nThe subsequent capture of the whole island (on the following night) by\r\nthe 7th Division was not part of the original plan.\" Afterwards, when a\r\ncrossing was made to the mainland, the left flank was unsupported, as\r\nthe Italians did not cross the river, and thus the 23rd Division had its\r\nflank exposed. A belief is entertained that the Italian cavalry is one\r\nof the best in the world; evidently it is not the best, for on that\r\nPiave front, where thousands of Italian cavalry were available, the only\r\nones who put in their appearance early in the battle were three hundred\r\nvery war-stained Northampton Yeomanry.\r\n\r\n\"The record of the Italian troops in the field renders unnecessary an\r\nassertion of their courage,\" says Mr. Anthony Dell;[2] \"for reckless\r\nbravery in assault none surpasses them.\" But when you have said that you\r\nhave nearly summed up their military virtues, for discipline is not\r\ntheir strong suit, and they have little sense of responsibility. On the\r\nother hand, we must remember their admirable patience, but the great\r\nmass of the people have not attained the level of Christianity; they are\r\nsavage both in heart and mind, with no outlook wider than that of the\r\nfamily. It is the Italian proletariat which is judged by the Yugoslavs,\r\nwhose otherwise acute discernment has been warped by the unhappy\r\ncircumstances of the time. Indifferent to the fact that he himself is a\r\ncompound of physical energy and oriental mysticism, the Yugoslav has\r\nbecome inclined to contemplate merely the physical side of the Italian,\r\nand for the most part that portion of it which has to do with war. The\r\nItalian long-sightedness and prudence and business capacity are ignored\r\nsave in so far as they delayed the country's entrance into the Great\r\nWar. The sensitiveness and artistic attributes of the Italians, who gaze\r\nwith aching hearts upon the glories of a sunset, are but rarely felt by\r\nSerbs, who gather brushwood for the fire that is to roast their\r\nsucking-pig and who sit down to watch the operation, haply with their\r\nbacks turned to the sunset. The Yugoslav, especially the Serb, is a man\r\nfrom the Middle Ages brought suddenly into the twentieth century. With\r\nhis heroic heart and his wonderful strength he fails to understand those\r\npeople who, on account of one reason or another, have no passion for\r\nwar. And as the military deeds of the Italians have had such effect upon\r\nthe minds of the Yugoslavs, we have alluded to them at a greater length\r\nthan would otherwise have been profitable. The Yugoslavs despise the\r\nItalians. Also the Italians, who concern themselves with diplomacy, are\r\nconscious that their keen wits and their long training in the wiles of\r\nthe civilized world, their old traditions and their prestige give them a\r\nconsiderable advantage over the Yugoslav diplomat, so that this kind of\r\nItalian despises the Yugoslav. He knows very well that the French or\r\nBritish statesmen do not, amid the smoke of after-dinner cigars, esteem\r\nhis case by the same standard as that which they apply to the case which\r\nthe ordinary Yugoslav diplomat presents to them in office hours. As for\r\nthe wider Italian circles, one must fear that the old hatred of Germany,\r\nbecause the Germans seemed to despise them, will henceforward colour the\r\nsentiments with which they regard the Yugoslavs. It is a state of things\r\nbetween these neighbours which other people cannot but view with\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNFORTUNATE NAVAL AFFAIR\r\n\r\nThere was in Yugoslav naval circles no very cordial feeling for the\r\nItalians. The Austrian dreadnought, _Viribus Unitis_, was torpedoed in a\r\nmost ingenious fashion by two resolute officers, Lieutenant Raffaele\r\nPaolucci, a doctor, and Major Raffaele Rossetti. In October 1917 they\r\nindependently invented a very small and light compressed-air motor which\r\ncould be used to propel a mine into an enemy harbour. They submitted\r\ntheir schemes to the Naval Inventions Board, were given an opportunity\r\nof meeting, and after three months had brought their invention into a\r\npractical form. The naval authorities, however, refused to allow them to\r\ngo on any expedition till they both were skilled long-distance swimmers.\r\nSix months had thus to be dedicated entirely to swimming. At the end of\r\nthat time they were supplied with a motor-boat and two bombs of a\r\nsuitable size for blowing up large airships. To these bombs were fixed\r\nthe small motors by means of which they were to be propelled into the\r\nport of Pola, while the two men, swimming by their side, would control\r\nand guide them. Just after nightfall on October 31, 1918, the raiders\r\narrived outside Pola.\r\n\r\nWere they aware that anything had happened in the Austro-Hungarian navy?\r\nOn October 26 there appeared in the _Hrvatski List_ of Pola a summons to\r\nthe Yugoslavs, made by the Executive Committee of Zagreb, which had been\r\nelected on the 23rd. This notice in the newspaper recommended the\r\nformation of local committees, and asked the Yugoslavs in the meantime\r\nto eschew all violence. When Rear-Admiral (then Captain) Methodius\r\nKoch--whose mother was an Englishwoman--read this at noon he thought it\r\nwas high time to do something. Koch had always been one of the most\r\npatriotically Slovene officers of the Austrian navy. On various\r\noccasions during the War he had attempted to hand over his ships to the\r\nItalians, and when some other Austrian commander signalled to ask him\r\nwhy he was cruising so near to the Italian coast he invariably answered,\r\n\"I have my orders.\" He found it, however, impossible to give himself up,\r\nas the Italians whom he sighted, no matter how numerous they were, would\r\nnever allow him to come within signalling range. Koch had frequently\r\nspoken to his Slovene sailors, preparing them for the day of liberation,\r\nand he was naturally very popular among them. Let us not forget that\r\nsuch an officer, true to his own people, was in constant peril of being\r\nshot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WAS HAPPENING AT POLA\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of that same day, October 26th, when the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire, with its army and navy, was collapsing, Admiral\r\nHorthy, an energetic, honest, if not brilliant Magyar, the Commander of\r\nthe Fleet at Pola, called to his flag-ship, the _Viribus Unitis_, one\r\nofficer representing each nationality of the Empire. Koch was there on\r\nbehalf of the Slovenes. The Admiral announced that a wholesale mutiny\r\nhad been planned for November 1st, during which the ships' treasuries\r\nwould be robbed, and he asked these officers to collaborate with him in\r\npreventing it. Koch, at the Admiral's request, wrote out a speech that\r\nhe would deliver to the Slovenes, and this document, with one or two\r\nnotes in the Admiral's writing, is in Koch's possession. \"If you will\r\nnot listen to your Admirals, then,\" so ran the speech, \"you should\r\nlisten to our national leaders.\" He addressed himself to the men, of\r\ncourse in the Slovene language, as a fellow-countryman. He begged them\r\nto keep quiet. He deprecated all plundering, firstly in order that their\r\ngood name should not be sullied, and also pointing out that the\r\nneighbouring population was overwhelmingly Slovene. Out of 45,000 men\r\nonly 2000 could leave by rail; he therefore asked them all to stay\r\npeacefully at Pola. Meanwhile the local committee had been formed; Koch\r\nwas, secretly, a member of it, and on the 28th, Rear-Admiral Cicoli, a\r\nkindly old gentleman who was port-commandant, advised Koch to join it as\r\nliaison-officer. It was on the 28th at eight in the morning that the\r\nofficers who had been selected to calm the different nationalities\r\nstarted to go round the fleet. That officer who spoke to the Germans\r\ndeclared that one must not abandon hopes of victory, and that anyhow the\r\nWar would soon be over. Count Thun, who discoursed to the Czechs, was\r\nill-advised enough to make the Deity, their Kaiser and their oath the\r\nmain subjects of his remarks, so that he was more than once in great\r\ndanger of being thrown overboard. Koch went first of all to the _Viribus\r\nUnitis_, but the mutiny had begun; a bugle was sounded for a general\r\nassembly; it was ignored, and the crew let it be known that they were\r\nweary of the old game, which consisted of the officers egging on one\r\nnation against another. This mutiny had not yet spread to the remaining\r\nships, and on them the speeches were delivered. At the National Assembly\r\nthat evening Koch was chosen as chief of National Defence; he thereupon\r\nwent to Cicoli and formally asked to be allowed to join the committee.\r\nWhen Vienna refused its assent, Koch resigned his commission. By this\r\ntime all discipline had gone by the board, no one thought of such a\r\nthing as office work and, amid the chaos, sailors' councils appeared,\r\nwith which Koch had to treat. The situation was made no easier by the\r\npresence of large numbers of Germans, Magyars and Italians, of whom the\r\nlatter also formed a National Council. On the 30th, Koch, as chief of\r\nNational Defence, asked Admirals Cicoli and Horthy to come at 9 p.m. to\r\nthe Admiralty, with a view to the transference of the military power. At\r\n7.30, in the municipal building, there was a joint meeting of the\r\nYugoslav and the Italian National Councils, and so many speeches were\r\nmade that the Admirals had to be asked to postpone their appearance for\r\ntwo hours; and at eleven o'clock, with the street well guarded against a\r\npossible outbreak on the part of any loyal troops, the whole Yugoslav\r\ncommittee, accompanied by one member of the Italian committee, went to\r\nthe Admiralty. Horthy had gone home, but Cicoli and his whole staff were\r\nwaiting. The old gentleman was informed that he no longer had any power\r\nin his hands; he was asked to give up his post to Koch, and this he was\r\nprepared to do. \"It is not so hard for me now,\" he said, \"as I have\r\nmeanwhile received a telegram from His Majesty, ordering me,\" and at\r\nthis point he produced the paper, \"to give up Pola to the Yugoslavs.\"\r\nThe affair had apparently been settled between nine and eleven o'clock.\r\nCicoli was ready to sign the protocol, but out of courtesy to a\r\nchivalrous old man this was left undone; after all there were witnesses\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of October 30th-31st, a radiogram, destined for President\r\nWilson, was composed. \"Together with the Czechs, the Slovaks and the Poles,\r\nand in understanding,\" it said, \"with the Italians, we have taken over the\r\nfleet and Pola, the war-harbour, and the forts.\" It asked for the dispatch\r\nof representatives of such Entente States as were disinterested in the\r\nlocal national question. But now a telegram was received from Zagreb,\r\nannouncing that Dr. Ante Tresi['c]-Pavi[vc]i['c], of the chief National\r\nCouncil, would be at Pola at 8 a.m. and that, pending his arrival, no\r\nwireless was to be sent out. Dr. Tresi['c]-Pavi[vc]i['c],[3] poet and\r\ndeputy for the lower Dalmatian islands, had always been, in spite of his\r\nindifferent health, one of the most strenuous fighters for Yugoslavia. Two\r\nyears of the War he spent in an Austrian prison, but on his release he\r\nmanaged to travel up and down Croatia and Dalmatia, inciting the Yugoslav\r\nsailors to revolt; many of them had already read a speech by this\r\nsilver-tongued deputy in the Reichsrath, a speech of which the reading and\r\ncirculation had been forbidden as a crime of high treason. About 9 a.m. of\r\nthe 31st there was a meeting, on board the _Viribus Unitis_, between\r\nTresi['c]-Pavi[vc]i['c] and Koch. There was a brief ceremony, the leader of\r\nthe Sailors' Council handing over the vessel to the deputy, as representing\r\nthe National Council of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Admiral Horthy, in his\r\ncabin, likewise drew up a _proces-verbal_ to the same effect, saying that\r\nhe was authorized to do this by the Emperor, and he supported his statement\r\nby the production of a wireless message. Koch urged on the doctor the\r\nnecessity of sending the above-mentioned wireless to Wilson. \"The news of\r\nthis great event,\" says Tresi['c]-Pavi[vc]i['c] in an article in the\r\n_Balkan Review_ (May 1919), \"was dispatched to all the Powers by wireless.\"\r\nBut unfortunately he seems, whether on his own responsibility or that of\r\nZagreb, to have prevented Koch from sending it on that day. Captain Janko\r\nde Vukovi['c] Podkapelski was then placed in command of the fleet, though\r\nthe Sailors' Council at first declined to accept him. He was at heart a\r\npatriot, but had taken no active part in Yugoslav propaganda and, unluckily\r\nfor himself, he had been compelled to accompany Count Tisza in his recent\r\nill-starred tour of Bosnia, when the Magyar leader made a last attempt to\r\nbrowbeat the local Slavs. Yet, as no other high officer was available, Koch\r\ntold the Sailors' Council that they simply must acknowledge Vukovi['c], and\r\nat 4 p.m. he took over the command, the Yugoslav flag being hoisted on all\r\nthe vessels simultaneously, to the accompaniment of the Croatian national\r\nanthem and the firing of salutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE \"VIRIBUS UNITIS\"\r\n\r\nThree hours previously to this a torpedo-boat, with Paolucci and\r\nRossetti on board, had sailed from Venice; and at ten o'clock in the\r\nevening, as Paolucci tells us,[4] he and his companion, after a certain\r\namount of embracing, handshaking, saluting and loyal exclamations,\r\nplunged into the water. The first obstacle was a wooden pier upon which\r\nsentries were marching to and fro; this was safely passed by means of\r\ntwo hats shaped like bottles, which Paolucci and Rossetti now put on.\r\nThe bombs were submerged, and thus the sentry saw nothing but a couple\r\nof bottles being tossed about by the waves. A row of wooden beams,\r\nbearing a thin electric wire, had then to be negotiated, and the last\r\nobstacle consisted of half a dozen steel nets which had laboriously to\r\nbe disconnected from the cables which held them. It was now nearly six\r\no'clock; the two men cautiously approached the _Viribus Unitis_ and\r\nfixed one of their bombs just below the water-line, underneath the\r\nladder conducting to the deck. Paolucci simply records, without comment,\r\nthat the ship was illuminated; perhaps he and his friend were too tired\r\nto make the obvious deduction that the hourly-expected end of the War\r\nhad really arrived. A number of officers from other ships had remained\r\non the _Viribus Unitis_ after the previous evening's ceremony; but the\r\nlook-out, seeing the Italians in the water, must have thought it was\r\neccentric of them to come swimming out at this hour to join in the\r\nfestivities. A motor-launch soon picked them up and they were brought on\r\nboard the flag-ship. \"Viva l'Italia!\" they shouted, for they were proud\r\nof dying for their country. \"Viva l'Italia!\" replied some of the crew to\r\nthis pair of allied officers. When they were conducted to Captain\r\nVukovi['c] they told him that his vessel would in a short time be blown\r\nup. The order was given to abandon ship, and Paolucci and his friend\r\nrelate[5] that when they asked the captain if they might also try to\r\nsave themselves he shook them both by the hand, saying that they were\r\nbrave men and that they deserved to live. So they plunged into the water\r\nand swam rapidly away, but a few minutes later they were picked up by a\r\nlaunch and taken back, the captain having suddenly begun to suspect,\r\nthey said, that the story of the bomb was untrue. They were again made\r\nto walk up the ladder, under which lay the explosives. It was then 6.28.\r\nThe ladder was crowded with sailors who were also returning to their\r\nship. \"Run, run for your lives,\" shouted Paolucci. At last his foot\r\ntouched the deck, and then he and Rossetti ran as fast as they could to\r\nthe stern. Hardly had they got there than a terrific explosion rent the\r\nair, and a column of water shot three hundred feet straight up into the\r\nsky. Paolucci and Rossetti were again in the water, and looking back\r\nthey saw a man scramble up the side of the vessel, which had now turned\r\ncompletely over, with her keel uppermost. There on the keel stood this\r\nman, with folded arms. It was Vukovi['c], who had insisted on going down\r\nwith his ship. About fifty other men were killed.\r\n\r\nWhen Koch came out of his house, feeling that there must be no more\r\ndelay in sending the radiogram to President Wilson, a young Italian\r\nSocialist ran up to him in the street and told him of the fate of the\r\nflagship. As the news spread everyone thought it must be the work of\r\nsome Austrian officers. It was feared that they would explode the\r\narsenal, and that would have meant the destruction of the whole town.\r\nAmid the uproar and chaos, Koch had placards distributed, saying that\r\nthe _Viribus Unitis_ had been torpedoed by two Italians, who were in\r\ncustody. And then the wireless was sent to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe two officers were taken to the Admiralty and then placed on the\r\ndreadnought _Prince Eugene_, it being rumoured that the Italians of Pola\r\nintended to rescue them. Subsequently Koch and other officers, together\r\nwith Dr. Stani['c], President of the Italian National Council, went out\r\nto see the prisoners. Stani['c] was left alone with them for as long as\r\nhe wished. And when Koch saw them--he did not then shake hands--and\r\nasked if they knew what they had done, \"I know it,\" replied Rossetti\r\nrather arrogantly. Paolucci's demeanour was more modest.\r\n\r\n\"I was your friend all through the War,\" said Koch, \"and now you sink\r\nour ships. I can only assume that you were ignorant of what had taken\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nThey said that that was so.\r\n\r\n\"But if you had known,\" said the Admiral to Rossetti, \"would you have\r\ndone this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I am an officer. I had my orders to blow up the\r\nship and I would have obeyed them.\"\r\n\r\nKoch had undertaken that if it turned out that they were unaware of the\r\nship's transference to the Yugoslavs he would kiss them both. He did so,\r\nand allowed them to communicate with Italy by wireless.\r\n\r\nNever, says Koch, will the unpleasant taste of those kisses leave his\r\nmouth. The men were officers; their words could not be doubted. But as\r\nthey must surely have been in Venice for at least a day or two before\r\nOctober 31, it seems extraordinary that they did not hear, via Triest,\r\nof what the Emperor Charles was doing with his navy. If only they had\r\nperfected their invention and learned to swim a trifle sooner there\r\nwould be no shadow cast on their achievement, but the Yugoslavs--who had\r\nnever seen any sort of Italian naval attack on Pola during the\r\nWar--could not be blamed for thinking that the disappearance of their\r\n_Viribus Unitis_ would be viewed with equanimity by the Italians....\r\nWith regard to the other vessels, it was arranged in Paris that they\r\nshould proceed, under the white flag, to Corfu with Yugoslav commanders;\r\nbut this was found impossible, as they were undermanned. Part of the\r\nfleet arrived at Kotor and was placed at the disposal of the commander\r\nof the Yugoslav detachment of the Allied forces which had come from\r\nMacedonia. A serious episode occurred at Pola, where on November 5 an\r\nItalian squadron arrived and demanded the surrender of the ships. The\r\nYugoslav commander succeeded in sending by wireless a strong protest to\r\nParis against this barefaced violation of the agreement. The Italian\r\ncommander, Admiral Cagni, likewise sent a protest, but Clemenceau upheld\r\nthe Yugoslavs. They were absolutely masters of the ex-Austro-Hungarian\r\nfleet; it rested solely with them either to sink it or hand it over to\r\nthe Allies in good condition. The Yugoslavs did not sink the fleet,\r\nbecause they wished to show their loyalty to, and confidence in, the\r\njustice of the Allies. They never suspected at that time that the ships\r\nwould not be shared at least equally between themselves and the\r\nItalians. But in December 1919 the Supreme Council in Paris allotted to\r\nthe Yugoslavs twelve disarmed torpedo-boats for policing and patrolling\r\ntheir coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE ITALIANS LANDED AT POLA\r\n\r\nAdmiral Cagni was invited by the Yugoslavs to enter the harbour of Pola.\r\nBut for two and a half days he hesitated outside and heavily bombarded\r\nthe hill-fortress of Barbarica, which had been abandoned. At last he\r\nmade up his mind to risk a landing. The Italian girls of Pola, dressed\r\nin white, came down in a procession to the port; their arms were full of\r\nflowers for the Italian sailors. And the first men who disembarked were\r\nburied in flowers and kissed and kissed before the girls perceived that,\r\nby a prudent Italian arrangement, this advance guard consisted of men of\r\nthe Czecho-Slovak Legion. The first care of the Italians at Pola was not\r\nto ascertain the whereabouts of the munition depots; they made for the\r\nnaval museum, where trophies from the battle of Vis in 1866 were\r\npreserved. These they removed, as well as whatever took their fancy at\r\nthe Arsenal. Among their booty was a silver dinner service which it had\r\nbeen customary to use on occasions of Imperial visits. An Italian\r\nofficer appeared on the _Radetzky_. Very roughly he asked an officer who\r\nhe was. \"I am the commander,\" said this first-lieutenant. \"No! no!\" said\r\nthe other, \"I am that.\" But the Italians for the most part avoided going\r\non board the ships.... Admiral Cagni himself was very ill at ease, but\r\ngrew noticeably more confident as he observed the utter demoralization\r\nof Pola. His correspondence likewise underwent the appropriate changes.\r\nWhile Koch was in command of 45,000 men, Cagni wrote to \"His Excellency\r\nthe most illustrious Signor Ammiraglio\"; when the numbers were reduced\r\nto 20,000 the style of address was \"Illustrious Signor Ammiraglio\"; when\r\nthey fell to 10,000 it became \"Al Signor Ammiraglio\"; when only 5000\r\nremained a letter began with the word \"Ammiraglio!\" and when the last\r\nman had left Pola and Koch was alone, Cagni sent word through his\r\nadjutant that he knew no Admiral Koch but merely a Signor Koch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA-FARING YUGOSLAVS\r\n\r\nTalking of numbers, one may mention that the Yugoslavs formed about 65\r\nper cent. of the Austro-Hungarian navy, as one would naturally expect\r\nfrom the sea-faring population of Dalmatia and Istria. In the technical\r\nbranches of the service only about 40 per cent. were Yugoslavs, for a\r\npreference was given to Germans and Magyars. Out of 116 chief engineers\r\nonly two were Yugoslavs. Serbo-Croat was an obligatory language; but\r\nGerman, as in the army, was the language of command. Thus one sees that,\r\nin spite of not being favoured, the Yugoslavs of the Adriatic, who are\r\nnatural sailors, constituted more than half the personnel of the navy.\r\n\"These Slav people,\" writes Mr. Hilaire Belloc,[6] who took the trouble\r\nto go to the Adriatic with a view to solving the local problems, \"these\r\nSlav people have only tentatively approached the sea. Its traffic was\r\nnever native to them.\" If he had continued a little way down the coast\r\nhe would have seen many and many a neat little house whose owners are\r\nretired sea-captains. \"They are not mariners,\" says Mr. Belloc. If he\r\nhad made a small excursion into history he would have learned that\r\nVenice--since it was to her own advantage--made an exception of\r\nDalmatia's shipping industry, and while she was placing obstacles along\r\nthe roads that a Dalmatian might wish to take, allowed the time-honoured\r\nindustries of the sea to be developed. Such fine sailors were the\r\nDalmatians that Benedetto Pesaro, the Venetian Admiral against the Turks\r\nin the fifteenth century, deplored the fact that his galleys were not\r\nfully manned by them, instead of those \"Lombardi\" whom he despised.\r\n\"They are,\" says Mr. John Leyland,[7] the naval authority--they are\r\n\"pre-eminently a maritime race. The circumstances of their geography,\r\nand in a chief degree the wonderful configuration of their coast-line,\r\nwith its sheltered waters and admirable anchorages, made them\r\nsea-farers.... The proud Venetians knew them as pirates and marauders\r\nlong ago.\" And \"there has never been a better seaman,\" adds Mr. Leyland,\r\n\"than the pirate turned trader.\" In 1780 the island of Bra[vc] had forty\r\nvessels, Lussin a hundred, and Kotor, which in the second half of the\r\neighteenth century quadrupled her mercantile marine, had a much larger\r\nfleet than either of them. The best-known dockyards were those at\r\nKor[vc]ula and Trogir, while the great Overseas Sailing Ship Navigation\r\nCompany at Peljesac (Sabioncello) occupied an important position in the\r\nworld of trade. The company's fleet of large sailing vessels was of\r\nnative construction; both crews and captains were natives of the\r\ncountry, so that it was in every way the best representative of the\r\nDalmatian mercantile marine of the period. When the Treaty of Vienna in\r\n1815 gave Venice, Istria and the Eastern Adriatic to the Habsburgs the\r\nvessels plying in those waters were very largely Slav. And with the\r\nsubstitution of steam the Dalmatians are still holding their own, with\r\nthis difference, that the ships are now built, even as they are manned,\r\nnot by nobles and the wealthy _bourgeoisie_, but by men who come from\r\nmodest sea-faring or peasant families. In the Austrian mercantile marine\r\nGerman capital formed 47.82 per cent., Italian capital 19.37 per cent.\r\nand Slav capital 31.80 per cent. One of these Dalmatian Slavs,\r\nMihanovi['c], going out in poverty to the Argentine, has followed with\r\nsuch success the shipbuilding of his ancestors that he is now among the\r\nchief millionaires of Buenos Aires. With regard to fishing, there are\r\nalong the Istrian and Dalmatian coast more than 5000 small vessels which\r\ngive employment to 19,000 fishermen, of whom only 1000 are citizens of\r\nItaly. But Mr. Belloc says that these Slav people have only tentatively\r\napproached the sea, that its traffic was never native to them, and that\r\nthey are not mariners. It is marvellous that you can be paid for writing\r\nthat sort of stuff.... By Mr. Belloc's side is the Marchese Donghi, who\r\nin the _Fortnightly Review_ of June 1922 says: \"It is superfluous to add\r\nthat everything which has to do with navigation [in Dalmatia] is\r\nentirely in the hands of the Italians.\" But I think it is superfluous to\r\ncontradict a gentleman who ingenuously believes that Dalmatia is largely\r\nItalian because on our maps we have hitherto used Italian place-names.\r\nWill he say that the population of Praha is not Czech because on our\r\nmaps that capital is commonly called Prague? It pleases the Marchese to\r\nbe facetious about what he describes as \"that queer thing called the\r\nSrba Hrvata i Slovenca Kralji (Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and\r\nSlovenes)\"; he should have said \"Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca.\"\r\nHe says that in Serbia \"no industry is possible,\" whereas in one single\r\ntown, Lescovac, there are no less than eleven textile besides other\r\nfactories. He says that one-third of the population of Dalmatia is\r\nItalian, and \"almost exclusively the nobility and the upper\r\n_bourgeoisie_.\" I suppose that is why more than 700 of Dalmatia's\r\nleading citizens were deported by the Italians after the Great War. He\r\nsays many other nonsensical things, and sums it all up by telling us of\r\nthe \"bewildered incomprehension\" of the Adriatic problem!\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO SET A STANDARD THAT WAS TOO HIGH\r\n\r\nWhether rightly or wrongly, the Yugoslavs had formed their opinion of\r\nthe Italian sailors, an opinion which dated from the time of Tegetthoff\r\nand had not undergone much modification by the incidents of this War.\r\nThey remembered what had happened when they cruised outside Italian\r\nports; they knew very probably that the British had on more than one\r\noccasion to break through the boom outside Taranto harbour, and they may\r\nhave read[8] of the experience of some French ladies who came to the\r\nAlbanian coast on the _Citta di Bari_ towards the end of 1915 with 2000\r\nkilos of milk, clothing and medical supplies for the Serbian children\r\nwho had struggled across the mountains. These ladies write that after\r\nthe torpedoing of the _Brindisi_ their own crew ran up and down without\r\nappearing to see them; the crew had life-belts, those of the ladies were\r\ntaken away. Ultimately they succeeded in having themselves put ashore,\r\nand the _Citta di Bari_ fled in the night without landing the stores.\r\nAnd in Albania, the ladies say, one witnessed the \"stoic endurance of\r\nthe noble Serbian race, of which every day brought us more examples. In\r\nthat procession of ghosts and of the dying there was no imploring look,\r\nthere was no hand stretched out to beg.\" ... The Yugoslavs may have\r\nknown what happened to Lieutenant (now Captain) Binnos de Pombara of the\r\nFrench navy. This officer, in command of the _Fourche_, had been\r\nescorting the _Citta di Messina_ and, observing that she was torpedoed,\r\nhad sent to her, perhaps a little imprudently, all his life-boats and\r\nbelts. A few minutes later, when he was himself torpedoed, the Italians\r\ndid not see him; anyhow they made for the shore. De Pombara encouraged\r\nhis men by causing them to sing the Marseillaise and so forth; they\r\nwere in the water, clinging to the wreckage, for several hours, until\r\nanother boat came past. The next day at Brindisi, when he met the\r\ncaptain of the _Citta di Messina_, this gentleman once more did not see\r\nhim; but the French Government, although de Pombara was a very young\r\nman, created him an officer of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRICAL ATMOSPHERE AND NO PRECAUTIONS\r\n\r\nThere was thus a certain amount of tension existing between the military\r\nand naval services of the Yugoslavs and those of Italy. Other Yugoslavs\r\nwere apprehensive as to whether the Italians would not demand the\r\nenforcement of the Treaty of London. But the United States was not bound\r\nby that agreement, which was so completely at variance with Wilson's\r\nprinciple of self-determination. One presumed that, pending an\r\nexamination of these matters, the disputed territories would be occupied\r\nby troops of all the Allies. But unfortunately this did not turn out to\r\nbe the case. France, Britain and America stood by, while the Italians\r\nand the Yugoslavs took whatsoever they could lay their hands on. As the\r\nYugoslav military forces had to come overland, while the Italians had\r\ncommand of the sea, it was natural that in most places the Italians got\r\nthe better of the scramble; and where they found the Yugoslavs in\r\npossession, as at Rieka, they usually ousted them by diplomatic methods.\r\nAnd in one way or another they managed to make their holdings tally, as\r\nfar as possible, with the Treaty of London, and even to go beyond it.\r\nBaron Sonnino declined to make a comprehensive statement as to the\r\nItalian programme. Of course he desired in the end to exchange\r\nDalmatia--the seizure of which would entail a war with Yugoslavia--against\r\nRieka. But as Italian public opinion had scarcely thought of Rieka\r\nduring the War, he made it his business to cause them to yearn for that\r\ntown. His compatriots were asking why Mr. Wilson's Fourteen Points\r\nshould be waived for France in the Sarre Basin, for Britain in Ireland\r\nand Egypt, but not for them. And some of his would-be ingenious\r\ncompatriots pointed out--their contentions were embodied in the Italian\r\nMemorandum to the Supreme Council on January 10, 1920--that as the\r\nTreaty of London was based on the presumption that Montenegro, Serbia\r\nand Croatia would remain separate States, this instrument had been\r\naltogether upset by the merging of those Southern Slavs into one\r\ncountry, Yugoslavia; it followed, therefore, that the Treaty which\r\nattributed Rieka to the Croats could no longer be invoked. But the other\r\nparts of the Treaty which gave the Slav mainland and islands to Italy\r\nwere absolutely unassailable. The reader will resent being troubled by\r\nthis kind of balderdash, but Messrs. Clemenceau, Lloyd-George and Wilson\r\nmay have resented it even more.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN MILDNESS ON THE ISLE OF VIS\r\n\r\nOn November 3 the Italians arrived outside Vis (Lissa), the most\r\nwesterly of the large islands, where the entire population of 11,000 is\r\nSlav, except for the family of an honoured inhabitant, Dr. Doimi, and\r\nthree other families related to his. Dr. Doimi's people have lived for\r\nmany years on this island--his father was mayor of the capital, which is\r\nalso called Vis, for half a century--and now they have become so\r\nacclimatized that, as he told me, three of his four nephews prefer to\r\ncall themselves Yugoslavs. This phenomenon can be seen all down the\r\nAdriatic coast. It has often, for example, been pointed out to Dr. Vio,\r\nthe very Italian ex-mayor of Rieka, that he has a Croat father and\r\nseveral Croat brothers. Thus also the Duimi['c] family of the same town\r\nhas one brother married to a Magyar lady and very fond of the Magyars, a\r\nsecond brother who is a Professor at Milan, and a third who lives above\r\nRieka and is a Yugoslav. The terms \"Yugoslav\" and \"Italian\" have now\r\ncome to signify not what a man is, but what he wants to be, applying\r\nthus the admirable principle of self-determination. Well, in the old\r\ndays on the isle of Vis between two and three hundred people belonged to\r\nthe Autonomist party, owing to their great regard for Dr. Doimi; but\r\nthese say now that they are Yugoslavs, and the Italians--at all events\r\nCaptain Sportiello, their chief officer at Vis--acknowledged that they\r\nmust base their demand on strategic reasons. A day or two before the\r\nItalians arrived the population had arrested several Austrian\r\nfunctionaries, including the mayor and three gendarmes, who had\r\nmaltreated them during the War. None of these persons were Italian; and\r\nwhen the Italian boats were sighted a committee went to meet them\r\njoyfully and brought the officers ashore upon their backs. The officers\r\nexplained that they had come as representatives of the Entente and the\r\nUnited States, and for the object--which appeared superfluous--of\r\nprotecting Vis from German submarines. If the Italians had been\r\neverywhere as inoffensive as at Vis, it would be more agreeable to write\r\nabout their doings. Captain Sportiello, a naval officer, showed himself\r\nthroughout the months of his administration to be sensible; he\r\nfrequented Yugoslav houses. The greatest divergence occurred on June 1,\r\n1919, when the Italians planned to have a demonstration for their\r\nnational holiday, and asked the inhabitants to come to the bioscope,\r\nwhere they would be regaled with cakes and sweets; the inhabitants\r\nreplied that they preferred to have Yugoslavia.... But there is a\r\nmonument in the cemetery at Vis to which I must refer. It is a very fine\r\nmonument of white marble, erected by the Austrians to commemorate their\r\nvictory in these waters over the Italian navy in 1866.[9] On the top\r\nthere is a lion clutching the Italian flag, while on two of the sides\r\nthere are inscriptions in the German language. One of them, some feet in\r\nlength, relates that this memorial is placed there for the officers and\r\nmen who on July 20, 1866, gave their lives in the service of their\r\nEmperor and country. The Italians screwed two marble slabs across the\r\nupper and the lower parts of this inscription, so that the German\r\nlettering of the central part remained visible; on the lower slab one\r\nread: \"Novembre 1918\" and on the upper one \"Italia Vincitrice\"\r\n(Victorious Italy). We were taken by several Italian officers to look\r\nat this. They were so proud of it that they presented us with\r\nphotographs of the monument in its altered state. I fear that the\r\nItalian mentality escapes me. I should not have written anything about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR TRUCULENCE AT KOR[vC]ULA\r\n\r\nThey landed on the same day, November 3, on the beautiful and prosperous\r\nisland of Kor[vc]ula (Curzola), putting ashore at Velaluka, the western\r\nharbour. With the exception of five families, all the people are\r\nYugoslavs; and the Italians, who sailed in under a white flag, announced\r\nthat they had come as friends of the Yugoslavs and of the Entente, to\r\npreserve order and to protect them against submarines. On the 5th, they\r\nwent to the town of Kor[vc]ula, where one of the two officers,\r\nLieutenant Poggi, of the navy, put his assurances in writing, as he had\r\ndone at Velaluka. He protested against the word \"Occupation.\" On the 7th\r\nthey returned to Velaluka and on the 12th went back, with about a\r\nhundred men, to Kor[vc]ula. Once more he wrote that he had not come to\r\noccupy the island; he added, though, that the district officials should\r\nact on the opposite peninsula of Sabioncello in the name of the\r\nYugoslavs, but over Kor[vc]ula and the island of Lastovo (Lagosta) in\r\nthe name of Italy--not of the Entente. He wanted to remove the Yugoslav\r\nflags from public buildings and substitute Italian flags. When he was\r\nreminded of what he had said with regard to the Entente, he exclaimed:\r\n\"No, no! This is Italy!\" The chief district official protested, and\r\nrefused to carry out Lieut. Poggi's injunctions, nor were the Italians\r\nable to do so. This officer remained at Kor[vc]ula, requisitioning\r\nhouses and hoisting as many Italian flags as he could. He issued an\r\norder that after 6.30 p.m. not more than three persons were allowed to\r\ncome together in the streets. His men used to offer food to the women of\r\nthe place, who declined it; after which the food was given to the\r\nchildren, who were previously photographed in an imploring attitude.\r\nThere was some trouble on December 15 when the _Leonidas_, an American\r\nship, came in with a number of mine-sweepers. Apparently the Yugoslavs\r\ncontravened the Italian regulations by omitting to ask whether their\r\nband might play in the harbour, but, on the supposition that this would\r\nnot be accorded to them, went down to the harbour just as if they were\r\nnot living under regulations. They waved American, Serbian and Croatian\r\nflags, all of which the Italians attempted to seize; the most gorgeous\r\none, a Yugoslav flag of silk with gilt fringes, they tore up and divided\r\namong themselves as a trophy. When the _Leonidas_ made fast, a\r\nlieutenant leaped ashore and placed himself, holding a revolver, in\r\nfront of an American flag. The captain, according to some reports, had\r\nhis men standing to their guns, while others of the crew are said to\r\nhave been given hand-grenades; but whether by this method or another,\r\nthe turbulence on shore was calmed and the Italians seem to have invited\r\nthe captain to step off his boat. He preferred, however, to go to\r\nanother port; the populace came overland. One need not say that there\r\nwas jollification.... When the other American boats departed, a small\r\none remained at Kor[vc]ula. One day a steamer came from Metkovi['c],\r\nhaving on board a few men of the Yugoslav Legion. The people of\r\nKor[vc]ula, not being allowed to take the men to their houses, came down\r\nquietly to the harbour with coffee and bread, but the carabinieri drove\r\nthem away. These legionaries were emigrants to Australia and Canada, who\r\nhad come back to fight for the Entente, including Italy. The Italians\r\nwanted to arrest them all on account of a small Croatian flag which one\r\nof them was holding, but at the request of the American ship they\r\nrefrained. A certain Marko [vS]imunovi['c], who had gone to Australia\r\nfrom the Kor[vc]ula village of Ra[vc]i[vs]ca, went over to speak to the\r\nsailors on the American boat. Because of this the carabinieri took him\r\nto the military headquarters. He was interned for several months in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe long island of Hvar (Lesina) was not occupied until November 13. It\r\nis interesting, by the by, to note how this island came to have its\r\nnames. In the time of the Greek colonists it was known as [Greek: ho\r\npharos], which subsequently became Farra or Quarra, leading to the name\r\nHvar, by which it is known to the Slavs. They also, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, gave it an alternative name: Lesna, from the Slav word\r\nsignifying \"wooded,\" for the Venetians had not yet despoiled the island\r\nof many of its forests. Lesna was the popular and Hvar the literary\r\nname; and the Italians, taking the former of these, coined the word\r\nLesina, the sound of which makes many of them and of other people think\r\nthat this is an Italian island.[10] The question of Slav and Italian\r\ngeographical names in Dalmatia has been carefully investigated by a\r\nstudent at Split. Taking the zone which was made over to the Italians by\r\nthe Treaty of London, he found that with the exception of a reef called\r\nMaon, alongside the island of Pago, every island, village, mountain and\r\nriver has a Slav name, whereas out of the total of 114 names there were\r\n64 which have no names in Italian; and this is giving the Italians\r\ncredit for such words as Sebenico, Zemonico and so forth, which in the\r\nopinion of philologists are merely modifications of the original\r\n[vS]ibenik, Zemunik, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND ON HVAR\r\n\r\nAt Starigrad on Hvar the Italians also said that they were\r\nrepresentatives of the Entente, but soon they prohibited the national\r\ncolours. Being perhaps aware that in the whole island, with its\r\npopulation of about 20,000, there were before the War only four or five\r\nItalians who were engaged in selling fruit, their countrymen in November\r\n1918 did their best, by the distribution of other commodities--rice,\r\nflour and macaroni--to make some more Italians. They succeeded at\r\nStarigrad in obtaining fifteen or twenty recruits. And they made it\r\nobvious that it would be more comfortable to be an Italian than a\r\nYugoslav. The local Reading-Rooms, whose committee had received no\r\nprevious warning, fell so greatly under the displeasure of the Italians\r\nthat one night after ten o'clock--at which time curfew sounded for the\r\nYugoslavs; the Italians and their friends could stay out until any\r\nhour--the premises were sacked: knives were used against the pictures,\r\nfurniture was taken by assault, and mirrors did not long resist the\r\nfine elan of the attacking party. Old vases, other ornaments and books\r\nwere thrown into the harbour near the _Sirio_, the Italian destroyer\r\nwhich was anchored ten yards from the Reading-Rooms. Of course there was\r\nan inquiry; the result of it was that several Yugoslavs (and no others)\r\nwere imprisoned. The _Sirio's_ commander was a gentleman of some\r\nactivity; he sent a telegram to Rome and another one to Admiral Millo,\r\nthe Italian Governor of the occupied parts of Dalmatia, saying that the\r\npeople of the island longed for annexation. These telegrams he read\r\naloud before the islanders, with all his carabinieri in attendance....\r\nThe old-world capital of the island, which is a smaller place than\r\nStarigrad, was occupied on the same day. The first serious encounter\r\ntook place on December 4, when the Italians, who were quartered on the\r\nupper floor of the Sokol or gymnastic club, observed that furniture was\r\nbeing taken from the rooms below them and was being carried out into the\r\nstreet. If they had asked the people what they were about they would\r\nhave heard that these things had been stored in the gymnasium during the\r\nWar and that the place was now to be devoted to its original purpose.\r\nWhat they did was to believe at once the yarn of a renegade, who told\r\nthem that the people were preparing to blow up the house. The Italians\r\nopened fire, wounded several persons and killed one of their own\r\ncarabinieri.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY WERE RECEIVED AT ZADAR\r\n\r\nOn the mainland the Italians were received at [vS]ibenik with some\r\nsuspicion. They announced, however, that they came as representatives of\r\nthe Allies, and begged for a pilot who would take them into [vS]ibenik's\r\nland-locked harbour, through the mine-field. The Yugoslavs consented,\r\nand after the Italians had installed themselves they requisitioned sixty\r\nAustrian merchant vessels which were lying in that harbour. (They left,\r\nas a matter of fact, to the Yugoslavs out of all the ex-Austrian\r\nmercantile fleet exactly four old boats--_Sebenico_, _Lussin_, _Mossor_\r\nand _Dinara_--with a total displacement of 390 tons.) On the other\r\nhand, at Zadar, they were received in a very friendly fashion. In this\r\ntown, as it had been the seat of government, with numerous officials and\r\ntheir families, the Autonomist anti-Croat party had been, under Austria,\r\nmore powerful than in any other town in Dalmatia. With converts coming\r\nin from the country, which is entirely Slav, the Autonomists in Zadar\r\nhad become well over half the population,[11] which is about 14,000,\r\nthat of the surrounding district being about 23,000. Zadar was thus a\r\nplace apart from the rest of Dalmatia, and although the Dalmatian\r\nAutonomists were unable to claim any of the eleven deputies who went to\r\nVienna, they managed to be represented in the provincial Chamber--the\r\nLandtag--by six out of the forty-one members. The Landtag was not\r\nelected on the basis of universal suffrage; four out of these six\r\nmembers were chosen by large landowners, one (Dr. Ziliotto, the mayor)\r\nby the town of Zadar and one by the Zadar chamber of commerce. Out of\r\nthe eighty-six communes of Dalmatia, Zadar was the solitary one that was\r\nAutonomist. Some very few Autonomists were wont to say that they aspired\r\nto union with Italy, but it was generally thought that most of them\r\nagreed with Dr. Ziliotto when he said in the Landtag in 1906: \"We,\r\nseparated from Italy by the whole Adriatic--we a few thousand men,\r\nscattered, with no territorial links, among a population not of hundreds\r\nof thousands but of millions of Slavs, how could we think of union with\r\nItaly?\" And Dr. Ziliotto was one of those who always regarded himself as\r\nan Italian. But whether the Zadar Autonomists were sincere or not when\r\nAustria ruled over them, the large majority of them hung out Italian\r\ncolours after the War, and in this they were undoubtedly sincere,\r\nalthough the motives varied; in some it was the love of Italy, in some\r\nit was ambition and in some a thirst for vengeance.\r\n\r\n[Although both Yugoslavs and Italians criticize the Austrian figures, it\r\nis probable that they are pretty accurate. The census of 1910 gave for\r\nDalmatia: 610,669 Serbo-Croats, 18,028 Italians, 3081 Germans and 1410\r\nCzecho-Slovaks. The Autonomist party claimed that they were not 18,028\r\nbut 30,000; and that 150,000 persons in Dalmatia speak Italian. But the\r\nOrlando-Sonnino Government really did try its utmost to improve these\r\nfigures. At the end of November 1918 the Italians, who had charge of the\r\npolice at Constantinople, put up notices asking all Austrian subjects\r\nfrom Dalmatia to inscribe themselves with the authorities and thus\r\nreceive protection. In addition to the ordinary large Yugoslav\r\npopulation, the Austrian army was still there, and two of its officers,\r\nin uniform, inscribed themselves. The Italians had to endure not a few\r\nrebuffs, for they applied to people at their houses--they had found the\r\nnationality lists at the police offices. The Dutch were looking after\r\nYugoslav interests, but received no instructions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THEY DID THERE\r\n\r\nIt was thought at Zadar that the Italians would be followed in the\r\ncourse of days by the other Allies. Anyhow the Yugoslavs were in no\r\ncarping spirit; about 5000 of them assembled to greet the Italian\r\ndestroyer; they were, in fact, more numerous than the Italians. And\r\nperhaps one should record that on this memorable occasion--it was at an\r\nearly hour--Dr. Ziliotto had to complete his toilette as he ran down to\r\nthe quay. Soon the Italian captain, shouldered by the crowd, was\r\nflourishing two flags, the Italian and the Yugoslav--although his\r\ncountry had, of course, not recognized Yugoslavia. For a little time it\r\nwas the colour of roses, and the worm that crept into this paradise\r\nseems to have been a Japanese warship in whose presence each of the two\r\nparties wished to demonstrate how powerful it was. The carabinieri\r\nresolved to maintain order, and as an inmate of the seminary made, they\r\nsaid, an unpolished gesture at them from a window they went off and,\r\nwith some reinforcements, broke into the Slav Reading-Room and damaged\r\nit considerably. The Italian officers and men at Zadar went about their\r\nduties for some time without permitting themselves to be drawn into\r\nlocal politics, but they were told repeatedly that the Slavs are goats\r\nand barbarians, so that at last the men appear to have concluded that\r\nstrong measures were required. Some of them mingled, in civilian\r\nclothes, with the unruly elements, and Zadar's narrow streets became\r\nmost hazardous for Yugoslav pedestrians. Girls and men alike were\r\nroughly handled; thrice in one day, for example, a professor--Dr.\r\nStoikevi['c]--had his ears boxed as he went to or was coming from his\r\nschool. Yet Zadar is a dignified old place; the chief men of the town\r\nand the Italian officers did what they could to keep it so. But away\r\nfrom their control some deeds of truculence occurred. The prison\r\nwarders, as the spirit moved them, forced the Slavs there to be quiet,\r\nor to shout \"Viva Italia!\" Most of the Slavs were in the gaol for having\r\nhad in their possession Austrian paper money stamped by the Yugoslav\r\nauthorities; these notes were subsequently declared by the Italians to\r\nbe illegal; but if a man came from Croatia, for example, and had\r\nnothing else, it was a trifle harsh to lock him up and confiscate the\r\nmoney. Eight good people went to Zadar prison owing to the fact that\r\nnear the ancient town of Biograd they had been sitting underneath the\r\nolive trees and singing Croat folk-songs. Nor was it much in keeping\r\nwith Zadar's dignity when the \"Ufficio Propaganda\" put out a large red\r\nplacard which invited boys between the ages of nine and seventeen to\r\njoin in establishing a \"Corpo Nazionale dei giovani esploratori\"--that\r\nis to say, an association of boy scouts. It is superfluous to inquire as\r\nto why these boys were mustered.... When the Austrians collapsed, a few\r\nold rifles were seized by the Italians and the Croats, the latter having\r\nfifteen or twenty which they hid in various villages. A priest and a\r\nmedical student were privy to this fearful crime. A hue and cry was\r\nraised by the carabinieri--the priest vanished, the student jumped out\r\nof a window of his house and also vanished. But the carabinieri would\r\nnot be denied. They suspected that the Albanians of the neighbouring\r\nvillage of Borgo Erizzo were abetting the Slavs. It was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to castigate them. The 2500 inhabitants of Borgo Erizzo,\r\nnearly all of them Albanians who speak their own language and\r\nSerbo-Croat, while 5 per cent. also speak Italian, used to be divided in\r\ntheir sympathies before the War--75 per cent. being adherents of the\r\nSlavs in Zadar and 25 per cent. of the Autonomists. Now they have,\r\nexcepting 5 per cent., gone over to the Slavs, and as they have retained\r\nsome of the habits of their ancestors, they were not going to let the\r\nhostile forces win an easy victory. A student marched in front of the\r\nItalians, then about ten carabinieri, then a few ranks of soldiers, and\r\nthen the mob of Zadar. The Albanians were in two groups, twenty\r\nsheltering behind walls to the right of the road and twenty to the left;\r\nthey were armed with stones, their women folk were bringing them relays\r\nof these. The encounter ended in three carabinieri and seven or eight\r\nsoldiers being wounded. In order to avenge this defeat one Duka, who is\r\nby birth an Albanian and is a teacher at the Italian \"Liga\" school,\r\nwhich was built a few years ago at Borgo Erizzo, determined on the next\r\nafternoon to attack the Teachers' Institute, which is situated 400 steps\r\nfrom his own establishment, and which on the previous day had shown a\r\nstrong defence. He led the attack in person, firing his revolver. But\r\nthe casualties were light. The Teachers' Institute was, after this,\r\noccupied by the military, and Admiral Millo paid a complimentary visit\r\nto Duka at his school.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRETTY DOINGS AT KRK\r\n\r\nProceeding up the Adriatic we come to the Quarnero Islands, of which the\r\nmost considerable is Krk (Veglia). The whole district had, at the last\r\ncensus, 19,562 inhabitants whose ordinary language was Serbo-Croat, and\r\n1544 who commonly spoke Italian. Of these latter the capital, likewise\r\ncalled Krk, contained 1494, and only 644 who gave themselves out as\r\nSlavs. The town, with its tortuous, rather wistful streets, was the\r\nresidence of the Venetian officials, and five or six of those old\r\nfamilies remain. The rest of the 1494 are nearly all Italianized Slavs,\r\nwho under Austria used to call themselves either Austrians of Italian\r\ntongue or else Istrians. However, if they wish to be Italians now, there\r\nis none to say them nay. They include five out of the twenty officials,\r\nand these five gentlemen seem to have boldly said before the War that it\r\nwould please them if this island were to be included in the Kingdom of\r\nItaly. They did not give their Austrian rulers many sleepless nights;\r\nthis confidence in them was justified, for during the War they placed\r\nthemselves in the front rank of those who flung defiant words at Italy,\r\nand one of them enlarged his weapon, copying upon his typewriter some\r\nSongs of Hate, which probably were sent to him from Rieka or Triest.\r\nThese typewritten sheets were then circulated in the island. One of\r\nthem--\"Con le teste degli Italiani\"--had been specially composed for\r\nchildren and expressed the intention of playing bowls with Italian\r\nheads. The songs for adults were less blood-thirsty but not less cruel.\r\nThe Yugoslavs of the island must have been engaged in other War work; no\r\nsongs were provided for them.... When Austria collapsed, some youths\r\ncame from Rieka, flourishing their flags and sticks, and crying, \"Down\r\nwith Austria!\" \"Long live Italy!\" \"Long live Yugoslavia!\" \"Long live\r\nKing Peter!\" There was, in fact general goodwill. A Croat National\r\nCouncil was formed, and was recognized by the Italian party; it\r\nintroduced a censorship, but as the postmaster's allegiance was given to\r\nthe minority he sent a telegram to Triest, asking for bread and\r\nprotection; and on November 15 the _Stocco_ arrived. Other people soon\r\ndeparted; the Bishop's chancellor and his chaplain, two magistrates and\r\na Custom-house official, were shipped off to Italy or Sardinia, while\r\nthe owner of the typewriter flew off as a delegate to Paris, having\r\npersuaded the town council of the capital to vote a sum of 36,000 crowns\r\nfor his expenses--but a crown was now worth less than half a franc.\r\nHowever, two members of the town council thought that it was a waste of\r\nmoney; but when they were threatened with internment in Sardinia they\r\nwithdrew their active opposition, and the delegate set out. On the way\r\nhe granted an interview to an Italian journalist, and depicted the\r\nspontaneous enthusiasm with which the islanders had called for Italy.\r\nBut the journalist had heard of the National Council and he asked, very\r\nnaturally, whether it shared these sentiments. \"Ha parlato da Italiano!\"\r\n(\"I have spoken as an Italian\"), replied the delegate; and when the\r\nnewspaper reached the island, this cryptic saying was interpreted in\r\nvarious ways, his critics pointing out that, as he had diverged from\r\ntruthfulness, this was another little Song of Hate. The Bishop, Dr.\r\nMahni['c],[12] did not go to Italy for several months. He was a learned\r\nSlovene, an ex-Professor of Gorica University, known also as a stern\r\ncritic of any poetry which was not dogmatically religious. He gave vent\r\nto his dislike of the poetry of Gregor[vc]i['c] and A[vs]kerc, both of\r\nthem priests. The former, being of a mild disposition, bowed before the\r\nstorm; but A[vs]kerc wrote a cutting satire on his critic. The\r\nAustrians, disapproving of his religious and patriotic activities,\r\nthought they would smother him by this appointment to a rather\r\nout-of-the-way diocese. But his influence spread far beyond it, and in\r\nthe islands he was so solicitous for the people's material welfare that,\r\nfor example, he founded savings-banks, which were a great success. It\r\nwas unavoidable, as he was a man of character, that he should come into\r\nconflict with the Italians, for their commanding officer, a naval\r\ncaptain of Hungarian origin, was not a suave administrator. He charged a\r\npriest with making Yugoslav propaganda because he catechized the little\r\nchildren in their own language; another priest on the island of Unie,\r\nwhich forms a part of the diocese, was accused of making propaganda,\r\nbecause he has had in his church two statues--which had been there for\r\nyears--of SS. Cyril and Methodus. They were removed from the church, he\r\nput them back; finally he was himself expelled and Unie remained without\r\na priest. The naval captain was irritated by the old Slavonic liturgy,\r\nwhich is used in all except four churches of the diocese, but if he\r\ncould not alter this--Dr. Mahni['c] referring him to the Pope--he and\r\nthe Admiral at Pola, Admiral Cagni, could manage with some trouble to\r\nrid themselves of the bishop. This gentleman, who was in his seventieth\r\nyear and an invalid, said that he would perhaps go to Rome after Easter.\r\nOn March 24 the captain told him that the admiral had settled he should\r\nsail in three days, but the bishop was ill. On the 26th the captain\r\nreturned with a lieutenant of carabinieri to ask if the bishop was still\r\nailing; the admiral, it seemed, had ordered that two other doctors--the\r\nofficer of health for the district and an Italian army doctor--should\r\nverify the report of the bishop's own medical attendant. The three of\r\nthem quarrelled for two hours, but finally they all signed a memorandum\r\nthat the bishop was ill. On the 31st the captain came to say that a\r\ndestroyer would arrive and that it would take the bishop wherever he\r\nwanted to go, for the Italians had made up their minds that go he must.\r\nHe had objected far too vigorously to their methods--not approving, for\r\nexample, of the written permit which was given in the autumn to the\r\npeople of two villages in Krk, on which it stated that these people\r\ncould supply themselves with timber at Grdnje. This was a State forest,\r\nrented by a certain man; but the Italians acknowledged that what they\r\nwanted was adherents, and these grateful villagers, if there should be a\r\nplebiscite, would vote for them. The man appealed to justice, but the\r\njudge received a verbal order not to act. The villagers were given a\r\ngeneral amnesty on January 1, an Italian flag was hoisted at the judge's\r\noffice--the judge had gone away. Another transaction which the bishop\r\nhad resented was after a visit paid by the captain and another officer\r\nof the French warship _Annamite_ to the Yugoslav Reading-Rooms at\r\nLo[vs]inj mali (Lussinpiccolo); a priest and two other gentlemen had\r\nescorted their guests to the harbour at 11 p.m.; during the night all\r\nthree were arrested and the priest deported. When the _Annamite_ put in\r\nat the lofty island of Cres (Cherso) and a couple of officers went to\r\nthe Franciscan monastery, it resulted in the monastery being closed and\r\nthe monks removed. Their simple act of courtesy was, said the Italians,\r\npropaganda. From Lo[vs]inj mali and Cres five ladies were collected,\r\nfour of them being teachers and one the wife of the pilot,\r\nSindi[vc]i['c]. They were guilty of having greeted the French, and on\r\naccount of this were taken to the prison at Pola. Afterwards in Venice\r\nthey were kept for six weeks in the company of prostitutes and from\r\nthere they passed to Sardinia, on which island they were retained for\r\nnine months. As for Dr. Mahni['c], he set sail on April 4 at 6 a.m.\r\nBeing asked whither he would like to go, he said he wished to be put\r\ndown at Zengg on the mainland. \"Excellent,\" said the Italians; but after\r\na few minutes they said they had received a radio from Pola that the\r\nbishop must be taken to Ancona. He was afterwards allowed to live in a\r\nmonastery near Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNHAPPY POLA\r\n\r\nThe Italians had not been two days in Pola--in which arsenal town the\r\npopulation, unlike that of the country, mostly uses the Italian\r\nlanguage--when they made themselves disliked by both parties. The\r\nPresident of the Italian National Council was told by the Admiral that\r\nan Austrian crown was to be worth forty Italian centesimi. This, said\r\nthe Admiral, was an order from Rome. The President explained that this\r\nmeant ruin for the people of the town. He asked if he might telegraph to\r\nRome. \"I am Rome!\" said the Admiral, or words to that effect. Thereupon\r\nthe President and the colleagues who were with him said they would never\r\ncome again to see the Admiral \"If I want you,\" said the Admiral, \"I\r\nwill have you brought by a couple of carabinieri.\" On the next day red\r\nflags were flying on the arsenal and on the day after the Italian troops\r\nwere taken elsewhere, while 10,000 fresh ones came from Italy. And Pola,\r\nin exchange for troops, gave coal. For some time the Italians carried\r\noff two trainloads of it every day. This absence of coal from their own\r\nnative country, which rather places them at the mercy of the\r\ncoal-producing lands, seems to be more their misfortune than anybody's\r\nfault, yet the Italian party of Rieka added this to their grievances\r\nagainst France and Great Britain. Those two countries ought, they said,\r\nin very decency, to correct the oversights of Providence; but no very\r\npractical suggestions were put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ISTRIA ENDURED\r\n\r\nAccording to the Austrian census of 1910 Istria contained 386,740\r\ninhabitants, of whom 218,854 (or 58.5 per cent.) habitually used the\r\nSerbo-Croat language, while 145,552 (or 38.9 per cent.) used Italian.\r\nThe Yugoslavs cannot help regarding the Istrian statistics with\r\nsuspicion, and believing that here, more than in Dalmatia, they were\r\nmade to suffer on account of Austria's alliance with Italy and with the\r\nVatican: one of the wrongs which Strossmayer fought against was that\r\nIstria had been entrusted to an Italian Dalmatian bishop who could not\r\nspeak a word of Slav. This prelate appointed to vacant livings a number\r\nof Italian priests whom the people could not understand; a Slav coming\r\nto confess had to be supplied with an interpreter. As to the statistics\r\nin the commune of Krmed (Carmedo), for example, of the district of Pola,\r\nthe census of 1900 gave 257 Croats against three Italians, whereas in\r\n1910 it was stated that 296 inhabitants spoke habitually Italian and six\r\nspoke Croatian. Nevertheless, if one accepts the Austrian figures, the\r\n58.5 per cent. should not be treated as if they did not exist. Perhaps\r\nthe Italian officials could find no interpreters to translate their\r\nproclamations and decrees; if the Yugoslavs could not read them that was\r\na defect in their education. If they were unable to write to the\r\nauthorities or to send private telegrams in Italian, let them hold\r\ntheir peace. At any rate, said Vice-Admiral Cagni, we will not encourage\r\nthe Croatian language, and on November 16, 1918, he commanded the\r\nYugoslav schools to be shut at eleven places in the district and also\r\ntwo schools in the town. The Austrians had allowed these schools to\r\nremain open during the War; but of course if you wish to prevent people\r\nfrom learning a language this is one of the first steps you would take.\r\nThirteen Yugoslav schoolmasters at Pola were thus deprived of their\r\nmeans of livelihood. The Admiral said that he really did not want to let\r\nmatters remain in this condition, but all these schools had been at the\r\nexpense of the State; let the Yugoslavs support their own schools. They\r\nwere, as a matter of fact, entitled by reason of their numbers to have\r\nState-supported schools. Yet that was, of course, in the time of\r\nAustria; and why should Italy be bound by Austrian laws? Italy would do\r\nwhat she saw fit. In various places the teachers were, in the presence\r\nof Italian officers, compelled to use Italian for the instruction of\r\npurely Yugoslav children. Slav schoolmistresses were, in several cases,\r\ntaken out of bed in the middle of the night and conducted on board\r\nItalian ships. The clergy were ordered to preach in Italian in churches,\r\nsuch as that of Veprinac, where the congregation is almost entirely\r\nSlav[13]--and so on, and so on. Well, there are several ways of\r\ngoverning a mixed population, and this is one of them.... \"Zadar and\r\nRieka,\" said Pribi[vc]evi['c] in November to an Italian interviewer at\r\nZagreb--\"Zadar and Rieka will enjoy all liberty of culture and municipal\r\nautonomy. And we are convinced that an equal treatment will be accorded\r\nto the Slav minorities who will be included in your territory. We\r\nunderstand and perfectly recognize your right to Triest and to Pola, and\r\nwe would that in Italy our right to Rieka and Dalmatia were recognized\r\nwith the same justice.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAMOUS TOWN OF RIEKA\r\n\r\nRieka is a place concerning which a good deal has been written, but I\r\ndoubt if there have been two words more striking than the phrase which\r\nthe Consiglio Nazionale Italiano applies in a pamphlet to the last\r\nHungarian Governor. This official, appreciating that his presence in the\r\ntown would serve no useful end, dissolved the State police on October\r\n28, 1918, and departed. \"Hote insalue, il disparut....\" says the\r\npamphlet. After all the years of kindness, all the million favours\r\nshowered on the Autonomists by their beloved friends the Magyars, after\r\nall the dark electioneering tricks and gutter legislation which for\r\nyears had been committed by the Magyars to the end that the Autonomists\r\nand they should have all the amenities of some one else's house, it\r\nsurely is the acme of ingratitude to call this tottering benefactor\r\n\"Hote insalue.\" If the Autonomists did not desire to reap advantages\r\nfrom any Magyar corruption, they might at any time since November 17,\r\n1868, have torn the swindling piece of paper, the \"krpitsa,\" from the\r\nAgreement made between the Magyars and the Croats. Then the Croat would\r\nnot have been kept for all these years a slave in his own home.... But\r\non October 28, 1918, the \"krpitsa\" had no more weight, the iniquitous\r\nAgreement was obsolete, the Croats came into possession of their own.\r\nThe Compromise of 1868, which gave the administration of Rieka\r\nprovisionally to the Magyars, was formally denounced on October 29, so\r\nthat the _status quo ante_ returned, and Rieka was again an integral\r\npart of the Kingdom of Croatia. The Croatian Government (that is, the\r\nNational Council) had then every right to depute its adherents at Rieka\r\nto undertake the affairs of that town. Dr. Vio was too much of a lawyer\r\nto dispute the legality of any of these statements....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMA BEGINS\r\n\r\nSome of the leading citizens of Rieka formed themselves into a Croat\r\nNational Council; Dr. Bakar[vc]i['c] and Dr. Lenac went up to the\r\nGovernor's palace, and with them went Dr. Vio, as delegate of the town\r\ncouncil. He said they recognized the Croatian Government, on condition\r\nthat the town's municipal autonomy was guaranteed. To this they readily\r\nconsented, with respect to the Italian language, to their schools and to\r\nthe existing town administration, thus agreeing to every suggestion\r\nwhich Dr. Vio made. Moreover they gave him the town register (of births,\r\netc.), which the Magyars had appropriated and which was now discovered\r\nat the palace. This was at 9 a.m. on October 30. Dr. Vio said that he\r\nwas glad that everything had been arranged so amicably. But on the same\r\nevening the Italian National Council elected itself, for a large number\r\nof the Autonomist party had now become the Italian party. There still\r\nremained, however, an Autonomist party, which was no longer inspired,\r\nlike the old Autonomists, by despotic sentiments towards the Croats, but\r\nby a feeling that in consequence of this long despotism the Croats were,\r\nas yet, not fit to govern such a place as Rieka. This is a matter of\r\nopinion. These Autonomists considered that, at any rate for several\r\nyears, the town should not belong to Yugoslavia or to Italy, but be a\r\nfree town under Allied, British or American, control. After five or six\r\nyears there could be a plebiscite, and during that period the population\r\nwould be encouraged to devote itself more to business and less to\r\npolitics. This would tend to make them a united people, with the\r\ninterests of the town at heart. But the Italian party, said the\r\nAutonomist leader, Mr. Gothardi, did not appear to think these interests\r\nimportant; when it was argued that Rieka would not flourish under Italy,\r\nbecause of the competition with Italy's other ports and especially\r\nTriest, because of the vast Italian debt, and for other reasons, the\r\nItalian party answered that even if the grass grew in Rieka's streets it\r\nmust belong to Italy. \"Very well,\" said the Slavs, \"then we will develop\r\nthe harbour at Bakar\" a few miles away. \"Infamous idea!\" exclaimed the\r\nItalianists; \"Rieka is the harbour for the hinterland.\" There the\r\nAutonomists agree with them, that the town should finally belong to the\r\nState which has the hinterland. Mr. Gothardi's party gathered strength\r\nand he himself became so obnoxious to the Italianists that when I saw\r\nhim in the month of May 1919 he had been for several weeks a prisoner in\r\nhis flat, on account of some thirty individuals with sticks who were\r\nlurking round the corner. His figures were as follows:\r\n\r\n          6,000 Socialists.\r\n          3,000 Autonomists.\r\n          1,500 Yugoslavs.\r\n          -----\r\n That is, 10,000 voters out of 12-13,000.\r\n\r\nOne may mention that he, like some others of his party, belongs to a\r\nfamily which has been at Rieka for two hundred years, whereas of the\r\nfifteen gentlemen who called themselves the Italian National Council,\r\nonly one--a cousin of Mr. Gothardi's--is a member of an old Rieka\r\nfamily. Most of the others we are bound to call renegades.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why the Italian National Council was established, and\r\nwhy its members swore that they would give their lives if they could\r\nthus give Rieka to the \"Madre Patria.\" Some of them believed, I am sure,\r\nthat this was for Rieka's good, cultural and economical; others\r\nentertained the motives that we saw at Zadar--personal ambition and the\r\ndesire to satisfy some animosities. And there were others who remembered\r\nwhat occurred in the great harbour warehouses. They hoped, they thought\r\nthat if the town fell to the lot of Italy no questions would be\r\nasked.[15] There must also have been some who could not bear to\r\ncontemplate the loss of their old privileged position.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE I.N.C.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time it was not known who were the members of the\r\nItalian National Council. From internal evidence one saw that they were\r\nnot particularly logical people, for they made much play, in their\r\nannouncements, with \"democratic principles\" in spite of the undemocratic\r\nfog in which they wrapped themselves. Of course they had not been\r\nelected by anyone except themselves; but there was a vast difference\r\nbetween them and the self-elected Croat National Council, since the\r\nlatter derived their authority from the Croatian Government at Zagreb,\r\nwhich Dr. Vio, in the name of the Rieka municipality, had\r\nrecognized--whereas the Italian National Council was destitute of any\r\nparent, though they would, had they been pressed, have claimed, no\r\ndoubt, the blissfully unconscious \"Madre Patria.\" Subsequently it turned\r\nout that the I.N.C. consisted of Dr. Vio and of fourteen persons who had\r\nhitherto not taken part in public life. They were fourteen worthies of\r\nthe background, the most remarkable act in the life of their President,\r\nDr. Grossich, for example, dating from twenty years ago when he was the\r\nmedical attendant of the Archduchess Clothilde, and decorated, so they\r\nsay, his consulting-room with black and yellow festoons. The I.N.C.\r\nappeared at its inception to be different from a Russian Soviet because\r\nit had no power.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROATS' BLUNDER\r\n\r\nA number of deplorable transactions ensued, and they were not all\r\ncommitted by the Italianists. The proclamations which were sent from\r\nZagreb, exhorting the people to be tranquil, were printed in the two\r\nlanguages, but some Croat super-patriots at Rieka tried to make the town\r\nmono-lingual. At the railway station and the post office they removed\r\nthe old Italian inscriptions and put up Croatian ones, they wrote to\r\nthe mayor in Croat, which, although Dr. Vio has a Croat father and\r\nvisited a Croat school and a Croat university, was tactless; they wrote\r\nthat Croat would now be the language of the town, which was a foolish\r\nthing to do. They even seem to have demanded the evacuation of the town\r\nhall within twenty-four hours. And the irresponsible persons who made\r\nthis demand were very properly snubbed by the municipal authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELODRAMA\r\n\r\nThese excited patriots, delirious with joy that at last their own town\r\nwas in their hands, did not set Rieka on fire, nor did they murder women\r\nand children; but the Italianists forthwith sent wireless messages to\r\nVenice, screaming that all these enormities were taking place. A few of\r\nthem rushed off in motors to Triest, where they made themselves into a\r\nCommittee of Public Safety, picked up some Triest sympathizers and flew\r\non to Venice, where they related breathless stories of foul deeds. One,\r\nwhich appeared in the Italian Press, was that three children of Rieka\r\nhad been publicly committed to the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARCE\r\n\r\nOn November 4 an Italian destroyer, the _Stocco_, shortly followed by\r\nthe _Emanuele Filiberto_, a cruiser, came on their errand of humanity.\r\nThe I.N.C. at once organized a plebiscite--by which is meant not a dull\r\ngiving and counting of votes in the usual election booths. A plebiscite,\r\nat all events a plebiscite at Rieka, signifies for the Italianists a mob\r\nassembled in a public thoroughfare; photographs of such assemblies\r\nillustrate their pamphlets and are entitled \"plebiscito.\" At the harbour\r\nthe Italian Admiral, whose name was Raineri, told the joyous I.N.C.--who\r\nnow had flung aside their anonymity--that he had come to bring them a\r\nsalute from Italy, and that he had been sent to shield Italians and to\r\nprotect Italian interests. The plebiscite threw up its hats and waved\r\nits flags, and shouted its applause and sang its songs. Flowers fell\r\nupon the Admiral, and on his men and on the guns; the ships, as we are\r\ntold, were changed to floating gardens. But the sailors did not\r\ndisembark. Some ladies, members of the plebiscite, besought the Admiral\r\nto come ashore, and hoping to persuade the men, they climbed on board\r\nand playfully seized many sailors' caps, which in the town, they said,\r\ncould be redeemed. Then shortly afterwards, the Yugoslav officials came\r\nto greet the Admiral, as did the commandant of the Yugoslav troops which\r\nhad been for several days guarding the town. Meanwhile some unknown\r\npersons had been up in the old clock-tower and, for reasons known\r\nperhaps to themselves, had taken in both the Croatian and Italian flags;\r\nthe Admiral drove up to see the Governor, Dr. Lenac, and requested that\r\nhis country's flag should be rehoisted, which of course was done. And\r\nuntil November 17 the Admiral was nearly every day up at the Governor's\r\npalace, as a multitude of details had to be discussed. A French warship\r\narrived on the 10th, followed by a British vessel on the 12th or 13th.\r\nPerfect calm prevailed. Croatian and Italian flags flew everywhere, as\r\nwell as French ones, British and American. The name of the Hotel Deak\r\nwas altered to Hotel Wilson.... But the men of the _Emanuele Filiberto_\r\nand the _Stocco_ did not land. Colonel Tesli['c] assured the Admiral\r\nthat if anyone started to set fire to an Italianist child or to indulge\r\nin any other crime he would prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROLE D'HONNEUR\r\n\r\nAll this was very disconcerting to the I.N.C. They knew that on the\r\nhills outside Rieka were large numbers of Italian troops, which had come\r\noverland from Istria. But how to get them in? Rieka had not been\r\nascribed to the Italians by the London Treaty.[16] ... On November 15 a\r\ndetachment of Serbian troops arrived, under Colonel Maximovi['c], and\r\nwere given a magnificent reception. Thousands of people accompanied\r\nthem, and in front of the French destroyer there was a manifestation.\r\nSome of the Serbs, old warriors who had been under arms since the first\r\nBalkan War, were moved to tears. The Italianists were furious; Admiral\r\nRaineri called on the Governor for an explanation of the Serbs' arrival.\r\nA conference was held between the Admiral, the Colonel and two Yugoslav\r\nofficers. If the Serbs remained at Rieka, said the Admiral, he would\r\nland his marines. Maximovi['c] said he had come in obedience to his\r\norders, and that he would have to prevent by force the disembarkation of\r\nthe Italians. At this moment a Serbian officer entered to announce that\r\nItalian armoured cars were approaching from Abbazia. Maximovi['c]\r\nimmediately ordered his troops to mobilize, but the Admiral said a\r\nmistake had been made and that the cars would be sent back. (The\r\nGovernment Secretary, Dr. Ru[vz]i['c], had been told at three o'clock by\r\na telephone operator that the Admiral had himself telephoned to Abbazia\r\nfor the cars.) It was decided at this conference that on Sunday,\r\nNovember 17, the Yugoslav troops would evacuate the town, that it would\r\nbe occupied by Serbian and American troops, and that, to mark the\r\nalliance, a small Italian detachment would be landed. As Admiral Cagni,\r\nof Pola, ordered that Italian troops should be disembarked at Rieka,\r\nanother conference was held between Admiral Raineri, Colonel\r\nMaximovi['c], Colonel Tesli['c] and Captain Dvorski (of the Yugoslav\r\nnavy), as well as French and British officers. It was arranged _sous\r\nparole d'honneur d'officier_ that at 4 p.m. the Serbian troops should\r\nleave Rieka and go to Porto Re, an hour's sea journey, that the Yugoslav\r\ntroops should remain, and that the Italians should not land. No other\r\nsteps would be taken till November 20 at noon, and the Supreme Command\r\nwould be asked to settle the difficulty. As soon as the Serbian troops\r\nwere out at sea, the Italian army, under General di San Marzano\r\n(attended by a kinematograph), marched in from the hills, entering the\r\ntown simultaneously from four directions, in accordance with a strategic\r\nplan. The General was told what Raineri had agreed to do; he replied\r\nthat he was Raineri's senior, that the final decision rested with him,\r\nand that he intended to proceed into the town. (One of the British\r\nofficers is said to have addressed him rather bluntly.) At 4.30 Raineri\r\nlanded his marines, and afterwards he was dismissed from his post--not,\r\nindeed, for having broken his word given at the inter-Allied conference,\r\nbut for having delayed so long before disembarking troops in the town.\r\nHe said he had received a written order from the Entente; if only\r\nMaximovi['c] had not left he might have shown it him. With twenty\r\ncarabinieri the General went to the Governor's palace and asked Dr.\r\nLenac to vacate it. He was so excited that he almost pushed the doctor\r\nout. \"There is no room for the two of us,\" he said. And that is how the\r\nItalian occupation began. The French and British brought some troops in\r\nat a later date, but when they had six hundred each the Italians had\r\n22,000. With the Italians came fifty Americans, so that the force might\r\nhave an international appearance. These Americans were given\r\nbroad-sheets, printed by the town Italianists in English; they welcomed\r\nthe Americans as liberators, and informed them that the population had\r\nby plebiscite declared for annexation to the Motherland. On the same\r\nnight the Yugoslav troops were turned out of their barracks into the\r\nstreet by the Italian army.... These are, I believe, the main facts as\r\nto the occupation which has been the subject of much heated argument. I\r\nhad the facts from eye-witnesses and documents: I exposed the evidence\r\nof each side to the criticism of the other.\r\n\r\nVery soon the disorders began. On the evening of the occupation Italian\r\ntroops ran through the town, accompanied by some of the plebiscite, and\r\ncompelled the people to remove the Yugoslav colours from their\r\nbutton-holes. In cases they surrounded their victim and used force. When\r\nthis was used against women, after the arrival of the French and\r\nBritish, it produced some serious international affrays. The Italians,\r\nwho invariably outnumbered the others, did not scruple to employ their\r\nknives; thus in the middle of December two French soldiers were stabbed\r\nin the back and their murderers were never found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POPULATION OF THE TOWN\r\n\r\nBut there had been at Rieka an Englishman for whom I have an almost\r\ninexpressible admiration. This was Mr. A. Beaumont who, a couple of days\r\nafter the Italians occupied the town in the above-mentioned curious\r\nfashion, sent from Triest a long message to the _Daily Telegraph_. How\r\ncan anyone not marvel at a gentleman who travels to a foreign town which\r\nis in the throes of unrest and who, undeterred by his infirmity, sits\r\ndown to grasp the rather complicated features of the situation? I am not\r\nacquainted with Mr. Beaumont, but he must be blind, poor fellow, for he\r\nsays that the Yugoslavs occupied with ill-concealed glee a town entirely\r\ninhabited by some 45,000 Italians. Perhaps somebody will read to him the\r\nfollowing statistics made after the year 1868, when Rieka came under\r\nMagyar dominion. The statistics were made by the Magyars and Italianists\r\ncombined, so that they do not err in favour of the Yugoslavs. He might\r\nalso be told that the Magyar-Italian alliance closed the existing\r\nYugoslav national schools for the 13,478 Yugoslavs in 1890, while they\r\nopened Italo-Magyar schools for the 13,012 \"Italians\" and Magyars. They\r\nwould not even allow the Yugoslavs to have at Rieka an elementary school\r\nat their own expense. Everything possible was done during these decades\r\nto inculcate hatred and contempt for whatsoever was Slav, hoping thus to\r\ndenationalize the citizens. In view of all this it speaks well for\r\nYugoslav steadfastness that they were able to maintain themselves. Here\r\nare the figures:\r\n\r\n           YUGOSLAVS.       ITALIANS.       MAGYARS.\r\n\r\n1880       10,227 (49%)      9,237 (44%)      379  (2%)\r\n1890       13,478 (46%)     13,012 (44%)    1,062  (4%)\r\n1900       16,197 (42%)     17,354 (45%)    2,842  (7%)\r\n1910       15,692 (32%)     24,212 (49%)    6,493 (13%)\r\n\r\nAssuming for the moment that these figures are correct--and it is an\r\nenormous assumption[17]--are not the Autonomists to be found chiefly\r\namong the Italians and Magyars? It is claimed that the Autonomist,\r\nSocialist and Slav vote exceeds that of those who desire annexation to\r\nItaly. One need not treat _au serieux_ the great procession organized by\r\nthe Italianists, when they could not scrape together more than about\r\n4000 persons, including many schoolboys and girls, the municipal clerks,\r\nvisitors from Italy, Triest and Zadar. One need not gibe the Italianists\r\nwith the numbers who followed Dr. Vio on that famous day when, weary of\r\npalavering, he summoned round him his supporters and strode off to the\r\nGovernor's palace, where General Grazioli, who had succeeded General di\r\nSan Marzano, was installed.[18] Arrived there, Dr. Vio with a superb\r\ngesture begged the General to accept the town in the name of Italy. It\r\nis not often in the lifetime of a man that he has the opportunity of\r\ngiving a whole town away. Dr. Vio made the most of that occasion; if the\r\ncrowd which followed him was disappointing, there may be good\r\nexplanations. The allegiance of a town, one may submit, should be\r\nsettled in another fashion. The house-to-house inquiry, conducted in the\r\nspring of 1919 by the Autonomists--resulting in an anti-annexionist\r\nmajority--was much impeded by the police; and it is of course the\r\nbusiness of the authorities and not of any one party to hold elections\r\nin a town. Had the Italian National Council, bereaving themselves of\r\nItalian bayonets, held a real plebiscite--secret or otherwise--the\r\nresult would doubtless have given them pain, but no surprise.... And\r\nthis will happen even if the Magyar system of separating Rieka from the\r\nsuburb of Su[vs]ak is perpetrated. Su[vs]ak contains about 12,500\r\nYugoslavs and extremely few Italianists; and, by the way, to show how\r\nthe Magyars and the Italianists worked together, it is worth mentioning\r\nthat the Magyar railway officials who lived at Su[vs]ak were allowed a\r\nvote at Rieka, while if a Croat lived at Su[vs]ak and carried on his\r\navocation at Rieka he could vote in Su[vs]ak only. One must not imagine\r\nthat Su[vs]ak is a poor relation; most people would prefer to live\r\nthere. Dr. Vio was intensely wrathful because the British General\r\nresided in a beautifully situated house there by the sea. Not only is\r\nSu[vs]ak about twenty yards, across a stream, from Rieka, but from a\r\ncommercial point of view their separation seems absurd, since half the\r\nport, including the great wood depots, is in Su[vs]ak. One of these\r\ntimber merchants presented an example of Italianization. His original\r\nname was E. R. Sarinich and this was painted on his business premises at\r\nSu[vs]ak, while in Rieka he called himself Sarini. It must have caused\r\nhim many sleepless nights.... Counting Su[vs]ak with Rieka as one town,\r\nthe total population in the autumn of 1918 was about 51 per cent.\r\nYugoslav, 39 per cent. Italian and 10 per cent. Magyar. These Magyars,\r\nby the way, seem not to have been noticed by Mr. Beaumont. There were\r\nstill a good number of them in the town. \"Whilst Italy might have\r\nconsented,\" says Mr. Beaumont, \"to a compromise with Hungary, had that\r\nState continued to exist as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, she\r\ncertainly never contemplated handing over\"--[\"handing over\" is rather\r\nhumorous]--\"Fiume and its exclusively Italian population to the\r\nJugo-Slavs.\" Underneath Mr. Beaumont's dispatch there is printed a\r\nsemi-official statement, sent by Reuter, from Rome. \"Yesterday\r\nafternoon,\" it says, \"our troops occupied Fiume. The occupation, which\r\nwas made for reasons of public order, was decided upon in view not only\r\nof the urgent and legitimate demands of the Italian citizens of Fiume,\r\nbut also of the insistent appeals of eminent foreigners....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALE CONTINUES ON THE NORTHERN ISLES\r\n\r\n\"Italy's reward,\" says Mr. Beaumont, \"must be commensurate with her\r\nsacrifices, and this is the attitude assumed here. It is quite apart\r\nfrom the mere question as to whether the Jugo-Slavs are in a majority in\r\ncertain districts or not. Those districts form a part of old Italian\r\nterritory, of Italian lands once peopled and occupied by the Italian\r\nrace and into which, with Austria's encouragement, Slav populations have\r\nfiltered.\" [I should love to know what are Mr. Beaumont's sources.] \"The\r\nquestion must not be left to local ambition and antipathies. It must be\r\ndecided authoritatively and quickly in strong counsel to the Jugo-Slav\r\nleaders.\" ... Let us leave Rieka and see how the Italians decided\r\nauthoritatively and quickly on the island of Cres (Cherso). It is a\r\nlarge but not thickly populated island; having 8162 inhabitants for 336\r\nsquare kilometres. The Yugoslavs, according to the census of 1910,\r\nnumber 5714 or 71.3 per cent., while the Italian-speaking population\r\namounts to 2296 or 28 per cent. About the middle of November the Italian\r\nauthorities placed in the village of Martin[vs]['c]ica, which is in the\r\nsouth-western part of the island, 17 soldiers, 3 carabinieri and a\r\nlieutenant. Let me say at once that I have never been to Cres, all my\r\nknowledge of this case comes from a Franciscan monk who lives there, the\r\nRev. Ambrose Vlahov, Professor of Theology. At Martin[vs]['c]ica, he\r\nsays, there is not a single Italianist; the entire village is Yugoslav.\r\nWhen the Italian military arrived the lieutenant insisted that the\r\npriest, Karlo Hla['c]a, should cease to sing the Mass in Old Slav, and\r\nthat for the whole service he should use Italian, the only language,\r\nsaid the lieutenant, which he (the lieutenant) understood. It was futile\r\nfor the priest to demonstrate what a ridiculous and unreasonable demand\r\nthis was; the lieutenant always came back to the subject, being sometimes\r\nmerely importunate and sometimes using menaces. As Hla['c]a was a model\r\necclesiastic, highly esteemed by his parishioners, the lieutenant\r\ncomprehended that as long as this priest remained, he would be foiled in\r\nhis endeavours; he therefore sought an opportunity to turn him out. On\r\nJanuary 5, 1919, the priest had, by order of his bishop, to read during\r\nthe service a pastoral letter on the duties of the faithful towards the\r\nChurch and towards their fellow-men; he had also to add a simple and\r\nconcise commentary. In this letter there was a passage dealing with\r\nschools, and the priest on that topic remarked that \"by divine and human\r\nlaw every nation may ask that its children should be instructed in their\r\nmother tongue.\" When Mass was finished, the mayor of the village\r\nassembled the parishioners and notified them that henceforward, by order\r\nof the lieutenant, there would no longer be in the village a Croatian\r\nbut an Italian school. And in order to mollify the people he added that\r\nthe lieutenant proposed to give subsidies to such as stood in need; they\r\nhad only to present themselves before that officer. But, though the\r\npeople often found it hard to satisfy their simple wants and were at\r\nthat period in very great distress, they walked away from this assembly\r\nwithout making one step in the lieutenant's direction. This incited him\r\nto such fury that he ran, accompanied by soldiers and carabinieri, to\r\nthe priest, and publicly, in a loud voice, insulted him, calling him an\r\nintriguer, a rebel, an agitator. On the following day the lieutenant had\r\nhim conducted to the village of Cres by two soldiers and a carabiniere,\r\nwho were all armed.... At Cres the priest was brought before the\r\ncommanding officer of the Quarnero Islands--our old acquaintance, the\r\nnaval captain of Krk--who happened to be in this village. He started at\r\nonce to bellow at the priest and, striking the table with his hand,\r\nexclaimed: \"This is an Italian island, all Italian, nothing but Italian\r\nand evermore it will remain Italian.\" About a score of parishioners had\r\ncome to Cres behind their priest and his escort; they begged the\r\ncommandant to set him free. As an answer he harangued them with respect\r\nto the Italian character of the islands, told them that they would have\r\nto send their children to the Italian school and that the whole village\r\nwould be Italianized and that _only in their homes_ would they be\r\npermitted to speak Croatian.... On January 8 the priest was taken from\r\nCres to the island of Krk, where he was informed that he would have to\r\nleave his parish, but that he might go back there for a day or two to\r\nfetch a few necessities. It was raining in torrents when Father\r\nHla['c]a, wet to the skin, arrived at his village on the 11th at seven\r\no'clock in the evening. As he suffers from several chronic\r\nailments--which was known to the lieutenant--this bad weather had a\r\ngrave effect upon him. When he reached his house he went to bed at once\r\nwith a very high temperature. After about a quarter of an hour the\r\nlieutenant appeared with two carabinieri and shouted at him that he must\r\nget up. This draconian injunction had to be obeyed, the more so as the\r\nlieutenant was labouring under great excitement. He looked at the\r\npriest's permit which allowed him to come back to the village, and said,\r\n\"If I were in your shoes I wouldn't venture to come back here.\" These\r\nwords gave Father Hla['c]a an impression that his life was in danger.\r\nThe lieutenant then ordered him not to go out among the people, but to\r\nstop where he was until he was taken away. Five days after this the\r\npriest was taken to Rieka, so that the villagers were left with nobody\r\nto guard them against the violence and the temptations offered them by\r\nthe Italians. The Croat inscription outside the school was replaced by\r\none in Italian and, with the lieutenant acting as teacher, the doors\r\nwere thrown open. But the only children who went there were those of the\r\nlieutenant himself and those of the mayor, who was a renegade in the pay\r\nof the Italians. It was announced that heavy fines would be inflicted if\r\nthe other children did not come. The villagers were in great trouble and\r\nin fear, with nobody to give them advice or consolation.... There may be\r\nsome who will be curious to know concerning the \"Italian\" population of\r\nthis island, which, according to the 1910 census, reached the large\r\nfigure of 28 per cent. At a place called Nere[vz]ine it was stated, in\r\nthe census of 1880, that the commissioner had found 706 Italians and 340\r\nYugoslavs. Consequently an Italian primary school was opened; but when\r\nit was discovered that the children of Nere[vz]ine knew not one traitor\r\nword of that language, the school was transformed into a Yugoslav\r\nestablishment. This is one case out of many; the 28 per cent. would not\r\nbear much scrutiny.... But the Italian Government, at any rate the \"Liga\r\nNazionale\" to whose endowment it contributes, had been taking in hand\r\nthis question of elementary schools in Istria and Dalmatia among the\r\nSlav population. The \"Liga\" made gratuitous distribution of clothing, of\r\nboots, of school-books and so forth. Some indigent Slavs allowed\r\nthemselves in this way to become denationalized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen, however, you examine the embroideries of these\r\nislands--particularly beautiful on Rab and on the island of wild olive\r\ntrees, the neighbouring Pag--you will be sure that such an ancient\r\nnational spirit as they show will not be easily seduced. The Magyars, by\r\nthe way, whose culture is more modern, borrowed certain features that\r\nyou find on these embroideries--the sun, for instance, and the cock,\r\nwhich have from immemorial times been thought appropriate by these\r\npeople for the cloth a woman wears upon her head when she is bringing a\r\nnew son into the world, whose dawn the cock announces. Older than the\r\nworkers in wood, much older than those who carved in stone, are these\r\nisland embroiderers. In this work the people reproduced their tears and\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAB IS COMPLETELY CAPTURED\r\n\r\nWhat will it avail to put up \"Liga\" schools in these islands, where the\r\npopulation is 99.67 per cent. Yugoslav and 0.31 per cent.\r\nItalianist--that is, if we are content to accept the Austrian\r\nstatistics? What ultimate advantage will accrue to Italy from the doings\r\nof her emissaries, in November 1918, on the isle of Rab? It was Tuesday,\r\nNovember 26, when the _Guglielmo Pepe_ of the Italian navy put in at the\r\nvenerable town which is the capital of that island. The commander, with\r\nan Italianist deputy from Istria, climbed up to the town-hall with the\r\nold marble balcony and informed the mayor and the members of the local\r\ncommittee of the Yugoslav National Council that he had come in the name\r\nof the Entente and in virtue of the arrangements of the Armistice; he\r\nsaid that in the afternoon Italian troops would land, for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining order. It was pointed out to him that no disturbance had\r\narisen, and that, according to the terms of the Armistice, he had no\r\nright to occupy this island. The commander announced that he must\r\ndisarm the national guard, but that the Yugoslav flags would not be\r\ninterfered with; the Italian flag would only be hoisted on the\r\nharbour-master's office and the military headquarters. On the next day,\r\nafter he had been unable to induce the town authorities to lower their\r\nnational flag from the clock-tower, he sent a hundred men with a machine\r\ngun to carry out his wishes. Filled with confidence by this heroic deed,\r\nhe marched into the mayor's office and dissolved the municipal council.\r\nArmed forces occupied the town-hall, over which an Italian flag was\r\nflown. An Italian officer was entrusted with the mayoral functions and\r\nwith the municipal finances, while the post office was also captured and\r\nall private telegrams forbidden, not only those which one would have\r\nliked to dispatch, but those which came in from elsewhere--they were not\r\ndelivered. All meetings and manifestations were made illegal. The\r\ncommander, whose name was Captain Denti di ---- (the other part being\r\nillegible), sent a memorandum to the municipal council which explained\r\nthat he dissolved it on account of their having grievously troubled the\r\npublic order; he did this by virtue of the powers conferred upon him and\r\nin the name of the Allied Powers and the United States of America. The\r\nislanders did not pretend to be experts in international law, but they\r\ndid not believe that he was in the right.\r\n\r\n\"I have every confidence,\" said the Serbian Regent, when he was\r\nreceiving a deputation of the Yugoslav National Council a few days after\r\nthis--\"I have every confidence that the operations for the freedom of\r\nthe world will be accomplished, that large numbers of our brethren will\r\nbe liberated from a foreign yoke. And I feel sure that this point of\r\nview will be adopted by the Government of the Kingdom of Italy, which\r\nwas founded on these very principles. They were cherished in the hearts\r\nand executed in the deeds of great Italians in the nineteenth century.\r\nWe can say frankly that in choosing to have us as their friends and good\r\nneighbours the Italian nation will find more benefit and a greater\r\nsecurity than in the enforcement of the Treaty of London, which we never\r\nsigned nor recognized, and which was made at a time when nobody foresaw\r\nthe crumbling of Austria-Hungary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAVANTI SAVOIA!\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to chronicle a thousandth part of the outrages,\r\ncrimes and stupidities committed on Yugoslav territory by the Italians.\r\nWhere they were threatened with an armed resistance they yielded. Thus\r\non November 14, when they had reached Vrhnica (Ober-Laibach) on their\r\nway to Ljubljana (Laibach), they were met by Colonel Svibi['c] with\r\nsixteen other officers who had just come out of an internment camp in\r\nAustria. Svibi['c] requested the Italians to leave Vrhnica. He said that\r\nhe and the Serbian commander at Ljubljana would prevent the advance of\r\nthe Italians into Yugoslav territory. They would be most reluctant to be\r\nobliged to resort to armed force should the Italians continue their\r\nadvance, and they declined responsibility for any bloodshed which might\r\nensue.... The colonel of the Italian regiment which had been stationed\r\nfor some days at Vrhnica informed the mayor of that commune that he had\r\nreceived orders to depart; he retired to the line of demarcation fixed\r\nby the Armistice conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENTENTE AT RIEKA\r\n\r\nIt was ironical that a young State, struggling into life, should be\r\nhindered, not by former enemies but by friends of its friends. The\r\nItalians complained that the French, British and Americans were not\r\nfraternizing with them. In the first place, it was repugnant to the\r\nsense of justice of these nations when they saw that General di San\r\nMarzano, after having fraudulently seized the town of Rieka and turning\r\nits absolutely legal Governor into the street, did not ask the citizens\r\nto organize a temporary local government, in which all parties would be\r\nrepresented, but delivered, if you please, the town to fifteen\r\ngentlemen, the I.N.C., who--at the very utmost--represented half the\r\npopulation. On November 24, the local newspaper _Il Popolo_ announced in\r\na non-official manner that the I.N.C., in full accord with the military\r\ncommand, had taken over the administration--_i poteri pubblici_. This,\r\nby the way, was never confirmed by the representatives of the other\r\nAllies. The I.N.C. furthermore declared null and of no effect any\r\nintervention of the Yugoslav National Council in the affairs of the\r\nauthorities of the State of Rieka. When the Yugoslavs appealed to the\r\nFrench, British or Americans they were naturally met with sympathy and\r\nurged to have patience. Case after case of high-handed dealing was\r\nreported to these officers. They sometimes intervened with good effect;\r\nfar more injustice would have happened; far more Croats and Autonomists,\r\nfor instance, would have been deported if the Allies had not interceded.\r\nIt was now, of course, impossible for Yugoslavs to wear their colours;\r\nnor could they prevent the C.N.I. from hanging vast Italian flags on\r\nCroat houses. One of the largest flags, I should imagine, in the world\r\nswayed to and fro between Rieka's chief hotel and the tall building on\r\nthe opposite side of the square--and both these houses, mark you, were\r\nCroat property. But the Allied officers knew very well (and the C.N.I.\r\nknew that they knew) that more than thirty of the large buildings on the\r\nfront belonged to Croats, whereas under half a dozen were the property\r\nof Italians or Italianists. The ineffable Mr. Edoardo Susmel, in one of\r\nhis pro-Italian books, entreats certain French and British friends of\r\nthe Yugoslavs to come for one hour to Rieka and judge for themselves.\r\nBut twenty minutes would be ample for a man of average intelligence. In\r\nmany ways the presence of the Allies grieved the C.N.I. The Allies\r\nlooked without approval at the \"Giovani Fiumani,\" an association of\r\nyoung rowdies of whose valuable services the C.N.I. availed itself. But\r\nif these hired bands could not be dispersed they could have limits\r\nplaced upon their zeal. One of their ordinary methods was to sit in\r\ngroups in cafes or in restaurants or other places where an orchestra was\r\nplaying, then to shout for the Italian National Anthem and to make\r\nthemselves as nasty as they dared to anyone who did not rise. If\r\neverybody rose, then they would wait a quarter of an hour and have the\r\nmusic played again. The Allied officers persuaded General Grazioli to\r\nprohibit any National Anthem in a public place. It was distasteful to\r\nthe Allied officers when a local newspaper in French--_l'Echo de\r\nl'Adriatique_--which had been established to present the Yugoslav point\r\nof view, was continually being suppressed. For example, on December 14,\r\nit printed a short greeting from the Croat National Council to President\r\nWilson. The most anti-Italian phrase in this that I could find was:\r\n\"Their fondest hope is to justify to the world, to history and to you\r\nthe great trust you have placed in them.\" This was refused publication.\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that Yugoslav newspapers were confiscated and\r\ntheir sale forbidden--after all, one didn't buy German or Austrian\r\nnewspapers in England during the War, and the Italians now regarded the\r\nCroats as very pernicious enemies. _La Rassegna Italiana_ of December 15\r\ncalled its first article--printed throughout in italics--\"I Prussiani\r\ndell' Adriatico,\" and took to its bosom an \"upright American citizen\"\r\nreturning from a visit to \"Fiume nostra,\" who defined the Yugoslavs \"on\r\naccount of their greed and their brutality and their spirit of intrigue\r\nand their lack of candour as the Prussians of the Adriatic.\" Personally\r\nI should submit that the Prussian spirit was not wholly lacking in those\r\ntwo Italian officers who penetrated on November 25 into the dining-room\r\nat the quarters of the Custom-house officials and informed them that\r\nthey wanted their piano. No discussion was permitted; the piano\r\n\"transferred itself,\" as they say in some languages, to the Italian\r\nofficers' mess. The Prussian spirit was not undeveloped in a certain Mr.\r\n[vS]tigli['c]--his name might cause his enemies to say he is a renegade,\r\nbut as my knowledge of him is confined to other matters, we will say he\r\nis the noblest Roman of them all. He likewise had a dig at the\r\nCustom-house officials; I know not whether he was wiping off old scores.\r\nAppointed by the I.N.C. as director of the Excise office, he\r\ncommunicated with the resident officials--Franjo Jakov[vc]i['c], Ivan\r\nMikuli[vc]i['c] and Grga Ma[vz]uran--on December 5, and told them to\r\nclear out by the following Saturday, they and their families, so that in\r\nthe heart of winter forty-one persons were suddenly left homeless.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CANDID FRENCHMAN\r\n\r\nThis and innumerable other manifestations of Prussianism were brought to\r\nthe attention of the French, so that it was not surprising when a\r\nFrenchman made a few remarks in the _Rije['c]_ of Zagreb. His article,\r\nentitled \"Mise au point,\" begins by a reference to the Yugoslav cockades\r\nwhich were sometimes worn by the French sailors. This, to the Italians,\r\nwas as if an ally in the reconquered towns of Metz and Strasbourg had\r\nsported the colours of an enemy. \"The cases are not parallel,\" says the\r\nFrenchman. \"You have come to Rieka and to Pola as conquerors of towns\r\nthat were exhausted, yielding to the simultaneous and gigantic pressure\r\nof the Allied armies. These towns gave themselves up. Are they on that\r\naccount your property, and are we to consider as a dead-letter the\r\nclauses of the Armistice which settled that Pola should be occupied by\r\nthe Allies? I am not so dexterous a diplomat as to be able to follow you\r\nalong this track; let it be decided by others. But we who were present\r\nperceived that your occupation, which you had regulated in every detail,\r\nhad a close resemblance to the entry of a circus into some provincial\r\ntown, whose population is known beforehand to be of a hostile character.\r\nIt is needless to say that this masquerade, these vibrating appeals to\r\nfraternity that were placarded upon the walls gave us in that grey,\r\nabandoned town an impression of complete fiasco.\" [\"It is significant,\"\r\nwrites Mr. Beaumont the Italophil, \"that the Slav population ... observe\r\nan attitude of strange reserve and diffidence. They are silent and\r\nalmost sullen. When the Italian fleet first visited Pola there was\r\nhardly a cheer....\"] \"Now let me tell you,\" says the Frenchman, \"that\r\nour entry into Alsace was different. Foch was not obliged to send\r\nemissaries in advance in order to decorate the houses with flags and to\r\nerect triumphal arches. The French cockades had not nestled in the dark\r\nhair of our Alsatian women since 1870, for forty-eight years the\r\ntricolors had been waiting, piously folded at the bottom of those wooden\r\nchests, waiting for us to float them in the wind of victory--nous\r\nrentrions chez nous tout simplement. Or, vous n'etes pas chez vous ici,\r\nmessieurs.\" [\"Common reserve and decency should have induced the\r\nJugo-Slavs to abstain,\" says Mr. Beaumont, \"from rushing to take a place\r\nto which they were not invited ... an exclusively Italian city.\"]\r\n\"Whatever you may assert,\" says the Frenchman, \"everything seems to\r\ncontradict it. Your actors play their parts with skill, but the public\r\nis frigid. Now the decorations are tattered and the torches on the\r\nramparts have grown black.... Permit me, following your example, and\r\nwith courtesy, to call back the glories of old Italy, to remind myself\r\nof the great figures that stride through your history and that give to\r\nthe world an unexampled picture of the lofty works of man. Our sailors,\r\nwho are simple and often uncultured men, have no remembrance of these\r\nthings; the brutal facts, in this whirling age in which we live, have\r\nmore power to strike their imagination. What is one to say to them when\r\nthey see their comrades stabbed, slaughtered by your men as if they were\r\nnoxious animals--yesterday at Venice, the day before that at Pola,\r\nto-day at Rieka. Englishmen and Americans, your Allies, receive your\r\n'sincere and fraternal hand' which holds a dagger. As a method of\r\npacific penetration you will avow that this is rather rudimentary and\r\nthat the laws of Romulus did not teach you such fraternity. We have also\r\nseen you striking women in the street and disembowelling a child. What\r\nare we to think of that, _fratelli d'Italia_? Excuse us, but we are not\r\naccustomed to such incidents. Is it not natural that the legendary,\r\ngallant spirit of our sailors should infect the crowd? Our bluejackets\r\nhave looked in vain for the three colours which are dear to them and\r\nwhich you have excluded utterly from all your rows of flags. Well, in\r\ndefault of them, they had no choice but to array themselves in the\r\ncockades which dainty hands pinned on their uniforms.... And our\r\n'poilus,' in their faded, mud-smeared garments walk along 'your'\r\nstreets, disdainfully regarded by your dazzling and pomaded Staff. Do\r\nyou remember that these unshaven fellows who thrust back the Boche in\r\n1918 are the descendants of those who in 1793 conquered Italy and Europe\r\nwith bare feet? Therefore do not strike your breasts if now and then a\r\nsmile involuntarily appears upon their lips. O you who henceforth will\r\nbe known as the immortal heroes of the Piave, if our fellows see to-day\r\nso many noble breasts, it was not seldom that they saw another portion\r\nof your bodies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but that has nothing to do,\" some people will say, \"with Rieka's\r\neconomical position. We admit that Croatia has the historical right to\r\nthe town, but we wish to be satisfied that the Croats are not moved by\r\nreasons that would cause Rieka's ruin. It may be nowadays, owing to the\r\nunholy alliance between Magyars and Italians, that the town, with\r\nrespect to its trade, is more in the Italian sphere than in that of\r\nYugoslavia.\" The answer to this is that Italy's share of the value of\r\nthe imports into Rieka in 1911 was 7.5 per cent. of the total, while her\r\nshare of the value of the exports amounted to 13 per cent., which proves\r\nthat Italy depends commercially more on Rieka's hinterland than does\r\nthat hinterland upon Italy. It seems to be of less significance that the\r\nmillionaires of Rieka are mostly Croats, for they might conceivably have\r\nenriched themselves by trade with Italy. But of the nine banks, previous\r\nto the War the Italianists were in exclusive possession of none, while\r\nthe Croats had four; of the eight shipping companies three were Croat,\r\nthree were Magyar, one British, one German--not one Italian. It is true\r\nthat some Italian writers lay it down that Rieka's progress should be\r\nco-ordinated with that of Venice, to say nothing of Triest, and should\r\nnot be exploited by other States to the injury of the Italian Adriatic\r\nports. Their point of view is not at all obscure. And all disguise is\r\nthrown to the winds in a book which has had a great success among the\r\nItalian imperialists: _L'Adriatico et il Mediterraneo_, by Mario Alberti\r\n(Milan, 1915--third edition). The author says that Italy, having annexed\r\nTriest and Rieka, will be \"assured for ever\"; her \"economic penetration\"\r\nof the Balkans \"will no longer be threatened\" by the projected\r\nGalatz-Scutari (Danube-Adriatic) railway; Italian agriculture which, he\r\nsays, is already in peril, \"will be rescued\"; the Italian fisherman will\r\nno longer have the ports of Triest and Rieka closed (for exportation to\r\nGermany and Austria); the national wealth will be augmented by \"several\r\nmilliards\"; new fields will be open to Italian industry; her economic\r\n(and military) domination over the Adriatic will be absolute. There\r\nwill, he continues, be no more \"disturbing\" competition on the part of\r\nany foreign mercantile marine; the Adriatic will be the sole property of\r\nItaly, and so on. It would be worth while, as a study of expressions, to\r\nphotograph a few Rieka Italianists in the act of reading these rapturous\r\npages.... But lest it be imagined that I have searched for the most\r\nfeeble pro-Italian arguments in order to have no difficulty in knocking\r\nthem down, I will add that their strongest argument, taken as it is from\r\nthe official report of the French Consul in 1909, appears to be that the\r\ncommerce of Croatia amounted then to only 7 per cent. of the total trade\r\nof the port of Rieka. I am told by those who ought to know that wood\r\nalone, which comes almost exclusively from Croatia, Slavonia, etc.,\r\nrepresents 16 per cent. If other products, such as flour, wine, etc.,\r\nare considered, 50 per cent. of the total trade must be ascribed to\r\nCroatia, Slavonia, etc. And that does not take into account the western\r\nBanat and other Yugoslav territories. Serbia, too, would now take her\r\npart, so that there is no need to fear for the position of a Yugoslav\r\nRieka based solely--omitting Hungary and the Ukraine altogether--on her\r\nYugoslav hinterland. Rieka without Yugoslavia would be ruined and would\r\ndegenerate into a fishing village, with a great past and a miserable\r\nfuture. This could very well be seen during the spring of 1919 when the\r\ncommunications were interrupted between Rieka and Yugoslavia. At Rieka\r\nduring April eggs were 80 centimes apiece, while at Bakar, a few miles\r\naway, they cost 25 centimes; milk at Rieka was 6 crowns the litre and at\r\nBakar one crown; beef was 30 crowns a kilo and at Bakar 8 crowns. Italy\r\nwas calling Rieka her pearl--a pearl of great price; the Yugoslavs said\r\nit was the lung of their country. It is within the knowledge of the\r\nItalianists that the prosperity of Rieka would not be advanced by making\r\nher the last of a chain of Italian ports, but rather by making her the\r\nfirst port of Yugoslavia. What has Italy to offer in comparison with the\r\nSlovenes and the Croats? The maritime outlet of the Save valley, as well\r\nas of the plains of Hungary beyond it, is, as Sir Arthur Evans points\r\nout, the port of Rieka. And, in view of the mountainous nature of the\r\ncountry which lies for a great distance at the back of Split and of\r\nDubrovnik, it would seem that Rieka--and especially when the railway\r\nline has been shortened--will be the natural port of Belgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURNCOAT MAYOR\r\n\r\nOne cannot expect in a place with Rieka's history that such\r\nconsiderations as these will be debated, calmly or otherwise, but at all\r\nevents on their own merits. They will be approached with more than\r\nordinary passion, since so many of the people of Rieka have been\r\nturncoats. Any man who changes sides in his religion or his nationality\r\nor politics--presuming, and I hope this mostly was so at Rieka, that his\r\nreasons were not base--that man will feel profoundly on these matters,\r\nmore profoundly than the average person of his new religion, nationality\r\nor politics. He will observe the ritual, he will give utterance to his\r\nthoughts with such an emphasis that his old comrades will dislike him\r\nand his new associates be made uneasy. Thus a convert may not always be\r\nthe most delightful creature in the garden, and he is abundant at Rieka.\r\nAs an illustration we may study Dr. Vio. Many persons have repeated that\r\nhe has a Croat father, yet they should in fairness add that his father's\r\nfather came from Venice. But if he came from Lapland, that ought to be\r\nno reason why the present Dr. Vio should not, if he so desires, be an\r\nItalian. If he had, when he arrived at what is usually called the age of\r\ndiscretion, inscribed himself among the sons of Italy--_a la bonheur_.\r\nBut he took no such step. He came out as a Croat of the Croats, for when\r\nhe had finished his legal studies he became a town official, but\r\ndiscovered that his views--for he was known as an unbending\r\nCroat--hindered his advancement. The party in possession of the town\r\ncouncil, the Autonomist party, would have none of him. At last he, in\r\ndisgust, threw up his post and went into his father's office. He was\r\nentitled, after ten years' service, to a pension; the Autonomists\r\nrefused to grant it for the reason that he was so dour a Croat. Very\r\noften, talking with his friends, did Dr. Vio mention this. He made a\r\nsuccessful appeal to the Court at Buda-Pest and a certain yearly sum was\r\nconceded to him, which he may or may not be still obtaining. Then, to\r\nthe amazement of the Croats, he renounced his nationality and\r\nbecame--no, not an Italian--a Magyar. He was now one of those who called\r\nHungary his \"Madre Patria,\" and as a weapon of the ruling Hungarian\r\nparty he was employed against the Italianists. In the year 1913 the\r\ndeputy for Rieka died and Dr. Vio was a candidate, his opponent being\r\none of the Italianist party, Professor Zanella. Dr. Vio had the support\r\nof the Government officials, railway officials and so forth, and was\r\nelected. Now he was a Magyar of the Magyars: Hungarian police officials\r\nwere introduced, and Magyar, disregarding the town statutes, was\r\nemployed by them as sole official language. The citizens still speak of\r\nthose police.... The War broke out, and Dr. Vio donned a uniform,\r\nserving chiefly on the railway line between Rieka and Zagreb. Gradually\r\nhe seems to have acquired the feeling that it was unnatural for him to\r\nbe a Magyar of the Magyars, even though he was compelled, like so many\r\nothers, to wear this uniform. But one day in 1916 when his friend and\r\nfellow-officer, Fran [vS]ojat, teacher at the High School at Su[vs]ak,\r\nwalked into his room at Meja, when he happened to be putting little\r\nflags upon a map, he prophesied--King Peter and the Tzar would have been\r\nglad to hear him. Presently, he had himself elected as the mayor, which\r\nenabled him to leave an army so distasteful to him. How long would he\r\nwait until he publicly became a Croat once again? He did not doubt that\r\nthe Entente would win, and told that same friend [vS]ojat that Rieka on\r\nthe next day would be Croat. To another gentleman in June of 1918 he\r\nsaid he hoped that he would be the first Yugoslav mayor of the town, and\r\non that day, out hunting, he sang endless Croat songs. In September, to\r\nthe mayor of Su[vs]ak, \"You will see,\" he said, \"how well we two as\r\nmayors will work together.\" When the Croat National Council entered into\r\noffice at the end of October he again met Mr. [vS]ojat, just as he was\r\ngoing up to that interview in the Governor's Palace. \"Jesam li ja onda\r\nimao pravo, jesi li sada zadovoljan?\" he said. (\"Was I not right that\r\ntime? Are you satisfied now?\") Joyfully he pressed Mr. [vS]ojat's hand\r\nand greeted the two other persons who were with him. And Mr. [vS]ojat\r\nwas pleased to think that Vio would now be a good Croat, as of old. But\r\non the following day he was an Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FERVOUR\r\n\r\nWhen I went up to see this variegated gentleman--whose personal\r\nappearance is that of a bright yellow cat--he purred awhile upon the\r\nsofa and then started striding up and down the room. As he sketched the\r\nhistory of the town, which, he said, had always been Italian and would\r\ninsist on being so, he spoke with horror of the days when Jella[vc]i['c]\r\nwas in control, and then, remembering another trouble, he raised both\r\nhis hands above his head and brought them down with such a crash upon\r\nthe desk where I was writing his remarks that--but nobody burst in; the\r\nmunicipal officials were accustomed to his conversation. He was reviling\r\nat that moment certain Allied officers who had not seen fit to visit\r\nhim. \"I care not!\" he yelled. \"We are Italian! I tell you we are\r\nItalianissimi!\" (He was glad enough, however, when his brother Hamlet,\r\nwho had remained a Yugoslav and was on friendly terms with the chief of\r\nthe carabinieri, managed to obtain for the mayor a passport to Italy,\r\nconcerning which the carabinieri had said that they must first of all\r\napply to Rome.) The doctor was sure that Yugoslavia would not live, for\r\nit had two religions; and another notable defect of the Croats--\"I speak\r\ntheir language quite well,\" he said--was that in the whole of Rieka not\r\none ancient document was in Croatian. I was going to mention that\r\neverywhere in Croatia until 1848 they were in Latin--but he saw what I\r\nwas on the point of saying and--\"Look here! look here!\" he cried, \"now\r\nlook at this!\" It was a type-written sheet in English, whereon was\r\nrecounted how the mayor had offered to four Admirals, who came to Rieka\r\non behalf of their four nations, how he had, in order to meet them in\r\nevery way--\"They asked me,\" he said, with blankness and indignation and\r\nforgiveness all joined in his expression--it was beautifully done--\"they\r\nasked me, the Italian mayor of this Italian town, whether it was truly\r\nan Italian town!\"--well, he had offered to take a real plebiscite, on\r\nthe basis of the last census, and the Admirals, while appreciating his\r\noffer, had not availed themselves of it. (Maybe some one had told them\r\nhow the census officials, chiefly members of the \"Giovani Fiumani,\" had\r\ngone round, asking the people whether they spoke Italian and usually\r\nfilling in the papers themselves. Presumably the mayor did not propose\r\nto allow anyone who had then been described as an Italian now to call\r\nhimself Croat.) I was just calculating what he was in 1910 when he\r\nplayed a trump card and begged me to go up to the cemetery and take note\r\nof the language used for the epitaphs. Then let me return to him on the\r\nmorrow and say what was the nationality of Rieka. There seemed to be the\r\nquestion if in such a town where Yugoslavs so often use Italian as the\r\nbusiness language, many of them possibly might use it as the language of\r\ndeath; as it happened the first Yugoslav to whom I spoke about this\r\npoint--a lawyer at whose flat I lunched the following day--produced a\r\nlittle book entitled _Regolamento del Cimitero comunale di Fiume_, and\r\nfrom it one could see that in the local cemetery the blessed principle\r\nof self-determination was in fetters. Chapter iii. lays down that all\r\ninscriptions must have the approval of the civic body. You are warned\r\nthat they will not approve of sentences or words which are indecent, and\r\nthat they prohibit all expressions and allusions that might give offence\r\nto anyone, to moral corporations, to religions, or which are notoriously\r\nfalse. No doubt, in practice, they waive the last stipulation, so that\r\nthe survivors may give praise to famous or to infamous men; but I am\r\ntold that they raised fewer difficulties for Italian wordings, and that\r\nthe stones which many people used--those which the undertakers had in\r\nstock, with spaces left for cutting in the details--were invariably in\r\nItalian.... I hope I have not given an unsympathetic portrait of the\r\nmayor who has about him something lovable. Whatever Fate may have in\r\nstore for Rieka, Dr. Vio is so magnificent an emotional actor that his\r\nfuture is assured. I trust it will be many years before a stone, in\r\nCroat, Magyar or Italian, is placed above the body of this volatile\r\ngentleman.... And then perhaps the deed of his administrative life that\r\nwill be known more universally than any other will be the omission of\r\nan _I_ from certain postage stamps. When the old Hungarian stamps were\r\nsurcharged with the word FIUME, the sixty-third one in every sheet of\r\nhalf an edition was defective and was stamped FUME.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE PLEASANT PLACES\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of Rieka, across the bay, lies Abbazia,\r\nwhich Nature and the Austrians have made into a charming spot. By the\r\nfamous \"Strandweg\" that winds under rocks and palm and laurel, you go to\r\nVolosca in the easterly and to Lovrana in the westerly direction. Just\r\nat the back of all these pretty places stands the range of Istria's\r\ngreen mountains. More than twenty years ago a certain Dr. Krsti['c],\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Zadar, conceived the happy thought of\r\nprinting, in the peasant dialect, a newspaper which would discourse on\r\nItaly in articles no peasant could resist. He was given subsidies, and\r\nfor some time the newspaper was published at Volosca. But perhaps the\r\npeasants did not read it any more than those near Zadar would take in\r\nthe _Pravi Dalmatinac_ (\"The Real Dalmatian\"), which attempted a few\r\nyears previous to the War to preach sectionalism to the Serbo-Croats.\r\nThe Italians who came to the Abbazia district in November 1918 did not\r\ntry such methods. In the combined commune of Volosca-Abbazia the\r\npopulation at the 1910 census consisted of 4309 Yugoslavs, 1534\r\nGerman-Austrians, and 418 Italians. Most of the 418 had never seen\r\nItaly; the only true Italians were some officials who had come from\r\nother parts of Istria. The official language was Italian, which was\r\nregarded as more elegant. The district doctor was Italian, but all the\r\nother 29 non-official doctors were either Germans, Czechs or Croats. At\r\nVolosca eighteen years ago there was no Croat school; when one was\r\nopened the Italian school at once lost half its membership and before\r\nthe War had been reduced to 25 pupils. Before the War at Abbazia the\r\nCroat school had six classes, while the Italian had ceased for lack of\r\npatronage. The German school had 160 pupils; this has now been\r\ndissolved, the pupils being mostly sent to the re-opened Italian school.\r\nThus it will be seen that efforts were required to Italianize these\r\nplaces. The efforts were continued even during the War, it is said by\r\nthe ex-Empress Zita. At any rate the people who had altered their\r\nItalian names saw that they had been premature and reassumed their\r\nformer ones. They reassumed the pre-war privileges: at Lovrana, for\r\nexample, they \"ran\" the village, not having allowed any communal\r\nelections since 1905 and arranging that their Croat colleagues in the\r\ncouncil should all be illiterate peasants. Some Italians were interned\r\nin 1915, as the Croats had been in 1914, but the council came again into\r\ntheir hands. At the meetings they had been obliged, owing to the\r\ncouncil's composition, to talk Croatian; but their own predominance was\r\nundisturbed. On their return to power during the War they displayed more\r\ngenerosity, and admitted even educated Croats to the council. And if\r\nsuch out-and-out Italians as the Signori Grossmann, Pegan, etc. of\r\nLovrana were kinder to the Yugoslavs than the Signori Grbac,\r\nKoro[vs]a['c] and Codri['c] of Rieka it may be because the gentle spirit\r\nof the place affected them. The leading families would even intermarry;\r\nSignor Gelletich, Lovrana's Italian potentate, gave his sister to the\r\nCroat chieftain. But, as we have said, idylls had to end when in\r\nNovember 1918 the Italian army came upon the scene. Abbazia and Volosca\r\nand Lovrana were painted thoroughly in the Italian colours. Public\r\nbuildings, private houses--irrespective of their inmates--had patches of\r\ngreen, white and red bestowed upon them. Everything was painted--some\r\noccupation had to be found for the military, who appeared to be more\r\nnumerous than the inhabitants. Meanwhile, their commanding officers had\r\nother brilliant ideas: an Italian kindergarten was opened at Volosca,\r\nand the peasant women of the hills around were promised that if they\r\ncame with their children to the opening ceremony, every one of them\r\nwould be rewarded with 1 lb. of sugar. So they came and were\r\nphotographed--it looked extremely well to have so many women seizing\r\nthis first opportunity of an Italian education for their babies. Some\r\none at Rieka most unfortunately had forgotten to consign the sugar. The\r\nItalian officer who was appointed to discharge the functions of podesta,\r\nthat is, mayor, of Abbazia was a certain Lieut.-Colonel Stadler. He sent\r\nto Rome and Paris various telegrams as to the people's ardent hope of\r\nbeing joined to Italy. The people's own telegrams to Paris went by a\r\nmore circuitous route. But Stadler did not seem to care much for the\r\nFrench, nor yet for the English. About a dozen of the educated people,\r\nthinking that the French might also come to Abbazia and wishing to be\r\nable to converse with them, took lessons in that language; another\r\ndozen, with a similar motive, had a Mr. Po[vs]ci['c], a naturalized\r\nAmerican subject, to give them English lessons. Away with these baubles,\r\ncried Stadler; on January 10 he stopped the lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY IS LED ASTRAY BY SONNINO\r\n\r\nWhile the Italians were thus engaged, what was the state of opinion in\r\ntheir own country? Would Bissolati's organ, the _Secolo_, and the\r\n_Corriere della Sera_, which had been favourable to the Slavs since\r\nCaporetto, have it in their power to moderate the fury of the anti-Slav\r\npapers? Malagodi of the _Tribuna_ said on November 24 that the position\r\nat Rieka had been remedied. But was the public fully alive to what was\r\nhappening at Zadar and [vS]ibenik? \"While these cities have been\r\nnominally occupied by us and are under the protection of our flag, the\r\nItalian population has never been so terrorized by Croat brutality as at\r\nthis moment.\" The _Mattino_ disclosed to its readers in flaring\r\nheadlines that \"Yugoslav oppression cuts the throats of the Italian\r\npopulation in Dalmatia and terrorizes them.\" Would the people of Italy\r\nrather listen to such thrills or to the _Secolo_, which deprecated the\r\ncontemptuous writings of Italian journalists with regard to the\r\nSlavs--the _Gazzetta del Popolo's_ \"little snakes\" was one of the milder\r\nterms of opprobrium. The _Secolo_ recalled Italy's own illiterate herds\r\nand the fact that the Italian Risorgimento was judged, not by the\r\nindifferent and servile mass, but by its heroes. It explained that the\r\nTreaty of London was inspired by the belief that Austria would survive,\r\nand that for strategic reasons only it had given, not Rieka, but most of\r\nDalmatia and the islands to Italy.\r\n\r\nIt was calamitous for Italy that she was being governed at this moment\r\nnot by prudent statesmen such as she more frequently produces in the\r\nnorth, but by southerners of the Orlando and Sonnino type. The _Giornale\r\nd'Italia_ would at a word from the Foreign Minister have damped the\r\nardour of those journalists and other agitators who were fanning such a\r\ndangerous fire. Sonnino once himself told Radovi['c], the Montenegrin,\r\nthat he could not acquiesce in any union of the Yugoslavs, for such a\r\ncombination would be fraught with peril for Italians. And now that\r\nSouthern Slavs were forming what he dreaded, their United States, it\r\nwould have been sagacious--it was not too late--if he had set himself to\r\nwin their friendship. Incidents of an untoward nature had occurred, such\r\nas those connected with the Austrian fleet; nine hundred Yugoslavs,\r\nafter fighting side by side with the Italians, had actually been\r\ninterned, many of them wearing Italian medals for bravery;[20] the\r\nYugoslavs, in fact, by these and other monstrous methods had been\r\nprovoked. But it was not too late. A Foreign Minister not blind to what\r\nwas happening in foreign countries would have seen that if he valued the\r\ngoodwill of France and England and America--and this goodwill was a\r\nnecessity for the Italians--it was incumbent on him to modify his\r\npolitics. The British Press was not unanimous--all the prominent\r\npublicists did not, like a gentleman a few months afterwards in the\r\n_Spectator_, say that \"if the Yugoslavs contemplated a possible war\r\nagainst the Italians, by whose efforts and those of France and Great\r\nBritain they had so recently been liberated, then would the Southern\r\nSlavs be guilty of monstrous folly and ingratitude.\" Baron Sonnino might\r\nhave apprehended that more knowledge of the Yugoslav-Italian situation\r\nwould produce among the Allies more hostility; he should have known that\r\naverage Frenchmen do not buy their favourite newspaper for what it says\r\non foreign politics, and that the _Journal des Debats_ and the\r\n_Humanite_ have many followers who rarely read them. And, above all\r\nelse, he should have seen that the Americans, who had not signed the\r\nTreaty of London, would decline to lend themselves to the enforcement of\r\nan antiquated pact which was so grievously incongruous with Justice, to\r\nsay nothing of the Fourteen Points of Mr. Wilson. But Sonnino threw all\r\nthese considerations to the winds. He should have reconciled himself to\r\nthe fact that his London Treaty, if for no other reason than that it was\r\na secret one, belonged to a different age and was really dead; his\r\nrefusal to bury it was making him unpopular with the neighbours. One\r\ndoes not expect a politician to be quite consistent, and Baron Sonnino\r\nis, after all, not the same man who in 1881 declared that to claim\r\nTriest as a right would be an exaggeration of the principle of\r\nnationalities; but he should not in 1918 have been deaf to the words\r\nwhich he considered of such weight when he wrote them in 1915 that he\r\ncaused them to be printed in a Green Book. \"The monarchy of Savoy,\" he\r\nsaid in a telegram to the Duke of Avarna on February 15 of that year,\r\n\"has its staunchest root in the fact that it personifies the national\r\nideals.\" Baron Sonnino was rallying to the House of Karageorgevi['c]\r\nmost of those among the Croats and Slovenes who, for some reason or\r\nother, had been hesitating; for King Peter personified the national\r\nideals which the Baron was endeavouring to throttle. As Mr. Wickham\r\nSteed pointed out in a letter to the _Corriere della Sera_, the complete\r\naccord between Italians and Yugoslavs is not only possible and\r\nnecessary, but constitutes a European interest of the first order; if it\r\nbe not realized, the Adriatic would become not Italian nor Slav, but\r\nGerman; if, on the other hand, it were brought about, then the language\r\nand the culture, the commerce and the political influence of Italy would\r\nnot merely be maintained but would spread along the eastern Adriatic\r\ncoast and in the Balkans in a manner hitherto unhoped for; if no accord\r\nbe reached, then the Italians would see their whole influence vanish\r\nfrom every place not occupied by overwhelming forces. But Sonnino, a\r\ndescendant of rancorous Levantines and obstinate Scots, went recklessly\r\nahead; it made you think that he was one of those unhappy people whom\r\nthe gods have settled to destroy. He neglected the most elementary\r\nprecautions; he ought to have requested, for example, that the French\r\nand British and Americans would everywhere be represented where Yugoslav\r\nterritory was occupied. But, alas, he did not show that he disagreed\r\nwith the _Tribuna's_ lack of wisdom when it said that \"the Italian\r\npeople could never tolerate that beside our flag should fly other\r\nflags, even if friendly, for this would imply a confession of weakness\r\nand incapacity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF THE CHAMBER\r\n\r\nThe Government was in no very strong position, for the Chamber was now\r\nmoribund and the many groups which had been formed, in the effort to\r\ncreate a war Chamber out of one that was elected in the days of peace,\r\nwere now dissolving. An incident towards the end of November exhibited\r\nnot only the contrivances by which these groups hoped to preserve\r\nthemselves, but the eagerness with which the Government rushed to\r\nplacate the powerful. A young deputy called Centurione, a member of the\r\nNational Defence group (the Fascio), made a furious attack on Giolitti,\r\nunder cover of a personal explanation. He had been accused of being a\r\npolice spy. Well, after Caporetto, convinced that the defeat was partly\r\ndue to the work of Socialists and Giolittians, he had disguised himself\r\nas a workman and taken part in Socialist meetings. He was proud to have\r\nplayed the spy for the good of his country, and he finished by accusing\r\nGiolitti and six others of treason. The whole Chamber--his own party not\r\nbeing strongly represented--seems to have made for Centurione who,\r\namidst an indescribable uproar, continued to shout \"Traitor!\" to anyone\r\nwho approached him. Sciorati, one of the accused, was at last able to\r\nmake himself heard. He related how, at Turin, Centurione had made a fool\r\nof himself. (But if Lewis Carroll had been with us still he might have\r\nmade himself immortal.) \"I have seen him disguised,\" said Sciorati, \"as\r\nan out-porter at the door of my own house.\" Giolitti appeared and\r\ndemanded an immediate inquiry, with what was described as cold and\r\nmenacing emphasis. And Orlando, the Prime Minister, flew up to the\r\nChamber and parleyed with Giolitti in the most cordial fashion.\r\nCenturione's documents were at once investigated and no proofs of\r\ntreason were found, no witnesses proposed by him being examined. He was\r\nexpelled from the National Defence group for \"indiscipline,\" his\r\ncolleagues frustrating his attempts to sit next to them by repeatedly\r\nchanging their seats. The attitude of the Fascio was humble and\r\napologetic, and the other significant feature of the incident was the\r\nhaste with which Orlando reacted to Giolitti's demand for an inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nBaron Sonnino had to take into account not only the unsteadiness of the\r\nground on which the Government stood, owing to these parliamentary\r\nregroupings, but the general effects that would ensue from the country's\r\nfinancial position. When, in spite of the victory and the approach of\r\npeace, the exchange price of the lira dropped 2 to 3 points towards the\r\nend of November, this may have had, contrary to what was thought by\r\nmany, no connection with a revolutionary movement. The fact that in\r\nTriest the authorities had been obliged to isolate Italian ex-prisoners\r\non their return from Russia, since they were imbued with revolutionary\r\nprinciples, at any rate were uttering loud revolutionary cries, may have\r\nbeen the mere temporary infection caught from their environment. But\r\nthat of which there was no doubt was the entire truth of Caroti's\r\nstatement when that deputy declared at Milan that while Italy had been\r\ntriumphant in the military sphere, she had been economically overthrown.\r\nBankruptcy had not been announced, though it existed. Sonnino may\r\ntherefore have been impelled not only by imperialism, by his inability\r\nto adjust himself to the new international situation, but by the hope\r\nthat through his policy the new internal situation might be tided over.\r\nIf the thoughts of his fellow-countrymen could be directed elsewhere\r\nthan to bankruptcy and possible revolution, it might be that in the\r\nmeantime adroit measures and good luck would brush away these\r\ndisagreeable phenomena. And he would then be rightly looked upon as one\r\nwho had deserved well of his country. So he set about the task with such\r\na thoroughness that he turned not alone the thoughts of men, but their\r\nheads. Professor Italo Giglioli addressed a letter to _The New Europe_\r\nin which he said that he was claiming now not the territories given by\r\nthe Treaty of London, but considerably more. He wanted all Dalmatia,\r\ndown to Kotor. In foreign hands, he said, Dalmatia would be an eternal\r\ndanger, and besides: \"What in Dalmatia is not Italian is barbaric!\" It\r\nwas a melancholy spectacle to see a man of Giglioli's reputation saying\r\nthat Dubrovnik, the refuge of Slav culture in the age of darkness and\r\nthe place in which Slav literature so gloriously arose, was, forsooth,\r\nthroughout its history always Italian in culture and in literature.\r\n\"Among thinking people in Italy,\" proclaims the Professor, \"there are\r\nindeed but few who will abandon to the Balkan processes a region and a\r\npeople which have always been possessed by Italian culture and which\r\nconstitute the necessary wall of Italy and Western Europe against the\r\ninroads of the half-barbaric East.\" He protests that it is ridiculous of\r\n_The New Europe_ to assert that the secret Treaty of London is supported\r\nby a tiny, discredited band of Italians; and indeed that Review has\r\nregretfully to acknowledge that many of his countrymen have been swept\r\noff their feet and carried onward in the gale of popular enthusiasm.\r\nGiglioli ends by asking that his name be removed from the list of _The\r\nNew Europe's_ collaborators. In vain does the _The New Europe_ say that\r\nthe Professor's programme must involve a war between Italians and\r\nYugoslavs. \"We must be prepared for a new war,\" said the _Secolo_ on\r\nJanuary 12. \"The Italians who absolutely demand the conquest of Dalmatia\r\nmust have the courage to demand that the demobilization of our Army\r\nshould be suspended, and to say so very clearly.\" And the _Corriere\r\ndella Sera_ warned Orlando of the consequences if he took no steps to\r\nsilence the mad voices. \"No one knows better,\" it wrote, \"than the\r\nMinister of the Interior, who is also Premier, that on the other coast\r\nItaly claims that part of Dalmatia which was assigned to her by the\r\nTreaty of London, but not more.... If the Government definitely claims\r\nand demands the whole of Dalmatia, then the agitation is justified; but\r\nif the Government does not demand it, then we repeat that to favour and\r\nnot to curb the movement is the worst kind of Defeatism, for it creates\r\namong Italians a state of mind tending to transform the sense of a great\r\nvictory into the sense of a great defeat ... quite apart from the\r\nintransigeance which this provokes in the Yugoslav camp.\" It was in\r\nvain. And when Bissolati, having resigned from office on the issue of\r\nItalo-Yugoslav relations, attempted to explain his attitude at the Scala\r\nin Milan on January 11, his meeting was wrecked, for though the body of\r\nthe hall and the galleries were relatively quiet, if not very\r\nsympathetic--it was a ticket meeting--the large number of subscription\r\nboxes, which could not be closed to their ordinary tenants, had been\r\npacked by Bissolati's adversaries, who succeeded in preventing him from\r\nspeaking. After a long delay he managed to read the opening passage, but\r\nwhen he came to the first \"renunciation\"--the Brenner for the\r\nTeutons--disturbance set in finally and he left the theatre. Afterwards\r\nthe rioters adjourned to the _Corriere_ and _Secolo_ offices, where they\r\nbroke the windows. And thus the first full statement of the war aims of\r\nany Italian statesman could not be uttered. It was spread abroad by the\r\nPress. Bissolati claimed to speak in the name of a multitude which had\r\nhitherto been silent.... The masses, he said, demanded, that their\r\nrulers should devote all their strength to \"the divine blessing of\r\nfreeing mankind from the slavery of war.\" ... \"To those,\" he said, \"who\r\nspeak of the Society of Nations as an 'ideology' or 'Utopia' which has\r\nno hold over our people, we would reply: Have you been in the trenches\r\namong the soldiers waiting for the attack?\" [Signor Bissolati had the\r\nunique record, among Allied or enemy statesmen, of having volunteered\r\nfor active service, though past the fighting age, and of having served\r\nin the trenches for many months before entering the Orlando Cabinet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOUNTAIN IN THE SAND\r\n\r\nThe speech was an admirable expression of that new spirit which the\r\nAllies had been fighting for. \"Each of the anti-German nations,\" he\r\nsaid, \"must guard itself against any unconsciously German element in its\r\nsoul, if only in order to have the right to combat any trace in others\r\nof the imperialism which had poisoned the outlook of the German people.\"\r\nWith regard to the Adriatic: \"Yugoslavia exists, and no one can undo\r\nthis. But to the credit of Italy be it said, the attainment of unity and\r\nindependence for the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was and must be alike\r\nthe reason and the certain issue of our War.... Italy felt that if\r\nSerbia had been swallowed up by that monstrous Empire--itself a vassal\r\nof the German Empire--her own economic expansion and political\r\nindependence would have received a mortal blow. And so she was on\r\nSerbia's side, first in neutrality, then in intervention.... Those who\r\nonly see, in the formation of the Yugoslav State, a sympathetic or\r\nantipathetic episode of the War, or a subsidiary effect of it, have\r\nfailed to detect its inner meaning.\" As for the Treaty of London which\r\nwas concluded against the enemy, it was not to be regarded as intangible\r\nagainst a friendly people. By special grants of autonomy, as at Zadar,\r\nor by arrangements between the two States, he would see the language and\r\nculture of all the trans-Adriatic sons of Italy assured. He warned his\r\ncountrymen lest, in order to meet the peril of a German-Slav alliance\r\nagainst them, they should have to subordinate themselves to France and\r\nEngland, and be their proteges instead of their real Allies--a situation\r\nnot unlike that of the Triple Alliance when Germany protected them\r\nagainst the ever-imminent attack of Austria.... \"But perhaps the\r\nYugoslavs will not be grateful or show an equal spirit of conciliation?\r\nCertainly they will then have no vital interests to push against Italy,\r\nand in the long run sentiments follow interests.\" There was, in fact,\r\nthroughout the speech only one questionable passage, that in which he\r\nsaid that \"if Italy renounced the annexation of Dalmatia she might\r\nobtain from Yugoslavia or from the Peace Conference the joy of pressing\r\nto her heart the most Italian city of Rieka, which the Treaty of London\r\nrenounced.\" This may have been a sop to Cerberus. But Bissolati's\r\nappeals to justice and to wisdom fell upon the same stony ground as his\r\ndemonstration that Dalmatia's strategic value is very slight from a\r\ndefensive point of view to those who possess Pola, Valona and the outer\r\nislands. There is a school of reasonable Italians, such as Giuseppe\r\nPrezzolini, who for strategic reasons asked for the isle of Vis. Mazzini\r\nhimself, after 1866, found it necessary, for the same reasons, that Vis\r\nshould be Italian, since it is the key of the Adriatic. Some of us\r\nthought that it might have been feasible to follow the precedent of\r\nPort Mahon, which Great Britain occupied without exercising sovereignty\r\nover the rest of the island of Minorca. The magnificent harbour of Vis,\r\nperfectly protected against the bora, would have satisfied all the\r\ndemands of the Italian navy. Vis is to-day practically as much Slav as\r\nMinorca was Spanish, and if the Slavs had been left in possession of the\r\nremainder of that island it would have proved the reverse of a danger to\r\nthe Italians, since with a moderate amount of good sense the same\r\nrelations would have existed as was the case upon Minorca.... The\r\nsolution which was ultimately found in the Treaty of Rapallo was to\r\nallocate to the Italians in complete sovereignty not the island of Vis,\r\nbut the smaller neighbouring island of Lastovo.\r\n\r\nWhile the vast majority of Italians would not listen to Bissolati they\r\ndelighted in Gabriele d'Annunzio. The great poet Carducci[21] had his\r\nheart full when he thought about the ragged, starving Croat soldiers,\r\npitiable victims of the Habsburgs, exploited by them all their lives and\r\nfighting for them in a foreign land--and they fought bravely; but as\r\nthey were often clad in miserable garments, they were called by those\r\nwho wanted to revile them \"Croat dirt.\" And that is what they are to\r\nGabriele d'Annunzio. When the controversies of to-day have long been\r\nburied and when d'Annunzio's works are read, his lovers will be stabbed\r\nby his _Lettera ai Dalmati_. And if the mob had to be told precisely\r\nwhat the Allies are, it did not need a lord of language to dilate upon\r\n\"the thirty-two teeth of Wilson's undecipherable smile,\" to say that the\r\nFrench \"drunk with victory, again fly all their plumes in the wind, tune\r\nup all their fanfares, quicken their pace in order to pass the most\r\nresolute and speedy--and we step aside to let them pass.\" No laurel will\r\nbe added to his fame for having spoken of \"the people of the five meals\"\r\n[the English] which, \"its bloody work hardly ended, reopens its jaws to\r\ndevour as much as it can.\" All Italy resounded with the catchword that\r\nthe Croats had been Austria's most faithful servants, although some\r\nItalians, such as Admiral Millo, as we shall see, when writing\r\nconfidentially, did not say anything so foolish. Very frequently,\r\nhowever, as the Croats noticed, those who had been the most\r\nuncompromising wielders of Austria's despotism were taken on by Italy,\r\nthe new despot. For example, at Split when the mayor and other Yugoslav\r\nleaders were arrested at the beginning of the War, one Francis\r\nMandirazza was appointed as Government Commissary, after having filled\r\nthe political post of district captain (Bezirkshauptmann) which was only\r\ngiven to those who were in the entire confidence of the Government. As\r\nsoon as the Italians had possession of [vS]ibenik they took him into\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE WHO HELD BACK FROM THE PACT OF ROME\r\n\r\n_The New Europe_, whose directors had taken a chief part in bringing the\r\nItalians and the Yugoslavs together, which congress had resulted in the\r\nPact of Rome, of April 1918, pointed out that in those dark days of the\r\nhigh-water mark of the great German offensive, this Pact--which provided\r\nthe framework of an agreement, on the principle of \"live and let\r\nlive\"--was publicly approved of by the Italian Premier and his\r\ncolleagues, but was rejected now when the danger was past and Austria\r\nwas broken up. Those who brought about the Pact reminded Italy that she\r\nwas bound to it by honour and that the South Slav statesmen never had\r\nwithdrawn from the position which it placed them in with reference to\r\nItaly.... Everyone must sympathize with the disappointment of those\r\ngentlemen who--Messrs. Franklin-Bouillon, Wickham Steed and Seton-Watson\r\nwere associated in this endeavour--had striven for a noble end, had\r\nachieved something in spite of many obstacles, and now saw that one\r\nparty simply would not use the bridge which they had built for it. This\r\nparty had, however, shown such reticence both while the bridge was being\r\nmade and afterwards that one could scarcely be astonished at their\r\nattitude. The Congress at Rome was in no sense official, but a\r\nvoluntary meeting of private persons, who were got together with a\r\ncertain amount of trouble. So unofficial, in fact, was the Congress that\r\nthose Serbs who worked with the representatives of the Yugoslav\r\nCommittee belonged to the Opposition; the Serbian Government, then in\r\nCorfu, not giving their adhesion to the Congress, which was perhaps a\r\nvery clever move on the part of Pa[vs]i['c]. Whether it be true or not\r\nthat Signor Amendolla, the General Secretary--he is the political\r\ndirector of the _Corriere della Sera_--was asked by the Yugoslav\r\nCommittee not to admit any Serbian deputies except those of the\r\nOpposition, it appears that no other Serbs took a part in the\r\nproceedings. The Italian Government adopted an ambiguous attitude, for\r\nwhile Orlando publicly endorsed the resolutions, as did several other\r\nMinisters, notably Bissolati, the Premier gave no confirmation to those\r\nwho interpreted his attitude as implying the tacit abandonment of\r\nItaly's extreme territorial claims. Sonnino was so reserved that he took\r\nno share at all in the Congress and refused to receive the Yugoslavs. He\r\nmade no secret of his determination to exact the London Treaty. Nothing\r\nwas signed by the Italian Government; and if Orlando's honour was\r\ninvolved it certainly does not seem possible to say the same of Sonnino.\r\nIt may be that Pa[vs]i['c] foresaw what would happen and was therefore\r\nunwilling to be implicated. He is an astute statesman of the old\r\nschool--\"too old,\" says _The New Europe_, which regards him as an\r\nOriental sultan. But respecting the Pact of Rome they were rather at\r\nissue with the Italians. What the Italians gained was that the various\r\nclauses of the Pact were used as the basis for propaganda in the\r\nAustrian ranks on the Piave. And when once the Austrian peril had\r\nvanished the old rancour reappeared, particularly when, by the terms of\r\nthe military armistice with Austria, Italy obtained the right to occupy\r\na zone corresponding with what she was given by the London Treaty.\r\nWhereas in that instrument the frontiers were exactly indicated, there\r\nwas in the Pact of Rome no more than a general agreement that the\r\nprinciples of nationality and self-determination should be applied, with\r\ndue regard to other \"vital interests.\" Bissolati's group was in favour\r\nof something more definite, but to this Orlando was not well disposed;\r\nand Trumbi['c], the President of the Yugoslav Committee, did not avail\r\nhimself of the, perhaps rather useless, offer of some Serbs who were not\r\nparticipating in the Congress, but suggested that while he worked with\r\nthe Government they would keep in touch with the Bissolati group; even\r\nas Bismarck who would work openly with a Government, and through his\r\nagents with the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING WINDS\r\n\r\nAs the Serbian Society of Great Britain observed in a letter of welcome\r\nwhich they addressed to Baron Sonnino on the occasion of a visit to\r\nLondon, they were convinced \"after a close study and experience of the\r\nSouthern Slav question in all its aspects and some knowledge of the\r\nAdriatic problem as a whole, that there is no necessary or inevitable\r\nconflict between the aspiration of the Southern Slav people towards\r\ncomplete unity and the postulates of Italian national security and of\r\nthe completion of Italian unity; but that, on the contrary, there exist\r\nstrong grounds for Italo-Southern Slav co-operation and friendship.\" The\r\nItalian Government, however, had now got almost their whole country\r\nbehind them, and in the months after the War so many Italians had become\r\nwarlike that they were enchanted with the picture drawn by Gabriele\r\nd'Annunzio: \"And what peace will in the end be imposed on us, poor\r\nlittle ones of Christ? A Gallic peace? A British peace? A star-spangled\r\npeace? Then, no! Enough! Victorious Italy--the most victorious of all\r\nthe nations--victorious over herself and over the enemy--will have on\r\nthe Alps and over her sea the _Pax Romana_, the sole peace that is\r\nfitting. If necessary we will meet the new plot in the fashion of the\r\nArditi [units of volunteers employed on specially dangerous\r\nenterprises], a grenade in each hand and a knife between our teeth.\" It\r\nis true that the other poor little ones of Christ, the Franciscans, who\r\nare greatly beloved by the people of Dalmatia, from whom they are\r\nsprung, have hitherto preached a different _Pax Romana_. The Dalmatian\r\nclergy, who are patriotic, have been rather a stumbling-block in the\r\nway of the Italians. A very small percentage of them--about six in a\r\nthousand--have been anti-national and opportunist. At one place a priest\r\nwhom his bishop had some years ago had occasion to expel, returned with\r\nthe Italian army in November 1918 and informed the bishop that he had a\r\nletter from the Pope which reinstated him, but he refused to show this\r\nletter. He was anxious to preach on the following Sunday; the bishop\r\ndeclined to allow him. Then came unto the bishop the chief of the\r\nItalian soldiery and he said unto him: \"Either thou shalt permit this\r\nman to preach or I will cause thine office to be taken from thee.\"\r\nUnfortunately the bishop yielded, and the sermon, as one would imagine,\r\nwas devoted to the greater glory of the Italians. Sometimes the\r\nItalians, since their occupation, have made a more humorous if not more\r\nsuccessful use of the Church. On Palm Sunday, after the service a number\r\nof peasants, in their best clothes, were walking through a village\r\nholding the usual palm leaves in their hands. They were photographed,\r\nand a popular Italian newspaper printed this as a full-page coloured\r\nillustration. It was entitled: \"Dalmatian Peasants on their way to pay\r\nHomage to Admiral Millo.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy of a grenade in each hand and a knife between the teeth\r\nmakes a powerful appeal to the munition firms. And others who feed the\r\nflame of Italo-Slav hatred are, as Gaetano Salvemini, the\r\nanti-chauvinist, pointed out in the _Unita_ of Florence, those\r\nprofessional gladiators who would lose their job, those agents of the\r\nItalo-German-Levantine capitalism of the Triest Chamber of Commerce who\r\nwant to be rid of the competition of Rieka and think that this can only\r\nbe obtained by annexation, and also those Italian Nationalists who\r\nbelieve that the only path to national greatness is by acquiring\r\nterritory everywhere. No light has come to them from the East; the same\r\narguments which are now put forward by such societies as the \"Pro\r\nDalmatia\" could be heard in Italy before she possessed herself of\r\nTripoli. One heard the same talk of strategic necessities; one heard\r\nthat nearly all the population was waiting with open arms for the\r\nItalians; one heard that from a business point of view nothing could be\r\nbetter; one heard that the Italians without Tripoli would be choked out\r\nof the Mediterranean. And what have been the fruits of the conquest of\r\nTripoli? No economic advantages have been procured, as Prezzolini wrote,\r\nno sociological, no strategic, no diplomatic benefits. A great deal of\r\nmoney was thrown away, a vast amount of energy was wasted, and thousands\r\nof troops have to be stationed permanently in the wilderness. That\r\nexpedition to Tripoli, which was one of the gravest errors of Italian\r\npolitics, was preceded by clouds of forged documents, of absurdities, of\r\npartial extracts out of consular reports, of lying correspondence which\r\nsucceeded in misleading the Italians.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE ITALIANS CLAIMED DALMATIA\r\n\r\n\"The Italian Government,\" said the _Morning Post_,[22] \"is well\r\nqualified to judge of the interests of its own people.\" Here the\r\n_Morning Post_ is not speaking of the Italian Government which dealt\r\nwith Tripoli, but that which has been dealing with Dalmatia. The reasons\r\nwhich have been advanced for an Italian or a partly Italian Dalmatia are\r\ngeographical, botanical, historical, ethnical, military, naval and\r\neconomic. As for the geographical reasons: even in the schools of Italy\r\nthey teach that the Italian natural frontier is determined by the point\r\nof division of the waters of the Alps and that this frontier falls at\r\nPorto Re, a few miles to the south of Rieka--everything to the south of\r\nthat belonging to the Balkan Peninsula. We may note the gallant\r\npatriotism of an Italian cartographer mentioned by Prezzolini; this\r\nworthy has inscribed a map of Dalmatia down to the Narenta with the\r\npleasing words: \"The new natural boundaries of Italy.\" As for the\r\nargument that the flora of Dalmatia resembles that of Italy, this can\r\nequally well be employed by those who would annex Italy to Dalmatia.\r\nHistorically, we have seen that Venice, which held for many years the\r\nseacoast and the islands, did not alter the Slav character of the\r\ncountry. It is not now the question as to whether Venice deserved or did\r\nnot deserve well of Dalmatia, but \"the truth is,\" says M. Emile\r\nHaumant,[23] the learned and impartial French historian, \"the truth is\r\nthat when Marmont's Frenchmen arrived they found the Slav language\r\neverywhere, the Italian by its side on the islands and the coast,\r\nItalian customs and culture in the towns, and also the lively and\r\nsometimes affectionate remembrance of Venice; but nowhere did a\r\nDalmatian tell them that he was an Italian. On the contrary, they all\r\naffirmed that they were brothers of the Slav beyond, in whose\r\nmisfortunes they shared and whose successes they celebrated.\" The\r\nItalians themselves, in achieving their unity, were very right to set\r\naside the undoubted historical claims of the Kingdom of the Two\r\nSicilies, those of the House of Este and those of the Vatican, seeing\r\nthat they were in opposition to the principle of nationality and the\r\nright of a people to determine its own political status. With regard to\r\nthe ethnical reasons, we are flogging another dead horse, as the\r\nstatistics--even those taken during the Italian occupation--prove to the\r\nmeanest intellect; and now the pro-Italians, despairing to make anyone\r\nbelieve that the 97.5 per cent. of the people of Dalmatia are truly\r\nItalians who by some kink in their nature persist in calling themselves\r\nSlavs, have invented a brand new nationality, the Dalmatian, after the\r\nclassic style of the late Professor Jagi['c] who at Vienna, under the\r\npressure of the Austrian Government, began talking of the Bosnian\r\nlanguage in order not to say that it is Serbo-Croat. He was drowned in\r\nlaughter. With respect to the military reasons, the Dalmatian littoral\r\ncannot be defended by a State which is not in possession of the\r\nhinterland. In time of peace a very strong army would be needed; Italy\r\nwould, in fact, have to double her army for the defence of a frontier\r\n700 kilometres long. And in the event of war it would be necessary\r\neither to abandon Dalmatia or to form two armies of operation, one on\r\nthe frontiers of Julian Venetia, the other in Dalmatia, and without any\r\nliaison between them. From the military point of view it is incomparably\r\nmore to the interest of Italy that she should live on friendly terms\r\nwith the people of the eastern shore of the Adriatic than that she\r\nshould maintain there an army out of all proportion to her military and\r\neconomic resources--an army which in time of war would be worse than\r\nuseless, since, as M. Gauvain observes, the submarines, which would find\r\ntheir nesting-places in the islands, would destroy the lines of\r\ncommunication. An Italian naval argument is, that if she had to fight on\r\nthe eastern side of the Adriatic her sailors in the morning would have\r\nthe sun in their eyes; but the Yugoslavs would be similarly handicapped\r\nin the case of an evening battle. With regard to the economic reasons,\r\nthe longitudinal lines will continue to guarantee to the Germans and\r\nMagyars the commercial monopoly of the East, and Italy will perceive\r\nthat she has paid very dearly for a blocked-up window. The sole method\r\nby which Italy can from the Adriatic cause her commerce to penetrate to\r\nthe Balkans is by concluding with a friendly Yugoslavia the requisite\r\ncommercial treaties, which will grow more valuable with the construction\r\nof the lateral railways, running inland from the coast, which Austrians\r\nand Magyars so constantly impeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE TREATY OF LONDON\r\n\r\nIf, then, it is difficult to see where the Italian interests will be\r\nprofited by the possession of Dalmatia, there remains the argument that,\r\nirrespective of the consequences, she must have a good deal of it since\r\nit was allotted to her by the Treaty of London,[24] although the\r\nengagements entered into by Italy, France and Great Britain when they\r\nsigned the Treaty with Germany caused the earlier instrument to be\r\nsubject to revision where its terms had been disregarded. Signor\r\nOrlando, in an interview granted in April 1918 to the _Journal des\r\nDebats_, eagerly insisted that the Treaty had been concluded against the\r\nAustrian enemy, not against the Yugoslav nation; and if this be more\r\nthan a mere phrase it is clear that with the disappearance of\r\nAustria-Hungary the Treaty automatically fell to the ground. By this\r\nTreaty of April 1915, France and Great Britain are bound--if necessary,\r\nby force of arms--to assist Italy in appropriating what, I believe, will\r\nbe acknowledged to be some one else's country, at all events a country\r\nthe vast proportion of whose inhabitants have determined that on no\r\naccount will they come under the Italians. Would it not have been\r\nadvisable if those who signed this document had made a few not very\r\nrecondite researches into eastern Adriatic questions? They must have\r\nfelt some qualms at the cries of indignation and amazement which arose\r\nwhen the provisions of the Treaty were disclosed, for it did not remain\r\na secret very long. They had imagined, on the whole, that as Dalmatia\r\nhad been under alien rulers, Venetian, Austrian and so forth, for so\r\nmany years it really would not matter to them very much if they were\r\ngoverned from Vienna or from Rome. Perhaps a statesman here and there\r\nhad heard that the Dalmatian Diet had petitioned many times since 1870\r\nthat they should be reunited to their brothers of Croatia and Slavonia\r\nin the Triune Kingdom. But all the calculations seem to have been made\r\nupon the basis that Austria-Hungary would survive, as a fairly\r\nformidable Power at any rate. The union of the Southern Slavs was too\r\nremote, and the Italians would be kindly masters. When the howl of\r\nindignation rose, the statesmen seem to have conceived the hope that the\r\nItalians would be generous and wise. The chief blame for the Treaty does\r\nnot rest, however, on the Frenchmen and the Englishmen, but on the\r\nRussians; it was naturally felt that they should be more cognizant of\r\nSlav affairs, and if they were content to sign the Treaty, France and\r\nEngland might well follow their example. When Dr. Zari['c], the Bishop\r\nof Split, saw the former Russian Foreign Minister, M. Sazonov, in Paris\r\nin the spring of 1919, this gentleman was in a state of such dejection\r\nthat the Bishop, out of pity, did not try to probe the matter.\r\n\"Sometimes,\" said Sazonov, \"sometimes the circumstances are too much\r\nopposed to you and you have to act against your inclinations.\"[25] The\r\nFrench and British statesmen gave the Bishop the impression that they\r\nwere ashamed of the Treaty. He read to them in turn a memorandum in\r\nwhich he suggested that the whole Dalmatian question should be left to\r\nthe arbitration of President Wilson, who was well informed, through\r\nexperts, of the local conditions. And was it, in any case, just that an\r\nItalian, both claimant and judge, should sit on the Council of Four, to\r\nwhich no Yugoslav was admitted? To President Wilson the Bishop said,\r\n\"You have come to fight for the just cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe President made no reply.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, a native of the island of Hvar, a great linguist, was a man\r\nwho made you think that a very distinguished mind had entered the body\r\nof the late Cardinal Vaughan. To him the most noticeable features of the\r\nPresident were the clear brow, the mystic eyes and the mouth which\r\nshowed that he stood firmly on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"You have come to work and fight for the peace,\" said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, to fight,\" said Dr. Wilson. \"And I will act with all my\r\nenergy. You,\" he said, \"you must help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will help you,\" said the Bishop, \"with my prayers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Yugoslav Delegation in Paris had, on the authority of the Belgrade\r\nCabinet, suggested that the question should be arbitrated.\r\n\r\n\"The Italians have declined the arbitration,\" said Dr. Zari['c], \"just\r\nas in the War Germany and Austria declined yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe President nodded.\r\n\r\n\"They have committed many disorders in our fair land,\" said the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" said the President.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be asked, why did not Dr. Wilson insist on a just\r\nsettlement of the Adriatic question, taking into his own hands that\r\nwhich Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau were so chary of touching?\r\nThese two statesmen, with the London Treaty hanging over them, wanted\r\nWilson's assent for matters in which British and French interests were\r\nmore directly concerned, while they required Sonnino's co-operation in\r\nthe Treaty with Germany. It would have suited them very well if Wilson\r\nhad taken such energetic steps with Italy that they themselves could,\r\nsuitably protesting to Sonnino, be swept along by the presidential\r\nrighteousness. But Dr. Wilson was disappointing those who had--in the\r\nfirst place because of the lofty language of his Notes--awaited a really\r\ngreat man. He was seen to be out of his depth; strenuously he sought to\r\nrescue his Fourteen Points and to steer the Covenant of the League\r\nthrough the rocks and shallows of European diplomacy. Sonnino, playing\r\nfor time, involved the good Wilson in a maze of confused negotiations,\r\nwhile nearly every organ of Italian official and unofficial opinion was\r\ndefaming the President. On April 15 Dr. Wilson in a memorandum suggested\r\nthe famous \"Wilson Line\" in Istria, which thrust the Italian frontier\r\nwestwards, so that Rieka should be safeguarded from the threat of an\r\nItalian occupation of Monte Maggiore. Italy was to give up northern\r\nDalmatia and all the islands, save Lussin and Vis; in return she was to\r\nbe protected by measures limiting the naval and military powers of\r\nYugoslavia. When Wilson appealed over the head of the Italian Government\r\nto the people, their passions had been excited to such a degree that\r\nmuch more harm was done than good. It is said that he had promised\r\nMessrs. Lloyd George and Clemenceau that he would not publish his letter\r\nfor three hours, but that--pride of authorship triumphing over\r\nprudence--it was circulated to the Press two hours before this time was\r\nup, and a compromise which had been worked out by Mr. Lloyd George had\r\nperforce to be abandoned. This was one of the occasions when the\r\nPresident's impulsiveness burst out through his cold exterior, when his\r\nstrength of purpose, his grim determination to fight for justice were\r\nundermined by his egotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN HOPES IN MONTENEGRO\r\n\r\nFor months the Italians had been consoling themselves with the thought\r\nthat such a hybrid affair as Yugoslavia would never really come into\r\nexistence. Some visionaries might attempt to join the Serbs and Croats\r\nand Slovenes, yet these must be as rare as Blake, who testified that\r\n\"when others see but the dawn coming over the hill, I see the sons of\r\nGod shouting for joy.\" One only had to listen, one could hear already\r\nhow they were growling, how they were quarrelling, how they were killing\r\neach other. In Montenegro, for example, and Albania the Italians were\r\ngreatly interested--not always as spectators. If you tell a hungry\r\nMontenegrin peasant in the winter that there is a chance of his\r\nobtaining flour and--well, that he may have to fight for it, but he will\r\nget good booty at Cetinje, he will go there. In January 1919 there was a\r\nbattle. \"The Montenegrin people rose in rebellion against the Serbians\r\nto recover their independence,\" said an Italian writer, one Dr. Attilio\r\nTamaro in a weekly paper called _Modern Italy_, which was published in\r\nLondon. \"This intensely popular revolt, animated by the heroically\r\npatriotic spirit of the Montenegrins, was relentlessly suffocated in\r\nblood. In the little city of Cetinje alone, where there are but a few\r\nthousand inhabitants, over 400 were killed and wounded. The Serbians and\r\nthe French together accomplished this sanguinary repression. We repeat,\r\nit is painful to see the French lend their men, their blood and their\r\nglorious arms to the carrying out of the low intrigues of Balkan\r\npolitics.\" The money and the arms that were found on the dead and\r\ncaptured rebels were Italian. If the schemes of the Italians had not\r\nbeen upset by the timely arrival of the Yugoslav forces, with the few\r\nFrenchmen, they would have occupied Cetinje and restored the traitor\r\nking. As it was, they occupied Antivari, from which place they smuggled\r\narms and munitions into the country. They conspired with the adherents\r\nof the old regime, a very small body of men who were enormously alarmed\r\nat the loss of their privileged position. The chief of them was Jovan\r\nPlamenac, a former Minister whom the people at Podgorica had refused to\r\nhear, a few weeks previously, when he attempted to address them. He was\r\nhated on account of the most ruthless fashion in which, as Minister, he\r\nhad executed certain of his master's critics at Kola[vs]in. There was a\r\ntime, during the first Balkan War, when he advocated union with Serbia\r\nand on April 6, 1916, he wrote in the _Bosnische Post_ of Sarajevo that\r\nNikita, owing to his flight, \"may be regarded as no longer existing.\"\r\nBut his unpopularity remained and, with vengeance burning in his heart,\r\nhe went from Podgorica to the Italians. They concocted a nice plan--he\r\nwas to raise an army of his countrymen and the Italians would bring\r\ntheir garrison from Scutari. On January 1 Plamenac and his partisans\r\ntried to seize Virpazar, on the Lake of Scutari--the Commandant of the\r\nItalian troops at Scutari, one Molinaro, had asked the chief of the\r\nAllied troops, three days before this attempt, whether he might dispatch\r\ntwo companies to that place for the purpose of suppressing the disorders\r\nwhich had not yet come to pass. Another rising was engineered at\r\nCetinje, where twenty or thirty of the poor peasants who had let\r\nthemselves be talked over by Plamenac were killed; the rest of the\r\nmisguided fellows were sent home, only their leaders being detained.\r\nPlamenac himself escaped to Albania.[26] On the side of the Montenegrin\r\nProvisional Government no regular troops were available, as the Yugoslav\r\nsoldiers who had lately arrived were engaged in policing other parts of\r\nthe country. Volunteers were needed and a body of young men, mostly\r\nstudents, enrolled themselves. They were so busy that they omitted to\r\ninform Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P., that they really were Montenegrin\r\nstudents. That indignant gentleman insists that they were Serbs, armed\r\nwith French and British rifles, against which, he tells us (in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_, January 1921) the insurgents could not do much.\r\nEleven of these volunteers were killed and they were buried underneath\r\nthe tree where Nikita used to administer his brand of justice. All kinds\r\nof incriminating documents were found upon the dead and captured rebels,\r\nas also a significant letter from the Italian Minister accredited to\r\nNikita, which was addressed to the chancellor of the Italian Legation at\r\nCetinje. An inter-Allied Commission, over which General Franchet\r\nd'Esperey presided, issued their report on February 8 at Podgorica. \"All\r\nthe troops,\" it said, \"in Montenegro are Yugoslavs and not Serbs; there\r\nare not more than 500 of them.\" It further stated that the rebellion had\r\nbeen provoked by certain agents of the ex-King, assisted by some Italian\r\nagents. As for the ridiculous Italian charge which I quoted, accusing\r\nthe French of a share in the low intrigues of Balkan politics, this\r\nparticipation consisted in their General at Kotor demanding of\r\nDarkovi['c], the leader of the Montenegrin deputies, that his followers\r\nand the rebels should not come to blows. The reply, which annoyed the\r\nGeneral, was to the effect that if the rebels made an attack, then\r\nDarkovi['c] with his scratch forces would defend himself--and the battle\r\nlasted for two or three days. A junior French officer, who had been in\r\ncommand of a small detachment at Cetinje, told me that the noise of\r\nfiring had awakened him every night and he had not the least idea what\r\nit was all about. But the French had a pretty accurate idea of the\r\nnationality of the \"brigands\" who on December 29 fired on the SS.\r\n_Skroda_ and _Satyre_ near the village of Samouritch when it was\r\ncarrying a cargo of flour up the Bojana for the Montenegrins. These\r\nvessels were sailing under the French flag and the \"brigands,\" about\r\nfifty in number, were armed with machine guns. An International\r\nCommission established these facts, as also that the Italian ship\r\n_Vedeta_ passed up the river just before the outrage and the _Mafalda_\r\njust after it, and neither of them was molested. In consequence of what\r\noccurred and as practically all the supplies for Montenegro had at that\r\ntime to be sent by the Bojana, General Dufour, in the absence of French\r\ntroops, authorized the Serbs on February 12 to occupy the commanding\r\nposition of Tarabosh.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAD LATELY BEEN THE FATE OF THE AUSTRIANS THERE\r\n\r\nThese Yugoslav troops had been detached from the left wing of the\r\nSalonica forces and had come overland in order to deal with the\r\nsituation in Montenegro. The Austrians had been in a woeful plight; it\r\nwas regarded as a punishment to serve in Montenegro and Albania, not\r\nonly because of the lack of amenities and the unruly spirit of the\r\npeople, but also for the reason that the officers who came there--many\r\nmanaged to avoid it--were too often causes of dissatisfaction. More\r\ncomplaints had gone up from this front than from any other. The supplies\r\nallotted by the High Command in Austria were ample, as the Rieka depots\r\ntestified, but a great deal did not reach its proper destination. Some\r\nofficers took down their wives or other ladies, loading up the army\r\nmotor-cars with luxuries of food and grand pianos, while the men were\r\nforced to tramp enormous distances; if anyone fell out, the natives in\r\nAlbania would emerge from where they had been hiding and would deprive\r\nthe wretched man of his equipment and his clothing, and perhaps his\r\nlife. The sanitary section of that Austrian army was not good; it\r\nhappened frequently that victims of malaria and wounded men were told to\r\nwalk--if they arrived, so much the better. These poor fellows did not\r\nknow that if they ultimately got back to Vienna they might be the\r\nobjects of Imperial solicitude--the least to be dreaded was the Archduke\r\nSalvator, who was wont to come to a hospital, with his wife, and to\r\nbestow on every man a coloured picture-postcard of their Imperial and\r\nRoyal persons, with a sentence printed underneath respecting their\r\npaternal and maternal love; it was officially reported in Vienna, of\r\nanother hospital, that those who lay there had been spending \"happy\r\nhours\" in \"the circle of the exalted Family\"--this referred to the\r\nArchduchess Maria Immaculata, whose compositions for the piano are said\r\nto be beyond all criticism; she herself did not play them, but would sit\r\nthere while they were inflicted by a courtier on the helpless men. Not\r\nvery enviable was the lot of those Magyar officers who were taken to\r\nthat hospital in Buda-Pest over which the Archduchess Augusta, a\r\nstrikingly ugly woman, presided. It was a regulation that no wounds were\r\nallowed to be dressed until the Archduchess, arrayed in uniform and\r\narmed with a revolver, made her appearance of an evening. The officers\r\nwere told that it was etiquette for them to broach a pleasant\r\nconversation with their benefactress. But the most dangerous Habsburg\r\nwas the Archduchess Blanka, who was interested in medicine; she had\r\nthought out for herself a remedy which human ailments never would\r\nwithstand, but which was more especially effective in cases of\r\ntuberculosis, of malaria and of kidney diseases. At the hospital in the\r\nKirchstetterngasse she had a ward entirely devoted to kidneys. Her\r\ntreatment consisted in hot bandages of corn-flowers; the patients were\r\npacked in these bandages and that was all that was done to them. With\r\nregard to the diet, there were no particular regulations. Some of the\r\nmen were sent from there to another and less original hospital, but it\r\nwas often too late.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND OF THE NATIVES\r\n\r\nThe Montenegrins who had been for so long--some of them for three\r\nyears--leading a congenial life among their rocks, descending now and\r\nthen to kill an Austrian and to gather booty, were most active when the\r\nill-starred Imperial army was retiring. Six hundred Austrians, for\r\ninstance, took the road from Kola[vs]in with the intention of marching\r\nto Lieva Rieka, a distance of 45 kilometres. Thirty-five of them arrived\r\nthere. Thus the population avenged such incidents as the hanging by the\r\nAustrian authorities of the brother of the ex-Minister General\r\nVe[vs]ovi['c],[27] the General having taken to the hills and his brother\r\nbeing executed by way of reprisal. The Austrians had now to pay the\r\npenalty of ruthlessness; on September 1, 1917, Count Clam Martini['c],\r\nthe Military Governor, issued Order No. 3110 which stated that: \"In\r\nconsequence of the recent inquiry having revealed the fact that\r\ntelegraph and telephone wires have been cut by civilians, we make the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Persons caught red-handed in acts of sabotage will be\r\n     summarily shot, their houses will be razed to the ground and\r\n     their property confiscated by the Military Administration\r\n     Authorities.\r\n\r\n     \"2. If the author of the outrage cannot be found, the\r\n     procedure will be as follows:--\r\n\r\n       \"(_a_) The commune where the act of sabotage has taken place\r\n       will be condemned to a heavy fine. If the sum demanded is not\r\n       paid within forty-eight hours, the cattle will be seized.\r\n\r\n       \"(_b_) Hostages will be taken who, if the cases of sabotage\r\n       are repeated, will be executed in their commune.\"\r\n\r\nLife under the Austrians had become unendurable. Typhoid fever, marsh\r\nfever, typhus and dysentery assumed such proportions that in the towns\r\nand villages one saw--apart from such notices as Order No. 3110--no\r\nother bills posted up on the walls but those containing advice as to the\r\ncorrect way of nursing the sick. While poor wretches were dying of\r\nhunger in the hospitals and on the high road for want of bread, the\r\nauthorities published a recipe for the making of wheat-butter, which was\r\na recent discovery of German science, reputed to be very nourishing for\r\ndebilitated organisms. But the price of a kilo (2 lb.) of wheat was 12\r\ncrowns (about 10s.). When the epidemic of typhus, which broke out in\r\nCetinje and in the Njegu[vs] clan, reached alarming proportions and\r\nspread to other districts, the medical authorities advertised that\r\nhousehold effects and linen should be washed with water and potatoes. A\r\nkilo of potatoes, in the autumn of 1917, cost a price equivalent to 6s.,\r\na quart of oil cost L2, 10s., a quart of milk 5s., a kilo of coffee L2,\r\n18s. 4d., a yard of cloth L4, 4s. to L6, 6s., a pair of boots L8, 7s. An\r\naverage of 200 persons--mainly women and children--were dying every day\r\nof starvation.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian army in retreat was incapable of action. It occupied a line\r\neast of Podgorica: Bioce-Tuzi-Lake of Scutari, with very few guns. The\r\ntroops were scanty, they were weakened by malaria, etc.; but the\r\nItalians pursued them with great caution. The chief enemies were\r\nAlbanians and Montenegrins. The wily Austrians gave rifles to the\r\nAlbanians in order that they should attack the Montenegrins, but they\r\nwere often used against their former owners. Then the contingents of the\r\nSalonica army came across the mountains, and when the Austrians went\r\nnorth, as best they could, the Yugoslavs of the Imperial and Royal\r\narmy--Bosniaks were well represented--pinned on their tunics the\r\nnational colours and were greeted by the inhabitants. Arriving at\r\nCetinje they heard the incredible news that a Yugoslav State had been\r\nfounded, that the Austrian navy had been handed over to the Yugoslavs,\r\nthat French and Italians were already at Kotor. During the journey to\r\nthat port the commanders were depressed, but the rank and file rejoiced\r\nat the idea of going home. Discipline was at an end. Thousands of\r\nrockets were fired into the air. It was the end of the Habsburg\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW NIKITA IS DEPOSED\r\n\r\nThe next thing for the Montenegrins to do was to depose Nikita. By a\r\nfutile proclamation that personage had tried in October to resist the\r\nunion of the Yugoslavs; he had made a last desperate attempt to save his\r\ncrown. \"I am ready to do,\" he said, \"what my people desires.\" He\r\nplaintively protested that all his life had been dedicated to their\r\nservice and now he wanted to go back to ascertain precisely what they\r\nwished. \"Montenegro,\" he had said, \"belongs to a nation of heroes, who\r\nfought with honour for the highest ideals.\" But when on November 24 the\r\nGreat National Skup[vs]tina met, and when on the 26th it unanimously\r\ndeposed him--the old gentleman was wise enough to follow the advice of\r\nsome French statesmen and remain where he was. \"Here am I amongst you,\r\ndressed in our beautiful national costume,\" he said at Neuilly to his\r\nsupporters, on one of the occasions when he denied that he had been a\r\ntraitor or anything so dreadful. But being a prudent old gentleman he\r\nrefrained from uttering these words at Podgorica, where the Skup[vs]tina\r\nhad met; a better plan was to communicate with the Press Association, in\r\nthe hope that many editors would print his words. If it was a final\r\nanti-climax for a mediaeval prince--ah well, what is life but one long\r\nanti-climax? He would protest against the constitution of the\r\nSkup[vs]tina. He had by no means given his approval to the new election\r\nlaws; and if, contrary to his own practice, the gendarmes were having\r\nnothing to do with the urns, that was merely in order to curry favour\r\nwith the Western Powers. The deputies were chosen by the people\r\nindirectly--that is to say, every ten men elected a representative, and\r\nthese in their turn elected the deputies. This was not done by ballot,\r\nfor Montenegro, like Hungary, had never known the ballot. An absurd\r\noutcry was raised by Nikita's band of adventurers and their unhappy\r\ndupes in this country; they called the world to witness this most\r\npalpable iniquity on the part of the Serbs, whose armed forces had\r\nrushed across the mountains, and the moment they arrived in Montenegro\r\nhad so overawed the population that this pro-Serb, pro-Yugoslav\r\nSkup[vs]tina was duly chosen. Go to! Of course it was a sad\r\ndisappointment to Nikita that a Yugoslav instead of an Italian army\r\nshould occupy Montenegro. He had telegraphed at the beginning of the War\r\nto Belgrade that: \"Serbia may rely on the brotherly and unconditional\r\nsupport of Montenegro, in this moment on which depends the fate of the\r\nSerbian nation, as well as on any other occasion\"; and since he knew,\r\nwithout any telegram, that Serbia would in her turn support\r\nMontenegro--but not the tiny pro-Nikita faction--he was reduced to the\r\nappalling straits of a plot to force himself upon his own people by\r\nmeans of a foreign army. Now the composition of the aforementioned\r\nYugoslav forces should be noted--after more than six years of heroic\r\nfighting against the Turks, the Bulgars, the Austro-Germans, the\r\nAlbanian blizzards, and again the Bulgars and the Austro-Germans there\r\ndid not survive a very large number of the splendid veterans of Marshal\r\nMi[vs]i['c], and in Macedonia the ranks were filled by Yugoslav\r\nvolunteers from the United States. Many of these Yugoslavs (over half of\r\nthem Dalmatians and Bosnians) were included, in the army which entered\r\nMontenegro. The whole force at the time of the National Skup[vs]tina\r\nconsisted of about 200 men, ten of whom were Serbs from the old\r\nkingdom--and if anyone maintains that 200 men could impose their will\r\nupon a population of 350,000 which has arms enough and is skilful in the\r\nuse of arms, he makes it clear that he knows little of the Montenegrins.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSEMBLY WHICH DEPOSED HIM\r\n\r\nThe Podgorica Skup[vs]tina was not elected by these troops. No one will\r\npretend that in the excitement of those days the voting was conducted in\r\na calm and methodical fashion. Here and there a dead man was elected;\r\nthe proceedings--though they were not faked, as in Nikita's time--were\r\nrough-and-ready. But if the deputies had been selected in a more\r\nhaphazard fashion, say according to the first letter of their surnames,\r\nthe result would have been identical--they would, with a crushing\r\nmajority, have deposed their King and voted for the merging of their\r\ncountry in the rest of Yugoslavia. If the former Skup[vs]tina had been\r\nconvoked, as some people advocated--it would have most effectively\r\nnonplussed the pro-Nikita party here and elsewhere (it might even have\r\nsilenced Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P., who asserted[28] that this \"packed\r\nassembly\" consisted of \"Serbian subjects and bought agents in about\r\nequal numbers\")--but then two-fifths of the country--those territories\r\nacquired in the Balkan War--would not have been represented. Observe,\r\nhowever, that the Skup[vs]tina in Nikita's time was for union with\r\nSerbia. Even then--although of the 76 deputies the king nominated 14,\r\nwhile the other 62, of course, were people whom he pretty well approved\r\nof--even then they had passed resolutions in favour of an economic\r\nunion, a common army and common representatives abroad. The Podgorica\r\nParliament had 168 members, of whom 42 were from the new areas. The\r\nConstitution did not provide for such an assembly; but Nikita's friends\r\nwho clamoured for the Constitution evidently had forgotten that under\r\nArticles 2 and 16 a king who deserts his country and people is declared\r\nto have forfeited his legal rights. Those foolish partisans who cried\r\nthat it was monstrous not to wait until all the interned Montenegrins\r\nhad come back from Austria and Hungary, may be reminded of Nikita's Red\r\nCross parcels which these prisoners had refused to take. Moreover,\r\ncertain of them were elected, after their arrival, as vacancies\r\noccurred, and they were also represented among the dozen deputies whom\r\nthe Skup[vs]tina chose for the Belgrade Parliament. No disorders\r\nhappened during the elections, the best available men were chosen--76 of\r\nthem having enjoyed a university education. It is worthy of remark that\r\nwhile 20 of the Podgorica deputies had sat in Nikita's former\r\nparliaments, another 150 of these ex-deputies survive, and yet out of\r\nthe total number of past and present deputies (_i.e._ over 300), only 15\r\ndeclared for a kind of autonomy, but were in favour of Yugoslav union.\r\nThe Metropolitan of Cetinje, the Bishops and five of the six pre-war\r\nPremiers gave their unreserved support to the new regime. With them was\r\nthe Queen's brother, the Voivoda Stephen Vukoti['c], a grand-looking\r\npersonage who has remained all his life a poor man; he was questioned by\r\nGeneral Franchet d'Esperey as to whether he had also voted against his\r\nbrother-in-law. \"If I had seven heads and on each of them a crown,\"\r\nanswered the Voivoda, \"I would give them all for the union of the\r\nSouthern Slavs.\" ... Where was the opposition to Yugoslavia? \"The Black\r\nMountain,\" said Nikita at Neuilly--\"the Black Mountain, as well as her\r\nnational King, has always pursued the same path, the only one leading to\r\nthe realization of our sacred ideal--that of National Unity.\" One might\r\nobject that a national King should really not have written to his\r\ndaughter Xenia on October 19, 1918, that he would propose a republic for\r\nall the Serbs and Yugoslavs, with the abdication of the two kings and\r\nthe two dynasties. He added that the Serbs were not ripe for a republic,\r\nbut that in advanced circles his suggestion would be enthusiastically\r\nreceived, and in a short time he would reap the benefit. \"That,\" he\r\nwrote, \"is my impression--it may be that I am wrong--but I do not know\r\nwhat else I can do.\" And a truly national King--but the world, as\r\nSophocles remarked, is full of wonders, and nothing is more wonderful\r\nthan man--a truly national King should not have supported those twenty\r\nMontenegrins who in the summer of 1919 assembled at the monastery of\r\nDe[vc]ani with the design of establishing a Bol[vs]evik republic. Before\r\nthe Yugoslav troops could reach the spot these men were surrounded by\r\nAlbanians and overpowered, so that another wild dream of the old\r\nintriguer was dissipated.... When Mr. Leiper, the _Morning Post's_ acute\r\nrepresentative, was in Montenegro during the summer of 1920 he found\r\nonly one person in three weeks who pined for the return of Nikita.\r\n\"Presently,\" he says, \"we were accosted by an ancient, wild-looking\r\n'pope,' with a face rugged and stormy as the crags among which he lived,\r\nand long, straggling hair tied in behind by an old leather boot-lace....\r\nThe talk turned to politics. My friend wailed over times and morals.\r\nFood was scarce, the wicked flourished like green bay trees, honest\r\nfolks were oppressed, starved, neglected; for example, his own self that\r\nsat before me--would I believe it?--after forty years' service he had\r\nnot so much as attained the dignity of Archimandrate.... They were a\r\nrascal lot, those at present in power, ripe for hanging, every man-jack\r\nof them. And oh for the days of good King Nicholas, who would have given\r\nthem short shrift!\" Mr. Leiper subsequently learned that Nikita's\r\npanegyrist had spent his life in the wilds of Macedonia, where he acted\r\nas agent and decoy of the then Montenegrin Government. One murder, at\r\nleast, for which he received a good sum of money, could be laid to his\r\ncharge. Now he was living in retirement, hoping no doubt for better\r\ndays, and meanwhile winked at by the tolerant authorities.\r\n\r\nAfter the assembling of the Podgorica Parliament a proclamation was\r\nissued by the joyous Montenegrins at Cetinje. \"Montenegrins!\" it began,\r\n\"the great and bloody fight of the most terrible world war is over!\r\nDespotism has been smothered, freedom has come, right has triumphed....\r\nMontenegrin arms and the heroic deeds of our Homeland have distinguished\r\nthemselves for centuries. The fruits of these great deeds and colossal\r\nsacrifices our people must realize in a great and happy Yugoslavia....\r\nLet us reject all attempts which may be made to deprive us of our happy\r\nfuture and put us in a position of blind and miserable isolation\r\nhenceforth to work and weep in sorrow.... Before us lie two paths. One\r\nis strewn with the flowers of a blessed future, the other is covered\r\nwith dangerous and impenetrable brambles.\" If any disinterested and\r\nintelligent foreigner, say a Chinaman, had been asked whether he thought\r\nthat it was more to the advantage of Montenegro that she, like Croatia,\r\nBosnia and the rest, should merge herself in the Yugoslav State or\r\nwhether he considered that the sort of federation which the ex-King had\r\nsuggested would assist more efficaciously the welfare--social,\r\neconomical and national--of the Montenegrin, he would not have thanked\r\nyou for asking so superfluous a question.... Nikita then asserted that\r\nthose terrible Serbian bayonets had caused the Podgorica Skup[vs]tina to\r\nvote as it did. Anyone who has spoken to one of those Bocchesi or\r\nDalmatian volunteers who were at that time in Montenegro will quite\r\nbelieve that they applauded the result, but to pretend that they drove\r\nthe Skup[vs]tina with bayonets to do what every reasoning creature would\r\nhave done is so farcical that one might have thought it would not even\r\nform (as it did form) the subject for questions in the British House of\r\nCommons.... The only part played by bayonets was when on November 7 (one\r\nday previous to that fixed for the elections) a detachment of the\r\nItalian army landed at Antivari and another marched to within about six\r\nkilometres of Cetinje, where they were met by the Montenegrin National\r\nGuard, were told that bigger forces, which it was difficult to restrain,\r\nwould shortly arrive and were given one hour in which to depart. Of this\r\nthey availed themselves, announcing that they were all Republicans. They\r\nleft behind them an elderly man who was sick and requested the\r\nMontenegrins not to murder him. The Italians and Nikita's friends soon\r\nafterwards spread a report of horrible murders in Montenegro. Certain\r\nAllied officers went up to investigate the matter and found that the\r\ncharges were baseless. They were told by Mr. Gloma[vz]ic, the prefect of\r\nCetinje, that the Allies, apart from the Italians, could go anywhere in\r\nMontenegro, but that the Italians would be opposed by force of arms and\r\nthat if the Allies came up together with the Italians, then they too\r\nwould be attacked. Thereupon the Allied officers invited Mr. Gloma[vz]ic\r\nto lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIKITA'S SORROW FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS\r\n\r\nNikita had no hopes that any good would come from such a Skup[vs]tina.\r\nIn 1912 it had been different; with a budget of some 6,200,000 perpers\r\n(or francs), including the Russian subsidies and the revenues from the\r\nItalian tobacco monopoly, the royal civil-list comprised 11 per cent. of\r\nthe expenses, while the police accounted for 12 per cent., agriculture\r\nand commerce 11/2 per cent., public works 4 per cent. and education 5\r\nper cent. The Skup[vs]tina of that period had not caused him to pay more\r\nattention to the people's requirements. The darkness in which they lived\r\nwas so profound that when Montenegro had to pay the interest on a\r\nsix-million-franc loan from Great Britain no one in Cetinje could\r\ncalculate how much was due; a telegram was therefore sent to London\r\nasking for this information and the date when payment should be made. If\r\nhis people did not prevent him from allocating merely 11,000 francs to\r\nthe Ministry of Justice for the increase of salaries and so forth, while\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior received 700,000 francs for the work of\r\nspying, the expense of killing people and various propaganda--both these\r\nitems being labelled \"special expenses\"--then Nikita had no fault to\r\nfind with his Skup[vs]tina. Things were almost as satisfactory as before\r\n1907, when for the first time a budget was issued and the people were\r\ntold how their contributions were spent. The personal property of the\r\nsovereign had indeed been formally separated from that of the State in\r\n1868; but Nikita's manipulations were so little supervised that, even\r\nwhen he had established the Skup[vs]tina, he could say with truth,\r\n\"L'etat c'est moi.\" The Skup[vs]tina of 1918 was going to make vast\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF BOSNIA\r\n\r\nIn Bosnia, for some time after the Austrian collapse, it was\r\ninconvenient to travel. If you went by rail you were fortunate if you\r\nsecured a good berth on the roof of a carriage; by road you went less\r\nrapidly and therefore ran a greater risk of being waylaid by the\r\nso-called \"Green Depot,\" who were deserters from the Austrian\r\narmy--either through national or other reasons--with their headquarters\r\nin the forests. Some of them were simply men who had gone home on leave\r\nand stayed at home. Here and there a National Guard of peaceful\r\ncitizens, irrespective of nationality, was formed against them. But it\r\nwas some time before they were induced to lead a less romantic life.\r\nWhat happened afterwards in Bosnia between the Serbs, the Croats and the\r\nMoslems was so much a matter of routine that the Italians should not\r\nhave run off with the idea that this imperilled Yugoslavia. Of the\r\n1,898,044 inhabitants in 1910 the proportions were as follows: Orthodox,\r\nwho call themselves Serbs, 43.49 per cent.; Moslem, 32.25 per cent.; and\r\nCatholics, who call themselves Croats, 22.87 per cent. (The remainder\r\nare miscellaneous persons, such as 850,000 Jews, who speak the usual\r\nBalkan Spanish; they play an inconsiderable part in public life.) The\r\nSerbs, the Moslems and the Croats are identical in race and language,\r\nbut have hitherto been much divided. Those who joined together in the\r\nTurkish days were led to do so as companions in distress; the rule of\r\nAustria, or to speak with greater accuracy the rule of Hungary--no one\r\nknew exactly who possessed the land, but the Magyars took it for granted\r\nthat it was theirs--this rule, of course, did nothing to unite the\r\nvarious religions. The Moslems, especially after their complete\r\nisolation from Turkey, were the most favoured, while the Serbs, owing to\r\nthe proximity of Serbia, were the most oppressed. And during the War it\r\nwas the Serbian population which was chiefly tortured. Besides all those\r\nwho were dragged away to such places as Arad, hundreds and hundreds were\r\nhanged in their own province. Not satisfied with using, as we see in so\r\nmany of those ghastly photographs, their own army as the executioners,\r\nthe Austro-Hungarians also organized local bands among the lower classes\r\nof the towns, and in so doing they availed themselves of any latent\r\nreligious fanaticism among the Moslems. From the day of the Archduke's\r\nassassination it was the Serbs who suffered most; and many onlookers\r\nmust have expected in the autumn of 1918 that they would take a very\r\ndrastic revenge. For some weeks the people were left very much to their\r\nown devices, with no troops or police--the Austrian _gendarmerie_ having\r\nto be protected by the better classes, who explained to the peasants\r\nthat it was not right to regard only the uniform of those who had so\r\noften maltreated them; yet the gendarmes took the earliest opportunity\r\nof getting into mufti. There was also for several months a dearth of\r\ndetectives. Many of those who had worked under Austria and were more or\r\nless criminal, fled at the collapse; others continued to act, but in a\r\nhalf-hearted way. Sixty new detectives were taken on by the Yugoslav\r\nauthorities, and fifty-six of them had to be dismissed. After all, if\r\none can judge a person's character from his face, the detective who\r\nallowed you to do so would be so incompetent as not to warrant a trial.\r\nAnd after six or seven months of Yugoslav administration only\r\nthirty-three out of fifty-two detective appointments in Sarajevo had\r\nbeen definitely filled. So there was not much restriction on the\r\npeasants in their dealings with each other. A few of them were murdered.\r\nIn Sarajevo the National Guard was largely composed of well-meaning\r\nstreet boys; the Serbian troops did not arrive until November 6, and in\r\nmany parts of Bosnia not until the end of the month. And yet in the\r\nwhole country, with people on the track of those who in the pay of\r\nAustria had denounced or murdered their relatives, and with the poor\r\n_kmet_ at last able to rise against the oppressive landlord, there were\r\nin the first six months under fifty murders, and these were mostly due\r\nto the desperate straits of the Montenegrins, who came across the\r\nfrontier in search of provisions, during which forays they assassinated\r\nvarious people. In the Sandjak of Novi Bazar there was no doubt less\r\nsecurity; but to anyone who knew, say the Rogatica district, under\r\nAustria's very capable administration, it will seem that Bosnia, after\r\nthe collapse, was singularly tranquil. Anyhow the population, in the\r\nsummer of 1919, were living on much more amicable terms with one another\r\nthan for many years. The Government met with some criticism, for it was\r\nalleged to be reserving all the lucrative appointments for the Serbs;\r\none had to take into account, however, that it was the Serbs who had\r\nbeen chiefly ruined by the War, and it was just that the concessions for\r\nthe sale of tobacco, for the railway restaurants and so forth, should\r\nbe, for the greater part, given to them. Nevertheless it may interest\r\ntravellers to know that the restaurateurs at the stations of Ilid[vz]e\r\nand Zenica are Catholics--the Moslems are not yet very competent in such\r\naffairs. They are, as their own leaders sadly confess, the least\r\ncultured and the least progressive class. As elsewhere in Islam there\r\nhas been a total lack of female education--the mothers of the Sarajevo\r\nMoslem _intelligentsia_ can neither read nor write, while their sons are\r\ncultivated people who speak several languages. A change is being\r\nmade--there are already five Moslem lady teachers employed in the mixed\r\nGovernment schools; this a few years ago would have been thought\r\nimpossible. It is to be deplored that these divisions into Moslem and\r\nOrthodox and Catholic should be perpetrated--the Moslem leaders look\r\nforward to the time, in a few years, when their deputies will no longer\r\ngroup themselves apart on account of their religion; but it is unwise to\r\nintroduce too many simultaneous innovations, considering that the\r\nilliterates of Bosnia number about 90 per cent. of the population. The\r\nYugoslav idea will prosper in this country; and, by the way, while you\r\nmeet an occasional Serb who hankers for a Greater Serbia, an occasional\r\nCroat who would like a Greater Croatia, the Moslems have no aspirations\r\nsave for Yugoslavia. [They speak of \"our language,\" since the word\r\n\"Serbian\" has for them too much connection with the Orthodox religion,\r\nthe word \"Croatian\" with Roman Catholicism.] They are not indifferent to\r\nthe fact that to their own 600,000 in Bosnia they will add the 400,000\r\nof Macedonia and Old Serbia, together with the 200,000 of Montenegro and\r\nthe Sandjak.... One was inclined to think that the least desirable\r\nperson of the new era in Sarajevo was the editor of the _Srpski Zora_\r\n(\"Serbian Dawn\"); his methods had a resemblance to those of Lenin, for\r\nhe printed lists of persons whom he called upon the Government to\r\nprosecute, and when he was himself invited to appear in court and answer\r\nto some libel charges he declined to go, upon the ground that the laws\r\nwere still Austrian and the judge a Magyar. He disapproved of such\r\ntolerance, he disapproved of the Croats because they declined to\r\nrecognize that the Serbs had more merit than they, and as for\r\nYugoslavia--it was a thing of emptiness--he laughed at it and called it\r\nYugovina, the south wind. The only chance of life it had was if you\r\nleft the whole affair to the Serbs and then in two years it would be a\r\nsolid thing. It may be thought that the local Government, since they\r\nleft him at large, endorsed his theories; but they were reluctant to\r\ngive him a halo of martyrdom. They imagined that he was nervous because\r\nhe was losing ground--they acknowledged, though, that he still gave\r\npleasure to a great many Serbs, who were carried away by his appeals to\r\ntheir old prejudices. It is undeniable that with the peculiar traditions\r\nand customs of Bosnia, that province must for some years have a\r\nGovernment--whatever method is evolved for the other parts of\r\nYugoslavia--whose eyes are not turned constantly to Belgrade. It might\r\neven be well to set up a local Chamber in which all classes would be\r\nrepresented. The Moslems and Croats would thus lose any lurking fear\r\nthat they were being swamped, and by coming into contact with other\r\npolitical parties even the less cultured classes would gradually tend to\r\ndiscard these fatal religious, in favour of political, divisions. A\r\nsomewhat primitive Balkan community cannot be expected of its own accord\r\nto love henceforward in the name of politics those whom hitherto it has\r\nhated in the name of religion. And as yet they are much more interested\r\nin the harvest than in politics; from day to day they change their\r\nviews, according to the views of the last orator from Belgrade, Zagreb\r\nor Ljubljana. Only the Socialists appear to be well disciplined. Of\r\ncourse the present political parties in Yugoslavia are not wholly free\r\nfrom religious prejudices, an important party, for example, among the\r\nSlovenes being based on Roman Catholicism. But as the Slovenes are, as\r\nyet, the best upholders of the Yugoslav idea, it is obvious that\r\neducation covers all things, and that with the increase of education in\r\nBosnia the religious differences will be less important. Anything that\r\ncan be done against this tyranny is beneficial, whether the St. George\r\nbe a political orator or a schoolmaster. And as the effects produced by\r\nthe former are more rapid, so should he be encouraged. He is, in fact,\r\nappearing in Bosnia, he will carry away, more or less, the _clientele_\r\nof the _Srpski Zora_, and the shattered nervous organism of its editor,\r\nMr. [vC]okorilo, will be, one trusts, reconstituted and devoted, as it\r\ncan be, to a nobler purpose. One of its deplorable effects has been\r\nthat the organ of the Croat party, a paper called _Jugoslavija_, has\r\nbeen compelled to write in a similar strain, whereas the editor, a\r\ndapper little priest, assures one that he would prefer a more elevated\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADI['C] AND HIS PEASANTS\r\n\r\nThose who wished that Yugoslavia would be an idle dream have had their\r\nhopes more centred in Croatia. They told the world that horrible affairs\r\ntook place, that there has been a revolution, several revolutions, that\r\ncastles have been sacked and that the statesman, Radi['c], was\r\nimprisoned. If you met this little pear-shaped man, who is a\r\nmiddle-aged, extremely short-sighted person, with a small, straggling\r\nbeard, an engaging smile and a large forehead, you would say that surely\r\nhe had spent a good many hours of his life in some university garden\r\nwhere the birds, knowing that he could not easily see them, were in the\r\nhabit of alighting for their dinner on his outstretched hands. He is a\r\nvery learned little man, who started his career by obtaining the first\r\nplace at the famous Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris. But Stephen\r\nRadi['c] happens also to be very much interested in politics and\r\nextremely impulsive, so that his wife and daughter have often had to\r\nlook after the bookshop, since the Government--that of Austria-Hungary\r\nand afterwards that of Yugoslavia--had consigned him to prison. He\r\nprobably expected nothing else, for his eloquence--and he is an orator\r\nin several languages--has frequently carried him along and swept him\r\nround and round, like a leaf, not only in a direction opposite to that\r\nwhich he previously travelled but flying sometimes in the face of the\r\nmost puissant and august authorities. So, for example, he began to\r\nagitate in 1904 against the vast territorial possessions of the Church\r\nin Croatia. This resulted in the then Archbishop issuing an interdict\r\nagainst him and his meetings--a measure which, I believe, is still in\r\nforce. He was described as Antichrist, with the consequence that his\r\naudiences, out of curiosity to see what such a personage might look\r\nlike, became larger than ever. For many years he was the only Croat\r\npolitician who gave himself the trouble to go amongst the peasants. \"In\r\npolitics,\" said Radi['c] to me--he said a great many other things in the\r\ncourse of our first conversation, which lasted for four hours, though it\r\nseemed a good deal shorter--\"In politics,\" said he, \"one should not, as\r\nin art, try to be original. One should interpret not only the living\r\ngeneration but the ancestors.\" The peasant, who feels what Radi['c]\r\nexpresses, has repaid him well, for there is now no party in Yugoslavia\r\nwhich is more devoted to its leader. He has taken the place once\r\noccupied by the clergy--he is by no means hostile to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, but he is the foe of clericalism. \"Praised be Jesus Christ! Long\r\nlive the Republic!\" is the usual beginning of one of his orations, so\r\nthat his enemies accuse him in the first place of being a hypocrite, and\r\nin the second of holding views which cannot possibly amalgamate with\r\nthose of monarchical Serbia. But the reference to Christ appears\r\nperfectly natural to the Croat peasant--at an open-air meeting of 10,000\r\nof them I saw their heads uncovered, and all bowed in prayer for a few\r\nminutes on the stroke of noon. As for the Republic, this first came into\r\nthe picture on July 25, 1918, when the cry was raised at a meeting of\r\nthe Peasants' party. A large number of peasants had imbibed this idea in\r\nAmerica--those who emigrated have been in the habit of returning, and\r\neven if their home is in the desolate parts of Zagorija or among the\r\nrocks of Primorija, the coastal region. And thousands of Croats had\r\nspent part of the War as prisoners in Russia--having deserted from the\r\nAustro-Hungarian army--so that they had seen how the Great White Tsar,\r\npreviously regarded as an almost divine being, could be dethroned. Four\r\nmonths after this famous meeting a Convention was held, in the American\r\nfashion, with 2874 delegates, who represented some 100,000 people. They\r\npronounced themselves to be Republicans and Yugoslavs. It is quite true\r\nthat many of the farmers in Croatia have a pretty vague idea of the\r\nRepublic. \"Long live Mr. Republic!\" has been heard before now at one of\r\ntheir meetings, while a landowner of my acquaintance was asked by two of\r\nhis aged tenants whether in the event of this Republic being established\r\nthey should choose as President King Peter or the Prince-Regent or King\r\nCharles. But we should remember that in 1907 a printing press was\r\nfounded by the Peasants' party at Zagreb, and those who gave their money\r\nfor this cause were, to a great extent, illiterate. The people are\r\ngroping towards the light, and they are willing to be told by those they\r\ntrust that they have much to learn as to the nature of the light.\r\nRepublicanism was fanned into flame by Radi['c]'s imprisonment and other\r\ncauses, so that he says he is uncertain whether he can now persuade them\r\nto modify their demands. But if he tells them that in his opinion a\r\nconstitutional monarchy will meet the case, they will probably still\r\nconsent to accept his view--and this has of late come to be his own\r\nopinion. It may very well be that he adopted the republican idea with no\r\nother purpose than to obtain for the peasants the social and economic\r\nlegislation which they would otherwise not have secured. And, after all,\r\nthere was something of a republican nature in Croatia's autonomy under\r\nthe Magyars. As for his imprisonment, it was strange that the Belgrade\r\nCabinet, who should have known their man, treated him as if he were a De\r\nValera; and perhaps the conduct of a subsequent Cabinet, that of Mr.\r\nProti['c], who came out for Croatian Home Rule, was also strange in\r\nappearance, for while Radi['c] was still in prison he was invited to\r\ndecide as to whether the Ban, Croatia's Governor, should or should not\r\nremain in office. But Mr. Proti['c] understood that at this period\r\nRadi['c]'s republicanism was somewhat academic.\r\n\r\nHis party had, in years gone by, been small enough in the Landtag; but\r\nthe fact that his followers then numbered only two is anyhow of no\r\nimportance, as his very real power was derived from the peasants, who\r\nwere largely voteless. How often in his prison he must have yearned for\r\nthose old Landtag days--apart from his advocacy of the peasants, he\r\nloves to speak. In two hours he would traverse the whole gamut of human\r\nthought, expressing opinions to which John Hampden and Jack Cade and\r\nMontaigne and Machiavelli would in turn assent. The words used to rush\r\nfrom his lips in a torrent, while to many of his faithful peasant\r\nfollowers he seemed, throughout his discourse, to be in direct contact\r\nwith the Almighty. Next to the Almighty the Croatian peasant had been\r\ntaught to revere Francis Joseph, so that when the heir to the throne\r\nwas murdered in 1914 it was not very difficult to make the Croat\r\npeasants rise against this sacrilege by plundering the Serbian shops at\r\nZagreb--Austrian officers coming with their children to look on--just as\r\nin other parts of Croatia and Bosnia. There is as yet within the Croat\r\npeasant a certain hostility against the Serb and for various reasons:\r\none of them is that he was always taught by Austria to detest the\r\nadherents of the Orthodox religion, another reason is that for centuries\r\nthey have had a different culture; and so, since Austria's collapse,\r\nwhen it has been explained to them what is a republic and what is a\r\nmonarchy, they have often demanded the former for no better reason than\r\nthat the Serbs prefer the latter. They were taught by Austria to look\r\nforward to a Greater Croatia, which would eliminate the Slovenes by\r\ndelivering them to the Germans, for that celebrated corridor to the\r\nAdriatic. And it is from the Slovene Socialists that the peasants of\r\nCroatia might very profitably learn.... The Slovene influence, coming\r\nfrom a more highly organized province, would be beneficial both for\r\nSerbs and Croats, for the industrial workers and for the peasants. The\r\nnature of the Southern Slavs, say these Socialists, is democratic, and\r\nthe State mechanism might be made more so. Now that the various parts of\r\nYugoslavia have liberated or are liberating themselves from various\r\nyokes, they have approached one another with a different mentality; they\r\nwill become much better known to one another. And it was hoped that when\r\nMr. Radi['c] regained his freedom and his book-shop he would find that\r\nhis devotees preferred to hear him not as a Croat Jack Cade but as a\r\nYugoslav Hampden. In his absence the party was leaderless.\r\n\r\nAs for the other Croats, only Frank's Clerical party, which numbered\r\nfive or six deputies, and did not hide its persistent sympathies with\r\nthe House of Habsburg, kept up Separatist tendencies. All the Coalition\r\n(now the Democrat) party and two-thirds of the so-called Party of\r\nCroatian Right were for a close union with Serbia and the regency of\r\nPrince Alexander. That is not to say that there was perfect unanimity\r\nwith regard to the interior arrangements of this union; in fact Dr. Ante\r\nPaveli['c], one of the Vice-Presidents of the Yugoslav National Council,\r\nwho was received in special audience by the Prince at Belgrade, is also\r\nthe leader of the old Star[vc]evi['c] party and as such an opponent of\r\ncomplete centralization. The _Obzor_, Zagreb's oldest newspaper,\r\nmaintains this point of view, not paying much attention to the form of\r\nthe State, monarchic or republican, so long as it is organized in a\r\nmanner which would prevent the Croats being subordinated. Zagreb, it\r\nthinks, is destined to play the New York to Belgrade's Washington--but\r\nnowadays it looks very much as if Zagreb's role were to be that of\r\nYugoslavia's Boston.\r\n\r\nAmong the Slovenes this anxiety for decentralization--which is very\r\nproper or exaggerated, according to the point of view--is less\r\naccentuated. It appears as if the Christian-Socialist party of Monsignor\r\nKoro[vs]ec[29] is rather centralist in its Belgrade words and\r\ndecentralist in its Ljubljana deeds. This party has shed some of its\r\nextremist clerical members, who to the cry, \"The Church is in danger!\"\r\nwere very good servants of the Habsburgs. Such of them as were unable to\r\naccept the new order of things--elderly priests, for the most\r\npart--retired from the political stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE WHO WILL NOT MOVE WITH THE TIMES\r\n\r\nThere remains the Voivodina (Banat, Ba[vc]ka, etc.) party, some of whom\r\nare as much frightened of Croat predominance as the _Obzor_, for\r\ninstance, is of Serb. The argument of these Voivodina politicians is\r\nthat Serbia has lost so many of her _intelligentsia_ during the War that\r\nshe must have special protection; they also found it hard to swallow the\r\nold functionaries whom the State took over from Austria. Of course it\r\ndoes not follow that if a Slav has been a faithful servant of Austria he\r\nwill be an unsatisfactory servant of the new State. Obviously the\r\ncircumstances of each case must be considered; and, as a barrister, a\r\ndissentient member of this party told me at Osiek, one must often put\r\npersonal feelings aside; he himself had been arbitrarily imprisoned\r\nduring the War by an official who was then an Austrian and is now a\r\nYugoslav functionary. The most extreme exponent of this anti-Croat party\r\nseems to be a well-known editor at Novi Sad, Mr. Ja[vs]a Tomi['c]. In\r\nhis opinion you cannot join by means of a law in twenty-four hours\r\npeople who have never been together; let it be a slower and a surer\r\nprocess. He is ready to die, he says, but he is not ready to lose his\r\nnational name. Let the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes retain what is most\r\nprecious to each of them. Let them not be asked to give up everything.\r\nIn the matter of the flag Mr. Tomi['c] is justified, for now their\r\nformer flag has been taken from each of them and a totally fresh one\r\ncreated, which is particularly hard on the Serbs after the sublime\r\nfashion in which their old colours were carried up the Macedonian\r\nmountains in the Great War. It would not have required much\r\ningenuity--as they all three share the colours, red, white and blue,\r\ndifferently arranged--to have devised, not a mere new and unmeaning\r\narrangement of the simple colours, but a method on the lines of the\r\nUnion Jack or of the former Swedish-Norwegian flag, wherein all three\r\nwould have remained visible. Mr. Tomi['c] believes that a real\r\n_intelligentsia_ would demand of the people what it can execute, and he\r\nregrets to think that at least two-thirds of the _intelligentsia_ want\r\nthe people to call themselves Yugoslavs. But Mr. Tomi['c] has a far\r\ngreater majority than two-thirds against him, because while his\r\narguments would be admirable if the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes had no\r\nneighbours, they must be--and the vast majority of Yugoslavs feel that\r\nthey must be--superseded on account of this imperfect world. By all\r\nmeans let each one of the three retain every single custom that will not\r\ninterfere with the national security and will not interfere too much\r\nwith the national welfare. If Mr. Tomi['c], who is much respected but\r\ngenerally looked upon as rather old-fashioned, is going to die sooner\r\nthan give up something which the State considers essential he will be\r\nfollowing in the footsteps of those whom Cavour, in the course of the\r\nwelding of Italy, had to execute.\r\n\r\nIt may be said without fear of contradiction--in fact I was given the\r\nfigure by one of the decentralization leaders of Croatia--that at least\r\n90 per cent. of the Croat _intelligentsia_ wants the union with Serbia,\r\nand if a republic is decided upon they will mostly vote for King\r\nAlexander as President. While they discuss their internal\r\norganization--no simple matter when one considers their varied\r\nantecedents, their different legal systems and so forth--they will not\r\nlet Yugoslavia go to pieces. The work of construction and of more or\r\nless strenuous, but necessary, criticism occupies by far the greater\r\nnumber of the politicians. They have not yet, all of them, given their\r\nadherence to this or that group, while new groups are arising--such as\r\nthe Agrarian, which being far more interested in the peasant's material\r\nwelfare than in anything else will give their alliance to that political\r\nparty which is prepared to assist the villages towards improving their\r\ncleanliness and their manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YUGOSLAV POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\nThe chief parties which in the new State's first two years evolved\r\nthemselves out of those that previously existed in the various parts of\r\nYugoslavia were:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) the Pa[vs]i['c] party, consisting chiefly of the Serbian\r\n     Old Radical party, together with Serbian parties from the\r\n     Voivodina and Bosnia.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) the Pribi[vc]evi['c] party, consisting chiefly of the\r\n     Croatian Coalition party, together with the Slovene Liberal\r\n     party and the Serbian parties in opposition to Pa[vs]i['c].\r\n\r\n     (_c_) the Christian Socialist party, under Koro[vs]ec,\r\n     consisting chiefly of Slovenes, together with a young group in\r\n     Croatia and other Clerical groups that are forming in Dalmatia\r\n     and Bosnia.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) the Star[vc]evi['c] party, under Paveli['c], consisting\r\n     of decentralizing parties in Croatia and Slavonia, and some\r\n     Croats in Bosnia.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Socialists:\r\n\r\n         (1) the Slovene non-communistic Socialists.\r\n\r\n         (2) Korac's party, chiefly from Slavonia and Serbia.\r\n         This remarkable man, whose mind floats serenely in a body\r\n         that is paralysed, has twice been included in the Cabinet.\r\n         By many he is looked upon as too subversive, but he\r\n         believes that a revolution will come unless his department\r\n         acts in a revolutionary fashion. His programme includes\r\n         old-age pensions from the age of sixty--the people being\r\n         now enfeebled by the wars--and obligatory insurance with\r\n         regard to all those, including State employees in the\r\n         railway service and the post office, who do not enjoy an\r\n         independent existence, half the insurance being paid by\r\n         the employer and half by the employee, while with regard\r\n         to accidents the whole would be paid by the employer. He\r\n         has also very firm ideas for the safeguarding of the human\r\n         dignity of the pensioners.\r\n\r\n         (3) Dr. Rado[vs]evi['c]'s party. This gentleman was said\r\n         to adore Lenin, on whom he lectured. His party had no\r\n         strength except such as it derived as a protest against\r\n         any forced centralization.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) Republican party, consisting of 90,000 Croat peasants\r\n     under Radi['c].\r\n\r\nOf these by far the most important were the first two. In Serbian\r\npolitical parties the personal question used to be nearly always\r\nuppermost, and now, in the case of parties (_a_) and (_b_), it was most\r\ndifficult to understand what aims the one had which the other did not\r\nshare. One may say that each of them was a group under a wily politician\r\nwho was able, not only to forge out of various elements a homogeneous\r\ngroup, but to persuade them that there was a fundamental difference\r\nbetween their group and any other. Here one has not so much the Western\r\nsystem, under which a man enters a Cabinet as the exponent of party\r\nprinciples, but the Eastern system under which a Minister uses his\r\ninfluence to found a party, which is based inevitably on the\r\ndisappearing relics of the past. In the spring of 1919 many foreign\r\nobservers fancied that new parties were surging up like mushrooms and\r\nproving, no doubt, that the people's vitality was strong, although one\r\nwould have waited willingly for this evidence until the country's\r\nexternal and internal affairs were more settled. As a matter of fact\r\nthese rather numerous parties, of which the outside world now heard for\r\nthe first time, had been in existence or semi-existence for years. There\r\nwas, however, a certain bewildering vacillation on the part of some of\r\nthe deputies. The Bosnian Moslems, for instance, could not make up their\r\nminds whether they would be Serbs or Croats and belong to (_a_) or\r\n(_b_). Finally most of them settled down in (_b_), while two others\r\nformed an independent group. It must be remembered that they, like all\r\nthe other deputies, were not really deputies but delegates, since it was\r\nnot yet possible to hold elections. There would naturally be many\r\nchanges after the first General Election; for one thing, the Moslems\r\nintend to join in one group with their brethren from Macedonia and Novi\r\nBazar.... As we shall see, later on, the changes produced by the first\r\nGeneral Election--which was the election held in November 1920, for the\r\nConstituent Assembly--were extremely sweeping. While the Radicals and\r\nDemocrats returned with close on one hundred members each, the\r\nKoro[vs]e['c] party met with comparative disaster, and the Star[vc]evic\r\ngroup was overwhelmed. With about fifty members apiece, the Communist\r\nand the Radi['c] parties gave expression, roughly speaking, to the\r\ndiscontent produced by the unsettled conditions--unavoidable and\r\navoidable--of the new State's first two years. The Moslems came back\r\nwith nearly thirty members, and a healthy phenomenon for a country in\r\nwhich the peasant so largely predominates was the success, apart from\r\nthe Radi['c] Peasant party, of the Agrarians with some thirty deputies,\r\nand the Independent Peasant party with eight.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Press disposed in five lines of the historical Act of Union\r\nwhich occurred when the delegates of the Yugoslav National Council were\r\nreceived by the Prince at Belgrade on December 1, 1918. In the address,\r\nwhich was read by Dr. Paveli['c], it is recorded that \"the National\r\nCouncil desires to join with Serbia and Montenegro in forming a United\r\nNational State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which would embrace the\r\nwhole inseparable ethnographical territory of the South Slavs.... In\r\nthe period of transition, in our opinion, the conditions should be\r\ncreated for the final organization of our United State.\" And there is a\r\ndignified protest against the Treaty of London and the Italian\r\nencroachments which even went beyond that which the treaty gave them. In\r\nhis reply the Prince, among other remarks, said that \"in the name of His\r\nMajesty King Peter I now declare the union of Serbia with the provinces\r\nof the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in an indivisible kingdom. This great\r\nmoment should be a reward for the efforts of yourselves and your\r\nbrothers, whereby you have cast off the alien yoke. This celebration\r\nshould form a wreath for the officers and men who have fallen in the\r\ncause of freedom.... I assure you and the National Council that I shall\r\nalways reign over my brothers and yours, and what constitutes the Serbs\r\nand their people, in a spirit of brotherly love.... The first task of\r\nthe Government will be to arrange with your help and that of the whole\r\npeople that the frontiers should comprise the whole nation. In\r\nconjunction with you I may well hope that our powerful friends and\r\nAllies will be able justly to appreciate our standpoint, because it\r\ncorresponds with the principles which they themselves have proclaimed\r\nand for the achievement of which streams of their precious blood have\r\nbeen poured out....\" The Prince spoke of Italy in phrases to which we\r\nhave already alluded.[30] He reminded her of the Risorgimento and of the\r\nprinciples with which her great sons had then been inspired. But the\r\nItalian Press preferred to moralize in column after column on the\r\nvariety of the political groups of Yugoslavia, with the object of\r\nshowing to the world that they were a people of no cohesive capacities\r\nand of no real national consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLOVENE QUESTION\r\n\r\nThis matter of the frontiers had been very lucidly set before the Allies\r\nwith regard to Dalmatia and Rieka; it now remained for the Slovenes to\r\nformulate their case. From the statement given by Dr. Trumbi['c] to the\r\nCouncil of Ten in Paris we will take these extracts: \"The province of\r\nGorica-Gradi[vs]ca may be divided into two different parts, both from an\r\nethnical and economic point of view. The western part, up to the line\r\nCormons-Gradi[vs]ca-Monfalcone, is economically self-supporting. If we\r\nestimate the population on a language basis, there are about 72,000\r\nItalians and 6000 Slovenes. Geographically it is simply the prolongation\r\nof the Venetian plain. We do not claim this territory called Friuli,\r\nwhich belongs ethnologically to the Italians. The rest of this province\r\nto the east and the north of the Cormons-Gradi[vs]ca-Monfalcone line,\r\nwhich comprises the mountainous region, is inhabited by 148,500 Slovenes\r\nand 17,000 Italians, of whom 14,000 are in the town of Gorica, where\r\nthey constitute half the population.... The Slovenes are an advanced and\r\ncivilized people, acutely conscious of their racial solidarity with the\r\nother Yugoslav peoples. We therefore ask that this district should be\r\nreunited to our State.... Istria is inhabited by Slavs and Italians.\r\nAccording to the latest statistics, there were in it 223,318 Yugoslavs\r\nand 147,417 Italians. The Slavs inhabit central and eastern Istria in a\r\ncompact mass. More Italians live on the western coast, particularly in\r\nthe towns. They inhabit only five villages north of Pola, and their\r\npopulations have no territorial unity. Istria is territorially linked\r\nwith Carniola and Croatia, whereas it is separated from Italy by the\r\nAdriatic, and therefore it ought to belong to the Yugoslav State....\r\nTriest and its neighbourhood is geographically an integral part of\r\npurely Slav territories. The majority of this town--two-thirds,\r\naccording to statistics--is Italian and the rest Slav. These statistics\r\nbeing on the language basis, include Germans, Greeks, Levantines, etc.,\r\nas Italian-speaking, among the Italians. The Slav element plays an\r\nimportant part in the commercial and economic life of Triest. If the\r\ntown were ethnically in contact with Italy we would recognize the right\r\nof the majority. But all the hinterland of Triest is entirely Slav. Yet\r\nthe commercial and maritime value of Triest is what chiefly counts, and\r\nit is a port of world trade. As such it is the representative of its\r\nhinterland, which stretches as far as Bohemia, and chiefly of its\r\nSlovene hinterland, which forms a third of the whole trade of Triest\r\nand is inextricably linked with it. Should Triest become Italian it\r\nwould be politically separated from its trade hinterland, and would be\r\nprejudiced in a commercial respect. Since Austria has crumbled as a\r\nState, the natural solution of the problem of Triest is that it should\r\nbe joined to our State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENTIMENTS OF TRIEST\r\n\r\nIt would be futile to talk of Triest without considering the relations\r\nbetween Italians and Germans. We have seen already how at the elections\r\nthey combined against the \"common enemy.\" But in commerce the Germans\r\nwere in need of no alliance, for the Italians have relatively so little\r\ncapital to dispose of that they were unable to keep the Germans from\r\nattaining that very dominant position in Italy. As the Italians have, as\r\na general rule, a lack of initiative and enterprise with respect to\r\nmodern industry, it was to German efforts that the great industrial and\r\ncommercial awakening of Italy and of Triest were largely due. In that\r\ntown the Italians were principally agents; and it is to be feared that\r\nif it ultimately falls into their hands it will become a German town\r\nunder the Italian flag. It would be the object of the Italians to\r\nemancipate Austria from the Yugoslavs, giving them an outlet to Triest\r\nover Italian territory; and it would be to the Italian advantage if\r\nAustria were joined to Germany. Therefore it is preferable for all the\r\nAllies, except the Italians, that Triest should be international.\r\nConditions could then be offered to the Austrians that would cause them\r\nto prefer these rather than to join themselves to Germany. But, in the\r\nopinion also of many enlightened Italians, it is not in that country's\r\ninterest that she should hold Triest. Apart from the older publicists\r\nand statesmen, including Sonnino, who might wish to modify their\r\nopinions, one of the best-informed writers on Triest and Istria, A.\r\nVivante, a native of Triest, in his _L'irredentismo adriatico_ (1912) is\r\na most determined adversary to an Italian occupation of Istria or\r\nTriest; his book has been withdrawn from circulation by the Italian\r\nGovernment. Other resolute opponents have been all the inhabitants of\r\nTriest, except the extreme Nationalists. The town's prosperity dated\r\nfrom the time when the Habsburgs were driven out of Italy. Triest has\r\nnot forgotten what occurred when she and Venice were under the same\r\nsceptre; and this it was which brought about, at Austria's collapse, the\r\nautonomous administration in which practically all the elements of the\r\ntown participated. Only the Irridentists then thought that Triest's\r\nliberation need involve union with Italy and economic separation from\r\nthe hinterland on which it depends.... When the occupation started, in\r\nNovember 1918, the Chief of the Italian police summoned before him the\r\nmembers of the Yugoslav National Council of Triest. Only two of them\r\nanswered the summons, whereupon a lieutenant read them the following\r\norder from the Italian Governor: \"In view of the fact that the Italians\r\ntroops have occupied the line of demarcation and that traffic over this\r\nline is suspended for the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it is\r\nordered that, for strategical reasons, the South Slav National Council\r\nin Triest be dissolved and its offices closed.\" The Slovenes demanded a\r\ncopy of this order, which, however, was refused. They were not allowed\r\nto depart until the books and national emblems had been removed from the\r\npremises of the National Council, the doors sealed and a guard\r\nstationed. \"We others, Italians,\" an Italian writer had said in the\r\n_Edinost_, the Slovene paper of Triest, on August 18, 1918, \"should\r\nunderstand that if we want our freedom we must see that this is likewise\r\ngiven to our neighbours.\" And the _Mercure de France_ of October\r\nremarked that these wise words would be listened to at Rome. In the\r\nrealm of navigation the Italians were not idle. They started at once to\r\nnegotiate with the Austrians for the sale to themselves of the Lloyd\r\nSteamship Company, the Austro-Americana and the Navigazione Libera, the\r\nthree largest Austrian companies. By the end of February 1919, a Mr.\r\nIvan [vS]vegel related in a well-informed article,[31] the Italians had,\r\nby acquiring a large portion of their shares, obtained the decisive\r\ninfluence in these companies. The deal which was carried through with\r\nthe assistance of the Austrian Government and which, according to the\r\n_Neue Freie Presse_ of February 22, \"fully satisfied the needs of\r\nAustrian commerce,\" was transacted during the Armistice and behind the\r\nback of public opinion. Surely the Austrian mercantile marine, to which\r\nthe Yugoslavs contributed the majority of the personnel and which they,\r\nwith the other nationalities of the late Empire, helped to build up with\r\nthe aid of considerable subsidies, should not have been permitted to\r\nfall an easy prize into the lap of Italy, but ought rather to constitute\r\nan asset in the liquidation of the late Austrian State and a subject of\r\npublic discussion.... In consequence of the Italian attitude towards\r\nAustria on the one hand and the Slovenes on the other, the Austrians\r\nmade an attack from northern Carinthia near Christmas and despoiled the\r\nSlovenes of about half the territory they had occupied. An American\r\nmission asked both sides to cease from hostilities, saying that the\r\nquestion of frontiers would be decided by Paris in a few weeks. Two\r\nAmericans, who unfortunately could speak neither German nor Slovene,\r\nmotored through the country, made some inquiries, especially in the\r\ntowns, and departed for Paris. It would have been as well if, like the\r\nFrench farther to the east, they had deliminated between the two people\r\na neutral zone. Sooner or later the troubles were bound to recommence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNANIMITY IN THE BANAT\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, of all the lands which the Yugoslavs were inheriting from\r\nAustro-Hungary, that which was passing through the period of transition\r\nwith the least disturbance was the Banat. Those Magyars who stayed were\r\nsaying wistfully that it had been Hungarian for a thousand years, but\r\nconsidering what they had done they could not have brought forward a\r\nworse reason for their reinstatement. Here and there at places near the\r\nfrontier, such as Subotica, they waylaid and murdered lonely Serbian\r\nsoldiers; after which, with the complicity of Magyar officials whom the\r\nSerbs had not removed, they managed to escape to Hungary. But as a rule\r\nthey thought it wiser to stay peacefully in the Banat than seek their\r\nfortunes in a land so insecure as Hungary was then. While Count Michael\r\nKarolyi's Government was doing its utmost to cultivate good relations\r\nwith France, England and America--printing in the newspapers cordial\r\narticles in French and English, surrounding the Entente officers even in\r\ntheir despite with the old, barbaric hypnotizing Magyar hospitality,\r\nassuming in a long wireless message to President Wilson that the\r\nHungarians were among those happy people who at last had been liberated\r\nfrom the yoke of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire--(\"I beg you, Mr.\r\nPresident, to use your influence that no acts of inhumanity or abuses of\r\nauthority may threaten our new-born democracy and freedom from any\r\nquarter. They would cruelly wound the soul of our people and hinder the\r\nmaturing of that pure pacifism and that mutual understanding between the\r\npeoples without which there will never be peace and rest on earth.... We\r\nwill not discredit or delay with acts of violence the new-born freedom\r\nof the peoples of Hungary or the triumph of your ideas....\")--at a place\r\ncalled Nagylak the free Hungarian people requested the authorities to\r\ngive them an official document permitting them to plunder for\r\ntwenty-four hours; at a place called Szentes there was a car which had\r\nbeen stolen from a man at Arad, sixty miles away; hearing where it was\r\nhe telegraphed to the authorities and nothing happened; so he hired\r\nanother car and went himself to Szentes where the Magyar Commissary\r\nconfiscated this one also. It was better to remain in the Banat if one\r\nhad anything to lose. The treatment which the Magyars received was such\r\nthat Mr. Rapp, Commissary of the Buda-Pest Government, published a\r\nproclamation on the generous conduct of the Serbian troops occupying\r\nsouthern Hungary: \"Our nationals,\" he declared, \"though vanquished and\r\nin a minority, are safe. The Serbian officers in command treat them in a\r\nmost humane and chivalrous fashion.\"[32] At Pan[vc]evo, for example,\r\nthe Magyar officials were placed, for their protection, on board a boat\r\nby the Serbian authorities and kept there, provided with food and\r\ncigars, for twelve hours, after which, as the danger was past, they were\r\nset at liberty. In the same town, forty years earlier, the language used\r\nin the law courts had been Serbian; no one, in fact, spoke Magyar,\r\nexcept the cab-drivers--if you spoke it people said you must have been\r\nin prison. Yet, although the Magyar judges had, to put it mildly, not\r\nbeen too considerate towards the Serbs, they were retained in office on\r\nthe understanding that they would learn Serbian within a year; nor were\r\nthey asked, as yet, to administer the law in the name of King Peter, but\r\nin the name of Justice. This magnanimity was not displayed because, as\r\nwith the railway employees, the Serbs were short of people for those\r\nposts, since they had barristers well qualified to be employed, as they\r\nwere, for example, at Sombor, in the position of temporary judges. Even\r\nthe town advocate was not dismissed, although this healthy gentleman had\r\nsuperseded a Serb forty-two years of age, considerably older than\r\nhimself, who had been compelled to join the army. Not alone were all\r\nthese functionaries left in office, but the papers sent to them were in\r\ntheir own language, Magyar or German. And in return they generally were\r\nloyal to the Yugoslavs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEME[vS]VAR IN TRANSITION\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary state of things was to be seen at Teme[vs]var, where\r\nthe Magyar mayor was one of the most worried men in Europe. Until\r\nFebruary 1919 he was being asked to serve not two but several masters.\r\nSome uncertainty existed as to whether the town was under French or\r\nSerbian military command, but that was not a very serious question.\r\nThere was at Novi Sad a temporary Government for all the Voivodina, this\r\nwas the \"Narodna Uprava\" (National Government), consisting of eleven\r\ncommissaries, each over a department, who had been appointed by the\r\nVoivodina Assembly of 690 Serbs, 12 Slovaks, 2 Magyars and 6\r\nGermans--one deputy for every thousand of the population. The mayor of\r\nTeme[vs]var could have reconciled the wishes of the Narodna Uprava and\r\nthe military authorities, but there was a Magyar Jewish Socialist, a\r\ncertain Dr. Roth, who had elected himself to be head of the \"People's\r\nGovernment,\" and was subsequently appointed by telephone from Buda-Pest\r\nthe representative of the Hungarian Government. Roth organized a civil\r\nguard, mostly of former Hungarian soldiers, who--although he paid them\r\nwell (since Buda-Pest had given him 12 million crowns for propaganda\r\npurposes), yet had a way of borrowing a coat or cap from Serbian\r\nsoldiers and, arrayed in these, holding up pedestrians after nightfall.\r\nRoth had therefore been granted the right to rule, but--save for the\r\ndubious guard--his power was only that which the Serbian or French\r\nauthorities would give him. He issued many orders to the mayor, some of\r\nwhich were very questionable, as for instance when he sent provisions\r\nout of the Banat to Hungary. This produced so great a scarcity that the\r\nflour-mill employees thought it was the time to go on strike; they\r\ndemanded 80 per cent. increase in wages, without undertaking to go back\r\nto work if they received it. \"I am not a politician,\" said the harassed\r\nmayor, \"I only want to save the town from starving.\" But the Narodna\r\nUprava would send no food, since the town (that is to say Roth) would\r\nnot acknowledge its authority. There were many rumours as to how Roth\r\nspent the sums from Buda-Pest, and a weekly Socialist sheet, which he\r\nhimself had founded, but had now made over to a couple of his friends\r\n(likewise Magyar Jews), called Fuerth and Isaac Gara, started to bring\r\ncharges against its founder. Roth, whose previous resources were not\r\nlarge and were well known to Fuerth and Gara, used now to frequent the\r\nfashionable cafe and indulge, night after night, in potations of\r\nchampagne, inviting to his table not Fuerth nor Gara, but the French\r\nGeneral. This officer, in the advance through Serbia, had captured a\r\ngreat many prisoners and a very large number of guns, arousing\r\neverybody's enthusiasm by his personal bravery, his dashing tactics and\r\nthe skill with which he executed them. He was a most original person,\r\nwho would sometimes about midnight in that cafe at Teme[vs]var leap on\r\nto one of the marble tables and there perform a _pas de seul_. Dr. Roth\r\nsucceeded in worming himself into this merry warrior's good graces, and\r\nFuerth and Gara looked with jaundiced eyes on the carouses of these two.\r\nAnd in their newspaper, the _Teme[vs]var_, they said very biting things.\r\nThereupon Roth complained about them to the Serbian authorities, asking\r\nthat they should be sent to Belgrade. When the Serbs did nothing he made\r\napplication to the French, and they--not aware of all the\r\ncircumstances--sent the couple under guard to Belgrade, where they were\r\ninterned. The mayor continued to receive the orders of the various\r\nparties, and then suddenly Roth organized a strike which lasted for two\r\ndays--the railways, the electric light, the water-supply and the shops\r\nall joining in the movement. There was even a Magyar flag on the town\r\nhall, and cries were raised by a procession for the Magyar Republic. But\r\nthis time he had gone too far. An order came from Belgrade, from General\r\nFranchet d'Esperey, and Roth was taken in a car to Arad, where he was\r\ndeposited on the other side of the line of demarcation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SORT OF WAR IN CARINTHIA\r\n\r\nBut the German-Austrians in Carinthia, seeing how the Slovenes were\r\nbeing treated by the Italians, could not resist attacking on their own\r\naccount; and here the most tragic feature was that in the German ranks\r\nwere many Germanized Slovenes. This had been the case at Maribor in\r\nStyria, where the population rose against the 70 Slovene soldiers during\r\nthe visit of an American mission. Many of those who were afterwards\r\nquestioned were obliged to admit that they were of Slovene or of partly\r\nSlovene origin, but Austria had taken care of their national\r\nconscience. Had they been freely left to choose between the two\r\nnationalities, and had they, out of admiration for the German, selected\r\nthat one--you would not endeavour now to make them Slovenes; but of\r\ncourse these people were never given the choice, and therefore every\r\neffort should be used to make to dance that portion of their blood which\r\nis Slovene, and sometimes all your efforts will be fruitless. That those\r\nwho fought in Carinthia against the Slovene troops were of this origin\r\ncan be seen by the names of the officers of the so-called\r\n\"Volkswehralarmkompagnien\" (_i.e._ the People's Emergency Defence\r\nCompanies). A document, marked W. No. 101, and signed by a Captain\r\nSandner, fell into Slovene hands on February 21. It gives very full\r\narrangements for these companies in Wolfsberg and the neighbourhood. At\r\nSt. Paul, for instance, men are to gather from three other regions, to\r\nwit 40 from St. Paul itself, 120 from Granitzthal, 60 from Lagerbuch and\r\n30 from Eitweg; the officers of this St. Paul contingent are called\r\nKronegger, Andrec, Kloetsch and Gritsch--the last three are of Slovene\r\norigin. These Defence Companies consisted largely of ex-soldiers, under\r\nthe command, very often, of a schoolmaster or some such person; and if\r\nthey had done nothing more than to defend their own soil, one would have\r\nless to say about them; but as a matter of fact they sent arms across to\r\ntheir adherents in the territory occupied by the Slovenes. Thus at\r\nVelikovec (Voelkermarkt) and Donji Dravograd (Unter-Drauburg) shots were\r\nfired from houses which had been armed in this way. Incursions were made\r\ninto Yugoslav territory, where the people were urged to rise; and as\r\nthese Defence Companies did not wear any uniform their members could, if\r\ncaptured, protest their innocence. The officers were given 20 crowns a\r\nday, the men six crowns, with 5.44 a day for their keep during the time\r\nof emergency, and four crowns daily in addition if they went outside the\r\ngarrison town. As it would not be possible to get the commissariat at\r\nonce into working order the men were asked to bring at least sufficient\r\nbread with them for a few days. Most of the men had their own guns;\r\nthose who had not would be lent one at the village office on the\r\nunderstanding that it was brought back there when the emergency was\r\nover. These Defence Companies were joined in the spring by 2000 of the\r\nproletariat of Vienna who, at the railway station before they started,\r\nwere cheered by speeches on the subject of plunder; at Graz they were\r\njoined by some students who proposed to maintain order.... It was in\r\nApril that the Germans began nearly every day to fire on the Yugoslav\r\ntroops, regardless of the Americans, who said that any infringement of\r\nthe Armistice would be severely punished. The Slovene bridgehead around\r\nVelikovec was, towards the end of April, bombarded for several days with\r\nheavy artillery, and the local commander, on his own initiative, crossed\r\nthe Armistice line in order to seize this artillery; he did, in fact,\r\ncarry off some twenty pieces, with which he returned to his old\r\npositions. This caused the Germans to send through Zurich most indignant\r\ntelegrams to the Entente Press, denouncing the Yugoslavs for having\r\nflagrantly crossed the Armistice line by 10 kilometres (cf. _Le\r\nJournal_, for example, of May 5). In the same report they were held up\r\nas villains for having crossed the river Drave at several points and cut\r\nthe railway line; as a matter of fact their infantry was at least 11\r\nkilometres to the south of the Drave, and the artillery, of course,\r\nstill farther off. This railway line, which was the means of\r\ncommunication between Austrians and Italians, was the subject of very\r\nfierce talk on the part of the latter. All this time, be it remembered,\r\nthe Slovenes had feeble forces; and their own officers do not pretend\r\nthat they approach the Serbs as combatants. After centuries of\r\nservitude--a more insidious servitude than if their masters had been\r\nMoslem--they have now awakened to devote themselves, and with great\r\nsuccess, to agriculture and industry. Nevertheless the old fighting\r\nspirit of the Slav has not been quite extinguished in them. Their\r\nopponents on May 2 made a big attack upon Celovec (Klagenfurt) and\r\nBeljak (Villach), where they had at their disposal the munitions of the\r\nentire 10th Austrian army. Several battalions had come down from Vienna,\r\nas well as 340 unemployed Austrian ex-officers, who were clothed as\r\ninfantry privates. These officers were serving for the love of their\r\ncountry--up to May 1 at all events they were in receipt of no pay. The\r\nSlovene ranks were somewhat depleted by Bol[vs]evik tracts, telling\r\nthem to go home, as there would be no more war; and yet at Gutenstein\r\nsixty men with three machine guns, under Lieut. Maglaj, a Slovene from\r\nCarinthia, kept 1500 men at bay from 9 a.m. till 3.30, after which they\r\nslowly withdrew until the fighting ceased at six; a corporal and two men\r\nof a machine-gun detachment were cut off and concealed themselves in the\r\nshrubs of a defile. Suddenly they heard a German company come down the\r\nroad, singing as they marched. The three men opened fire--the Germans in\r\nperplexity stood still and then retired in disorder. The whole\r\nGerman-Austrian movement was checked by General Maister. And when the\r\nSerbian veterans, men of all ages, with uniforms of every shade, marched\r\nthrough the streets of Maribor, it was felt that there need be no more\r\nanxiety as to that particular frontier of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n\r\nYUGOSLAVIA BEGINS TO PUT HER HOUSE IN ORDER\r\n\r\nIt was not until now that Great Britain (on May 9) and France (on June\r\n5) formally recognized the new Serbo-Croat-Slovene State.[33] As the\r\n_Times_ said, two years afterwards,[34] \"it was not the Allies who\r\ncreated Czecho-Slovakia or brought about the establishment of\r\nYugo-Slavia. These events were the inevitable result of the previous\r\nhistory which the Allies could not, even if they had desired to do so,\r\nprevent.\" The Americans had not been so extremely considerate to Italy,\r\nfor they had recognized the Yugoslav State on February 7, a few days\r\nafter Norway and Switzerland.... And how necessary it was for the\r\nYugoslavs to have some leisure for their home affairs, which presented\r\nso many complications. Here one system of laws and there another--with\r\nthe best will in the world and waiving to the uttermost one's own\r\nidiosyncrasies, the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes were faced, at the\r\nbeginning of their union, by most arduous problems. The Agrarian\r\nquestion was regarded generally as one of the most urgent. In Serbia\r\nitself, with practically the whole country in the hands of small peasant\r\nproprietors, this question did not arise; but in the provinces which had\r\nbeen lately under Austria-Hungary no time was to be lost, and yet a good\r\ndeal of time would be needed to cope with a problem so full of\r\ncomplications. One difficulty was that each political party was inclined\r\nto solve this matter in accordance with its own interests. Among the\r\nthree Slovene parties, for example, the Socialists would naturally work\r\nfor their own principles, the Christian-Socialist party, whose\r\nsupporters were chiefly the small farmers, would prefer to legislate for\r\nthem, while the Liberal party, having in its ranks the larger\r\nlandowners, would wish that all, except the very largest, should if\r\npossible be left intact; the very large landowners, moreover, will with\r\nthe spread of democratic ideas lose their influence over the voters.\r\nThere are several points on which all parties are agreed: thus, it is\r\nmost undesirable that a man's holdings should, as now, be separated from\r\neach other, often by considerable distances, so that half his time may\r\nbe spent in going to and from his fields and a good deal of the other\r\nhalf in the disputes which naturally spring from such a scattered\r\nownership.... In Bosnia, where the Agrarian troubles had produced such\r\nfrequent outbreaks and savage repression, the Austrians were given the\r\nmandate in 1878 in the hope that they would regulate this matter. They\r\ndid not do very much; all that they really did was to modernize a\r\nlittle. They wrote down in a book who was the landlord and who were the\r\nkmets, and a copy of these details was available for each one of the\r\nkmets. He had the right to remain where he was--unless his conduct was\r\nexceptionally bad--and to retain two-thirds of the produce of the land.\r\nThis kmet-right was not hereditary in the female line; but the kmet\r\ncould buy his portion--this was an old right, which Austria\r\nregulated--and become a free man, a beg. He would sometimes be a free\r\nman in one place and a kmet in another. In Bosnia there are, of course,\r\nsome extremely large landowners; but most of the begs are poor folk, who\r\nlive on the third part of a few farms. It would be better if these men\r\nwere not compensated with cash, but rather that they should be\r\nestablished on farms which they would work themselves, the distinction\r\nbetween the small begs and the kmets thus disappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF AGRARIAN REFORM\r\n\r\nA special Ministry was created to supervise, throughout Yugoslavia, the\r\nquestion of Agrarian Reform; but the Cabinet was frequently engaged in\r\ndiscussing this important topic and, many months afterwards, when the\r\nownership of a good deal of the land had been changed, it was\r\nacknowledged that the problem had been attacked more often than it had\r\nbeen solved. Mr. Pa[vs]i['c], who does not believe in hasty legislation,\r\npointed out that the Austrians had in forty years done really very\r\nlittle in Bosnia. He was told, however, that in Croatia, for example,\r\nthe revolutionary spirit at the end of the War was so intense that if\r\nthe Government were to postpone the necessary reforms then the people\r\nwould simply seize whatever land they wished to have. It is true that\r\nviolence was rampant in those parts--the peasants believed that with\r\nAustria's collapse there would arrive the Earthly Paradise, and in order\r\nto bring this about they ravaged a good many fine estates and set fire\r\nto various castles. They were going to stand no nonsense. At a place\r\ncalled Lubi[vs]ica in Croatia--where the 350 families lived in 260\r\nhouses--the landowner, out of the goodness of his heart, bestowed twenty\r\n\"joch\" of meadowland on the village in 1864. A law was passed which\r\nobliged him to devote a certain amount of land to the support of the\r\nchurch and the school--he gave the identical twenty joch. And at the end\r\nof the War the peasants maintained that at last this land was going to\r\nbe restored to them; they drove their cattle on to it, but the priest\r\nwith the help of _gendarmerie_ drove them off again. Once more the\r\ncattle came back and then the priest seized a gun; he fired at his\r\nparishioners and wounded in the head a sixteen-year-old boy, as well as\r\nthree other persons. This so enraged the village that they went in a\r\nbody and slew the priest.... And the authorities, although at that\r\nperiod they were faced with so many problems, attempted to settle right\r\naway this very complicated question. The Dobrovoljci--volunteers with\r\nthe Yugoslav forces who had come home from the United States, Canada and\r\nAustralia or who had managed to escape from the Austro-Hungarian\r\narmy--had been promised so many acres, each of them, after the War. And\r\nthese Dobrovoljci and the agitated peasants found that the land was, so\r\nto speak, thrust upon them. A lawyer-politician would take a map, would\r\nassign a certain area to A, another to B, and imagine he had done a good\r\nmorning's work; but unhappily the lawyer often forgot that a farm, to be\r\nof any use to its tenant, must have a road leading to it, must have a\r\nwell, a cart, a horse, some oxen and so forth--to say nothing of a\r\ndwelling-place. Thus it would happen that the new tenant would go to\r\nlook at his holding and in disgust would go away, or--contrary to\r\nlaw--would sublet it or sell it back to the original owner. If, on the\r\nother hand, he remained the State would, from an economical point of\r\nview, only benefit in those regions where the land had hitherto been\r\nmore or less uncultivated; where it had been cultivated by the\r\nmoderately large or the very large landowner it always returned a\r\nharvest more considerable than that which the new tenant, insufficiently\r\nequipped and experienced, was able to achieve. Not only would there be\r\nthis diminished production--frequently in the proportion of six to\r\nten--but a large number of employees were thrown out of employment:\r\nsometimes a clever Czech overseer, whose family of six children had\r\nalmost become Croat, and sometimes a native farmer whose house was\r\nwanted for the Dobrovoljci. The Czech would return to his own country\r\nand the dispossessed farmer would become a Communist. Yet these material\r\nand human losses to the State might have been endured if there had been\r\na compensating political advantage, that is to say if the new tenants\r\nhad been satisfied. But in far too many instances they were not. And one\r\ncannot help thinking that, in the vast majority of cases, they\r\nthemselves would have preferred to wait until the Peasants' Co-operative\r\nAssociations--such as flourish in Denmark--had been established. It need\r\nscarcely be said that, from the point of view of the peasant and of the\r\nState, these associations are an absolute necessity. The most deplorable\r\nexample of the measures that were taken in such haste is seen, of\r\ncourse, in a model-property, such as that of Count [vC]ekoni['c] in the\r\nnorth of the Banat, where the new tenants, seeking as elsewhere to\r\nsatisfy only their own wants and paying no heed to any possible exports,\r\nallow a highly developed property to go in a retrograde direction. If\r\nthe Dobrovoljci had been skilled agriculturists there would have been no\r\nharm in settling them on this excellent estate; and with a Co-operative\r\nAssociation the 3000 joch of sugar that were grown there during the War\r\nwould not now be reduced to 88 joch. But as it is, what with the\r\nunfortunate inexperience of most of the new tenants and their lack of\r\nmeans, and what with the stupidity of the local authorities who left to\r\nthe previous owner one field here and one field there in the most absurd\r\nfashion, it would have been better both for Count [vC]ekoni['c] and for\r\nthe State if he had simply presented to the Dobrovoljci half his land. A\r\ngreat many mistakes have been made in this question of Agrarian Reform,\r\none of the most cardinal being--as Radi['c], the spokesman of the Croat\r\npeasants, has pointed out--to bestow the land not on people because they\r\ncan farm it, but because they were heroes in the War.[35] It is a matter\r\nfor congratulation that the measures now in force are not definite--the\r\nfinal dispositions will be taken in two or three years.[36] And perhaps\r\nthen some part of the counsel of Radi['c] may be adopted--Radi['c],\r\nwhose critics are never weary of denouncing him for being a demagogue, a\r\nfirebrand and various other things, but who by that time may very likely\r\nbe a Cabinet Minister. He advises that there should be a compromise,\r\nthat the ownership of land in Yugoslavia should not be strictly\r\nindividualist nor strictly communist, but that while preserving the\r\nspirit of the _zadruga_ (ownership by the community) there should also\r\nbe the mobility of individual ownership.\r\n\r\nBut in the field of Agrarian Reform there has been one excellent plan,\r\nthe transference of men from the unfertile districts of Montenegro and\r\nLika, also of landless men from the Banat and Ba[vc]ka, as also Serbs\r\nfrom Hungary and Slovenes from Istria, to those parts of Kossovo and\r\nMacedonia which were lying ownerless. The Albanians in Kossovo are\r\nmostly shepherds, and the land, which by Turkish law had belonged to\r\n\"God and the Sultan,\" was now at the disposal of the Yugoslav\r\nauthorities. Down to the spring of 1922 they had placed some 35,000\r\npersons in these regions, the Montenegrins being generally allocated to\r\nan Albanian neighbourhood, for they are accustomed to the idiosyncrasies\r\nof the Shqyptart. At first the Albanians viewed the new settlers with\r\ndisfavour, but now so great a sympathy has developed between them that\r\non various occasions the Montenegrins have remonstrated with the\r\ngendarmes for the excessive order they enforce and which, the\r\nMontenegrins say, you really cannot ask of an Albanian. Against the\r\nMontenegrins the Albanians do not care to use their rifles, since the\r\ncustom of blood-vengeance is in the Montenegrin blood. In fact, these\r\nAlbanians are very fair neighbours, the most unruly of them living in\r\nthe mountains of the frontier. And the Montenegrins have been showing\r\nthat when they are not compelled to live with weapons in their hand they\r\ncan be quite industrious. There has, till now, been more colonization of\r\nKossovo than of Macedonia; but there are wide tracts of country around\r\nSkoplje which will be settled, once they have been freed from malaria.\r\nThe political consequences that this will have on Macedonia, by the\r\nstabilization of economic conditions, the supersession of the wooden\r\nplough by the steam plough--in fact, the advent of a new European spirit\r\nneed scarcely be enlarged upon. In Serbian Macedonia, or South Serbia as\r\nit is now officially called, more than seven million acres of good soil\r\nare as yet not being used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENZY AT RIEKA\r\n\r\nAs the months rolled on at Rieka the Italianists became more frantic.\r\nTheir telegrams to Rome, in which they begged for instant annexation,\r\nwere in vain, and after all, what was the use of adopting the system of\r\nLieut.-Colonel Stadler, their energetic podesta at Abbazia, who would go\r\ninto the hills, accost the peasants and instruct them that they must not\r\nsay: \"It will be settled by the Paris Conference,\" but rather--\"It has\r\nbeen settled by the Paris Conference.\" All the world was learning what\r\nwas the position of affairs at Rieka; one of the most important of these\r\nplaguy Allied officers had said that when he first came to the town he\r\nthought it was Italian, but he had soon perceived that it was all a\r\ncomedy, and the Italianists were dreadfully afraid that memoranda and\r\nstatistics and what not had been dispatched to Paris and that there was\r\nthe faintest, awful possibility that one could say: \"It has been\r\nsettled by the Paris Conference.\" Everyone, alas! was studying the\r\ncase--one heard that Cardinal Bourne, in the course of being feted at\r\nZagreb, was reported to have shown himself quite intimate with Croatian\r\nhistory and to have discussed especially the story of Rieka. But by far\r\nthe shrewdest blow to the Italianists was Wilson's Declaration. What had\r\nhis emissaries, who had listened with such care to everybody, told him?\r\nOne must have a grand procession through the town to show the whole\r\nworld what the people wanted! As for Wilson, it was good to hear the\r\nlusty shouts of the \"Giovani Fiumani\": \"Down with Wilson! down with\r\nredskins!\" Some of the demonstrators, after shouting that Wilson was a\r\ndonkey, a horse, a ruffian, would acclaim the new suggestion, that their\r\nenemy was not Wilson at all but Rudolf of Austria, who was still alive.\r\nAnother very good idea would be to have great posters made with Wilson's\r\nhead crowned by a German helmet, and now, of course, the Hotel Wilson\r\nmust become the Hotel Orlando. Let them put a large black cross on all\r\nthe Croat houses of Rieka--well, on second thoughts, next morning, that\r\nwas not a very brilliant idea, because the crosses were too numerous; so\r\nlet the soldiers rub them out again. And where the Croat names on banks\r\nand shops and elsewhere had been effaced, demolished--one could hide\r\nthem by long strips of paper which they were so busy printing: \"Either\r\nItaly or death!\" \"Viva Orlando!\" \"Viva Sonnino!\"--those papers were the\r\nbest reply to people who were asking if the entire Italian Cabinet was\r\nin harmony with Sonnino. Not merely in harmony--the Cabinet _was_\r\nSonnino and more particularly Orlando was Sonnino. An Italian major came\r\nout on to a balcony one evening, in uniform, and opened his Italian\r\nheart to the crowd. What would the Allies say to that? The _Dante\r\nAlighieri_, the great dreadnought, manoeuvring with her searchlights,\r\nlet them rest awhile upon the _Schley_, an American destroyer. What\r\nwould the Yankees do? \"Avanti Savoia!\" Perhaps in the old days they\r\nwould have sent a shot or two into the searchlights, just for luck, but\r\nnow they did nothing. And what a scene at the Opera when _Andre Chenier_\r\nwas performed and one of the singers came to the word \"Traitor!\" and\r\nsome one shouted \"Wilson!\" and the whole house shouted \"Wilson!\" and the\r\nsinger, forced to repeat the blessed word, added amid indescribable\r\nenthusiasm the name of the President, that ignominious President\r\nconcerning whom it was revealed by one of their newspapers that he must\r\nobviously have pocketed Yugoslav money, perhaps a million, and who most\r\nprobably had a Yugoslav mistress--when that opera-singer had emended the\r\nphrase, did that very exalted Italian officer leave his box? Why, no--he\r\nstayed until the end of the performance.... Did any Italian in Rieka\r\nread to the end a small and lucid American book, _Italy and the\r\nYugoslavs, A Question of International Law_, by C. A. H. Bartlett of the\r\nNew York and United States Federal Bar? \"It is an admitted fact,\" says\r\nMr. Bartlett, \"that Italy at the outbreak of hostilities had no rights\r\nto, or in, the territory to which she now makes claim. Her title,\r\ntherefore, has arisen since the commencement of the War, and must be\r\nfounded on either effective possession legally acquired or on\r\ndocumentary evidence or some other right recognized by international\r\nlaw.\" And quoting Professor Westlake (_International Law_, Part I. p.\r\n91) as to the four grounds on which a State may vindicate its\r\nsovereignty over new domain, he discusses the position in the Adriatic,\r\nand concludes that Italy can claim no title by occupancy, cession,\r\nsuccession or self-determination. We refer elsewhere to Mr. Bartlett's\r\ncommentary on the London Treaty, which is the instrument invoked by the\r\nItalians for their claims to Dalmatia. With regard to Rieka, which, as\r\neverybody knows, was not included even in the London Treaty, Mr.\r\nBartlett says that while \"admitting, for the purpose of argument, that\r\nthe seizure has since resulted in an effective possession, yet, as that\r\nis not sufficient in itself to give title, it has no legal or effective\r\nforce, but can be compared with nomads squatting on the roadside and\r\nthen claiming a right to the soil. Italy was ashamed to assume the\r\nresponsibility for the original appropriation of Rieka, which was made\r\nin violation of every legal right of those to whom it belongs, and she\r\nmight well be, for a more audacious, unjustifiable proceeding in\r\nviolation of every principle of international law it is difficult to\r\nimagine.\" ... As for the Italian National Council, listen to the\r\nstirring sentences of Mr. Grossich, its old President, after they had\r\nunanimously voted on May 17, and with passionate conviction, an order of\r\nthe day directed to Orlando. In that order it was stated that they\r\nlooked upon the plebiscite of October 30, 1918, as an indestructible,\r\nhistorical and legal fact. Grossich exposed the situation and was then\r\nfor some instants mute. His voice was trembling when he spoke: \"The\r\nsacrifice which circumstances may demand is tremendous, but if it is\r\nrequired by the supreme interests of Italy we will know how to support\r\nit. More than a citizen of Fiume, I feel myself an Italian\" (\"Primo che\r\nfiumano mi sento italiano\"). At this point the old patriot broke into\r\ntears. \"Fiume will defend herself with arms against all those who desire\r\nto violate her will, her national conscience. Seeing that her tenacious,\r\nindestructible Italianity is a grave impediment for Italy in the\r\nattaining of other objects, let Fiume be left to look after herself,\r\nsure as she is of her sons, prepared as she is, to-day more than ever,\r\nto sacrifice herself. She will defend herself against all and from\r\nwherever they come.\" Those who listened thought that this must mean that\r\neither the _Pester Lloyd_ of April 29 was lying when it printed an\r\nofficial message stating that General Segre, the Italian representative\r\nat Vienna, had in the name of his Government requested the Hungarian\r\nSoviet Republic to undertake the care of Italian subjects in Rieka, or\r\nelse that the Magyars had told him that the 22,000 or 23,000 Italian\r\nsoldiers in Rieka ought to be sufficient, as this was practically one\r\nsoldier for every person who had been described as an Italian. But the\r\nI.N.C. had now resolved to take no risks; they entered into negotiations\r\nwith Sem Benelli, a well-known poet of the school which some critics\r\ncall enlivening and other critics call inflammatory. Anyhow, on the\r\nafternoon of June 13, Mr. Benelli was made a citizen of Rieka, a member\r\nof the central committee and was entrusted with the portfolio of\r\nMinister of War, that is to say Commissary for Defence. He thanked the\r\nI.N.C. in a long speech, and declared that his appointment was the\r\nwedding of Rieka and Italy. Then Dr. Vio proposed a law, respecting the\r\ndefence to the uttermost of Italian rights--that an army should be\r\ncreated and that the expenses should be met by the issue of bonds for a\r\nhundred million lire. The citizen Benelli was asked to undertake the\r\norganization and the command of the army.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL MILLO EXPLAINS THE SITUATION\r\n\r\nFarther down the coast and on the islands the Italians seemed, with few\r\nexceptions, to have relinquished every effort to make themselves popular\r\nwith the Slavs. Of course one naturally hears more of the cases of\r\ntension than of those where friendliness prevails; but in the towns or\r\nvillages where the Slav _intelligentsia_ appreciated that an officer was\r\ndoing his best, they were obliged invariably to add that he was doing it\r\nin spite of his men, and that his control of these men was more or less\r\ndefective. Numbers of the soldiers, marines and carabinieri may have\r\nbeen animated, when they landed in Dalmatia, with excellent intentions,\r\nbut their months amid an alien population had produced in them too often\r\na deplorable effect. It must be taken into account that many of them had\r\nan almost insurmountable desire to be demobilized. At Gradi[vs]ca, where\r\nmany Slovenes were interned, with fences round them but with no roof\r\nother than the sky, their guards with other soldiers had risen in\r\nrevolt. This outbreak was suppressed, certain soldiers--some say sixty,\r\nbut the number is doubtful--being shot; and all the others took an oath\r\nthat on the first occasion of a deserter being shot at, they would, down\r\nto the last man, leave the barracks. This movement had been growing\r\nsince the withdrawal of Bissolati from the Cabinet. As for the young\r\nofficers, they had been exhorted, in a communication from Admiral Millo,\r\nthe Governor, that they must realize the position they were in. The\r\nAdmiral's memorial, which was marked with wisdom but also with a\r\ntoo-sweeping air of superiority, was labelled \"Secret Document: No. 558\r\nof Register P. Section of Propaganda. Sebenico, March 21, 1919.\" A copy\r\nwas found by the Yugoslavs under an officer's mattress, was transcribed\r\nand replaced. Since it made admissions with regard to the Croats the\r\ncontents were telegraphed to Paris. It is a lengthy and to us at times a\r\nrather rhetorical expose, of which it will suffice to make some\r\nextracts. \"The Officer,\" says Admiral Millo, \"should place himself in a\r\ncalm and dignified fashion outside and above the disputes which divide\r\nthe sentiments of the local population. And in accounting,\r\npsychologically and historically, for the detestations and the\r\naspirations of either party, he must regard the situation with the\r\nserene mind of a judge.... The position of officers is extremely\r\ndelicate, more particularly in the small centres. It is known that\r\noutside the towns the population in its great majority and often its\r\ntotality consists of Yugo-Slavs or Slavs of the South, that is to say,\r\nCroats or Serbo-Croats. It is a people of another race, of that\r\nformidable Slav race which for centuries has been pressing against the\r\nWest, athirst for liberty and eager for the sea; a people with a\r\npsychology, a mentality, a civilization, habits, traditions, a national\r\nconsciousness and a quite special individuality. This population is\r\nfundamentally good, good as simple and primitive people are. But the\r\nsimple and primitive peoples are also extremely sensitive and suspicious\r\nand violent in their impulses.... May Heaven preserve the officers from\r\nnot taking these things into account and from letting themselves be\r\nguided solely by their Italian feelings.... Firm nerves, sangfroid and\r\nan evenly-balanced mind are required in order to prevent the hostility\r\nof the population from causing, as a reaction, resentment and a spirit\r\nof revolt, of vengeance and of oppression on our part. The officer must\r\n... become an element of moderation and pacification, with the object of\r\nassuaging and obviating the bitter feelings which have been created and\r\nfed by a past that is and must be wiped out for ever; and of dissipating\r\nthat hostility which, determined by a political situation and events,\r\nhas been and is being incited and strengthened by blind passions and an\r\nartificially created campaign of interested parties (_da artificiose\r\ninteressate campagna_).... It must be remembered that this is the first\r\ncontact (_il primo contatto_) which the population, as yet primitive and\r\nuncultured in its mass, has had with Italy, where it instinctively sees\r\nthe enemy and the new oppressor. We must do our best to make them see\r\nin Italy their friend and liberator.... It is evident and it leaps to\r\nthe eyes of all how delicate and important is the moment of this first\r\ncontact. Nothing more than a superficial knowledge of the circumstances\r\nis needed for the officer to understand that in all his official and\r\npersonal acts he must behave in such a manner that the population, which\r\nis primitive and simple and therefore all the more susceptible to\r\nsuggestions, should regain the impression that Italy is a great country,\r\nthe country of liberty and right, that its people is educated and\r\ncivilized, that its officers and soldiers are here to fulfil a work of\r\ncivilization and education, of love, in a country which must be Italian\r\non account of historic rights and for the exigencies of Italy's defence:\r\nin which the Slavs, who have been introduced by the course of events and\r\nas an effect of the expansive potentiality of their race and the\r\nartifices of those who dominated the country, will find in the\r\nindependence and development of their nationality a great fatherland\r\nwhich is civilized, powerful, humane and free.... In estimating the\r\nenmity of the Croats the fact must be taken into account that the\r\nCroatian world, I mean to say the Croat people, with its action in the\r\ninterior of Austria while the Italian army was acting outside,\r\nresolutely and victoriously, has co-operated in precipitating the\r\ndownfall of Austria and in freeing itself from a detested regime;\r\nparticularly in the last year of the War this sentiment of nationality\r\nbecame accentuated with the fervent aspiration for liberty.... These are\r\nthe circumstances which have determined a special psychology composed of\r\njoy and ecstasy--both elements which, in minds that are laden with all\r\nthe influences of the East, produce a facile and dangerous excitement.\r\nOn the other hand there survives in the Italian population the hatred\r\nagainst the Croatian supremacy, a hatred which is comprehensible but\r\nwhich in time must give place to other sentiments, rendering possible a\r\nfair coexistence of the two populations, whose aim should be common--the\r\nprosperity and development of Dalmatia, in the prosperity and for the\r\nprosperity, in the greatness and for the greatness of Italy. From this\r\npicture it must be instantly clear to every officer that his duty here\r\nis ... a truly lofty mission of civilization.... Especially the officer\r\nwho is in charge of administrative work must awaken impressions that\r\nare naturally caused by the sense of justice for all; his severity must\r\nbe good and his goodness must be severe, and from every act there must\r\ntranspire the dignity which comes from the might and right of Italy, the\r\nkindness and generosity which come from the virtue of the race.... There\r\nis already an impression on the part of the Croats that the Italians are\r\ngood, that Italy is strong. There must also be born and reinforced the\r\nother conviction that we are not oppressors but liberators.... The best\r\npropaganda, the most efficacious, because spontaneous and unexpected, is\r\ndone by the officer and his men. The Italian officer ... with the\r\nharmony of manners which distinguishes him, obtains very easily the\r\nsympathies of this population, a sympathy, however, which for an\r\noptimist may become dangerous. Young officers must not forget that the\r\npropagators of the great Yugoslavia still exercise with their\r\nmegalomania a potent influence over the primitive population and that a\r\ngesture of theirs, a word, an attitude, may even yet indirectly favour\r\nthe Croat cause and make difficulties for us in exhibiting our mission\r\nof civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS MISGUIDED SUBORDINATES AT [vS]IBENIK\r\n\r\nIt is strange that this order should have been so scurvily treated in\r\nthe town of [vS]ibenik, where it was issued and where the Admiral\r\nresided until the beginning of June, after which he transferred the seat\r\nof government to Zadar. At [vS]ibenik, by the way, the population\r\ncomprises 13,000 Yugoslavs and 400 Italianists. On February 20, 1919,\r\nthere arrived from Zadar, in consequence of an invitation from Admiral\r\nMillo, the Italian professor Domiaku[vs]i['c] who, according to the\r\nsixth clause of the Armistice, was justified in assuming the functions\r\nof school-controller, but was not authorized to become the inspector or\r\nin any way to interfere in didactic matters. Two inspectors existed in\r\nDalmatia, one for the elementary and one for the secondary school, but\r\nthe chief school authority of the province and the two inspectors under\r\nhim were not informed of Professor Domiaku[vs]i['c]'s nomination. If the\r\nGovernor intended him to abide by the stipulations of the Armistice, he\r\nmust have been astonished at the schools being shut on the day after\r\nhis arrival. And they remained shut, both the modern school and the\r\nmiddle-class girls' school for months, because the Professor's quite\r\nillegal attempt to usurp the inspectorship was resented. The secondary\r\nschool was closed and the teachers who had come to [vS]ibenik with their\r\nfamilies, but whose permanent domicile was elsewhere, received an order,\r\ndelivered by carabinieri, that they would have to leave the town in four\r\ndays. A few Italians were brought from Split and the school was\r\nreopened, but the attendance, which had been about 200, was now 24, and\r\nof these only two were the sons of Yugoslavs--but Yugoslavs who had\r\ntaken office under the Italians, one as President of the Court of\r\nJustice and the other as prison inspector; these gentlemen took their\r\nboys by the hand and led them to school. Perhaps the Admiral was unaware\r\nof these transactions; but various Yugoslav officials, whose salaries\r\nhad been withheld because they would not sign a paper asking to be made\r\nItalian officials, continued, notwithstanding, at their posts for two\r\nmonths; after which the Government perceived that by the clauses of the\r\nArmistice they were compelled to pay them. Each of them received exactly\r\nwhat was due, while some Italian teachers who had signed the paper were\r\ngiven a war bonus, extending over five months, of 80 per cent. Whether\r\nthe Admiral knew of this or not, it does not harmonize with his exalted\r\nsentiments. And the town-commandant spoke very darkly[37] on various\r\noccasions to the leading citizens of what would come to pass if the\r\nItalians by any chance were told to leave the place. His brave fellows,\r\nthe arditi, so he said, had plenty of machine guns and of ammunition.\r\nBut this fair-haired German-looking officer was a rampageous sort of\r\nperson who discharged, according to his lights, the Admiral's \"truly\r\nlofty mission of civilization.\" It was not he, but another of the\r\nAdmiral's subordinates at [vS]ibenik, who, when approached by a certain\r\nMr. Iva[vs]a Zori['c] with the request that something might be done to\r\nrelease his son, a prisoner of war in Italy, replied: \"Your son shall be\r\nreleased in eight days, provided that you declare, in writing, that you\r\nare content with the Italian occupation.\" On Mr. Zori['c] saying that he\r\nwas unable to do this, \"Very well,\" said the officer, \"then your son\r\nwill be one of the last to be set free.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIANS WANT TO TAKE NO RISKS\r\n\r\nAltogether one might say that the schoolmasters were being treated in a\r\nmanner that was at variance with the Admiral's document. To give a few\r\nexamples: Ivan Grbi['c], the schoolmaster at Sutomi[vs]cica, was\r\narbitrarily imprisoned and was afterwards removed to another school at\r\nPrivlaka. The Government school at the former place was closed, an\r\nItalian private institution being opened in the same building, with a\r\nteacher who was devoid of professional qualifications. The pupils of the\r\nschool which had been dissolved were compelled by soldiers to attend the\r\nnew Italian school. The elementary schools at Zemunik were likewise\r\nclosed and the schoolmasters, after a period of imprisonment, taken to\r\nanother village. If in the rather dreary little Zemunik, where there is\r\nnot one Italian, the schoolmaster was very dangerous to the might of\r\nItaly, let us compare with this the conduct of the Slovene authorities\r\nwho permitted more than one priest of the old regime to remain in\r\noffice--one of them at a village four or five miles from\r\nLjubljana--though they knew that these clergy were wont from the pulpit\r\nto utter disloyal sentiments. Maybe the Slovene Government was unwise,\r\nbut they had scruples in removing a priest; and moreover, they had not\r\ngiven up the hope that these gentlemen would by and by change their\r\nopinions. On the island of Pag the schoolmaster Buratovi['c] and his\r\nwife, who was also a teacher, had to fly in order to escape\r\nimprisonment. The schoolmaster Grimani of the same place was obliged,\r\nwith his wife, to follow the example of Buratovi['c], so that the school\r\nwas necessarily closed; and an Italian school was started in this island\r\nwith its 0.31 per cent. of Italians. The same edifying scenes must have\r\ntaken place as in so many Magyar schools where the pupils--Serbs,\r\nSlovaks, Roumanians and so forth--did not understand what the teacher\r\nwas saying. The Government of the occupied part of Dalmatia appointed to\r\nthe elementary schools at Rogoznica and Primo[vs]ten two young Italian\r\nlaw-students from Zadar, who had no pedagogic qualifications; and\r\nwhereas the legal annual salary was 1080 crowns, these lucky young men\r\nwere in receipt of 625 crowns a month, which covered more than\r\nhandsomely any depreciation in the currency. But now to another subject:\r\n\r\n                        Per cent. Yugoslavs.     Per cent. Italians.\r\n 1. Zadar                     with 80.25           with 18.61\r\n 2.

According to the census of 1900 the occupied territory\r\ncontained 35 communes, divided into 398 localities, with 297,181\r\ninhabitants. In 35 localities, with 14,659 inhabitants, the census was\r\nprevented by the Italians, who also confiscated the results of the\r\nplebiscite in the commune of Obrovac.[38] The delegates were therefore\r\nsuccessful in canvassing 95.07 per cent. of all the inhabitants. In 34\r\ncommunes the majority for union with Yugoslavia was over 90 per cent.,\r\nwhile in 24 it exceeded even 99 per cent. At Zadar (the town) out of\r\n14,056 inhabitants 6623 (= 47 per cent.) voted for Yugoslavia, while in\r\nthe suburbs, with a larger population, the majority was 89.57 per cent.\r\nIn the islands the majorities ranged from 96 per cent. to 100 per cent.\r\nAnd if any doubts were entertained as to these figures, the delegates\r\nwere authorized to propose another plebiscite under the control of a\r\ndisinterested Allied Power.\r\n\r\n\r\nYET THEY ARE INCREDIBLY NONCHALANT\r\n\r\nDalmatia, as is shown by the number of emigrants, is not a wealthy\r\nprovince; and one would have supposed that if the Italians thought it\r\nnecessary to occupy a country whose inhabitants were so unmistakably\r\nopposed to them, it would have been--to put it at the lowest--politic to\r\nhamper no one in the getting of his livelihood. Austria had established\r\nfourteen military fishing centres (besides others in Rieka, Istria,\r\netc.), and these the Croats joined most willingly, as a means of\r\navoiding service in a hated army. After the war, when their nets were\r\nworn out, Italy supplied her Chioggia fisherfolk with new ones. Owing to\r\nthe conditions of the Triple Alliance, the Italians enjoyed the right to\r\n\"high-sea\" fishing, that is to say, the fishing up to three miles from\r\nthe Dalmatian coast; but now the Italian boats occupied all the rich\r\nfishing grounds among the northern islands. These dispossessed natives\r\nwere originally more preoccupied with fish than with Italians. Is it\r\nstrange that they refused to see that Italy was, in the words of Admiral\r\nMillo, the friend and liberator?... A German firm, the Steinbeiss\r\nCompany, had built in Bosnia a very narrow-gauge line for the\r\nexploitation of its forests; during the War this line was continued to\r\nPrijedor, and with great difficulty it had served for the transport of\r\nfood-stuff and passengers from Croatia: on the Croatian lines up to\r\nSissak normal gauge; from there to Prijedor narrow gauge; from there to\r\nKnin very narrow gauge, and from there to Split or [vS]ibenik narrow\r\ngauge. Thus with the loading and unloading between 30 per cent. and 50\r\nper cent. of the goods were lost; but when Italy sat down at Rieka the\r\ninhabitants of Dalmatia looked to this line. At Prijedor hundreds of\r\nwaggons of wheat and corn were waiting to be forwarded, and with Italy\r\nblocking the road at Knin they simply perished.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THEIR VICTIMS\r\n\r\nThe Italian administration of Dalmatia--economically, politically,\r\nscholastically, ecclesiastically and financially (as we will show)--was\r\nthoroughly mistaken. Wherever one goes one is overwhelmed with evidence;\r\nit is impossible to print more than a tithe of it. But the mention of\r\nKnin recalls the case of Dr. Bogi['c], who was deported to Sardinia for\r\npolitical reasons. On January 1 he was arrested, together with a\r\nFranciscan monk, a schoolmaster and others, transported to [vS]ibenik\r\nand put into a cell devoid of bed, light or a window. Thence, with\r\nnothing to eat, although the weather was wintry, he was taken on to the\r\nS.S. _Almissa_, bound for Ancona. Near [vS]ibenik the boat collided with\r\nthe isle of Zlarin; he and the other prisoners attempted to get out of\r\ntheir cabin, but carabinieri kept them there by flourishing revolvers in\r\ntheir faces. At Ancona, Spoleto, Perugia, Florence and Leghorn the\r\ndoctor was always lodged in prisons, had his finger-prints taken, had to\r\nstand up to salute the warders, had to look on while his things were\r\nstolen--at Ancona, for instance, they despoiled him of eighty cigars.\r\nHis wrists were always bound; he was attached not only to his\r\nfellow-travellers but to Italians who were under life-sentences. The\r\ncarabinieri cut up their bread, put it on their knees and then, without\r\nunbinding the ropes, left them to eat it as best they could. The journey\r\nwas very slow; thus from Perugia to Florence--being all the time\r\nattached to one another--it took sixteen hours. Dr. Conti, the prison\r\ndoctor at Florence, said that Dr. Bogi['c] was ill, but as he declined\r\nto give him a certificate the journey was resumed. From Florence to\r\nLeghorn he was bound so tightly that his wrists were very much swollen.\r\nFrom Leghorn in the S.S. _Derna_ he was shipped to Sardinia, where he\r\nhad experience of several prisons, including that of Terranuova-Pausania,\r\nwhere water flows down the walls and vermin are everywhere. He received\r\n2.75 lire a day with which to buy his food, and although he is a doctor\r\nthey refused to let him read any medical books. When I asked him of what\r\nhe had been guilty, he began by recounting his war work. Over 6000\r\nItalian prisoners were at Knin, and he was there as military doctor for\r\nmore than two years. These Italians were employed on the railway line\r\nand--as is clear from the letters they wrote to him after their\r\nrelease--letters some of which I read--they had very friendly\r\nrecollections of the doctor. Once in the summer of 1918 a group of\r\nItalians arrived who had been, in the doctor's words, \"bestially\r\nmaltreated at Zala-Egerseg by the Magyars.\" Dozens died on the way to\r\nKnin, others while they were being got out of the station, others on\r\nthe way to the hospital. They were nothing but skeletons, dressed almost\r\nexclusively in paper clothes. General Wucherer happened to be at Knin\r\nand to him the doctor reported that the Italians had been treated in an\r\nabsolutely criminal fashion. Wucherer, who was a decent fellow, ordered\r\nthe doctor to dictate the whole affair and said that if nothing else\r\ncould be done he would go direct to His Majesty. Then standing up he\r\nstruck the table, in the presence of his staff, of Dr. Grgin of Split\r\nand of the railway commandant Captain Bergmann, and \"Wir sind doch die\r\ngroessten Schuften!\" he exclaimed (\"After all, it is we who are the\r\nbiggest scoundrels!\").... When the Yugoslavs overthrew the Austrian\r\nGovernment at Knin, the doctor, a kindly-looking, little, bald man, made\r\na speech to the prisoners from the balcony of the town hall. He armed\r\ntwo of the Italians and ten French prisoners, whom he told off to guard\r\nthe magazine. The two Italians (Cirillo Tomba and Mario Favelli)\r\nvanished after a couple of days; the French remained for a week, and\r\nwhen a French destroyer arrived at Split they were taken there, not as\r\nprisoners but as soldiers, bearing arms. Dr. Bogi['c] was a member of\r\nthe National Committee at Knin, and as such he wrote to a colleague at\r\nDrni[vs] to ask him whether the Italian troops were coming up from\r\n[vS]ibenik. This letter was his undoing. The reason he wrote it was\r\nbecause the population at Knin was extremely agitated by the prospective\r\noccupation and begged him to ascertain the latest news. He should have\r\nremembered, no doubt, that the Italians regarded this as enemy country\r\nand that to make inquiries with regard to the movement of troops was a\r\ncrime. An officer came and asked him, in the General's name, if he would\r\nkindly take part in a conference; on reaching the place which was\r\nindicated he found himself surrounded by carabinieri. Their captain, a\r\ncertain Albano, said that he and two or three others must go to\r\n[vS]ibenik to undergo a short interrogatory, and that as he would return\r\nin two days at the latest it was unnecessary for him to take any money,\r\nclothes or linen. As a matter of fact the doctor had, on the previous\r\nday, been warned from Split that the Italians meant to intern him; but\r\nhe laughed--he had done so much for them and he felt so innocent that\r\nit seemed absurd to run away. He could have gone, because he had a\r\nwritten permit issued to him on January 10 by the 144th Italian infantry\r\nregiment at Knin, which stated that he and his wife might go, whenever\r\nthey wished, to Split.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVEN HUNDRED OTHERS\r\n\r\nDuring the winter and spring over seven hundred persons, chiefly\r\nbelonging to the clerical, the legal and the medical professions, had\r\nbeen deported from Dalmatia. The leader of the Italian party at Zadar\r\ntold me that two of them had written him from Nocera Umbra, saying that\r\nthis, their place of interment, was a health resort and that they were\r\ngetting fat. He scouted the idea that they were under any sort of\r\ncompulsion when they wrote or that they were pulling his leg. One must\r\nanyhow congratulate them in not being taken to Sardinia, as were the\r\nvast majority. Those who managed to return from that island--among them\r\nDr. Macchiedo of Zadar, through the intervention of Bissolati, on\r\naccount of Mrs. Macchiedo being at death's door--said that they found in\r\nSardinia what they had expected of a penal establishment. Many priests\r\nwere deported, on account of crimes which varied in enormity. A very\r\nfrequent cause was that they refused to preach in Italian to a\r\ncongregation which only understood Serbo-Croat. One must say that the\r\nItalians exhibited no religious partiality, for they treated the Roman\r\nCatholic Church just the same as the Orthodox. Some of the persecutions\r\nwere so fatuous that one could only suppose they must be due to a\r\nmisunderstanding. To mention only one which came under my observation at\r\nSkradin, not far from [vS]ibenik, where the Orthodox priest in his\r\nsumptuous vestments had led his congregation out of the old town in\r\norder to perform an annual ceremony in connection with the fertility of\r\nthe fields. In what way was the Italian cause assisted when carabinieri\r\nbroke up that procession and refused even to allow the people to walk\r\nback on the road, so that all of them, including the priest and the\r\nother church officials with the sacred emblems, were forced to go back\r\nto Skradin as best they could by wading through the marshes?\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE OF THE OFFICIAL ROBBERIES\r\n\r\nAn allusion has been made to the Italian financial methods. More than\r\none Italian officer, including Admiral Millo, spoke to me about the\r\nAustrian currency, which seemed to them one of the gravest problems. In\r\nYugoslavia these notes were only legal tender if they had the Government\r\nstamp, and the Italians resolved that in the territories which they\r\noccupied the notes must have no stamp upon them. So far, so good. But\r\nwhen some poor peasant came across the line of demarcation from Croatia\r\nor else landed somewhere in a boat the Italians were not making good\r\npropaganda for themselves when they seized the notes, tore them up and\r\nrefused to give their victim a receipt. One poor fellow whom I know of\r\ncame with his mother along that wonderful road which the Austrians built\r\nover the mountains and down to Obrovac. He had some serious affection of\r\nthe eyes and was compelled to go to Zadar to consult an oculist. He took\r\nwith him practically all his fortune, as he and his mother did not know\r\nwhat otherwise to do with it. They had never yet made use of a bank.\r\nWell, the Italians tore up the notes and told him testily to go about\r\nhis business. The same thing happened to the following persons:\r\n\r\n                                                                   Crowns.\r\n 1. March 22, 1919.

One has to take their\r\nword for it that the list is not fictitious. I did not investigate any\r\nof the cases; the Italian officers to whom I showed the list said that\r\nthey were persuaded I would find that in every case the person culpable\r\nwas an officious, ignorant N.C.O. The list is, of course, no more than a\r\nfragment. At Starigrad, on the island of Hvar, I was told that from the\r\npeople, who were searched both on landing and on leaving, 40,000 crowns\r\nhad been confiscated, and at first they had been told that the money\r\nshould be stamped. A merchant whom I happened to meet during the few\r\nhours I was at Metkovi['c] told me that he had gone to the island of\r\nKor[vc]ula to his brother and, on landing, had been relieved of 34,000\r\ncrowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND HARSHNESS AND BRIBERY\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor we have another disastrous example of the Allied policy of\r\nallowing a disputed zone to be occupied _ad interim_ solely by the\r\ntroops of one interested country. The chronic state of war which\r\nfollowed the landing of the Greeks at Smyrna, the atrocities, the\r\ncharges and the counter-charges, were investigated by an Inter-Allied\r\nCommission of Inquiry; and their report, which was issued early in 1920\r\nand was signed by an American Admiral and French, Italian and British\r\nGenerals, laid the responsibility at the door of the Greek Higher\r\nCommand. The Commission considered that an inter-Allied occupation was\r\nnecessary, because the Greeks, instead of maintaining order, had given\r\ntheir position all the characteristics of a permanent occupation, the\r\nTurkish authorities being powerless. They also considered that order\r\nshould be maintained by inter-Allied troops other than Greek.... No such\r\nCommission visited Dalmatia, chiefly because the Yugoslavs, in spite of\r\nendless provocations, displayed greater self-control than the Turks. But\r\nan Inter-Allied Inquiry would have reported that the Italian regime had\r\nnot the marks of a permanent occupation simply because such methods\r\ncould never be permanent: everywhere in the occupied territory it was\r\nforbidden, under severe penalties, to have any Serbo-Croat newspaper. On\r\none island I found about fifteen gentlemen gathered round a table in a\r\nsort of dungeon, reading the newspapers which had been smuggled into\r\ntheir possession. This they had been doing for more than six months.\r\nEvery letter was censored, all telegraphic and telephonic communication\r\nbetween the occupied territory and the outside world was prohibited. All\r\nflags, of course, except that of Italy, were vetoed. Admiral Millo told\r\nus that this prohibition did not extend to the flags of France, Great\r\nBritain and the United States; considering that it is on record when and\r\nwhere the flags of these nations were, if flown by civilians, ordered to\r\nbe taken down at Rieka, despite the presence of Allied contingents, it\r\nseems scarcely worth saying that, as we were often told, the Admiral's\r\npermission, which was in accordance with the Armistice, was disregarded\r\nby his subordinates. Another thing that was very rigorously forbidden,\r\nespecially on the islands, was for any Yugoslav to go down to the\r\nharbour, if a boat came in, and carry on a conversation with somebody on\r\nboard. It would be tedious to enter into all the questionable and\r\ntyrannical Italian methods, such as the requisitioning of Yugoslav\r\nclubs, schools, etc., sometimes leaving them empty because they found\r\nthey did not want them, the requisitioning of private houses, with no\r\nconsideration for their owners, the wholesale cutting-down of forests,\r\nthe closing of law-courts, the demand that other courts should pronounce\r\nno judgment before first submitting it to them. But, above all, what the\r\nYugoslav Government at Split complained of were the methods they\r\nemployed in the gratuitous or semi-gratuitous distribution of food,\r\nclothing and money:\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF DALMATIA AND OF THE DALMATIAN ISLANDS AND OF THE CURZOLA\r\nISLANDS\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: _Question of Food Supplies for the Civil Population._\r\n\r\nNo. 43. _March_ 18, 1919.\r\n\r\nTo all subject authorities:\r\n\r\nI have heard that several commanding officers who have to distribute\r\nfood to the civilian population have, by virtue of an authorization that\r\nthey may save part of the entered amounts for the purpose of using that\r\nsum for propaganda, saved a conspicuous quantity without having the\r\npossibility of using it later. As it has been ascertained that the only\r\neffective means of propaganda is the distribution of food supplies ...\r\namounts which are useless [for other purposes] and absolutely necessary\r\nfor purposes of propaganda.\r\n\r\nTHE VICE-ADMIRAL\r\nTHE GOVERNOR,\r\nE. MILLO.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nROYAL GOVERNMENT OF DALMATIA AND OF THE DALMATIAN ISLANDS AND OF THE\r\nCURZOLA ISLANDS\r\n\r\nSTAFF. SECTION OF PROPAGANDA, No. Prot. \"P.\" SEBENICO, _April_ 18, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe section of propaganda of the Government of Dalmatia, whose object is\r\nthe rapid diffusion of Italianity in this noble region which gives at\r\nlast to Italy the complete dominion over the most bitter Adriatic, has\r\nset before itself a vast programme of truly Italian action ... it is\r\ntherefore necessary to give these latter certain advantages ... it has\r\nbeen suggested that Italian schools be favoured ... that offices be\r\nopened for the gratuitous or semi-gratuitous distribution of food, that\r\npresents be given to the indigent population, that fetes and spectacles\r\nbe organized.\r\n\r\n[Signature illegible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two documents give some indication of the plan of campaign. One\r\nmight mention, by the bye, that during this period there was a great\r\nshortage of food-stuffs in Italy; large quantities were being sent from\r\nthe United States. The Yugoslav Government at Split complained of the\r\ndisastrous social and moral results of these proceedings. It gave rise\r\nto many abuses and to a clandestine trade. On the young it had, for\r\nexample, at Split a most unhealthy influence; all they had to do was to\r\ngo on board the _Puglia_, the Italian flagship, whether their parents\r\nallowed them or not, and there they were given both provisions and cash.\r\nAs elsewhere in the world there are at Split a number of idlers and\r\nscamps, who seized this opportunity; another class of person, who had\r\nerstwhile been regarded as Austrian spies, did not hesitate a moment to\r\nproclaim that they were the most ardent Italian patriots. All these\r\npeople were ready enough to give their signatures to anything in return\r\nfor the Italian bounty, and to endeavour to persuade others to do so; in\r\nthat way the Italians collected 6000 signatures, whereas the Italianists\r\nof Split were, at the outside, 1800; at Trogir, where the Italianists\r\nnumbered 80 to 100, they collected more than 1000 signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIANS IN DALMATIA BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR\r\n\r\nTo grasp the conditions at Split we must go back to the years just\r\nbefore the War. From the reports of the Austrian Intelligence Officer,\r\nCaptain Bukvich, we shall see what was the attitude of the Slavs and the\r\nItalianists respectively towards the Government, and hence towards each\r\nother. It may be that the very loyal, some would call it cringing,\r\nattitude of the Italianists was forced upon them by the great\r\ninferiority of their numbers. What they were aiming at, with very few\r\nexceptions, were the benefits of the moment, rather than those others of\r\nwhich here and there an isolated Italianist would dream, when between\r\nthe smoke of his cigarette he saw the Italian tricolour flying over\r\nDalmatia. If this lonely dreamer had gone to Italy before the War with\r\nthe purpose of awakening in people an interest in what some day might\r\nhappen, he would have found that most of the Italians had never heard of\r\nDalmatia. But among those who had heard were the officials of the \"Liga\r\nNazionale,\" which assisted the Dalmatian Italians to support those\r\nfamous schools. In a report (Information No. 668) which Padouch, the\r\nsuccessor of Bukvich as Intelligence Officer, sent from Split on\r\nSeptember 25, 1915, to the Headquarters at Mostar, we are told that \"an\r\nItalian of this place, with whom I confidentially spoke on the subject\r\nbefore the outbreak of the War, openly and candidly told me that in\r\ntheir Liga school one-third of the children, at the most, have parents\r\nwhose nationality has always been Italian. The others are children of\r\nthe people, of that class which on account of its humble social position\r\nhas lost its national consciousness. He told me that the parents\r\nreceived subsidies and the children clothes, school-books, etc.,\r\ngratuitously.\"\r\n\r\nThe reports of Captain Bukvich were sent to his superiors at Mostar. No\r\ndoubt a great many documents were destroyed just before the Austrian\r\ncollapse, as the Government had ordered to be done--three boxes,\r\npresumably containing copies, are known to have been committed to the\r\nflames at Split, while at Zadar there was a wholesale destruction on\r\nOctober 31. Yet a fair number of interesting papers survived,\r\nprincipally at Mostar, Castelnuovo, Metkovi['c] and Dubrovnik. In 1913\r\nCaptain Bukvich sent many reports to the effect that Split was\r\ncompletely anti-Austrian and that the Italian party were the only loyal\r\npeople. On September 16 he said that the inhabitants believe in the\r\ncoming of a great Serbia, and he substantiates this with numerous\r\ninstances. \"The students over thirteen years of age,\" he says, \"are all\r\nSerbophil, and most of the masters, professors and State clerks.... The\r\nchief paper in Split is Serbophil and has been confiscated twenty-seven\r\ntimes between October 1912 and September 1913.\" He reported on August\r\n19, 1913 (Information No. 211), to the General Staff of the Imperial and\r\nRoyal 16th Corps at Dubrovnik with reference to the Francis Joseph\r\ncelebrations of the previous day: \"... only the public buildings and a\r\nfew other houses were beflagged. One must notice the satisfactory\r\nconduct and the finely decorated houses of the autonomous Italian\r\nparty.\" On February 27, 1914 (Information No. 62), he narrates that a\r\nbig dinner was given at the bishop's palace to celebrate the centenary\r\nof the incorporation of Dalmatia into the Habsburg monarchy; all the\r\nchief citizens were invited to this dinner, but the Croat deputies, Dr.\r\nTrumbi['c], Dr. Smodlaka and other Croats declined with thanks. Dr.\r\nSalvi, however, of the autonomous Italian party, put in an appearance.\r\nOn July 31 (Information No. 267) he refers to the mobilized men who\r\nmarched through the town and were put on board ship. \"The attitude,\" he\r\nsays, \"of the Slav _intelligentsia_ was quite passive. The Italian band\r\nwaited for the troops, a procession was improvised, great ovations took\r\nplace, and enthusiasm was shown by the Autonomous party, who called:\r\n'Hoch Austria! Hoch the Emperor! Hoch the War! Down with Serbia! Down\r\nwith the Serbian municipality!'\" A certain Demeter, an Austrian naval\r\nlieutenant, was a spectator of these scenes. He made some notes for the\r\ntypist, afterwards embodied in a report to the Military Command at\r\nMostar and marked \"Secret No. 147.\" He relates, with unconcealed fury,\r\nhow the Slavs not merely displayed no raptures when the War proclamation\r\nwas read, but walked away in the midst of the recital and refrained from\r\nfollowing the band, which later on paraded the town. Only the Italians,\r\nhe said, exhibited the proper feeling. They did more than that; for with\r\nthe same date, July 31, one finds an interesting letter from the\r\n\"Societa del Tiro al Bersaglio\" of Split, which called itself a shooting\r\nclub, but was not in possession of arms; it was, as a matter of fact, a\r\ngymnastic society with a political object. The secretary, Luigi Puisina,\r\nwrote on the 31st to the authorities, to say that they had determined to\r\noffer themselves in uniform for any service of a military nature (\"per\r\nquei qualsiasi servizi di carattere militare\"). Bukvich reported on\r\nAugust 3 (Information No. 268) that for the present these gymnasts will\r\nbe used as special constables, and he adds, to one's astonishment, that\r\nthis has caused the Slav _intelligentsia_ to be still more profoundly\r\ndepressed. Nothing could elude the eagle eye of Bukvich: on December 17,\r\n1914, he noted that the small boys in the streets were winking and\r\nsmiling at each other in consequence of the news that the Austrians had\r\nbeen driven out of Belgrade.\r\n\r\nWhen Italy entered the War a handful of Dalmatian Italians--I believe\r\nsix from Zadar and two from Split--went to serve in the Italian army.\r\nFive others, four of them from Zadar, were interned at Graz; with these\r\nexceptions the Italians and Italianists were very much more faithful to\r\nthe Austrian Empire than were the Croats, hundreds of whom were hanged\r\nor shot or lodged in fortresses. The Italians, however, persist in\r\ncharging the Croats with unbounded fidelity; in fact, it is one of their\r\nmost powerful arguments. They themselves in Split continued to do what\r\nthe Austrians expected of them: those who were of military age became\r\nunits of the army, while the rest of them, with one exception, were not\r\nincommoded. The President of their club, the \"Cabinetto di Lettura,\"\r\nthat Dr. Salvi of whom we have heard, was not only most assiduous in\r\naddressing letters of devotion and fidelity to the Emperor, in promoting\r\nall kinds of patriotic Austrian manifestations, but as the particular\r\nfriend of Mr. Tszilvas, the Austrian sub-prefect, he was wont to go down\r\nwith him to the harbour and watch the embarkation, in chains, of the\r\nSlav _intelligentsia_. The only Italian who suffered this fate was a Mr.\r\nTocigl, with whom Dr. Salvi had had a personal difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENT SUSPICION OF THIS MINORITY\r\n\r\nOne cannot therefore be surprised if the Slavs, on the collapse of\r\nAustria, regarded the Italian party, and especially Dr. Salvi, with\r\nsome suspicion. Since they had always placed themselves at Austria's\r\ndisposal, it would be most natural if they attempted by a _coup d'etat_\r\nto save the Empire. Yet this was the moment when they joined the Slavs\r\nand helped to turn the Austrians out. There was no notion then that the\r\nItalian army would succeed the Austrian; and it was not until Christmas\r\nthat this army tried to enter Split. When they proposed to come ashore\r\nthey were prevented by the French, Americans and British; thereupon they\r\nthreatened to come overland--although the town was not included in the\r\nLondon Treaty--but again they were prevented. In February, on the\r\noccasion of a conference between the four Admirals, there was a\r\ndemonstration against Italy, the commandant of the _Puglia_ being struck\r\nand Admiral Rombo's chief of staff insulted. There was a widespread\r\nfeeling of resentment at the way in which the _Puglia_ was, as we have\r\nseen, availing herself of the baser elements in the town for the\r\nfurtherance of her propaganda; but what put the match to the bonfire was\r\nthe omission of certain Italians in uniform to salute the Serbian\r\nNational Anthem. The Admirals held an inquiry, found that \"officers\r\nbelonging to an Allied nation have been molested.\" They announced that\r\nthey would not tolerate a repetition of such acts, and that inter-Allied\r\npatrols, acting with Serbian troops and the local police force, would\r\ntake measures to prevent them. On March 8, however, there was a renewal\r\nof the troubles; and again the Admirals made an inquiry. The Italian\r\nmember of the Commission added to his signature that he disapproved of\r\nthe findings and that he would present a special report.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLIED CENSURE OF THE ITALIAN NAVY\r\n\r\n\"By general conviction,\" says the Admirals' summing up, \"there exist at\r\nSplit two political parties which are in sharp contradiction as to the\r\nfuture status of Dalmatia. The presence of Allied ships, and especially\r\nthe Italian ones, has increased this contradiction rather than\r\ndiminished it. On the day when disorders broke out at Split a few\r\nItalian sailors had made a small demonstration a little before the\r\nincidents. Certain movements and words on the part of youths,\r\nsympathizers with Yugoslavia, offended the Italian sailors. They were\r\nbold enough to arrest two of these youths.... This procedure of\r\narresting them naturally and inevitably moved the great majority of the\r\nbystanders and was the actual cause of outrages. This act was approved\r\nby the Italian Naval Authorities, who accordingly are to be considered\r\nresponsible for these disorders.... Several civilians and Serbian\r\nsoldiers were wounded.\" The report adds that some Italian sailors were\r\narmed with knives and revolvers, contrary to the regulations of the\r\nItalian Naval Authorities, and concludes with these words: \"By arresting\r\nsome citizens the Italian sailors have committed an illegal act, which\r\nthey carried out according to instructions that were given them by the\r\nItalian Naval Authorities. Accordingly the Commission considers these\r\nauthorities responsible for the injuries inflicted on the Serbian\r\nsoldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVERTHELESS THE TYRANNY CONTINUES\r\n\r\nBut in many parts of Dalmatia and the islands the Italians had no fear\r\nof such a Commission. Let us see what they had been doing in the\r\nneighbourhood of Zadar, the old capital. Apart from the usual\r\nprohibitions with respect to newspapers and so forth, the municipalities\r\nwere dissolved and an Italian commissary installed. Their first task was\r\nto introduce the Italian language and make it obligatory, although the\r\ncommissary's own employees would often be not more acquainted with it\r\nthan with Hindustani. Eighty-five per cent. of the civil servants in the\r\noccupied territory were Yugoslavs; during March and April 1919 they were\r\ndeprived of their salaries because they had declined, in accordance with\r\nthe existing laws and particularly in accordance with the terms of the\r\nArmistice, to make a request in Italian to the Provisional Government\r\nthat they should be confirmed in their posts. This outrageous order,\r\nwhich left hundreds of families without the means of subsistence, was\r\nnot merely illegal--let alone inhumane--but was in contradiction with an\r\nearlier order issued by Admiral Millo, which was placarded throughout\r\nthe territory and which confirmed in their posts all the civil\r\nemployees. However, the Italians were unsuccessful in their efforts to\r\nobtain these signatures, though they did not abandon their watchword:\r\n\"Either Italy or starvation!\" They never ceased to persecute the\r\npeasants of the surrounding country and islands. Commands, menaces,\r\nblows inflicted by carabinieri and officers, houses searched night after\r\nnight, and so on.... In the second half of February it was intended to\r\nconduct a number of peasants, accompanied by Italian flags, to Zadar, so\r\nthat they might thank the Admiral, who chanced to be there, for the\r\nbenefits which Italy had bestowed upon them. An officer who in this\r\nbranch achieved particular distinction was Lieutenant de Sanctis, the\r\nCommandant of Preko, a village opposite Zadar. Bread and Italian\r\npromises were dangled before these poverty-stricken fisherfolk and\r\npeasants; they refused to take part in the ridiculous demonstration, and\r\nin order to avoid being made to go they concealed themselves and even\r\nwent to the length of sinking their boats. In the possession of a\r\npeasant at Preko, [vS]ime [vS]ari['c] Mazi['c], were found some\r\nbanknotes with a Yugoslav stamp on them and a very small French flag;\r\nfor these transgressions de Sanctis ordered first that he should receive\r\na box on the ears, after which he was bound, thrown into prison, and\r\nthere flogged by carabinieri who, as two doctors afterwards certified,\r\ninflicted serious injuries upon his hands, which they beat with chains.\r\nFor the same reasons and at the same place a peasant called Mate\r\nLon[vc]ar was imprisoned and wounded with a bayonet. On March 2 at Preko\r\nthe Italians, enraged because the people had not come to their\r\ndemonstration, dispersed with sticks all those who were assembled in\r\nfront of the church, and prevented the Mass from being celebrated. On\r\nMarch 29 the aforementioned Lon[vc]ar was condemned to three years'\r\nimprisonment because 11,780 crowns, unstamped notes, had been found on\r\nhim; the notes, of course, were confiscated. Such notes, by the way,\r\nwere given or received in payment by Italian merchants at a discount of\r\n10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. Even the military used these\r\nforbidden notes, and compelled the peasants at the market to accept\r\nthem. In the night of March 15-16 six of the leading Yugoslavs of\r\nZadar, who had not ceased to advise the people to bear their present\r\nmisfortunes in patience, were suddenly arrested and deported to Italy;\r\nthey included Mr. Joseph de Ton[vc]i['c], President of the Yugoslav Club\r\nand formerly the Deputy-Governor of Dalmatia; he was a man seventy-two\r\nyears of age and in precarious health. During this same night forty\r\npersons were deported from Knin, three from Drni[vs], three from\r\nObrovac, four from Skradin, nine from [vS]ibenik and four from\r\nBenkovac.... On the populous island of Olib (Ulbo) the abuses connected\r\nwith the distribution of food were exceptionally flagrant; here the\r\nItalian officers compelled everyone to stand still, bare-headed, when\r\nthey passed; they would not allow anyone to leave the island, and\r\nforbade the peasants to speak Croatian! On the opposite island of Silba\r\n(Selve) the schoolmaster, Matulina, and the priest, an old man of\r\nseventy-five, called Lovrovi['c], were imprisoned. The latter had told\r\nhis parishioners, in the course of a sermon, to behave well during Lent\r\nand keep away from the Italian sailors. He was thereupon shipped to\r\nZadar and thrust into a moist and dirty dungeon, where for two days and\r\nnights he was at the mercy of six criminals.... After having seen at\r\nZadar a number of persons belonging to each party, I had the pleasure of\r\nmeeting Dr. Boxich. It was indeed a pleasure, because this thin,\r\nhighly-strung Italianized Slav, the former chief of the Radical Italian\r\nparty, was full of the most fraternal sentiments towards the Slavs. If,\r\nhe said, their peasants lacked education, one ought to assist them; not\r\nto do so was a sin against humanity. It had been the desire, he said, of\r\nhis party, both before and during the War, to work openly against the\r\nAustrian Government, unlike the Moderate Italian party, of Ziliotto,\r\nwhich feigned to be very pro-Austrian. While Ziliotto was receiving high\r\nAustrian decorations, he was an object of persecution, and was obliged\r\nto go away and live for two and a half years in Rome. Ziliotto, he said,\r\nwas Zadar's evil spirit, seeing that he had thoroughly deceived and\r\nbetrayed Italy--so many of those who now called themselves good Italians\r\nhad been very good Austrians, and would as readily have turned into good\r\nAmericans or Frenchmen. So petty and local was Ziliotto's party, with\r\nno idea of the world or of freedom. In fact, I thought that if a\r\nYugoslav had listened to the doctor's eloquence he would have overlooked\r\na recent lapse or two, when Boxich, in order to prove to Admiral Millo\r\nthat he was a much better Italian than Ziliotto, was alleged by the\r\nYugoslavs to have committed various dark deeds in connection with a hunt\r\nfor hidden arms. The Admiral also had told me that he was not pleased\r\nwith Dr. Boxich. \"At present,\" said the doctor to me, \"I am isolated,\r\nand I am proud of it. This is not the time to found a party of ideas;\r\nthe atmosphere is too morbid, too passionate. This is the time,\" he\r\nsaid, \"for an honourable man to remain isolated and to stay at home.\"\r\n... Several weeks after this at Sarajevo, I read in a Zagreb newspaper, the\r\n_Rije['c] S.H.S._, that Dr. Boxich, on account of having--exceptionally,\r\nthe paper said--spoken the truth to a passing foreigner, had been\r\ndeported to Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO SOME OF THE ISLANDS\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to be at Split without meeting people who had fled\r\nfrom the occupied islands. It was also, in consequence of what they told\r\none, impossible to set out with an unprejudiced mind. But, after all, we\r\nhave our preconceived ideas on Heaven and Hell, and that will be no\r\nreason for us not to go there. I had become acquainted at Split with\r\nCaptain Pommerol, of the British Army, a Mauritian of imposing physique\r\nand, as I was to see, of a lofty sense of justice. He had recently been\r\nspending several months in Hungary on a mission from the War Office.\r\nThey had now dispatched him to Dalmatia and Bosnia with a very\r\ncomprehensive programme; and, as I secured a little steamer, he came\r\nwith me to the islands. [We hesitated to embark on this expedition,\r\nsince the islanders whose national desires had been choked for so many\r\nmonths would probably display their sentiments in such a way as to bring\r\ndown grave penalties upon themselves. But the Yugoslavs, both on the\r\nmainland and on the islands, were anxious that we should go; they\r\ndoubted whether Western Europe had any knowledge of the Italian methods\r\nof administration. And if the immediate result of our journey would be\r\nto call down upon themselves--as indeed it did--a savage wind, they were\r\noptimistic enough to feel that it would eventually produce a whirlwind\r\nfor their oppressors.] ... The S.S. _Porer_, 130 tons, was flying at the\r\nstern the temporary flag of white, blue, white in horizontal stripes\r\nwhich had been invented for the ships of the former Austro-Hungarian\r\nmercantile marine; on the second mast they displayed the flag of one of\r\nthe Allies, and the _Porer_ happened to be sailing under the red ensign.\r\nShe had a Dalmatian crew of eight, including the weather-beaten old\r\ncaptain and the still older and equally benevolent gentleman who\r\ncombined the functions of cook and steward. In addition to Serbo-Croat,\r\nthey had among them some knowledge of Italian, German and even English.\r\nThe scholar was the mate who, having had his headquarters at Pola during\r\nthe War, spoke Viennese-German. His wife had died at Split after an\r\nillness of several months, brought on by the idea that her husband had\r\nbeen killed at Pola in an air-raid.\r\n\r\nThe large, rather waterless island of Bra['c], which is nearest to the\r\nmainland, seems to be chiefly remarkable on account of its\r\nchrysanthemums, from which an insect-powder is produced; and the number\r\nof changes, no less than twenty, that occurred in the ownership of the\r\nisland from the beginning of the Middle Ages down to the Congress of\r\nVienna. During that period it was sometimes under the Byzantines,\r\nsometimes the Venetians, the Holy Roman Empire, its own autonomous\r\nGovernment, the Hungarians, the Bosnians, the French, the Russians (one\r\nyear, in 1806) and the Austrians. It was not occupied by Italy after the\r\nend of this War, and Baron Sonnino did not ask for it when he was\r\nnegotiating, before the War, with Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH THE ITALIANS HAD TRIED TO OBTAIN BEFORE, BUT NOT DURING, THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government put forward the question of the islands for the\r\nfirst time in April 11, 1915. There had been no previous discussion,\r\npassionate or otherwise, as in the case of the Trentino and Triest. But\r\nnow they demanded various Dalmatian islands, the chief of which were\r\nHvar, Kor[vc]ula and Vis, with a total population (in 1910) of 57,954.\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Ambassador reported (cf. Red Book, concerning April\r\n14, p. 133) that a conversation between Baron Sonnino and Prince Buelow\r\nwith respect to these islands had been extremely animated, and that\r\nSonnino had pointed out that the Navy and the whole country expected of\r\nhim that he would alter Italy's unfavourable position on the Adriatic,\r\nwhere from Venice to Taranto she had not one serviceable harbour, that\r\nis to say serviceable war-harbour. And Sonnino added that he thought\r\nthis was an opportune moment in which to rectify that state of things.\r\nOn April 28 the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, besides drawing the\r\nItalians' attention to the nationality of the islanders--1.62 per cent.\r\ncalling themselves Italian--pointed out that not only would there no\r\nlonger be any question of a strategic equilibrium in the Adriatic if\r\nAustria were to lose these islands, but that the adjacent coast would\r\nalways be threatened. On May 4, the Ambassador asked whether an\r\narrangement with Italy would be impossible if the Austrians agreed to\r\nevery one of Italy's other conditions, showing thereby what the value of\r\nthese islands was in Austrian eyes. When Sonnino did not reply to this\r\nquestion, the Ambassador understood that Italy's participation in the\r\nWar had been determined. But on May 10, the Austrian Government made up\r\nits mind to give up Pelagosa \"on account of its proximity to the Italian\r\ncoast.\" As a matter of fact it lies 42 miles from Vis and 33 miles from\r\nthe nearest point in Apulia. As a strategic base this group of rocks\r\nwould have no value, since the water is too deep for the construction of\r\na harbour, and the sirocco rages with such ferocity that it flings the\r\nfoam over the top of the lighthouse, which is 360 feet in height. This\r\ninhospitable place, with its population of 13 human beings, some sheep\r\nand goats, was inhabited in prehistoric days; when the excavations were\r\nbeing made for the lighthouse a variety of implements from the Stone Age\r\nwere discovered, including a stone arrow that was found between the ribs\r\nof a skeleton.... But the Austrian Ambassador let it be known at the\r\nsame time that he would be prepared to make a further friendly\r\nexamination of the Italian demands with reference to the other islands.\r\nHis Government also on May 15 (Red Book, No. 185, p. 181) announced that\r\nthey were quite disposed to reopen the discussion. However, on the 23rd\r\nof the month, Italy came into the War. The Italians had been explaining\r\nthat if only Austria would give up these islands--which was as if you\r\nwere to invite a person whose designs you suspected to come and camp in\r\nthe hall of your house--then, said the Italians, there would be an\r\nexcellent prospect of permanently amicable relations between the two\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR WELCOME TO JEL[vS]A\r\n\r\nAs soon as the War was over, Italy disembarked on the islands which she\r\nhad obtained by the Treaty of London. Something has been said on\r\nprevious pages of the way in which she introduced herself and made\r\nherself at home. As we were sailing towards the pretty town of Jel[vs]a\r\n(Gelsa) on the island of Hvar, we left Vrbo[vs]ka on our right. The\r\nBishop of Split had told me of a grievance which the Italian troops at\r\nthat place had lodged with his brother, the mayor. Some of them had\r\nvisited, for the fetes of carnival, both the Yugoslav Club, where they\r\nfound many persons who could speak Italian, and the Italian Club, where\r\nthey were annoyed to find that it was spoken by very few. As we came\r\ninto the little port of Jel[vs]a, with the green shutters of its white\r\nhouses harmonizing with the foliage of the cypresses and oleanders, we\r\ncould see a crowd of people running round--and carabinieri running with\r\nthem--to that part of the harbour where we were unexpectedly going to\r\nstop. There was some confusion, the carabinieri pushing the people back,\r\nevidently to prevent them shaking hands with us; and one small boy who\r\ndid not hear or did not understand what they were shouting received a\r\nterrific blow in the back from the fist of a furious Italian. Some cries\r\nwere raised in honour of Yugoslavia, Wilson, France and England, which\r\nmay have been imprudent; but when a place in which there is not one\r\nsingle Italian has been held down for months, has been forbidden to\r\nshow the slightest joy on account of the birth of Yugoslavia, has been\r\nsavagely punished for having a copy of a Yugoslav newspaper, has\r\nrepeatedly been cursed and cuffed and ordered, at the bayonet's point,\r\nto execute some wish of the carabinieri--one cannot be astonished if in\r\nthe presence of some non-Italian foreigners they could no longer repress\r\ntheir feelings. Some of the people had brought flowers with them, and as\r\nPommerol and I plunged into the whirlpool and made our way towards the\r\nItalian commander's office, we had many flowers either thrust into our\r\nhands while the carabinieri were looking the other way or else we had\r\nthem thrown at us, in which case some of them would usually descend upon\r\nthe shoulders or the three-cornered hats of the carabinieri. Whenever\r\nanybody uttered one of the forbidden exclamations one or more of the\r\ncarabinieri would fling themselves into the crowd and attempt, with the\r\nhelp of vigorous kicking, to reach the culprit. Thus, in the midst of a\r\nseries of scrimmages, we got to the captain's quarters. We found him a\r\nvery pleasant young man, keenly conscious of the difficulties of his\r\nposition; as we afterwards heard, he was such an improvement on his\r\npredecessor that the carabinieri were convinced he was a Yugoslav and\r\nhad been heard to mutter threats against his life. He had apologized to\r\nthe inhabitants, and had dismissed one of his men who had hauled down a\r\nYugoslav flag and blown his nose on it. For these men an extenuating\r\ncircumstance was that they had been very drunk on the night before our\r\narrival, as they had heard--it was in the first half of June 1919--that\r\nthe islands had been definitely given to Italy, and this they had been\r\ncelebrating. We knew that after an American and an Englishman had\r\nvisited Jel[vs]a, in the time of the other commandant, some of the\r\npeople were interned; the young captain assured us that he would do no\r\nsuch thing. And one could see that he would never imitate the brutality\r\nof his predecessor, who had caused a frail old man of sixty-six,\r\nProfessor Zari['c], to be pulled out of his bed in the middle of a\r\nwinter's night and taken across the hills on a donkey to Starigrad,\r\nafterwards on a destroyer to Split, from where--but for the intervention\r\nof the American Admiral--he would have been deported to Italy; and all\r\non account of his having written, in English and French, a scientific\r\nethnographical treatise on the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS AT STARIGRAD\r\n\r\nAt Starigrad on our arrival the harbour and its precincts looked like the\r\nscene of an opera, with an opening chorus of carabinieri. They were posted\r\nat various tactical points and no one else was visible. One of them\r\nadvanced, however, and conducted us at our request to the office of the\r\nCommandant, a major who must have played a very modest part in the War, as\r\nI believe he only had three rows of ribbons.[39] He gave us some vermouth\r\nand informed us that the population was very quiet, very happy. When I said\r\nthat I would like to see the mayor he sent an orderly, and in less than one\r\nminute his worship stood before us. He immediately confirmed what the major\r\nhad said with regard to the population. In fact the picture which he drew\r\nbrought back to memory the comment of the Queen of Roumania who, when an\r\nAmerican lady at a reception in Belgrade told her that she lived at a place\r\ncalled Knoxville or Coxville in the States, replied \"How nice!\" The good\r\nItalians, quoth the mayor, were distributing supplies among the natives,\r\nand with the exception of the Croat _intelligentsia_ they all wished for\r\nunion with Italy. I asked him if he did not think that, looking at it from\r\nthe economic point of view, there would be some difficulties when the\r\nisland's exports--wine and oil and fish--would have to compete with the\r\nproducts of Italy. But he said that one must think of the other\r\nbenefits--no longer would the island have to bear the hated Austrian. It\r\nwas all the fault of Austria, he continued, that after 1885 the Starigrad\r\nmunicipality had been Croat; since then the Italians had lost their school\r\nand their orchestra. But now it would all be changed. He was clearly a\r\nproduct of the new dispensation; and he told me that as the ex-mayor was an\r\nAustrian of course he had to be discharged. Nothing else did this gentleman\r\ntell me, which was a pity, as in a message, presumably sent by him, to an\r\nItalian newspaper, _La Dalmazia_,[40] of Zadar, it was stated that in this\r\nconversation I had displayed a supreme ignorance of local questions....\r\nThen we all stood up and the major said that he would accompany us down to\r\nthe boat. I told him that I would join him there after I had seen some\r\nYugoslavs, and Pommerol was good enough to walk away with him while I went\r\nround the ancient little town--it even has some Cyclopaean walls--with\r\ncertain Yugoslavs, two lawyers and a doctor. One of the lawyers turned out\r\nto be the ex-mayor, whose Austrianism had apparently taken a less active\r\nform than that of his successor, for he had only been an Austrian subject,\r\nwhile the actual mayor--Dr. Tama[vs]kovi['c]--had served, until the end of\r\nthe War, in the 22nd Austrian Regiment. With regard to the events of 1885,\r\nthey told me that this was the time when the Croatian national\r\nconsciousness awoke, so that an insufficient number of people had remained\r\neither to support an Italian school or yet an orchestra. And now the number\r\nof Italian adherents was about 200 (out of 3600), and might increase if\r\nice-creams were handed round in all the schools. One of my companions\r\nhappened to live in the house of Hektorovi['c], the sixteenth-century poet,\r\nand we spent a few minutes in the perfectly delightful garden with its\r\npalms and shady paths and bathing tank, like that one in the Alcazar at\r\nSeville. Then we went on to the harbour where a number of the people were\r\ncollected. Pommerol was in the middle of a group of military and naval\r\nofficers and civilians, these latter being partly visitors from Istria and\r\nZadar. Suddenly a woman, standing near me, threw her head back and cried:\r\n\"Viva Italia!\" when other people joined her she redoubled her efforts. I\r\nshould say that about thirty people were gathered round the major, shouting\r\nfor Italy, and he was obviously gratified. But then a much larger number of\r\npersons who had different sentiments began to shout for Wilson, Yugoslavia\r\nand so forth. The carabinieri rushed among them, howling vengeance. A Mrs.\r\nPoliteo, who was holding a bouquet, was flung down by them and trampled on.\r\nThe lawyers and the doctor with whom I had been walking were all three\r\nstruck over the head or on the shoulders with the butt end of muskets. (_La\r\nDalmazia_ wrote that I had been filling their heads with idle tales.)\r\nChildren were screaming. I saw another woman, hatless, being dragged off by\r\na couple of carabinieri--and a naval officer, who was disgusted, sternly\r\nordered them to let her go--and they obeyed reluctantly. Four Dominican\r\nmonks were next attacked--they had not taken part in the demonstration; it\r\nwas enough for the carabinieri that they belonged to the Yugoslav party.\r\nOne of them, Father Rabadan--an elderly gentleman with gold spectacles--was\r\nthrown down, struck until his face was covered with blood, and then dragged\r\noff to prison. The carabinieri were being helped by soldiers--one of these\r\nI saw in the act of loading his rifle--and the noise was tremendous. Here\r\none would see a Yugoslav trying to tell one of the warriors that he had\r\ndone nothing; then another ardito would go swooping on to his prey: one or\r\ntwo of the officers looked awkward--one or two actually looked exultant. As\r\nwe steamed out of the harbour four or five carabinieri and arditi were\r\nrunning along the road parallel with us, others were climbing over the\r\nstone walls--apparently it was a man-hunt. \"There are places in Dalmatia,\"\r\nSignor Luzzatti, an Italian ex-Premier, had been saying in the _Temps_,[41]\r\n\"where Yugoslavs and Italians are mingled; but it is clear that in those\r\ncircumstances the oldest and serenest civilization should prevail. Italy in\r\nher relations with other races has continued the traditions of ancient\r\nRome.... It is their palpitating desire [_i.e._ that of Fiume, Sebenico,\r\nZara, Trau, Spalato, etc.] to live under the direct protection of Italy.\"\r\nAnd on the next day a telegram was sent to Split from the unoccupied island\r\nof Bra['c], giving the names of twenty-one persons who were arrested, and\r\nthe name [Semeri] of an officer who had helped to beat Father Rabadan and\r\ncontinued: \"The carabinieri are still looking for Yugoslavs. On the\r\noccasion of the arrestment of the clerk Nikola Pavi[vc]i['c], the musket of\r\nan ardito went off and an eye was blown out to Mr. Pavi[vc]i['c]. Great\r\nterror prevails among the Yugoslav population.\" A later message, to the\r\nnewspaper _Jadran_ at Split, said that twenty-eight persons had been\r\narrested and imprisoned in two narrow cells, which were overlooked from the\r\nneighbouring houses. There they were being maltreated, and for the first\r\nday being given nothing to eat. Everyone felt surprise that among the\r\narrested was a certain Mr. Vladimir Vrankovi['c], as he was one of those\r\nwho had betrayed their nationality. But after ten minutes this clumsiness\r\non the part of a carabiniere was rectified and, by command of Major\r\nPenatta, he was released. All those who could get away from Starigrad were\r\ntaking refuge in the villages. The message ended by asking for the\r\nintervention of the Entente, as the people's life was being made\r\nintolerable, and for the reason that they would not trample under foot\r\neverything which they regard as holy. But, according to _La Dalmazia_, the\r\nindignant Italian population sent to the Paris Conference a vibrating\r\ntelegram, which begged for immediate annexation to Italy, and protested\r\nagainst those who in an unworthy and ugly manner had disturbed the place's\r\nbeautiful tranquillity.... The prisoners were court-martialled at Zadar and\r\ncondemned to terms that varied from four to eight months--seven of the\r\naccused, including Father Rabadan and two other Dominicans, receiving the\r\nseverest sentence.... I hope the indignant Italian population dispatched,\r\nlater on, a telegram of thanks to the Paris Conference for having ordered\r\nYugoslavia to guarantee the position of the handful of Italians to be left\r\nin Yugoslav territory, and even their special commercial interests in\r\nDalmatia; while the half million Slovenes and Croats whom Italy proposed to\r\nannex were not to be protected by an equivalent guarantee. It would be\r\nridiculous to bind with such conditions a Great, Liberal Power.\r\n\r\nAfter this it was no great surprise to hear, on reaching Hvar, the\r\ncapital of the island, that our further progress was impeded. The pale\r\nCommandant of sinister aspect, this time a naval officer, Lieut.\r\nVincenzo Villa, showed us a telegram from the Vice-Admiral at\r\nKor[vc]ula, which said that we were not to be allowed to speak to any of\r\nthe inhabitants. \"To explore the islands there is some little\r\ndifficulty,\" said Burton in a lecture on the ruined cities, which he\r\nvisited when he was Consul at Triest. Early in the morning our cook, who\r\nwent ashore to see what he could buy, was immediately arrested by the\r\ncarabinieri, who were keeping order very much like those \"bravissimi\r\ncitadini\" who in the autumn of 1870, when many of the citizens of Rome\r\nwere at loggerheads with the Vatican, arrested and disarmed all those\r\nadherents of the Papacy who showed their noses outside the Vatican's\r\nportals. Our cook was afterwards released by the Commandant, who allowed\r\nhim to visit the market, escorted by carabinieri. After that we returned\r\nto Split, and from there to Zadar, in order to see Admiral Millo.\r\n\r\nOne would like to know what the Admiral would have said if this\r\ninterview had taken place a few months later when, in alliance with\r\nGabriele d'Annunzio, he was in open, armed revolt against the Government\r\nof Italy. The dark-bearded, stately Admiral, Senator of the Kingdom, had\r\nnot begun as yet to make that series of buccaneering speeches, and he\r\ncourteously told us, more than once, that he could permit of nothing\r\nwhich would outrage public order. He was much afraid that if we went\r\nback to the islands we would be the cause of lamentable scenes; in fact\r\nhe could not let us go without an order from his Government. \"These\r\nislands,\" he said, \"are not yet ours; we are occupying them, as you\r\nknow, in the name of the Entente and the United States. You have the\r\nright,\" he said, \"to go there; but, unfortunately, if you do, the\r\npopulation will give way, as they have done already, to excesses.\" Since\r\nthe last thing that we wished was for the islanders to bring us flowers\r\nand cheer the name of Wilson--in view of what these crimes entailed--we\r\nsuggested that a small number, four or five of each party--those who\r\ndesired to be with Yugoslavia and those who preferred Italy--should in\r\nsuccession come to us on board. Naturally we should be unable to do so\r\nif we had to visit any inland place; and after a prolonged argument the\r\nAdmiral agreed to this plan. We returned to Hvar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFFAIRS OF HVAR\r\n\r\nThe subordinate Admiral, from Kor[vc]ula, had come across on a destroyer\r\nand was kind enough to tell us at considerable length what were his\r\nviews on local and international affairs. He frankly appealed to us--and\r\nhis humorous blue eyes were radiating frankness--to survey the whole\r\nmatter in a broad, statesmanlike fashion. But we were less ambitious; we\r\ndesired merely to be the mouthpiece of both parties. Those who first\r\ncame on board were the Italianists, and I hope I shall not be considered\r\nunfair if I employ this word rather than \"Italians\" for a body of men,\r\nmost of whom are admittedly devoid of any Italian blood and whose\r\nItalian sympathies are of very recent growth. This class numbers 9 per\r\ncent. of the population of the town. Their chief point seemed to be that\r\nthe Church was opposed to them, because there was no room for\r\nclericalism in Italy (!); and the only other point worth mentioning was\r\nthat Austria was to blame for the phylloxera which had played havoc with\r\ntheir vines. Among the Yugoslavs who succeeded these gentlemen there was\r\nan elderly priest, a canon, who related that some carabinieri--no doubt\r\nin order to display to all men that Italy had shaken herself free from\r\nclerical obscurantism--entered the church while the bishop was\r\nofficiating, and hoisted on the roof an Italian flag. This canon, Dom\r\nIvo Bojani['c], could scarcely be blamed if the Italian innovations did\r\nnot appeal to him. He chanced to be looking out of his window on a\r\nmoonlit night and noticed that an agile policeman was climbing up to his\r\nbalcony for the purpose of decorating it with an Italian flag. The old\r\ngentleman protested, and was thereupon taken to the barracks, where he\r\nremained for one day. The Yugoslavs told us that the state of things was\r\nworse than in Africa--but that was a figure of speech; the facts were\r\nthat the different societies and clubs had been closed, that all persons\r\ngoing down to the harbour had been forbidden to speak their own language\r\nto their friends on board ship, that three Croat teachers had fled to\r\nescape being interned, while an Italian soldier who did not know a word\r\nof Croatian had been appointed in their place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR MEN OF KOMI[vZ]A\r\n\r\nWhen we departed from Hvar the Admiral sent his destroyer to accompany\r\nus on our tour. She had on board a Roman journalist, Signor Roberto\r\nBuonfiglio, who was travelling in Dalmatia and the islands on behalf of\r\nthe clerical _Corriere d'Italia_. The situation at Vis, the historic\r\npalm-shaded capital of the island of the same name, has already been\r\ndescribed. The Italian Commandant, Sportiello, was a tactful and popular\r\nperson; moreover the Yugoslavs were on the best of terms with Dr. Doimi,\r\nthe head of one of the very rare Italian families. At Komi[vz]a, the\r\nother little town on that island, the relations between Yugoslavs and\r\nItalianists were not so cordial. But the deputation which represented\r\nthe latter party comprised one man whom the Austrians had put in gaol\r\nfor several years for forgery; a father and son, of whom the one had\r\nsold himself for the sake of rice, while the other had also been\r\nimprisoned by the Austrians for uttering false documents; the fourth and\r\nmost innocent member--his name happened to be Innocent Buliani--had\r\nnothing to conceal except his fickleness, for in a short period he had\r\ncalled himself an Austrian, a Yugoslav and an Italian. None of these\r\nfour was a native of the place, whereas the Yugoslavs who came to see us\r\nwere natives who had risen to be the chief doctor, lawyer, priest and\r\nmerchant. One of the Italianists, Antonio Spadoni, told us that the\r\npeople were afraid of expressing their real wishes for union with Italy.\r\nThis hypothesis might seem to demand some elucidation, but Signor\r\nSpadoni insisted on passing on to the \"Workers' Society,\" which the\r\nyoung Commandant had founded for the purpose, according to Spadoni, of\r\nhelping the people to find work and of looking after their interests. We\r\nwere subsequently told by the Yugoslavs that the Commandant himself\r\ncalled the members his \"Rice Italians,\" for many of them did not speak\r\nthe language and did not even sympathize with Italy. But on joining they\r\nhad committed themselves to something that was printed at the top of the\r\npaper, which part had been turned over. It really doesn't sound very\r\nworthy of a Great Power. When some of the members, discovering to what\r\nthey were committed, sent in their resignation, it was refused. At\r\nKomi[vz]a all the municipal officers had been discharged by the\r\nItalians, the reading-rooms and places of amusement had been closed, and\r\nthe Food Administrator at Split was forbidden to send any food, lest he\r\nshould interfere with the Italians' object in distributing rice, etc.\r\nOnce he was permitted to forward some American flour, and the people had\r\nto pay forty crowns of duty on each hundredweight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN OF BI[vS]EVO\r\n\r\nFrom Komi[vz]a, the next morning, we steamed over on the destroyer to\r\nthe wonderful blue grotto of Bi[vs]evo (or Busi), which surpasses Capri.\r\nAn Austrian Archduke, we were told, had once waited a week at Komi[vz]a,\r\nbut had been compelled to leave without seeing the cave. We were more\r\nfortunate--the wind, the water and the sun were kind to us; we entered\r\nin a rowing-boat the little pearl-grey Gothic chapel which Nature has\r\nconstructed underneath a hill, and as we gazed into the blue-green\r\nwaters, through which from the rocks below a fountain of most brilliant\r\nblue was rising, every time an oar was dipped the waters painted it a\r\nsilvery white. The population of Bi[vs]evo consists of about 150 people,\r\nwho mostly live around the little church of Saint Sylvester, two hundred\r\nfeet above the sea. They occupy themselves with sheep and fruit and bees\r\nand fish, and with the vines that are even more famous than those of\r\nVis. A good part of the population had assembled on a grassy platform\r\nhigh above the entrance to the cave, and as we climbed out of the\r\nrowing-boat on to the destroyer a much larger rowing-boat came round a\r\npromontory. Sixteen women formed the crew. They sang their national\r\nCroatian songs, and when they approached us some of them stood up and,\r\nwhile the wind played with their straw-coloured and golden hair, they\r\nlaughingly threw flowers at us. As we left Bi[vs]evo the men and women\r\nhigh above us and the women in the boat were waving their hands; some of\r\nthem were singing, others were shouting a farewell. Here and there on\r\nthe sunlit waters, rising and falling, were the flowers which had woven\r\non the sea a gorgeous carpet. \"Well,\" said the lieutenant-commander, \"I\r\nadmit that this is a Yugoslav island.\"\r\n\r\nI forget whether Signor Buonfiglio made any remark, but a few hours\r\nlater at Velaluka he was most incensed. As our boat--we had returned to\r\nthe old _Porer_ at Komi[vz]a--sailed into the harbour a huge Yugoslav\r\nflag was flying from the summit of a hill, with French, British and\r\nAmerican flags around it. The destroyer had arrived before us and the\r\nburly journalist was striding up and down the quay. \"I protest,\" he\r\nexclaimed, as he saw us, \"and not as a journalist but as an Italian\r\ncitizen! I protest!\" Between us and the front row of houses, which\r\nincluded the town-major's office, there was a large empty space--the\r\ninhabitants could be descried up the side-streets and behind the\r\nwindows. De Michaelis, the town-major, was evidently a superior young\r\nman; as he poured out the champagne he told us with perfect frankness\r\nthat the educated people at Velaluka were Yugoslavs. Suddenly there was\r\na terrific noise just underneath us. We hurried downstairs and found\r\nthat the soldiers in their excitement had fired off a machine gun into\r\nthe wall. Half an hour later the firing could be heard from the top of\r\nthe hill, but we never ascertained whether anyone was wounded. In this\r\nplace the Italianist party sent to us an ex-publican who had now joined\r\nthe police, a small trader and a municipal clerk who had recently been\r\nimported from Zadar. The Yugoslavs were a large landowner, a doctor and\r\na priest, who told us that the people for the most part were refusing to\r\naccept gratuitous food from the Italians.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WAY TO BLATO\r\n\r\nWe were anxious to visit Blato, an inland village of 8000 inhabitants.\r\nDe Michaelis regretted very much that he had no carriage, but a Yugoslav\r\nhad a quaint little car on which he was learning how to drive and he was\r\nkind enough to take us--for which he was afterwards deported to Italy.\r\nThe good man made so much noise in changing his gears that our progress\r\nwas advertised in the uttermost fields, and very few of those who bore\r\ndown upon us came unprovided with flowers. Several of the bouquets hit\r\nPommerol or myself in the eye, and the Dutch say that the best cause has\r\nneed of a good pleader. But the people were so gay, waving their hats\r\nand running after us (they did not always have to run) and shouting for\r\nthe various Allies and for President Wilson. I remember two small\r\nround-eyed boys who were not old enough to run; they were standing hand\r\nin hand by the side of the road, panting the magic word \"Wilson! Wilson!\r\nWilson!\" There was a sudden contrast when we jerked into the village.\r\nPeople were not rushing towards us, but away from us--with furious\r\ncarabinieri behind them. We got into the garden in front of the\r\n_gendarmerie_; one of the men was so enraged that he kept on muttering\r\n\"Bestia! Bestia! Bestia!\" In the Commandant's office we met Major\r\nFederico Verdinois, the town-major, who said that if he had only known\r\nof our coming this wretched scuffle would not have happened. Even as he\r\nspoke it started again; we leaned out of the window and saw two or three\r\npersons who were being prevented by soldiers from going down the street\r\nor from going anywhere. An officer was slashing with a riding-whip at a\r\nsoldier who was particularly rough. \"One can do nothing with the\r\nmarines; they are brutal,\" said Major Verdinois. At last there was\r\npeace, and the major said that an Italian deputation would come to see\r\nus. It consisted of six individuals. The Austro-Hungarian census of 1910\r\nsaid that the Blato district contained 13,147 Serbo-Croats, 3 Germans\r\nand 6 Italians; but these six were not all in the deputation, for two of\r\nits members had come from Hvar, one from Zadar, two were ex-Austrian\r\nspies and one was a Yugoslav, who hoped in this way to help his people.\r\nOne gentleman deplored that he had not been told about our journey; had\r\nhe known he would have told his peasants to appear. Another gentleman\r\nassured us that the peasants were afraid of declaring their real wishes.\r\nOf course a country whose friends call it the most liberal in the world\r\ncould not allow such a state of things to continue, and a short time\r\nafter this the following Order was issued by the staff of the 66th\r\nDivision of Infantry:\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 46. Confidential--Personal. VERY URGENT.\r\n\r\n_June_ 23, 1919.\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMANDERS AT BENKOVAC, OBROVAC,\r\nNOVIGRAD, ERVENIK, KISTANJE, SKRADIN,\r\nBIOGRAD, NIN, GJEVERSKE, SUKO[VS]AN AND\r\nKARIN.\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMAND OF THE ROYAL DIVISIONS.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to bring about, with no delay and very discreetly, the\r\ndispatch of messages to the Prime Minister Nitti and to the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs Tittoni from the mayor, from societies, etc., of this\r\ngarrison, expressing the people's keen desire to be annexed to Italy.\r\n\r\nA copy of said telegram should be transmitted to me.\r\n\r\nTHE MAJOR:     THE MAJOR-GENERAL:\r\n   FORESI.             SQUILLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the events at Blato--while we were waiting for the\r\nYugoslavs a woman made her way as far as the corridor, flung herself\r\ndown on her knees and entreated us to protect her. Major Verdinois gave\r\nus his word of honour that no Yugoslav with whom we spoke would, for\r\nthat reason, be arrested. Perhaps he was overruled by his superior\r\nofficers--at all events he arrested and deported to Italy, in the night\r\nof June 19, no less than ten persons, that is, all the Yugoslavs who\r\nspoke to us at Blato, with two exceptions. [We cabled this to the Paris\r\nConference, and after some delay the unfortunate men were repatriated.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE MAJOR SAID\r\n\r\nFor what happened before our arrival I am indebted to the chemist\r\nRadimiri, from whose report the following is an extract: \"At ten in the\r\nmorning Major Verdinois had summoned to his office the communal doctor,\r\nMoretti, and the secretary, Draguni['c], both of them Yugoslavs. He told\r\nthem that two Englishmen who were cruising about in the _Porer_ would\r\nvery likely be coming up that afternoon to Blato and he would permit no\r\nsort of demonstration. The doctor, he said, would be held responsible\r\nfor any disorder; and as Moretti was about to make this known to the\r\npeople, who were just coming out of church, the Italian adjutant\r\napproached him with a paper and ordered him to read it to the Yugoslavs.\r\nThis document--it has been preserved--is in the Serbo-Croat language and\r\nwas given to the doctor because the adjutant, who did not know the\r\nlanguage, mistook it for another one. It was an exhortation to the\r\npeople, urging them to have nothing more to do with the Yugoslav\r\n_intelligentsia_, which had made a great deal of money during the War.\r\n'And you have given your blood for four and a half years and what has\r\nbeen your benefit?' Dr. Moretti made a personal appeal for the\r\nmaintenance of order, and the people, having called out 'Long live\r\nWilson!' went their divers ways in peace. Nevertheless three platoons\r\nappeared, each with one officer and one N.C.O. The adjutant's platoon\r\ndistinguished itself, for while the arditi attacked anyone they saw,\r\nincluding women and children, with the butt end of their muskets, Lieut.\r\nGiovanoni laid about him with a dog-whip. Several of the soldiers made\r\nfor a group of four young fellows; three of them escaped and the fourth,\r\nPeter Kraljevi['c], was struck with a rifle so severely across the face\r\nthat he was bathed in blood. As he tried to defend himself he was shot\r\nat from a distance of three paces: one bullet went through his nose,\r\nanother wounded him in the forehead. He fell to the ground, and a\r\nteacher, Mrs. Maria Grubisi['c], who had witnessed the whole incident,\r\nsank down unconscious at his side and was covered with his blood.\r\nVarious other people were injured--three little girls received rifle\r\nshots in their bodies. All the main streets were shut off and eight\r\nmachine guns were placed in readiness. But the people were not to be\r\nintimidated, and when the Englishmen arrived their national\r\nconsciousness was displayed. As a result Peter [vC]arap was knocked\r\nunconscious with a mighty blow of a musket, the fourteen-year-old Joseph\r\nSule[vz]i['c] had a similar experience, and among many others who were\r\nassaulted we will only mention an ex-official, Anthony Pi[vz]tuli['c], a\r\nman of sixty, who was struck twice with a rifle on his stomach and then\r\nprevented from going home but chased out into the fields.... It seemed\r\nas if it would be impossible for our people to have a conversation with\r\nthe Englishmen, but at last twenty men and twelve girls managed to reach\r\nthat house....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROTEST OF AN ITALIAN JOURNALIST\r\n\r\nI would also give Signor Buonfiglio's dispatch from this island--it\r\nappeared in the _Corriere d'Italia_ of June 16--but more than\r\nthree-quarters of it is devoted to an account of some Dalmatian\r\ndelegates who were received, during the War, by Francis Joseph and\r\nexpressed their loyalty. The deputation was introduced by Dr.\r\nIv[vc]evi['c], a Croat; and if Signor Buonfiglio wants us to deduce from\r\nthis how ardently the Croats loved the Habsburgs he will have to give\r\nsome other explanation for the very loyal speeches of his countryman,\r\nDr. Ziliotto of Zadar. But I presume that his editor did not send Signor\r\nBuonfiglio on this journey to the end that he should write of what\r\nofficial speakers saw fit to say during the War. As for the incidents we\r\nwitnessed and the islanders' aspirations, he merely says that their\r\nwelcome to us was an artificial affair which the Yugoslav committees,\r\nwith extreme effort, had organized--and I don't think that that is a\r\nvery illuminating observation.\r\n\r\nWe learned that on arriving in Blato the Italians dissolved the town\r\ncouncil, on account of its incapacity to do the work. However, a\r\nmilitary man to whom it was handed over gave his opinion that he had\r\nnever seen a better administration.... Out of all that we were told, I\r\nwill relate the following: some Italian soldiers were playing football,\r\nand when they kicked the ball into a maize-field and continued to play\r\namid the maize, the farmers asked them to desist. Two officers and forty\r\nmen were present; they fell upon the three farmers, and when finally the\r\nmajor commanded them to stop, they dragged them to the barracks and\r\nthrashed them so that the people in adjacent houses heard them all the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the minute harbour of Pregorica, where the _Porer_ was\r\nwaiting for us, we had a repetition of the scenes enacted between\r\nVelaluka and Blato; and a number of young men, heedless of the risks\r\nthey ran, rushed down the mountain-side to Pregorica by the shortcuts.\r\nIn the harbour were some carabinieri, as well as our escorting\r\ndestroyer. We therefore had to leave without delay, lest the young\r\npatriots should come into contact with the carabinieri. So very hastily\r\nand in a very illegible scrawl I copied the original letter given on\r\nNovember 4, 1918, by Lieut. Poggi to the people of Velaluka: \"We\r\nItalians,\" it said, \"have come to Velaluka as the friends of Yugoslavia\r\nand of the Entente. We have come as friends and not as foes, and as such\r\nI ask you to accept us. We are hoisting our flag together with that of\r\nYugoslavia, and with your friendly consent we will keep it there until\r\nthe question of the general peace is definitely arranged, according to\r\nyour and our ... according to the principles of ...\" The two missing\r\nwords are illegible.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERESTING DELEGATES\r\n\r\nLying off Kor[vc]ula, that evening, we received the usual delegates. One\r\nof the Italians, Dr. Benussi, said in a trembling, tearful voice that\r\nthe Italians were far too good. And while we were hearing from one of\r\nhis colleagues what were his views on the subject of a plebiscite, Dr.\r\nBenussi moaned unceasingly, \"I wish I had not come! I wish I had not\r\ncome!\" He considered that it was outrageous of us to allude to\r\nplebiscites. The Yugoslavs did not tell us anything very thrilling; the\r\nItalian authorities persisted in writing to the peasants in Italian, of\r\nwhich they scarcely understand a word. What a pity that this is not\r\ntheir most serious fault! A barrister called Dr. Pero Cvili[vc]evi['c]\r\ncame, with a companion, to see us the next day, before breakfast. He\r\nsaid that they, like most people on the island, were Croats; and he and\r\nhis friend belonged to the Serbo-Croat party, which was, he said, a\r\nrighteous, though rather a small party, as the island had been gravely\r\nhandicapped by the support which Austria gave the Serbs. \"And now,\" he\r\nadded--it seemed a trifle illogical--\"the people are all very contented.\r\nBelieve me,\" he said. Furthermore, he volunteered the information that\r\nthe law was being administered in the name of the Entente and the United\r\nStates. It may show a distinct bias on our part, but I fear we asked\r\nhim whether the blows from the butt end of muskets were being applied\r\nunder the same sanction.... When we paid our formal visit to the\r\nCommandant at his office on the quay he did not ask if we would care to\r\ngo to one of the Italian schools. An American journalist had made a\r\nspeech in Rome, describing how he had been taken to a school at\r\nKor[vc]ula, how the mistress had allowed him to ask the children if they\r\nknew Italian, how they had raised their hands, and how this had\r\nconvinced him that Dalmatia should become Italian. Apparently that\r\njournalist had not been told that prior to the War this town of some\r\n2000 inhabitants was provided with five schools in which not a single\r\nchild spoke Italian, and with one school subsidized by the Liga\r\nNazionale which--as in Albania--lured its pupils by gifts of clothing,\r\nbooks, etc. The teachers, from the Trentino, knew not a word of\r\nSerbo-Croat and the children not a word of Italian. But not very much\r\nharm was done, as the population considered it shameful to attend this\r\nschool, and the bribes never succeeded in attracting more than thirty\r\npupils, even when money was paid to the parents. This institution was\r\nreopened by the Italian army after the War, and presumably it is the one\r\nwhich the American visited. I do not know whether the schoolmistress,\r\nforewarned of his visit, had told the children in Serbo-Croat that a\r\ngentleman would come and say something in Italian, whereupon they would\r\nhold up their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIGRESSION ON SIR ARTHUR EVANS\r\n\r\nSeeing that the Adriatic problem, after all these months, had not been\r\nsolved but on the contrary had been allowed to spread its poison more\r\nand more, one naturally wonders what was being done in Paris. The\r\nConference was fortunate enough to have at its disposal, after the\r\nArmistice, the famous ethnologist and archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans.\r\nThis gentleman, whose distinctions are too numerous to mention (Fellow\r\nof Brasenose; twice President of the British Association; Keeper during\r\ntwenty-four years of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford; D.Litt.; LL.D.;\r\nF.R.S.; P.S.A., and so forth), has for many years devoted himself to the\r\neastern Adriatic--the second edition of his _Through Bosnia and the\r\nHerzegovina on Foot_ appeared in 1877, his _Illyrian Letters_ in 1878,\r\nhis _Slavs and European Civilization_ in the same year. He never ceased\r\nfrom that time onward to study these matters. \"I think,\" he says in a\r\nletter to me from Youlbury, near Oxford, of which he kindly permits me\r\nto make any use I like, \"that in some ways I have more title to speak on\r\nthe Adriatic Question than any other Englishman, as Dalmatia was my\r\nheadquarters for some years. Neither did I approach the question with\r\nany anti-Italian prejudices. I was so far recognized as a competent and\r\nmoderate authority that I was asked by the Royal Geographical Society to\r\ngive them a paper on the subject.... Anxious, with others friendly to\r\nboth sides, to secure an equitable agreement between the Italians and\r\nYugoslavs, I took part in a series of private conferences in London\r\nwhich led to a preliminary Agreement forming the basis on which the\r\nCongress at Rome approached the question. There the Agreement was\r\nratified and publicly approved by Orlando. How Sonnino proceeded to try\r\nto wreck it, you will know. Finally (just before the Armistice, as it\r\nhappened) there was to have been a new Congress of Nationalities at\r\nParis, which I was asked to attend. It was stopped by the big Allies, as\r\nmatters were thought too critical, owing to the submission of Bulgaria.\r\nBut I thought it would be useful if I went to Paris all the same, and I\r\nobtained from the Foreign Office, War Office, etc., a passport vised\r\n'British War Mission.' Shortly after I arrived in Paris the Armistice\r\nwas declared. Soon afterwards, owing to the departure of Mr. Steed and\r\nDr. Seton-Watson, there was left literally no one among our countrymen\r\nat Paris who knew the intricacies of the Adriatic Question and the\r\nrelations of Italy with the Yugoslavs, and the Yugoslav-Roumanian\r\ndifficulties, etc. That being the case, Lord Derby asked me to be his\r\ngo-between, and I had an immense lot of work thrown on my shoulders. I\r\nhad gone to the expense of taking a large salon at the Hotel\r\nContinental, where I had private Conferences--the Yugoslav and Roumanian\r\nleaders there, for instance, discussed the Banat frontier question, and\r\nthe conciliatory proposals made no doubt furthered the final solution,\r\nwith which they harmonized. When there was a serious danger of a clash\r\nbetween the Italian army and the Serbian forces at Ljubljana, knowing\r\nthe imminence of the danger I made such strong representations to Lord\r\nD., which he forwarded to Balfour, that immediate pressure was exercised\r\nat Rome, and the Italians just drew back in time. I also was able to\r\nconvey strong monitions to the other side. I used to let our Ambassador\r\nhave a short precis almost daily of affairs connected with those\r\nregions.... With great trouble I prevailed on the Yugoslav\r\nrepresentatives to agree to a scheme, which I drew up, for the\r\nneutralization of the East Adriatic coastal waters, and this was taken\r\nup by the Americans--Colonel House inviting me to an interview on the\r\nsubject, in which he expressed his approval. A copy was also sent to the\r\nF.O., and for this and for several other bits of work useful to the F.O.\r\nI received Balfour's official thanks. I had also many friendly\r\nconversations with prominent Italians in Paris, and in every way\r\ningeminated agreement between them and the Southern Slavs. But,\r\nmeanwhile, I exposed the Nationalist Italian campaign, to which Sonnino\r\nwas privy, in the _Manchester Guardian_. Finally I went, at the end of\r\n1918, for a short holiday to England, Lord Derby (with whom I always had\r\nthe friendliest relations) giving me a diplomatic pass. When, however,\r\nearly in January 1919 I prepared to return to Paris, where I had kept on\r\nmy expensive rooms, I found difficulties in my way. Italian intrigue had\r\napparently been on foot. I was advised to write to Lord Hardinge, and I\r\ntold him briefly the circumstances. This great man never answered or\r\nacknowledged my letter, and it was only by making urgent personal\r\nrepresentations at the F.O. that I finally got the answer that they\r\nrefused me a passport.... I gather that it was not only Italian intrigue\r\nbut the feeling that they did not want 'damned experts.' And so they\r\nblundered on, and to this day\"--the letter is dated July 17,\r\n1920--\"nothing is settled on the Adriatic but unsettlement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUPES OF NIKITA IN MONTENEGRO\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at intervals during this year there had been troubles in\r\nMontenegro. On three occasions the Italians at Antivari had endeavoured\r\nto extend their sphere of influence, but the armed civilian population\r\nhad been equal to these emergencies and had each time thrust them back\r\nto the coast. At Gaeta, between Rome and Naples, a very well-paid corps\r\nwas stationed--almost every man was either a commissioned or a\r\nnon-commissioned officer. The Italian Government was asked by Signor\r\nLazari, the Socialist deputy, for what purpose it allocated 300,000 lire\r\na month to support these peculiar troops. They were mostly\r\nMontenegrins--relatives of Nikita, members of the five favoured\r\nfamilies, persons who were stranded and so forth; likewise at Gaeta were\r\na number of other Yugoslavs who had been liberated from their Italian\r\ninternment camps, but many of them, when they discovered what was\r\nexpected of them, revolted. Thirty or forty of them managed to escape to\r\nFrance, and others to Montenegro, as for example the man who for twelve\r\nyears had been Nikita's porter. He and three others reached Cetinje one\r\nday in August 1920 when I was there. They had with them a picture-card\r\nof the sixty-nine officers of the Gaeta army. Every one knows every one\r\nelse in Montenegro and only two of these officers had held a previous\r\ncommission. According to Nikita's Premier, Jovan Plamenac, the Italian\r\nGovernment considered this as the Montenegrin army and regarded (rather\r\noptimistically) as a loan the money it contributed to keep it up. In\r\ndriblets the non-revolting part of this Gaeta army was taken to the\r\neastern shores of the Adriatic, for the purpose of making \"incidents\" in\r\nMontenegro. There was a regular scale--so much in cash for the murder of\r\na prefect, so much for a deputy. One day the father of Andrija\r\nRadovi['c], a man of over seventy, was cut down; they waited until\r\neveryone had left the village to go to some fete in a neighbouring\r\nvillage, and the old man defended himself to the last.\r\n\r\nThese emissaries from Gaeta, misguided Montenegrins, other Southern\r\nSlavs and Italians, made considerable use of the mischievous speeches\r\nthat were sometimes heard in the British Parliament. They would explain\r\nto some poor, ignorant mountain-dweller that such great people in\r\nEngland were still discussing Nikita's return, and if he did return and\r\nthey had listened to the voice of Radovi['c], woe be to them. Some of\r\nthese wretched dupes would follow their seducers, who--I have no\r\ndoubt--would not only have declined his decorations if they had been\r\nbetter informed, but would have placed the matter in the hands of their\r\nsolicitor, as Gabriel Rossetti threatened to do if he were ever elected\r\nto the Royal Academy. And yet, after the character of the scoundrel King\r\nwas fully exposed, his advocates, so far as I know, had not the grace to\r\nown their error. Of course there was in Montenegro a certain amount of\r\nuninstigated unrest; the wine of politics, which they were now for the\r\nfirst time freely quaffing, had gone to their heads--it was youth\r\nagainst age, the students were enthusiastic Democrats, the peasants were\r\nsturdy Radicals and they did not always restrict themselves to\r\ndialectical arguments. A certain number of people had gone to live \"u\r\nshumi\"--\"in the woods.\" But the reasons that impelled them were not so\r\nmuch their devotion to the ex-King, as their own criminal past or their\r\npoverty. Others again had taken to this life for what may be called\r\nreasons of \"honour.\"[42] Among the brigands was a man who was captured\r\non the borders of Herzegovina, and before his execution--he had murdered\r\nseven people--he declared that he was a patriot and had done all this\r\nfor the sake of King Nicholas, his victims being members of the\r\ndomineering party. But when reminded that one of them was a baby, he\r\nhung his head and said no more.... There was discontent produced by the\r\nhigh cost of living--as the Italians not only held Antivari but even\r\nfired on French boats that were taking supplies up the river Bojana, it\r\nwas necessary to revictual all except the new parts of Montenegro from\r\nKotor. The lack of petrol, from which even the American Red Cross units\r\nwere suffering, compelled the authorities to fall back on ox-waggons,\r\nwhich at any rate are not expeditious. By the way, it was the staff of\r\nanother mission, calling itself the International Red Cross, which was\r\nto blame for adding to the country's troubles; after they had been\r\ninstalled for a month or two at Cetinje the people themselves, and not\r\nthe authorities, turned them out, on the ground that they had used the\r\nRed Cross to conceal their machinations in Nikita's interest. The\r\nYugoslav Government was held up to reprobation in the British Parliament\r\nand press for having hampered more than one British mission in the work\r\nof relieving the Montenegrins. The resources of these missions appeared\r\nto be moderate--the head of one of them had a meeting with Colonels\r\nFairclough and Anderson of the American Red Cross and suggested that\r\nthey should provide him with the wherewithal for carrying on. But even\r\nif their resources had been scantier their co-operation would have been\r\nvery welcome if they had satisfied the authorities that they were as\r\nnon-political as the Americans. It was curious that those who in the\r\nBritish press ventilated the grievances of these missions were the same\r\npeople who championed Nikita.\r\n\r\nThe Italians persevered in their manoeuvres--Nikola Kova[vc]evi['c],\r\nthe police commissary of Grahovo, sent in the month of May a\r\nconfidential man of his to the Italian General at Dobrota, near Kotor.\r\nThis man, who speaks perfect Italian, told the General that ever since\r\n1916 he had haunted the forests as the leader of a band. Fifty persons,\r\nhe said, had attached themselves to him; and he had now come in for a\r\nsupply of arms and money, also for instructions. It would be impossible,\r\nsaid he, to endure the Serbian troops much longer in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN ENDEAVOURS\r\n\r\n\"You must hold out for a couple of months longer,\" said the General. \"I\r\ncan give you no money at present, but I can take you on a steamer to San\r\nGiovanni, where we have a camp of the King's friends; and from there you\r\ncan easily go to Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given my word of honour,\" said the man, \"that I will not go\r\nwithout my people. So I must first of all go back to ask them.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a military way,\" said the General, \"the Serbs can now do nothing.\r\nThey had tremendous losses in the war; and in two months the King of\r\nMontenegro will return or else there will be an Italian occupation. Work\r\nhard, my friend. I want you, in the first place, to set houses on fire;\r\nthen to shoot officers and officials who are for Yugoslavia. You should\r\nalso rob the transports.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the man returned to Grahovo and soon afterwards the French\r\nGeneral Thaon, who happened to go there, spoke with him for two hours\r\nand invited him to his headquarters at Kotor.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances in Montenegro did not cease; a country through which\r\nyou could formerly drive with less risk than in Paris, was now infested\r\nby outlaws and those who pursued them. And Count de Salis, who had\r\nserved as H.B.M.'s Minister at Cetinje, was sent back to Montenegro on a\r\nmission of inquiry. His report was not published, for the reason that he\r\ndid not beat about the bush in his references to the Italians and for\r\nthe further reason that he gave the names of those persons from whom he\r\nculled his information. This was a fine opportunity for the foreign\r\nbusybodies who were thrusting their silly little knives into Yugoslavia.\r\n\"Count de Salis reports clearly and unmistakably,\" said Mr. Ronald\r\nM'Neill in the House of Commons, \"that in his judgment the wish of the\r\nMontenegrin people is to retain their own sovereign and their own\r\nindependence.\" When Sir Hamar Greenwood subsequently, speaking for the\r\nGovernment, threw out a hint that this was not the case, it was amusing\r\nto see how the pro-Nikita party lost their interest in the report. A\r\ncertain Mr. Herbert Vivian sent from Italy in April 1920 a most\r\nferocious indictment against the Serbs in Montenegro to a London paper\r\ncalled the _British Citizen_. He said that the Countess de Salis, while\r\nat Cetinje, was in danger of her life. But the lady has been dead for\r\nmany years. I presume this is the same Mr. Vivian who in a book,\r\n_Servia, the Poor Man's Paradise_, trembles with rage whenever a Serb\r\nspeaks admiringly of Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS BRITISH COMMENTATORS\r\n\r\nCount de Salis's impartial methods did not always please the population,\r\nwhich was by a large majority against the former king's return and--as\r\nhe clearly stated--heart and soul for Yugoslavia. Balkan people do not\r\nyet, to any great extent, appreciate your desire for truth or even your\r\nhonesty if you should give a hearing to their antagonists. The Cetinje\r\npublic, therefore, organized a demonstration or two against the Count.\r\nThey would have preferred that he should reach the afore-mentioned\r\nconclusions without such an exhaustive study of the case. He noted that\r\nthere had been certain irregularities in the Yugoslav administration,\r\nbut it was inevitable that in those unsettled times the inexperienced\r\nofficials would not prove equal to every emergency. These officials, by\r\nthe way, in 1919 were not Serbs from Serbia, but for the most part\r\nnative Montenegrins. \"The country is occupied and administered by\r\nforeigners,\" said[43] Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P. \"Montenegro,\" said he,\r\n\"is full of Serb officials.\" I suppose one must receive it more with\r\nsorrow than with anger if a man like Mr. Massingham of _The Nation_\r\nsays that the Serbs \"have deposed the Montenegrin judges, schoolmasters,\r\ndoctors, chemists and local officials, and set up their own puppets.\"\r\nWhile he might have assumed that the long years of War had left the\r\nSerbs with a very inadequate supply of officials for the old kingdom, he\r\nwould have ascertained, if his sources had been more trustworthy, that\r\nGloma[vz]i['c], the very human prefect of Cetinje, is a native of\r\nNik[vs]i['c], that Milo[vs] Ivanovi['c], the mayor, is from the Ku[vc]i,\r\nnear Podgorica--and he was a magistrate under Nikita; that Bojovi['c],\r\nthe prefect of Podgorica, is a barrister of the Piperi, while\r\nRadoni['c], the mayor, was an artillery officer, then a political\r\nprisoner and then the food administrator under Nikita; that\r\nJaoukovi['c], the prefect of Nik[vs]i['c], was a magistrate under the\r\nold regime--he comes, I believe, from the Mora[vc]a; Zerovi['c], the\r\nmayor and an ex-magistrate, is a native of Nik[vs]i['c]; that the\r\nprefect of Antivari, Dr. Goini['c], is a doctor of law whose home is\r\nbetween Antivari and Virpazar; that Bo[vs]ko Bo[vs]kovi['c], the prefect\r\nof Kola[vc]in, won great fame as an officer under Nikita, while\r\nMini['c], the mayor, was Nikita's chief of the Custom-house. As for the\r\ndoctors who left the country, these consisted of Matanovi['c] and\r\nVulanovi['c], who have gone to Novi Sad and Subotica respectively, as it\r\nis easier to make a living in those towns than in Montenegro. There are\r\nnow three Yugoslav doctors at Cetinje (Odgerovi['c], Radovi['c]--both of\r\nwhom were doctors in the time of Nikita--and Matanovi['c], a young man);\r\nthey are all Montenegrins. So, too, with the chemists and the\r\nschoolmasters and the post and telegraph officials--I am sure that Mr.\r\nMassingham will excuse me if I do not mention all their names.\r\n\r\nSince there are quite a number of Montenegrins in the Serbian\r\nadministration and army, all the officers and men, for example, of the\r\n2nd--the so-called \"iron\"--Regiment being of Montenegrin origin, one\r\nfails to see for what reason a Serb should be debarred from posts in\r\nMontenegro. It is unfortunate when people use the word \"Montenegrin\"\r\nwithout knowing that there is no separate Montenegrin nation, in the\r\nsense that there is a French or Italian nation. The Montenegrins are a\r\nsmall section of the Serbian nation, which sought a refuge among the\r\nbare, precipitous mountains and, unlike the other Serbs, maintained its\r\nindependence. One should, therefore, to avoid confusion, speak of Serbs\r\nof Serbia and Serbs of Montenegro rather than of Serbs and Montenegrins.\r\nThe purest Serbian is spoken in western Montenegro, on the borders of\r\nHerzegovina; those districts are ethnically different from the southern\r\nregion, centring round Cetinje, which is the real old Montenegro, and\r\nthe north and north-eastern parts, called the Brda, which in speech and\r\ncustoms are akin to the south. In western Montenegro, as in Herzegovina,\r\nthe people, who live among their mountains on milk and its products, are\r\nvery prolific, having families of eight or ten children. They are a very\r\nhealthy, moral race.\r\n\r\nAnother pro-Nikita, anti-Serbian writer, excusable only on account of\r\nhis insignificance, is Mr. Devine, who teaches, I am told, at a school\r\nnear Winchester and seems very unwilling to be taught. If he wishes, by\r\nproducing a book on the subject, to show other people that he knows\r\npainfully little about Montenegro, that is his own affair. But he is\r\njust as ignorant with regard to his hero. He says that he \"is in a\r\nposition to state that there is not one single word of truth in the\r\ninsinuations and charges impugning the absolute integrity and loyalty of\r\nKing Nicholas towards his Allies.\" The King was, according to Mr.\r\nDevine, a defenceless old man whom it was very bad form to attack. But\r\nthe King had been defending himself at considerable length not only in a\r\nharangue to his adherents in a Paris suburb, but also on various\r\noccasions in a newspaper, the _Journal Officiel_--and both the speech\r\nand long extracts from the newspaper are quoted, with approval, in Mr.\r\nDevine's book. This quaint person is so frantically keen to pour\r\nwhitewash over Nikita that he has no time to listen to the main\r\ntreacheries of Nikita's career. \"Malicious falsehoods!\" he\r\nsplutters--and they can be traced to horrible pan-Serbians. He has\r\nreason to believe that they wish to make Serbia the Prussia of the new\r\nFederation; well, the Croats and the Slovenes and the Bosniaks and all\r\nthe others cannot say that Mr. Devine has not warned them. My\r\nMontenegrin friend Mr. Buri['c] stated in the columns of the _Saturday\r\nReview_ that this odd gentleman had nourished the ambition of becoming\r\nMontenegrin Minister to the Court of St. James, but that the plan did\r\nnot succeed. I never saw Mr. Devine's denial--perhaps it fell into the\r\nclutches of a ruthless pan-Serbian printer. Naturally, Mr. Devine would\r\nnot care to be the diplomatic representative of a villain; therefore,\r\nwhen he is brought face to face with certain definite charges he\r\npersists in replying \"not in detail, but from the broad point of view.\"\r\nHe is so exceedingly broad that when an accusation is levelled against\r\nthe King he sees in this an accusation against the entire country--a\r\ncountry which unfortunately, as he says, \"alone of all the Allies has no\r\ndiplomatic representative in this country.\" Mr. Devine continues\r\nunabashed to repeat and repeat his pro-Nikita stuff in various\r\nnewspapers. \"Il y debvroit avoir,\" says Montaigne, \"quelque corection\r\ndes loix contre les escrivains ineptes et inutiles, comme il y a contre\r\nles vagabonds et faineants....\" Not long ago I happened to see that this\r\negregious person described himself as \"Hon. Minister Plenipotentiary for\r\nMontenegro,\" but another gentleman, Sir Roper Parkington, a pompous\r\nwine-merchant, announced in the Press that he had become \"Minister\r\n(Hon.) of Montenegro.\" Perhaps one of them has resigned, and our poor\r\noverworked Foreign Office will not be invited to decide between a\r\nMinister (Hon.) and an Hon. Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MURDER OF MILETI['C]\r\n\r\nThe Italians' stay at Kotor was drawing to an end. \"We have no\r\naggressive intentions,\" said Signor Scialoja, the Foreign Minister, \"and\r\nwe shall be glad if we are able to establish with our neighbours on the\r\nother side of the Adriatic those amicable relations\"--and so forth and\r\nso forth. This he said on December 21, but if the Government was imbued\r\nwith the same principles in August it is unfortunate that it omitted to\r\ninstruct the responsible officers in Dalmatia. The Yugoslav commander,\r\nLieut.-Colonel Risti['c], heard one night that the Italian General at\r\nDobrota was harbouring at his residence no less than twenty-one\r\nMontenegrin pro-Nikita komitadjis. They were clad in Italian uniforms,\r\nand, as a torpedo-boat and a motor-launch were always kept with steam\r\nup, could be shipped off at a moment's notice to Italy. Colonel\r\nRisti['c] sent his adjutant to make inquiries, and the Italians gave\r\ntheir word of honour that no Montenegrins were in the house. In order to\r\navoid a conflict Colonel Risti['c] then requested the French General to\r\nsend an officer; but this gentleman was not received by the Italians.\r\nFour or five Montenegrins, with an Italian lieutenant, came out of the\r\nhouse and fired at the twenty gendarmes who now encircled it. The fire\r\nwas returned--all the Montenegrins and the Italian were killed. After\r\nthis the French police disarmed the remaining Montenegrins and\r\nimprisoned them; and on the following day, much to his chagrin, the\r\nItalian General was told to take up other quarters at Mula, so that he\r\nwas separated by the French and the Yugoslavs from Montenegrin\r\nterritory.... Not long after this a certain Captain Mileti['c] was\r\ncycling late one afternoon on the road to Mula. Five or six Italian\r\nsoldiers lay concealed, and so expertly did they murder him that his\r\nfriends who were cycling a hundred paces ahead and other friends who\r\nwere fishing very near the spot in a boat heard nothing whatsoever. It\r\nwas eight days after this when the Italians had to go from Kotor and the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nD'ANNUNZIO COMES TO RIEKA\r\n\r\nThe question of Rieka had not yet been settled. The more suave Tittoni,\r\nwho had succeeded Sonnino, was hoping with the help of France to hold\r\nhis own against Wilson. Monsieur Tardieu thought that the town with a\r\nlarge strip of hinterland should become a separate independent State\r\nunder the League of Nations. An arrangement was also proposed by which\r\nthe city was to be administered by Italy, while the Yugoslavs should\r\nhave a guarantee of access to the sea. These negotiations were still in\r\na nebulous state, but certain proposals were going to be put into force\r\nwhich were suggested by the Inter-Allied Commission of Inquiry. With\r\nFrench, American, Italian and British representatives this commission\r\nhad visited Rieka. One of the recommendations was to the effect that\r\npublic order should be maintained by British and American police; on the\r\nvery day (September 12) that the British military police were to\r\ninaugurate their service, Gabriele d'Annunzio took matters into his own\r\nhands. He rose, he tells us, from a bed of fever and, refusing to\r\nrecognize the Nitti Government, he marched with the appropriate\r\ntheatrical ceremonies, into his \"pearl of the Adriatic.\" What he called\r\nthe 15th Italian victory, or, alternatively, the _Santa Entrata_--the\r\nHoly Entry--was accomplished without the shedding of a drop of blood.\r\nRieka, the stage of many fantastic scenes, witnessed one of the\r\nquaintest in the simultaneous arrival at the Governor's palace of a\r\nGeneral to whom the Allies had entrusted the command of the town and a\r\nrebel Lieut.-Colonel who refused to recognize his authority. They seemed\r\nto be on the best of terms. The General (Pittaluga) informed the Allies\r\nthat he was still in supreme command. Being invited on the following\r\nmorning to explain the situation at a conference on board the U.S.S.\r\n_Pittsburg_, at which were present the Allied naval and military\r\ncommanders, General Pittaluga informed them that he would be responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of order and that nothing was to be considered\r\naltered in the government of the town. Forty minutes later, without\r\nconsulting the Allies, he had handed over the town to a rebel and he\r\nhimself, in his private car, had vanished. In a subsequent message to\r\nthe Turkish Minister in Berne, sympathizing for the Allied occupation of\r\nConstantinople, d'Annunzio's Foreign Department informed him that \"the\r\nLegionaries of the Commandant d'Annunzio put to flight the English\r\npolice-bullies who were biding their time to snatch the tortured city.\"\r\nOpinions vary as to whether the poet-pirate was at that time acting in\r\ncollusion with Rome--his defiance and their thunders being included in\r\nthe stage directions--or whether he was a real rebel. We may assume that\r\nSignor Nitti did not countenance the buccaneer and that if officers and\r\ncivil servants diverted Government cargoes into his hands they were not\r\nacting as Government agents. As for large numbers of these officials,\r\ntheir secret understanding with d'Annunzio received many proofs. On\r\nSeptember 29 the _Era Nuova_ reported that, two days before, Major\r\nReina, d'Annunzio's Chief of Staff, was invited to Abbazia, where he had\r\nan interview with the Chief of Staff of the 26th Corps. Illuminating\r\nalso is the report, in the _Era Nuova_ of October 27, of a test case at\r\nGenoa, when a sergeant was tried for leaving his regiment and going to\r\nRieka. The prosecutor demanded four months' detention and degradation.\r\nThe court accepted the plea of the defence, which was that the court\r\ncould not condemn or dishonour a soldier who was only guilty of\r\npatriotic sentiment. Moreover, it transpired that those who returned\r\nfrom Rieka, after receiving there a salary from both parties, were\r\ngranted three weeks' leave and a reward of 100 lire. One observed that\r\nwhen the S.S. _Danubio_ left [vS]ibenik for Rieka with sixty\r\nwaggon-loads of coal, the captain received his sailing orders from the\r\nRoyal Italian port-officer. When d'Annunzio seized Rieka there was on\r\nthat same night a solemn demonstration at Zadar, led by Vice-Admiral\r\nMillo, who was supposed to be governing Dalmatia in the name of the\r\nEntente.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Consiglio Nazionale Italiano of Rieka, that self-elected body which\r\nhad so often told the world that Rieka was unshakeably determined to be\r\njoined to the Motherland, now took to its bosom the modern Rienzi,\r\nregardless of that which happened to the mediaeval one. The C.N.I. could\r\nnow devote itself to serious executive work, for d'Annunzio--in spite of\r\nor because of his fever--relieved them of the rather exhausting task of\r\nissuing proclamations. In three months he sent out something like a\r\nthousand. He did a great many other things--he ruined, for instance, the\r\neconomic life of the town. Everything had for a time gone swimmingly.\r\nThe Chief of the Republic of San Marino was voicing the sentiments of\r\nnumberless Italians when he saluted the poet as a great Italian patriot.\r\nSuch was the feeling of the majority of the army and navy, so that the\r\nGovernment in Rome was made to look ridiculous. \"Mark well what I am\r\ntelling you,\" said the poet to the special correspondent of the\r\n_Gazzetta del Popolo_. \"I have received a call from a superior hidden\r\nforce, and though the fever burns within me I am consoled, because the\r\nWar has made me a mystic and I feel I am inspired from on high in this\r\nmission.\" D'Annunzio and his cohorts refused to have anything to do with\r\nthe Cabinet. Signor Nitti, supported by the Parliament and the more\r\nresponsible people, was openly attacked by the Nationalists and secretly\r\nby the profiteers and the newly rich on account of his bold taxation\r\nprogramme, by which he hoped to bring 30 milliards of francs into the\r\nExchequer. The Nationalists assisted d'Annunzio to win over the army;\r\nand in northern Italy there were many who realized that an army which\r\ncan be moved by such an appeal can, on the next day, rally to\r\nBol[vs]evism. No other troops remained in Rieka, the small French and\r\nBritish detachments having been withdrawn. Before this happened there\r\noccurred a repetition, on a larger scale than usual, of a few French\r\nsoldiers being attacked by a body of Italian warriors who greatly\r\noutnumbered them. Some of the French were Annamites, than whom no more\r\nharmless persons can be imagined.[44] And it was in order to avoid such\r\nuntoward incidents that the Franco-British troops were evacuated.\r\nD'Annunzio was left to do his worst. Rieka was one of the problems which\r\nthe Peace Conference had failed to solve, and now they were in much the\r\nsame inglorious position as the Great Powers who in 1913 warned Turkey\r\nnot to mobilize, since they would not allow the Balkan Confederation to\r\nmake an attack, and after the attack gave it out that the Balkan States\r\nwould not be permitted to acquire any new territory. The Supreme Council\r\nin Paris was losing its prestige very rapidly. \"A little patience,\"\r\nbegged Tittoni, \"and my Government will turn out d'Annunzio.\" \"What we\r\nwant,\" exclaimed Clemenceau, \"is a Government in Italy!\"--and the\r\nItalian delegates, with flushed faces, pointed out that it was not Italy\r\nwhich wanted Rieka, but Rieka which wanted Italy. They would do their\r\nbest, although so many men in Italy were now convinced that Rieka would\r\nsooner die than give up d'Annunzio. Presently, under his\r\nadministration, it began to die. But this was not altogether distasteful\r\nto certain intriguers who were interested in the future of Triest. There\r\nmight also arise, to the satisfaction, of other intriguers, an armed\r\nconflict with the Yugoslavs. But nothing could be calmer than the\r\nYugoslavs' attitude. Perhaps these barbarians--as they are often styled\r\nin Italy--were confident that justice would prevail. Perhaps they\r\nthought that they could bide their time, and certainly what happened at\r\nTrogir was not calculated to reassure the Italians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT INVASION OF TROGIR\r\n\r\nThe little, ancient town of Trogir lay some twelve miles to the south of\r\nthe demarcation line. Its inhabitants, with the exception of five\r\nItalophil families, are Yugoslav; and in the month of September 1919 the\r\nYugoslav army was represented by eight men. Truth compels us to mention\r\nthat on a certain night these men, instead of doing patrol duty, were\r\nsleeping off the effects of a carouse; and when the townsfolk looked out\r\nof their windows in the morning they saw machine guns and Italian\r\nsoldiers. At 4 a.m. they had crept into the town with the help of a\r\ncertain Conte Nino di Fanfogna, who had assembled a National Guard of\r\nthirty peasants, the employees of those five families. Conte Nino was\r\nstriding to and fro; he muttered threats of death. Some of the chief\r\nmen, such as Dr. Marin Katalini['c], Dr. Peter Sentinella and others,\r\ncame together and were at a loss for some effective means to chase out\r\nthe Italians, since they had not even a revolver. An American boat\r\nappeared, but the captain, when appealed to, said that he was only\r\ncruising and could not come ashore. In the town hall Count Nino,\r\nlabouring under some excitement, dismissed the mayor; and when Ferri,\r\nthe mayor, told him to go about his business, he protested that he was\r\nthe dictator and would, if necessary, use force. Outside in the square\r\nthe Italians and the people stood face to face, and suddenly a few\r\nYugoslav flags were fluttering, and then an old man, Dr. Sentinella's\r\nfather, climbed up to the place in the town hall where the Italian flag\r\nhad been hoisted. He tore it down. The soldiers were for shooting him,\r\nbut the people began pulling the rifles out of their hands. Other\r\nsoldiers, full of apprehension, dropped their rifles; the people picked\r\nthem up, and those who were unacquainted with the mechanism cried out\r\ncertain awe-inspiring sounds. Women and children--I fear this will not\r\nbe believed; it is none the less true--women and children removed some\r\nof the men's helmets, and one group of children turned a helmet into a\r\nfootball. \"I am a father of a family!\" cried a soldier. \"I am innocent,\r\nI have been deceived!\" cried another. \"O, Mama mia!\" cried a third. They\r\nwept, they bolted into the courtyards, and the women showed them little\r\nmercy, for they tore off the men's belts and even struck them with their\r\nfists. A Mrs. Sunjara routed four men and went home with their machine\r\ngun on her back. In a few minutes the square was free of soldiers, and\r\nforty rifles were stacked in the town hall. Fifty soldiers on the quay\r\nwere dealt with by a butcher who started firing at them; when they heard\r\nthe shouts of the approaching crowd they threw down their weapons and\r\nfled. Two large motors escaped; the third was intercepted at the bridge,\r\nand although young Sentinella, who ordered them to stop, had forgotten\r\nhis own rifle, they all--thirteen men and two officers--threw theirs\r\naway. It was suggested that the running soldiers should be pursued.\r\n\"No,\" said an old man, \"for we would kill them all. Let them rather go\r\nback without arms or helmets. It will frighten the others.\" ... Two\r\nhours later a party of Serbian soldiers arrived, but they were not\r\nneeded, save for the protection of those who had thrown in their lot\r\nwith the Italians. From Split, a few miles away, 1500 volunteers, who\r\nspeedily assembled, came with knives or agricultural implements or any\r\nother weapon. \"The Yugoslavs must realize,\" said Nitti, \"that it is to\r\ntheir interest to maintain sincere relations of friendship with Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESSION STATES AND THEIR MINORITIES\r\n\r\nThe Yugoslav Government--as if it had not sufficient problems to\r\nsolve--was ordered now by the Peace Conference to accept sundry\r\nregulations as to the rights of minorities, the transit of goods, and an\r\nequitable regime for international commerce. The other States which had\r\ninherited the Habsburg Empire were, all of them, faced with the same\r\ndemands; and they objected that to sign such Articles was inconsistent\r\nwith their sovereignty. The most onerous item--relating to the racial\r\nand religious minorities--had been imposed--at America's instance, owing\r\nto the manner in which the Jews were treated in Roumania, despite King\r\nCharles' promises in 1878. The Yugoslavs, with a far smaller number of\r\nJews and no Jewish outcry, were concerned only for the principle of\r\nindependence. Not having persecuted the Jews they resented having to\r\nundertake that for the future they would act in a liberal spirit. \"I\r\nwill have nothing to do with tolerance,\" said the Orthodox Bishop of\r\nVer[vs]ac to a deputation of Jews, when he made his formal entry into\r\nthe town of Pan[vc]evo. And when they stared at him, \"It is not\r\ntolerance that I will show,\" said he, \"but love.\" Perhaps the Opposition\r\nin the Yugoslav Skup[vs]tina might have exhibited more kindliness in its\r\nattitude towards the Government and have refrained from rousing a storm\r\nagainst the signature of the obnoxious Articles. The Government and the\r\nOpposition being practically of equal strength, the Ministers, who in a\r\ncalm atmosphere could have explained the realities of the situation,\r\nfound themselves at a grave disadvantage. They could have shown that\r\nthey would be assuming obligations which they had assumed already. In\r\nMacedonia, as any traveller could see, the time-honoured custom of\r\npersecuting him who happened to be the under-dog was abandoned; the\r\nauthorities preferred to ignore the religious difference between\r\nthemselves and the Bulgarian party, and as the difference consisted in\r\npraying for the Exarch instead of the Patriarch in the liturgy there was\r\nnot the slightest persecution needed to persuade the Exarchists to\r\nbecome Patriarchists. Many who had been unaware of this new spirit which\r\ninformed Yugoslavia and had fled with the Bulgarian army, afterwards\r\ncame back to Macedonia. Nor did the Moslems complain: two Bosnian\r\nMoslems were expressly included in the Cabinet, and every consideration\r\nwas shown to them--at Ghevgeli, for instance, where building material\r\nwas, after the War, so scarce that many of the inhabitants had nothing\r\nbut a hole in the ground, the prefect caused the two mosques which had\r\nbeen destroyed by shell-fire to be reconstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON THEM BECAUSE OF ROUMANIAN ANTISEMITISM\r\n\r\nIf the Serbs were to express their grievance against the Roumanian\r\nruling class for having landed them in this position, the Roumanians\r\nwould reply that the Serbs do not run the same risk as themselves of\r\nbeing swamped by the undesirable Galician Jew. The Roumanians argue that\r\ntheir peasants will go under if they are not shielded. \"In our last\r\ngreat manoeuvres,\" said the late King Charles to M. de Laveleye,[45]\r\n\"it was proposed to entrust the supply of food to Christians. On the\r\nfirst day the provisions came; on the second everything was late; on the\r\nthird day the whole army was dying of hunger. I was forced to make a\r\nhasty appeal to the Jews. They have great qualities--they are\r\nintelligent, energetic, economical; but these very qualities make them\r\ndangerous to us on economic grounds.\" Roumanians acknowledge that the\r\nagrarian policy of a few vast landowners and a submerged peasantry did\r\nnot admit of peasants being made more formidable by increased education,\r\nand they doubt whether their country-folk, so fond of music and dancing\r\nand drinking, have it in them to rival those Serbian non-commissioned\r\nofficers who, early in 1919, became millionaires by skilful operations\r\non the money market in the Banat. Yet the Serbs are as much addicted as\r\nanyone to the aforementioned delights, and it is probable that the\r\nRoumanian boyars do their own people an injustice. But while the people\r\nwere favoured at the expense of the immigrants--not always very\r\neffectively: the Jews have been prohibited from owning land, yet a fifth\r\nof the whole of Moldavia belongs indirectly to a single Jew--one would\r\nsuppose that some distinction might have been made between the more or\r\nless pernicious alien who is apt to get the village into his toils and\r\nthat other Jew whose family has lived perhaps two hundred years in the\r\ncountry, who feels himself a Roumanian but is legally a foreigner. One\r\nMagder, a Jewish barrister, performed such exploits at the front during\r\nthe Great War that he was mentioned in the communique, a distinction\r\nonly conferred upon two other soldiers. For one and a half years the\r\nofficial publications insisted on Roumanizing his name into Magdeu,\r\nafter which three Cabinet meetings occupied themselves with the subject\r\nand finally announced that the error was not intentional but\r\ntypographical. A French officer wished the Roumanian Croix de Guerre to\r\nbe given to him, but Headquarters refused the request on the ground that\r\nhe was a Jew. One cannot blame the United States for taking the\r\ninitiative in compelling the Roumanians to modify their legislation,\r\nsince the clauses of the Treaty of Berlin were merely carried out to the\r\nextent of naturalizing a maximum of fifty Jews a year, each case having\r\nto undergo innumerable formalities, accompanied with payments to\r\ndeputies and others that rose to 30,000 francs. Many Jews volunteered\r\nfor the army in 1913 for the sake of thus obtaining the naturalization\r\nthat was promised them as a reward; but these promises were frequently\r\nnot kept. A good deal of injustice occurred during the Great War: the\r\n_Moniteur Officiel_, No. 261 (of February 2, 1918), printed a decree\r\nrelating to one Kaufman, who together with two Christian soldiers had\r\nbeen away from his corps for twelve days in the previous September.\r\nKaufman was condemned to death, and the others to five years' hard\r\nlabour. When the King was asked to deal more equitably with the three\r\nmen, Kaufman's sentence was commuted to \"hard labour without limit,\"\r\n_i.e._ for life. It is superfluous to give many illustrations: at\r\nFalticeni seventy-two Jews were imprisoned without a trial for four\r\nmonths, though twelve of them were Roumanian citizens and veterans of\r\n1877, while most of the others had sons at the front; at the village of\r\nFrumusica a major caused the Jews to come out of their synagogue in\r\norder to listen to a speech in which he advised the Christian soldiers\r\nto watch them well, as they were worse than the Germans. No doubt there\r\nwere Jews in the Roumanian army whose patriotism was less than\r\nardent--and who can blame them? In the 69th Regiment a special corps of\r\nJews was clothed in the discarded, dark uniform that was more visible to\r\nthe enemy. In the 65th Regiment Jon Dumitru was paid 14 francs a month\r\nfor spying on his Jewish comrades. At the battle of Savarat, to cover\r\nthe retreat of three battalions, a special corps of Jews was formed--one\r\nhundred and twenty-two men under a Jewish second lieutenant; all but\r\nthree of them were killed or wounded. After this retreat the General,\r\nwho lost his head, commanded that the survivors should be killed\r\nwholesale on account of self-inflicted wounds; but seeing that they were\r\nso numerous (and innocent) he pardoned them, and only executed two Jews,\r\nLubis Strul and Hascal Simha, _pour encourager les autres_. A young\r\ndoctor, 2nd Lieutenant Cohn, who came back from Paris, contracted typhus\r\nat the hospital where he was serving; afterwards he was sent to the 26th\r\nRegiment and kept under observation; it was most suspicious, said the\r\nauthorities, that a Jew should return from France for his military\r\nservice. A reward of 2000 francs was offered to anyone who could supply\r\nincriminating evidence against the doctor, but this was offered in vain.\r\nThe Jews, by the way, were told that while they would be removed from\r\nmenial positions in the hospitals they \"would be tolerated\" as\r\ndoctors--and nearly a hundred of these doctors died on active service.\r\n\r\nThe better class of Roumanians, such as Take Jonescu, is opposed to such\r\nmethods--he was therefore charged with being in the pay of the Jews,\r\nalthough he was a wealthy man (a very successful barrister) whom\r\npolitics made poorer. It remains to be seen whether the\r\nRoumanians--whose position with regard to the Jews is, partly through\r\ntheir own fault, not without peril--will be willing to put into effect\r\nthose reforms to which the Supreme Council compelled them to subscribe.\r\nThe Article in question will probably become a moral weapon, since the\r\nRoumanians regard themselves as on a higher level than the Balkan\r\npeoples, and will not desire that continual complaints should be made\r\nagainst them. One does not expect their prejudices and their\r\napprehensions to be suddenly renounced--instead of judging each case\r\nindividually, the railway administration, after the Government had\r\nagreed that the Jews _en bloc_ could become citizens, barred them _en\r\nbloc_ from that particular service by requiring that candidates should\r\npresent their certificates of baptism. The Agricultural Syndicates have\r\nalso introduced a statute which limits their organizations to Roumanian\r\ncitizens who profess the Christian religion. Gradually--one hopes, for\r\nthe sake of their country--the Roumanians will bring themselves to adopt\r\na less timorous spirit, and to acknowledge that it is more dangerous to\r\nthe Fatherland if a Jew as such is prevented than if he is permitted to\r\nhold the office of street-sweeper. From such lowly public offices, or\r\nfrom that of University Professor, no citizen should be excluded on\r\nreligious grounds or admitted to them \"by exceptional concession.\" And\r\nif a Jewish cab-driver at Bucharest is so severely flogged by his\r\npassengers outside the chief railway-station that he succumbs in the\r\nhospital to his injuries--a fate that overtook one Mendel Blumenthal, a\r\nman fifty-three years of age, in September 1919--one trusts that a\r\nnewspaper article asking for an inquiry will henceforward not be\r\ncensored. \"It is true,\" said Dr. Vaida-Voevod, then the Prime Minister,\r\n\"that the Jews still evince some reluctance to assimilate intellectually\r\nwith our people or to identify their interests with those of the\r\nRoumanian State. But goodwill should be shown on both sides, and the\r\novertures should be reciprocal.\" Thanks very largely to the former\r\nLiberal Premier, M. Bratiano, whose party was responsible for much\r\nilliberal legislation--one of his powerful brothers was popularly said\r\nto eat a Jew at every meal--the Supreme Council acted in such a manner\r\nas to produce a particularly unwanted crisis in the Yugoslav political\r\nworld. Neither Roumanian nor Yugoslav need, in the opinion of Take\r\nJonescu, have considered that their dignity was being slighted, for the\r\ntendency of the League of Nations is to limit the free will of each of\r\nthem. The cardinal doctrine of the League, as Lord Robert Cecil has\r\npointed out, is that its members are _not_ masters in their own house,\r\nbut must obey the decision of the majority. However, the Opposition in\r\nthe Belgrade Skup[vs]tina could not resist from using the delicate\r\nsituation for what many of the deputies thought was a patriotic course\r\nof conduct, and nearly all of them regarded as an admirable party cry.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: _The Defeat of Austria, as seen by the 7th\r\n    Division._ London, 1919.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: _Contemporary Review_, February 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Afterwards Yugoslav Minister at Madrid and then at\r\n    Washington.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: _Fortnightly Review_, June 1919.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Cf. _Manchester Guardian_, December 13, 1918.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: _Land and Water_, May 29, 1919.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: _Nineteenth Century and After_, November 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: _Au Secours des Enfants Serbes._ Paris, 1916.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Several old wooden warships, such as the _Aurora_,\r\n    the _Schwartzenberg_ and the _Vulcan_, were lying for years in\r\n    [vS]ibenik harbour, where they were used as repair-ships,\r\n    store-ships, etc. When the Italians evacuated Dalmatia they\r\n    took these vessels with them, but whether on account of their\r\n    contents or their history we do not know.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: Cf. _Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von\r\n    Serbien und Bosnien wahrend des Mittelalters_, by Dr.\r\n    Constantin Jire[vc]ek.

Pribi[vc]evi['c] had told him that the whole of Istria,\r\n    with Triest, should be Yugoslav. He reminded Magrini that a\r\n    third person was present at the interview.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: The supplies for the Austro-Hungarian army in\r\n    Albania had been concentrated at Rieka. These had to be guarded\r\n    by Yugoslav troops, as the Hungarian watchmen at the port had\r\n    disappeared, and the Russian prisoners employed there--about\r\n    500 men--had also vanished. In order to keep off nocturnal\r\n    plunderers, the Yugoslav troops were told to fire a few shots\r\n    now and then into the air. Is it not possible that the two\r\n    Italian boys who, as Mr. Beaumont reported, were hit during the\r\n    night by stray bullets and succumbed in hospital to their\r\n    injuries--is it not possible that they were out for plunder and\r\n    that this incident should not be used to illustrate what Mr.\r\n    Beaumont (of the _Daily Telegraph_) calls \"the worst\r\n    characteristics of Balkan terrorism\" on the part of the troops?\r\n    During the twenty days of the Yugoslav regime their authorities\r\n    sold, as they were justified in doing, tobacco from these\r\n    warehouses to the value of 120,000 crowns. It was generally\r\n    said in Rieka that the Italians in four days had given away six\r\n    million crowns' worth, that large quantities of flour were\r\n    removed until the British put a stop to this, and that the\r\n    robberies were flagrant. These allegations may have been untrue\r\n    or exaggerated, but individuals were pointed out who in a\r\n    mysterious manner had suddenly become affluent; it would at any\r\n    rate have been as well if the I.N.C. had ordered some\r\n    investigation. Since they failed to do so, it is natural that\r\n    gossip flourished. In Triest, by the way, even the Italian\r\n    population is reputed to have been disgusted when about forty\r\n    waggon-loads of flour and twenty of sugar were taken from the\r\n    stores of the former Austrian army and shipped to Italy.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Most people have assumed that this was done in\r\n    order that Rieka should be left to Austria-Hungary, although\r\n    they should have taken with some grains of salt this Italian\r\n    generosity which presented the Habsburgs with a good harbour\r\n    instead of one of those others in Croatia which the Italians of\r\n    to-day are never weary of extolling. The real reasons why Rieka\r\n    was omitted from the Treaty of London are, as the _Secolo_\r\n    (January 12, 1919) remarks, perfectly well known. \"In order,\"\r\n    it says, \"to claim Fiume it is necessary to make appeal to the\r\n    right of the people to dispose freely of themselves. In this\r\n    case the same principle must be admitted for the people of\r\n    Dalmatia, who are Slav in a crushing majority.

Had\r\n    they, on the other hand, asked the people if they spoke\r\n    Croatian and put down as Croats those who answered yes, there\r\n    would, in the opinion of an expert, Dr. Arthur Gavazzi, have\r\n    remained not one single Italian--certainly not the members of\r\n    the Italian National Council--as everyone, he says, speaks and\r\n    knows Croat. This is a fairly emphatic proof that the fortunes\r\n    of Rieka are bound up with those of its suburbs and the\r\n    hinterland.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Being the senior in rank of the Allied Generals,\r\n    General Grazioli claimed supreme command of all the Allied\r\n    troops, but this the French General refused, maintaining--much\r\n    to the disgust of the Italians--that he was under the orders of\r\n    Franchet d'Esperey, who was then in command of the Army of the\r\n    Orient. The Italians were so determined to preserve in their\r\n    own hands the military supremacy that a very senior General,\r\n    one Caneva, was kept in the background of the palace with the\r\n    sole object of stepping forward if any Allied officer senior to\r\n    General Grazioli should by chance be posted to the town. The\r\n    disrespectful Allies used to call Caneva \"the man in the\r\n    cellar.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: The town of Yugoslavia which, after Austria's\r\n    collapse, was stirred the most profoundly by its postage stamps\r\n    was Zagreb. In order to commemorate the establishment of the\r\n    new State the Croatian Post Office published four stamps, which\r\n    were on sale on November 29. The whole edition consisted of\r\n    100,000 stamps, of which 24,000 were allotted to Zagreb, the\r\n    rest going to other parts of the province. It was obvious that\r\n    there would be a great demand for these stamps, and in order to\r\n    check any abuses or clandestine traffic it was decided that\r\n    they should be sold nowhere but at the post offices, also that\r\n    each purchaser would only be allowed to buy a limited quantity.\r\n    At 8 a.m. the sale began, but at seven many hundreds of people\r\n    were waiting outside the chief post office, the post office at\r\n    the station and another in the Upper Town. The face value of\r\n    the four stamps, added together, was one crown. At first they\r\n    were resold for between 4 and 20 crowns, then the price jumped\r\n    to 30, and by 10 a.m. the 45-heller stamp (of which only 15,000\r\n    had been printed) was sold out. Collectors were paying 8 or 10\r\n    crowns for it, in order to complete their sets. At noon the\r\n    offices were all shut, as the rush was considered too\r\n    dangerous. More than 1000 persons were in the great hall at the\r\n    Head Office and another 2000 were gathered outside. Nearly all\r\n    the windows where the stamps were being sold were broken. At\r\n    the Station Post Office the people began to fight with the\r\n    sentries. The National Guard had to be sent for. At 4 p.m. the\r\n    post offices had no stamps left (and citizens who had been\r\n    waiting all day to buy an ordinary stamp could not be served).\r\n    At 5 p.m. people who for the first time in their lives were\r\n    taking an interest in philately, wanted 300-500 crowns from\r\n    collectors for a whole series. Between 5 and 6 p.m. a stamp\r\n    exchange was held in the entrance hall. Eight hundred to one\r\n    thousand crowns were being demanded for the series. Soldiers\r\n    were willing to give the four stamps in exchange for a pair of\r\n    boots, others were asking for sugar, coffee or petrol. The\r\n    price which was ultimately established was 250 crowns.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Out of the hundreds of available documents it\r\n    will suffice if I print one.

This petition of mine was\r\n    answered by Italian authorities in the negative. After the\r\n    Congress of Rome in 1918 I and some of my comrades who had\r\n    recently applied for admission were permitted to join the\r\n    Yugoslav legion on June 1. I was right away sent to the front\r\n    of the Tyrol, where on August 7 I was wounded in a hard bayonet\r\n    fight. On this occasion I was decorated by the Italian\r\n    Commander for valour. After 45 days of hospital by my own\r\n    request I was sent to the front, where I remained up to the\r\n    break-up of Austria or until we Yugoslav legion were disarmed\r\n    by Italians and as a reward for our participation in the war we\r\n    were interned as prisoners of war at Casale di Altamura in the\r\n    province of Bari.

No doubt the\r\n    goodness of the soil had something to do with this decision,\r\n    but, more, the liberal methods of the Serbs. No military\r\n    service was as yet exacted--all that the Magyars had been asked\r\n    to do was to work for two months in obliterating the ravages of\r\n    war. The priest and the schoolmaster who had come from Hungary\r\n    before the War still exercised their functions, and--in\r\n    contrast with what had previously been the case--both the\r\n    Magyar and the Serbian language were taught, the latter from\r\n    the third class upwards. Altogether there was perfect harmony\r\n    between the Magyars and the Serbs; when I was there the only\r\n    racial question which occupied the Magyar farmers was the\r\n    resolve of their _intelligentsia_ to have, as centre-half in\r\n    the football team, not a Magyar but a more skilful Jewish\r\n    player.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: The Southern Slavs generally acknowledged that\r\n    the Foreign Office was bound to behave to Italy, one of the\r\n    Great Powers, with a certain deference.

Thus if Koranji Sandor is\r\n    decorated he is to call himself henceforward Vitez Koranji\r\n    Sandor, and that is the correct address on an envelope.

The\r\n    [vS]ibenik ladies and men, relying perhaps on the words of\r\n    Admiral Millo with regard to Allied colours, never dreamed that\r\n    any objection would be made. But suddenly one evening everybody\r\n    with these colours was attacked by Italian soldiers, who tore\r\n    them off and explained that it was done by the General's order.\r\n    Italian officers did not interfere while ladies were being very\r\n    roughly handled. A certain Jakovljevi['c], a shopkeeper, who\r\n    had sold an American flag, was imprisoned. On the same evening\r\n    a number of prominent citizens were summoned before the town\r\n    commandant, Colonel Cappone, who spoke as follows: \"A Croat, a\r\n    Croat has dared to display a flag before an ardito!\" [An\r\n    American flag.] \"This fool! instead of giving him a black eye,\r\n    the ardito pulled off his flag.

You are the leaders who will be responsible for\r\n    anything that happens to-morrow.\" [This was the eve of the\r\n    Italian national celebration of June 1.] \"Our arditi are\r\n    blood-thirsty; do not be surprised if some lady of yours\r\n    receives a black eye.... We are the masters here! This is\r\n    Italy! This is Italy! We have won the War, we have spent\r\n    milliards and sacrificed millions of soldiers.\" On this Mr.\r\n    Mi[vs]e Ivanovi['c] remarked: \"I beg your pardon, but the Paris\r\n    Conference has not yet decided the fate of these territories.\"\r\n    And the Colonel replied, \"It has been decided!

Good night, gentlemen.\" This declaration made by\r\n    the town commandant, presumably a responsible officer, was\r\n    testified by the signature of all those who were present....\r\n    When, in 1921, the Italians were leaving [vS]ibenik they\r\n    destroyed a large number of young trees in the park and\r\n    elsewhere.

The nations, he points out, are not two but one--one\r\n    in blood, in temperament, in habits, in tradition, in language;\r\n    round the fireside they tell their children the same stories,\r\n    sing them the same songs: the greatest poem in Serbian\r\n    literature, as all the world knows, was written by a\r\n    Prince-Bishop of Montenegro. Since the day when the Serbian\r\n    State came into existence it has been, he says, the constant,\r\n    burning desire of the Montenegrins to be joined to it. We may\r\n    well rub our eyes at a letter in the same newspaper from Lord\r\n    Sydenham, who makes the perfectly inane remark that this\r\n    constant, burning desire was never probable. \"Montenegro\r\n    already _is_ Serbia,\" says Mr. Leiper, \"and Serbia Montenegro,\r\n    in every way except verbally.\" But Lord Sydenham has set\r\n    himself up as a stern critic of the Serbs in Montenegro;\r\n    therefore he cannot countenance the Leiper articles, which give\r\n    him \"pain and surprise.\" Is he surprised that Mr. Leiper, a\r\n    shrewd Scottish traveller, who is acquainted with the language,\r\n    should disagree with him? \"The great mass of the people,\" says\r\n    Mr. Leiper, \"are as firm as a rock in their determination that\r\n    Nicholas shall never return.\" Listen to Lord Sydenham: \"I am\r\n    afraid,\" says he, \"that your correspondent has been misled by\r\n    the raging, tearing Serbian propaganda with which I am\r\n    familiar.\" And he quotes for our benefit an unnamed\r\n    correspondent of his in Montenegro who says that the people\r\n    there are terrified of speaking. It is much to be desired that\r\n    a little of this terror might invade a gentleman who plunges\r\n    headlong into matters which he does not understand.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 43: Cf. _Morning Post_, November 17, 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 44: A most vivid account of this affair was\r\n    contributed to the _Chicago Tribune_ (July 13, 1919) by its\r\n    correspondent, Thomas Stewart Ryan, one of the two neutral\r\n    eye-witnesses. He came to the conclusion that as Italy was an\r\n    interested party and was exasperated by the long delay in the\r\n    decision, an outbreak even more violent might occur unless her\r\n    forces were brought down to the level of the other Allies. In\r\n    alliance with the city rabble, the Giovani Fiumani, Italian\r\n    soldiers attacked the French: \"I can state emphatically,\" says\r\n    Mr. Ryan, \"that the French guards did nothing whatever to\r\n    provoke the assault, some details of which would blot the\r\n    escutcheon of most savage tribes. I saw soldiers of France\r\n    killed, after surrender, by their supposed Allies.... I could\r\n    scarcely believe my ears when Italian officers rapped out the\r\n    order to load. But they seemed to remember that Frenchmen can\r\n    fight.\" However, he also saw an Italian officer who \"prevented\r\n    this murder and held back the civilians who were trying to\r\n    reach their victim. I must record it to the credit of this\r\n    officer that his was the only Italian voice to defend the game\r\n    little soldier. 'A hundred against one! Shame on you, soldiers\r\n    of Italy!' I wish I knew this officer's name.\" At another part\r\n    of the harbour, \"A British naval officer, fearing that the\r\n    wounded Frenchman would be stabbed inside the court to which he\r\n    was dragged, followed the body and defied the captain of\r\n    carabinieri, who ordered him to leave.\" And at the close \"I was\r\n    no longer alone with my friend as a neutral eye-witness. The\r\n    British Admiral Sinclair appeared, causing much perturbation to\r\n    the Italian officers, who though some of them had just taken\r\n    part in the shambles, were already glib with excuses. 'The\r\n    British Admiral wants to know' was enough to bring the Italian\r\n    officer running and bowing, with 'I beg of you....' 'We are\r\n    willing to explain all....' American naval officers of the\r\n    destroyer _Talbot_ were also among this post-mortem crowd. In a\r\n    French motor bearing two Italian officers who stood up to ward\r\n    off possible shots, came a French captain. He was of that calm,\r\n    splendid type that makes you think of the Chevalier Bayard, a\r\n    knightly figure. Quietly he moved among his dead. Not by the\r\n    flicker of an eyelid did he give token of what was working deep\r\n    down in that French heart of his. I heard an Italian officer\r\n    tell him that the French had started the most regrettable\r\n    affair by firing on the Italian ships. The officer spoke this\r\n    falsehood under the glazed stare of the French dead and the\r\n    protesting gaze of the wounded. The French captain nodded his\r\n    head, remarked, 'Oh yes! of course. Now we must only pick up\r\n    the wounded,' and, with all the gentleness of a mother beside\r\n    her child's sick-bed....\" A very good account of this shocking\r\n    episode is contained in _A Political Escapade: The Story of\r\n    Fiume and d'Annunzio_, by J. N. Macdonald, O.S.B. (London,\r\n    1921). His narrative is extremely well documented--he appears\r\n    to have been a member of the British Mission. \"It is\r\n    incomprehensible,\" says he, \"how officers and men could attack\r\n    the very post that they had been sent to defend. Moreover, they\r\n    were over 100 strong and fully armed, whereas the French\r\n    garrison was small and had no intention of putting up a\r\n    defence.\" One of the lesser outrages described by Father\r\n    Macdonald, since it was not attended with fatal results, was\r\n    that which happened to Captain Gaillard, who from his window\r\n    saw an Italian lieutenant shoot and kill with his revolver an\r\n    unarmed Annamese. The captain cried out with rage, and when his\r\n    room was entered by fifteen men carrying rifles with fixed\r\n    bayonets and they ordered him to go with them, Madame Gaillard\r\n    tried to intervene and received a blow on the arm dealt with\r\n    the butt end of a rifle. At this juncture an Italian officer\r\n    appeared and roughly told Gaillard to come without further\r\n    delay. A mob of civilians and soldiers who were outside greeted\r\n    Gaillard with a shower of blows, and while they went along the\r\n    street, the officer escorting him kept up a volley of abuse\r\n    against France and England. Very fortunately for Gaillard he\r\n    was brought into the presence of an Italian officer to whom he\r\n    was personally known.

When the same question\r\nwas asked of Gabriele d'Annunzio he said that Rieka was Italian then and\r\nfor ever, and that he who proclaimed its annexation to Italy was a\r\nmutilated war-combatant. Most of the citizens, as time went on, began to\r\nthink that they would sooner hear about Rieka's annexation to another\r\nland, which was the work of Nature. Those who did not entertain this\r\nview were the salaried assistants of d'Annunzio and the speculators who\r\nhad bought up millions of crowns in the hope that Italy, as mistress of\r\nRieka, would change them into lire, even if she did not give so good a\r\nrate as at Triest. The poet addressed himself to the France of Victor\r\nHugo, the England of Milton, and the America of Lincoln, but not to the\r\nbusiness men of Rieka, who would have told him that 70 per cent. of the\r\nproperty, both movable and immovable, was Yugoslav, while 10 per cent.\r\nwas Italian and the rest in the hands of foreigners. Not waiting to\r\nlisten to such details, d'Annunzio sailed, with a thousand men, to\r\nZadar, had a conference with Admiral Millo, and won him over. Whether he\r\nwould have persuaded Victor Hugo, Milton or Abraham Lincoln, we must\r\ngravely doubt. \"I am not bound to win,\" says Lincoln, whom we may take\r\nas the spokesman of the trio, \"but I am bound to be true. I am not bound\r\nto succeed, but I am bound to live up to what light I have. I must stand\r\nwith anybody that stands right; stand with him while he is right, and\r\npart with him when he goes wrong.\" In view of the wilful trespass\r\ncommitted by Italians on the property and rights of the Yugoslavs and\r\nthe oft-repeated guarantees of protection given to the Slavs by the\r\nAmerican Government against such invasion, it is passing strange that\r\nd'Annunzio should have appealed to Abraham Lincoln of all people. As for\r\nAdmiral Millo, he telegraphed to Rome that he had thrown in his fortunes\r\nwith those of d'Annunzio, and he made to the populace a very fiery\r\nspeech. It is not known whether he communicated with the France of\r\nClemenceau, the England of Lloyd George and the America of Wilson, whose\r\nrepresentative he apparently continued to be for the rest of Dalmatia,\r\nwhile relinquishing that post with regard to Zadar, his residence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAVE OF ITALIAN IMPERIALISM\r\n\r\nIf Admiral Millo's rebellion had been published in the press of November\r\n16th, it is most likely that 250, instead of 160, Socialists would have\r\nbeen successful at the General Election--an election which Signor\r\nNitti, that very able parliamentarian, had brought about for the\r\npurpose, amongst other things, of testing the forces and popularity of\r\nthe Nationalist party. The old Chamber had--voicing the wishes of the\r\npeople--voted for the open annexation of Rieka, without war or violence;\r\nthe Nationalists, in order to gain their ends, would seemingly have\r\nstopped at nothing. Military adventures, the breaking of alliances,\r\nagrarian and industrial upheaval--it was all the same to them. They\r\nscoffed at the common sense of the imperturbable Nitti when he said that\r\nthe Italians, like their Roman ancestors, must return to the plough.\r\nFuriously they harped upon the facts that bread was dearer now, that\r\ncoal was nearly unprocurable. And Giolitti, who in 1915 had strenuously\r\ntried to keep the country neutral, said in a great speech before this\r\n1919 election that the War had been waged between England and Germany\r\nfor the supremacy of the survivor and that Italy should never have\r\nparticipated. He enlarged upon the fearful sufferings of his countrymen,\r\nand he compared the gains of Italy with those of her Allies. Nor was he\r\ndeterred when Signor Salandra, the former Premier, called him Italy's\r\nevil spirit who, devoid of any patriotism, would have sold the\r\nFatherland to the Central Powers for a mess of pottage. Giolitti, on\r\nwhom 300 deputies had left their cards in the tragic hours before the\r\ndeclaration of war, had good reason to know that even if Giolittism had\r\nmelted away, the House had secretly remained Giolittian.\r\n\r\nA new electoral system was introduced, whereby the people voted for\r\nprogrammes and parties rather than directly for individual candidates.\r\nThis, it was hoped, would render corruption more difficult by enclosing\r\nthe individual within the framework of the list, and it was also hoped\r\nthat there would be less violence than usual. As a matter of fact there\r\nprobably was a diminution with respect to these two practices, but only\r\nbecause of the large number of abstentions--merely 29 per cent. voted in\r\nRome, 38 per cent. in Naples, and in Turin scarcely more. The people\r\nwere tired of the excessive complexity and dissimulation of Italian\r\npolitics. There was a good deal of violence--in Milan, Florence, Bologna\r\nand Sicily the riots were sometimes fatal--and with such an electorate,\r\nmore extensive than heretofore, so that symbols had often to be used\r\ninstead of the printed word, it was to be expected that there would not\r\nbe an atmosphere of even relatively calm discussion. At Naples 132\r\ncandidates struggled for eleven seats--their meetings were\r\nindescribable. And it may be thought that in such conditions the\r\nvictorious parties would not necessarily reflect the wishes of the\r\ncountry. The Nationalists were dispersed, the Giolittians were\r\nrouted--the Socialists increased from 40 to 156, and the Catholics from\r\n30 to 101. Gabriele d'Annunzio had been the Socialists' chief elector.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR WISH FOR RIEKA, DEAD OR ALIVE\r\n\r\nThere was now a fair hope that the Government would be in a position to\r\nsolve the Adriatic problem. The Italian delegates in Paris had suggested\r\nthat, in the independent buffer State, Rieka should have a separate\r\nmunicipal status, and that a narrow strip of land should join the buffer\r\nState to Italy. On December 9, a memorandum was signed by the\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain and America, which was the best\r\ncompromise which anyone had yet proposed. The strip was dismissed as\r\nbeing \"counter to every known consideration of geography, economics and\r\nterritorial convenience.\" [Nevertheless this very dangerous expedient of\r\nthe strip, after having been thus roundly rejected by the Allies, formed\r\na part of the Treaty of Rapallo in November 1920--the Yugoslavs had most\r\ngenerously given way rather than leave this exasperating Adriatic\r\nproblem still unsolved.] Rieka with her environment was to be a _corpus\r\nseparatum_--and this was the chief point which made the proposals\r\ninacceptable to Italy. That Socialist group which is represented by the\r\n_Avanti_ seemed to be the only one whose attitude was not intransigeant.\r\nThe question of Rieka, it argued, was not isolated, but should be\r\nconsidered as one of the numerous questions of Italian foreign politics.\r\nIt laughed at those who every moment cry \"Our Fiume,\" because there are\r\nin the town many people who speak Italian. Other groups of Socialists\r\nhad altered very much from the day when the three delegates--Labriola,\r\nRaimundo and Cappa--spoke of the Adriatic at the Congress which Kerensky\r\nsummoned to Petrograd. Labriola was considered the most arrogant and\r\nchauvinist of the trio, but not even he demanded Rieka--there was no\r\nquestion of it at the time. Still less did he dream of Zadar or\r\n[vS]ibenik; what he pleaded for was Triest, Istria and an island.... In\r\nDecember 1919 some Italian Socialist papers were printing reports on the\r\neconomic life of Rieka, which was in a disastrous condition. But the\r\ngreat majority of Italians were so bent upon securing Rieka that they\r\ndid not seem to care if by that time she were dead. And they threw a\r\nlittle dust into their eyes, if not into the eyes of the Entente, by\r\ndeclaring that if they did not annex Rieka that unhappy, faithful town\r\nwould annex them. The self-appointed Consiglio Nazionale Italiano of\r\nRieka was, however, at this time less preoccupied with the Madre Patria\r\nthan with her own very troublesome affairs; she had no leisure to\r\norganize those patriotic deputations to Rome, which sailed so frequently\r\nacross the Adriatic and which, as was revealed by Signor Nitti's organ\r\n_Il Tempo_,[46] were too often composed of speculators who liked to\r\nreceive in Italy the sum of 60 centesimi for an unstamped Austrian paper\r\ncrown that was barely worth ten. The disillusioned C.N.I. would have\r\ngiven a good many lire to be rid of d'Annunzio; the citizens were\r\ninvited to vote on the following question: \"Is it desirable to accept\r\nthe proposal of the Italian Government, declared acceptable by the\r\nC.N.I. at its meeting of December 15, which absolves Gabriele d'Annunzio\r\nand his legionaries from their oath to hold Rieka until its annexation\r\nhas been decreed and effected?\" On December 21, in the Chamber, Signor\r\nNitti announced that more than half the citizens had voted and that\r\nfour-fifths of them were in favour of the suggestion of the C.N.I. But\r\nd'Annunzio, whose adherents by no means facilitated the plebiscite,\r\nproclaimed it null and void. Yet, after all, Italy had likewise, on\r\nevery occasion when the Yugoslavs suggested a plebiscite under impartial\r\ncontrol, refused to sanction it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITLESS EFFORTS OF ITALY'S ALLIES\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a ray of light shone through the clouds. The ever-cheerful\r\nSignor Nitti, after a conference with Lloyd George and Clemenceau--no\r\nYugoslav being present, whereas Signor Nitti was both pleader and\r\njudge--was authorized to say that the December memorandum had been\r\nshelved. Terms more favourable to Italy were substituted and the\r\nYugoslav Government were told they must accept them. One of these terms\r\nwas to modify the Wilson line in Istria, ostensibly for the protection\r\nof Triest and in reality to dominate the railway line Rieka-St.\r\nPeter-Ljubljana; another of the terms was to present Italy with that\r\nnarrow corridor which in December the Allies had so peremptorily\r\ndisallowed. No wonder the American Ambassador in France gave his\r\nwarning. \"You are going,\" he said, \"much too far and much too quickly.\r\nPresident Wilson cannot keep pace with you.\" The French Government was\r\npassing through a period of change, and these new proposals, as was\r\nunderlined in the _Temps_,[47] emanated from London. Mr. Lloyd George,\r\nwho may have wished for Signor Nitti's aid in his offensive against\r\nFrance in the Russian and Turkish questions, was this time very badly\r\nserved by his intuition. The Yugoslavs were ordered to accept the new\r\nproposals or to submit to the application of the Treaty of London, that\r\nsecret and abandoned instrument which--to mention only one of the\r\nobjections against it--provided for complete Yugoslav sovereignty over\r\nRieka, a solution that, in view of Italy's inflamed public opinion, was\r\nfor the time being impracticable. And while the Yugoslavs were told that\r\nRieka would, under the Treaty of London, fall to them, no details were\r\ngiven as to how d'Annunzio was to be removed. \"Nous sommes dans\r\nl'incoherence,\" as Clemenceau used to say of the political condition of\r\nFrance before the war. Seeing that the Italian Government and the C.N.I.\r\nhad shown themselves so powerless, were France and England going to turn\r\nthe poet out? But Mr. Lloyd George was more fortunate than Disraeli,\r\nwhose error in the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina had had such dire\r\nresults; on February 13, a very firm note was issued by President\r\nWilson, which compelled France and Great Britain to withdraw from the\r\nposition they had taken up. Wilson would have nothing to do with the\r\nnotorious corridor, though Clemenceau had said on January 13, to the\r\nYugoslav delegates: \"Si nous n'avions pas fait cette concession, nous\r\nn'avions pas eu le reste.\" \"The American Government,\" said Wilson,\r\n\"feels that it cannot sacrifice the principle for which it entered the\r\nwar to gratify the improper ambition of one of its associates, Italy, to\r\npurchase a temporary appearance of calm in the Adriatic at the price of\r\na future world conflagration.\" The rejoinder of the French and British\r\nPremiers was a trifle lame, and when they ventured to add that they\r\ncould not believe that it was the purpose of the American people, as the\r\nPresident threatened, to retire from the treaty with Germany and the\r\nagreement of June 28, 1919, with France unless his point of view was\r\nadopted in this particular case, which, in their opinion, had \"the\r\nappearance of being so inadequate,\" they were not caring to remember\r\nthat while their own countries and Italy were suffering from a lack of\r\nfood-stuffs and provisions were being imported at a disastrous rate of\r\nexchange from the United States, the products of Yugoslavia, such as\r\nmeat and meal, could not be obtained because Rieka, which ought surely\r\nto serve its hinterland, was at that moment not available, owing to\r\nd'Annunzio. At the same time the President did not go to the opposite\r\nextreme of simply allocating the port to Yugoslavia, which the\r\napplication of the Treaty of London would involve. He preferred to act\r\non the principle that the differences between Italy and the Yugoslavs\r\nwere inconsiderable, especially as compared with the magnitude of their\r\ncommon interests. And direct negotiations between the two parties were\r\nto be recommended, with the proviso that no use be made of France and\r\nGreat Britain's immoral suggestion that an agreement be reached on \"the\r\nbasis of compensation elsewhere at the expense of nationals of a third\r\nPower.\" It had indeed been proposed that the Yugoslavs should be bribed\r\nby concessions in Albania, but this idea was very explicitly rejected\r\nand on more than one occasion by the Yugoslav delegates in Paris.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the following months, the Yugoslavs and the Italians\r\nnegotiated, the task of their delegates was impeded by the occasional\r\nCabinet crises in Belgrade and in Rome. It was made no easier by those\r\nItalians who clamorously objected to the remark of Clemenceau, when he\r\nsaid that both Yugoslavs and Italians had been compelled to fight in\r\nAustria's army. The _Corriere d'Italia_ told him that he displayed the\r\nzeal of a corporal to defend the Yugoslavs. After alluding to his\r\n\"historical inexactitudes,\" it reminded him of the Italians who were\r\nslain at Reims and the Chemin des Dames, but as usual omitted to speak\r\nof the French soldiers who fell in Italy. And, while the negotiations\r\nwere being carried on, Gabriele d'Annunzio clung to his town. The\r\ncompromise of a mixed administration seemed to have small chance of\r\nbeing realized. It had been proposed by that Inter-Allied Commission\r\nwhich was set up to investigate the circumstances of the French\r\nmassacre; and the Italian delegate, General di Robilant, not only said\r\nin his report[48] to the Senate that this compromise was most favourable\r\nfor Italian aspirations but he is alleged also to have included some\r\nvery drastic criticism of the actions of the high military authorities,\r\nwhom he charged with unconstitutional interference. Nevertheless neither\r\nthe poet nor the Premier were as yet in a tractable mood with regard to\r\nthe Rieka problem. Signor Nitti, parading his bonhomie, championed the\r\ncause in a more statesmanlike fashion; he did not, like d'Annunzio,\r\nevoke the world's ridicule by his footlight attitudes and those of his\r\nfaithful supporters who, when his \"Admiral\" Rizzo abandoned him, when\r\nGiorati his confidant withdrew, when even Millo advised moderation, took\r\ncertain piratical steps in order to keep the garrison supplied with\r\nfood,[49] and composed an anthem which on ceremonial occasions was\r\nchanted in the poet's honour. But when Signor Nitti observed, with the\r\nutmost affability, that Rieka had, after the fall of the Crown of St.\r\nStephen, become mistress of her own fate and as such, regardless of the\r\nTreaty of London, asked for inclusion in Italy, he, the Prime Minister,\r\nwas vying in recklessness with d'Annunzio. The prevailing sentiment both\r\nin Triest and Rieka, said the _Times_,[50] was that both these towns\r\nshould become free ports in order to serve their hinterlands, which are\r\nnot Italian. \"Italy is neglecting Triest in favour of Venice,\" says the\r\ndispatch. In Rieka, where the situation was even worse, \"an honest\r\nplebiscite, even if confined to the Italian part of the city, would give\r\na startling result. The Italians of Rieka are convinced that their\r\nexistence depends on good relations with the Yugoslavs. They wish the\r\ntown and port to be independent under the sovereignty of the League of\r\nNations. This I have recently been told by a large number of Italians in\r\nRieka who are obliged, in public, to support d'Annunzio.\" Signor Nitti\r\nmust have been aware that the voice of the C.N.I. was very far from\r\nbeing the voice of Rieka. The C.N.I. had reasons of their own for\r\nwishing to postpone the day when their arbitrary powers would come to an\r\nend and a legal Government, whether that of the League of Nations or of\r\nthe people's will or of Italy or of Yugoslavia, be established.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OF RIEKA'S SCANDALS\r\n\r\nOwing to the complaints of innumerable citizens the C.N.I. had nominated\r\na Commission to inquire into the pillage of the former Austrian stores\r\nat Rieka--this town, as we have mentioned, had been the base for the\r\nAlbanian army--and the findings of that Commission displayed the\r\nculpability of the most prominent members of the C.N.I. This document\r\nwas for a long time unknown to the general public, but was afterwards\r\npublished in Italy by Signor Riccardo Zanella, himself an Italian and an\r\nex-deputy and ex-mayor of Rieka. There was, by the way, an article in\r\nthe Triest paper, _Il Lavoratore_, at the beginning of September 1920,\r\nwherein one Tercilio Borghese, a former member of d'Annunzio's army,\r\nconfesses that on June 21, he was ordered by d'Annunzio, as also by\r\nColonel Sani and Captain Baldassari, to get Signor Zanella in some way\r\nout of the world. Hinko Camero and Angelo Marzi['c], his fellow-workers,\r\nhad likewise to be removed; and for this purpose Borghese says that the\r\nColonel provided him with a revolver. He was also to try to seize any\r\ncompromising documents. But he was forced by his conscience to reveal\r\neverything to Zanella.... Now this confession may be true or false, but\r\nthe Triest \"fascisti\" (Nationalists) believed in it, for they issued a\r\nplacard on which they called Borghese a traitor and threatened him with\r\ndeath. \"He who after November 1918 returns to the martyred town,\" writes\r\nSignor Zanella, \"is simply stupefied in beholding that those personages\r\nwho now strut on the political scene, burning with the most ardent\r\nItalian patriotism, are the same who until the eve of Vittorio Veneto\r\nwere the most unbending, the most eloquent and the most devoted\r\npartisans and servants of the reactionary Magyar regime.\" And around\r\nthem a number of more or less questionable persons were assembled, whose\r\nconduct with regard to the disposal of the Austrian stores has now been\r\nso severely censured. That organization which, dependent on the C.N.I.,\r\nwas supposed to administer the stores, was known as the Adriatic\r\nCommission. \"We all knew,\" said the Commission of inquiry, \"that the\r\neyes of the whole world were gazing at our little town.\" It was,\r\ntherefore, very desirable that nothing irregular should be done; whereas\r\nthe judges give a most unfavourable verdict. Nobody, they say, would\r\nrejoice more than themselves if their conclusions should be shown to be\r\ncompletely or partly erroneous, for they are all of them penetrated with\r\nlove for the fatherland Italy. But they relate, with chapter and verse,\r\na large number of peculiar transactions which show that the goods were\r\nvery improperly and very hastily auctioned, and that those who reaped\r\nthe benefit were nearly always the same people. To give one instance,\r\nsome of the wine, said to have been damaged, was sold at 260 crowns the\r\nthousand litres, while undamaged wine brought 320 crowns, and the firm\r\nof Riboli, the only one which appeared at the so-called auction, was\r\nonly asked to pay 30 crowns. Thus a considerable number of people in\r\nRieka were anxious that the town should not come under any Government\r\nwhich might punish the culprits or make them disgorge. And Nitti and\r\nd'Annunzio agreed with these interested parties in opposing a solution\r\nother than the overlordship of Italy. \"The Yugoslavs should understand,\"\r\nsaid the amiable Premier, \"that Italy has no intention of acting in a\r\nmanner distasteful to them, but is struggling for a national ideal.\" And\r\nmeantime what of the conditions in the poor distracted town?\r\n\"D'Annunzio,\" says an Italian paper, \"is no longer the master of Rieka.\r\nHe has become the prisoner of his own troops.... While he amuses himself\r\nand organizes the worst orgies, his troops quarrel in the streets and\r\ndischarge their weapons.... A great many of them have their mistresses\r\nin the hospital, where they make themselves at home. When the doctors,\r\nafter some time, protested, the arditi, with bombs in their hands,\r\nthreatened to blow up the hospital if they were not allowed to enter\r\nit.\" On the other hand the pale, weary-looking poet succeeded in\r\nimpressing on a special correspondent of the _Morning Post_ that he was\r\n\"master of his job.\" He told this gentleman--and was apparently\r\nbelieved--that with the consent and approval of the C.N.I. he had had\r\nthe whole place mined, city and harbour, and was prepared to blow it up\r\nat a moment's notice. The means by which d'Annunzio, according to his\r\ninterviewer, worked on those who were depressed with gazing at the empty\r\nshops, the silent warehouses, the grass-grown wharves, so that the\r\noverwhelming majority of the town supported him, was by simply making to\r\nthem an eloquent speech. D'Annunzio would indeed be the master of his\r\njob if with some rounded periods in Italian he could cause the very\r\nnumerous hostile business men to forget so blissfully that they were\r\nmen of business. Under his dispensation the town is said to have been\r\nturned into a place of debauchery. Accusations were brought against his\r\nsexual code, and with regard to men of commerce: \"those who are not\r\npartisans of d'Annunzio are expelled, and their establishments handed\r\nover to friends of the ruling power.... Woe to him who dares to condemn\r\nthe transactions of the poet's adherents. There and then he is\r\npronounced to be a Yugoslav, is placed under surveillance and is\r\npersecuted.\" These Italian critics of the poet do not in the least\r\nexaggerate. One instance of his conduct towards a British firm will be\r\nsufficient. The \"Anglo-Near East Trading Company\" shipped sixty-seven\r\ncases (5292 pairs) of boots to private traders in Belgrade, and on the\r\nway they reached Rieka just before d'Annunzio. In March 1920 they were\r\nstill detained there, and on the 13th of that month a certain Alcesde di\r\nAmbris, who described himself as the Chief of the Cabinet, wrote a\r\nletter saying that the boots were requisitioned, and that they would be\r\npaid for within thirty days at a price fixed on March 5 by experts of\r\nthe local Chamber of Commerce. The company was offered forty lire a\r\npair, but they declined to accept so inadequate a sum. Senor Meynia, the\r\nSpanish Consul, who was also representing Great Britain, attempted in\r\nvarious ways to help the firm; he was finally told by an officer that\r\nthe \"exceptional situation of Rieka compels the Authority to suspend the\r\nexportation or transport of such goods as are thoroughly needed here.\"\r\nAnd the Consul could do no more than protest. One might presume, from\r\nthis officer's reply, that d'Annunzio required the boots for his army.\r\nAs a matter of fact, they were simply sold to a couple of dealers, one\r\nLevy of Triest and Mailaender of Rieka. It is alleged that the prices\r\npaid by these receivers of stolen property was a good deal higher than\r\nforty lire. When Signor di Ambris travelled to Rome in the merry month\r\nof June and enjoyed a consultation with the Prime Minister, who by this\r\ntime was Signor Giolitti, it was not in order to explain any such\r\ntransactions as that one of the boots, but for the purpose, we are told,\r\nof offering the services of d'Annunzio and his legionaries in Albania.\r\nThe regular Italian army was just then being roughly handled by the\r\nnatives.... It may be that Signor di Ambris wanted guarantees that if\r\nthe d'Annunzian troops were to come to the rescue, they would not suffer\r\nthe fate of the Yugoslavs who in the Great War had managed to desert to\r\nItaly, had valiantly fought and won many decorations and--after the\r\nWar--been ignominiously interned. And they had given no grounds for\r\ncharges of financial frailty.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE YUGOSLAV IDEA\r\n\r\nThe months go by and Yugoslavia still survives. At the post-office of a\r\nlarge village in Syrmia, not far from Djakovo, where Bishop Strossmayer\r\nlaboured during fifty-five years for the union of the Southern Slavs\r\nwhich he was destined not to see, a bulky farmer told me that in his\r\nopinion Yugoslavia, created in 1918, was now in 1920 \"kaput.\" He deduced\r\nthis from the fact that a telegram used to travel much more\r\nexpeditiously in Austrian days; but he did not remember that the\r\nYugoslavs, in the Serbian and in the Austro-Hungarian armies, had\r\nsuffered enormous losses in the War, and that while French, Dutch and\r\nSwiss doctors have been obtained by the Belgrade Government, one cannot\r\nuse telegraphists who are ignorant of the language. An excellent\r\nprovince in which Yugoslavia's solidity can be studied is Bosnia. At the\r\noutbreak of the War the Moslems and Croats were not imbued with the\r\nYugoslav idea; it seemed to them that the Serbs, one of whom had slain\r\nthe Archduke, were traitors to Southern Slavdom. During the War the\r\nCroats and Moslems were taught by their Slav officers to be good\r\nnationalists and were given frequent lessons in the art of going over to\r\nthe enemy. After the Armistice one did not see every Serb, Croat and\r\nMoslem in Bosnia forthwith forgetting all the evil of the past. Among\r\nthe less enlightened certain private acts of vengeance had to be\r\nperformed; but these were not as numerous as one might have expected.\r\nAnd very soon the population of Bosnia came to be interested far less in\r\nthe old religious differences--the two deputies Dr. D[vz]amonia and\r\nProfessor Stanojevi['c] smilingly remembered the day when, as\r\nschoolboys at Sarajevo, they had been persuaded by the Austrians to pull\r\nout each other's hair for the reason that one was a Croat and one was a\r\nSerb--and now it was the engrossing subject of Agrarian Reform which\r\nclaimed the attention of Catholic, Orthodox and Moslem. This is not a\r\nreligious question, for while the landlords are mostly Muhammedan begs\r\nabout half the peasants are of the same religion; and the negotiations\r\nhave been marked by a notable absence of passion. Most of the begs\r\nacknowledge that the old regime was unprofitable, for with the peasant\r\npaying one-third to one-fifth of his production to the landlord the land\r\nonly yielded, as compared with the sandy districts of East Prussia, in\r\nthe proportion of five to twenty-two. Under the new order of things,\r\nwith the State in support of the \"usurping\" peasant--so that there are\r\nsaid to be in Bosnia about a thousand peasants who are millionaires (in\r\ncrowns)--there is no longer any dispute with regard to the \"kmet\" land,\r\nwhere the peasants with hereditary rights have become the owners; and\r\nwith regard to the \"begluk,\" which the beg used to let to anyone he\r\npleased, it is only a question as to the degree of compensation. Thus,\r\nit is not among the landowners and the peasants that one must look in\r\nsearching for an anti-national party. Bosnia contains various iron works\r\nand coal mines, where profession is made of Communism. But when the\r\nPrince-Regent was about to come to pay his first official visit in 1920\r\nto Sarajevo the Governor received a communication from the Communists of\r\nZenica, which is on the railway line. They asked for permission to\r\nsalute \"our Prince\" as he came past; and a deputation of these\r\nCommunists, who are very like their colleagues in other parts of\r\nYugoslavia, duly appeared and took part in a ceremony at the station.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESPITE THE NEW PHENOMENON OF COMMUNISM\r\n\r\nJust as innocuous--whatever the enemies of Yugoslavia may say--are the\r\nCommunists in the old kingdom of Serbia. Perhaps in the whole State of\r\nYugoslavia they number 50,000 in a population of about 12,500,000. But\r\nthey are so well organized that in the municipal elections of 1920 they\r\nwere victorious in most of the towns. In Belgrade they secured 3600\r\nvotes, as compared with 3200 for the Radicals, 2800 for the\r\nDemocrats--both of whom were not only badly organized but very\r\nslack--and 605 for the Republicans. However, the Communists refused to\r\nswear the requisite oath, and in consequence were not permitted to take\r\noffice, the Radicals and Democrats forming a union to carry on. It was\r\nagreed to have a new election and the other parties, being now awakened,\r\ndetermined that the Communists should not again top the poll. But in the\r\nprovincial towns they have not by any means shown themselves a\r\ndisintegrating influence. At Ni[vs], for example, they conducted the\r\nmunicipal affairs quite satisfactorily, while at [vC]uprija they\r\nperceived that it would be impossible to put into effect their entire\r\nprogramme, and so, after fourteen days, they resigned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE AND FALL OF COMMUNISM IN YUGOSLAVIA\r\n\r\n... As for the Communists in the Skup[vs]tina, it may be argued that\r\nthough this party of over fifty members has ceased to exist we should\r\nhave said not simply that they are innocuous but that they have been\r\nrendered so. They were in principle against any State which violated\r\ntheir somewhat hazy ideas on the subject of Capital: while professing to\r\naim at the holding of wealth in common they secured a great deal of\r\ntheir success at the polls through the bait of more land for the\r\nindividual, which they dangled before the eyes of the most ignorant\r\nclasses. Some of the electors who supported them were prosperous farmers\r\nunable to resist the idea of a still larger farm; but the majority of\r\ntheir adherents were as ignorant as they were gullible. Yet one should\r\nremember that for most of them this was practically their first\r\nexperience of an election: the constituencies which had formerly been in\r\nAustria-Hungary had always seen the booths under the supervision of the\r\npolice, while the Macedonian voter (three Communists were returned for\r\nSkoplje) had only known the institutions of the Turkish Empire. Being\r\ntold by the Communists that their box at the polling-station was really\r\nthe box for the poor, the Fukara, all the gypsies and so forth of\r\nSkoplje, who had never voted in their lives, hastened to claim the\r\nprivilege, under the impression that a Communist Government would\r\nliberate them from taxes and military service. Other reasons for the\r\nsuccess of the Communists in Yugoslavia, an essentially non-industrial\r\nState, were the general discontent with post-war conditions, and the\r\nvirus which so many of the voters had acquired in Russia or on the\r\nDobrudja front during the War. The activity in the Skup[vs]tina of this\r\nvery indigestible party--largely composed of Turks, Magyars, Albanians,\r\nGermans and others--their activity in and out of Parliament was not\r\nconfined to words. In June 1920 they only refrained from throwing bombs\r\nin the Skup[vs]tina because one of their own members would have been in\r\nperil, and in December a plot against the Prince-Regent and some of the\r\nMinisters was foiled. Thereupon the Emergency Act of December 27, the\r\nso-called Obznana, came into existence. It suspended all Communist\r\nassociations. This Act was issued for the good of the country, but was\r\nnot previously presented to the Constituent Assembly or provided with\r\nthe royal signature. How justified were the authorities in thus putting\r\na stop to this party could be seen when some of the Communist deputies\r\nwere interrogated, for either they were dangerous fanatics or else very\r\nignorant individuals, who knew no more about any other question than\r\nabout Communism, and had only been elected because they professed\r\ndissatisfaction with things in general. A few months later Mr.\r\nDra[vs]kovi['c], the very able Minister of the Interior, who had drawn\r\nup the Obznana, but who by that time had laid down the seals of office,\r\nwas murdered by Communists at a seaside resort in the presence of his\r\nwife and little children. The object of this particular outrage was to\r\npersuade the authorities in panic to withdraw the hated Obznana, whereas\r\nthe previous attempts on various personages seem to have been greatly\r\ndue to the desire to show some positive result in return for the cash\r\nwhich came to them from Moscow. (One of the leaders of the party, the\r\nex-professor of mathematics, was arrested last summer in Vienna on his\r\nreturn from Moscow, with a large and very miscellaneous collection of\r\nEnglish, French, American, Russian and other money.) After the murder of\r\nMr. Dra[vs]kovi['c] the mandates of the Communist deputies were\r\nsuppressed; seven or eight of them were detained, for speedy trial, and\r\nthe rest were told to go to their homes. The Communist parliamentary\r\nparty was at an end--it was established that their Committee room in the\r\nSkup[vs]tina had been used for highly improper purposes--but there was\r\nnothing to prevent these ex-deputies from being elected as members of\r\nany other party, and it was rather beside the mark for an English\r\nreview, the _Labour Monthly_,[51] to talk of the \"White Terror in\r\nJugo-Slavia,\" as if there prevailed in that country anything comparable\r\nwith Admiral Horthy's regime in Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER LIONS IN THE PATH\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Communists was far from being the only clog in\r\nYugoslavia's parliamentary machine. After the first General Election of\r\nNovember 1920--delayed until then on account of Italy's attitude, which\r\nmade it impossible to demobilize the army--no single party nor even one\r\nof the large groups was possessed of a real working majority. Fierce and\r\ndetermined was the Opposition;[52] to carry on the business of\r\ngovernment it became necessary to secure the coalition of several\r\nparties. The Radical and Democrat _bloc_ had to attract to its side one\r\nor two other parties, and it was truly difficult to make concessions to\r\nanyone of these without rousing the righteous or the envious wrath of\r\nanother group. In principle it was proper that the Bosnian Moslems\r\nshould receive compensation for their estates; the question is whether\r\nthe very large sum was less in the nature of a fair price than of a\r\nbribe. The Radical party was no longer under its happy triumvirate of\r\nPa[vs]i['c], the old diplomat, Proti['c], the executor of his ideas, and\r\nPatchou, a medical man from Novi Sad, the real brain of the party. We\r\nshall give an example of Patchou's prudence; the long views which he\r\npossessed may be illustrated by what occurred at a meeting of Radical\r\ndeputies two days before the outbreak of the second Balkan War. The\r\nTzar's proposed arbitration was being discussed and certain deputies,\r\nsuch as the late Dr. Pavlovi['c], who was the first speaker of the\r\nYugoslav Parliament after the Great War, raised their voices in\r\nopposition; they were supported by the army. \"Can we have Bitolje\r\n(Monastir)?\" they asked. \"It is not known what the Tzar will decide,\"\r\nsaid Pa[vs]i['c]. \"Then we can't accept arbitration,\" said Pavlovi['c].\r\nAnd Patchou spoke. \"I would be very glad to know,\" said he, \"what Mr.\r\nPavlovi['c] would say if we could get, by possibly now sacrificing\r\nBitolje, not only Bosnia, but Dalmatia and other Slav countries.\" \"All\r\nthat,\" said Pavlovi['c], \"is music of the future.\" \"For you perhaps,\"\r\nsaid Patchou, \"but not for us.\" And the vote in favour of arbitration\r\nwas carried. Patchou died in 1915 at Ni[vs]. Besides being an expert in\r\nfinance and foreign affairs he was less arbitrary in his methods than\r\nProti['c]. That very erudite man--no sooner does an important book\r\nappear in Western or Central Europe than a copy of it goes to his\r\nlibrary--has not been much endowed with patience. This brought him into\r\nconflict with his Democratic colleague Mr. Pribi[vc]evi['c], the most\r\nprominent man in that party. It would have been well if Dr.\r\nDavidovi['c], the gentle, tactful leader of the party, could have taken\r\ninto his own composition one-half of his lieutenant's excessive\r\ncombativeness. Pribi[vc]evi['c] and Proti['c] find it impossible to work\r\ntogether, and we can sympathize with both of them. One day at a more\r\nthan usually disagreeable Cabinet meeting Pribi[vc]evi['c] reminded the\r\nthen Prime Minister that he was the first among equals, a point of view\r\nwhich did not square with the methods of Proti['c], who gives his\r\nsupport to those Ministers who bend before him. And as Pribi[vc]evi['c]\r\nhas hitherto insisted on being in every Cabinet, Proti['c] has withdrawn\r\nand has started a newspaper, the _Radical_, in which he attacks him with\r\ngreat violence and ability. One charge which he brings against this Serb\r\nfrom Croatia is perfectly true, for he has succeeded in alienating the\r\nCroats. Only two or three Democrat deputies come from Croatia, and they\r\nare elected by the Serbs who live in that province. It would seem that\r\nthe Croats will remain in more or less active opposition so long as\r\nPribi[vc]evi['c], the arch-centralizer who scorns to wear the velvet\r\nglove, stays in the Government. There is also much doubt as to whether\r\nProti['c] can break down their particularism, which, of course, is not\r\nan anti-national movement. But luckily, through other men, it will be\r\nstayed. For other reasons one regrets that Mr. Proti['c] is not now in\r\npower; as the Finance Minister he knew how to introduce order,\r\npreferring the interests of the State to those of his party. Both\r\nRadicals and Democrats have been reluctant, for electoral purposes, to\r\ntax the farmer; and Mr. Proti['c] would probably have the courage to\r\nimpose a direct tax, as the Radicals did, without losing popular favour,\r\nin the old days. In this respect and concerning the numerous posts that\r\nhave been created for party reasons it is thought that Mr. Pa[vs]i['c]\r\nhas not displayed sufficient energy.\r\n\r\nThere was in Yugoslavia a heavy war deficit, both economic and\r\nfinancial. Communications were out of order and the State, owing to the\r\nadverse exchange (which was not justified by the economic potentialities\r\nof the country, but was probably caused by the unsettled conditions both\r\ninternal and external), the State could not obtain the necessary raw\r\nproducts for industrial undertakings such as iron-works, tanneries,\r\ncloth factories, etc. The Yugoslavs did not borrow from abroad, as they\r\nmight have done, in the form of raw materials. The agricultural products\r\nwhich were exported should have been sold for the needful manufacturers'\r\nmaterial and not for articles of luxury and not for depreciated foreign,\r\nespecially Austrian, currency.[53] The Yugoslav public is slow to learn\r\neconomy, that it should restrict the importation of luxuries. What makes\r\nit particularly unhappy, in which frame of mind it listens to the voices\r\nprophesying woe for Yugoslavia, is the knowledge that for increased\r\nproduction and for many other necessary aims more capital is wanted,\r\nwhereas under present conditions it has been difficult to borrow. But\r\nhappily in this respect the corner has been turned, and in the spring of\r\n1922 a considerable loan was negotiated with an American syndicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NADIR OF DEVINE AND NIKITA\r\n\r\nHowever, the principal disintegrating force in Yugoslavia, we were often\r\ntold in England, was Montenegro, where, it seems, the natives were\r\nyearning to cast off their yoke. The British devotees of the former king\r\ntold us of the ghastly state of Montenegro, and our Foreign Office was\r\nbombarded with reports which ascribed these evils to the wretched\r\nGovernment of Yugoslavia. \"There is nothing anywhere,\" says a memorandum\r\nfrom the ineffable Devine. \"The shops are empty, the town markets are\r\ndeserted. The peasants, who may not travel from one village to another\r\nwithout a Serbian 'permit' ... etc. etc.\" Well, I visited Cetinje market\r\non a non-market day, and passing through the crowd of people I admired\r\nthe produce of various parts of the country--melons, tomatoes, dried\r\nfish, onions, peaches, nuts and cheese, lemons from Antivari and so\r\nforth. I happened to ask a comely woman called Petrie[vc]evi['c] from\r\nnear Podgorica whether she had a permit; she looked surprised at such a\r\nquestion. It is very true that the more mountainous parts of Montenegro\r\nare far from prosperous, but to insinuate that this is the fault of the\r\nGovernment is childish. Hampered by the lack of transport--practically\r\neverything has to be brought on ox-carts up by the tremendous road from\r\nKotor--they have recently given away 38,000 kilos of wheat and many\r\nmountain horses at Cetinje. I suppose it was all in the game for Devine\r\nand his assistants to throw mud at the Yugoslav Government if they\r\nbelieved that they would--for the happiness of the Montenegrins and\r\nthemselves--help to restore Nikita. But what was the use of saying that\r\n\"the poor people have no money and have nothing to eat; they are said to\r\nbe living on a herb of some sort that grows wild in the mountains\"?... A\r\nvery satisfactory feature of the past year has been the migration of\r\n7000 Montenegrins to more fertile parts of Yugoslavia. And as for\r\nNikita's partisans, they were such small beer that when they wished to\r\nhold a meeting at Cetinje the Government had not the least objection; it\r\nalso allowed them to sing the songs that Nikita wrote, but that was more\r\nthan the population of Cetinje would stand. It is only at Cetinje, where\r\nhe reigned for sixty years, and at Njegu[vs], where he was born, that\r\nNikita has any adherents at all. As for his adherents at Gaeta, the\r\nCetinje authorities were perfectly willing to give a passport to any\r\nwoman who desired to spend some time in Italy with her husband or\r\nbrother or son. She might stay there or come back, just as she pleased.\r\nAnd very likely when she got to Gaeta she would relate how in the\r\ncathedral, at the rock-bound monastery of Ostrog, and in other sacred\r\nplaces, one could see the Montenegrin women cursing their ex-king.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GENERAL\r\n\r\nThe sinister shadow of d'Annunzio had fallen across Dalmatia and beyond\r\nit: for instance, on November 20, 1919, the King of Italy's name-day, a\r\ngeneral holiday was proclaimed in the occupied districts. The director\r\nof the school at Zlosela, a Slav who had never been an Italian subject,\r\ngave--perhaps injudiciously--the usual lessons. He and his wife were\r\narrested and for months they were in prison, their six-months-old child\r\nbeing left to the mercy of neighbours; and the local commandant, Major\r\nGracco Golini, told Dr. Smol[vc]i['c], the President of the National\r\nCouncil, that the slightest action on the part of the Yugoslavs would\r\nprovoke terrible measures on the part of d'Annunzio's arditi, who would\r\nspare neither women nor children.... The reader may remember the\r\nMontenegrin General Ve[vs]ovi['c], who took to the mountains and defied\r\nthe Austrians. On the accession of the Emperor Karl he surrendered and,\r\nmuch to the surprise of his people, he travelled round the country\r\nrecommending every one to offer no more opposition, to be quiet and\r\nobedient to the Austrians. When the war was over the authorities at\r\nBelgrade gave him, as they did to other Montenegrin generals, the same\r\nrank in the Yugoslav army; but the numerous Montenegrins who resented\r\nhis unpatriotic behaviour persuaded the War Office, after two or three\r\nmonths, to remove him from the active list. This exasperated the\r\nambitious man to such an extent that he withdrew to his own district and\r\nbegan to work against Yugoslavia. A major with a force of 200 gendarmes\r\nwas sent to fetch him back and, after conversations that lasted ten\r\ndays, induced him to return to Belgrade. There he was not molested; he\r\nused to sit for hours in the large cafe of the Hotel Moscow in civilian\r\nclothes. But one day a policeman at the harbour happened to observe him\r\ntalking for a long time to a fisherman; he wondered what the two might\r\nhave in common. When the fisherman was interrogated he refused at first\r\nto give any information, but he finally divulged that he had agreed, for\r\n1500 francs, to take the General down the Danube either to Bulgaria or\r\nRoumania. That evening at nine o'clock the General appeared, with his\r\nson and a servant; he was captured,[54] and among his documents were\r\nsome which proved, it was alleged, that he was in communication with\r\nd'Annunzio.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO COMIC PRO-ITALIANS IN OUR MIDST\r\n\r\nMonth follows month. The reading public and some of the statesmen of the\r\nworld begin to recognize that, whatever may be the case on other\r\nportions of the new map, there is nothing unreal or impossible or\r\nartificial about Yugoslavia. This State is the result of a national\r\nmovement, having its origins within and not without the peoples whose\r\ndestiny it affects. The various Yugoslavs, after being kept apart for\r\nall these centuries, have now--roughly speaking--come to that stage\r\nwhich the Germans reached in 1866. They cannot rest until they reach\r\nthe unity which came to the Germans after 1870. And here also, it seems,\r\nthe unity will not be gained without the sacrifice of thousands of young\r\nmen. \"Go, my son,\" said Oxenstiern the Swedish Chancellor, \"and observe\r\nby what imbeciles the world is governed.\" It is pitiable that the\r\nleaders of the nations, in declining month after month to give to\r\nYugoslavia an equitable frontier, should apparently have been more\r\nimpressed by the arguments of Mrs. Lucy Re-Bartlett[55] than by those of\r\nan anonymous philosopher in the _Edinburgh Review_.[56] \"Nationality?\"\r\nsays the lady, speaking of the country people of Dalmatia, \"nationality?\r\nThese people of the country districts--the great mass of the\r\npopulation--are far too primitive to have any sense of nationality as\r\nyet, but if some day they call themselves Italian....\" That is what she\r\nsays of a people which through centuries of persecution and neglect have\r\npreserved their language, their traditions, their hopes; a people which,\r\nmore than forty years ago, won their great victory against the Habsburg\r\nregime of Italian and Italianist officials, so that with one exception\r\nevery mayor in Dalmatia and all the Imperial deputies and hundreds of\r\nsocieties of all kinds, such as 375 rural savings-banks, were\r\nexclusively Yugoslav. Out of nearly 150,000 votes at the last general\r\nelection, which was held in 1911 on the basis of universal suffrage, the\r\nYugoslav candidates received about 145,000 against 5000 to 6000 for the\r\nItalians. It is indisputable that the Dalmatian peasants are backward in\r\nmany things, but one is really sorry for the person who declares in\r\nprint that they possess no sense of nationality. Let her visit any house\r\nof theirs on Christmas Eve and watch them celebrate the \"badnjak\"; let\r\nher listen any evening to their songs. Let her think whether there is no\r\nsense of nationality among the priests, who almost to a man are the sons\r\nof Yugoslav peasants. And let her recollect that these are the days when\r\nthe other Yugoslavs are at last uniting in their own free State. She has\r\nthe hardihood to tell us of the poor Dalmatians who were being bribed\r\nwith waterworks and bridges and gratuitous doctoring. I daresay that the\r\nlittle ragged Slav children of Kievo whom she saw clustering round the\r\nkindly Italian officer were glad enough to eat his chocolates,[57] but I\r\nthink that we others should pay more attention to those secret\r\nsocieties, the _[vc]etasis_ (which is Slav for komitadjis), who have\r\nsworn to liberate all Istria from the Italians. We may also consider the\r\nproposals made by the Southern Slavs whom Signor Salvemini, the\r\ndistinguished Professor of Modern History at Pisa, called \"extreme\r\nNationalists\" (see his letter of September 11, 1916, to the editor of\r\n_La Serbie_, which was being published in Switzerland). Well, it appears\r\nthat the \"extreme Southern Slav Nationalists,\" as the utmost of their\r\naspirations, claim the Southern Slav section of the province of Gorica\r\nwith the town Triest and the whole of Istria, that is to say, a\r\nterritory which, with a population the majority of whom are Slav,\r\ncontains also 284,325 Italians, whereas the smallest programme ever\r\nproposed by moderate Italians, including Professor Salvemini, covets\r\nsome 364,000 Southern Slavs. Thus the extreme Southern Slav elements, in\r\ntheir widest demands, are more moderate than the moderate Italians in\r\ntheir most limited programme. \"Without distinction of tribe or creed,\"\r\nsays that Edinburgh reviewer, \"all the Yugoslavs are waiting for their\r\n1870. This will fix and perpetuate their unity.... The preparation is\r\ngoing forward silently--almost sullenly--and without demur or\r\nqualification the Yugoslavs are accepting the Serb military chiefs'\r\nguidance and domination.\" He was much impressed by the silence and\r\ncontrolled power of the Serbian General Staff. There was in Europe a\r\ngeneral war-weariness; but not in Yugoslavia. There was a hush in this\r\npart of Europe, broken only by the shrill screams of Italian\r\npropagandists and outbursts of suppressed passion on the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELATED TREATY OF RAPALLO\r\n\r\nAnd the Rapallo Treaty of November 1920, when at last the statesmen of\r\nItaly and Yugoslavia came to terms regarding all their frontiers! This\r\nTreaty was received with much applause by the great majority of the\r\nFrench and British Press; in this country of compromise it was pointed\r\nout by many that as each party knew that the other had abated something\r\nof his desires the Treaty would probably remain in operation for a long\r\ntime to come. And column after column of smug comment was written in\r\nvarious newspapers by the \"Diplomatic Correspondent,\" whose knowledge of\r\ndiplomacy may have been greater than his acquaintance with the Adriatic,\r\nsince they followed one another, like a procession of sheep, in copying\r\nthe mistake in a telegram which spoke of Eritto, the curious suburb of\r\nZadar, instead of Borgo Erizzo. They noted that each side had yielded\r\nsomething, though it was true that the Yugoslavs had been the more\r\ngenerous in surrendering half a million of their compatriots, whereas\r\nthe Italians had given up Dalmatia, to which they never had any\r\nright.[58] \"The claim for Dalmatia was entirely unjustified,\" said\r\nSignor Colajanni in the Italian Chamber on November 23--yet it was not\r\nour business to weigh the profit and loss to the two interested parties.\r\nAfter all, it was they who had between themselves made this Agreement,\r\nand one might argue that it surely would be an impertinence if anybody\r\nelse was more royalist than the king. These commentators held that it\r\nwas inexpedient for anyone to ask why the Yugoslavs should now have\r\naccepted conditions that were, on the whole, considerably worse than\r\nthose which President Wilson, with the approval of Great Britain and\r\nFrance, had laid down as a minimum, if they were to realize their\r\nnational unity. And, of course, these writers deprecated any reference\r\nto the pressure which France and Great Britain brought to bear upon the\r\nYugoslavs when the negotiations at Rapallo were in danger of falling\r\nthrough. If we take two Scottish newspapers, the _Scotsman_[59] was\r\ntypical of this very bland attitude; it congratulated everyone on the\r\nharmonious close to a long, intricate and frequently dangerous\r\ncontroversy. The _Glasgow Herald_,[60] on the other hand, was one of the\r\nfew newspapers which took a more than superficial view. \"Monstrous,\" it\r\nsaid, \"as such intervention seems, no student of the Adriatic White\r\nPaper--as lamentable a collection of documents as British diplomacy has\r\nto show--can deny its possibility, nay its probability. It is precisely\r\nthe same game as was nearly successful in January 1920 and again in\r\nApril 1920, but both times was frustrated by Wilson. We are entitled to\r\nask, for the honour of our nation, if it has been played again; indeed\r\nif the whole mask of direct negotiation--a British suggestion--was not\r\ndevised at San Remo with the express purpose of making the game succeed.\r\nIf it be so--and if it is not so it is imperative that we are given\r\nfrankly the full story of British policy in the Adriatic, for instance\r\nthe dispatches so carefully omitted from the White Paper--then our\r\nforebodings for the future are more than justified.... It is\r\nemphatically a bad settlement.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not establish friendly and normal relations with our neighbour\r\nItaly unless we reduce all causes of friction to a minimum,\" said M.\r\nVesni['c], the Yugoslav Prime Minister, who during his long tenure of\r\nthe Paris Legation was an active member of the Academie des Inscriptions\r\net Belles-Lettres and other learned societies; he excelled in getting at\r\nthe root of the worst difficulties in international law, and he was\r\nparticularly admired for his ability to combine legal and historic\r\nknowledge. Because he studied history minutely--with a special fondness\r\nfor Gambetta who, racially an Italian, had something of the generous and\r\nsacred fervour that distinguished the leaders of the Risorgimento--M.\r\nVesni['c] could not bring himself to hate Italy, despite all that\r\nd'Annunzio and other Imperialists had made his countrymen suffer.\r\n\"Neither the Government nor the elected representatives of the Serbs,\r\nCroats and Slovenes,\" said he courageously in his first speech as Prime\r\nMinister, \"ought to look upon Italy as an enemy country. We have to\r\nsettle important and difficult questions with Italy.... We must reduce\r\nall causes of friction to a minimum.\"\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Rapallo gives Zadar to Italy, because in that little town\r\nthere is an Italian majority; but central and eastern Istria, with their\r\noverwhelming Slav majority, are not given to the Yugoslavs--a fact which\r\nProfessor Salvemini deplored in the Roman Chamber. By the Treaty of\r\nRapallo Rieka is given independence,[61] but with Italy in possession of\r\nIstria and the isle of Cres, she can at any moment choke the\r\nunprotected port, having very much the same grip of that place as\r\nHolland has for so long had of Antwerp; and the sole concession on\r\nItaly's part seems to be that in the south she gives up the large Slav\r\nislands of Hvar, Kor[vc]ula and Vis, and only appropriates the small one\r\nof Lastovo.... \"It has cost Italy a pang,\" says Mr. George Trevelyan,\r\n\"to consent, after victory, to leave the devoted and enthusiastic\r\nItalians of the Dalmatian coast towns (other than Zara) in foreign\r\nterritory.\" The truth is that henceforward Yugoslavia will contain some\r\n5000 Italians (many of whom are Italianized Slavs), as against not less\r\nthan 600,000 Slavs in Italy. And while the former are but tiny groups in\r\ntowns which even under Venetian rule were predominantly Slav and are\r\nsurrounded on all sides by purely Slav populations, the latter live for\r\nthe most part in compact masses and include roughly one-third of the\r\nwhole Slovene race, whose national sense is not only very acute, but who\r\nare also much less illiterate than their Italian neighbours. One cannot\r\nbe astonished if the Slovenes think of this more than of Giotto,\r\nLeonardo, Galileo and Dante. But one may be a little surprised that\r\nsuch a man as Mr. Edmund Gardner should allow his reverence for the\r\nimperishable glories of Italy to becloud his view of the modern world.\r\nIt is certainly a fact that the Slovenes are to-day less illiterate than\r\nthe Italians, but because Dr. Seton-Watson alludes to this, Mr. Gardner\r\n(in the _Manchester Guardian_, of February 13, 1921) deplores the\r\n\"Balkanic mentality that seems to afflict some Englishmen when dealing\r\nwith these problems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nITS PROBABLE FRUITS\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious that the Treaty of Rapallo has placed between the\r\nYugoslavs and the Italians all too many causes of friction. Zadar, like\r\nother such enclaves, will be dear to the heart of the smuggler. She\r\ncannot live without her Yugoslav hinterland--five miles away in\r\nYugoslavia are the waterworks, and if these were not included, by a\r\nspecial arrangement, in her dominion, she would have no other liquid but\r\nher maraschino. She cannot die without her Yugoslav hinterland--but so\r\nthat her inhabitants need not be carried out into a foreign land, the\r\ncemetery has also, by stretching a point, been included in the city\r\nboundaries. It remains to be seen how Zadar and the hinterland will\r\nserve two masters. We have alluded to the questionable arrangements at\r\nRieka, in which town there had for those years been such an orgy of\r\nlimelight and recrimination that even the most statesmanlike solution\r\nmust have left a good deal of potential friction. In Istria the dangers\r\nof an outbreak are evident. Italy has now become the absolute mistress\r\nof the Adriatic and has gained a strategical frontier which could hardly\r\nbe improved upon, while Yugoslavia has been placed in an economic\r\nposition of much difficulty. Sooner or later, if matters are left _in\r\nsitu_, trouble will arise. Perhaps an economic treaty between Italy and\r\nYugoslavia, as favourable as possible to the weaker State, would\r\nintroduce some sort of stability; but no good cause would be served by\r\ncrying \"Peace\" where there is no peace, and while Yugoslavia has a\r\ngrievance there will be trouble in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nThe most serious phase of the Adriatic crisis is now ushered in, for a\r\nnew Alsace has been created; and those who point this out cannot be\r\ncharged with an excessive leaning towards the Yugoslavs. It also seems\r\nto me that one can scarcely say they are alarmists. If Yugoslavia, in\r\ndefiance of that most immoral pressure, had declared for war, Vesni['c]\r\nat the general election would have swept the country with the cry of\r\n\"War for Istria!\" To his eternal honour he chose the harder path of\r\nloyalty to the new ideas which Serbian blood has shed so freely to make\r\nvictorious. A momentary victory has now been gained by the Italians, but\r\nnot one that makes for peace. It poisons by annexations fundamentally\r\nunjustifiable, however consecrated by treaty, the whole source of\r\ntranquillity in the Near East. \"Paciencia!\" [Have patience] you say, in\r\nrefusing to give alms to a Portuguese beggar, and he follows your\r\nadvice. But when the Yugoslavs ask for a revision of the Treaty--if the\r\nItalians do not wisely offer it themselves--it would be rash if in\r\nattempting to foretell the future we should base ourselves upon the\r\npremise that their patience will be everlasting. A new Alsace has been\r\ncreated, an Alsace to which, in the opinion of competent observers, all\r\nthe Yugoslavs will turn until the day comes when it is honourable to set\r\nthe standards forth on a campaign of liberation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW FORCES IN THE FIRST YUGOSLAV PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the Yugoslavs were at last in a position, late in 1920, to hold the\r\nelections for the Constituent Assembly the Radicals and the Democrats\r\nwere the most successful, but even if they made a Coalition they would\r\nstill have no majority. [Now and then the Democrats asserted themselves\r\nagainst the Radicals, but when the Opposition thought they could\r\nperceive a rift the Democratic Press would write that the two parties\r\nwere most intimately joined to one another, and especially the\r\nDemocrats.] The small parties were very numerous, the smallest being\r\nthat of M. Ribarac, the old Liberal leader, who found himself in the\r\nSkup[vs]tina with nobody to lead; the clericals of Slovenia came to\r\ngrief, a fact which appeared to give general satisfaction, and a similar\r\nmishap befell the decentralizing parties of Croatia. On the other hand\r\nthe Croat Peasants' party, whose decentralization ideas were more\r\nextreme, had a very considerable success, and the Communist party, whose\r\nfall we have already described, had come to the Skup[vs]tina with some\r\nfifty members.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) MARKOVI['C] THE COMMUNIST\r\n\r\nThe temporary triumph of the Communists was admittedly due to the\r\nexceptional position in which the country found itself. They had in Sima\r\nMarkovi['c] an enthusiastic leader who has abandoned the teaching of\r\nmathematics in order to expound the gospel of Moscow, and in the\r\nSkup[vs]tina the shrill, voice of this kindly, bald-headed little man\r\nhad to be raised to its uttermost capacity, for most of his\r\nfellow-members were unwilling to be taught. It so happens that he is\r\nPa[vs]i['c]'s godson, and on one occasion when the little Communist was\r\ntalking with great vehemence the old gentleman, who was turning over the\r\npages of some document, was heard by an appreciative House to murmur:\r\n\"Oh, be still, my child, be still!\" But the most unfortunate episode in\r\nMarkovi['c]'s oratory was when he expressed the hope that Communism\r\nwould rage through the country like an epidemic, forgetting for the\r\nmoment that those municipalities which had gone over to Communism had\r\nwon general praise for their improvements in the sanitary sphere.\r\nLargely on account of this infelicitous simile he was replaced in the\r\nleadership by another, a less vigorous and less entertaining person. And\r\nthis party stood in particular need of attractive champions.\r\n\r\nThe Croat Peasants' party, or the Radi['c] party, as it came to be\r\ncalled, gave to its beloved chief more than half the seats in Croatia,\r\nforty-nine out of ninety-three; and the whole party refused to go to\r\nBelgrade.\r\n\r\n\"Would it not have been better,\" I asked him, \"if you had gone? The\r\nConstitution will be settled without you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) RADI['C], THE MUCH-DISCUSSED\r\n\r\n\"We had various reasons,\" said he, \"for not going. One of them was that\r\nthe Assembly which laid down the Constitution was not sovereign. For\r\nexample, it was not permitted to discuss whether Yugoslavia should be a\r\nmonarchy or a republic. I admit that three-quarters of the members would\r\nvery likely have voted for a monarchy, and in that case we should have\r\naccepted the situation very much as do the royalist deputies in the\r\nFrench Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are your own views on this subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"for this period of transition I believe--mark you,\r\nthis only applies to myself--that a monarchy is not merely acceptable\r\nbut preferable. On the other hand the Croat peasant was so badly treated\r\nby the Habsburgs that he will now hear of nothing but a republic.\"\r\n\r\nI ventured to say that this sudden conversion to republican ideas in one\r\nwho for centuries had lived in a monarchy was peculiar, and Radi['c]\r\nacknowledged that when the first republican cries were raised at a\r\nmeeting of the Peasants' party on July 25, 1918 they came to him as a\r\nrevelation, one which he accepted.\r\n\r\n\"You don't accept everything that your peasants shout for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" said he. \"There was a gentleman who asked them at a meeting\r\nwhether they would kill him if he, elected as their representative, were\r\nto go to Belgrade. They shouted back that they would do so. And when the\r\nprospective candidate came to tell me this story, thinking that I would\r\nbe delighted, I told him that a ship's captain cannot have his hands\r\nbound before undertaking a voyage and he must therefore withdraw his\r\ncandidature.... When the time comes we will go to Belgrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those who say that you are longing for the return of the\r\nHabsburgs?\"\r\n\r\nHe gripped my arm. \"They are fools,\" said he. \"We are looking forward as\r\neagerly as the great Bishop Strossmayer to the union of the Southern\r\nSlavs. According to the spirit of his time he began at the top, with\r\nacademies, picture galleries and so forth. We prefer to begin with\r\nelementary schools.\" And bubbling with enthusiasm he told me of the\r\nefforts his party was making. It was plain to see that what lies nearest\r\nto his heart is to improve their social and economic status. And those\r\nobservers are probably in the right, who believe that he merely uses\r\nthis republican cry as a weapon which he will conveniently drop when it\r\nhas served its purpose.\r\n\r\n\"If only Yugoslavia had a great statesman,\" said I, \"who would weld the\r\nnew State together, so that the Croats remain with the Serbs not alone\r\nfor the reasons that they are both Southern Slavs and that they are\r\nsurrounded by not over-friendly neighbours. The great statesman--perhaps\r\nit will be Pa[vs]i['c]--will make you all happy to come together.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the bottom of my heart I hope he will succeed,\" said Radi['c],\r\n\"and he will be remembered as our second and more fortunate\r\nStrossmayer.\"\r\n\r\nWe generally imagine that the statesmen of South-Eastern Europe are a\r\ncollection of rather swarthy, frock-coated personages who, when not\r\nengaged in decrying each other, are very busily occupied in feathering\r\ntheir own nests. If any one of them, at the outset of his career, had a\r\nsense of humour we suppose that in this heated atmosphere it must have\r\nlong ago evaporated. But strangely enough, the two most prominent\r\npoliticians in Yugoslavia, the venerable Pa[vs]i['c], the Prime Minister\r\nof this new State of Serbs and Croats and Slovenes, even as he used for\r\nyears to be the autocrat of Serbia, and his opponent Stephen Radi['c]\r\nare, both of them, by the grace of God, of a humorous disposition.\r\nOutwardly, there is not much resemblance between them: Pa[vs]i['c], the\r\npicture of a benevolent patriarch, letting fall in his deep voice a few\r\ncasual words which bring down his critics' case, hopelessly down like a\r\nwounded aeroplane, and Radi['c] the fervid little orator, the learned\r\nman, whose life has been devoted to the Croat peasants and who is said\r\nto find it difficult to make a speech that is under eight hours in\r\nlength. Last year when the vigorous Pribi[vc]evi['c], then Minister of\r\nthe Interior, who is determined to compel the Serbs and the Croats\r\nstraightway to live in the closest companionship, whereas Radi['c],\r\nsupported by most of the Croat _intelligentsia_, argues that in view of\r\ntheir very different culture, the Serbs having enjoyed a Byzantine and\r\nthe Croats an Austrian education, it would be advisable for these two\r\nbranches of the South Slav nation to come gradually and not violently\r\ntogether,--last year when Radi['c] was lying in prison on account of his\r\nsubversive ideas Pribi[vc]evi['c] sent a message to say that he was\r\nprepared to adopt half his programme. And Radi['c] sent back word\r\nregretting that the Minister could not adopt the whole of it and thus\r\nobtain for himself the Peasants' party. It is wrong to assert that this\r\nparty is unpatriotic; the enemies of Yugoslavia, who welcome in Radi['c]\r\na disruptive element, are totally in error. Years ago he was working for\r\nthe eventual union of Serbs and Croats--the Austrians imprisoned him\r\nbecause in 1903 he went to Belgrade at the accession of King Peter and\r\nmade an admirable speech to this effect--and his present attitude is due\r\nto the impatient manner in which Mr. Pribi[vc]evi['c] and his friends\r\nare endeavouring to bring the union about. His peasants are a\r\nconservative people; they cannot instantly dispel the anti-Serb ideas\r\nwhich the Austrians for ever inculcated, nor the negative anti-Serb\r\nframe of mind which they learned from their own _intelligentsia_. It\r\nwill take a little time before the Catholic peasant realizes that the\r\nOrthodox Serb is his brother and that now his military service will not\r\nbe in an alien army, but in his own. \"Let us go slowly,\" says Radi['c],\r\n\"with our peasants\"; and he knows them very well.... One is told that he\r\nchanges his opinions from hour to hour; he is certainly very impetuous,\r\nvery much under the influence of his emotions; but in one thing he has\r\nnever varied--he has always struggled for the Croat peasant, and he has\r\nbeen rewarded by the unbounded devotion of that faithful, rather\r\nincoherent, creature.\r\n\r\nNow the Serbs are a democratic people; they are by their nature in\r\nopposition to any force, civil or military, which might attempt to make\r\nthe monarchy more absolute. The wisest Serbs do not forget that in the\r\npeasant lies their principal wealth, and although as yet the Serbian\r\nPeasants' party does not hold many constituencies in the old kingdom,\r\nnevertheless it appears to have a brighter prospect than any other\r\nSerbian party, for in that country the revolt against the\r\nlawyer-politician is likely to be more efficacious than in France or\r\nEngland. One may look forward to an understanding between Radi['c] and\r\nthis Serbian party, which is only two or three years old, although its\r\nfounder, the excellent Avramovi['c]--an elderly gentleman who sits\r\nbehind vast barricades of books in various languages--has devoted\r\nhimself for many years to agrarian co-operative societies, of which in\r\nSerbia there are more than 1500.\r\n\r\nThe most uncertain factors seem to be the moderating hold of Radi['c]\r\nover his peasants and over himself. No one doubts but that he has the\r\ninterests of the peasant very much at heart, and if he succeeds in\r\nimproving the peasant's lot then that grateful giant will presumably not\r\nsink again into the sleep which he enjoyed when he was under the\r\nHabsburgs. The circulation of Radi['c]'s weekly paper _Dom_[62] (\"The\r\nHome\") has risen from 2000 before the elections and 9000 during the\r\nelections to 30,000. One enterprising vendor, a Serb from the Banat,\r\ntakes 500 copies a week and tramps over the countryside, disposing of\r\nhis wares either for cash or for eggs, the latter of which he sells at\r\nthe end of the week to a Zagreb hotel. The peasant is making great\r\nefforts to raise himself--a case has recently been brought to light of a\r\nfarmer in Zagorija who, as a hobby, has taught more than 700 persons to\r\nread and write. The peasant perceives that he has been assisted far less\r\nby the Catholic Church than by the work of Radi['c]. It is not unfair to\r\nsay that the Church desired, above all things, to keep the peasant\r\nunder her control. If a parish priest was disliked by his flock, so a\r\nprominent Croatian priest tells me, that was all the more reason why the\r\nBishop refused to remove him. And the clergy, except for an enlightened\r\nminority, have been very much opposed to Radi['c]'s policy of\r\ndemocratizing the Church.... In return for his unceasing labours he has\r\nnow secured the peasant's love and confidence. He will retain them if he\r\nsatisfies his client, and it seems to be within his power--gaining for\r\nhim a better position and dissuading him from fantastic demands. He can\r\nbe of immense assistance in the task of building up the State. But will\r\nthe brilliant flame within him burn with steadiness? Has he got\r\nsufficient strength of will? With all his qualities of heart and brain\r\nhe has not managed to discard his zig-zag impetuosity. The peasants, who\r\nrecognize his talents, ask him to captain the ship; but he runs down too\r\noften into his cabin and leaves the unskilled sailors on the bridge.\r\nDown in the cabin he is feverishly and with great skill writing a\r\ncontradiction of a pronouncement he made yesterday.\r\n\r\nThose who are openly sailing in Radi['c]'s boat are for the most part\r\nthe hard-headed peasants. Yet a number of the _intelligentsia_ are\r\ncoming on board--some of them, no doubt, with a view to their own\r\nadvancement, but others on account of their convictions. And a still\r\ngreater number of the Croat _intelligentsia_ look on him with\r\nsympathy--municipal officials, barristers, doctors, merchants,\r\nschoolmasters and military officers. It is most foolish to pretend that\r\nall these people are thinking regretfully of the old Habsburg days--they\r\nare, in the vast majority, sincere and loyal Yugoslavs who have certain\r\ngrievances. They do not believe that Croatia has fared very well since\r\nthe institution of the new State and it would seem wise to give them as\r\nmuch autonomy as is consonant with the interests of the whole country,\r\nfor then they will only have themselves to blame if there is no\r\nimprovement. Maybe they are unduly sensitive, but they were for many\r\nyears in political warfare with the Magyars and this should be taken\r\ninto consideration. Even if all the grievances are based on\r\nmisconceptions, on the difficulties of the moment, on the circumstances\r\nof the fading past--the new generation of Croats, say their teachers,\r\nare growing up to be excellent Yugoslavs--yet an effort should be made\r\nto sweep them away.\r\n\r\nWhen Belgrade makes a statesmanlike gesture then Radi['c] will probably\r\nbe able to persuade the peasants to abandon their republican\r\nslogan--both they and the _intelligentsia_ will abandon their reserved\r\nattitude towards the Government which they were far from entertaining\r\nwhen the State was first established. It seems as if the role of\r\nconciliator may well be filled by that wise old man, Nicholas\r\nPa[vs]i['c], who is now no longer a mere Balkan Premier. When he was\r\nthat he very properly used Balkan methods, despite the stern remarks of\r\na few Western critics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SERBS AND THE CROATS\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to the relations between Serbs and Croats. This is a\r\nsubject of such importance that it will be well to consider it more\r\nfully. When Yugoslavia sprang into existence at the end of the War--70\r\nper cent. of this State having previously been under the rule of the\r\nHouse of Habsburg--it was met in various quarters with a grudging\r\nwelcome. Soon, we were told, it would dissolve again, and every symptom\r\nof internal discontent was treated as a proof of this. On the other hand\r\nthere were those who told us that the Southern Slavs, having come\r\ntogether after all these hundreds of years, were tightly clasped in each\r\nothers' arms and that all reports to the contrary came from very\r\ninterested parties.\r\n\r\nLittle was said of the Slovenes; their language, as we have mentioned,\r\nis not the same as that spoken by Serbs and Croats, and--what is of\r\nstill greater importance--they have Slovenia to themselves. If Croatia\r\nwere equally immune from Serbs, then by this time the Southern Slavs\r\nwould be a more united nation. Those people were wrong who fancied that\r\nthe presence of the Serbs in Croatia--they form between one-fourth and\r\none-third of the population--would be of service in welding together the\r\nnew State. They forgot that for many years the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment had in Croatia played off the Roman Catholic Croats against\r\nthe Orthodox Serbs. The two Slav brothers were incited to mutual hatred,\r\nand though such a propaganda would naturally have more effect among the\r\nuneducated classes, yet all too often the _intelligentsia_ responded to\r\nthese machinations. More favour, of course, was shown to the Croats,\r\nwhose obedience could largely be secured by means of the Church, whereas\r\nno similar pressure could be brought to bear upon the Orthodox Serbs.\r\nEven if the Government approached the Orthodox clergy, these latter had\r\nonly a very moderate control over their flock. A Serb is always ready to\r\nsubscribe towards the erection of a new church, which he regards as most\r\nother nations regard their flag; but when it is built he rarely enters\r\nit. This being so, the Austro-Hungarian Government tyrannized over the\r\nSerbs in Croatia by measures taken against their schools, the Cyrillic\r\nalphabet and so forth. It was natural that the suffering Serbs were apt\r\nto compare these restrictions with those that were imposed upon the\r\nCroats. However, among the _intelligentsia_ an effort--a fairly\r\nsuccessful effort--was made to nullify this dividing policy; the\r\nSerbo-Croat Coalition was formed, one of the protagonists being Svetozar\r\nPribi[vc]evi['c], that very energetic Serb of Croatia, and in 1906 this\r\nparty obtained no less than sixty-eight seats, while the power of the\r\nolder Croat parties was correspondingly diminished and Radi['c] had his\r\nvery small following in the Zagreb Lantag. [Those who represented\r\nCroatia in the central Parliament at Buda-Pest were chosen by the Ban,\r\nKhuen-Hedervary. Those forty members had practically no acquaintance\r\nwith the Magyar language, so that some of them drew their 8000 annual\r\ncrowns and only went to Pest if an important division was expected,\r\nothers who spent more time in the capital wasted their lives amid\r\nsurroundings just as riotous as and more expensive than the Parliament,\r\nwhile only those did useful work who managed to confer, behind the\r\nscenes, with the authorities. To some extent this was done by\r\nPribi[vc]evi['c] and to a greater extent by another Serb, Dr. Du[vs]an\r\nPopovi['c], who surpassed him in capacity and geniality. It was he, by\r\nthe way, who demonstrated in the Buda-Pest Parliament that if the\r\naverage Croat deputy was ignorant of the Magyar language, there was a\r\ngreater ignorance of Serbo-Croatian on the part of the Magyars. One day\r\nwhen he had started on a speech in his native tongue he was howled down\r\nafter he had explained that he was talking Serbian. He promised to\r\ncontinue in Croatian, and did so without being interrupted.]\r\n\r\nAt Zagreb the fusion of the Croat and Serb _intelligentsia_ was still\r\nvery incomplete at the outbreak of the War--the Croat Star[vc]evist\r\nparty and others going their own way. During the War the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government ruled by means of the Coalition party; but\r\nthe latter had no choice, and throughout Croatia they were never charged\r\nwith infidelity to the Slav cause. They did whatever their delicate\r\nsituation permitted; and in October 1918, when the Slavs of Croatia and\r\nSlovenia threw off the yoke of centuries and joined with the Serbs of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, one hoped that the simultaneous arrival in\r\nBelgrade of the Coalition and the Star[vc]evist leaders heralded in\r\nCroatia a cessation of the ancient hostility. Pribi[vc]evi['c] became\r\nMinister of the Interior in the new State, and very soon it was obvious\r\nthat he meant to govern in a centralizing fashion, despite his earlier\r\nassurance that no such steps would be taken without the sanction of the\r\nConstituent Assembly. No doubt his motives were unimpeachable; he feared\r\nlest the negative, anti-Serb mentality, which for so long had flourished\r\namong the Croats, would not, except by drastic methods, be removed. He\r\nwas met with opposition. Now you see, he cried, there are still in\r\nCroatia a number of disloyal Slavs, great landowners, Catholic clergy\r\nand others whom the Habsburgs used to favour. And he continued, with\r\nhundreds of edicts, to try to weld the State together. Consumed with\r\npatriotism, his great black eyes on flame amid the pallor of his\r\nface--his luminous and martyred face, to use the expression of his\r\nfriends--he never for a moment relaxed his efforts; if those who opposed\r\nhim were numerous it was all the more reason why he must be resolute.\r\nThe role fitted him very well, for he is the dourest politician in\r\nYugoslavia--a perfectly honest, upright, injudicious patriot. His\r\nDemocratic party had now taken the place of the Serbo-Croat Coalition\r\nand it saw the other parties in Croatia gradually drifting back again\r\nfrom it or rather from the dominating man; if his place had been\r\noccupied by his afore-mentioned colleague, the burly and beloved\r\nDu[vs]an Popovi['c], there would have been in Zagreb a very much suaver\r\natmosphere. But unfortunately Popovi['c] is a wealthy man, a highly\r\nsuccessful lawyer who cares little for the tumult of politics.... It was\r\na thorny problem, whether the State should be constituted on a federal\r\nor a centralized basis.[63] The federation of the United States depends\r\non the centralization of political parties, whereas in Yugoslavia the\r\nparties have only just begun to combine. Feudalism in the German Empire\r\nrested on the predominance of Prussia, a position which the Serbs are,\r\nunder present conditions, loth to occupy in Yugoslavia. In Germany,\r\nmoreover, many of the States used to be independent, while in Yugoslavia\r\nthis was only the case with Serbia and Montenegro. Centralism would tend\r\nto obliterate the tribal divisions, but on the other hand it brings in\r\nits train bureaucracy, which is slow, cumbrous and often corrupt; it\r\ndemands unusually good central institutions and first-rate\r\ncommunications, neither of which are as yet in a satisfactory state. The\r\nconstitution has arrived at a compromise between the federal and the\r\ncentralized systems. A writer in the _Contemporary Review_ (November\r\n1921) said that the division of the whole of Yugoslavia into some\r\ntwenty administrative areas [he should have said thirty-three] to\r\nreplace the racial areas, was a very drastic proposal to put forward;\r\nand he added that when the historic provincial divisions of France were\r\nbroken up into departments, the nation had been prepared by nearly 200\r\nyears of centralization under the monarchy. It is a flaw in his argument\r\nto say that the previously existing areas were racial, whereas\r\npopulations of identical race were divided from one another by the\r\ncourse of events. And in the proposed obliteration of these\r\ndivisions--to be effected in a less arbitrary fashion than in France,\r\nwhere no account was taken of the former provinces--it can scarcely be\r\nmaintained that, of itself, this part of the centralizing programme in\r\nYugoslavia is so very drastic.\r\n\r\nWhatever one may think about the Balkan peoples it is a fact that the\r\nessential Serb, the Serb from [vS]umadia, is a pacific person, rather\r\nlazy perhaps, but certainly more devoted to dancing than to battle. And\r\nsome of the wiser Serbs were dubious in 1919 and 1920 as to whether the\r\nmost sagacious methods were being employed in Croatia. Radi['c] was in\r\nprison, but they were told that this impetuous demagogue was insisting\r\non a republic, and the Croat _intelligentsia_ were far from happy. It is\r\ntrue that in the elections of November 1920 the National party, as the\r\nStar[vc]evists now called themselves, had no great success; but the\r\nRadi['c] party had more than half the seats. Surely this had not been\r\nbrought about merely by the chief's imprisonment? There seemed to be in\r\nthat province some wider, some growing dissatisfaction. And in the\r\nspring of 1921 most of the Catholic Croats, those within and those\r\nwithout the Radi['c] party, were nourishing a score of grievances. No\r\ndoubt a large proportion of these were unavoidable (in view of the state\r\nof Central Europe) or were rather trivial (the mayor of an important\r\ntown told me that he, who was under the Minister of the Interior, had\r\nreceived an order from the Belgrade Minister of War, with respect to the\r\ndetention of deserters--conditions, said he, were not so primitive in\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian monarchy) and sometimes the grievances were against\r\nthe Habsburgs (for not having made them more fit to assume these new\r\nresponsibilities), and sometimes they were against the Serbs for being\r\nless civilized--though they might be more moral--than themselves, and\r\nsometimes the grievances were personal: now and then after the Austrian\r\ncollapse a Serbian officer or his men, uncertain of the feelings of the\r\npopulation, had acted with unwise, or rather with inexpedient,\r\nvigour--instead of shooting those who in the general anarchy were laying\r\nwaste and plundering, they merely flogged them, and this was for a long\r\ntime remembered against them, although the Croat _intelligentsia_ who\r\nhad taken service in the police flogged in a far more wholesale fashion.\r\nBut down at the bottom of all the grievances there is the fundamental\r\nfact that the Southern Slavs yearn to be comrades, to shake off the\r\ndifferences which in the course of ages have grown up between them.\r\nThese fraternal sentiments may be crudely expressed--it has happened\r\nthat a Slav from Bosnia (whose ancestors adopted Islam some centuries\r\nago) finds himself in a Serbian village. He strikes up acquaintance with\r\nsome native. \"What is your name?\" asks the latter. \"Muhammed.\" The Serb\r\nhas never heard of such a name; he is puzzled. \"Well, never mind,\" says\r\nhe, and takes his new friend back to dinner. They sit down to the\r\nsucking pig. Muhammed refuses to partake of it, and informs the Serb\r\nthat Allah would be angry. \"Don't be afraid,\" says the Serb; \"I'll tell\r\nhim that it's my fault,\" and after a time he overcomes the Bosniak's\r\nscruples.... In more cultured circles the wonderful union of the\r\nSouthern Slavs is manifested after a different fashion, and those\r\nneighbours who imagine that the afore-mentioned grievances are going to\r\ndissolve the new State will one day see how much they are mistaken. The\r\nSouthern Slavs intend to quarrel with each other, to quarrel like\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAD CASE OF PRIBI[vC]EVI['C]\r\n\r\nAs between the Catholic and the Orthodox in Croatia the sole uncertainty\r\nis whether this fusion will shortly take place or after an interval. It\r\nis agreed by the most malcontent schoolmasters that their pupils are\r\ngrowing up to be excellent Yugoslavs who will have no more fear of what\r\nthey call \"Serb hegemony\" than have the Scots of that of England. As for\r\nthe present generation of Croats and Serbs, if they were Occidentals\r\nthey would be old enough to laugh at each others' peculiarities and each\r\nothers' statesmen. But South-Eastern Europe is still under the morning\r\nclouds, and they are inclined to take seriously what we in the West make\r\nfun of. However, there is one man whose presence in the Cabinet the\r\nCroats cannot be expected to regard with good-humour or with\r\nnonchalance. The reconciliation of Croatia will be much more easily\r\neffected if Mr. Pribi[vc]evi['c] resigns. His merits as a demagogue and\r\npolitical writer are undeniable. He would make an excellent Whip. But he\r\nprefers to be a Minister, and most unfortunately he is not a statesman.\r\nA zealous patriot, he is as yet unable to conceive that the business of\r\nthe State could be more successfully managed without him. The sweets of\r\noffice appear, if anything, to have made him more bitter; and even among\r\nthe Serbs of the old kingdom his withdrawal is considered advisable. A\r\nfriend of his has told me that in the middle of a laughing conversation\r\nhe threw out a hint of this, and like a cloud blown suddenly across a\r\nsummer sky, Pribi[vc]evi['c]'s face grew black. Unhappily he is not even\r\nFortinbras and yet imagines he is Hamlet. A good many people in\r\nYugoslavia call him _un homme fatal_, most of the others _l'homme\r\nfatal_. It is said that in the Democratic party he is actively supported\r\nby not more than ten deputies, but that the others, to preserve the\r\nparty, take no steps. He himself, however, would probably have not the\r\nleast hesitation in choosing another party, if he could otherwise not\r\nstay in the Cabinet; for his permanence in office is the one idea that\r\ncrushes every other from his mind. If he cannot be Minister of the\r\nInterior--a post from which he has been more than once, and happily for\r\nYugoslavia, ejected--then he insists on being Minister of Education.\r\nWhat are his qualifications? Years ago he gave instruction at a school\r\nfor elementary teachers, and so faint a conception has he of the\r\neducational needs of his country that one day when a Professor of\r\nBelgrade University asked him if no steps could be taken to diminish the\r\nprohibitive cost of books, especially foreign books, the Minister\r\nsimply stared at him as if he had been talking Chinese. And yet in a\r\nrecent book of national verses, published by his brother Adam, we are\r\ntold that:\r\n\r\n    \"At the table also sat the sage Pribi[vc]evi['c],\r\n    Who can converse with Emperors....\"\r\n\r\nThere are some who, curiously, have compared Radi['c]'s party with the\r\nSinn Feiners; Radi['c] may have announced that he would approach the\r\nSerbs as the representative of an independent country, but he never\r\nproposed, even when his views were most extreme, to realize them with\r\nphysical force. At a great open-air meeting of his adherents the\r\nspeeches were so mild that only twice did the Chief of Police, who was\r\nnext to me, raise a warning finger, and on each occasion to keep the\r\norator from very innocent digressions. Nevertheless, there is no\r\nconcealing the fact that even in these unsatisfactory times--\"It seems\r\nto me,\" said a philosophic peasant recently at Valjevo, in the heart of\r\nSerbia, \"it seems to me that if we had a plebiscite then Valjevo might\r\nnot wish to remain with Serbia!\"--even in a world that is so awry the\r\nCroats are more reserved towards the union than is good for the State.\r\nPerhaps they would cherish fewer grievances if they had gained their\r\nfreedom with greater difficulty; and surely they need have no more\r\nuneasiness than have the Scots that their name and nationality will be\r\nswamped, for what the Magyars were unable to do, that the Serbs do not\r\nwish to do. There are among the Serbs a few extremists, such as a\r\npernicious editor or two, but their anti-Croat tirades find extremely\r\nlittle favour anywhere. Last autumn when the Prince-Regent (now King\r\nAlexander) visited the Croat capital his reception was most\r\nenthusiastic. \"Let us keep him here!\" cried the people, \"and let King\r\nPeter stay in Belgrade!\" The Prince by his tact brought the Croat out of\r\nhis tent; he must not be allowed to go back again--let the Southern\r\nSlavs observe what each of their provinces can bring towards the common\r\ngood. The Croats acknowledge that the military system of Serbia is more\r\nendurable--only one son is taken out of each family--and that whereas in\r\nSlovenia a lawsuit can be settled in fourteen days it has been wont in\r\nCroatia to take as many years. Unfortunately human nature, in Serbia,\r\nCroatia and everywhere else, finds that the bad points of other people\r\nare more worthy of comment than the good. When two brothers have been\r\nbrought up in very different circumstances there will be so many points\r\non which they differ; and when a Serb taking part in a technical\r\ndiscussion of scientists wishes to say that he differs from the previous\r\nspeaker he will commonly observe that that person has made a fool of\r\nhimself. When an editor alludes to a political opponent he may call him\r\nan assassin and be much astonished if this is resented. \"Je suis un\r\nours,\" said a Serbian savant of European repute; occasionally he behaves\r\nlike one and is rather proud of it. The Serbs of Croatia have been\r\nimitating, nay exaggerating, the emphatic manners of their countrymen in\r\nthe old kingdom. And Pribi[vc]evi['c], as Minister of Education, has not\r\nattempted to give the Croats a tactful course in courage, patriotism and\r\nmorality, where they have much to learn from the less civilized Serbs,\r\nbut scowling at them he has made up his mind that, in and out of school,\r\nthey must straightway be the closest of companions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Serbs and Croats have a man whose counsel is more worthy of\r\nattention. Dr. Trumbi['c], formerly the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had\r\nbeen elected at the head of four different lists in his native Dalmatia\r\nbut had entered the Constituent Assembly without giving his allegiance\r\nto any party. And in April 1921 he made a speech as memorable as it was\r\nlong, for it occupied the whole of one sitting and was continued the\r\nnext day. Careless of the applause and the antagonism which he excited,\r\nthe serene orator pointed out that the conflict between Serbs and Croats\r\nwas based on their different psychology. Croatia had had her independent\r\nlife and must be considered as a factor in Yugoslavia; but having come\r\nin, like Montenegro, of her own accord, she had not wished to be a\r\nseparate factor. Traditions should not be so lightly set aside; and\r\nwhile there was perhaps no people more homogeneous than the Yugoslavs it\r\nshould be remembered that none was more ready to resist the application\r\nof force.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS OF THE MONTENEGRIN ELECTIONS\r\n\r\nExcept at Kola[vs]in, where a few friends of Nikita tried their brigand\r\ntactics, there was perfect calm in Montenegro during the elections. As\r\nelsewhere in Yugoslavia, there was a general amnesty and a prohibition,\r\nfor the three preceding days, to sell wine or rakia. The ten elected\r\ncandidates, all of them for the Yugoslav union and against Nikita, were\r\nequally divided between Radicals and Democrats on the one hand and\r\nCommunists and Republicans on the other. The authorities took not the\r\nslightest step to favour any candidate; various prominent deputies, such\r\nas Dr. Yoyi['c], the Minister of Food Supply, were beaten. And in a\r\nletter to the Press we were told by Mr. Ronald M'Neill, M.P., that these\r\nelections were certainly both \"farcical and fraudulent.\" He is\r\ncontradicted by Mr. Roland Bryce, who, after his excellent work on the\r\nAllied Plebiscite Commission in Carinthia, was sent by the Foreign\r\nOffice with Major L. E. Ottley to report on the Montenegrin elections.\r\nHe says (in Command Paper I., 124) that \"in actual practice the method\r\nof voting prescribed by the electoral law was found to ensure absolute\r\nsecrecy (the system adopted being the only feasible one in a country\r\nwhere the proportion of illiterates is great), and the manner in which\r\nthe ballot was supervised and carried out was unimpeachable and proof\r\nagainst the most exacting criticism.\" Mr. M'Neill is also contradicted\r\nby the Republican candidate, M. Gjonovi['c], who in a manifesto drawn up\r\nafter the election declares that \"none can say that the elections were\r\nnot free, or that anyone who wished could not make up a list. At the\r\nelections only the lists and boxes of the Republicans, Democrats,\r\nIndependents, Radicals and Communists were represented. All of these\r\nparties had in their programmes the motto 'The people and State union,'\r\nwith, of course, different points of view and different opinions as to\r\nthe organization of our national and State forces, except the\r\nCommunists, who go further and desire the union of all peoples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH ONE GENTLEMAN REFUSES TO TAKE\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the friends of Nikita were altogether wrong in\r\nsuggesting that those who voted for the Republicans or Communists were\r\nopposed to the union with Serbia in Yugoslavia. Both Republicans and\r\n(paradoxical though it sounds) the Communists resented this insinuation\r\nvery bitterly; and considering that the leaders of both parties are\r\npronounced antagonists of the old regime, and were indeed severally\r\ncondemned to death by Nikita, it would have been strange if they now\r\nsupported him. Thus every single programme put forward by the different\r\nparties included, in some form or other, union with Serbia. The\r\ncandidates themselves explicitly said so; but Mr. M'Neill knows better,\r\nand informs us how very hostile to the Serbs they really were. He is a\r\nwonderful man, Mr. M'Neill. Standing up in the House of Commons he\r\ndirects his penetrating gaze upon the Black Mountain, and with such\r\neffect that he can see in the minds of Montenegrin politicians what they\r\nthemselves had never dreamed of. Since we have such a man as Mr. M'Neill\r\nin the country, one would think that the Foreign Office might have saved\r\nitself the expense of sending out Mr. Bryce and Major Ottley.\r\n\r\nBut since we have it, let us look at Mr. Bryce's very interesting and\r\ndetailed report. After explaining that both Republicans and Communists\r\nwere in favour of union with Serbia, he tells us how it happened that so\r\nmany people voted for these two lists instead of for the orthodox\r\nRadical and Democratic parties. The Communists, according to Mr. Bryce,\r\nwere benefited by a party organization, a vigorous canvass and a better\r\ndiscipline than that of any of their opponents. Their policy won the\r\nsupport of many ardent and very patriotic Nationalists, who voted in\r\nmany cases for Communism on the ground that it was the Russian\r\npolicy--out of gratitude for what the Tzars had done for Montenegro in\r\nthe past! Major Temperley, assistant military attache, in another report\r\n(Command Paper I., 123) observes that some local discontent had arisen\r\nin Montenegro because the native does not understand, and has never\r\nexperienced before, a really efficient system of government, and\r\nbecause the introduction of conscription was not well adapted to the\r\nnational tradition of lawless and untrained vigour. Major Temperley\r\ntestifies that the Republican party gained the suffrages of numerous\r\nreturned emigrants who admired the state of things in America. He shares\r\nMr. Bryce's opinion as to the insignificance of the pro-Nikita party.\r\n\"Even making large allowances,\" says he, \"there seemed to me to be no\r\ndoubt that the pro-Nicholas party were the weakest in Montenegro.\"\r\nCertain of his devotees were simply brigands who, like the Neapolitan\r\nmiscreants after 1860, sought to cast a glamour over their depredations\r\nby affecting to be in arms on behalf of their former King. This\r\npersonage himself was so well aware of his unpopularity that he was\r\nprudent enough to tell his supporters to abstain from voting. Those who\r\ndid abstain were altogether only 32.69 per cent. of the electors, though\r\none would have been justified in expecting a much higher proportion,\r\nsince the people have not yet fully grasped their rights and duties with\r\nrespect to the franchise; the distances to the booths were often very\r\ngreat, and the peasants were often indifferent as to whether one\r\ncandidate or another with a very similar programme should be elected.\r\nThe tribal or family system is still so prevalent in the villages that\r\none member of a family would be sent to express the considered views of\r\nhis fellows. The effect of the elections being held on a Sunday was to\r\nincrease rather than diminish the number of abstainers, for although\r\nSunday is a public holiday the Christian Montenegrin is under no\r\nobligation to hear Mass and for that reason travel to the village. The\r\nchurches are practically deserted, for he is accustomed on that day to\r\nremain at home; while the Moslem voters largely declined to vote because\r\nthere were no Moslem candidates. That is why it would appear that those\r\nof the 32.69 per cent. who abstained because they were in favour of\r\nNikita were extremely few. Their simple-mindedness has its limits, while\r\nthat of good Mr. M'Neill believes that because France, Great Britain and\r\nAmerica undertook to restore Montenegrin independence, they were still\r\nobliged to do so after they perceived at the conclusion of the War that\r\nan overwhelming majority of Montenegrins did not desire it. This\r\nmajority dethroned its traitor-king; but Mr. M'Neill maintains that\r\nFrance and England have dethroned \"a monarch who was a friend and an\r\nally.\"[64] Because M. Poincare, in the days before the Montenegrins had\r\nrejected Nikita, addressed him as \"Very Dear and Great Friend\"--the\r\nordinary form of words for a reigning monarch--Mr. M'Neill actually\r\nseems to think that France was for evermore compelled to clasp Nikita to\r\nher bosom. He clearly admires those who, since the end of the War, have\r\nrisen in the cause of their old King; and I suppose that in consequence\r\nhe disapproves of the Omladina, the voluntary association of men who\r\nbanded themselves together to resist the terrorism of the pro-King\r\nkomitadjis. If he had been in Montenegro during the years after the War\r\nhe would possibly agree that komitadji is the proper name for the many\r\nlawless elements who have found the traditional fighting life more\r\ncongenial than the thankless task of tilling their very barren land. The\r\nmoral effect of opposing to these the Montenegrin Omladina instead of\r\nSerbian troops was to destroy all pretence of the movement being a\r\nnational Montenegrin insurrection against the union, and the cessation\r\nof assistance from Italy resulted in the complete suppression of the\r\nmovement. The few outlaws who still remain at large, said Mr. Bryce in\r\nDecember 1920, are in no sense political, but are merely bandits. And as\r\nthe Omladina has now no _raison d'etre_ they have disbanded themselves.\r\nMuch now depends on the Constitution. If it gives them equal rights--and\r\nnaturally it will--with the other inhabitants of Yugoslavia the\r\nMontenegrins will be content.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn August 1921 the _Secolo_ of Milan sent a famous correspondent to\r\nMontenegro. He came to much the same conclusions as Messrs. Bryce and\r\nTemperley. Not a single political prisoner was to be found, and not one\r\nof the ex-soldiers who returned from Gaeta had been molested. The\r\ncorrespondent thought that the Serbs had been ill-advised at the\r\nbeginning to employ forcible methods against the pro-Nikita partisans\r\nwho were opposed to Yugoslavia; they should, said he, have let the pear\r\nripen spontaneously and fall into their lap. But now their policy had\r\nbecome one of conciliation: during the last two and a half years\r\nMontenegro had received from Belgrade for public works, pensions and\r\nsubsidies, 93 million dinars, and had paid in taxes only 5 millions.\r\nSecondary education had been increased, and 700 Montenegrin students (of\r\nwhom 500 are allotted a monthly grant) frequent Yugoslav universities.\r\nThe fertile lands of Yugoslavia were open to Montenegrin emigration. In\r\nfact an isolated, independent Montenegro was no longer needed. With the\r\ndisappearance of the Turk from all Serbian territory in 1913 a return to\r\nthe union of the Serbs, as in the days of Stephen Du[vs]an, was only\r\nhindered by historical, sentimental and, above all, by dynastic reasons.\r\nIt was sad, quoth the correspondent, that the glorious history of\r\nMontenegro should have come to such a tame end, but her historic mission\r\nwas closed in 1913, even as that of Scotland in 1707, to the benefit of\r\nboth parties. Now the Serbs were leaving them to manage their own\r\naffairs; many ex-Nikita officials had been confirmed in their posts,\r\nwhile officers were given their old rank in the Yugoslav army. It is\r\nunfortunate for itself that the \"Near East\" (of London) does not employ\r\nso discerning a correspondent. We should then hear no more of such folly\r\nas that which--to select one occasion out of many--caused it in November\r\n1921 to speak about \"the forcible absorption of Montenegro.\" And the\r\nworld may be pardoned if it is more ready to accept the observations\r\nmade on the spot by an expert Italian correspondent rather than the\r\nfutile remarks sent by the Hon. Aubrey Herbert from the House of\r\nCommons, also in November 1921, to the _Morning Post_. This gentleman\r\ninforms us that \"it was probably because the Yugoslav Government was\r\nallowed to annex the ancient principality of Montenegro, exile its King,\r\nand subjugate its people, without any interference from the Great\r\nPowers, that M. Pasitch thought that he could do as he liked in\r\nAlbania.\" That is the sort of statement which one may treat with Matthew\r\nArnold's \"patient, deep disdain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIAEVAL DOINGS AT RIEKA\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 1920, a letter marked \"urgent\" (No. 2047) was written by\r\nColonel Sani, the Chief of d'Annunzio's Cabinet, in which he confirmed\r\nthe orders which he had already given verbally, to the effect that all\r\nthe foreign elements, especially the Serbs and Croats, who \"exercise an\r\nobnoxious political influence,\" should be expelled from Rieka at the\r\nearliest possible date; he mentions that this is the command of\r\nd'Annunzio, who is in full accord with the President of the Consiglio\r\nNazionale. This was the continuation of a practice which the Italian\r\nauthorities had carried on in a wholesale manner. Father J. N.\r\nMacdonald, in his unimpeachable little book, _A Political Escapade_\r\n(London, 1921), gives us numerous examples of persons who in the most\r\nwanton fashion were expelled from the town. Thus a merchant called\r\nPliskovac was arrested by the carabinieri, while talking to some English\r\nsoldiers. After three days, spent under arrest, he was told that he\r\nwould have to depart \"from Italy\" (_sic_). He was given a _faglio di via\r\nobligatorio_ by the carabinieri, according to which he was banished on\r\nthe ground of being \"unemployed.\" Yet this man had had a fixed residence\r\nin Rieka for thirty-six years, was employed as a merchant, and furnished\r\nwith a regular industrial certificate.... His name had been found on one\r\nof the lists in favour of annexation to Yugoslavia. When the world in\r\ngeneral turned its attention away from Rieka, very much relieved to\r\nthink that there would be an end to all the turmoil now that an\r\nagreement had at last been reached and the poor harassed place was to be\r\nneutral, it presumed that those among her citizens who had been openly\r\nin arms against the other party would as soon as possible resign. They\r\nwould have been astonished to be told that the notorious self-elected\r\nConsiglio Nazionale Italiano, under the selfsame President, Mr.\r\nGrossich, cheerfully remained in office. It is true that they now called\r\nthemselves the \"Provisional Government\"; in Paris and London this change\r\nof title made a good deal more impression than upon the local Yugoslavs,\r\nwhose treatment did not vary. A decree was printed on January 21, 1921,\r\nin the _Vedetta_, which laid it down that the expulsions ordered by the\r\nprevious Government retained their force, but that appeals might be\r\naddressed to the Rector of the Interior. A deputation was received by\r\nthis gentleman, and was told that the procedure would be so complicated\r\nand so lengthy that it would not permit any one to return until after\r\nthe elections. These elections had been fixed for the end of April, and\r\nit seemed as if France and England were so blinded by the blessed words\r\n\"Provisional Government\" that they could see nothing else. That over\r\n2000 arditi, clothed in mufti, had either stayed from the d'Annunzian\r\nera or been since introduced was surely gossip, and how could anyone\r\nbelieve that those men had been granted citizenship on the simple\r\ndeclaration of a Rieka shopkeeper, or some such person, that the\r\napplicant worked under him? These declarations, by the way, must have\r\nrefrained from going into details, for there was an almost total lack of\r\nwork--except in the political department of the police. Rieka was to all\r\nintents in the possession of Italy, and she was learning what that\r\nmeant. The town was like a dead place, shops were only open in the\r\nmorning, and if the shopkeepers had not been compelled by the\r\nauthorities to remove their shutters they would have strolled down to\r\nthe quays where the grass was growing--\"but, thank Heaven,\" cried\r\nGrossich, \"thank Heaven, it is Italian grass!\" (If he ever recalls that\r\nlong-distant day, when, as a student, he fought for his fellow-Croats,\r\nand when, as a young doctor, he was an enthusiastic official of the\r\nCroat Club at Castua near Rieka, perhaps this gentleman thanks his God\r\nfor having led him to Rieka and turned him into an Italian.) Cut off\r\nfrom its Yugoslav hinterland the population of Rieka, which consisted\r\nmore and more of arditi and fascisti, less and less of Yugoslavs, the\r\npopulation had nothing to do save to speculate in the rate of exchange\r\n(but not in the local notes which no one wanted) and to prepare for the\r\nelections. Thus, with time very heavy on their hands, there was a great\r\ndeal of corruption; cocaine could be obtained at nearly all the cafes.\r\nThe elections drew nearer, and one wondered whether the Entente was\r\ngoing to look at the lists of voters and to inquire how it came that\r\nmany natives of the town were not inscribed. What was likely to happen\r\nif the place was delivered altogether to the C.N.I. could be seen when\r\nthe harbour of Baro[vs], given by the Rapallo Treaty to Yugoslavia, was\r\ndemanded, simply demanded, by the Italian Nationalists; those\r\nultra-patriots the fascisti, in Italy and in Rieka, when they saw that\r\nin the \"holocaust city\" everything was going just as well for them as in\r\nthe brave days of d'Annunzio, persisted loudly in claiming Baro[vs] as\r\nan integral part of Rieka. The Yugoslavs must be prevented, wherever\r\npossible, from approaching the Adriatic--this being the furious policy\r\nof the Italian capitalists who had succeeded in sweeping most of the\r\nItalian people off their feet. With Baro[vs], a port of limited\r\npossibilities, in the hands of the Yugoslavs, it would mean that the\r\nadjacent Rieka through its Yugoslav commerce would prosper; but anything\r\nthat savoured of a Yugoslav Rieka was obnoxious to the capitalists and\r\ntheir wild followers, since they feared that in the first place it would\r\nraise a grievous obstacle to their penetration of the Balkans, and\r\nsecondly it would involve the ruin of Triest, where German capital still\r\nplays a predominant part. So in their folly they strenuously fought for\r\nthe Germans, spurred on by the terrible thought that Rieka might become\r\npredominantly Yugoslav. They refused to listen to their wiser men, who\r\npointed out that the possession of an odd town or island was to Italy of\r\nnot so much importance as friendship with their Slav neighbours. When,\r\nat the beginning of April 1921 a large sailing boat, the _Rad_ (Captain\r\nVlaho Grubi[vs]i['c]) came into Baro[vs], the first ship to bring the\r\nYugoslav flag to that port, there was intense commotion among the\r\nfascisti. Forty of them with weapons ran down to the harbour, but\r\nGrubi[vs]i['c] told them that he saw no reason why he should not fly the\r\nflag of his State. A number of workmen, Italians and Yugoslavs, then\r\nappeared and made common cause against the fascisti, so that the latter\r\nwithdrew. And the captain of the Italian warship _Carlo Mirabello_ sent\r\nto ask Grubi[vs]i['c] if he had removed the flag. On hearing that he had\r\nnot done so the captain said that he had acted perfectly correctly. It\r\nseems to be too much to hope that such honourable Italians as this\r\ncaptain and these workmen will be able, without certain measures on the\r\npart of France and England, to prevail over those elements who have\r\ndragged Rieka down to death and to dishonour.\r\n\r\nAt last, on April 25, the elections were held. There were two parties,\r\nthat of the C.N.I., swollen with arditi and fascisti, who would have\r\nnothing to do with the Treaty of Rapallo--their programme consisted in\r\nannexation to Italy--and the other party, whose object was to carry out\r\nthe provisions of the Treaty. Professor Zanella was its chief. There did\r\nnot seem to be much hope that it would be successful, although it\r\ncontained what was left of the Autonomists, who in 1919 were the largest\r\nparty--desiring that the town should be neither Yugoslav nor\r\nItalian--and these Autonomists were now reinforced by the Yugoslavs. But\r\nso numerous had been the expulsions that many of the survivors feared\r\nthat it would be futile to vote, and on the other hand the Annexionist\r\nparty was quite confident that it would win. During the afternoon of the\r\nelection day, however, they perceived that the impossible was happening,\r\nand that Zanella was marching to victory. Thereupon the enraged fascisti\r\nhad recourse to violence. \"Zanella's victory was intolerable to these\r\npatriots,\" said _La Nazione_,[65] \"because they remembered the two years\r\nof tenacity and of splendid Italian spirit and of suffering which the\r\ntown had lived through.\" Most of the electors remembered the suffering.\r\nThe fascisti seized a number of urns and made a bonfire of them; there\r\nwas presented the spectacle of Signor Gigante, d'Annunzio's obedient\r\nmayor, bursting with armed companions into that room of the Palace of\r\nJustice where the votes were being scrutinized. \"I yield to violence,\"\r\nsaid the presiding official; and twenty minutes afterwards the contents\r\nof the urns were burning merrily. But these measures did not help the\r\ncause of the fascisti, no more than did their screams that they had been\r\nbetrayed. And if Zanella had to fly from Rieka because, as the\r\nNationalist paper put it, he could not stand up against the vehement\r\nindignation of so many of the citizens, yet he and his party have\r\ntriumphed. \"Fiume or Death,\" used to be the device dear to d'Annunzio.\r\nHe placarded the long-suffering walls with it, and it was on the lapels\r\nof the coats of his adherents. \"Fiume must belong to Italy or be blown\r\nup,\" cried the poet. But, strange to say, a majority of the inhabitants\r\nprefer that their town should continue to exist, and this it can only do\r\nif, in accordance with the Treaty of Rapallo, it becomes a neutral State\r\non friendly terms with both its neighbours, Italy and Yugoslavia. The\r\nItalian Government desires, of course, to execute its Treaty\r\nobligations,[66] and if it finds too painful the task of moderating the\r\nardours of its own super-patriots, it will no doubt be glad to have this\r\ndone by an International force. That method, which was only prevented by\r\nd'Annunzio's arrival in 1919, offers the speediest and most efficacious\r\nsolution of Rieka's troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRICKEN TOWN\r\n\r\nIf anyone imagined that they would be ended with the installation of\r\nZanella he was wrong. At the municipal elections 90 per cent. voted for\r\nthe Autonomist party, the Yugoslavs having had the good sense to join\r\nthem. But the Italian Nationalists were not going to yield to\r\nmoderation, and immediately after the elections Zanella was obliged to\r\nflee for his life, so that he was not installed in office until October\r\n5. He struggled manfully to clear away the chaos and to make such\r\neconomic arrangements as would eventually convert Rieka into a\r\nprosperous port. This the fascisti of Triest and Venice could by no\r\nmeans tolerate, and on January 31 an unsuccessful attempt was made by\r\nthem on his life as he was leaving the Constituent Assembly. On February\r\n16 the Anai (Assoziazione Nazionale fra gli Arditi d'Italia) sent out a\r\nvery urgent message from their headquarters in the Via Macchiavelli in\r\nTriest. They informed the subsections that not only was Zanella\r\npreparing to deliver Rieka to the Croats, but that the army of the\r\n\"globe-trotter\" Wrangel was waiting in Su[vs]ak to seize the wretched\r\ntown. Therefore Gabriele d'Annunzio had commanded that every loyal\r\nservant of the cause was to be mobilized. And after a few rhetorical\r\nsentences it continued, \"I will give the marching orders by telegram as\r\nfollows: 'Send the documents. Farina.' If only a small number of people\r\nare needed I will telegraph, 'Send ... Quintal. Farina.'\" The men were\r\nto assemble at the Italian Labour Bureau, 9 Via Pozza Bianca in Triest.\r\nThey were to be clad in mufti, to be armed so far as it was possible and\r\nto have with them three days' provender.... The subsections are asked to\r\ntelegraph the approximate number of those on whom they can rely. And\r\nthis memorandum should be acknowledged. It is signed, \"With brotherly\r\ngreetings. Farina Salvatore.\" About ten days later--between February 26\r\nand 28--there was a meeting at the Hotel Imperial in Vienna, under the\r\npresidency of Vilim Stipeti['c], formerly a major of the Austrian\r\nGeneral Staff. Some dissident Croats--among them Dr. Emanuel Gagliardi,\r\nCaptains Cankl and Petri[vc]evi['c], Gjuro Kli[vs]uri['c], Josip Boldin\r\nand Major-General I[vs]tvanovi['c]--two dissident Montenegrins, Jovo\r\nPlamenac and Marko Petrovi['c], together with two Italian officers,\r\nadherents of d'Annunzio, Colonel Finzi of Triest and Major Ventura of\r\nRome, ... assembled for the purpose of stirring up trouble for the\r\nYugoslavs in the spring. They referred with pleasure to the presence of\r\nsundry Bulgarian komitadjis in Albania, Finzi declared that the Italian\r\nGovernment would satisfy the Croats and give them Rieka as soon as\r\nCroatia had achieved her independence and a less visionary promise was\r\nmade of disturbances in Rieka. On March 1 the two Italian officers left\r\nfor Triest and on March 3 Rieka was confronted with another _coup\r\nd'etat_. The fascisti of Triest and of Gulia Venetia descended on the\r\ntown in two special trains of the Italian State Railway. They had not\r\nthe slightest confidence in Zanella, who was an honest man, working on\r\nthe basis of the Treaty of Rapallo, whereby Italy and Yugoslavia\r\nrecognized the Free State of Rieka. In their eyes it was a monstrous\r\nthing that Italy should be expected to observe this instrument. So let\r\nthe town be freed, let Zanella be expelled. And as he only had at his\r\ndisposal a force of about three hundred local gendarmes, with rifles but\r\nwithout munition, it was not particularly difficult for the fascisti\r\nheroes to accomplish their task. Zanella had to fly once more.\r\n\r\n\"If Italy were to offend against the freedom and independence of the\r\nState of Rieka she would deprive herself,\" said Signor Schanzer, the\r\nItalian Foreign Secretary \"she would deprive herself of the name of a\r\nGreat Power and in the Society of Nations she would retain no\r\nauthority.\" Thus did the successor of the relentless but unavailing\r\ndella Torretta try, with eloquent and noble words, to wipe the blot from\r\nItaly's scutcheon. She could scarcely have the nations coming to the\r\nCongress of Genoa, there to debate with regard to the economic\r\nre-establishment of Europe, while her own conduct was so very much under\r\nsuspicion. It would have been rather curious, so the _Zagreber\r\nTagblatt_[67] pointed out, for a robber to invite you to his house with\r\na view to taking steps against robbery. Something drastic had to be\r\ndone, so that Europe would not look askance at the Italian Government.\r\nZanella, it was true, had been thrown out--but why should not the world\r\nbe told that this had been effected by the people of the town? A very\r\nexcellent idea! And so a certain Lieut. Cabruna of the _gendarmerie_\r\nmade a plan to get together the Constituent Assembly and then--well,\r\nthere are always methods by which resolutions can be passed. Perhaps it\r\nwould not even be necessary for a single rifle to be fired at the\r\ndeputies from the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery. But most of the\r\ndeputies succeeded in escaping from the town, although frantic efforts\r\nwere made to prevent them. Out of the threescore only thirteen poor\r\ndevils were held fast and came to the futile meeting. The others, with\r\nZanella, assembled on Yugoslav territory at a place called Saint Anna.\r\n\r\nAnd Signor Schanzer went on talking. Officers and men of the Italian\r\narmy and navy, said he, had shown perfect discipline. Signor Schanzer\r\nmay not be an expert on discipline, but as a humorist he wins applause.\r\nOne's ordinary notions of discipline do not include the seizure of a\r\nwarship by a handful of bandits, the cannons of the vessel being\r\nafterwards directed against the Government palace of a neutral State.\r\nThe fascisti, with the help of Italian troops and accompanied by several\r\nItalian deputies, eject the legal Government of Rieka. One of these\r\ndeputies, Giuratti, is chosen by his friends to be President of the\r\nFree State--Giuratti of the fascisti, Giuratti who most barbarically had\r\nill-treated the Istrian Slavs, but--for we will be just--this was when\r\nhe believed they were barbarians, savages, quite common, brutal men;\r\nwell, he had learned, he wrote,[68] that this was not the case, they had\r\nadopted Western culture, they had raised the revolutionary flag against\r\nthe dynasty of Karageorgevi['c] and if Yugoslavia's dismemberment should\r\never come to pass, \"then, as I confidently hope,\" said he, \"the Croats\r\nwith their righteous national aspirations will unite with their great\r\nneighbour Italy. We salute the Croat Revolution with sincerest\r\nsympathy...\" and so on and so on. That was the kind of calm, impartial\r\npersonage to have as Governor of the distracted Free State, where in one\r\npoint anyhow most of the population think the same, and that is that\r\ntheir union with Italy would be an absolute disaster. Behold this\r\nGiuratti posing his candidature, Giuratti whose patriotism and idealism\r\nare, says the Italian Government, fully appreciated by them;\r\nnevertheless it has advised him to refuse the suggested honour. That he\r\nshould be punished did not occur to them; but what would they have said\r\nif a Yugoslav--surely with more right than an Italian and certainly with\r\na larger following of townsfolk--had been selected as President? \"The\r\nproceedings of the Italian Government,\" said Schanzer, \"are clear,\r\nspeedy and determined.\" But did anything unpleasant happen to Commandant\r\nCastelli, an officer sent to make order, when he quite openly placed\r\nhimself on the side of the fascisti? Would degradation be the lot of any\r\nofficer or soldier who \"mutinied\" and joined the fascisti?... Apparently\r\nit was due to the unhappy political condition of Europe that the whole\r\ncivilized world did not launch an indignant protest against the baseness\r\nand cynicism of the Italians. But how utterly they failed to persuade\r\nothers that the wishes of Rieka were as they represented them! Rieka\r\ndesires to remain independent and this desire the Italians will have to\r\nrespect. And the later they make up their mind to keep their promises,\r\nso much the worse for them. The Yugoslavs can wait, for theirs is the\r\nfuture. A cartoonist in the Belgrade _Vreme_ depicted a rough old\r\nSerbian warrior holding on his open hand a very neat little Italian\r\nsoldier. \"Now listen to me,\" he was saying, \"and I will tell you a\r\nstory. Once upon a time there was a country called Austria....\"\r\n\r\nThere was a characteristic little affair at Saint Anna on March 23. A\r\nfew minutes after Zanella had left the Lubi['c] Inn a suspicious-looking\r\nperson appeared. He began observing the customers and their\r\nsurroundings, when the Police-Commissary Per[vs]i['c] came up to him and\r\nasked for his passport. \"Take yourself off!\" shouted the intruder, as he\r\npulled a bomb out of his trouser pocket. Per[vs]i['c] grappled with him\r\nand soon overpowered him. And outside the house four other fascisti,\r\nArmano Viola, Carpinelli, Bellia and Murolo, were captured. They claimed\r\nto be journalists, and it is quite true that Viola is on the staff of\r\nthe notorious _Vedetta Italiana_; but when he comes into a foreign\r\ncountry as a special correspondent and is teaching others how to go\r\nabout that business--for until then they had been otherwise engaged,\r\nMurolo being charged with numerous thefts and attempted murders, while\r\nBellia and Carpinelli were accused of breaking into the Abbazia\r\nCasino--if Viola was teaching them how to be journalists he would on\r\nthis occasion have been better advised if he had restricted them to the\r\nconventional tools of the profession instead of bombs, revolvers and\r\ndaggers. Little use did they get out of them, for a trio of these armed\r\nindividuals were seized and disarmed by one Yugoslav gendarme, who was\r\nhimself very meagrely equipped. With tears in their eyes they begged for\r\nmercy. \"Pieta, Pieta!\" they exclaimed. So long as their own lives were\r\nspared they were very willing to forgo the 60,000 lire which had been\r\nput on Zanella's head.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it seems obvious that this exploit, if not ordered by the\r\nItalian Government was, at any rate, permitted by them. How otherwise\r\ncould the automobile containing these men have got past the sentries at\r\nthe Su[vs]ak bridge and two other Italian sentry posts? Moreover, these\r\nmen were in possession of documents which proved that official Italian\r\ncircles at Rieka were privy to their undertaking, and that they proposed\r\nto investigate the Yugoslav military positions on the frontier....\r\nThese five fascisti brigands--who were also lieutenants of the Italian\r\narmy--would therefore have to be tried not only for attempted murder but\r\nfor attempted espionage. They were put into a train and transported to\r\nthe prison at Zagreb. \"If once we begin to march,\" so the Italian\r\nsoldiers at Rieka had over and over again been telling the Croats, \"then\r\nwe shall not halt before we come to Zagreb, your capital.\" Those five\r\nwill perhaps some day explain to their comrades how quickly Zagreb can\r\nbe reached.... As yet those whom they left behind them had not lost\r\ntheir bombast: a manifesto was issued by them which declared that five\r\ntrue patriots had sallied forth to Saint Anna, for the purpose of\r\nparleying with the Constituent Assembly, and that in a barbarous fashion\r\nthey had been arrested, maltreated and possibly killed. Let the people\r\navenge the shedding of such noble blood. Everything, everything must be\r\ndone in order to liberate the captured brethren. And so, towards eleven\r\nat night, about sixty fascisti and legionaries came together. Armed to\r\nthe teeth, they designed to cross over into Yugoslav territory, but when\r\nthey noticed that the sentry posts had been strengthened they went home\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nA number of American and European journalists rushed out to Belgrade,\r\nunder the impression that the Yugoslav-Italian War could now no longer\r\nbe avoided. But they did not realize how great a self-control the\r\nYugoslavs possess. It may be, as a commentator put it in the\r\n_Nation_,[69] that Italy \"is practically at war with Yugoslavia,\" for\r\nshe is obsessed by the \"Pan-Slav menace\"; but if they insist on the\r\narbitrament of arms they will have to wait until the Yugoslavs have time\r\nto deal with them.... The Free State of Rieka owes its existence to a\r\nTreaty between Italy and Yugoslavia; both of them should therefore\r\nguarantee its freedom. Italian and Yugoslav _gendarmerie_ and troops\r\nshould resist together the incursions of fascisti; and if the two races\r\ncannot work in harmony, then let the administration of the town be\r\nentrusted to neutral troops; and as High Commissioner one would suggest\r\nMr. Blakeney, the British Consul at Belgrade. If this imperturbable and\r\nmost kindly man were to fail in the attempt at repeating in Rieka what\r\nhas been accomplished in Danzig, then, indeed, one might despair; but he\r\nwould brilliantly and placidly succeed. All the other qualifications are\r\nhis; an intimate knowledge of every Near Eastern language--and, of\r\ncourse, Italian; a perfect acquaintance with the mentality of all those\r\npeoples; common sense of an uncommon order, and the whole-hearted\r\nconfidence of those with whom he comes into contact. Great Britain and\r\nFrance compelled the Yugoslavs, at enormous sacrifices, to sign the\r\nTreaty of Rapallo; they are, therefore, morally obliged to see that it\r\nis executed. For too many months the Italians were saying that they\r\nwould carry out their part of it and leave the third zone in Dalmatia if\r\nthe Yugoslavs would agree to a few more concessions, commercial and\r\nterritorial, that were not in the Treaty. During the Genoa Conference in\r\nthe spring of 1922 the Italian authorities confessed to the Yugoslav\r\ndelegates that their hands were bound by the fascisti. These elements\r\nwould certainly object to the execution of that part of the Treaty of\r\nRapallo which refers to the port of Baro[vs]. Accurately speaking, the\r\narrangements with regard to Baro[vs] are embodied in a letter from Count\r\nSforza, the then Foreign Secretary, and are added to the Treaty as an\r\nappendix. Both were signed on the same day, and apparently this plan of\r\nan appendix was adopted on account of the fascisti. Yet if Count Sforza\r\nhad not signed that letter it is safe to say that the Yugoslavs would\r\nnot have signed the main body of a Treaty which to them was the reverse\r\nof favourable. And at Genoa the Italians started haggling about a strip\r\nof land near Baro[vs], in the hope that some success would stay the zeal\r\nof the fascisti. Furthermore they pleaded that Zadar could not live if\r\nYugoslavia did not, in addition to supplying it with water, give it\r\nrailway communication with the interior. The Yugoslavs were thus invited\r\nto construct at great expense a railway to a foreign town which their\r\nown [vS]ibenik and other Adriatic towns did not possess. This,\r\nnaturally, they refused to undertake, as also to agree to the Italian\r\nsuggestion that a free zone of some twenty kilometres should be\r\ninstituted at the back of Zadar. One might safely say that the Italian\r\nagents in this region would not have confined themselves to salutary\r\nmeasures for the welfare of the town. It is stated in the Treaty of\r\nRapallo that in case of disagreement either party could invoke an\r\narbitrator, and the Yugoslavs, who happen now to be the weaker party,\r\nhave been contemplating application to the League of Nations. Well, in\r\nGenoa it was proposed by Italy that Yugoslavia should renounce the\r\nclause which deals with an eventual arbitration. If you make a large\r\nnumber of demands--never mind that they should be in opposition to a\r\nTreaty you have signed--then you may gain a few of them--and Italy was\r\nhoping that the Free State would repay the costs which she incurred\r\nthere on account of her unruly son d'Annunzio, and, likewise, that the\r\ngood Italianists who at the end of the Great War committed wholesale\r\nthefts from the State warehouses should not be made to pay for it. With\r\nall their guile and strength the Italians were endeavouring to avoid the\r\nexecution of her Treaty of Rapallo. \"Italy is the one Power in Europe,\"\r\nsays Mr. Harold Goad[70] who thrusts himself upon our notice, \"Italy is\r\nthe one Power in Europe that is most obviously and most consistently\r\nworking for peace and conciliation in every field.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPES IN THE LITTLE ENTENTE\r\n\r\nThe complicated troubles, avoidable and unavoidable, that have been\r\nraging in Central Europe after the War are being met to some extent by\r\nthe Little Entente, an association in the first place between Yugoslavia\r\nand the kindred Czecho-Slovakia, and afterwards between them and\r\nRoumania. The world was assured that this union had for its object the\r\nestablishment of peace, security and normal economic activities in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe; no acquisitive purposes were in the\r\nbackground, and since these three States now recognized that if they try\r\nto swallow more of the late Austro-Hungarian monarchy they will suffer\r\nfrom chronic indigestion, we need not be suspicious of their altruism.\r\nIt is perfectly true that the first impulse which moved the creators of\r\nthe Little Entente was not constructive but defensive; their great\r\nAllies did not appear, in the opinion of the three Succession States, to\r\nbe taking the necessary precautions against the elements of reaction.\r\nOtherwise they, especially France (which was naturally more determined\r\nthat Austria should not join herself to Germany), would not have\r\nfavoured the idea of a Danubian Federation, in which Austria and Hungary\r\nwould play leading parts. The Great Powers would also, if they had been\r\nless exclusively concerned with their own interests, have handled with\r\nmore resolution the attempts of Charles of Habsburg to place himself at\r\nthe head of the present reactionary regime at Buda-Pest; and if it had\r\nnot been for certain energetic measures taken by the members of the\r\nLittle Entente it may well be doubted whether the Government of Admiral\r\nHorthy, which does not conceal the fact that it is royalist--the king\r\nbeing temporarily absent--would have required Charles to leave the\r\ncountry. The Little Entente pointed out to their great Allies what these\r\nhad apparently overlooked, namely, that the return of the Habsburgs was\r\nnot opposed by the Succession States out of pure malice but for the\r\nreason that it would inevitably strengthen the magnates and the high\r\necclesiastics in their desire to bring about the restoration of\r\nHungary's old frontiers. As the frontiers are now drawn there dwell--and\r\nthis could not be prevented--a number of Magyars in each of the three\r\nneighbouring States (the fewest being in Yugoslavia), just as the\r\npresent Hungary includes a Czech-Slovak, Roumanian and Yugoslav\r\npopulation.[71] But the Great Powers agree that if this frontier is to\r\nbe changed at all, every precaution should be taken against having it\r\nchanged by force. It is no exaggeration to say that there can be no\r\nreal peace in Central Europe until normal intercourse with Russia is\r\nre-established, but let it in the meantime be the task of the Little\r\nEntente to guard the temporary peace from being shattered.\r\n\r\nApart from this defensive object the countries of the Little Entente\r\nhave the positive aim of a resumption of normal economic conditions and\r\nthe institution of a new order of things in accordance with the new\r\npolitical construction of Central and Eastern Europe. It is obvious that\r\nthese three States have numerous interests in common which make their\r\nco-operation very natural, if not indeed indispensable.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: April 16, 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: January 22, 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: According to the Rome correspondent of the _Petit\r\n    Journal_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: But the wind was considerably tempered for him:\r\n    vessels laden with his precise requirements sailed over from\r\n    Italy and said they had been captured by d'Annunzio's arditi.\r\n    General Badoglio, in command of the royal troops outside the\r\n    town, ascertained in November 1919 that Rieka's coal-supply was\r\n    nearly exhausted and 7000 tons per month were required for the\r\n    public services alone.

Thereupon Mr. Harold W. E.\r\n    Goad of the British-Italian League wrote a highly indignant\r\n    letter to the editor, and in the course of it he denounced me\r\n    for having egregiously invented the chocolates \"for the sole\r\n    purpose of throwing her testimony into ridicule.... What do\r\n    you, Sir, think of such methods as that?\" And he concluded by\r\n    declaring that I wallowed in a \"truly Balkan slough of\r\n    distortion and calumny.\" Well, on referring to Mrs.\r\n    Re-Bartlett's article I find that there is no mention of\r\n    chocolates, and I apologize; presumably the children were\r\n    crowding round their adored _Capitano_ in order to thank him\r\n    for the bridges and waterworks which were being built in\r\n    Dalmatia.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: During the Italian occupation, said Professor\r\n    Salvemini, teachers, doctors and priests were deported or\r\n    expelled from the country, while the Italian Government had to\r\n    dissolve 30 municipal councils out of 33, so that at the head\r\n    of the communes were Italian officials and not properly elected\r\n    mayors. Moreover, all liberties were suppressed. No Slav\r\n    newspapers, no Slav societies were permitted, and 32 out of 57\r\n    magistrates were dismissed--these methods being due not to\r\n    cruelty or folly, said the Professor, but to the necessity of\r\n    keeping order by forcible means in a country which was wholly\r\n    hostile.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 59: November 13, 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 60: November 15, 1920.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: This, of course, did not meet with the approval\r\n    of Signor d'Annunzio. He made numerous pronouncements with\r\n    regard to his inflexible desires, saying that, if necessary, he\r\n    would offer up his bleeding corpse. And his resistance to the\r\n    Italian Government did not confine itself to rhetoric. During\r\n    his usurpation of Rieka this man had done his country grievous\r\n    harm. It was not only that he held her up to the smiles of the\r\n    malicious who said that she could not keep order in her own\r\n    house, but he was guiding the people back to barbarism. When\r\n    sailors of the royal navy deserted to his standard, he knelt\r\n    before them in the streets of Rieka at a time when from Russia\r\n    Lenin was inciting the Italian Communists to revolution and to\r\n    the conquest of the State. He refused to deal with Giolitti,\r\n    even as he had rejected the advances of Nitti. But the aged\r\n    Giolitti grasped the problem with more firmness, which was what\r\n    one might expect from the statesman who, after his return to\r\n    power, had leaned neither on the industrial magnates of Milan\r\n    nor on their Bol[vs]evik antagonists. Giolitti was resolved to\r\n    put an end to the nuisance of d'Annunzio; in no constitutional\r\n    State is there room for a Prime Minister and such a\r\n    swashbuckler. The Nationalists of Italy were furious when they\r\n    perceived that the Premier was in earnest and that force would\r\n    be employed against their idol. And it had to come to that, for\r\n    the utterly misguided man continued to resist--hoping doubtless\r\n    for wholesale desertions in the army and navy--with the\r\n    deplorable result that a good many Italians were slain by\r\n    Italians. Orders were issued by the Government that all\r\n    possible care should be taken of d'Annunzio's person; and\r\n    eventually when Rieka was taken by the royalist troops the poet\r\n    broke his oath that he would surely die; he announced that\r\n    Italy was not worth dying for and it was said that he had\r\n    sailed away on an aeroplane. He had accomplished none of his\r\n    desires; the town had not become Italian, though he had bathed\r\n    it in Italian blood. His overweening personal ambitions had\r\n    been shipwrecked on the rock of ridicule, for as he made his\r\n    inglorious exit he shouted at the world that he was \"still\r\n    alive and inexorable.\" But yet he may have unconsciously\r\n    achieved something, for his seizure of what he loved to call\r\n    the \"holocaust city\" provided the extreme Nationalists with a\r\n    private stage where--in uniforms of their own design, in cloaks\r\n    and feathers and flowing black ties and with eccentric\r\n    arrangements of the hair--they could strut and caper and fling\r\n    bombastic insults at the authorities in Rome, until the\r\n    Government found it opportune to take them in hand. The\r\n    greatest Italian poet and one of the greatest imaginative\r\n    writers in Europe will now be able to devote himself--if his\r\n    rather morbid Muse has suffered no injury--to his predestined\r\n    task. Those--the comparatively few that read--whose\r\n    acquaintance with this writer's work usually caused them to\r\n    regret his methods, could not help admiring his personal\r\n    activities, his genius for leadership and his vital fire during\r\n    the War. But, once this was over, he relapsed; and expressing\r\n    himself very clearly in action, so that he became known to the\r\n    many instead of the few, he lived what he previously wrote, and\r\n    now it is generally recognized that Gabriel of the\r\n    Annunciation, as he calls himself, who produced a row of\r\n    obscene and histrionic novels, is a mountebank, a self-deceiver\r\n    and a most affected bore. When he came to Rieka he thought fit\r\n    to appeal to the England of Milton. And, like him, Milton lived\r\n    as he wrote. Milton, Dante and Sophocles--to mention no others\r\n    of the supreme writers--were as serious and responsible in\r\n    their public actions as in the pursuit of their art.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 62: Whatever be the limitations of the _Dom_ as a\r\n    newspaper--it is almost exclusively occupied with the person\r\n    and programme of Mr. Radi['c]--yet that brings with it the\r\n    virtue, most exceptional in Yugoslavia, of refusing to engage\r\n    in polemics. This would otherwise take up a good deal of its\r\n    space, as Radi['c] has become such a bogey-man that nothing is\r\n    too ridiculous for his opponents to believe. A Czech newspaper\r\n    not long ago informed the world that this monstrous personage\r\n    had told an interviewer that not only had Serbian soldiers in\r\n    Macedonia been murdering 200 children but that they had roasted\r\n    and consumed them. Furthermore Radi['c] had said that the\r\n    British Minister to Yugoslavia had called upon him and had\r\n    asked his advice with some persistence, not even wishing to\r\n    leave Radi['c] time to reflect, as to whether the Prince-Regent\r\n    should rule in Russia, while an English Prince should be\r\n    invited to occupy the Yugoslav throne. The first of these\r\n    remarks proved conclusively, said a number of Belgrade papers,\r\n    that Radi['c] was a knave and by the second he had demonstrated\r\n    that he was an imbecile. And my friend Mr. Leiper of the\r\n    _Morning Post_ speculated as to whether he was more likely to\r\n    end his days in a lunatic asylum or a prison. But Radi['c] was\r\n    caring about none of these things; his birthday happened at\r\n    about this time and some 30,000 of his adherents came to do him\r\n    honour at his birthplace, over 500 of them on decorated horses\r\n    having met him at Sisak station the previous evening. When I\r\n    asked him what he had to say about the two afore-mentioned\r\n    remarks he gave me an amusing account of how the interviewer\r\n    had appreciated the various samples of wine which he (Radi['c])\r\n    had just brought down from his vineyard. The conversation\r\n    lasted for about four hours, and in the course of it Radi['c]\r\n    mentioned that a certain Moslem deputy from Novi Bazar,\r\n    irritated by the fact that Mr. Dra[vs]kovi['c], Minister of the\r\n    Interior, found no pleasure in his continued presence on a\r\n    commission of inquiry in the region of Kossovo, had been\r\n    throwing out very dark hints about a child which he accused the\r\n    Serbs of killing in the stormy days of 1878, and then relating\r\n    to the Tsar that this dastardly deed had been committed by the\r\n    Turks. This was the basis of that part of the interview. As for\r\n    the other absurdity, it was mentioned that some courtiers had\r\n    told the Prince-Regent that he alone could establish an orderly\r\n    Government in Russia, whereupon Radi['c] observed that England\r\n    and France were not likely to allow one person to reign both\r\n    there and in Yugoslavia. And when I asked why he had not\r\n    published this explanation in his paper, he said that he\r\n    couldn't very well charge a guest with having liked his wine\r\n    too much.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 63: Cf. _The Quarterly Review_ (October 1921), in\r\n    which Messrs.

Ethnological, economic,\r\nhistoric and strategical arguments--to mention no others--would be\r\nbrought forward by either side, and the Supreme Council, which had to\r\ndeliver judgment on these knotty problems, would be often more\r\npreoccupied with their own interests and their relation to each other.\r\nIt would also happen that a member of the Supreme Council would be\r\nsimultaneously judge and pleader. The mills of justice would therefore\r\ngrind very slowly, for they would be conscious that the fruit of their\r\nefforts, evolved with much foreign material clogging the machinery and\r\nwith parts of the machinery jerked out of their line of track, would be\r\nreceived with acute criticism. When more than two years had elapsed from\r\nthe time of the Armistice a considerable part of Yugoslavia's frontiers\r\nremained undecided. We will travel along the frontier lines, starting\r\nwith that between Yugoslavs and Albanians.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) THE ALBANIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\n1. THE ACTORS\r\n\r\nThose who in old Turkish days lived in that wild border country which is\r\ndealt with on these pages would have been surprised to hear that they\r\nwould be the objects of a great deal of discussion in the west of\r\nEurope. But in those days there was no Yugoslavia and no Albania and no\r\nLeague of Nations, and very few were the writers who took up this\r\nquestion. It is, undoubtedly, a question of importance, though some of\r\nthese writers, remembering that the fate of the world was dependent on\r\nthe fraction of an inch of Cleopatra's nose, seem almost to have\r\nimagined that it was proportionately more dependent on those several\r\nhundred kilometres of disputed frontier. It would not so much matter\r\nthat they have introduced a good deal of passion into their arguments if\r\nthey had not also exerted some influence on influential men--and this\r\ncompels one to pay them what would otherwise be excessive attention.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the frontier which the Ambassadors' Conference in\r\nNovember 1921 assigned to Yugoslavia and the Albanians. We have already\r\nmentioned some of the previous points of contact between those Balkan\r\nneighbours who for centuries have been acquiring knowledge of each other\r\nand who, therefore, as Berati Bey, the Albanian delegate in Paris, very\r\nwisely said, should have been left to manage their own frontier\r\nquestion. A number of Western Europeans will exclaim that this could not\r\nbe accomplished without the shedding of blood; but it is rather more\r\nthan probable that the interference of Western Europe--partly\r\nphilanthropic and partly otherwise--will be responsible for greater loss\r\nof life. If it could not be permitted that two of the less powerful\r\npeoples should attempt to settle their own affairs, then, at any rate,\r\nthe most competent of alien judges should have sat on the tribunal. A\r\nfrontier in that part of Europe should primarily take the peculiarities\r\nof the people into account, and I believe that if Sir Charles Eliot and\r\nBaron Nopsca with their unrivalled knowledge of the Albanians had been\r\nconsulted it is probable they would, for some years to come, have\r\nthought desirable the frontier which is preferred by General Franchet\r\nd'Esperey, by a majority of the local Albanians, and by those who hope\r\nfor peace in the Balkans.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE AUDIENCE RUSH THE STAGE\r\n\r\nA battle which took place near Tuzi, not far from Podgorica, in December\r\n1919, may assist the study of the difficult Albanian question. At the\r\nfirst attack about 150 Montenegrins, mostly young recruits, were killed\r\nor wounded; but in the counter-attack the Albanian losses were much\r\ngreater, 167 of them being made prisoners. On all of these were found\r\nItalian rifles, ammunition, money and army rations. On the other hand, a\r\nfew Montenegrins, with three officers, were also captured and were\r\nstripped and handed over, naked, to the Italians. But these declined to\r\nhave them, saying that the conflict had been no concern of theirs, and\r\nthe unfortunate men--with the exception of one who escaped--remained\r\namong the Albanians. The fact that Tuzi would be of no value to the\r\nItalians neither weakens nor strengthens the supposition that they were\r\nprivy to the Albanian attack; but it may very well be that the natives\r\nhad taken their Italian equipment by force of arms. It would, anyhow,\r\nseem that the Italians have little understanding of this people: during\r\nthe War, when General Franchet d'Esperey was straightening his line, he\r\npaid some hundreds of Albanians to maintain his western flank, and they\r\nwere very satisfactory. (It troubled them very little whether they were\r\nholding it against the Austrians or against other Albanians.) When Italy\r\ntook over that part of the line she employed a whole Division, which--to\r\nthe amusement, it is said, of Franchet d'Esperey--provided the local\r\npopulation with a great deal of booty, and in particular with mules.\r\nThere was constant trouble in those regions of Albania which were\r\noccupied by the Italians,[72] and in June 1920 things had come to such a\r\npass that the Italian garrisons, after being thrown out of the villages\r\nof Bestrovo and Selitza, were actually retiring with all the stores they\r\ncould rescue to Valona. Their retreat, said Reuter, in a euphemistic\r\nmessage from Rome, was \"attended by some loss.\" As Valona was their last\r\nstronghold in Albanian territory, it seemed that very few, if any, of\r\nthe tribes were in favour of an Italian protectorate. And since it was\r\ncalculated that during the first six months of 1920 the Italian\r\nGovernment was paying from 400 to 500 million lire a month for corn, and\r\nthe year's deficit might be enough to lead the State to the very verge\r\nof bankruptcy, one was asking whether from an economic, apart from any\r\nother, point of view, it would not be advisable for the Italians to cut\r\ntheir losses in central Albania. And this they very wisely determined to\r\ndo. Would that their subsequent policy in northern Albania had been as\r\nwell-inspired.\r\n\r\nIt would also seem as if the affair of Tuzi shows that the Albanians\r\nhave no wish for a Yugoslav protectorate, and there are a good many\r\nSerbs, such as Professor Cviji['c], who view with uneasiness any\r\nextension of their sway over the Albanians. Many of the tribes are\r\nprepared, after very small provocation or none, to take up arms against\r\nanybody; and those who, in the north and north-east of the country, are\r\nin favour of a Yugoslav protectorate would undoubtedly have opposed to\r\nthem a number of the natives, less because they are fired with the\r\nprospect of \"Albania for the Albanians\" than on account of their\r\npatriarchal views. We must, however, at the same time, acknowledge that\r\nthose Albanians who are impelled by patriotic ideals, and who would like\r\nto see their countrymen within the 1913 frontiers, resolutely turn away\r\nfrom the various attractions which the Slavs undoubtedly exercise over\r\nmany of them and combine in a brotherly fashion, under the guidance of a\r\ndisinterested State, to work for an independent Albania--those idealists\r\nhave every right to be heard. Their solution is, in fact, the one that\r\nwould, as we have elsewhere said, be best for everyone concerned. The\r\nlate Professor Burrows, who believed in the possibility of such an\r\narrangement, thought that it would take generations for this people \"to\r\npass from blood feud and tribal jealousy to the good order of a unified\r\nState, unless they have tutorage in the art of self-government.\" There\r\nseem to be grave difficulties, both external and internal, in the way of\r\nsetting up such a tutorage over the whole of the 1913 Albania; and if a\r\nmajority of the northern and north-eastern tribes prefer to turn to\r\nYugoslavia, rather than to join the frustrated patriots and the wilder\r\nbrethren in turning away from it, they should not be sweepingly\r\ncondemned as traitors to the national cause. The frame of mind which\r\nlooks with deep suspicion on a road that links a tribe to its neighbour\r\nis not very promising for those who dream of an Albanian nation; it is a\r\nprevalent and fundamental frame of mind. \"The Prince of Wied,\" we are\r\ntold by his countryman, Dr. Max Mueller, \"succeeded in conquering the\r\nhearts of those Albanians who supported him and of gaining the highest\r\nrespect of those who were his political opponents.\" No doubt they were\r\nflattered when they noticed that he had so far become an Albanian as to\r\nsurround his residence at Durazzo with barbed-wire entanglements.\r\n\r\nAmong the solutions of the Albanian problem was that which Dr. Mueller\r\nvery seriously, not to say ponderously, put forward in 1916.[73] This\r\ngentleman, with a first-hand knowledge of the country, which he gained\r\nduring the War, did not minimize the task which would face the Prince of\r\nWied on his return. Of that wooden potentate one may say that his work\r\nin Albania did not collapse for the reason that it was never started; a\r\nfew miles from Durazzo, his capital, from which, I believe, he made only\r\nthat one excursion whose end was undignified, a few miles away he\r\nexcited the derision of his \"subjects,\" and a few miles farther off they\r\nhad not heard of him. Dr. Mueller, after reproving us sternly for smiling\r\nat the national decoration, in several classes, with which his Highness\r\non landing at the rickety pier was graciously pleased to gladden the\r\nmeritorious natives, admits that at his second coming he will have to\r\ntake various other steps. Austrians and Germans should be brought to\r\ncolonize the country, and not peasants, forsooth, like those who have\r\nlaboriously made good in the Banat, but merchants, manufacturers,\r\nengineers, doctors, officials and large landowners--not by any means\r\nwithout close inquiry, so as to admit only such as are in possession of\r\na blameless repute and a certain amount of cash. Dr. Mueller was resolved\r\nthat, so far as lay with him, none but the very best Teutons should\r\nembark upon this splendid mission. He desired that, after landing, they\r\nshould first of all remain at the harbour, there to undergo a course of\r\ntuition in the customs and peculiarities of the tribe among which they\r\nproposed to settle. His compatriots would be so tactful--apparently not\r\ncriticizing any of the customs--that the hearts of the Albanians would\r\nincline towards them and by their beautiful example they would make\r\nthese primitive, wild hearts beat not so much for local interests but\r\nvery fervently for the Albanian fatherland. One cannot help a feeling of\r\nregret that circumstances have prevented us from seeing Dr. Mueller's\r\nscheme put into action.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SERBS, ALBANIANS AND THE MISCHIEF-MAKERS\r\n\r\nIn 1913, after the Balkan War, the flags of the Powers were hoisted at\r\nScutari, and a frontier dividing the Albanians from the Yugoslavs\r\n(Montenegrins and Serbs) was indicated by Austria and traced at the\r\nLondon Conference. This boundary was still awaiting its final\r\ndemarcation by commissioners on the spot when the European War broke\r\nout. Then in the second year of the War disturbances were organized by\r\nthe Austrians in Albania--their friend the miscreant ruler of Montenegro\r\ncaused money to be sent for this purpose to the Austro-Hungarian Consul\r\nat Scutari--and in April and May of that year the Serbs were authorized\r\nby their Allies to protect themselves by occupying certain portions of\r\nthe country. Various battles took place between those Albanians who were\r\npartisans of Austria and those who were disinclined to attack the Serbs\r\nin the rear. The Serbian Government opposed the Austrian propaganda by\r\ndispatching to that region the Montenegrin Pouni[vs]a Ra[vc]i['c], of\r\nwhom we have much to say. He was accompanied by Smajo Ferovi['c], a\r\nMoslem sergeant of komitadjis. They explained to the Albanians that the\r\nSerbs had been offered a separate peace with numerous concessions, but\r\nthat Mr. Pa[vs]i['c] had refused to treat. When the two Albanian parties\r\ndiscussed the situation by shooting at each other, the Austro-Hungarian\r\nofficers made tracks for Kotor, and that particular intrigue came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nWhen the War was over, the Serbs, sweeping up from Macedonia, were\r\nrequested by General Franchet d'Esperey to undertake a task which the\r\nItalians refused, and push the demoralized Austrian troops out of\r\nAlbania. Some weeks after this had been accomplished, the Italians,\r\nmindful of the Treaty of London, demanded that a large part of Albania\r\nshould be given up to their administration. The Serbs agreed and\r\nwithdrew; they even took away their representative from Scutari, where\r\nthe Allies had again installed themselves. The Treaty of London bestowed\r\nupon the Serbs a sphere of influence in northern Albania, but--save for\r\na few misguided politicians--they were logical enough to reject the\r\nwhole of the pernicious Treaty, both the clauses which robbed them in\r\nDalmatia and those which in Albania gave them stolen goods. Over and\r\nover again did the Yugoslav delegates declare in Paris that it was their\r\nwish to see established an independent Albania with the frontiers of\r\n1913. These, the first frontiers which the Albanians had ever possessed,\r\nwere laid down by Austria with the express purpose of thwarting the\r\nSerbs and facilitating Albanian raids. It is true that several towns\r\nwith large Albanian majorities were made over to the Serbs--very much,\r\nas it turned out, to their subsequent advantage--yet, being separated\r\nfrom their hinterland, this was a doubtful gift. Nevertheless, if a free\r\nand united Albania could be constituted the Serbs were ready to accept\r\nthis frontier, and even Monsieur Justin Godart, the strenuous French\r\nAlbanophile of whom we speak elsewhere, cannot deny that this attitude\r\nof the Yugoslavs redounds very much to their honour. But before relative\r\ntranquillity reigns among the Albanians it is, as General Franchet\r\nd'Esperey perceived in 1918, an untenable line. He, therefore, drew a\r\ntemporary frontier which permitted the Serbs to advance for some miles\r\ninto Albania, so that on the river Drin or on the mountain summits they\r\nmight ward off attacks. These, by the way, had their origin far more in\r\nthe border population's empty stomachs than in their animus against the\r\nSlavs. And nobody with knowledge of this people could regard the 1918\r\nfrontier as unnecessary. The Albanians were themselves so much inclined\r\nto acquiesce that one must ask why, in the months which followed, there\r\nwas a considerable amount of border fighting. What was it that caused\r\nthe Albanians in the region of Scutari to make their violent onslaughts\r\nof December 1919 and January 1920, the renewed offensive of July 1920 at\r\nthe same places--after which the Albanian Government forwarded to that\r\nof Belgrade an assurance of goodwill--and the organized thrust of August\r\n13 against Dibra, which was preceded on August 10 by a manifesto to the\r\nchancelleries of Europe falsely accusing the Serbs of having begun these\r\noperations, and which was followed by the Tirana Government promising to\r\ntry to find the guilty persons? The 19th of the same month saw the\r\nAlbanians delivering a further attack in the neighbourhood of Scutari,\r\nand then the Yugoslav Government decided that their army must occupy\r\nsuch defensive positions as would put a stop to these everlasting\r\nincidents. But a voice was whispering to the Albanians that they must\r\nnot allow themselves to be so easily coerced. \"You have thrown us out of\r\nall the land behind Valona,\" said the voice, \"and out of Valona itself.\r\nYou must, therefore, be the greatest warriors in the world, and we will\r\nbe charmed to provide you with rifles and machine guns and munitions\r\nand uniforms and cash. We will gladly publish to the world that your\r\nDelegation at Rome has sent us an official Note demanding that the\r\nYugoslav troops should retire to the 1913 line, pure and simple. Of\r\ncourse we, like the other Allies, agreed that they should occupy the\r\nmore advanced positions which General Franchet d'Esperey assigned to\r\nthem--and to show you how truly sorry we are for having done so, we\r\npropose to send you all the help you need. In dealing with us you will\r\nfind that you have to do with honourable men, whereas the\r\nYugoslavs--what are they but Yugoslavs?\"\r\n\r\nAnyone who travelled about this time along the road from Scutari down to\r\nthe port of San Giovanni di Medua would inevitably meet with processions\r\nof ancient cabs, ox-wagons and what not, laden with all kinds of\r\nmilitary equipment. Some of these supplies had come direct from Italy,\r\nwhile others had been seized from the Italians near Valona. The\r\ndetachment of Italian soldiers at San Giovanni, and the much larger\r\ndetachment at Scutari, may have looked with mixed feelings at some of\r\nthese commodities, but on the other hand they may have thought, with\r\nGeneral Bencivenga,[74] that it was good business--\"_un buon\r\naffare_\"--in exchange for Valona to obtain a solid and secure friendship\r\nwith the Albanians. Roads, as he pointed out, lead from Albania to the\r\nheart of Serbia, and for that reason a true brotherhood of arms between\r\nItalians and Albanians was, in case of hostilities, enormously to be\r\ndesired. And so the Italians stationed at Scutari, under Captain\r\nPericone of the Navy, may have felt that it was well that all those\r\ncannon captured from their countrymen were in such a good condition.\r\nThey would now be turned by the Albanians against the hateful Yugoslavs.\r\n[\"Italy is the one Power in Europe,\" says her advocate, Mr. H. E. Goad,\r\nin the _Fortnightly Review_ (May 1922), \"that is most obviously and most\r\nconsistently working for peace and conciliation in every field.\"] ... A\r\nfurther supply of military material is said to have reached the\r\nAlbanians from Gabriele d'Annunzio in the S.S. _Knin_. To the Irish, the\r\nEgyptians and the Turks the poet-filibuster had merely sent greetings.\r\nSome one may have told him that even the most lyrical greeting would\r\nnot be valued by the Albanians half as much as a shipload of munitions.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the more intelligent Italians had noticed that\r\nthese two Balkan peoples were disposed to live in amicable terms with\r\none another. Traditions that are so powerful with an illiterate\r\npeople--under five per thousand of the Albanians who have stayed in\r\ntheir own country can read and write--numerous traditions speak of\r\nfriendship with the Serbs: Lek, the great legislator, was related to\r\nSerbian princes; Skanderbeg was an ally of the Serbs; \"Most of the\r\ncelebrated leaders of northern Albania and Montenegro,\" says Miss\r\nDurham, \"seem to have been of mixed Serbian-Albanian blood\"; Mustapha\r\nVezir Bushatli strove together with Prince Milo[vs] against the Turks,\r\nand the same cause united the Serbian authorities to the famous Vezir\r\nMahmud Begovi['c] of Pe['c]. A primitive people like the Albanians\r\nadmire the warlike attributes beyond all others, and the exploits of the\r\nSerbian army in the European War inclined the hearts of the Albanians\r\ntowards their neighbours. Some of them remembered at this juncture that\r\ntheir great-grandfathers or grandfathers had only become Albanian after\r\nhaving accepted the Muhammedan religion; now the old ikons were taken\r\nfrom their hiding-places. And there was, in fact, between the two Balkan\r\npeople a spirit of cordiality which gave terrible umbrage to the\r\nItalians. So they took the necessary steps: many of the Catholic priests\r\nhad been in Austria's pay, and these now became the pensioners of Italy.\r\nMonsignor Sereggi, the Metropolitan, used to be anti-Turk but, as was\r\nevident when in 1911 he negotiated with Montenegro, he is not personally\r\nanti-Slav. Yet he must have money for his clergy, for his seminary, and\r\nso forth. His friendship would be easily, one fancies, transferred from\r\nRome to Belgrade if the Serbs are willing to provide the cash--and\r\nnobody can blame him. Leo Freund, who had been Vienna's secret agent and\r\na great friend of Monsignor Bumci, the Albanian bishop, was succeeded by\r\nan Italian. But, of course, the new almoner did not confine his gifts to\r\nthose of his own faith. Many of the leading Moslems were in receipt of a\r\nmonthly salary, and this was not so serious a burden for the Italians\r\nas one might suppose, since Albania is a poor country, and with no\r\nAustrian competition you found quite prominent personages deigning to\r\naccept a rather miserable wage. \"And do you think,\" I asked of Musa\r\nYuka, the courteous mayor of Scutari, \"that those mountain tribes are\r\nbeing paid?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I think that it is not improbable.\" ...\r\nAt the time of the Bosnian annexation crisis the Serbs had as their\r\nMinister of Finance the sagacious Patchou. The War Minister, a General,\r\nwas strongly in favour of an instant declaration of war, and the Premier\r\nsuggested that the matter should be discussed. He turned to the Minister\r\nof Finance and asked him whether he had sufficient money for such an\r\nundertaking. Patchou shook his head. \"But our men are patriots! They\r\nwill go without bread, they will go without everything!\" exclaimed the\r\nGeneral. \"The horses and mules are not patriots,\" said Patchou, \"and if\r\nyou want them to march you'll have to feed them.\" The Albanians were so\r\nlittle inclined to go to war with Yugoslavia that the Italians had, in\r\nvarious ways, to feed them nearly all. And what did the Albanians think\r\nof these intrigues? At any rate, what did they say? \"Italy,\" quoth\r\nProfessor Chimigo,[75] a prominent Albanian who teaches at Bologna,\r\n\"Italy is always respected and esteemed as a great nation.... The\r\nAlbanian Government,\" said he, \"has charged me to declare in public that\r\nAlbania does not regard herself as victorious against Italy, but is\r\nconvinced that the Italians, in withdrawing their troops from Valona,\r\nwere obeying a sentiment of goodness and generosity.\" Such words would\r\nbe likely to bring more plentiful supplies from Rome. And fortunately\r\nthe Italians did not seem to suffer, like the Serbs, from any scruples\r\nas to the propriety of taking active steps against another \"Allied and\r\nAssociated Power.\" When Zena Beg Riza Beg of Djakovica came in the year\r\n1919 to his brother-in-law Ahmed Beg Mati, one of the Albanian leaders,\r\nhe told him that the Belgrade Government, in pursuance of their policy\r\n\"The Balkans for the Balkan peoples,\" would be glad if the Italians\r\ncould be ousted from Albania. Zena Beg returned with a request for\r\nmoney, guns and so forth; but they were not sent.\r\n\r\nAhmed Beg and Zena Beg are patriotic young Albanian noblemen of ancient\r\nfamily and great possessions. But Zena Beg has the advantage of living\r\nin Yugoslavia, outside the atmosphere of corruption which is darkening\r\nhis native land. Ahmed Beg, who in 1920 was Minister of the Interior,\r\nMinister of War, Governor of Scutari and Director (in mufti) of the\r\nmilitary operations against the Yugoslavs, did not accept Italian\r\nbribes, but he was surrounded by those who did, and thus the gentle and\r\nindustrious young man was being led to work against his own country's\r\ninterests. With him at Scutari was another of the six Ministers of the\r\nTirana Government, in the person of the venerable Moslem priest Kadri,\r\nMinister of Justice, and one of the four Regents, Monsignor Bumci. There\r\nwas about it all an Oriental odour of the less desirable kind, which\r\ncaused some observers to say that when Albania obtains her independence\r\nshe will be a bad imitation of the old Turkey--a little Turkey without\r\nthe external graces. When the thoughtful greybeard Kadri went limping\r\ndown the main street, a protecting gendarme dawdled behind him, smoking\r\na cigarette; but this endearing nonchalance was absent from the methods\r\nof government: any Albanian whose opinions did not coincide with those\r\nof the authorities could only express them at his peril. [Blood-vengeance\r\nis, to some extent, being deposed by party-vengeance--this having\r\noriginated in the time of Wied, when the politicians were divided into\r\nNationalists and Essadists, after which they became Italophils and\r\nAustrophils, who now have been succeeded by Italophils (who ask for an\r\nItalian mandate) and Serbophils and Grecophils (who desire that these\r\ncountries should have no mandate, but should act in a friendly spirit\r\ntowards an independent Albania). Meanwhile the Italophils, nearly all of\r\nthem on Italy's pay-roll, were, till a few months ago, in the ascendant,\r\nand their attitude towards the other party was relentless.] One Alush\r\nLjocha, for example, said that he thought it would be well if Yugoslavia\r\nand Albania lived on friendly terms with one another. Because of this--the\r\nGovernment having adopted other ideas--his house at Scutari was\r\nburned,[76] and when we were discussing the matter at the palace of the\r\nMetropolitan, Monsignor Sereggi, I found that His Grace was emphatically in\r\naccord with a fiery Franciscan poet, Father Fichta, with the more placid\r\nMonsignor Bumci, and with two other ecclesiastics who were present. \"We did\r\nwell to burn his house, very well, I say!\" exclaimed Father Fichta,\r\n\"because Alush is only a private person and he has no business to concern\r\nhimself with foreign countries.\" Of course, when Father Fichta made his\r\ncomments on foreign countries it was not as a private person but as a\r\nresponsible editor. Thus in the _Posta e Shqypnis_ during the War he\r\ndenounced Clemenceau and Lloyd George as such foes of humanity that their\r\nproper destination was a cage of wild beasts, and, after having visited\r\nFrance during 1919 as secretary to the sincere and credulous Bumci, he\r\ncontributed anti-French and, I believe, anti-English poems to the _Epopea\r\nShqyptare_.\r\n\r\n\"I have been told,\" I said, \"by an intelligent Albanian who was educated\r\nat Robert College at Constantinople that the greatest hope for the\r\ncountry lies, in his opinion, in the increase of American schools, such\r\nas that one at Elbasan and the admirable institution at Samakoff in\r\nBulgaria, where the Americans--in order not to be accused of\r\nproselytism--teach everything except religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had my own way,\" cried Fichta, \"I would shut up these irreligious\r\nAmerican schools. Religion is the base of the social life of this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you and the Muhammedans,\" I asked, \"do you think that your\r\nco-operation has a good prospect of enduring? With a country of no more\r\nthan one and a half million inhabitants it is essential that you should\r\nbe united.\"\r\n\r\n\"God in Heaven! Who can tolerate such things?\" exclaimed the\r\nMetropolitan. That very corpulent old gentleman was bouncing with rage\r\non his sofa. \"Is it not horrible,\" he cried in Italian, \"that this man\r\nshould dare to come to my house and make propaganda against us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, sir, I am astonished,\" said Monsignor Bumci, reproachfully, in\r\nFrench, \"that you should ask such a question.\" [It was answered a few\r\nweeks later, when Halim Beg Derala and Zena Beg--who, being outside\r\nAlbania, were free to utter non-Governmental opinions--said that they\r\nhad not the slightest doubt but that the friendship between the fanatic\r\nMoslem and the fanatic Catholic would come to an end and each of them\r\nwould again in the first place think of his religion, so that, as\r\nheretofore, they would regard themselves as Turkish and Latin people\r\nrather than as Albanian. This foible does not apply to the Orthodox\r\nAlbanians of the South, who are more patriotic.] \"I am astonished,\" said\r\nthe Monsignor, \"that you should question our friendship with the Moslem.\r\nThey have been the domineering party, but all that is finished, and we\r\nare the best of friends. See, they have chosen me to be one of the\r\nRegents![77] Our Government of all the three religions is very good,\r\nand,\" said he, as he thumped the arm of his chair, \"it insists on the\r\nAlbanians obtaining justice in spite of our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nIt chanced that I had met Father Achikou, Doctor of Theology and\r\nPhilosophy, in the Franciscan church. Because his brother had had\r\noccasion to kill an editor in self-defence, this, perhaps the most\r\nenlightened, member of the Albanian Catholic clergy, had been compelled\r\nto remain for eight months in the church and its precincts, seeing that\r\nthe Government was powerless to guarantee that he would not be overtaken\r\nby that national curse, the blood-vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, one cannot praise the custom of blood-vengeance,\" said the\r\nMonsignor.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke,\" I said, \"of your Government insisting on justice for the\r\nAlbanians.\"\r\n\r\nAnd some time after this Professor Achikou and another prominent young\r\npriest were deported to Italy and, I believe, interned in that\r\ncountry.... With their fate we may compare that of Dom Ndoc Nikai, a\r\npriest whose anti-Slav paper, the _Bessa Shqyptare_, is alleged to\r\nexist on its Italian subsidy, and Father Paul Doday, whom Italy insisted\r\non installing as Provincial of all the Franciscans (after vetoing at\r\nRome the appointment of Father Vincent Prennushi, whom nearly all the\r\nFranciscans in Albania had voted for). Father Doday, it is interesting\r\nto note, is of Slav nationality, for he comes from Janjevo in Kossovo,\r\nbut he studied in Italy, and has abandoned the ways of his ancestors.\r\nThis town of some 500 houses, inhabited by Slavs from Dalmatia and a few\r\nSaxons who are now entirely Slavicized, still retains a costume that\r\nresembles the Dalmatian, as also a rather defective Dalmatian dialect.\r\nThe Austrians for thirty years endeavoured to Albanize them, but the\r\npeople resisted this and boycotted the church and school. The priest\r\nLazar, who defended their Slav national conscience, was persecuted and\r\nforced to flee to Serbia--he is now Mayor of Janjevo. It usually\r\nhappened, by the way, that the priests of this Catholic town came from\r\nDalmatia; but the Slav idea could bridge over the difference between\r\nCatholicism and Orthodoxy, so that if no Catholic priest was available\r\nhis place would be taken by an Orthodox priest from a neighbouring\r\nvillage. Only a few of the natives are anti-nationalists, having been\r\nbrought up, like Father Doday, in some Italian or Austrian seminary.\r\nThere are in Albania to-day about ten such priests who come from\r\nJanjevo.... How well this Father Doday has served his masters may be\r\nseen in the case of the Franciscan priest in Shala, who, with the whole\r\npopulation of armed Catholics, resisted the Italian advance of 1920.\r\nTogether with Lieut. Lek Marashi he organized komitadjis in Shala and\r\nelsewhere, his purpose being to liberate his country from the Italians.\r\nSince these latter could do nothing else against him they compelled the\r\nBishop of Pulati to punish him; however, all that the Bishop did was to\r\ntell the patriot priest to go away. But Father Doday was more willing to\r\nwork for the Italians; he excommunicated his fellow-countryman, on the\r\nground that he would not come to Scutari, where his life would have been\r\nin danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE STATE OF ALBANIAN CULTURE\r\n\r\nBut, you may say, one cannot in fairness expect the new Albanian\r\nGovernment to achieve in so short a time what the Serbian Government has\r\neffected among the Albanians of Kossovo, who are being persuaded to\r\nrelinquish their devastating custom of blood-vengeance. Prior to March\r\n1921, over 400 of its devotees and of brigands had given themselves up\r\nin Kossovo--turning away from the old days when, as one of them\r\nexpressed it, \"a shot from my rifle was heard at a distance of three\r\nhours' travel\"; one of the most eminent among them disdained to\r\nsurrender to a local authority and made his way to Belgrade, where he\r\npresented himself one afternoon to the astonished officials at the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. \"After all,\" as Miss Durham has written, \"the\r\nmost important fact in northern Albania is blood-vengeance.\" What we\r\nmust set out to probe is whether the Albanians, if they are left to\r\nthemselves, will be able after a time to administer their country in a\r\nreasonably satisfactory manner.... Their culture is admittedly a very\r\nlow one. In the realm of art a few love-songs and several proverbs were\r\nall that Consul Hahn could collect for his monumental work,[78] though\r\nhis researches, which lasted for years, took him all over the country.\r\nOne of these love-songs, a piece of six lines, will give some idea of\r\ntheir aesthetic value; a lover, standing outside the house of his lady,\r\ninvites her to come out to him immediately; he threatens that if she\r\ndisobeys him he will have his hair cut in the Western style, nay more,\r\nhe will have it washed and then he will return, howling like a dog.\r\nConsul Hahn's summing up of the Albanians, by the way, stated that the\r\nsocial life of Caesar's _Bellum Gallicum_ was applicable to the tribes\r\nwhich now inhabit southern Albania, those of the north not being equal\r\nto so high a standard. Yastrebow, the well-known Russian Consul-General,\r\ntells us of the villages of Retsch and Tschidna, where in winter men and\r\nwomen clothe themselves with rags, in summer with no rags--so that in\r\nthe warmer months a visitor, presumably, in order not to shock the\r\nnatives, would take the precaution of depositing his clothes in some\r\nconvenient cavern. On the other hand, when the ladies in waiting on the\r\nPrincess of Wied drove out in low-cut dresses, it being warm weather,\r\nthe people of Durazzo were scandalized at what they called the terrible\r\nbehaviour of their Prince's harem. These mountain people live on maize\r\nand milk and cheese--salt is unknown to them. Baron Nopsca is regarded\r\nby the few educated Albanians as the most competent foreign observer. He\r\nknew the language well and travelled everywhere. One custom he relates\r\nof the Merturi is the sprinkling of ashes on a spot where they suspect\r\nthat treasure is buried; on the next morning they look to see what\r\nanimal has left on the ashes the print of its feet, and this tells them\r\nwhat sacrifice the guardian of the treasure demands--sheep or hen or\r\nhuman being. Miss Durham says that human excrement and water is the sole\r\nemetic known to the Albanians; it is used in all cases of poisoning. But\r\nthe Albanian's death is most frequently brought about by gun-shot. \"In\r\nToplana,\" as they say, \"people are killed like pigs\"--42 per cent. of\r\nthe adults, according to Nopsca, dying a violent death. \"It was her good\r\ngovernment and her orderliness that obtained for her her admission to\r\nthe League of Nations,\" said the Hon. Aubrey Herbert, M.P., in the\r\n_Morning Post_ of November 29, 1921. And the enthusiastic President of\r\nthe Anglo-Albanian Society is modest enough to refrain from telling us\r\nhow much she was indebted to his own championship. The evil eye is\r\nfeared in Albania more than syphilis or typhus. Siebertz[79] mentions a\r\nfavourite remedy, which is to spit at the patient. A ceremonial spitting\r\nis also used by anyone who sees two people engaged in close\r\nconversation; very likely they are plotting against the third party, and\r\nby his timely expectoration their wicked plans will be upset.\r\n\r\nAbsurd as it may sound, there are not a few Albanian apologists who lay\r\nthe entire blame upon the Turks. They assert--and it is true--that\r\nConstantinople left this distant province so completely almost to its\r\nown devices that the suzerain might just as well not have existed. A\r\nfew Turkish officials lived in the towns, in the country they showed\r\nthemselves when they were furtively travelling through it; and the chief\r\nofficials, such as the Vali of Scutari, were wont to be Albanians. And,\r\nbeing left by the Turks to evolve their own salvation, they turned\r\nAlbania into a region of utter darkness--at any rate, they did\r\npractically nothing to shake off the barbarism which they had inherited.\r\nThey have certain alluring attributes, such as their unpolluted mediaeval\r\nideas on the sanctity of guests and the punctilious maintenance of their\r\nhonour,[80] their readiness to die for freedom as well as for a quarrel\r\nabout a sheep, and their not infrequent personal magnetism. They are\r\nvery abstemious, their morals are pure, they have certain mental\r\nqualities, as yet undeveloped, and they are thrifty. But \"they are so\r\ndevoid of both originality and unity,\" says Sir Charles Eliot,[81] that\r\nacutest of observers, \"that it is vain to seek for anything in politics,\r\nart, religion, literature or customs to which the name Albanian can be\r\nproperly applied as denoting something common to the Albanian race.\"\r\n\r\nThe apologists, such as Miss Durham, argue that the other Balkan peoples\r\nsuffered from a good deal of internal tumult after they had set\r\nthemselves up as independent countries. And it is submitted that the\r\nAlbanians would gradually develop the same national spirit as their\r\nneighbours. But there are as yet, Miss Durham must acknowledge, very\r\nfew signs that this will ever come to pass.\r\n\r\n\"We are Albanians,\" said Monsignor Bumci, \"we ask for Albania! We demand\r\nit! Surely you can see that we are all marching together, men from all\r\nparts of Albania, marching against the Yugoslavs. I say we are united.\"\r\n\r\nAnd some miles from Scutari a part of the Albanian army was returning\r\nfrom a foray into Yugoslavia. When they came into the territory of a\r\ncertain tribe they were compelled, by way of toll, to surrender their\r\nbooty. Such incidents occurred in several places, so that obviously the\r\nconditions still prevail that were described in 1905 by Karl\r\nSteinmetz,[82] an Austrian engineer who learned the language and\r\ntravelled through the country in the disguise of a Franciscan monk. \"The\r\ntribes cannot conceive the idea of a higher unity,\" says he in one of\r\nhis valuable books. [So that in attempting to build up the new State\r\nthese tribal institutions should be used as much as possible. Except in\r\nthe towns, which play a relatively small part in the country's life, the\r\nvoting should be by tribes.] \"How could a Nikaj and a Shala meet,\" says\r\nhe, \"except for mutual destruction? Will a Mirdite for a nice word give\r\nup his bandit expeditions to the plain? The local antagonisms are as yet\r\nfar too great.\" More often than not you would find that the Albanians\r\nregard each other as at the time of the Balkan War, when, for example, a\r\nSerbian cavalry officer took the village of Puka and asked the mayor to\r\nlead him to the neighbouring village of Duci. His worship consented, but\r\nafter walking on ahead for half an hour he stopped. \"We are now midway\r\nbetween the two villages,\" he said, \"and I can go no farther.\" \"Unless\r\nyou continue,\" said the captain, \"I shall be obliged to have you shot.\"\r\n\"_Nukahaile_ [I don't care],\" said the Albanian. \"It is all the same to\r\nme whether I am killed by you or by the men of Duci, and I certainly\r\nshall be killed if I show myself there.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all united, Catholic and Moslem. It is splendid!\" said Monsignor\r\nBumci. \"And we are not by any means fanatical--with us it is the\r\ncountry first and our religion afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly the Shqyptar is not so good a churchman as we have sometimes\r\nbeen led to believe. Prenk Bib Doda is said to have cherished the\r\nprecepts of the Catholic Church with such devotion that he could not\r\nbring himself to institute divorce proceedings against his childless\r\nwife. We are told that his mother was animated with similar scruples,\r\nand that, to solve this awkward question the old lady one day seized a\r\nrifle and shot her daughter-in-law dead. There is not more truth in this\r\ntale than in that of the brigands who, on a certain Friday, overpowered\r\nand slew a caravan of merchants between Dibra and Prizren. On examining\r\ntheir spoil they are said to have discovered a large amount of meat,\r\nbut, as it was Friday, to have refrained from consuming it. Prenk Bib\r\nDoda was, as a matter of fact, impotent; and his widow, Lucia Bib Doda,\r\nsurvives him.... One agrees with Monsignor Bumci that the Albanian is\r\nnot altogether so blindly a supporter of his Church as we have been\r\ntold, and his murderous intentions against a neighbouring tribe will be\r\nnot at all diminished if they happen to profess the same religion as\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone can see,\" quoth the Monsignor, \"that the Government is dear to\r\nus. Men are coming from all over the country, anxious to execute its\r\nwishes and to be enrolled against the Yugoslav.\"\r\n\r\nYes, we saw numbers of men tramping up to Scutari, from boys to\r\nseptuagenarians. They were going to fight--it pleased them enormously.\r\nBut if the Tirana Government had ordered them to go back and work on\r\ntheir fields, if it had asked them to take some precautions against the\r\nravages of syphilis, if it had expressed the hope that they would no\r\nlonger sell their women for an old Martini, or that the village prefects\r\nwould pay some regard to sanitary matters--in the whole of Albania, says\r\nSiebertz, there is only one W.C.--then they would have laughed at this\r\nGovernment which tried to lay a hand on their ancestral liberties.\r\n\r\n\"The end of it all is,\" said the Monsignor, \"we are Albanians. We demand\r\nthe independence of our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a Latin,\" writes Professor Katarani,[83] \"I was fire and flame for\r\nAlbania.... But after a few months I was forced not only to change my\r\nviews about them, but to regret all that I had written in the _Mattino_\r\nand the _Tribuna_.... They are not a people, but tribes ... they are\r\nagainst every principle of public officials, they live the most\r\nprimitive lives. I who know Albania from end to end, who have sacrificed\r\nmyself for that country, am absolutely convinced that there could be no\r\ngreater misfortune than if, in its present state, it were given autonomy\r\nor independence. Otherwise I confess that an Albania free from any\r\nforeign Power would be to the interest of Italy.\" And he concludes by\r\nsaying that the Albanians have done nothing to deserve an independent\r\nState. It is well known that in the Albanian Societies that after May\r\n1913 were engaged at Constantinople and Sofia, at Rome and Vienna, in\r\nstriving for the independence of the country it was not the Albanians\r\nthemselves who had the chief word. Those who were initiated into secret\r\nBalkan policies were aware that Albania was the domain with which\r\nArticle 7 of the old Triple Alliance was concerned.... The fiery\r\nAlbanian patriot, Basri Bey, Prince of Dukagjin, also agrees that in the\r\nbeginning an independent Albania would be productive of anarchy. \"I\r\ngreatly regret to acknowledge it,\" says he,[84] \"but Albania is, so to\r\nspeak, the classic type of a country which has never had a real\r\ngovernment.\" Nevertheless, he is strongly in favour of independence, his\r\nreasons being because Albania is \"at the same time the old mother and\r\nthe youngest daughter of the Balkans.\" This flamboyant prince and doctor\r\nand deputy who denounces both Essad Pasha and his nephew Ahmed Beg Mati,\r\nhas got his own panacea for the country, which is a Turkish army of\r\noccupation commanded by a French general. Basri Bey seems to confirm the\r\nremarks of his more enlightened co-religionists, Halim Beg Derala and\r\nZena Beg, for whereas the Moslems can claim no more than a rather larger\r\nthird of the inhabitants, he calmly assumes that the whole country is\r\nMoslem. Albania, he says, is now more than ever attached to Turkey, for\r\nthe attachment is purely moral. ... The influence of this gentleman\r\nseems to be confined to Dibra, but he has a good opinion of his own\r\nimportance. In 1915, in the days of the greatness of Essad Pasha, he set\r\nup a Government at Dibra with himself as Prime Minister and Essad Pasha\r\nas his Minister of the Interior! There does not seem to be much\r\njustification for Basri Bey to call himself a prince. He is a Pomak, for\r\nhis ancestors were Bulgars who accepted Islam. His father was an\r\nofficial of the Turkish Government at Philippopolis.\r\n\r\nFather Fichta told me that his countrymen would do very well indeed if\r\nthey could import from other parts of Europe financial help, technicians\r\nand judges. Some years ago the Turks settled to send two judges to\r\nScutari; then the Albanians would no longer be able to charge them with\r\nnot administering the law, so that each man was obliged to take it into\r\nhis own hands. \"It is entirely your fault,\" said the Albanians, \"that we\r\nare driven to adopt the method of blood-vengeance.\" So thoroughly did\r\nthey adopt it that the assassinations in the region of Prizren,\r\nDjakovica and Pe['c] amounted, according to Glueck, to a total of about\r\nsix hundred a year. The Turks therefore sent a couple of judges to\r\nScutari, and on the day after their arrival they were murdered.\r\n\r\nWhat memory have the Albanians of their own great men? One sultry\r\nafternoon, as we were driving in a mule cart from the quaint town of\r\nAlessio, the driver lashed his mule with a long stick; but after half a\r\nmile of this, the animal applied a hind-leg sharply to the driver's\r\nmouth. He roared and fell back in our arms and bled profusely and was\r\ndoctored by the fierce gendarme, who put a handful of tobacco on the\r\nwound, so that the driver had to keep his mouth shut. For the remainder\r\nof the afternoon our mule went at a walking pace, and presently, to\r\nwhile away the time, we begged the gendarme and a merchant of Alessio,\r\nwho was travelling with us, to repeat the song of some old hero, such as\r\nSkanderbeg. They stared--their mouths were also shut. And finally the\r\ngendarme said he knew a hero-song. It dealt with Zeph, a man with\r\nsheep, and Mark who stole them. \"Give me back my sheep,\" said Zeph. \"No,\r\nno!\" said Mark. \"Beware!\" said Zeph. And one day, as he hid behind a\r\nwall, he fired at Mark and slew him. \"That is the song,\" said the\r\ngendarme, \"about the hero Zeph.\"\r\n\r\nTo whatever state of culture the Albanians may climb, I think it will be\r\ngenerally agreed that some regime other than unaided independence must,\r\nin the meantime, be established there. One hears of those who argue that\r\nAlbania should forthwith be for the Albanians, because they are a gifted\r\nand a very ancient people. They are not more gifted than the Basques,\r\nand their antiquity is not more wonderful. Nor do they stand on a higher\r\nlevel of culture with respect to their neighbours than do the Basques as\r\ncompared with theirs. Not many tears are shed by the Basques or by\r\nanyone else because those interesting men are all the subjects of France\r\nor Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. A METHOD THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRIED IN ALBANIA\r\n\r\nIf only the Albanian question would be taken in hand by\r\nhumanitarians.... Here you have one and a half million of wild\r\nchildren.... Build them schools and roads, police their country--they\r\nthemselves agree that the savage atmosphere in the northern mountains\r\nwas radically altered by the Austrians when they occupied that country\r\nduring the War. One has heard of numerous philanthropic societies in\r\nGreat Britain whose object has been more remote and less deserving; if\r\nsome such society would turn to Albania, their educational and economic\r\nlabours might, after a time, be made self-supporting by the permission\r\nto exploit--of course, with due regard to Albania's future--the forests\r\nand mines. \"To be master in Albania,\" says M. Gabriel Hanotaux, \"one\r\nwould have to dislodge the inhabitants from their eyries\"--(another\r\nFrench statesman has used a less exalted simile: \"Albania,\" M. Briand\r\nonce said, \"is an international lavatory\")--and it goes without saying\r\nthat any corporation which undertakes to civilize the Shqyptart would\r\nneed to bring in a military force, on similar lines to the Swedish\r\n_gendarmerie_ in Persia. The Swedes, in fact, who are a military nation,\r\nmight be glad to accept this mandate; the expenses could be met by an\r\ninternational fund. A certain number of Albanians would be admitted to\r\nthe _gendarmerie_; and the more unruly natives would be dealt with as\r\nthey were, for everybody's good, by Austria.... The Yugoslavs would then\r\nbe delighted to accept the 1913 frontier, which is also what the\r\nAlbanians ask for; and Yugoslavs, Italians and Greeks would all retire\r\nfrom Albania. There is really no need for the Italians to demand Valona\r\nor Saseno, the island which lies in front of it. The Italian naval\r\nexperts know very well that the possession of Pola, Lussin and Lagosta\r\nwould not be made more valuable by the addition of an Albanian base.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE ATTRACTION OF YUGOSLAVIA\r\n\r\nBut as Europe has not arrived at some such solution, and since the\r\nAlbanian Government has been prematurely recognized by the Powers, then\r\nwhile the Albanians are engaged in the stormy process of working out\r\ntheir own salvation, it is only fair that Yugoslavia should be given a\r\ngood defensive frontier. The 1913 frontier is only possible if the\r\nAlbanians are pacific, but as it has now been thought wise to set up an\r\nunaided and independent Albanian State there is nothing more certain\r\nthan the turmoil of which its borders will be the scene, and this will\r\nbe so whether the Italians do or do not come to the Albanians'\r\nassistance. What hope is there of even a relative tranquillity on the\r\nAlbanian border when so many of the natives, preferring Yugoslav rule to\r\nthat of their own countrymen, will be waging a civil war? That this\r\npreference is fairly widespread one could see in 1920 by the number of\r\nrefugees on the Yugoslav side of the frontier. [Of course, a large\r\nnumber of Albanians also fled to Scutari and elsewhere from the\r\ndistricts lately occupied by the Yugoslav army. In both cases the\r\nrefugees were moved sometimes by hopes for a brighter future, sometimes\r\nby fears which were caused by their clouded past. To speak first of\r\nthose who fled on account of a guilty conscience, it is evident that\r\nthese were more numerous among the refugees in Albania than among those\r\nin Yugoslavia, for it was the Yugoslav authorities and not the Albanian\r\nwho extended their sway. Mr. Aubrey Herbert, M.P., wrote[85] \"that in\r\nthe North the Yugoslavs had destroyed more than 120 Albanian villages.\"\r\nIt would have been interesting if he had given us their names, because\r\nthe Yugoslavs appear to have set about it so thoroughly that one cannot\r\nfind anything like that number on the Austrian maps, which are the best\r\npre-war maps for those regions. The Anglo-Albanian Society tells the\r\nBritish public, in November, 1920, of the 30,000 destitute refugees in\r\nAlbania, and in such a way that the cause of their exodus is ascribed,\r\nwithout more ado, to the terrible Yugoslav. But as the names are known\r\nof a good many Albanians who did not wait for the Yugoslav army, on\r\naccount of past troubles between themselves and Yugoslavs, as also\r\nbetween themselves and other Albanians, it would have been as well if\r\nthe Anglo-Albanian Society had reminded the public that all who fly in\r\nthose parts are not angels. It would, on the other hand, be just as rash\r\nto sing the undiluted praise of those Albanians who, at odds with the\r\nTirana Government, thought it opportune to leave their native land; but\r\none can safely say, I think, that among these wanderers there was a\r\nlarger proportion of laudable men....] Yugoslavia attracts the Albanians\r\nfor more than one reason--not so much because the ancestors of many of\r\nthese Muhammedan Albanians were, and not so long ago, Christians, as\r\nbecause inclusion in Yugoslavia would be to their economic\r\nadvantage--Scutari can scarcely exist without the Yugoslav hinterland,\r\nwhile the people of the mountains are longing for that railway which the\r\nYugoslavs will only build over land which is moderately immune from\r\ndepredation. Other causes which have made so many of the borderland\r\nAlbanians--to speak only of them--turn their eyes to Yugoslavia are the\r\nadmiration which any primitive people feels for military prowess and the\r\nknowledge of what has taken place in the Prizren-Pe['c]-Djakovica\r\nregion since it came into possession of the Serbs in 1913. Let us in the\r\nfirst place see what sentiments are now entertained by the Albanian\r\nnatives of that region towards their rulers. It goes without saying that\r\nthese sentiments are perfectly well known to those Albanians who live\r\noutside the Yugoslav frontier.\r\n\r\nWell, at Suva Rieka, near Prizren, for example, I found that all the\r\nMuhammedan inhabitants of Serbian origin are aware that they used to\r\ncelebrate the Serbian national custom of \"Slava,\" still keep up the\r\nSerbian Christmas Eve customs and often practise the old Christian nine\r\ndays' wailing for the dead. Some of us may think that this new\r\npro-Serbian tendency is rather on account of utilitarian reasons; the\r\ngreat thing is that it should exist. With rare exceptions, the people of\r\nSuva Rieka used to live by plunder; now they are sending their children\r\nto the Serbian school, at any rate the boys, and for the study of\r\nreligion the authorities have made arrangements with a local Moslem. It\r\nis to be regretted that Miss Edith Durham, whose writings were so\r\npleasant in the days before she became a more uncompromising\r\npro-Albanian than most of the Albanian leaders, says that if these\r\nchildren go to Serbian schools it merely shows to what lengths of\r\ncoercion the Serbs will resort. In 1912-1913 Serbian and Montenegrin\r\nofficers seem to have told her that severe measures would be employed\r\nagainst any recalcitrant Albanian parent who might decline to send his\r\nson to school. Assuming that these officers were not young subalterns,\r\nthat they were quite sober and that they were not rudely \"pulling Miss\r\nDurham's leg,\" it may be urged that even if the children be driven to\r\nschool at the point of the bayonet, such conduct would compare\r\nfavourably with that of the Albanians towards the Serbs in Turkish\r\ntimes. Talking of coercion, I suppose that the progress in agricultural\r\nmethods which one sees around Prizren is only further evidence of\r\nSerbian tyranny. The _gendarmerie_ on the country roads is composed\r\nlargely of Muhammedan Albanians--doubtless the Serbs have coerced them\r\nby some horrible threats. And if Miss Durham were to hear that Ramadan\r\n(_ne_ Stojan) Stefanovi['c] of the village of Musotisti had decided to\r\nreturn to the Orthodox faith to which his brothers George and Ilja had\r\nbeen more faithful than himself--such variegated families are not\r\nuncommon--I believe, though I may be doing her an injustice, that her\r\nfirst impulse would be to write to the papers in drastic denunciation of\r\nthe Serbian authorities. They have, like most of us, sufficient to\r\nregret--for example, the person whom they sent to Pe['c], when they\r\nwanted the land to be distributed, was King Peter's Master of the Horse.\r\nHe was thoroughly unsuitable, and caused a great deal of\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThere was a time at the rather gloomy town of Djakovica, when, owing to\r\nthe blood-vengeance, the Merturi were unable for eight years to enter\r\nthe place; now they come in, merely to gaze at the Serbian major who is\r\nin command. Halim Beg Derala, the aristocratic and wealthy ex-mayor, who\r\nas a pastime used to plan an occasional robbery in Turkish days, told\r\nme--he speaks a little French, in addition to Albanian, Turkish, Serbian\r\nand Greek--that citizens were often unable to leave their houses for two\r\nmonths at a time,[86] and although every house was provisioned for a\r\nsiege, yet one frequently had to manage without bread. Now the\r\ncandid-eyed, fair-bearded priest rides out with Ljuba Kujundji['c], the\r\nerstwhile leader of komitadji, in order to negotiate with the Albanian\r\nZeph Voglia, at that personage's own request, for his surrender to the\r\nSerb authorities. Zeph has written from a forest that he feels uneasy,\r\nbecause he owes sixteen blood-vengeances. He asks that his affairs may\r\nbe settled by the law, and those sixteen pursuing countrymen of his have\r\nsignified that this will meet their views, since in the first place the\r\nSerbs are disinterested in the matters between them, and, secondly, the\r\nSerbian penalties are not so mild as theirs, not permitting that a\r\nmurder shall be expiated by the payment of a moderate sum or that a\r\nguilty party may absent himself for three years and suffer no further\r\nloss than the devastation of his house. Another sphere in which the\r\nSerbs have gained Albanian sympathies is with regard to the disputed\r\nownership of land. Even as the Moors have been in the habit of handing\r\ndown, from father to son, the key of some Sevillan house that vanished\r\ncenturies ago, the Montenegrins, more fortunate, have been appearing\r\nwith the ancient title-deeds of lands that now are in Albanian\r\npossession. According to Serbian law it is the oldest document which\r\nprevails. And the Albanians are generously compensated.... Those who,\r\nwith the highest motives, advocate \"Albania for the Albanians,\" may\r\nargue that the mediaeval activities of Riza Beg and Bairam Beg Zur--whose\r\nadherents started shooting at each other every evening after six o'clock\r\nin the refuse-laden streets of Djakovica--would have been concluded and\r\nwould not have been continued by their sons even if the Serbs had not\r\nappeared. Let them, before proclaiming the modern reasonableness of the\r\nAlbanians, recollect that in 1919 the Moslem Bosniak ex-prisoners\r\nrequired on the average three months in order to traverse central\r\nAlbania, the country of their co-religionists. From village to village\r\nthe Bosniaks made their way, earning a little and then being plundered\r\nat the next place. Eighty per cent. of this population believe, in their\r\nfanaticism, that the Sultan will again unfurl over them his flag and\r\nthat the world will ultimately be converted to Muhammed. And if,\r\nentertaining such ideas, they are so rigorous towards their\r\nfellow-Moslems, what prospect is there that this 80 per cent. will\r\nassist the Orthodox and Catholic Albanians in building up a State? Their\r\nferocity, in fact, is so profound that it thrives on a diet which is\r\nchiefly of milk.... Perhaps a day will come when the Albanian will\r\nsubmit to be ruled by a member of another tribe, when local politics\r\nwill engage his attention less than the silver, iron, copper, arsenic\r\nand water-power of his country. Perhaps the day will come. Midway\r\nbetween Djakovica and the monastery of De[vc]ani there stand two large\r\nhouses side by side. In 1909 a man belonging to one of them slew four\r\nmen of the other house, and on account of this he fled beyond the Drin,\r\ntogether with thirteen other men of his family. There is no knowing how\r\nlong these refugees would have stayed away if that part of the country\r\nhad not come under Serbian rule, but in 1919 negotiations were set on\r\nfoot which--to the satisfaction of the members of the other house--would\r\nenable the thirteen innocent refugees to return, while the criminal\r\nwould be arrested.\r\n\r\nAs evidence of the cordiality now prevailing between Albanian and Serb\r\nin Yugoslavia, one may mention those cases where the Albanians in 1919\r\nentered into a bond that for six months they would exact no\r\nblood-vengeance from their fellow-countrymen; the number of these debts\r\nwhich hitherto had been regarded as debts of honour was very\r\nconsiderable, for they were not only incurred by assassination but could\r\nalso be in payment of a mere scowl or of your wife, from within the\r\nhouse, having heard the voice of another man raised in song. The Serbian\r\nauthorities are hoping confidently that the Albanians who have thus for\r\na season placed themselves under the law will be ready in the future to\r\npledge themselves. They are beginning to see that in a place the size of\r\nDjakovica it should be possible to make a wheel, that one should be able\r\nto find a shop whose contents are worth more than 100 francs, that the\r\nbreed of their cattle, of their sheep and goats and horses could be\r\nvastly improved, that if their land were sanely treated it could be\r\nrendered much more fertile, and that their system of fruit cultivation\r\nis absurdly primitive.... And with Djakovica and the whole region of\r\nKossovo being treated as we have shown by the Yugoslavs I think it will\r\nbe almost as great a surprise to the reader as it was to the local\r\npopulation when he learns that in a memorandum of April 26, 1921, the\r\nTirana Government complained to the League of Nations that the Yugoslav\r\ncivil and military officials were behaving in a very pitiless fashion\r\ntowards the Albanians. Certainly they have not as yet established\r\nAlbanian schools, but they propose to do so when there is accommodation\r\nand when teachers are available; and then, maybe, to the disgust of Miss\r\nDurham, Mr. Herbert, etc., the Albanians of the district will, with an\r\neye to the future, prefer to visit the Yugoslav schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. RELIGIOUS AND OTHER MATTERS IN THE BORDER REGION\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at what the Serbs have done in such a very short\r\ntime--most of the years since 1913 being years of war--to win the\r\ngratitude of their Albanian fellow-subjects, we shall, in following a\r\npossible frontier between Yugoslavia and the Albanians, at any rate\r\nbelieve that many Albanians of those thus coming under Yugoslav rule\r\nwould regard the change, as well they may, with equanimity. Suppose,\r\nthen, that the frontier were to run along the watershed at the top of\r\nthe mountain range to the west of Lake Ochrida. The people living to the\r\neast of this line in that district would acknowledge their Serbian\r\norigin. Thence passing to the neighbourhood of the village of Lin and\r\nfrom there in a northwesterly direction, so as to include in Yugoslavia\r\nthe Golo Brdo, the so-called Bald Mountains, whose thirty villages are\r\ninhabited by Islamized Serbs who only speak, with very rare exceptions,\r\nthe Serbian language, one may say that not only would their inclusion in\r\nYugoslavia be beneficial to these people, but that they would accept it\r\nwith alacrity. No very deep impression has been made upon them by the\r\nreligion to which, not long ago, they were converted. In the Golo Brdo\r\nit was in great measure due to the Greek Church which, about the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century, left the region without a single priest, so\r\nthat children of the age of eight had not been christened, and the\r\npeople in disgust went over to Islam. Near Ochrida, some of them were\r\nasked whether they frequented the mosque.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" they replied.\r\n\r\n\"What is your religion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is very strange,\" they told us, \"but we have none.\"\r\n\r\n\"What religion did you formerly have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we don't know.\"\r\n\r\nTheir priest roams the mountains with his gun, and there has been a\r\ntendency, since a man in this position received his salary from the\r\nState, for many to persuade the mufti to appoint them, irrespective of\r\nwhether they could read or write. The devout Moslem is, to the\r\nexclusion of everything else, a Moslem; but in these districts, where\r\nthe faith was assumed in a moment of pique or as a protection, and where\r\nthe Muhammedan clergy has been so negligent, the people are gladly\r\ncultivating their Christian relatives. In the district of Suva Rieka one\r\nhears of conversions to Christianity, and the functionaries bring no\r\npressure to bear, unlike the misguided Montenegrin officials who in 1912\r\nrode into Pe['c], the old Patriarchate, and wanted in their delight to\r\nhave everyone immediately to adopt the Orthodox faith. Now the\r\nauthorities, with greater wisdom, do not interfere in these matters.\r\nThey know that Yugoslavia will have no enemy in that house in the\r\nvillage of Brod, between Tetovo and Prizren, where two brothers are\r\nliving together, of whom one went over to Islam. They know that the\r\nMuhammedan Krasnichi of Albania are proclaiming their kinship with the\r\ngreat Montenegrin clan of Vasojevi['c], that the Gashi are calling to\r\nthe Piperi and the Berishi to the Ku[vc]i. The new cordiality will be\r\nimpaired neither by the differences of religion nor by the similarity of\r\ncostume. The average Albanian of Djakovica would not be any fonder of an\r\nOrthodox fellow-citizen if the latter continues to wear the Albanian\r\ndress which was generally adopted about a hundred years ago, and the\r\nVasojevi['c] may please themselves as to the wearing of a costume which\r\nthey once found so useful in the Middle Ages. They happened to be for\r\nten days in the Hoti country for the purpose of wiping out a blood\r\naffair, and when they were about to fall into the Hoti's hands they\r\nshouted, \"What do you want with us? We are Kastrati!\" The Kastrati, to\r\nwhom these Albanian-clad people were led, confirmed the statement, so\r\nthat the Vasojevi['c] earned for themselves the nickname of\r\nKastratovi['c].\r\n\r\nFrom the Golo Brdo the best frontier would pass north-eastwards to the\r\nBlack Drin and along that river until it is joined by the White Drin.\r\nThis is a poor country whose inhabitants are, for the most part,\r\nMoslemized Serbs. About a hundred men are now engaged in excavating the\r\nvery finely decorated Serbian church at Pi[vs]kopalja on the Drin--much\r\nto the edification of the local Moslems. This church of their ancestors\r\nwas covered in during the Middle Ages in order to conceal it from the\r\nTurks. Too often the natives' present occupation is brigandage; but from\r\nof old they have had economic relations with Prizren, to which old town\r\nof vine-arched, narrow, winding streets and picturesque bazaars these\r\ncountryfolk have been accustomed to come every week. These Moslems (of\r\nwhom there are some 100,000 in the department of Prizren, with 13,000\r\nOrthodox and 3000 Catholics) used to detest the Christians on account of\r\ntheir religion, although half of the Moslems could speak nothing but\r\nSerbian. The Serbs, it must be admitted, were not always blameless; in\r\nthe early nineties, for example, they suspended a pig's head outside the\r\nmosque. And the amenities of Prizren were complicated by the hostility\r\nbetween Orthodox and Catholic. This was largely due to the fact that, by\r\nthe intervention of the French Consul after the Crimean War, the\r\nCatholics--descendants of Ragusan emigrants of the Middle Ages--had\r\nsecured the former Orthodox church of St. Demetrius, in which church, by\r\nthe way, the services had come to be held in Albanian. When the Vatican,\r\nin the second half of the nineteenth century, sent a Serbian priest, the\r\ncongregation had become so thoroughly Albanized that after a year he had\r\nto leave. The propaganda of Austria, Italy and Russia did nothing\r\ntowards persuading the three religions of Prizren to regard each other\r\nin a more amicable fashion; while Italy and Austria gave exclusive\r\nassistance to the Catholics, whom they found in such distress that,\r\nforty years ago, most of them went barefoot, the presence of the Russian\r\nConsul was of such importance to the Orthodox that their position at\r\nPrizren was better than in their old patriarchal town of Pe['c].\r\nNowadays, with Austrian and Russian propaganda deleted, there is only\r\nthat of the Italians, whose proposal to create an independent Albania\r\n(under Italian protection) was at first applauded by some simple folk in\r\n1919. The Moslem took to accepting Italian money and then honourably\r\ninforming the Yugoslav authorities that they had been appointed as\r\nagents of Italy; they offered to capture the Franciscan priests with\r\nwhose help the Italians were trying to secure the Catholics; and as for\r\nthe cash, it seems mostly to have been spent in a convivial fashion by\r\nthe Moslems and the Serbs together. This friendship appears likely to\r\ncontinue, for the Serbian authorities, so far from countenancing such\r\npranks as that of the pig's head, do not even propose to reconsecrate\r\ntheir ancient church of Petka. When this building was made into a\r\nmosque, the Moslem still permitted the Christian women to come and pray\r\nthere, while if a Christian man was sick they let him leave a jar of\r\nwater in the mosque all night, so that it might acquire certain\r\nmedicinal properties. It is the intention of the Serbs not to restore\r\nthe church to Christian worship, but to turn it into a museum.\r\n\r\nWith the frontier then being drawn along the Drin, towards the Adriatic,\r\nthe famous villages of Plav and Gusinje would definitely pass to\r\nYugoslavia, in accordance with the wishes of a deputation sent by them\r\nto Belgrade in 1919. The well-meaning British champions of Gusinje, who\r\nmaintain that this village is furiously antagonistic to the Slav and is\r\nready to struggle to the uttermost rather than be incorporated in a Slav\r\nkingdom, these champions do not, I think, draw a sufficient distinction\r\nbetween Montenegro and Yugoslavia. Plav, with its mostly Christian\r\npopulation, and Gusinje, where the Moslem preponderates, refused at the\r\ntime of the Berlin Congress to be given to Montenegro, with which they\r\nhad certain local quarrels. Nicholas reported to the Powers which had\r\nawarded him these places that they were obdurate, for which reason he\r\nwas given in their stead a much-desired strip of coast, down to\r\nDulcigno, and nothing could have suited that astute monarch better.\r\nNikita--to call him by his familiar name--imagined that the two villages\r\nwould eventually fall to Montenegro, because of the formidable mountains\r\nwhich divide them from the rest of Albania; the road from Gusinje to\r\nScutari is very long and very arduous. When Montenegro succeeded in\r\ncapturing Plav in 1912, a certain Muhammedan priest of that place joined\r\nthe Orthodox Church and was appointed a major in the Montenegrin army.\r\nHe acted as the president of a court-martial, and in that capacity is\r\nreputed to have hanged or shot, some say, as many as five hundred of his\r\nformer parishioners, because they declined to be baptized. He told them\r\nthat their ancestors were all Serbs, and that therefore they should\r\nfollow his example. Since the Montenegrins did not restrain this\r\nover-zealous man, the villagers were naturally not in favour of that\r\ncountry. Montenegro had a very small number of good officials, owing to\r\nNikita's peculiar management which, in considering his favourites, did\r\nnot regard illiteracy as a bar to the highest administrative or judicial\r\npost.... The people of Plav and Gusinje have, on the other hand, no\r\nhostility against Serbia. In November 1918 a detachment of thirty Serbs\r\nwas stationed at Gusinje, what time certain Italian agents put it into\r\nthe shallow minds of some Albanians that Albania desired to be\r\nindependent under Italian protection. Nothing happened when a Serbian\r\nforce came from Mitrovica, except that these agents and a few of their\r\ntools--be it noted that perhaps half the population is ignorant of the\r\nAlbanian language--withdrew to the Rugovo district, where they tried to\r\ninduce the people to fly with them, so that the world would hear how\r\niniquitously the Serbs had acted. Those of Rugovo refused to accompany\r\nthem; in consequence of which there was a fight, some houses were\r\nburned, some women and cattle were seized. And afterwards the men of\r\nRugovo repaired to Gusinje and exacted a vengeance which, the most\r\nSerbophobe person will admit, had nothing to do with the Serbs. The\r\nluckless village of Gusinje was again laid waste in 1919 by the\r\nMontenegrins, but this came to pass as the result of the Montenegrin\r\nclan of Vasojevi['c] having their property ravaged by some Albanian\r\nmarauders who were prompted by the same Great Power. The Vasojevi['c]\r\nbelieved that this evil deed was done by the men of Gusinje, so that\r\nthey destroyed their houses. When the facts were explained to them, the\r\nVasojevi['c] said that they were prepared to rebuild the village. And\r\nnow Plav and Gusinje, who ask for Serbian and not Montenegrin officials,\r\nrecognize that it is impossible for them to live except in union with\r\nYugoslavia.... Miss Durham's wrath concerning an affair which happened\r\nduring 1919 in this region shows to what lengths a partisan will go. She\r\ncomplained with great bitterness that the Serbs had actually arrested a\r\nBritish officer whose purpose it was to make investigations.\r\n\r\nThe Serbs are human beings and are not immune from error; and Miss\r\nDurham is so determined to expose them that if all her charges were\r\ndealt with from Belgrade it would necessitate the appointment of one or\r\ntwo more officials. But in this particular case she is not the sole\r\naccuser. A Captain Willett Cunnington--who, according to the President\r\nof the Anglo-Albanian Society, the Hon. Aubrey Herbert, M.P., has\r\nseveral years' intimate experience of Albania--said in the _New\r\nStatesman_ that in consequence of what occurred to Captain Brodie the\r\nSerbian Government was compelled to apologize abjectly. Now I happen to\r\nbe very well acquainted with the stalwart Pouni[vs]a Ra[vc]i['c], the\r\nMontenegrin who arrested Brodie. Albanians have told me that\r\nPouni[vs]a's knowledge of the north and north-west of their country is\r\nnot a matter of villages but of houses. And he has always observed the\r\ncustoms which prevail in those houses, so that when he is known to be\r\napproaching, the people who live at a distance of many hours will come\r\nto meet him, whether for the pure delight of discharging their firearms\r\nto his greater glory or for the purpose of seeking his advice. It is not\r\nbecause he has studied jurisprudence in Paris that they respect him in\r\nthat bitter region, but because he does not disregard the laws that\r\ngovern the wild hearts on both sides of the frontier. Yet I suppose\r\nCaptain Brodie had never heard of him--poor Captain Brodie! unconscious\r\nof the great good luck which had brought him into the presence of this\r\nman who could have made his journey much more pleasant for himself and\r\nvastly more profitable for his superiors.\r\n\r\nThis is what Pouni[vs]a Ra[vc]i['c] told me:\r\n\r\n\"At the end of January and the beginning of February 1919, we were\r\nhaving a certain amount of trouble in the Gusinje and Plav district,\r\nwhere I was acting as delegate of the Belgrade Government. Travellers\r\nwere being murdered, telephone wires were being cut, and so forth. In\r\nthose parts, which I have known for so many years, it is a good deal\r\neasier to ascertain a criminal's name than to seize him, and I had not\r\ncaptured these malefactors when one day I had a message to say that a\r\nEuropean Commission was approaching. Later on I was told that\r\nthirty-nine of its members were Albanians. I ordered my lieutenant to\r\nfind out whether they were from our territory, in which case they were\r\nto be disarmed and brought to me; or from Albania, in which event they\r\nwere to be received politely. A quarter of an hour after this I was told\r\nthat they were all well-known brigands from our State, and there was one\r\nspecially notorious person, Djer Doucha, who in 1912 was converted to\r\nChristianity and was made a gendarme at the court of King Nicholas; in\r\n1915, after the Austrian invasion, he was reconverted to Islam and\r\nbecame a sergeant of _gendarmerie_. In that position he killed fifty or\r\nsixty Serbs and Montenegrins, to say nothing of his other acts of\r\nviolence. In 1918, for instance, he murdered seven school-children whom\r\nhe met on the road.\r\n\r\n\"I had some urgent business at Plav,\" continued Ra[vc]i['c], \"and there\r\nall these people were brought before me. In addition to the thirty-nine\r\nAlbanians there were three men in British uniforms. I was acquainted\r\nwith one of them, a certain Perola, a Catholic of Pe['c], a former\r\nAustrian agent who had committed many crimes against the Serbs and had\r\nlately escaped from the prison at Pe['c]. One of the other two said that\r\nhe was Captain Brodie, whom the London Government had sent as their\r\ndelegate for Albania and Montenegro. I suppose the third man was his\r\nBritish orderly; I never heard him speak. But Brodie said many things.\r\nOne of them (which was quite true) was that his Government had not yet\r\nrecognized the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He demanded the\r\ninstant release of his companions. 'Do you know who they are?' said I.\r\n'That is no concern of yours,' said he. 'Well,' said I, 'they are\r\ncriminals, and it is for the judges to say whether or not they are to be\r\nliberated.' 'I protest,' he exclaimed, 'in the name of England, against\r\ntheir arrest!' 'And I thank you,' said I, 'in the name of the Serbian\r\npolice, for having brought them here.' 'You are a savage, a barbarous\r\nnation!' said he, 'and you don't deserve to be free and independent.'\r\n'Sir,' said I, 'if you are an Englishman you should know that we are\r\nyour allies, that you and we have shed our blood for the common cause.\r\nWe love England very much, and I am very surprised to hear a British\r\nofficer speak in this way.' Again he demanded to be set free, he and all\r\nhis people, so that he could continue his mission; but I told him that\r\nafter what I had heard from him and what I had seen of his escort, I\r\ncould not permit him to go on to other villages unless he could show me\r\nan authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Belgrade. 'I do\r\nnot recognize the Belgrade Government,' said he. 'Whom, then,' I asked,\r\n'do you regard as the legitimate ruler of this country?' 'King\r\nNicholas,' said he, 'and the Government of Montenegro.' So I advised him\r\nto get a visa from King Nicholas and to come back to perform his\r\nmission, when that visa would be honoured. 'Anyhow,' said he, 'the\r\npeople of these parts are against Serbia.' Thereupon I sent for the\r\nchief men and told them to say quite candidly in front of this\r\nEnglishman what they wanted. There were five Moslems, including Islam\r\nand Abdi Beg Rejepagi['c] (the leading family) and Ismael Omeragi['c],\r\nalso two Christians, of whom I remember Stani[vc]a Turkovi['c]. 'Long\r\nlive Serbia!' they shouted. 'Death to Nicholas and the Albanians!' On\r\nhearing this Captain Brodie was discontented; he told me that I was a\r\nsavage and did not know how to esteem an Englishman. 'I esteem you very\r\nmuch,' said I, 'and because he is wearing a British uniform I won't\r\narrest this interpreter of yours.' (By the way, Perola was not acting as\r\ninterpreter in our conversation, as the captain and I were talking\r\nFrench.) 'He used to be an Austrian agent,' said I. 'You are a liar!'\r\ncried Brodie; 'I know this man; he was nothing of the sort.' I remained\r\ncalm, but I told him that he must not speak to me again in such a way. I\r\nasked him how long he had known Perola, who had got away from our prison\r\na month ago. 'I have known him for a month,' said Brodie. 'And now,'\r\nsaid I, 'will you please show me your documents?' 'I have none,' said\r\nhe, 'and I do not require any, as I am a British officer.' 'But I have\r\nread in the papers,' said I, 'that your people arrested and shot several\r\npersons who were wearing the uniform of a British officer. If you have\r\nno documents to prove that you are not a spy and that you are a British\r\nofficer I shall have to arrest you.' Then he showed me one with some\r\nItalian words on it, I think a permission to go somewhere on the Piave\r\nfront. 'From now,' said I, 'you are arrested; no one can come to you and\r\nyou cannot leave this house. Prepare yourself to start to-morrow or the\r\nday after, if you are tired, for Pe['c], and perhaps Skoplje, so that\r\nyou may prove your identity.' He protested, and declared that he must\r\nsee the people in the neighbouring villages. 'If you are a real\r\nEnglishman,' said I, 'I could not allow you to go by yourself, since\r\nthere are many Moslems in these parts who have been excited against\r\nEngland by their hodjas, owing to your war with Turkey. They might kill\r\nyou, and I would be held responsible; so that even if you had the\r\nnecessary documents I could only let you go if precautions were taken to\r\nguard you. I am sorry,' said I, 'that you should have spoken as you have\r\ndone against the Serbs; in fact, it seems to me that you are doing a\r\ndisservice to England, and that here in this village I am serving her\r\nmore truly.' 'I decline to go to Pe['c],' said Brodie; 'I want to go to\r\nScutari.' 'You must go to Pe['c],' said I. He said that I could\r\ntelephone concerning him either to the Belgrade Government or to the\r\nGeneral at Cetinje. 'Unfortunately,' said I, 'it is these people who are\r\nwith you who cut the telephone wires two days ago.' After this I\r\nappointed a guard for him. I gave him my room, with soldiers to serve\r\nhim, to keep the room warm and bring him whatever food we had. [Observe\r\nthat the above-mentioned Captain Willett Cunnington wrote in the _New\r\nStatesman_ that Brodie was treated with \"gross indignity.\"] 'Three\r\nhorses were got ready,' said Ra[vc]i['c] in conclusion, 'and on these\r\nthey rode to Pe['c], accompanied by a guard, both to prevent them from\r\nescaping and from coming to harm.'\"[87]\r\n\r\nIn its old Albanian days the village of Gusinje was perhaps the most\r\ninaccessible spot in Europe--it was rarely possible for anyone to obtain\r\npermission to approach it. Even to Miss Durham, friend of the\r\nAlbanians, this people sent a decided refusal. But now, under the\r\nguidance of the Yugoslav authorities, they have abandoned these boorish\r\nways; Miss Durham could go there at any time, but maybe the village no\r\nlonger attracts her.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. A DIGRESSION ON TWO RIVAL ALBANIAN AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n[We have more than once alluded to the writings of Miss Durham, since\r\nvery few British authors have dealt with Albania, and she has come to be\r\nregarded as a trustworthy expert. But the flagrant partiality of her\r\nlatest book (_Twenty Years of Balkan Tangle_; London, 1920), which,\r\nmoreover, is written with great bitterness, will make the public turn, I\r\nhope, to Sir Charles Eliot, who is a vastly better cicerone. The present\r\nambassador in Japan is, of course, one of the foremost men of this\r\ngeneration. His Balkan studies are as supremely competent as his\r\nmonumental work on British Nudibranchiate Mollusca, published by the Ray\r\nSociety when Sir Charles, having resigned the Governorship of East\r\nAfrica, was Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield University. Equally admired are\r\nhis researches into Chinese linguistics and his monograph, the first in\r\nthe language, on that most obscure subject, Finnish grammar.[88] Will it\r\nbe believed that in her account of the Balkan tangle Miss Durham does\r\nnot quote Sir Charles Eliot, but Mr. Horatio Bottomley? It seems that\r\nMr. Bottomley has not devoted much attention to the Balkans, since in\r\nNovember 1920 he poured the vials of his wrath upon the Serbs, who,\r\naccording to his \"latest reports from Montenegro,\" had destroyed no less\r\nthan 4000 Montenegrin houses in the district of Dibra, a place which\r\nlies some 75 miles by road from the land of the Black Mountain and\r\nprobably does not possess more than two or three Montenegrin houses; but\r\nhe flings hard words against the Serbs, and that is good enough for Miss\r\nDurham. On the other hand, Sir Charles Eliot, who has travelled largely\r\nin Albania, wrote the simple facts about that people and they are\r\nobnoxious to this lady. \"It is not surprising to find that there is no\r\nhistory of Albania, for there is no union between North and South, or\r\nbetween the different northern tribes and the different southern Beys,\"\r\nsaid he in 1900, and such a people does not undergo a fundamental change\r\nin twenty years. \"Only two names,\" says Eliot, \"those of Skanderbeg and\r\nAli Pasha of Janina, emerge from the confusion of justly unrecorded\r\ntribal quarrels.... Albania presents nothing but oppositions--North\r\nagainst South, tribe against tribe, Bey against Bey.\" (According to Miss\r\nDurham they are all aflame with the desire to form a nation.) \"Even\r\nfamily ties seem to be somewhat weak,\" says Sir Charles, \"for since\r\nEuropean influence has diminished the African slave-trade, Albanians\r\nhave taken to selling their female children to supply the want of\r\nnegroes.\" (The Albanians are \"enterprising and industrious,\" says Miss\r\nDurham.) \"In many ways,\" says Eliot, \"they are in Europe what the Kurds\r\nare in Asia. Both are wild and lawless tribes who inflict much damage on\r\ndecent Turks and Christians alike. Both might be easily brought to\r\nreason by the exhibition of a little firmness.... Albanian patriotism is\r\nnot a home product--had they ever been ready to combine against the Turk\r\nthere seems to be no reason why they should not have preserved the same\r\nkind of independence as Montenegro; but from the first some of the\r\ntribes and clans endeavoured to secure an advantage over the others by\r\nsiding with the invaders--papers and books on the national movement are\r\nwritten at Bucharest, Brussels and various Italian towns, but they are\r\nnot read at Scutari or Janina. The stock grievance of this literature is\r\nthat the Turks will not allow Albanian to be taught in the schools, and\r\nendeavour to ignore the existence of the language; but though the\r\ncomplaint is well-founded, I doubt if the mass of the people have much\r\nfeeling on the subject.\" ... Those who are rash enough to assert,\r\nbecause Miss Durham says so, that in the last two decades the Albanians\r\nhave made a progress of several centuries may be recommended to the\r\ntestimony of Brailsford[89] (1906), of Katarani (1913), and of the\r\nItalian Press which, after the retreat of their army to Valona,\r\npublished in 1920 the most ghastly particulars of what befell the\r\nhapless officers and men who were captured by the Albanians.\r\n\r\nLet the British public henceforth go to Sir Charles Eliot and not to\r\nthis emotional lady for its picture of the unchanged Shqyptar. She\r\nreveals to us that more than one person in the Balkans said that her\r\nknowledge of those countries is enormous; she has knocked about the\r\nwestern Balkans and picked up a good deal of material, but her knowledge\r\nhas its limitations: for example, she makes the old howler of ascribing\r\nMacedonian origin to Pa[vs]i['c], though his grandfather came not from\r\nTetovo in Macedonia but from near Teteven in what is now Bulgaria. Miss\r\nDurham plumes herself for having sent back to Belgrade the Order of St.\r\nSava, and seeing that it is bestowed for learning she did well. But even\r\nif her acquaintance with Balkan affairs were more adequate--her\r\ndiagnosis of the Macedonian racial problem is extremely rough and\r\nready--all the writings of Miss Durham are so warped with hatred for the\r\nSlav that they must be very carefully approached. Because she thinks it\r\nwill incline her readers towards the Albanians she says[90] that they\r\nwere early converts to Christianity. She omits to mention that the\r\nMoslem, on arriving in the Balkans, was able to spread his religion much\r\nmore easily in Albania than anywhere else; and again, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when Constantinople offered many lucrative posts to the Moslem\r\nthere occurred in Albania a great wave of apostasy. Miss Durham speaks\r\nwith pride of the Albanians who during the Great War fought in the\r\nFrench, Italian and American ranks. Would it not be more straightforward\r\nif she added that large numbers were enrolled in the Austro-Hungarian\r\narmy and _gendarmerie_? The special task of the latter was to dislodge\r\nfrom their mountain fastnesses those Montenegrins who continued to carry\r\non a desperate guerilla warfare against the invader. To pretend that the\r\nAlbanian has earned the freedom of his country by his glorious exploits\r\nin the War is an absurdity. He is a mediaeval fellow, much more anxious\r\nto have a head to bash than to ascertain whom it belongs to. The Slavs\r\nhave not always treated their raw neighbours with indulgence; in the\r\nBalkan War, when their army marched through Albania to the sea some very\r\ndiscreditable incidents occurred, whatever may have been the provocation\r\nthey received from the sniping natives and however great be the excuse\r\nof their own state of nerves. Yet the first stone should be flung by\r\nthat army of Western Europe which, in its passage through the territory\r\nof a treacherous and savage people, has done nothing which it would not\r\nwillingly forget. And seriously to argue that the Slavs are of an almost\r\nundiluted blackness, while the Albanians are endearing creatures, is to\r\ntake what anti-feminists would call a feminist view of history. Miss\r\nDurham tells us that some years ago she stood upon a height with an\r\nAlbanian abbot and promised him that she would do all that lay in her\r\npower to bring a knowledge of Albania to the English. The worthy abbot\r\nmay have glanced at her uneasily, but noticing her rapt expression\r\nreassured himself. And she appears to have believed that England,\r\neagerly absorbing what she told them of this people, would in August\r\n1914 make her policy depend on their convenience. But to Miss Durham's\r\nhorror and amazement, Great Britain turned aside from this clear and\r\nhonourable duty. She entered the War as an ally of the Slav, bringing\r\n\"shame and disgust\" upon Miss Durham. \"After that,\" says she, \"I really\r\ndid not care what happened. The cup of my humiliation was full.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. WHAT FACES THE YUGOSLAVS\r\n\r\nIt is not as if Serbia never made mistakes in dealing with the\r\nAlbanians. The Sultan used to govern them by sending in one year an army\r\nagainst them, and in the next year asking for no recruits or taxes. The\r\nMontenegrins, of whom the older generation was bored when it had no man\r\nto shoot at, used to be on very neighbourly terms with them. Both these\r\nsystems the Albanians could understand. But they did not know why the\r\nBelgrade Government in 1878--and it was a mistaken policy--should expel\r\na number of Albanians from the newly-won zones, thrusting them across\r\nthe frontier and putting in their place a number of Serbs who were\r\nsettled in Old Serbia. The twofold folly of this plan was not grasped at\r\nthe moment; but for several years the Serbian frontier districts were\r\nregularly invaded and plundered. The following years of Turkish misrule,\r\nand especially the young Turkish policy of treacherous force, which\r\nresulted in Albanian risings every year, may possibly have caused many\r\nAlbanians to be honestly glad when the Balkan War brought the Serbs into\r\ntheir country. But of these Albanians not a few would rejoice because\r\nthey hoped that with the help of the Serbian army it would be possible\r\nto slay the members of some adjacent tribe against whom they happened to\r\nhave a feud. Perhaps the Serbs were so eager to bathe their horses in\r\nthe Adriatic that they did not notice such trifles as the destruction of\r\na ford, this having been done to prevent a visit from undesirable\r\nneighbours. One might have imagined that Serbia, being well known as a\r\nland of small peasant proprietors--where there is even a law which\r\nforbids a peasant's house from being sold over his head; he is, under\r\nany circumstances, assured of so much as will enable him to eke out a\r\nlivelihood--one would have thought that the Albanian _[vc]if[vc]ija_,\r\nwho is nothing more than a slave of the feudal chief, would have\r\nrejoiced at the arrival of a liberator; and indeed, while the Serbian\r\ntroops were in Albania the peasant refused to give his lord the\r\ncustomary third or half of what the land produced, and after the\r\ndeparture of the Serbs he was unapproachable for tax-collectors. Who\r\nknows whether this social readjustment, so auspiciously begun, might not\r\nhave made Albania wipe out her grievances against the Serbs and remember\r\nonly that in the Imperial days of Du[vs]an, even if he was not of the\r\nmost ancient Balkan race, there was prosperity and happiness where now\r\nis desolation; busy merchants in the seaport towns of Albania, which\r\nnow are ruins; ships sailing in from Venice with the luxuries of all\r\nthe world and taking back with them all those good things, a half of\r\nwhich Albania has forgotten how to make? And after that there had been\r\ntimes of friendship with the Serb--Dositej Obradovi['c], the philologist\r\n(one of those amiable persons who invented for the Albanians an\r\nalphabet), tells us, for instance, how in his travels through Albania he\r\nwas assured by natives that they and the Serbs lived together as if they\r\nwere members of one family, while the Ku['c]i in eastern Montenegro had,\r\nby a gradual process of assimilation, become transformed from Catholic\r\nAlbanians into Orthodox Montenegrins. It is told that in the wondrous\r\nhours when the _[vc]if[vc]ija_ gloried in the soil he was about to win,\r\neven the notoriously wild Klementi, filled with hunger for the land, ran\r\ndown from their fastnesses. But, most unfortunately, at that moment the\r\nGreat Powers decided that Albania was to be an autonomous, hereditary\r\nState. This interrupted the movement towards reconciliation with Serbia;\r\nand even now the Serbs will be told by many encouraging people that in\r\ntheir efforts to win the regard of Albanians they have an impossible\r\ntask, that if some of them take a step towards you one day they will\r\nrush back a dozen on the day after. These people will repeat the legend\r\nthat the Albanians have an invincible hatred for the Slavs; but the\r\nAlbanians have not forgotten how, in the course of the Middle Ages, they\r\nwere willingly open to Slav penetration--the Serbian language reached to\r\nbeyond Alessio, the small Albanian dynasties intermarried with Slav\r\nruling families, so that they preferred to speak Serbian, and down to\r\nthis day two-thirds of the place-names of northern Albania are of Slav\r\norigin. One of the most important documents in this connection is a\r\nletter from the town of Dubrovnik to the Emperor Sigismund in the year\r\n1434. They inform the Emperor that Andria Topia, lord of the Albanian\r\ncoast, has secretaries who know nothing but the Serbian language and\r\nalphabet. Thus when the Emperor sends him letters in Latin he is obliged\r\nto have them translated elsewhere, and the contents of the Imperial\r\nletters are not kept secret. So the Emperor was forced to write to Topia\r\nin Serbian.... Long memories are not always inconvenient, and Albanian\r\nmemories are long because, until recent years, all that they knew came\r\nfrom tradition--Austria and Italy had not yet become so concerned about\r\nAlbanian education that (forgetting their own illiterates in Bosnia and\r\nCalabria) the two Allies waved into existence boys' and girls' schools\r\nup and down the country; so desirous were they that these founts of\r\nknowledge should be patronized that both Italians and Austrians were\r\nprepared to pay good money and eke a supply of garments and a\r\ngaily-coloured picture of King or Emperor, as the case might be; and\r\nwith respect to the cash, not only was each willing to pay but to pay\r\nmore than the other. Yet the Albanian is most mindful of tradition, and\r\nhe is aware that his approach to the Slav in the Middle Ages was blocked\r\nby the inopportune arrival of the Turks; it is in the nature of man that\r\nthe Albanian was more impressed by the brilliant young States of the\r\nearly princes, with that barbarically sumptuous residence at Scutari\r\n(the Catholics of Scutari also being in the diocese of Antivari, which\r\nwas under Serb domination) than, centuries later, when he found himself\r\nconfronted with the pitiable population of Old Serbia.\r\n\r\nIn the Sandjak the task of Yugoslavia will be relatively simple; the\r\nAlbanians who live there are not autochthonous, but arrived at the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century on the plateau of Pechter. These\r\nKlementi--then very numerous--cared nothing for their Serbian origin, so\r\nthat the Patriarch of Pe['c] had to protect himself against them by\r\nmeans of a janissary guard--which the Sultan permitted him to maintain\r\nat his own expense--whereas they were attentive to the teachings of\r\ntheir religion, in so far as they obeyed the Catholic missionaries who\r\ndwelt among them and requested that in their forays they should confine\r\nthemselves to Muhammedan and Orthodox booty. One of the places they\r\nattacked was Plav, from which they drove the population, and themselves\r\nhenceforward took to living on the fertile fields in summer, while they\r\nspent the winter in some mountain caverns. But after seven years a large\r\nproportion of this tribe went back to its ancestral stronghold in the\r\nBrdo range, from which the Turks had transplanted them to the Sandjak.\r\nThis wish of theirs to go to their old home was gratified after they\r\nhad beaten off the Turks triumphantly in various engagements on the way,\r\nand even pursued them to their trenches.... The Klementi who had stayed\r\non the Pechter were further depleted a few years later, when their\r\nkinsfolk, answering the appeal of the Archbishop of Antivari, rode up\r\nthere and carried off fifty families who were on the eve of renouncing\r\ntheir religion. The final group which remained became Moslem, and with\r\nsuch ardour that when the Serbs of Kara George reached the Sandjak they\r\nfound that these Klementi were completely Islamized; they resisted the\r\nSerbian army with the utmost resolution. Subsequently they attempted to\r\nconvert the Serbian population round them, but with mediocre success,\r\nfor the Klementi themselves were not too strong; moreover, they were\r\nisolated from the other Muhammedan Albanians.\r\n\r\nAnd yet certain incidents which occurred in the Sandjak during the Great\r\nWar seem to show that even there the task of dealing with the population\r\nis a troublous one. They are conservative; one sees, for example, a\r\nwoman who has got up very early holding aloft a vessel against the sun.\r\nThis is done with the object of preventing the cows of a certain man\r\nfrom giving any milk. But the man is on the alert. He shoots the vessel\r\nout of her hand and proceeds, with an easy mind, about his business.\r\nFrequently the Austrians disarmed these men, but it is their practice to\r\nhave more rifles than shirts, although during the occupation a rifle\r\ncost twenty napoleons. It occurred to the Austrian Governor-General of\r\nMontenegro, Lieut. Field-Marshal von Weber, that these Albanians were\r\nchildren and, if treated well, would make useful volunteers. A party of\r\nthem was thereupon sent to Graz, where they were told that they would be\r\ntrained to fight on behalf of the Sultan. Their military education was a\r\ntrifle agitated--for instance, on their second day at Graz they thrashed\r\ntheir officers--but when their training was considered adequate they\r\nwere sent to the front, and there they immediately surrendered to the\r\nItalians. This was not the first time that a body of Albanians had gone\r\nto Austria. In 1912, for the Eucharistic Congress at Vienna, some two\r\ndozen of them, in their national costume and conducted by their\r\npriests, had taken part in the procession. It is said that the financier\r\nRosenberg, of whom one has heard, bore a portion of the pretty large\r\nexpenses of the deputation. His title of baron dates from this period.\r\nAustria's work among the school-children was no more successful than\r\namong the adults. Remembering that just outside Zadar lies Arbanasi, or\r\nBorgo Erizzo, a village of 2500 inhabitants, nearly all of whom are\r\nAlbanians, it seemed good to the Austrian authorities to procure from\r\nthat place a schoolmaster who would make suitable propaganda. There was\r\nat Arbanasi a teachers' institute, as also an Italian \"Liga\" school\r\nwhich was closed by the Austrians during the War, and when the\r\nschoolmaster arrived at Plav, where the people speak Serbian, he set\r\nabout teaching the children Albanian and also making propaganda for\r\nItaly, as he was from the \"Liga\" school.... That fidelity of the five\r\nhundred men of Plav who clung, as we have related, to their religion,\r\nhad its pendant when the Austrians were engaged in constructing a road.\r\nThe custom was for a potentate of that district to procure for the\r\nAustrians a sufficient number of men, to whom three or four crowns a day\r\nwould be paid. Any man who disregarded the potentate's summons was\r\nthrashed by him, and thrashed in such a way that for three days he was\r\nprostrate. The late Chief of Police at Sarajevo, Mr. Ljescovac, was\r\n(being a Bosnian subject) administering this district during the\r\nAustrian occupation. He tried frequently to get particulars from the men\r\nwho had been so mercilessly flogged, with a view to opening an inquiry.\r\nTheir invariable answer was: \"I know nothing.\"\r\n\r\nIn the days of Charles, another member of the Topia family, a copyist,\r\nwho was in his service, was transcribing the Chronicle of George\r\nHamartolos, and twice, thinking of his master, he inserts: \"God, help\r\nCharles Topia.\" As we leave the Serb and the Albanian face to face,\r\nsensitive, imaginative, tenacious people, both with very ancient claims,\r\nwe must hope that a happy solution will be found. After all Serbia,\r\nbeing in Yugoslavia, is now a Muhammedan and a Catholic Power. She has\r\nmen at her disposal, such as Major Musakadi['c], a Bosnian Moslem who\r\ndeserted from the Austrian army to the Serbs, fought with them on\r\nseveral fronts and received the highest decoration for valour, the Kara\r\nGeorge; then, after the War, he was sent by the Government to command at\r\nBr['c]ko, a place in his native Bosnia where there is a Moslem majority.\r\nA few of the Orthodox protested energetically that they would not have a\r\nMoslem over them; they were received by the Minister of Justice in\r\nBelgrade. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"go back to Br['c]ko and when anyone of\r\nyou has earned the Cross of Kara George I shall be glad to see him here\r\nagain.\" ... As in the old days, the Serbian civilization is far\r\nsuperior, but this is not everything; that the Albanian is ready to meet\r\nit with peace or war he shows clearly as he glides along in his white\r\nskull-cap, his close-fitting white and black costume, with his\r\npanther-like tread and with several weapons and an umbrella.\r\n\r\nBut for the various reasons to which we have alluded he is now much more\r\ninclined to live in peace with the Yugoslav. Very differently, except if\r\nthey are charged with gifts, does he receive the Italians; even at the\r\nmoment of accepting their gifts of military material and cash he regards\r\nthem with a more or less concealed derision, for he is impressed, as we\r\nhave pointed out, by nothing so much as by military prowess and the\r\nreverse, whereof the news is carried far and wide. At the end of\r\nSeptember and beginning of October 1918 two weak Yugoslav battalions of\r\nabout a thousand rifles accomplished at Tirana what the large Italian\r\nforces could not, at any rate did not, achieve. Ten thousand Austrians\r\nwere in the town, and for three months the Italians had sat down outside\r\nit. Then the Serbs descended on the place from the mountains; their\r\ncarts came by the ordinary road, and on arriving at the Italian lines\r\nthe drivers asked for hay; but when they explained that the rest of\r\ntheir force was going round by the mountain trail the Italian commandant\r\nrefused to give any supplies to such liars. (Later on, though, he gave\r\nthem sufficient for five days.) When an Austrian officer who was\r\nstationed in a minaret saw the Serbs coming down from those terrible\r\nheights he was so astonished that he felt sure they must be robbers. And\r\nafter they had captured the town and the Italians conducted themselves\r\nas if it were they who had conquered it, the Serbs took to thrashing\r\ntheir allies and ejecting them from the cafes. The Italians did not\r\nprotest....\r\n\r\n\r\n10. DR. TRUMBI['C]'S PROPOSAL\r\n\r\nTo sum up this part of our long and, I fear, rather tiring dissertation\r\non the Yugoslav-Albanian frontier that is to be: the Yugoslav delegates\r\nat the Peace Conference invariably disclaimed any desire to have\r\nAlbanian lands conferred on them against the wish of the inhabitants.\r\nAccording to Prince Sixte of Parma, the ex-Emperor Karl was disposed to\r\noffer to the Serbs as a basis of peace a Southern Slav kingdom\r\nconsisting of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina and the whole of\r\nAlbania. But this last item only made it clear that in his brief tenure\r\nof the throne the Emperor had grasped something of the grand generosity\r\nof European statesmen when they deal with the possessions of other\r\npeople in the Near East. The Albanians are not Southern Slavs, and it is\r\nmerely the voice of the thoughtless mob in Montenegro which has been\r\nclaiming Scutari for the reason that they held it in the Middle\r\nAges--several of their rulers are buried there--and because 20,000\r\nMontenegrins gave their lives to take it in the Balkan War. Responsible\r\npersons in Yugoslavia, such as Dr. Trumbi['c], the former Foreign\r\nMinister, do not believe that Scutari is a necessity for their\r\nState--whether Yugoslavia is a necessity for Scutari is another\r\nquestion--and they hold that it is quite possible to preserve the 1913\r\nfrontier (perhaps with a minor rectification in Klementi) and live in\r\nfriendship with their neighbours. This, of course, is under the\r\nassumption that these neighbours will \"play the game\"--and it is just\r\nthis which the Albanians will be unable to do if they are left to their\r\nown slender resources. How could one expect so poor--or shall we say so\r\nunexploited?--a country to make any social progress without the help of\r\nothers? It has become the habit of many Albanians to accept financial\r\nassistance from Italy; if an independent Albania is now established\r\nthese subsidies will be increased--and he who pays the piper calls the\r\ntune. If, however, an arrangement could be made for helping the\r\nAlbanians--and the country undertaking this would have to be devoid of\r\nBalkan ambitions on its own account--then the 1913 frontier would be\r\npossible. No doubt the cynics will say that the Yugoslavs are aware that\r\nthis is an unlikely solution, and that failing a disinterested Power,\r\nwhose supervision would cause the Albanians during the troublesome\r\ncivilizing process to be moderately peaceable neighbours, failing such a\r\nPower the Yugoslavs would feel that they were justified in asking for\r\nthe frontier of the Drin. But this frontier I have heard advocated less\r\nby Yugoslavs of any standing than by those Albanians who despair of the\r\nadministrative capacities of their fellow-countrymen. The Yugoslavs have\r\nnot the smallest wish to add to their commitments, and even if all the\r\nAlbanians on the right bank of the Drin were anxious for Yugoslav\r\noverlordship--and this, naturally, is not the case--there would be\r\nserious hostility to be expected from some of those on the other bank.\r\nIf no disinterested Power, such as Great Britain or Sweden, will take\r\nthe matter in hand, then Dr. Trumbi['c] has an alternative proposal,\r\nwhich is for a free, independent Albania (with the 1913 frontier) which\r\nwould exist on the Customs and on a loan made by the Great Powers, who\r\nwould put in a Controller charged with seeing that the money were spent\r\non roads, schools, etc. A police force, and not an army, would be\r\nmaintained; while, if need be, the country could be neutralized; and Dr.\r\nTrumbi['c], within whose lifetime bandits and heiduks were roaming\r\nthrough Bosnia, believes that the Albanians would gradually discard\r\ntheir cherished system of feuds.... This would be the happiest solution,\r\nfor it would leave the Balkans to the Balkan peoples, while it would aim\r\nat the development of whatever good qualities there are in the\r\nAlbanians, and it would definitely recognize a Yugoslav-Albanian\r\nfrontier which is acceptable to both countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. THE POSITION IN 1921: THE TIRANA GOVERNMENT AND THE MIRDITI\r\n\r\nWhile Europe in the year 1921 was either exhausted or belligerent, or\r\nboth, she had a vague knowledge that hostilities were being carried on\r\nbetween the Serbs and the Albanians. Telegrams from Rome, Tirana and\r\nelsewhere appeared in the papers, saying that the Serbs continued to\r\nadvance. Occasionally a Serbian statesman would declare that his\r\nGovernment desired the independence of Albania. Then some Albanian\r\ndelegate in Geneva would make a protest and ask the League of Nations,\r\nof which Albania was now a member, to take this matter in hand. A\r\nSerbian delegate would also address the League. Again you would hear of\r\nthe Serbian army pushing forward, that a good many soldiers had fallen.\r\nAnd no one seemed to know why the Serbs would want to shed their blood\r\nin order to add to their miscellaneous problems this very grave one of\r\nadministering such a region inhabited by such a people. Why did they not\r\ncontent themselves with the frontier which the Powers temporarily\r\nassigned to them in 1918 and which, from the junction of the Black and\r\nWhite Drin, runs south along the rocky right bank of the river and then,\r\ncrossing to the other side, passes along the top of a range of\r\nmountains? What more could they wish to have, presuming that it was not\r\ntheir intention to annex what lay between them and the Adriatic?\r\n\r\nWell, it appears that never once did they go beyond the aforementioned\r\nline to which they were legally entitled, except when for a short time\r\nthey were in pursuit, towards Ljuria, of certain invaders. Not only were\r\nthey legally entitled to take up their position on the mountains to the\r\nwest of the Black Drin, but the Moslem tribes, the Malizi and the Ljuri,\r\nwho dwell in that uninviting district, were most anxious that the Serbs\r\nshould come and should remain. For this the tribes had two principal\r\nreasons: in the first place, they recognized that their compatriots in\r\nDjakovica and Prizren were immeasurably better off than before they came\r\nunder Serbian rule; and secondly, they did not wish to be separated from\r\nthese towns which are their markets. In fact, they had become so anxious\r\nto throw in their lot with the Slavs that they formed six battalions,\r\nwhich operated on both banks of the river, under the command of Bairam\r\nRamadan, Mahmoud Rejeb and others. In opposition to these battalions\r\nwere the troops of the so-called National Government, that of Tirana.\r\nThis Government is repudiated by a great many Albanians on account of\r\nits reactionary methods, its subservience to the Italians, and its\r\nfailure to do anything for the people. The battalions, then, were\r\nengaged in 1921, not against their immediate neighbours to the west, the\r\nCatholic Mirditi, of whom we shall speak anon, but against the more\r\ndistant Government of Tirana. Thus the League of Nations beheld that the\r\nadministration which they were about to confirm as the legitimate\r\nGovernment of Albania was violently opposed by compact masses of\r\nCatholics and Moslems. Perhaps some of the members of the League began\r\nto doubt whether they should have accepted the assurance of the\r\nAnglo-Albanian Society that the Tirana Government (containing Moslem,\r\nCatholic and Orthodox members) was really a national affair; perhaps\r\nthey began to suspect that the two Christian elements were only there to\r\nthrow a little dust in the eyes of Europe; and perhaps Lord Robert Cecil\r\nbegan to feel doubtful whether, at the urgent request of his friend Mr.\r\nAubrey Herbert, President of the Anglo-Albanian Society, he had been\r\nwell advised to bring about the admission into the League of a country\r\nwhich had two simultaneous Governments before it had a frontier. Perhaps\r\none was beginning to recognize that there are Albanians but no Albania.\r\n\r\nThe emissaries of Tirana might depict as of no importance the\r\nhostilities that were being waged against them by those Moslem tribes,\r\nthey might tell the League of Nations that the Mirdite revolution was\r\nnot worth considering. It is a fact that the Mirditi are not very\r\nnumerous, but in close connection with their 18,000 people are the Shala\r\nwith 500 houses and the Shoshi with 300. Tradition has it that they are\r\ndescended from three brothers who set out from the arid village of\r\nShiroka on Lake Scutari to seek their fortune. The most ancient, the\r\nmost noble and important family of northern Albania is that of\r\nGjomarkaj, whose seat is at Oroshi, the capital of the Mirditi. Despite\r\nenormous difficulties they succeeded in maintaining their own position\r\nand the prestige of the Mirditi. They refused to recognize the Turkish\r\nGovernment and clung so tenaciously to their own usages and laws, and\r\nwere so famous for their courage that the Sultans were eager to grant\r\nthem privileges and concessions. Thereafter they promised to assist the\r\nSultan against external aggression, and always did so with great\r\nsuccess. It was due to the Mirditi that the Albanian mountaineers\r\npreserved their nationality, their religion and their customs, for they\r\nwere ever the leaders of the other Albanian tribes. The most prominent\r\nof the Mirditi in our time have been Prenk Bib Doda, who, after long\r\nyears of exile, was assassinated in Albania; Mark Djoni, now the\r\nPresident of the Mirdite Republic; and, above all, the great Abbot\r\nMonsignor Primo Doci, a man of vast culture, who returned to his own\r\ncountry after serving the Vatican as a diplomat in various parts of the\r\nworld. It is not surprising that the educational standard of his native\r\nland filled him with the determination to build schools and that, owing\r\nto his efforts, the Roman Catholic establishment of thirty native\r\npriests and of bishops who were nearly all foreigners has developed into\r\na body of almost three hundred native priests with no foreign bishops. A\r\npoet himself, he founded the literary society, _Bashkimi l'unione_, in\r\nwhich all capable patriots were invited to collaborate. He constructed\r\nmore than twenty strongholds in and around Oroshi, and when he died in\r\nFebruary 1917 it was largely owing to the persecution which he suffered\r\nat the hands of the Austrians. What has latterly aroused his faithful\r\npeople is the persecution levelled at them by the Moslem-Italian\r\nGovernment of Tirana.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of mystery envelopes the death of Bib Doda; an opinion\r\nwidely held is that Italians were responsible, but Mr. H. E. Goad\r\nrebukes me in the _Fortnightly Review_ for not knowing that the Italians\r\nlaid aside the crude methods of political murder centuries ago. Perhaps\r\nhe doesn't regard the massacre of the helpless French soldiers at Rieka\r\nin 1919 as political murder, since they were only privates; perhaps he\r\ndoesn't count that famous expedition of the five lieutenants to\r\nassassinate Zanella, because it was unsuccessful; but he may be right\r\nconcerning Bib Doda. That personage had been to Durazzo to confer with\r\nthe Italians; he had refused to accept an Italian protectorate in\r\nAlbania, and on his return he was killed in his carriage before he could\r\nreach Scutari. The chief assailant was a Catholic of Klementi, believed\r\nto be an adherent of Essad Pasha and also an Italian \"agent\r\nd'occasion.\" Yet as several Italian soldiers who accompanied Bib Doda\r\nwere wounded it would seem that those, myself included, who believed\r\nthat this affair had been arranged by the Italians were wrong.\r\n\r\nAs for Bib Doda's fortune, Mr. Goad asserts that by Albanian law he did\r\nnot have to leave it to his nearest kinsman, Marko Djoni. That is, I beg\r\nto say, precisely what he had to do according to the custom of their\r\nancient family. Mr. Goad says that the cash went to the poor; I say that\r\na good deal of it went into the pocket of a lady who was much younger\r\nthan the dead man and was on excellent terms with an Italian major. If\r\nMr. Goad had visited Albania at that time and had been interested in\r\nother things besides what he tells us of--the moonlight of Klisura and\r\nthe splendid plane trees over the Vouissa and the sunrise reflected on\r\nthe gleaming mountain-wall of the Nemorica--I would not have to tell him\r\nall this about Bib Doda's money. He says that Marko Djoni is a\r\ndiscredited, disgruntled person who became a tool of the Serbs and fled\r\nto Serbia. But he forgets that Bib Doda was killed in March 1919, and\r\nthat until May 1921 Marko Djoni remained in Albania, enjoying the\r\nfriendship of Italy rather than that of Serbia. In fact it was not easy\r\nfor him to abandon this friendship, owing to various deals in connection\r\nwith the Mirdite forests. No doubt he resented the loss of his heritage;\r\nbut why in the name of goodness should not he and his followers fight\r\nfor their liberty, and why should the Serbs not help them at a time when\r\nthe frontiers of Albania had not been fixed nor the Government\r\nofficially recognized? The Serbs were helping him to make war, says Mr.\r\nGoad, against his legitimate rulers. Yet we must be lenient with our Mr.\r\nGoad, for he himself admits that \"few can write of Balkan politics\r\nwithout revealing symptoms of that partisan disease.\" He has made up his\r\nmind that the Serbs are the villains of the piece, and there, for him,\r\nis the end of it.\r\n\r\nA delegation from the Mirditi, consisting of the Rev. Professor Anthony\r\nAchikou and Captain Dod Lleche, came to Geneva in October 1921, and\r\nrequested the League not to issue a confirmation of the Tirana\r\nGovernment. They showed that this Government had no other aim than to\r\nturn Albania into a small Turkey. No doubt the Moslems, as the most\r\nnumerous element, had a right to have a majority in the Cabinet, but\r\nthere was no justification in their appointment of pure Turks. (The\r\nTirana Government proposed in the autumn of 1921 that any Albanian\r\ncoming from Turkey, who has held a public office there, shall be refused\r\nadmittance into the Albanian Administration until two years after his\r\nreturn. This is a proposal but not yet, I believe, an effective law.)\r\nThe Minister of Justice has been old Hodja Kadri, and the Minister of\r\nWar one Salah el Din Bey, an officer of Kemal Pasha, and neither of\r\nthese was acquainted with the Albanian language. When the Mirditi\r\nstarted to show their dislike of this Government, the War Minister\r\ncommanded his troops to slay without mercy anyone who dared to raise his\r\nvoice. Thus it came about that the villages of Oroshi, Laci, Gomsice and\r\nNaraci were destroyed, while those of the inhabitants who could escape\r\nfled across the frontier to Serbia. As for particular cases of iniquity\r\nwe may instance that of the Moslem officer, Chakir Nizami, who, as a\r\nmanifestation of his hatred for the Christians, had violated at Scutari\r\na girl of fourteen whose name was Chakya Hil Paloks. He was sentenced by\r\nthe French military authorities and was liberated by the Minister of\r\nJustice as soon as the French had quitted Scutari. On the other hand,\r\nKol Achikou, a brother of the delegate, had killed a Moslem in\r\nself-defence and been acquitted by the French court martial; after their\r\ndeparture he was taken to Tirana and sentenced to death. But apart from\r\nall such misdeeds the Mirditi complained that the Tirana Government,\r\nwhich could not openly wage war with Serbia, had organized the \"Kossovo\"\r\nCommittee, whose object it was to foment trouble in Serbia and to send\r\narmed bands of marauders on to Serbian territory. At the very moment\r\nwhen the delegation was at Geneva, one of these bands (in the night\r\nbetween October 12 and 13) raided the village of Moji[vs]te, near\r\nGostivar. Furnished with Italian machine guns and bombs they came over\r\nthe mountains, set fire to the village and killed many of the people as\r\nthey fled. They are accustomed on such expeditions to steal the children\r\nand hold them to ransom--a lucrative operation which d'Annunzio's\r\narditi[91] may have copied from their Albanian colleagues. It would\r\nseem, then, according to the statement of the Mirditi, that in the\r\nconflict on the Black Drin, of which Europe had vaguely heard, the\r\nTirana Government and not that of Serbia was the aggressor. Mr. Aubrey\r\nHerbert may write pathetic letters to the Press, Miss Durham may write\r\nletters of indignation, but how could their proteges of Tirana be said\r\nto be valiantly defending themselves against the wicked Serbs when the\r\nvery villages which, said Mr. Herbert, were destroyed--Aras and Dardha\r\nand so forth--were situated in the district to which the Serbs were\r\nlegally entitled?\r\n\r\nThe Mirditi delegates had an interview in Geneva with Lord Robert Cecil.\r\nAn attempt was made by the Tirana delegates to discredit Professor\r\nAchikou, by publishing a telegram from Monsignor Sereggi, the Archbishop\r\nof Scutari (but which the Professor accused the rival delegate, the\r\nbearded, bustling Father Fan Noli, of having composed himself),[92] and\r\nin that message it was stated that Achikou was expelled from Albania.\r\nThis he did not deny; he was, he said, one of 4000 who had been driven\r\nout by an arbitrary Government and he hoped that they would soon be able\r\nto return. The message called Achikou a traitor; but that is a matter of\r\nopinion. It said that he was in the service of a foreign Power; he\r\nreplied that the Mirditi had never concealed their wish to live in\r\nfriendship with their neighbours, and the proof that they envisaged\r\nnothing more than friendship was that they were petitioning the League\r\nto recognize the Mirdite Republic. Among the other charges against\r\nAchikou was one which said that he was sailing under false colours. This\r\nwas an absurd accusation, and one which enabled the reverend Father to\r\nmention that his opponent Monsignor, who was then being called Bishop,\r\nFan Noli, was neither a bishop nor an Albanian, but a simple priest, a\r\nGreek from Adrianople, whose real name was Theophanus.[93] This clever\r\nman, who had decided to form an Orthodox Albanian Church and had\r\napparently become its bishop without the formality of consecration, had\r\nenjoyed some success at Geneva owing to his knowledge of languages. He\r\ncirculated a telegram from Tirana which purported to be a disavowal of\r\nthe Mirditi delegation by a number of Mirditi notables; but a reply was\r\nsent by Mark Djoni, the President of the Mirdite Republic, an elderly\r\nman of great sagacity and experience, for in Turkish times he had been\r\nchief magistrate of the Mirditi. He pointed out that all the notables\r\nand all the tribal chieftains had gone, like himself, into exile, and\r\nthat the names were those of insignificant persons who had acted under\r\nfear of death. Djoni did not in this telegram allude to the position of\r\nthose Catholic priests and others in northern Albania who support the\r\nTirana Government and its Italian paymasters; some of them may believe\r\nthat they are acting in the interest of their country--to act otherwise\r\nwould be perilous, and everyone seems to know the precise number of\r\nnapoleons a month--ranging from the 150 of an ecclesiastical magnate\r\ndown to 71/2 (the pay of a simple gendarme)--which they are alleged to\r\nreceive. Do they ever think of the starving Italian peasants?\r\n\r\nOn October 7 another telegram was sent from Oroshi (the capital of the\r\nMirditi) to the Tirana Delegation which \"protested energetically against\r\nthe activities of a certain Anthony Achikou.\" Yet, on October 9, an\r\nindividual called Notz Pistuli, who had travelled specially from\r\nScutari, presented himself at the Mirdite delegates' hotel, and in the\r\nname of the Scutari National Council asked whether a reconciliation\r\ncould not be made between the Mirditi and the Tirana Government.[94]\r\nBeing told that the Mirditi would have nothing to do with the Turkish\r\nGovernment of Tirana, he held out hopes that another Government more\r\nrepresentative of Albania would soon be constituted. It was remarkable\r\nthat Tirana should have dispatched this envoy after giving out that the\r\nMirditi were traitors and that their delegates represented nobody.\r\n\r\nLord Robert Cecil did not at first seem to think that their desire for a\r\nrepublic independent of Tirana could be gratified, but on being\r\ninitiated into the facts of the case and told that definitely to reject\r\nthem would look as if he were a foe to Christianity, Lord Robert said\r\nthat such was far from being the case. He would do whatever he could to\r\nhelp them. And on the next day it was decided that, in accordance with\r\nthe Mirdite request, a Commission should proceed to Albania.\r\n\r\nThe Italian delegate, Marquis Imperiali, submitted that there was no\r\nneed to hurry this Commission and Monsieur Djoni explained in a\r\ntelegram[95] that if the Commission went forthwith it would discover in\r\nAlbania cannons, rifles and other war material from Italy, that it would\r\nfind numerous Turkish officers of the Kemalist army who had been brought\r\nfrom Asia Minor in Italian ships, and that it would perceive that the\r\ncannons, the Turkish Government of Tirana, the rifles, the Turkish\r\nofficers, certain Catholic ecclesiastics--in a word, the whole of\r\nAlbania such as it is to-day is nothing else, said he, but a masked\r\nItalian instrument of war against Serbia--while all the bloody\r\nconsequences of this perpetual struggle have to be endured by the border\r\npopulation.... One afternoon, at the beginning of November, 650 Tirana\r\nsoldiers, pursued by the Mirditi, gave themselves up to the Serbian\r\nauthorities on the Black Drin. They had with them a dozen officers of\r\nwhom two were Italians, and these accounted for themselves by saying\r\nthat they had come out to organize and to lead the Albanian army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, would this be the best solution of the Albanian problem, that the\r\nMirdite Republic and that of Tirana should both be recognized, since it\r\nis quite clear that it would be immoral--and very useless--for Europe to\r\ntry to persuade the Mirditi to place themselves under the Tirana regime?\r\nBut there appears to be no doubt that the Moslems of northern\r\nAlbania--however much they may now sympathize with the Mirditi in their\r\nattitude towards Tirana--would just as strenuously resist their own\r\nincorporation in a Christian Republic.... Down at the bottom of their\r\nhearts all the Albanian delegates who came to Geneva must know that if\r\nan Albanian State is larger than one tribe it will go to pieces.\r\nWhatever good qualities may be latent in the Albanian, he is as\r\nyet--with rare exceptions--in that stage of culture which has no idea of\r\nduty on the part of the State or of duty towards the State. As an\r\nexample of his views on the exercise of authority we may instance the\r\ncase of the 82 Albanians, led by Islam Aga Batusha (of the village of\r\nVoksha), who stopped Pouni[vs]a Ra[vc]i['c] and his companions in the\r\nsummer of 1921 while they were riding one day from Djakovica to Pe['c].\r\nPouni[vs]a enjoys the fullest confidence of the border tribes because he\r\nhas never been known to break his word; they are very conscious that\r\neven their vaunted \"besa\" is not nowadays observed as it was, say fifty\r\nyears ago, for the Austrian and Italian propaganda schools have had an\r\nunfortunate effect. Well, as the 82 sat round Pouni[vs]a and his friends\r\nin the courtyard of a mosque, where they spent the whole day\r\nconfabulating, they said they hoped that he, a just and wise man, would\r\nhelp them; and their principal grievance was that the Serbian police no\r\nlonger allowed them to kill each other. Why should the police interfere\r\nin their private affairs? Recently the police had arrested a man whom\r\none of these protesters wanted to kill, and therefore he thought he\r\nwould have to kill one of the police. Even those who have spent their\r\nlives in Serbia are too often at this stage of development--a few years\r\nago, in the village of Prokuplje, an Albanian assassinated his neighbour\r\nand was sentenced to twenty years' penal servitude. The judge asked the\r\ndead man's brother if he was satisfied. \"No, I am not,\" he answered,\r\n\"because now I shall have to wait twenty years to kill him.\" Their\r\nancient custom of blood-vengeance continues to flourish, though in\r\nSerbia the police and public opinion are against it; thus, at Luka, in\r\nthe department of Pe['c], one Alil Mahmoud was murdered by a Berisha to\r\navenge his uncle, so that now the sons of this Mahmoud propose to kill a\r\nBerisha--not the murderer, but one equal in rank to their late father,\r\nand in consequence Ahmed Beg, son of Murtezza Pasha, of Djakovica, is\r\nafraid to leave his house, which the Serbian police, at his request, is\r\nguarding.\r\n\r\nHow much the Albanian conceives that he owes a duty to the State may be\r\ninstanced by the application of a smuggler that he be granted a permit\r\nto go to Zagreb in order to dispose of 6000 oka[96] of tobacco which he\r\nhad brought over the frontier. He was talking to a Serb who has the\r\nconfidence of the Albanians because he does not treat them as if they\r\nwere Serbs; and when this father confessor advised him to get rid of the\r\ntobacco locally (which he succeeded in doing) the Albanian objected that\r\nthe excise officers gave him constant anxiety, they were thieves who\r\ninsisted on payment being made to them if they came across his\r\nmerchandise. And if it be said that this is too humble a case, we may\r\nmention that of Ali Riza, one of the chief officers of the Tirana army\r\nwhich was last year operating against the Serbs. So indifferent is he as\r\nto the uniform he bears that the year before last, in Vienna, he begged\r\nan influential Serb to recommend him for a lieutenancy in the Serbian\r\narmy. (His request was not granted because it was ascertained that,\r\nbesides being unable to read and write, his work as an Austrian gendarme\r\nhad been more zealous than creditable.)\r\n\r\n\r\n12. SERBIA'S GOOD INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is Europe to do with these wild children of hers?... The\r\ntribes, Catholic and Moslem, who dwell between the Big Drin and the\r\nfrontier allotted to Serbia in 1913, asked the aforesaid Pouni[vs]a in\r\n1919 to intervene in their quarrels; and the result was that a small\r\nnumber of Serbian soldiers were scattered about that country. They were\r\nplaced at the disposal of the chief, whom they assisted in maintaining\r\norder. (Needless to say, they collected no taxes or recruits, and all\r\ntheir supplies came to them from Serbia.) The people were impressed not\r\nonly by the uniform but by the men's conduct. Before going to these\r\nposts--where they were relieved every two or three months--the men were\r\ninstructed with regard to Albanian customs, and no case occurred of any\r\ntransgression. So rigidly did they enforce the precept that anyone who\r\ntried to violate or carry off a woman was, if he persisted, to be shot,\r\nthat last year, at Tropolje in Gashi, when the girl in question was\r\nsaid to be not unwilling, they pursued the abductors, and in the\r\nsubsequent battle there were fatalities on both sides. The Serbian\r\nsoldiers, for whose safety the village was responsible, made themselves\r\nso popular that when the Tirana Government appointed one Niman Feriz to\r\ngo to those parts as sub-prefect he was chased away by the people headed\r\nby the mayor of the Krasnichi, who is a nephew of Bairam Beg Zur, the\r\nilliterate ex-brigand and ex-Minister of War of the Tirana Government.\r\n\r\nLet this system of small Serbian posts be extended over the whole of\r\nnorthern Albania, that is to say, in those districts where the natives\r\nare willing to receive them. After all, the Serbs understand these\r\nneighbours of theirs. Telephones and roads will be built and eventually\r\nthe railway along the Drin. The northern Albanians will then, for the\r\nfirst time, be on the high-road towards peace and prosperity; and if the\r\nrest of Albania has by then attained to anything like this condition\r\neverybody would be glad to see a free and independent Albania.\r\n\r\nNow what prospect is there of the rest of Albania taking any analogous\r\nsteps? If the regions which at present submit to Tirana decline to\r\nmodify their methods, it would seem that warfare between them and their\r\nkinsmen to the north and north-east must continue, and that the\r\nfoundations of a united, free Albania will not yet be laid. One might\r\npresume, from their bellicose attitude, that the Tirana Government\r\n(extending to and including the town of Scutari) is all against a\r\npacific solution; and if one argues that their attitude would be quite\r\ndifferent without the support they receive from Italy, then the Italians\r\nwould doubtless reply that they have as much right to assist the Tirana\r\nAlbanians as Yugoslavia has to assist those of the north.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the case. Between Italy and the Albanians there are no\r\nsuch ancient political and economic ties as between the Albanians and\r\nthe Serbs. The mediaeval connection with Venice has left with many\r\nAlbanians a dolorous memory, for apart from the fact that Venice, as in\r\nDalmatia, was pursuing a merely selfish policy, it was directly due to\r\nher that the Turkish Sultan, in the fifteenth century, was able to\r\nestablish himself in Albania. Thrice his troops had been repelled by\r\nthose of Skanderbeg when the arrangement was made for them to enter the\r\nfortress of Rosafat in Venetian uniforms, and then four hundred years\r\nelapsed before the Sultan's standard was pulled down. In recent times\r\nthe Government of Italy has been furnishing the Shqyptart with schools,\r\nand these were not its only acts of benevolence towards that wretched\r\npeople. They have given schools and rifles and munitions and gold. The\r\nAlbanians were willing to accept this largesse; but that it forged a\r\nlink between patron and client, that it conferred on the Italians any\r\nrights to occupy the country, they denied, and enforced this denial in\r\n1920 at the point of the bayonet. Mr. H. Goad said in the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_ that this remark of mine is quite unhistorical, since Italy,\r\nsays he, \"was in course of withdrawal when certain Albanians, stirred up\r\nas usual by Jugo-Slavs, attacked her retreating troops.\" If the\r\nAlbanians had only known that Italy, despite her having been, says Mr.\r\nGoad, \"supremely useful to Albania,\" had resolved to quit, they would\r\nperhaps have let them go with dignity. But if Mr. Goad will read some of\r\nthe contemporary Italian newspapers he will see that my allusion to the\r\nbayonet was much too mild. Utterly regardless of the fact that the\r\nItalian evacuation was \"according to plan,\" the Shqyptart treated them\r\nabominably--it brought up memories of Abyssinia--or does Mr. Goad deny\r\nthat even a general officer was outraged and blew out his brains? This\r\nAlbanian onslaught was so far from being stirred up by the Yugoslavs\r\nthat, as we have seen,[97] the Belgrade Government refused to furnish\r\nthem with munitions. This is not to say that they did not approve of the\r\nAlbanian push, for they maintain, in spite of Mr. Goad, the principle of\r\n\"The Balkans for the Balkan Peoples.\" If Italy, as our strange publicist\r\nasserts, has a mandate--presumably a moral one--to defend Albania\r\nagainst aggression he will find, I think, that the Yugoslavs heartily\r\nagree with this thesis and that they are also quite determined to defend\r\nAlbania from aggression.... When he asserts that various ties existed\r\nbetween Italy and the Albanians--the Albanian language, the feudal\r\narchitecture, much that is characteristic in Albanian art and so\r\nforth--I would refer him to M. Justin Godart, with whom I am glad for\r\nonce to be in agreement. \"There is no traditional or actual link,\" says\r\nhe, \"between the two countries; if, on account of this geographical\r\nposition, they propose to have commercial relations, then everything has\r\nyet to be established. If there is to be a friendship, we believe that\r\nItaly must do her best to wipe out many memories.... She has not\r\nprofited from the large number of Albanians in her southern provinces in\r\norder to have an Albanian policy.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the magnanimous Italians came back, declaring that on this\r\noccasion they would not occupy the country (except the little island of\r\nSaseno); but that they really could not restrain themselves from\r\nbestowing the schools, the rifles, munitions and gold. Once more the\r\nAlbanians agreed to accept them; they also accepted the Turkish officers\r\nand officials whom the Italian ships brought to them from Asia Minor,\r\nand when their Government became more and more Turkish and more\r\nintractable they found that they had excited the hostility of large\r\nnumbers of their own compatriots. This developed during 1921 into\r\nviolent conflicts; and the bountiful Italians provided the Tirana\r\nGovernment's army with expert tuition. Nevertheless, in the Albanians'\r\nopinion, there are no bonds between the two races, and if the Italians\r\nwould retire from Albania, permitting the Balkans to be for the Balkan\r\npeoples, and if the fanatical Turks went back to Asia Minor, it would\r\nsoon be seen that the present rage between northern and central Albania\r\nwould peter out into the isolated murders which the Albanians have\r\nhitherto been unable to dispense with. Left to themselves the Albanians\r\nof Tirana would eventually ask for some such assistance from Serbia as\r\nthe northern tribes have received; three months after the departure of\r\nthe Italians from Scutari a plebiscite would show that this town, which\r\nhas lately gone so far as to refuse--yes, even her Moslems have\r\nrefused--to fill the depleted ranks of the Tirana forces, was anxious to\r\ncome to a friendly settlement with her Albanian neighbours and the\r\nYugoslavs. This would be a victory of Scutari's common sense over all\r\nthose fanatics and intriguers whose activities involve her death; for\r\nshe cannot possibly thrive if she persists in cutting herself off from\r\nthe hinterland and from the benefits that will accrue from the\r\ncanalization of the Bojana.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Italians--officially or unofficially--will not yet awhile\r\nleave Albania. And how will this retard or modify the reasonableness of\r\nthose parts which acknowledge Tirana? As for the town of Scutari, it is\r\nprobable that if she found herself permanently cut off by the Mirditi\r\nfrom direct communication with Tirana she would allow her incipient\r\nindependence to come more to the surface. With Tirana less capable of\r\nenforcing her behests the Scutarenes would gradually venture to act in\r\ntheir own interests; they would aim at local autonomy within the sphere\r\nof Yugoslav influence and in the same sphere as their markets. It is to\r\nbe hoped that Yugoslavia will be prepared for this, since she does not\r\npossess too many educated citizens who understand the Albanian\r\nmentality. A course of conduct which pays no attention to this would\r\nalienate even the Turks from Podgorica and Dulcigno, whose acquaintance\r\nwith the very language of Albania is so limited. There seems, however,\r\nto be no reason why the mixed population of Albanian Moslems and\r\nCatholics, of Orthodox Serbs and of Moslems who declined to come under\r\nthe all-too-patriarchal rule of Nicholas of Montenegro should not have\r\nthe same happy experience as the inhabitants of Djakovica and Prizren.\r\nLater on the Scutarenes will be called upon to decide whether they\r\nprefer, like those other predominantly Albanian towns, to remain in\r\nYugoslavia or whether they wish to throw in their lot with a free\r\nAlbania, and in that case their town would become the capital of the\r\ncountry. Failing Scutari, the capital would most probably be Oroshi,\r\nwhich is now the capital of the Mirditi.\r\n\r\nAnd why, we may be asked, why should not Tirana be the capital? In the\r\ncentral parts of Albania, in the country round Tirana, where the natives\r\nare derisively called \"llape\" by the warriors of the north and by the\r\ncultured Albanians of the south, we believe that the assistance of Italy\r\nwill be unable to prevent a collapse. (It must also be remembered that\r\nthe people of the district of Tirana are, for the most part, in\r\nopposition to the present Tirana Government. This became clear when the\r\npartisans of Essad Pasha's policy[98] overthrew and imprisoned the\r\nTirana Ministers.) Economically and morally Tirana will decline, until\r\nshe is compelled to seek a union with the people of northern Albania,\r\nthose of the south having meanwhile gravitated towards Greece. Then the\r\nmoment will arrive when the north and the south, in their task of\r\nbuilding up a free and united Albania, will admit the centre under\r\nvarious conditions. These will have to be of a rather stern character,\r\nor so at any rate they will seem to the folk of Tirana: taxes will have\r\nto be paid, military service or service in the _gendarmerie_ will have\r\nto be rendered, and schools will have to be established for both sexes.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the future country of Albania, which--if one is rash\r\nenough to prophesy--may exist in fifty years. But there is no risk\r\nwhatever in asserting that a free, united Albania is in the immediate\r\nfuture quite impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. EUROPEAN MEASURES AGAINST THE YUGOSLAVS AND THEIR FRIENDS\r\n\r\nBerati Beg, Tirana's delegate in Paris, said in an interview with a\r\nrepresentative of the Belgrade _Pravda_, at the beginning of November\r\n1921, that he regretted that European diplomats should interfere in the\r\nSerbo-Albanian question. \"Are we not all,\" said he, \"one large Balkan\r\nfamily? And if the Powers intervene they will not act in our interests,\r\nbut in their own.\" He said that it used to be Austria which grasped at\r\nAlbania, now it was Italy. So the delegate showed that he was a\r\nclear-sighted man; he also showed that in Tirana they are not unanimous\r\nin loving the Italians. But alas! the Great Powers, urged by Italy, made\r\na most disastrous plunge; they actually, at least Great Britain, charged\r\nthe Serbs, their allies, on November 7, with being guilty of\r\noverstepping the frontier, and on November 9 informed them where this\r\nfrontier was. It is a pity that Mr. Lloyd George should have launched\r\nsuch a thunderbolt, the French Government not being consulted.[99] But\r\nthe most probable explanation of this lack of courtesy towards the\r\nSerbs, and lack of the most elementary justice, is that the Prime\r\nMinister, with his numerous preoccupations, allowed some incapable\r\nperson to act in his name.[100] The world was told, however, that Mr.\r\nLloyd George had sent a peremptory demand for the convocation of the\r\nCouncil of the League of Nations so that a sanction should be applied\r\nagainst the Yugoslavs. Mr. Lloyd George's substitute was so little\r\nversed in the business that he did not even know that the League of\r\nNations is not a gendarme to carry out the decisions of the Ambassadors'\r\nConference. He should have been aware of the fact that this was a\r\nproblem for the Allied States, to be settled by diplomatic or other\r\nmeasures, and he should also have known that the League of Nations does\r\nnot--except if invited to arbitrate--concern itself with the\r\nunliquidated problems left by the War, such as the Turkish question.\r\nPerhaps that dangerous confusion in the mind of this unknown official\r\nwould not have occurred if Albania had not been illogically admitted to\r\nthe League of Nations. But now, in November 1921, not an instant was to\r\nbe lost in settling this frontier question, which--as the _Temps_\r\npointed out--would have been settled months before if Italy had not\r\nprevented it. (She wished as a preliminary step to have certain claims\r\nof her own in regard to Albania conceded.) So the Council of the League\r\nwas to be invited to apply Article 16, which could scarcely be invoked\r\nunless Article 15, which defines a procedure of conciliation, had been\r\nfound of no avail.[101] Thus the misguided person who spoke in the name\r\nof Mr. Lloyd George was apparently too impetuous to read the texts. And\r\nthen the Serbs were told that they must withdraw practically to the\r\nfrontier which Austria, their late enemy, had laid down in 1913. Well\r\nmight Berati Beg deplore that Italy should take the place of Austria.\r\nBut such commands achieve so little. Very soon, when the troubles in\r\nAlbania continue, as they certainly will, Mr. Lloyd George will see that\r\nhe was misled.... But here it should be stated that while Italy\r\npersisted throughout in demanding the 1913 frontier (with the\r\nludicrously inconsistent proviso that she herself should have the island\r\nof Saseno, which in 1913 she had demanded for independent Albania), and\r\nFrance raised no finger against her, the actual improvements of the\r\nfrontier adopted were entirely due to Great Britain. No one is more\r\nqualified to speak on this matter than Mr. Harold Temperley of\r\nCambridge, who was one of our experts. In his illuminating little book,\r\n_The Second Year of the League_, he has pointed out that the new\r\nAlbanian frontiers are an improvement on the old--than which, indeed,\r\nthey cannot be worse--because they conform more to natural features,\r\nthey take into account an important tribal boundary (leaving the Gora\r\ntribe in Yugoslavia), and restore to both parties freedom of\r\ncommunication--the road between the Serb towns of Struga and Dibra being\r\ngiven to the Serbs, while to Albania is given the road from Elbasan to\r\nthe Serb town of Lin. The rectifications in the Kastrati and the Prizren\r\narea involve the substitution of natural boundaries for unnatural ones\r\nin order to protect the cities of Podgorica and Prizren. They confer no\r\noffensive advantage on the Serbs, nor do they enable them to menace any\r\nAlbanian city.\r\n\r\nTo any impartial observer it is quite unjust that the Yugoslavs should\r\nhave had to plead against the frontier of 1913. They have not the least\r\ndesire to plant their flag on those undelectable mountains. If the\r\nfrontier of 1913 could be held with moderate efforts against these\r\npeople they would not wish to go an inch beyond it. But those who drew\r\nthis frontier, namely the Austrians, were not much concerned as to\r\nwhether it afforded adequate protection to the Serbs; what they had in\r\nview was to keep them away from the Adriatic (for which reason an\r\narbitrary line cut through the proposed railway which was to link Pe['c]\r\nto Podgorica and the sea) and to compel the Serbs to station in those\r\ndistricts a goodly portion of their army, to which end--so that the\r\nfrontier should be weak--the towns of Djakovica and Prizren were\r\nseparated from their hinterland. The Austrian plan likewise prevented\r\nthe towns of Struga and Prizren from being joined by a road or by a\r\nrailway along the Drin; to go from one to the other it became necessary\r\nto make an enormous detour. With the rectifications to which we have\r\nreferred, the Ambassadors' Conference decided to insist on them\r\nreturning to this miserable line, instead of permitting them to take up\r\ntheir position where General Franchet d'Esperey perceived in 1918 that\r\nthey could be fairly comfortable. Monsieur Albert Mousset, the shrewd\r\nBalkan expert of the _Journal des Debats_, has remarked that on too many\r\nparts of the 1913 frontier it is as if one forced an honest man to sleep\r\nwith his door open among a horde of bandits.... The Albanian Government,\r\nadmitted to the League of Nations in December 1920, claimed that the\r\ninternational statute of 1913, creating a German prince, the Dutch\r\n_gendarmerie_ and the International Financial Commission--which happened\r\nto be inconvenient--was no longer in force; but that the international\r\ndecisions as to the frontiers of Albania--which happened to be\r\nconvenient--were still valid. However, during the War the country had\r\nbeen plunged in anarchy, and the Great Powers decided that Albania was,\r\nin Mr. Temperley's words, a _tabula rasa_, a piece of white paper on\r\nwhich they could write what they wished. In November 1921 the\r\nAmbassadors' Conference finally decided on the frontiers. The gravest\r\nviolation of the ethnic principle was in the Argyrocastro area, where\r\nmany thousands of Greeks and Grecophils were handed over to Albania; as\r\nfor the Serbs, it was only through the efforts of some British experts\r\nthat they obtained any satisfaction at all.\r\n\r\nWhy did the Ambassadors' Conference arrive at this peculiar decision?\r\nFor a long time the European Press had been publishing telegrams which\r\ntold how the Serbs were ruthlessly invading Albania. Had they advanced\r\nabout half the number of miles with which they were credited, they would\r\nhave found themselves near to the offices of those Italian Press\r\nagencies. They were held up to vituperation for their conduct towards a\r\nfeeble neighbour. The Mirditi, we were told, had to fly before them;\r\nwhereas the truth was that the friendly Mirditi were driving the troops\r\nof Tirana helter-skelter towards the Black Drin, where the Serbs--not\r\nadvancing an inch from the boundary which the Allies had for the time\r\nbeing assigned to them--received their prisoners. Again we were told\r\nthat the piratical Serbs had seized the town of Alessio. It must have\r\nannoyed the Mirditi to have this exploit of theirs ascribed to other\r\npeople. And if the newspapers contained too many telegrams of this kind\r\nthey were strangely reticent with regard to what was taking place in the\r\nshallow Albanian harbours; but the two Italian vessels which--as I\r\nmentioned in a telegram to the _Observer_--were unloading, without the\r\nleast concealment, munitions and rifles for the dear Albanians at San\r\nGiovanni di Medua in September 1920, were probably not the only ones\r\nwith such a cargo. Europe and the Ambassadors' Conference were simply\r\ntold that the truculent Serbs were destroying a poor, defenceless,\r\npastoral nation. Therefore these Serbs must be ordered back, and\r\nwhatever might be the merits of a hostile Austrian frontier as compared\r\nwith a well-informed French one, at any rate the first of these was\r\nfarther back, so let the Serbs be ordered thither.\r\n\r\nIt was noticeable that when, on November 17, the British Minister of\r\nEducation, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher (representing Mr. Lloyd George),\r\nexplained before the Council of the League of Nations why Great Britain\r\nhad thought it necessary to act in this Serbo-Albanian affair, he\r\nfounded his case not on Article 16 but on Article 12, which obliges two\r\nconflicting nations who are members of the League to have their case\r\nexamined by the League. Evidently the suggested application of Article\r\n16 was now acknowledged to have been a mistake. The blundering official\r\nin Whitehall should have seen the dignified sorrow with which Yugoslavia\r\nheard of her great Ally's unjustifiable procedure. So much faith have\r\nthe Southern Slavs always had in the Entente's sense of justice that\r\nfrom 1914 to 1918 they continued to give their all, without making any\r\nagreement or stipulation; more than once the Serbian Government had the\r\noffer of terms from the Central Powers, but on each occasion, as for\r\nexample during the dark days at Ni[vs] in 1915, they declined to betray\r\ntheir Allies.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher announced that the British Government's action was in no way\r\ncaused by feelings of hostility against the Southern Slavs. All\r\nEnglishmen, in fact, remembered the heroism and fortitude of the Serbs;\r\nthey cherished for Yugoslavia the warmest sympathy. In Mr. Fisher's own\r\ncase it might conceivably have been a little warmer--he was not ashamed\r\nto repeat the reasons which had induced Great Britain to summon the\r\nCouncil of the League. Yet he must have known the comment that he would\r\narouse among his audience when they heard him base his arguments\r\nexclusively upon reports of the Tirana Government, while those of\r\nBelgrade were ignored; and in their place the delegate thought fit to\r\nbring up various extracts which had been collected from the Belgrade\r\nPress. If every organ of this Press were filled with a permanent sense\r\nof high responsibility, and if Mr. Fisher had made inquiries as to the\r\nexistence in Belgrade of humorous and ironic writers, one is still\r\nrather at a loss to understand why these miscellaneous cuttings were\r\nplaced before the League, which could scarcely be expected to treat them\r\nas evidence. The delegate added that he did not think a single nation\r\nwas animated by unfriendly sentiments towards the Southern Slavs--so\r\nthat Italy's unflagging efforts to strengthen the Tirana Government's\r\narmy were prompted purely by the deep love which the Italians--despite\r\ntheir having been flung out of Valona--bear for the Shqyptart. Mr.\r\nFisher proceeded to say that no better proof was needed of the general\r\nfriendship for the Southern Slavs than the decision of the Ambassadors'\r\nConference which, instead of allotting to Albania the frontiers of 1913,\r\na method that would have been simpler, had resolved on several\r\nrectifications in favour of Yugoslavia, in order to prevent disturbances\r\non Albania's northern frontier. After what Mr. Fisher had already had\r\nthe heart to say we cannot really be astonished that he, or the people\r\non behalf of whom he spoke, should have thought the enemy-drawn frontier\r\nof 1913 as worthy of the slightest consideration. We are all, I think,\r\nunanimous, said Mr. Fisher in effect, we are unanimous in our esteem for\r\nthe Yugoslavs and could do nothing which that nation would find hard to\r\nbear. But after stating that some rectifications had been made in favour\r\nof Yugoslavia he should have referred to the village of Lin on Lake\r\nOchrida whose transference to the Albanians will probably give rise to a\r\ngreat deal of trouble, since it is the most important centre for the\r\nfishing industry. A few of the best Belgrade papers, careless of the\r\nmore than Governmental authority which they enjoyed in the eyes of Mr.\r\nFisher, went so far as to allege that Lin's change of sovereignty was\r\ndue to the formation on Lake Ochrida of a British fishing company.... We\r\nhave said that the frontier rectifications were inadequate; but under\r\nthe circumstances they were the best that could be obtained. They were\r\nmost bitterly contested by the Italians, who demanded, as we have said\r\nabove, that Yugoslavia should be given the 1913 frontier. France did\r\nnothing to help the Yugoslavs in this hour of need, and had it not been\r\nfor the absolutely determined support of Great Britain the pernicious\r\nfrontier of 1913 would have been adopted intact.\r\n\r\nComing to the Mirdite revolt, Mr. Fisher's description is hardly what\r\nyou would call felicitous. Mark Djoni and the other members of the\r\nMirdite Government were compelled last July to seek refuge at Prizren in\r\nYugoslavia, and since then they have conducted their affairs from that\r\nplace. These circumstances, in Mr. Fisher's opinion, go to prove the\r\nexistence of a Yugoslav plot whose aim it is to separate northern\r\nAlbania from the Tirana Government. Again Mr. Fisher points an accusing\r\nfinger at the Yugoslav officers who, in August, were helping the\r\nMirditi; but is it not more natural that these officers should give\r\ntheir services to the Christian tribes for whom, as Mr. Bo[vs]kovi['c],\r\nthe chief Yugoslav delegate, said, the Southern Slavs do not conceal\r\ntheir sympathy[102] nor the hope that they will gain the necessary\r\nautonomy--is not this more natural and more deserving of Mr. Fisher's\r\napprobation than the fact (of which he says no word) that the Moslem\r\nGovernment of Tirana has had the active assistance of Italian officers,\r\nsuch, for example, as Captain Guisardi, who, in the sector of Kljesh,\r\nhas been in command of the artillery? A further proof that the Mirdite\r\nmovement has been engineered by the Southern Slavs is, in Mr. Fisher's\r\nopinion, the damning fact that the Republic's Proclamation was composed\r\nin Yugoslavia and dated there--how brazen some people are! And the\r\nofficial Yugoslav Press Bureau has actually circulated the announcements\r\nof the Mirdite Republic. The question is whether the Yugoslav Government\r\nwas more than benevolently neutral in thus assisting their guests at a\r\ntime when these had not yet got their machinery into working order. When\r\nthe Mirdite Government had made suitable arrangements it spoke to the\r\nworld through its representatives at Geneva or through direct\r\ncommunications to the British and French Press. Surely, in considering\r\nwhether the Yugoslav Government allowed themselves to exceed the limits\r\nof neutrality, one must remember that the Mirdite authorities at Prizren\r\nwere out of all touch with their own army, which was engaged in a\r\nguerilla warfare. In conclusion, according to Mr. Fisher, the British\r\nForeign Office was persuaded that the Mirdite Republic was nothing but\r\nan instrument of the Yugoslav Government, and that desire for Albanian\r\nunity extended also to the Christians of that country. The Foreign\r\nOffice had, no doubt, been told that the Tirana Government received the\r\nsupport, at last spring's elections, of some north Albanian deputies;\r\nand possibly they gave no credence to the rumour that these gentlemen\r\nwere much indebted to Italian support. It may have been mere harmless\r\ncuriosity which kept Captain Pericone, the Italian commander, during all\r\nthat day at the Scutari polling-booths, but what is certain is that,\r\nowing to the influx of Italian money, the value of a hundred silver\r\ncrowns in the morning was 92 lire, and in the afternoon had fallen to\r\n75. It is likewise a fact that numerous Malissori, finding themselves\r\nfor the first time in possession of bundles of paper and feeling far\r\nfrom confident that this was money, hurried off to the bazaar and spent\r\nit all. Thus were the four friends of the Moslem-Italian[103] Government\r\nelected, the four deputies who were in favour of Albanian unity under\r\nthat Government; three of them are Christians (Messrs. Fichta, Andreas\r\nMiedia and Luigi Gurakuqi); one, Riza Dani, is a Moslem. How the latter\r\ntravelled to Tirana I do not know, but the three Christians found that\r\nthe population was so incensed against them that they could not go by\r\nthe direct road; they were forced to sail down the Bojana on the Italian\r\nship _Mafalda_, and then along the coast. This, I presume, will be\r\nconsidered sufficiently strong evidence that these deputies did not\r\nrepresent the people, and that their independence was not exactly of the\r\nsort ascribed to Gurakuqi by a writer in the _Times_;[104] one need not\r\nlabour the point by mentioning what happened to Father Vincent Prennushi\r\nwhose candidature was vetoed in Rome, so that he was replaced by Father\r\nFichta.\r\n\r\nThis being the state of things one can scarcely argue that the people of\r\nthe north are in favour of a united Albania, as it seemeth good to the\r\nAmbassadors' Conference, the League of Nations, etc. \"We Germans,\r\nknowing Germany and France,\" said Treitschke in 1871, \"know what is good\r\nfor the Alsatians better than these unfortunates themselves.... Against\r\ntheir will we wish to restore them to themselves.\" The north Albanian\r\ndeputies may join with those of the south and call themselves the group\r\nof \"sacred union\"; but they themselves are well aware that it is only in\r\nthe south-central districts that the Government has a majority. That is\r\none of the reasons why the seat of Government is Tirana in the central\r\npart of the country, for the Cabinet lives in apprehension of the\r\nfollowers of the late Essad Pasha, and by residing in that country they\r\nhope to be able to keep it quiet. How long will they be able to do so?\r\nHave they statesmanship enough to turn aside the animosity of their own\r\ncountrymen? Does their Premier and Foreign Minister, Mr. Pandeli\r\nEvangheli, possess intellectual resources of a higher order than those\r\nwhich one commonly associates with the ownership of a small\r\nwine-shop?--that was his occupation till he came, some two years ago,\r\nfrom Bucharest. When this gentleman had a, perhaps temporary, fall from\r\npower, the _Times_ of December 16, 1921, wrote of him that \"there is no\r\nAlbanian public man with a better record for long disinterested service\r\nin his country's cause.\" Alas, poor Albania! We may surmise that Mr.\r\nEvangheli and his companions do not rely very greatly on their Western\r\nEuropean patrons who, when it comes to the pinch, will do very little\r\nfor them. I should be surprised to hear that they have caused the\r\nprovisions of the Ambassadors' Conference to be traced in golden letters\r\non a wall of their council chamber. And I doubt whether they take very\r\ngreat stock of a resolution signed in November 1921, by some twenty\r\nMembers of Parliament and a few outside persons. These expressed their\r\napproval of Mr. Lloyd George's step in convoking the League of Nations\r\nfor the settlement of the Serbo-Albanian question. If this resolution\r\nserved no other purpose it showed, at any rate, that the signatories are\r\nsuch thoroughgoing friends of the Tirana Government that they rushed\r\nenthusiastically to their assistance, though their deep knowledge of\r\naffairs--without which, of course, they would never have signed--must\r\nhave caused them to regard the Prime Minister's impulsive action with\r\nsomething more than misgiving. It is a minor point that the signatories\r\nsought to enlist the world's sympathy on the ground that a small\r\n\"neutral State\" had been wantonly attacked by the Serbs, because if this\r\naccusation were true it would not be worth objecting that the Albanians\r\nwere scarcely a State (though some of them were trying to make one) and\r\nthat their neutrality during the War consisted in the fact that they\r\nwere to be found both in the armies of the Entente and--rather more of\r\nthem, I believe--in those of Austria. But the accusation is untrue;\r\nthere are, undoubtedly, a number of fire-eaters in Serbia, as everywhere\r\nelse, yet the Government is not so childish as to wish to squander its\r\nresources in a region where there is so little to be gained. (The Tirana\r\ncorrespondent of _The Near East_ said on November 3, 1921, that the\r\nSerbian Government was reported to be committing unwarrantable acts,\r\ngiving as an example that Commandant Martinovi['c] had had six million\r\ndinars placed at his disposal in order to recruit komitadjis and that he\r\nhad himself promised 2500 dinars to each of his men if they succeeded in\r\nentering Scutari. But this gentleman, a retired officer, lives almost\r\nexclusively at Novi Sad, where his very beautiful daughter is married to\r\nM. Dunjarski, one of the wealthiest men in Yugoslavia. Yet neither his\r\nson-in-law nor the Serbian Government has ever given General\r\nMartinovi['c] the afore-mentioned sum or any sum at all for the\r\nafore-mentioned purpose. He goes at rare intervals to his old home in\r\nMontenegro, of which country he was once Prime Minister. It is natural\r\nthat the numerous refugees from Albania should flock round him--in view\r\nof his own past prominence and of M. Dunjarski--begging for money and\r\nfood.) The protesting British Members of Parliament registered their\r\nsorrow that the Serbs should have employed on their anti-Albanian\r\nenterprise \"the strength and riches which they largely owed to the\r\nAllied and Associated Powers.\" I was under the impression that the Serbs\r\nhad expended a far greater proportion of their strength and riches than\r\nany of the Allies,[105] that the Allies had, in 1915, left them in the\r\nlurch, and that the final success on the Macedonian front was due quite\r\nconsiderably to the genius of Marshal Mi[vs]i['c] and the valour of his\r\nveterans. As for the strength and riches which the Southern Slavs\r\npossessed in 1921, it surely would not need an expert to perceive what\r\nthe Southern Slav children knew very well, namely, that they could be\r\nmore profitably employed in many other directions. May better luck\r\nattend the future labours of these Members of Parliament.... A week or\r\nso before the publication of this foolish manifesto there had been\r\nissued an equally deplorable Memorandum by the Balkan Committee (of\r\nLondon), which, I am glad to say, caused Dr. Seton-Watson to resign from\r\nthat body. This jejune and impudent Memorandum attempted to dictate the\r\nterms of the Constitution of the Triune Kingdom--an attempt very rightly\r\nreprobated by _The Near East_.[106] If the Yugoslav Government were to\r\nadopt the recommendations of the Balkan Committee they would, it seems,\r\nbe in a fair way to solve the Albanian question. Likewise that of\r\nMacedonia--when will the Committee cease to trouble Macedonia? Their\r\nobject, in the words of Mr. Noel Buxton, is to aim at allaying the\r\nunrest in the Balkans; it would--I say it in all kindliness--be a move\r\nin that direction if the other members were to follow Dr. Seton-Watson's\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. THE REGION FROM WHICH THE YUGOSLAVS HAVE RETIRED\r\n\r\nWhat of the population which inhabits the zone between the two frontier\r\nlines? We have alluded to them as a horde of bandits, we have also\r\nspoken of the six battalions which they placed at the disposal of the\r\nYugoslavs. If it is true that a poet has died in the bosom of most of\r\nus, it is equally true that in most of the Albanians a brigand survives.\r\nAnd if not a brigand, then a mediaeval person with characteristics which\r\nare more pleasant to read about than to encounter. Yet the Shqyptar, as\r\nhe calls himself (which means the eagle's son) is not without his\r\naspirations. Reference has been made to those northern tribes, such as\r\nthe Merturi and the Gashi, who benefited from the small Serbian\r\ndetachments which came in answer to their urgent wish. And on the Black\r\nDrin the six battalions have shown their fidelity. There would be no\r\nneed to guard oneself against such people. But unfortunately the\r\nAlbanian is so constituted that if, in a hamlet of ten houses, five of\r\nthem are amicably disposed towards you, there is a strong tendency among\r\nthe others to be hostile. When these torch-bearers of an ancient\r\ntradition come under the rule of an organized State, then they gradually\r\nfeel inclined to discard some of their customs which the State frowns\r\nupon. This can be seen in the changes among the people of Kossovo since\r\nit came into Serbian hands. Were the country between the two frontier\r\nlines to remain under the Serbs it would not be long before some of the\r\ntime-honoured sensitiveness of the Albanians towards each other and\r\ntowards each others' friends would vanish--though it has been found that\r\nit takes a number of years before they cease observing or from desiring\r\nto observe the very deeply-rooted custom of blood-vengeance.\r\n\r\nA good many of the border Albanians have made it clear that they wish\r\nfor some sort of association with their more cultured neighbours. But on\r\nthis point they are by no means unanimous. The unregenerate part of the\r\npeople will not be able to resist an occasional foray into Yugoslavia.\r\nAnd although the reputation which the Serbs have left behind them may\r\ninduce the tribes to be, for the most part, good neighbours, yet they\r\nhave not been long enough under the civilizing process, and the more\r\nadvanced among them would agree with the Yugoslavs that it would have\r\nbeen better for that regime to have continued over them. You may object\r\nthat the finest patriots of the Albanians would have preferred to remain\r\noutside Yugoslavia. But they know that there are many thousands of their\r\ncontented countryfolk in the neighbouring Kossovo and, what is more,\r\nthey know that the towns of Kossovo are their markets.\r\n\r\nThe Yugoslavs have bowed to the decision of their Allies. And the\r\nofficial champions of the too-ambitious League of Nations--overjoyed,\r\nafter various failures and after the Silesian award, to have really\r\naccomplished something, and something with whose merits the public was\r\nfar less familiar than with the Silesian fiasco--performed a war-dance\r\non the Yugoslavs. If that people had been as obstinate, say, as the\r\nMagyars in the case of Burgenland, no doubt it would have come to\r\nanother Conference of Venice; and Yugoslavia would, like Hungary, have\r\nreturned from there with something gained. But, of course, when it is an\r\naffair between Allies one scarcely likes to behave in that stubborn and\r\nunyielding manner which is apparently the right--at all events, the\r\nsuccessful--conduct for a whilom foe. If the Yugoslavs, in simply\r\naccepting the judgment of their Allies, acted against their own ultimate\r\nadvantage, they can, at any rate, believe that their complaisance, their\r\nextraordinary lack of chauvinism, will be recognized. It is true that\r\nwhen, on former occasions, such as during the prolonged d'Annunzio farce\r\nat Rieka, they displayed a similar and wonderful forbearance, they did\r\nnot manage to free themselves from this foolish charge. There happen to\r\nbe a good many people abroad who insist that the new States are, every\r\none of them, chauvinist; they think it is the natural thing for a young\r\ncountry to be, and especially if part of it lies in the Balkans. But if\r\nYugoslavia repeatedly acts in the most correct fashion the day may come\r\nwhen she will be able to put a lasting polish on to the reputation which\r\nher Allies have tarnished.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. THE PROSPECT\r\n\r\nWe may look forward to seeing the majority of this frontier population\r\nresolved that the links between themselves and the Yugoslavs shall not\r\nbe broken. Very little will they care for the edicts of European\r\nAmbassadors. It would not have been surprising to hear that on the\r\nwithdrawal of the Yugoslavs to the prescribed frontier their resourceful\r\nfriends beyond it had procured from Serbia a few volunteers to take the\r\nplace of the official Serbs. And failing this, that rough-and-ready\r\npeople might simply declare themselves to be in Yugoslavia. This time\r\nthey will be unable to persuade the Yugoslav Government to move its\r\nexcise posts more to the west. But if these tenacious men have made up\r\ntheir minds to join their brethren on the right bank of the Drin and\r\nenter Yugoslavia, the Ambassadors' Conference would preserve more of\r\ntheir dignity in accepting with a good grace that which they are\r\npowerless to hinder.... The minority of the border population will go\r\nraiding in Yugoslavia. If they had been consulted they would have drawn\r\nthe frontier very much as it is. With large areas lying at their mercy\r\nthey will keep the border villages in constant dread. And that is the\r\nother reason which should induce the Ambassadors' Conference to cancel\r\ntheir unwise decision.\r\n\r\nIt is better when the politicians do not come with advice to the\r\nbattlefield; and in those primitive regions, where part of the people\r\ncannot, as yet, be restrained from perpetual warfare, it would have been\r\nbetter if the politicians had done nothing but confirm the General's\r\nfrontier. Franchet d'Esperey gave it to the Serbs \"for the time being,\"\r\nand that period should last until there is no longer any military need\r\nto hold it. \"No General, however distinguished, could possibly have any\r\nauthority whatever to give to any nation the territories of another,\r\nsuch as can only be transferred and delineated by treaties and\r\ninternational recognition.\" So says Mr. H. E. Goad, or Captain Goad as\r\nhe has the right to call himself. But it is a pity that he does not\r\nappreciate the difference between that which is temporary and that which\r\nis not.\r\n\r\nItaly has been given against the Yugoslavs a purely strategic frontier,\r\nwhich places under her dominion over 500,000 unwilling Slovenes, whose\r\nculture is admittedly on a higher level than that of their Italian\r\nneighbours. And yet the Ambassadors' Conference (in which Italy plays a\r\nprominent part) has refused to give Yugoslavia a strategic frontier\r\nagainst a much more turbulent neighbour, which frontier, moreover, would\r\ninclude of alien subjects only a small fraction of the number which\r\nItaly has obtained. The Albanian frontier now imposed on Yugoslavia is\r\nvery much like that which the treaties of 1815 gave to France, when the\r\npassage (_trouee_) of Couvin, often called erroneously the trouee of the\r\nOise, at a short distance from Paris, was purposely opened. \"Formerly,\"\r\nsays Professor Jean Brunhes,[107] \"the sources of the Oise belonged to\r\nFrance, protected, far back, by the two enclaves of Philippeville and\r\nMarienbourg, both fortified by Vauban.\" And M. Gabriel Hanotaux[108]\r\nremarks that this opening of the trouee of Couvin was the reason why in\r\n1914 France lost the battle of Charleroi.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassadors' Conference has committed a grave injustice. \"Let us\r\nhope,\" says M. Justin Godart,[109] a French ex-Under Secretary of\r\nHygiene, concerning whose very misguided mission to Albania we have\r\nwritten elsewhere,[110] \"let us hope,\" says he--in my opinion one of the\r\nunjustest men towards Yugoslavia and Greece--\"let us hope that\r\nYugoslavia will understand that it is unworthy of her to contest the\r\ndecision of the Ambassadors' Conference.\" It has given to the Yugoslavs\r\na frontier that necessitates the presence of a considerable army, and\r\nthis is precisely what suits the Italians. Seeing that in Italy there\r\nare men alive who can recall their struggles against the Austrian\r\noppressor, it is sad that their own country should now be playing this\r\nvery same role. The Ambassadors appear to have taken no notice of\r\nItaly's support of the Tirana Government, but to have been very drastic\r\nwith respect to Yugoslavia's support of the Mirditi. They have punished\r\nthe Yugoslavs by binding their hands in a district part of whose\r\npopulation long for the help of those hands in gaining some\r\ntranquillity, whereas the other part consists of persons against whom\r\none must defend oneself.\r\n\r\nThe politicians have acted as if all the border folk were as peaceful as\r\nthey doubtless are themselves. In consequence, there will be panic and\r\nassassination till the politicians--unable to oppose the wishes of the\r\nmajority of those who dwell in the frontier zone--proclaim that until\r\nfurther notice General Franchet d'Esperey's wise and prudent\r\ndispositions shall be honoured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat is the only method by which an Albania can be brought slowly into\r\nexistence. At this moment the cartographers are printing the map of the\r\nAlbanians' country in accordance with the Ambassadors' decision. They\r\nmight spare themselves the trouble. The decision to recognize an\r\nAlbania was as premature a project as, in Mr. Wells' opinion, is the\r\nLeague of Nations. A free, united Albania has been recognized, and in a\r\nlittle time the Ambassadors' Conference, perceiving that such a thing\r\ndoes not exist, will be relieved to see the North and the South taking\r\nthe steps to which we have referred. It is wonderful that the\r\nAmbassadors' Conference and the League of Nations should imagine that a\r\ncountry, most of which is in the social state of the Gallic clans in the\r\ndays of Vercingetorix, can suddenly become a modern nation by the simple\r\ncontrivance of a parliament, which, as a matter of fact, has been the\r\ncaricature of one. In the words of Lord Halsbury, when reversing a\r\njudgment of the Court of Appeal, I am bewildered by the absurdity of\r\nsuch a suggestion. Albania is in need of organizers, not of orators. A\r\nvery competent French traveller,[111] one who believes that a future is\r\nreserved for this unquenchable people, warns the world against undue\r\nhaste. After describing the deplorable state or the non-existence of\r\nAlbanian schools, roads, ports, the monetary system and the organization\r\nof credit, he says that it is scarcely an exaggeration to assert that\r\nfrom the point of view of economic arrangement everything has to be\r\ncreated. This necessitates a Government which knows how to administer\r\nand which has funds at its command. But there is not the least\r\nlikelihood of regular taxes being paid to a central Government until you\r\nhave security of communication. And even then the native--except if\r\nforce is used--will not pay before he sees the benefit which taxes\r\nproduce. He who for the most part has never given obedience save to his\r\nvillage chief will require to see the local benefit. Therefore his whole\r\noutlook must be changed; slowly from being parochial it must become\r\nnational.... There can be no greater folly than at this stage to aim at\r\napplying modern usages, equality of taxation, uniformity of judicial\r\norganization, and so forth. It must be a very slow advance, says M.\r\nJaray, taking local traditions and the feudalism, both domestic and\r\ncollective, into account. Even if a central Government had all the\r\nnecessary qualifications, yet that would not cause the people to regard\r\nit with gratitude and loyalty. It is too remote. The clans have been\r\naccustomed to look no farther than their own chiefs. Only in serious\r\ncircumstances and against an invasion have they united and chosen a\r\ncommon leader. To expect the Albanians rapidly to throw aside their\r\nclannishness is to prepare for oneself a disappointment. It is in the\r\nclan that they must be made fit for something more extensive. Let the\r\ncountry be recognized not as a nation, but as a collection of clans, and\r\nlet these clans, with any outside assistance they themselves may choose,\r\ncome gradually to understand the word \"Albania.\" ... And what are the\r\nchances that this will come to pass? No country is more feudal; yet only\r\nthe most thoroughgoing peasant reforms will lay a sure foundation for\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) THE GREEK FRONTIER\r\n\r\nThe frontier with Greece has undergone no alteration as a result of the\r\nWar. It is inconvenient in certain details; it runs, for example, at\r\nsuch a very short distance to the south of the town of Ghevgeli that the\r\nprefect has little chance of frustrating those who actively object to\r\nthe payment of import duties. Rather a large number of Slavs, some say\r\n300,000, live on the Greek side of the frontier, while a far smaller\r\nnumber of Greeks live in Monastir. Both the Slavs and the Greeks have\r\nmade sundry complaints, which are more or less justified, against the\r\nalien authority which governs them. However, during 1919 and 1920, the\r\ntwo Governments resolved, in the furtherance of their good\r\nunderstanding, to raise none of these questions, neither the claims of\r\nthe derelict Slavs, who are mostly Exarchists, nor of the Monastir\r\nGreeks, who are mostly hellenized Vlachs. The two countries, while\r\nVenizelos was in power, were acting on the principles of the Serbo-Greek\r\nfriendship that used to be advocated by _L'Hellenisme_, the newspaper\r\nwhich Sir Anastasius Adossides, under Venizelos the enlightened\r\nGovernor-General of Salonica, published for several years before the\r\nfirst Balkan War in Paris. Yugoslavia was to have every facility given\r\nher in Salonica, which course would naturally be the most beneficial to\r\nthat place. And among the minor advantages of really amicable relations\r\nwould be the impossibility of such a state of things as once prevailed\r\nat Doiran, where the masters of the Greek and Bulgarian schools were\r\nneither of them in a position to chastise their peccant pupils, who\r\ncould always have the last word by threatening to transfer themselves to\r\nthe rival establishment. It was, I believe, the custom of these young\r\nscoundrels to remain at one or other of the two schools on the\r\nunderstanding that the teacher gave them a retaining fee of so many\r\nchocolates.... One rather felt, during 1919 and 1920, that the\r\nYugoslavs, in their willingness to take the hand of Greece, which had so\r\nshamefully refused to act upon its obligations in the first half of the\r\nWar, were behaving as if Venizelos would henceforward be retained in\r\npower by his countrymen. Should the Serbs find themselves hampered in\r\ntheir use of the \"Free Zone\" at Salonica, a moment might arrive when\r\nthey and the Bulgars would, to their mutual advantage, make an\r\narrangement with regard to Salonica and her hinterland.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) THE BULGARIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\nThere have been various modifications in the frontier line between\r\nSerbia and Bulgaria. The Bulgars acknowledge that in the case of the\r\nStruma salient, of the part near Vranja and of the villages on the bank\r\nof the Timok, it was clearly for the purpose of safeguarding the\r\nrailways; and few people would be found to say that Serbia has been\r\nother than modest in her demands. Compare the Italian position on the\r\nBrenner with the Yugoslav frontier against Bulgaria and in the Baranja:\r\nagainst Bulgars and Magyars the Yugoslavs only secure a sound defensive\r\nfrontier, whereas Italy obtains a capacity for the offensive against\r\nAustria.[112] It is rather different with regard to Tsaribrod, on the\r\nmain line between Ni[vs] and Sofia. So good a friend of the Yugoslavs as\r\nDr. Seton-Watson has deplored the cession of this small place, since it\r\nappears likely to imperil a future friendship between Serbia and\r\nBulgaria. As a matter of fact the Yugoslav Peace Delegates requested,\r\nfor strategic purposes, a still more southerly frontier on the Dragoman\r\nPass, which was denied to them. But Tsaribrod, which is dominated by the\r\nheights of Dragoman, is anyhow a place of minor importance. It is much\r\nto be hoped that the inhabitants will not imitate those of the Pirot\r\n_intelligentsia_ who in 1878 shook off the dust of their town when it\r\nbecame Serbian and migrated to Sofia, where they never wearied of\r\nanti-Serbian agitation. One must do one's best not to retard the arrival\r\nof that day when it will be almost a matter of indifference as to\r\nwhether a village is situated in Serbia or in Bulgaria. Mr.\r\nStanojevi['c], the deputy for Zaje[vc]a, which is not far from the\r\nfrontier, proposed in the Skup[vs]tina that Tsaribrod should be left to\r\nthe Bulgars in exchange for a sum of money. This suggestion was opposed\r\nby the Radicals, and the far-seeing Yugoslav statesmen who would gladly\r\nhave adopted it were left hoping that the Skup[vs]tina would some day\r\ndecide in its favour.... This moderation on the part of the Serbs has\r\nbeen less in evidence at Bucharest and still less at Athens. The Peace\r\nConference which felt itself unable to deprive its Ally of southern\r\nDobrudja, and unable to resist the persuasive eloquence of M. Venizelos,\r\ndoes not seem to have contributed towards a lasting Balkan peace. A\r\nreviewer in the _Observer_, while approving of Mr. Leland Buxton's hope\r\nof a Serb-Bulgar reconciliation, asks why this should be effected to the\r\nexclusion and obvious detriment of Greece. \"Why not a Balkan\r\nFederation?\" he asks. In view of the very different races which inhabit\r\nthe Balkans, he might just as well ask, \"Why not a European Federation?\"\r\nAnd the statesmen of the non-Slav Balkan countries do not seem to have\r\nmade serious efforts to prevent the coming of a purely Slav Federation.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether, when that comes to pass, the Greek and\r\nRoumanian people will have achieved such statesmanship as to make an\r\nequally small effort to keep under their control their large Slav\r\nterritories.... \"We should no longer think of Thrace,\" said M. Venizelos\r\nin the Greek Chamber in 1913, \"for it is impossible to include in the\r\nGreek State all those parts where Greeks have lived; we ought to be\r\nmodest and contented with what is most righteous and attainable; we\r\nought not to let ourselves be carried away by our imagination.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) THE ROUMANIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF THE ROUMANIANS IN EASTERN SERBIA\r\n\r\nA new frontier between Yugoslavia and Roumania has been drawn by the\r\nAllied Powers in the Banat. But before we consider its merits and\r\nabsurdities we must examine the Serbo-Roumanian question in the several\r\ndepartments of eastern Serbia. During 1919 one heard a good deal, in\r\nBucharest and in Paris, of the pitiful Roumanians whom the Serbs had\r\nalways deprived of their own national schools and churches. It was\r\nclaimed, chiefly by a certain Dr. Athanasius Popovitch, that the\r\nRoumanians in Serbia were longing for the day of their redemption. On\r\nMarch 8, 1919, two deputations of Roumanians from the Timok and from\r\nMacedonia, who had lately arrived in Paris in order to plead before the\r\nConference, presented themselves to the Roumanian colony at 114 Avenue\r\ndes Champs-Elysees. We are told that in consequence of their moving\r\nnarrative, and on account of the loud appeal made by them to all their\r\nfree brothers, the Roumanian colony founded, with great enthusiasm, a\r\nnational league for their delivery. The Vice-President of the league was\r\nannounced to be Dr. Athanasius Popovici. In a pamphlet called _Les\r\nRoumains de Serbie_ (Paris, 1919), Dr. Draghicesco, a Roumanian Senator,\r\ndenounces the Serb authorities for having obliged Dr. Athanasius, while\r\nhe was a schoolboy, to change his surname into the purely Serbian one of\r\nPopovitch. \"Not being able to endure this regime of violence,\" we are\r\ninformed, \"he expatriated himself and established himself in Roumania.\"\r\nBut if Dr. Athanasius felt so strongly with regard to his name when he\r\nwas a mere schoolboy, one is puzzled to understand why, being an adult\r\nand a pamphleteer in 1919, he should be hesitating between Popovitch,\r\nwhich is Serbian, and Popovici, which is Roumanian. The Senator does not\r\nseem to be well informed as to the early years of Dr. Athanasius, who so\r\nfar from expatriating himself as an indignant schoolboy, remained in\r\nSerbia, where he went through five classes of the gymnasium in Belgrade,\r\nafter which he studied theology in the same town, with a view to\r\nsucceeding his father, who was a priest at Du[vs]anovac in eastern\r\nSerbia. Later on Athanasius performed his military service at Zaje[vc]a,\r\nwhere he married--so one of his sisters told me--one Mileva, the\r\ndaughter of Yovan Stan[vc]evi['c], a merchant. After his marriage he\r\nwent to Jena, in order to continue his studies, and there he became a\r\nDoctor of Letters. It may be that while he was at Jena he became\r\nconscious of the regime of violence to which the Roumanians in Serbia\r\nare subjected; at any rate he decided not to return to that country,\r\nwhere his wife and three sisters are well satisfied to live. He launched\r\nhimself into a furious anti-Serbian propaganda in favour of those who,\r\nin the words of Dr. Draghicesco, are profoundly sad and full of grief at\r\nbeing neither Serbian nor Roumanian, who when they meet a Roumanian\r\nbrother listen to him with pleasure and, with their eyes full of tears,\r\nmurmur: \"How happy we should be to be with you.\" ... When I travelled\r\nthrough those parts with a view to verifying Dr. Athanasius's\r\nassertions, I was invariably told by persons of Roumanian origin that\r\nthey had no complaint whatever against the Serbs, and that the last\r\nthing they desired was to be politically united to the Roumanians of the\r\nkingdom. Dr. Athanasius might reply that his wretched compatriots were\r\nimpelled by fear to give such answers. But what do they fear?--one finds\r\nthat among these people are deputies, priests, army officers and so\r\nforth. \"To-day,\" says Dr. Athanasius, \"all the peoples who are reduced\r\nto slavery by other people secure the right to return to their\r\nfatherland.\" The Roumanians of Serbia would have to be a good deal more\r\nmiserable before wishing to have anything to do with Roumania. Milan\r\nSoldatovi['c], ex-mayor of the great mining village of Bor and himself\r\nof Roumanian origin, said that he had never heard of any one who went to\r\nwork in Roumania. No doubt the present generation of Roumanian\r\nlandowners deeply deplore the misdeeds of their ancestors, who drove the\r\nancestors of these peasants away from Roumania. \"The peasant hovels were\r\nmerely dark burrows, called _bordei_, holes dug in the ground and\r\nroofed with poles covered with earth, rising scarcely above the level of\r\nthe plain.... The interior was indescribable. Neither furniture nor\r\nutensils, with the exception of the boards which served as beds or seats\r\nand the pot for cooking the _mamaliga_\"[113]--his sole food, a paste\r\nconsisting of maize meal cooked in water. And one cannot be astonished\r\nif the Roumanians in Serbia are chary of believing that their native\r\nland has changed for the better. \"If,\" said a Roumanian peasant before\r\nan Agricultural Commission in 1848, \"if the boyar could have laid hands\r\nupon the sun, he would have seized it and sold God's light and warmth to\r\nthe peasant for money.\" Even in 1919 the peasant still had much reason\r\nto be dissatisfied, for where the owner parted with his land it was\r\nusually--no doubt as a stage in the transaction--made over to the\r\nvillage as a whole. And if the boyar no longer has the monopoly of the\r\nsale of alcohol, if he has so far improved that Vallachia is not now\r\nlosing its inhabitants as it was after the Regulations of 1831, when we\r\nread that \"in vain the rivers are assiduously watched, as if in a state\r\nof siege; the emigrants cross at the places which are clear of troops.\r\nEmigration is especially rife in winter, when the frozen Danube presents\r\nan ever-open bridge,\" yet among the Roumanians of Serbia it has been\r\nhanded down from father to son what happened in the reign of Prince\r\nMilo[vs]. To take one case out of many such that are preserved in the\r\nNational Archives at Belgrade, a dispatch was sent on February 11, 1831,\r\nby Vule Gligorievi['c], his representative in those parts, to Prince\r\nMilo[vs], who was at Kragujevac, enclosing a supplication from the\r\npriests and other inhabitants of the large Roumanian island called\r\nVeliko Ostrvo, in the middle of the Danube, praying that they might be\r\nallowed to cross to Serbia. \"We are in great misery,\" they wrote, \"and\r\nhave boyars who are very bad, and we cannot bear the misery in which we\r\nfind ourselves, and in the greatest grief we beg your Highness to let us\r\ncome to Serbia with our wives and children.\" The Prince had a special\r\nsympathy for Roumania and was therefore most reluctant to intervene in\r\nher internal affairs. He adopted a very cautious attitude in this\r\nmatter, but when Gligorievi['c] sent him petition after petition he was\r\nfinally so touched by the recital of their woes that he permitted them\r\nto cross the river; and one night, with the help of the Serbian\r\nauthorities, the whole island crossed over, to wit 57 families, with 186\r\noxen, 70 horses, 694 sheep and 87 pigs. Milo[vs] made them a free grant\r\nof land for the building of a village, together with a vast stretch of\r\nterritory for pasture and stock-raising; at his own expense he built\r\nthem a church and extended to them all the liberties and advantages\r\nenjoyed in Serbia by the Serbs themselves. As a token of their gratitude\r\nthese Roumanian emigrants called their village Mihailovac, after the\r\nname of Michael, the Prince's son. This village is the birthplace of our\r\nfriend Dr. Athanasius, whose sentiments appear to have placed him in a\r\nminority of one. When his pamphlet came into the hands of Jorge\r\nKorni['c], the mayor of Mihailovac and a Roumanian by origin, he brought\r\nit to the prefect at Negotin saying that he wished to have nothing to do\r\n\"with any devil's work.\"\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Athanasius and his chauvinist friends give a pretty lurid picture\r\nof the Roumanian villager who lives in Serbia, I visited a few places\r\nwhere the population is wholly Roumanian or Serbo-Roumanian. The 766\r\ninhabitants of Ostralje are all of Roumanian descent, the mayor being\r\none Velimir Mi[vs]kovi['c], a sergeant of reserves who has been\r\ntransferred from the army in order to carry on his municipal duties. All\r\nthe inhabitants speak Serbian and Vlach. \"We were always Serbs,\" they\r\nsaid. \"Nobody told us that we had migrated to this place.\" And amongst\r\nthose who assembled to talk with us at the schoolmaster's house there\r\nwas only one who, in the Roumanian fashion, had drawn his socks over his\r\nwhite trousers. The 2221 inhabitants of the village of Grljan are about\r\ntwo-thirds of Roumanian and one-third of Serbian origin. Formerly they\r\neach had their own part of the village, but now they are intermingled\r\nboth in the village and in the cemetery. They intermarry freely; thus\r\nJon Jonovi['c], the most notable person, who used to represent this\r\ndistrict in the Skup[vs]tina at Belgrade, has three Serbian\r\ndaughters-in-law. He was a member of the Opposition Liberal group of\r\nRibarac. \"And did you ever request that your fellow-countrymen should\r\nhave their own Roumanian schools and churches?\" we asked. This is one of\r\nthe chief demands of Dr. Athanasius. \"I was not the only Roumanian who\r\nwas a deputy,\" said the old man of the furrowed face. \"There was Novak\r\nDobromirovi['c] of Zlot; there was Jorge Stankovi['c], for instance; but\r\nwe never thought of asking for such a thing, since we had no need for\r\nit.\" The son of the wealthy Sima Yovanovi['c] at Bor observed with a\r\nsmile that the first business of Roumanian schools would have to be the\r\nteaching of Roumanian. \"My father sent me to be educated at Vienna,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and when I met some boys from Bucharest we found that our\r\nlanguage was so different that we had to talk to one another in German.\r\nAnd now when a commercial traveller comes here from Roumania I have to\r\ntalk German to him, as I would otherwise have to converse with my hands\r\nand feet.\" The French mining officials, by the way, at Bor testified\r\nthat they had never heard of any tension between men of Serbian and\r\nthose of Roumanian origin; the Roumanians, who prefer agricultural work,\r\nare more attracted to the mines in winter, when over 40 per cent. of the\r\n1500 employes are Roumanians.\r\n\r\nDr. Athanasius and his friends are agitated, as one would imagine, when\r\nthey discuss with you the numbers of their countrymen. In _Le Temps_ of\r\nApril 22, 1919, they declared that they could produce 500,000, for they\r\nrealized that their previous claim of between 250,000 and 350,000 was\r\nnot large enough to give the Roumanians in Serbia the benefit of the\r\nprinciple of nationality. But even this more modest figure will be\r\nfound, on examination, to be exaggerated. In the four north-eastern\r\ncounties of Serbia there were 159,510 Roumanians in 1895; 120,628 in\r\n1900, and in 1910 a little over 90,000. This diminution, say the\r\nchauvinists, is due to a falsifying of statistics, for those, they say,\r\nwho have attended a Serbian school are inscribed as Serbs. The truth is\r\nthat everyone is entered according to his mother-tongue. And history\r\nknows countless instances of a gradual decrease in the case of people\r\nplaced in foreign surroundings and exposed to foreign influences. Like\r\nthe Illyrians who people Dalmatia, the Thracians of ancient Dacia and\r\nthe Serbs who emigrated to Russia in the seventeenth century, the\r\nRoumanians of Serbia are undergoing this process and are inevitably\r\nbecoming Serbicized. Frequently we noticed that men possessing no\r\nSerbian blood did not care to admit their Roumanian origin, which,\r\nhowever, is no secret to their neighbours in spite of the Serbian\r\ntermination \"i['c]\" that, in the course of years, has been affixed to\r\ntheir names. An allusion to their origin is clearly regarded as lacking\r\nin delicacy. \"Well, my ancestors were Roumanian,\" is often as much as\r\nthey will admit. And when some enterprising agitators came over from\r\nRoumania to the department of Po[vz]arevac in 1919, the Roumanians of\r\nthose parts gave up to the authorities all those who did not manage to\r\nescape. For ten years Lieut.-Colonel Gjorge Markovi['c] commanded the\r\n9th Regiment, which is chiefly formed of Roumanians from that region.\r\nThey used to tell him that they wanted to have nothing to do with the\r\nRoumanian boyars. \"Here we are boyars ourselves,\" they said. All of them\r\nspeak Serbian, many of them write it; and on winter evenings they have\r\nfor years received instruction in reading, writing, arithmetic and\r\nsinging, which compares favourably with Roumania's army, in which, as I\r\nwas told at Bucharest, the plan of starting any education had to be\r\npostponed in consequence of the outbreak of the Great War. Together with\r\nthe unwillingness of these people to acknowledge their origin, one\r\nobserves a general vagueness as to the home of their forefathers.\r\nApparently these came over from southern Hungary, whence the name\r\nUngureani,[114] or from Tara Rumaneasca, _i.e._ the Roumanian land,\r\nwhence the name Tarani. Others again are descended from Roumanized Serbs\r\nwho came from Kossovo and other Serb regions of the south, lived in the\r\nBanat and Transylvania among the Roumanian villages, acquired the\r\nRoumanian language and then crossed over to Serbia. These three classes\r\nhave all come to Serbia in recent times. Any attempt on the part of Dr.\r\nAthanasius and his friends to drag in the Romans can be answered by the\r\nundoubted fact that the ancient Roman colonists had completely\r\ndisappeared from Serbia as far back as the fifteenth century, leaving no\r\ntrace at all, and there is no connection between them and the present\r\nRoumanian population of Serbia. No memories remain of the old Roman\r\ncolonists, save certain place-names which, as Professor Georgevi['c]\r\nremarks, strike one as surprising in the midst of a purely Serbian\r\npopulation. It is interesting to note that these ancient Roman\r\nplace-names are very rare in the regions inhabited to-day by men of\r\nRoumanian origin.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been worth whole devoting so much space to the\r\nactivities of Dr. Athanasius and his adherents but for the fact that\r\nEuropean public opinion, which has concerned itself extremely little\r\nwith the Roumanians of Serbia, might possibly imagine that their\r\nadvocate deserves to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE BANAT\r\n\r\nAnyone who looks at an ethnological map of the Banat will recognize how\r\ndifficult it is to partition that province among two or three claimants.\r\nNo matter by whom the map is painted, it must have the appearance of\r\nmosaic, with few solid masses of colour. This fact was quickly used by\r\nthe Roumanians, who argued that as the Banat had never been divided,\r\nneither politically nor economically, it should still remain one\r\nwhole--of course under the Roumanian flag. The Magyars haughtily pointed\r\nout that as the Banat had never been divided, but had for a thousand\r\nyears lived under the crown of St. Stephen, it should still remain one\r\nwhole--of course under the Hungarian flag. The Roumanians contended that\r\nthe indivisibility of the Banat was designed by Nature, since the\r\nmountainous eastern part could not exist if separated from the fertile\r\nwest. The Magyars asserted that it was altogether wrong to think of the\r\nradical remodelling and complete dismemberment of a territory which\r\nNature had predestined to be one. The Yugoslavs agreed with both parties\r\nthat it was not easy to draw a satisfactory frontier, but they asked\r\nthat, as far as possible, the predominantly Roumanian parts should be\r\njoined to Roumania, the Slav populations to them and the Magyars to\r\nHungary. As a matter of fact the Paris Conference did attempt to make an\r\nethnical division, between these three States, of the Banat. Roumania\r\ntried to demonstrate the impossibility of this by turning off the water\r\nin the Bega Canal when the Serbs evacuated Teme[vs]var and were taking\r\ntheir heavily-laden barges from that town. There will have to be a\r\ncentral, international organization to control the network of waterways.\r\nAs soon as the Paris Conference had decided on this division it was told\r\nby the Magyars, the Roumanians and the Yugoslavs that all the numerous\r\nGermans of the Banat wished to belong to Hungary, to Roumania and to\r\nYugoslavia. A great many of the Germans were indifferent, so long as\r\nthey could peaceably carry on their prosperous agricultural operations.\r\nNot much political solidarity is apparent among the Germans of the\r\nBanat, and seeing that both Yugoslavia and Roumania, now the principal\r\npossessors of this land, have elsewhere within their boundaries large\r\nGerman populations, their respective Banat Germans will be able to ally\r\nthemselves with these in the Parliaments of Belgrade and Bucharest. The\r\nBanat Germans who are discontented with the Paris decisions are firstly\r\nthose, among the aristocratic and commercial classes, who were\r\naccustomed to enjoy under the Magyars a favoured position, and secondly\r\nthose who, with more or less justification, say that Roumania has yet to\r\nshow that she will treat her subject minorities in a truly liberal\r\nfashion. It is for this reason that the Germans of Ver[vs]ac and Bela\r\nCrkva--in which towns they are about as numerous as the total of\r\nYugoslavs, Roumanians and Magyars--would give a majority in favour of\r\nYugoslavia if they were asked to vote as to Yugoslav or Roumanian\r\ncitizenship. _Adeverul_, which is one of the least chauvinist of\r\nBucharest newspapers, claimed for Roumania at least the railway line:\r\nTeme[vs]var, Ver[vs]ac, Bela Crkva, Bazias--an argument thought to be\r\nconclusive being that the two central towns are neither Roumanian nor\r\nSerbian but German. This railway line was, as a matter of fact, bestowed\r\nby the Peace Conference on Roumania, and it required some strenuous\r\nwork before this decision was modified. The French were suspected in\r\nYugoslavia of leaning unduly towards the Roumanians, through sympathy\r\nwith the Latin strain in their blood; yet it was the French who were for\r\ngiving to Yugoslavia not only Bazias but the villages on the Danube down\r\nto Old Moldava, seeing that in those districts the Slavs are certainly\r\nin a majority. The Roumanian case was not assisted by Professor\r\nCandrea's ethnographical map, for in the debated country around Bela\r\nCrkva that gentleman, who told me that he had omitted every place whose\r\npopulation was less than a hundred, has unfortunately forgotten to\r\ninclude Zlatica, a village of 1346 inhabitants, which was founded at the\r\ngate of a monastery six hundred and sixty years ago. The population is\r\naccording to the Hungarian census of 1910, at which time all the 1346\r\nwere Serbs, with the exception of 220 Czechs and a few gipsies.\r\nProfessor Candrea has forgotten Sokolavac, a nourishing place about two\r\nhundred and fifty years old with 1800 inhabitants and practically all of\r\nthem Serbs, as the Transylvanian Minister of Education admitted. Palanka\r\nwith 1400 inhabitants, most Serbs; Fabian with about 1000, mostly\r\nCzechs; Duplaja with 1204, all Serbs but for 10 Slovenes; Crvena Crkva\r\nwith 1108 (1048 Serbs, 34 Slovaks, 17 Germans and 9 Magyars), are every\r\none omitted. Lescovac, with 977 inhabitants, the Professor marks as\r\nRoumanian. When I was at this picturesquely situated place I was\r\nreceived in the mayor's office by half a dozen burly peasants in the\r\nSerbian national costume who asserted that, with the exception of the\r\ntailor (a Roumanian emigrant) and one or two other persons, the village\r\nwas wholly Serb. But Lescovac was then within the Serbian sphere of\r\noccupation, and possibly if I were to go there now I would be told an\r\nappropriate story by other, or the same, peasants in Roumanian attire.\r\nOne must try to find some surer indication of nationality, and Professor\r\nCandrea told me that twenty-five years ago he took down a pure Roumanian\r\ntext at that place, where the Roumanian language is the most antique in\r\nthe Banat. On the other hand, the village must have contained many\r\nSerbs, for when the late notary, a powerful Magyar with Roumanian\r\nsympathies, prevented the school being conducted, as it always had\r\nbeen, in the Serbian language, and installed a teacher--he stayed for\r\neight years--who could only speak Magyar and Roumanian, the villagers at\r\ntheir own expense procured a Serbian school-mistress. She was expelled\r\nby the notary.... This illustrates the difficulties which the Peace\r\nConference, in its desire to trace an ethnical frontier, was confronted\r\nwith. And there was no map which did not make it obvious that Serbian\r\nvillages would have to remain to the east and Roumanian villages to the\r\nwest of any possible line. They did right, I think, to revise their\r\ndecision as to the towns of Ver[vs]ac and Bela Crkva, for there the\r\nYugoslavs and their German friends have a large and unquestioned\r\npreponderance. Bazias, with about three miles of the railway, was given\r\nto Roumania so that she should have, for the exportation of her wood and\r\niron-ore, the only harbour in that region of the Danube which is capable\r\nof development. However, with no railway over Roumanian soil from Bazias\r\nto the mines, this port is perfectly useless, and it is to be hoped that\r\nRoumania will give it up, for compensation elsewhere, to the Yugoslavs.\r\nThe latter would otherwise be compelled to build three or four miles of\r\nrailway, from Bela Crkva to Palanka, which, unless a great deal of money\r\nbe spent on it, will always be one of the worst ports on the river. With\r\na little more difficulty than to Bazias the Roumanians could construct a\r\nrailway to Moldava, which also is a very good port; and in return for\r\nthis accommodation, whereby the wines of Bela Crkva could be shipped\r\nfrom Bazias, their natural port, the Yugoslavs would be ready to make\r\nover to Roumania one or two villages whose population far exceeds that\r\nof little Bazias. We may also hope that facilities will be given by the\r\ntwo Governments for the emigration of those who wish to cross the new\r\nfrontier line. Formerly the people of the Banat had no strenuous\r\nobjections to being moved, lock, stock and barrel, from one district to\r\nanother and without the inducement of coming under the rule of their own\r\nrace. Thus the village of Zsam, to the north of Ver[vs]ac, was, like\r\nmany others, very sparsely inhabited when the Turks withdrew in 1716;\r\nsome villages had only three or four occupied houses. So the Government\r\nin 1722 collected into one village the people of several others, and in\r\nthis way Zsam, which had hitherto been Slav, became Roumanian, the Serbs\r\nbeing established in the neighbouring Sredi[vs]te. In 1809 the\r\nRoumanians were transplanted from Zsam to Petrovasela, between Ver[vs]ac\r\nand Pan[vc]evo, where they entered the Pan[vc]evo Frontier Regiment;\r\ntheir place at Zsam was taken by Germans, who, being more industrious,\r\nwere preferred by the landowners.\r\n\r\nSome of the delineators of this frontier--French and British--have told\r\nme that they were guided throughout by the ethnical principle. But\r\nvarious unfortunate exceptions seem to have been made: for instance, at\r\nKo[vc]a it runs through a certain house in such a way that the lavatory\r\nalone is in Roumania; and in another village there lives a man who,\r\nsince his stables are situated in Roumania, would have had his horses\r\nrequisitioned if he had not been able to bring them into the other part\r\nof the house. Another village has its cemetery in Roumania, so that the\r\nYugoslavs carry their dead friends over during the night. Perhaps the\r\nEntente officials, perceiving that their ambitious resolution to divide\r\nthe country on ethnic principles was not feasible--there would always be\r\nalien islands to the right and to the left of any line--perhaps they in\r\ndespair drew an arbitrary line upon a map and hoped the poor inhabitants\r\nwould make the best of it. But this was rendered more difficult by the\r\nYugoslav and Roumanian authorities, for the people who desire to cross\r\nthe line are put to endless trouble. Apart from the expense, it usually\r\ninvolves a delay of three weeks before permission can be obtained, so\r\nthat the frontier is rarely traversed save by smugglers and by those\r\nwho, like the afore-mentioned man of Ko[vc]a, have been driven into\r\nchronic lawlessness.\r\n\r\nThe first line agreed upon after the War, which temporarily bestowed the\r\neastern county on Roumania, the western on Yugoslavia and the chief\r\nparts of the central (or Teme[vs]var) county also on Yugoslavia--with\r\nFrench co-operation--did not find favour in Paris; whether or not this\r\ndecision was influenced by the frequent journeys of the Queen of\r\nRoumania and her fascinating daughters to that town I do not know. At\r\nall events another boundary was made which included the large town of\r\nTeme[vs]var and all the northern part of that county in Roumania. It is\r\ntrue that there are Roumanian villages in the neighbourhood of this\r\nGerman-Magyar-Jewish town, which is by far the largest place in the\r\nBanat. And the Roumanians, who have already annexed enormous Magyar and\r\nGerman populations in Transylvania, do not boggle at another 80,000\r\nforeigners. One could, however, find very few Yugoslavs who want\r\nTeme[vs]var to be restored to them; they know that they and the\r\nRoumanians, whatever (as regards themselves) may have been the case in\r\nother days, form, each of them, only about one-thirtieth of the total\r\npopulation. But they are sorry that the Allies asked them to share in\r\noccupying the town, because the local Serbs, who are interested in\r\npolitics, were so enthusiastic, that on the arrival of the Roumanians\r\nthey were forced to leave their businesses and go to live in Yugoslavia.\r\nSince neither Serbs nor Roumanians have any ethnical claim to the town\r\none would suppose that, as the spoil had fallen to Roumania, the Entente\r\nwould have endeavoured to give the Yugoslavs some compensation: what\r\nthey did was to take away from them a good deal of that which they\r\nhad--a considerable slice of their western county--which also was\r\npresented to the Roumanians. Again, the delineators excused themselves\r\nby invoking their ethnical motives, but as a matter of fact in that part\r\nof Torontal the people are predominantly German and they should have\r\nbeen allotted to Yugoslavia, not merely because the Teme[vs]var Germans\r\nwere given to Roumania but on account of their economic existence, which\r\ncertainly in the case of the departments of Nagyszentmiklos, Perjamos\r\nand Csene (to retain the Magyar spelling) is bound up with Zsombolya,\r\ntheir market-town, and Kikinda. According to the census that was taken\r\nin 1919, the population of these three departments now allotted to\r\nRoumania consisted of 41,109 Germans, 13,638 Yugoslavs and 19,270\r\nRoumanians. Further, to the south-east of Torontal, in the departments\r\nof Pardany, Modos and Banlak, there is not so intimate a connection with\r\nthe market-town; here the population consists of 12,209 Germans, 11,102\r\nYugoslavs and 8808 Roumanians. But there seems to be little reason why\r\nthe whole of Torontal, following the wishes of the majority of its\r\ninhabitants, should not be given to Yugoslavia; and this would also\r\nreduce to a minimum the inconveniences produced by any frontier. For\r\nmany long years there has been a county frontier between Torontal and\r\nTeme[vs]var, each of which was under an official who looked direct to\r\nBuda-Pest. The adoption of this ancient county frontier as that of the\r\ntwo countries would put an end to the present absurd and unjust, not to\r\nsay dangerous, situation. It should, therefore, be brought about as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nA similar rectification is needed in the country to the north and\r\nnorth-west. The three German villages of Komlo[vs], Mariafeld and St.\r\nMiklo[vs] have their fields near Velika Kikinda, in Yugoslavia, whereas\r\nthey are themselves in Roumania. To bring home his maize from the land a\r\nfarmer was obliged to pay, at the most favourable rate, up to 200 crowns\r\na pound. Considering that this part of the country is an absolute plain\r\nwith no river flowing through it, one would suppose that a rectification\r\ncould easily be made. If these Germans had been consulted they would\r\nnaturally have opted for Yugoslavia. The Peace Conference officials\r\nmight, also have studied Velika Kikinda, a place with a very creditable\r\npast, which--as I was told by a Serb professional man of that town--will\r\nbe completely ruined if she loses the custom of these German villages\r\nand has to depend upon the Serb peasants who make one embroidered suit\r\nand one pair of sandals last them for ten years.... It will be necessary\r\nfor the Yugoslav authorities in the Banat not only to endeavour to raise\r\ntheir countrymen's standard of living but also in the southerly\r\ndistricts, where the standard is higher, to persuade them not to persist\r\nin limiting their families. The Serbs in the old kingdom have been one\r\nof the most prolific of European races--they would otherwise have been\r\nincapable of carrying on their twenty-six years of war during this last\r\ncentury--but in the south and south-east of the Banat, perhaps through\r\nmere love of comfort, perhaps through Magyar oppression, there has been\r\na marked tendency not to increase. The Magyars and Germans have had\r\nnormal families, the Roumanians have increased by assimilation (a woman\r\nmarrying into a Serbian family will often cause them all to speak her\r\neasier language). The Serbs, however, will in their part of the Banat\r\nabsorb the others if they show political understanding and a liberal\r\nspirit. \"We will give the Germans,\" said Pribi[vc]evi['c] to one of them\r\nat Ver[vs]ac--\"we will give them everything up to a university.\"\r\n\r\nThe north-west corner of the Banat, which has a considerable Magyar\r\npopulation, has been ascribed to Hungary. Opposite the apex of this\r\ntriangular tract of country lies Szeged, the second city of Hungary\r\n(118,328 inhabitants, of whom 113,380 are Magyars) and the chief centre\r\nof the grain trade of the rich southern plains. As was pointed out in\r\n_The New Europe_,[115] Szeged, which lies in flat country, would be even\r\nmore defenceless than Belgrade if the lands on the other side of the\r\nriver were under alien rule. If one draws a strategical frontier the\r\nnationality of the people is, of course, disregarded; it is, therefore,\r\nbeside the point to mention that there seem to be far more Serbs in the\r\nangle opposite Szeged than there were Magyars in the lands opposite\r\nBelgrade. The Entente has simply made up its mind to be generous to\r\nSzeged, and let us hope that we have not left this region to Hungary on\r\naccount of the activities of the extremely intelligent Baroness\r\nGerliczy--a Roumanian lady married to a Magyar--who owns a large estate\r\nthere and was much in Paris during the critical period.\r\n\r\nThe other imperfections in the Paris arrangements, whether with regard\r\nto villages or fields, are not incapable of amendment. One presumes that\r\nthe Roumanians, who have no lack of other international problems, will\r\nbe wise enough to discard certain dicta of their Liberal party and of\r\nBratiano, its self-satisfied leader, to whom all subjects seem great if\r\nthey have passed through his mind. One particular dictum which the\r\nRoumanians ought to cast aside is that which insists upon the\r\nindivisibility of the Banat. Another Roumanian statesman, Take Jonescu,\r\nwas more sagacious when he, during the War, drew up a memorandum whose\r\nobject was that Greece, Serbia, Roumania and the Czecho-Slovak\r\nGovernments should work in harmony. This idea of presenting a single\r\ndiplomatic front was to the liking of Mr. Balfour, who observed to M.\r\nJonescu that it would be better for these States and better for Europe.\r\nAs regards an understanding between Roumania and Serbia in the Banat:\r\n\"I,\" said Pa[vs]i['c]--\"I speak for Serbia. Can you speak for Roumania?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jonescu unfortunately had to shake his head.\r\n\r\nIn the fatuous policy of crying for the whole Banat--they even require\r\nthe little island in the Danube between Semlin and Belgrade--Bratiano is\r\nassisted by the aged Marghiloman, who is the chief of a branch of the\r\nConservative party. But the relations between these two do not seem\r\ndestined to be cordial, since Bratiano is married to Marghiloman's\r\ndivorced wife.\r\n\r\nMay the Roumanian people become reconciled to Yugoslavia's righteous\r\npossession of part of the Banat. It would be a pity if these two\r\nneighbours were to live together on such terms as, in the eastern county\r\nof the Banat, Caras-Severin, do the Bufani and the other Roumanians. The\r\nBufani came from Roumania some hundred and fifty or two hundred years\r\nago, on account of the taxes which they found intolerable; and they have\r\nnot been able to arrive at amicable relations with those countrymen of\r\ntheirs who are the descendants of earlier emigrants. Very seldom do the\r\nBufani and the others intermarry. These Bufani, so say the others, are\r\nlike ivy. \"They called out,\" complain the others, \"they called out:\r\n'Little brother, be good to us!' and then they strangled us.\" The\r\nBufani, who are easily recognizable by their dialect, frequent the same\r\nchurch and have one priest with the others, but they have a separate\r\ncemetery.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_e_) THE HUNGARIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\nNorth of the town of Subotica the frontier between Yugoslavia and\r\nHungary is almost a natural one, as it runs over vast hills of shifting\r\nsand which are still partly in motion. Neither on foot nor on horseback,\r\nstill less with loaded carts, is it possible to travel through these\r\nhills. But to the east and to the west of them the frontier is no better\r\nthan that which separates Yugoslavia from Roumania, and when it came to\r\nthe delimitation the Magyars thought it would be preferable if this\r\nwork were done with their assistance. Otherwise, so they urged, there\r\nwould be no check upon the wicked intolerance of their neighbours. It is\r\ntrue that they themselves had in the past been in favour of\r\ncentralization, but against this one must remember that the \"subject\r\nnationalities\" were inferior beings. The Yugoslavs, the Roumanians and\r\nthe Slovaks could not claim a glorious descent from Attila, of whom a\r\nfresco decorates the House of Parliament at Buda-Pest, and thus the\r\nMagyars had always thought it seemly that, by various devices, a limit\r\nshould be put to the number of Yugoslav, Roumanian and Slovak deputies.\r\nCount Apponyi and his colleagues told the Peace Conference very frankly\r\nat the beginning of 1920 that it really ought to take their word for it,\r\nand not persist in looking on the Yugoslavs, etc., as if they were as\r\ngood as any Magyar. Surely it was obvious that Yugoslavia, Greater\r\nRoumania and Czecho-Slovakia would be \"artificial and improvised\r\ncreations, devoid of the traditions of political solidarity and\r\nincapable of producing any.\" But if the Supreme Council was resolved to\r\nallow certain Magyar territories to join themselves, if they desired, to\r\nthese ephemeral States it would be necessary to ascertain by means of a\r\nplebiscite what were the real wishes of the people in these territories;\r\nand Count Apponyi was kind enough to tell the Council very definitely\r\nhow this plebiscite should be conducted. The principal Allies were to\r\narrange, in accordance with the Magyar Government, as to the districts\r\nin which a plebiscite was to be held, and the secret voting was to be\r\ncontrolled by neutral commissions and delegates of the interested\r\nGovernments. This may sound rather rash on the part of the Magyars,\r\nsince a plebiscite, no matter how it was arranged and controlled, would\r\npresumably detach a good many jewels from the crown of St. Stephen, and\r\nit was not astonishing that Count Apponyi and his friends proposed that\r\nthe Magyars should be safeguarded by further Commissions which, if\r\nrequisite, would override the results of the voting. These results would\r\nindeed, as between the Magyars and the Yugoslavs, have given our Allies\r\na larger dominion than they have actually obtained. The triangle south\r\nof Szeged, to which we have alluded, would certainly, if there had been\r\na plebiscite, have gone to Yugoslavia. In Baranja the Yugoslavs have\r\nclaimed that the census of 1910, which indicated 36,000 Serbo-Croats,\r\nshould have given them 70,000; but this does not take account of the\r\nlarge number of [vS]okci--Slavs whose ancestors were forcibly converted\r\nto Catholicism and who came to consider themselves as one with the\r\nCatholic Magyars. This widespread phenomenon of race being superseded by\r\nreligion may be noticed, for example, at Janjevo in the district of Old\r\nSerbia; it is inhabited by the descendants of Dubrovnik colonists who,\r\nbeing Catholic, have come to look upon themselves as Albanians. In\r\nHungary the dominant Magyar minority was wont to clasp the subject races\r\nto its bosom, not with bonds of love but of religion. Thus in 1914 at\r\nMarmoros-Sziget they charged 100 persons with high treason, because it\r\nwas their wish to leave the Uniate Church, in communion with Rome, and\r\nreturn to the Orthodox faith. The same charge would have been preferred\r\nagainst certain Ruthenians who were just as unwilling to be members of\r\nthe Uniate Church; but in the case of these humble, backward people the\r\nconversion had been effected by their priests, who would thereby procure\r\nfor themselves a better situation, and the Ruthenians, who had not been\r\ntold of this occurrence, were under the impression that they were still\r\nOrthodox. Professor Cviji['c] believes that, with the help of the\r\nCatholic religion, no less than 113,000 Serbo-Croats have in Baranja\r\nbeen lost by their Yugoslav brethren.... When the Yugoslavs were asked\r\nby the Supreme Council to evacuate most of Baranja they did so. A\r\nrepublic, under the presidency of one Dobrovi['c], a well-known cubist\r\npainter, a native of those parts, was formed by Yugoslavs and the\r\nMagyars whose freedom had been safeguarded under their rule. But as this\r\nrepublic was not assisted by the Yugoslav Government it only lasted for\r\na week.\r\n\r\nFarther to the west is the Prekomurdje, that interesting Slovene\r\ndistrict which extends for about 25 miles along the Mur. The rich plain\r\nthat adjoins the river is mostly in the possession of large landowners,\r\nwhile the hilly country to the north sustains a scattered and poor\r\npopulation of Calvinists. There are in the whole Prekomurdje some\r\n120,000 Yugoslavs, who are descendants of the old Pannonian Slovenes.\r\nThis healthy, honest people has indeed eighteen Catholic and eight\r\nProtestant priests, but is otherwise almost destitute of an\r\n_intelligentsia_. They speak nothing but Slovene, and yet the Magyars\r\nhad for ten years previous to the War been so imperialist that only\r\nMagyar schools were tolerated. Thus it happened that the children, like\r\nso many others in the Magyar schools, were at a loss to understand what\r\nthey were writing, and if their teacher chanced to learn the Slovene\r\nlanguage he was there and then transferred to Transylvania or the Slovak\r\ncountry or some other province where he had to teach his pupils in the\r\nMagyar which they did not know. He was supposed to make the children\r\nfeel the vast superiority of all things Magyar, so that they should be\r\nashamed to walk with their own fathers in the streets and speak another\r\ntongue. We are told occasionally in the _Morning Post_ that\r\nconsideration should be shown to the Magyars since they are a proud\r\npeople, but would they not merit more consideration if they were a\r\ngrateful people, grateful that the rest of Europe, overlooking their\r\nMongolian origin, has accepted them as equals? The Magyars were so\r\nthoroughly persuaded of their own pre-eminence that when the devotees of\r\nHaydn founded in his honour a society at Eisenstadt, where he had\r\nworked, it was allowed on the condition that the statutes and the name\r\nof the society and so forth should be in the Magyar language, although\r\nHaydn was a German. Evidently the poor Slovenes of the Prekomurdje would\r\nbe swamped unless they showed exceptional vigour. And when they managed\r\nto survive until after the War the Americans in Paris were for handing\r\nthem to Hungary on the ground that the frontier would, if it included\r\nthem in Yugoslavia, be an awkward one. Such is also the opinion of Mr.\r\nA. H. E. Taylor in his _The Future of the Southern Slavs_; this author\r\nadvocates that Yugoslavia should be bounded by the Mur, albeit in\r\nanother part of the same book he says that \"a small river is not usually\r\na good frontier, except on the map\"; and the Mur is so narrow that when\r\nDr. Gaston Reverdy, of the French army, and I arrived at Ljutomir we\r\nfound that a crowd of these men and boys had waded across the stream in\r\norder to lay their cause before the doctor, who represented the Entente\r\nin that region. The Bol[vs]evik Magyars were just then threatening to\r\nset all Prekomurdje on fire, and the pleasant-looking, rather shy men\r\nwho stood in rows before us begged the doctor to procure them\r\nweapons--they would be able to defend themselves. It is satisfactory to\r\nknow that most of this portion of the Yugoslav lands has, after all, not\r\nbeen lost to the mother country.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_f_) THE AUSTRIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the frontier between Yugoslavia and Austria has\r\nbeen determined by a plebiscite which was held, under French, British\r\nand Italian control, in the autumn of 1920. The Slovenes during the\r\nprevious year had pointed out that while they could no longer claim so\r\nwide a territory now that Austria had been drawn towards the Adriatic,\r\nyet the rural population of Carinthia had remained Slovene, thanks to\r\nthe notable qualities of that people. The German-Austrians, on the other\r\nhand, maintained that country districts are the appanages of a town, so\r\nthat the wishes of a rural population are of secondary importance. While\r\nthese questions were being debated in 1919 by the two interested\r\nparties--and debated, very often, by their rifles--the Italians\r\nintervened. Sonnino's paper, the _Epoca_, made a great outcry over\r\nKlagenfurt (Celovec) which, if given to the Yugoslavs, would be an\r\ninsurmountable barrier, it said, to the trade between Triest and Vienna,\r\nalthough it was clear that the railway connection through Tarvis\r\nremained in the hands of the Italians. (There is not a single Italian\r\ncivilian in Tarvis--but no matter.) Meanwhile the French Press noted\r\nthat the Italians--presumably not as traders but as benefactors--were\r\nseeing to it that the Austrians did not run short of arms and munitions.\r\nFor many months a large area was in a condition of uncertainty and\r\nturmoil, till at last the Peace Conference ordered a plebiscite.\r\n\r\nTwo zones in Carinthia--\"A\" to the south-east, with its centre at\r\nVelikovec (Voelkermarkt), and \"B\" to the north-west, with its centre at\r\nKlagenfurt (Celovec)--were mapped out, and it was agreed that if the\r\nvoting in \"A,\" the larger zone, were favourable to Austria, then the\r\nother zone would automatically fall to that country. For several months\r\nbefore the voting day this area--a region of beautiful and prosperous\r\nvalleys watered by the broad Drave and surrounded by magnificent\r\nmountain ranges--for several months this area was the scene of great\r\nactivity. German-Austrians and Yugoslavs no longer, as in 1919, attacked\r\neach other with the implements of war, but with pamphlet, broadsheet,\r\nwith eloquence and bribery. Austrian and Yugoslav officials took up\r\ntheir headquarters at various places and saw to it that every voter\r\nshould be posted as to the moral and material advantage he would reap by\r\nhelping to make the land Austrian or Yugoslav, as the case might be. All\r\nthose were entitled to vote who, being twenty years of age in January\r\n1919, had their habitual residence in this area; or, if not born in the\r\ndistrict, had belonged to it or had their habitual residence there from,\r\nat least, January 1, 1912. The larger zone \"A\" was left under Yugoslav\r\nadministration, while zone \"B\" was under the Austrian authorities; and\r\nthe Inter-Allied officials exercised a very close supervision in order,\r\nfor example, to protect the partisans of either side from undue\r\nrepression at the hands of their opponents. Neither the Austrians nor\r\nthe Yugoslavs lost any opportunities for saying in public that the\r\nInter-Allied Commissions were honestly making every effort to be\r\nimpartial. It was, however, unfortunate that Italy should have sent as\r\nher chief representative Prince Livio Borghese, who may have been as\r\nimpartial as his colleagues, but whose reputation, whether merited or\r\notherwise, could scarcely commend itself to the Yugoslavs. They believed\r\nthat his activities in Buda-Pest, under the Bol[vs]evik regime, and\r\nafterwards in Vienna, had been very hostile to themselves. Each of the\r\nthree allied commissioners had a staff of some fifty or sixty officials,\r\nwhose upkeep and expenses were paid by the two interested countries.\r\n\r\nIf an average person had been asked to foretell the result of the\r\nplebiscite I suppose he would have said that in zone \"A\" the Yugoslavs\r\nand in zone \"B\" the Austrians would be successful. We have seen how the\r\nSlovene renaissance of the nineteenth century was met by the central\r\nauthorities in Vienna (particularly after the German victory of 1871),\r\nand how the local functionaries assisted them. They argued that Austria\r\nwith her miscellaneous races could only survive if one of them was\r\nsupreme. Therefore they looked askance on every one who regarded himself\r\nas a Slovene; if he rose to be an official it had to be in another part\r\nof the Monarchy, while for the maintenance of Austria (oblivious to the\r\nargument that Austria was a perfectly unnatural affair) they favoured\r\nall those who announced themselves to be on the side of the predominant\r\nrace. From 1903 onwards the Slovene language was barred from the courts\r\nof Carinthia, and if a person did not understand the language of the\r\nGerman magistrates he had to use an interpreter. The land was invaded by\r\nthe German _intelligentsia_: professors, masters in primary and\r\nsecondary schools, doctors, lawyers and so forth, excise officials and\r\nrailway officials--in 1912 Carinthia possessed about 5000 of these and\r\nonly 11/2 per cent. were Slovenes. Those among the Slovenes who were\r\ncapable of serving in such positions were dispatched to Carniola,\r\nDalmatia or preferably to the German-speaking lands of the Empire. A\r\nprovincial agricultural authority was set up in 1910 which was\r\nrecognized by the State and which enjoyed a monopoly. Its object was to\r\naid the progress of agriculture by establishing and supporting\r\nagricultural schools, sending experts to the farmer, distributing\r\nsubsidies for the purchase of machinery, artificial manure and so on.\r\nThe council consisted of twenty-one members, of whom only one was a\r\nSlovene; the subsidies were given to those who were recognized as\r\nGermanophils, while requests were not permitted in the Slovene tongue.\r\nAs for the electoral districts, they were so manipulated that one deputy\r\nrepresented 120,000 Slovenes and another represented 27,000 Germans.\r\nConstituencies in which there was a German majority were allowed to send\r\ntwo members, while the others only sent one. The German railway\r\nemployees worked so thoroughly for pan-Germanism that various Slovenes\r\nwere arrested--among them the mayor of a large village who wanted to\r\ntravel from Celovec--for asking in the Slovene language for a ticket.\r\nWith regard to schools, there were throughout Carinthia in 1860 some 28\r\nSlovene and 56 Slovene-German foundations, whereas in 1914 there were 2\r\nSlovene, 30 German and 84 mixed schools, where the two languages were\r\nsupposed to co-exist; they were indeed the home of two languages, for\r\nthe children were nearly all Slovene, whereas the teacher and the\r\nlanguage he used were German. Among 230 masters only 20 could read and\r\nwrite Slovene. Qualified teachers who could satisfy this test were, as\r\nwe have mentioned, sent to other parts of the Empire. So far did the\r\nsystem go that Slovene peasants upon whom the Government had forced a\r\nGerman education speedily forgot the two hundred words which they had\r\nlearned, but as they had been taught no other script than the German\r\nthey were accustomed to write the Slovene language with German Gothic\r\ncharacters. These peasants were fairly impervious to Germanization;\r\ntheir strong sense of national consciousness was supported by the books,\r\nreligious and otherwise, which they received every year from some such\r\nsociety as that of St. Hermagoras at Celovec, which distributed half a\r\nmillion books a year among its 90,000 members.\r\n\r\nBut that which principally guided the peasant was the voice of his\r\npriest, and the vast majority of priests in zone \"A\" were Slovenes. This\r\nagricultural zone possesses no more than one or two small towns, where\r\nthe priest is less regarded. The traders and artisans frequently look\r\nupon themselves as too highly cultured for the Church; they affect the\r\n\"Los von Rom\" and the Socialist movements. By holding these menaces over\r\nthe Bishop's head a good deal of pressure could be brought to bear, and\r\nthis was done by the Germans, who were of opinion that the Church\r\nunfairly encouraged the Slovenes. The Bishop of Celovec had both the\r\nzones in his diocese until some months before the plebiscite, when a\r\ntemporary arrangement was made under which zone \"A\" was administered by\r\na vicar. But in bygone years the Bishop, with these threats hanging over\r\nhim, was wont to counsel prudence and to ask his clergy not to agitate\r\ntheir flock, whom they were merely telling of their rights. In zone\r\n\"B,\" which mostly consists of the town of Celovec, the Church would\r\nnaturally be more susceptible to German influence, apart from the fact\r\nthat the Bishop himself is a Bavarian. For personal reasons--he is very\r\nimperfectly acquainted with the Slovene language--he wished even the\r\nclergy of zone \"A\" to correspond with him in German; but the priests\r\npointed out that their faithful parishioners wanted to follow this\r\ncorrespondence and by far the greater number of them have no German....\r\nIn fact the Church has in each zone brought its help to the more\r\npowerful party--the Slovene peasants in zone \"A\" and the German or\r\nGermanophil townsfolk in zone \"B\"; and it appeared probable before the\r\nplebiscite that in both cases she would be on the victorious side.\r\n\r\nIn foretelling the result of the plebiscite one would not pay much\r\nattention to the census which the German-Austrian officials used to\r\ntake. A person was inscribed according to the language he ordinarily\r\nemployed, and this was, more often than not, considered to be German if\r\nhis superior was a German. Before the census of 1910 the _Grazer\r\nTagblatt_, which is the Germans' chief organ in those parts, proclaimed\r\nthat the official census was a portion of the national propaganda. All\r\nthe propagandist societies were entreated to do their utmost to induce\r\nthe people to declare German as their usual language. Very humorous\r\nresults were obtained. On December 18, 1910, the provincial council of\r\npublic instruction gave out the number of German and Slovene children\r\nrespectively in thirty Slovene parishes. Amongst them were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n                                German Children.       Slovene Children.\r\nBorovlje (Ferlach)                31 per cent.            69 per cent.\r\nGrab[vs]tajn (Grafenstein)        10.6    \"               89.4    \"\r\n[vZ]relc (Ebenthal)               24.4    \"               75.6    \"\r\nPokr[vc]e (Poggersdorf)            1.3    \"               98.7    \"\r\nBistrica (Feistritz)              16.2    \"               82.8    \"\r\n\r\nAnd twelve days later the official census gave these results:\r\n\r\n                                      Germans.            Slovenes.\r\nBorovlje                            90 per cent.        10 per cent.\r\nGrab[vs]tajn                        50.1    \"           49.9    \"\r\n[vZ]relc                            49.2    \"           50.8    \"\r\nPokr[vc]e                           41.1    \"           58.9    \"\r\nBistrica                            44.4    \"           55.6    \"\r\n\r\nFar more trustworthy is the almanac issued every year by the Church,\r\nwherein a person's \"usual language\" is taken to be that in which he\r\nlistens to the word of God. These ecclesiastical lists were published by\r\nGerman bishops, and according to them we find that the region we are\r\nconsidering held in 1910 some 40,000 Germans and 123,000 Slovenes.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Celovec, like the smaller towns in this area, leans\r\nmore to the Austrians than to the Yugoslavs. This is partly the effect\r\nof the Austrian Government's policy and partly of the various pan-German\r\nsocieties (_e.g._ the \"Kaerntner Bauernbund,\" the \"Verein der\r\nAlldeutschen,\" the \"Deutscher Volksverein,\" etc. etc.), which, as was\r\nadmitted, drew their funds to a considerable extent from Germany\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe German Republic was very lavish in assisting her smaller Austrian\r\nsister during the period before the plebiscite, pouring both goods and\r\ncash into the district; and after the opening of the demarcation line\r\nbetween the two zones at the beginning of August they were able to\r\nintroduce their supplies quite openly into zone \"A.\" Very few Germans of\r\nthe north believe that the German-Austrian Republic will permanently\r\nremain separated from themselves.... Both Yugoslavs and Austrians\r\ncirculated vast quantities of printed matter; for the Yugoslavs the most\r\nconvincing argument lay in Austria's apparently hopeless economic\r\nposition and the undesirability of belonging to a State which had to pay\r\nso huge a debt; the Austrian pamphlets denounced the Serbs as a military\r\nrace, though even such a dealer in false evidence as the eminent\r\nAustrian historian, Dr. Friedjung, would find it difficult to sustain\r\nthe thesis that the wars engaged in by the Serbs during the last hundred\r\nyears were more of an offensive than of a defensive character. In\r\nseveral prettily prepared handbooks the voters were implored by the\r\nAustrians not to be so old-fashioned as to plump for a monarchy when\r\nthey had such a chance of becoming republicans; one could almost see the\r\nwriter of these scornful phrases stop to wipe his over-heated brow after\r\nhaving pushed back his old Imperial and Royal headgear. You might\r\nimagine that the Austrians in their deplorable economic condition would\r\nhave avoided this topic; on the contrary, they proclaimed that several\r\ncommodities which were lacking in Yugoslavia could be furnished by them\r\nin abundance. One of these, they said, was salt; and certainly the\r\nYugoslavs purchased a good deal of it, but that was only when they did\r\nnot know that it was German salt, which the Austrians bought in that\r\ncountry and on which they made an adequate profit. When the Yugoslavs\r\nwanted to get their supplies direct from Germany the Austrians\r\nintroduced a transit tax of 1000 crowns--not the nearly worthless\r\nAustrian but Yugoslav crowns--per waggon. Later on when the Danube was\r\nthrown open and this tax could not be levied, salt was considerably\r\ncheaper in Yugoslavia than in Austria. So with plums--in 1919 Austria\r\nbought nearly the whole of the exports from Yugoslavia at six crowns per\r\nkilo and sold them to Germany at eleven to twelve crowns, the profit\r\ngoing, so the authorities said, to the poor.\r\n\r\nAs the day of the plebiscite approached, the Yugoslavs seemed to be more\r\nconfident than the Austrians. The staunch peasants of zone \"A\" were not\r\ngreatly impressed by the numerous appeals to their heart and brain which\r\nwere handed to them by the Austrians in the Slovene language. And they\r\nwere not much alarmed at the idea of being joined to their countrymen of\r\nthe south, those unmitigated Serbs who thrived, if one was to believe\r\nthe Austrian propaganda, on atrocities. But this warning was ridiculed\r\nby the Austrians themselves--on a market day at Velikovec you could see\r\nthe Austrophils wearing their colours, which they would scarcely have\r\ndone if they had been afraid of possible reprisals--and zone \"A\" was\r\ngenerally presumed to have a Yugoslav majority. On such a market day one\r\nsaw very few Yugoslav colours in the farmers' button-holes, for it was\r\nthe wish of their leaders to avoid anything which might give rise to\r\nunnecessary conflict. The day drew near and the Austrians thought that\r\nthey were making insufficient progress; for one thing, they were at a\r\ndisadvantage owing to the very low value of their money. They hoped that\r\nGermany would come with more zeal than ever to the rescue, and they\r\nhoped that something fatal would occur to Yugoslavia. So they asked the\r\nInter-Allied Commissions to put it to their Governments that it would\r\nbe advisable if the plebiscite were to be postponed for several months,\r\nsay until May 1921. But it was reported that the French and British\r\nrepresentatives declined to countenance the scheme. They may also have\r\nfeared that if the period of canvassing were to be so long drawn out,\r\nthe same passions would come to the surface as in the plebiscite in east\r\nand west Prussia, where in many places the Poles could not display their\r\nsympathies except at great personal risk. But in that particular\r\nplebiscite it must be noted that the Allies were very imprudent in\r\nconfiding the maintenance of order to the rebaptized German Security\r\nPolice, a body which was entirely in the hands of the reactionary\r\nclique. Yet the military precautions of zone \"A\" in Carinthia were not\r\nwhat they should have been, for when the Yugoslavs had lost the\r\nplebiscite an unrestrained horde of Austrian sympathizers, some of them\r\nfrom that zone and some from outside it, some of them civilians and some\r\nof them soldiers in mufti who made for certain places where supplies of\r\nweapons had been hidden, swarmed across the land and terrorized the\r\nYugoslavs in such a fashion that a Yugoslav military force had to come\r\nin to protect them. \"But how barbaric are these Yugoslavs,\" sneered\r\ntheir enemies, \"for they refuse to recognize the result of the\r\nplebiscite.\" More than one diplomat in Belgrade was ordered to present\r\nhimself at the Foreign Office and demand an answer why, etc. But the\r\nYugoslavs had no intention of imitating d'Annunzio.\r\n\r\nThose who were not in the zone at the time of the voting might well be\r\nastounded at the result, which was an Austrian victory by 22,025 votes\r\nagainst 15,278 for Yugoslavia. In view of the undoubted Yugoslav\r\nmajority, it was felt that something more than active propaganda, before\r\nand during the election, had been brought to bear. For example, in the\r\ncommune of Grab[vs]tajn (Grafenstein) the Germans are said to have\r\ninscribed on the electoral list 180 persons from Celovec and Styria who\r\nhad no right to vote; they also asked that seventy strangers should be\r\ninscribed. On submitting these claims to the judgment of the district\r\ncouncil the German leaders, even as the Yugoslavs, were required to\r\ninitial each request; it is alleged that these initialled papers, which\r\nwere attached to the claims, were left overnight in a room the key of\r\nwhich was in the keeping of the German secretary, Schwarz. He is charged\r\nwith having removed the initialled papers from the Slovene claims and\r\naffixed them to the German claims. There was a large amount of more\r\nusual corruption. Thus it is known that twenty-eight Slovene servants at\r\nan important landowner's were unable to resist the material arguments\r\nand voted for the Germans. And if it is true that a number of people\r\nvoted twice and even three times the Inter-Allied Commission fell short\r\nof its duties. It is said that the voting was so lax that if a stranger\r\nhad been inscribed and did not turn up to vote, his legitimation was\r\nused by a native. Thus we are told of one Helena Rozenzoph, aged\r\nseventy-five, who was inscribed at Grab[vs]tajn. This woman had never\r\nexisted; there had been a certain Barbara Rozenzoph who died in 1919,\r\nand her vote was used by Marjeta Hanzio, aged twenty-two years. The case\r\nwas so flagrant that the Commission discovered it and the woman\r\nconfessed to having acted on a note which she had received from the\r\nspecial Austrian _gendarmerie_ force, the Heimatsdienst. The Commission\r\nseems to have been reluctant to take any steps against these frauds and\r\nit is not astonishing that the commune of Grab[vs]tajn registered 1290\r\nvotes for the Austrian Republic and only 380 for Yugoslavia, although in\r\nthis commune of 3440 inhabitants there are no more than sixteen German\r\nfamilies. A German majority was thus obtained in a province which Dr.\r\nRenner, the Austrian Chancellor, had acknowledged to be Slovene. It\r\nseems incredible that the Commission should have so completely broken\r\ndown and the mystery may yet be cleared up, if as the Yugoslavia\r\ndelegate requested, all the voting papers have been preserved.... But\r\nthe _Hrvat_, the organ of the Narodny Club in Croatia (the\r\ndecentralizing but strongly national party) blames Monsignor Koro[vs]ec,\r\nthe leader of the Slovene clericals, for the disastrous plebiscite\r\nresult. He would have been better employed, it says, in organizing his\r\npeople than in gadding about Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Dalmatia\r\nfor the purpose of extending his party. He had boasted that the Slovenes\r\nwere so well organized that they were perfectly confident as to the\r\nissue. It would seem, however, says the _Hrvat_, that an unexpectedly\r\nlarge proportion of them are partly or entirely Germanized. And this,\r\nmore than the above-mentioned irregularities, may be chiefly responsible\r\nfor Yugoslavia's loss. One must also remember that many a Slovene would\r\nshrink from garrison duty in Macedonia, while it would be very natural\r\nfor the Carinthian farmer to look up at the mountains that separated him\r\nfrom Carniola and then to recollect that Celovec (Klagenfurt), the\r\neconomic centre of the whole area, would be Austrian. Nevertheless if\r\nzone \"A\" had been smaller--and more completely Slav--it is probable that\r\nthe population would have risen superior to the various doubts which\r\nassailed them. What we have said about the Slovenes who have become\r\nGermanized is borne out by the _Koroski Slovenec_, a newspaper which\r\nappears in Vienna and which, though since its formation has been\r\nessentially hostile to the Austrians, tells us that after the plebiscite\r\nthe Slovenes have only suffered real oppression from their\r\ndenationalized compatriots. Difficulties arose with regard to the\r\nclosing of Slovene schools, but this was largely due to the fact that\r\nmany of the Slovene schoolmasters fled to Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_g_) THE ITALIAN FRONTIER\r\n\r\nA Yugoslav barrister from Pola had gone to a neighbouring village--this\r\nwas in 1920--for the purpose of encouraging the natives, who were all\r\nSouthern Slavs. He asked them, in the event of their part of Istria\r\nbeing allotted to the Italians, not to lose heart but to wait for the\r\nday when justice would come by her own. In the middle of his\r\nexhortations a jovial old farmer approached him and slapped him on the\r\nback. \"Cheer up, young man!\" he exclaimed. \"What is it that you are\r\nafraid of?\" ... The Slav population of Istria and Gorica-Gradi[vs]ca,\r\neven as that of Dalmatia, has endured a great many things and is\r\nprepared to endure a great many more. Kindness would have gone a long\r\nway towards disarming them. If the Italians on the eastern Adriatic had\r\nbeen exponents of the Mazzini spirit rather than--which too often has\r\nbeen the case--of the direst Nationalist, then the Yugoslavs would have\r\naccepted--mournfully, no doubt, but _faute de mieux_--the frontier from\r\nthe river Ar[vs]a in Istria which President Wilson suggested. This would\r\nhave been a compromise frontier, by which 400,000 Slovenes and Croats\r\nwould fall to Italy and a very much smaller number of Italians would\r\nfall to Yugoslavia. It would have satisfied the great sensible mass of\r\nthe Italian people, but unfortunately was rejected by Baron Sonnino and\r\nhis myrmidons. Far more was claimed by him, and the succeeding Italian\r\nGovernments have had to struggle with the passions he so recklessly\r\naroused. They have been unable to persuade the country that with the\r\nAr[vs]a frontier they would be getting by no means a bad bargain. By the\r\nTreaty of Rapallo the Italians have obtained much more: the whole of\r\nGorica-Gradi[vs]ca, portions of Carniola, the whole of Istria and\r\ncontiguity with Rieka (which is made a free town), the islands of\r\nLussin, Cres and Unie, sovereignty over a strip of five miles which\r\nincludes Zadar (and a few adjacent islands), finally the southern island\r\nof Lastovo and Pelagosa which lies in the middle of the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nIn November 1920 all the outside world was congratulating the Italians\r\nand the Yugoslavs on having, after many fruitless efforts of their\r\nstatesmen, come to this agreement. The opinion was expressed that both\r\nof the contracting parties would henceforth be satisfied, since each of\r\nthem was conscious that the other had accepted something less than his\r\ndesires. It was noted that the Yugoslavs exhibited more generosity, as\r\nthey gave up some half a million of their countrymen, while the Italians\r\nyielded in Dalmatia that to which they had no right. The Yugoslavs had,\r\nin the past two years, shown so much more forbearance than was usually\r\nexpected of a vigorous young nation that the commentators for the most\r\npart fancied they would not waste any time in grieving over these\r\ninevitable sacrifices. It is freely said that if a liberal spirit is\r\ndisplayed by the Italians at the various points where they and\r\nYugoslavia are in contact, both people will settle down, with no\r\nafterthoughts, to friendly and neighbourly relations. But it would be\r\nfoolish to close our eyes to the fact that the position at Rieka and\r\nZadar, not to speak of any other places, bristles with difficulties. At\r\nRieka one hopes that the largest and wisest party, the Autonomists, will\r\nnow come into their rights; no doubt a good many of those opportunist\r\ncitizens who, at the time of the Italian occupation, developed into\r\nItalianissimi, after having previously been known as more or less\r\nplatonic lovers of Italy, Hungary, or Croatia with ambitions chiefly\r\ncentred on their native town, will presently assure you that in the Free\r\nState they are convinced Free Staters; but the local politicians have\r\nbeen living for so long in such a thoroughly oppressive atmosphere that\r\nmost of those who have been prominent should for a season now retire. It\r\nwill be difficult enough for this harassed port to settle down to\r\nbusiness. As for the Zadar enclave, it is not easy to understand why an\r\nItalian majority in this little town should bring it under the Italian\r\nflag while the overwhelming Slav majorities of central and eastern\r\nIstria have been ignored. And with all the goodwill in the world the\r\nexistence of this minute colony encircled by Yugoslav lands will\r\nscarcely make more easy the conduct of relations between Yugoslavia and\r\nItaly. It is naturally to the interest of both countries that\r\nmisunderstandings and suspicions should be swept away. And from this\r\npoint of view it is very doubtful whether the Italians were well advised\r\nin taking Zadar into their possession. Presumably the Government was\r\nforced to do so by the state of public feeling. They withstood this\r\nfeeling with regard to the magnificent harbour of Vis, which even\r\nPresident Wilson suggested they should have, and contented themselves\r\nwith the smaller Yugoslav island of Lastovo (Lagosta). The pity is that\r\nthe Nationalists should have forced into their hands anything which may\r\nturn and sting them.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that we are excessively pessimistic in pointing rather\r\nto the dangers which the Treaty places on the tapis than to the good\r\nsense of those who will deal with them. We do not say that the Italians\r\nwould have permitted their Government to solve the Adriatic question in\r\na safer and more philosophic manner; but we cannot look forward with\r\nthat confidence we should have had if more sagacious counsels had\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement most agreeable to the bulk of the interested population\r\nwould have been effected if two Free States, instead of one, had been\r\ncreated: the small one of Rieka, and a larger one embracing Triest and\r\nthe western part of Istria. There would be in each of these two States a\r\nmixed population, who would think with a shudder of the time when the\r\ngrass was growing on their quays. Italians and Slavs, prosperous as of\r\nold, would very cordially agree that the experiment of being included in\r\nItaly had been at any rate a commercial disaster. [D'Annunzio's\r\nadministration was, of course, a mere camouflage. Without the support of\r\nthe Italian Government, which paid his troops though calling them\r\nrebels, the poet-adventurer could scarcely have lasted for a day; and\r\nthe swarm of officers, many of them worse adventurers than himself,\r\nwould have deserted him. Nor would the population of Rieka have listened\r\nto his glowing periods if the Italian Government had not, under cover of\r\nthe Red Cross, sent an adequate supply of food into the town.] Both\r\nRieka and Triest were, therefore, living under practically the same\r\nconditions, separated from their natural hinterland, and knowing very\r\nwell that as Italian towns their prospects were lamentable. It was\r\nsignificant that the Italian Government should after a time have studied\r\nthe scheme of constructing a canal from Triest to the Save. Before the\r\nWar one-third of the urban population (and all the surrounding country)\r\nwas Yugoslav; and now, when so many Yugoslavs have departed and so many\r\nItalians have arrived, even now it is certain that in a plebiscite not\r\n10 per cent. would vote for Italy--and this minority would be largely\r\nmade up of those _leccapiatini_ (the \"plate-lickers\") who were the\r\nhumbler servants of Austria during the War and are now begging for\r\nItalian plates. When the offices of the Socialist newspaper _Il\r\nLavoratore_--the Socialists are by far the most important party in\r\nTriest--were taken by storm and gutted, the American Consul, Mr. Joseph\r\nHaven, and the Paris correspondent of the _New York Herald_, Mr. Eyre,\r\nhappened to be in the building. They afterwards said that the attack by\r\nthose ultra-nationalist bands, the fascisti--very young men,\r\ndemobilized junior officers and so forth--was entirely unprovoked. The\r\ncarabinieri gazed indifferently at the scene. Such is life in Triest,\r\nwhere the labour movement is gaining in strength every day. Its old\r\nprosperity has departed--there is hardly any trade or water or gas,\r\nsince most of the coal was consumed, by order of the Italian\r\nauthorities, in making electric light for illuminations. These were\r\nintended to show the city's irrepressible enthusiasm at being\r\nincorporated in the kingdom of Italy. But the inhabitants know very well\r\nthat being one of Italy's many ports is worse than being the only port\r\nof Austria; they know that the most direct railways to Austria pass\r\nthrough Yugoslav territory, that henceforward the Danube will be much\r\nmore largely used by Austria, Czecho-Slovakia and Hungary (none of whom\r\nhad a seaboard) and that Rieka will now be a more formidable rival than\r\nof old.... So, too, at Pola we find that a majority of the population do\r\nnot wish their town to be retained in Italy; a number of Italian workmen\r\nfled from the idle shipbuilding yards and actually came in 1919 and 1920\r\nwith the Slovene refugees, their fellow-townsmen, to Ljubljana in search\r\nof employment. There are not sufficient orders to go round among such\r\nyards in Italy where, owing to the absence of coal and iron, this\r\nparticular industry labours under great disadvantages. But if Rome\r\nconsiders that the retention of Pola is strategically essential, then in\r\norder to meet her wishes this town might be taken out of the\r\nTriest-Istrian Free State--maybe the Italians will be able to do\r\nsomething that will cause the citizens to cease regretting those good\r\ndays of old when, as Austria's chief naval base, she flourished on the\r\nlargesse of officers and men. But what can she do, and what could\r\nanybody do? Hundreds of houses are deserted; and for the year 1920 the\r\nowners of the theatre--which did not engage expensive actors but relied\r\nmainly on cinema--were faced with a deficit of 12,000 lire.\r\n\r\nThe Triest-Istrian Free State would approximately contain, without Pola,\r\nsome 300,000 inhabitants, half Italian and half Yugoslav. The formation\r\nof this State would be less advantageous to the Yugoslavs, for most of\r\nthe big landowners and the shop-keepers are Italians who live on the\r\nYugoslav peasants; but Yugoslavia, for the sake of peace, would be glad\r\nto see the State come into existence. Eastern and central Istria,\r\nforming a part of Yugoslavia and lying between the two Free States,\r\nshould extend to Porto di Bado, which would cause it to possess about\r\n3,000 Italians and 280,000 Yugoslavs. If it were to be bounded by the\r\nAr[vs]a it would make the Italians in the Triest-Istrian State become a\r\nminority.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the indisputable Slav districts east of the Isonzo,\r\n_i.e._ the territory of Gorica-Gradi[vs]ca and an appreciable part of\r\nCarniola, which have been adjudged to Italy and which long to be joined\r\nto the Yugoslav State, there are two possible solutions. (In passing we\r\nmay observe that there is no country where the national frontier is more\r\nclearly indicated. The linguistic frontier is so strictly defined that\r\nthe peasant on one side of it does not speak Italian and his neighbour\r\non the other side does not understand the Slovene tongue. Nevertheless,\r\nSignor Colajanni, the venerable leader of the Italian Republicans, took\r\nup an undemocratic point of view and declined to admit the argument of\r\nthe superiority of numbers, when he alluded to this frontier in a speech\r\nto the Republican Congress at Naples. Waving numbers aside, he preferred\r\nto appeal to history and culture, though he should have known that the\r\nmass of the Slovene people is much better educated than the Italian\r\npeasant.) The true ethnographical boundary would be the Isonzo--not many\r\nYugoslavs live to the west and not many Italians to the east of that\r\nriver. Only in the town of Gorica do we find Italians. In 1910 at the\r\ncensus the Italian municipal authorities attempted to show that their\r\ntown was almost entirely Italian; at a subsequent census the Austrians\r\nfound that the returns had been largely falsified, and that in reality\r\nGorica contained 14,000 Italians and 12,000 Slovenes, while it is common\r\nknowledge that if you go 500 yards from the town you meet nothing but\r\nSlovenes. The prosperity of Gorica was mostly based on the export of\r\nfruit and vegetables from the Slovene countryside. In 1898 the Slovenes\r\nawakened, formed societies, started in business on a large scale and\r\nboycotted the Italian merchants, who found themselves obliged to learn\r\nthe Slovene language. Suppose that, for the sake of meeting the wishes\r\nof the Italian Nationalists, one half of the town were given to Italy,\r\nthen that portion would be faced with ruin. It would, therefore, be\r\nadvisable that the whole town should remain with its hinterland, and\r\nthat Italy and Yugoslavia should be divided from each other by the\r\nIsonzo. But if this solution is impossible, then a large district east\r\nof the Isonzo should be entirely and permanently neutralized, which\r\nwould not endanger the security of either State. Very different in\r\ncharacter is the line Triglav-Idria-Sneznik, which the Italians hold\r\nostensibly as a means of defence, but which is an offensive line against\r\nYugoslavia, and primarily against Ljubljana and Karlovac.\r\n\r\nNo doubt as the Italians in the eastern Adriatic have obtained a regular\r\nposition by the Treaty of Rapallo they will henceforth do their best to\r\nwin the love of their new subjects. They will disavow such officers as\r\nthat one on the sandy isle of Unie who accused the Slav priest of\r\npropaganda, and in fact, as we have mentioned elsewhere, expelled him\r\nfor the reason that inside his church, where they had been for many\r\nyears, stood monuments of the two Slav apostles, SS. Cyril and Methodus.\r\nSt. Methodus was the wise administrator of these two--but even if he\r\ntakes the rulers of the eastern Adriatic under his particular protection\r\none must be prepared for them to fail in smothering, by their\r\nenlightened rule, the discontent which in the last three years has grown\r\namong the Yugoslavs to such acute proportions. It began, as we have\r\nnoted, under the aegis of Baron Sonnino; the old neighbour,\r\nAustria-Hungary, had been Italy's hereditary foe, and the Baron's school\r\ncould not bring itself to regard the new neighbours in a friendly light,\r\nalthough their house was so much less populated than that of their\r\npredecessors, not to mention that of the Italians themselves.\r\n\r\nThere have been times during the last three years when a war between\r\nItaly and Yugoslavia seemed scarcely avoidable--the natives of the\r\ndistricts most concerned were looking forward to it with eagerness. At a\r\nYugoslav assembly held in Triest in the summer of 1919 the other\r\ndelegates were electrified by two priests from Istria who declared that\r\ntheir people were straining at the leash, anxious for the word to snatch\r\nup their weapons. (Many of these weapons, by the way, were of Italian\r\norigin, as there had been no great difficulty in purchasing them from\r\nthe more pacific or the more Socialistic Italian soldiers; the usual\r\nprice was ten lire for a rifle and a hundred rounds.) If there should\r\ncome about a war between Italy and Yugoslavia, then it is to be supposed\r\nthat the Yugoslavs will afterwards take as their western frontier the\r\nold frontier of Austria (except for the Friuli district, south of\r\nCormons, which they do not covet, since they look upon this ancient race\r\nas Italian.)\r\n\r\nBy signing the Treaty of Rapallo the Yugoslav Government has shown that\r\nit is ready to go to very great lengths in order to establish, as\r\nsecurely as may be, an era of peace. It would be just as creditable on\r\nthe part of the Italians if they will consent to Istria being\r\npartitioned in the way we have suggested, for they have been wrongly\r\ntaught to think themselves entitled to this country, and to believe that\r\nthe inhabitants, as a whole, are glad to be Italian subjects. \"You may\r\nsuppose we are unpatriotic,\" the Austrian railway officials of Italian\r\nnationality used to say, \"but as Austria gives much better pay than we\r\nshould receive from Italy, we prefer that this part of the world should\r\nbe Austrian.\"\r\n\r\nThe relations between Italy and Yugoslavia have been treated at some\r\nlength, for it would require but little to bring a gathering of\r\nstorm-clouds to the sky. One even hears of Roman Catholics in Istria and\r\nelsewhere abjuring their Church and--for the national cause--adopting\r\nthe Serbian Orthodox faith. Twenty years ago it happened that two\r\nIstrian villages, Ricmanje and Log, went over to the Uniate and thence\r\nto the Orthodox Church. This was on account of a quarrel with the Bishop\r\nof Triest, who wanted, against the wishes of the people, to remove their\r\npriest, Dr. Pojar. But now we have priests in the provinces given to\r\nItaly who are openly calling on their flock to go over with them to\r\ntheir Orthodox brothers; and this is a movement which, it is thought,\r\nwill merely be postponed by the introduction of the Slav liturgy. To\r\ntake a single sermon out of many, we may mention one which in the summer\r\nof 1920 was preached in a church of the Vipava valley. The clergyman,\r\nafter lamenting that the chief dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church\r\nare Italians, gave it as his opinion that there was nothing to choose in\r\npoint of goodness between that particular Church and the Orthodox\r\nChurch. \"And,\" said an old peasant who came to Triest with the story of\r\nwhat had happened, \"never in my life did I hear so fine a sermon and one\r\nthat did me so much good.\"\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 72: The Italians had originally landed a \"hygienic\r\n    mission\" at Valona early in the European War, and this of\r\n    course developed into something else. That ingenuous\r\n    propagandist, Mr. H. E. Goad, tells us (in the _Fortnightly\r\n    Review_ of May 1922) that while Nature had made the innumerable\r\n    deep-water harbours on the eastern coast of the Adriatic\r\n    practically immune from Italy's attack, a landing or raid from\r\n    one of them at Ancona, Bari or Barletta would be a vital blow\r\n    at Italy, severing vital communications. He therefore justifies\r\n    Italy's landing at Valona in that it was a purely defensive\r\n    step, made to ensure that its harbour should not be used\r\n    against her.

When, to give\r\n    an example, Scutari was occupied by the Montenegrins at the\r\n    beginning of the Great War, a Catholic Albanian merchant came\r\n    to a Montenegrin lawyer and asked him to institute proceedings\r\n    against another merchant who had gravely and publicly insulted\r\n    him. The lawyer drew up the complaint, for which he charged the\r\n    small sum of 20 perpers (= francs), but although his client was\r\n    a wealthy man this fee appalled him; he resolved to take no\r\n    further steps. In general, the Scutarenes prefer to suffer\r\n    imprisonment rather than part with any money.

They knew it was unlikely that a man would write at\r\nsuch excessive length about the Southern Slavs if he had not a weakness\r\nfor them, and if he predicted for their State the virtue of cohesion or\r\nmore than very moderate tranquillity, his prejudice would have to be\r\ndiscounted. \"The Yugoslavs,\" said an Italian lady to me in London, and\r\nher beautiful lips looked as if they could scarcely bring themselves to\r\npronounce the name, \"the Yugoslavs,\" she said, \"are very wild and\r\nblack.\" If I have given the impression in this book that they are white,\r\nmy fault will be much greater than the lady's, since I am not quite a\r\nstranger to them. Slovenes, Croats, Serbs and Bulgars--they have good\r\nand evil qualities so different that one must take them separately, and\r\nperhaps it will be more instructive to compare them with each other. The\r\nSlovenes need not detain us; they are a small people occupying a\r\nsurprisingly large area; if they were less well organized they would\r\nhave been long ago swallowed up. They shine as workers in the field and\r\nmine and forest much more than as military men. They have never been\r\nhereditary soldiers, like so many of the Croats, and it is perhaps this\r\nwant of confidence in their own military prowess which has caused them\r\nto take measures that are sometimes too severe against the Austrians who\r\nare under them. The Bosnian Moslems assert that, as all their links with\r\nTurkey are now broken, they are the best Yugoslavs. But the Slovenes are\r\nalso the best Yugoslavs, because they recognize that in Yugoslavia is\r\ntheir sole salvation. Some of us may regret that their tenacity so far\r\noutstrips their idealism. They are a careful people, as may be seen from\r\nOrder No. 17024 which was issued, on December 4, 1920, by the Prefecture\r\nof Ljutomir. Referring to sequestered property, it enjoined that the\r\nAustrian owner should be allowed so much that he could live on it, but\r\nnot so much as to enable him to be extravagant. They are also a\r\nrelatively well-educated people; according to official statistics of\r\n1910, 85.34 per cent. of the Slovene population know how to read and\r\nwrite, while their neighbours to the east, the Magyars, can only reckon\r\n62 per cent. and the Italians of pre-war Italy, 62.4 per cent. The most\r\nbackward part of the Slovene race, those of Istria, have 46.6 per cent.\r\nof illiterates, while there are Italian provinces where the illiterates\r\namount even to 85 per cent. Rome itself counts 65 per cent.[116]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONTENEGRINS AND THE SERBS\r\n\r\nIt will be profitable to compare the Montenegrins with the Serbs,\r\nbecause in our impatience with those persons who would keep them\r\nseparate we may have seemed to imply that we believe them identical. The\r\nSerbs who maintained themselves in those mountains developed certain\r\ncharacteristics which differentiate them from their brothers. The Serb\r\nof the old kingdom walks, the Serb of the mountain struts. The\r\nmagnificent Serbian warrior of the kingdom is so disciplined that\r\nalthough a Field-Marshal will sit down openly in a cafe and drink wine\r\nwith some old comrade who is in the ranks, yet when the soldier is on\r\nduty his obedience is perfect. But if the Montenegrin private thinks\r\nthat his officer has rebuked him unjustly, he will not hesitate to kill\r\nhim. The Serb has a great respect for the national heroes, while every\r\nMontenegrin (for the sake of brevity we will use this term instead of\r\n\"Serb of Montenegro,\" and imply, when using the word Serb, a Serb of the\r\nold kingdom)--as we have said, a Serb respects the national heroes,\r\nwhile every Montenegrin has a knowledge of his own ancestors for at\r\nleast a hundred years. He is a chivalrous person who wishes to be\r\ntreated as at least your equal. It was the Serbs' disregard of this\r\nsentiment which now and then gave umbrage to those Montenegrins who had\r\nexpected that their union with the Serbs would cause an immediate return\r\nof the golden age. This was almost as offensive to the Montenegrins as\r\nthe request that they would now contribute towards the support of the\r\narmy. They had always left this to the Tzar--\"We and the Russians,\" they\r\nused to say, \"are 150 millions.\" Not all the Montenegrins have managed\r\nto emancipate themselves from the thraldom of the clan. An amusing\r\nexample of this was a major at Pe['c] who belonged to the great\r\nVasojevi['c] family. He gave two of us a large lorry, which was the only\r\ncar he had, and advised us to start very early and to take no one with\r\nus, except a guard, as the road to Mitrovica was in a soft condition. We\r\nstarted off with about twenty passengers, but only one of them, a Turk,\r\nhad any luggage to speak of; and after we had gone a good part of the\r\nway we were held up at a military post. A Montenegrin captain, also a\r\nmember of the Vasojevi['c], had overslept himself and ordered us by\r\ntelephone to return for him. The Serbian lieutenant--who had risen from\r\nthe ranks--asked at once if that order would come in writing, and when\r\nhe received a negative answer he cut off the communication and wished us\r\na happy journey. The Montenegrins also differ from the Serbs in their\r\ncultivation of the arts. They have no liking for songs of love, but say\r\nthat men should only listen to the guslar and to hero-songs. They are\r\nseverer and more dignified than the Serbs, and it will be some time\r\nbefore the average Montenegrin throws back his head in a railway\r\ncarriage and rolls out a joyous song, as I once heard a Serb do in the\r\nBanat, whereupon another Serb in the far corner--they obviously had\r\nnever met--joined in the song with great heartiness. The Montenegrin\r\nsays that the Serb chatters like a gipsy (though we must not forget\r\nthat, as Miss Durham remarked,[117] he is hurt if things Serbian are\r\ncriticized by an outsider); he has been told that the Englishman is\r\ngrave, like himself, and therefore he appreciates him from afar. But not\r\nmany Englishmen (or Serbs) would care to indulge, like the Montenegrins,\r\nin the ceaseless recapitulation of time-honoured exploits. The younger\r\nfolk are not so faithful to these ancient stories, but it is in\r\nMontenegro that performers on the one-stringed, monotonous guslar can\r\nmost easily find an audience. The Serbs of the kingdom have become more\r\neclectic in musical matters, though even with them the popular taste is\r\nin favour of the man who snores, on the grounds that he is hearty and\r\nrobust. In so far as foreign influence is concerned, the Montenegrin has\r\nbeen to some extent affected by Italian culture, while that of Greece\r\nand Germany has acted on the Serb. But the Great War had an equally\r\nunfortunate influence on both of them. One must, however, mention that\r\nlong before the War, and owing partly to Albanian influence, partly to\r\ntheir own struggle for existence and partly to other causes, the\r\nMontenegrins had shown themselves defective in straightforwardness.\r\nUndoubtedly they had deteriorated under the example of Nikita, but this\r\nunfortunate trait can also be discerned between the lines of the great\r\npoem, the \"Gorski Venac,\" written in the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. There used to be a certain amount of what we call theft in\r\nMontenegro, but the natives of that country, as of Albania, cherished\r\nrather communistic ideas; it seemed to them that they had a sort of\r\nright to that which another possessed, particularly if he was a near\r\nrelative. After the War the Montenegrin was so much impoverished that he\r\nstole more freely, and the Serb, whose hands had hitherto been\r\nremarkably clean, took to the same habits and often in a very amateur\r\nfashion. Thus in a Macedonian village where a British army store had\r\nbeen rifled, the officers turned to the local priest, who was indignant\r\nwith his people and conducted the officers into every house. Nothing was\r\ndiscovered, and the priest proposed that his own house should be\r\nsearched. He was told that this was unnecessary, but he insisted; and\r\nwhen his careless wife led the way up a ladder into the loft a British\r\nofficer perceived at any rate one pair of khaki breeches. The patients\r\nof the Scottish Women's Hospital at Belgrade were so unpractised in the\r\nart of stealing that one of them--a typical case--returned one day to\r\nhave her leg attended to, and in raising her skirt revealed on the\r\npetticoat, which had once been a tablecloth, a large \"S.W.H.\" These\r\nfelonious ways are in contrast with the usual Serb candour. One\r\nafternoon in Belgrade I was searching for a small street in a district\r\nwhich I had not visited before. When at last, after many inquiries, I\r\ncame to within fifty yards of it I found a policeman--but it is only\r\nfair to say that the majority of the force consisted at this time of\r\nsoldiers recently disbanded. When I asked him where the street might be,\r\nthe good man thought a while and then, throwing back his open hand and\r\ngiving up the problem in despair, said, \"My God, I know not.\"\r\n\r\nThe wave of crime has manifested itself differently among the Serbs and\r\nthe Montenegrins, in that the latter have been more primitive and have\r\nconsummated their plundering by assassination--and this in a country\r\nwhere between 1895 and 1913 only two men were murdered for their money.\r\nIn Serbia the people, even in the terrible distress after the War, did\r\nnot go to such lengths. During the first half-year, the only two cases\r\nof unnatural death in the whole district of [vC]a[vc]ak, where I spent a\r\ncouple of months, were both of them suicides, an old man hanging himself\r\non account of the death of his last remaining soldier son, and an\r\nofficer's wife, who had been too friendly to an Austrian, throwing\r\nherself into a well on her husband's return. A certain village of the\r\nsame district is an instance of the frequency of all those minor\r\npeccadilloes, such as drunkenness and rowdiness and so forth, which the\r\nSerbs permit themselves. There is a law which lays it down that the\r\nmayor must be a native and must be a man who never has been lodged in\r\ngaol. But that unhappy village in the [vC]a[vc]ak region is unable to\r\nproduce a single adult man with such a record.... If the Serb of the old\r\nkingdom is a more easy-going individual than his brother of the\r\nmountains it is quite erroneous to think that they dislike each other or\r\nhave not resolved to come together.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROATS AND THE SERBS\r\n\r\nSome of Yugoslavia's neighbours were anxious, during the months which\r\nfollowed the War, that we should learn how Serb and Croat were\r\ncontinually at each other's throat. The dissensions between the two\r\nbranches of the Yugoslav family would have been much more serious and\r\nmore prolonged if their neighbours had paid less attention to them. It\r\nis true that \"our Serbian customs,\" in the words of Ja[vs]a Tomi['c],\r\n\"come from the village, while those of the Croats come from the nobles.\"\r\nThe humbler Croat, one may say, was an employee in a big store, while\r\nthe Serb was a small trader. The Croat would naturally like to introduce\r\nthe big-store system into Yugoslavia, but this the Serb does not\r\nunderstand. He has a greater sense of responsibility and is more careful\r\nwith regard to the expenses. To the Croat, in the old Empire, it was\r\nimmaterial whether the officials were more or less costly. The bill was\r\npaid by Austria, who was the foe. For some time the Croat found himself\r\nforgetting that he was in Yugoslavia. When Cardinal Bourne came to\r\nZagreb in the spring of 1919 and the town-hall was decorated with the\r\nBritish, Croatian, Serbian, Slovene and the town flag, some one asked\r\nthe mayor why the State flag had been omitted. He was horrified. \"The\r\nState flag!\" he cried. Then it dawned upon him.... Numbers of Croats\r\nhave belonged to the governing class and--impelled by the Catholic\r\nreligion--have displayed more devotion to the arts than to the freedom\r\nof their country. On the other hand the Serbs, a race of practical\r\npeasants, have a highly developed national consciousness. This they owe\r\npartly to their inborn political gifts and largely to their Church, for\r\nthe Orthodox religion--one may say, I think, without injustice--has more\r\nfrequently shown itself, so closely is it connected with the idea of the\r\nState, to be rather of this world than of another. One should say the\r\nOrthodox religion as it flourishes in the Balkans, for when the Russian\r\nGeneral Bobrikoff, who was attached to the person of King Milan, came\r\nback with him to Belgrade after the Peace of San Stefano, he was\r\nscandalized to see that religion had no greater share in the national\r\nrejoicings. \"Accustomed as I was in my own country,\" he said, \"to see\r\nnothing done without prayers and the blessing of the Church, I was\r\nindeed astounded to observe that the priests played the part of\r\nofficials even in the cathedral, and often were altogether absent.\" This\r\nreminds one of von Baernreiter, who wished to learn the Serbian\r\nlanguage, so that he would be more eligible for the governorship of\r\nBosnia. He asked his teacher at Vienna when one could hear sermons in\r\nthe Serbian church, and was informed that these occurred but twice a\r\nyear and that on those occasions everybody left the church. The Serb and\r\nthe Bulgar have come to neglect our distinctions between that which is\r\nspiritual and that which is temporal; their religion is, in consequence\r\nof their history, so inherent a part of the nation's life that in losing\r\nit one would almost cease to be a Serb or a Bulgar. Their Church is as\r\nnational as that of the Armenians.[118] This may not be an ideal state\r\nof things, but it prevailed in Spain under the Moorish oppression and in\r\nthe France of Jeanne d'Arc. During the crisis of the Great War the\r\nchurches in the West were everywhere national; and in Serbia it was\r\ncalculated that 60 per cent. of the sermons had a pronounced national\r\ncolouring....\r\n\r\nNow with these differences between the Croat and the Serb, does it not\r\nseem strange that the vast majority of them are for union, with a part\r\nof this majority in favour of a reasonable decentralization? But if we\r\ninvestigate the motives of the Serbs and Croats who would thwart this\r\nunion, we will see that they have nothing of that faith which, after all\r\nthese centuries, has moved the Yugoslav multitude. Some of the Serbs\r\nwish to keep aloof on the ground that Serbia in the last hundred years\r\nhas borne the brunt of the battle--and this, whether they were or were\r\nnot faced with a more difficult situation, is acknowledged by most of\r\nthe Croats, who for that reason would never dream of wishing the more\r\nmodern Zagreb to supplant Belgrade. Those few Croats who are not for\r\nYugoslavia are moved by ecclesiastical prejudice or by their longing for\r\nthe privileges which the Habsburgs granted them. But those who, for\r\nvarious reasons, criticize the central Government are by no means\r\nnecessarily in favour of setting up a separate one. Whatever the\r\nimpetuous Radi['c] may have said, he is out for Yugoslavia. Still one\r\ncannot be astonished that he was sometimes misunderstood. The Zagreb\r\nstudents who, towards the end of 1918, came to Svetozar Pribi[vc]evi['c]\r\nwith the request that he would let them kill the demagogue, were for\r\nexpressing in this way what Dr. Du[vs]an Popovi['c], the well-known\r\ndeputy, expressed in another. It was at the Zagreb Provincial Parliament\r\nthat he exclaimed, in the summer of 1918, that \"This idea will be\r\nvictorious and therefore I say publicly, in the presence of the whole\r\npeople, that I am a Croat, a Serb and a Slovene, or, if you prefer it,\r\nnone of them but merely a Yugoslav.\" In 1914 when Stambouluesky, the\r\nfuture Prime Minister of Bulgaria, was arrested and accused of\r\nSerbophilism, he declared: \"I am neither Bulgar or Serb; I am a\r\nYugoslav!\" ... For at least a generation Zagreb will remain\r\nparticularist, zealously preserving the differences--personal, social\r\nand religious--which distinguish her people from the dominant Serbs. The\r\nCroat officers who burned with shame at the Archduke's murder on Bosnian\r\nsoil, the Croat regiments that in 1915 marched into Belgrade with bands\r\nplaying and their colours flying, the Croat officials whose bread and\r\nsalt came from the Habsburgs in administering Yugoslav countries during\r\nthe War--all these will not forget a long, deep-rooted and honourable\r\ntradition. But Zagreb is now even as Munich was in 1866; after having\r\nbeen the Rome of the Yugoslav movement, the seat of its philosophy and\r\nthe centre of its politics, the Croat capital has now an atmosphere of\r\nsad futility, for Belgrade is the beacon of the Yugoslav world. While\r\ncomparing Zagreb with Rome one must add that she had also the misfortune\r\nto resemble Rome of the decadence--a good deal of outer polish was\r\nimparted by the Austrians, at the expense of their victims' backbone.\r\nThe five centuries of Turkish domination had no such demoralizing\r\ninfluence upon the Serbs, especially not in the country places. In the\r\nopinion of a very close observer,[119] whom I quote, there is nothing\r\nthat so thoroughly displays the dominance of Belgrade as the agrarian\r\nproblem. The projected reforms, which have been based on the principle\r\nthat no one should own more land than he can cultivate with the aid of\r\nhis family, would dispossess large numbers of big landowners in Croatia\r\nand still larger numbers of men with moderate holdings, whose\r\ncompensation would be \"determined hereafter.\" The application of these\r\nreforms has been delayed for various reasons, but nowhere at any time\r\nhas it been suggested that Croatia might reject them. In the old kingdom\r\nof Serbia, with much the greater part of the land in peasant possession,\r\nit may be said that there is no agrarian problem.... Those enemies of\r\nYugoslavia, by the way, who have hoped that the particularism of Croatia\r\nwould be something altogether different from what it is, should have\r\nmingled with the crowd at Zagreb on the evening of Prince Alexander's\r\narrival in July 1920. The Prince interrupted his dinner, came out on to\r\nthe balcony and made a speech. \"Draga moja bratjo Hrvati,\" he\r\nsaid--\"Croatians, my dear brothers.\" Not for a thousand years had a\r\nruler of Croatia addressed his people in their own tongue. One immense\r\nroar of delight broke, as the _Morning Post's_ special correspondent\r\ntells us, from the assembled multitude; men fell on each other's necks,\r\nlaughed, wept and kissed each other.... Such manifestations must not\r\nlead us to believe that all the internal problems of the young State are\r\nsettled. Croatia (as also Slovenia) is jealous of her separate identity,\r\nsuspicious to some extent of Serbia, her prestige and projects; she has\r\nno intention of allowing herself, after the hard fight against\r\nMagyarization, to be \"Balkanized.\" But one thing was made clear by the\r\nPrince's visit: there can be no word or thought of separation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the disaffection prevalent among the Croats, and on\r\nthis the world has fixed its eyes, because of the large number of Croat\r\ndeputies who have hitherto declined to come to Belgrade. Nevertheless\r\nthere is a more general and more grievous discontent in Yugoslavia,\r\nsince, after all, the Croats' attitude is of a temporary character--for\r\nit is probable that after the next general election their peculiar\r\nupbringing will not be so potent in determining their sentiments\r\ntowards the State. More and more will they be ready to make common cause\r\nwith Serbs and Slovenes; and their criticisms, which are now so\r\nnegative, will be of a more useful kind. (They will recognize, for\r\nexample, that if it costs 3000 dinars to open an inn in Serbia they were\r\nnot justified in protesting when the fee in Croatia was raised from 5\r\ncrowns to 5 dinars.) That Yugoslavia gives ground for criticism no one,\r\nleast of all her well-wishers, deny. And those who pray that she will\r\nprosper do so for the reason that the scattered Southern Slavs have for\r\nthe first time now been able--most of them at any rate--to link their\r\narms together; and we hope that with high qualities outweighing their\r\ndefects the Southern Slavs will permanently take their place among the\r\nnations. But this will not be brought about unless those ailments which\r\nthey suffer from are now confronted. Serbs themselves are often saying\r\nthat their little Serbia was better than this fine new country which is\r\nthrice as large. She had fewer problems, she had fewer parties, and if\r\npeople were corrupt they were so on a smaller scale. Traditions which\r\nare deprecatingly called Balkan, but which were at that time suited to a\r\nBalkan country, should not be allowed to spread across a country which\r\nis so much more than Balkan. Merit does not everywhere in this imperfect\r\nworld advance you automatically, but an effort is required in Yugoslavia\r\nto resist the calls of friendship in appointing men to offices. The army\r\nof officials is too numerous; yet many of them are so badly paid that\r\neven if a great reformer could reduce by half their numbers he would be\r\ninclined to lay no hand upon the total sum they now enjoy. But this\r\nnecessity of cleansing the public services is not peculiar to\r\nYugoslavia. The politicians must have courage to lay heavier taxes on\r\nthe peasants: the strange phenomenon is seen of peasants who assert that\r\nthey are quite prepared for this, and on the other hand of politicians\r\nwho are frightened lest it lose them many votes. The peasants generally\r\nare so prosperous that some, for instance, whom I know of near\r\nKragujevac, men occupied in growing cereals, find that the fowls which\r\nthey keep rather as a hobby do not have to lay them golden eggs in order\r\nto pay all the taxes. In that region it is usual nowadays for peasants\r\nnot to count their bank-notes, but to weigh them; recently a man\r\ndisposed of certain fields for his own weight in notes of ten dinars.\r\nThe peasants are not only dissatisfied with the two chief parties, the\r\nRadicals and the Democrats, for not taxing them sufficiently--so that at\r\nthe next general election they may give a good deal more support than\r\nhitherto to their own Peasants' party--but they complain that their\r\ninterests are neglected although, as we have seen, the lawyers and other\r\ntownsfolk of the Radical and Democrat parties are so anxious with\r\nrespect to peasants' votes.\r\n\r\nThe difficult position of the Yugoslavs--observe how in the last year\r\ntheir exchange has fallen--is due in part to the deplorable activities\r\nof other peoples (vast amounts have had to be imported for\r\nreconstruction purposes, Rieka has been practically unavailable as a\r\nport, and conditions have been such that the Yugoslavs have had to keep\r\na large army mobilized), partly their position is due to measures\r\nill-advised but which they were compelled to take (such as their system\r\nof Agrarian Reform), partly to political inexperience and partly to\r\ntheir lack of organizing powers. Let us hope that from now onwards\r\nYugoslavia will have to arm herself less heavily against the slings and\r\narrows of the world, and that she will be able therefore to become a\r\nmore proficient swimmer in this sea of troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERB AND BULGAR\r\n\r\nA map of the Balkan migrations, with its curved lines leading almost\r\neverywhere, is a bewildering spectacle; but if we study the main\r\nclusters of lines we shall see that the people whose movements they\r\nchronicle have frequently preserved, in a remarkable fashion, certain\r\ncommon characteristics: thus a stream flowed from the south-west towards\r\nValjevo in Serbia, and it is interesting to notice how the prominent men\r\nof that region, whose ancestors came from somewhere between Montenegro\r\nand the old frontiers of Serbia, have all of them certain\r\ncharacteristics--a talent for foreign languages, a subtlety of\r\nreasoning, originality but insufficient observation, and clever but\r\nfallacious minds. Similarly in the Bulgar there are qualities which even\r\nnow can be ascribed to the Mongol blood. The Bulgar is more stolid than\r\nthe Serb; he is less given to sympathy and on that account can be cruel.\r\nThe Bulgar is benevolent because he is urged by kindliness, whereas the\r\nmore impressionable Serb is under the influence both of sentiment,\r\nsentimentality and sympathy. These differences of temperament--and there\r\nare others, more or less distinguishable--do not seem to Balkan thinkers\r\nany reason why the two should keep apart. And a couple of months after\r\nthe Great War, during which the Bulgars, as their best friends must\r\nacknowledge, were far from irreproachable in occupied Serbia--partly\r\nthis was due to the vast number of new posts for which they had no\r\nsuitable men--a few months afterwards a Bulgarian engineer was placidly\r\nworking among the Serbs at [vC]a[vc]ak railway station, wearing his own\r\nuniform. And a Serbian butcher who emigrated to Bulgaria settled down at\r\nFerdinand just before the War and has lived there unmolested up to this\r\nday, and that in spite of his not being very highly esteemed--for, as\r\nthe police president told me, he had married a woman with more wealth\r\nthan good fame; the president had been among her lovers.... One would\r\nnot suppose that the contrasting public morality of the two countries\r\nwill keep them apart. It is easy enough for us to argue that this\r\nmorality is on a pretty low level, because a Bulgarian War Minister saw\r\nfit to sue, under a _nom de guerre_, a French armament firm which\r\nomitted to send him the stipulated commission; because another Minister,\r\nincarcerated on account of felony, could be liberated by the grace of\r\nTzar Ferdinand and become Premier; because a Serbian Minister used to\r\nbuy himself corner-houses, while his Bulgarian colleagues seem to own\r\nmost of the houses in Sofia. There was a minor Serbian official over\r\nagainst whom I took my meals for about a month; one of his ways was to\r\nproduce a pocket-knife and cut his bread with it. Certain other parts of\r\nhis ritual did not appeal to me, but who knows whether I did not disgust\r\nhim by breaking my bread with my fingers? And who knows what sentiments\r\nwere awakened some years ago at the Orthodox monastery of Gromirija, in\r\nCroatia, when a foreign guest proposed to wash himself in water, though\r\nby the joyous custom of that house there was no other liquid on the\r\npremises but wine? If there is in both countries, in Serbia and\r\nBulgaria, a movement against the cynicism which does not clothe its\r\ncorruption with a decent Western drapery, that is something; if there is\r\na further movement in the direction of probity, that is something more.\r\nAnd, whatever some Serbs may tell you, it is undeniable that honesty has\r\nmade important strides in the public life of that kingdom, even without\r\nhaving added to the Statute Book those rigorous proposals of the\r\nnewly-formed Peasants' party, one of which would punish a peculating\r\nofficial with death. It is, however, apparent that this party has not\r\narrived at a sense of discretion, for it wants to terminate the practice\r\nof allowing pensions to officials, so that each man is obliged to make\r\nhis own provision for old age. Bulgaria, the younger country, has made a\r\nproportionate progress; there is trustworthy German evidence to the\r\neffect that the corrupt Radoslavoff Government was despised by the\r\npeople, not in the hour of disaster but in 1916, when the Bulgarian\r\nsoldiers changed the words of an anti-Serb song and instead of \"Our old\r\nallies are brigands\" proclaimed that \"the Liberals are brigands.\" This\r\nGerman, Dr. Helmut von den Steinen, the correspondent of the\r\n_Nordeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_ (in which he was bound to speak\r\nfavourably of Radoslavoff) used to deliver propaganda lectures in the\r\nBulgarian language at Sofia during the War. He was very well acquainted\r\nwith Bulgarian affairs and being summoned to Berlin at the end of 1917\r\nhe made a speech[120] _in camera_ to a committee of German savants and\r\nartists. In the course of this he lamented that his country had attached\r\nherself to Radoslavoff, who, said he, was hated and would at the next\r\nelections be swept away.\r\n\r\nAs one must repeat _ad nauseam_, the gulf between Serb and Bulgar has\r\nnot been caused by an extreme divergence of their private or their\r\npublic morals, academically considered, but by the various incidents\r\nwhich in the eyes of each of them testified to the other's depravity.\r\nAnd at the bottom of it all was Macedonia--Macedonia which now, being\r\nwisely administered, will be the foundation-stone of Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his book, _Balkan Problems and European Peace_, Mr. Noel\r\nBuxton agrees that such a Yugoslav Federation has become a practical\r\npossibility. But his two alternative proposals with respect to what\r\nshould meanwhile be the fate of Macedonia would indefinitely postpone\r\nthat Federation. We have already dealt with the proposal of autonomy,\r\nput forward also by Mr. Leland Buxton. As for what Mr. Noel Buxton calls\r\nthe ideal solution--\"a plebiscite conducted by an impartial\r\ninternational commission over the whole of the historical province of\r\nMacedonia\"--this is aiming no higher than at a perpetuation of the two\r\ndistinct countries, Serbia and Bulgaria. We should probably have had\r\nmore plebiscites in Europe if more Allied armies had been available, but\r\nthe campaign of intimidation and every sort of ruthlessness which\r\noccurred in Upper Silesia and Schleswig make us look rather askance upon\r\nthis method of registering the popular will. Mr. Buxton airily asks for\r\na plebiscite over the whole of the historical province of Macedonia,\r\nignoring altogether the special difficulty that \"Macedonia\" means\r\nsomething quite different to the Serb, the Bulgar and the Greek. He\r\ndismisses likewise the universal difficulty of plebiscites, which is to\r\nbe just in laying down the limits of the various regions. But there is\r\nreally no need for Mr. Buxton to take us on to those quagmires, since he\r\nknows, and is good enough to tell us, what the result of the plebiscite\r\nwill be. \"The Bulgarian sympathies,\" says he, \"of the mass of the\r\nMacedonian population are apparent to every inquiring traveller.\" If Mr.\r\nBuxton were to encounter one of those pretty lawless Karaka[vc]an\r\nnomads, who from the Monastir district wander all over the Balkans, his\r\nrecognition of the man's Roman and Thraco-Illyrian descent would be\r\nfacilitated by the permanent cheesy odour which pervades his person.\r\nThere is nothing so permanent about the Macedonian Slav. His\r\nsympathies, as is natural, have gone out to that Balkan country which\r\ncultivated him and since, as Dr. Milovanovi['c], the Serbian statesman,\r\nsays, \"the Serbs did not begin to think about Macedonia till 1885,\" it\r\nwould indeed have been extraordinary if the Macedonian Slavs--whose\r\nethnical position, as scientists agree, is such a vague one--had been\r\ngenerally drawn to Serbia. One cannot help feeling that in this book Mr.\r\nBuxton does a serious disservice to his reputation as a Balkan expert.\r\nHe says that Serbia until the accession of King Peter was Austrophil;\r\nwhich is, to put it mildly, a very sweeping remark--only that party\r\nwhich called itself Progressive was identified with Milan's views. He\r\npraises the Bulgars for being devoted to their national Church, and\r\npraises them for producing a large number of Protestants, whose\r\nsincerity, etc., so that one presumes he would have praised them still\r\nmore if the whole nation, as was once on the cards, had joined the\r\nProtestant Church. Save me from my friends! the Bulgars might say. What\r\nis perfectly sincere about them is their patriotism; and while some of\r\nthose who now change their religion have doubtless no ulterior, personal\r\nmotive, the entire country would probably have as little reluctance as\r\nJapan in adopting any religion which, like the Exarchist Church of\r\nto-day, would be an instrument of the national cause. Mr. Buxton's\r\nknowledge of the Balkan protagonists has its limitations; for example,\r\nprior to Bulgaria's entry into the War he was all for the removal of the\r\nBritish Minister on account of his pro-Serbian sympathies, but he says\r\nno word about M. Savinsky, the Russian Minister, who was left by his\r\nEntente colleagues to play the first violin. This capricious gentleman\r\nwas no diplomat, but a courtier. He did not even protest when German\r\nmunitions for Turkey passed through Roumania, and far too much of his\r\ntime was spent in motoring with pretty girls in the neighbourhood of\r\nSofia. Many good observers were of opinion that with a more competent\r\nRussian representative, such as M. Nekludoff, who in 1914 was\r\ntransferred to Stockholm, the situation would have been saved. In their\r\nmemorandum submitted in January 1915 to Lord (then Sir Edward) Grey,\r\nMessrs. N. and C. R. Buxton said that their experience of fifteen years\r\nconvinced them that the Bulgarian sentiment of the Macedonians could\r\nnot in a short time be made to give way to another national sentiment.\r\nIf we rule out, as being slaves of circumstance, all the Macedonians who\r\nnow tell you that from Bulgar they have changed to Serb, there is no\r\nreason why we should not credit those who are so weary of the rival\r\nactivities of both parties that they wish for peace and nothing else.\r\nThey would follow, not the Messrs. Buxton, but the priest of the\r\nBulgarian village of Chuprenia, who told me that he held that one might\r\npray to God for the success of the Bulgarian arms, without saying\r\nwhether they were in the right or in the wrong. After the end of the war\r\nthis priest sent a telegram, which was perhaps a little indiscreet,\r\nadvocating that the Bulgarian people should join in Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the Southern Slavs being torn by internal strife, it is\r\nnecessary between Serbia and Bulgaria that one of them should for a time\r\nbe paramount. We may be confident that Serbia will not abuse her\r\nposition. In fact it is the opinion of a Roumanian lady at Monastir that\r\nthe Serbs were uncommonly rash in taking into their service so many who\r\nonce had called themselves Bulgars and now maintain that they are Serbs.\r\nBut Serbia has become relatively so strong that she can be indulgent.\r\nShe will even satisfy that Bulgarian professor who is said to have\r\ndiscussed the Macedonian question with the British military attache.\r\n\r\nThe attache suggested a division between Serbia and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the professor; \"let the country remain a whole, like the\r\nchild before Solomon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you be satisfied?\" asked the attache, \"if this question were now\r\ndecided once and for all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the professor, \"if the judge be another Solomon.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Bulgars who are looking forward to the day when their country\r\nwill, in some form or other, join Yugoslavia, there are some who suggest\r\nthat when comparative tranquillity has been assured upon the Macedonian\r\nfrontiers (that is to say, between Macedonia and the Albanians) it would\r\nbe as well to garrison the province with Croatian regiments, pending\r\nthe employment in their own country of Macedonian troops. Gradually the\r\ntime will come when, as one of the units of the Yugoslav State,\r\nMacedonia will enjoy the same amount of Home Rule as the other\r\nprovinces. She will then, maybe, decide for herself such matters as the\r\npreservation of her dialects, local administration, police, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce on the banks of the Danube when I was going to sail from one of\r\nthese countries to her neighbour with whom she had recently been at war,\r\nand some of the inhabitants had kindly come to see me off, I was\r\npresented, amongst other things, with an old gentleman's good wishes,\r\nwhich he had taken the trouble to express in French and in verse. I\r\nbelieve that he recited them, but there was a considerable tumult on the\r\nlanding-stage. Then a very angry traveller appropriated one of my ears\r\nand began to tell me that they were for detaining him in this country;\r\nthree or four natives of the country reported, simultaneously, into my\r\nother ear that he had been letting off his revolver and was altogether a\r\ndangerous man. I was to settle whether he should sail or not, and\r\nmeanwhile his luggage had been put ashore. He waved his passport in my\r\nface. Both he and his opponents were gesticulating with great violence,\r\nand this they continued to do even after I filled their hands with most\r\nof the small and large bouquets which the friendly people had brought\r\ndown for me. There was so much noise that the boat's whistle, which the\r\ncaptain started, was no more than a forest-tree soaring slightly over\r\nthose around it. As I tried to disentangle myself from those who\r\nencircled me I caught sight of the old gentleman of the poem--in\r\nappearance he was a smaller edition of the late Dr. Butler of Trinity;\r\nhe was clearly nervous lest I should depart without his lines, which he\r\nextended towards me, written on the back of one of his visiting-cards. I\r\nwas just then being told by the agitated traveller that he had only been\r\nfiring into the air because it was Easter, and that this was his\r\ninvariable custom at midnight on Easter-Eve. The explanation was so\r\nsatisfactory that everyone welcomed my suggestion that he should sail\r\nand that they should send his revolver on to him by parcel post. They\r\nall shook hands with him. The two nationalities were on excellent terms.\r\nAnd we may transfer the old gentleman's good wishes to them and the\r\nother Yugoslavs:\r\n\r\n    Oh! la belle journee de votre bonheur,\r\n    Souhaitons votre bon voyage tout-a-l'heure.\r\n    Couronne de grands succes du ciel je vous implore,\r\n    Allegresse, sante et prosperite je vous augure.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 116: Cf. _Modern Italy_, by Giovanni Borghese.
