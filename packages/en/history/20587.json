The existence of integrated rather than segregated armed forces\r\nis an important factor in our military establishment today. The\r\nexperiences in World War II and the postwar pressures generated by the\r\ncivil rights movement compelled all the services--Army, Navy, Air\r\nForce, and Marine Corps--to reexamine their traditional practices of\r\nsegregation. While there were differences in the ways that the\r\nservices moved toward integration, all were subject to the same\r\ndemands, fears, and prejudices and had the same need to use their\r\nresources in a more rational and economical way. All of them reached\r\nthe same conclusion: traditional attitudes toward minorities must give\r\nway to democratic concepts of civil rights.\r\n\r\nIf the integration of the armed services now seems to have been\r\ninevitable in a democratic society, it nevertheless faced opposition\r\nthat had to be overcome and problems that had to be solved through the\r\ncombined efforts of political and civil rights leaders and civil and\r\nmilitary officials. In many ways the military services were at the\r\ncutting edge in the struggle for racial equality. This volume sets\r\nforth the successive measures they and the Office of the Secretary of\r\nDefense took to meet the challenges of a new era in a critically\r\nimportant area of human relationships, during a period of transition\r\nthat saw the advance of blacks in the social and economic order as\r\nwell as in the military. It is fitting that this story should be told\r\nin the first volume of a new Defense Studies Series.\r\n\r\nThe Defense Historical Studies Program was authorized by the then\r\nDeputy Secretary of Defense, Cyrus Vance, in April 1965. It is\r\nconducted under the auspices of the Defense Historical Studies Group,\r\nan _ad hoc_ body chaired by the Historian of the Office of the\r\nSecretary of Defense and consisting of the senior officials in the\r\nhistorical offices of the services and of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\r\nVolumes produced under its sponsorship will be interservice histories,\r\ncovering matters of mutual interest to the Army, Navy, Air Force,\r\nMarine Corps, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The preparation of each\r\nvolume is entrusted to one of the service historical sections, in this\r\ncase the Army's Center of Military History. Although the book was\r\nwritten by an Army historian, he was generously given access to the\r\npertinent records of the other services and the Office of the\r\nSecretary of Defense, and this initial volume in the Defense Studies\r\nSeries covers the experiences of all components of the Department of\r\nDefense in achieving integration.\r\n\r\n  Washington, D.C.                      JAMES L. COLLINS, Jr.\r\n  14 March 1980                         Brigadier General, USA\r\n                                        Chief of Military History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Author\r\n\r\n\r\nMorris J. MacGregor, Jr., received the A.B. and M.A. degrees in\r\nhistory from the Catholic University of America. He continued his\r\ngraduate studies at the Johns Hopkins University and the University of\r\nParis on a Fulbright grant. Before joining the staff of the U.S. Army\r\nCenter of Military History in 1968 he served for ten years in the\r\nHistorical Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He has written\r\nseveral studies for military publications including \"Armed Forces\r\nIntegration--Forced or Free?\" in _The Military and Society:\r\nProceedings of the Fifth Military Symposium of the U.S. Air Force\r\nAcademy_. He is the coeditor with Bernard C. Nalty of the\r\nthirteen-volume _Blacks in the United States Armed Forces: Basic\r\nDocuments_ and with Ronald Spector of _Voices of History:\r\nInterpretations in American Military History_. He is currently working\r\non a sequel to _Integration of the Armed Forces_ which will also\r\nappear in the Defense Studies Series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface                                                             (p. ix)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book describes the fall of the legal, administrative, and social\r\nbarriers to the black American's full participation in the military\r\nservice of his country. It follows the changing status of the black\r\nserviceman from the eve of World War II, when he was excluded from\r\nmany military activities and rigidly segregated in the rest, to that\r\nperiod a quarter of a century later when the Department of Defense\r\nextended its protection of his rights and privileges even to the\r\ncivilian community. To round out the story of open housing for members\r\nof the military, I briefly overstep the closing date given in the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nThe work is essentially an administrative history that attempts to\r\nmeasure the influence of several forces, most notably the civil rights\r\nmovement, the tradition of segregated service, and the changing\r\nconcept of military efficiency, on the development of racial policies\r\nin the armed forces. It is not a history of all minorities in the\r\nservices. Nor is it an account of how the black American responded to\r\ndiscrimination. A study of racial attitudes, both black and white, in\r\nthe military services would be a valuable addition to human knowledge,\r\nbut practically impossible of accomplishment in the absence of\r\nsufficient autobiographical accounts, oral history interviews, and\r\ndetailed sociological measurements. How did the serviceman view his\r\ncondition, how did he convey his desire for redress, and what was his\r\nreaction to social change? Even now the answers to these questions are\r\nblurred by time and distorted by emotions engendered by the civil\r\nrights revolution. Few citizens, black or white, who witnessed it can\r\nclaim immunity to the influence of that paramount social phenomenon of\r\nour times.\r\n\r\nAt times I do generalize on the attitudes of both black and white\r\nservicemen and the black and white communities at large as well. But I\r\nhave permitted myself to do so only when these attitudes were clearly\r\npertinent to changes in the services' racial policies and only when\r\nthe written record supported, or at least did not contradict, the\r\nmemory of those participants who had been interviewed. In any case\r\nthis study is largely history written from the top down and is based\r\nprimarily on the written records left by the administrations of five\r\npresidents and by civil rights leaders, service officials, and the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nMany of the attitudes and expressions voiced by the participants in\r\nthe story are now out of fashion. The reader must be constantly on\r\nguard against viewing the beliefs and statements of many civilian and\r\nmilitary officials out of context of the times in which they were\r\nexpressed. Neither bigotry nor stupidity was the monopoly of some of\r\nthe people quoted; their statements are important for what they tell\r\nus about certain attitudes of our society rather than for what they\r\nreveal about any individual. If the methods or attitudes of some     (p. x)\r\nof the black spokesmen appear excessively tame to those who have\r\nlived through the 1960's, they too should be gauged in the context of\r\nthe times. If their statements and actions shunned what now seems the\r\nmore desirable, albeit radical, course, it should be given them that\r\nthe style they adopted appeared in those days to be the most promising\r\nfor racial progress.\r\n\r\nThe words _black_ and _Negro_ have been used interchangeably in the\r\nbook, with Negro generally as a noun and black as an adjective. Aware\r\nof differing preferences in the black community for usage of these\r\nwords, the author was interested in comments from early readers of the\r\nmanuscript. Some of the participants in the story strongly objected to\r\none word or the other. \"Do me one favor in return for my help,\" Lt.\r\nComdr. Dennis D. Nelson said, \"never call me a black.\" Rear Adm.\r\nGerald E. Thomas, on the other hand, suggested that the use of the\r\nterm Negro might repel readers with much to learn about their recent\r\npast. Still others thought that the historian should respect the usage\r\nof the various periods covered in the story, a solution that would\r\nhave left the volume with the term _colored_ for most of the earlier\r\nchapters and Negro for much of the rest. With rare exception, the term\r\nblack does not appear in twentieth century military records before the\r\nlate 1960's. Fashions in words change, and it is only for the time\r\nbeing perhaps that black and Negro symbolize different attitudes. The\r\nauthor has used the words as synonyms and trusts that the reader will\r\naccept them as such. Professor John Hope Franklin, Mrs. Sara Jackson\r\nof the National Archives, and the historians and officials that\r\nconstituted the review panel went along with this approach.\r\n\r\nThe second question of usage concerns the words _integration_ and\r\n_desegregation_. In recent years many historians have come to\r\ndistinguish between these like-sounding words. Desegregation they see\r\nas a direct action against segregation; that is, it signifies the act\r\nof removing legal barriers to the equal treatment of black citizens as\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution. The movement toward desegregation,\r\nbreaking down the nation's Jim Crow system, became increasingly\r\npopular in the decade after World War II. Integration, on the other\r\nhand, Professor Oscar Handlin maintains, implies several things not\r\nyet necessarily accepted in all areas of American society. In one\r\nsense it refers to the \"leveling of all barriers to association other\r\nthan those based on ability, taste, and personal preference\";[1] in\r\nother words, providing equal opportunity. But in another sense\r\nintegration calls for the random distribution of a minority throughout\r\nsociety. Here, according to Handlin, the emphasis is on racial balance\r\nin areas of occupation, education, residency, and the like.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1: Oscar Handlin, \"The Goals of Integration,\"\r\n                   _Daedalus 95_ (Winter 1966): 270.]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the military establishment rightly understood that\r\nthe breakup of the all-black unit would in a closed society\r\nnecessarily mean more than mere desegregation. It constantly used the\r\nterms integration and equal treatment and opportunity to describe its\r\nracial goals. Rarely, if ever, does one find the word desegregation in\r\nmilitary files that include much correspondence from the various    (p. xi)\r\ncivil rights organizations. That the military made the right choice,\r\nthis study seems to demonstrate, for the racial goals of the Defense\r\nDepartment, as they slowly took form over a quarter of a century,\r\nfulfilled both of Professor Handlin's definitions of integration.\r\n\r\nThe mid-1960's saw the end of a long and important era in the racial\r\nhistory of the armed forces. Although the services continued to\r\nencounter racial problems, these problems differed radically in\r\nseveral essentials from those of the integration period considered in\r\nthis volume. Yet there is a continuity to the story of race relations,\r\nand one can hope that the story of how an earlier generation struggled\r\nso that black men and women might serve their country in freedom\r\ninspires those in the services who continue to fight discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis study benefited greatly from the assistance of a large number of\r\npersons during its long years of preparation. Stetson Conn, chief\r\nhistorian of the Army, proposed the book as an interservice project.\r\nHis successor, Maurice Matloff, forced to deal with the complexities\r\nof an interservice project, successfully guided the manuscript through\r\nto publication. The work was carried out under the general supervision\r\nof Robert R. Smith, chief of the General History Branch. He and Robert\r\nW. Coakley, deputy chief historian of the Army, were the primary\r\nreviewers of the manuscript, and its final form owes much to their\r\nadvice and attention. The author also profited greatly from the advice\r\nof the official review panel, which, under the chairmanship of Alfred\r\nGoldberg, historian, Office of the Secretary of Defense, included\r\nMartin Blumenson; General J. Lawton Collins (USA Ret.); Lt. Gen.\r\nBenjamin O. Davis, Jr. (USAF Ret.); Roy K. Davenport, former Deputy\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Army; Stanley L. Falk, chief historian of\r\nthe Air Force; Vice Adm. E. B. Hooper, Chief of Naval History;\r\nProfessor Benjamin Quarles; Paul J. Scheips, historian, Center of\r\nMilitary History; Henry I. Shaw, chief historian of the U.S. Marine\r\nCorps; Loretto C. Stevens, senior editor of the Center of Military\r\nHistory; Robert J. Watson, chief historian of the Joint Chiefs of\r\nStaff; and Adam Yarmolinsky, former assistant to the Secretary of\r\nDefense.\r\n\r\nMany of the participants in this story generously shared their\r\nknowledge with me and kindly reviewed my efforts. My footnotes\r\nacknowledge my debt to them. Nevertheless, two are singled out here\r\nfor special mention. James C. Evans, former counselor to the Secretary\r\nof Defense for racial affairs, has been an endless source of\r\ninformation on race relations in the military. If I sometimes\r\ndisagreed with his interpretations and assessments, I never doubted\r\nhis total dedication to the cause of the black serviceman. I owe a\r\nsimilar debt to Lt. Comdr. Dennis D. Nelson (USN Ret.) for sharing his\r\nintimate understanding of race relations in the Navy. A resourceful\r\nman with a sure social touch, he must have been one hell of a sailor.\r\n\r\nI want to note the special contribution of several historians. Martin\r\nBlumenson was first assigned to this project, and before leaving the\r\nCenter of Military History he assembled research material that proved\r\nmost helpful. My former colleague John Bernard Corr prepared a study\r\non the National Guard upon which my account of the guard is based.\r\nIn addition, he patiently reviewed many pages of the draft         (p. xii)\r\nmanuscript. His keen insights and sensitive understanding were\r\ninvaluable to me. Professors Jack D. Foner and Marie Carolyn\r\nKlinkhammer provided particularly helpful suggestions in conjunction\r\nwith their reviews of the manuscript. Samuel B. Warner, who before his\r\nuntimely death was a historian in the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as\r\na colleague of Lee Nichols on some of that reporter's civil rights\r\ninvestigations, also contributed generously of his talents and lent\r\nhis support in the early days of my work. Finally, I am grateful for\r\nthe advice of my colleague Ronald H. Spector at several key points in\r\nthe preparation of this history.\r\n\r\nI have received much help from archivists and librarians, especially\r\nthe resourceful William H. Cunliffe and Lois Aldridge (now retired) of\r\nthe National Archives and Dean C. Allard of the Naval Historical\r\nCenter. Although the fruits of their scholarship appear often in my\r\nfootnotes, three fellow researchers in the field deserve special\r\nmention: Maj. Alan M. Osur and Lt. Col. Alan L. Gropman of the U.S.\r\nAir Force and Ralph W. Donnelly, former member of the U.S. Marine\r\nCorps Historical Center. I have benefited from our exchange of ideas\r\nand have had the advantage of their reviews of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nI am especially grateful for the generous assistance of my editors,\r\nLoretto C. Stevens and Barbara H. Gilbert. They have been both friends\r\nand teachers. In the same vein, I wish to thank John Elsberg for his\r\neditorial counsel. I also appreciate the help given by William G. Bell\r\nin the selection of the illustrations, including the loan of two rare\r\nitems from his personal collection, and Arthur S. Hardyman for\r\npreparing the pictures for publication. I would like to thank Mary Lee\r\nTreadway and Wyvetra B. Yeldell for preparing the manuscript for panel\r\nreview and Terrence J. Gough for his helpful pre-publication review.\r\n\r\nFinally, while no friend or relative was spared in the long years I\r\nworked on this book, three colleagues especially bore with me through\r\ndays of doubts and frustrations and shared my small triumphs: Alfred\r\nM. Beck, Ernest F. Fisher, Jr., and Paul J. Scheips. I also want\r\nparticularly to thank Col. James W. Dunn. I only hope that some of\r\ntheir good sense and sunny optimism show through these pages.\r\n\r\n  Washington, D.C.                      MORRIS J.

Nor was this change confined to\r\nmilitary installations. By the time it was over, the armed forces had\r\nredefined their traditional obligation for the welfare of their\r\nmembers to include a promise of equal treatment for black servicemen\r\nwherever they might be. In the name of equality of treatment and\r\nopportunity, the Department of Defense began to challenge racial\r\ninjustices deeply rooted in American society.\r\n\r\nFor all its sweeping implications, equality in the armed forces\r\nobviously had its pragmatic aspects. In one sense it was a practical\r\nanswer to pressing political problems that had plagued several\r\nnational administrations. In another, it was the services' expression\r\nof those liberalizing tendencies that were permeating American society\r\nduring the era of civil rights activism. But to a considerable extent\r\nthe policy of racial equality that evolved in this quarter century was\r\nalso a response to the need for military efficiency. So easy did it\r\nbecome to demonstrate the connection between inefficiency and\r\ndiscrimination that, even when other reasons existed, military\r\nefficiency was the one most often evoked by defense officials to\r\njustify a change in racial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Armed Forces Before 1940_\r\n\r\nProgress toward equal treatment and opportunity in the armed forces\r\nwas an uneven process, the result of sporadic and sometimes\r\nconflicting pressures derived from such constants in American society\r\nas prejudice and idealism and spurred by a chronic shortage of\r\nmilitary manpower. In his pioneering study of race relations, Gunnar\r\nMyrdal observes that ideals have always played a dominant role in the\r\nsocial dynamics of America.[1-1] By extension, the ideals that helped\r\ninvolve the nation in many of its wars also helped produce important\r\nchanges in the treatment of Negroes by the armed forces. The\r\ndemocratic spirit embodied in the Declaration of Independence, for\r\nexample, opened the Continental Army to many Negroes, holding out to\r\nthem the promise of eventual freedom.[1-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-1: Gunnar Myrdal, _The American Dilemma:\r\n                   The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy_, rev. ed.\r\n                   (New York: Harper Row, 1962), p. lxi.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-2: Benjamin Quarles, _The Negro in the\r\n                   American Revolution_ (Chapel Hill: University of\r\n                   North Carolina Press, 1961), pp. 182-85.

Above\r\nall, the participation of both slaves and freedmen in the Continental\r\nArmy and the Navy was a pragmatic response to a pressing need for\r\nfighting men and laborers. Despite the fear of slave insurrection\r\nshared by many colonists, some 5,000 Negroes, the majority from New\r\nEngland, served with the American forces in the Revolution, often in\r\nintegrated units, some as artillerymen and musicians, the majority as\r\ninfantrymen or as unarmed pioneers detailed to repair roads and\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nAgain, General Jackson's need for manpower at New Orleans explains the\r\npresence of the Louisiana Free Men of Color in the last great battle\r\nof the War of 1812. In the Civil War the practical needs of the Union\r\nArmy overcame the Lincoln administration's fear of alienating the\r\nborder states. When the call for volunteers failed to produce the\r\nnecessary men, Negroes were recruited, generally as laborers at first\r\nbut later for combat. In all, 186,000 Negroes served in the Union\r\nArmy. In addition to those in the sixteen segregated combat regiments\r\nand the labor units, thousands also served unofficially as laborers,\r\nteamsters, and cooks. Some 30,000 Negroes served in the Navy, about 25\r\npercent of its total Civil War strength.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the idealism fostered by the abolitionist crusade\r\nshould not be overlooked. It made itself felt during the early months\r\nof the war in the demands of Radical Republicans and some Union\r\ngenerals for black enrollment, and it brought about the postwar\r\nestablishment of black units in the Regular Army. In 1866 Congress\r\nauthorized the creation of permanent, all-black units, which in 1869\r\nwere designated the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th\r\nInfantry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREWMEN OF THE USS MIAMI DURING THE CIVIL WAR]\r\n\r\nMilitary needs and idealistic impulses were not enough to guarantee\r\nuninterrupted racial progress; in fact, the status of black servicemen\r\ntended to reflect the changing patterns in American race relations.\r\nDuring most of the nineteenth century, for example, Negroes served in\r\nan integrated U.S. Navy, in the latter half of the century averaging\r\nbetween 20 and 30 percent of the enlisted strength.[1-3] But the\r\nemployment of Negroes in the Navy was abruptly curtailed after\r\n1900. Paralleling the rise of Jim Crow and legalized segregation   (p. 005)\r\nin much of America was the cutback in the number of black sailors, who\r\nby 1909 were mostly in the galley and the engine room. In contrast to\r\ntheir high percentage of the ranks in the Civil War and Spanish-American\r\nWar, only 6,750 black sailors, including twenty-four women reservists\r\n(yeomanettes), served in World War I; they constituted 1.2 percent of\r\nthe Navy's total enlistment.[1-4] Their service was limited chiefly to\r\nmess duty and coal passing, the latter becoming increasingly rare as\r\nthe fleet changed from coal to oil.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-3: Estimates vary; exact racial\r\n                   statistics concerning the nineteenth century Navy\r\n                   are difficult to locate.

(_Frederick Remington's 1888\r\nsketch._)]\r\n\r\nWhen postwar enlistment was resumed in 1923, the Navy recruited\r\nFilipino stewards instead of Negroes, although a decade later it\r\nreopened the branch to black enlistment. Negroes quickly took\r\nadvantage of this limited opportunity, their numbers rising from 441\r\nin 1932 to 4,007 in June 1940, when they constituted 2.3 percent of\r\nthe Navy's 170,000 total.[1-5] Curiously enough, because black     (p. 006)\r\nreenlistment in combat or technical specialties had never been barred,\r\na few black gunner's mates, torpedomen, machinist mates, and the like\r\ncontinued to serve in the 1930's.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-5: Memo, H.

The\r\nlaws of 1866 and 1869 that guaranteed the existence of four black\r\nRegular Army regiments also institutionalized segregation, granting\r\nfederal recognition to a system racially separate and theoretically\r\nequal in treatment and opportunity a generation before the Supreme\r\nCourt sanctioned such a distinction in _Plessy_ v. _Ferguson_.[1-6] So\r\nimportant to many in the black community was this guaranteed existence\r\nof the four regiments that had served with distinction against the\r\nfrontier Indians that few complained about segregation. In fact, as\r\nhistorian Jack Foner has pointed out, black leaders sometimes\r\ninterpreted demands for integration as attempts to eliminate black\r\nsoldiers altogether.[1-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-6: 163 U.S. 537 (1896). In this 1896 case\r\n                   concerning segregated seating on a Louisiana\r\n                   railroad, the Supreme Court ruled that so long as\r\n                   equality of accommodation existed, segregation\r\n                   could not in itself be considered discriminatory\r\n                   and therefore did not violate the equal rights\r\n                   provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. This\r\n                   \"separate but equal\" doctrine would prevail in\r\n                   American law for more than half a century.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-7: Foner, _Blacks and the Military in\r\n                   American History_, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish-American War marked a break with the post-Civil War\r\ntradition of limited recruitment. Besides the 3,339 black regulars,\r\napproximately 10,000 black volunteers served in the Army during    (p. 007)\r\nthe conflict. World War I was another exception, for Negroes made up\r\nnearly 11 percent of the Army's total strength, some 404,000 officers\r\nand men.[1-8] The acceptance of Negroes during wartime stemmed from\r\nthe Army's pressing need for additional manpower. Yet it was no means\r\ncertain in the early months of World War I that this need for men\r\nwould prevail over the reluctance of many leaders to arm large groups\r\nof Negroes. Still remembered were the 1906 Brownsville affair, in\r\nwhich men of the 25th Infantry had fired on Texan civilians, and the\r\nAugust 1917 riot involving members of the 24th Infantry at Houston,\r\nTexas.[1-9] Ironically, those idealistic impulses that had operated in\r\nearlier wars were operating again in this most Jim Crow of\r\nadministrations.[1-10] Woodrow Wilson's promise to make the world safe\r\nfor democracy was forcing his administration to admit Negroes to the\r\nArmy. Although it carefully maintained racially separate draft calls,\r\nthe National Army conscripted some 368,000 Negroes, 13.08 percent of\r\nall those drafted in World War I.[1-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-8: Ulysses Lee, _The Employment of Negro\r\n                   Troops_, United States Army in World War II\r\n                   (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1966), p.\r\n                   5.

Once again\r\nNegroes were called on to perform a number of vital though unskilled\r\njobs, such as construction work, most notably in sixteen specially\r\nformed pioneer infantry regiments. But they also served as frontline\r\ncombat troops in the all-black 92d and 93d Infantry Divisions, the\r\nlatter serving with distinction among the French forces.\r\n\r\nEstablished by law and tradition and reinforced by the Army staff's\r\nconviction that black troops had not performed well in combat,\r\nsegregation survived to flourish in the postwar era.[1-12] The familiar\r\npractice of maintaining a few black units was resumed in the Regular\r\nArmy, with the added restriction that Negroes were totally excluded\r\nfrom the Air Corps. The postwar manpower retrenchments common to all\r\nRegular Army units further reduced the size of the remaining black\r\nunits. By June 1940 the number of Negroes on active duty stood at\r\napproximately 4,000 men, 1.5 percent of the Army's total, about the\r\nsame proportion as Negroes in the Navy.[1-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-12: The development of post-World War I\r\n                   policy is discussed in considerable detail in Lee,\r\n                   _Employment of Negro Troops_, Chapters I and II.\r\n                   See also U.S. Army War College Miscellaneous File\r\n                   127-1 through 127-23 and 127-27, U.S. Army Military\r\n                   History Research Collection, Carlisle Barracks\r\n                   (hereafter AMHRC).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-13: The 1940 strength figure is\r\n                   extrapolated from Misc Div, AGO, Returns Sec, 9 Oct\r\n                   39-30 Nov 41.

Skilled journalists in the black press and\r\ncounselors and lobbyists presenting such groups as the National\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the\r\nNational Urban League, and the National Negro Congress took the lead\r\nin the fight for racial justice in the United States. They represented\r\na black community that for the most part lacked the cohesion,\r\npolitical awareness, and economic strength which would characterize it\r\nin the decades to come. Nevertheless, Negroes had already become a\r\nrecognizable political force in some parts of the country.

In large areas of\r\nthe country where lynchings and beatings were commonplace, white\r\nsupremacy had existed as a literal fact of life and death.[1-15] More\r\ninsidious than the Jim Crow laws were the economic deprivation and\r\ndearth of educational opportunity associated with racial\r\ndiscrimination. Traditionally the last hired, first fired, Negroes\r\nsuffered all the handicaps that came from unemployment and poor jobs,\r\na condition further aggravated by the Great Depression. The \"separate\r\nbut equal\" educational system dictated by law and the realities of\r\nblack life in both urban and rural areas, north and south, had proved\r\nanything but equal and thus closed to Negroes a traditional avenue to\r\nadvancement in American society.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-15: The Jim Crow era is especially well\r\n                   described in Rayford W.

Encouraged by these\r\nprograms and heartened by Eleanor Roosevelt's public support of civil\r\nrights, black voters defected from their traditional allegiance to the\r\nRepublican Party in overwhelming numbers. But the civil rights leaders\r\nwere already aware, if the average black citizen was not, that despite\r\nhaving made some considerable improvements Franklin Roosevelt never,\r\nin one biographer's words, \"sufficiently challenged Southern       (p. 009)\r\ntraditions of white supremacy to create problems for himself.\"[1-16]\r\nNegroes, in short, might benefit materially from the New Deal, but\r\nthey would have to look elsewhere for advancement of their civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-16: Frank Freidel, _F.D.R. and the South_\r\n                   (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press,\r\n                   1965), pp. 71-102.

White of the NAACP and the National Urban League's\r\nT. Arnold Hill sought to use World War II to expand opportunities for\r\nthe black American. From the start they tried to translate the\r\nidealistic sentiment for democracy stimulated by the war and expressed\r\nin the Atlantic Charter into widespread support for civil rights in\r\nthe United States. At the same time, in sharp contrast to many of\r\ntheir World War I predecessors, they placed a price on black support\r\nfor the war effort: no longer could the White House expect this\r\nsizable minority to submit to injustice and yet close ranks with other\r\nAmericans to defeat a common enemy. It was readily apparent to the\r\nNegro, if not to his white supporter or his enemy, that winning\r\nequality at home was just as important as advancing the cause of\r\nfreedom abroad. As George S. Schuyler, a widely quoted black\r\ncolumnist, put it: \"If nothing more comes out of this emergency than\r\nthe widespread understanding among white leaders that the Negro's\r\nloyalty is conditional, we shall not have suffered in vain.\"[1-17] The\r\nNAACP spelled out the challenge even more clearly in its monthly\r\npublication, _The Crisis_, which declared itself \"sorry for brutality,\r\nblood, and death among the peoples of Europe, just as we were sorry\r\nfor China and Ethiopia.

Nor was the Double V campaign limited to a small group of\r\ncivil rights spokesmen; rather, it reflected a new mood that, as\r\nMyrdal pointed out, was permeating all classes of black society.[1-19]\r\nThe quickening of the black masses in the cause of equal treatment and\r\nopportunity in the pre-World War II period and the willingness of\r\nNegroes to adopt a more militant course to achieve this end might well\r\nmark the beginning of the modern civil rights movement.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-19: Myrdal, _American Dilemma_, p. 744.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTEGRATION IN THE ARMY OF 1888. _The Army Band at Fort\r\nDuchesne, Utah, composed of soldiers from the black 9th Cavalry and\r\nthe white 21st Infantry._]\r\n\r\nHistorian Lee Finkle has suggested that the militancy advocated by\r\nmost of the civil rights leaders in the World War II era was merely a\r\nrhetorical device; that for the most part they sought to avoid\r\nviolence over segregation, concentrating as before on traditional\r\nmethods of protest.[1-20] This reliance on traditional methods was\r\napparent when the leaders tried to focus the new sentiment among\r\nNegroes on two war-related goals: equality of treatment in the armed\r\nforces and equality of job opportunity in the expanding defense\r\nindustries. In 1938 the Pittsburgh _Courier_, the largest and one  (p. 010)\r\nof the most influential of the nation's black papers, called upon the\r\nPresident to open the services to Negroes and organized the Committee\r\nfor Negro Participation in the National Defense Program. These moves\r\nled to an extensive lobbying effort that in time spread to many other\r\nnewspapers and local civil rights groups. The black press and its\r\nsatellites also attracted the support of several national\r\norganizations that were promoting preparedness for war, and these\r\ngroups, in turn, began to demand equal treatment and opportunity in\r\nthe armed forces.[1-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-20: Lee Finkle, \"The Conservative Aims of\r\n                   Militant Rhetoric: Black Protest During World War\r\n                   II,\" _Journal of American History_ 60 (December\r\n                   1973):693.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-21: Some impression of the extent of this\r\n                   campaign and its effect on the War Department can\r\n                   be gained from the volume of correspondence\r\n                   produced by the Pittsburgh _Courier_ campaign and\r\n                   filed in AG 322.99 (2-23-38)(1).]\r\n\r\nThe government began to respond to these pressures before the United\r\nStates entered World War II. At the urging of the White House the Army\r\nannounced plans for the mobilization of Negroes, and Congress amended\r\nseveral mobilization measures to define and increase the military\r\ntraining opportunities for Negroes.[1-22] The most important of these\r\nlegislative amendments in terms of influence on future race relations\r\nin the United States were made to the Selective Service Act of 1940.\r\nThe matter of race played only a small part in the debate on this\r\nhighly controversial legislation, but during congressional hearings on\r\nthe bill black spokesmen testified on discrimination against Negroes\r\nin the services.[1-23] These witnesses concluded that if the draft law\r\ndid not provide specific guarantees against it, discrimination would\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-22: The Army's plans and amendments are\r\n                   treated in great detail in Lee, _Employment of\r\n                   Negro Troops_.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-23: Hearings Before the Committee on\r\n                   Military Affairs.

During      (p. 011)\r\nfloor debate on the Selective Service Act, Senator Robert F. Wagner of\r\nNew York proposed an amendment to guarantee to Negroes and other\r\nracial minorities the privilege of voluntary enlistment in the armed\r\nforces. He sought in this fashion to correct evils described some ten\r\ndays earlier by Rayford W. Logan, chairman of the Committee for Negro\r\nParticipation in the National Defense, in testimony before the House\r\nCommittee on Military Affairs. The Wagner proposal triggered critical\r\ncomments and questions. Senators John H. Overton and Allen J. Ellender\r\nof Louisiana viewed the Wagner amendment as a step toward \"mixed\"\r\nunits. Overton, Ellender, and Senator Lister Hill of Alabama proposed\r\nthat the matter should be \"left to the Army.\" Hill also attacked the\r\namendment because it would allow the enlistment of Japanese-Americans,\r\nsome of whom he claimed were not loyal to the United States.[1-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-24: _Congressional Record_, 76th Cong.,\r\n                   3d sess., vol. 86, p. 10890.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PERSHING, AEF COMMANDER, INSPECTS TROOPS _of\r\nthe 802d (Colored) Pioneer Regiment in France, 1918_.]\r\n\r\nNo filibuster was attempted, and the Wagner amendment passed the\r\nSenate easily, 53 to 21. It provided\r\n\r\n     that any person between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five\r\n     regardless of race or color shall be afforded an opportunity\r\n     voluntarily to enlist and be inducted into the land and naval\r\n     forces (including aviation units) of the United States for the\r\n     training and service prescribed in subsection (b), if he is\r\n     acceptable to the land or naval forces for such training and\r\n     service.[1-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-25: 54 _U.S. Stat._ 885(1940).]\r\n\r\nThe Wagner amendment was aimed at _volunteers_ for military service.\r\nCongressman Hamilton Fish, also of New York, later introduced a\r\nsimilar measure in the House aimed at _draftees_. The Fish         (p. 012)\r\namendment passed the House by a margin of 121 to 99 and emerged intact\r\nfrom the House-Senate conference. The law finally read that in the\r\nselection and training of men and execution of the law \"there shall be\r\nno discrimination against any person on account of race or color.\"[1-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-26: Ibid.

As long as official policy permitted separate draft\r\ncalls for blacks and whites and the officially held definition of\r\ndiscrimination neatly excluded segregation--and both went unchallenged\r\nin the courts--segregation would remain entrenched in the armed\r\nforces. Indeed, the rigidly segregated services, their ranks swollen\r\nby the draft, were a particular frustration to the civil rights forces\r\nbecause they were introducing some black citizens to racial\r\ndiscrimination more pervasive than any they had ever endured in\r\ncivilian life. Moreover, as the services continued to open bases\r\nthroughout the country, they actually spread federally sponsored\r\nsegregation into areas where it had never before existed with the\r\nforce of law. In the long run, however, the 1940 draft law and\r\nsubsequent draft legislation had a strong influence on the armed\r\nforces' racial policies. They created a climate in which progress\r\ncould be made toward integration within the services. Although not\r\napparent in 1940, the pressure of a draft-induced flood of black   (p. 013)\r\nconscripts was to be a principal factor in the separate decisions of\r\nthe Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to integrate their units.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Segregate Is To Discriminate_\r\n\r\nAs with all the administration's prewar efforts to increase\r\nopportunities for Negroes in the armed forces, the Selective Service\r\nAct failed to excite black enthusiasm because it missed the point of\r\nblack demands. Guarantees of black participation were no longer\r\nenough. By 1940 most responsible black leaders shared the goal of an\r\nintegrated armed forces as a step toward full participation in the\r\nbenefits and responsibilities of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe White House may well have thought that Walter White of the NAACP\r\nsinglehandedly organized the demand for integration in 1939, but he\r\nwas merely applying a concept of race relations that had been evolving\r\nsince World War I. In the face of ever-worsening discrimination,\r\nWhite's generation of civil rights advocates had rejected the idea of\r\nthe preeminent black leader Booker T. Washington that hope for the\r\nfuture lay in the development of a separate and strong black       (p. 014)\r\ncommunity. Instead, they gradually came to accept the argument of one\r\nof the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of\r\nColored People, William E. B. DuBois, that progress was possible only\r\nwhen Negroes abandoned their segregated community to work toward a\r\nsociety open to both black and white. By the end of the 1930's this\r\nconcept had produced a fundamental change in civil rights tactics and\r\ncreated the new mood of assertiveness that Myrdal found in the black\r\ncommunity. The work of White and others marked the beginning of a\r\nsystematic attack against Jim Crow. As the most obvious practitioner\r\nof Jim Crow in the federal government, the services were the logical\r\ntarget for the first battle in a conflict that would last some thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThis evolution in black attitudes was clearly demonstrated in\r\ncorrespondence in the 1930's between officials of the NAACP and the\r\nRoosevelt administration over equal treatment in the armed forces. The\r\ndiscussion began in 1934 with a series of exchanges between Chief of\r\nStaff Douglas MacArthur and NAACP Counsel Charles H. Houston and\r\ncontinued through the correspondence between White and the\r\nadministration in 1937. The NAACP representatives rejected MacArthur's\r\ndefense of Army policy and held out for a quota guaranteeing that\r\nNegroes would form at least 10 percent of the nation's military\r\nstrength. Their emphasis throughout was on numbers; during these first\r\nexchanges, at least, they fought against disbandment of the existing\r\nblack regiments and argued for similar units throughout the\r\nservice.[1-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-27: See especially Ltr, Houston to CofS,\r\n                   1 Aug and 29 Aug 34; Ltr, CofS to Houston, 20 Aug\r\n                   34; Ltr, Maj Gen Edgar T.

To this end, the NAACP urged\r\nRoosevelt to appoint a commission of black and white citizens to\r\ninvestigate discrimination in the Army and Navy and to recommend the\r\nremoval of racial barriers.[1-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-28: Ibid.

Watson, referred White to a War\r\nDepartment report outlining the new black units being created under\r\npresidential authorization. But the NAACP leaders were not to be\r\ndiverted from the main chance. Thurgood Marshall, then the head of (p. 015)\r\nthe organization's legal department, recommended that White tell the\r\nPresident \"that the NAACP is opposed to the separate units existing in\r\nthe armed forces at the present time.\"[1-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-32: Memo, Marshall for White, 28 Oct 39;\r\n                   Ltr, Secy to the President to White, 17 Oct 39.\r\n                   Both in C-376, NAACP Collection, LC.]\r\n\r\nWhen his associates failed to agree on a reply to the administration,\r\nWhite decided on a face-to-face meeting with the President.[1-33]\r\nRoosevelt agreed to confer with White, Hill of the Urban League, and\r\nA. Philip Randolph, head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,\r\nthe session finally taking place on 27 September 1940. At that time\r\nthe civil rights officials outlined for the President and his defense\r\nassistants what they called the \"important phases of the integration\r\nof the Negro into military aspects of the national defense program.\"\r\nCentral to their argument was the view that the Army and Navy should\r\naccept men without regard to race. According to White, the President\r\nhad apparently never considered the use of integrated units, but after\r\nsome discussion he seemed to accept the suggestion that the Army could\r\nassign black regiments or batteries alongside white units and from\r\nthere \"the Army could 'back into' the formation of units without\r\nsegregation.\"[1-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-33: Memo, White for Roy Wilkins et al.,\r\n                   Oct 39; Ltr, Houston to White, Oct 39; Memo,\r\n                   Wilkins to White, 23 Oct 39.

Although the policy announced by\r\nthe White House subsequent to the meeting contained concessions\r\nregarding the employment and distribution of Negroes in the services,\r\nit did not provide for integrated units. The wording of the press\r\nrelease on the conference implied, moreover, that the administration's\r\nentire program had been approved by White and the others. To have\r\ntheir names associated with any endorsement of segregation was\r\nparticularly infuriating to these civil rights leaders, who\r\nimmediately protested to the President.[1-35] The White House later\r\npublicly absolved the leaders of any such endorsement, and Press\r\nSecretary Early was forced to retract the \"damaging impression\" that\r\nthe leaders had in any way endorsed segregation. The President later\r\nassured White, Randolph, and Hill that further policy changes would be\r\nmade to insure fair treatment for Negroes.[1-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-35: Ltr, White to Stephen Early, 21 Oct\r\n                   40.

The organization encountered\r\nopposition at first when some black leaders were willing to accept\r\nsegregated units as the price for obtaining the formation of more\r\nall-black divisions. The NAACP stood firm, however, and demanded at\r\nits annual convention in 1941 an immediate end to segregation.\r\n\r\nIn a related move symbolizing the growing unity behind the campaign to\r\nintegrate the military, the leaders of the March on Washington\r\nMovement, a group of black activists under A. Philip Randolph,     (p. 016)\r\nspecifically demanded the end of segregation in the Army and Navy. The\r\nmovement was the first since the days of Marcus Garvey to involve the\r\nblack masses; in fact Negroes from every social and economic class\r\nrallied behind Randolph, ready to demonstrate for equal treatment and\r\nopportunity. Although some black papers objected to the movement's\r\nmilitancy, the major civil rights organization showed no such hesitancy.\r\nRoy Wilkins, a leader of the NAACP, later claimed that Randolph could\r\nsupply only about 9,000 potential demonstrators and that the NAACP had\r\nprovided the bulk of the movement's participants.[1-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-37: Roy Wilkins Oral History Interview,\r\n                   Columbia University Oral History Collection.

Reflecting the degree of NAACP support,\r\nmarch organizers included a discussion of segregation in the services\r\nwhen they talked with President Roosevelt in June 1941. Randolph and\r\nthe others proposed ways to abolish the separate racial units in each\r\nservice, charging that integration was being frustrated by prejudiced\r\nsenior military officials.[1-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-38: White, _A Man Called White_, pp.\r\n                   190-93.]\r\n\r\nThe President's meeting with the march leaders won the administration\r\na reprieve from the threat of a mass civil rights demonstration in the\r\nnation's capital, but at the price of promising substantial reform in\r\nminority hiring for defense industries and the creation of a federal\r\nbody, the Fair Employment Practices Committee, to coordinate the\r\nreform. While it prompted no similar reform in the racial policies of\r\nthe armed forces, the March on Washington Movement was nevertheless a\r\nsignificant milestone in the services' racial history.[1-39] It signaled\r\nthe beginning of a popularly based campaign against segregation in the\r\narmed forces in which all the major civil rights organizations, their\r\nallies in Congress and the press, and many in the black community\r\nwould hammer away on a single theme: segregation is unacceptable in a\r\ndemocratic society and hypocritical during a war fought in defense of\r\nthe four freedoms.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 1-39: Herbert Garfinkle, _When Negroes\r\n                   March: The March on Washington Movement in the\r\n                   Organizational Politics of FEPC_ (Glencoe: The Free\r\n                   Press, 1959), provides a comprehensive account of\r\n                   the aims and achievements of the movement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2                                                          (p. 017)\r\n\r\nWorld War II: The Army\r\n\r\n\r\nCivil rights leaders adopted the \"Double V\" slogan as their rallying\r\ncry during World War II. Demanding victory against fascism abroad and\r\ndiscrimination at home, they exhorted black citizens to support the\r\nwar effort and to fight for equal treatment and opportunity for\r\nNegroes everywhere. Although segregation was their main target, their\r\ncampaign was directed against all forms of discrimination, especially\r\nin the armed forces. They flooded the services with appeals for a\r\nredress of black grievances and levied similar demands on the White\r\nHouse, Congress, and the courts.\r\n\r\nBlack leaders concentrated on the services because they were public\r\ninstitutions, their officials sworn to uphold the Constitution. The\r\nleaders understood, too, that disciplinary powers peculiar to the\r\nservices enabled them to make changes that might not be possible for\r\nother organizations; the armed forces could command where others could\r\nonly persuade. The Army bore the brunt of this attention, but not\r\nbecause its policies were so benighted. In 1941 the Army was a fairly\r\nprogressive organization, and few institutions in America could match\r\nits record. Rather, the civil rights leaders concentrated on the Army\r\nbecause the draft law had made it the nation's largest employer of\r\nminority groups.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the Army resisted the demands, its spokesmen contending\r\nthat the service's enormous size and power should not be used for\r\nsocial experiment, especially during a war. Further justifying their\r\nposition, Army officials pointed out that their service had to avoid\r\nconflict with prevailing social attitudes, particularly when such\r\nattitudes were jealously guarded by Congress. In this period of\r\ncontinuous demand and response, the Army developed a racial policy\r\nthat remained in effect throughout the war with only superficial\r\nmodifications sporadically adopted to meet changing conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A War Policy: Reaffirming Segregation_\r\n\r\nThe experience of World War I cast a shadow over the formation of the\r\nArmy's racial policy in World War II.[2-1] The chief architects of the\r\nnew policy, and many of its opponents, were veterans of the first war\r\nand reflected in their judgments the passions and prejudices of that\r\nera.[2-2] Civil rights activists were determined to eliminate the  (p. 018)\r\nsegregationist practices of the 1917 mobilization and to win a\r\nfair representation for Negroes in the Army. The traditionalists of\r\nthe Army staff, on the other hand, were determined to resist any\r\nradical change in policy. Basing their arguments on their evaluation\r\nof the performance of the 92d Division and some other black units in\r\nWorld War I, they had made, but not publicized, mobilization plans\r\nthat recognized the Army's obligation to employ black soldiers yet\r\nrigidly maintained the segregationist policy of World War I.[2-3] These\r\nplans increased the number of types of black units to be formed and\r\neven provided for a wide distribution of the units among all the arms\r\nand services except the Army Air Forces and Signal Corps, but they did\r\nnot explain how the skilled Negro, whose numbers had greatly increased\r\nsince World War I, could be efficiently used within the limitations of\r\nblack units. In the name of military efficiency the Army staff had, in\r\neffect, devised a social rather than a military policy for the\r\nemployment of black troops.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-1: This survey of the Army and the Negro\r\n                   in World War II is based principally on Lee's\r\n                   _Employment of Negro Troops_.

Eager to placate and\r\nwilling to compromise, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought an\r\naccommodation by directing the War Department to provide jobs for\r\nNegroes in all parts of the Army. The controversy over integration\r\nsoon became more public, the opponents less reconcilable; in the weeks\r\nfollowing the President's meeting with black representatives on 27\r\nSeptember 1940 the Army countered black demands for integration with a\r\nstatement released by the White House on 9 October. To provide \"a fair\r\nand equitable basis\" for the use of Negroes in its expansion program,\r\nthe Army planned to accept Negroes in numbers approximate to their\r\nproportion in the national population, about 10 percent. Black\r\nofficers and enlisted men were to serve, as was then customary, only\r\nin black units that were to be formed in each major branch, both\r\ncombatant and noncombatant, including air units to be created as soon\r\nas pilots, mechanics, and technical specialists were trained. There\r\nwould be no racial intermingling in regimental organizations because\r\nthe practice of separating white and black troops had, the Army staff\r\nsaid, proved satisfactory over a long period of time. To change would\r\ndestroy morale and impair preparations for national defense. Since\r\nblack units in the Army were already \"going concerns, accustomed\r\nthrough many years to the present system\" of segregation, \"no\r\nexperiments should be tried ... at this critical time.\"[2-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-4: Memo, TAG for CG's et al., 16 Oct 40,\r\n                   sub: War Department Policy in Regard to Negroes, AG\r\n                   291.21 (10-9-40) M-A-M.]\r\n\r\nThe President's \"OK, F.D.R.\" on the War Department statement       (p. 019)\r\ntransformed what had been a routine prewar mobilization plan into a\r\nracial policy that would remain in effect throughout the war. In fact,\r\nquickly elevated in importance by War Department spokesmen who made\r\nconstant reference to the \"Presidential Directive,\" the statement\r\nwould be used by some Army officials as a presidential sanction for\r\nintroducing segregation in new situations, as, for example, in the\r\npilot training of black officers in the Army Air Corps. Just as\r\nquickly, the civil rights leaders, who had expected more from the tone\r\nof the President's own comments and more also from the egalitarian\r\nimplications of the new draft law, bitterly attacked the Army's\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nBlack criticism came at an awkward moment for President Roosevelt, who\r\nwas entering a heated campaign for an unprecedented third term and\r\nwhose New Deal coalition included the urban black vote. His opponent,\r\nthe articulate Wendell L. Willkie, was an unabashed champion of civil\r\nrights and was reportedly attracting a wide following among black\r\nvoters. In the weeks preceding the election the President tried to\r\nsoften the effect of the Army's announcement. He promoted Col.\r\nBenjamin O. Davis, Sr., to brigadier general, thereby making Davis the\r\nfirst Negro to hold this rank in the Regular Army. He appointed the\r\ncommander of reserve officers' training at Howard University, Col.\r\nCampbell C. Johnson, Special Aide to the Director of Selective\r\nService. And, finally, he named Judge William H. Hastie, dean of the\r\nHoward University Law School, Civilian Aide to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nA successful lawyer, Judge Hastie entered upon his new assignment with\r\nseveral handicaps. Because of his long association with black causes,\r\nsome civil rights organizations assumed that Hastie would be their man\r\nin Washington and regarded his duties as an extension of their crusade\r\nagainst discrimination. Hastie's War Department superiors, on the\r\nother hand, assumed that his was a public relations job and expected\r\nhim to handle all complaints and mobilization problems as had his\r\nWorld War I predecessor, Emmett J. Scott. Both assumptions proved\r\nfalse. Hastie was evidently determined to break the racial logjam in\r\nthe War Department, yet unlike many civil rights advocates he seemed\r\nwilling to pay the price of slow progress to obtain lasting\r\nimprovement. According to those who knew him, Hastie was confident\r\nthat he could demonstrate to War Department officials that the Army's\r\nracial policies were both inefficient and unpatriotic.[2-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-5: The foregoing impressions are derived\r\n                   largely from Interviews, Lee Nichols with James C.\r\n                   Evans, who worked for Judge Hastie during World War\r\n                   II, and Ulysses G. Lee (c. 1953). Both in Nichols\r\n                   Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\nJudge Hastie spent his first ten months in office observing what was\r\nhappening to the Negro in the Army. He did not like what he saw. To\r\nhim, separating black soldiers from white soldiers was a fundamental\r\nerror. First, the effect on black morale was devastating. \"Beneath the\r\nsurface,\" he wrote, \"is widespread discontent. Most white persons are\r\nunable to appreciate the rancor and bitterness which the Negro, as a\r\nmatter of self-preservation, has learned to hide beneath a smile, a\r\njoke, or merely an impassive face.\" The inherent paradox of trying to\r\ninculcate pride, dignity, and aggressiveness in a black soldier while\r\ninflicting on him the segregationist's concept of the Negro's      (p. 020)\r\nplace in society created in him an insupportable tension. Second,\r\nsegregation wasted black manpower, a valuable military asset. It was\r\nimpossible, Hastie charged, to employ skilled Negroes at maximum\r\nefficiency within the traditionally narrow limitations of black units.\r\nThird, to insist on an inflexible separation of white and black\r\nsoldiers was \"the most dramatic evidence of hypocrisy\" in America's\r\nprofessed concern for preserving democracy.\r\n\r\nAlthough he appreciated the impossibility of making drastic changes\r\novernight, Judge Hastie was disturbed because he found \"no apparent\r\ndisposition to make a beginning or a trial of any different plan.\" He\r\nlooked for some form of progressive integration by which qualified\r\nNegroes could be classified and assigned, not by race, but as\r\nindividuals, according to their capacities and abilities.[2-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-6: Memo, William H. Hastie for SW, with\r\n                   attachment, 22 Sep 41, sub: Survey and\r\n                   Recommendations Concerning the Integration of the\r\n                   Negro Soldiers Into the Army, G-1/15640-120. See\r\n                   also Intervs, Nichols with Evans and Lee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUDGE HASTIE.]\r\n\r\nJudge Hastie gained little support from the Secretary of War, Henry L.\r\nStimson, or the Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, when he\r\ncalled for progressive integration. Both considered the Army's\r\nsegregated units to be in accord with prevailing public sentiment\r\nagainst mixing the races in the intimate association of military life.\r\nMore to the point, both Stimson and Marshall were sensitive to\r\nmilitary tradition, and segregated units had been a part of the Army\r\nsince 1863. Stimson embraced segregation readily. While conveying to\r\nthe President that he was \"sensitive to the individual tragedy which\r\nwent with it to the colored man himself,\" he nevertheless urged\r\nRoosevelt not to place \"too much responsibility on a race which was\r\nnot showing initiative in battle.\"[2-7] Stimson's attitude was not\r\nunusual for the times. He professed to believe in civil rights for\r\nevery citizen, but he opposed social integration. He never tried to\r\nreconcile these seemingly inconsistent views; in fact, he probably did\r\nnot consider them inconsistent. Stimson blamed what he termed Eleanor\r\nRoosevelt's \"intrusive and impulsive folly\" for some of the criticism\r\nvisited upon the Army's racial policy, just as he inveighed against\r\nthe \"foolish leaders of the colored race\" who were seeking \"at     (p. 021)\r\nbottom social equality,\" which, he concluded, was out of the question\r\n\"because of the impossibility of race mixture by marriage.\"[2-8]\r\nInfluenced by Under Secretary Robert P. Patterson, Assistant Secretary\r\nJohn J. McCloy, and Truman K. Gibson, Jr., who was Judge Hastie's\r\nsuccessor, but most of all impressed by the performance of black\r\nsoldiers themselves, Stimson belatedly modified his defense of\r\nsegregation. But throughout the war he adhered to the traditional\r\narguments of the Army's professional staff.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-7: Stimson, a Republican, had been\r\n                   appointed by Roosevelt in 1940, along with\r\n                   Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, in an effort to\r\n                   enlist bipartisan support for the administration's\r\n                   foreign policy in an election year. Stimson brought\r\n                   a wealth of experience with him to the office,\r\n                   having served as Secretary of War under William\r\n                   Howard Taft and Secretary of State under Herbert\r\n                   Hoover.

He lived up to the letter of the Army's regulations,\r\nconsistently supporting measures to eliminate overt discrimination in\r\nthe wartime Army. At the same time, he rejected the idea that the Army\r\nshould take the lead in altering the racial mores of the nation. Asked\r\nfor his views on Hastie's \"carefully prepared memo,\"[2-9] General\r\nMarshall admitted that many of the recommendations were sound but said\r\nthat Judge Hastie's proposals\r\n\r\n     would be tantamount to solving a social problem which has\r\n     perplexed the American people throughout the history of this\r\n     nation. The Army cannot accomplish such a solution and        (p. 022)\r\n     should not be charged with the undertaking. The settlement of\r\n     vexing racial problems cannot be permitted to complicate the\r\n     tremendous task of the War Department and thereby jeopardize\r\n     discipline and morale.[2-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-9: Memo, USW for CofS, 6 Oct 41,\r\n                   G-1/15640-120.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-10: Memo, CofS for SW, 1 Dec 41, sub:\r\n                   Report of Judge William H.

Since for several\r\npractical reasons the bulk of that Army would be trained in the south\r\nwhere its conscripts would be subject to southern laws, Marshall saw\r\nno alternative but to postpone reform. The War Department, he said,\r\ncould not ignore the social relationship between blacks and whites,\r\nestablished by custom and habit. Nor could it ignore the fact that the\r\n\"level of intelligence and occupational skill\" of the black population\r\nwas considerably below that of whites. Though he agreed that the Army\r\nwould reach maximum strength only if individuals were placed according\r\nto their abilities, he concluded that experiments to solve social\r\nproblems would be \"fraught with danger to efficiency, discipline, and\r\nmorale.\" In sum, Marshall saw no reason to change the policy approved\r\nby the President less than a year before.[2-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-11: Ibid. See also Forrest C. Pogue,\r\n                   _George C. Marshall: Organizer of Victory_ (New\r\n                   York: The Viking Press, 1973), pp. 96-99.]\r\n\r\nThe Army's leaders and the secretary's civilian aide had reached an\r\nimpasse on the question of policy even before the country entered the\r\nwar. And though the use of black troops in World War I was not\r\nentirely satisfactory even to its defenders,[2-12] there appeared to be\r\nno time now, in view of the larger urgency of winning the war, to plan\r\nother approaches, try other solutions, or tamper with an institution\r\nthat had won victory in the past. Further ordering the thoughts of\r\nsome senior Army officials was their conviction that wide-scale mixing\r\nof the races in the services might, as Under Secretary Patterson\r\nphrased it, foment social revolution.[2-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-12: The Army staff's mobilization\r\n                   planning for black units in the 1930's generally\r\n                   relied upon the detailed testimony of the\r\n                   commanders of black units in World War I. This\r\n                   testimony, contained in documents submitted to the\r\n                   War Department and the Army War College, was often\r\n                   critical of the Army's employment of black troops,\r\n                   although rarely critical of segregation.

Although General Marshall\r\nadmitted that he was not satisfied with the department's progress in\r\nracial matters and promised further changes, the conference concluded\r\nwith a speech by a representative of The Adjutant General who\r\ndelivered what many considered the final word on integration during\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n     The Army is made up of individual citizens of the United States\r\n     who have pronounced views with respect to the Negro just as they\r\n     have individual ideas with respect to other matters in their\r\n     daily walk of life. Military orders, fiat, or dicta, will not\r\n     change their viewpoints. The Army then cannot be made the     (p. 023)\r\n     means of engendering conflict among the mass of people\r\n     because of a stand with respect to Negroes which is not\r\n     compatible with the position attained by the Negro in civil\r\n     life.... The Army is not a sociological laboratory; to be\r\n     effective it must be organized and trained according to the\r\n     principles which will insure success. Experiments to meet the\r\n     wishes and demands of the champions of every race and creed for\r\n     the solution of their problems are a danger to efficiency,\r\n     discipline and morale and would result in ultimate defeat.[2-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-14: Col Eugene R. Householder, TAGO,\r\n                   Speech Before Conference of Negro Editors and\r\n                   Publishers, 8 Dec 41, AG 291.21 (12-1-41) (1).]\r\n\r\nThe civil rights advocates refused to concede that the discussion was\r\nover. Judge Hastie, along with a sizable segment of the black press,\r\nbelieved that the beginning of a world war was the time to improve\r\nmilitary effectiveness by increasing black participation in that\r\nwar.[2-15] They argued that eliminating segregation was part of the\r\nstruggle to preserve democracy, the transcendent issue of the war, and\r\nthey viewed the unvarying pattern of separate black units as consonant\r\nwith the racial theories of Nazi Germany.[2-16] Their continuing efforts\r\nto eliminate segregation and discrimination eventually brought Hastie\r\na sharp reminder from John J. McCloy. \"Frankly, I do not think that\r\nthe basic issues of this war are involved in the question of whether\r\ncolored troops serve in segregated units or in mixed units and I doubt\r\nwhether you can convince people of the United States that the basic\r\nissues of freedom are involved in such a question.\" For Negroes, he\r\nwarned sternly, the basic issue was that if the United States lost the\r\nwar, the lot of the black community would be far worse off, and some\r\nNegroes \"do not seem to be vitally concerned about winning the war.\"\r\nWhat all Negroes ought to do, he counseled, was to give unstinting\r\nsupport to the war effort in anticipation of benefits certain to come\r\nafter victory.[2-17]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-15: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_,\r\n                   ch. VI.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-16: Noteworthy is the fact that for\r\n                   several reasons not related to race (for instance,\r\n                   language and nationality) the German Army also\r\n                   organized separate units. Its 162d Infantry\r\n                   Division was composed of troops from Turkestan and\r\n                   the Caucasus, and its 5th SS Panzer Division had\r\n                   segregated Scandinavian, Dutch, and Flemish\r\n                   regiments. Unlike the racially segregated U.S.\r\n                   Army, Germany's so-called Ost units were only\r\n                   administratively organized into separate divisions,\r\n                   and an Ost infantry battalion was often integrated\r\n                   into a \"regular\" German infantry regiment as its\r\n                   fourth infantry battalion. Several allied armies\r\n                   also had segregated units, composed, for example,\r\n                   of Senegalese, Gurkhas, Maoris, and Algerians.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-17: Memo, ASW for Judge Hastie, 2 Jul 42,\r\n                   ASW 291.2, NT 1942.]\r\n\r\nThus very early in World War II, even before the United States was\r\nactively engaged, the issues surrounding the use of Negroes in the\r\nArmy were well defined and the lines sharply drawn. Was segregation, a\r\npractice in conflict with the democratic aims of the country, also a\r\nwasteful use of manpower? How would modifications of policy\r\ncome--through external pressure or internal reform? Could traditional\r\norganizational and social patterns in the military services be changed\r\nduring a war without disrupting combat readiness?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Segregation and Efficiency_\r\n\r\nIn the years before World War II, Army planners never had to consider\r\nsegregation in terms of manpower efficiency. Conditioned by the\r\nexperiences of World War I, when the nation had enjoyed a surplus of\r\nuntapped manpower even at the height of the war, and aware of the\r\noverwhelming manpower surplus of the depression years, the staff   (p. 024)\r\nformulated its mobilization plans with little regard for the\r\neconomical use of the nation's black manpower. Its decision to use\r\nNegroes in proportion to their percentage of the population was the\r\nresult of political pressures rather than military necessity. Black\r\ncombat units were considered a luxury that existed to indulge black\r\ndemands. When the Army began to mobilize in 1940 it proceeded to honor\r\nits pledge, and one year after Pearl Harbor there were 399,454 Negroes\r\nin the Army, 7.4 percent of the total and 7.95 percent of all enlisted\r\ntroops.[2-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-18: Strength of the Army, 1 Jan 46,\r\n                   STM-30, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of segregation on manpower efficiency became apparent only\r\nas the Army tried to translate policy into practice. In the face of\r\nrising black protest and with direct orders from the White House, the\r\nArmy had announced that Negroes would be assigned to all arms and\r\nbranches in the same ratio as whites. Several forces, however, worked\r\nagainst this equitable distribution. During the early months of\r\nmobilization the chiefs of those arms and services that had\r\ntraditionally been all white accepted less than their share of black\r\nrecruits and thus obliged some organizations, the Quartermaster Corps\r\nand the Engineer Corps in particular, to absorb a large percentage of\r\nblack inductees. The imbalance worsened in 1941. In December of that\r\nyear Negroes accounted for 5 percent of the Infantry and less than 2\r\npercent each of the Air Corps, Medical Corps, and Signal Corps. The\r\nQuartermaster Corps was 15 percent black, the Engineer Corps 25\r\npercent, and unassigned and miscellaneous detachments were 27 percent\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of black units could not always be ascribed to racism\r\nalone. With some justification the arms and services tried to restrict\r\nthe number and distribution of Negroes because black units measured\r\nfar below their white counterparts in educational achievement and\r\nability to absorb training, according to the Army General\r\nClassification Test (AGCT). The Army had introduced this test system\r\nin March 1941 as its principal instrument for the measurement of a\r\nsoldier's learning ability. Five categories, with the most gifted in\r\ncategory I, were used in classifying the scores made by the soldiers\r\ntaking the test (_Table 1_). The Army planned to take officers and\r\nenlisted specialists from the top three categories and the semiskilled\r\nsoldiers and laborers from the two lowest.\r\n\r\nTable 1--Classification of All Men Tested From March 1941 Through\r\nDecember 1942\r\n\r\n                         White                  Black\r\n  AGCT Category      Number  Percentage     Number  Percentage\r\n\r\n  I                 273,626        6.6       1,580        0.4\r\n  II              1,154,700       28.0      14,891        3.4\r\n  III             1,327,164       32.1      54,302       12.3\r\n  IV              1,021,818       24.8     152,725       34.7\r\n  V                 351,951        8.5     216,664       49.2\r\n  Total           4,129,259      100.0     440,162      100.0\r\n\r\n_Source_: Tab A, Memo, G-3 for CofS, 10 Apr 43, AG 201.2 (19 Mar 43)(1).\r\n\r\nAlthough there was considerable confusion on the subject, basically\r\nthe Army's mental tests measured educational achievement rather than\r\nnative intelligence, and in 1941 educational achievement in the United\r\nStates hinged more on geography and economics than color. Though black\r\nand white recruits of comparable educations made comparable scores,\r\nthe majority of Negroes came from areas of the country where inferior\r\nschools combined with economic and cultural poverty to put them at a\r\nsignificant disadvantage.[2-19] Many whites suffered similar       (p. 025)\r\ndisadvantages, and in absolute numbers more whites than blacks appeared\r\nin the lower categories. But whereas the Army could distribute the\r\nlow-scoring white soldiers throughout the service so that an\r\nindividual unit could easily absorb its few illiterate and\r\nsemiliterate white men, the Army was obliged to assign an almost equal\r\nnumber of low-scoring Negroes to the relatively few black units where\r\nthey could neither be absorbed nor easily trained. By the same token,\r\nsegregation penalized the educated Negro whose talents were likely to\r\nbe wasted when he was assigned to service units along with the\r\nunskilled.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-19: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_,\r\n                   pp. 241-57.

This report was prepared for the\r\n                   Deputy Under Secretary of the Army for Personnel\r\n                   Management by a working group under the leadership\r\n                   of Dr. Samuel King, Office of the Chief of Research\r\n                   and Development.]\r\n\r\nSegregation further hindered the efficient use of black manpower by\r\ncomplicating the training of black soldiers. Although training\r\nfacilities were at a premium, the Army was forced to provide its\r\ntraining and replacement centers with separate housing and other\r\nfacilities. With an extremely limited number of Regular Army Negroes\r\nto draw from, the service had to create cadres for the new units and\r\nfind officers to lead them. Black recruits destined for most arms and\r\nservices were assured neither units, billets, nor training cadres. The\r\nArmy's solution to the problem: lower the quotas for black inductees.\r\n\r\nThe use of quotas to regulate inductees by race was itself a source of\r\ntension between the Army and the Bureau of Selective Service.[2-20]\r\nSelective Service questioned the legality of the whole procedure\r\nwhereby white and black selectees were delivered on the basis of\r\nseparate calls; in many areas of the country draft boards were under\r\nattack for passing over large numbers of Negroes in order to fill\r\nthese racial quotas. With the Navy depending exclusively on\r\nvolunteers, Selective Service had by early 1943 a backlog of 300,000\r\nblack registrants who, according to their order numbers, should have\r\nbeen called to service but had been passed over. Selective Service\r\nwanted to eliminate the quota system altogether. At the very least it\r\ndemanded that the Army accept more Negroes to adjust the racial\r\nimbalance of the draft rolls. The Army, determined to preserve the\r\nquota system, tried to satisfy the Selective Service's minimum\r\ndemands, making room for more black inductees by forcing its arms  (p. 026)\r\nand services to create more black units. Again the cost to efficiency\r\nwas high.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-20: For discussion of how Selective\r\n                   Service channeled manpower into the armed forces,\r\n                   see Selective Service System, Special Monograph\r\n                   Number 10, _Special Groups_ (Washington: Government\r\n                   Printing Office, 1953), ch.

IV-VI.]\r\n\r\n     Under the pressure of providing sufficient units for Negroes, the\r\n     organization of units for the sake of guaranteeing vacancies\r\n     became a major goal. In some cases, careful examination of the\r\n     usefulness of the types of units provided was subordinated to the\r\n     need to create units which could receive Negroes. As a result,\r\n     several types of units with limited military value were formed in\r\n     some branches for the specific purpose of absorbing otherwise\r\n     unwanted Negroes. Conversely, certain types of units with\r\n     legitimate and important military functions were filled with\r\n     Negroes who could not function efficiently in the tasks to which\r\n     they were assigned.[2-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-21: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, p.\r\n                   113.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGINEER CONSTRUCTION TROOPS IN LIBERIA, JULY 1942.]\r\n\r\nThe practice of creating units for the specific purpose of absorbing\r\nNegroes was particularly evident in the Army Air Forces.[2-22] Long\r\nconsidered the most recalcitrant of branches in accepting Negroes, (p. 027)\r\nthe Air Corps had successfully exempted itself from the allotment of\r\nblack troops in the 1940 mobilization plans. Black pilots could not be\r\nused, Maj. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, explained,\r\n\"since this would result in having Negro officers serving over white\r\nenlisted men. This would create an impossible social problem.\"[2-23]\r\nAnd this situation could not be avoided, since it would take several\r\nyears to train black mechanics; meanwhile black pilots would have to\r\nwork with white ground crews, often at distant bases outside their\r\nregular chain of command. The Air Corps faced strong opposition    (p. 028)\r\nwhen both the civil rights advocates and the rest of the Army attacked\r\nthis exclusion. The civil rights organizations wanted a place for\r\nNegroes in the glamorous Air Corps, but even more to the point the\r\nother arms and services wanted this large branch of the Army to absorb\r\nits fair share of black recruits, thus relieving the rest of a\r\ndisproportionate burden.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-22: The Army's air arm was reorganized\r\n                   several times. Designated as the Army Air Corps in\r\n                   1926 (the successor to the historic Army Air\r\n                   Service), it became the Army Air Forces in the\r\n                   summer of 1941. This designation lasted until a\r\n                   separate U.S. Air Force was created in 1947.\r\n                   Organizationally, the Army was divided in March\r\n                   1942 into three equal parts: the Army Ground\r\n                   Forces, the Army Service Forces (originally\r\n                   Services of Supply), and the Army Air Forces.

Its 1941 mobilization plans provided for the formation of\r\nnine separate black aviation squadrons which would perform the\r\nmiscellaneous tasks associated with the upkeep of airfields. During\r\nthe next year the Chief of Staff set the allotment of black recruits\r\nfor the air arm at a rate that brought over 77,500 Negroes into the\r\nAir Corps by 1943. On 16 January 1941 Under Secretary Patterson\r\nannounced the formation of a black pursuit squadron, but the Army Air\r\nForces, bowing to the opposition typified by General Arnold's comments\r\nof the previous year, trained the black pilots in separate facilities\r\nat Tuskegee, Alabama, where the Army tried to duplicate the expensive\r\ntraining center established for white officers at Maxwell Field, just\r\nforty miles away.[2-24] Black pilots were at first trained exclusively\r\nfor pursuit flying, a very difficult kind of combat for which a Negro\r\nhad to qualify both physically and technically or else, in Judge   (p. 029)\r\nHastie's words, \"not fly at all.\"[2-25] The 99th Fighter Squadron was\r\norganized at Tuskegee in 1941 and sent to the Mediterranean theater in\r\nApril 1943. By then the all-black 332d Fighter Group with three\r\nadditional fighter squadrons had been organized, and in 1944 it too\r\nwas deployed to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-24: USAF Oral History Program, Interv\r\n                   with Maj Gen Noel F Parrish (USAF, Ret.), 30 Mar\r\n                   73.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-25: William H.

All applicants in\r\nexcess of requirements were placed on an indefinite waiting list where\r\nmany became overage or were requisitioned for other military and\r\ncivilian duties. Yet when the Army Air Forces finally decided to\r\norganize a black bomber unit, the 477th Bombardment Group, in late\r\n1943, it encountered a scarcity of black pilots and crewmen. Because\r\nof the lack of technical and educational opportunities for Negroes in\r\nAmerica, fewer blacks than whites were included in the manpower pool,\r\nand Tuskegee, already overburdened with its manifold training\r\nfunctions and lacking the means to train bomber crews, was unable to\r\nfill the training gap. Sending black cadets to white training schools\r\nwas one obvious solution; the Army Air Forces chose instead to\r\npostpone the operational date of the 477th until its pilots could be\r\ntrained at Tuskegee. In the end, the 477th was not declared        (p. 030)\r\noperational until after the war. Even then some compromise with the\r\nArmy Air Forces' segregation principles was necessary, since Tuskegee\r\ncould not accommodate B-25 pilot transition and navigator-bombardier\r\ntraining. In 1944 black officers were therefore temporarily assigned\r\nto formerly all-white schools for such training. Tuskegee's position\r\nas the sole and separate training center for black pilots remained\r\ninviolate until its closing in 1946, however, and its graduates, the\r\n\"Tuskegee Airmen,\" continued to serve as a powerful symbol of armed\r\nforces segregation.[2-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-26: For a detailed discussion of the\r\n                   black training program, see Osur, _Blacks in the\r\n                   Army Air Forces During World War II_, ch.

At first\r\nthe possibility of integrated training seemed unlikely, for even\r\nthough Assistant Secretary of War for Air Robert A. Lovett had assured\r\nHastie that officer candidate training would be integrated, the\r\nTechnical Training Command announced plans in 1942 for a segregated\r\nfacility. Although the plans were quickly canceled the command's\r\nannouncement was the immediate cause for Hastie's resignation from the\r\nWar Department. The Air staff assured the Assistant Secretary of War\r\nin January of 1943 that qualified Negroes were being sent to officer\r\ncandidate schools and to training courses \"throughout the school\r\nsystem of the Technical Training Command.\"[2-27] In fact, Negroes did\r\nattend the Air Forces' officer candidate school at Miami Beach,\r\nalthough not in great numbers. In spite of their integrated training,\r\nhowever, most of these black officers were assigned to the\r\npredominantly black units at Tuskegee and Godman fields.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-27: Memo, CofAS for ASW, 12 Jan 43, ASW\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Army Air Forces found it easier to absorb the thousands of black\r\nenlisted men than to handle the black flying squadrons. For the\r\nenlisted men it created a series of units with vaguely defined duties,\r\nusually common labor jobs operating for the most part under a bulk\r\nallotment system that allowed the Air Forces to absorb great numbers\r\nof new men. Through 1943 hundreds of these aviation training\r\nsquadrons, quartermaster truck companies, and engineer aviation and\r\nair base security battalions were added to the Air Forces'\r\norganization tables. Practically every American air base in the world\r\nhad its contingent of black troops performing the service duties\r\nconnected with air operations.\r\n\r\nThe Air Corps, like the Armor and the Artillery branches, was able to\r\nform separate squadrons or battalions for black troops, but the\r\nInfantry and Cavalry found it difficult to organize the growing number\r\nof separate black battalions and regiments. The creation of black\r\ndivisions was the obvious solution, although this arrangement would\r\nrun counter to current practice, which was based in part on the Army's\r\nexperience with the 92d Division in World War I. Convinced of the poor\r\nperformance of that unit in 1918, the War Department had decided in\r\nthe 1920's not to form any more black divisions. The regiment would\r\nserve as the basic black unit, and from time to time these regiments\r\nwould be employed as organic elements of divisions whose other\r\nregiments and units would be white. In keeping with this decision, the\r\nblack 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments were combined in October      (p. 031)\r\n1940 with white regiments to form the 2d Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\nBefore World War II most black leaders had agreed with the Army's\r\nopposition to all-black divisions, but for different reasons. They\r\nconsidered that such divisions only served to strengthen the\r\nsegregation pattern they so opposed. In the early weeks of the war a\r\nconference of black editors, including Walter White, pressed for the\r\ncreation of an experimental integrated division of volunteers. White\r\nargued that such a unit would lift black morale, \"have a tremendous\r\npsychological effect upon white America,\" and refute the enemy's\r\ncharge that \"the United States talks about democracy but practices\r\nracial discrimination and segregation.\"[2-28] The NAACP organized a\r\npopular movement in support of the idea, which was endorsed by many\r\nimportant individuals and organizations.[2-29] Yet this experiment was\r\nunacceptable to the Army. Ignoring its experience with all-volunteer\r\nparatroopers and other special units, the War Department declared that\r\nthe volunteer system was \"an ineffective and dangerous\" method of\r\nraising combat units. Admitting that the integrated division might be\r\nan encouraging gesture toward certain minorities, General Marshall\r\nadded that \"the urgency of the present military situation necessitates\r\nour using tested and proved methods of procedure, and using them with\r\nall haste.\"[2-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-28: Ltr, Walter White to Gen Marshall, 22\r\n                   Dec 41, AG 291.21 (12-22-41).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-29: See C-279, 2, Volunteer Division\r\n                   Folder, NAACP Collection, Manuscripts Division,\r\n                   LC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-30: Ltr, CofS to Dorothy Canfield Fisher,\r\n                   16 Feb 42, OCS 20602-254.]\r\n\r\nEven though it rejected the idea of a volunteer, integrated division,\r\nthe Army staff reviewed in the fall of 1942 a proposal for\r\nthe assignment of some black recruits to white units. The\r\nOrganization-Mobilization Group of G-3, headed by Col. Edwin W.\r\nChamberlain, argued that the Army General Classification Test scores\r\nproved that black soldiers in groups were less useful to the Army than\r\nwhite soldiers in groups. It was a waste of manpower, funds, and\r\nequipment, therefore, to organize the increasingly large numbers of\r\nblack recruits into segregated units. Not only was such organization\r\nwasteful, but segregation \"aggravated if not caused in its entirety\"\r\nthe racial friction that was already plaguing the Army. To avoid both\r\nthe waste and the strife, Chamberlain recommended that the Army halt\r\nthe activation of additional black units and integrate black recruits\r\nin the low-score categories, IV and V, into white units in the ratio\r\nof one black to nine whites. The black recruits would be used as\r\ncooks, orderlies, and drivers, and in other jobs which required only\r\nthe minimum basic training and which made up 10 to 20 percent of those\r\nin the average unit. Negroes in the higher categories, I through III,\r\nwould be assigned to existing black units where they could be expected\r\nto improve the performance of those units. Chamberlain defended his\r\nplan against possible charges of discrimination by pointing out that\r\nthe Negroes would be assigned wholly on the basis of native capacity,\r\nnot race, and that this plan would increase the opportunities for\r\nNegroes to participate in the war effort. To those who objected on the\r\ngrounds that the proposal meant racial integration, Chamberlain\r\nreplied that there was no more integration involved than in \"the   (p. 032)\r\nemployment of Negroes as servants in a white household.\"[2-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-31: Draft Memo (initialed E.W.C.) for Gen\r\n                   Edwards, G-3 Negro File, 1942-44. See also Lee,\r\n                   _Employment of Negro Troops_, pp. 152-57.]\r\n\r\nThe Chamberlain Plan and a variant proposed the following spring\r\nprompted discussion in the Army staff that clearly revealed general\r\ndissatisfaction with the current policy. Nonetheless, in the face of\r\nopposition from the service and ground forces, the plan was abandoned.\r\nYet because something had to be done with the mounting numbers of\r\nblack draftees, the Army staff reversed the decision made in its\r\nprewar mobilization plans and turned once more to the concept of the\r\nall-black division. The 93d Infantry Division was reactivated in the\r\nspring of 1942 and the 92d the following fall. The 2d Cavalry Division\r\nwas reconstituted as an all-black unit and reactivated in February\r\n1943. These units were capable of absorbing 15,000 or more men each\r\nand could use men trained in the skills of practically every arm and\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis absorbency potential became increasingly important in 1943 when\r\nthe chairman of the War Manpower Commission, Paul V. McNutt, began to\r\nattack the use of racial quotas in selecting inductees. He considered\r\nthe practice of questionable legality, and the commission faced\r\nmounting public criticism as white husbands and fathers were drafted\r\nwhile single healthy Negroes were not called.[2-32] Secretary Stimson\r\ndefended the legality of the quota system. He did not consider the\r\ncurrent practice \"discriminatory in any way\" so long as the Army\r\naccepted its fair percentage of Negroes. He pointed out that the\r\nSelective Service Act provided that no man would be inducted \"_unless\r\nand until_\" he was acceptable to the services, and Negroes were\r\nacceptable \"only at a rate at which they can be properly\r\nassimilated.\"[2-33] Stimson later elaborated on this theme, arguing that\r\nthe quota system would be necessary even after the Army reached full\r\nstrength because inductions would be limited to replacement of losses.\r\nSince there were few Negroes in combat, their losses would be\r\nconsiderably less than those of whites. McNutt disagreed with\r\nStimson's interpretation of the law and announced plans to abandon it\r\nas soon as the current backlog of uninducted Negroes was absorbed, a\r\ndate later set for January 1944.[2-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-32: Ltr, Paul V.

So long\r\nas the Army requested more Negroes than the bureau could supply,\r\nlittle danger existed that McNutt would carry out his threat.[2-35] But\r\nit was no victory for the Army. The question of the quota's legality\r\nremained unanswered, and it appeared that the Army might be forced to\r\nabandon the system at some future time when there was a black surplus.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-35: The danger was further reduced when,\r\n                   as part of a national manpower allocation reform,\r\n                   President Roosevelt removed the Bureau of Selective\r\n                   Service from the War Manpower Commission's control\r\n                   and restored it to its independent status as the\r\n                   Selective Service System on 5 December 1943.

Stimson,\" in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons for the sudden shortage of black inductees (p. 033)\r\nin the spring of 1943. Since more Negroes were leaving the service for\r\nhealth or other reasons, the number of calls for black draftees had\r\nincreased. In addition, local draft boards were rejecting more\r\nNegroes. But the basic reason for the shortage was that the magnitude\r\nof the war had finally turned the manpower surpluses of the 1930's\r\ninto manpower shortages, and the shortages were appearing in black as\r\nwell as white levies for the armed forces. The Negro was no longer a\r\nmanpower luxury. The quota calls for Negroes rose in 1944, and black\r\nstrength stood at 701,678 men in September, approximately 9.6 percent\r\nof the whole Army. [2-36] The percentage of black women in the Army\r\nstayed at less than 6 percent of the Women's Army Auxiliary\r\nCorps--after July 1943 the Women's Army Corps--throughout the war.\r\nTraining and serving under the same racial policy that governed the\r\nemployment of men, the women's corps also had a black recruitment goal\r\nof 10 percent, but despite the active efforts of recruiters and\r\ngenerally favorable publicity from civil rights groups, the volunteer\r\norganization was unable to overcome the attitude among young black\r\nwomen that they would not be well received at Army posts.[2-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-36: Strength of the Army, 1 Jan 46,\r\n                   STM-30, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-37: Memo, Dir of Mil Pers, SOS, for G-1,\r\n                   12 Sep 42, SPGAM/322.5 (WAAC) (8-24-42).

See also Lee, _Employment of Negro\r\n                   Troops_, pp. 421-26.]\r\n\r\nFaced with manpower shortages, the Army began to reassess its plan to\r\ndistribute Negroes proportionately throughout the arms and services.\r\nThe demand for new service units had soared as the size of the\r\noverseas armies grew, while black combat units, unwanted by overseas\r\ncommanders, had remained stationed in the United States. The War\r\nDepartment hoped to ease the strain on manpower resources by\r\nconverting black combat troops into service troops. A notable example\r\nof the wholesale conversion of such combat troops and one that\r\nreceived considerable notice in the press was the inactivation of the\r\n2d Cavalry Division upon its arrival in North Africa in March 1944.\r\nVictims of the change included the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments,\r\nhistoric combat units that had fought with distinction in the Indian\r\nwars, with Teddy Roosevelt in Cuba, and in the Philippine\r\nInsurrection.[2-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-38: Inactivation of the 2d Cavalry\r\n                   Division began in February 1944, and its\r\n                   headquarters completed the process on 10 May. The\r\n                   9th Cavalry was inactivated on 7 March, the 10th\r\n                   Cavalry on 20 March 1944.]\r\n\r\nBy trying to justify the conversion, Secretary Stimson only aggravated\r\nthe controversy. In the face of congressional questions and criticism\r\nin the black press, Stimson declared that the decision stemmed from a\r\nstudy of the relative abilities and status of training of the troops\r\nin the units available for conversion. If black units were\r\nparticularly affected, it was because \"many of the Negro units have\r\nbeen unable to master efficiently the techniques of modern\r\nweapons.\"[2-39] Thus, by the end of 1944, the Army had abandoned its\r\nattempt to maintain a balance between black combat and service units,\r\nand during the rest of the war most Negroes were assigned to service\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-39: Ltr, SW to Rep. Hamilton Fish, 19 Feb\r\n                   44, reprinted in U.S. Congress, House,\r\n                   _Congressional Record_, 78th Cong., 2d sess., pp.\r\n                   2007-08.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the War Department, the relationship between Negroes  (p. 034)\r\nand the Army was a mutual obligation. Negroes had the right and duty\r\nto serve their country to the best of their abilities; the Army had\r\nthe right and the duty to see that they did so. True, the use of black\r\ntroops was made difficult because their schooling had been largely\r\ninferior and their work therefore chiefly unskilled. Nevertheless, the\r\nArmy staff concluded, all races were equally endowed for war and most\r\nof the less mentally alert could fight if properly led.[2-40] A manual\r\non leadership observed:\r\n\r\n     War Department concern with the Negro is focused directly and\r\n     solely on the problem of the most effective use of colored troops\r\n      ... the Army has no authority or intention to participate in\r\n     social reform as such but does view the problem as a matter of\r\n     efficient troop utilization. With an imposed ceiling on the\r\n     maximum strength of the Army it is the responsibility of all\r\n     officers to assure the most efficient use of the manpower\r\n     assigned.[2-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-40: War Department Pamphlet 20-6,\r\n                   _Command of Negro Troops_, 29 February 1944.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-41: Army Service Forces Manual M-5,\r\n                   _Leadership and the Negro Soldier_, October 1944,\r\n                   p. iv.]\r\n\r\nBut the best efforts of good officers could not avail against poor\r\npolicy. Although the Army maintained that Negroes had to bear a\r\nproportionate share of the casualties, by policy it assigned the\r\nmajority to noncombat units and thus withheld the chance for them to\r\nassume an equal risk. Subscribing to the advantage of making full use\r\nof individual abilities, the Army nevertheless continued to consider\r\nNegroes as a group and to insist that military efficiency required\r\nracially segregated units. Segregation in turn burdened the service\r\nwith the costly provision of separate facilities for the races.\r\nAlthough a large number of Negroes served in World War II, their\r\nemployment was limited in opportunity and expensive for the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Need for Change_\r\n\r\nIf segregation weakened the Army's organization for global war, it had\r\neven more serious effects on every tenth soldier, for as it deepened\r\nthe Negro's sense of inferiority it devastated his morale. It was a\r\nmajor cause of the poor performance and the disciplinary problems that\r\nplagued so many black units. And it made black soldiers blame their\r\npersonal difficulties and misfortunes, many the common lot of any\r\nsoldier, on racial discrimination.[2-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-42: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, p.\r\n                   84; for a full discussion of morale, see ch.

Early in\r\nthe war Secretary Stimson had agreed with a General Staff\r\nrecommendation that a permanent committee be formed to evaluate racial\r\nincidents, propose special reforms, and answer questions involving the\r\ntraining and assignment of Negroes.[2-43] On 27 August 1942 he\r\nestablished the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies, with\r\nAssistant Secretary McCloy as chairman.[2-44] Caught in the cross  (p. 035)\r\nfire of black demands and Army traditions, the committee contented\r\nitself at first with collecting information on the racial situation\r\nand acting as a clearinghouse for recommendations on the employment of\r\nblack troops.[2-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-43: Memo, G-1 for CofS, 18 Jul 42; DF,\r\n                   G-1 to TAG, 11 Aug 42.

The trouble was a product of many factors, including the\r\npsychological effects of segregation which may not have been so\r\nobvious to the committee or even to the black soldier. Other factors,\r\nhowever, were visible to all and begged for remedial action. For\r\nexample, the practice of using racially separated facilities on\r\nmilitary posts, which was not sanctioned in the Army's basic plan for\r\nblack troops, took hold early in the war. Many black units were\r\nlocated at camps in the south, where commanders insisted on applying\r\nlocal laws and customs inside the military reservations. This      (p. 036)\r\npractice spread rapidly, and soon in widely separated sections of the\r\ncountry commanders were separating the races in theaters, post\r\nexchanges, service clubs, and buses operating on posts. The\r\naccommodations provided Negroes were separate but rarely equal, and\r\nsubstandard recreational and housing facilities assigned to black\r\ntroops were a constant source of irritation. In fact the Army, through\r\nthe actions of local commanders, actually introduced Jim Crow in some\r\nplaces at home and abroad. Negroes considered such practices in\r\nviolation of military regulations and inconsistent with the announced\r\nprinciples for which the United States was fighting. Many believed\r\nthemselves the victims of the personal prejudices of the local\r\ncommander. Judge Hastie reported their feelings: \"The traditional\r\nmores of the South have been widely accepted and adopted by the Army\r\nas the basis of policy and practice affecting the Negro soldier.... In\r\ntactical organization, in physical location, in human contacts, the\r\nNegro soldier is separated from the white soldier as completely as\r\npossible.\"[2-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-46: Memo, Hastie for SW, 22 Sep 41, sub:\r\n                   Survey and Recommendations Concerning the\r\n                   Integration of the Negro Soldier Into the Army,\r\n                   G-1/15640-120.]\r\n\r\nIn November 1941 another controversy erupted over the discovery that\r\nthe Red Cross had established racially segregated blood banks. The Red\r\nCross readily admitted that it had no scientific justification for the\r\nracial separation of blood and blamed the armed services for the\r\ndecision. Despite the evidence of science and at risk of demoralizing\r\nthe black community, the Army's Surgeon General defended the\r\ncontroversial practice as necessary to insure the acceptance of a\r\npotentially unpopular program. Ignoring constant criticism from the\r\nNAACP and elements of the black press, the armed forces continued to\r\ndemand segregated blood banks throughout the war. Negroes appreciated\r\nthe irony of the situation, for they were well aware that a black\r\ndoctor, Charles R. Drew, had been a pioneer researcher in the plasma\r\nextraction process and had directed the first Red Cross blood\r\nbank.[2-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-47: On 16 January 1942 the Navy announced\r\n                   that \"in deference to the wishes of those for whom\r\n                   the plasma is being provided, the blood will be\r\n                   processed separately so that those receiving\r\n                   transfusions may be given blood of their own race.\"\r\n                   Three days later the Chief of the Bureau of\r\n                   Medicine, who was also the President's personal\r\n                   physician, told the Secretary of the Navy, \"It is\r\n                   my opinion that at this time we cannot afford to\r\n                   open up a subject such as mixing blood or plasma\r\n                   regardless of the theoretical fact that there is no\r\n                   chemical difference in human blood.\" See Memo, Rear\r\n                   Adm Ross T.

Morton, \"The Federal\r\n                   Government and Negro Morale,\" _Journal of Negro\r\n                   Education_ (Summer 1943): 452, 455-56.]\r\n\r\nBlack morale suffered further in the leadership crisis that developed\r\nin black units early in the war. The logic of segregated units\r\ndemanded a black officer corps, but there were never enough black\r\nofficers to command all the black units. In 1942 only 0.35 percent of\r\nthe Negroes in the Army were officers, a shortcoming that could not be\r\nexplained by poor education alone.[2-48] But when the number of black\r\nofficers did begin to increase, obstacles to their employment\r\nappeared: some white commanders, assuming that Negroes did not\r\npossess leadership ability and that black troops preferred white   (p. 037)\r\nofficers, demanded white officers for their units. Limited segregated\r\nrecreational and living facilities for black officers prevented their\r\nassignment to some bases, while the active opposition of civilian\r\ncommunities forced the Army to exclude them from others. The Army\r\nstaff practice of forbidding Negroes to outrank or command white\r\nofficers serving in the same unit not only limited the employment and\r\nrestricted the rank of black officers but also created invidious\r\ndistinctions between white and black officers in the same unit. It\r\ntended to convince enlisted men that their black leaders were not\r\nfull-fledged officers. Thus restricted in assignment and segregated\r\nsocially and professionally, his ability and status in question, the\r\nblack officer was often an object of scorn to himself and to his men.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-48: Eli Ginzberg, _The Negro Potential_\r\n                   (New York: Columbia University Press, 1956), p. 85.\r\n                   Ginzberg points out that only about one out of ten\r\n                   black soldiers in the upper two mental categories\r\n                   became an officer, compared to one out of four\r\n                   white soldiers.]\r\n\r\nThe attitude and caliber of white officers assigned to black units\r\nhardly compensated for the lack of black officers. In general, white\r\nofficers resented their assignment to black units and were quick to\r\nseek transfer. Worse still, black units, where sensitive and patient\r\nleaders were needed to create an effective military force, often\r\nbecame, as they had in earlier wars, dumping grounds for officers\r\nunwanted in white units.[2-49] The Army staff further aggravated black\r\nsensibilities by showing a preference for officers of southern birth\r\nand training, believing them to be generally more competent to\r\nexercise command over Negroes. In reality many Negroes, especially\r\nthose from the urban centers, particularly resented southern officers.\r\nAt best these officers appeared paternalistic, and Negroes disliked\r\nbeing treated as a separate and distinct group that needed special\r\nhandling and protection. As General Davis later circumspectly\r\nreported, \"many colored people of today expect only a certain line of\r\ntreatment from white officers born and reared in the South, namely,\r\nthat which follows the southern pattern, which is most distasteful to\r\nthem.\"[2-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-49: Memo, DCofS to CG, AAF, 10 Aug 42,\r\n                   sub: Professional Qualities of Officers Assigned to\r\n                   Negro Units, WDGAP 322.99; Memo, CG, VII Corps, to\r\n                   CG, AGF, 28 Aug 42, same sub, GNAGS 210.31.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-50: Brig Gen B.

As news of the conversion of black units from combat\r\nto service duties and the word that no new black combat units were\r\nbeing organized became a matter of public knowledge, the black press\r\nasked: Will any black combat units be left? Will any of those left be\r\nallowed to fight? In fact, would black units ever get overseas?\r\n\r\nActually, the Army had a clear-cut plan for the overseas employment of\r\nboth black service and combat units. In May 1942 the War Department\r\ndirected the Army Air Forces, Ground Forces, and Service Forces to\r\nmake sure that black troops were ordered overseas in numbers not less\r\nthan their percentage in each of these commands. Theater commanders\r\nwould be informed of orders moving black troops to their commands, but\r\nthey would not be asked to agree to their shipment beforehand. Since\r\ntroop shipments to the British Isles were the chief concern at     (p. 038)\r\nthat time, the order added that \"there will be no positive\r\nrestrictions on the use of colored troops in the British Isles, but\r\nshipment of colored units to the British Isles will be limited,\r\ninitially, to those in the service categories.\"[2-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-51: Ltr, TAG to CG, AAF, et al., 13 May\r\n                   42, AG 291.21 (3-31-42).]\r\n\r\nThe problem here was not the Army's policy but the fact that certain\r\nforeign governments and even some commanders in American territories\r\nwanted to exclude Negroes. Some countries objected to black soldiers\r\nbecause they feared race riots and miscegenation. Others with large\r\nblack populations of their own felt that black soldiers with their\r\nhigher rates of pay might create unrest. Still other countries had\r\nnational exclusion laws. In the case of Alaska and Trinidad, Secretary\r\nStimson ordered, \"Don't yield.\" Speaking of Iceland, Greenland, and\r\nLabrador, he commented, \"Pretty cold for blacks.\" To the request of\r\nPanamanian officials that a black signal construction unit be\r\nwithdrawn from their country he replied, \"Tell them [the black unit]\r\nthey must complete their work--it is ridiculous to raise such\r\nobjections when the Panama Canal itself was built with black labor.\"\r\nAs for Chile and Venezuela's exclusion of Negroes he ruled that \"As we\r\nare the petitioners here we probably must comply.\"[2-52] Stimson's\r\nrulings led to a new War Department policy: henceforth black soldiers\r\nwould be assigned without regard to color except that they would not\r\nbe sent to extreme northern areas or to any country against its will\r\nwhen the United States had requested the right to station troops in\r\nthat country.[2-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-52: Stimson's comments were not limited\r\n                   to overseas areas.

Unwilling to add racial\r\nproblems to their administrative burdens, some commanders had been\r\nknown to cancel their request for troops rather than accept black\r\nunits. Consequently, very few Negroes were sent overseas in the early\r\nyears of the war.\r\n\r\nBlack soldiers were often the victims of gross discrimination that\r\ntranscended their difficulties with the Army's administration. For\r\ninstance, black soldiers, particularly those from more integrated\r\nregions of the country, resented local ordinances governing\r\ntransportation and recreation facilities that put them at a great\r\ndisadvantage in the important matters of leave and amusement.\r\nInfractions of local rules were inevitable and led to heightened\r\nracial tension and recurring violence.[2-54] At times black soldiers\r\nthemselves, reflecting the low morale and lack of discipline in their\r\nunits, instigated the violence. Whoever the culprits, the Army's files\r\nare replete with cases of discrimination charged, investigations\r\nlaunched, and exonerations issued or reforms ordered.[2-55] An\r\nincredible amount of time and effort went into handling these cases\r\nduring the darkest days of the war--cases growing out of a policy  (p. 039)\r\ncreated in the name of military efficiency.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-54: Memo, Civilian Aide to SW, 17 Nov 42,\r\n                   ASW 291.2 NT.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-55: See, for example, AAF Central Decimal\r\n                   Files for October 1942-May 1944 (RG 18).

Racial friction\r\nalso developed in Great Britain where some American troops, resenting\r\ntheir black countrymen's social acceptance by the British, tried to\r\nexport Jim Crow by forcing the segregation of recreational facilities.\r\nAppreciating the treatment they were receiving from the British, the\r\nblack soldiers fought back, and the clashes grew at times to riot\r\nproportions. General Davis considered discrimination and prejudice the\r\ncause of trouble, but he placed the immediate blame on local\r\ncommanders. Many commanders, convinced that they had little\r\njurisdiction over racial disputes in the civilian community or simply\r\nrefusing to accept responsibility, delegated the task of keeping order\r\nto their noncommissioned officers and military police.[2-56] These men,\r\nrarely experienced in handling racial disturbances and often\r\nprejudiced against black soldiers, usually managed to exacerbate the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-56: Memo, Brig Gen B.

In the summer of 1943 the Army began to reap what Ulysses\r\nLee called the \"harvest of disorder.\" Race riots occurred at military\r\nreservations in Mississippi, Georgia, California, Texas, and Kentucky.\r\nAt other stations, the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies\r\nsomberly warned, there were indications of unrest ready to erupt into\r\nviolence.[2-57] By the middle of the war, violence over racial issues at\r\nhome and abroad had become a source of constant concern for the War\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-57: Memo, ASW for CofS, 3 Jul 43, sub:\r\n                   Negro Troops, ASW 291.2 NT.

On the contrary, the Army staff continued to insist\r\nthat segregation was a national issue and that the Army's task was to\r\ndefend the country, not alter its social customs. Until the nation\r\nchanged its racial practices or until Congress ordered such changes\r\nfor the armed forces, racially separated units would remain.[2-58] In\r\n1941 the Army had insisted that debate on the subject was closed,[2-59]\r\nand, in fact, except for discussion of the Chamberlain Plan there was\r\nno serious thought of revising racial policy in the Army staff until\r\nafter the war.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-58: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, p.\r\n                   83.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-59: Ltr, TAG to Dr. Amanda V.

These surveys\r\nsupported the theory that the Army, a national institution         (p. 040)\r\ncomposed of individual citizens with pronounced views on race, would\r\nmeet massive disobedience and internal disorder as well as national\r\nresistance to any substantial change in policy. One extensive survey,\r\ncovering 13,000 soldiers in ninety-two units, revealed that 88 percent\r\nof the whites and 38 percent of the Negroes preferred segregated\r\nunits. Among the whites, 85 percent preferred separate service clubs\r\nand 81 percent preferred separate post exchanges. Almost half of the\r\nNegroes thought separate service clubs and post exchanges were a good\r\nidea.[2-60] These attitudes merely reflected widely held national\r\nviews as suggested in a 1943 survey of five key cities by the Office\r\nof War Information.[2-61] The survey showed that 90 percent of the\r\nwhites and 25 percent of the blacks questioned supported segregation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-60: Research Branch, Special Service\r\n                   Division, \"What the Soldier Thinks,\" 8 December\r\n                   1942, and \"Attitudes of the Negro Soldier,\" 28 July\r\n                   1943.

Reviewing the support for segregation revealed in the\r\nsurveys, for example, the Special Services Division commented: \"Many\r\nof the Negroes and some of the whites who favor separation in the Army\r\nindicate by their comments that they are opposed to segregation in\r\nprinciple. They favor separation in the Army to avoid trouble or\r\nunpleasantness.\" Its report added that the longer a Negro remained in\r\nthe Army, the less likely he was to support segregation.[2-62] Nor did\r\nit follow from the overwhelming support for segregation that a policy\r\nof integration would result in massive resistance. As critics later\r\npointed out, the same surveys revealed that almost half the\r\nrespondents expressed a strong preference for civilian life, but the\r\nArmy did not infer that serious disorders would result if these men\r\nwere forced to remain in uniform.[2-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-62: Special Services Division, \"What the\r\n                   Soldier Thinks,\" Number 2, August 1943, pp. 58-59,\r\n                   SSD 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-63: Dollard and Young, \"In the Armed\r\n                   Forces,\" p. 68.]\r\n\r\nBy 1943 Negroes within and without the War Department had just about\r\nexhausted arguments for a policy change. After two years of trying,\r\nJudge Hastie came to believe that change was possible only in response\r\nto \"strong and manifest public opinion.\" He concluded that he would be\r\nfar more useful as a private citizen who could express his views\r\nfreely and publicly than he was as a War Department employee, bound to\r\nconform to official policy. Quitting the department, Hastie joined the\r\nincreasingly vocal black organizations in a sustained attack on the\r\nArmy's segregation policy, an attack that was also being translated\r\ninto political action by the major civil rights organizations. In\r\n1943, a full year before the national elections, representatives of\r\ntwenty-five civil rights groups met and formulated the demands     (p. 041)\r\nthey would make of the presidential candidates: full integration (some\r\ngroups tempered this demand by calling for integrated units of\r\nvolunteers); abolition of racial quotas; abolition of segregation in\r\nrecreational and other Army facilities; abolition of blood plasma\r\nsegregation; development of an educational program in race relations\r\nin the Army; greater black participation in combat forces; and the\r\nprogressive removal of black troops from areas where they were subject\r\nto disrespect, abuse, and even violence.[2-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-64: New York _Times_, December 2, 1943.]\r\n\r\nThe Army could not afford to ignore these demands completely, as\r\nTruman K. Gibson, Jr., Judge Hastie's successor, pointed out.[2-65] The\r\npolitical situation indicated that the racial policy of the armed\r\nforces would be an issue in the next national election. Recalling the\r\nchanges forced on the Army as a result of political pressures applied\r\nbefore the 1940 election, Gibson predicted that actions that might now\r\nseem impolitic to the Army and the White House might not seem so\r\nduring the next campaign when the black vote could influence the\r\noutcome in several important states, including New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nIllinois, and Michigan. Already the Chicago _Tribune_ and other\r\nanti-administration groups were trying to encourage black protest in\r\nterms not always accurate but nonetheless believable to the black\r\nvoter. Gibson suggested that the Army act before the political\r\npressure became even more intense.[2-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-65: Gibson, a lawyer and a graduate of\r\n                   the University of Chicago, became Judge Hastie's\r\n                   assistant in 1940. After Hastie's resignation on 29\r\n                   January 1943, Gibson served as acting civilian aide\r\n                   and assumed the position permanently on 21\r\n                   September 1943. See Memo, ASW for Admin Asst (John\r\n                   W.

See also New York _Times_, December 2,\r\n                   1943.]\r\n\r\nCaught between the black demands and War Department traditions, the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies launched an attack--much\r\ntoo late and too weak, its critics agreed--on what it perceived as the\r\ncauses of the Army's racial disorders. Some of the credit for this\r\nattack must go to Truman Gibson. No less dedicated to abolition of\r\nracial segregation than Hastie, Gibson eschewed the grand gesture and\r\nemphasized those practical changes that could be effected one step at\r\na time. For all his zeal, Gibson was admirably detached.[2-67] He knew\r\nthat his willingness to recognize that years of oppression and\r\ninjustice had marred the black soldier's performance would earn for\r\nhim the scorn of many civil rights activists, but he also knew that\r\nhis fairness made him an effective advocate in the War Department. He\r\nworked closely with McCloy's committee, always describing with his\r\nalternatives for action their probable effect upon the Army, the\r\npublic, and the developing military situation. As a result of the\r\nclose cooperation between the Advisory Committee and Gibson, the Army\r\nfor the first time began to agree on practical if not policy changes.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-67: For discussion of Gibson's attitude\r\n                   and judgments, see Interv, author with Evans, 3 Jun\r\n                   73.]\r\n\r\nThe Advisory Committee's first campaign was directed at local commanders.\r\nAfter a long review of the evidence, the committee was convinced that\r\nthe major cause of racial disorder was the failure of commanders in\r\nsome echelons to appreciate the seriousness of racial unrest and their\r\nown responsibility for dealing with the discipline, morale, and    (p. 042)\r\nwelfare of their men. Since it found that most disturbances began with\r\nreal or fancied incidents of discrimination, the committee concluded\r\nthat there should be no discrimination against Negroes in the matter\r\nof privileges and accommodations and none in favor of Negroes that\r\ncompromised disciplinary standards. The committee wanted local\r\ncommanders to be reminded that maintaining proper discipline and good\r\norder among soldiers, and between soldiers and civilians, was a\r\ndefinite command responsibility.[2-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-68: Memo, Chmn, Advisory Cmte, for CofS,\r\n                   3 Jul 43, sub: Negro Troops, ASW 291.2 NT. This was\r\n                   not sent until 6 July.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Marshall incorporated the committee's recommendations in a\r\nletter to the field. He concluded by saying that \"failure on the part\r\nof any commander to concern himself personally and vigorously with\r\nthis problem will be considered as evidence of lack of capacity and\r\ncause for reclassification and removal from assignment.\"[2-69] At the\r\nsame time, the Chief of Staff did not adopt several of the committee's\r\nspecific recommendations. He did not require local commanders to\r\nrecommend changes in War Department policy on the treatment of Negroes\r\nand the organization and employment of black units. Nor did he require\r\nthem to report on steps taken by them to follow the committee's\r\nrecommendations. Moreover, he did not order the dispatch of black\r\ncombat units to active theaters although the committee had pointed to\r\nthis course as \"the most effective means of reducing tension among\r\nNegro troops.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-69: Memo, CofS for CG, AAF, et al., 13\r\n                   Jul 43, sub: Negro Troops, WDCSA 291.21.]\r\n\r\nNext, the Advisory Committee turned its attention to the black press.\r\nJudge Hastie and the representatives of the senior civil rights\r\norganizations were judicious in their criticism and accurate in their\r\ncharges, but this statement could not be made for much of the black\r\npress. Along with deserving credit for spotlighting racial injustices\r\nand giving a very real impetus to racial progress, a segment of the\r\nblack press had to share the blame for fomenting racial disorder by\r\nthe frequent publication of inaccurate and inflammatory war stories.\r\nSome field commanders charged that the constant criticism was\r\ndetrimental to troop morale and demanded that the War Department\r\ninvestigate and even censor particular black newspapers. In July 1943\r\nthe Army Service Forces recommended that General Marshall officially\r\nwarn the editors against printing inciting and untrue stories and\r\nsuggested that if this caution failed sedition proceedings be\r\ninstituted against the culprits.[2-70] General Marshall followed a more\r\nmoderate course suggested by Assistant Secretary McCloy.[2-71] The Army\r\nstaff amplified and improved the services of the Bureau of Public\r\nRelations by appointing Negroes to the bureau and by releasing more\r\nnews items of special interest to black journalists. The result was a\r\nconsiderable increase in constructive and accurate stories on      (p. 043)\r\nblack participation in the war, although articles and editorials\r\ncontinued to be severely critical of the Army's segregation policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-70: Memo, Advisory Cmte for CofS, 16 Mar\r\n                   43, sub: Inflammatory Publications, ASW 291.2 NT\r\n                   Cmte; Memo, CG, 4th Service Cmd, ASF, to CG, ASF,\r\n                   12 Jul 43, sub: Disturbances Among Negro Troops,\r\n                   with attached note initialed by Gen Marshall, WDCSA\r\n                   291.2 (12 Jul 43).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-71: Memo, J.

Elaborating on the committee's\r\nrecommendation, Chairman McCloy added:\r\n\r\n     There has been a tendency to allow the situation to develop where\r\n     selections are made on the basis of efficiency with the result\r\n     that the colored units are discarded for combat service, but\r\n     little is done by way of studying new means to put them in shape\r\n     for combat service.\r\n\r\n     With so large a portion of our population colored, with the\r\n     example of the effective use of colored troops (of a much lower\r\n     order of intelligence) by other nations, and with the many\r\n     imponderables that are connected with the situation, we must, I\r\n     think, be more affirmative about the use of our Negro troops. If\r\n     present methods do not bring them to combat efficiency, we should\r\n     change those methods. That is what this resolution purports to\r\n     recommend.[2-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-72: Min of Mtg of Advisory Cmte on Negro\r\n                   Troop Policies, 29 Feb 44, ASW 291.2 Negro Troops\r\n                   Cmte; Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, pp.\r\n                   449-50.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-73: Memo, ASW for SW, 2 Mar 44, inclosing\r\n                   formal recommendations, WDCSA 291.2/13 Negroes\r\n                   (1944).]\r\n\r\nStimson agreed, and on 4 March 1944 the Advisory Committee met with\r\nmembers of the Army staff to decide on combat assignments for\r\nregimental combat teams from the 92d and 93d Divisions. In order that\r\nboth handpicked soldiers and normal units might be tested, the team\r\nfrom the 93d would come from existing units of that division, and the\r\none from the 92d would be a specially selected group of volunteers.\r\nGeneral Marshall and his associates continued to view the commitment\r\nof black combat troops as an experiment that might provide\r\ndocumentation for the future employment of Negroes in combat.[2-74] In\r\nkeeping with this experiment, the Army staff suggested to field\r\ncommanders how Negroes might be employed and requested continuing\r\nreports on the units' progress.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-74: Pogue, _Organizer of Victory_, p.\r\n                   99.]\r\n\r\nThe belated introduction of major black units into combat helped\r\nalleviate the Army's racial problems. After elements of the 93d\r\nDivision were committed on Bougainville in March 1944 and an advanced\r\ngroup of the 92d landed in Italy in July, the Army staff found it\r\neasier to ship smaller supporting units to combat theaters, either as\r\nseparate units or as support for larger units, a course that reduced\r\nthe glut of black soldiers stationed in the United States. Recognizing\r\nthat many of these units had poor leaders, Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair,\r\nhead of the Army Ground Forces, ordered that, \"if practicable,\" all\r\nleaders of black units who had not received \"excellent\" or higher  (p. 044)\r\nin their efficiency ratings would be replaced before the units were\r\nscheduled for overseas deployment.[2-75] Given the \"if practicable\"\r\nloophole, there was little chance that all the units would go overseas\r\nwith \"excellent\" commanders.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-75: Memo, CG, AGF, for CG's, Second Army,\r\n                   et al., n.d., sub: Efficiency Ratings of Commanders\r\n                   of Negro Units Scheduled for Overseas Shipment,\r\n                   GNGAP-L 201.61/9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 93D DIVISION TROOPS IN BOUGAINVILLE, APRIL 1944. _Men,\r\npacking mortar shells, cross the West Branch Texas River._]\r\n\r\nA source of pride to the black community, the troop commitments also\r\nhelped to reduce national racial tensions, but they did little for the\r\naverage black soldier who remained stationed in the United States. He\r\ncontinued to suffer discrimination within and without the gates of the\r\ncamp. The committee attributed that discrimination to the fact that\r\nWar Department policy was not being carried out in all commands. In\r\nsome instances local commanders were unaware of the policy; in others\r\nthey refused to pay sufficient attention to the seriousness of what\r\nwas, after all, but one of many problems facing them. For some time\r\ncommittee members had been urging the War Department to write special\r\ninstructions, and finally in February 1944 the department issued a\r\npamphlet designed to acquaint local commanders with an official\r\ndefinition of Army racial policy and to improve methods of developing\r\nleaders in black units. _Command of Negro Troops_ was a landmark   (p. 045)\r\npublication.[2-76] Its frank statement of the Army's racial problems,\r\nits scholarly and objective discussion of the disadvantages that\r\nburdened the black soldier, and its outline of black rights and\r\nresponsibilities clearly revealed the committee's intention to foster\r\nracial harmony by promoting greater command responsibility. The\r\npamphlet represented a major departure from previous practice and\r\nserved as a model for later Army and Navy statements on race.[2-77]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-76: WD PAM 20-6, _Command of Negro\r\n                   Troops_, 29 Feb 44.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-77: The Army Service Forces published a\r\n                   major supplement to War Department Pamphlet 20-6 in\r\n                   October 1944, see Army Service Forces Manual M-5,\r\n                   _Leadership and the Negro Soldier_.]\r\n\r\nBut pamphlets alone would not put an end to racial discrimination; the\r\ncommittee had to go beyond its role of instructor. Although the War\r\nDepartment had issued a directive on 10 March 1943 forbidding the\r\nassignment of any recreational facility, \"including theaters and post\r\nexchanges,\" by race and requiring the removal of signs labeling\r\nfacilities for \"white\" and \"colored\" soldiers, there had been little\r\nalteration in the recreational situation. The directive had allowed\r\nthe separate use of existing facilities by designated units and camp\r\nareas, so that in many places segregation by unit had replaced\r\nseparation by race, and inspectors and commanders reported that\r\nconsiderable confusion existed over the War Department's intentions.\r\nOn other posts the order to remove the racial labels from facilities\r\nwas simply disregarded. On 8 July 1944 the committee persuaded the War\r\nDepartment to issue another directive clearly informing commanders\r\nthat facilities could be allocated to specific areas or units, but\r\nthat all post exchanges and theaters must be opened to all soldiers\r\nregardless of race. All government transportation, moreover, was to be\r\navailable to all troops regardless of race. Nor could soldiers be\r\nrestricted to certain sections of government vehicles on or off base,\r\nregardless of local customs.[2-78]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-78: Ltr, TAG to CG, AAF, et al., 8 Jul\r\n                   44, sub: Recreational Facilities, AG 353.8 (5 Jul\r\n                   44) OB-S-A-M.]\r\n\r\nLittle dramatic change ensued in day-to-day life on base. Some\r\ncommanders, emphasizing that part of the directive which allowed the\r\ndesignation of facilities for units and areas, limited the degree of\r\nthe directive's application to post exchanges and theaters and ignored\r\nthose provisions concerned with individual rights. This interpretation\r\nonly added to the racial unrest that culminated in several incidents,\r\nof which the one at the officers' club at Freeman Field, Indiana, was\r\nthe most widely publicized.[2-79] After this incident the committee\r\npromptly asked for a revision of WD Pamphlet 20-6 on the command of\r\nblack troops that would clearly spell out the intention of the authors\r\nof the directive to apply its integration provisions explicitly to\r\n\"officers' clubs, messes, or similar social organizations.\"[2-80] In\r\neffect the War Department was declaring that racial separation applied\r\nto units only. For the first time it made a clear distinction      (p. 046)\r\nbetween Army race policy to be applied on federal military reservations\r\nand local civilian laws and customs to be observed by members of the\r\narmed forces when off post. In Acting Secretary Patterson's words:\r\n\r\n     The War Department has maintained throughout the emergency and\r\n     present war that it is not an appropriate medium for effecting\r\n     social readjustments but has insisted that all soldiers,\r\n     regardless of race, be afforded equal opportunity to enjoy the\r\n     recreational facilities which are provided at posts, camps and\r\n     stations. The thought has been that men who are fulfilling the\r\n     same obligation, suffering the same dislocation of their private\r\n     lives, and wearing the identical uniform should, within the\r\n     confines of the military establishment, have the same privileges\r\n     for rest and relaxation.[2-81]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-79: Actually, the use of officers' clubs\r\n                   by black troops was clearly implied if not ordained\r\n                   in paragraph 19 of Army Regulation 210-10, 20\r\n                   December 1940, which stated that any club operating\r\n                   on federal property must be open to all officers\r\n                   assigned to the post, camp, or station.

In 1917 Secretary of\r\nWar Newton D. Baker had established a separate training school for (p. 047)\r\nblack officer candidates at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, with disappointing\r\nresults. To fill its quotas the school had been forced to lower its\r\nentrance standards, and each month an arbitrary number of black\r\nofficer candidates were selected and graduated with little regard for\r\ntheir qualifications. Many World War I commanders agreed that the\r\nblack officers produced by the school proved inadequate as troop\r\ncommanders, and postwar staff studies generally opposed the future use\r\nof black officers. Should the Army be forced to accept black officers\r\nin the future, these commanders generally agreed, they should be\r\ntrained along with whites.[2-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-85: Ltr, William Hastie to Lee Nichols,\r\n                   15 Jul 53, in Nichols Collection, CMH; see also\r\n                   Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_ pp. 15-20; Army\r\n                   War College Misc File 127-1 through 127-22, AMHRC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUN CREW OF BATTERY B, 598TH FIELD ARTILLERY, _moving\r\ninto position near the Arno River, Italy, September 1944_.]\r\n\r\nDespite these criticisms, mobilization plans between the wars all\r\nassumed that black officers would be trained and commissioned,\r\nalthough, as the 1937 mobilization plan put it, their numbers would be\r\nlimited to those required to provide officers for organizations\r\nauthorized to have black officers.[2-86] No detailed plans were drawn up\r\non the nature of this training, but by the eve of World War II a\r\npolicy had become fixed: Negroes were to be chosen and trained\r\naccording to the same standards as white officers, preferably in the\r\nsame schools.[2-87] The War Department ignored the subject of race (p. 048)\r\nwhen it established the officer candidate schools in 1941. \"The basic\r\nand predominating consideration governing selections to OCS,\" The\r\nAdjutant General announced, would be \"outstanding qualities of\r\nleadership as demonstrated by actual services in the Army.\"[2-88]\r\nGeneral Davis, who participated in the planning conferences, reasoned\r\nthat integrated training would be vital for the cooperation that would\r\nbe necessary in battle.

As one Army\r\nspokesman put it, \"our objection to separate schools is based      (p. 051)\r\nprimarily on the fact that black officer candidates are eligible\r\nfrom every branch of the Army, including the Armored Force and tank\r\ndestroyer battalions, and it would be decidedly uneconomical to\r\nattempt to gather in one school the materiel and instructor personnel\r\nnecessary to give training in all these branches.\"[2-97]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-97: Ltr, SGS to Sen.

Many blacks and whites lived together with a minimum of\r\nfriction, and, except in flight school, all candidates trained\r\ntogether.[2-98] Yet in some schools the number of black officer\r\ncandidates made racially separate rooms feasible, and Negroes were\r\nusually billeted and messed together. In other instances Army\r\norganizations were slow to integrate their officer training. The\r\nWomen's Army Auxiliary Corps, for example, segregated black candidates\r\nuntil late 1942 when Judge Hastie brought the matter to McCloy's\r\nattention.[2-99] Nevertheless, the Army's experiment was far more\r\nimportant than its immediate results indicated. It proved that even in\r\nthe face of considerable opposition the Army was willing to abandon\r\nits segregation policy when the issues of economy and efficiency were\r\nmade sufficiently clear and compelling.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-98: Dollard and Young, \"In the Armed\r\n                   Forces.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-99: Memos, Hastie for ASW, 4 Nov 42 and\r\n                   15 Dec 42; Ltr, Maj Gen A.

Gen. John C. H. Lee's\r\nCommunications Zone and train them as infantrymen. These plans left\r\nthe large reservoir of black manpower in the theater untapped until\r\nGeneral Lee suggested that General Dwight D. Eisenhower permit black\r\nservice troops to volunteer for infantry training and eventual\r\nemployment as individual replacements. General Eisenhower agreed, and\r\non 26 December Lee issued a call to the black troops for volunteers to\r\nshare \"the privilege of joining our veteran units at the front to\r\ndeliver the knockout blow.\" The call was limited to privates in the\r\nupper four categories of the Army General Classification Test who had\r\nhad some infantry training. If noncommissioned officers wanted to\r\napply, they had to accept a reduction in grade. Although patronizing\r\nin tone, the plan was a bold departure from War Department policy: \"It\r\nis planned to assign you without regard to color or race to the units\r\nwhere assistance is most needed, and give you the opportunity of\r\nfighting shoulder to shoulder to bring about victory.... Your\r\nrelatives and friends everywhere have been urging that you be granted\r\nthis privilege.\"[2-101]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-100: For a detailed discussion, see Lee,\r\n                   _Employment of Negro Troops_, Chapter XXII.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-101: Ltr, Lt Gen John C. H.

Arguing that the\r\ncircular promising integrated service would embarrass the Army, Lt.\r\nGen. Walter Bedell Smith, the chief of staff, recommended that General\r\nEisenhower warn the War Department that civil rights spokesmen might\r\nseize on this example to demand wider integration. To avoid future\r\nmoves that might compromise Army policy, Smith wanted permission to\r\nreview any Communications Zone statements on Negroes before they were\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nGeneral Eisenhower compromised. Washington was not consulted, and\r\nEisenhower himself revised the circular, eliminating the special call\r\nfor black volunteers and the promise of integration on an individual\r\nbasis. He substituted instead a general appeal for volunteers, adding\r\nthe further qualification that \"in the event that the number of\r\nsuitable negro volunteers exceeds the replacement needs of negro\r\ncombat units, these men will be suitably incorporated in other\r\norganizations so that their service and their fighting spirit may be\r\nefficiently utilized.\"[2-102] This statement was disseminated throughout\r\nthe European theater.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-102: Revised version of above, same date.\r\n                   Copies of both versions in CMH. Later General\r\n                   Eisenhower stated that he had decided to employ the\r\n                   men \"as individuals,\" but the evidence is clear\r\n                   that he meant platoons in 1944, see Ltr, D.D.E. to\r\n                   Gen Bruce C. Clarke, 29 May 63, in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe Eisenhower revision needed considerable clarification. It\r\nmentioned the replacement needs of black combat units, but there were\r\nno black infantry units in the theater;[2-103] and the replacement\r\ncommand was not equipped to retrain men for artillery, tank, and tank\r\ndestroyer units, the types of combat units that did employ Negroes in\r\nEurope. The revision also called for volunteers in excess of these\r\nneeds to be \"suitably incorporated in other organizations,\" but it did\r\nnot indicate how they would be organized. Eisenhower later made it\r\nclear that he preferred to organize the volunteers in groups that\r\ncould replace white units in the line, but again the replacement\r\ncommand was geared to train individual, not unit, replacements. After\r\nconsiderable discussion and compromise, Eisenhower agreed to have\r\nNegroes trained \"as members of Infantry rifle platoons familiar with\r\nthe Infantry rifle platoon weapons.\" The platoons would be sent for\r\nassignment to Army commanders who would provide them with platoon\r\nleaders, platoon sergeants, and, if needed, squad leaders.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-103: The 92d Division was assigned to the\r\n                   Mediterranean theater.]\r\n\r\nUnaware of how close they had come to being integrated as individuals,\r\nso many Negroes volunteered for combat training and duty that the\r\noperations of some service units were threatened. To prevent\r\ndisrupting these vital operations, the theater limited the number to\r\n2,500, turning down about 3,000 men. Early in January 1945 the\r\nvolunteers assembled for six weeks of standard infantry conversion\r\ntraining. After training, the new black infantrymen were organized\r\ninto fifty-three platoons, each under a white platoon leader and\r\nsergeant, and were dispatched to the field, two to work with armored\r\ndivisions and the rest with infantry divisions. Sixteen were shipped\r\nto the 6th Army Group, the rest to the 12th Army Group, and all    (p. 053)\r\nsaw action with a total of eleven divisions in the First and Seventh\r\nArmies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOLUNTEERS FOR COMBAT IN TRAINING, _47th Reinforcement\r\nDepot, February 1945_.]\r\n\r\nIn the First Army the black platoons were usually assigned on the\r\nbasis of three to a division, and the division receiving them normally\r\nplaced one platoon in each regiment. At the company level, the black\r\nplatoon generally served to augment the standard organization of three\r\nrifle platoons and one heavy weapons platoon. In the Seventh Army, the\r\nplatoons were organized into provisional companies and attached to\r\ninfantry battalions in armored divisions. General Davis warned the\r\nSeventh Army commander, Lt. Gen. Alexander M. Patch, that the men had\r\nnot been trained for employment as company units and were not being\r\nproperly used. The performance of the provisional companies failed to\r\nmatch the performance of the platoons integrated into white companies\r\nand their morale was lower.[2-104] At the end of the war the theater\r\nmade clear to the black volunteers that integration was over. Although\r\na large group was sent to the 69th Infantry Division to be returned\r\nhome, most were reassigned to black combat or service units in the\r\noccupation army.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-104: Davis, \"History of a Special Section\r\n                   Office of the Inspector General,\" p. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe experiment with integration of platoons was carefully scrutinized.\r\nIn May and June 1945, the Research Branch of the Information and\r\nEducation Division of Eisenhower's theater headquarters made a     (p. 054)\r\nsurvey solely to discover what white company-grade officers and\r\nplatoon sergeants thought of the combat performance of the black rifle\r\nplatoons. Trained interviewers visited seven infantry divisions and\r\nasked the same question of 250 men--all the available company officers\r\nand a representative sample of platoon sergeants in twenty-four\r\ncompanies that had had black platoons. In addition, a questionnaire,\r\nnot to be signed, was submitted to approximately 1,700 white enlisted\r\nmen in other field forces for the purpose of discovering what their\r\nattitudes were toward the use of black riflemen. No Negro was asked\r\nhis opinion.\r\n\r\nMore than 80 percent of the white officers and noncommissioned\r\nofficers who were interviewed reported that the Negroes had performed\r\n\"very well\" in combat; 69 percent of the officers and 83 percent of\r\nthe noncommissioned officers saw no reason why black infantrymen\r\nshould not perform as well as white infantrymen if both had the same\r\ntraining and experience. Most reported getting along \"very well\" with\r\nthe black volunteers; the heavier the combat shared, the closer and\r\nbetter the relationships. Nearly all the officers questioned admitted\r\nthat the camaraderie between white and black troops was far better\r\nthan they had expected. Most enlisted men reported that they had at\r\nfirst disliked and even been apprehensive at the prospect of having\r\nblack troops in their companies, but three-quarters of them had\r\nchanged their minds after serving with Negroes in combat, their\r\ndistrust turning into respect and friendliness. Of the officers and\r\nnoncommissioned officers, 77 percent had more favorable feelings\r\ntoward Negroes after serving in close proximity to them, the others\r\nreported no change in attitude; not a single individual stated that he\r\nhad developed a less favorable attitude. A majority of officers\r\napproved the idea of organizing Negroes in platoons to serve in white\r\ncompanies; the practice, they said, would stimulate the spirit of\r\ncompetition between races, avoid friction with prejudiced whites,\r\neliminate discrimination, and promote interracial understanding.\r\nFamiliarity with Negroes dispersed fear of the unknown and bred\r\nrespect for them among white troops; only those lacking experience\r\nwith black soldiers were inclined to be suspicious and hostile.[2-105]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-105: ETO I&E Div Rpt E-118 Research Br,\r\n                   The Utilization of Negro Infantry Platoons in White\r\n                   Companies, Jun 45; ASF I&E Div Rpt B-157, Opinions\r\n                   About Negro Infantry Platoons in White Companies of\r\n                   Seven Divisions, 3 Jul 45.

Somervell, commanding general of the Army Service\r\nForces, questioned the advisability of releasing the report. An\r\nexperiment involving 1,000 volunteers--his figure was inaccurate,\r\nactually 2,500 were involved--was hardly, he believed, a conclusive\r\ntest. Furthermore, organizations such as the NAACP might be encouraged\r\nto exert pressure for similar experiments among troops in training in\r\nthe United States and even in the midst of active operations in the\r\nPacific theater--pressure, he believed, that might hamper training and\r\noperations. What mainly concerned Somervell were the political\r\nimplications. Many members of Congress, newspaper editors, and others\r\nwho had given strong support to the War Department were, he contended,\r\n\"vigorously opposed\" to integration under any conditions. A strong\r\nadverse reaction from this influential segment of the nation's     (p. 055)\r\nopinion-makers might alienate public support for a postwar program of\r\nuniversal military training.[2-106]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-106: Memo, CG, ASF, to ASW, 11 Jul 45,\r\n                   ASW 291.2 NT.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Omar N. Bradley, the senior American field commander in\r\nEurope, took a different tack. Writing for the theater headquarters\r\nand drawing upon such sources of information as the personal\r\nobservations of some officers, General Bradley disparaged the\r\nsignificance of the experiment. Most of the black platoons, he\r\nobserved, had participated mainly in mopping-up operations or combat\r\nagainst a disorganized enemy. Nor could the soldiers involved in the\r\nexperiment be considered typical, in Bradley's opinion. They were\r\nvolunteers of above average intelligence according to their\r\ncommanders.[2-107] Finally, Bradley contended that, while no racial\r\ntrouble emerged during combat, the mutual friendship fostered by\r\nfighting a common enemy was threatened when the two races were closely\r\nassociated in rest and recreational areas. Nevertheless, he agreed\r\nthat the performance of the platoons was satisfactory enough to\r\nwarrant continuing the experiment but recommended the use of draftees\r\nwith average qualifications. At the same time, he drew away from\r\nfurther integration by suggesting that the experiment be expanded to\r\ninclude employment of entire black rifle companies in white regiments\r\nto avoid some of the social difficulties encountered in rest\r\nareas.[2-108]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-107: The percentage of high school\r\n                   graduates and men scoring in AGCT categories I, II,\r\n                   and III among the black infantry volunteers was\r\n                   somewhat higher than that of all Negroes in the\r\n                   European theater. As against 22 percent high school\r\n                   graduates and 29 percent in the first three test\r\n                   score categories for the volunteers, the\r\n                   percentages for all Negroes in the theater were 18\r\n                   and 17 percent. At the same time the averages for\r\n                   black volunteers were considerably below those for\r\n                   white riflemen, of whom 41 percent were high school\r\n                   graduates and 71 percent in the higher test\r\n                   categories--figures that tend to refute the\r\n                   general's argument.

Both in AG 291.2 (1945).]\r\n\r\nGeneral Marshall, the Chief of Staff, agreed with both Somervell and\r\nBradley. Although he thought that the possibility of integrating black\r\nunits into white units should be \"followed up,\" he believed that the\r\nsurvey should not be made public because \"the conditions under which\r\nthe [black] platoons were organized and employed were most\r\nunusual.\"[2-109] Too many of the circumstances of the experiment were\r\nspecial--the voluntary recruitment of men for frontline duty, the\r\nrelatively high number of noncommissioned officers among the\r\nvolunteers, and the fact that the volunteers were slightly older and\r\nscored higher in achievement tests than the average black soldier.\r\nMoreover, throughout the experiment some degree of segregation, with\r\nall its attendant psychological and morale problems, had been\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-109: Memo, CofS for ASW, 25 Aug 45, WDCSA\r\n                   291.2 Negroes (25 Aug 45).]\r\n\r\nThe platoon experiment was illuminating in several respects. The fact\r\nthat so late in the war thousands of Negroes volunteered to trade the\r\nsafety of the rear for duty at the front said something about black\r\npatriotism and perhaps something about the Negro's passion for equality.\r\nIt also demonstrated that, when properly trained and motivated and (p. 056)\r\ntreated with fairness, blacks, like whites, performed with bravery and\r\ndistinction in combat. Finally, the experiment successfully attacked\r\none of the traditionalists' shibboleths, that close association of the\r\nraces in Army units would cause social dissension.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROAD REPAIRMEN, _Company A, 279th Engineer Battalion,\r\nnear Rimberg, Germany, December 1944_.]\r\n\r\nIt is now apparent that World War II had little immediate effect on\r\nthe quest for racial equality in the Army. The Double V campaign\r\nagainst fascism abroad and racism at home achieved considerably less\r\nthan the activists had hoped. Although Negroes shared in the\r\nprosperity brought by war industries and some 800,000 of them served\r\nin uniform, segregation remained the policy of the Army throughout the\r\nwar, just as Jim Crow still ruled in large areas of the country.\r\nProbably the campaign's most important achievement was that during the\r\nwar the civil rights groups, in organizing for the fight against\r\ndiscrimination, began to gather strength and develop techniques that\r\nwould be useful in the decades to come. The Army's experience with\r\nblack units also convinced many that segregation was a questionable\r\npolicy when the country needed to mobilize fully.\r\n\r\nFor its part the Army defended the separation of the races in the name\r\nof military efficiency and claimed that it had achieved a victory over\r\nracial discrimination by providing equal treatment and job opportunity\r\nfor black soldiers. But the Army's campaign had also been less than\r\ncompletely successful. True, the Army had provided specialist training\r\nand opened job opportunities heretofore denied to thousands of\r\nNegroes, and it had a cadre of potential leaders in the hundreds of\r\nexperienced black officers. For the times, the Army was a progressive\r\nminority employer. Even so, as an institution it had defended the\r\nseparate but equal doctrine and had failed to come to grips with\r\nsegregation. Under segregation the Army was compelled to combine large\r\nnumbers of undereducated and undertrained black soldiers in units that\r\nwere often inefficient and sometimes surplus to its needs. This system\r\nin turn robbed the Army of the full services of the educated and able\r\nblack soldier, who had every reason to feel restless and rebellious.\r\n\r\nThe Army received no end of advice on its manpower policy during the\r\nwar. Civil rights spokesmen continually pointed out that segregation\r\nitself was discriminatory, and Judge Hastie in particular hammered on\r\nthis proposition before the highest officials of the War           (p. 057)\r\nDepartment. In fact Hastie's recommendations, criticisms, and\r\narguments crystallized the demands of civil rights leaders. The Army\r\nsuccessfully resisted the proposition when its Advisory Committee on\r\nNegro Troop Policies under John McCloy modified but did not\r\nappreciably alter the segregation policy. It was a predictable course.\r\nThe Army's racial policy was more than a century old, and leaders\r\nconsidered it dangerous if not impossible to revise traditional ways\r\nduring a global war involving so many citizens with pronounced and\r\ndifferent views on race.\r\n\r\nWhat both the civil rights activists and the Army's leaders tended to\r\nignore during the war was that segregation was inefficient. The myriad\r\nproblems associated with segregated units, in contrast to the\r\nefficient operation of the integrated officer candidate schools and\r\nthe integrated infantry platoons in Europe, were overlooked in the\r\natmosphere of charges and denials concerning segregation and\r\ndiscrimination. John McCloy was an exception. He had clearly become\r\ndissatisfied with the inefficiency of the Army's policy, and in the\r\nweek following the Japanese surrender he questioned Navy Secretary\r\nJames V. Forrestal on the Navy's experiments with integration. \"It has\r\nalways seemed to me,\" he concluded, \"that we never put enough thought\r\ninto the matter of making a real military asset out of the very large\r\ncadre of Negro personnel we received from the country.\"[2-110] Although\r\nsegregation persisted, the fact that it hampered military efficiency\r\nwas the hope of those who looked for a change in the Army's policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 2-110: Ltr, ASW to SecNav, 22 Aug 45, ASW\r\n                   291.2 NT (Gen).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3                                                          (p. 058)\r\n\r\nWorld War II: The Navy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period between the world wars marked the nadir of the Navy's\r\nrelations with black America. Although the exclusion of Negroes that\r\nbegan with a clause introduced in enlistment regulations in 1922\r\nlasted but a decade, black participation in the Navy remained severely\r\nrestricted during the rest of the inter-war period. In June 1940 the\r\nNavy had 4,007 black personnel, 2.3 percent of its nearly 170,000-man\r\ntotal.[3-1] All were enlisted men, and with the exception of six regular\r\nrated seamen, lone survivors of the exclusion clause, all were\r\nsteward's mates, labeled by the black press \"seagoing bellhops.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-1: All statistics in this chapter are\r\n                   taken from the files of the U.S. Navy, Bureau of\r\n                   Naval Personnel (hereafter cited as BuPers).]\r\n\r\nThe Steward's Branch, composed entirely of enlisted Negroes and\r\noriental aliens, mostly Filipinos, was organized outside the Navy's\r\ngeneral service. Its members carried ratings up to chief petty\r\nofficer, but wore distinctive uniforms and insignia, and even chief\r\nstewards never exercised authority over men rated in the general naval\r\nservice. Stewards manned the officers' mess and maintained the\r\nofficers' billets on board ship, and, in some instances, took care of\r\nthe quarters of high officials in the shore establishment. Some were\r\nalso engaged in mess management, menu planning, and the purchase of\r\nsupplies. Despite the fact that their enlistment contracts restricted\r\ntheir training and duties, stewards, like everyone else aboard ship,\r\nwere assigned battle stations, including positions at the guns and on\r\nthe bridge. One of these stewards, Dorie (Doris) Miller, became a hero\r\non the first day of the war when he manned a machine gun on the\r\nburning deck of the USS _Arizona_ and destroyed two enemy planes.[3-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-2: After some delay and considerable\r\n                   pressure from civil rights sources, the Navy\r\n                   identified Miller, awarded him the Navy Cross, and\r\n                   promoted him to mess attendant, first class. Miller\r\n                   was later lost at sea. See Dennis D. Nelson, _The\r\n                   Integration of the Negro Into the U.S. Navy_ (New\r\n                   York: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1951), pp. 23-25.\r\n                   The Navy further honored Miller in 1973 by naming a\r\n                   destroyer escort (DE 1091) after him.]\r\n\r\nBy the end of December 1941 the number of Negroes in the Navy had\r\nincreased by slightly more than a thousand men to 5,026, or 2.4\r\npercent of the whole, but they continued to be excluded from all\r\npositions except that of steward.[3-3] It was not surprising that civil\r\nrights organizations and their supporters in Congress demanded a\r\nchange in policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-3: There were exceptions to this\r\n                   generalization.

Together with Secretary of War\r\nStimson, Knox had joined the cabinet in July 1940 when Roosevelt was\r\nattempting to defuse a foreign policy debate that threatened to\r\nexplode during the presidential campaign.[3-4] For a major cabinet\r\nofficer, Knox's powers were severely circumscribed. He had little\r\nknowledge of naval affairs, and the President, himself once an\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy, often went over his head to deal\r\ndirectly with the naval bureaus on shipbuilding programs and manpower\r\nproblems as well as the disposition of the fleet. But Knox was a\r\npersonable man and a forceful speaker, and he was particularly useful\r\nto the President in congressional liaison and public relations.\r\nRoosevelt preferred to work through the secretary in dealing with the\r\ndelicate question of black participation in the Navy. Knox himself was\r\nfortunate in his immediate official family. James V. Forrestal became\r\nunder secretary in August 1940; during the next year Ralph A. Bard, a\r\nChicago investment banker, joined the department as assistant\r\nsecretary, and Adlai E. Stevenson became special assistant.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-4: One of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough\r\n                   Riders, a World War I field artillery officer, and\r\n                   later publisher of the Chicago _Daily News_, Knox\r\n                   was an implacable foe of the New Deal but an ardent\r\n                   internationalist, strongly sympathetic to President\r\n                   Roosevelt's foreign policy.]\r\n\r\nAble as these men were, Frank Knox, like most new secretaries\r\nunfamiliar with the operations and traditions of the vast department,\r\nwas from the beginning heavily dependent on his naval advisers. These\r\nwere the chiefs of the powerful bureaus and the prominent senior\r\nadmirals of the General Board, the Navy's highest advisory body.[3-5]\r\nGenerally these men were ardent military traditionalists, and, despite\r\nthe progressive attitude of the secretary's highest civilian advisers,\r\nchanges in the racial policy of the Navy were to be glacially slow.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-5: In 1940 the bureaus were answerable\r\n                   only to the Secretary of the Navy and the\r\n                   President, but after a reorganization of 1942 they\r\n                   began to lose some of their independence. In March\r\n                   1942 President Roosevelt merged the offices of the\r\n                   Chief of Naval Operations and Commander in Chief,\r\n                   U.S. Fleet, giving Admiral Ernest J. King, who held\r\n                   both titles, at least some direction over most of\r\n                   the bureaus. Eventually the Chief of Naval\r\n                   Operations would become a figure with powers\r\n                   comparable to those exercised by the Army's Chief\r\n                   of Staff. See Julius A. Furer, _Administration of\r\n                   the Navy Department in World War II_ (Washington:\r\n                   Government Printing Office, 1959), pp. 113-14. This\r\n                   shift in power was readily apparent in the case of\r\n                   the administration of the Navy's racial policy.]\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Navigation, which was charged with primary\r\nresponsibility for all personnel matters, was opposed to change in the\r\nracial composition of the Navy. Less than two weeks after Knox's\r\nappointment, it prepared for his signature a letter to Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Charles Poletti of New York defending the Navy's policy. The\r\nbureau reasoned that since segregation was impractical, exclusion was\r\nnecessary. Experience had proved, the bureau claimed, that when given\r\nsupervisory responsibility the Negro was unable to maintain discipline\r\namong white subordinates with the result that teamwork, harmony, and\r\nship's efficiency suffered. The Negro, therefore, had to be segregated\r\nfrom the white sailor. All-black units were impossible, the bureau\r\nargued, because the service's training and distribution system     (p. 060)\r\ndemanded that a man in any particular rating be available for any duty\r\nrequired of that rating in any ship or activity in the Navy. The Navy\r\nhad experimented with segregated crews after World War I, manning one\r\nship with an all-Filipino crew and another with an all-Samoan crew,\r\nbut the bureau was not satisfied with the result and reasoned that\r\nships with black crews would be no more satisfactory.[3-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-6: Ltr, SecNav to Lt. Gov.

He was convinced that \"it is no kindness to Negroes to\r\nthrust them upon men of the white race,\" and he suggested that the\r\nNegro might make his major contribution to the armed forces in the\r\nArmy's black regimental organizations.[3-7] Confronted with widespread\r\ncriticism of this policy, however, Knox asked the Navy's General Board\r\nin September 1940 to give him \"some reasons why colored persons should\r\nnot be enlisted for general service.\"[3-8] He accepted the board's\r\nreasons for continued exclusion of Negroes--generally an extension of\r\nthe ones advanced in the Poletti letter--and during the next eighteen\r\nmonths these reasons, endorsed by the Chief of Naval Operations and\r\nthe Bureau of Navigation, were used as the department's standard\r\nanswer to questions on race.[3-9] They were used at the White House\r\nconference on 18 June 1941 when, in the presence of black leaders,\r\nKnox told President Roosevelt that the Navy could do nothing about\r\ntaking Negroes into the general service \"because men live in such\r\nintimacy aboard ship that we simply can't enlist Negroes above the\r\nrank of messman.\"[3-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-7: Idem to Sen.

Whatever his personal feelings, Roosevelt agreed\r\nwith Knox that integration of the Navy was an impractical step in  (p. 061)\r\nwartime, but where Knox saw exclusion from general service as the\r\nalternative to integration Roosevelt sought a compromise. He suggested\r\nthat the Navy \"make a beginning\" by putting some \"good Negro bands\"\r\naboard battleships. Under such intimate living conditions white and\r\nblack would learn to know and respect each other, and \"then we can\r\nmove on from there.\"[3-11] In effect the President was trying to lead\r\nthe Navy toward a policy similar to that announced by the Army in\r\n1940. While his suggestion about musicians was ignored by Secretary\r\nKnox, the search for a middle way between exclusion and integration\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-11: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL KING AND SECRETARY KNOX _on the USS Augusta_.]\r\n\r\nThe general public knew nothing of this search, and in the heightened\r\natmosphere of early war days, charged with unending propaganda about\r\nthe four freedoms and the forces of democracy against fascism, the\r\nadministration's racial attitudes were being questioned daily by civil\r\nrights spokesmen and by some Democratic politicians.[3-12] As protest\r\nagainst the Navy's racial policy mounted, Secretary Knox turned once\r\nagain to his staff for reassurance. In July 1941 he appointed a\r\ncommittee consisting of Navy and Marine Corps personnel officers and\r\nincluding Addison Walker, a special assistant to Assistant Secretary\r\nBard, to conduct a general investigation of that policy. The committee\r\ntook six months to complete its study and submitted both a majority\r\nand minority report.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-12: Memo, W. A. Allen, Office of Public\r\n                   Relations, for Lt Cmdr Smith, BuPers, 29 Jan 42,\r\n                   BuPers QN/P-14, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nThe majority report marshaled a long list of arguments to prove that\r\nexclusion of the Negro was not discriminatory, but \"a means of\r\npromoting efficiency, dependability, and flexibility of the Navy as a\r\nwhole.\" It concluded that no change in policy was necessary since\r\n\"within the limitations of the characteristics of members of certain\r\nraces, the enlisted personnel of the Naval Establishment is\r\nrepresentative of all the citizens of the United States.\"[3-13] The\r\nmajority invoked past experience, efficiency, and patriotism to\r\nsupport the _status quo_, but its chorus of reasons for excluding\r\nNegroes sounded incongruous amid the patriotic din and call to colors\r\nthat followed Pearl Harbor.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-13: Ltr, Chief, BuNav, to Chmn, Gen Bd,\r\n                   22 Jan 42, sub: Enlistment of Men of Colored Race\r\n                   in Other Than Messman Branch, Recs of Gen Bd,\r\n                   OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREW MEMBERS OF USS ARGONAUT _relax and read mail,\r\nPearl Harbor, 1942_.]\r\n\r\nDemonstrating changing social attitudes and also reflecting the    (p. 062)\r\ncompromise solution suggested by the President in June, Addison\r\nWalker's minority report recommended that a limited number of Negroes\r\nbe enlisted for general duty \"on some type of patrol or other small\r\nvessel assigned to a particular yard or station.\" While the\r\nenlistments could frankly be labeled experiments, Walker argued that\r\nsuch a step would mute black criticism by promoting Negroes out of the\r\nservant class. The program would also provide valuable data in case\r\nthe Navy was later directed to accept Negroes through Selective\r\nService. Reasoning that a man's right to fight for his country was\r\nprobably more fundamental than his right to vote, Walker insisted that\r\nthe drive for the rights and privileges of black citizens was a social\r\nforce that could not be ignored by the Navy. Indeed, he added, \"the\r\nreconciliation of social friction within our own country\" should be a\r\nspecial concern of the armed forces in wartime.[3-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-14: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the committee's majority won the day, its arguments were\r\novertaken by events that followed Pearl Harbor. The NAACP, viewing the\r\nNavy's rejection of black volunteers in the midst of the intensive\r\nrecruiting campaign, again took the issue to the White House. The\r\nPresident, in turn, asked the Fair Employment Practices Committee to\r\nconsider the case.[3-15] Committee chairman Mark Ethridge conferred with\r\nAssistant Secretary Bard, pointing out that since Negroes had been\r\neligible for general duty in World War I, the Navy had actually taken\r\na step backward when it restricted them to the Messman's Branch. The\r\ncommittee was even willing to pay the price of segregation to insure\r\nthe Negro's return to general duty. Ethridge recommended that the Navy\r\namend its policy and accept Negroes for use at Caribbean stations or\r\non harbor craft.[3-16] Criticism of Navy policy, hitherto emanating\r\nalmost exclusively from the civil rights organizations and a few   (p. 063)\r\ncongressmen, now broadened to include another government agency. As\r\nPresident Roosevelt no doubt expected, the Fair Employment Practices\r\nCommittee had come out in support of his compromise solution for the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-15: The FEPC was established 25 June 1941\r\n                   to carry out Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802\r\n                   against discrimination in employment in defense\r\n                   industries and in the federal government.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-16: \"BuPers Hist,\" pp. 4-5; Ltr, Mark\r\n                   Ethridge to Lee Nichols. 14 Jul 53, in Nichols\r\n                   Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\nBut the committee had no jurisdiction over the armed services, and\r\nSecretary Knox continued to assert that with a war to win he could not\r\nrisk \"crews that are impaired in efficiency because of racial\r\nprejudice.\" He admitted to his friend, conservationist Gifford\r\nPinchot, that the problem would have to be faced someday, but not\r\nduring a war. Seemingly in response to Walker and Ethridge, he\r\ndeclared that segregated general service was impossible since enough\r\nmen with the skills necessary to operate a war vessel were unavailable\r\neven \"if you had the entire Negro population of the United States to\r\nchoose from.\" As for limiting Negroes to steward duties, he explained\r\nthat this policy avoided the chance that Negroes might rise to command\r\nwhites, \"a thing which instantly provokes serious trouble.\"[3-17] Faced\r\nin wartime with these arguments for efficiency, Assistant Secretary\r\nBard could only promise Ethridge that black enlistment would be taken\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-17: Ltr, SecNav to Gifford Pinchot, 19\r\n                   Jan 42, 54-1-15, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the President again stepped in. On 15 January 1942 he\r\nasked his beleaguered secretary to consider the whole problem once\r\nmore and suggested a course of action: \"I think that with all the Navy\r\nactivities, BuNav might invent something that colored enlistees could\r\ndo in addition to the rating of messman.\"[3-18] The secretary passed the\r\ntask on to the General Board, asking that it develop a plan for\r\nrecruiting 5,000 Negroes in the general service.[3-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-18: Quoted in \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 5.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-19: Memo, SecNav for Chmn, Gen Bd, 16 Jan\r\n                   42, sub: Enlistment of Men of Colored Race in Other\r\n                   Than Messman Branch, Recs of Gen Bd,\r\n                   OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\nWhen the General Board met on 23 January to consider the secretary's\r\nrequest, it became apparent that the minority report on the role of\r\nNegroes in the Navy had gained at least one convert among the senior\r\nofficers. One board member, the Inspector General of the Navy, Rear\r\nAdm. Charles P. Snyder, repeated the arguments lately advanced by\r\nAddison Walker. He suggested that the board consider employing Negroes\r\nin some areas outside the servant class: in the Musician's Branch, for\r\nexample, because \"the colored race is very musical and they are versed\r\nin all forms of rhythm,\" in the Aviation Branch where the Army had\r\nreported some success in employing Negroes, and on auxiliaries and\r\nminor vessels, especially transports. Snyder noted that these schemes\r\nwould involve the creation of training schools, rigidly segregated at\r\nfirst, and that the whole program would be \"troublesome and require\r\ntact, patience, and tolerance\" on the part of those in charge. But, he\r\nadded, \"we have so many difficulties to surmount anyhow that one more\r\npossibly wouldn't swell the total very much.\" Foreseeing that\r\nsegregation would become the focal point of black protest, he argued\r\nthat the Navy had to begin accepting Negroes somewhere, and it might\r\nas well begin with a segregated general service.\r\n\r\nAdamant in its opposition to any change in the Navy's policy, the  (p. 064)\r\nBureau of Navigation ignored Admiral Snyder's suggestions. The spokesman\r\nfor the bureau warned that the 5,000 Negroes under consideration were\r\njust an opening wedge. \"The sponsors of the program,\" Capt. Kenneth\r\nWhiting contended, \"desire full equality on the part of the Negro and\r\nwill not rest content until they obtain it.\" In the end, he predicted,\r\nNegroes would be on every man-of-war in direct proportion to their\r\npercentage of the population. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Maj.\r\nGen. Thomas Holcomb, echoed the bureau's sentiments. He viewed the\r\nissue of black enlistments as crucial.\r\n\r\n     If we are defeated we must not close our eyes to the fact that\r\n     once in they [Negroes] will be strengthened in their effort to\r\n     force themselves into every activity we have. If they are not\r\n     satisfied to be messmen, they will not be satisfied to go into\r\n     the construction or labor battalions. Don't forget the colleges\r\n     are turning out a large number of well-educated Negroes. I don't\r\n     know how long we will be able to keep them out of the V-7 class.\r\n     I think not very long.\r\n\r\nThe commandant called the enlistment of Negroes \"absolutely tragic\";\r\nNegroes had every opportunity, he added, \"to satisfy their aspiration\r\nto serve in the Army,\" and their desire to enter the naval service was\r\nlargely an effort \"to break into a club that doesn't want them.\"\r\n\r\nThe board heard similar sentiments from representatives of the Bureau\r\nof Aeronautics, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, and, with reservations,\r\nfrom the Coast Guard. Confronted with such united opposition from the\r\npowerful bureaus, the General Board capitulated. On 3 February it\r\nreported to the secretary that it was unable to submit a plan and\r\nstrongly recommended that the current policy be allowed to stand. The\r\nboard stated that \"if, in the opinion of higher authority, political\r\npressure is such as to require the enlistment of these people for\r\ngeneral service, let it be for that.\" If restriction of Negroes to the\r\nMessman's Branch was discrimination, the board added, \"it was but part\r\nand parcel of a similar discrimination throughout the United\r\nStates.\"[3-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-20: Enlistment of Men of Colored Race\r\n                   (201), 23 Jan 42, Hearings Before the General Board\r\n                   of the Navy, 1942; Memo, Chmn, Gen Bd, for SecNav,\r\n                   3 Feb 42, sub: Enlistment of Men of Colored Race in\r\n                   Other Than Messman Branch.

President Roosevelt\r\nrefused to accept the argument that the only choice lay between\r\nexclusion in the Messman's Branch and total integration in the general\r\nservice. His desire to avoid the race issue was understandable; the\r\nwar was in its darkest days, and whatever his aspirations for American\r\nsociety, the President was convinced that, while some change was\r\nnecessary, \"to go the whole way at one fell swoop would seriously\r\nimpair the general average efficiency of the Navy.\"[3-21] He wanted the\r\nboard to study the question further, noting that there were some\r\nadditional tasks and some special assignments that could be worked (p. 065)\r\nout for the Negro that \"would not inject into the whole personnel of\r\nthe Navy the race question.\"[3-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-21: Quoted in \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 6.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-22: Memo, SecNav for Chmn, Gen Bd, 14 Feb\r\n                   42, Recs of Gen Bd, OpNavArchives.

Armed with these instructions from the White\r\nHouse, the General Board called on the bureaus and other agencies to\r\nfurnish lists of stations or assignments where Negroes could be used\r\nin other than the Messman's Branch, adding that it was \"unnecessary\r\nand inadvisable\" to emphasize further the undesirability of recruiting\r\nNegroes. Freely interpreting the President's directive, the board\r\ndecided that its proposals had to provide for segregation in order to\r\nprevent the injection of the race issue into the Navy. It rejected the\r\nidea of enlisting Negroes in such selected ratings as musician and\r\ncarpenter's mate or designating a branch for Negroes (the possibility\r\nof an all-black aviation department for a carrier was discussed).\r\nBasing its decision on the plans quickly submitted by the bureaus, the\r\nGeneral Board recommended a course that it felt offered \"least\r\ndisadvantages and the least difficulty of accomplishment as a war\r\nmeasure\": the formation of black units in the shore establishment, black\r\ncrews for naval district local defense craft and selected Coast    (p. 066)\r\nGuard cutters, black regiments in the Seabees, and composite\r\nbattalions in the Marine Corps. The board asked that the Navy\r\nDepartment be granted wide latitude in deciding the number of Negroes\r\nto be accepted as well as their rate of enlistment and the method of\r\nrecruiting, training, and assignment.[3-23] The President agreed to\r\nthe plan, but balked at the board's last request. \"I think this is a\r\nmatter,\" he told Secretary Knox, \"to be determined by you and\r\nme.\"[3-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-23: Memos, Chmn, Gen Bd, for Chief,\r\n                   BuNav, Cmdt, CG, and Cmdt, MC, 18 Feb 42, sub:\r\n                   Enlistment of Men of Colored Race in Other Than\r\n                   Messman Branch.

The national press made the expected invidious comparisons when\r\nJoe Louis turned over his share of the purse from the Louis-Baer fight\r\nto Navy Relief, and Wendell Willkie in a well-publicized speech at New\r\nYork's Freedom House excoriated the Navy's racial practices as a\r\n\"mockery\" of democracy.[3-25] But these were the last shots fired. On 7\r\nApril 1942 Secretary Knox announced the Navy's capitulation. The Navy\r\nwould accept 277 black volunteers per week--it was not yet drafting\r\nanyone--for enlistment in all ratings of the general service of the\r\nreserve components of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Their\r\nactual entry would have to await the construction of suitable, meaning\r\nsegregated, facilities, but the Navy's goal for the first year was\r\n14,000 Negroes in the general service.[3-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-25: New York _Times_, January 10 and\r\n                   March 20, 1942.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-26: Office of SecNav, Press Release, 7\r\n                   Apr 42.]\r\n\r\nMembers of the black community received the news with mixed emotions.\r\nSome reluctantly accepted the plan as a first step; the NAACP's\r\n_Crisis_ called it \"progress toward a more enlightened point of view.\"\r\nOthers, like the National Negro Congress, complimented Knox for his\r\n\"bold, patriotic action.\"[3-27] But almost all were quick to point out\r\nthat the black sailor would be segregated, limited to the rank of\r\npetty officer, and, except as a steward, barred from sea duty.[3-28] The\r\nNavy's plan offered all the disadvantages of the Army's system with\r\nnone of the corresponding advantages for participation and advancement.\r\nThe NAACP hammered away at the segregation angle, informing its public\r\nthat the old system, which had fathered inequalities and humiliations\r\nin the Army and in civilian life, was now being followed by the Navy.\r\nA. Philip Randolph complained that the change in Navy policy merely\r\n\"accepts and extends and consolidates the policy of Jim-Crowism in the\r\nNavy as well as proclaims it as an accepted, recognized government (p. 067)\r\nideology that the Negro is inferior to the white man.\"[3-29] The\r\neditors of the National Urban League's _Opportunity_ concluded that,\r\n\"faced with the great opportunity to strengthen the forces of\r\nDemocracy, the Navy Department chose to affirm the charge that Japan\r\nis making against America to the brown people ... that the so-called\r\nFour Freedoms enunciated in the great 'Atlantic Charter' were for\r\nwhite men only.\"[3-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-27: \"The Navy Makes a Gesture,\" _Crisis_\r\n                   49 (May 1942):51.

On 21 April 1942 Secretary Knox\r\napproved a plan for training Negroes at Camp Barry, an isolated\r\nsection of the Great Lakes Training Center. Later renamed Camp Robert\r\nSmalls after a black naval hero of the Civil War, the camp not only\r\noffered the possibility of practically unlimited expansion but, as the\r\nBureau of Navigation put it, made segregation \"less obvious\" to\r\nrecruits. The secretary also approved the use of facilities at Hampton\r\nInstitute, the well-known black school in Virginia, as an advanced\r\ntraining school for black recruits.[3-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-31: Memo, Chief, BuNav, for SecNav, 17\r\n                   Apr 42, sub: Training Facilities for Negro\r\n                   Recruits, Nav-102; Memo, SecNav for Rear Adm\r\n                   Randall Jacobs, 21 Apr 42, 54-1-22.

At the\r\nsame time the Navy opened enlistments for an unlimited number of black\r\nSeabees and messmen. Lt. Comdr. Daniel Armstrong commanded the recruit\r\nprogram at Camp Smalls. An Annapolis graduate, son of the founder of\r\nHampton Institute, Armstrong first came to the attention of Knox in\r\nMarch 1942 when he submitted a plan for the employment of black\r\nsailors that the secretary considered practical.[3-32] Under Armstrong's\r\nenergetic leadership, black recruits received training that was in\r\nsome respects superior to that afforded whites. For all his success,\r\nhowever, Armstrong was strongly criticized, especially by educated\r\nNegroes who resented his theories of education. Imbued with the\r\npaternalistic attitude of Tuskegee and Hampton, Armstrong saw the\r\nNegro as possessing a separate culture more attuned to vocational\r\ntraining. He believed that Negroes needed special treatment and\r\ndiscipline in a totally segregated environment free from white\r\ncompetition. Educated Negroes, on the other hand, saw in this special\r\ntreatment another form of discrimination.[3-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-32: Memo, SecNav for Chmn, Gen Bd, 7 Mar\r\n                   42, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-33: For a discussion of Armstrong's\r\n                   philosophy from the viewpoint of an educated black\r\n                   recruit, see Nelson, \"Integration of the Negro,\"\r\n                   pp. 28-34. Sec also Ltr, Nelson to author, 10 Feb\r\n                   70, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of the new segregated training program,\r\nbefore the great influx of Negroes from the draft, the Navy set the\r\ntraining period at twelve weeks. Later, when it had reluctantly\r\nabandoned the longer period, the Navy discovered that the regular\r\neight-week course was sufficient. Approximately 31 percent of those\r\ngraduating from the recruit course were qualified for Class A      (p. 068)\r\nschools and entered advanced classes to receive training that would\r\nnormally lead to petty officer rating for the top graduates and\r\nprepare men for assignment to naval stations and local defense and\r\ndistrict craft. There they would serve in such class \"A\" specialties\r\nas radioman, signalman, and yeoman and the other occupational\r\nspecialties such as machinist, mechanic, carpenter, electrician, cook,\r\nand baker.[3-34] Some of these classes were held at Hampton, but, as the\r\nnumber of black recruits increased, the majority remained at Camp\r\nSmalls for advanced training.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-34: With the exception of machinist\r\n                   school, where blacks were in training twice as long\r\n                   as whites, specialist training for Negroes and\r\n                   whites was similar in length. See \"BuPers Hist,\"\r\n                   pp. 28-30, 60-61.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRICIAN MATES _string power lines in the Central\r\nPacific_.]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the recruit graduates, those unqualified for advanced\r\nschooling, were divided. Some went directly to naval stations and\r\nlocal defense and district craft where they relieved whites as seaman,\r\nsecond class, and fireman, third class, and as trainees in specialties\r\nthat required no advanced schooling; the rest, approximately eighty\r\nmen per week, went to naval ammunition depots as unskilled\r\nlaborers.[3-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-35: BuPers, \"Reports, Schedules, and\r\n                   Charts Relating to Enlistment, Training, and\r\n                   Assignment of Negro Personnel,\" 5 Jun 42, Pers-617,\r\n                   BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy proceeded to assimilate the black volunteers along these\r\nlines, suffering few of the personnel problems that plagued the Army\r\nin the first months of the war. In contrast to the Army's chaotic\r\nsituation, caused by the thousands of black recruits streaming in from\r\nSelective Service, the Navy's plans for its volunteers were disrupted\r\nonly because qualified Negroes showed little inclination to flock to\r\nthe Navy standard, and more than half of those who did were rejected.\r\nThe Bureau of Naval Personnel[3-36] reported that during the first three\r\nweeks of recruitment only 1,261 Negroes volunteered for general\r\nservice, and 58 percent of these had to be rejected for physical and\r\nother reasons. The Chief of Naval Personnel, Rear Adm. Randall Jacobs,\r\nwas surprised at the small number of volunteers, a figure far below\r\nthe planners' expectations, and his surprise turned to concern in the\r\nnext months as the seventeen-year-old volunteer inductees, the primary\r\ntarget of the armed forces recruiters, continued to choose the Army\r\nover the Navy at a ratio of 10 to 1.[3-37] The Navy's personnel\r\nofficials agreed that they had to attract their proper share of\r\nintelligent and able Negroes but seemed unable to isolate the      (p. 069)\r\ncause of the disinterest. Admiral Jacobs blamed it on a lack of\r\npublicity; the bureau's historians, perhaps unaware of the Navy's\r\nnineteenth century experience with black seamen, later attributed it\r\nto Negroes' \"relative unfamiliarity with the sea or the large inland\r\nwaters and their consequent fear of the water.\"[3-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-36: In May 1942 the name of the Bureau of\r\n                   Navigation was changed to the Bureau of Naval\r\n                   Personnel to reflect more accurately the duties of\r\n                   the organization.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-37: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for CO, Great\r\n                   Lakes NTC, 23 Apr 43. P14-1, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-38: \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 54.]\r\n\r\nThe fact was, of course, that Negroes shunned the Navy because of its\r\nrecent reputation as the exclusive preserve of white America. Only\r\nwhen the Navy began assigning black recruiting specialists to the\r\nnumerous naval districts and using black chief petty officers,\r\nreservists from World War I general service, at recruiting centers to\r\nexplain the new opportunities for Negroes in the Navy was the bureau\r\nable to overcome some of the young men's natural reluctance to\r\nvolunteer. By 1 February 1943 the Navy had 26,909 Negroes (still 2\r\npercent of the total enlisted): 6,662 in the general service; 2,020 in\r\nthe Seabees; and 19,227, over two-thirds of the total, in the\r\nSteward's Branch.[3-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-39: Ibid., p. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe smooth and efficient distribution of black recruits was\r\nshort-lived. Under pressure from the Army, the War Manpower\r\nCommission, and in particular the White House, the Navy was forced\r\ninto a sudden and significant expansion of its black recruit program.\r\nThe Army had long objected to the Navy's recruitment method, and as\r\nearly as February 1942 Secretary Stimson was calling the volunteer\r\nrecruitment system a waste of manpower.[3-40] He was even more direct\r\nwhen he complained to President Roosevelt that through voluntary\r\nrecruiting the Navy had avoided acceptance of any considerable number\r\nof Negroes. Consequently, the Army was now faced with the possibility\r\nof having to accept an even greater proportion of Negroes \"with\r\nadverse effect on its combat efficiency.\" The solution to this\r\nproblem, as Stimson saw it, was for the Navy to take its recruits from\r\nSelective Service.[3-41] Stimson failed to win his point. The President\r\naccepted the Navy's argument that segregation would be difficult to\r\nmaintain on board ship. \"If the Navy living conditions on board ship\r\nwere similar to the Army living conditions on land,\" he wrote Stimson,\r\n\"the problem would be easier but the circumstances ... being such as\r\nthey are, I feel that it is best to continue the present system at\r\nthis time.\"[3-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-40: Memo, SW for SecNav, 16 Feb 42, sub:\r\n                   Continuing of Voluntary Recruiting by the Navy,\r\n                   QN/P14-4, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-41: Idem for President, 16 Mar 42, copy\r\n                   in QN/P14-4, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-42: Memo, President for SW, 20 Mar 42,\r\n                   copy in QN/P14-4, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nBut the battle over racial quotas was only beginning. The question of\r\nthe number of Negroes in the Navy was only part of the much broader\r\nconsiderations and conflicts over manpower policy that finally led the\r\nPresident, on 5 December 1942, to direct the discontinuance in all\r\nservices of volunteer enlistment of men between the ages of eighteen\r\nand thirty-eight.[3-43] Beginning in February 1943 all men in this age\r\ngroup would be obtained through Selective Service. The order also\r\nplaced Selective Service under the War Manpower Commission.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-43: Executive Order 9279, 5 Dec 42.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy issued its first call for inductees from Selective        (p. 070)\r\nService in February 1943, adopting the Army's policy of placing its\r\nrequisition on a racial basis and specifying the number of whites and\r\nblacks needed for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The Bureau\r\nof Naval Personnel planned to continue its old monthly quota of about\r\n1,200 Negroes for general service and 1,500 for the Messman's Branch.\r\nSecretary Knox explained to the President that it would be impossible\r\nfor the Navy to take more Negroes without resorting to mixed crews in\r\nthe fleet, which, Knox reminded Roosevelt, was a policy \"contrary to\r\nthe President's program.\" The President agreed with Knox and told him\r\nso to advise Maj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director of Selective\r\nService.[3-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-44: Memo, SecNav for Rear Adm Randall\r\n                   Jacobs, 5 Feb 43, 54-1-22, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nThe problem of drafting men by race was a major concern of the Bureau\r\nof Selective Service and its parent organization, the War Manpower\r\nCommission. At a time when a general shortage of manpower was\r\ndeveloping and industry was beginning to feel the effects of the\r\ndraft, Negroes still made up only 6 percent of the armed forces, a\r\nlittle over half their percentage of the population, and almost all of\r\nthese were in the Army. The chairman of the War Manpower Commission,\r\nPaul V. McNutt, explained to Secretary Knox as he had to Secretary\r\nStimson that the practice of placing separate calls for white and\r\nblack registrants could not be justified. Not only were there serious\r\nsocial and legal implications in the existing draft practices, he\r\npointed out, but the Selective Service Act itself prohibited racial\r\ndiscrimination. It was necessary, therefore, to draft men by order\r\nnumber and not by color.[3-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-45: Ltr, Paul McNutt to SecNav, 17 Feb\r\n                   43, WMC Gen files, NARS.]\r\n\r\nOn top of this blow, the Navy came under fire from another quarter.\r\nThe President was evidently still thinking about Negroes in the Navy.\r\nHe wrote to the secretary on 22 February:\r\n\r\n     I guess you were dreaming or maybe I was dreaming if Randall\r\n     Jacobs is right in regard to what I am supposed to have said\r\n     about employment of negroes in the Navy. If I did say that such\r\n     employment should be stopped, I must have been talking in my\r\n     sleep. Most decidedly we must continue the employment of negroes\r\n     in the Navy, and I do not think it the least bit necessary to put\r\n     mixed crews on the ships. I can find a thousand ways of employing\r\n     them without doing so.\r\n\r\n     The point or the thing is this. There is going to be a great deal\r\n     of feeling if the Government in winning this war does not employ\r\n     approximately 10% of negroes--their actual percentage to the\r\n     total population. The Army is nearly up to this percentage but\r\n     the Navy is so far below it that it will be deeply criticized by\r\n     anybody who wants to check into the details.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps a check by you showing exactly where all white enlisted\r\n     men are serving and where all colored enlisted men are serving\r\n     will show you the great number of places where colored men could\r\n     serve, where they are not serving now--shore duty of all kinds,\r\n     together with the handling of many kinds of yard craft.\r\n\r\n     You know the headache we have had about this and the reluctance\r\n     of the Navy to have any negroes. You and I have had to veto that\r\n     Navy reluctance and I think we have to do it again.[3-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-46: Memo, President for SecNav, 22 Feb\r\n                   43, FDR Library.]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to save the quota concept, the Bureau of Naval        (p. 071)\r\nPersonnel ground out new figures that would raise the current call of\r\n2,700 Negroes per month to 5,000 in April and 7,350 for each of the\r\nremaining months of 1943. Armed with these figures, Secretary Knox was\r\nable to promise Commissioner McNutt that 10 percent of the men\r\ninducted for the rest of 1943 would be Negroes, although separate\r\ncalls had to be continued for the time being to permit adjusting the\r\nflow of Negroes to the expansion of facilities.[3-47] In other words,\r\nthe secretary promised to accept 71,900 black draftees in 1943; he did\r\nnot promise to increase the black strength of the Navy to 10 percent\r\nof the total.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-47: Ltr, Knox to McNutt, 26 Feb 43, WMC\r\n                   Gen files.]\r\n\r\nCommissioner McNutt understood the distinction and found the Navy's\r\noffer wanting for two reasons. The proposed schedule was inadequate to\r\nabsorb the backlog of black registrants who should have been inducted\r\ninto the armed services, and it did not raise the percentage of\r\nNegroes in the Navy to a figure comparable to their strength in the\r\nnational population. McNutt wanted the Navy to draft at least 125,000\r\nNegroes before January 1944, and he insisted that the practice of\r\nplacing separate calls be terminated \"as soon as feasible.\"[3-48] The\r\nNavy finally struck a compromise with the commission, agreeing that up\r\nto 14,150 Negroes a month would be inducted for the rest of 1943 to\r\nreach the 125,000 figure by January 1944.[3-49] The issue of separate\r\ndraft calls for Negroes and whites remained in abeyance while the\r\nservices made common cause against the commission by insisting that\r\nthe orderly absorption of Negroes demanded a regular program that\r\ncould only be met by maintaining the quota system.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-48: Ltr, McNutt to Knox, 23 Mar 43, WMC\r\n                   Gen files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-49: Ltr, SecNav to Paul McNutt, 13 Apr\r\n                   43; Ltr, McNutt to Knox, 23 Apr 43; both in WMC Gen\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nTotal black enlistments never reached 10 percent of the Navy's wartime\r\nenlisted strength but remained nearer the 5 percent mark. But this\r\nfigure masks the Navy's racial picture in the later years of the war\r\nafter it became dependent on Selective Service. The Navy drafted\r\n150,955 Negroes during the war, 11.1 percent of all the men it\r\ndrafted. In 1943 alone the Navy placed calls with Selective Service\r\nfor 116,000 black draftees. Although Selective Service was unable to\r\nfill the monthly request completely, the Navy received 77,854 black\r\ndraftees (versus 672,437 whites) that year, a 240 percent rise over\r\nthe 1942 black enlistment rate.[3-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-50: Selective Service System, _Special\r\n                   Groups_, vol.

The Navy, Knox told\r\nPresident Roosevelt, would continue to segregate Negroes and restrict\r\ntheir service to certain occupations. Its increased black strength\r\nwould be absorbed in twenty-seven new black Seabee battalions, in\r\nwhich Negroes would serve overseas as stevedores; in black crews for\r\nharbor craft and local defense forces; and in billets for cooks and\r\nport hands. The rest would be sent to shore stations for guard     (p. 072)\r\nand miscellaneous duties in concentrations up to about 50 percent of\r\nthe total station strength. The President approved the Navy's\r\nproposals, and the distribution of Negroes followed these lines.[3-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-51: Memos, SecNav for President, 25 Feb\r\n                   and 14 Apr 43, quoted in \"BuPers Hist,\" pp. 13-14;\r\n                   Memo, Actg Chief, NavPers, for SecNav, 24 Feb 43,\r\n                   sub: Employment of Colored Personnel in the Navy,\r\n                   Pers 10, GenRecsNav. For Roosevelt's approval see\r\n                   \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 14.]\r\n\r\nTo smooth the racial adjustments implicit in these plans, the Bureau\r\nof Naval Personnel developed two operating rules: Negroes would be\r\nassigned only where need existed, and, whenever possible, those from\r\nnorthern communities would not be used in the south. These rules\r\ncaused some peculiar adjustments in administration. Negroes were not\r\nassigned to naval districts for distribution according to the\r\ndiscretion of the commander, as were white recruits. Rather, after\r\nconferring with local commanders, the bureau decided on the number of\r\nNegroes to be included in station complements and the types of jobs\r\nthey would fill. It then assigned the men to duty accordingly, and the\r\ndistricts were instructed not to change the orders without consulting\r\nthe bureau. Subsequently the bureau reinforced this rule by enjoining\r\nthe commanders to use Negroes in the ratings for which they had been\r\ntrained and by sending bureau representatives to the various commands\r\nto check on compliance.\r\n\r\nSome planners feared that the concentration of Negroes at shore\r\nstations might prove detrimental to efficiency and morale. Proposals\r\nwere circulated in the Bureau of Naval Personnel for the inclusion of\r\nNegroes in small numbers in the crews of large combat ships--for\r\nexample, they might be used as firemen and ordinary seamen on the new\r\naircraft carriers--but Admiral Jacobs rejected the recommendations.[3-52]\r\nThe Navy was not yet ready to try integration, it seemed, even though\r\nracial disturbances were becoming a distinct possibility in 1943. For\r\nas Negroes became a larger part of the Navy, they also became a\r\ngreater source of tension. The reasons for the tension were readily\r\napparent. Negroes were restricted for the most part to shore duty,\r\nconcentrated in large groups and assigned to jobs with little prestige\r\nand few chances of promotion. They were excluded from the WAVES (Women\r\nAccepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), the Nurse Corps, and the\r\ncommissioned ranks. And they were rigidly segregated.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-52: \"BuPersHist,\" p. 41.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Navy boasted that Negroes served in every rating and at\r\nevery task, in fact almost all were used in a limited range of\r\noccupations. Denied general service assignments on warships, trained\r\nNegroes were restricted to the relatively few billets open in the\r\nharbor defense, district, and small craft service. Although assigning\r\nNegroes to these duties met the President's request for variety of\r\nopportunity, the small craft could employ only 7,700 men at most, a\r\nminuscule part of the Navy's black strength.\r\n\r\nMost Negroes performed humbler duties. By mid-1944 over 38,000 black\r\nsailors were serving as mess stewards, cooks, and bakers. These jobs\r\nremained in the Negro's eyes a symbol of his second-class citizenship\r\nin the naval establishment. Under pressure to provide more         (p. 073)\r\nstewards to serve the officers whose number multiplied in the early\r\nmonths of the war, recruiters had netted all the men they could for\r\nthat separate duty. Often recruiters took in many as stewards who were\r\nequipped by education and training for better jobs, and when these men\r\nwere immediately put into uniforms and trained on the job at local\r\nnaval stations the result was often dismaying. The Navy thus received\r\npoor service as well as unwelcome publicity for maintaining a\r\nsegregated servants' branch. In an effort to standardize the training\r\nof messmen, the Bureau of Naval Personnel established a stewards\r\nschool in the spring of 1943 at Norfolk and later one at Bainbridge,\r\nMaryland. The change in training did little to improve the standards\r\nof the service and much to intensify the feeling of isolation among\r\nmany stewards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABORERS AT NAVAL AMMUNITION DEPOT. _Sailors passing\r\n5-inch canisters, St. Julien's Creek, Virginia._]\r\n\r\nAnother 12,000 Negroes served as artisans and laborers at overseas\r\nbases. Over 7,000 of these were Seabees, who, with the exception of\r\ntwo regular construction battalions that served with distinction in\r\nthe Pacific, were relegated to \"special\" battalions stevedoring cargo\r\nand supplies. The rest were laborers in base companies assigned to the\r\nSouth Pacific area. These units were commanded by white officers, and\r\nalmost all the petty officers were white.\r\n\r\nApproximately half the Negroes in the Navy were detailed to shore\r\nbillets within the continental United States. Most worked as laborers\r\nat ammunition or supply depots, at air stations, and at section    (p. 074)\r\nbases,[3-53] concentrated in large all-black groups and sometimes\r\ncommanded by incompetent white officers.[3-54]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-53: Naval districts organized section\r\n                   bases during the war with responsibility, among\r\n                   other things, for guarding beaches, harbors, and\r\n                   installations and maintaining equipment.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-54: See CNO ALNAV, 7 Aug 44, quoted in\r\n                   Nelson, \"Integration of the Negro,\" p. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEABEES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC _righting an undermined\r\nwater tank_.]\r\n\r\nWhile some billets existed in practically every important rating for\r\ngraduates of the segregated specialty schools, these jobs were so few\r\nthat black specialists were often assigned instead to unskilled\r\nlaboring jobs.[3-55] Some of these men were among the best educated\r\nNegroes in the Navy, natural leaders capable of articulating their\r\ndissatisfaction. They resented being barred from the fighting, and\r\ntheir resentment, spreading through the thousands of Negroes in the\r\nshore establishment, was a prime cause of racial tension.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-55: Memo, Actg Chief, NavPers, for Cmdts,\r\n                   AlNav Districts et al., 26 Sep 44, sub: Enlisted\r\n                   Personnel--Utilization of in Field for which\r\n                   Specifically Trained, Pers 16-3/MM, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nNo black women had been admitted to the Navy. Race was not mentioned\r\nin the legislation establishing the WAVES in 1942, but neither was\r\nexclusion on account of color expressly forbidden. The WAVES and the\r\nWomen's Reserve of both the Coast Guard (SPARS) and the Marine Corps\r\ntherefore celebrated their second birthday exclusively white. The Navy\r\nNurse Corps was also totally white. In answer to protests passed to\r\nthe service through Eleanor Roosevelt, the Navy admitted in November\r\n1943 that it had a shortage of 500 nurses, but since another       (p. 075)\r\n500 white nurses were under indoctrination and training, the Bureau of\r\nMedicine and Surgery explained, \"the question relative to the\r\nnecessity for accepting colored personnel in this category is not\r\napparent.\"[3-56]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-56: Ltr, Eleanor Roosevelt to SecNav, 20\r\n                   Nov 43; Ltr, SecNav to Mrs. Roosevelt, 27 Nov 43;\r\n                   both in BUMED-S-EC, GenRecsNav. Well known for her\r\n                   interest in the cause of racial justice, the\r\n                   President's wife received many complaints during\r\n                   the war concerning discrimination in the armed\r\n                   forces. Mrs. Roosevelt often passed such protests\r\n                   along to the service secretaries for action.\r\n                   Although there is no doubt where Mrs. Roosevelt's\r\n                   sympathies lay in these matters, her influence was\r\n                   slight on the policies and practices of the Army or\r\n                   Navy. Her influence on the President's thinking is,\r\n                   of course, another matter. See White, _A Man Called\r\n                   White_, pp. 168-69, 190.]\r\n\r\nAnother major cause of unrest among black seamen was the matter of\r\nrank and promotion. With the exception of the Coast Guard, the naval\r\nestablishment had no black officers in 1943, and none were\r\ncontemplated. Nor was there much opportunity for advancement in the\r\nranks. Barred from service in the fleet, the nonrated seamen faced\r\nstrong competition for the limited number of petty officer positions\r\nin the shore establishment. In consequence, morale throughout the\r\nranks deteriorated.\r\n\r\nThe constant black complaint, and the root of the Navy's racial\r\nproblem, was segregation. It was especially hard on young black\r\nrecruits who had never experienced legal segregation in civilian life\r\nand on the \"talented tenth,\" the educated Negroes, who were quickly\r\nfrustrated by a policy that decided opportunity and assignment on the\r\nbasis of color. They particularly resented segregation in housing,\r\nmessing, and recreation. Here segregation off the job, officially\r\nsanctioned, made manifest by signs distinguishing facilities for white\r\nand black, and enforced by military as well as civilian police, was a\r\ndaily reminder for the Negro of the Navy's discrimination.\r\n\r\nSuch discrimination created tension in the ranks that periodically\r\nreleased itself in racial disorder. The first sign of serious unrest\r\noccurred in June 1943 when over half the 640 Negroes of the Naval\r\nAmmunition Depot at St. Julien's Creek, Virginia, rioted against\r\nalleged discrimination in segregated seating for a radio show. In\r\nJuly, 744 Negroes of the 80th Construction Battalion staged a protest\r\nover segregation on a transport in the Caribbean. Yet, naval\r\ninvestigators cited leadership problems as a major factor in these and\r\nsubsequent incidents, and at least one commanding officer was relieved\r\nas a consequence.[3-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-57: For a discussion of these racial\r\n                   disturbances, see \"BuPers Hist,\" pp. 75-80.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Progressive Experiments_\r\n\r\nSince the inception of black enlistment there had been those in the\r\nBureau of Naval Personnel who argued for the establishment of a group\r\nto coordinate plans and policies on the training and use of black\r\nsailors. Various proposals were considered, but only in the wake of\r\nthe racial disturbances of 1943 did the bureau set up a Special\r\nPrograms Unit in its Planning and Control Activity to oversee the\r\nwhole black enlistment program. In the end the size of the unit\r\ngoverned the scope of its program. Originally the unit was to monitor\r\nall transactions involving Negroes in the bureau's operating divisions,\r\nthus relieving the Enlisted Division of the critical task of       (p. 076)\r\ndistributing billets for Negroes. It was also supposed to advise local\r\ncommanders on race problems and interpret departmental policies for\r\nthem. When finally established in August 1943, the unit consisted of\r\nonly three officers, a size which considerably limited its activities.\r\nStill, the unit worked diligently to improve the lot of the black\r\nsailor, and eventually from this office would emerge the plans that\r\nbrought about the integration of the Navy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMANDER SARGENT.]\r\n\r\nThe Special Programs Unit's patron saint and the guiding spirit of the\r\nNavy's liberalizing race program was Lt. Comdr. Christopher S.\r\nSargent. He never served in the unit himself, but helped find the two\r\nlieutenant commanders, Donald O. VanNess and Charles E. Dillon, who\r\nworked under Capt. Thomas F. Darden in the Plans and Operations\r\nSection of the Bureau of Naval Personnel and acted as liaison between\r\nthe Special Programs Unit and its civilian superiors. A legendary\r\nfigure in the bureau, the 31-year-old Sargent arrived as a lieutenant,\r\njunior grade, from Dean Acheson's law firm, but his rank and official\r\nposition were no measure of his influence in the Navy Department. By\r\nbirth and training he was used to moving in the highest circles of\r\nAmerican society and government, and he had wide-ranging interests and\r\nduties in the Navy. Described by a superior as \"a philosopher who\r\ncould not tolerate segregation,\"[3-58] Sargent waged something of a\r\nmoral crusade to integrate the Navy. He was convinced that a social\r\nchange impossible in peacetime was practical in war. Not only would\r\nintegration build a more efficient Navy, it might also lead the way to\r\nchanges in American society that would bridge the gap between the\r\nraces.[3-59] In effect, Sargent sought to force the generally\r\nconservative Bureau of Naval Personnel into making rapid and sweeping\r\nchanges in the Navy's racial policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-58: Interv, Lee Nichols with Rear Adm.

It began attacking the concentration of Negroes in\r\nlarge segregated groups in the naval districts by creating more overseas\r\nbillets. Toward the end of 1943, Negroes were being assigned in    (p. 077)\r\ngreater numbers to duty in the Pacific at shore establishments and\r\naboard small defense, district, and yard craft. The Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel also created new specialties for Negroes in the general\r\nservice. One important addition was the creation of black shore patrol\r\nunits for which a school was started at Great Lakes. The Special\r\nPrograms Unit established a remedial training center for illiterate\r\ndraftees at Camp Robert Smalls, drawing the faculty from black\r\nservicemen who had been educators in civilian life. The twelve-week\r\ncourse gave the students the equivalent of a fifth grade education in\r\naddition to regular recruit training. Approximately 15,000 Negroes\r\ntook this training before the school was consolidated with a similar\r\norganization for whites at Bainbridge, Maryland, in the last months of\r\nthe war.[3-60]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-60: For further discussion, see Nelson,\r\n                   \"Integration of the Negro,\" pp. 124-46.]\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the Special Programs Unit worked for\r\nthe efficient use of black Class A school graduates by renewing the\r\nattack on improper assignments. The bureau had long held that the\r\nproper assignment of black specialists was of fundamental importance\r\nto morale and efficiency, and in July 1943 it had ordered that all men\r\nmust be used in the ratings and for the types of work for which they\r\nhad been trained.[3-61] But the unit discovered considerable deviation\r\nfrom this policy in some districts, especially in the south, where\r\nthere was a tendency to regard Negroes as an extra labor source above\r\nthe regular military complement. In December 1943 the Special Programs\r\nUnit got the bureau to rule in the name of manpower efficiency that,\r\nwith the exception of special units in the supply departments at South\r\nBoston and Norfolk, no black sailor could be assigned to such civilian\r\njobs as maintenance work and stevedoring in the continental United\r\nStates.[3-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-61: BuPers Ltr, Pers 106-MBR, 12 Jul 43.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-62: \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 53.]\r\n\r\nThese reforms were welcome, but they ignored the basic dilemma: the\r\nonly way to abolish concentrations of shore-based Negroes was to open\r\nup positions for them in the fleet. Though many black sailors were\r\nbest suited for unskilled or semiskilled billets, a significant number\r\nhad technical skills that could be properly used only if these men\r\nwere assigned to the fleet. To relieve the racial tension and to end\r\nthe waste of skilled manpower engendered by the misuse of these men,\r\nthe Special Programs Unit pressed for a chance to test black\r\nseamanship. Admiral King agreed, and in early 1944 the Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel assigned 196 black enlisted men and 44 white officers and\r\npetty officers to the USS _Mason_, a newly commissioned destroyer\r\nescort, with the understanding that all enlisted billets would be\r\nfilled by Negroes as soon as those qualified to fill them had been\r\ntrained. It also assigned 53 black rated seamen and 14 white officers\r\nand noncommissioned officers to a patrol craft, the PC 1264.[3-63] Both\r\nships eventually replaced their white petty officers and some of their\r\nofficers with Negroes. Among the latter was Ens. Samuel Gravely, who\r\nwas to become the Navy's first black admiral.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-63: Memo, Chief, BuPers, for CINCUSFLEET,\r\n                   1 Dec 43, sub: Negro Personnel, P16/MM, BuPersRecs.\r\n                   The latter experiment has been chronicled by its\r\n                   commanding officer, Eric Purdon, in _Black Company:\r\n                   The Story of Subchaser 1264_ (Washington: Luce,\r\n                   1972).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: USS MASON. _Sailors look over their new ship._]\r\n\r\nAlthough both ships continued to operate with black crews well     (p. 078)\r\ninto 1945, the _Mason_ on escort duty in the Atlantic, only four\r\nother segregated patrol craft were added to the fleet during the\r\nwar.[3-64] The _Mason_ passed its shakedown cruise test, but the Bureau\r\nof Naval Personnel was not satisfied with the crew. The black petty\r\nofficers had proved competent in their ratings and interested in their\r\nwork, but bureau observers agreed that the rated men in general were\r\nunable to maintain discipline. The nonrated men tended to lack respect\r\nfor the petty officers, who showed some disinclination to put their\r\nmen on report. The Special Programs Unit admitted the truth of these\r\ncharges but argued that the experiment only proved what the Navy\r\nalready knew: black sailors did not respond well when assigned to\r\nall-black organizations under white officers.[3-65] On the other hand,\r\nthe experiment demonstrated that the Navy possessed a reservoir of\r\nable seamen who were not being efficiently employed, and--an\r\nunexpected dividend from the presence of white noncommissioned\r\nofficers--that integration worked on board ship. The white petty\r\nofficers messed, worked, and slept with their men in the close contact\r\ninevitable aboard small ships, with no sign of racial friction.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-64: Memo, CNO for Cmdt, First and Fifth\r\n                   Naval Districts, 10 May 44, sub: Assignment of\r\n                   Negro Personnel, P-16-3/MM, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-65: For an assessment of the performance\r\n                   of the _Mason's_ crew. see \"BuPers Hist,\" pp. 42-43\r\n                   and 92.]\r\n\r\nOpportunity for advancement was as important to morale as          (p. 079)\r\nassignment according to training and skill, and the Special Programs\r\nUnit encouraged the promotion of Negroes according to their ability\r\nand in proportion to their number. Although in July 1943 the Bureau of\r\nNaval Personnel had warned commanders that it would continue to order\r\nwhite enlisted men to sea with the expectation that they would be\r\nreplaced in shore jobs by Negroes,[3-66] the Special Programs Unit\r\ndiscovered that rating and promotion of Negroes was still slow. At the\r\nunit's urging, the bureau advised all naval districts that it expected\r\nNegroes to be rated upward \"as rapidly as practicable\" and asked them\r\nto report on their rating of Negroes.[3-67] It also authorized stations\r\nto retain white petty officers for up to two weeks to break in their\r\nblack replacements, but warned that this privilege must not be abused.\r\nThe bureau further directed that all qualified general service\r\ncandidates be advanced to ratings for which they were eligible\r\nregardless of whether their units were authorized enough spaces to\r\ntake care of them. This last directive did little for black promotions\r\nat first because many local commanders ruled that no Negroes could be\r\n\"qualified\" since none were allowed to perform sea duties. In January\r\n1944 the bureau had to clarify the order to make sure that Negroes\r\nwere given the opportunity to advance.[3-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-66: BuPers Ltr, P16-3, 12 Jul 43, sub:\r\n                   The Expanded Use of Negroes, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-67: Ltr, Chief, NavPers, to Cmdts, All\r\n                   Naval Districts, 19 Aug 43, sub: Advancement in\r\n                   Rating re: Negro Personnel, P17-2/MM, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-68: BuPers Cir Ltr 6-44, 12 Jan 44.]\r\n\r\nDespite these evidences of command concern, black promotions continued\r\nto lag in the Navy. Again at the Special Programs Unit's urging, the\r\nBureau of Naval Personnel began to limit the number of rated men\r\nturned out by the black training schools so that more nonrated men\r\nalready on the job might have a better chance to win ratings. The\r\nbureau instituted a specialist leadership course for rated Negroes at\r\nGreat Lakes and recommended in January 1944 that two Negroes so\r\ntrained be included in each base company sent out of the country. It\r\nalso selected twelve Negroes with backgrounds in education and public\r\nrelations and assigned them to recruiting duty around the country. The\r\nbureau expanded the black petty officer program because it was\r\nconvinced by the end of 1943 that the presence of more black leaders,\r\nparticularly in the large base companies, would improve discipline and\r\nraise morale. It was but a short step from this conviction to a\r\nrealization that black commissioned officers were needed.\r\n\r\nDespite its 100,000 enlisted Negroes, the absence of black\r\ncommissioned officers in the fall of 1943 forced the Navy to answer an\r\nincreasing number of queries from civil rights organizations and\r\nCongress.[3-69] Several times during 1942 suggestions were made within\r\nthe Bureau of Naval Personnel that the instructors at the Hampton\r\nspecialist school and seventy-five other Negroes be commissioned   (p. 080)\r\nfor service with the large black units, but nothing happened.\r\nSecretary Knox himself thought that the Navy would have to develop a\r\nconsiderable body of black sailors before it could even think about\r\ncommissioning black officers.[3-70] But the secretary failed to\r\nappreciate the effect of the sheer number of black draftees that\r\noverwhelmed the service in the spring of 1943, and he reckoned without\r\nthe persuasive arguments of his special assistant, Adlai\r\nStevenson.[3-71]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-69: News that the Navy had inadvertently\r\n                   commissioned a black student at Harvard University\r\n                   in the spring of 1942 produced the following\r\n                   reaction in one personnel office: \"LtCmdr B ...\r\n                   [Special Activities Branch, BuPers] says this is\r\n                   true due to a slip by the officer who signed up\r\n                   medical students at Harvard.

He was an\r\ninvaluable and influential ally for the Special Programs Unit.\r\nStevenson knew Knox well and understood how to approach him. He was\r\nparticularly effective in getting Negroes commissioned. In September\r\n1943 he pointed out that, with the induction of 12,000 Negroes a\r\nmonth, the demand for black officers would be mounting in the black\r\ncommunity and in the government as well. The Navy could not and should\r\nnot, he warned, postpone much longer the creation of some black\r\nofficers. Suspicion of discrimination was one reason the Navy was\r\nfailing to get the best qualified Negroes, and Stevenson believed it\r\nwise to act quickly. He recommended that the Navy commission ten or\r\ntwelve Negroes from among \"top notch civilians just as we procure\r\nwhite officers\" and a few from the ranks. The commissioning should be\r\ntreated as a matter of course without any special publicity. The news,\r\nhe added wryly, would get out soon enough.[3-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-72: Kenneth S. Davis, _The Politics of\r\n                   Honor: A Biography of Adlai E.

But Annapolis had no Negroes enrolled at the time\r\nStevenson spoke, and only a dozen Negroes were enrolled in V-12\r\nprograms at integrated civilian colleges throughout the country.[3-74]\r\nThe lack of black students in the V-12 program could be attributed in\r\npart to the belief of many black trainees that the program barred\r\nNegroes. Actually, it never had, and in December 1943 the bureau\r\npublicized this fact. It issued a circular letter emphasizing to all\r\ncommanders that enlisted men were entitled to consideration for transfer\r\nto the V-12 program regardless of race.[3-75] Despite this effort  (p. 081)\r\nit was soon apparent that the program would produce only a few black\r\nofficers, and the Bureau of Naval Personnel, at the urging of its\r\nSpecial Programs Unit, agreed to follow Stevenson's suggestion and\r\nconcentrate on the direct commissioning of Negroes. Unlike Stevenson\r\nthe bureau preferred to obtain most of the men from the enlisted\r\nranks, and only in the case of certain specially trained men did the\r\nNavy commission civilians.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-74: The V-12 program was designed to\r\n                   prepare large numbers of educated men for the\r\n                   Navy's Reserve Midshipmen schools and to increase\r\n                   the war-depleted student bodies of many colleges.\r\n                   The Navy signed on eligible students as apprentice\r\n                   seamen and paid their academic expenses. Eventually\r\n                   the V-12 program produced some 80,000 officers for\r\n                   the wartime Navy.

All sixteen survived the course, but only twelve\r\nwere commissioned. In the last week of the course, three candidates\r\nwere returned to the ranks, not because they had failed but because\r\nthe Bureau of Naval Personnel had suddenly decided to limit the number\r\nof black officers in this first group to twelve. The twelve entered\r\nthe U.S. Naval Reserve as line officers on 17 March. A thirteenth man,\r\nthe only candidate who lacked a college degree, was made a warrant\r\nofficer because of his outstanding work in the course.\r\n\r\nTwo of the twelve new ensigns were assigned to the faculty at Hampton\r\ntraining school, four others to yard and harbor craft duty, and the\r\nrest to training duty at Great Lakes. All carried the label \"Deck\r\nOfficers Limited--only,\" a designation usually reserved for officers\r\nwhose physical or educational deficiencies kept them from performing\r\nall the duties of a line officer. The Bureau of Naval Personnel never\r\nexplained why the men were placed in this category, but it was clear\r\nthat none of them lacked the physical requirements of a line officer\r\nand all had had business or professional careers in civil life.\r\n\r\nOperating duplicate training facilities for officer candidates was\r\ncostly, and the bureau decided shortly after the first group of black\r\ncandidates was trained that future candidates of both races would be\r\ntrained together. By early summer ten more Negroes, this time\r\ncivilians with special professional qualifications, had been trained\r\nwith whites and were commissioned as staff officers in the Medical,\r\nDental, Chaplain, Civil Engineer, and Supply Corps. These twenty-two\r\nmen were the first of some sixty Negroes to be commissioned during the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nSince only a handful of the Negroes in the Navy were officers, the\r\npreponderance of the race problems concerned relations between black\r\nenlisted men and their white officers. The problem of selecting the\r\nproper officers to command black sailors was a formidable one never\r\nsatisfactorily solved during the war. As in the Army, most of the\r\nwhite officers routinely selected for such assignments were\r\nsoutherners, chosen by the Bureau of Naval Personnel for their assumed\r\n\"understanding\" of Negroes rather than for their general competency.\r\nThe Special Programs Unit tried to work with these officers, assembling\r\nthem for conferences to discuss the best techniques and procedures for\r\ndealing with groups of black subordinates. Members of the unit sought\r\nto disabuse the officers of preconceived biases, constantly reminding\r\nthem that \"our prejudices must be subordinated to our traditional  (p. 083)\r\nunfailing obedience to orders.\"[3-78] Although there was ample proof\r\nthat many Negroes actively resented the paternalism exhibited by many\r\nof even the best of these officers, this fact was slow to filter\r\nthrough the naval establishment. It was not until January 1944 that an\r\nofficer who had compiled an enviable record in training Seabee units\r\ndescribed how his organization had come to see the light:\r\n\r\n     We in the Seabees no longer follow the precept that southern\r\n     officers exclusively should be selected for colored battalions. A\r\n     man may be from the north, south, east or west. If his attitude\r\n     is to do the best possible job he knows how, regardless of what\r\n     the color of his personnel is, that is the man we want as an\r\n     officer for our colored Seabees. We have learned to steer clear\r\n     of the \"I'm from the South--I know how to handle 'em variety.\" It\r\n     follows with reference to white personnel, that deeply accented\r\n     southern whites are not generally suited for Negro\r\n     battalions.[3-79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-78: Quoted in Record of \"Conference With\r\n                   Regard to Negro Personnel,\" held at Hq, Fifth Naval\r\n                   District, 26 Oct 43, Incl to Ltr, Chief, NavPers,\r\n                   to All Sea Frontier Cmds et al., 5 Jan 44, sub:\r\n                   Negro Personnel--Confidential Report of Conference\r\n                   With Regard to the Handling of, Pers 1013, BuPers\r\n                   Recs. The grotesque racial attitudes of some\r\n                   commanders, as well as the thoughtful questions and\r\n                   difficult experiences of others, were fully aired\r\n                   at this conference.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-79: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nFurther complicating the task of selecting suitable officers for black\r\nunits was the fact that when the Bureau of Naval Personnel asked unit\r\ncommanders to recommend men for such duty many commanders used the\r\noccasion to rid themselves of their least desirable officers. The\r\nSpecial Programs Unit then tried to develop its own source of officers\r\nfor black units. It discovered a fine reservoir of talent among the\r\nwhite noncommissioned officers who ran the physical training and drill\r\ncourses at Great Lakes. These were excellent instructors, mature and\r\nexperienced in dealing with people. In January 1944 arrangements were\r\nmade to commission them and to assign them to black units.\r\n\r\nImprovement in the quality of officers in black units was especially\r\nimportant because the attitude of local commanders was directly\r\nrelated to the degree of segregation in living quarters and\r\nrecreational facilities, and such segregation was the most common\r\nsource of racial tension. Although the Navy's practice of segregating\r\nunits clearly invited separate living and recreational facilities, the\r\nrules were unwritten, and local commanders had been left to decide the\r\nextent to which segregation was necessary. Thus practices varied\r\ngreatly and policy depended ultimately on the local commanders. Rather\r\nthan attack racial practices at particular bases, the unit decided to\r\nconcentrate on the officers. It explained to these leaders the Navy's\r\npolicy of equal treatment and opportunity, a concept basically\r\nincompatible with many of their practices.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was embodied in a pamphlet entitled _Guide to the\r\nCommand of Negro Naval Personnel_ and published by the Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel in February 1944.[3-80] The Special Programs Unit had to\r\novercome much opposition within the bureau to get the pamphlet\r\npublished. Some thought the subject of racial tension was best\r\nignored; others objected to the \"sociological\" content of the work,\r\nconsidering this approach outside the Navy's province. The unit    (p. 084)\r\nargued that racial tension in the Navy was a serious problem that\r\ncould not be ignored, and since human relations affected the Navy's\r\nmission the Navy should deal with social matters objectively and\r\nfrankly.[3-81]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-80: NavPers 15092, 12 Feb 44.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-81: \"BuPers Hist,\" pt. II, pp. 2-3.]\r\n\r\nScholarly and objective, the pamphlet was an important document in the\r\nhistory of race relations in the Navy. In language similar to that\r\nused in the War Department's pamphlet on race, the Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel stated officially for the first time that discrimination\r\nflowed of necessity out of the doctrine of segregation:\r\n\r\n     The idea of compulsory racial segregation is disliked by almost\r\n     all Negroes, and literally hated by many. This antagonism is in\r\n     part a result of the fact that as a principle it embodies a\r\n     doctrine of racial inferiority. It is also a result of the lesson\r\n     taught the Negro by experience that in spite of the legal formula\r\n     of \"separate but equal\" facilities, the facilities open to him\r\n     under segregation are in fact usually inferior as to location or\r\n     quality to those available to others.[3-82]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-82: NavPers 15092, 12 Feb 44, p. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe guide also foreshadowed the end of the old order of things: \"The\r\nNavy accepts no theories of racial differences in inborn ability, but\r\nexpects that every man wearing its uniform be trained and used in\r\naccordance with his maximum individual capacity determined on the\r\nbasis of individual performance.\"[3-83]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-83: Ibid., p. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forrestal Takes the Helm_\r\n\r\nThe Navy got a leader sympathetic to the proposition of equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity for Negroes, and possessed of the\r\nbureaucratic skills to achieve reforms, when President Roosevelt\r\nappointed Under Secretary James Forrestal to replace Frank Knox, who\r\ndied suddenly on 28 April 1944. During the next five years Forrestal,\r\na brilliant, complex product of Wall Street, would assume more and\r\nmore responsibility for directing the integration effort in the\r\ndefense establishment. Although no racial crusader, Forrestal had been\r\nfor many years a member of the National Urban League, itself a pillar\r\nof the civil rights establishment. He saw the problem of employing\r\nNegroes as one of efficiency and simple fair play, and as the months\r\nwent by he assumed an active role in experimenting with changes in the\r\nNavy's policy.[3-84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-84: See Columbia University Oral Hist\r\n                   Interv with Granger; USAF Oral History Program,\r\n                   Interview with James C. Evans, 24 Apr 73.]\r\n\r\nHis first experiment was with sea duty for Negroes. After the\r\nexperience of the _Mason_ and the other segregated ships which\r\nactually proved very little, sentiment for a partial integration of\r\nthe fleet continued to grow in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. As early\r\nas April 1943, officers in the Planning and Control Activity\r\nrecommended that Negroes be included in small numbers in the crews of\r\nthe larger combat ships. Admiral Jacobs, however, was convinced that\r\n\"you couldn't dump 200 colored boys on a crew in battle,\"[3-85] so this\r\nand similar proposals later in the year never survived passage through\r\nthe bureau.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-85: Interv, Lee Nichols with Vice Adm\r\n                   Randall Jacobs, 29 Mar 53, in Nichols Collection,\r\n                   CMH.]\r\n\r\nForrestal accepted Jacob's argument that as long as the war        (p. 085)\r\ncontinued any move toward integrating the fighting ships was\r\nimpractical. At the same time, he agreed with the Special Programs\r\nUnit that large concentrations of Negroes in shore duties lowered\r\nefficiency and morale. Forrestal compromised by ordering the bureau to\r\nprepare as an experiment a plan for the integration of some fleet\r\nauxiliary ships. On 20 May 1944 he outlined the problem for the\r\nPresident:\r\n\r\n\"From a morale standpoint, the Negroes resent the fact that they are\r\nnot assigned to general service billets at sea, and white personnel\r\nresent the fact that Negroes have been given less hazardous\r\nassignments.\" He explained that at first Negroes would be used only on\r\nthe large auxiliaries, and their number would be limited to not more\r\nthan 10 percent of the ship's complement. If this step proved\r\nworkable, he planned to use Negroes in small numbers on other types of\r\nships \"as necessity indicates.\" The White House answered: \"OK,\r\nFDR.\"[3-86]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-86: Memo, SecNav for President, 20 May\r\n                   44, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nSecretary Forrestal also won the support of the Chief of Naval\r\nOperations for the move, but Admiral King still considered integration\r\nin the fleet experimental and was determined to keep strict control\r\nuntil the results were known. On 9 August 1944 King informed the\r\ncommanding officers of twenty-five large fleet auxiliaries that\r\nNegroes would be assigned to them in the near future. As Forrestal had\r\nsuggested, King set the maximum number of Negroes at 10 percent of the\r\nship's general service. Of this number, 15 percent would be\r\nthird-class petty officers from shore activities, selected as far as\r\npossible from volunteers and, in any case, from those who had served\r\nthe longest periods of shore duty. Of the remainder, 43 percent would\r\nbe from Class A schools and 42 percent from recruit training. The\r\nbasic 10 percent figure proved to be a theoretical maximum; no ship\r\nreceived that many Negroes.\r\n\r\nAdmiral King insisted that equal treatment in matters of training,\r\npromotion, and duty assignments must be accorded all hands, but he\r\nleft the matter of berthing to the commanding officers, noting that\r\nexperience had proved that in the shore establishment, when the\r\npercentage of blacks to whites was small, the two groups could be\r\nsuccessfully mingled in the same compartments. He also pointed out\r\nthat a thorough indoctrination of white sailors before the arrival of\r\nthe Negroes had been useful in preventing racial friction ashore.[3-87]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-87: Ltr, CNO to CO, USS _Antaeus_ et al.,\r\n                   9 Aug 44, sub: Negro Enlisted Personnel--Assignment\r\n                   of to Ships of the Fleet, P16-3/MM, OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\nKing asked all commanders concerned in the experiment to report their\r\nexperiences.[3-88] Their judgment: integration in the auxiliary fleet\r\nworked. As one typical report related after several months of\r\nintegrated duty:\r\n\r\n     The crew was carefully indoctrinated in the fact that Negro\r\n     personnel should not be subjected to discrimination of any sort\r\n     and should be treated in the same manner as other members of the\r\n     crew.\r\n\r\n     The Negro personnel when they came aboard were berthed\r\n     indiscriminately throughout the crew's compartments in the same\r\n     manner as if they had been white. It is felt that the\r\n     assimilation of the general service Negro personnel aboard this\r\n     ship has been remarkably successful. To the present date      (p. 086)\r\n     there has been no report of any difficulty which could be\r\n     laid to their color. It is felt that this is due in part, at\r\n     least, to the high calibre of Negroes assigned to this ship.[3-89]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-88: Idem to Cmdr, _Antaeus_ et al., 9 Jan\r\n                   45, P16-3, OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-89: Ltr, CO, USS _Antaeus_, to Chief,\r\n                   NavPers, 16 Jan 45, sub: Negro Enlisted\r\n                   Personnel--Assignment of to Ships of the Fleet,\r\n                   Ag67/P16-3/MM; see also Memo, Cmdr D.

All in OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\nThe comments of his commanders convinced King that the auxiliary\r\nvessels in the fleet could be integrated without incident. He approved\r\na plan submitted by the Chief of Naval Personnel on 6 March 1945 for\r\nthe gradual assignment of Negroes to all auxiliary vessels, again in\r\nnumbers not to exceed 10 percent of the general service billets in any\r\nship's complement.[3-90] A month later Negroes were being so assigned in\r\nan administratively routine manner.[3-91] The Bureau of Naval Personnel\r\nthen began assigning black officers to sea duty on the integrated\r\nvessels. The first one went to the _Mason_ in March, and in succeeding\r\nmonths others were sent in a routine manner to auxiliary vessels\r\nthroughout the fleet.[3-92] These assignments were not always carried\r\nout according to the bureau's formula. The commander of the USS\r\n_Chemung_, for example, told a young black ensign:\r\n\r\n     I'm a Navy Man, and we're in a war. To me, it's that stripe that\r\n     counts--and the training and leadership that it is supposed to\r\n     symbolize.

In fact, the subject had\r\nbeen under discussion in the Navy Department for some two years. Soon\r\nafter the organization of the women's auxiliary, its director, Capt.\r\nMildred H. McAfee, had recommended that Negroes be accepted, arguing\r\nthat their recruitment would help to temper the widespread criticism\r\nof the Navy's restrictive racial policy. But the traditionalists in\r\nthe Bureau of Naval Personnel had opposed the move on the grounds that\r\nWAVES were organized to replace men, and since there were more than\r\nenough black sailors to fill all billets open to Negroes there was no\r\nneed to recruit black women.\r\n\r\nActually, both arguments served to mask other motives, as did Knox's\r\nrejection of recruitment on the grounds that integrating women into\r\nthe Navy was difficult enough without taking on the race           (p. 087)\r\nproblem.[3-94] In April 1943 Knox \"tentatively\" approved the \"tentative\"\r\noutline of a bureau plan for the induction of up to 5,000 black WAVES,\r\nbut nothing came of it.[3-95] Given the secretary's frequent\r\nprotestation that the subject was under constant review,[3-96] and his\r\nstatement to Captain McAfee that black WAVES would be enlisted \"over\r\nhis dead body,\"[3-97] the tentative outline and approval seems to have\r\nbeen an attempt to defer the decision indefinitely.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-94: Ltr, Mildred M.

Dewey's charge in a Chicago\r\nspeech during the presidential campaign that the White House was\r\ndiscriminating against black women.

The program turned out to be more racially progressive than\r\ninitially outlined by Forrestal. He had explained to the President\r\nthat the women would be quartered separately, a provision          (p. 088)\r\ninterpreted in the Bureau of Naval Personnel to mean that black\r\nrecruits would be organized into separate companies. Since a recruit\r\ncompany numbered 250 women, and since it quickly became apparent that\r\nsuch a large group of black volunteers would not soon be forthcoming,\r\nsome of the bureau staff decided that the Navy would continue to bar\r\nblack women. In this they reckoned without Captain McAfee who insisted\r\non a personal ruling by Forrestal. She warned the secretary that his\r\norder was necessary because the concept \"was so strange to Navy\r\npractice.\"[3-103] He agreed with her that the Negroes would be\r\nintegrated along with the rest of the incoming recruits, and the\r\nBureau of Naval Personnel subsequently ordered that the WAVES be\r\nassimilated without making either special or separate arrangements.[3-104]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-103: Oral History Interview, Mildred\r\n                   McAfee Horton, 25 Aug 69, Center of Naval History.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-104: Ltr, Asst Chief, NavPers, to CO,\r\n                   NavTraScol (WR), Bronx, N.Y., 8 Dec 44, sub:\r\n                   Colored WAVE Recruits, Pers-107, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIEUTENANT PICKENS AND ENSIGN WILLS. _First black WAVE\r\nofficers, members of the final graduating class at Naval Reserve\r\nMidshipmen's School (WR), Northhampton, Massachusetts._]\r\n\r\nBy July 1945 the Navy had trained seventy-two black WAVES at Hunter\r\nCollege Naval Training School in a fully integrated and routine\r\nmanner. Although black WAVES were restricted somewhat in specialty\r\nassignments and a certain amount of separate quartering within\r\nintegrated barracks prevailed at some duty stations, the Special\r\nPrograms Unit came to consider the WAVE program, which established a\r\nforceful precedent for the integration of male recruit training, its\r\nmost important wartime breakthrough, crediting Captain McAfee and her\r\nunbending insistence on equal treatment for the achievement.\r\n\r\nForrestal won the day in these early experiments, but he was a\r\nskillful administrator and knew that there was little hope for any\r\nfundamental social change in the naval service without the active\r\ncooperation of the Navy's high-ranking officers. His meeting with\r\nAdmiral King on the subject of integration in the summer of 1944 has\r\nbeen reported by several people. Lester Granger, who later became\r\nForrestal's special representative on racial matters, recalled:\r\n\r\n     He [Forrestal] said he spoke to Admiral King, who was then chief\r\n     of staff, and said, \"Admiral King, I'm not satisfied with the\r\n     situation here--I don't think that our Navy Negro personnel are\r\n     getting a square break. I want to do something about it, but I\r\n     can't do anything about it unless the officers are behind me. I\r\n     want your help. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n     He said that Admiral King sat for a moment, and looked out    (p. 089)\r\n     the window and then said reflectively, \"You know, we say that\r\n     we are a democracy and a democracy ought to have a democratic\r\n     Navy. I don't think you can do it, but if you want to try, I'm\r\n     behind you all the way.\" And he told me, \"And Admiral King was\r\n     behind me, all the way, not only he but all of the Bureau of\r\n     Personnel, BuPers.

As he put it: \"Certain officers will be\r\ntemperamentally better suited for such commands than others.\"[3-108] The\r\nqualifications of these officers were to be kept under constant    (p. 090)\r\nreview. In December he singled out the commands in the Pacific area,\r\nwhich had a heavy concentration of all-black base companies, calling\r\nfor a reform in their employment and advancement of Negroes.[3-109]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-107: Intervs, Lee Nichols with Adm Louis\r\n                   E.

In March 1944 it had already made black cooks and bakers\r\neligible for duty in all commissary branches of the Navy.[3-110] In June\r\nit got Forrestal's approval for putting all rated cooks and stewards\r\nin chief petty officer uniforms.[3-111] (While providing finally for the\r\nproper uniforming of the chief cooks and stewards, this reform set\r\ntheir subordinates, the rated cooks and stewards, even further apart\r\nfrom their counterparts in the general service who of course continued\r\nto wear the familiar bell bottoms.) The bureau also began to attack\r\nthe concentration of Negroes in ammunition depots and base companies.\r\nOn 21 February 1945 it ordered that all naval magazines and ammunition\r\ndepots in the United States and, wherever practical, overseas limit\r\ntheir black seamen to 30 percent of the total employed.[3-112] It  (p. 091)\r\nalso organized twenty logistic support companies to replace the\r\nformless base companies sent to the Pacific in the early months of the\r\nrecruitment program. Organized to perform supply functions, each\r\ncompany consisted of 250 enlisted men and five officers, with a\r\nflexible range of petty officer billets.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-110: BuPers Cir Ltr 72-44, 13 Mar 44,\r\n                   sub: Negro Personnel of the Commissary Branch,\r\n                   Assignment to Duty of.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-111: Idem, 182-44, 29 Jun 44, \"Uniform\r\n                   for Chief Cooks and Chief Stewards and Cooks and\r\n                   Stewards.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-112: Idem, 45-18, 21 Feb 45, and 45-46,\r\n                   31 May 45, sub: Negro Enlisted\r\n                   Personnel--Limitation on Assignment of to Naval\r\n                   Ammunition Depots and Naval Magazines.]\r\n\r\nIn the reform atmosphere slowly permeating the Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel, the Special Programs Unit found it relatively easy to end\r\nsegregation in the specialist training program.[3-113] From the first,\r\nthe number of Negroes eligible for specialist training had been too\r\nsmall to make costly duplication of equipment and services practical.\r\nIn 1943, for example, the black aviation metalsmith school at Great\r\nLakes had an average enrollment of eight students. The school was\r\nquietly closed and its students integrated with white students. Thus,\r\nwhen the _Mason's_ complement was assembled in early 1944, Negroes\r\nwere put into the destroyer school at Norfolk side by side with\r\nwhites, and the black and white petty officers were quartered\r\ntogether. As a natural consequence of the decision to place Negroes in\r\nthe auxiliary fleet, the Bureau of Naval Personnel opened training in\r\nseagoing rates to Negroes on an integrated basis. Citing the\r\npracticality of the move, the bureau closed the last of the black\r\nschools in June 1945.[3-114]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-113: There is some indication that\r\n                   integration was already going on unofficially in\r\n                   some specialist schools; see Ltr, Dr. M.

For example, a\r\nproposal to make the logistic support companies interracial, or at\r\nleast to create comparable white companies to remove the stigma of\r\nsegregated manual labor, failed to survive the objections of the\r\nenlisted personnel section. The Bureau of Naval Personnel rejected a\r\nsuggestion that Negroes be assigned to repair units on board ships and\r\nto LST's, LCI's, and LCT's during the expansion of the amphibious\r\nprogram. On 30 August 1944 Admiral King rejected a bureau\r\nrecommendation that the crews of net tenders and mine ships be\r\nintegrated. He reasoned that these vessels were being kept in\r\nreadiness for overseas assignment and required \"the highest degree of\r\nexperienced seamanship and precision work\" by the crews. He also cited\r\nthe crowded living quarters and less experienced officers as further\r\nreasons for banning Negroes.[3-115]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-115: Memo, CNO for Chief, NavPers, 30 Aug\r\n                   44, sub: Negro Personnel--Assignment to ANs and\r\n                   YMs, P13-/MM, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nThere were other examples of backsliding in the Navy's racial\r\npractices. Use of Negroes in general service had created a shortage of\r\nmessmen, and in August 1944 the Bureau of Naval Personnel authorized\r\ncommanders to recruit among black seamen for men to transfer to the\r\nSteward's Branch. The bureau suggested as a talking point the fact (p. 092)\r\nthat stewards enjoyed more rapid advancement, shorter hours, and\r\neasier work than men in the general service.[3-116] And, illustrating\r\nthat a move toward integration was sometimes followed by a step\r\nbackward, a bureau representative reported in July 1945 that whereas a\r\nfew black trainees at the Bainbridge Naval Training Center had been\r\nintegrated in the past, many now arriving were segregated in all-black\r\ncompanies.[3-117]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-116: BuPers Cir Ltr 227-44, 12 Aug 44,\r\n                   sub: Steward's Branch, Procurement of From\r\n                   General-Service Negroes.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-117: Memo, Lt William H.

The\r\nSpecial Programs Unit had for some time been convinced that only full\r\nintegration would eliminate discrimination and dissolve racial\r\ntensions in the Navy, and it had understood Forrestal's desire \"to do\r\nsomething\" for the Negro to mean just that. Some senior commanders and\r\ntheir colleagues in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, on the other hand,\r\nwhile accepting the need for reform and willing to accept some racial\r\nmixing, nevertheless rejected any substantial change in the policy of\r\nrestricted employment of Negroes on the grounds that it might disrupt\r\nthe wartime fleet. Both sides could argue with assurance since\r\nForrestal and King had not made their positions completely clear.\r\nWhatever the secretary's ultimate intention, the reforms carried out\r\nin 1944 were too little and too late. Perhaps nothing would have been\r\nsufficient, for the racial incidents visited upon the Navy during the\r\nlast year of the war were symptomatic of the overwhelming\r\ndissatisfaction Negroes felt with their lot in the armed forces. There\r\nhad been incidents during the Knox period, but investigation had\r\nfailed to isolate any \"single, simple cause,\" and troubles continued\r\nto occur during 1944.[3-118]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-118: \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 75.]\r\n\r\nThree of these incidents gained national prominence.[3-119] The first\r\nwas a mutiny at Mare Island, California, after an explosion destroyed\r\ntwo ammunition ships loading at nearby Port Chicago on 17 July 1944.\r\nThe explosion killed over 300 persons, including 250 black seamen who\r\nhad toiled in large, segregated labor battalions. The survivors\r\nrefused to return to work, and fifty of them were convicted of mutiny\r\nand sentenced to prison. The incident became a _cause celebre_.\r\nFinally, through the intervention of the black press and black\r\norganizations and the efforts of Thurgood Marshall and Lester Granger,\r\nthe convictions were set aside and the men restored to active duty.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-119: Nelson, \"Integration of the Negro,\"\r\n                   ch. VIII.]\r\n\r\nA riot on Guam in December 1944 was the climax of months of friction\r\nbetween black seamen and white marines. A series of shootings in and\r\naround the town of Agana on Christmas Eve left a black and a white\r\nmarine dead. Believing one of the killed a member of their group,\r\nblack sailors from the Naval Supply Depot drove into town to confront\r\nthe outnumbered military police. No violence ensued, but the next day\r\ntwo truckloads of armed Negroes went to the white Marine camp. A riot\r\nfollowed and forty-three Negroes were arrested, charged with rioting\r\nand theft of the trucks, and sentenced to up to four years in prison.\r\nThe authorities also recommended that several of the white marines (p. 093)\r\ninvolved be court-martialed. These men too were convicted of various\r\noffenses and sentenced.[3-120] Walter White went to Guam to\r\ninvestigate the matter and appeared as a principal witness before the\r\nMarine Court of Inquiry. There he pieced together for officials the\r\nlong history of discrimination suffered by men of the base company.\r\nThis situation, combined with poor leadership in the unit, he\r\nbelieved, caused the trouble. His efforts and those of other civil\r\nrights advocates led to the release of the black sailors in early\r\n1946.[3-121]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-120: Henry I.

There was\r\nno violence. The thousand strikers continued to work but refused to\r\neat for two days. The resulting publicity forced the Navy to\r\ninvestigate the charges; as a result, the commanding officer, the\r\nfocus of the grievance, was replaced and the outfit sent overseas.\r\n\r\nThe riots, mutinies, and other incidents increased the pressure for\r\nfurther modifications of policy. Some senior officers became convinced\r\nthat the only way to avoid mass rebellion was to avert the         (p. 094)\r\npossibility of collective action, and collective action was less\r\nlikely if Negroes were dispersed among whites. As Admiral Chester W.\r\nNimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet and an eloquent proponent of\r\nthe theory that integration was a practical means of avoiding trouble,\r\nexplained to the captain of an attack cargo ship who had just received\r\na group of black crewmen and was segregating their sleeping quarters:\r\n\"If you put all the Negroes together they'll have a chance to share\r\ngrievances and to plot among themselves, and this will damage\r\ndiscipline and morale. If they are distributed among other members of\r\nthe crew, there will be less chance of trouble. And when we say we\r\nwant integration, we mean _integration_.\"[3-122] Thus integration grew\r\nout of both idealism and realism.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-122: As quoted in White, _A Man Called\r\n                   White_, p. 273. For a variation on this theme, see\r\n                   Interv, Nichols with Hillenkoetter.]\r\n\r\nIf racial incidents convinced the admirals that further reforms were\r\nnecessary, they also seem to have strengthened Forrestal's resolve to\r\nintroduce a still greater change in his department's policy. For\r\nmonths he had listened to the arguments of senior officials and naval\r\nexperts that integration of the fleet, though desirable, was\r\nimpossible during the war. Yet Forrestal had seen integration work on\r\nthe small patrol craft, on fleet auxiliaries, and in the WAVES. In\r\nfact, integration was working smoothly wherever it had been tried.\r\nAlthough hard to substantiate, the evidence suggests that it was in\r\nthe weeks after the Guam incident that the secretary and Admiral King\r\nagreed on a policy of total integration in the general service. The\r\nchange would be gradual, but the progress would be evident and the end\r\nassured--Negroes were going to be assigned as individuals to all\r\nbranches and billets in the general service.[3-123]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-123: Ltr, Rear Adm Hillenkoetter to\r\n                   Nichols, 22 May 53; see also Intervs, Nichols with\r\n                   Granger, Hillenkoetter, Jacobs, Thomas Darden,\r\n                   Dillon, and other BuPers officials. In contrast to\r\n                   the Knox period, where the files are replete with\r\n                   Secretary of the Navy memos, BuPers letters, and\r\n                   General Board reports on the development of the\r\n                   Navy's racial policy, there is scant documentation\r\n                   on the same subject during the early months of the\r\n                   Forrestal administration. This is understandable\r\n                   because the subject of integration was extremely\r\n                   delicate and not readily susceptible to the usual\r\n                   staffing needed for most policy decisions.\r\n                   Furthermore, Forrestal's laconic manner of\r\n                   expressing himself, famous in bureaucratic\r\n                   Washington, inhibited the usual flow of letters and\r\n                   memos.]\r\n\r\nForrestal and King received no end of advice. In December 1944 a group\r\nof black publicists called upon the secretary to appoint a civilian\r\naide to consider the problems of the Negro in the Navy. The group also\r\nadded its voice to those within the Navy who were suggesting the\r\nappointment of a black public relations officer to disseminate news of\r\nparticular interest to the black press and to improve the Navy's\r\nrelations with the black community.[3-124] One of Forrestal's assistants\r\nproposed that an intradepartmental committee be organized to\r\nstandardize the disparate approaches to racial problems throughout the\r\nnaval establishment; another recommended the appointment of a black\r\ncivilian to advise the Bureau of Naval Personnel; and still another\r\nrecommended a white assistant on racial affairs in the office of the\r\nunder secretary.[3-125]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-124: Ltr, John H. Sengstacke to\r\n                   Forrestal, 19 Dec 44, 54-1-9, GenRecsNav; Interv,\r\n                   Nichols with Granger.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-125: Memo, Under Sec Bard for SecNav, 1\r\n                   Jan 45; Memo, H Struve Hensel (Off of Gen Counsel)\r\n                   for Forrestal, 5 Jan 45; both in 54-1-9, Forrestal\r\n                   file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nThese ideas had merit. The Special Programs Unit had for some time\r\nbeen urging a public relations effort, pointing to the existence of\r\nan influential black press as well as to the desirability of       (p. 095)\r\nfostering among whites a greater knowledge of the role of Negroes in\r\nthe war. Forrestal brought two black officers to Washington for\r\npossible assignment to public relations work, and he asked the\r\ndirector of public relations to arrange for black newsmen to visit\r\nvessels manned by black crewmen. Finally, in June 1945, a black\r\nofficer was added to the staff of the Navy's Office of Public\r\nRelations.[3-126]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-126: Memo, SecNav for Eugene Duffield\r\n                   (Asst to Under Sec), 16 Jan 45, 54-1-9; idem for\r\n                   Rear Adm A.

Granger\r\nbegan his long association with the Department of Defense, an\r\nassociation that would span the military's integration effort.[3-129]\r\nGranger's assignment was straightforward. From time to time he would\r\nmake extensive trips representing the secretary and his special\r\ninterest in racial problems at various naval stations.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-127: Quoted in Forrestal, \"Remarks for\r\n                   Dinner of Urban League.\"]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-128: Ltr, SecNav to Lester Granger, 1 Feb\r\n                   45, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-129: Ltrs, Granger to Forrestal, 19 Mar\r\n                   and 3 Apr 45, 54-1-13, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.\r\n                   Granger and Forrestal had attended Dartmouth\r\n                   College, but not together as Forrestal thought.

Granger believed in relating the Navy's\r\nracial problems not to questions of fairness but to questions of\r\nsurvival, comfort, and security for all concerned. He assumed that if\r\nleadership in any field came to understand that its privilege or its\r\nsecurity were threatened by denial of fairness to the less privileged,\r\nthen a meeting of minds was possible between the two groups. They\r\nwould begin to seek a way to eliminate insecurity, and from the\r\nprocess of eliminating insecurity would come fairness. As Granger\r\nexplained it, talk to the commander about his loss of efficient\r\nproduction, not the shame of denying a Negro a man's right to a job.\r\nTalk about the social costs that come from denial of opportunity and\r\ntalk about the penalty that the privileged pay almost in equal measure\r\nto what the Negro pays, but in different coin. Only then would one\r\nbegin to get a hearing. On the other hand, talk to Negroes not about\r\nachieving their rights but about making good on an opportunity. This\r\nwould lead to a discussion of training, of ways to override barriers\r\n\"by maintaining themselves whole.\"[3-130] The Navy was going to get a\r\nlesson in race relations, Urban League style.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-130: Columbia University Oral Hist Interv\r\n                   with Granger.]\r\n\r\nAt Forrestal's request, Granger explained how he viewed the special\r\nadviser's role. He thought he could help the secretary by smoothing\r\nthe integration process in the general service through consultations\r\nwith local commanders and their men in a series of field visits. He\r\ncould also act as an intermediary between the department and the civil\r\nrights organizations and black press. Granger urged the formation  (p. 096)\r\nof an advisory council, which would consist of ranking representatives\r\nfrom the various branches, to interpret and administer the Navy's\r\nracial policy. The need for such intradepartmental coordination seemed\r\nfairly obvious. Although in 1945 the Bureau of Naval Personnel had\r\nincreased the resources of its Special Programs Unit, still the only\r\nspecialized organization dealing with race problems, that group was\r\nalways too swamped with administrative detail to police race problems\r\noutside Washington. Furthermore, the Seabees and the Medical and\r\nSurgery Department were in some ways independent of the bureau, and\r\ntheir employment of black sailors was different from that of other\r\nbranches--a situation that created further confusion and conflict in\r\nthe application of race policy.[3-131]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-131: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for Cmdr\r\n                   Richard M.

II,\r\n                   p. 3.]\r\n\r\nAssuming that the advisory council would require an executive agent,\r\nGranger suggested that the secretary have a full-time assistant for\r\nrace relations in addition to his own part-time services. He wanted\r\nthe man to be black and he wanted him in the secretary's office, which\r\nwould give him prestige in the black community and increase his power\r\nto deal with the bureaus. Forrestal rejected the idea of a council and\r\na full-time assistant, pleading that he must avoid creating another\r\nformal organization. Instead he decided to assemble an informal\r\ncommittee, which he invited Granger to join, to standardize the Navy's\r\nhandling of Negroes.[3-132]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-132: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 19 Mar 45;\r\n                   Ltrs, SecNav to Granger, 26 Mar and 5 Apr 45.

He would\r\nlater call the Navy's wartime reforms \"a start down a long road.\"[3-133]\r\nIn these last months of the war, however, more barriers to equal\r\ntreatment of Negroes were quietly falling. In March 1945, after months\r\nof prodding by Forrestal, the Surgeon General announced that the Navy\r\nwould accept a \"reasonable\" number of qualified black nurses and was\r\nnow recruiting for them.[3-134] In June the Bureau of Naval Personnel\r\nordered the integration of recruit training, assigning black general\r\nservice recruits to the nearest recruit training command \"to obtain\r\nthe maximum utilization of naval training and housing facilities.\"[3-135]\r\nNoting that this integration was at variance with some individual\r\nattitudes, the bureau justified the change on the grounds of\r\nadministrative efficiency. Again at the secretary's urging, plans were\r\nset in motion in July for the assignment of Negroes to submarine and\r\naviation pilot training.[3-136] At the same time Lester Granger, acting\r\nas the secretary's personal representative, was visiting the       (p. 097)\r\nNavy's continental installations, prodding commanders and converting\r\nthem to the new policy.[3-137]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-133: Ltr, Forrestal to Marshall Field III\r\n                   (publisher of _PM_), 14 Jul 45, 54-1-13, Forrestal\r\n                   file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-134: Memo, SecNav for Rear Adm W.

At first Negroes were restricted to service as\r\nmessmen, but political pressure forced the Navy to open general\r\nservice billets to them. In this the influence of the civil rights\r\nspokesmen was paramount. They and their allies in Congress and the\r\nnational political parties led President Roosevelt to demand an end to\r\nexclusion and the Navy to accept Negroes for segregated general\r\nservice. The presence of large numbers of black inductees and the\r\nlimited number of assignments for them in segregated units prevented\r\nthe Bureau of Naval Personnel from providing even a semblance of\r\nseparate but equal conditions. Deteriorating black morale and the\r\nspecter of racial disturbance drove the bureau to experiment with\r\nall-black crews, but the experiment led nowhere. The Navy could never\r\noperate a separate but equal fleet. Finally in 1944 Forrestal began to\r\nexperiment with integration in seagoing assignments.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the civil rights forces can be overstated. Their\r\nattention tended to focus on the Army, especially in the later years\r\nof the war; their attacks on the Navy were mostly sporadic and\r\nuncoordinated and easily deflected by naval spokesmen. Equally\r\nimportant to race reform was the fact that the Navy was developing its\r\nown group of civil rights advocates during the war, influential men in\r\nkey positions who had been dissatisfied with the prewar status of the\r\nNegro and who pressed for racial change in the name of military\r\nefficiency. Under the leadership of a sympathetic secretary,       (p. 098)\r\nhimself aided and abetted by Stevenson and other advisers in his\r\noffice and in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Navy was laying plans\r\nfor a racially integrated general service when Japan capitulated.\r\n\r\nTo achieve equality of treatment and opportunity, however, takes more\r\nthan the development of an integration policy. For one thing, the\r\nliberalization of policy and practices affected only a relatively\r\nsmall percentage of the Negroes in the Navy. On V-J day the Navy could\r\ncount 164,942 enlisted Negroes, 5.37 percent of its total enlisted\r\nstrength.[3-138] More than double the prewar percentage, this figure was\r\nstill less than half the national ratio of blacks to whites. In August\r\n1945 the Navy had 60 black officers, 6 of whom were women (4 nurses\r\nand 2 WAVES), and 68 enlisted WAVES who were not segregated. The\r\nintegration of the Navy officer corps, the WAVES, and the nurses had\r\nan immediate effect on only 128 people. Figures for black enlisted men\r\nshow that they were employed in some sixty-seven ratings by the end of\r\nthe war, but steward and steward's mate ratings accounted for some\r\n68,000 men, about 40 percent of the total black enlistment.\r\nApproximately 59,000 others were ordinary seamen, some were recruits\r\nin training or specialists striking for ratings, but most were\r\nassigned to the large segregated labor units and base companies.[3-139]\r\nHere again integrated service affected only a small portion of the\r\nNavy's black recruits during World War II.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-138: Pers 215-BL, \"Enlisted\r\n                   Strength--U.S. Navy,\" 26 Jul 46, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-139: Pers 215-12-EL, \"Number of Negro\r\n                   Enlisted Personnel on Active Duty,\" 29 Nov 45\r\n                   (statistics as of 31 Oct 45), BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a real chance existed that even this limited progress\r\nmight prove to be temporary. On V-J day the Regular Navy had 7,066\r\nNegroes, just 2.14 percent of its total.[3-140] Many of these men could\r\nbe expected to stay in the postwar Navy, but the overwhelming majority\r\nof them were in the separate Steward's Branch and would remain there\r\nafter the war. Black reservists in the wartime general service would\r\nhave to compete with white regulars and reservists for the severely\r\nreduced number of postwar billets and commissions in a Navy in which\r\nalmost all members would have to be regulars. Although Lester Granger\r\nhad stressed this point in conversations with James Forrestal, neither\r\nthe secretary nor the Bureau of Naval Personnel took the matter up\r\nbefore the end of the war. In short, after setting in motion a number\r\nof far-reaching reforms during the war, the Navy seemed in some danger\r\nof settling back into its old prewar pattern.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 3-140: Pers-215-BL, \"Enlisted\r\n                   Strength--U.S. Navy,\" 26 Jul 46.]\r\n\r\nStill, the fact that reforms had been attempted in a service that had\r\nso recently excluded Negroes was evidence of progress. Secretary\r\nForrestal was convinced that the Navy's hierarchy had swung behind the\r\nprinciple of equal treatment and opportunity, but the real test was\r\nyet to come. Hope for a permanent change in the Navy's racial\r\npractices lay in convincing its tradition-minded officers that an\r\nintegrated general service with a representative share of black\r\nofficers and men was a matter of military efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4                                                          (p. 099)\r\n\r\nWorld War II: The Marine Corps and the Coast Guard\r\n\r\n\r\nThe racial policies of both the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard were\r\nsubstantially the same as the Navy policy from which they were\r\nderived, but all three differed markedly from each other in their\r\npractical application. The differences arose partly from the\r\nparticular mission and size of these components of the wartime Navy,\r\nbut they were also governed by the peculiar legal relationship that\r\nexisted in time of war between the Navy and the other two services.\r\n\r\nBy law the Marine Corps was a component of the Department of the Navy,\r\nits commandant subordinate to the Secretary of the Navy in such\r\nmatters as manpower and budget and to the Chief of Naval Operations in\r\nspecified areas of military operations. In the conduct of ordinary\r\nbusiness, however, the commandant was independent of the Navy's\r\nbureaus, including the Bureau of Naval Personnel. The Marine Corps had\r\nits own staff personnel officer, similar to the Army's G-1, and, more\r\nimportant for the development of racial policy, it had a Division of\r\nPlans and Policies that was immediately responsible to the commandant\r\nfor manpower planning. In practical terms, the Marine Corps of World\r\nWar II was subject to the dictates of the Secretary of the Navy for\r\ngeneral policy, and the secretary's 1942 order to enlist Negroes\r\napplied equally to the Marine Corps, which had no Negroes in its\r\nranks, and to the Navy, which did. At the same time, the letters and\r\ndirectives of the Chief of Naval Operations and the Chief of Naval\r\nPersonnel implementing the secretary's order did not apply to the\r\ncorps. In effect, the Navy Department imposed a racial policy on the\r\ncorps, but left it to the commandant to carry out that policy as he\r\nsaw fit. These legal distinctions would become more important as the\r\nNavy's racial policy evolved in the postwar period.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Guard's administrative position had early in the war become\r\nroughly analogous to that of the Marine Corps. At all times a branch\r\nof the armed forces, the Coast Guard was normally a part of the\r\nTreasury Department. A statute of 1915, however, provided that during\r\nwartime or \"whenever the President may so direct\" the Coast Guard\r\nwould operate as part of the Navy, subject to the orders of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy.[4-1] At the direction of the President, the Coast\r\nGuard passed to the control of the Secretary of the Navy on 1 November\r\n1941 and so remained until 1 January 1946.[4-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-1: 38 _U.S. Stat. at L_ (1915), 800-2.\r\n                   Since 1967 the Coast Guard has been a part of the\r\n                   Department of Transportation.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-2: Executive Order 8928, 1 Nov 41. A\r\n                   similar transfer under provisions of the 1915 law\r\n                   was effected during World War I. The service's\r\n                   predecessor organizations, the Revenue Marine,\r\n                   Revenue Service, Revenue-Marine Service, and the\r\n                   Revenue Cutter Service, had also provided the Navy\r\n                   with certain specified ships and men during all\r\n                   wars since the Revolution.]\r\n\r\nAt first a division under the Chief of Naval Operations, the       (p. 100)\r\nheadquarters of the Coast Guard was later granted considerably more\r\nadministrative autonomy. In March 1942 Secretary Knox carefully\r\ndelineated the Navy's control over the Coast Guard, making the Chief\r\nof Naval Operations responsible for the operation of those Coast Guard\r\nships, planes, and stations assigned to the naval commands for the\r\n\"proper conduct of the war,\" but specifying that assignments be made\r\nwith \"due regard for the needs of the Coast Guard,\" which must\r\ncontinue to carry out its regular functions. Such duties as providing\r\nport security, icebreaking services, and navigational aid remained\r\nunder the direct control and supervision of the commandant, the local\r\nnaval district commander exercising only \"general military control\" of\r\nthese activities in his area.[4-3] Important to the development of\r\nracial policy was the fact that the Coast Guard also retained\r\nadministrative control of the recruitment, training, and assignment of\r\npersonnel. Like the Marine Corps, it also had a staff agency for\r\nmanpower planning, the Commandant's Advisory Board, and one for\r\nadministration, the Personnel Division, independent of the Navy's\r\nbureaus.[4-4] In theory, the Coast Guard's manpower policy, at least in\r\nregard to those segments of the service that operated directly under\r\nNavy control, had to be compatible with the racial directives of the\r\nNavy's Bureau of Naval Personnel. In practice, the Commandant of the\r\nCoast Guard, like his colleague in the Marine Corps, was left free to\r\ndevelop his own racial policy in accordance with the general\r\ndirectives of the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval\r\nOperations.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-3: Ltr, SecNav to CominCh-CNO, 30 Mar 42,\r\n                   sub: Administration of Coast Guard When Operating\r\n                   Under Navy Department, quoted in Furer,\r\n                   _Administration of the Navy Department in World War\r\n                   II_, pp. 608-10.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-4: For a survey of the organization and\r\n                   functions of the U.S. Coast Guard Personnel\r\n                   Division, see USCG Historical Section, _Personnel_,\r\n                   The Coast Guard at War, 25:16-27.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Black Marines_\r\n\r\nThese legal distinctions had no bearing on the Marine Corps' prewar\r\nracial policy, which was designed to continue its tradition of\r\nexcluding Negroes. The views of the commandant, Maj. Gen. Thomas\r\nHolcomb, on the subject of race were well known in the Navy. Negroes\r\ndid not have the \"right\" to demand a place in the corps, General\r\nHolcomb told the Navy's General Board when that body was considering\r\nthe expansion of the corps in April 1941. \"If it were a question of\r\nhaving a Marine Corps of 5,000 whites or 250,000 Negroes, I would\r\nrather have the whites.\"[4-5] He was more circumspect but no more\r\nreasonable when he explained the racial exclusion publicly. Black\r\nenlistment was impractical, he told one civil rights group, because\r\nthe Marine Corps was too small to form racially separate units.[4-6]\r\nAnd, if some Negroes persisted in trying to volunteer after Pearl\r\nHarbor, there was another deterrent, described by at least one senior\r\nrecruiter: the medical examiner was cautioned to disqualify the black\r\napplicant during the enlistment physical.[4-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-5: Quoted in Navy General Board, \"Plan\r\n                   for the Expansion of the USMC,\" 18 Apr 41 (No.\r\n                   139), Recs of Gen Bd, OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-6: Ltr, CMC to Harold E.

According to Secretary Knox the President wanted the\r\nNavy to handle the matter \"in a way that would not inject into the\r\nwhole personnel of the Navy the race question.\"[4-8] Under pressure to\r\nmake some move, General Holcomb proposed the enlistment of 1,000\r\nNegroes in the volunteer Marine Corps Reserve for duty in the general\r\nservice in a segregated composite defense battalion. The battalion\r\nwould consist primarily of seacoast and antiaircraft artillery, a\r\nrifle company with a light tank platoon, and other weapons units and\r\ncomponents necessary to make it a self-sustaining unit.[4-9] To inject\r\nthe subject of race \"to a less degree than any other known scheme,\"\r\nthe commandant planned to train the unit in an isolated camp and\r\nassign it to a remote station.[4-10] The General Board accepted this\r\nproposal, explaining to Secretary Knox that Negroes could not be used\r\nin the Marine Corps' amphibious units because the inevitable\r\nreplacement and redistribution of men in combat would \"prevent the\r\nmaintenance of necessary segregation.\" The board also mentioned that\r\nexperienced noncommissioned officers were at a premium and that\r\ndiverting them to train a black unit would be militarily\r\ninefficient.[4-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-8: Memo, SecNav for Adm W.

Samuel A. Woods, Jr. The corps had wanted to avoid having to\r\ntrain men as typists, truck drivers, and the like--specialist skills\r\nneeded in the black composite unit. Instead, the commandant\r\nestablished black quotas for three of the four recruiting divisions,\r\nspecifying that more than half the recruits qualify in the needed\r\nskills.[4-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-12: Memo, CMC for District Cmdrs, All\r\n                   Reserve Districts Except 10th, 14th, 15th, and\r\n                   16th, 25 May 42, sub: Enlistment of Colored\r\n                   Personnel in the Marine Corps, Historical and\r\n                   Museum Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps\r\n                   (hereafter Hist Div, HQMC).

The commandant reported   (p. 102)\r\nthat despite predictions of black educators to the contrary the corps\r\nhad netted only sixty-three black recruits capable of passing the\r\nentrance examinations during the first three weeks of recruitment.[4-14]\r\nAs late as 29 October the Director of Plans and Policies was reporting\r\nthat only 647 of the scheduled 1,200 men (the final strength figure\r\ndecided upon for the all-black unit) had been enlisted. He blamed the\r\noccupational qualifications for the delay, adding that it was doubtful\r\n\"if even white recruits\" could be procured under such strictures. The\r\ncommandant approved his plan for enlisting Negroes without specific\r\nqualifications and instituting a modified form of specialist training.\r\nBlack marines would not be sent to specialist schools \"unless there is\r\na colored school available,\" but instead Marine instructors would be\r\nsent to teach in the black camp.[4-15] In the end many of these first\r\nblack specialists received their training in nearby Army\r\ninstallations.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-14: Memo, CMC for SecNav, 23 Jun 42,\r\n                   AP-54 (1535-110), MC files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-15: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 29 Oct 42, sub: Enlistment of Colored\r\n                   Personnel in the Marine Corps Reserve, AO-320, MC\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nSegregation was the common practice in all the services in 1942,   (p. 103)\r\nas indeed it was throughout much of American society. If this practice\r\nappeared somehow more restrictive in the Marine Corps than it did in\r\nthe other services, it was because of the corps' size and traditions.\r\nThe illusion of equal treatment and opportunity could be kept alive in\r\nthe massive Army and Navy with their myriad units and military\r\noccupations; it was much more difficult to preserve in the small and\r\nspecialized Marine Corps. Given segregation, the Marine Corps was\r\nobliged to put its few black marines in its few black units, whose\r\nsmall size limited the variety of occupations and training\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nYet the size of the corps would undergo considerable change, and on\r\nbalance it was the Marine Corps' tradition of an all-white service,\r\nnot its restrictive size, that proved to be the most significant\r\nfactor influencing racial policy. Again unlike the Army and Navy, the\r\nMarine Corps lacked the practical experience with black recruits that\r\nmight have countered many of the alarums and prejudices concerning\r\nNegroes that circulated within the corps during the war. The\r\nimportance of this experience factor comes out in the reminiscences of\r\na senior official in the Division of Plans and Policies who looked\r\nback on his 1942 experiences:\r\n\r\n     It just scared us to death when the colored were put on it. I\r\n     went over to Selective Service and saw Gen. Hershey, and he\r\n     turned me over to a lieutenant colonel [Campbell C.\r\n     Johnson]--that was in April--and he was one grand person. I told\r\n     him, \"Eleanor [Mrs. Roosevelt] says we gotta take in Negroes, and\r\n     we are just scared to death, we've never had any in, we don't\r\n     know how to handle them, we are afraid of them.\" He said, \"I'll\r\n     do my best to help you get good ones. I'll get the word around\r\n     that if you want to die young, join the Marines. So anybody that\r\n     joins is got to be pretty good!\" And it was the truth. We got\r\n     some awfully good Negroes.[4-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-16: USMC Oral History Interview, General\r\n                   Ray A. Robinson (USMC Ret.), 18-19 Mar 68, p. 136,\r\n                   Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the peace of mind of the Marine Corps' personnel\r\nplanner, the conception of a carefully limited and isolated black\r\ncontingent was quickly overtaken by events. The President's decision\r\nto abolish volunteer enlistments for the armed forces in December 1942\r\nand the subsequent establishment of a black quota for each component\r\nof the naval establishment meant that in the next year some 15,400\r\nmore Negroes, 10 percent of all Marine Corps inductees, would be added\r\nto the corps.[4-17] As it turned out the monthly draft calls were never\r\ncompletely filled, and by December 1943 only 9,916 of the scheduled\r\nblack inductions had been completed, but by the time the corps stopped\r\ndrafting men in 1946 it had received over 16,000 Negroes through the\r\nSelective Service. Including the 3,129 black volunteers, the number of\r\nNegroes in the Marine Corps during World War II totaled 19,168,\r\napproximately 4 percent of the corps' enlisted men.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-17: Memo, CMC for Chief, NavPers, 1 Apr\r\n                   43, sub: Negro Registrants To Be Inducted Into the\r\n                   Marine Corps, AO-320-2350-60, MC files.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate problem of what to do with this sudden influx of Negroes\r\nwas complicated by the fact that many of the draftees, the product of\r\nvastly inferior schooling, were incompetent. Where black volunteers\r\nhad to pass the corps' rigid entrance requirements, draftees had   (p. 104)\r\nonly to meet the lowest selective service standards. An exact\r\nbreakdown of black Marine Corps draftees by General Classification\r\nTest category is unavailable for the war period. A breakdown of some\r\n15,000 black enlisted men, however, was compiled ten weeks after V-J\r\nday and included many of those drafted during the war. Category I\r\nrepresents the most gifted men:[4-18]\r\n\r\n  Category:      I      II     III      IV       V\r\n  Percentage:   0.11   5.14   24.08   59.63    11.04\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-18: Memo, Dir, Pers, for Dir, Div of\r\n                   Plans and Policies, 21 Jul 48, sub: GCT Percentile\r\n                   Equivalents for Colored Enlisted Marines in\r\n                   November 1945 and in March 1948, sub file: Negro\r\n                   Marines--Test and Testing, Ref Br, Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nIf these figures are used as a base, slightly more than 70 percent of\r\nall black enlisted men, more than 11,000, scored in the two lowest\r\ncategories, a meaningless racial statistic in terms of actual numbers\r\nbecause the smaller percentage of the much larger group of white\r\ndraftees in these categories gave the corps more whites than blacks in\r\ngroups IV and V. Yet the statistic was important because low-scoring\r\nNegroes, unlike the low-scoring whites who could be scattered\r\nthroughout the corps' units, had to be concentrated in a small number\r\nof segregated units to the detriment of those units. Conversely, the\r\ncorps had thousands of Negroes with the mental aptitude to serve in\r\nregular combat units and a small but significant number capable of\r\nbecoming officers. Yet these men were denied the opportunity to serve\r\nin combat or as officers because the segregation policy dictated that\r\nNegroes could not be assigned to a regular combat unit unless all the\r\nbillets in that unit as well as all replacements were black--a\r\npractical impossibility during World War II.\r\n\r\nSegregation, not the draft, forced the Marine Corps to devise new jobs\r\nand units to absorb the black inductees. A plan circulated in the\r\nDivision of Plans and Policies called for more defense battalions, a\r\nbranch for messmen, and the assignment of large black units to local\r\nbases to serve as chauffeurs, messengers, clerks, and janitors.\r\nReferring to the janitor assignment, one division official admitted\r\nthat \"I don't think we can get away with this type duty.\"[4-19] In the\r\nend the Negroes were not used as chauffeurs, messengers, clerks, and\r\njanitors. Instead the corps placed a \"maximum practical number\" in\r\ndefense battalions. The number of these units, however, was limited,\r\nas Maj. Gen. Harry Schmidt, the acting commandant, explained in March\r\n1943, by the number of black noncommissioned officers available. Black\r\nnoncommissioned officers were necessary, he continued, because in the\r\nArmy's experience \"in nearly all cases to intermingle colored and\r\nwhite enlisted personnel in the same organization\" led to \"trouble and\r\ndisorder.\"[4-20] Demonstrating his own and the Marine Corps' lack of\r\nexperience with black troops, the acting commandant went on to provide\r\nhis commanders with some rather dubious advice based on what he\r\nperceived as the Army's experience: black units should be commanded by\r\nmen \"who thoroughly knew their [Negroes'] individual and racial    (p. 105)\r\ncharacteristics and temperaments,\" and Negroes should be assigned to\r\nwork they preferred.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-19: Unsigned Memo for Dir, Plans and\r\n                   Policies Div, 26 Dec 42, sub: Colored Personnel,\r\n                   with attached handwritten note, AO-320, MC files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-20: Ltr, Actg CMC to Major Cmdrs, 20 Mar\r\n                   43, sub: Colored Personnel, AP-361, MC files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORE PARTY IN TRAINING, CAMP LEJEUNE, 1942.]\r\n\r\nThe points emphasized in General Schmidt's letter to Marine\r\ncommanders--a rigid insistence on racial separation and a willingness\r\nto work for equal treatment of black troops--along with an\r\nacknowledgement of the Marine Corps' lack of experience with racial\r\nproblems were reflected in Commandant Holcomb's basic instruction on\r\nthe subject of Negroes two months later: \"All Marines are entitled to\r\nthe same rights and privileges under Navy Regulations,\" and black\r\nmarines could be expected \"to conduct themselves with propriety and\r\nbecome a credit to the Marine Corps.\" General Holcomb was aware of the\r\nadverse effect of white noncommissioned officers on black morale, and\r\nhe wanted them removed from black units as soon as possible. Since the\r\nemployment of black marines was in itself a \"new departure,\" he wanted\r\nto be informed periodically on how Negroes adapted to Marine Corps\r\nlife, what their off-duty experience was with recreational facilities,\r\nand what their attitude was toward other marines.[4-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-21: Ltr of Instruction No. 421, CMC to\r\n                   All CO's, 14 May 43, sub: Colored Personnel, MC\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D-DAY ON PELELIU. _Support troops participate in the\r\nlanding of 1st Marine Division._]\r\n\r\nThese were generally progressive sentiments, evidence of the\r\ncommandant's desire to provide for the peaceful assimilation and\r\nadvancement of Negroes in the corps. Unfortunately for his reputation\r\namong the civil rights advocates, General Holcomb seemed overly\r\nconcerned with certain social implications of rank and color.      (p. 106)\r\nUndeterred by a lack of personal experience with interracial command,\r\nhe was led in the name of racial harmony to an unpopular conclusion.\r\n\"It is essential,\" he told his commanders, \"that in no case shall\r\nthere be colored noncommissioned officers senior to white men in the\r\nsame unit, and desirable that few, if any be of the same rank.\"[4-22]\r\nHe was particularly concerned with the period when white instructors\r\nand noncommissioned officers were being phased out of black units. He\r\nwanted Negroes up for promotion to corporal transferred, before\r\npromotion, out of any unit that contained white corporals.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-22: Ibid.

Job preference had\r\nalready figured in the organization of the new Messman's Branch\r\nestablished in January 1943. At that time Secretary Knox had approved\r\nthe reconstitution of the corps' all-white Mess Branch as the\r\nCommissary Branch and the organization of an all-black Messman's\r\nBranch along the lines of the Navy's Steward's Branch.[4-23] In    (p. 107)\r\nauthorizing the new branch, which was quickly redesignated the\r\nSteward's Branch to conform to the Navy model, Secretary Knox\r\nspecified that the members must volunteer for such duty. Yet the\r\ncorps, under pressure to produce large numbers of stewards in the\r\nearly months of the war, showed so little faith in the volunteer\r\nsystem that Marine recruiters were urged to induce half of all black\r\nrecruits to sign on as stewards.[4-24] Original plans called for the\r\nassignment of one steward for every six officers, but the lack of\r\nvolunteers and the needs of the corps quickly caused this estimate to\r\nbe scaled down.[4-25] By 5 July 1944 the Steward's Branch numbered (p. 108)\r\n1,442 men, roughly 14 percent of the total black strength of the\r\nMarine Corps.[4-26] It remained approximately this size for the rest\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-23: Memo, CMC for SecNav, 30 Dec 42, sub:\r\n                   Change of Present Mess Branch in the Marine Corps\r\n                   to Commissary Branch and Establishment of a\r\n                   Messman's Branch and Ranks Therein, with SecNav\r\n                   approval indicated, AO-363-311.

But the\r\nrealities of the Pacific war and the draft quickly rendered these\r\nplans obsolete. As the United States gained the ascendancy, the need\r\nfor defense battalions rapidly declined, just as the need for special\r\nlogistical units to move supplies in the forward areas increased. The\r\ncorps had originally depended on its replacement battalions to move\r\nthe mountains of supply involved in amphibious assaults, but the\r\nconstant flow of replacements to battlefield units and the need for\r\nmen with special logistical skill had led in the middle of the war to\r\nthe organization of pioneer battalions. To supplement the work of\r\nthese shore party units and to absorb the rapidly growing number of\r\nblack draftees, the Division of Plans and Policies eventually created\r\nfifty-one separate depot companies and twelve separate ammunition\r\ncompanies manned by Negroes. The majority of these new units served in\r\nbase and service depots, handling ammunition and hauling supplies, but\r\na significant number of them also served as part of the shore parties\r\nattached to the divisional assault units. These units often worked\r\nunder enemy fire and on occasion joined in the battle as they moved\r\nsupplies, evacuated the wounded, and secured the operation's supply\r\ndumps.[4-27] Nearly 8,000 men, about 40 percent of the corps' black\r\nenlistment, served in this sometimes hazardous combat support duty.\r\nThe experience of these depot and ammunition companies provided the\r\nMarine Corps with an interesting irony. In contrast to Negroes in the\r\nother services, black marines trained for combat were never so used.\r\nThose trained for the humdrum labor tasks, however, found themselves\r\nin the thick of the fighting on Saipan, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and\r\nelsewhere, suffering combat casualties and winning combat citations\r\nfor their units.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-27: Shaw and Donnelly, _Blacks in the\r\n                   Marine Corps_, pp. 29-46. See also, HQMC Div of\r\n                   Public Information, \"The Negro Marine, 1942-1945,\"\r\n                   Ref Br, Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nThe increased allotment of black troops entering the corps and the\r\ncommandant's call for replacing all white noncommissioned officers\r\nwith blacks as quickly as they could be sufficiently trained caused\r\nproblems for the black combat units. The 51st Defense Battalion in\r\nparticular suffered many vicissitudes in its training and deployment.\r\nThe 51st was the first black unit in the Marine Corps, a doubtful\r\nadvantage considering the frequent reorganization and rapid troop\r\nturnover that proved its lot. At first the reception and training of\r\nall black inductees fell to the battalion, but in March 1943 a\r\nseparate Headquarters Company, Recruit Depot Battalion, was organized\r\nat Montford Point.[4-28] Its cadre was drawn from the 51st, as     (p. 109)\r\nwere the noncommissioned officers and key personnel of the newly\r\norganized ammunition and depot companies and the black security\r\ndetachments organized at Montford Point and assigned to the Naval\r\nAmmunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, and the Philadelphia Depot of\r\nSupplies.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-28: Memo, CO, 51st Def Bn, for Dir, Plans\r\n                   and Policies, 29 Jan 43, sub: Colored Personnel,\r\n                   Ref Br, Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nIn effect, the 51st served as a specialist training school for the\r\nblack combat units. When the second black defense battalion, the 52d,\r\nwas organized in December 1943 its cadre, too, was drawn from the\r\n51st. By the time the 51st was actually deployed, it had been\r\nreorganized several times and many of its best men had been siphoned\r\noff as leaders for new units. To compound these losses of experienced\r\nmen, the battalion was constantly receiving large influxes of\r\ninexperienced and educationally deficient draftees and sometimes there\r\nwas infighting among its officers.[4-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-29: For charges and countercharges on the\r\n                   part of the 51st's commanders, see Hq, 51st Defense\r\n                   Bn, \"Record of Proceedings of an Investigation,\" 27\r\n                   Jun 44; Memo, Lt Col Floyd A.

All in Ref Br, Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nTraining for black units only emphasized the rigid segregation\r\nenforced in the Marine Corps. After their segregated eight-week\r\nrecruit training, the men were formed into companies at Montford\r\nPoint; those assigned to the defense battalions were sent for\r\nspecialist training in the weapons and equipment employed in such\r\nunits, including radar, motor transport, communications, and artillery\r\nfire direction. Each of the ammunition companies sent sixty of its men\r\nto special ammunition and camouflage schools where they would be\r\npromoted to corporal when they completed the course. In contrast to\r\nthe depot companies and elements of the defense battalions, the\r\nammunition units would have white staff sergeants as ordnance\r\nspecialists throughout the war. This exception to the rule of black\r\nnoncommissioned officers for black units was later justified on the\r\ngrounds that such units required experienced supervisors to emphasize\r\nand enforce safety regulations.[4-30] On the whole specialist training\r\nwas segregated; whenever possible even the white instructors were\r\nrapidly replaced by blacks.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-30: Shaw and Donnelly, _Blacks in the\r\n                   Marine Corps_, p. 31.]\r\n\r\nBefore being sent overseas, black units underwent segregated field\r\ntraining, although the length of this training varied considerably\r\naccording to the type of unit. Depot companies, for example, were\r\nlabor units pure and simple, organized to perform simple tasks, and\r\nmany of them were sent to the Pacific less than two weeks after\r\nactivation. In contrast, the 51st Defense Battalion spent two months\r\nin hard field training, scarcely enough considering the number of raw\r\nrecruits, totally unfamiliar with gunnery, that were being fed\r\nregularly into what was essentially an artillery battalion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUN CREW OF THE 52D DEFENSE BATTALION _on duty, Central\r\nPacific, 1945_.]\r\n\r\nThe experience of the two defense battalions demonstrates that racial\r\nconsideration governed their eventual deployment just as it had\r\ndecided their organization. With no further strategic need for defense\r\nbattalions, the Marine Corps began to dismantle them in 1944, just as\r\nthe two black units became operational and were about to be sent to\r\nthe Central and South Pacific. The eighteen white defense          (p. 110)\r\nbattalions were subsequently reorganized as antiaircraft artillery\r\nbattalions for use with amphibious groups in the forward areas. While\r\nthe two black units were similarly reorganized, only they and one of\r\nthe white units retained the title of defense battalion. Their\r\ndeployment was also different. The policy of self-contained,\r\nsegregated service was, in the case of a large combat unit, best\r\nfollowed in the rear areas, and the two black battalions were assigned\r\nto routine garrison duties in the backwaters of the theater, the 51st\r\nat Eniwetok in the Marshalls, the 52d at Guam. The latter unit saw\r\nnearly half its combat-trained men detailed to work as stevedores. It\r\nwas not surprising that the morale in both units suffered.[4-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-31: For a discussion of black morale in\r\n                   the combat-trained units, see USMC Oral History\r\n                   Interview, Obie Hall, 16 Aug 72, Ref Br, and John\r\n                   H.

Both in Hist Div,\r\n                   HQMC.]\r\n\r\nEven more explicitly racial was the warning of a senior combat\r\ncommander to the effect that the deployment of black depot units to\r\nthe Polynesian areas of the Pacific should be avoided. The Polynesians,\r\nhe explained, were delightful people, and their \"primitively romantic\"\r\nwomen shared their intimate favors with one and all. Mixture with the\r\nwhite race had produced \"a very high-class half-caste,\" mixture with\r\nthe Chinese a \"very desirable type,\" but the union of black and\r\n\"Melanesian types ... produces a very undesirable citizen.\" The    (p. 111)\r\nMarine Corps, Maj. Gen. Charles F. B. Price continued, had a special\r\nmoral obligation and a selfish interest in protecting the population\r\nof American Samoa, especially, from intimacy with Negroes; he strongly\r\nurged therefore that any black units deployed to the Pacific should be\r\nsent to Micronesia where they \"can do no racial harm.\"[4-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-32: Ltr, Maj Gen Charles F. B. Price to\r\n                   Brig Gen Keller E. Rockey, 24 Apr 43; 26132, Ref\r\n                   Br, Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Price must have been entertaining second thoughts, since two\r\ndepot companies were already en route to Samoa at his request.\r\nNevertheless, because of the \"importance\" of his reservations the\r\nmatter was brought to the attention of the Director of Plans and\r\nPolicies.[4-33] As a result, the assignment of the 7th and 8th Depot\r\nCompanies to Samoa proved short-lived. Arriving on 13 October 1943,\r\nthey were redeployed to the Ellice Islands in the Micronesia group the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-33: Brig Gen Rockey for S-C files, 4 Jun\r\n                   43, Memo, G.

That\r\nso many black marines participated, at least from time to time, in the\r\nfighting may explain in part the fact that relatively few racial\r\nincidents took place in the corps during the war. But if many Negroes\r\nserved in forward areas, they were all nevertheless severely\r\nrestricted in opportunity. Black marines were excluded from the corps'\r\ncelebrated combat divisions and its air arm. They were also excluded\r\nfrom the Women's Reserve, and not until the last months of the war did\r\nthe corps accept its first black officer candidates. Marine spokesmen\r\njustified the latter exclusion on the grounds that the corps lacked\r\nfacilities--that is, segregated facilities--for training black\r\nofficers.[4-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-34: Ltr, Phillips D.

For more on\r\n                   black officers in the Marine Corps, see Chapter 9.]\r\n\r\nThese exclusions did not escape the attention of the civil rights\r\nspokesmen who took their demands to Secretary Knox and the White\r\nHouse.[4-35] It was to little avail. With the exception of the officer\r\ncandidates in 1945, the separation of the races remained absolute, and\r\nNegroes continued to be excluded from the main combat units of the\r\nMarine Corps.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-35: See, for example, Ltr, Mary Findley\r\n                   Allen, Interracial Cmte of Federation of Churches,\r\n                   to Mrs. Roosevelt (ca. 9 Mar 43); Memo, SecNav for\r\n                   Rear Adm Jacobs, 22 Mar 43, P-25; Memo, R.

A small, specialized, and racially exclusive\r\norganization, the Marine Corps reacted to the directives of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy and the necessities of wartime operation with a\r\nrigid segregation policy, its black troops restricted to about 4\r\npercent of its enlisted strength. A large part of this black strength\r\nwas assigned to labor units where Negroes performed valuable and\r\nsometimes dangerous service in the Pacific war. Complaints from civil\r\nrights advocates abounded, but neither protests nor the cost to\r\nmilitary efficiency of duplicating training facilities were of     (p. 112)\r\nsufficient moment to overcome the sentiment against significant racial\r\nchange, which was kept to a minimum. Judged strictly in terms of\r\nkeeping racial harmony, the corps policy must be considered a success.\r\nIronically this very success prevented any modification of that policy\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREWMEN OF USCG LIFEBOAT STATION, PEA ISLAND, NORTH\r\nCAROLINA, _ready surf boat for launching_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_New Roles for Black Coast Guardsmen_\r\n\r\nThe Coast Guard's pre-World War II experience with Negroes differed\r\nfrom that of the other branches of the naval establishment. Unlike the\r\nMarine Corps, the Coast Guard could boast a tradition of black\r\nenlistment stretching far back into the previous century. Although it\r\nshared this tradition with the Navy, the Coast Guard, unlike the Navy,\r\nhad always severely restricted Negroes both in terms of numbers\r\nenlisted and jobs assigned. A small group of Negroes manned a\r\nlifesaving station at Pea Island on North Carolina's outer banks.\r\nNegroes also served as crewmen at several lighthouses and on tenders\r\nin the Mississippi River basin; all were survivors of the transfer of\r\nthe Lighthouse Service to the Coast Guard in 1939. These guardsmen\r\nwere almost always segregated, although a few served in integrated\r\ncrews or even commanded large Coast Guard vessels and small harbor (p. 113)\r\ncraft.[4-36] They also served in the separate Steward's Branch,\r\nalthough it might be argued that the small size of most Coast Guard\r\nvessels integrated in fact men who were segregated in theory.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-36: Capt. Michael Healy, who was of Irish\r\n                   and Afro-American heritage, served as commanding\r\n                   officer of the _Bear_ and other major Coast Guard\r\n                   vessels. At his retirement in 1903 Healy was the\r\n                   third ranking officer in the U.S. Revenue Cutter\r\n                   Service. See Robert E.

To a surprising extent the enlisted men of\r\nthe prewar Coast Guard were drawn from the eastern shore and outer\r\nbanks region of the Atlantic coast where service in the Coast Guard\r\nhad become a strong family tradition among a people whose attitude\r\ntoward race was rarely progressive. Although these men tolerated an\r\noccasional small black Coast Guard crew or station, they might well\r\nresist close service with individual Negroes. One commander reported\r\nthat racial harassment drove the solitary black in the prewar      (p. 114)\r\ncrew of the cutter _Calypso_ out of the service.[4-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-37: Interv, author with Capt W. C.\r\n                   Capron, USCGR, 20 Feb 75, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nCoast Guard officials were obviously mindful of such potential\r\ntroubles when, at Secretary Knox's bidding, they joined in the General\r\nBoard's discussion of the expanded use of Negroes in the general\r\nservice in January 1942. In the name of the Coast Guard, Commander\r\nLyndon Spencer agreed with the objections voiced by the Navy and the\r\nMarine Corps, adding that the Coast Guard problem was \"enhanced\r\nsomewhat by the fact that our units are small and contacts between the\r\nmen are bound to be closer.\" He added that while the Coast Guard was\r\nnot \"anxious to take on any additional problems at this time, if we\r\nhave to we will take some of them [Negroes].\"[4-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-38: Enlistment of Men of Colored Race\r\n                   (201), 23 Jan 42, Hearings Before the General Board\r\n                   of the Navy, 1942.]\r\n\r\nWhen President Roosevelt made it clear that Negroes were to be\r\nenlisted, Coast Guard Commandant Rear Adm. Russell R. Waesche had a\r\nplan ready. The Coast Guard would enlist approximately five hundred\r\nNegroes in the general service, he explained to the chairman of the\r\nGeneral Board, Vice Adm. Walton R. Sexton. Some three hundred of these\r\nmen would be trained for duty on small vessels, the rest for shore\r\nduty under the captain of the port of six cities throughout the United\r\nStates. Although his plan made no provision for the training of black\r\npetty officers, the commandant warned Admiral Sexton that 50 to 65\r\npercent of the crew in these small cutters and miscellaneous craft\r\nheld such ratings, and it followed that Negroes would eventually be\r\nallowed to try for such ratings.[4-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-39: Memo, Cmdt, CG, for Adm Sexton, Chmn\r\n                   of Gen Bd, 2 Feb 42, sub: Enlistment of Men of the\r\n                   Colored Race in Other Than Messman Branch, attached\r\n                   to Enlistment of Men of Colored Race (201), 23 Jan\r\n                   42, Hearings Before the General Board of the Navy,\r\n                   1942.]\r\n\r\nFurther refining the plan for the General Board on 24 February,\r\nAdmiral Waesche listed eighteen vessels, mostly buoy tenders and\r\npatrol boats, that would be assigned black crews. All black enlistees\r\nwould be sent to the Manhattan Beach Training Station, New York, for a\r\nbasic training \"longer and more extensive\" than the usual recruit\r\ntraining. After recruit training the men would be divided into groups\r\naccording to aptitude and experience and would undergo advanced\r\ninstruction before assignment. Those trained for ship duty would be\r\ngrouped into units of a size to enable them to go aboard and assume\r\nall but the petty officer ratings of the designated ships. The\r\ncommandant wanted to initiate this program with a group of 150 men. No\r\nother Negroes would be enlisted until the first group had been trained\r\nand assigned to duty for a period long enough to permit a survey of\r\nits performance. Admiral Waesche warned that the whole program was\r\nfrankly new and untried and was therefore subject to modification as\r\nit evolved.[4-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-40: Memo, Cmdt, CG, for Chmn of Gen Bd,\r\n                   24 Feb 42. sub: Enlistment of Men of the Colored\r\n                   Race in Other Than Messman Branch, P-701, attached\r\n                   to Recs of Gen Bd, No 421 (Serial 204-X),\r\n                   OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\nThe plan was a major innovation in the Coast Guard's manpower policy.\r\nFor the first time a number of Negroes, approximately 1.6 percent of\r\nthe guard's total enlisted complement, would undergo regular       (p. 115)\r\nrecruit and specialized training.[4-41] More than half would serve\r\naboard ship at close quarters with their white petty officers. The\r\nrest would be assigned to port duty with no special provision for\r\nsegregated service. If the provision for segregating nonrated Coast\r\nGuardsmen when they were at sea was intended to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of racial antagonism, the lack of a similar provision for\r\nNegroes ashore was puzzling; but whatever the Coast Guard's reasoning\r\nin the matter, the General Board was obviously concerned with the\r\nprovisions for segregation in the plan. Its chairman told Secretary\r\nKnox that the assignment of Negroes to the captains of the ports was a\r\npractical use of Negroes in wartime, since these men could be\r\nsegregated in service units. But their assignment to small vessels,\r\nAdmiral Sexton added, meant that \"the necessary segregation and\r\nlimitation of authority would be increasingly difficult to maintain\"\r\nand \"opportunities for advancement would be few.\" For that reason, he\r\nconcluded, the employment of such black crews was practical but not\r\ndesirable.[4-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-41: Unless otherwise noted, all\r\n                   statistics on Coast Guard personnel are derived\r\n                   from Memo, Chief, Statistical Services Div, for\r\n                   Chief, Pub Information Div, 30 Mar 54, sub: Negro\r\n                   Personnel, Officers and Enlisted; Number of, Office\r\n                   of the USCG Historian; and \"Coast Guard Personnel\r\n                   Growth Chart,\" _Report of the Secretary of the\r\n                   Navy-Fiscal 1945_, p.

The small\r\nsize of the black general service program precluded the establishment\r\nof a separate training station, but the Negroes were formed into a\r\nseparate training company at Manhattan Beach. While training classes\r\nand other duty activities were integrated, sleeping and messing\r\nfacilities were segregated. Although not geographically separated as\r\nwere the black sailors at Camp Smalls or the marines at Montford\r\nPoint, the black recruits of the separate training company at\r\nManhattan Beach were effectively impressed with the reality of\r\nsegregation in the armed forces.[4-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-43: Interv, author with Ira H.

Groups of black Coast\r\nGuardsmen, for example, were sent to the Pea Island Station after\r\ntheir recruit training for several weeks' training in beach duties.\r\nSimilar groups of white recruits were also sent to the Pea Island\r\nStation for training under the black chief boatswain's mate in\r\ncharge.[4-45] By August 1942 some three hundred Negroes had been\r\nrecruited, trained, and assigned to general service duties under the\r\nnew program. At the same time the Coast Guard continued to recruit\r\nhundreds of Negroes for its separate Steward's Branch.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-44: For a brief account of the Coast\r\n                   Guard recruit training program, see Nelson,\r\n                   \"Integration of the Negro,\" pp. 84-87, and \"A Black\r\n                   History in World War II,\" _Octagon_ (February\r\n                   1972): 31-32.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-45: Log of Pea Island Station, 1942,\r\n                   Berry Collection, USCG Headquarters.]\r\n\r\nThe commandant's program for the orderly induction and assignment  (p. 116)\r\nof a limited number of black volunteers was, as in the case of the\r\nNavy and Marine Corps, abruptly terminated in December 1942 when the\r\nPresident ended volunteer enlistment for most military personnel. For\r\nthe rest of the war the Coast Guard, along with the Navy and Marine\r\nCorps, came under the strictures of the Selective Service Act,\r\nincluding its racial quota system. The Coast Guard, however, drafted\r\nrelatively few men, issuing calls for a mere 22,500 and eventually\r\ninducting only 15,296. But more than 12 percent of its calls (2,500\r\nmen between February and November 1943) and 13 percent of all those\r\ndrafted (1,667) were Negro. On the average, 137 Negroes and 1,000\r\nwhites were inducted each month during 1943.[4-46] Just over 5,000\r\nNegroes served as Coast Guardsmen in World War II.[4-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-46: Selective Service System, _Special\r\n                   Groups_, 2:196-201.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-47: Testimony of Coast Guard\r\n                   Representatives Before the President's Committee on\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services, 18 Mar 49, p. 8.]\r\n\r\nAs it did for the Navy and Marine Corps, the sudden influx of Negroes\r\nfrom Selective Service necessitated a revision of the Coast Guard's\r\npersonnel planning. Many of the new men could be assigned to steward\r\nduties, but by January 1943 the Coast Guard already had some 1,500\r\nstewards and the branch could absorb only half of the expected black\r\ndraftees. The rest would have to be assigned to the general\r\nservice.[4-48] And here the organization and mission of the Coast Guard,\r\nfar more so than those of the Navy and Marine Corps, militated against\r\nthe formation of large segregated units. The Coast Guard had no use\r\nfor the amorphous ammunition and depot companies and the large Seabee\r\nbattalions of the rest of the naval establishment. For that reason the\r\nlarge percentage of its black seamen in the general service\r\n(approximately 37 percent of all black Coast Guardsmen) made a\r\nconsiderable amount of integration inevitable; the small number of\r\nNegroes in the general service (1,300 men, less than 1 percent of the\r\ntotal enlisted strength of the Coast Guard) made integration socially\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-48: USCG Public Relations Div, Negroes in\r\n                   the U.S. Coast Guard, July 1943, Office of the USCG\r\n                   Historian.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of black Coast Guardsmen were only peripherally concerned\r\nwith this wartime evolution of racial policy. Some 2,300 Negroes\r\nserved in the racially separate Steward's Branch, performing the same\r\nduties in officer messes and quarters as stewards in the Navy and\r\nMarine Corps. But not quite, for the size of Coast Guard vessels and\r\ntheir crews necessitated the use of stewards at more important battle\r\nstations. For example, a group of stewards under the leadership of a\r\nblack gun captain manned the three-inch gun on the afterdeck of the\r\ncutter _Campbell_ and won a citation for helping to destroy an enemy\r\nsubmarine in February 1943.[4-49] The Personnel Division worked to make\r\nthe separate Steward's Branch equal to the rest of the service in\r\nterms of promotion and emoluments, and there were instances when\r\nindividual stewards successfully applied for ratings in general\r\nservice.[4-50] Again, the close quarters aboard Coast Guard        (p. 117)\r\nvessels made the talents of stewards for general service duties more\r\nnoticeable to officers.[4-51] The evidence suggests, however, that the\r\nmajority of the black stewards, about 63 percent of all the Negroes in\r\nthe Coast Guard, continued to function as servants throughout the war.\r\nAs in the rest of the naval establishment, the stewards in the Coast\r\nGuard were set apart not only by their limited service but also by\r\ndifferent uniforms and the fact that chief stewards were not regarded\r\nas chief petty officers. In fact, the rank of chief steward was not\r\nintroduced until the war led to an enlargement of the Coast Guard.[4-52]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-49: Ltr, Cmdt, USCG, to Cmdr, Third CG\r\n                   District, 18 Jan 52, sub: ETHERIDGE, Louis C; ...\r\n                   Award of the Bronze Star Medal, P15, BuPersRecs;\r\n                   USCG Pub Rel Div, Negroes in the U.S. Coast Guard,\r\n                   Jul 43.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-50: USCG Pers Bull 37-42, 31 Mar 43, sub:\r\n                   Apprentice Seamen and Mess Attendants, Third Class,\r\n                   Advancement of, USCG Cen Files 61A701.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-51: Intervs, author with Cmdt Carlton\r\n                   Skinner, USCGR, 18 Feb 75, and with Capron, CMH\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-52: For discussion of limited service of\r\n                   Coast Guard stewards, see Testimony of Coast Guard\r\n                   Representatives Before the President's Committee on\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services, 18 Mar 49, pp. 27-31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEWARDS AT BATTLE STATION _on the afterdeck of the\r\ncutter Campbell_.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of black guardsmen in general service served ashore under\r\nthe captains of the ports, local district commanders, or at\r\nheadquarters establishments. Men in these assignments included\r\nhundreds in security and labor details, but more and more served as\r\nyeomen, radio operators, storekeepers, and the like. Other Negroes\r\nwere assigned to local Coast Guard stations, and a second all-black\r\nstation was organized during the war at Tiana Beach, New York. Still\r\nothers participated in the Coast Guard's widespread beach patrol   (p. 118)\r\noperations. Organized in 1942 as outposts and lookouts against\r\npossible enemy infiltration of the nation's extensive coastlines, the\r\npatrols employed more than 11 percent of all the Coast Guard's\r\nenlisted men. This large group included a number of horse and dog\r\npatrols employing only black guardsmen.[4-53] In all, some 2,400 black\r\nCoast Guardsmen served in the shore establishment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-53: USCG Historical Section, The Coast\r\n                   Guard at War, 18:1-10, 36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHORE LEAVE IN SCOTLAND. (_The distinctive uniform of\r\nthe Coast Guard steward is shown_.)]\r\n\r\nThe assignment of so many Negroes to shore duties created potential\r\nproblems for the manpower planners, who were under orders to rotate\r\nsea and shore assignments periodically.[4-54] Given the many black\r\ngeneral duty seamen denied sea duty because of the Coast Guard's\r\nsegregation policy but promoted into the more desirable shore-based\r\njobs to the detriment of whites waiting for rotation to such\r\nassignments, the possibility of serious racial trouble was obvious.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-54: USCG Pers Bull 44-42, 25 Jun 42, sub:\r\n                   Relief of Personnel Assigned to Seagoing Units,\r\n                   USCG Cen Files 61A701.]\r\n\r\nAt least one officer in Coast Guard headquarters was concerned enough\r\nto recommend that the policy be revised. With two years' service in\r\nGreenland waters, the last year as executive officer of the USCGC\r\n_Northland_, Lt. Carlton Skinner had firsthand experience with the\r\nlimitations of the Coast Guard's racial policy. While on the\r\n_Northland_ Skinner had recommended that a skilled black mechanic, (p. 119)\r\nthen serving as a steward's mate, be awarded a motor mechanic petty\r\nofficer rating only to find his recommendation rejected on racial\r\ngrounds. The rating was later awarded after an appeal by Skinner, but\r\nthe incident set the stage for the young officer's later involvement\r\nwith the Coast Guard's racial traditions. On shore duty at Coast Guard\r\nheadquarters in June 1943, Skinner recommended to the commandant that\r\na group of black seamen be provided with some practical seagoing\r\nexperience under a sympathetic commander in a completely integrated\r\noperation. He emphasized practical experience in an integrated\r\nsetting, he later revealed, because he was convinced that men with\r\nhigh test scores and specialized training did not necessarily make the\r\nbest sailors, especially when their training was segregated. Skinner\r\nenvisioned a widespread distribution of Negroes throughout the Coast\r\nGuard's seagoing vessels. His recommendation was no \"experiment in\r\nsocial democracy,\" he later stressed, but was a design for \"an\r\nefficient use of manpower to help win a war.\"[4-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-55: Interv, author with Skinner; Ltr,\r\n                   Skinner to author, 29 Jun 75, in CMH files. The\r\n                   Skinner memorandum to Admiral Waesche, like so many\r\n                   of the personnel policy papers of the U.S. Coast\r\n                   Guard from the World War II period, cannot be\r\n                   located.

In November 1943\r\nSkinner found himself transferred to the USS _Sea Cloud_ (IX 99), a\r\npatrol ship operating in the North Atlantic as part of Task Force 24\r\nreporting on weather conditions from four remote locations in northern\r\nwaters.[4-56] The commandant also arranged for the transfer of black\r\napprentice seamen, mostly from Manhattan Beach, to the _Sea Cloud_ in\r\ngroups of about twenty men, gradually increasing the number of black\r\nseamen in the ship's complement every time it returned to home\r\nstation. Skinner, promoted to lieutenant commander and made captain of\r\nthe _Sea Cloud_ on his second patrol, later decided that the\r\ncommandant had \"figured he could take a chance on me and the _Sea\r\nCloud_.\"[4-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-56: A unique vessel, the _Sea Cloud_ was\r\n                   on loan to the government for the duration of the\r\n                   war by its owner, the former Ambassador to Russia,\r\n                   Joseph Davies. Davies charged a nominal sum and\r\n                   extracted the promise that the vessel would be\r\n                   restored to its prewar condition as one of the\r\n                   world's most famous private yachts.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-57: Interv, author with Skinner.]\r\n\r\nIt was a chance well taken. Before decommissioning in November 1944,\r\nthe _Sea Cloud_ served on ocean weather stations off the coasts of\r\nGreenland, Newfoundland, and France. It received no special treatment\r\nand was subject to the same tactical, operating, and engineering\r\nrequirements as any other unit in the Navy's Atlantic Fleet. It passed\r\ntwo Atlantic Fleet inspections with no deficiencies and was officially\r\ncredited with helping to sink a German submarine in June 1944. The\r\n_Sea Cloud_ boasted a completely integrated operation, its 4 black\r\nofficers and some 50 black petty officers and seamen serving\r\nthroughout the ship's 173-man complement.[4-58] No problems of a racial\r\nnature arose on the ship, although its captain reported that his crew\r\nexperienced some hostility in the various departments of the Boston\r\nNavy Yard from time to time. Skinner was determined to provide truly\r\nintegrated conditions. He personally introduced his black officers (p. 120)\r\ninto the local white officers' club, and he saw to it that when his\r\nmen were temporarily detached for shore patrol duty they would go in\r\nintegrated teams. Again, all these arrangements were without sign of\r\nracial incident.[4-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-58: Log of the _Sea Cloud_ (IX 99),\r\n                   Aug-Nov 44, NARS, Suitland.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-59: Interv, author with Skinner.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMANDER SKINNER AND CREW OF THE USS SEA CLOUD.\r\n_Skinner officiates at awards ceremony._]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to assess the reasons for the commandant's decision to\r\norganize an integrated crew. One senior personnel officer later\r\nsuggested that the _Sea Cloud_ was merely a public relations device\r\ndesigned to still the mounting criticism by civil rights spokesmen of\r\nthe lack of sea duty for black Coast Guardsmen.[4-60] The public\r\nrelations advantage of an integrated ship operating in the war zone\r\nmust have been obvious to Admiral Waesche, although the Coast Guard\r\nmade no effort to publicize the _Sea Cloud_. In fact, this absence of\r\nspecial attention had been recommended by Skinner in his original\r\nproposal to the commandant. Such publicity, he felt, would disrupt the\r\nmilitary experiment and make it more difficult to apply generally the\r\nexperience gained.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-60: Interv, author with Rear Adm R. T.\r\n                   McElligott, 24 Feb 75, CMH files. For an example of\r\n                   the Coast Guard reaction to civil rights criticism,\r\n                   see Ltr, USCG Public Relations Officer to Douglas\r\n                   Hall, Washington _Afro-American_, July 12, 1943, CG\r\n                   051, Office of the USCG Historian.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the _Sea Cloud_ experiment did not lead to the\r\nwidespread integration implied in Commander Skinner's recommendation.\r\nThe only other extensively integrated Coast Guard vessel assigned to a\r\nwar zone was the destroyer escort _Hoquim_, operating in 1945 out  (p. 121)\r\nof Adak in the Aleutian Islands, convoying shipping along the Aleutian\r\nchain. Again, the commander of the ship was Skinner. Nevertheless the\r\npractical reasons for Skinner's first recommendation must also have\r\nbeen obvious to the commandant, and the evidence suggests that the\r\n_Sea Cloud_ project was but one of a series of liberalizing moves the\r\nCoast Guard made during the war, not only to still the criticism in\r\nthe black community but also to solve the problems created by the\r\npresence of a growing number of black seamen in the general service.\r\nThere is also reason to believe that the Coast Guard's limited use of\r\nracially mixed crews influenced the Navy's decision to integrate the\r\nauxiliary fleet in 1945. Senior naval officials studied a report on\r\nthe _Sea Cloud_, and one of Secretary Forrestal's assistants consulted\r\nSkinner on his experiences and their relation to greater manpower\r\nefficiency.[4-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-61: Ltr, Skinner to author, 2 Jun 75.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENSIGN JENKINS AND LIEUTENANT SAMUELS, _first black\r\nCoast Guard officers, on board the Sea Cloud_.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the war the Coast Guard never exhibited the concern shown\r\nby the other services for the possible disruptive effects if blacks\r\noutranked whites. As the war progressed, more and more blacks advanced\r\ninto petty officer ranks; by August 1945 some 965 Negroes, almost a\r\nthird of their total number, were petty or warrant officers, many of\r\nthem in the general service. Places for these trained specialists in\r\nany kind of segregated general service were extremely limited, and by\r\nthe last year of the war many black petty officers could be found\r\nserving in mostly white crews and station complements. For example, a\r\nblack pharmacist, second class, and a signalman, third class, served\r\non the cutter _Spencer_, a black coxswain served on a cutter in the\r\nGreenland patrol, and other black petty officers were assigned to\r\nrecruiting stations, to the loran program, and as instructors at the\r\nManhattan Beach Training Station.[4-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-62: USCG Historical Section, The Coast\r\n                   Guard at War, 23:53; Intervs, author with Lt Harvey\r\n                   C. Russell, USCGR, 14 Feb 75, and with Capron, CMH\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nThe position of instructor at Manhattan Beach became the usual avenue\r\nto a commission for a Negro. Joseph C. Jenkins went from Manhattan\r\nBeach to the officer candidate school at the Coast Guard Academy,\r\ngraduating as an ensign in the Coast Guard Reserve in April 1943,\r\nalmost a full year before Negroes were commissioned in the Navy.\r\nClarence Samuels, a warrant officer and instructor at Manhattan    (p. 122)\r\nBeach, was commissioned as a lieutenant (junior grade) and assigned to\r\nthe _Sea Cloud_ in 1943. Harvey C. Russell was a signal instructor at\r\nManhattan Beach in 1944 when all instructors were declared eligible to\r\napply for commissions. At first rejected by the officer training\r\nschool, Russell was finally admitted at the insistence of his\r\ncommanding officer, graduated as an ensign, and was assigned to the\r\n_Sea Cloud_.[4-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-63: \"A Black History in WWII,\" pp. 31-34.\r\n                   For an account of Samuels' long career in the Coast\r\n                   Guard, see Joseph Greco and Truman R.

Samuels became the first Negro in this century to command a\r\nCoast Guard vessel in wartime, first as captain of Lightship No. 115\r\nand later of the USCGC _Sweetgum_ in the Panama Sea Frontier. Russell\r\nwas transferred from the integrated _Hoquim_ to serve as executive\r\nofficer on a cutter operating out of the Philippines in the western\r\nPacific, assuming command of the racially mixed crew shortly after the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAt the behest of the White House, the Coast Guard also joined with the\r\nNavy in integrating its Women's Reserve. In the fall of 1944 it\r\nrecruited five black women for the SPARS. Only token representation,\r\nbut understandable since the SPARS ceased all recruitment except for\r\nreplacements on 23 November 1944, just weeks after the decision to\r\nrecruit Negroes was announced. Nevertheless the five women trained at\r\nManhattan Beach and were assigned to various Coast Guard district\r\noffices without regard to race.[4-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-64: USCG Historical Section, The Coast\r\n                   Guard at War, 25:25. See also Oral History\r\n                   Interview, Dorothy C. Stratton, 24 Sep 70, Center\r\n                   of Naval History.]\r\n\r\nThis very real progress toward equal treatment and opportunity for\r\nNegroes in the Coast Guard must be assessed with the knowledge that\r\nthe progress was experienced by only a minuscule group. Negroes never\r\nrose above 2.1 percent of the Coast Guard's wartime population, well\r\nbelow the figures for the other services. This was because the other\r\nservices were forced to obtain draft-age men, including a significant\r\nnumber of black inductees from Selective Service, whereas the Coast\r\nGuard ceased all inductions in early 1944.\r\n\r\nDespite their small numbers, however, the black Coast Guardsmen\r\nenjoyed a variety of assignments. The different reception accorded\r\nthis small group of Negroes might, at least to some extent, be\r\nexplained by the Coast Guard's tradition of some black participation\r\nfor well over a century. To a certain extent this progress could also\r\nbe attributed to the ease with which the directors of a small\r\norganization can reorder its policies.[4-65] But above all, the\r\ndifferent reception accorded Negroes in the Coast Guard was a small\r\norganization's practical reaction to a pressing assimilation problem\r\ndictated by the manpower policies common throughout the naval\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 4-65: For discussion of this point, see\r\n                   Testimony of Coast Guard Representatives Before the\r\n                   President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Services, 18 Mar 49, pp.\r\n                   25-26.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5                                                          (p. 123)\r\n\r\nA Postwar Search\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nation's military leaders and the leaders of the civil rights\r\nmovement were in rare accord at the end of World War II. They agreed\r\nthat despite considerable wartime improvement the racial policies of\r\nthe services had proved inadequate for the development of the full\r\nmilitary potential of the country's largest minority as well as the\r\nefficient operation and management of the nation's armed forces.\r\nDissatisfaction with the current policy of the armed forces was a\r\nspearpoint of the increasingly militant and powerful civil rights\r\nmovement, and this dissatisfaction was echoed to a great extent by the\r\nservices themselves. Intimate association with minority problems had\r\nconvinced the Army's Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies and\r\nthe Navy's Special Programs Unit that new policies had to be devised\r\nand new directions sought. Confronted with the incessant demands of\r\nthe civil rights advocates and presented by their own staffs with\r\nevidence of trouble, civilian leaders of the services agreed to review\r\nthe status of the Negro. As the postwar era opened, both the Army and\r\nthe Navy were beginning the interminable investigations that augured a\r\nchange in policy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the services and the civil rights leaders had somewhat\r\ndifferent ends in mind. Concerned chiefly with military efficiency but\r\nalso accustomed to racial segregation or exclusion, most military\r\nleaders insisted on a rigid appraisal of the performance of segregated\r\nunits in the war and ignored the effects of segregation on that\r\nperformance. Civil rights advocates, on the other hand, seeing an\r\nopportunity to use the military as a vehicle for the extension of\r\nsocial justice, stressed the baneful effects of segregation on the\r\nblack serviceman's morale. They were inclined to ignore the\r\nperformance of the large segregated units and took issue with the\r\npremise that desegregation of the armed forces in advance of the rest\r\nof American society would threaten the efficient execution of the\r\nservices' military mission. Neither group seemed able to appreciate\r\nthe other's real concerns, and their contradictory conclusions\r\npromised a renewal of the discord in their wartime relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black Demands_\r\n\r\nWorld War II marked the beginning of an important step in the\r\nevolution of the civil rights movement. Until then the struggle for\r\nracial equality had been sustained chiefly by the \"talented tenth,\"\r\nthe educated, middle-class black citizens who formed an economic and\r\npolitical alliance with white supporters. Together they fought to  (p. 124)\r\nimprove the racial situation with some success in the courts, but with\r\nlittle progress in the executive branch and still less in the\r\nlegislative. The efforts of men like W. E. B. DuBois, Walter White,\r\nand Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP and Lester Granger of the National\r\nUrban League were in the mainstream of the American reform movement,\r\nwhich stressed an orderly petitioning of government for a redress of\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nBut there was another facet to the American reform tradition, one that\r\nstressed mass action and civil disobedience, and the period between\r\nthe March on Washington Movement in 1940 and the threat of a black\r\nboycott of the draft in 1948 witnessed the beginnings of a shift in\r\nthe civil rights movement to this kind of reform tactic. The\r\narticulate leaders of the prewar struggle were still active, and in\r\nfact would make their greatest contribution in the fight that led to\r\nthe Supreme Court's pronouncement on school segregation in 1954. But\r\ntheir quiet methods were already being challenged by A. Philip\r\nRandolph and others who launched a sustained demand for equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity in the armed forces during the early postwar\r\nperiod. Randolph and leaders of his persuasion relied not so much on\r\nlegal eloquence in their representations to the federal government as\r\non an understanding of bloc voting in key districts and the implicit\r\nthreat of civil disobedience. The civil rights campaign, at least in\r\nthe effort to end segregation in the armed forces, had the appearance\r\nof a mass movement a full decade before a weary Rosa Parks boarded a\r\nMontgomery bus and set off the all-embracing crusade of Martin Luther\r\nKing, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe growing political power of the Negro and the threat of mass action\r\nin the 1940's were important reasons for the breakthrough on the color\r\nfront that began in the armed forces in the postwar period. For\r\ndespite the measure of good will and political acumen that\r\ncharacterized his social programs, Harry S. Truman might never have\r\nmade the effort to achieve racial equality in the services without the\r\nconstant pressure of civil rights activists.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the transformation that was beginning in the civil\r\nrights struggle were varied and complex.[5-1] Fundamental was the\r\ngrowing urbanization of the Negro. By 1940 almost half the black\r\npopulation lived in cities. As the labor shortage became more acute\r\nduring the next five years, movement toward the cities continued, not\r\nonly in the south but in the north and west. Attracted by economic\r\nopportunities in Los Angeles war industries, for example, over 1,000\r\nNegroes moved to that city each month during the war. Detroit,\r\nSeattle, and San Francisco, among others, reported similar migrations.\r\nThe balance finally shifted during the war, and the 1950 census showed\r\nthat 56 percent of the black population resided in metropolitan    (p. 125)\r\nareas, 32 percent in cities of the north and west.[5-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-1: This discussion is based in great part\r\n                   on Arnold M.

It meant\r\nfirst that the black masses were separating themselves from the\r\narchaic social patterns that had ruled their lives for generations.\r\nDespite virulent discrimination and prejudice in northern and western\r\ncities, Negroes could vote freely and enjoy some protection of the law\r\nand law-enforcement machinery. They were free of the burden of Jim\r\nCrow. Along with white citizens they were given better schooling, a\r\nmajor factor in improving status. The mass migration also meant that\r\nthis part of America's peasantry was rapidly joining America's\r\nproletariat. The wartime shortage of workers, coupled with the efforts\r\nof the Fair Employment Practices Committee and other government\r\nagencies, opened up thousands of jobs previously denied black\r\nAmericans. The number of skilled craftsmen, foremen, and semiskilled\r\nworkers among black Americans rose from 500,000 to over 1,000,000\r\nduring the war, while the number of Negroes working for the federal\r\ngovernment increased from 60,000 to 200,000.[5-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-3: Selective Service System, _Special\r\n                   Groups_, vol. I, pp. 177-78; see also Robert C.\r\n                   Weaver, \"Negro Labor Since 1929,\" _The Journal of\r\n                   Negro History_ 35 (January 1950):20-38.]\r\n\r\nThough much of the increase in black employment was the result of\r\ntemporarily expanded wartime industries, black workers gained valuable\r\ntraining and experience that enabled them to compete more effectively\r\nfor postwar jobs. Employment in unionized industries strengthened\r\ntheir position in the postwar labor movement. The severity of\r\ninevitable postwar cuts in black employment was mitigated by continued\r\nprosperity and the sustained growth of American industry. Postwar\r\nindustrial development created thousands of new upper-level jobs,\r\nallowing many black workers to continue their economic advance without\r\nreplacing white workers and without the attendant development of\r\nracial tensions.\r\n\r\nThe armed forces played their part in this change. Along with better\r\nfood, pay, and living conditions provided by the services, many\r\nNegroes were given new work experiences. Along with many of their\r\nwhite fellows, they acquired new skills and a new sophistication that\r\nprepared them for the different life of the postwar industrial world.\r\nMost important, military service in World War II divorced many Negroes\r\nfrom a society whose traditions had carefully defined their place, and\r\nexposed them for the first time to a community where racial equality,\r\nalthough imperfectly realized, was an ideal. Out of this experience\r\nmany Negroes came to understand that their economic and political\r\nposition could be changed. Ironically, the services themselves became\r\nan early target of this rising self-awareness. The integration of the\r\narmed forces, immediate and total, was a popular goal of the newly\r\nfranchised voting group, which was turning away from leaders of both\r\nraces who preached a philosophy of gradual change.\r\n\r\nThe black press was spokesman for the widespread demand for        (p. 126)\r\nequality in the armed forces; just as the growth of the black press\r\nwas dramatically stimulated by urbanization of the Negro, so was the\r\ncivil rights movement stimulated by the press. The Pittsburgh\r\n_Courier_ was but one of many black papers and journals that developed\r\na national circulation and featured countless articles on the subject\r\nof discrimination in the services. One black sociologist observed that\r\nit was \"no exaggeration to say that the Negro press was the major\r\ninfluence in mobilizing Negroes in the struggle for their rights\r\nduring World War II.\"[5-4] Sometimes inaccurate, often inflammatory, and\r\nalways to the consternation of the military, the black press rallied\r\nthe opposition to segregation during and after the war.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-4: E. Franklin Frazier, _The Negro in the\r\n                   United States_ (New York: Macmillan, 1957), p.\r\n                   513.]\r\n\r\nMuch of the black unrest and dissatisfaction dramatized by the press\r\ncontinued to be mobilized through the efforts of such organizations as\r\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the\r\nNational Urban League, and the Congress of Racial Equality. The NAACP,\r\nfor example, revitalized by a new and broadened appeal to the black\r\nmasses, had some 1,200 branches in forty-three states by 1946 and\r\nboasted a membership of more than half a million. While the\r\nassociation continued to fight for minority rights in the courts, to\r\nstimulate black political participation, and to improve the conditions\r\nof Negroes generally, its most popular activity during the 1940's was\r\nits effort to eliminate discrimination in the armed forces. The files\r\nof the services and the White House are replete with NAACP complaints,\r\nrequests, demands, and charges that involved the military departments\r\nin innumerable investigations and justifications. If the complaints\r\neffected little immediate change in policy, they at least dramatized\r\nthe plight of black servicemen and mobilized demands for reform.[5-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-5: Clark, \"The Civil Rights Movement,\"\r\n                   pp. 240-47.]\r\n\r\nNot all racial unrest was so constructively channeled during the war.\r\nRiots and mutinies in the armed services were echoed around the\r\ncountry. In Detroit competition between blacks and whites, many\r\nrecently arrived from the south seeking jobs, culminated in June 1943\r\nin the most serious riot of the decade. The President was forced to\r\ndeclare a state of emergency and dispatch 6,000 troops to patrol the\r\ncity. The Detroit riot was only the most noticeable of a number of\r\nracial incidents that inevitably provoked an ugly reaction, and the\r\npostwar period witnessed an increase in antiblack sentiment and\r\nviolence in the United States.[5-6] Testifying to the black community's\r\neconomic and political progress during the war as well as a\r\ncorresponding increase in white awareness of and protest against the\r\nmistreatment of black citizens, this antiblack sentiment was only the\r\npale ghost of a similar phenomenon after World War I.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-6: _Report of the National Advisory\r\n                   Commission on Civil Disorders, 1 March 1968_,\r\n                   Kerner Report (Washington: Government Printing\r\n                   Office, 1968), pp. 104-05; see also Dalfiume,\r\n                   _Desegregation of the U.S. Armed Forces_, pp.\r\n                   132-34.

Traveling cross-country in\r\na train during Christmastime, 1945, the celebrated American essayist\r\nBernard De Voto was astonished to hear expressions of antiblack    (p. 127)\r\nsentiment. In Wisconsin, \"a state where I think I had never before\r\nheard the word 'nigger,' that [dining] car was full of talk about\r\nniggers and what had to be done about them.\"[5-7] A white veteran bore\r\nout the observation. \"Anti-Negro talk ... is cropping up in many\r\nplaces ... the assumption [being] that there is more prejudice, never\r\nless.... Throughout the war the whites were segregated from the\r\nNegroes (why not say it this way for a change?) so that there were\r\nalmost no occasions for white soldiers to get any kind of an\r\nimpression of Negroes, favorable or otherwise.\" There had been some\r\nrace prejudice among servicemen, but, the veteran asked, \"What has\r\ncaused this anti-Negro talk among those who stayed at home?\"[5-8]\r\nAbout the same time, a U.S. senator was complaining to the Secretary\r\nof War that white and black civilians at Kelly Field, Texas,       (p. 128)\r\nshared the same cafeterias and other facilities. He hoped the\r\nsecretary would look into the matter to prevent disturbances that\r\nmight grow out of a policy of this sort.[5-9]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-7: Bernard De Voto, \"The Easy Chair\"\r\n                   _Harper's_ 192 (January 1946):38-39.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-8: Ltr, John H.

For\r\nexample, the War Department received many letters from the public and\r\nmembers of Congress when black officers, nearly the base's entire\r\ncontingent of four hundred, demonstrated against the segregation of\r\nthe officers' club at Freeman Field, Indiana, in April 1945. The\r\nquestion at issue was whether a post commander had the authority to\r\nexclude individuals on grounds of race from recreational facilities on\r\nan Army post. The Army Air Forces supported the post commander and\r\nsuggested a return to a policy of separate and equal facilities for\r\nwhites and blacks, primarily because a club for officers was a social\r\ncenter for the entire family. Since it was hardly an accepted custom\r\nin the country for the races to intermingle, officials argued, the\r\nArmy had to follow rather than depart from custom, and, further, the\r\nwishes of white officers as well as those of Negroes deserved\r\nconsideration.[5-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-10: This important incident in the Air\r\n                   Force's racial history has been well documented.\r\n                   See AAF Summary Sheet, 5 May 45, sub: Racial\r\n                   Incidents at Freeman Field and Ft.

McCloy's\r\ncontention prevailed--that the commander's administrative discretion\r\nin these matters fell short of authority to exclude individuals from\r\nthe right to enjoy recreational facilities provided by the federal\r\ngovernment or maintained with its funds. Secretary of War Stimson\r\nagreed to amend the basic policy to reflect this clarification.[5-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-11: Memo, ASW for SW, 4 Jun 45; Memo, SGS\r\n                   for DCofS, 7 Jun 45, sub: Report of Advisory\r\n                   Committee on Special Troop Policies, both in ASW\r\n                   291.2 (NT).]\r\n\r\nIn December 1945 the press reported and the War and Navy Departments\r\ninvestigated an incident at Le Havre, France, where soldiers were\r\nembarking for the United States for demobilization.

In February 1946 Issac\r\nWoodard, Jr., who had served in the Army for fifteen months in the\r\nPacific, was ejected from a commercial bus and beaten by civilian\r\npolice. Sergeant Woodard had recently been discharged from the Army at\r\nCamp Gordon, Georgia, and was still in uniform at the time of the\r\nbrutal attack that blinded him. His case was quickly taken up by the\r\nNAACP and became the centerpiece of a national protest.[5-15] Not only\r\ndid the civil rights spokesmen protest the sadistic blinding, they\r\nalso charged that the Army was incapable of protecting its own members\r\nin the community.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-15: See Ltr, Walter White, Secy, NAACP,\r\n                   to SW, 6 May 46, and a host of letters in SW 291.2\r\n                   file.

Yet even\r\nservice practices on military bases were under attack as racial\r\nconflicts and threats of violence multiplied. \"Dear Mother,\" one\r\nsoldier stationed at Sheppard Field, Texas, felt compelled to write in\r\nearly 1946, \"I don't know how long I'll stay whole because when those\r\nWhites come over to start [trouble] again I'll be right with the rest\r\nof the fellows. Nothing to worry about. Love,...\"[5-16] If the\r\nsoldier's letter revealed continuing racial conflict in the service,\r\nit also testified to a growing racial unity among black servicemen\r\nthat paralleled the trend in the black community. When Negroes could\r\nresolve with a new self-consciousness to \"be right with the rest of\r\nthe fellows,\" their cause was immeasurably strengthened and their\r\ngoals brought appreciably nearer.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-16: Ltr, 28 Feb 46, copy in SW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nCivil rights spokesmen had several points to make regarding the use of\r\nNegroes in the postwar armed forces. Referring to the fact that World\r\nWar II began with Negroes fighting for the right to fight, they\r\ndemanded that the services guarantee a fair representation of Negroes\r\nin the postwar forces. Furthermore, to avoid the frustration suffered\r\nby Negroes trained for combat and then converted into service troops,\r\nthey demanded that Negroes be trained and employed in all military\r\nspecialties. They particularly stressed the correlation between poor\r\nleaders and poor units. The services' command practices, they charged,\r\nhad frequently led to the appointment of the wrong men, either black\r\nor white, to command black units. Their principal solution was to\r\nprovide for the promotion and proper employment of a proportionate\r\nshare of competent black officers and noncommissioned officers. Above\r\nall, they pointed to the humiliations black soldiers suffered in   (p. 130)\r\nthe community outside the limits of the base.[5-17] One particularly\r\ntelling example of such discrimination that circulated in the black\r\npress in 1945 described German prisoners of war being fed in a\r\nrailroad restaurant while their black Army guards were forced to eat\r\noutside. But such discrimination toward black servicemen was hardly\r\nunique, and the civil rights advocates were quick to point to the\r\nconnection between such practices and low morale and performance. For\r\nthem there was but one answer to such discrimination: all men must be\r\ntreated as individuals and guaranteed equal treatment and opportunity\r\nin the services. In a word, the armed forces must integrate. They\r\npointed with pride to the success of those black soldiers who served\r\nin integrated units in the last months of the European war, and they\r\nrepeatedly urged the complete abolition of segregation in the\r\npeacetime Army and Navy.[5-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-17: For a summary of these views, see\r\n                   Warman Welliver, \"Report on the Negro Soldier,\"\r\n                   _Harper's_ 192 (April 1946):333-38 and back pages.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-18: Murray, _Negro Handbook, 1946-1947_,\r\n                   pp. 369-70.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSISTANT SECRETARY MCCLOY.]\r\n\r\nWhen an executive of the National Urban League summed up these demands\r\nfor President Truman at the end of the war, he clearly indicated that\r\nthe changes in military policy that had brought about the gradual\r\nimprovement in the lot of black servicemen during the war were now\r\nbeside the point.[5-19] The military might try to ignore this fact for a\r\nlittle while longer; a politically sensitive President was not about\r\nto make such an error.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-19: Ltr, Exec Secy, National Urban\r\n                   League, to President Truman, 27 Aug 45, copy in\r\n                   Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Army's Grand Review_\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this intensifying sentiment for integration, in fact a\r\nfull year before the war ended, the Army began to search for a new\r\nracial policy. The invasion of Normandy and the extraordinary advance\r\nto Paris during the summer of 1944 had led many to believe that the\r\nwar in Europe would soon be over, perhaps by fall. As the Allied\r\nleaders at the Quebec Conference in September discussed arrangements\r\nto be imposed on a defeated Germany, American officials in Washington\r\nbegan to consider plans for the postwar period. Among them was\r\nAssistant Secretary of War McCloy. Dissatisfied with the manner in\r\nwhich the Army was using black troops, McCloy believed it was time to\r\nstart planning how best to employ them in the postwar Army, which  (p. 131)\r\naccording to current assumptions, would be small and professional and\r\nwould depend upon a citizen reserve to augment it in an emergency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUMAN GIBSON.]\r\n\r\nMcCloy concluded that despite a host of prewar studies by the General\r\nStaff, the Army War College, and other military agencies, the Army was\r\nunprepared during World War II to deal with and make the most\r\nefficient use of the large numbers of Negroes furnished by Selective\r\nService. Policies for training and employing black troops had\r\ndeveloped in response to specific problems rather than in accordance\r\nwith a well thought out and comprehensive plan. Because of \"inadequate\r\npreparation prior to the period of sudden expansion,\" McCloy believed\r\na great many sources of racial irritation persisted. To develop a\r\n\"definite, workable policy, for the inclusion and utilization in the\r\nArmy of minority racial groups\" before postwar planning crystallized\r\nand solidified, McCloy suggested to his assistants that the War\r\nDepartment General Staff review existing practices and experiences at\r\nhome and abroad and recommend changes.[5-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-20: Memos, McCloy for Advisory Committee\r\n                   on Special Troop Policies, 31 Jul and 1 Sep 44,\r\n                   sub: Participation of Negro Troops in the Post-War\r\n                   Military Establishment; Memo, ASW for SW, 10 Jan\r\n                   45, same sub, all in ASW 291.2 (NT).]\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Staff, General Marshall, continued to insist that the\r\nArmy's racial problem was but part of a larger national problem and,\r\nas McCloy later recalled, had no strong views on a solution.[5-21]\r\nWhatever his personal feelings, Marshall, like most Army staff\r\nofficers, always emphasized efficiency and performance to the\r\nexclusion of social concerns. While he believed that the limited scope\r\nof the experiment with integrated platoons toward the end of the war\r\nin Europe made the results inconclusive, Marshall still wanted the\r\nplatoons' performance considered in the general staff study.[5-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-21: Ltr, John J.

The\r\nupshot was a decision to ask the senior commanders at home and\r\noverseas for their comments. How did they train and use their black\r\ntroops? What irritations, frictions, and disorders arising from racial\r\nconflicts had hampered their operations? What were their           (p. 132)\r\nrecommendations on how best to use black troops after the war? Two\r\nweeks after the war ended in Europe, a letter with an attached\r\nquestionnaire was sent to senior commanders.[5-23] The questionnaire\r\nasked for such information as: \"To what extent have you maintained\r\nsegregation beyond the actual unit level, and what is your\r\nrecommendation on this subject? If you have employed Negro platoons in\r\nthe same company with white platoons, what is your opinion of the\r\npracticability of this arrangement?\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-23: Ltr, TAG to CinC, Southwest Pacific\r\n                   Area, et al., 23 May 45, sub: Participation of\r\n                   Negro Troops in Post-War Military Establishment, AG\r\n                   291.2 (23 May 45).

Truman Gibson, for one,\r\ndoubted the value of soliciting information from senior commanders,\r\nfeeling that these officers would offer much subjective material of\r\nlittle real assistance. Referring to the letter to the major senior\r\ncommanders, he said:\r\n\r\n     Mere injunctions of objectivity do not work in the racial field\r\n     where more often than not decisions are made on a basis of\r\n     emotion, prejudice or pre-existing opinion.... Much of the\r\n     difficulty in the Army has arisen from improper racial attitudes\r\n     on both sides. Indeed, the Army's basic policy of segregation is\r\n     said to be based principally on the individual attitudes and\r\n     desires of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nBut who knew what soldiers' attitudes were? Why not, he suggested,\r\nmake some scientific inquiries? Why not try to determine, for example,\r\nhow far public opinion and pressure would permit the Army to go in\r\ndeveloping policies for black troops?[5-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-24: Memo, Gibson for ASW, 30 May 45, ASW\r\n                   291.2 (NT).]\r\n\r\nGibson had become, perforce, an expert on public opinion. During the\r\nlast several months he had suffered the slings and arrows of an\r\noutraged black press for his widely publicized analysis of the\r\nperformance of black troops. Visiting black units and commanders in\r\nthe Mediterranean and European theaters to observe, in McCloy's words,\r\n\"the performance of Negro troops, their attitudes, and the attitudes\r\nof their officers toward them,\"[5-25] Gibson had arrived in Italy at the\r\nend of February 1945 to find theater officials concerned over the poor\r\ncombat record of the 92d Infantry Division, the only black division in\r\nthe theater and one of three activated by the War Department. After a\r\nseries of discussions with senior commanders and a visit to the\r\ndivision, Gibson participated in a press conference in Rome during\r\nwhich he spoke candidly of the problems of the division's infantry\r\nunits.[5-26] Subsequent news reports of the conference stressed Gibson's\r\nconfirmation of the division's disappointing performance, but\r\nneglected the reasons he advanced to explain its failure. The reports\r\nearned a swift and angry retort from the black community. Many     (p. 133)\r\norganizations and journals condemned Gibson's evaluation of the\r\n92d outright. Some seemed less concerned with the possible accuracy of\r\nhis statement than with the effects it might have on the development\r\nof future military policy. The NAACP's _Crisis_, for example, charged\r\nthat Gibson had \"carried the ball for the War Department,\" and that\r\n\"probably no more unfortunate words, affecting the representatives of\r\nthe entire race, were ever spoken by a Negro in a key position in such\r\na critical hour. We seem destined to bear the burden of Mr. Gibson's\r\nRome adventure for many years to come.\"[5-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-25: Ltr, Gibson to Gen John C. H.

(July\r\n                   1945):193.]\r\n\r\nOther black journals took a more detached view of the situation,\r\nasserting that Gibson's remarks revealed nothing new and that the\r\nproblem was segregation, of which the 92d was a notable victim. Gibson\r\ntook this tack in his own defense, pointing to the irony of a\r\nsituation in which \"some people can, on the one hand, argue that\r\nsegregation is wrong, and on the other ... blindly defend the product\r\nof that segregation.\"[5-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-28: Washington _Afro-American_, April 15,\r\n                   1945, quoted in Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_,\r\n                   p. 579. For details of the Gibson controversy, see\r\n                   Lee, pp. 575-79.]\r\n\r\nGibson had defenders in the Army whose comments might well apply to\r\nall the large black units in the war. At one extreme stood the Allied\r\ncommander in Italy, General Mark W. Clark, who attributed the 92d's\r\nshortcomings to \"our handling of minority problems at home.\" Most of\r\nall, General Clark thought, black soldiers needed the incentive of\r\nfeeling that they were fighting for home and country as equals. But\r\nhis conclusion--\"only the proper environment in his own country can\r\nprovide such an incentive\"--neatly played down Army responsibility for\r\nthe division's problems.[5-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-29: Mark W. Clark, _A Calculated Risk_\r\n                   (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1950), pp. 414-15.]\r\n\r\nAnother officer, who as commander of a divisional artillery unit was\r\nintimately acquainted with the division's shortcomings, delineated an\r\nentirely different set of causes. The division was doomed to\r\nmediocrity and worse, Lt. Col. Marcus H. Ray concluded, from the\r\nmoment of its activation. Undercurrents of racial antipathy as well as\r\ndistrust and prejudice, he believed, infected the organization from\r\nthe outset and created an unhealthy beginning. The practice of\r\nwithholding promotion from deserving black officers along with\r\npreferential assignments for white officers prolonged the malady. The\r\nbasic misconception was that southern white officers understood\r\nNegroes; under such officers Negroes who conformed with the southern\r\nstereotype were promoted regardless of their abilities, while those\r\nwho exhibited self-reliance and self-respect--necessary attributes of\r\nleadership--were humiliated and discouraged for their uppityness. \"I\r\nwas astounded,\" he said, \"by the willingness of the white officers who\r\npreceded us to place their own lives in a hazardous position in order\r\nto have tractable Negroes around them.\"[5-30] In short, the men of the\r\n92d who fought and died bravely should be honored, but their unit,\r\nwhich on balance did not perform well, should be considered a      (p. 134)\r\nfailure of white leadership.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-30: Ltr, Ray to Gibson, 14 May 45, WDGAP\r\n                   291.2.

Gen. Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., then Fifth Army commander in Italy,\r\ndisagreed. Submitting the proceedings of a board of review that had\r\ninvestigated the effectiveness of black officers and enlisted men in\r\nthe 92d Division, he was sympathetic to the frustrations encountered\r\nby the division commander, Maj. Gen. Edward M. Almond. \"In justice to\r\nthose splendid officers\"--a reference to the white senior commanders\r\nand staff members of the division--\"who have devoted themselves\r\nwithout stint in an endeavor to produce a combat division with Negro\r\npersonnel and who have approached this problem without prejudice,\"\r\nTruscott endorsed the board's hard view that many infantrymen in the\r\ndivision \"would not fight.\"[5-31] This conclusion was in direct conflict\r\nwith the widely held and respected truism that competent leadership\r\nsolved all problems, from which it followed that the answer to the\r\nproblem of Negroes in combat was command. Good commanders prevented\r\nfriction, performed their mission effectively, and achieved success no\r\nmatter what the obstacles--a view put forth in a typical report from\r\nWorld War II that \"the efficiency of Negro units depends entirely on\r\nthe leadership of officers and NCO's.\"[5-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-31: 1st Ind, Hq Fifth Army (signed L.

The\r\nXIV Corps commander, under whom the division served, rated the\r\nperformance of the 25th Regimental Combat Team infantry as fair and\r\nartillery as good, but found the unit, at least those parts commanded\r\nby black officers, lacking in initiative, inadequately trained, and\r\npoorly disciplined. Other reports tended to agree. All of them, along\r\nwith reports on the 24th Infantry, another black unit serving in the\r\narea, were assembled in Washington for Assistant Secretary McCloy.\r\nWhile he admitted important limitations in the performance of the\r\nunits, McCloy nevertheless remained encouraged. Not so the Secretary\r\nof War. \"I do not believe,\" he told McCloy, \"they can be turned into\r\nreally effective combat troops without all officers being white.\"[5-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-39: The above digested reports and\r\n                   quotations are from Lee, _Employment of Negro\r\n                   Troops_, pp. 513-17.]\r\n\r\nBlack officers of the 93d, however, entertained a different view. They\r\ngenerally cited command and staff inefficiencies as the major cause of\r\nthe division's discipline and morale problems. One respondent, a company\r\ncommander in the 25th Infantry, singled out the \"continuous        (p. 136)\r\ndissension and suspicion characterizing the relations between white\r\nand colored officers of the division.\" All tended to stress what they\r\nconsidered inadequate jungle training, and, like many white observers,\r\nthey all agreed the combat period was too brief to demonstrate the\r\ndivision's developing ability.[5-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-40: USAFFE Board Reports No. 185, 20 Jan\r\n                   45, and 221, 25 Feb 45, sub: Information on Colored\r\n                   Troops.

A much\r\nsmaller group of commentators, mostly black journalists, never\r\naccepted the prevailing view. Pointing to the decorations and honors\r\nreceived by individuals in the two divisions, they charged that the\r\nadverse reports were untrue, reflections of the prejudices of white\r\nofficers. Such an assertion presupposed that hundreds of officers and\r\nWar Department officials were so consumed with prejudice that they\r\nfalsified the record. And the argument from decorations, as one expert\r\nlater pointed out, faltered once it was understood that the 92d    (p. 137)\r\nand 93d Infantry Divisions combined a relatively high number of\r\ndecorations with relatively few casualties.[5-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-41: E. W. Kenworthy, \"The Case Against\r\n                   Army Segregation,\" _Annals of the American Academy\r\n                   of Political Science_ 275 (May 1952):28-29. A low\r\n                   decoration to casualty ratio is traditionally used\r\n                   as one measure of good unit performance. However,\r\n                   so many different unit attitudes and standards for\r\n                   decorations existed during World War II that any\r\n                   argument over ratios can only be self-defeating no\r\n                   matter what the approach.]\r\n\r\nActually, there was little doubt that the performance of the black\r\ndivisions in World War II was generally unacceptable. Beyond that\r\ncommon conclusion, opinions diverged widely. Commanders tended to\r\nblame undisciplined troops and lack of initiative and control by black\r\nofficers and noncommissioned officers as the primary cause of the\r\ndifficulty. Others, particularly black observers, cited the white\r\nofficers and their lack of racial sensitivity. In fact, as Ulysses Lee\r\npoints out with careful documentation, all these factors were\r\ninvolved, but the underlying problem usually overlooked by observers\r\nwas segregation. Large, all-black combat units submerged able soldiers\r\nin a sea of men with low aptitude and inadequate training. Segregation\r\nalso created special psychological problems for junior black officers.\r\nCarefully assigned so that they never commanded white officers or men,\r\nthey were often derided by white officers whose attitudes were quickly\r\nsensed by the men to the detriment of good discipline. Segregation was\r\nalso a factor in the rapid transfer of men in and out of the\r\ndivisions, thus negating the possible benefits of lengthy training.\r\nFurthermore, the divisions were natural repositories for many\r\ndissatisfied or inadequate white officers, who introduced a host of\r\nother problems.\r\n\r\nTruman Gibson was quick to point out how segregation had intensified\r\nthe problem of turning civilians into soldiers and groups into units.\r\nThe \"dissimilarity in the learning profiles\" between black and white\r\nsoldiers as reflected in their AGCT scores was, he explained to\r\nMcCloy, primarily a result of inferior black schooling, yet its\r\npractical effect on the Army was to burden it with several large units\r\nof inferior combat ability (_Table 2_). In addition to the fact that\r\nlarge black units had a preponderance of slow learners, Gibson\r\nemphasized that nearly all black soldiers were trained near\r\n\"exceedingly hostile\" communities. This hostile atmosphere, he\r\nbelieved, had played a decisive role in their adjustment to Army life\r\nand adversely affected individual motivation. Gibson also charged the\r\nArmy with promoting some black officers who lacked leadership\r\nqualifications and whose performance, consequently, was under par. He\r\nrecommended a single measure of performance for officers and a single\r\nsystem for promotion, even if this system reduced promotions for black\r\nofficers. Promotions on any basis other than merit, he concluded,\r\ndeprived the Army of the best leadership and inflicted weak commanders\r\non black units.\r\n\r\nTable 2--AGCT Percentages in Selected World War II Divisions\r\n\r\n       Unit             I         II        III        IV      V    Total\r\n                      (130 +)  (110-120)  (90-109)  (60-89)  (0-59)\r\n\r\n  11th Armored\r\n       Division....... 3.0       23.8       33.8      33.1     6.3   100\r\n  35th Infantry\r\n       Division....... 3.3       27.0       34.2      28.0     7.5   100\r\n  92d Infantry\r\n      Division (Negro) 0.4        5.2       11.8      43.5    39.1   100\r\n  93d Infantry\r\n      Division (Negro) 0.1        3.5       13.0      38.4    45.0   100\r\n  100th Infantry\r\n      Division........ 3.6       27.1       34.1      29.1     6.1   100\r\n\r\n_Source_: Tables submitted by The Adjutant General to the Gillem\r\nBoard, 1945.\r\n\r\nGibson was not trying to magnify the efficiency of segregated      (p. 138)\r\nunits. He made a special effort to compare the performance of the 92d\r\nDivision with that of the integrated black platoons in Germany because\r\nsuch a comparison would demonstrate, he believed, that the Army's\r\nsegregation policy was in need of critical reexamination. He cited\r\n\"many officers\" who believed that the problems connected with large\r\nsegregated combat units justified their abolition in favor of the\r\nintegration of black platoons into larger white units. Although such\r\nunit integration would not abolish segregation completely, Gibson\r\nconcluded, it would permit the Army to use men and small units on the\r\nbasis of ability alone.[5-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-42: Memo, Gibson for ASW, 23 Apr 45, sub:\r\n                   Report of Visit to MTO and ETO, ASW 291.2 (NT); see\r\n                   also Interv, Bell I.

With few\r\nexceptions, the senior officers queried expressed uniform reactions.\r\nThey reiterated a story of frustration and difficulty in training and\r\nemploying black units, characterized black soldiers as unreliable and\r\ninefficient, and criticized the performance of black officers and\r\nnoncommissioned officers. They were particularly concerned with racial\r\ndisturbances, which, they believed, were not only the work of racial\r\nagitators but also the result of poor morale and a sense of\r\ndiscrimination among black troops. Yet they wanted to retain\r\nsegregation, albeit in units of smaller size, and they wanted to\r\ndepend, for the most part, on white officers to command these black\r\nunits. Concerned with performance, pragmatic rather than reflective in\r\ntheir habits, the commanders showed little interest in or\r\nunderstanding of the factors responsible for the conditions of which\r\nthey complained. Many believed that segregation actually enhanced\r\nblack pride.[5-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-43: Eventually over thirty-five commands\r\n                   responded to the McCloy questionnaire.

Some of these and many others\r\n                   are also located in WDSSP 291.2 (1945).]\r\n\r\nThese responses were summarized by the commanding generals of the\r\nmajor force commands at the request of the War Department's Special\r\nPlanning Division.[5-44] For example, the study prepared by the Army\r\nService Forces, which had employed a high proportion of black troops\r\nin its technical services during the war, passed on the\r\nrecommendations made by these far-flung commands and touched\r\nincidentally on several of the points raised by Gibson.[5-45] Like\r\nGibson, the Army Service Forces recommended that Negroes of little (p. 139)\r\nor no education be denied induction or enlistment and that no\r\ndeviation from normal standards for the sake of maintaining racial\r\nquotas in the officer corps be tolerated. The Army Service Forces also\r\nwanted Negroes employed in all major forces, participating\r\nproportionately in all phases of the Army's mission, including\r\noverseas and combat assignments, but not in every occupation. For the\r\nArmy Service Forces had decided that Negroes performed best as truck\r\ndrivers, ammunition handlers, stevedores, cooks, bakers, and the like\r\nand should be trained in these specialties rather than more highly\r\nskilled jobs such as armorer or machinist. Even in the occupations\r\nthey were best suited to, Negroes should be given from a third more to\r\ntwice as much training as whites, and black units should have 25 to 50\r\npercent more officers than white units. At the same time, the Army\r\nService Forces wanted to retain segregated units, although it\r\nrecommended limiting black service units to company size. Stating in\r\nconclusion that it sought only \"to insure the most efficient training\r\nand utilization of Negro manpower\" and would ignore the question of\r\nracial equality or the \"wisdom of segregation in the social sense,\"\r\nthe Army Service Forces overlooked the possibility that the former\r\ncould not be attained without consideration of the latter.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-44: Memo, Dir, WDSSP, for CG's, ASF et\r\n                   al., 23 May 45, sub: Participation of Negro Troops\r\n                   in the Postwar Military Establishment, AG 291.2 (23\r\n                   May 45).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-45: Memo, CofS, ASF, for Dir, Special\r\n                   Planning Division, WDSS, 1 Oct 45, sub:\r\n                   Participation of Negro Troops in the Postwar\r\n                   Military Establishment, WDSSP 291.2 (2 Oct 45). On\r\n                   the use of Negroes in the Signal Corps, see the\r\n                   following volumes in the United States Army in\r\n                   World War II series: Dulany Terrett, _The Signal\r\n                   Corps: The Emergency_ (Washington: Government\r\n                   Printing Office, 1956); George Raynor Thompson et\r\n                   al., _The Signal Corps: The Test_ (Washington:\r\n                   Government Printing Office, 1957); George Raynor\r\n                   Thompson and Dixie R.

The\r\norganization of black soldiers in division-size units, it claimed,\r\nonly complicated the problem of training because of the difficulty in\r\ndeveloping the qualified black technicians, noncommissioned officers,\r\nand field grade officers necessary for such large units and finding\r\ntraining locations as well as assignment areas with sufficient\r\noff-base recreational facilities for large groups of black soldiers.\r\nThe Army Ground Forces considered the problem of finding and training\r\nfield grade officers particularly acute since black units employing\r\nblack officers, at least in the case of infantry, had proved\r\nineffective. Yet white officers put in command of black troops felt\r\nthey were being punished, and their presence added to the frustration\r\nof the blacks.\r\n\r\nThe Army Ground Forces was also particularly concerned with racial\r\ndisturbances, which, it believed, stemmed from conflicting white and\r\nblack concepts of the Negro's place in the social pattern. The Army\r\nGround Forces saw no military solution for a problem that transcended\r\nthe contemporary national emergency, and its conclusion--that the\r\nsolution lay in society at large and not primarily in the armed\r\nforces--had the effect, whether or not so intended, of neatly\r\nexonerating the Army. In fact, the detailed conclusions and\r\nrecommendations of the Army Ground Forces were remarkably similar to\r\nthose of the Army Service Forces, but the Ground Forces study, more\r\nthan any other, was shot full with blatant racism. The study quoted a\r\n1925 War College study to the effect that the black officer was    (p. 140)\r\n\"still a Negro with all the faults and weaknesses of character\r\ninherent in the Negro race.\" It also discussed the \"average Negro\" and\r\nhis \"inherent characteristics\" at great length, dwelling on his\r\nsupposed inferior mentality and weakness of character, and raising\r\nother racial shibboleths. Burdened with these prejudices, the Army\r\nGround Forces study concluded\r\n\r\n     that the conception that negroes should serve in the military\r\n     forces, or in particular parts of the military forces, or sustain\r\n     battle losses in proportion to their population in the United\r\n     States, may be desirable but is impracticable and should be\r\n     abandoned in the interest of a logical solution to the problem of\r\n     the utilization of negroes in the armed forces.[5-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-46: Memo, Ground AG, AGF, for CofSA, 28\r\n                   Nov 45, sub: Participation of Negro Troops in the\r\n                   Postwar Military Establishment, with Incl, WDSSP\r\n                   291.2 (27 Dec 45).]\r\n\r\nThe Army Air Forces, another large employer of black servicemen,\r\nreported a slightly different World War II experience. Conforming with\r\ndepartmental policies on utilizing black soldiers, it had selected\r\nNegroes for special training on the same basis as whites with the\r\nexception of aviation cadets. Negroes with a lower stanine (aptitude)\r\nhad been accepted in order to secure enough candidates to meet the\r\nquota for pilots, navigators, and bombardiers in the black units. In\r\nits preliminary report to the War Department on the employment of\r\nNegroes, the Army Air Forces admitted that individuals of both races\r\nwith similar aptitudes and test scores had the same success in\r\ntechnical schools, could be trained as pilots and technicians in the\r\nsame period of time, and showed the same degree of mechanical\r\nproficiency. Black units, on the other hand, required considerably\r\nmore time in training than white units, sometimes simply because they\r\nwere understrength and their performance was less effective. At the\r\nsame time the Air Forces admitted that even after discounting the\r\nusual factors, such as time in service and job assignment, whites\r\nadvanced further than blacks. No explanation was offered.\r\nNevertheless, the commanding general of the Air Forces reported very\r\nlittle racial disorder or conflict overseas. There had been a\r\nconsiderable amount in the United States, however; many Air Forces\r\ncommanders ascribed this to the unwillingness of northern Negroes to\r\naccept southern laws or social customs, the insistence of black\r\nofficers on integrated officers' clubs, and the feeling among black\r\nfliers that command had been made an exclusive prerogative of white\r\nofficers rather than a matter depending on demonstrated qualification.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the others, the Army Air Forces revealed a marked\r\nchange in sentiment over the post-World War I studies of black troops.\r\nNo more were there references to congenital inferiority or inherent\r\nweaknesses, but everywhere a willingness to admit that Negroes had\r\nbeen held back by the white majority.\r\n\r\nThe commanding general of the Army Air Forces recommended Negroes be\r\napportioned among the three major forces--the Army Ground Forces, the\r\nArmy Service Forces, and the Army Air Forces--but that their numbers\r\nin no case exceed 10 percent of any command; that black servicemen be\r\ntrained exactly as whites; and that Negroes be segregated in units (p. 141)\r\nnot to exceed air group size. Unlike the others, the Army Air Forces\r\nwanted black units to have black commanders as far as possible and\r\nrecommended that the degree of segregation in messing, recreation, and\r\nsocial activities conform to the custom of the surrounding community.\r\nIt wanted Negroes assigned overseas in the same proportion as whites,\r\nand in the United States, to the extent practicable, only to those\r\nareas considered favorable to their welfare. Finally, the Air Forces\r\nwanted Negroes to be neither favored nor discriminated against in\r\ndisciplinary matters.[5-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-47: Memo, CG, AAF, for CofSA, 17 Sep 45,\r\n                   sub: Participation of Negro Troops in the Postwar\r\n                   Military Establishment, WDSSP 291.2 (1945). For the\r\n                   final report of 2 Oct 45, which summed up the\r\n                   previous recommendations, see Summary Sheet,\r\n                   AC/AS-1 for Maj Gen C. C. Chauncey, DCofAS, 2 Oct\r\n                   45, same sub and file.]\r\n\r\nAmong the responses of the subordinate commands were some exceptions\r\nto the generalizations found in those of the major forces. One\r\ncommander, for example, while concluding that segregation was\r\ndesirable, admitted that it was one of the basic causes of the Army's\r\nracial troubles and would have to be dealt with \"one way or the\r\nother.\"[5-48] Another recommended dispersing black troops, one or two in\r\na squad, throughout all-white combat units.[5-49] Still another pointed\r\nout that the performance of black officers and noncommissioned\r\nofficers in terms of resourcefulness, aggressiveness, sense of\r\nresponsibility, and ability to make decisions was comparable to the\r\nperformance of white soldiers when conditions of service were nearly\r\nequal. But the Army failed to understand this truth, the commander of\r\nthe 1st Service Command charged, and its separate and unequal\r\ntreatment discriminated in a way that would affect the efficiency of\r\nany man. The performance of black troops, he concluded, depended on\r\nhow severely the community near a post differentiated between the\r\nblack and white soldier and how well the Negro's commander\r\ndemonstrated the fairness essential to authority. The Army admitted\r\nthat black units needed superior leadership, but, he added, it\r\nmisunderstood what this leadership entailed. All too often commanders\r\nof black units acted under the belief that their men were different\r\nand needed special treatment, thus clearly suggesting racial\r\ninferiority. The Army, he concluded, should learn from its wartime\r\nexperience the deleterious effect of segregation on motivation and\r\nultimately on performance.[5-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-48: Ltr, OCSigO (Col David E.

After rehearsing the\r\nrecent history of segregation in the armed forces, he suggested that\r\nit was not enough to compare the performance of black and white\r\ntroops; the reports of black performance should be examined to\r\ndetermine whether the performance would be improved or impaired by\r\nchanging the policy of segregation. Any major Army review, he urged,\r\nshould avoid the failure of the old studies on race that based     (p. 142)\r\ndifferences in performance on racial characteristics and should\r\nquestion instead the efficiency of segregation. For him, segregation\r\nwas the heart of the matter, and he counseled that \"future policy\r\nshould be predicated on an assumption that civilian attitudes will not\r\nremain static. The basic policy of the Army should, therefore, not\r\nitself be static and restrictive, but should be so framed as to make\r\nfurther progress possible on a flexible basis.\"[5-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-51: Memo, Truman Gibson for ASW, 8 Aug\r\n                   45, ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nBefore passing Gibson's suggestions to the Assistant Secretary of War,\r\nMcCloy's executive assistant, Lt. Col. Davidson Sommers, added some\r\nideas of his own. Since it was \"pretty well recognized,\" he wrote,\r\nthat the Army had not found the answer to the efficient use of black\r\nmanpower, a first-class officer or group of officers of high rank,\r\nsupplemented perhaps with a racially mixed group of civilians, should\r\nbe designated to prepare a new racial policy. But, he warned, their\r\nwork would be ineffectual without specific directions from Army\r\nleaders. He wanted the Army to make \"eventual nonsegregation\" its\r\ngoal. Complete integration, Sommers felt, was impossible to achieve at\r\nonce. Classification test scores alone refuted the claim that \"Negroes\r\nin general make as good soldiers as whites.\" But he thought there was\r\nno need \"to resort to racial theories to explain the difference,\" for\r\nthe lack of educational, occupational, and social opportunities was\r\nsufficient.[5-52]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-52: Memo, Exec Off, ASW, for McCloy, 28\r\n                   Aug 45, ASW 291.2 (NT).]\r\n\r\nSommers had, in effect, adopted Gibson's gradualist approach to the\r\nproblem, suggesting an inquiry to determine \"the areas in which\r\nnonsegregation can be attempted first and the methods by which it can\r\nbe introduced ... instead of merely generalizing, as in the past, on\r\nthe disappointing and not very relevant experiences with large\r\nsegregated units.\" He foresaw difficulties: a certain amount of social\r\nfriction and perhaps a considerable amount of what he called\r\n\"professional Negro agitation\" because Negroes competing with whites\r\nwould probably not achieve comparable ranks or positions immediately.\r\nBut Sommers saw no cause for alarm. \"We shall be on firm ground,\" he\r\nconcluded, \"and will be able to defend our actions by relying on the\r\nunassailable position that we are using men in accordance with their\r\nability.\"\r\n\r\nCompeting with these calls for gradual desegregation was the Army's\r\ngrowing concern with securing some form of universal military\r\ntraining. Congress would discuss the issue during the summer and fall\r\nof 1945, and one of the questions almost certain to arise in the\r\ncongressional hearings was the place contemplated for Negroes. Would\r\nthe Army use Negroes in combat units? Would the Army train and use\r\nNegroes in units together with whites? Upon the answers to these\r\nquestions hinged the votes of most, if not all, southern congressmen.\r\nPrudence dictated that the Army avoid any innovations that might\r\njeopardize the chance for universal military training. In other words,\r\nwent the prevalent view, what was good for the Army--and universal\r\nmilitary training was in that category--had to come before all\r\nelse.[5-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-53: Memos, Col Frederick S. Skinner for\r\n                   Dir, Special Planning Div, WDSS, 25 May and 2 Jun\r\n                   45, sub: Participation of Negro Troops in the\r\n                   Postwar Military Establishment, WDSSP 291.2\r\n                   (1945).]\r\n\r\nEven among officers troubled by the contradictory aspects of an    (p. 143)\r\nissue clouded by morality, many felt impelled to give their prime\r\nallegiance to the Army as it was then constituted. The Army's\r\nimpressive achievement during the war, they reasoned, argued for its\r\ncontinuation in conformance with current precepts, particularly in a\r\nworld still full of hostilities. The stability of the Army came first;\r\nchanges would have to be made slowly, without risking the menace of\r\ndisruption. An attempt to mix the races in the Army seemed to most\r\nofficers a dangerous move bordering on irresponsibility. Furthermore,\r\nthe majority of Army officers, dedicated to the traditions of the\r\nservice, saw the Army as a social as well as a military institution.\r\nIt was a way of life that embraced families, wives and children. The\r\nold manners and practices were comfortable because they were well\r\nknown and understood, had produced victory, and had represented a life\r\nthat was somewhat isolated and insulated--particularly in the\r\nfield--from the currents and pressures of national life. Why then\r\nshould the old patterns be modified; why exchange comfort for possible\r\nchaos? Why should the Army admit large numbers of Negroes; what had\r\nNegroes contributed to winning World War II; what could they possibly\r\ncontribute to the postwar Army?\r\n\r\nAlthough opinion among Army officials on the future role of Negroes in\r\nthe Army was diverse and frankly questioning in tone, opinion on the\r\npast performance of black units was not. Commanders tended to agree\r\nthat with certain exceptions, particularly small service and combat\r\nsupport units, black units performed below the Army average during the\r\nwar and considerably below the best white units. The commanders also\r\ngenerally agreed that black units should be made more efficient and\r\nusually recommended they be reduced in size and filled with better\r\nqualified men. Most civil rights spokesmen and their allies in the\r\nArmy, on the other hand, viewed segregation as the underlying cause of\r\npoor performance. How, then, could the conflicting advice be channeled\r\ninto construction of an acceptable postwar racial policy? The task was\r\nclearly beyond the powers of the War Department's Special Planning\r\nDivision, and in September 1945 McCloy adopted the recommendation of\r\nSommers and Gibson and urged the Secretary of War to turn over this\r\ncrucial matter to a board of general officers. Out of this board's\r\ndeliberations, influenced in great measure by opinions previously\r\nexpressed, would emerge the long-awaited revision of the Army's policy\r\nfor its black minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Navy's Informal Inspection_\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the elaborate investigation conducted by the Army, the\r\nNavy's search for a policy consisted mainly of an informal\r\nintradepartmental review and an inspection of its black units by a\r\ncivilian representative of the Secretary of the Navy. In general this\r\ncontrast may be explained by the difference in the services' postwar\r\nproblems. The Army was planning for the enlistment of a large cross\r\nsection of the population through some form of universal military\r\ntraining; the Navy was planning for a much smaller peacetime\r\norganization of technically trained volunteers. Moreover, the Army\r\nwanted to review the performance of its many black combat units,   (p. 144)\r\nwhereas the naval establishment, which had excluded most of its\r\nNegroes from combat, had little to gain from measuring their wartime\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThe character and methods of the Secretary of the Navy had an\r\nimportant bearing on policy. Forrestal believed he had won the senior\r\nofficers to his view of equal treatment and opportunity, and to be\r\nassured of success he wanted to convince lower commanders and the\r\nranks as well. He wrote in July 1945: \"We are making every effort to\r\ngive more than lip service to the principles of democracy in the\r\ntreatment of the Negro and we are trying to do it with the minimum of\r\ncommotion.... We would rather await the practical demonstration of the\r\nsuccess of our efforts.... There is still a long road to travel but I\r\nam confident we have made a start.\"[5-54]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-54: Ltr, Forrestal to Field, 14 Jul 45,\r\n                   54-1-13, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nForrestal's wish for a racially democratic Navy did not noticeably\r\nconflict with the traditionalists' plan for a small, technically elite\r\nforce, so while the Army launched a worldwide quest in anticipation of\r\nan orthodox policy review, the Navy started an informal investigation\r\ndesigned primarily to win support for the racial program conceived by\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe Navy's search began in the last months of the war when Secretary\r\nForrestal approved the formation of an informal Committee on Negro\r\nPersonnel. Although Lester Granger, the secretary's adviser on racial\r\nmatters, had originally proposed the establishment of such a committee\r\nto \"help frame sound and effective racial policies,\"[5-55] the Chief of\r\nNaval Personnel, a preeminent representative of the Navy's\r\nprofessionals, saw an altogether different reason for the group. He\r\nendorsed the idea of a committee, he told a member of the secretary's\r\nstaff, \"not because there is anything wrong or backward about our\r\npolicies,\" but because \"we need greater cooperation from the technical\r\nBureaus in order that those policies may succeed.\"[5-56] Forrestal did\r\nlittle to define the group's purpose when on 16 April 1945 he ordered\r\nUnder Secretary Bard to organize a committee \"to assure uniform\r\npolicies\" and see that all subdivisions of the Navy were familiar with\r\neach other's successful and unsuccessful racial practices.[5-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-55: Ltr, Lester Granger to SecNav, 19 Mar\r\n                   45, 54-1-13, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-56: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for Cmdr\r\n                   Richard M.

But if Forrestal's ultimate goal was plain, his\r\nfailure to give clear-cut directions to his informal committee was\r\ncharacteristic of his handling of racial policy. He carefully followed\r\nthe recommendations of the Chief of Naval Personnel, who wanted the\r\ncommittee to be a military group, despite having earlier expressed his\r\nintention of inviting Granger to chair the committee. As announced on\r\n25 April, the committee was headed by a senior official of the Bureau\r\nof Naval Personnel, Capt. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, with another    (p. 145)\r\nof the bureau's officers serving as committee recorder.[5-58]\r\nRestricting the scope of the inquiry, Forrestal ordered that \"whenever\r\npractical\" the committee should assign each of its members to\r\ninvestigate the racial practices in his own organization.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-58: Other members of the committee\r\n                   included four senior Navy captains and\r\n                   representatives of the Marine Corps and Coast\r\n                   Guard. Memo, SecNav for Under SecNav, 25 Apr 45,\r\n                   QB495/A3-1, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless when the committee got down to work it quickly went\r\nbeyond the limited concept of its mission as advanced by the Chief of\r\nNaval Personnel. Not only did it study statistics gathered from all\r\nsections of the department and review the experiences of various\r\ncommanders of black units, it also studied Granger's immediate and\r\nlong-range recommendations for the department, an extension of his\r\nearlier wartime work for Forrestal. Specifically, Granger had called\r\nfor the formulation of a definite integration policy and for a\r\nstrenuous public relations campaign directed toward the black\r\ncommunity. He had also called for the enlistment and commissioning of\r\na significant number of Negroes in the Regular Navy, and he wanted\r\ncommanders indoctrinated in their racial responsibilities. Casting\r\nfurther afield, Granger had warned that discriminatory policies and\r\npractices in shipyards and other establishments must be eliminated,\r\nand employment opportunities for black civilians in the department\r\nbroadened.[5-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-59: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 19 Mar 45,\r\n                   54-1-13, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nThe committee deliberated on all these points, and, after meeting\r\nseveral times, announced in May 1945 its findings and recommendations.\r\nIt found that the Navy's current policies were sound and when properly\r\nexecuted produced good results. At the same time it saw a need for\r\nperiodic reviews to insure uniform application of policy and better\r\npublic relations. Such findings could be expected from a body headed\r\nby a senior official of the personnel bureau, but the committee then\r\ncame up with the unexpected--a series of recommendations for sweeping\r\nchange. Revealing the influence of the Special Programs Unit, the\r\ncommittee asked that Negroes be declared available for assignment to\r\nall types of ships and shore stations in all classifications, with\r\nselections made solely on merit. Since wholesale reassignments were\r\nimpractical, the committee recommended well-planned, gradual\r\nassimilation--it avoided the word integration--as the best policy for\r\nending the concentration of Negroes at shore activities. It also\r\nattacked the Steward's Branch as the conspicuous symbol of the\r\nNegroes' second-class status and called for the assignment of white\r\nstewards and allowing qualified stewards to transfer to general\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe committee wanted the Judge Advocate General to assign legal\r\nadvisers to all major trials, especially those involving minorities,\r\nto prevent errors in courts-martial that might be construed as\r\ndiscrimination. It further recommended that Negroes be represented in\r\nthe secretary's public relations office; that news items concerning\r\nNegroes be more widely disseminated through bureau bulletins; and,\r\nfinally, that all bureaus as well as the Coast Guard and Marine Corps\r\nbe encouraged to enroll commanders in special indoctrination programs\r\nbefore they were assigned to units with substantial numbers of     (p. 146)\r\nNegroes.[5-60]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-60: Memo, Cmte on Personnel for Under\r\n                   SecNav, 22 May 45, sub: Report and Recommendations\r\n                   of Committee on Negro Personnel, P. 16-3,\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANGER INTERVIEWING SAILORS _on inspection tour in the\r\nPacific_.]\r\n\r\nThe committee's recommendations, submitted to Under Secretary Bard on\r\n22 May 1945, were far more than an attempt to unify the racial\r\npractices of the various subdivisions of the Navy Department. For the\r\nfirst time, senior representatives of the department's often\r\nindependent branches accepted the contention of the Special Programs\r\nUnit that segregation was militarily inefficient and a gradual but\r\ncomplete integration of the Navy's general service was the solution to\r\nracial problems.\r\n\r\nYet as a formula for equal treatment and opportunity in the Navy, the\r\ncommittee's recommendations had serious omissions. Besides overlooking\r\nthe dearth of black officers and the Marine Corps' continued strict\r\nsegregation, the committee had ignored Granger's key proposal that\r\nNegroes be guaranteed a place in the Regular Navy. Almost without\r\nexception, Negroes in the Navy's general service were reservists,\r\nproducts of wartime volunteer enlistment or the draft. All but a few\r\nof the black regulars were stewards. Without assurance that many of\r\nthese general service reservists would be converted to regulars or\r\nthat provision would be made for enlistment of black regulars,     (p. 147)\r\nthe committee's integration recommendations lacked substance.\r\nSecretary Forrestal must have been aware of these omissions, but he\r\nignored them. Perhaps the problem of the Negro in the postwar Navy\r\nseemed remote during this last, climactic summer of the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRANGER WITH CREWMEN OF A NAVAL YARD CRAFT.]\r\n\r\nTo document the status of the Negro in the Navy, Forrestal turned\r\nagain to Lester Granger. Granger had acted more than once as the\r\nsecretary's eyes and ears on racial matters, and the association\r\nbetween the two men had ripened from mutual respect to close\r\nrapport.[5-61] During August 1945 Granger visited some twenty\r\ncontinental installations for Forrestal, including large depots and\r\nnaval stations on the west coast, the Great Lakes Training Center, and\r\nbases and air stations in the south. Shortly after V-J day Granger\r\nlaunched a more ambitious tour of inspection that found him traveling\r\namong the 45,000 Negroes assigned to the Pacific area.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-61: Columbia University Oral Hist Interv\r\n                   with Granger.]\r\n\r\nUnlike the Army staff, whose worldwide quest for information stressed\r\nblack performance in the familiar lessons-learned formula and only\r\nincidentally treated those factors that affected performance, Granger,\r\na civilian, never really tried to assess performance. He was,      (p. 148)\r\nhowever, a race relations expert, and he tried constantly to discover\r\nhow the treatment accorded Negroes in the Navy affected their\r\nperformance and to pass on his findings to local commanders. He later\r\nexplained his technique. First, he called on the commanding officer\r\nfor facts and opinions on the performance and morale of the black\r\nservicemen. Then he proceeded through the command, unaccompanied,\r\ninterviewing Negroes individually as well as in small and large\r\ngroups. Finally, he returned to the commanding officer to pass along\r\ngrievances reported by the men and his own observations on the\r\nconditions under which they served.[5-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-62: Granger's findings and an account of\r\n                   his inspection technique are located in Ltrs,\r\n                   Granger to SecNav, 4 Aug, 10 Aug, 27 Aug, and 31\r\n                   Oct 45; and in \"Minutes of Press Conference Held by\r\n                   Mr. Lester B. Granger,\" 1 Nov 45. All in 54-1-13,\r\n                   Forrestal file, GenRecsNav. See also Columbia\r\n                   University Oral Hist Interv with Granger.]\r\n\r\nGranger always related the performance of enlisted men to their\r\nmorale. He pointed out to the commanders that poor morale was at the\r\nbottom of the Port Chicago mass mutiny and the Guam riot, and his\r\nreport to the secretary confirmed the experiences of the Special\r\nPrograms Unit: black performance was deeply affected by the extent to\r\nwhich Negroes felt victimized by racial discrimination or handicapped\r\nby segregation, especially in housing, messing, and military and\r\ncivilian recreational facilities. Although no official policy on\r\nsegregated living quarters existed, Granger found such segregation\r\nwidely practiced at naval bases in the United States. Separate housing\r\nmeant in most cases separate work crews, thereby encouraging voluntary\r\nsegregation in mess halls. In some cases the Navy's separate housing\r\nwas carried over into nearby civilian communities where no segregation\r\nexisted before. In others shore patrols forced segregation on civilian\r\nplaces of entertainment, even when state laws forbade it. On southern\r\nbases, especially, many commanders willingly abandoned the Navy's ban\r\nagainst discrimination in favor of the racial practices of local\r\ncommunities. There enforced segregation was widespread, often made\r\nexplicit with \"colored\" and \"white\" signs.\r\n\r\nYet Granger found encouraging exceptions which he passed along to\r\nlocal commanders elsewhere. At Camp Perry, Virginia, for example,\r\nthere was a minimum of segregation, and the commanding officer had\r\nintervened to see that Virginia's segregated bus laws did not apply to\r\nNavy buses operating between the camp and Norfolk. This situation was\r\nunusual for the Navy although integrated busing had been standard\r\npractice in the Army since mid-1944. He found Camp Perry \"a pleasant\r\ncontrast\" to other southern installations, and from his experiences\r\nthere he concluded that the attitude of the commanding officer set the\r\npace. \"There is practically no limit,\" Granger said, \"to the\r\nprogressive changes in racial attitudes and relationships which can be\r\nmade when sufficiently enlightened and intelligent officer leadership\r\nis in command.\" The development of hard and fast rules, he concluded,\r\nwas unnecessary, but the Bureau of Naval Personnel must constantly see\r\nto it that commanders resisted the \"influence of local conventions.\"\r\n\r\nAt Pearl Harbor Granger visited three of the more than two hundred\r\nauxiliary ships manned by mixed crews. On two the conditions were\r\nexcellent. The commanding officer in each case had taken special   (p. 149)\r\npains to avoid racial differentiation in ratings, assignments,\r\nquarters, and messes; efficiency was superior, morale was high, and\r\nracial conflict was absent. On the third ship Negroes were separated;\r\nthey were specifically assigned to a special bunk section in the\r\ngeneral crew compartment and to one end of the chow table. Here there\r\nwas dissatisfaction among Negroes and friction with whites.\r\n\r\nAt the naval air bases in Hawaii performance and morale were good\r\nbecause Negroes served in a variety of ratings that corresponded to\r\ntheir training and ability. The air station in Oahu, for example, had\r\nblack radar operators, signalmen, yeomen, machinist mates, and others\r\nworking amiably with whites; the only sign of racial separation\r\nvisible was the existence of certain barracks, no different from the\r\nothers, set aside for Negroes.\r\n\r\nMorale was lowest in black base companies and construction battalions.\r\nIn several instances able commanding officers had availed themselves\r\nof competent black leaders to improve race relations, but in most\r\nunits the racial situation was generally poor. Granger regarded the\r\norganization of the units as \"badly conceived from the racial\r\nstandpoint.\" Since base companies were composed almost entirely of\r\nnonrated men, spaces for black petty officers were lacking. In such\r\nunits the scaffold of subordinate leadership necessary to support and\r\nuphold the authority of the officers was absent, as were opportunities\r\nfor individual advancement. Some units had been provisionally\r\nre-formed into logistic support companies, and newly authorized\r\nratings were quickly filled. This partial remedy had corrected some\r\ndeficiencies, but left unchanged a number of the black base companies\r\nin the Pacific area. Although construction battalions had workers of\r\nboth races, Granger reported them to be essentially segregated because\r\nwhites were assigned to headquarters or to supervisory posts. Some\r\nofficers had carried this arbitrary segregation into off-duty areas,\r\none commander contending that strict segregation was the civilian\r\npattern and that everyone was accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nThe Marine Corps lagged far behind the rest of the naval\r\nestablishment, and there was little pretense of conforming with the\r\nNavy's racial policy. Black marines remained rigidly segregated and\r\nnone of the few black officer candidates, all apparently well\r\nqualified, had been commissioned. Furthermore, some black marines who\r\nwanted to enlist as regulars were waiting word whether they could be\r\nincluded in the postwar Marine Corps. Approximately 85 percent of the\r\nblack marines in the Pacific area were in depot and ammunition\r\ncompanies and steward groups. In many cases their assignments failed\r\nto match their qualifications and previous training. Quite a few\r\nspecialists complained of having been denied privileges ordinarily\r\naccorded white men of similar status--for example, opportunities to\r\nattend schools for first sergeants, musicians, and radar operators.\r\nBlack technicians were frequently sent to segregated and hastily\r\nconstructed schools or detached to Army installations for schooling\r\nrather than sent to Marine Corps schools. Conversely, some white\r\nenlisted men, assigned to black units for protracted periods as\r\ninstructors, were often accorded the unusual privilege of living in\r\nofficers' quarters and eating in the officers' mess in order to\r\npreserve racial segregation.\r\n\r\nMost black servicemen, Granger found, resented the white fleet     (p. 150)\r\nshore patrols in the Pacific area which they considered biased in\r\nhandling disciplinary cases and reporting offenders. The commanding\r\nofficer of the shore patrol in Honolulu defended the practice because\r\nhe believed the use of Negroes in this duty would be highly dangerous.\r\nGranger disagreed, pointing to the successful employment of black\r\nshore patrols in such fleet liberty cities as San Diego and Miami. He\r\nsingled out the situation in Guam, which was patrolled by an all-white\r\nMarine Corps guard regarded by black servicemen as racist in attitude.\r\nFrequently, racial clashes occurred, principally over the attentions\r\nof native women, but it was the concentration of Negroes in the naval\r\nbarracks at Guam, Granger concluded, along with the lack of black\r\nshore patrols, that intensified racial isolation, induced a suspicion\r\nof racial policies, and aggravated resentment.\r\n\r\nAt every naval installation Granger heard vigorous complaints over the\r\ncontrast between black and white ratings and promotions. Discrepancies\r\ncould be explained partly by the fact that, since the general service\r\nhad been opened to Negroes fairly late in the war, many white men had\r\nmore than two years seniority over any black. But Granger found\r\nevidence that whites were transferred into units to receive promotions\r\nand ratings due eligible black members. In many cases, he found\r\n\"indisputable racial discrimination\" by commanding officers, with the\r\nresult that training was wasted, trained men were prevented from\r\nacquiring essential experience and its rewards, and resentment\r\nsmoldered.\r\n\r\nEvidence of overt prejudice aside, Granger stressed again and again\r\nthat the primary cause of the Navy's racial problems was segregation.\r\nSegregation was \"impractical and inefficient,\" he pointed out, because\r\nracial isolation bred suspicion, which in turn inflamed resentment,\r\nand finally provoked insubordination. The best way to integrate\r\nNegroes, Granger felt, was to take the most natural course, that is,\r\neliminate all special provisions, conditions, or cautions regarding\r\ntheir employment. \"There should be no exceptional approach to problems\r\ninvolving Negroes,\" he counseled, \"for the racial factor in naval\r\nservice will disappear only when problems involving Negroes are\r\naccepted as part of the Navy's general program for insuring efficient\r\nperformance and first-class discipline.\"\r\n\r\nDespite his earlier insistence on a fair percentage of Negroes in the\r\npostwar Regular Navy, Granger conceded that the number and proportion\r\nwould probably decrease during peacetime. It was hardly likely, he\r\nadded, that black enlistment would exceed 5 percent of the total\r\nstrength, a manageable proportion. He even saw some advantages in\r\nsmaller numbers, since, as the educational standards for all enlistees\r\nrose, the integration of relatively few but better qualified Negroes\r\nwould \"undoubtedly make for greater racial harmony and improved naval\r\nperformance.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the breadth and acuity of his observations, Granger suggested\r\nremarkedly few changes. Impressed by the progress made in the\r\ntreatment of Negroes during the war, he apparently expected it to\r\ncontinue uninterrupted. Although his investigations uncovered basic\r\nproblems that would continue to trouble the Navy, he did not       (p. 151)\r\nrecognize them as such. For his part, Forrestal sent Granger's\r\nvoluminous reports with their few recommendations to his military\r\nstaff and thanked the Urban League official for his contribution.[5-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 5-63: Memo, J.F. [James Forrestal] for Vice\r\n                   Adm Jacobs (Chief of Naval Personnel), 23 Aug 45;\r\n                   Ltr, SecNav to Granger, 29 Dec 45, both in 54-1-13,\r\n                   Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nAlthough different in approach and point of view, Granger's\r\nobservations neatly complemented the findings and recommendations of\r\nthe Committee on Negro Personnel. Both reinforced the secretary's\r\npostwar policy aims and both supported his gradualist approach to\r\nracial reform. Granger cited segregation, in particular the\r\nconcentration of masses of black sailors, as the principal cause of\r\nracial unrest and poor morale among Negroes. The committee urged the\r\ngradual integration of the general service in the name of military\r\nefficiency. Granger and the committee also shared certain blind spots.\r\nBoth were encouraged by the progress toward full-scale integration\r\nthat occurred during the war, but this improvement was nominal at\r\nbest, a token bow to changing conditions. Their assumption that\r\nintegration would spread to all branches of the Navy neglected the\r\nwidespread and deeply entrenched opposition to integration that would\r\nyield only to a strategy imposed by the Navy's civilian and military\r\nleaders. Finally, the hope that integration would spread ignored the\r\nfact that after the war few Negroes except stewards would be able to\r\nmeet the enlistment requirements for the Regular Navy. In short, the\r\npostwar Navy, so far as Negroes were concerned, was likely to resemble\r\nthe prewar Navy.\r\n\r\nThe search for a postwar racial policy led the Army and Navy down some\r\nof the same paths. The Army manpower planners decided that the best\r\nway to avoid the inefficient black divisions was to organize Negroes\r\ninto smaller, and therefore, in their view, more efficient segregated\r\nunits in all the arms and services. At the same time Secretary\r\nForrestal's advisers decided that the best way to avoid the\r\nconcentration of Negroes who could not be readily assimilated in the\r\ngeneral service was to integrate the small remnant of black\r\nspecialists and leave the majority of black sailors in the separate\r\nSteward's Branch. In both instances the experiences of World War II\r\nhad successfully demonstrated to the traditionalists that large-scale\r\nsegregated units were unacceptable, but neither service was yet ready\r\nto accept large-scale integration as an alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6                                                          (p. 152)\r\n\r\nNew Directions\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the services developed new racial policies in the immediate\r\npostwar period. Because these policies were responses to racial\r\nstresses peculiar to each service and were influenced by the varied\r\nexperiences of each, they were, predictably, disparate in both\r\nsubstance and approach; because they were also reactions to a common\r\nset of pressures on the services they proved to be, perhaps not so\r\npredictably, quite similar in practical consequences. One pressure\r\nfelt by all the services was the recently acquired knowledge that the\r\nnation's military manpower was not only variable but also limited in\r\nquantity. Military efficiency demanded, therefore, that the services\r\nnot only make the most effective use of available manpower, but also\r\nimprove its quality. Since Negroes, who made up approximately 10\r\npercent of the population, formed a substantial part of the nation's\r\nmanpower, they could no longer be considered primarily a source of\r\nunskilled labor. They too must be employed appropriately, and to this\r\nend a higher proportion of Negroes in the services must be qualified\r\nfor specialized jobs.\r\n\r\nContinuing demands by civil rights groups added to the pressure on the\r\nservices to employ Negroes according to their abilities. Arguing that\r\nNegroes had the right to enjoy the privileges and share the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship, civil rights spokesmen appeared\r\ndetermined to test the constitutionality of the services' wartime\r\npolicies in the courts. Their demands placed the Truman administration\r\non the defensive and served warning on the armed forces that never\r\nagain could they look to the exclusion of black Americans as a\r\nlong-term solution to their racial problems.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such pressures, the services had to reckon with a more\r\nimmediate problem. Postwar black reenlistment, particularly among\r\nservice men stationed overseas, was climbing far beyond expectation.\r\nAs the armed forces demobilized in late 1945 and early 1946, the\r\npercentage of Negroes in the Army rose above its wartime high of 9.68\r\npercent of the enlisted strength and was expected to reach 15 percent\r\nand more by 1947. Aside from the Marine Corps, which experienced a\r\nrapid drop in black enlistment, the Navy also expected a rise in the\r\npercentage of Negroes, at least in the near future. The increase\r\noccurred in part because Negroes, who had less combat time than whites\r\nand therefore fewer eligibility points for discharge, were being\r\nseparated from service later and more slowly. The rise reflected as\r\nwell the Negro's expectation that the national labor market would\r\ndeteriorate in the wake of the war. Although greater opportunities for\r\nemployment had developed for black Americans, civilians already filled\r\nthe posts and many young Negroes preferred the job security of a\r\nmilitary career. But there was another, more poignant reason why many\r\nNegroes elected to remain in uniform: they were afraid to reenter  (p. 153)\r\nwhat seemed a hostile society and preferred life in the armed forces,\r\nimperfect as that might be. The effect of this increase on the\r\nservices, particularly the largest service, the Army, was sharp and\r\ndirect. Since many Negroes were poorly educated, they were slow to\r\nlearn the use of sophisticated military equipment, and since the best\r\neducated and qualified men, black and white, tended to leave, the\r\nservices faced the prospect of having a large proportion of their\r\nenlisted strength black and unskilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gillem Board Report_\r\n\r\nClearly, a new policy was necessary, and soon after the Japanese\r\nsurrender Assistant Secretary McCloy sent to the recently appointed\r\nSecretary of War the accumulated pile of papers on the subject of how\r\nbest to employ Negroes in the postwar Army. Along with the answers to\r\nthe questionnaires sent to major commanders and a collection of\r\ninteroffice memos went McCloy's reminder that the matter ought to be\r\ndealt with soon. McCloy wanted to form a committee of senior officers\r\nto secure \"an objective professional view\" to be used as a base for\r\nattacking the whole race problem. But while he considered it important\r\nto put this professional view on record, he still expected it to be\r\nsubject to civilian review.[6-1]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-1: Memo, McCloy for SW, 17 Sep 45, SW\r\n                   291.2; Ltr, McCloy to author, 25 Sep 69, CMH\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nRobert P. Patterson became Secretary of War on 27 September 1945,\r\nafter serving with Henry Stimson for five years, first as assistant\r\nand later as under secretary. Intimately concerned with racial matters\r\nin the early years of the war, Patterson later became involved in war\r\nprocurement, a specialty far removed from the complex and\r\ncontroversial racial situation that faced the Army. Now as secretary\r\nhe once again assumed an active role in the Army's black manpower\r\nproblems and quickly responded to McCloy's request for a policy\r\nreview.[6-2] In accordance with Patterson's oral instructions, General\r\nMarshall appointed a board, under the chairmanship of Lt. Gen. Alvan\r\nC. Gillem, Jr., which met on 1 October 1945. Three days later a formal\r\ndirective signed by the Deputy Chief of Staff and approved by the\r\nSecretary of War ordered the board to \"prepare a policy for the use of\r\nthe authorized Negro manpower potential during the postwar period\r\nincluding the complete development of the means required to derive the\r\nmaximum efficiency from the full authorized manpower of the nation in\r\nthe event of a national emergency.\"[6-3] On this group, to be known as\r\nthe Gillem Board, would fall the responsibility for formulating a\r\npolicy, preparing a directive, and planning the use of Negroes in the\r\npostwar Army.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-2: See, for example, Memo, SW for CofS, 7\r\n                   Nov 45, SW 291.2; see also Ltr, McCloy to author,\r\n                   25 Sep 69.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-3: Quoted in Memo, Gen Gillem for CofS,\r\n                   17 Nov 45, sub: Report of Board of General Officers\r\n                   on Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Post-War\r\n                   Army, copy in CSGOT 291.2 (1945) BP.]\r\n\r\nNone of the board members was particularly prepared for the new\r\nassignment. General Gillem, a Tennessean, had come up through the\r\nranks to command the XIII Corps in Europe during World War II.\r\nAlthough he had written one of the 1925 War College studies on the (p. 154)\r\nuse of black troops and had many black units in his corps, Gillem\r\nprobably owed his appointment to the fact that he was a three-star\r\ngeneral, available at the moment, and had recently been selected by\r\nthe Chief of Staff to direct a Special Planning Division study on the\r\nuse of black troops that had been superseded by the new board.[6-4]\r\nBurdened with the voluminous papers collected by McCloy, Gillem headed\r\na board composed of Maj. Gen. Lewis A. Pick, a Virginian who had built\r\nthe Ledo Road in the China-Burma-India theater; Brig. Gen. Winslow C.\r\nMorse of Michigan, who had served in a variety of assignments in the\r\nArmy Air Forces culminating in wartime duties in China; and Brig. Gen.\r\nAln D. Warnock, the recorder without vote, a Texan who began his\r\ncareer in the Arizona National Guard and had served in Iceland during\r\nWorld War II.[6-5] These men had broad and diverse experience and gave\r\nthe board a certain geographical balance. Curiously enough, none was a\r\ngraduate of West Point.[6-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-4: Interv, Capt Alan Osur, USAF, with Lt\r\n                   Gen Alvan C.

Less\r\nthan a month after their first session, Gillem informed the Chief of\r\nStaff that they had already reached certain conclusions. They\r\nrecognized the need to build on the close relationships developed\r\nbetween the races during the war by introducing progressive measures\r\nthat could be put into operation promptly and would provide for the\r\nassignment of black troops on the basis of individual merit and\r\nability alone. After studying and comparing the racial practices of\r\nthe other services, the board decided that the Navy's partial\r\nintegration had stimulated competition which improved black\r\nperformance without causing racial friction. By contrast, strict\r\nsegregation in the Marine Corps required longer training periods and\r\ncloser supervision for black marines. In his memorandum Gillem\r\nrefrained from drawing the logical conclusion and simply went on to\r\nnote that the Army had, for example, integrated its black and white\r\npatients in hospitals because of the greater expense, inefficiency,\r\nand general impracticality of duplicating complex medical          (p. 155)\r\nequipment and installations.[6-7] By inference the same disadvantages\r\napplied to maintaining separate training facilities, operational units,\r\nand the rest of the apparatus of the shrinking Army establishment. At\r\none point in his progress report, Gillem seemed close to recommending\r\nintegration, at least to the extent already achieved in the Navy. But\r\nstated explicitly such a recommendation would have been a radical\r\nstep, out of keeping with the climate of opinion in the country and in\r\nthe Army itself.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-7: Memo, Gen Gillem for CofS, 26 Oct 45,\r\n                   sub: Progress Rpt on Board Study of Utilization of\r\n                   Negro Manpower in the Post-War Army, WDCSA 291.2;\r\n                   see also Interv, Osur with Gillem.]\r\n\r\nOn 17 November 1945 the Gillem Board finished the study and sent its\r\nreport to the Chief of Staff.[6-8] In six weeks the board had questioned\r\nmore than sixty witnesses, consulted a mass of documentary material,\r\nand drawn up conclusions and recommendations on the use of black\r\ntroops. The board declared that its recommendations were based on two\r\ncomplementary principles: black Americans had a constitutional right\r\nto fight, and the Army had an obligation to make the most effective\r\nuse of every soldier. But the board also took into account reports of\r\nthe Army's wartime experience with black units. It referred constantly\r\nto this experience, citing the satisfactory performance of the black\r\nservice units and some of the smaller black combat units, in\r\nparticular the artillery and tank battalions. It also described the\r\nblack infantry platoons integrated into white companies in Europe as\r\n\"eminently successful.\" At the same time large black combat units had\r\nnot been satisfactory, most often because their junior officers and\r\nnoncommissioned officers lacked the ability to lead. The difficulties\r\nthe Army encountered in properly placing its black troops during the\r\nwar, the board decided, stemmed to some extent from inadequate staff\r\nwork and improper planning. Poor staff work allowed a disproportionate\r\nnumber of Negroes with low test scores to be allocated to combat\r\nelements. Lack of early planning, constant reorganization and\r\nregrouping of black units, and continuous shifting of individuals from\r\none type of training to another had confused and bewildered black\r\ntroops, who sometimes doubted that the Army intended to commit them to\r\ncombat at all.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-8: Memo, Gillem for CofS, 17 Nov 45, sub:\r\n                   Report of Board of General Officers on the\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Post-War Army.\r\n                   Unless otherwise noted this section is based on the\r\n                   report.]\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, the board declared, to avoid repetition of this\r\nexperience. Advance planning was needed to develop a broader base of\r\ntrained men among black troops to provide cadres and leaders to meet\r\nnational emergencies more efficiently. The Army had to realize and\r\ntake advantage of the advances made by Negroes in education, industry,\r\nand government service. The wide range of skills attained by Negroes\r\nhad enhanced their military value and made possible a broader\r\nselectivity with consequent benefit to military efficiency. Thus, the\r\nArmy had to adopt a racial policy that provided for the progressive\r\nand flexible use of black manpower \"within proportions corresponding\r\nto those in the civilian population.\" This policy, it added, must \"be\r\nimplemented _promptly ... must_ be objective by nature ... must    (p. 156)\r\neliminate, at the earliest practicable moment, any special\r\nconsideration based on race ... and should point towards the immediate\r\nobjective of an evaluation of the Negro on the basis of individual\r\nmerit and ability.\"\r\n\r\nThe board made eighteen specific recommendations, of which the\r\nfollowing were the most important.\r\n\r\n\"That combat and service units be organized and activated from the\r\nNegro manpower available in the postwar Army to meet the requirements\r\nof training and expansion and in addition qualified individuals be\r\nutilized in appropriate special and overhead units.\" The use of\r\nqualified Negroes in overhead units was the first break with the\r\ntraditional policy of segregation, for though black enlisted men would\r\ncontinue to eat and sleep in segregated messes and barracks, they\r\nwould work alongside white soldiers and perform the same kind of duty\r\nin the same unit.\r\n\r\n\"The proportion of Negro to white manpower as exists in the civil\r\npopulation be the accepted ratio for creating a troop basis in the\r\npostwar Army.\"[6-9]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-9: The 10 percent quota that eventually\r\n                   emerged from the Gillem Board was an approximation;\r\n                   Gillem later recalled that the World War II\r\n                   enlisted ratio was nearer 9.5 percent, but that\r\n                   General Eisenhower, the Chief of Staff, saying he\r\n                   could not remember that, suggested making it \"an\r\n                   even 10 percent.\" See Interv, Osur with Gillem.]\r\n\r\n\"That Negro units organized or activated for the postwar Army conform\r\nin general to other units of the postwar Army but the maximum strength\r\nof type [sic] units should not exceed that of an infantry regiment or\r\ncomparable organization.\" Here the board wanted the Army to avoid the\r\ndivision-size units of World War II but retain separate black units\r\nwhich would be diversified enough to broaden the professional base of\r\nNegroes in the Regular Army by offering them a larger selection of\r\nmilitary occupations.\r\n\r\n\"That in the event of universal training in peacetime additional\r\nofficer supervision is supplied to units which have a greater than\r\nnormal percentage of personnel falling into A.G.C.T. classifications\r\nIV and V.\" Such a policy had existed in World War II, but was never\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\"That a staff group of selected officers whose background has included\r\ncommanding troops be formed within the G-1 Division of the staffs of\r\nthe War Department and each major command of the Army to assist in the\r\nplanning, promulgation, implementation and revision of policies\r\naffecting all racial minorities.\" This was the administrative\r\nmachinery the board wanted to facilitate the prompt and efficient\r\nexecution of the Army's postwar racial policies.\r\n\r\n\"That reenlistment be denied to regular Army soldiers who meet only\r\nthe minimum standards.\" This provision was in line with the concept\r\nthat the peacetime Army was a cadre to be expanded in time of\r\nemergency. As long as the Army accepted all reenlistments regardless\r\nof aptitude and halted black enlistments when black strength exceeded\r\n10 percent, it would deny enlistment to many qualified Negroes. It\r\nwould also burden the Army with low-scoring men who would never rise\r\nabove the rank of private and whose usefulness in a peacetime      (p. 157)\r\ncadre, which had the function of training for wartime expansion,\r\nwould be extremely limited.\r\n\r\n\"That surveys of manpower requirements conducted by the War Department\r\ninclude recommendations covering the positions in each installation of\r\nthe Army which could be filled by Negro military personnel.\" This\r\nsuggestion complemented the proposal to use Negroes in overhead\r\npositions on an individual basis. By opening more positions to\r\nNegroes, the Army would foster leadership, maintain morale, and\r\nencourage a competitive spirit among the better qualified. By forcing\r\ncompetition with whites \"on an individual basis of merit,\" the Army\r\nwould become more attractive as a career to superior Negroes, who\r\nwould provide many needed specialists as a \"nucleus for rapid\r\nexpansion of Army units in time of emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\"That groupings of Negro units with white units in composite\r\norganizations be continued in the postwar Army as a policy.\" Since\r\nWorld War II demonstrated that black units performed satisfactorily\r\nwhen grouped or operated with white combat units, the inclusion of a\r\nblack service company in a white regiment or a heavy weapons company\r\nin an infantry battalion could perhaps be accomplished \"without\r\nencountering insurmountable difficulties.\" Such groupings would build\r\nup a professional relationship between blacks and whites, but, the\r\nboard warned, experimentation must not risk \"the disruption of\r\ncivilian racial relationships.\"\r\n\r\n\"That there be accepted into the Regular Army an unspecified number of\r\nqualified Negro officers ... that all officers, regardless of race, be\r\nrequired to meet the same standard for appointment ... be accorded\r\nequal rights and opportunities for advancement and professional\r\nimprovement; and be required to meet the same standard for\r\nappointment, promotion and retention in all components of the Army.\"\r\nThe board set no limit on the number of black officers in the Army,\r\nnor did it suggest that black officers be restricted to service in\r\nblack units.\r\n\r\nIts report rendered, the board remained in existence ready to make\r\nrevisions \"as may be warranted\" by the comments of the many\r\nindividuals and agencies that were to review the policy in conformance\r\nwith a directive of the Secretary of War.[6-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-10: Memo, Brig Gen H.

Hodes, ADCofS,\r\n                   for Gillem, 24 Nov 45, sub: War Department Special\r\n                   Board on Negro Management, WDCSA 320.2 (17 Nov\r\n                   45).]\r\n\r\nNo two individuals were more intimately concerned with the course of\r\nevents that led to the Gillem Board Report than John J. McCloy and\r\nTruman Gibson, and although both were about to leave government\r\nservice, each gave the new Secretary of War his opinion of the\r\nreport.[6-11] McCloy called the report a \"fine achievement\" and a \"great\r\nadvance over previous studies.\" It was most important, he said, that\r\nthe board had stated the problem in terms of manpower efficiency. At\r\nthe same time both men recognized ambiguities in the board's       (p. 158)\r\nrecommendations, and their criticisms were strong, precise, and,\r\nconsidering the conflicts that developed in the Army over these\r\nissues, remarkedly acute. Both agreed the report needed a clear\r\nstatement on the basic issue of segregation, and they wanted the board\r\nto eliminate the quota. Gibson pointed out that the board proposed as\r\na long-range objective the utilization of all persons on the basis of\r\nindividual ability alone. \"This means, of course,\" he announced with\r\nmore confidence than was warranted, \"a completely integrated Army.\" In\r\nthe interest of eventually achieving an integrated Army he was willing\r\nto settle for less than immediate and total integration, but\r\nnevertheless he attacked the board for what he called the vagueness of\r\nits recommendations. Progressive and planned integration, he told\r\nSecretary Patterson, demanded a clear and explicit policy stating that\r\nsegregation was outmoded and integration inevitable, and the Army\r\nshould move firmly and steadily from one to the other.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-11: Memo, Civilian Aide for ASW, 13 Nov\r\n                   45, ASW 291.2 Negro Troops (Post War); Ltr, idem to\r\n                   SW, 13 Nov 45; Memo, McCloy for Patterson, 24 Nov\r\n                   45; Memo, Gibson for SW, 28 Nov 45.

Experience showed, he reminded the secretary, \"that we\r\ncannot get enforcement of policies that permit of any possibility of\r\nmisconstruction.\" Directness, he said, was required in place of\r\nequivocation based on delicacy. If the Gillem Board intended black\r\nofficers to command white officers and men, it should have said so\r\nflatly. If it meant the Army should try unsegregated and mixed units,\r\nit should have said so. Its report, McCloy concluded, should have put\r\nthese matters beyond doubt. He was equally forthright in his rejection\r\nof the quota, which he found impractical because it deprived the Army\r\nof many qualified Negroes who would be unable to enlist when the quota\r\nwas full. Even if the quota was meant as a floor rather than a\r\nceiling, McCloy thought it objectionable. \"I do not see any place,\" he\r\nwrote, \"for a quota in a policy that looks to utilize Negroes on the\r\nbasis of ability.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Gillem Board revealed the Army's willingness to compromise in\r\ntreating a pressing efficiency problem, detailed comments by\r\ninterested staff agencies revealed how military traditionalists hoped\r\nto avoid a pressing social problem. For just as McCloy and Gibson\r\ncriticized the board for failing to spell out concrete procedures\r\ntoward integration, other staff experts generally approved the board's\r\nreport precisely because its ambiguities committed them to very\r\nlittle. Their specific criticisms, some betraying the biases of the\r\ntimes, formed the basis of the standard traditionalist defense of the\r\nracial _status quo_ for the next five years.\r\n\r\nComments from the staff's personnel organization set the tone of this\r\ncriticism.[6-12] The Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel, G-1, Maj.\r\nGen. Willard S. Paul, approved the board's recommendations, calling\r\nthem a \"logical solution to the problem of effective utilization of\r\nNegro manpower.\" Although he thought the report \"sufficiently      (p. 159)\r\ndetailed to permit intelligent, effective planning,\" he passed along\r\nwithout comment the criticisms of his subordinates. He was opposed to\r\nthe formation of a special staff group. \"We must soon reach the\r\npoint,\" he wrote, \"where our general staff must be able to cope with\r\nsuch problems without the formation of ad hoc committees or\r\ngroups.\"[6-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-12: For examples of this extensive review\r\n                   of the Gillem Board Report in G-1, see the\r\n                   following Memos: Col J.

Idwal H. Edwards, was chiefly concerned with the timing of the\r\nnew policy. In trying to employ black manpower on a broader\r\nprofessional scale, he warned, the Army must recognize the \"ineptitude\r\nand limited capacity of the Negro soldier.\" He wanted various phases\r\nof the new policy timed \"with due consideration for all factors such\r\nas public opinion, military requirements and the military situation.\"\r\nIf the priority given public opinion in the sequence of these factors\r\nreflected Edwards's view of their importance, the list is somewhat\r\ncurious. Edwards concurred in the recommendations, although he wanted\r\nthe special staff group established in the personnel office rather\r\nthan in his organization, and he rejected any arbitrary percentage of\r\nblack officers. More black officers could be obtained through\r\nexpansion of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, he suggested, but\r\nhe rejected the board's call for special classification of all\r\nenlistees in reception and training centers, on grounds that the\r\ncenters were not adequate for the task.[6-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-14: G-3 Summary Sheet to ADCofS, 2 Jan\r\n                   46, sub: War Department Special Board on Negro\r\n                   Manpower, WDGCT 291.21 (24 Nov 45).]\r\n\r\nThe chief of the General Staff's Operations Division, Lt. Gen. John E.\r\nHull, dismissed the Gillem report with several blunt statements: black\r\nenlisted men should be assigned to black units capable of operational\r\nuse within white units at the rate of one black battalion per\r\ndivision; a single standard of professional proficiency should be\r\nfollowed for white and black officers; and \"no Negro officer be given\r\ncommand of white troops.\"[6-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-15: Memo, Lt Gen John E.

Gen. Ira C. Eaker,\r\nagreed with the board that the Army should not be \"a testing ground\r\nfor problems in race relationships.\" Neither did he think the Air\r\nForces should organize units for the sole purpose of \"advancing the\r\nprestige of one race, especially when it is necessary to utilize\r\npersonnel that do not have the proper qualifications in order to keep\r\nthese units up to strength.\" Black combat units should be limited by\r\nthe 10 percent quota and by the small number of Negroes qualified for\r\ntactical training. Most Negroes should be placed in Air Forces service\r\nunits, where \"their wartime record was the best,\" even though such\r\nplacement would leave the Air Forces open to charges of\r\ndiscrimination. The idea of experimental groupings of black and white\r\nunits in composite organizations might prove \"impractical,\" Eaker\r\nwrote to the Chief of Staff, because an Air Forces group operated as\r\nan integral unit rather than as three or four separate squadrons;\r\nunits often exchanged men and equipment, and common messes were used.\r\nComposite organizations were practical \"only when it is not        (p. 160)\r\nnecessary for the units to intermingle continually in order to carry\r\non efficiently.\" Why intermingling could not be synonymous with\r\nefficiency, he failed to explain. The inference was clear that\r\nsegregation was not only normal but best.\r\n\r\nYet he advocated continuing integrated flying schools and agreed that\r\nNegroes should be stationed where community attitudes were favorable.\r\nHe cited the difficulties involved in stationing. For more than two\r\nyears the Army Air Forces had tried to find a suitable base for its\r\nonly black tactical group. Even in northern cities with large black\r\ncommunities--Syracuse, New York, Columbus, Ohio, and Windsor Locks,\r\nConnecticut, among others--officials had vehemently protested against\r\nhaving the black group.\r\n\r\nThe War Department, Eaker concluded, \"should never be ahead of popular\r\nopinion on this subject; otherwise it will put itself in a position of\r\nstimulating racial disorders rather than overcoming them.\" Along these\r\nlines, and harking back to the Freeman Field incident, he protested\r\nagainst regulations reaffirmed by the Gillem Board for the joint use\r\nof clubs, theaters, post exchanges, and the like at stations in\r\nlocalities where such use was contrary to civilian practices.[6-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-16: 1st Ind, Lt Gen Ira C.

The headquarters recommended a policy be formulated for\r\nthe entire military establishment; only then should individual\r\nelements of the armed forces come forward with their own policies. The\r\nidea that Negroes should serve in numbers proportionate to their\r\npercentage of the population and bear their share of battle losses\r\n\"may be desirable but is impracticable and should be abandoned in the\r\ninterest of a logical solution.\"[6-17] Since the abilities of Negroes\r\nwere limited, the report concluded, their duties should be restricted.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-17: Memo, Lt Col S.

The Army Service Forces had\r\nsuccessfully used an even larger percentage of Negroes than the Gillem\r\nBoard contemplated. Concurring generally with the board's\r\nrecommendations, he cautioned that the War Department should not\r\ndictate the use of Negroes in the field; to do so would be a serious\r\ninfringement of command prerogatives that left each commander free to\r\nselect and assign his men. As for the experimental groupings of black\r\nand white units, the general believed that such mixtures were\r\nappropriate for combat units but not for the separate small units\r\ncommon to the Army Service Forces. Separate, homogeneous companies or\r\nbattalions formed during the war worked well, and experience proved\r\nmixed units impractical below group and regimental echelons.\r\n\r\nThe Service Forces commander called integration infeasible \"for    (p. 161)\r\nthe present and foreseeable future.\" It was unlawful in many areas, he\r\npointed out, and not common practice elsewhere, and requiring soldiers\r\nto follow a different social pattern would damage morale and defeat\r\nthe Army's effort to increase the opportunities and effectiveness of\r\nblack soldiers. He did not try to justify his contention, but his\r\nmeaning was clear. It would be a mistake for the Army to attempt to\r\nlead the nation in such reforms, especially while reorganization,\r\nunification, and universal military training were being\r\nconsidered.[6-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-18: Memo, Maj Gen Daniel Noce, Actg CofS,\r\n                   ASF, for CofS, 28 Dec 45, sub: War Department\r\n                   Special Board on Negro Manpower, copy at Tab J,\r\n                   Supplemental Report of War Department Special Board\r\n                   on Negro Manpower, 26 Jan 46, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nReconvened in January 1946 to consider the comments on its original\r\nreport, the Gillem Board deliberated for two more weeks, heard\r\nadditional witnesses, and stood firm in its conclusions and\r\nrecommendations.[6-19] The policy it proposed, the board emphasized, had\r\none purpose, the attainment of maximum manpower efficiency in time of\r\nnational emergency. To achieve this end the armed forces must make\r\nfull use of Negroes now in service, but future use of black manpower\r\nhad to be based on the experience gained in two major wars. The board\r\nconsidered the policy it was proposing flexible, offering opportunity\r\nfor advancement to qualified individuals and at the same time making\r\npossible for the Army an economic use of national manpower as a whole.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-19: Supplemental Report of War Department\r\n                   Special Board on Negro Manpower, \"Policy for\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Post-War\r\n                   Army,\" 26 Jan 46. The following quotations are\r\n                   taken from this amended version of the Gillem Board\r\n                   Report, a copy of which, with all tabs and annexes,\r\n                   is in CMH.]\r\n\r\nTo its original report the board added a statement at once the hope\r\nand despair of its critics and supporters.\r\n\r\n     _The Initial Objectives_: The utilization of the proportionate\r\n     ratio of the manpower made available to the military\r\n     establishment during the postwar period. The manpower potential\r\n     to be organized and trained as indicated by pertinent\r\n     recommendations.\r\n\r\n     _The Ultimate Objective_: The effective use of _all_ manpower\r\n     made available to the military establishment in the event of a\r\n     major mobilization at some unknown date against an undetermined\r\n     aggressor. The manpower to be utilized, in the event of another\r\n     major war, in the Army without regard to antecedents or race.\r\n\r\n     When, and if such a contingency arises, the manpower of the\r\n     nation should be utilized in the best interests of the national\r\n     security.\r\n\r\n     The Board cannot, and does not, attempt to visualize at this\r\n     time, intermediate objectives. Between the first and ultimate\r\n     objective, timely phasing may be interjected and adjustments made\r\n     in accordance with conditions which may obtain at this\r\n     undetermined date.\r\n\r\nThe board based its ultimate objective on the fact that the black\r\ncommunity had made important advances in education and job skills in\r\nthe past generation, and it expected economic and educational\r\nconditions for Negroes to continue to improve. Since such improvement\r\nwould make it possible to employ black manpower in a variety of ways,\r\nthe board's recommendations could be only a guide for the future, a\r\npolicy that must remain flexible.\r\n\r\nTo the specific objections raised by the reviewing agencies, the board\r\nreplied that although black units eventually should be commanded by\r\nblack officers \"no need exists for the assignment of Negro commanders\r\nto units composed of white troops.\" It also agreed with those who  (p. 162)\r\nfelt it would be beneficial to correlate Army racial policies with\r\nthose of the Navy. On other issues the board stood firm. It rejected\r\nthe proposal that individual commanders be permitted to choose\r\npositions where Negroes could be employed in overhead installations on\r\nthe grounds that this delegation of responsibility \"hazards lack of\r\nuniformity and makes results doubtful.\" It refused to drop the quota,\r\narguing it was needed for planning purposes. At the same time the\r\nboard did admit that the 10 percent ratio, suitable for the moment,\r\nmight be changed in the future in the interest of efficiency--though\r\nchanged in which way it did not say.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY PATTERSON.]\r\n\r\nThe board rejected the proposition that the Army Service Forces and\r\nthe Army Air Forces were unable to use small black units in white\r\norganizations and took a strong stand for elimination of the\r\nprofessional private, the career enlistee lacking the background or\r\nability to advance beyond the lowest rank. Finally, the board rejected\r\ndemands that the color line be reestablished in officers' messes and\r\nenlisted recreational facilities. \"This large segment of the\r\npopulation contributed materially to the success attained by our\r\nmilitary forces.... The Negro enjoyed the privileges of citizenship\r\nand, in turn, willingly paid the premium by accepting service. In many\r\ninstances, this payment was settled through the medium of the supreme\r\nsacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe board's recommendations were well received, at least in the\r\nhighest echelons of the War Department. General Dwight D. Eisenhower,\r\nnow Chief of Staff,[6-20] quickly sent the proposed policy to the\r\nSecretary of War with a recommendation for approval \"subject to such\r\nadjustment as experience shows is necessary.\"[6-21] On 28 February 1946\r\nSecretary Patterson approved the new policy in a succinct restatement\r\nof the board's recommendations. The policy and the full Gillem Board\r\nReport were published as War Department Circular 124 on 27 April 1946.\r\nAt the secretary's direction the circular was dispatched to the field\r\n\"without delay.\"[6-22] On 4 March the report was released to the\r\npress.[6-23] The most exhaustive and intensive inquiry ever made   (p. 163)\r\nby the Army into the employment of black manpower had survived the\r\nreview and analysis process with its conclusions and recommendations\r\nintact.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-20: Eisenhower succeeded Marshall as\r\n                   Chief of Staff on 19 November 1945.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-21: Memo, CofS for SW, 1 Feb 46, sub:\r\n                   Supplemental Report of Board of Officers on\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Post-War Army,\r\n                   WDCSA 320.2 (1 Feb 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-22: Ltr, TAG for CG's, AGF et al., 6 May\r\n                   46, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the\r\n                   Post-War Army, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-23: WD Press Release, 4 Mar 46, \"Report\r\n                   of Board of Officers on Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Manpower in the Post-War Army.\"]\r\n\r\nAttitudes toward the new policy varied with interpretations of the\r\nboard's statement of objectives. Secretary Patterson saw in the report\r\n\"a significant development in the status of the Negro soldiers in the\r\nArmy.\" The immediate effect of using Negroes in composite units and\r\noverhead assignments, he predicted, would be to change War Department\r\npolicy on segregation.[6-24] But the success of the policy could not be\r\nguaranteed by a secretary of war, and some of his advisers were more\r\nguarded in their estimates. To Truman Gibson, once again in government\r\nservice, but briefly this time, the report seemed a good beginning\r\nbecause it offered a new approach, one that had originated within the\r\nArmy itself. Yet Gibson was wary of its chances for success: The\r\nboard's recommendations, he told the Assistant Secretary of War, would\r\nmake for a better Army \"only if they are effectively carried out.\"[6-25]\r\nThe newly appointed assistant secretary, Howard C. Petersen, was\r\nequally cautious.

Ray, Gibson's successor as the secretary's adviser on racial\r\naffairs,[6-27] stressed the board's ultimate objective to employ\r\nmanpower without regard to race and called its recommendations \"a step\r\nin the direction of efficient manpower utilization.\" It was a\r\nnecessary step, he added, because \"any racial group which lives under\r\nthe stigma of implied inferiority inherent in a system of enforced\r\nseparation cannot give over-all top performance in peace or in\r\nwar.\"[6-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-27: Ray, a former commander of an\r\n                   artillery battalion in the 92d Infantry Division,\r\n                   was appointed civilian aide on 2 January 1946; see\r\n                   WD Press Release, 7 Jan 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-28: Ltr, Marcus Ray to Capt Warman K.\r\n                   Welliver, 10 Apr 46, copy in CMH.

The _Norfolk Journal and Guide_ called the report a\r\nstep in the right direction, but reserved judgment until the Army\r\ncarried out the recommendations.[6-29] To a distinguished black\r\nhistorian who was writing an account of the Negro in World War II, the\r\nGillem Board Report reflected the Army's ambiguity on racial matters.\r\n\"It is possible,\" L. D. Reddick of the New York Public Library wrote,\r\n\"to interpret the published recommendations as pointing in opposite\r\ndirections.\"[6-30] One NAACP official charged that it \"tries to dilute\r\nJim-Crow by presenting it on a smaller scale.\" After citing the\r\ntremendous advances made by Negroes and all the reasons for ending\r\nsegregation, he accused the Gillem Board of refusing to take the   (p. 164)\r\nlast step.[6-31] Most black papers adopted the same attitude,\r\ncharacterizing the new policy as \"the same old Army.\" The Pittsburgh\r\n_Courier_, for one, observed that the new policy meant that the Army\r\ncommand had undergone no real change of heart.[6-32] Other segments of\r\nthe public were more forebearing. One veterans' organization commended\r\nthe War Department for the work of the Gillem Board but called its\r\nanalysis and recommendations incomplete. Citing evidence that Jim\r\nCrow, not the enemy, \"defeated\" black combat units, the chairman of\r\nthe American Veterans Committee called for an immediate end to\r\nsegregation.[6-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-29: Norfolk _Journal and Guide_, March 9,\r\n                   1946.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-30: Ltr, L.

He admitted\r\nsegregation's tenacious hold on Army thinking and that black units\r\nwould continue to exist for some time, but he promised movement toward\r\ndesegregation. He also made the Army's usual distinction between\r\nsegregation and discrimination. Though there were many instances of\r\nunfair treatment during the war, he noted, these were individual\r\nmatters, inconsistent with Army policy, which \"has consistently\r\ncondemned discrimination.\" Discrimination, he concluded, must be\r\nblamed on \"defects\" of enforcement, which would always exist to some\r\ndegree in any organization as large as the Army.[6-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-34: Ltrs, ASW to Bernard H.

So substantive a change in social practice,\r\nthe Army had always argued, required the sustained support of the\r\nAmerican public, and judging from War Department correspondence and\r\npress notices large segments of the public remained unaware of what\r\nthe Army was trying to do about its \"Negro problem.\" Most military\r\njournalists continued to ignore the issue; perhaps they considered the\r\nsubject of the employment of black troops unimportant compared with\r\nthe problems of demobilization, atomic weaponry, and service\r\nunification. For example, in listing the principal military issues\r\nbefore the United States in the postwar period, military analyst\r\nHanson Baldwin did not mention the employment of Negroes in the\r\nservice.[6-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-35: Hanson Baldwin, \"Wanted: An American\r\n                   Military Policy,\" _Harper's_ 192 (May\r\n                   1946):403-13.]\r\n\r\nGiven the composition of the Gillem Board and the climate of opinion\r\nin the nation, the report was exemplary and fair, its conclusions\r\nprogressive. If in the light of later developments the recommendations\r\nseem timid, even superficial, it should be remembered to its credit\r\nthat the board at least made integration a long-range goal of the Army\r\nand made permanent the wartime guarantee of a substantial black\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the ambiguities in the Gillem Board's recommendations\r\nwould be useful to those commanders at all levels of the Army who were\r\ndevoted to the racial _status quo_. Gillem and his colleagues      (p. 165)\r\ndiscussed black soldiers in terms of social problems rather than\r\nmilitary efficiency. As a result, their recommendations treated the\r\nproblem from the standpoint of how best Negroes could be employed\r\nwithin the traditional segregated framework even while they spoke of\r\nintegration as an ultimate goal. They gave their blessing to the\r\ncontinued existence of segregated units and failed to inquire whether\r\nsegregation might not be a factor in the inefficiency and\r\nineffectiveness of black units and black soldiers. True, they sought\r\nto use qualified Negroes in specialist jobs as a solution to better\r\nemployment of black manpower, but this effort could have little\r\npractical effect. Few were qualified--and determination of\r\nqualifications was often done by those with little sympathy for the\r\nNegro and even less for the educated Negro. Black serviceman holding\r\ncritical specialties and those assigned to overhead installations\r\nwould never amount to more than a handful of men whose integration\r\nduring duty hours only would fall far short even of tokenism.\r\n\r\nTo point out as the board did that the policy it was recommending no\r\nlonger required segregation was meaningless. Until the Army ordered\r\nintegration, segregation, simply by virtue of inertia, would remain.\r\nAs McCloy, along with Gibson and others, warned, without a strong,\r\nexplicit statement of intent by the Army the changes in Army practice\r\nsuggested by the Gillem Board would be insignificant. The very\r\nacceptance of the board's report by officials traditionally opposed to\r\nintegration should have been fair warning that the report would be\r\ndifficult to use as a base for a progressive racial policy; in fact it\r\ncould be used to justify almost any course of action. From the start,\r\nthe War Department encountered overwhelming difficulties in carrying\r\nout the board's recommendations, and five years later the ultimate\r\nobjective was still out of reach.\r\n\r\nClearly, the majority of Army officers viewed segregated service as\r\nthe acceptable norm. General Jacob L. Devers, then commanding general\r\nof Army Ground Forces, gave a clue to their view when he told his\r\nfellow officers in 1946 that \"we are going to put colored battalions\r\nin white divisions. This is purely business--the social side will not\r\nbe brought into it.\"[6-36] Here then was the dilemma: Was not the Army a\r\nsocial institution as well as a fighting organization? The solution to\r\nthe Army's racial problems could not be achieved by ignoring the\r\nsocial implications. On both counts there was a reluctance among many\r\nprofessional soldiers to take in Negroes. They registered acute social\r\ndiscomfort at the large influx of black soldiers, and many who had\r\ndevoted their lives to military service had very real misgivings over\r\nusing Negroes in white combat units or forming new black combat units\r\nbecause they felt that black fighters in the air and on the ground had\r\nperformed badly in the past. To entrust the fighting to Negroes who\r\nhad failed to prove their competence in this highest mission of the\r\nArmy seemed to them to threaten the institution itself.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-36: Remarks by Gen J. L. Devers, Armored\r\n                   Conference Report, 16 May 46.]\r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, the work of the Gillem Board was a\r\nprogressive step in the history of Army race relations. It broke with\r\nthe assumption implicit in earlier Army policy that the black soldier\r\nwas inherently inferior by recommending that Negroes be assigned   (p. 166)\r\ntasks as varied and skilled as those handled by white soldiers. It\r\nalso made integration the Army's goal by declaring as official policy\r\nthe ultimate employment of all manpower without regard to race.\r\n\r\nEven the board's insistence on a racial quota, it could be argued, had\r\nits positive aspects, for in the end it was the presence of so many\r\nblack soldiers in the Korean War that finally ended segregation. In\r\nthe meantime, controversy over the quota, whether it represented a\r\nfloor supporting minimum black participation or a ceiling limiting\r\nblack enlistment, continued unabated, providing the civil rights\r\ngroups with a focal point for their complaints. No matter how hard the\r\nArmy tried to justify the quota, the quota increased the Army's\r\nvulnerability to charges of discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Integration of the General Service_\r\n\r\nThe Navy's postwar revision of racial policy, like the Army's, was the\r\ninevitable result of its World War II experience. Inundated with\r\nunskilled and undereducated Negroes in the middle of the war, the Navy\r\nhad assigned most of these men to segregated labor battalions and was\r\nsurprised by the racial clashes that followed. As it began to\r\nunderstand the connection between large segregated units and racial\r\ntensions, the Navy also came to question the waste of the talented\r\nNegro in a system that denied him the job for which he was qualified.\r\nPerhaps more to the point, the Navy's size and mission made\r\nimmediately necessary what the Army could postpone indefinitely.\r\nUnlike the Army, the Navy seriously modified its racial policy in the\r\nlast year of the war, breaking up some of the large segregated units\r\nand integrating Negroes in the specialist and officer training\r\nschools, in the WAVES, and finally in the auxiliary fleet and the\r\nrecruit training centers.\r\n\r\nYet partial integration was not enough. Lester Granger's surveys and\r\nthe studies of the secretary's special committee had demonstrated that\r\nthe Navy could resolve its racial problems only by providing equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity. But the absurdity of trying to operate two\r\nequal navies, one black and one white, had been obvious during the\r\nwar. Only total integration of the general service could serve justice\r\nand efficiency, a conclusion the civil rights advocates had long since\r\nreached. After years of leaving the Navy comparatively at peace, they\r\nnow began to demand total integration.\r\n\r\nThere was no assurance, however, that a move to integration was\r\nimminent when Granger returned from his final inspection trip for\r\nSecretary Forrestal in October 1945. Both Granger and the secretary's\r\nCommittee on Negro Personnel had endorsed the department's current\r\npractices, and Granger had been generally optimistic over the reforms\r\ninstituted toward the end of the war. Admirals Nimitz and King both\r\nendorsed Granger's recommendations, although neither saw the need for\r\nfurther change.[6-37] For his part Secretary Forrestal seemed determined\r\nto maintain the momentum of reform. \"What steps do we take,\" he    (p. 167)\r\nasked the Chief of Naval Personnel, \"to correct the various practices\r\n... which are not in accordance with Navy standards?\"[6-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-37: Ltr, CINCPAC&POA to SecNav via Ch,\r\n                   NavPers, 30 Oct 45, sub: Negro Naval\r\n                   Personnel--Pacific Ocean Areas, and 2d Ind, CNO, 7\r\n                   Dec 45, same sub, both in P16-3/MM, OpNavArchives.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-38: Memo, J. F. for Adm Jacobs, 23 Aug\r\n                   45, 54-1-13, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL DENFELD.]\r\n\r\nIn response the Bureau of Naval Personnel circulated the Granger\r\nreports throughout the Navy and ordered steps to correct practices\r\nidentified by Granger as \"not in accordance with Navy standards.\"[6-39]\r\nBut it was soon apparent that the bureau would be selective in\r\nadopting Granger's suggestions. In November, for example, the Chief of\r\nNaval Personnel, Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, arguing that officers\r\n\"could handle black personnel without any special indoctrination,\"\r\nurged the secretary to reject Granger's recommendation that an office\r\nbe established in headquarters to deal exclusively with racial\r\nproblems. At the same time some of the bureau's recruiting officials\r\nwere informing Negroes that their reenlistment in the Regular Navy was\r\nto be limited to the Steward's Branch.[6-40] With the help of Admiral\r\nNimitz, Chief of Naval Operations, Forrestal quickly put an end to\r\nthis recruiting practice, but he paid no further attention to racial\r\nmatters except to demand in mid-December a progress report on racial\r\nreforms in the Pacific area.[6-41] Nor did he seem disturbed when the\r\nPacific commander reported a large number of all-black units, some\r\nwith segregated recreational facilities, operating in the Pacific area\r\nas part of the permanent postwar naval organization.[6-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-39: Memo, Asst Ch, NavPers, for SecNav,\r\n                   10 Sep 45, sub: Ur Memo of August 23, 1945,\r\n                   Relative to Lester B.

Despite the general reluctance of the bureau to\r\nliberalize the Navy's racial policy, there had been all along some\r\nmanpower experts who wanted to increase the number of specialties open\r\nto black sailors. Capt. Hunter Wood, Jr., for example, suggested in\r\nJanuary 1946 that the bureau make plans for an expansion in\r\nassignments for Negroes. Wood's proposal fell on the sympathetic ears\r\nof Admiral Denfeld, who considered the Granger recommendations     (p. 168)\r\npractical for the postwar Navy. Denfeld, of course, was well aware\r\nthat these recommendations had been endorsed by Admirals King and\r\nNimitz as well as Forrestal, and he himself had gone on record as\r\nbelieving that Negroes in the peacetime Navy should lose none of the\r\nopportunities opened to them during the war.[6-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-43: Admiral Denfeld's statement to the\r\n                   black press representatives in this regard is\r\n                   referred to in Memo, Capt H. Wood, Jr., for Chief,\r\n                   NavPers, 2 Jan 46, P16-3/MM, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nDenfeld had had considerable experience with the Navy's evolving\r\nracial policy in his wartime assignment as assistant chief of\r\npersonnel where his principal concern had been the efficient\r\ndistribution and assignment of men. He particularly objected to the\r\nfact that current regulations complicated what should have been the\r\nroutine transfer of sailors. Simple control procedures for the\r\nsegregation of Negroes in general service had been effective when\r\nNegroes were restricted to particular shore stations and duties, he\r\ntold Admiral Nimitz on 4 January 1946, but now that Negroes were\r\nfrequently being transferred from shore to sea and from ship to ship\r\nthe restriction of Negroes to auxiliary ships was becoming extremely\r\ndifficult to manage and was also \"noticeably contrary to the\r\nnon-differentiation policy enunciated by the Secretary of the Navy.\"\r\nThe only way to execute that policy effectively and maintain\r\nefficiency, he concluded, was to integrate the general service\r\ncompletely. Denfeld pointed out that the admission of Negroes to the\r\nauxiliary fleet had caused little friction in the Navy and passed\r\nalmost unnoticed by the press. Secretary Forrestal had promised to\r\nextend the use of Negroes throughout the entire fleet if the\r\npreliminary program proved practical, and the time had come to fulfill\r\nthat promise. He would start with \"the removal of restrictions\r\ngoverning the type of duty to which general service Negroes can be\r\nassigned,\" but would limit the number of Negroes on any ship or at any\r\nshore station to a percentage no greater than that of general service\r\nNegroes throughout the Navy.[6-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-44: Ltr, Chief, NavPers, to CNO, 4 Jan\r\n                   46, sub: Assignment of Negro Personnel, P16-3MM,\r\n                   BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nWith the enlistment of the Chief of Naval Personnel in the cause, the\r\nmove to an integrated general service was assured. On 27 February 1946\r\nthe Navy published Circular Letter 48-46: \"Effective immediately all\r\nrestrictions governing types of assignments for which Negro naval\r\npersonnel are eligible are hereby lifted. Henceforth, they shall be\r\neligible for all types of assignments in all ratings in all activities\r\nand all ships of naval service.\" The letter went on to specify that\r\n\"in housing, messing, and other facilities, there would be no special\r\naccommodations for Negroes.\" It also directed a redistribution of\r\npersonnel by administrative commands so that by 1 October 1946 no ship\r\nor naval activity would be more than 10 percent Negro. The single\r\nexception would be the Naval Academy, where a large contingent of\r\nblack stewards would be left intact to serve the midshipmen's meals.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Circular Letter 48-46 was an important step in the\r\nNavy's racial history. In less than one generation, in fewer years\r\nactually than the average sailor's service life, the Navy had made a\r\ncomplete about-face. In a sense the new policy was a service       (p. 169)\r\nreform rather than a social revolution; after a 23-year hiatus\r\nintegration had once again become the Navy's standard racial policy.\r\nSince headlines are more often reserved for revolutions than\r\nreformations, the new policy attracted little attention. The\r\nmetropolitan press gave minimum coverage to the event and never\r\nbothered to follow later developments. For the most part the black\r\npress treated the Navy's announcement with skepticism. On behalf of\r\nSecretary Forrestal, Lester Granger invited twenty-three leading black\r\neditors and publishers to inspect ships in the fleet as well as shore\r\nactivities to see for themselves the changes being made. Not one\r\naccepted. As one veteran put it, the editors shrank from praising the\r\nNavy's policy change for fear of being proved hasty. They preferred to\r\nremain on safe ground, \"givin' 'em hell.\"[6-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-45: As reported in Ltr, Granger to\r\n                   author, 25 Jun 69, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nThe editors had every reason to be wary: integration was seriously\r\ncircumscribed in the new directive, which actually offered few\r\nguarantees of immediate change. Applying only to enlisted men in the\r\nshore establishment and on ships, the directive ignored the Navy's\r\nall-white officer corps and its nonwhite servants branch of stewards.\r\nAimed at abolishing discrimination in the service, it failed to\r\nguarantee either through enlistment, assignment guidelines, or\r\nspecific racial quotas a fair proportion of black sailors in the\r\npostwar Navy. Finally, the order failed to create administrative\r\nmachinery to carry out the new policy. In a very real sense the new\r\npolicy mirrored tradition. It was naval tradition to have black\r\nsailors in the integrated ranks and a separate Messman's Branch. The\r\nreturn to this tradition embodied in the order complemented\r\nForrestal's philosophy of change as an outgrowth of self-realized\r\nreform. At the same time naval tradition did not include the concept\r\nof high-ranking black officers, white servants, and Negroes in\r\nspecialized assignments. Here Forrestal's hope of self-reform did not\r\nmaterialize, and equal treatment and opportunity for Negroes in the\r\nNavy remained an elusive goal.\r\n\r\nBut Forrestal and his military subordinates made enough of a start to\r\ndraw the fire of white segregationists. The secretary answered charges\r\nand demands in a straightforward manner. When, for example, a\r\ncongressman complained that \"white boys are being forced to sleep with\r\nthese negroes,\" Forrestal explained that men were quartered and messed\r\naboard ship according to their place in the ship's organization\r\nwithout regard to race. The Navy made no attempt to prescribe the\r\nnature or extent of their social relationships, which were beyond the\r\nscope of its authority. Although Forrestal expressed himself as\r\nunderstanding the strong feelings of some Americans on this matter, he\r\nmade it clear that the Navy had finally decided segregation was the\r\nsurest way to emphasize and perpetuate the gap between the races and\r\nhad therefore adopted a policy of integration.[6-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-46: Ltr, Congressman Stephen Pace of\r\n                   Georgia to Forrestal, 22 Jun 46; Ltr, Forrestal to\r\n                   Pace, 14 Aug 46, both in 54-1-13, Forrestal file,\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nWhat Forrestal said was true, but the translation of the Navy's\r\npostwar racial policy into the widespread practice of equal treatment\r\nand opportunity for Negroes was still before him and his officers. (p. 170)\r\nTo achieve it they would have to fight the racism common in many\r\nsegments of American society as well as bureaucratic inertia. If put\r\ninto practice the new policy might promote the efficient use of naval\r\nmanpower and give the Navy at least a brief respite from the criticism\r\nof civil rights advocates, but because of Forrestal's failure to give\r\nclear-cut direction--a characteristic of his approach to racial\r\nreform--the Navy might well find itself proudly trumpeting a new\r\npolicy while continuing its old racial practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marine Corps_\r\n\r\nAs part of the naval establishment, the Marine Corps fell under the\r\nstrictures of Secretary Forrestal's announced policy of racial\r\nnondiscrimination.[6-47] At the same time the Marine Corps was\r\nadministratively independent of the Chief of Naval Operations and the\r\nChief of Naval Personnel, and Circular Letter 48-46, which\r\ndesegregated the Navy's general service, did not apply to the corps.\r\nIn the development of manpower policy the corps was responsible to the\r\nNavy, in organization it closely resembled the Army, but in size and\r\ntradition it was unique. Each of these factors contributed to the\r\ndevelopment of the corps' racial policy and helped explain its postwar\r\nracial practices.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-47: The latest pronouncement of that\r\n                   policy was ALNAV 423-45.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the similarities in organization and mission between the\r\nArmy and the Marine Corps, the commandant leaned toward the Army's\r\nsolution for racial problems. The Army staff had contended that\r\nracially separate service was not discriminatory so long as it was\r\nequal, and through its Gillem Board policy it accepted the\r\nresponsibility of guaranteeing that Negroes would be represented in\r\nequitable numbers and their treatment and opportunity would be similar\r\nto that given whites. Since the majority of marines served in the\r\nground units of the Fleet Marine Force, organized like the Army in\r\nregiments, battalions, and squadrons with tables of organization and\r\nequipment, the formation of racially separate units presented no great\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Marine Corps was similar to the Army in organization, it\r\nwas very different in size and tradition. With a postwar force of\r\nlittle more than 100,000 men, the corps was hardly able to guarantee\r\nits segregated Negroes equal treatment and opportunity in terms of\r\nspecialized training and variety of assignment. Again in contrast to\r\nthe Army and Navy with their long tradition of Negroes in service, the\r\nMarine Corps, with a few unauthorized exceptions, had been an\r\nexclusively white organization since 1798. This habit of racial\r\nexclusion was strengthened by those feelings of intimacy and\r\nfraternity natural to any small bureaucracy. In effect the marines\r\nformed a small club in which practically everybody knew everybody else\r\nand was reluctant to admit strangers.[6-48] Racial exclusion often\r\nwarred with the corps' clear duty to provide the fair and equal\r\nservice for all Americans authorized by the Secretary of the Navy. At\r\none point the commandant, General Alexander Vandegrift, even had   (p. 171)\r\nto remind his local commanders that black marines would in fact be\r\nincluded in the postwar corps.[6-49]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-48: See USMC Oral History Interviews, Lt\r\n                   Gen James L.

Many Negroes trained long and\r\nhard for antiaircraft duty, yet a senior group commander found them\r\nill-suited to the work because of \"emotional instability and lack of\r\nappreciation of materiel.\" One battery commander cited the \"mechanical\r\nineptitude\" of his men; another fell back on \"racial characteristics\r\nof the Negro as a whole\" to explain his unit's difficulty.[6-50]\r\nEmbodying rash generalization and outright prejudice, the reports of\r\nthese commanders circulated in Marine Corps headquarters, also\r\nrevealed that a large group of black marines experienced enough\r\nproblems in combat training to cast serious doubt on the reliability\r\nof the defense battalions. This doubt alone could explain the corps'\r\ndecision to relegate the units to the backwaters of the war zone.\r\nSeeing only the immediate shortcomings of the large black combat\r\nunits, most commanders ignored the underlying reasons for the failure.\r\nThe controversial commander of the 51st Defense Battalion, Col. Curtis\r\nW. LeGette,[6-51] however, gave his explanation to the commandant in\r\nsome detail. He reported that more than half the men in the 51st as it\r\nprepared for overseas deployment--most of them recent draftees--were\r\nin the two lowest categories, IV and V, for either general\r\nclassification or mechanical aptitude. That some 212 of the\r\nnoncommissioned officers of the units were also in categories IV and V\r\nwas the result of the unit's effort to carry out the commandant's\r\norder to replace white noncommissioned officers as quickly as\r\npossible. The need to develop black noncommissioned officers was\r\nunderscored by LeGette, who testified to a growing resentment among\r\nhis black personnel at the assignment of new white noncoms.\r\nSymptomatic of the unit's basic problems in 1944 was what LeGette\r\ncalled an evolving \"occupational neurosis\" among white officers forced\r\nto serve for lengthy periods with black marines.[6-52]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-50: AAA Gp, 51st Defense Bn, FMF,\r\n                   Montford Pt., Gp Cmdr's Endorsement on Annual\r\n                   Record Practice, Year 1943, 20 Dec 43; AAA Gp, 51st\r\n                   Defense Bn, FMF, Montford Pt., Battery Cmdr's\r\n                   Narrative Report of Record Practice, 1943, 21 Dec\r\n                   43; idem, Battery Cmdr's Narrative Rpt (signed R.\r\n                   H.

The\r\nbasic cause of race problems was the rigid concentration of        (p. 172)\r\noften undertrained and undereducated men, who were subjected to racial\r\nslurs and insensitive treatment by some white officials and given\r\nlittle chance to serve in preferred military specialties or to advance\r\nin the labor or defense units or steward details to which they were\r\ninvariably consigned. But this basic cause was ignored by Marine Corps\r\nplanners when they discussed the postwar use of Negroes. They\r\npreferred to draw other lessons from the corps' wartime experience.\r\nThe employment of black marines in small, self-contained units\r\nperforming traditional laboring tasks was justified precisely because\r\nthe average black draftee was less well-educated and experienced in\r\nthe use of the modern equipment. Furthermore, the correctness of this\r\nprocedure seemed to be demonstrated by the fact that the corps had\r\nbeen relatively free of the flare-ups that plagued the other services.\r\nMany officials would no doubt have preferred to eliminate race\r\nproblems by eliminating Negroes from the corps altogether. Failing\r\nthis, they were determined that regular black marines continue to\r\nserve in those assignments performed by black marines during the war:\r\nin service units, stewards billets, and a few antiaircraft artillery\r\nunits, the postwar successors to defense battalions.[6-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-53: Shaw and Donnelly, _Blacks in the\r\n                   Marine Corps_, pp 47-49; Interv, James Westfall\r\n                   with Col Curtis W. LeGette (USMC, Ret.), 8 Feb 72,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL THOMAS.]\r\n\r\nThe development of a postwar racial policy to carry out the Navy\r\nDepartment's nondiscrimination order in the Marine Corps fell to the\r\nDivision of Plans and Policies and its director, Brig. Gen. Gerald C.\r\nThomas. It was a complicated task, and General Thomas and his staff\r\nafter some delay established a series of guidelines intended to steer\r\na middle path between exclusion and integration that would be\r\nnondiscriminatory. In addition to serving in the Steward's Branch,\r\nwhich contained 10 percent of all blacks in the corps, Negroes would\r\nserve in segregated units in every branch of the corps, and their\r\nstrength would total some 2,800 men. This quota would not be like that\r\nestablished in the Army, which was pegged to the number of black\r\nsoldiers during the war and which ultimately was based on national\r\npopulation ratios. The Marine Corps ratio of blacks to whites would be\r\ncloser to 1 in 30 and would merely represent the estimated number of\r\nbillets that might be filled by Negroes in self-sustaining segregated\r\nunits.\r\n\r\nThe directorate also established a table of distribution plan that for\r\nthe first time provided for black regular marines in aviation units\r\nand several other Marine Corps activities. Aviation units alone    (p. 173)\r\naccounted for 25 percent of the marines in the postwar corps, General\r\nThomas contended, and must absorb their proportionate share of black\r\nstrength. Further, the Navy's policy of nondiscrimination demanded\r\nthat all types of assignments be opened to black marines. Segregation\r\n\"best suits the needs of the Marine Corps,\" General Thomas concluded.\r\nIgnoring the possibility of black officers and women marines, he\r\nthought that the opening of all specialties and types of duty to the\r\nenlisted ranks would find the Marine Corps \"paralleling Navy\r\npolicy.\"[6-54] Clearly, the Division of Plans and Policies wanted the\r\ncorps to adopt a formula roughly analogous to the Gillem Board's\r\nseparate but equal system without that body's provisions for a fixed\r\nquota, black officers, or some integrated service.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-54: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 8 Apr 46, sub: Negro Personnel in the\r\n                   Post-War Marine Corps. This memo was not submitted\r\n                   for signature and was superseded by a memo of 13\r\n                   May 46.]\r\n\r\nBut even this concession to nondiscrimination was never approved, for\r\nthe Plans and Policies Division ran afoul of a basic fact of\r\nsegregation: the postwar strength of many elements of the Marine Corps\r\nwas too small to support separate racial units. The Director of\r\nAviation, for example, argued that because of the size and nature of\r\nhis operation, segregated service was impossible. A substantial number\r\nof his enlisted men also did double duty by serving in air stations\r\nwhere Negroes could not be segregated, he explained. Only completely\r\nseparate aviation units, police and maintenance, and construction\r\nunits would be available for Negroes, a state of affairs \"which would\r\nbe open to adverse criticism.\" He recommended instead that Negroes in\r\naviation be used only as stewards.[6-55] He failed to explain how this\r\nsolution would escape adverse criticism.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-55: Memos, Dir, Aviation, for CMC, 26 Apr\r\n                   46, sub: Negro Personnel in the Post-War Marine\r\n                   Corps, and 31 May 46, sub: Enlistment of Negroes\r\n                   \"For Duty in Aviation Units Only.\"]\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas rejected these proposals, repeating that Secretary\r\nForrestal's nondiscrimination policy demanded that a separate but\r\nequal system be extended throughout the Marine Corps. He also borrowed\r\none of the Gillem Board's arguments: Negroes must be trained in the\r\npostwar military establishment in every occupation to serve as a cadre\r\nfor future general mobilizations.[6-56] Thomas did not mention the fact\r\nthat although large branches such as Fleet Marine Force aviation could\r\nmaintain separate but equal living facilities for its black marines,\r\neven they would have to provide partially integrated training and\r\nworking conditions. And the smaller organizations in the corps would\r\nbe forced to integrate fully if forced to accept black marines. In\r\nshort, if the corps wanted segregation it must pay the price of\r\ncontinued discrimination against black marines in terms of numbers\r\nenlisted and occupations assigned.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-56: Div of Plans and Policies (signed G.\r\n                   C.

One solution to the\r\n\"Negro question,\" General Thomas told him, was complete integration\r\nand the abolition of racial quotas, but Thomas did not press this\r\nsolution. Instead, he reviewed for Vandegrift the racial policies of\r\nthe other services, pointing out that these policies had more often\r\nbeen devised to \"appease the Negro press and other 'interested'    (p. 174)\r\nagencies than to satisfy their own needs.\" Until the matter was\r\nsettled on a \"higher level,\" Thomas concluded, the services were not\r\nrequired to go further than had been their custom, and until\r\nVandegrift decided on segregation or integration, setting quotas for\r\nthe different branches in the corps was inappropriate. Thomas himself\r\nrecommended that segregated units be adopted and that a quota be\r\ndevised only after each branch of the corps reported how many Negroes\r\nit could use in segregated units.[6-57] Vandegrift approved Thomas's\r\nrecommendation for segregated black units, and the Marine Corps lost\r\nthe chance, temporarily, to adopt a policy in line with either the\r\nNavy's limited and integrated system or the Army's separate but equal\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-57: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 13 May 46, sub: Negro Personnel in the\r\n                   Post-War Marine Corps.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas spent the summer collecting and reviewing the proposals\r\nof the corps' various components for the employment of black marines.\r\nOn the basis of this review General Vandegrift approved a postwar\r\npolicy for the employment of Negroes in the Marine Corps on 26\r\nSeptember 1946. The policy called for the enlistment of 2,264 Negroes,\r\n264 as stewards, the rest to serve in separate units, chiefly in\r\nground security forces of the Fleet Marine Force in Guam and Saipan\r\nand in Marine Corps activities of the naval shore establishment. No\r\nNegroes except stewards would serve in Marine aviation, Marine forces\r\nafloat, or, with the exception of service depots, in the Marine\r\nlogistic establishment.[6-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 6-58: Idem for CMC, 25 Sep 46, sub:\r\n                   Post-War Negro Personnel Requirements.

In the end the Marine Corps'\r\nwhite-only tradition had proved strong enough to resist the\r\nprogressive impulses that were pushing the other services toward some\r\nrelaxation of their segregation policies. Committed to limiting\r\nNegroes to a token representation and employing black marines in\r\nrigidly self-contained units, the Marine Corps could not establish a\r\nquota for Negroes based on national racial proportions and could offer\r\nno promise of equal treatment and opportunity in work assignments and\r\npromotions.\r\n\r\nThus all the services emerged from their deliberations with postwar\r\npolicies that were markedly different in several respects but had in\r\ncommon a degree of segregation. The Army, declaring that military\r\nefficiency demanded ultimate integration, temporized, guaranteeing as\r\na first step an intricate system of separate but equal treatment and\r\nopportunity for Negroes. The Marine Corps began with the idea that\r\nseparate but equal service was not discriminatory, but when equal\r\nservice proved unattainable, black marines were left with separatism\r\nalone. The Navy announced the most progressive policy of all,\r\nproviding for integration of its general service. Yet it failed to\r\nbreak the heavy concentration of Negroes in the Steward's Branch,  (p. 175)\r\nwhere no whites served. And unlike the segregated Army, the integrated\r\nNavy, its admission standards too high to encourage black enlistments,\r\ndid not guarantee to take any black officers or specialists.\r\n\r\nNone of these policies provided for the equal treatment and\r\nopportunity guaranteed to every black serviceman under the\r\nConstitution, although the racial practices of all the services stood\r\nfar in advance of those of most institutions in the society from which\r\nthey were derived. The very weaknesses and inadequacies inherent in\r\nthese policies would in themselves become a major cause of the reforms\r\nthat were less than a decade away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7                                                          (p. 176)\r\n\r\nA Problem of Quotas\r\n\r\n\r\nThe War Department encountered overwhelming problems when it tried to\r\nput the Gillem Board's recommendations into practice, and in the end\r\nonly parts of the new policy for the use of black manpower were ever\r\ncarried out. The policy foundered for a variety of reasons: some\r\nimplicit in the nature of the policy itself, others the result of\r\nmanpower exigencies, and still others because of prejudices lingering\r\nin the staff, the Army, and the nation at large.\r\n\r\nEven before the Army postwar racial policy was published in War\r\nDepartment Circular 124 on 27 April 1946 it met formidable opposition\r\nin the staff. Although Secretary Patterson had approved the new course\r\nof action, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel, General Paul,\r\nsent a copy of what he called the \"proposed\" policy to the Army Air\r\nForces for further comment.[7-1] The response of the air commander,\r\nGeneral Carl Spaatz, revealed that he too considered the policy still\r\nopen for discussion. He suggested that the Army abandon the quota in\r\nfavor of admitting men on the basis of intelligence and professional\r\nability and forbid enlistment to anyone scoring below eighty in the\r\nentry tests. He wanted the composite organizations of black and white\r\nunits recommended by the board held to a minimum, and none smaller\r\nthan an air group--a regimental-size unit. Black combat units should\r\nhave only black service units in support. In fact, Spaatz believed\r\nthat most black units should be service units, and he wanted to see\r\nNegroes employed in overhead assignments only where and when their\r\nspecialties were needed. He did not want jobs created especially for\r\nthem.[7-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-1: DF, ACofS, G-1, to CG, AAF, 15 Mar 46,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Postwar\r\n                   Army, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-2: Memo, CG, AAF, for ACofS, G-1, 3 Apr\r\n                   46, sub: Utilization of Manpower in the Postwar\r\n                   Army, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThese were not the only portents of difficulty for the new policy.\r\nBefore its publication General Paul had announced that he would not\r\nestablish a staff group on racial affairs as called for by the Gillem\r\nBoard. Citing manpower shortages and the small volume of work he\r\nenvisaged, Paul planned instead to divide such duties between his\r\nWelfare Branch and Military Personnel Services Group.[7-3] The concept\r\nof a central authority for the direction of racial policy was further\r\nweakened in April when Paul invited the Assistant Chief of Staff for\r\nOrganization and Training, General Edwards, one of whose primary tasks\r\nwas to decide the size and number of military units, to share\r\nresponsibility for carrying out the recommendations of the Gillem\r\nBoard.[7-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-3: DF, ACofS, G-1, to ASW, 26 Mar 46,\r\n                   sub: Implementation of WD Cir 124, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-4: Idem to ACofS, G-3, 29 Apr 46, sub:\r\n                   Implementation of WD Cir 124, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\nAssistant Secretary Petersen was perturbed at the mounting         (p. 177)\r\nevidence of opposition. Specifically, he believed Spaatz's comments\r\nindicated a lack of accord with Army policy, and he wanted the Army\r\nAir Forces told that \"these basic matters are no longer open for\r\ndiscussion.\" He also wanted to establish a troop basis that would\r\nlead, without the imposition of arbitrary percentages, to the\r\nassignment of a \"fair proportion\" of black troops to all major\r\ncommands and their use in all kinds of duties in all the arms and\r\nservices. Petersen considered the composite unit one of the most\r\nimportant features of the new policy, and he wanted \"at least a few\"\r\nsuch units organized soon. He mentioned the assignment of a black\r\nparachute battalion to the 82d Airborne Division as a good place to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nPetersen had other concerns. He was distressed at the dearth of black\r\nspecialists in overhead detachments, and he wondered why War\r\nDepartment Circular 105, which provided for the assignment of men to\r\ncritically needed specialties, explicitly excluded Negroes.[7-5] He\r\nwanted the circular revised. Above all, Petersen feared the new policy\r\nmight falter from a lack of aggressive leadership. He estimated that\r\nat first it would require at least the full attention of several\r\nofficers under the leadership of an \"aggressive officer who knows the\r\nArmy and has its confidence and will take an active interest in\r\nvigorous enforcement of the program.\"[7-6] By implication Petersen was\r\nasking General Paul to take the lead.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-5: WD Cir 105, 10 Apr 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-6: Memo, ASW for ACofS, G-1, 27 Apr 46,\r\n                   ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nWithin a week of Petersen's comments on leadership, Paul had revised\r\nCircular 105, making its provisions applicable to all enlisted men,\r\nregardless of race or physical profile.[7-7] A few days later, he was\r\nassuring Petersen that General Spaatz's comments were \"inconsistent\r\nwith the approved recommendations\" and were being disregarded.[7-8] Paul\r\nalso repeated the principal points of the new policy for the major\r\ncommanders, especially those dealing with composite units and overhead\r\nassignments for black specialists. He stressed that, whenever\r\npossible, Negroes should be assigned to places where local community\r\nattitudes were most favorable and no undue burden would be imposed on\r\nlocal civilian facilities.[7-9]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-7: G-1 Summary Sheet for CofS, 3 May 46,\r\n                   sub: Changes to WD Cir 105, 1946, WDGAP 291.2.\r\n                   Revision appeared as WD Circular 142, 17 May 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-8: DF, ACofS, G-1, to ASW, 13 May 46,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in Postwar Army,\r\n                   WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-9: Ltr, TAG to CG's, AGF, AAF, and ASF, 6\r\n                   May 46, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in\r\n                   Postwar Army, AGAM-PM 291.2 (30 Apr 46); idem to\r\n                   CG's, 10 Jun 46, same sub, same file (4 Jun 46).]\r\n\r\nGeneral Paul believed the principal impediment to practical\r\napplication of the new policy was not so much the opposition of field\r\ncommanders as the fact that many black units continued to perform\r\npoorly. He agreed with Marcus Ray, Civilian Aide to the Secretary of\r\nWar, who had predicted as early as January 1946 that the success of\r\nthe Gillem Board's recommendations would depend on how many Negroes of\r\nhigher than average ability the armed forces could attract and retain.\r\nRay reasoned that among the Negroes enlisting in the Regular Army--14\r\npercent of the 1945 total--were large numbers of noncommissioned   (p. 178)\r\nofficers in the three highest grades whose abilities were limited.\r\nThey were able to maintain their ratings, usually in service units,\r\nbecause their duties required knowledge of neither administration nor\r\nweapons. Truckmasters, foremen, riggers, and the like, they rushed to\r\nreenlist in order to freeze themselves in grade. Since many of these\r\nmen were in the two lowest test categories, they could not supply the\r\nleaders needed for black units. Ray wanted to replace these men with\r\nbetter educated enlistees who could be used on the broadened\r\nprofessional base recommended by the Gillem Board. To that end he\r\nwanted the Army to test all enlisted men, discharge those below\r\nminimum standards, and launch a recruiting campaign to attract better\r\nqualified men, both black and white.[7-10] For his part, Paul also\r\ndeplored the enlistment of men who were, in his words, \"mentally\r\nincapable of development into the specialists, technicians, and\r\ninstructors that we must have in the post-war Regular Army.\"[7-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-10: Memo, Marcus H. Ray for ASW, 22 Jan\r\n                   46, ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-11: Memo, ACofS, G-1, for CofS, 25 Jan\r\n                   46, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the\r\n                   Postwar Army, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PAUL.]\r\n\r\nHere, even before the new racial policy was published, the Army staff\r\nran head on into the realities of postwar manpower needs. In a rapid\r\ndemobilization, the Army was critically short of troops, particularly\r\nfor overseas replacements, and it could maintain troop strength only\r\nby accepting all the men it could get. Until Paul had more definite\r\ninformation on the future operations of Selective Service and the rate\r\nof voluntary Regular Army enlistments, he would have to postpone\r\naction to curtail the admission of low-scoring men. So pressing were\r\nthe Army's needs that Paul could do nothing to guarantee that black\r\nstrength would not greatly exceed the 10 percent figure suggested by\r\nthe Gillem Board. He anticipated that by 1 July 1946 the regular and\r\nactive reserve components of the Army would together be approximately\r\n15 percent black, a percentage impossible to avoid if the Army was to\r\nretain 1.8 million men. Since all planning had been based on a 10\r\npercent black strength, plans would have to be revised to make use of\r\nthe excess. In February 1946 the Chief of Staff approved General\r\nPaul's program: Negroes would continue to be drafted at the 10 percent\r\nratio; at the same time their enlistment in the Regular Army would\r\ncontinue without restriction on numbers. Negroes would be limited to\r\n15 percent of the overseas commands, and the continental commands  (p. 179)\r\nwould absorb all the rest.[7-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-12: DF, ACofS, G-1, 23 Jan 46, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Personnel, WDGAP 291.2 (23 Jan\r\n                   46); Ltr, TAG to CG's, Major Forces, and Overseas\r\n                   Cmdrs, 4 Feb 46, same sub, AG 291.2 (31 Jan 46)\r\n                   OB-S-A-M.]\r\n\r\nPaul's program for absorbing Negroes faced rough going, for the\r\nalready complex manpower situation was further complicated by\r\nlimitations on the use of Negroes in certain overseas theaters and the\r\ndemands of the War Department's major commands. The Army was\r\nprohibited by an agreement with the State Department from sending\r\nNegroes to the Panama Canal Zone; it also respected an unwritten\r\nagreement that barred black servicemen from Iceland, the Azores, and\r\nChina.[7-13] Since the War Department was unable to use Negroes\r\neverywhere, the areas where they could be used had to take more. The\r\nincrease in black troops provoked considerable discussion in the large\r\nPacific and European commands because it entailed separate housing,\r\ntransportation, and care for dependents--all the usual expensive\r\ntrappings of segregation. Theater commanders also faced additional\r\nproblems in public relations and management. As one War Department\r\nstaff officer claimed, black units required more than normal\r\nadministration, stricter policing, and closer supervision. This in\r\nturn demanded additional noncommissioned officers, and \"more Negro\r\nbodies must be maintained to produce equivalent results.\"[7-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-13: G-1 Memo for Rcd, Col Coyne,\r\n                   Operations Gp, 19 Feb 47, WDGAP 291.2; prohibitions\r\n                   for certain areas are discussed in detail in\r\n                   Chapter 15.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-14: Memo, Actg Chief, Pac Theater Sec,\r\n                   OPD, for Maj Gen H.

Representatives\r\nfrom the European theater arrived in Washington in mid-February 1946\r\nto propose a black strength of 8.21 rather than the prescribed 15\r\npercent. Seeking to determine where black soldiers could be used \"with\r\nthe least harmful effect on theater operations,\" they discovered in\r\nconferences with representatives of the War Department staff only the\r\nplaces Negroes were not to be used: in infantry units, in the\r\nconstabulary, which acted as a border patrol and occupation police, in\r\nhighly technical services, or as supervisors of white civilian\r\nlaborers.[7-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-15: Memo, Chief, Eur Sec, OPD, for Maj\r\n                   Gen Howard A.

These two groups, which the\r\ncommand considered far less adaptable than white troops to\r\noccupational duties, would together make up about 40 percent of the\r\ncommand's total strength. Although Philippine Scouts in the theater\r\nnever exceeded 31,000, the command's protest achieved some success.\r\nThe War Department agreed to reduce black troops in the Pacific to 14\r\npercent by 1 January 1947 and 13 percent by 1 July 1947.[7-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-16: Memo for Rcd, Lt Col French, Theater\r\n                   Group, OPD, 7 May 46, sub: Negro Enlisted Strength,\r\n                   Pacific Theater, 1947, WDGOT 291.2.

Instead of planning to absorb more Negroes, the Army\r\nAir Forces wanted to divest itself of some black units on the premise\r\nthat unskilled troops were a liability in a highly technical service.\r\nGeneral Spaatz reported that some 60 percent of all his black troops\r\nstationed in the United States in January 1946 were performing the\r\nduties of unskilled laborers and that very few could be trained for\r\nskilled tasks. He predicted that the Army Air Forces would soon have\r\nan even higher percentage of low-scoring Negroes because 15 percent of\r\nall men enlisting in his Regular Army units--expected to reach a total\r\nof 45,000 men by 1 July 1946--were black. To forestall this increase\r\nin \"undesirable and uneconomical\" troops, he wanted to stop inducting\r\nNegroes into the Army Air Forces and suspend all black enlistments in\r\nthe Regular Army.[7-17]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-17: Memo, CG, AAF, for ACofS, G-1, 25 Jan\r\n                   46, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the\r\n                   Postwar Army, WDGAP 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Army Air Forces elaborated on these arguments in the following\r\nmonths, refining both its estimates and demands. Specifically, its\r\nmanpower officials estimated that to reach the 15 percent black\r\nstrength ordered by 1 July 1946 the Air Forces would have to take\r\n50,500 Negroes into units that could efficiently use only 22,000 men.\r\nThis embarrassment of more than 28,000 unusable men, the Army Air\r\nForces claimed, would require eliminating tactical units and creating\r\nadditional quartermaster car companies, mess platoons, and other\r\nservice organizations.[7-18] The Air staff wanted to eliminate the\r\nunwanted 28,000 black airmen by raising to eighty the minimum\r\nclassification test score for Regular Army enlistment in the Army Air\r\nForces. In the end it retreated from this proposal, and on 25 February\r\nrequested permission to use the 28,000 Negroes in service units, but\r\nover and above its 400,000-man troop basis. It promised to absorb all\r\nthese men into the troop basis by 30 June 1946.[7-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-18: Memo, Brig Gen William Metheny, Off,\r\n                   Commitments Div, ACofS Air Staff-3, for ACofS Air\r\n                   Staff-3, 18 Feb 46, WDGOT 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-19: DF, DCofAS (Maj Gen C.

It had in mind a group of 8,795 Negroes recently enlisted\r\nfor a three-year period, who, in accordance with a lure designed to\r\nstimulate such enlistments, had chosen assignment in the Air Forces\r\nand a station in Europe. With a surplus of black troops, the Air\r\nForces found itself increasingly unable to fulfill the \"overseas\r\ntheater of choice\" enlistment contract. Since some men would\r\nundoubtedly refuse to serve anywhere but Europe, the Air staff     (p. 181)\r\nreasoned, why not offer a discharge to all men who preferred\r\nseparation over service elsewhere?\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-20: Memo, Actg ACofS, G-3, for CG, AAF,\r\n                   14 Mar 46, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in\r\n                   the Postwar Army, WDGOT 291.2.]\r\n\r\nAgain the Army staff turned down a request for a reduction in black\r\ntroops. This time the Air Forces bowed to the inevitable--15 percent\r\nof its enlisted strength black--but grudgingly, for a quota of 50,419\r\nNegroes, General Spaatz charged, \"seriously jeopardizes the ability of\r\nthe AAF to perform its assigned mission.\"[7-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-21: Memo, ACofS, G-3, for CG, AAF, 21 Mar\r\n                   46, sub: Authorized Military Personnel as of 31\r\n                   December 1946 and 30 June 1947, WDGOT 320.2 (21 Mar\r\n                   46); DF, CG, AAF, to ACofS, G-3, 26 Mar 46, same\r\n                   sub, WDGOT 291.21 (12 Feb 46).]\r\n\r\nThe Army Service Forces also objected. When queried,[7-22] the chiefs of\r\nits technical and administrative services all agreed they could use\r\nonly small percentages of black troops, and only those men in the\r\nhigher categories of the classification test. From the replies of the\r\nchiefs it was plain that none of the technical services planned to use\r\nNegroes in as much as 10 percent of spaces, and several wanted to\r\nexclude black units altogether. Furthermore, the test qualifications\r\nthey wanted set for many jobs were consistently higher than those\r\nachieved by the men then performing the tasks. The staff of the Army\r\nService Forces went so far as to advocate that no more than 3.29\r\npercent of the overhead and miscellaneous positions in the Army\r\nService Forces be entrusted to black troops.[7-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-22: Memo, Actg Dir, Plans and Policy,\r\n                   ASF, for PMG et al., 23 May 46, sub: Utilization of\r\n                   Negro Manpower in the Postwar Army, AG 291.2 (23\r\n                   May 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-23: The replies of the individual\r\n                   technical and administrative service chiefs, along\r\n                   with the response of the ASF Personnel Director,\r\n                   are inclosed in Memo, Chief, Plans and Policy Off,\r\n                   Dir of SS&P, for Dir, O&T, 21 Jun 46, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Postwar Army,\r\n                   WDGSP 291.2 (Negro).]\r\n\r\nThese answers failed to impress the War Department's Director of\r\nPersonnel and Administration and the Director of Organization and\r\nTraining.[7-24] Both agreed that the technical and administrative\r\nservices had failed to appreciate the problems and responsibilities\r\noutlined in War Department Circular 124; the assumption that black\r\ntroops would not be used in certain types of duty in the future\r\nbecause they had not been so used in the past was unwarranted, General\r\nPaul added. Limited or token employment of Negroes, he declared, was\r\nno longer acceptable.[7-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-24: Under WD Circular 134, 14 May 46, the\r\n                   War Department General Staff was reorganized, and\r\n                   many of its offices, including G-1 and G-3, were\r\n                   redesignated as of 11 June 1946.

According to plans\r\nfor 1 April 1946, Negroes in the continental United States would\r\ncomprise 15.2 percent of the Army Service Forces, 15.4 percent of the\r\nArmy Ground Forces, and 17 percent of the Army Air Forces. Actually,\r\nNegroes in continental commands on 30 April 1946 made up 14.86 percent\r\nof the Army Service Forces, 5.62 percent of the Army Ground Forces,\r\nand 11.86 percent of the Army Air Forces. The 116,752 black soldiers\r\namounted to 12.35 percent of all troops based in the United States;\r\noverseas, the 67,372 Negroes constituted 7.73 percent of American  (p. 182)\r\nforce. Altogether, the 184,124 Negroes in the Army amounted to 10.14\r\npercent of the whole.[7-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-26: Strength of the Army (STM-30), 1 May\r\n                   46; see also Memo, ACofS, G-1, for Chief, MPD, ASF,\r\n                   3 Jun 46, sub: Utilization of Negro Personnel,\r\n                   WDGPA 291.2. (12 Jul 46).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Quota in Practice_\r\n\r\nWhile the solution to the problem of too many black enlistees and too\r\nmany low-scoring men was obvious, it was also replete with difficulty.\r\nThe difficulty came from the complex way the Army obtained its\r\nmanpower. It accepted volunteers for enlistment in the Regular Army\r\nand qualified veterans for the Organized Reserves; until November 1946\r\nit also drafted men through the Selective Service and accepted\r\nvolunteers for the draft.[7-27] At the same time, under certain\r\nconditions it accepted enlistment in the Regular Army of drafted men\r\nwho had completed their tours. To curtail enlistment of Negroes and\r\ndischarge low-scoring professionals, the Army would be obliged to\r\nmanipulate the complex regulations governing the various forms of\r\nenlistment and sidestep the egalitarian provisions of the Selective\r\nService System at a time when the service was trying to attract\r\nrecruits and avoid charges of racial discrimination. Altogether it was\r\nquite a large order, and during the next two years the Army fought the\r\nbattle of numbers on many fronts.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-27: Volunteers for the draft were men\r\n                   classified 1-A by Selective Service who were\r\n                   allowed to sign up for immediate duty often in the\r\n                   service of their choice. The volunteer for the\r\n                   draft was only obliged to serve for the shorter\r\n                   period imposed on the draftee rather than the\r\n                   36-month enlistment for the Regular Army.]\r\n\r\nIt first took on the draft. Although to stop inducting Negroes when\r\nthe administration was trying to persuade Congress to extend the draft\r\nact was politically unwise, the Army saw no way to restrict the number\r\nof Negroes or eliminate substandard men so long as Selective Service\r\ninsisted on 10 percent black calls and a minimum classification test\r\nscore of seventy. In April 1946 the Army issued a call for 126,000\r\nmen, boldly specifying that no Negroes would be accepted. Out of the\r\nbattle of memos with Selective Service that followed, a compromise\r\nemerged: a black call of 4 percent of the total in April, a return to\r\nthe usual 10 percent call for Negroes in May, and another 4 percent\r\ncall in June.[7-28] No draft calls were issued in July and August, but\r\nin September the Army staff tried again, canceling the call for\r\nNegroes and rejecting black volunteers for induction.[7-29] Again it\r\nencountered resistance from the Selective Service and the black\r\ncommunity, and when the Secretary of War was sued for violation of the\r\nSelective Service Act the Army issued a 3 percent call for Negroes in\r\nOctober, the last call made under the 1940 draft law. In all, 16,888\r\nNegroes were drafted into the Army in 1946, some 10.5 percent of the\r\ntotal.[7-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-28: Report of the Director, Office of\r\n                   Selective Service Review, 31 March 1947, Table 56,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-29: Memo, Chief, Manpower Control Gp,\r\n                   D/PA, for TAG, 6 Sep 46, Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Manpower in Postwar Army, WDGPA 291.2; D/PA Memo\r\n                   for Rcd, 1 Sep 46.

In April  (p. 183)\r\n1946, at the same time it adopted the Gillem Board recommendations,\r\nthe Army began to deny enlistment or reenlistment in the Regular Army\r\nto anyone scoring below seventy on the Army General Classification\r\nTest. The only exceptions were men who had been decorated for valor\r\nand men with previous service who had scored sixty-five and were\r\nrecommended for reenlistment by their commanders.[7-31] The Army also\r\nstopped enlisting men with active venereal disease, not because the\r\nMedical Department was unable to cure them but because by and large\r\ntheir educational levels were low and, according to the classification\r\ntests, they had little aptitude for learning. The Army stopped\r\nrecruiting men for special stations, hoping a denial of the European\r\ntheater and other attractive assignments would lower the number of\r\nunwanted recruits.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-31: WD Cir 110, 17 Apr 46.]\r\n\r\nUsing the new enlistment standards as a base, the Army quickly revised\r\nits estimated black strength downward. On 16 April 1946 the Secretary\r\nof War rescinded the order requiring major commands to retain a black\r\nstrength of 15 percent.[7-32] The acting G-3 had already informed the\r\ncommanding general of the Army Air Forces of the predicted drop in the\r\nnumber of black troops--from 13.3 percent in June 1946 to 10 percent a\r\nyear later--and agreed the Army Air Forces could reduce its planned\r\nintake accordingly.[7-33] Estimating the European theater's capacity to\r\nabsorb black troops at 21,845 men, approximately 10 percent of the\r\ncommand total, the Army staff agreed to readjust its planned allotment\r\nof Negroes to that command downward by some 1,500 spaces.[7-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-32: Ltr, TAG to CG, AAF, et al., 16 Apr\r\n                   46, sub: Utilization of Negro Personnel, AGAO-S-A-M\r\n                   291.2 (12 Apr 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-33: Memo, Actg ACofS, G-3, for CG, AAF,\r\n                   12 Apr 46, sub: Utilization of Negro Personnel,\r\n                   WDGOT 291.21 (12 Feb 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-34: Memo, ACofS, OPD, for CofS, 13 May\r\n                   46, sub: Augmentation of the ETO Ceiling Strengths\r\n                   as of 1 Jul 46 (less AAF), WDCSA 320.2 (1946).]\r\n\r\nThese changes proved ill-advised, for the effort to curb the number of\r\nNegroes in the Regular Army was largely unsuccessful. The staff had\r\noverlooked the ineffectiveness of the Army's testing measures and the\r\nzeal of its recruiters who, pressed to fill their quotas, accepted\r\nenlistees without concern for the new standards. By mid-June the\r\neffect was readily apparent. The European theater, for example,\r\nreported some 19,000 Negroes in excess of billets in black units and\r\nsome 2,000 men above the theater's current allotment of black troops.\r\nAssignment of Negroes to Europe had been stopped, but the number of\r\nblack regulars waiting for overseas assignment stood at 5,000, a\r\nfigure expected to double by the end of the summer. Some of this\r\nexcess could be absorbed in eight newly created black units, but that\r\nstill left black units worldwide 18 to 40 percent overstrength.[7-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-35: G-1 Memo for Rcd (signed Col E.

Basing his decision on the consensus of\r\nthat meeting, the Secretary of War on 17 July suspended enlistment of\r\nNegroes in the Regular Army. He excepted two categories of men from\r\nthis ruling. Men who qualified and had actually served for six months\r\nin any of forty-eight unusual military occupational specialties in\r\nwhich there were chronic manpower shortages would be enlisted without\r\npromise of specific assignment to branch or station. At the same time,\r\nbecause of manpower shortages, the Army would continue to accept\r\nNegroes, already regulars, who wanted to reenlist.[7-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-36: Ltr, TAG to CG, Each Army, et al., 17\r\n                   Jul 46, sub: Enlistment of Negroes, AGSE-P342.06 (9\r\n                   Jul 46); D/PA Summary Sheet to CofS, 9 Jul 46, sub:\r\n                   Enlistment of Negroes in Regular Army, WDGPA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARCUS RAY.]\r\n\r\nWhile the new enlistment policy would help restore the Gillem Board's\r\nquantitative equilibrium to the Army, the secretary's exception\r\nallowing reenlistment of regulars would only intensify the qualitative\r\nimbalance between black and white soldiers. The nation's biracial\r\neducational system had produced an average black soldier who scored\r\nwell below the average white soldier on all the Army's educational and\r\ntraining tests. The segregation policy had only complicated the\r\nproblem by denying the talented Negro the full range of Army\r\noccupations and hence an equal chance for advancement. With the\r\nsuspension of first-time enlistments, the qualitative imbalance was\r\nsure to grow, for now the highly qualified civilian would be passed\r\nover while the less qualified soldier was permitted to reenlist.\r\n\r\nThis imbalance was of particular concern to Marcus Ray who was present\r\nwhen the suspension of black enlistments had been decided upon. Ray\r\nhad suggested that instead of barring all new enlistees the Army\r\nshould discharge all Class V soldiers, whites and blacks alike, for\r\nthe convenience of the government and recruit in their place an equal\r\nnumber of Class I and II candidates. Manpower officials had objected,\r\narguing there was no point in enlisting more Negroes in Class I and II\r\nuntil the 10 percent ratio was again reached. Such a reduction, with\r\ncurrent attrition, would take two years. At the same time, the Army\r\nmanpower shortages made it impractical to discharge 92,000 soldiers,\r\nhalf of whom were white, in Class V. The organization and training\r\nrepresentatives, on the other hand, agreed with Ray that it was    (p. 185)\r\nin the best interest of the Army to discharge these men, pointing\r\nout that a recent increase in pay for enlisted men together with the\r\ncontinuing need for recruits with greater aptitude for learning would\r\nmake the policy palatable to the Congress and the public.[7-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-37: D/OT Memo for Red, 15 Jul 46; DF,\r\n                   D/OT to D/PA, 15 Jul 46, sub: Basic Training of\r\n                   Negro Personnel; both in WDGOT 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe conferees deferred decision on the matter, but during the\r\nfollowing months the War Department set out to achieve a qualitative\r\nbalance between its black and white recruits. On 10 August 1946 the\r\nChief of Staff directed commanders, under the authority of Army\r\nRegulation 615-369 which defined ineptness for military service, to\r\neliminate after six months men \"incapable of serving in the Army in a\r\ndesirable manner after reasonable attempts have been made to utilize\r\ntheir capabilities.\" He went on to explain that this category included\r\nthose not mentally qualified, generally defined as men scoring below\r\nseventy, and those repeatedly guilty of minor offenses.[7-38] The Army\r\nreissued the order in 1947, further defining the criteria for\r\ndischarge to include those who needed continued and special\r\ninstruction or supervision or who exhibited habitual drunkenness,\r\nineptness, or inability to conform to group living. A further\r\nmodification in 1949 would deny reenlistment to married men who had\r\nfailed during their first enlistment to make corporal or single men\r\nwho did not make private first class.[7-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-38: WD Cir 241, 10 Aug 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-39: WD Cir 93, 9 Apr 47; D/PA Summary\r\n                   Sheet, 1 Sep 49, sub: Method of Reducing Negro\r\n                   Reenlistment Rate, WDGPA 291.2 (6 Apr 49).]\r\n\r\nThe measures were aimed at eliminating the least qualified men of both\r\nraces, and in October 1946 General Paul decided the Army could now\r\nbegin taking black recruits with the qualifications and background\r\nthat allowed them \"to become useful members of the Army.\"[7-40] To that\r\nend The Adjutant General announced on 2 October that as a further\r\nexception to the prohibition against black enlistments in the Regular\r\nArmy all former officers and noncommissioned officers who volunteered\r\nwould be accepted without limitation.[7-41] On 31 October he announced\r\nthe establishment of a selective procurement program. With the\r\nexception of men who had been in certain specialized occupations for\r\nsix months, all Negroes enlisting in the Regular Army had to score one\r\nhundred on the Army General Classification Test; the minimum score for\r\nwhite enlistees remained seventy.[7-42] At the same time, The Adjutant\r\nGeneral rescinded for Negroes the choice-of-assignment provision of\r\nRegular Army enlistment contracts.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-40: P&A Memo for Red, 30 Sep 46, attached\r\n                   to copy of Ltr, TAG to CG, Each Army, et al., 2 Oct\r\n                   46, sub: Enlistment of Negroes, AGSE-P342.06, WDGAP\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-41: Ltr, TAG to CG, Each Army, et al., 2\r\n                   Oct 46, sub: Enlistment of Negroes, AGSE-P342.06\r\n                   (30 Sep 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-42: Ibid., 31 Oct 46, sub: Enlistment of\r\n                   Negroes, AGSE-P342.06 (23 Oct 46); see also WD Cir\r\n                   103, 1947.

The percentage of Negroes dropped by 30 June 1947\r\nto 7.91 percent of the Army, 8.99 percent of its enlisted strength (p. 186)\r\nand 9.4 percent of its Regular Army strength. Black enlisted strength\r\nof all the overseas commands stood at 8.75 percent, down from the\r\n10.77 percent of the previous December. Percentages in the individual\r\ntheaters reflected this trend; the European theater, for example,\r\ndropped from 10.33 percent black to 9.96, the Mediterranean theater\r\nfrom 10.05 to 8.03, and Alaska from 26.6 to 14.54.[7-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-43: All figures are from STM-30, Strength\r\n                   of the Army.

General Paul could argue with considerable\r\njustification that in regulating the quality of its recruits the Army\r\nwas following the spirit if not the letter of the Gillem Board Report.\r\nIf the Army could set high enough standards it would get good men, and\r\nto this end the General Staff's Personnel and Administration Division\r\nasked for the support of commanders.[7-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-44: Memo, Brig Gen J.

During\r\nthe summer of 1946, for example, many black soldiers and airmen\r\ncomplained about the Army's rejection of black enlistments for the\r\nEuropean theater. The NAACP, which received some of the soldiers'\r\ncomplaints, suggested that the War Department honor its pledges or\r\nimmediately release all Negroes who were refused their choice of\r\nlocation.[7-46] The Army did just that, offering to discharge honorably\r\nthose soldiers who, denied their theater of choice, rejected any\r\nsubstitute offered.[7-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-46: Ltr, Walter White to SW, 18 Jun 46;\r\n                   Telg, White to SW, 24 Jun 46; both in SW 291.2\r\n                   (Negro Troops).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-47: DF, OTIG to D/PA, 23 Jul 46, sub:\r\n                   Assignment of Negro Enlistees Who Have Selected ETO\r\n                   as Choice of Initial Assignment, WDSIG 220.3--Negro\r\n                   Enlistees.]\r\n\r\nLater in 1946 a young Negro sued the Secretary of War and a Pittsburgh\r\nrecruiting officer for refusing to enlist him. To make standards for\r\nblack applicants substantially higher than those for whites, he\r\nalleged, violated the Preamble and Fifth Amendment of the\r\nConstitution, while the inducements offered for enlistment, for\r\nexample the GI Bill of Rights, constituted a valuable property right\r\ndenied him because of race. The suit asked that all further\r\nenlistments in the Army be stopped until Negroes were accepted on\r\nequal terms with whites and all special enlistment requirements for\r\nNegroes were abolished.[7-48] Commenting on the case, the chief of the\r\nWar Department's Public Relations Division, Maj. Gen. Floyd L. Parks,\r\ndefended the Gillem Board's 10 percent quota, but agreed that      (p. 187)\r\n\"we are on weak ground [in] having a different standard for admission\r\nbetween white and colored....

One\r\norganization called on the Secretary of War to abandon the Gillem\r\nBoard policy \"and unequivocably and equitably integrate Negroes ...\r\nwithout any discrimination, segregation or quotas in any form, concept\r\nor manner.\"[7-50] Senator Robert M. LaFollette, Jr., of Wisconsin called\r\nthe decision to suspend black enlistments race discrimination.[7-51]\r\nWalter P. Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers and the\r\ncodirector of his union's Fair Practices Department, branded the\r\nestablishment of a quota \"undemocratic and in violation of principles\r\nfor which they [Negroes] fought in the war\" and demanded that black\r\nenlistment be reinstated and the quota abolished.[7-52] Invoking\r\nAmerican tradition and the United Nations Charter, John Haynes Holmes,\r\nchairman of the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion, called for the abolition of enlistment quotas. The national\r\ncommander of the United Negro and Allied Veterans of America announced\r\nthat his organization unreservedly condemned the quota because it\r\ndeliberately deprived citizens of their constitutional right to serve\r\ntheir country.[7-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-50: Ltr, American Veterans Committee,\r\n                   Manhattan Chapter, to SW, 17 Jul 46, SW 291.2\r\n                   (NT).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-51: Ltr, LaFollette to SW, 25 Jul 46, SW\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-52: Ltr, Reuther and William Oliver to\r\n                   SW, 23 Jul 46, SW 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-53: Ltr, J.

The Army's enlistment practices, he wrote, were based on a\r\nbelief that black strength in the Army ought to bear a direct\r\nrelationship to the percentage of Negroes in the population. As for the\r\nbasic premise of what seemed to him a perfectly logical course of action,\r\nPatterson concluded that \"acceptance of the Negro-white ratio existing\r\nin the civilian population as a basis for the Army's distribution of\r\nunits and personnel is not considered discriminatory.\"[7-54] The\r\nsecretary's responses were interesting, for they demonstrated a\r\nsignificant change in the Army's attitude toward the quota. There is\r\nevidence that the quota was devised by the Gillem Board as a temporary\r\nexpedient to guarantee the substantial participation of Negroes. It\r\nwas certainly so viewed by civil rights advocates. As late as December\r\n1946 Assistant Secretary Petersen was still echoing this view when he\r\nexplained that the quota was a temporary ceiling and the Army had no\r\nright to use it as a permanent bar to black enlistment.[7-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-54: See Ltrs, SW to Wesley P.

Assistant Secretary       (p. 188)\r\nMcCloy belonged to neither group. More than a year before in reviewing\r\nthe Gillem Board's work he had declared: \"I do not see any place for a\r\nquota in a policy that looks to utilization of Negroes on the basis of\r\nability.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a year of dealing with black overstrengths and juggling\r\nenlistment standards, General Paul and his staff thought otherwise.\r\nThey believed that a ceiling must be imposed on the Army's black\r\nstrength if a rapid and uncontrolled increase in the number of black\r\ntroops was to be avoided. And it had to be avoided, they believed,\r\nlest it create a disproportionately large pool of black career\r\nsoldiers with low aptitudes that would weaken the Army. Using the\r\nquota to limit the number of black troops, they maintained, was not\r\nnecessarily discriminatory. It could be defended as a logical reading\r\nof the Gillem Board's declaration that \"the proportion of Negro to\r\nwhite manpower as exists in the civil population\" should be accepted\r\nin the peacetime Army to insure an orderly and uniform mobilization in\r\na national emergency. With the Gillem policy to support it, the Army\r\nstaff could impose a strict quota on the number of black soldiers and\r\njustify different enlistment standards for blacks and whites, a course\r\nthat was in fact the only alternative to the curtailment of white\r\nenlistment under the manpower restrictions being imposed upon the\r\npostwar Army.[7-56]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-56: DF, D/P&A to D/O&T, 28 Apr 47, sub:\r\n                   Negro Enlisted Strength, WDGPA 291.2 (12 Jul 46);\r\n                   idem for SA, 6 Aug 48, sub: Removing Restrictions\r\n                   on Negro Enlistments, CSGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\nPaul's reasoning was eventually endorsed by the new Chief of Staff,\r\nGeneral Omar N. Bradley, Secretary Patterson, and his successor,\r\nSecretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall.[7-57] Beginning in mid-1947 the\r\nenlistment of Negroes was carefully geared to their percentage of the\r\ntotal strength of the Army, not to a fixed quota or percentage of\r\nthose enlisting. This limitation on black enlistment was made more\r\npermanent in 1949 when it was included in the Army's mobilization\r\nplan, the basic manpower planning document.[7-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-57: Memo, ONB (Gen Bradley) for Gen Paul,\r\n                   9 Aug 48, CSUSA 291.2 Negroes (6 Aug 48).

When the number of\r\nNegroes dropped below 10 percent of the Army's total strength in June\r\n1947, The Adjutant General set a quota for the enlistment of black\r\nsoldiers.[7-59] When this quota was met in late August, the enlistment\r\nof Negroes with no special training was reduced to 500 men per\r\nmonth.[7-60] As part of a Personnel and Administration Division program\r\nto increase the number and kinds of black units, the quota was\r\ntemporarily increased to 3,000 men per month for four months beginning\r\nin December 1947.[7-61] Finding itself once again exceeding the 10 (p. 189)\r\npercent black strength figure, the Army suspended the enlistment of\r\nall Negroes for nine months beginning in April 1949.[7-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-59: Ltr, TAG to CG, Each Army, et al., 9\r\n                   Jul 47, sub: Enlistment of Negroes AGSE-P291.2.

General Paul had offered one\r\nsolution to the problem in July 1946. He recommended that each major\r\ncommand and service be allocated its proportionate share of black\r\ntroops; that such troops \"have the over-all average frequency of AGCT\r\ngrades occurring among Negro military personnel\"; and that major\r\ncommands and services submit plans for establishing enough units and\r\noverhead positions to accommodate their total allocations.[7-63] But\r\nPaul did not anticipate the low-scoring soldier's penchant for\r\nreenlistment or the ability of some commanders, often on the basis of\r\nthis fact, to justify the rejection of further black allotments. Thus,\r\nin pursuit of a racial policy designed to promote the efficient use of\r\nmanpower, the G-1 and G-3 sections of the General Staff wrestled for\r\nalmost five years with the problem of racial balances in the various\r\ncommands, continental armies, and training programs.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-63: DF, D/PA to D/OT, 30 Jul 46, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Postwar Army,\r\n                   WDGPA 291.2 (15 Jul 46).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broader Opportunities_\r\n\r\nThe equitable distribution of Negroes throughout each major command\r\nand service was complicated by certain provisions of Circular 124.\r\nAlong with the quota, the policy prescribed grouping black units, not\r\nto exceed regimental size, with white units in composite organizations\r\nand integrating black specialists in overhead organizations. The\r\ncomposite organizations were primarily the concern of the G-3 (later\r\nthe Organization and Training Division) section of the General Staff,\r\nand in June 1946 its director, Lt. Gen. Charles P. Hall, brought the\r\nmatter to the attention of major commanders. Although the War\r\nDepartment did not want to establish an arbitrary number of black\r\ncombat units, Hall explained, the new policy stressed the development\r\nof such units to provide a broader base for future expansion, and he\r\nwanted more black combat units organized as rapidly as trained troops\r\nbecame available. To that end he called for a survey of all black\r\nunits to find out their current organization and assignment.[7-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-64: Cir as Memo, TAG for CG, AAF et al.,\r\n                   10 Jun 46, sub: Organization of Negro Manpower in\r\n                   Postwar Army, AG 291.2 (4 Jun 46).]\r\n\r\nArmy Ground Forces reported that it had formed some composite units,\r\nbut its largest black unit, the 25th Regimental Combat Team, had been\r\nattached to the V Corps at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, instead of\r\nbeing made an organic element in a division. Practically all service\r\ngroup headquarters reported separate black and white battalions    (p. 190)\r\nunder their control, but many of the organizations in the Army Service\r\nForces--those under the Provost Marshal General and the Surgeon\r\nGeneral, for example--still had no black units, let alone composite\r\norganizations.

The Mediterranean theater was using some\r\nNegroes with special skills in appropriate overhead organizations, but\r\nin the vast European Command Negroes were assigned to separate\r\nregiments and smaller units. There were two exceptions: one\r\nprovisional black regiment was attached to the 1st Infantry Division,\r\nand a black field artillery battalion was attached to each of the\r\nthree occupation divisions. The Alaskan Department and the Okinawa\r\nBase Command had black units, both separate and grouped with white\r\nunits, but the Yokohama Base Command continued to use specially\r\nskilled Negroes in black units because of the great demand for\r\nqualified persons in those units.[7-65]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-65: Memo, D/O&T for ASW, 18 Jul 46, sub:\r\n                   Organization of Negro Manpower in Postwar Army,\r\n                   WDGOT 291.2.]\r\n\r\nTo claim, as Hall did to Assistant Secretary Petersen, that black\r\nunits were being used like white units was misleading. Despite the\r\nexamples cited in the survey, many black units still remained\r\nindependent organizations, and with one major exception black combat\r\nunits grouped with white units were attached rather than assigned as\r\norganizational elements of a parent unit. This was an important\r\ndistinction.[7-66] The constant imposition of attached status on a unit\r\nthat under normal circumstances would be assigned as an organic\r\nelement of a division introduced a sense of impermanence and\r\nalienation just as it relieved the division commander of considerable\r\nadministrative control and hence proprietary interest in the unit.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-66: An attached unit, such as a tank\r\n                   destroyer battalion, is one temporarily included in\r\n                   a larger organization; an assigned unit is one\r\n                   permanently given to a larger organization as part\r\n                   of its organic establishment. On the distinction\r\n                   between attached and assigned status, see Ltr, CSA\r\n                   to CG, CONARC, 21 Jul 55, CSUSA 322.17 (Div), and\r\n                   CMH, \"Lineages and Honors: History, Principles, and\r\n                   Preparation,\" June 1962, in CMH.]\r\n\r\nAttached status, so common for black units, thus weakened morale and\r\nhampered training as Petersen well understood. Noting the favorable\r\nattitude of the division commander, he had asked in April 1946 if it\r\nwas possible to assign the black 555th Parachute Battalion to the\r\ncelebrated 82d Airborne Division.[7-67] The answer was no. The\r\ncommanding general of the Army Ground Forces, General Devers,\r\njustified attachment rather than assignment of the black battalion to\r\nthe 82d on the grounds that the Army's race policy called for the\r\nprogressive adoption of the composite unit and attachment was a part\r\nof this process. Assignment of such units was, on the other hand, part\r\nof a long-range plan to put the new policy into effect and should\r\nstill be subject to considerable study. Further justifying the _status\r\nquo_, he pointed to the division's low strength, which he said\r\nresulted from a lack of volunteers. Offering his own variation     (p. 191)\r\nof the \"Catch-22\" theme, he suggested that before any black battalion\r\nwas assigned to a large combat unit, the effect of such an assignment\r\non the larger unit's combat efficiency would first have to be studied.\r\nFinally, he questioned the desirability of having a black unit assume\r\nthe history of a white unit; evidently he did not realize that the\r\nintention was to assign a black unit with its black history to the\r\ndivision.[7-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-67: Memo, Actg, ACofS, G-3, for CG, AGF,\r\n                   3 Jun 46, sub: Formation of Composite White-Negro\r\n                   Units, with attachment, WDGOT 291.21 (30 Apr 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-68: Memo, CG, AFG, for CofS, 21 June 46,\r\n                   sub: Formation of Composite White-Negro Units,\r\n                   GNGCT-41 291.2 (Negro) (3 Jun 46).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL EICHELBERGER, EIGHTH ARMY COMMANDER, _inspects\r\n24th Infantry troops, Camp Majestic, Japan, June 1947_.]\r\n\r\nIn the face of such arguments Hall accepted what he called the\r\n\"nonfeasibility\" of replacing one of the 82d's organic battalions with\r\nthe 555th, but he asked whether an additional parachute battalion\r\ncould be authorized for the division so that the 555th could be\r\nassigned without eliminating a white battalion. He reiterated the\r\narguments for such an assignment, adding that it would invigorate the\r\n555th's training, attract more and better black recruits, and better\r\nimplement the provisions of Circular 124.[7-69] General Devers remained\r\nunconvinced. He doubted that assigning the black battalion to the  (p. 192)\r\ndivision would improve the battalion's training, and he was\r\n\"unalterably opposed\" to adding an extra battalion. He found the idea\r\nunsound from both a tactical and organizational point of view. It was,\r\nhe said, undesirable to reorganize a division solely to assign a black\r\nunit.[7-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-69: DF, D/O&T to CG, AGF, 24 Jul 46, sub:\r\n                   Formation of Composite White-Negro Units, WDGOT\r\n                   291.21 (30 Apr 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-70: Memo, CG, AGF, for D/O&T, 1 Aug 46,\r\n                   sub: Formation of Composite White-Negro Units, CMT\r\n                   2 to DF, D/O&T to CG, AGF, 24 Jul 46, same sub,\r\n                   WDGOT 291.21 (30 Apr 46).]\r\n\r\nGeneral Hall gave up the argument, and the 555th remained attached to\r\nthe 82d. Attached status would remain the general pattern for black\r\ncombat units for several years.[7-71] The assignment of the 24th\r\nInfantry to the 25th Infantry Division in Japan was the major\r\nexception to this rule, but the 24th was the only black regiment left\r\nintact, and it was administratively difficult to leave such a large\r\norganization in attached status for long. The other black regiment on\r\nactive duty, the 25th Infantry, was split; its battalions, still\r\ncarrying their unit designations, were attached to various divisions\r\nto replace inactive or unfilled organic elements. The 9th and 10th\r\nCavalry, the other major black units, were inactivated along with the\r\n2d Cavalry Division in 1944, but reactivated in 1950 as separate tank\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-71: Memo, D/O&T for SW, 19 Sep 46, sub:\r\n                   Request for Memorandum, WDGOT 291.21 (12 Sep 46).]\r\n\r\nThat this distinction between attached and assigned status was\r\nconsidered important became clear in the fall of 1947. At that time\r\nthe personnel organization suggested that the word \"separate\" be\r\ndeleted from a sentence of Circular 124: \"Employment will be in Negro\r\nregiments or groups, separate battalions or squadrons, and separate\r\ncompanies, troops, or batteries.\" General Paul reasoned that the word\r\nwas redundant since a black unit was by definition a separate unit.\r\nGeneral Devers was strongly opposed to deletion on grounds that it\r\nwould lead to the indiscriminate organization of small black units\r\nwithin larger units. He argued that the Gillem Board had provided for\r\nblack units as part of larger units, but not as organic parts. He\r\nbelieved that a separate black unit should continue to be attached\r\nwhen it replaced a white unit; otherwise it would lose its identity by\r\nbecoming an organic part of a mixed unit. Larger considerations seem\r\nalso to have influenced his conclusion: \"Our implementation of the\r\nNegro problem has not progressed to the degree where we can accept\r\nthis step. We have already progressed beyond that which is acceptable\r\nin many states and we still have a considerable latitude in the\r\npresent policy without further liberalizing it from the Negro\r\nviewpoint.\"[7-72] The Chief of Staff supported Paul's view, however, and\r\nthe word \"separate\" was excised.[7-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-72: DF, CG, AGF, to D/P&A, 15 Sep 47,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Postwar\r\n                   Army.

Only then, and increasingly during\r\n1950, did the Army begin to assign a number of black units as organic\r\nparts of combat divisions. More noteworthy, Negroes began to be\r\nassigned to fill the spaces in parts of white units. Thus the 3d   (p. 193)\r\nBattalion of the 9th Infantry and the 3d Battalion of the 188th\r\nbecame black units in 1950.\r\n\r\nDespite the emergence of racially composite units, the Army's\r\nexecution of the Gillem Board recommendation on the integration of\r\nblack and white units was criticized by black leaders. The board had\r\nplaced no limitation on the size of the units to be integrated, and\r\nits call for progressive steps to utilize black manpower implied to\r\nmany that the process of forming composite black and white units would\r\ncontinue till it included the smaller service units, which still\r\ncontained the majority of black troops. It was one thing, the Army\r\nstaff concluded, to assign a self-sustaining black battalion to a\r\ndivision, but quite another to assign a small black service unit in a\r\nsimilar fashion. As a spokesman for the Personnel and Administration\r\nDivision put it in a 1946 address, the Army was \"not now ready to mix\r\nNegro and white personnel in the same company or battery, for messing\r\nand housing.\" Ignoring the Navy's experience to the contrary, he\r\nconcluded that to do so might provoke serious opposition from the men\r\nin the ranks and from the American public.[7-74]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-74: Col. H. E. Kessinger, Exec Off,\r\n                   ACofS, G-1, \"Utilization of Negro Manpower, 1946,\"\r\n                   copy in WDGPA 291.2 (1946).]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, G-1 and G-3 agreed to reject the Mediterranean theater's\r\n1946 plan to organize composite service units in the 88th Infantry\r\nDivision because such organization \"involves the integration of Negro\r\nplatoons or Negro sections into white companies, a combination which\r\nis not in accordance with the policy as expressed in Circular\r\n124.\"[7-75] In the separate case of black service companies--for\r\nexample, the many transportation truck companies and ordnance\r\nevacuation companies--theater commanders tended to combine them first\r\ninto quartermaster trains and then attach them to their combat\r\ndivisions.[7-76]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-75: DF, ACofS, G-1, to CofS, 3 Jun 46,\r\n                   sub: Implementation of the Gillem Board, WDGAP\r\n                   291.2 (24 Nov 45); see also Routing Form, ACofS,\r\n                   G-1, same date, subject, and file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-76: For the formation of quartermaster\r\n                   trains in Europe, see Geis Monograph, pp. 89-90.]\r\n\r\nDespite the relaxation in the distinction between attached and\r\nassigned status in the case of large black units, the Army staff\r\nremained adamantly opposed to the combination of small black with\r\nsmall white units. The Personnel and Administration Division jealously\r\nguarded the orthodoxy of this interpretation. Commenting on one\r\nproposal to combine small units in April 1948, General Paul noted that\r\nwhile grouping units of company size or greater was permissible, the\r\nArmy had not yet reached the stage where two white companies and two\r\nblack companies could be organized into a single battalion. Until the\r\nprocess of forming racially composite units developed to this extent,\r\nhe told the Under Secretary of the Army, William H. Draper, Jr., the\r\nexperimental mixing of small black and white units had no place in the\r\nprogram to expand the use of Negroes in the Army.[7-77] He did not say\r\nwhen such a process would become appropriate or possible. Several\r\nmonths later Paul flatly told the Chief of Staff that integration of\r\nblack and white platoons in a company was precluded by stated Army\r\npolicy.[7-78]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-77: Memo, D/P&A for Under SA, 29 Apr 48,\r\n                   sub: Negro Utilization in the Postwar Army, CSGPA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-78: Idem for CofS, 21 Jun 48, CSGPA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Assignments_                                                      (p. 194)\r\n\r\nThe organization of black units was primarily the concern of the\r\nOrganization and Training Division; the Personnel and Administration\r\nDivision's major emphasis was on finding more jobs for black soldiers\r\nin keeping with the Gillem Board's call for the use of Negroes on a\r\nbroader professional scale. This could best be done, Paul decided, by\r\ncreating new black units in a variety of specialties and by using more\r\nNegroes in overhead spaces in unit headquarters where black\r\nspecialists would be completely interspersed with white. To that end\r\nhis office prepared plans in November 1946 listing numerous\r\noccupational specialties that might be offered black recruits. It also\r\noutlined in considerable detail a proposal for converting several\r\norganizations to black units, including a field artillery (155-mm.\r\nhowitzer) battalion, a tank company, a chemical mortar company, and an\r\nordnance heavy automotive maintenance company. These units would be\r\nconsidered experimental in the sense that the men would be specially\r\nselected and distributed in terms of ability. The officers, Negroes\r\ninsofar as practical, and cadre noncommissioned officers would be\r\nspecially assigned. Morale and learning ability would be carefully\r\nmonitored, and special training would be given men with below average\r\nAGCT scores. At the end of six months, these organizations would be\r\nmeasured against comparable white units. Mindful of the controversial\r\naspects of his plan, Paul had a draft circulated among the major\r\ncommands and services.[7-79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-79: DF, D/P&A to CG, AGF, et al., 16 Nov\r\n                   46, sub: Proposed Directive, Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Military Personnel; see also P&A Memo for Rcd, 14\r\n                   Nov 46; both in WDGPA 291.2 (12 Jul 46).]\r\n\r\nThe Army Ground Forces, first to answer, concentrated on Paul's\r\nproposal for experimental black units. Maj. Gen. Charles L. Bolte,\r\nspeaking for the commanding general, reported that in July 1946 the\r\ncommand had begun a training experiment to determine the most\r\neffective assignments for black enlisted men in the combat arms.\r\nBecause of troop reductions and the policy of discharging individuals\r\nwith low test scores, he said, the experiment had lasted only five\r\nweeks. Five weeks was apparently long enough, however, for Brig. Gen.\r\nBenjamin F. Caffey, commander of the 25th Regimental Combat Team\r\n(Provisional), to reach some rather startling conclusions. He\r\ndiscovered that the black soldier possessed an untrained and\r\nundisciplined mind and lacked confidence and pride in himself. In the\r\npast the Negro had been unable to summon the physical courage and\r\nstamina needed to withstand the shocks of modern battle. Integrating\r\nindividual Negroes or small black units into white organizations would\r\ntherefore only lower the standard of efficiency of the entire command.\r\nHe discounted the integration after the Battle of the Bulge, saying\r\nthat it succeeded only because it came at the end of the war and\r\nduring pursuit action. \"It still remains a moot question,\" Caffey\r\nconcluded, \"as to whether the Negroes in integrated units would have\r\nfought in a tough attack or defensive battle.\" Curiously enough he\r\nwent on to say that until Negroes reached the educational level of\r\nwhites, they should be organized into small combat units--battalions\r\nand smaller--and attached to white organizations in order to learn the\r\nproper standards of military discipline, conduct, administration,  (p. 195)\r\nand training. Despite its unfavorable opinion of experimental black\r\nunits, the Army Ground Forces did not reject the whole proposal\r\noutright but asked for a postponement of six months until its own\r\nreorganization, required by the War Department, was completed.[7-80]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-80: Ltr, Brig Gen B.

He believed, moreover, that such an\r\nexperiment would be weighted in favor of Negroes since comparisons\r\nwould be drawn between specially selected and trained black units and\r\naverage white units.[7-81] In a similar vein the Director of\r\nOrganization and Training, General Hall, found the conversion\r\n\"undesirable at this time.\" He also concluded that the problem was not\r\nlimited to training difficulties but involved a \"combination of\r\nfactors\" and could be solved through the application of common sense\r\nby the local commander.[7-82] The Chiefs of Ordnance and the Chemical\r\nCorps, the technical services involved in the proposed experiment,\r\nconcurred in the plan but added that they had no Negroes available for\r\nthe designated units.[7-83]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-81: DF, CG, AAF, to D/P&A, 27 Nov 45,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Military Personnel, WDGPA\r\n                   291.2 (16 Nov 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-82: Memo, D/O&T for D/P&A, 4 Dec 46, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Military Personnel, WDGOT\r\n                   291.2 (16 Nov 46).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-83: Tabs E and F to DF, D/P&A to DCofS,\r\n                   10 Jan 47, sub: Utilization of Negro Military\r\n                   Personnel in Overhead Installations, WDGPA 291.2\r\n                   (12 Jul 46).]\r\n\r\nIn the face of this strong opposition, Paul set aside his plan to\r\nestablish experimental black units and concentrated instead on the use\r\nof Negroes in overhead positions. On 10 January 1947 he drew up for\r\nthe Chief of Staff's office a list of 112 military occupational\r\nspecialties most commonly needed in overhead installations, including\r\nskilled jobs in the Signal, Ordnance, Transportation, Medical, and\r\nFinance Corps from which Negroes had been excluded. He called for an\r\nimmediate survey of the Army commands to determine specialties to\r\nwhich Negroes might be assigned, the number of Negroes that could be\r\nused in each, and the number of Negroes already qualified and\r\navailable for immediate assignment. Depending on the answers to this\r\nsurvey, he proposed that commanders assign immediately to overhead\r\njobs those Negroes qualified by school training, and open the\r\npertinent specialist courses to Negroes. Black quotas for the courses\r\nwould be increased, not only for recruits completing basic training,\r\nwho would be earmarked for assignment to overhead spaces, but also for\r\nmen already assigned to units, who would be returned to their units\r\nfor such assignments upon completion of their courses. Negroes thus\r\nassigned would perform the same duties as whites alongside them, but\r\nthey would be billeted and messed in separate detachments or       (p. 196)\r\nattached to existing black units for quarters and food.[7-84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-84: DF, D/P&A to DCofS, 10 Jan 47, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Military Personnel in Overhead\r\n                   Installations, WDGPA 291.2 (12 Jul 46).]\r\n\r\nThis proposal also met with some opposition. General Spaatz, for\r\nexample, objected on the same grounds he had used against experimental\r\nblack units. Forcing the military development of persons on the basis\r\nof color, General Ira C. Eaker, the deputy commander of Army Air\r\nForces, argued, was detrimental to the organization as a whole. Spaatz\r\nadded that it was desirable and necessary to select individual men on\r\nthe basis of their potential contribution to the service rather than\r\nin response to such criteria as race.[7-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-85: DF, CG, AAF (signed by Dep CG, Lt Gen\r\n                   Ira C.

Gen. Henry I. Hodes, objected\r\nto the timing of the Paul proposal since it would require action by\r\nfield commanders during a period when continuing mass demobilization\r\nand severe budget limitations were already causing rapid and frequent\r\nadjustments, especially in overhead installations. He also felt that\r\nsending men to school would disrupt unit activities; altogether too\r\nmany men would be assigned to overhead jobs, particularly during the\r\nperiod when Negroes were receiving training. Finally, he believed that\r\nPaul's directive was too detailed. He doubted that it was workable\r\nbecause it centralized power in Washington.[7-86]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-86: Memo, ADCofS for D/P&A, 24 Jan 47,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Military Personnel in\r\n                   Overhead Installations, WDCSA 291.2 (10 Jan 47).]\r\n\r\nGeneral Paul disagreed. The major flow of manpower, he maintained, was\r\ngoing to domestic rather than overseas installations. A relatively\r\nsmall shift of manpower was contemplated in his plan and would\r\ntherefore cause little dislocation. The plan would provide commanders\r\nwith the trained men they had been asking for. School training\r\ninevitably required men to be temporarily absent from their units,\r\nbut, since commanders always complained about the scarcity of trained\r\nNegroes, Paul predicted that they would accept a temporary\r\ninconvenience in order to have their men school trained. The Gillem\r\nBoard policy had been in effect for nine months, and \"no material\r\nimplementation by field commanders has as yet come to the attention of\r\nthe division.\" If any changes were to be accomplished, Paul declared,\r\n\"a specific directive must be issued.\" Since the Chief of Staff had\r\ncharged the Personnel and Administration Division with implementing\r\nGillem Board policy and since that policy expressly directed the use\r\nof Negroes in overhead positions, it seemed to Paul \"inconceivable\r\nthat any proposition ... designed to improve the caliber of any of\r\ntheir Negro personnel would be unworkable in the sense of creating a\r\npersonnel shortage.\" He again recommended that the directive be\r\napproved and released to the public to \"further the spirit and\r\nrecommendations of the Gillem Board Report.\"[7-87]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-87: Memo, D/P&A for General Hodes, 29 Jan\r\n                   47, sub: Utilization of Negro Personnel in Overhead\r\n                   Installations, WDGPA 291.2 (12 Jul 46).]\r\n\r\nHis superiors did not agree. Instead of a directive, General Hodes\r\nordered yet another survey to determine whether commanders were\r\nactually complying with Circular 124. He wanted all commands       (p. 197)\r\nto itemize all the occupation specialties of major importance that\r\ncontained black troops in overhead spaces.[7-88] Needless to say, the\r\nsurvey added little to the Army's knowledge of its racial problems.\r\nMost commanders reported full compliance with the circular and had no\r\nfurther recommendations.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-88: Memo, ADCofS for D/P&A, 4 Feb 47,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Military Personnel in\r\n                   Overhead Installations, WDCSA 291.2 (10 Jan 47);\r\n                   Ltr, TAG to CG, AAF, et al., 5 Mar 47, same sub,\r\n                   AGAM-PM 291.2 (27 Feb 47).]\r\n\r\nWith rare exceptions their statistics proved their claims specious.\r\nThe Far East Command, for example, reported no Negroes in overhead\r\nspaces, although General MacArthur planned to incorporate about 400\r\nNegroes into the bulk overhead units in Japan in July 1947. He\r\nreported that he would assign Negroes to overhead positions when\r\nqualified men could be spared. For the present they were needed in\r\nblack units.[7-89] Other commands produced similar statistics. The\r\nMediterranean theater, 8 percent black, had only four Negroes in 2,700\r\noverhead spaces, a decrease over the previous year, because, as its\r\ncommander explained, a shortage of skilled technicians and\r\nnoncommissioned officers in black units meant that none could be\r\nspared. More than 20 percent black, the Alaskan Department had no\r\nNegroes in overhead spaces. In Europe, on the other hand, some 2,125\r\noverhead spaces, 18.5 percent of the total, were filled by\r\nNegroes.[7-90]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-89: Msg, CINCFE to WD for AGPP-P, 3 May\r\n                   47, C-52352.

All in AGPP-P 291.2 (6 Feb 47).]\r\n\r\nAlthough Negroes held some 7 percent of all overhead positions in the\r\nfield services, the picture was far from clear. More than 8 percent of\r\nthe Army Air Forces' 105,000 overhead spaces, for example, were filled\r\nby Negroes, but the Army Ground Forces used only 473 Negroes, who\r\noccupied 5 percent of its overhead spaces. In the continental armies\r\nalmost 14,000 Negroes were assigned to overhead, 13.35 percent of the\r\ntotal of such spaces--a more than equitable figure. Yet most were\r\ncooks, bakers, truck drivers, and the like; all finance clerks, motion\r\npicture projectionists, and personnel assistants were white. In the\r\nfield commands the use of Negroes in Signal, Ordnance, Transportation,\r\nMedical, and Finance overhead spaces was at a minimum, although\r\nfigures varied from one command to the other. The Transportation\r\nCorps, more than 23 percent black, used almost 25 percent of its\r\nNegroes in overhead; the Chemical Corps, 28 percent black, used more\r\nthan 30 percent of its Negroes in overhead. At the same time virtually\r\nall skilled military occupational specialties were closed to Negroes\r\nin the Signal Corps, and the Chief of Finance stated flatly: \"It is\r\nconsidered impractical to have negro overhead assigned to these\r\n[field] activities and none are utilized.\"[7-91]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-91: The reports of all these services are\r\n                   inclosures to DF, TAG to D/P&A, 23 Apr 47, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Military Personnel in Overhead\r\n                   Installations, AGPP-P 291.2 (6 Feb 47).

Although all the\r\ncommanders of the zone of interior armies reported that Negroes had\r\nequal opportunity with whites to attend Army schools, in fact more\r\nthan half of all the Army's courses were not open to black soldiers\r\nregardless of their qualifications. The Ordnance Department, for\r\nexample, declared that all its technical courses were open to\r\nqualified Negroes, but as late as November 1947 the Ordnance School in\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, had openings for 440 whites but none for blacks.\r\n\r\nIronically, the results of the Hodes survey were announced just four\r\ndays short of Circular 124's first birthday. Along with the other\r\nsurveys and directives of the past year, it demonstrated that in\r\nseveral important particulars the Gillem Board's recommendations were\r\nbeing only partially and indifferently followed. Obviously, some way\r\nmust be found to dispel the atmosphere of indifference, and in some\r\nquarters hostility, that now enveloped Circular 124.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A New Approach_\r\n\r\nA new approach was possible mainly because General Paul and his staff\r\nhad amassed considerable experience during the past year in how to use\r\nblack troops. They had come to understand that the problems inherent\r\nin broadening the employment of black soldiers--the procurement of\r\ndesirable black recruits, their training, especially school training\r\nfor military occupational specialties, and their eventual placement in\r\nspaces that used that training--were interrelated and that progress in\r\none of these areas was impossible without advances in the other two.\r\nIn November 1947 the Personnel and Administration Division decided to\r\npush for a modest step-by-step increase in the number of jobs open to\r\nNegroes, using this increase to justify an expansion of school quotas\r\nfor Negroes and a special recruitment program.\r\n\r\nIt was a good time for such an initiative, for the Army was in the\r\nmidst of an important reorganization of its program for specialist\r\ntraining. On 9 May 1947 the War Department had introduced a Career\r\nGuidance Program for managing the careers of enlisted men. To help\r\neach soldier develop his maximum potential and provide the most\r\nequitable system for promotions, it divided all Army jobs into several\r\ncareer fields--two, for example, were infantry and food service--and\r\nestablished certain job progressions, or ladders, within each field.\r\nAn enlisted man could move up the ladder in his career field to\r\nincreased responsibility and higher rank as he completed school\r\ncourses, gained experience, and passed examinations.[7-92]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-92: WD Cir 118, 9 May 47.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Paul wanted to take advantage of this unusually fluid\r\nsituation. He could point out that black soldiers must be included in\r\nthe new program, but how was he to fit them in? Black units lacked the\r\ndiverse jobs open to whites, and as a result Negroes were clustered in\r\na relatively small number of military specialties with few career\r\nfields open to them. Moreover, some 111 of the Army's 124 listed\r\nschool courses required an Army General Classification Test score  (p. 199)\r\nof ninety for admission, and the Personnel and Administration Division\r\ndiscovered that 72 percent of Negroes enlisted between April 1946 and\r\nMarch 1947 as compared to 29 percent of whites scored below that\r\nminimum. Excluded from schools, these men would find it difficult to\r\nmove up the career ladders.[7-93]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-93: P&A Memo for Rcd, attached to DF,\r\n                   D/P&A to TAG, 11 Jun 47, sub: Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Manpower in the Postwar Army in Connection With\r\n                   Enlisted Career Guidance Program, WDGPA 291.2 (11\r\n                   Jun 47).]\r\n\r\nConcerned that the new career program would discriminate against black\r\nsoldiers, Paul could not, however, agree with the solution suggested\r\nby Roy K. Davenport, an Army manpower expert. On the basis of a\r\ndetailed study that he and a representative of the Personnel and\r\nAdministration Division conducted on Negroes in the career program,\r\nDavenport concluded that despite significant improvement in the\r\nquality of black recruits in recent months more than half the black\r\nenlisted men would still fail to qualify for the schooling demanded in\r\nthe new program. He wanted the Army to consider dropping the test\r\nscore requirement for school admission and substituting a \"composite\r\nof variables,\" including length of service in a military occupation\r\nand special performance ratings. Such a system, he pointed out, would\r\ninsure the most capable in terms of performance would be given\r\nopportunities for schooling and would eliminate the racial\r\ndifferential in career opportunity. It was equally important,\r\nDavenport thought, to broaden arbitrarily the list of occupational\r\nspecialties, open all school courses to Negroes, and increase the\r\nblack quotas for courses already open to them.[7-94]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-94: Davenport, \"Matters Relating to the\r\n                   Participation of Negro Personnel in the Career\r\n                   Program,\" attached to DF, D/P&A to Brig Gen J.

He believed that the Army should first widen the\r\nemployment of black units and individuals in overhead spaces, and then\r\nfollow up with increased school quotas and special recruitment. Paul\r\nhad already learned from recent surveys that the number of available\r\noverhead positions would allow only a modest increase in the number of\r\nspecialized jobs available to Negroes; any significant increase would\r\nrequire the creation of new black units. Given the limitations on\r\norganized units, any increase would be at the expense of white units.\r\n\r\nThe Organization and Training Division had the right to decide which\r\nunits would be white and which black, and considering the strong\r\nopposition in that division to the creation of more black units, an\r\nopposition that enjoyed support from the Chief of Staff's office,\r\nPaul's efforts seemed in vain. But again an unusual opportunity\r\npresented itself when the Chief of Staff approved a reorganization of\r\nthe general reserve in late 1947. It established a continentally\r\nbased, mobile striking force of four divisions with supporting units.\r\nEach unit would have a well-trained core of Regular Army or other\r\ntroops who might be expected to remain in the service for a        (p. 200)\r\nconsiderable period of time. Manpower and budget limitations precluded\r\na fully manned and trained general reserve, but new units for the four\r\ncontinental divisions, which were in varying stages of readiness, were\r\nauthorized.[7-95]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-95: For a discussion of the\r\n                   reorganization of the general reserve, see the\r\n                   introduction to John B.

Nine of the units were attached to\r\ngeneral reserve divisions, including the 2d Armored, 2d Infantry, and\r\n82d Airborne Division. The rest, nondivisional elements, were assigned\r\nto the various continental armies.[7-96]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-96: Ltrs, TAG to CG, Each Army, et al.,\r\n                   18 Dec 47 and 1 Mar 48. sub: Activation and\r\n                   Reorganization of Certain Units of the General\r\n                   Reserve, AGAO-1 322 (28 Nov 47 and 8 Jan 48).]\r\n\r\nWith the spaces in hand, the Personnel and Administration Division\r\nlaunched a special drive in late December 1947 to secure 6,318\r\nNegroes, 565 men per week, above the normal recruiting quotas. It\r\ncalled on the commanding generals of the continental armies to enlist\r\nmen for three years' service in the Regular Army from among those  (p. 201)\r\nwho had previous military service, had completed high school, or\r\nhad won the Bronze Star, Commendation Ribbon, or a decoration for\r\nvalor, and who could make a \"reasonable\" score on the classification\r\ntest. After basic training at Fort Dix and Fort Knox, the men would be\r\neligible for specialized schooling and direct assignment to the newly\r\nconverted units.[7-97]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-97: Army Memo 600-750-26, 17 Dec 47, sub:\r\n                   Enlistment of Negroes for Special Units; DF, D/P&A\r\n                   to TAG, 27 Jan 48, sub: Training Div Assignment\r\n                   Procedures for Negro Pers Enlisting Under\r\n                   Provisions of DA Memo 600-750-26, 17 Dec 47, CSGPA\r\n                   291.2 (7 Jan 48).]\r\n\r\nThe conversion of units did not expand to any great extent the range\r\nof military specialties open to Negroes because they were already\r\nserving in similarly organized units. But it did increase the number\r\nof skilled occupation slots available to them. To force a further\r\nincrease in the number of school-trained Negroes, Paul asked The\r\nAdjutant General to determine how many spaces for school-trained\r\nspecialists existed in the units converted from white to black and how\r\nmany spaces for school-trained specialists were unfilled in black\r\nunits worldwide. He wanted to increase the quotas for each\r\nschool-trained specialty to insure filling all these positions.[7-98] He\r\nalso arranged to increase black quotas in certain Military Police,\r\nSignal, and Medical Corps courses, and he insisted that a directive be\r\nsent to all major continental commands making mandatory the use of\r\nNegroes trained under the increased school quotas.[7-99] Moving further\r\nalong these lines, Paul suggested The Adjutant General assign a black\r\nofficer to study measures that might broaden the use of Negroes in the\r\nArmy, increase school quotas for them, select black students properly,\r\nand assign trained black soldiers to suitable specialties.[7-100]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-98: DF, D/P&A to TAG, 27 Jan 48, sub:\r\n                   Training Div Assignment Procedures for Negro\r\n                   Personnel Enlisting Under Provisions of DA Memo\r\n                   600-750-26, 17 Dec 47; ibid., 29 Jan 48, sub:\r\n                   Notification to Z1 Armies of Certain Negro School\r\n                   Training; both in CSGPA 291.2 (7 Jan 48).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-99: Ibid., 1 Mar 48, sub: Utilization of\r\n                   Negro School Trained Personnel, CSGPA 291.2 (7 Jan\r\n                   48).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-100: DF D/P&A for Brig Gen Joseph J.\r\n                   O'Hare, Chief Mil Pers Mgt Gp, 3 Nov 47, CSGPA\r\n                   291.2 (3 Nov 47).]\r\n\r\nThe Adjutant General assigned Maj. James D. Fowler, a black graduate\r\nof West Point, class of 1941, to perform all these tasks. Fowler\r\nsurveyed the nineteen newly converted units and recommended that 1,134\r\nmen, approximately 20 percent of those enlisted for the special\r\nexpansion of the general reserve, be trained in thirty-seven courses\r\nof instruction--an increase of 103 black spaces in these courses.\r\nExamining worldwide Army strength to determine deficiencies in\r\nschool-trained specialties in black units, he recommended a total\r\nincrease of 172 spaces in another thirty-seven courses. Studying the\r\norganizational tables of more than two hundred military bases, Fowler\r\nrecommended that black school quotas for another eleven military\r\noccupational specialties, for which there were currently no black\r\nquotas, be set at thirty-nine spaces.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these recommendations, the Army increased the number\r\nof courses with quotas for Negroes from 30 to 62; black quotas were\r\nincreased in 14 courses; 16 others remained unchanged or their black\r\nquotas were slightly decreased. New courses were opened to Negroes in\r\nthe Adjutant General's School, the airborne section of the         (p. 202)\r\nInfantry School, and the Artillery, Armored, Engineer, Medical,\r\nMilitary Police, Ordnance, Quartermaster, Signal, and Transportation\r\nschools. Courses with increased quotas were in Transportation,\r\nQuartermaster, Ordnance, and Engineer schools.[7-101] The number of\r\nblack soldiers in courses open to recruits quickly grew from 5 to 13.7\r\npercent of total enrollment, and the number of courses open to Negroes\r\nrose from 30 to 48 percent of all the entry courses in the Army school\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-101: Memo, Chief, Morale, and Welfare Br,\r\n                   P&A, for Chief, Mil Pers Mgt Gp, P&A, 27 Feb 48,\r\n                   sub: School Input Quotas for Enlisted Personnel\r\n                   From the Replacement Stream (other than Air), CSGPA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Quota System: An Assessment_\r\n\r\nThe conversion of nineteen units from white to black in December 1947,\r\nthe procurement of 6,000 Negroes to man these units, and the increases\r\nin black quotas for the Army schools to train specialists for these\r\nand other black units worldwide marked the high point of the Army's\r\nattempt to broaden the employment of Negroes under the terms of the\r\nGillem Board policy. As Paul well knew, the training of black troops\r\nwas linked to their placement and until the great expansion of the\r\nArmy in 1950 for the Korean War no other units were converted from\r\nwhite to black. The increase in black combat units and the spread in\r\nthe range of military occupations for black troops, therefore, were\r\nnever achieved as planned. The interval between wars ended just as it\r\nbegan with the majority of white soldiers serving in combat or\r\nadministrative units and the majority of black soldiers continuing to\r\nwork in service or combat support units.[7-102]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-102: Memo, Brig Gen J. J. O'Hare, Dep\r\n                   Dir, P&A, for SA, 9 Mar 48, sub: Implementation of\r\n                   WD Circular 124, CSGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Personnel and Organization Division made no further requests for\r\nincreased school quotas for Negroes, and even those increases already\r\napproved were short-lived. As soon as the needs of the converted units\r\nwere met, the school quotas for Negroes were reduced to a level\r\nsufficient to fill the replacement needs of the black units. By March\r\n1949, spaces for black students in the replacement stream courses had\r\ndeclined from the 237 recommended by Major Fowler to eighty-two; the\r\nnumber of replacement stream courses open to Negroes fell from 48\r\npercent of all courses offered to 19.8 percent. Fowler had expected to\r\nfollow up his study of school quotas in the Military Police, Signal\r\nCorps, and Medical Corps with surveys of other schools figuring in the\r\nCareer Guidance Program, but since no additional overhead positions\r\nwere ever converted from white to black, no further need existed for\r\nschool quota studies. The three-point study suggested by Paul to find\r\nways to increase school quotas for Negroes was never made.\r\n\r\nThe War Department's problems with its segregation policy were only\r\nintensified by its insistence on maintaining a racial quota. Whatever\r\nthe authors' intention, the quota was publicized as a guarantee of\r\nblack participation. In practice it not only restricted the number of\r\nNegroes in the Army but also limited the number and variety of     (p. 203)\r\nblack units that could be formed and consequently the number and\r\nvariety of jobs available to Negroes. Further, it restricted the\r\nopenings for Negroes in the Army's training schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE PLAYERS, SEAVIEW SERVICE CLUB, TOKYO, JAPAN,\r\n1948.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, enlistment policies combined with Selective Service\r\nregulations to make it difficult for the Army to produce from its\r\nblack quota enough men with the potential to be trained in those\r\nskills required by a variety of units. Attracted by the superior\r\neconomic status promised by the Army, the average black soldier\r\ncontinued to reenlist, thus blocking the enlistment of potential\r\nmilitary leaders from the increasing number of educated black youths.\r\nThis left the Army with a mass of black soldiers long in service but\r\ntoo old to fight, learn new techniques, or provide leadership for the\r\nfuture. Subject to charges of discrimination, the Army only fitfully\r\nand for limited periods tried to eliminate low scorers to make room\r\nfor more qualified men. Yet to the extent to which it failed to\r\nattract educated Negroes and provide them with modern military skills,\r\nit failed to perform a principal function of the peacetime Army, that\r\nof preparing a cadre of leaders for future wars.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the problem of low-scoring Negroes it should be\r\nremembered that the Army General Classification Test, universally\r\naccepted in the armed services as an objective device to measure\r\nability, has been seriously questioned by some manpower experts.   (p. 204)\r\nSince World War II, for example, educational psychologists have\r\nlearned that ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds have an\r\nimportant influence on performance in general testing. Davenport, who\r\neventually became a senior manpower official in the Department of\r\nDefense has, for one, concluded that the test scores created a\r\ndistorted picture of the mental ability of the black soldier. He has\r\nalso questioned the fairness of the Army testing system, charging that\r\nuniform time periods were not always provided for black and white\r\nrecruits taking the tests and that this injustice was only one of\r\nseveral inequalities of test administration that might have\r\ncontributed to the substantial differences in the scores of\r\napplicants.[7-103]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 7-103: Ltr, Roy K.

In the five years after\r\nWorld War II, the actual number of white soldiers who scored in the\r\nlowest test categories equaled or exceeded the number of black\r\nsoldiers. The Army had no particular difficulty using these white\r\nsoldiers to advantage, and in fact refused to discharge all Class V\r\nmen in 1946. Segregation was the heart of the matter; the less gifted\r\nwhites could be scattered throughout the Army but the less gifted\r\nblacks were concentrated in the segregated black units.\r\n\r\nReversing the coin, what could the Army do with the highly qualified\r\nblack soldier? His technical skills were unneeded in the limited\r\nnumber and variety of black units; he was barred from white units. In\r\nan attempt to deal with this problem, the Gillem policy directed that\r\nNegroes with special skills or qualifications be employed in overhead\r\ndetachments. Such employment, however, depended in great part on the\r\nwillingness of commanders to use school-trained Negroes. Many of these\r\nofficers complained that taking the best qualified Negroes out of\r\nblack units for assignment to overhead detachments deprived black\r\nunits of their leaders. Furthermore, overhead units represented so\r\nsmall a part of the whole that they had little effect on the Army's\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe racial quota also complicated the postwar reduction in Army\r\nstrength. Since the strength and composition of the Army was fixed by\r\nthe defense budget and military planning, the majority of new black\r\nsoldiers produced by the quota could be organized into units only at\r\nthe expense of white units already in existence. In light of past\r\nperformance of black units and in the interests of efficiency and\r\neconomy, particularly at a time of reduced operating funds and a\r\ngrowing cold war, how could the Army justify converting efficient\r\nwhite units into less capable black units? The same question applied\r\nto the formation of composite units. Grouping lower scoring black\r\nunits with white units, many of the Army staff believed, would lower\r\nthe efficiency of the whole and complicate the Army's relations with\r\nthe civilian community. As a result, the black units remained largely\r\nseparate, limited in number, and tremendously overstrength throughout\r\nthe postwar period.\r\n\r\nSome of these problems, at least, might have been solved had the   (p. 205)\r\nArmy created a special staff group to oversee the new policy, a key\r\nproposal of the Gillem Board. The Personnel and Administration\r\nDivision was primarily interested in individuals, in trying to place\r\nqualified Negroes on an individual basis; the Organization and\r\nTraining Division was primarily concerned with units, in trying to\r\nexpand the black units to approximate the combat to service ratio of\r\nwhite units. These interests conflicted at times, and with no single\r\nagency possessing overriding authority, matters came to an impasse,\r\nblocking reform of Army practices. Instead, the staff played a sterile\r\nnumbers game, seeking to impose a strict ratio everywhere. But it was\r\nimpossible to have a 10 percent proportion of Negroes in every post,\r\nin every area, in every overseas theater; it was equally impossible to\r\nhave 10 percent in every activity, in every arm and service, in every\r\ntype of task. Yet wherever the Army failed to organize its black\r\nstrength by quota, it was open to charges of racial discrimination.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to overlook the signs of racial progress\r\nachieved under the Gillem Board policy. Because of its provisions\r\nthousands of Negroes came to serve in the postwar Regular Army, many\r\nof them in a host of new assignments and occupations. But if the\r\npolicy proved a qualified success in terms of numbers, it still failed\r\nto gain equal treatment and opportunity for black soldiers, and in the\r\nend the racial quotas and diverse racial units better served those who\r\nwanted to keep a segregated Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8                                                          (p. 206)\r\n\r\nSegregation's Consequences\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Army staff had to overcome tremendous obstacles in order to carry\r\nout even a modest number of the Gillem Board's recommendations. In\r\naddition to prejudices the Army shared with much of American society\r\nand the institutional inertia that often frustrates change in so large\r\nan organization, the staff faced the problem of making efficient\r\nsoldiers out of a large group of men who were for the most part\r\nseriously deficient in education, training, and motivation. To the\r\nextent that it overcame these difficulties, the Army's postwar racial\r\npolicy must be judged successful and, considered in the context of the\r\ntimes, progressive.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Gillem Board policy was doomed from the start.\r\nSegregation was at the heart of the race problem. Justified as a means\r\nof preventing racial trouble, segregation only intensified it by\r\nconcentrating the less able and poorly motivated. Segregation\r\nincreased the problems of all commanders concerned and undermined the\r\nprestige of black officers. It exacerbated the feelings of the\r\nnation's largest minority toward the Army and multiplied demands for\r\nchange. In the end Circular 124 was abandoned because the Army found\r\nit impossible to fight another war under a policy of racial quotas and\r\nunits. But if the quota had not defeated the policy, other problems\r\nattendant on segregation would probably have been sufficient to the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discipline and Morale Among Black Troops_\r\n\r\nBy any measure of discipline and morale, black soldiers as a group\r\nposed a serious problem to the Army in the postwar period. The\r\nstandard military indexes--serious incidents statistics, venereal\r\ndisease rates, and number of courts-martial--revealed black soldiers\r\nin trouble out of all proportion to their percentage of the Army's\r\npopulation. When these personal infractions and crimes were added to\r\nthe riots and serious racial incidents that continued to occur in the\r\nArmy all over the world after the war, the dimensions of the problem\r\nbecame clear.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, when Negroes accounted for 8.5 percent of the Army's average\r\nstrength, black prisoners entering rehabilitation centers,\r\ndisciplinary barracks, and federal institutions were 17.3 percent of\r\nthe Army total. In 1946, when the average black strength had risen (p. 207)\r\nto 9.35 percent of the Army's total, 25.9 percent of the soldiers sent\r\nto the stockade were Negroes. The following tabulation gives their\r\npercentage of all military prisoners by offense:\r\n\r\n                                                       Negro\r\n  Military Offenses                                  Percentage\r\n\r\n  Absent without leave                                  13.4\r\n  Desertion                                             17.4\r\n  Misbehavior before the enemy                           1.9\r\n  Violation of arrest or confinement                    12.6\r\n  Discreditable conduct toward superior                 49.6\r\n\r\n  Civil Offenses\r\n\r\n  Murder                                                62.2\r\n  Rape                                                  53.1\r\n  Robbery                                               33.1\r\n  Manslaughter                                          46.3\r\n  Burglary and housebreaking                            29.0\r\n  Larceny                                               17.2\r\n  Forgery                                                8.9\r\n  Assault                                               59.0\r\n\r\n  _Source_: Correction Branch, TAGO, copy in CMH.\r\n\r\nThe most common explanation offered for such statistics is that\r\nfundamental injustices drove these black servicemen to crime. Probably\r\nmore to the point, most black soldiers, especially during the early\r\npostwar period, served in units burdened with many disadvantaged\r\nindividuals, soldiers more likely to get into trouble given the\r\ncharacteristically weak leadership in these units. But another\r\nexplanation for at least some of these crime statistics hinged on\r\ncommanders' power to define serious offenses. In general, unit\r\ncommanders had a great deal of discretion in framing the charges\r\nbrought against an alleged offender; indeed, where some minor offenses\r\nwere concerned officers could even conclude that a given infraction\r\nwas not a serious matter at all and simply dismiss the soldier with a\r\nverbal reprimand and a warning not to repeat his offense. Whereas one\r\ncommander might decide that a case called for a charge of aggravated\r\nassault, another, faced with the same set of facts, might settle for a\r\ncharge of simple assault. If it is reasonable to assume that, as a\r\npart of the pattern of discrimination, Negroes accused of offenses\r\nlike misconduct toward superiors, AWOL, and assault often received\r\nless generous treatment from their officers than white servicemen,\r\nthen it is reasonable to suspect that statistics on Negroes involved\r\nin crime may reflect such discriminatory treatment.\r\n\r\nThe crime figures were particularly distressing to the individual\r\nblack soldier, as indeed they were to his civilian counterpart,\r\nbecause as a member of a highly visible minority he became identified\r\nwith the wrongdoing of some of his fellows, spectacularly reported in\r\nthe press, while his own more typical attendance to orders and\r\ncompetent performance of duty were more often buried in the Army's\r\nadministrative reports. In particular, Negroes among the large\r\noverseas commands suffered embarrassment. The Gillem Board policy  (p. 208)\r\nwas announced just as the Army began the occupation of Germany and\r\nJapan. As millions of veterans returned home, to be replaced in lesser\r\nnumbers by volunteers, black troops began to figure prominently in the\r\noccupation forces. On 1 January 1947 the Army had 59,795 Negroes\r\nstationed overseas, 10.77 percent of the total number of overseas\r\ntroops, divided principally between the two major overseas commands.\r\nBy 1 March 1948, in keeping with the general reduction of forces,\r\nblack strength overseas was reduced to 23,387 men, but black\r\npercentages in Europe and the Far East remained practically\r\nunchanged.[8-1] It was among these Negroes, scattered throughout\r\nGermany and Japan, that most of the disciplinary problems occurred.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-1: STM-30, Strength of the Army, 1 Jan 47\r\n                   and 1 Mar 48.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first two years of peace, black soldiers consistently\r\ndominated the Army's serious-incident rate, a measure of indictments\r\nand accusations involving troops in crimes against persons and\r\nproperty. In June 1946, for example, black soldiers in the European\r\ntheater were involved in serious incidents (actual and alleged) at the\r\nrate of 2.57 cases per 1,000 men. The rate among white soldiers for\r\nthe same period was .79 cases per 1,000. The rate for both groups rose\r\nconsiderably in 1947. The figure for Negroes climbed to a yearly\r\naverage of 3.94 incidents per 1,000; the figure for whites, reflecting\r\nan even greater gain, reached 1.88. These crime rates were not out of\r\nline with America's national crime rate statistics, which, based on a\r\nsample of 173 cities, averaged about 3.25 during the same period.[8-2]\r\nNevertheless, the rate was of particular concern to the government\r\nbecause the majority of the civil offenses were perpetuated against\r\nGerman and Japanese nationals and therefore lowered the prestige and\r\neffectiveness of the occupation forces.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-2: Geis Monograph, pp. 138-39 and Chart\r\n                   4.]\r\n\r\nLess important but still a serious internal problem for the Army was a\r\nparallel rise in the incidence of venereal disease. Various reasons\r\nhave been advanced for the great postwar rise in the Army's venereal\r\ndisease rate. It is obvious, for example, that the rapid conversion\r\nfrom war to peacetime duties gave many American soldiers new leisure\r\nand freedom to engage in widespread fraternization with the civilian\r\npopulation. Serious economic dislocation in the conquered countries\r\ndrove many citizens into a life of prostitution and crime. By the same\r\ntoken, the breakdown of public health services had removed a major\r\nobstacle to the spread of social disease. But whatever the reasons, a\r\nhigh rate of venereal disease--the overseas rate was three times\r\ngreater than the rate reported for soldiers in the United\r\nStates--reflected a serious breakdown in military discipline, posed a\r\nthreat to the combat effectiveness of the commands, and produced lurid\r\nrumors and reports on Army morality.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of crime statistics, the rate of venereal disease for\r\nblack soldiers in the overseas commands far exceeded the figure for\r\nwhites. The Eighth Army, the major unit in the Far East, reported for\r\nthe month of June 1946 1,263 cases of venereal disease for whites, or\r\n139 cases per 1,000 men per year; 769 cases were reported for Negroes,\r\nor 1,186 cases per 1,000 men per year. The rates for the European  (p. 209)\r\nCommand for July 1946 stood at 806 cases per 1,000 Negroes per year as\r\ncompared with 203 for white soldiers. The disease rate improved\r\nconsiderably during 1947 in both commands, but still the rates for\r\nblack troops averaged 354 per 1,000 men per year in Eighth Army\r\ncompared to 89 for whites. In Europe the rate was 663 per 1,000 men\r\nper year for Negroes compared to 172 for whites. At the same time the\r\nrate for all soldiers in the United States was 58 per 1,000 per\r\nyear.[8-3] Some critics question the accuracy of these statistics,\r\ncharging that more white soldiers, with informal access to medical\r\ntreatment, were able to escape detection by the Medical Department's\r\nstatisticians, at least in cases of more easily treated strains of\r\nvenereal disease.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-3: Ibid., pp. 138-39; Eighth Army (AFPAC)\r\n                   Hist Div, _Occupational Monograph of the Eighth\r\n                   Army in Japan_ (hereafter AFPAC Monograph), 3:171.]\r\n\r\nThe court-martial rate for black soldiers serving overseas was also\r\nhigher than for white soldiers. Black soldiers in Europe, for example,\r\nwere court-martialed at the rate of 3.48 men per 1,000 during the\r\nthird quarter of 1946 compared with a 1.14 rate for whites. A similar\r\nsituation existed in the Far East where the black service units had a\r\nmonthly court-martial rate nearly double the average rate of the\r\nEighth Army as a whole.[8-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-4: Geis Monograph; AFPAC Monograph,\r\n                   3:87-88 and charts, 4:91-97 and JAG Illus. No. 3.\r\n                   It should be noted that on occasion individual\r\n                   white units registered disciplinary rates\r\n                   spectacularly higher than these averages. In a\r\n                   nine-month period in 1946-47, for example, a\r\n                   120-man white unit stationed in Vienna, Austria,\r\n                   had 10 general courts-martial, between 30 and 40\r\n                   special and summary courts-martial, and 40 of its\r\n                   members separated under the provisions of AR\r\n                   368-369.]\r\n\r\nThe disproportionate black crime and disease rates were symptomatic of\r\na condition that also revealed itself in the racially oriented riots\r\nand disturbances that continued to plague the postwar Army. Sometimes\r\nblack soldiers were merely reacting to blatant discrimination\r\ncountenanced by their officers, to racial insults, and at times even\r\nto physical assaults, but nevertheless they reacted violently and in\r\nnumbers. The resulting incidents prompted investigations,\r\nrecriminations, and publicity.\r\n\r\nTwo such disturbances, more spectacular than the typical flare-up, and\r\nimportant because they influenced Army attitudes toward blacks,\r\noccurred at Army bases in the United States. The first was a mutiny at\r\nMacDill Airfield, Florida, which began on 27 October 1946 at a dance\r\nfor black noncommissioned officers to which privates were denied\r\nadmittance. Military police were called when a fight broke out among\r\nthe black enlisted men and rapidly developed into a belligerent\r\ndemonstration by a crowd that soon reached mob proportions. Police\r\nfire was answered by members of the mob and one policeman and one\r\nrioter were wounded. Urged on by its ringleaders, the mob then\r\noverwhelmed the main gate area and disarmed the sentries. The rioters\r\nretained control of the area until early the next day, when the\r\ncommanding general persuaded them to disband. Eleven Negroes were\r\ncharged with mutiny.[8-5] A second incident, a riot with strong racial\r\novertones, occurred at Fort Leavenworth in May 1947 following an\r\naltercation between white and black prisoners in the Army Disciplinary\r\nBarracks. The rioting, caused by allegations of favoritism         (p. 210)\r\naccorded to prisoners, lasted for two days; one man was killed and six\r\nwere injured.[8-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-5: \"History of MacDill Army Airfield,\r\n                   326th AAB Unit, October 1946,\" pp. 10-11, AFCHO\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-6: Florence Murray, ed., _The Negro\r\n                   Handbook, 1949_ (New York: Macmillan, 1949), pp.\r\n                   109-10.]\r\n\r\nDisturbances in overseas commands, although less serious, were of deep\r\nconcern to the Army because of the international complications. In\r\nApril 1946, for example, soldiers of the 449th Signal Construction\r\nDetachment threw stones at two French officers who were driving\r\nthrough the village of Weyersbusch in the Rhine Palatinate. The\r\nofficers, one of them injured, returned to the village with French\r\nMP's and requested an explanation of the incident. They were quickly\r\nsurrounded by about thirty armed Negroes of the detachment who,\r\naccording to the French, acted in an aggressive and menacing manner.\r\nAs a result, the Supreme French Commander in Germany requested his\r\nAmerican counterpart to remove all black troops from the French zone.\r\nThe U.S. commander in Europe, General Joseph T. McNarney, investigated\r\nthe incident, court-martialed its instigators, and transferred the\r\nentire detachment out of the French zone. At the same time his staff\r\nexplained to the French that to prohibit the stationing of Negroes in\r\nthe area would be discriminatory and contrary to Army policy. Black\r\nspecialists continued to operate in the French zone, although none\r\nwere subsequently stationed there permanently.[8-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-7: Geis Monograph, pp. 145-47.]\r\n\r\nThe Far East Command also suffered racial incidents. The Eighth Army\r\nreported in 1946 that \"racial agitation\" was one of the primary causes\r\nof assault, the most frequent violent crime among American troops in\r\nJapan. This racial agitation was usually limited to the American\r\ncommunity, however, and seldom involved the civilian population.[8-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-8: AFPAC Monograph, 2:176.]\r\n\r\nThe task of maintaining a biracial Army overseas in peacetime was\r\nmarked with embarrassing incidents and time-consuming investigations.\r\nThe Army was constantly hearing about its racial problems overseas and\r\ngetting no end of advice. For example, in May 1946 Louis Lautier,\r\nchief of the Negro Newspaper Publishers Association news service,\r\ninformed the Assistant Secretary of War that fifty-five of the seventy\r\nAmerican soldiers executed for crimes in the European theater were\r\nblack. Most were category IV and V men. \"In light of this fact,\"\r\nLautier charged, \"the blame for the comparatively high rate of crime\r\namong black soldiers belongs to the American educational system.\"[8-9]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-9: Ltr, Louis R. Lautier to Howard C.\r\n                   Petersen, 28 May 46. ASW 291.2 (NT).]\r\n\r\nBut when a delegation of publishers from Lautier's organization toured\r\nEuropean installations during the same period, the members took a more\r\ncomprehensive look at the Seventh Army's race problems. They told\r\nSecretary Patterson that they found all American soldiers reacting\r\nsimilarly to poor leadership, substandard living conditions, and\r\nmenial occupations whenever such conditions existed. Although they\r\nprofessed to see no difference in the conduct of white and black\r\ntroops, they went on to list factors that contributed to the bad\r\nconduct of some of the black troops including the dearth of black\r\nofficers, hostility of military police, inadequate recreation, and\r\npoor camp location. They also pointed out that many soldiers in the\r\noccupation had been shipped overseas without basic training,       (p. 211)\r\nscored low in the classification tests, and served under young and\r\ninexperienced noncoms. Many black regulars, on the other hand, once\r\nproud members of combat units, now found themselves performing menial\r\ntasks in the backwaters of the occupation. Above all, the publishers\r\nwitnessed widespread racial discrimination, a condition that followed\r\ninevitably, they believed, from the Army's segregation policy.\r\nConditions in the Army appeared to them to facilitate an immediate\r\nshift to integration; conditions in Europe and elsewhere made such a\r\nshift imperative. Yet they found most commanders in Europe still\r\nunaware of the Gillem Board Report and its liberalizing provisions,\r\nand little being done to encourage within the Army the sensitivity to\r\nracial matters that makes life in a biracial society bearable. Until\r\nthe recommendations of the board were carried out and discrimination\r\nstopped, they warned the secretary, the Army must expect racial\r\nflare-ups to continue.[8-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-10: Frank L. Stanley, Report of the Negro\r\n                   Newspaper Publishers Association to the Honorable\r\n                   Secretary of War on Troops and Conditions in\r\n                   Europe, 18 Jul 46, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nCharacteristically, the Secretary of War's civilian aide, Marcus Ray,\r\nnever denied evidence of misconduct among black troops, but\r\nconcentrated instead on finding the cause. Returning from a month's\r\ntour of Pacific installations in September 1946, he bluntly pointed\r\nout to Secretary Patterson that high venereal disease and\r\ncourt-martial rates among black troops were \"in direct proportion to\r\nthe high percentage of Class IV and Vs among the Negro personnel.\"\r\nGiven Ray's conclusion, the solution was relatively simple: the Army\r\nshould \"vigorously implement\" its recently promulgated policy, long\r\nsupported by Ray, and discharge persons with test scores of less than\r\nseventy.[8-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-11: Ray, Rpt of Tour of Pacific\r\n                   Installations to SW Patterson, 7 Aug-6 Sep 46, ASW\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe civilian aide was not insensitive to the effects of segregation on\r\nblack soldiers, but he stressed the practical results of the Army's\r\npolicy instead of making a sweeping indictment of segregation. For\r\nexample, he criticized the report of the noted criminologist, Leonard\r\nKeeler, who had recently studied the criminal activities of American\r\ntroops in Europe for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division. Ray\r\nwas critical, not because Keeler had been particularly concerned with\r\nthe relatively high black crime rate and its effect on Europeans, but\r\nbecause the report overlooked the concentration of segregated black\r\nunits which had increased the density of Negroes in some areas of\r\nEurope to a point where records and reports of misconduct presented a\r\nfalse picture. In effect, black crime statistics were meaningless, Ray\r\nbelieved, as long as the Army's segregation policy remained intact.\r\nWhere Keeler implied that the solution was to exclude Negroes from\r\nEurope, Ray believed that the answer lay in desegregating and\r\nspreading them out.[8-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-12: Memo, Ray for ASW Petersen, 1 Nov 46,\r\n                   ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nIt was probably inevitable that all the publicity given racial\r\ntroubles would attract attention on Capitol Hill. When the Senate's\r\nSpecial Investigations Committee took up the question of military\r\ngovernment in occupied Europe in the fall of 1946, it decided to look\r\ninto the conduct of black soldiers also. Witnesses asserted that black\r\ntroops in Europe were ill-behaved and poorly disciplined and their (p. 212)\r\nofficers were afraid to punish them properly for fear of displeasing\r\nhigher authorities. The committee received a report on the occupation\r\nprepared by its chief counsel, George Meader. A curious amalgam of\r\nsensational hearsay, obvious racism, and unimpeachable fact, the\r\ndocument was leaked to the press and subsequently denounced publicly\r\nby the committee's chairman, Senator Harley M. Kilgore of West\r\nVirginia. Kilgore charged that parts of the report dealing with\r\nNegroes were obviously based on hearsay. \"Neither prejudice nor\r\nmalice,\" the senator concluded, \"has any place in factual\r\nreports.\"[8-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-13: U.S. Congress, Senate Special\r\n                   Committee Investigating National Defense Programs,\r\n                   Part 42, \"Military Government in Germany,\" 80th\r\n                   Cong., 22 November 1946, pp. 26150-89; see also New\r\n                   York _Times_, November 27 and December 4, 1946.

He\r\nwanted the committee to explore with the War Department possible\r\nsolutions to the problem of black troops overseas, and he called on\r\nthe War Department to give careful consideration to the\r\nrecommendations of its field commanders. The European commander was\r\nalready on record with a recommendation to recall all black troops\r\nfrom Europe, citing the absence of Negroes from the U.S. Occupation\r\nArmy in the Rhineland after World War I. Lt. Gen. Lucius D. Clay, then\r\nU.S. Commander, Berlin, who later succeeded General McNarney as\r\ntheater commander and military governor, wanted Negroes in the\r\noccupation army used primarily as parade troops. Meader contended that\r\nthe War Department was reluctant to act on these theater\r\nrecommendations because it feared political repercussions from the\r\nblack community. He had no such fear: \"certainly, the conduct of the\r\nnegro troops, as provable from War Department records, is no credit to\r\nthe negro race and proper action to solve the problem should not\r\nresult in any unfavorable reaction from any intelligent negro\r\nleaders.\"[8-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-14: Senate Special Committee, \"Military\r\n                   Government in Germany,\" 80th Cong., 22 Nov 1946,\r\n                   pp. 26163-64; see also Geis Monograph, pp. 142-43.]\r\n\r\nThe War Department was not insensitive to the opinions being aired on\r\nCapitol Hill. The under secretary, Kenneth C. Royall, had already\r\ndispatched a group from the Inspector General's office under Brig.\r\nGen. Elliot D. Cooke to find out among other things if black troops\r\nwere being properly disciplined and to investigate other charges Lt.\r\nCol. Francis P. Miller had made before the Special Investigations\r\nCommittee. Examining in detail the records of one subordinate European\r\ncommand, which had 12,000 Negroes in its force of 44,000, the Cooke\r\ngroup decided that commanders were not afraid to punish black\r\nsoldiers. Although Negroes were responsible for vehicle accidents and\r\ndisciplinary infractions in numbers disproportionate to their\r\nstrength, they also had a proportionately higher court-martial\r\nrate.[8-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-15: Geis Monograph, pp. 144-45; EUCOM\r\n                   Hist Div, _Morale and Discipline in the European\r\n                   Command, 1945-1949_, Occupation Forces in Europe\r\n                   Series, pp. 45-46, in CMH.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Cooke group was still studying the specific charges of the\r\nSenate's Investigations Committee, Secretary Patterson decided on a\r\ngeneral review of the situation. He ordered Ray to tour European\r\ninstallations and report on how the Gillem Board policy was being  (p. 213)\r\nput into effect overseas. Ray visited numerous bases and housing\r\nand recreation areas in Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, and\r\nAustria. He examined duties, living conditions, morale, and\r\ndiscipline. He also looked into race relations and community\r\nattitudes. His month's tour, ending on 17 December 1946, reinforced\r\nhis conviction that substandard troops--black and white--were at the\r\nheart of the Army's crime and venereal disease problem. Ray supported\r\nthe efforts of local commanders to discharge these men, although he\r\nwanted the secretary to reform and standardize the method of\r\ndischarge. In his analysis of the overseas situation, the civilian\r\naide avoided any specific allusion to the nexus between segregation\r\nand racial unrest. In a rare burst of idealism, however, he did\r\ncondemn those who would exclude Negroes from combat units and certain\r\noccupations because of presumed prejudices on the part of the German\r\npopulation. To bow to such prejudices, he insisted, was to negate\r\nAmerica's aspirations for the postwar world. In essence, Ray's formula\r\nfor good race relations was quite simple: institute immediately the\r\nreforms outlined in the Gillem Board Report.\r\n\r\nIn addition to broader use of black troops, Ray was concerned with\r\nbasic racial attitudes. The Army, he charged, generally failed to see\r\nthe connection between prejudice and national security; many of its\r\nleaders even denied that prejudice existed in the Army. Yet to ignore\r\nthe problem of racial prejudice, he claimed, condemned the Army to\r\nperpetual racial upsets. He wanted the secretary to restate the Army's\r\nracial objectives and launch an information and education program to\r\ninform commanders and troops on racial matters.[8-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-16: Ray, \"Rpt to SecWar, Mr. Robert P.\r\n                   Patterson, of Tour of European Installations,\" 17\r\n                   Dec 46, Incl to Memo, SW for DCofS, 7 Jan 47, SW\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nIn all other respects a lucid progress report on the Gillem Board\r\npolicy, Ray's analysis was weakened by his failure to point out the\r\neffect of segregation on the performance and attitude of black\r\nsoldiers. Ray believed that the Gillem Board policy, with its quota\r\nsystem and its provisions for the integration of black specialists,\r\nwould eventually lead to an integrated Army. Preoccupied with\r\npractical and imminently possible racial reforms, Ray, along with\r\nSecretary Patterson and other reformers within the Army establishment,\r\ntended to overlook the tenacious hold that racial segregation had on\r\nArmy thought.\r\n\r\nThis hold was clearly illustrated by the reaction of the Army staff to\r\nRay's recommendations. Speaking with the concurrence of the other\r\nstaff elements and the approval of the Deputy Chief of Staff, General\r\nPaul warned that very little could be accomplished toward the\r\nlong-range objective of the Gillem Board--integration--until the Army\r\ncompleted the long and complex task of raising the quality and\r\nlowering the quantity of black soldiers. He also considered it\r\nimpractical to use Negroes in overhead positions, combat units, and\r\nhighly technical and professional positions in exact proportion to\r\ntheir percentage of the population. Such use, Paul claimed, would\r\nexpend travel funds already drastically curtailed and further\r\ncomplicate a serious housing situation. He admitted that the\r\ndeep-seated prejudice of some Army members in all grades would     (p. 214)\r\nhave a direct bearing on the progress of the Army's new racial\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24TH INFANTRY BAND, GIFU, JAPAN, 1947.]\r\n\r\nThe staff generally agreed with Ray's other recommendations with one\r\nexception: it opposed his suggestion that black units be used in the\r\nEuropean theater's constabulary, the specially organized and trained\r\nforce that patrolled the East-West border and helped police the German\r\noccupation. The theater commander had so few capable Negroes, Paul\r\nreasoned, that to siphon off enough to form a constabulary unit would\r\nthreaten the efficiency of other black units. Besides, even if enough\r\nqualified Negroes were available, he believed their use in supervisory\r\npositions over German nationals would be unacceptable to many\r\nGermans.[8-17] The staff offered no evidence for this latter argument,\r\nand indeed there was none available. In marked contrast to their\r\nreaction to the French government's quartering of Senegalese soldiers\r\nin the Rhineland after World War I, the German attitude toward\r\nAmerican Negroes immediately after World War II was notably tolerant,\r\na factor in the popularity among Negroes of assignments to Europe. It\r\nwas only later that the Germans, especially tavern owners and the  (p. 215)\r\nlike, began to adopt the discriminatory practices of their\r\nconquerors.[8-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-17: WDGPA Summary Sheet, 25 Jan 47, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negroes in the European Theater,\r\n                   with Incls, WDGPA 291.2 (7 Jan 47).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-18: Interv, author with Lt Gen Clarence\r\n                   R. Huebner (former CG, U.S. Army, Europe), 31 Mar\r\n                   71, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nRay's proposals and the reaction to them formed a kind of watershed in\r\nthe War Department's postwar racial policy. Just ten months after the\r\nGillem Board Report was published, the Army staff made a judgment on\r\nthe policy's effectiveness: the presence of Negroes in numbers\r\napproximating 10 percent of the Army's strength and at the current\r\nqualitative level made it necessary to retain segregation\r\nindefinitely. Segregation kept possible troublemakers out of important\r\ncombat divisions, promoted efficiency, and placated regional\r\nprejudices both in the Army and Congress. Integration must be\r\npostponed until the number of Negroes in the Army was carefully\r\nregulated and the quality of black troops improved. Both, the staff\r\nthought, were goals of a future so distant that segregated units were\r\nnot threatened.\r\n\r\nBut the staff's views ran contrary to the Gillem Board policy and the\r\npublic utterances of the Secretary of War. Robert Patterson had\r\nconsistently supported the policy in public and before his advisers.\r\nBesides, it was unthinkable that he would so quickly abandon a policy\r\ndeveloped at the cost of so much effort and negotiation and announced\r\nwith such fanfare. He had insisted that the quota be maintained, most\r\nrecently in the case of the European Command.[8-19] In sum, he believed\r\nthat the policy provided guidelines, practical and expedient, albeit\r\ntemporary, that would lead to the integration of the Army.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-19: Geis Monograph, pp. 143-44.]\r\n\r\nIn face of this impasse between the secretary and the Army staff there\r\nslowly evolved what proved to be a new racial policy. Never clearly\r\nformulated--Circular 124 continued in effect with only minor changes\r\nuntil 1950--the new policy was based on the substantially different\r\nproposition that segregation would continue indefinitely while the\r\nstaff concentrated on weeding out poorly qualified Negroes, upgrading\r\nthe rest, and removing vestiges of discrimination, which it saw as\r\nquite distinct from segregation. At the same time the Army would\r\ncontinue to operate under a strict 10 percent quota of Negroes, though\r\nnot necessarily within every occupation or specialty. The staff\r\noverlooked the increasingly evident connection between segregation and\r\nracial unrest, thereby assuring the continuation of both. From 1947\r\non, integration, the stated goal of the Gillem Board policy, was\r\nignored, while segregation, which the board saw as an expedient to be\r\ntolerated, became for the Army staff a way of life to be treasured. It\r\nwas from this period in 1947 that Circular 124 and the Gillem Board\r\nReport began to gain their reputations as regressive documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Improving the Status of the Segregated Soldier_\r\n\r\nIn 1947 the Army accelerated its long-range program to discharge\r\nsoldiers who scored less than seventy on the Army General\r\nClassification Test. Often a subject of public controversy, the\r\nprogram formed a major part of the Army's effort to close the      (p. 216)\r\neducational and training gap between black and white troops.[8-20]\r\nOf course, there were other ways to close the gap, and on occasion the\r\nArmy had taken the more positive and difficult approach of upgrading\r\nits substandard black troops by giving them extra training. Although\r\nrarely so recognized, the Army's long record of providing remedial\r\nacademic and technical training easily qualified it as one of the\r\nnation's major social engineers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-20: For the use of AR 315-369 to\r\n                   discharge low-scoring soldiers, see Chapter 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL HUEBNER _inspects the 529th Military Police\r\nCompany, Giessen, Germany, 1948_.]\r\n\r\nIn World War II thousands of draftees were taught to read and write in\r\nthe Army's literacy program. In 1946 at Fort Benning an on-duty\r\neducational program was organized in the 25th Regimental Combat Team\r\nfor soldiers, in this case all Negroes, with less than an eighth grade\r\neducation. Although the project had to be curtailed because of a lack\r\nof specialized instructors, an even more ambitious program was\r\nlaunched the next year throughout the Army after a survey revealed an\r\nalarming illiteracy rate in replacement troops. In a move of primary\r\nimportance to black recruits, the Far East Command, for example,\r\nordered all soldiers lacking the equivalent of a fifth grade education\r\nto attend courses. The order was later changed to include all soldiers\r\nwho failed to achieve Army test scores of seventy.[8-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-21: AFPAC Monograph, 4:193.]\r\n\r\nIn 1947 the European theater launched the most ambitious project by\r\nfar for improving the status of black troops, and before it was over\r\nthousands of black soldiers had been examined, counseled, and trained.\r\nThe project was conceived and executed by the deputy and later theater\r\ncommander, Lt. Gen. Clarence R. Huebner, and his adviser on Negro\r\naffairs, Marcus Ray, now a lieutenant colonel.[8-22] These men were\r\nconvinced that a program could be devised to raise the status of the\r\nblack soldier. Huebner wanted to lay the foundation for a command-wide\r\neducational program for all black units. \"If you're going to make\r\nsoldiers out of people,\" he later explained, \"they have the right to\r\nbe trained.\" Huebner had specialized in training in his Army career,\r\nhad written several of the Army's training manuals, and possessed an\r\nabiding faith in the ability of the Army to change men. \"If your   (p. 217)\r\nsoldiers don't know how, teach them.\"[8-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-22: At the suggestion of Secretary\r\n                   Patterson, General Huebner established the position\r\n                   of Negro adviser. After several candidates were\r\n                   considered, the post went to Marcus Ray, who left\r\n                   the secretary's office and went on active duty.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-23: Interv, author with Huebner.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Huebner got his chance in March 1947 when the command decided\r\nto use some 3,000 unassigned black troops in guard duties formerly\r\nperformed by the 1st Infantry Division. The men were organized into\r\ntwo infantry battalions,[8-24] but because of their low test scores\r\nHuebner decided to establish a twelve-to thirteen-week training\r\nprogram at the Grafenwohr Training Center and directed the commanding\r\ngeneral of the 1st Division to train black soldiers in both basic\r\nmilitary and academic subjects. Huebner concluded his directive by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n     This is our first opportunity to put into effect in a large way\r\n     the War Department policy on Negro soldiers as announced in War\r\n     Department Circular No. 124, 1946. Owing to the necessity for\r\n     rapid training, and to the press of occupational duties, little\r\n     time has been available in the past for developing the leadership\r\n     of the Negro soldier. We can now do that.... I wish you to study\r\n     the program, its progress, its deficiencies and its advantages,\r\n     in order that a full report may be compiled and lessons in\r\n     operation and training drawn.[8-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-24: The 370th and 371st Infantry\r\n                   Battalions (Separate) were organized on 20 June\r\n                   1947.

They prompted Huebner on 1\r\nDecember 1947 to establish a permanent training center at Kitzingen\r\nAir Base.[8-26] Essentially, he was trying to combine both drill and\r\nconstant supervision with a broad-based educational program. Trainees\r\nreceived basic military training for six hours daily and academic\r\ninstruction up to the twelfth grade level for two hours more. The\r\ncommand ordered all black replacements and casuals arriving from the\r\nUnited States to the training center for classifying and training as\r\nrequired. Eventually all black units in Europe were to be rotated\r\nthrough Kitzingen for unit refresher and individual instruction. As\r\neach company completed the course at Kitzingen, the command assigned\r\nacademic instructors to continue an on-duty educational program in the\r\nfield. A soldier was required to participate in the educational\r\nprogram until he passed the general education development test for\r\nhigh school level or until he clearly demonstrated that he could not\r\nprofit from further instruction.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-26: The training center had already moved\r\n                   from Grafenwohr to larger quarters at Mannheim\r\n                   Koafestal, Germany.]\r\n\r\nWashington was quick to perceive the merit of the European program,\r\nand Paul reported widespread approval \"from all concerned.\"[8-27] The\r\nprogram quickly produced some impressive statistics. Thousands of  (p. 218)\r\nsoldiers--at the peak in 1950 more than 62 percent of all Negroes in\r\nthe command--were enrolled in the military training course at\r\nKitzingen or in on-duty educational programs organized in over\r\ntwo-thirds of the black companies throughout the command. By June 1950\r\nthe program had over 2,900 students and 200 instructors. A year later,\r\nthe European commander estimated that since the program began some\r\n1,169 Negroes had completed fifth grade in his schools, 2,150 had\r\nfinished grade school, and 418 had passed the high school equivalency\r\ntest.[8-28] The experiment had a practical and long-lasting effect on\r\nthe Army. For example, in 1950 a sampling of three black units showed\r\nthat after undergoing training at Kitzingen and in their own units the\r\nmen scored an average of twenty points higher in Army classification\r\ntests. According to a 1950 European Command estimate, the command's\r\neducation program was producing some of the finest trained black\r\ntroops in the Army.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-27: Ltr, D/P&A to Huebner, 15 Oct 47,\r\n                   CSGPA 291.2. This approval did not extend to all\r\n                   civil rights advocates, some of whom objected to\r\n                   the segregated training. Walter White, however,\r\n                   supported the program. See Interv, author with\r\n                   Huebner.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-28: EUCOM Hist Div, _EUCOM Command\r\n                   Report, 1951_, pp. 128, 251, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPORTING TO KITZINGEN. _Men of Company B, 371st\r\nInfantry Battalion, arrive for refresher course in basic military\r\ntraining._]\r\n\r\nThe training program even provoked jealous reaction among some white\r\ntroops who claimed that the educational opportunities offered Negroes\r\ndiscriminated against them. They were right, for in comparison to the\r\non-duty high school courses offered Negroes, the command restricted\r\ncourses for white soldiers to so-called literacy training or\r\ncompletion of the fifth grade. Command spokesmen quite openly\r\njustified the disparity on the grounds that Negroes on the whole   (p. 219)\r\nhad received fewer educational opportunities in the United States and\r\nthat the program would promote efficiency in the command.[8-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-29: Ltr, Chief, EUCOM TI&E Div, to EUCOM\r\n                   DCSOPS, 18 Jun 48, cited in Geis Monograph, p.\r\n                   130.]\r\n\r\nWhether a connection can be made between the Kitzingen training\r\nprogram and improvement in the morale and discipline of black troops,\r\nthe fact was that by January 1950 a dramatic change had occurred in\r\nthe conduct of black soldiers in the European Command. The rate of\r\nvenereal disease among black soldiers had dropped to an average\r\napproximating the rate for white troops (and not much greater than the\r\nalways lower average for troops in the United States). This phenomenon\r\nwas repeated in the serious incident rate. In the first half of 1950\r\ncourts-martial that resulted in bad conduct discharges totaled\r\nfifty-nine for Negroes, a figure that compared well with the 324\r\nsimilar verdicts for the larger contingent of white soldiers.[8-30] For\r\nonce the Army could document what it had always preached, that\r\neducation and training were the keys to the better performance of\r\nblack troops. The tragedy was that the education program was never\r\napplied throughout the Army, not even in the Far East and in the\r\nUnited States, where far more black soldiers were stationed than in\r\nEurope.[8-31] The Army lost yet another chance to fulfill the promise of\r\nits postwar policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-30: Geis Monograph, Charts 3 and 4 and p.\r\n                   139.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-31: Not comparable was the brief literacy\r\n                   program reinstituted in the 25th Regimental Combat\r\n                   Team at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1947.]\r\n\r\nIn later years Kitzingen assumed the task of training black officers,\r\na natural progression considering the attitude of General Huebner and\r\nMarcus Ray. The general and the command adviser were convinced that\r\nthe status of black soldiers depended at least in part on the caliber\r\nof black officers commanding them. Huebner deftly made this point in\r\nOctober 1947 soon after Kitzingen opened when he explained to General\r\nPaul that he wanted more \"stable, efficient, and interested Negro\r\nofficers and senior non-commissioned officers\" who, he believed, would\r\nset an example for the trainees.[8-32] Others shared Huebner's views.\r\nThe black publishers touring Europe some months later observed that\r\nwherever black officers were assigned there was \"a noticeable\r\nimprovement in the morale, discipline and general efficiency of the\r\nunits involved.\"[8-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-32: Ltr, Huebner to D/P&A, 1 Oct 47,\r\n                   CSGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-33: Memo, DCofS for D/P&A, 14 May 48,\r\n                   sub: Report of Visit by Negro Publishers and\r\n                   Editors to the European Theater, CSUSA 291.2\r\n                   Negroes (14 May 48).]\r\n\r\nThe European Command had requisitioned only five black officers during\r\nthe last eight months, General Paul noted; this might have caused its\r\nshortage of black officers. Still, Paul knew the problem went deeper,\r\nand he admitted that many black officers now on duty were relatively\r\nundesirable and many desirable ones were being declared surplus. He\r\nwas searching for a solution.[8-34] The Personnel and Administration\r\nDivision could do very little about the major cause of the shortage,\r\nfor the lack of black officers was fundamentally connected with the\r\npostwar demobilization affecting all the services. Most black officers\r\nwere unable to compete in terms of length of service, combat experience,\r\nand other factors that counted heavily toward retention.           (p. 220)\r\nConsequently their numbers dropped sharply from an August 1945 high of\r\n7,748 to a December 1947 low of 1,184. The drop more than offset the\r\nslight rise in the black percentage of the whole officer corps, .8\r\npercent in 1945 to 1.0 percent in 1947.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-34: Ltr, D/P&A to Huebner, 15 Oct 47,\r\n                   CSGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\nAt first General Paul was rather passive in his attitude toward the\r\nshortage of black officers. Commenting on Assistant Secretary of War\r\nPetersen's suggestion in May 1946 that the Army institute a special\r\nrecruitment program to supplement the small number of black officers\r\nwho survived the competition for Regular Army appointments, Paul noted\r\nthat all appointments were based on merit and competition and\r\nthat special consideration for Negroes was itself a form of\r\ndiscrimination.[8-35] Whether through fear of being accused of\r\ndiscrimination against whites or because of the general curtailment of\r\nofficer billets, it was not until April 1948 that the Personnel and\r\nAdministration Division launched a major effort to get more black\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-35: Memo, ASW for D/P&A, 23 May 46, sub:\r\n                   Negro Officers in the Regular Establishment; Memo,\r\n                   D/P&A for ASW, 29 May 46, same sub; Memo, \"D.

Copies of all in ASW 291.2 (23\r\n                   May 46).]\r\n\r\nIn April 1948 General Paul had his Manpower Control Group review the\r\nofficer strength of seventy-eight black units stationed in the United\r\nStates. The group uncovered a shortage of seventy-two officers in the\r\nseventy-eight units, but it went considerably beyond identifying\r\nsimple shortages. In estimating the number of black officers needed,\r\nthe group demonstrated not only how far the Gillem Board policy had\r\ncommitted the Army, but in view of contemporary manpower shortages\r\njust how impossible this commitment was of being fulfilled. The\r\nmanpower group discovered that according to Circular 124, which\r\nprescribed more officers for units containing a preponderance of men\r\nwith low test scores, the seventy-eight units should have 187\r\nadditional officers beyond their regular allotment. Also taking into\r\naccount Circular 124's provision that black officers should command\r\nblack troops, the group discovered that these units would need another\r\n477 black officer replacements. The group temporized. It recommended\r\nthat the additional officers be assigned to units in which 70 percent\r\nor more of the men were in grades IV and V and without mentioning\r\nspecific numbers noted that high priority be given to the replacement\r\nof white officers with Negroes. Assuming the shortages discovered in\r\nthe seventy-eight units would be mirrored in the 315 black units\r\noverseas as well as other temporary units at home, the group also\r\nwanted General Paul to order a comprehensive survey of all black\r\nunits.[8-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-36: Memo, Chief, Manpower Survey Gp, for\r\n                   Paul, 29 Apr 48, sub: Assignment of Officers of\r\n                   Negro T/O&E Units in Compliance with WD Cir 124,\r\n                   1946, CSGPA 210.31 (29 Apr 48); \"Report on Negro\r\n                   Officer Strength in Army,\" incl w/Memo, D/P&A for\r\n                   DCofS, 21 Jun 48, sub: Report of Negro Publishers\r\n                   and Editors on Tour of European Installations,\r\n                   CSUSA 291.2 Negroes (14 May 48).]\r\n\r\nPaul complied with the group's request by ordering the major\r\ncommanders in May to list the number of officers by branch, grade, and\r\nspecialty needed to fill the vacant spaces in their black units.[8-37]\r\nBut there was really little need for further surveys because the   (p. 221)\r\nkey to all the group's recommendations--the availability of suitable\r\nblack officers--was beyond the immediate reach of the Army. General\r\nPaul was able to fill the existing vacancies in the seventy-eight\r\ncontinental units by recalling black officers from inactive duty, but\r\nthe number eligible for recall or available from other sources was\r\nlimited. As of 31 May 1948, personnel officials could count on only\r\n2,794 black reserve and National Guard officers who could be assigned\r\nto extended active duty. This number was far short of current needs;\r\nNegroes would have to approximate 4.1 percent (3,000 officers) of the\r\nArmy's officer corps if all the whites in black units were replaced.\r\nAs for the other provisions of the Gillem Board, the Organization and\r\nTraining Division urged restraint, arguing that Circular 124 was not\r\nan authorization for officers in excess of organization table\r\nceilings, but rather that the presence of many low-scoring men\r\nconstituted a basis for requesting more officers.[8-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-37: Memo, D/P&A for TAG, 24 May 48, sub:\r\n                   Negro Officers in TO&E Units, CSGPA 291.2 (24 May\r\n                   48).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-38: Ibid.; \"Report on Negro Officer\r\n                   Strength in Army,\" incl w/Memo, D/P&A for DCofS, 21\r\n                   Jun 48, sub: Report of Negro Publishers and\r\n                   Editors..., CSUSA 291.2 Negroes (14 May 48).]\r\n\r\nGeneral Paul did not argue the point. Admitting that the 4.1 percent\r\nfigure was \"an objective to be achieved over a period of time,\" he\r\ncould do little but instruct the commanders concerned to indicate in\r\nfuture requisitions that they wanted black officers as fillers or\r\nreplacements in black units. Clearly, as long as the number of black\r\nofficers remained so low, the provisions of Circular 124 calling for\r\nblack officers to replace whites or supplement the officer strength of\r\nunits containing men with low test scores would have to be ignored.\r\n\r\nThere were other long-range possibilities for procuring more black\r\nofficers, the most obvious the expansion of the Reserve Officers'\r\nTraining Corps. As of January 1948 the Army had ROTC units at nine\r\npredominantly black colleges and universities with a total enrollment\r\nof 3,035 cadets. The Organization and Training Division contemplated\r\nadding one more unit during 1948, but after negotiations with\r\nofficials from Secretary Royall's office, themselves under\r\nconsiderable congressional and public pressure, the division added\r\nthree more advanced ROTC units, one service and two combat, at\r\npredominantly black institutions.[8-39] At the same time some hope\r\nexisted for increasing the number of black cadets at West Point. The\r\nacademy had nine black cadets in 1948, including five plebes. General\r\nPaul hoped that the graduation of these cadets would stimulate further\r\ninterest and a corresponding increase in applications from\r\nNegroes.[8-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-39: Memo, Asst Secy, GS, for DCofS, 2 Jun\r\n                   48, sub: Negro ROTC Units, CSUSA 291.2 Negroes (2\r\n                   Jun 48); see also Department of National Defense,\r\n                   \"National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs,\" 26\r\n                   Apr 48, morning session, pp. 31-34, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-40: \"Report on Negro Officer Strength in\r\n                   Army,\" incl w/Memo, D/P&A for DCofS, 21 Jun 48,\r\n                   sub: Report of Negro Publishers and Editors...,\r\n                   CSUSA 291.2 Negroes (14 May 48).]\r\n\r\nIt was probably naive to assume that an increase of black cadets from\r\nfour to nine would stir much interest when other statistics suggested\r\nthat black officers had a limited future in the service. As Secretary\r\nRoyall pointed out, even if the total number of black officers could\r\nnot be quickly increased, the percentage of black officers in the  (p. 222)\r\nRegular Army could.[8-41] Yet by April 1948 the Army had almost\r\ncompleted the conversion of reservists into regulars, and few black\r\nofficers had been selected. In June 1945, for example, there were 8\r\nblack officers in the Regular Army; by April 1948 they numbered only\r\n41, including 4 West Point graduates and 32 converted reservists.[8-42]\r\nThe Army had also recently nominated 13 young Negroes, designated\r\nDistinguished Military Graduates of the advanced ROTC program, for\r\nRegular Army commissions.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-41: Department of National Defense,\r\n                   \"National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs,\" 26\r\n                   Apr 48, morning session, pp. 20-21. Prior to World\r\n                   War II, an officer held a commission in the Regular\r\n                   Army, in the Army Reserve, or in the National\r\n                   Guard. Another type of commission, one in the Army\r\n                   of the United States (AUS), was added during World\r\n                   War II, and all temporary promotions granted during\r\n                   the war were to AUS rank. For example, a Regular\r\n                   Army captain could become an AUS major but would\r\n                   retain his Regular Army captaincy. Many reservists\r\n                   and some National Guard officers remaining on\r\n                   active duty sought conversion to, or \"integration\"\r\n                   into, the Regular Army for career security.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-42: These black officers were converted\r\n                   to Regular Army officers in the following arms and\r\n                   services: Infantry, 13; Chaplain Corps, 9; Medical\r\n                   Service Corps, 1; Army Nurse Corps, 1; Field\r\n                   Artillery, 1; Quartermaster, 7 (4 of whom were\r\n                   transferred later to the Transportation Corps).\r\n                   These figures include the first black doctor and\r\n                   nurse converted to Regular Army officers.]\r\n\r\nDuring the Regular Army integration program, 927 Negroes and 122,520\r\nwhites applied for the Regular Army; the Army and the Air Force\r\nawarded commissions to 27,798 white officers (22.7 percent of those\r\napplying) and 96 black officers (10.3 percent of the applicants).\r\nPreliminary rejections based on efficiency and education ran close to\r\n40 percent of the applicants of both races. The disparity in\r\nrejections by race appeared when applicants went before the Selection\r\nBoard itself; only 18.55 percent of the remaining black applicants\r\nwere accepted while 39.35 percent of the white applicants were\r\nselected for Regular Army commissions.[8-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-43: \"Analysis of Negro Officers in the\r\n                   Army,\" incl w/Memo, D/P&A for DCAS, 21 Jun 48, sub:\r\n                   Report of Negro Publishers and Editors..., CSUSA\r\n                   291.2 Negroes (14 May 48).]\r\n\r\nGiven statistics like these, it was difficult to stimulate black\r\ninterest in a career as an Army officer, as General Paul was well\r\naware. He had the distribution of black officers appointed to the\r\nRegular Army studied in 1947 to see if it was in consonance with the\r\nnew racial policy. While most of the arms and services passed muster\r\nwith the Personnel and Administration Division, Paul felt compelled to\r\nremind the Chief of Engineers, whose corps had so far awarded no\r\nRegular Army commission to the admittedly limited number of black\r\napplicants, that officers were to be accepted in the Regular Army\r\nwithout regard to race. He repeated this warning to the Quartermaster\r\nGeneral and the Chief of Transportation; both had accepted black\r\nofficers for the Regular Army but had selected only the smallest\r\nfraction of those applying. Although the black applicants did score\r\nslightly below the whites, Paul doubted that integration would lower\r\nthe standards of quality in these branches, and he wanted every effort\r\nmade to increase the number of black officers.[8-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-44: DF, D/P&A to Chief of Engrs, 25 Jul\r\n                   47, sub: Appointment of Negro Officers to the\r\n                   Regular Army, w/attached Memo for Rcd, WDGPA 291.2\r\n                   (23 Jul 47).]\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Engineers, quick to defend his record, explained that the\r\nrace of candidates was difficult to ascertain and had not been\r\nconsidered in the selection process. Nevertheless, he had reexamined\r\nall rejected applications and found two from Negroes whose         (p. 223)\r\ncomposite scores were acceptable. Both men, however, fell so short of\r\nmeeting the minimum professional requirements that to appoint either\r\nwould be to accord preferential treatment denied to hundreds of other\r\nunderqualified applicants.[8-45] It would appear that bias and prejudice\r\nwere not the only governing factors in the shortage of black officers,\r\nbut rather that in some ways at least Circular 124 was making\r\nimpossible demands on the Army's personnel system.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-45: DF, Chief of Engrs to D/P&A, 1 Aug\r\n                   47, sub: Appointment of Negro Officers to the\r\n                   Regular Army, copy in WPGPA 291.2 (23 Jul 47).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discrimination and the Postwar Army_\r\n\r\nTraining black soldiers and trying to provide them with black officers\r\nwas a practical move demanded by the Army's new race policy. At the\r\nsame time, often with reluctance and only after considerable pressure\r\nhad been brought to bear, the Army also began to attack certain\r\npractices that discriminated against the black soldier. One was the\r\narbitrary location of training camps after the war. In November 1946,\r\nfor example, the Army Ground Forces reorganized its training centers\r\nfor the Army, placing them at six installations: Fort Dix, New Jersey;\r\nFort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Jackson, South\r\nCarolina; Fort Lewis, Washington, and Fort Ord, California. White\r\nenlisted and reenlisted men were sent to the training centers within\r\nthe geographical limits of the Army area of their enlistment. Because\r\nit was impossible for the Army Ground Forces to maintain separate\r\nblack training cadres of battalion size at each of the six centers,\r\nall Negroes, except those slated for service in the Army Air Forces,\r\nwere sent to Fort Jackson.[8-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-46: WD Memo 615-500-4, 21 Nov 46, sub:\r\n                   Flow of Enlisted Personnel From Induction Centers\r\n                   and Central Examining Stations.]\r\n\r\nThe Gillem Board had called for the assignment of Negroes to\r\nlocalities where community attitudes were favorable, and Marcus Ray\r\nprotested the Ground Forces action. \"It is in effect a restatement of\r\npolicy and ... has implications which will affect adversely the\r\nrelationship of the Army and our Negro manpower potential.... I am\r\ncertain that this ruling will have the immediate effect of\r\ncrystallizing Negro objections to the enlistment of qualified men and\r\nalso Universal Military Training.\"[8-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-47: Memo, Marcus Ray for ASW, 23 Jan 47,\r\n                   ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nRay reminded Assistant Secretary of War Petersen that the Fort Jackson\r\narea had been the scene of many racial disturbances since 1941 and\r\nthat an increase in the black troop population would only intensify\r\nthe hostile community attitude. He wanted to substitute Fort Dix and\r\nFort Ord for Fort Jackson. He also had another suggestion: Why not\r\nassign black training companies to white battalions, especially in\r\nthose training centers that drew their populations from northern,\r\neastern, and western communities?\r\n\r\nPetersen ignored for the time being Ray's suggestion for composite\r\ntraining groups, but he readily agreed on training black soldiers at\r\nmore congenial posts, particularly after Ray's views were aired in the\r\nblack press. Petersen also urged the Deputy Chief of Staff to      (p. 224)\r\ncoordinate staff actions with Ray whenever instructions dealing\r\nwith race relations in the Army were being prepared.[8-48] At the same\r\ntime, Secretary of War Patterson assured Walter White of the NAACP,\r\nwho had also protested sending Negroes to Fort Jackson, that the\r\nmatter was under study.[8-49] Within a matter of months Negroes entering\r\nthe Army from civilian life were receiving their training at Fort Dix\r\nand Fort Ord.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-48: Memo, ASW for DCofS, 7 Feb 47, ASW\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-49: Ltr, SW Robert P. Patterson to Walter\r\n                   White, 7 Feb 47, SW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nTurning its back on the overt racism of some southern communities, the\r\nArmy unwittingly exposed an example of racism in the west. The plan to\r\ntrain Negroes at Fort Ord aroused the combined opposition of the\r\ncitizens around Monterey Bay, who complained to Senator William F.\r\nKnowland that theirs was a tourist area unable to absorb thousands of\r\nblack trainees \"without serious threat of racial conflict.\" The Army\r\nreacted with forthright resistance. Negroes would be trained at Fort\r\nOrd, and the Secretary of the Army would be glad to explain the\r\nsituation and cooperate with the local citizenry.[8-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-50: Telg, Hugh F.

While the staff agreed that orders\r\ninvolving travel between reception centers and training organizations\r\nneed not designate race, it convinced the secretary that to abolish\r\nsuch designations on other orders, including overseas assignment\r\ndocuments, would adversely affect strength and accounting procedures\r\nas well as overseas replacement systems.[8-53] The modest reform\r\ncontinued in effect until the question of racial designation became a\r\nmajor issue in the 1960's.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-51: AG Memo for Office of SW et al., 10\r\n                   Jan 47, sub: Designation of Race on Overseas Travel\r\n                   Orders, AGAO-C 291.2 (6 Jan 47), WDGSP; Memo for\r\n                   Rcd attached to Memo, D/SSP for TAG, 6 Jan 47, same\r\n                   sub, AG 291.2 (6 Jan 47).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-52: Memo, SA for CofSA, 2 Apr 52, sub:\r\n                   Racial Designations on Travel Orders, CS 291.2 (2\r\n                   Apr 51).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-53: G-1 Summary Sheet, 26 Apr 52, sub:\r\n                   Racial Designations on Travel Orders; Memo, CofS\r\n                   for SA, 5 May 51, same sub; both in CS 291.2 (2 Apr\r\n                   51).]\r\n\r\nNot all the reforms that followed the Gillem Board's deliberations\r\nwere so quickly adopted. For in truth the Army was not the monolithic\r\ninstitution so often depicted by its critics, and its racial\r\ndirectives usually came out of compromises between the progressive and\r\ntraditional factions of the staff. The integration of the national\r\ncemeteries, an emotion-laden issue in 1947, amply demonstrated that\r\nsharp differences of opinion existed within the department. Although\r\nlong-standing regulations provided for segregation by rank only, local\r\ncustom, and in one case--the Long Island National Cemetery--a 1935\r\norder by Secretary of War George H. Dern, dictated racial          (p. 225)\r\nsegregation in most of the cemeteries. The Quartermaster General\r\nreviewed the practice in 1946 and recommended a new policy\r\nspecifically opening new sections of all national cemeteries to\r\neligible citizens of all races. He would leave undisturbed segregated\r\ngrave sites in the older sections of the cemeteries because\r\nintegration would \"constitute a breach of faith with the next of kin\r\nof those now interred.\"[8-54] As might be expected, General Paul\r\nsupported the quartermaster suggestion, as did the commander of the\r\nArmy Ground Forces. The Army Air Forces commander, on the other hand,\r\nopposed integrating the cemeteries, as did the Chief of Staff, who on\r\n22 February 1947 rejected the proposal. The existing policy was\r\nreconfirmed by the Under Secretary of War three days later, and there\r\nthe matter rested.[8-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-54: Memo, QMG for DCofS, 15 Apr 47,\r\n                   CSUSA, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-55: WDSP Summary Sheet, 22 Jan 47, sub:\r\n                   Staff Study--Segregation of Grave Sites, WDGSP/C3\r\n                   1894.]\r\n\r\nNot for long, for civil rights spokesmen and the black press soon\r\nprotested. The NAACP confessed itself \"astonished\" at the Army's\r\ndecision and demanded that Secretary Patterson change a practice that\r\nwas both \"un-American and un-democratic.\"[8-56] Marcus Ray predicted\r\nthat continuing agitation would require further Army action, and he\r\nreminded Under Secretary Royall that cemeteries under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Navy, Veterans Administration, and Department of the Interior\r\nhad been integrated with considerable publicity. He urged adoption of\r\nthe Quartermaster General's recommendation.[8-57] That was enough for\r\nSecretary Patterson. On 15 April he directed that the new sections of\r\nnational cemeteries be integrated.[8-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-56: Telg, Secy Veterans Affairs, NAACP,\r\n                   to SW, attached to Memo, SW for DCofS, 11 Apr 47,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-57: Memo, Civilian Aide for USW, 15 Mar\r\n                   47, sub: Segregation in Grave Site Assignment, copy\r\n                   in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-58: Memo, SW for DCofS, 15 Apr 47, copy\r\n                   in CMH.

Five months after the secretary's\r\ndirective, the American Legion protested to the Secretary of War over\r\nsegregation at the Fort Snelling National Cemetery, Minnesota, and in\r\nAugust 1950 the Governor's Interracial Commission of the State of\r\nMinnesota carried the matter to the President, calling the policy \"a\r\nflagrant disregard of human dignity.\"[8-59] The Army continued to\r\njustify segregation as a temporary and limited measure involving the\r\nold sections, but a decade after the directive the commander of the\r\nAtlanta Depot was still referring to segregation in some\r\ncemeteries.[8-60] The controversial practice would drag on into the next\r\ndecade before the Department of Defense finally ruled that there would\r\nbe no lines drawn by rank or race in national cemeteries.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-59: Ltr, Royall to Rep.

While it stressed the reforms projected in\r\nthe Army's policy, including eventual integration, it also clearly\r\ndefended the Army's continued insistence on segregation on the grounds\r\nthat segregation promoted interracial harmony. The official position\r\nof the service was baldly stated. \"The Army is not an instrument of\r\nsocial reform. Its interest in matters of race is confined to\r\nconsiderations of its own effectiveness.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-61: Memo, D/P&A for CofS, 26 Feb 47, sub:\r\n                   Army Talks on \"Utilization of Negro Manpower,\"\r\n                   WDGPA 291.2 (7 Jan 47).]\r\n\r\nEven before publication the pamphlet provoked considerable discussion\r\nand soul-searching in the Army staff. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Lt.\r\nGen. Thomas T. Handy, questioned some of the Information and Education\r\nDivision's claims for black combatants. In the end the matter had to\r\nbe taken to General Eisenhower for resolution. He ordered publication,\r\nreminding local commanders that if necessary they should add further\r\ninstructions of their own, \"in keeping with the local situation\" to\r\ninsure acceptance of the Army's policy. The pamphlet was not to be\r\nconsidered an end in itself, he added, but only one element in a\r\n\"progressive process toward maximum utilization of manpower in the\r\nArmy.\"[8-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-62: WD Cir 76, 22 Mar 47; see also Ltrs,\r\n                   Col David Lane (author of _Army Talk 170_) to\r\n                   Martin Blumenson, 29 Dec 66, and to author, 15 Mar\r\n                   71, CMH files.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Segregation in Theory and Practice_\r\n\r\nEfforts to carry out the policy set forth in Circular 124 reached a\r\nhigh-water mark in mid-1948. By then black troops, for so long limited\r\nto a few job categories, could be found in a majority of military\r\noccupational fields. The officer corps was open to all without the\r\nrestrictions of a racial quota, and while a quota for enlisted men\r\nstill existed all racial distinctions in standards of enlistment were\r\ngone. The Army was replacing white officers in black units with\r\nNegroes as fast as qualified black replacements became available. And\r\nmore were qualifying every day. By 30 June 1948 the Army had almost\r\n1,000 black commissioned officers, 5 warrant officers, and 67 nurses\r\nserving with over 65,000 enlisted men and women.[8-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-63: STM-30, Strength of the Army, 1 Jul\r\n                   48. For an optimistic report on the execution of\r\n                   Circular 124, see _Annual Report of the Secretary\r\n                   of the Army, 1948_ (Washington: Government Printing\r\n                   Office, 1949), pp. 7-8, 83, 94.]\r\n\r\nBut here, in the eyes of the Army's critics, was the rub: after three\r\nyears of racial reform segregation not only remained but had been\r\nperfected. No longer would the Army be plagued with the vast all-black\r\ndivisions that had segregated thousands of Negroes in an admittedly\r\ninefficient and often embarrassing manner. Instead, Negroes would\r\nbe segregated in more easily managed hundreds. By limiting         (p. 227)\r\nintegration to the battalion level (the lowest self-sustaining unit in\r\nthe Army system), the Army could guarantee the separation of the races\r\nin eating, sleeping, and general social matters and still hope to\r\nescape some of the obvious discrimination of separate units by making\r\nthe black battalions organic elements of larger white units. The\r\nArmy's scheme did not work. Schooling and specialty occupations aside,\r\nsegregation quite obviously remained the essential fact of military\r\nlife and social intercourse for the majority of black soldiers, and\r\nall the evidence of reasonable and genuine reform that came about\r\nunder the Gillem Board policy went aglimmering. The Army was in for\r\nsome rough years with its critics.\r\n\r\nBut why were the Army's senior officers, experienced leaders at the\r\npinnacle of their careers and dedicated to the well-being of the\r\ninstitution they served, so reluctant to part with segregation? Why\r\ndid they cling to an institution abandoned by the Navy and the Air\r\nForce,[8-64] the target of the civil rights movement and its allies in\r\nCongress, and by any reasonable judgment so costly in terms of\r\nefficient organization? The answers lie in the reasoned defense of\r\ntheir position developed by these men during the long controversy over\r\nthe use of black troops and so often presented in public statements\r\nand documents.[8-65] Arguments for continued segregation fell into four\r\ngeneral categories.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-64: The Air Force became a separate\r\n                   service on 18 September 1947.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-65: Unless otherwise noted, the following\r\n                   paragraphs are based on Nichols' interviews in 1953\r\n                   with Generals Eisenhower, Bradley, and Lee and with\r\n                   Lt.

Prejudice was a condition of American society, General of\r\nthe Army Dwight D. Eisenhower told a Senate committee in 1948, and the\r\nArmy \"is merely one of the mirrors that holds up to our faces the\r\nUnited States of America.\" Since society separated the races, it\r\nfollowed that if the Army allowed black and white soldiers to live and\r\nsocialize together it ran the very real risk of riots and racial\r\ndisturbances which could disrupt its vital functions. Remembering the\r\ncontribution of black platoons to the war in Europe, General\r\nEisenhower, for his part, was willing to accept the risk and integrate\r\nthe races by platoons, believing that the social problems \"can be\r\nhandled,\" particularly on the large posts. Nevertheless he made no\r\nmove toward integrating by platoons while he was Chief of Staff. Later\r\nhe explained that\r\n\r\n     the possibility of applying this lesson [World War II integration\r\n     of Negro platoons] to the peacetime Army came up again and again.\r\n     Objection involved primarily the social side of the soldier's\r\n     life. It was argued that through integration we would get into\r\n     all kinds of difficulty in staging soldiers' dances and other\r\n     social events. At that time we were primarily occupied in\r\n     responding to America's determination \"to get the soldiers\r\n     home\"--so, as I recall, little progress toward integration was\r\n     made during that period.[8-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-66: Ltr, DDE to Gen Bruce Clarke\r\n                   (commander of the 2d Constabulary Brigade when it\r\n                   was integrated in 1950), 29 May 67, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSPECTION BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF. _General Dwight D.\r\nEisenhower talks with a soldier of the 25th Combat Team Motor Pool\r\nduring a tour of Fort Benning, Georgia, 1947._]\r\n\r\n\"Liquor and women,\" Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee pronounced, were the   (p. 228)\r\nmajor ingredients of racial turmoil in the Army. Although General\r\nLee had been a prime mover in the wartime integration of combat\r\nplatoons, he wanted the Army to avoid social integration because of\r\nthe disturbances he believed would attend it. As General Omar N.\r\nBradley saw it, the Army could integrate its training programs but not\r\nthe soldier's social life. Hope of progress would be destroyed if\r\nintegration was pushed too fast. Bradley summed up his postwar\r\nattitude very simply: \"I said let's go easy--as fast as we can.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, segregation was an efficient way to isolate the poorly\r\neducated and undertrained black soldier, especially one with a combat\r\noccupational specialty. To integrate Negroes into white combat units,\r\nalready dangerously understrength, would threaten the Army's fighting\r\nability. When he was Chief of Staff, Eisenhower thought many of the\r\nproblems associated with black soldiers, problems of morale, health,\r\nand discipline, were problems of education, and that the Negro was\r\ncapable of change. \"I believe,\" he said, \"that a Negro can improve his\r\nstanding and his social standing and his respect for certain of the\r\nstandards that we observe, just as well as we can.\" Lt. Gen. Wade H.\r\nHaislip, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Administration, concluded that\r\nthe Army's racial mission was education. All that Circular 124 meant,\r\nhe explained, \"was that we had to begin educating the Negro soldiers\r\nso they could be mixed sometime in the future.\" Bradley observed in\r\nagreement that \"as you begin to get better educated Negroes in the\r\nservice,\" there is \"more reason to integrate.\" The Army was pledged to\r\naccept Negroes and to give them a wide choice of assignment, but until\r\ntheir education and training improved they had to be isolated.\r\n\r\nThird, segregation was the only way to provide equal treatment and\r\nopportunity for black troops. Defending this paternalistic argument,\r\nEisenhower told the Senate:\r\n\r\n     In general, the Negro is less well educated ... and if you make a\r\n     complete amalgamation, what you are going to have is in every\r\n     company the Negro is going to be relegated to the minor jobs, and\r\n     he is never going to get his promotion to such grades as\r\n     technical sergeant, master sergeant, and so on, because the\r\n     competition is too tough. If, on the other hand, he is in     (p. 229)\r\n     smaller units of his own, he can go up to that rate, and I\r\n     believe he is entitled to the chance to show his own wares.\r\n\r\nFourth, segregation was necessary because segments of American society\r\nwith powerful representatives in Congress were violently opposed to\r\nmixing the races. Bradley explained that integration was part of\r\nsocial evolution, and he was afraid that the Army might move too fast\r\nfor certain sections of the country. \"I thought in 1948 that they were\r\nready in the North,\" he added, \"but not in the South.\" The south\r\n\"learned over the years that mixing the races was a vast problem.\"\r\nBradley continued, \"so any change in the Army would be a big step in\r\nthe South.\" General Haislip reasoned, you \"just can't do it all of a\r\nsudden.\" As for the influence of those opposed to maintaining the\r\nArmy's social _status quo_, Haislip, who was the Vice Chief of Staff\r\nduring part of the Gillem Board period, recalled that \"everybody was\r\nfloundering around, trying to find the right thing to do. I didn't\r\nlose any sleep over it [charges of discrimination].\" General\r\nEisenhower, as he did so often during his career, accurately distilled\r\nthe thinking of his associates:\r\n\r\n     I believe that the human race may finally grow up to the point\r\n     where it [race relations] will not be a problem. It [the race\r\n     problem] will disappear through education, through mutual\r\n     respect, and so on. But I do believe that if we attempt merely by\r\n     passing a lot of laws to force someone to like someone else, we\r\n     are just going to get into trouble. On the other hand, I do not\r\n     by any means hold out for this extreme segregation as I said when\r\n     I first joined the Army 38 years ago.\r\n\r\nThese arguments might be specious, as a White House committee would\r\nlater demonstrate, but they were not necessarily guileful, for they\r\nwere the heartfelt opinions of many of the Army's leaders, opinions\r\nshared by officials of the other services. These men were probably\r\nblind to the racism implicit in their policies, a racism nurtured by\r\nmilitary tradition. Education and environment had fostered in these\r\ncareer officers a reverence for tradition. Why should the Army, these\r\ntraditionalists might ask, abandon its black units, some with\r\nhistories stretching back almost a century? Why should the ordered\r\nsocial life of the Army post, for so long a mirror of the segregated\r\nsociety of most civilian communities, be so uncomfortably changed? The\r\nfact that integration had never really been tried before made it\r\nfraught with peril, and all the forces of military tradition conspired\r\nto support the old ways.\r\n\r\nWhat had gone unnoticed by Army planners was the subtle change in the\r\nattitude of the white enlisted man toward integration. Opinion surveys\r\nwere rare in an institution dedicated to the concept of military\r\ndiscipline, but nevertheless in the five years following the war\r\nseveral surveys were made of the racial views of white troops (the\r\nviews of black soldiers were ignored, probably on the assumption that\r\nall Negroes favored integration). In 1946, just as the Gillem Board\r\npolicy was being enunciated, the Army staff found enlisted men in\r\nsubstantial agreement on segregation. Although most of those surveyed\r\nsupported the expanded use of Negroes in the Army, an overwhelming\r\nmajority voted for the principle of having racially separate working\r\nand living arrangements. Yet the pollsters found much less opposition\r\nto integration when they put their questions on a personal basis--\"How\r\ndo _you_ feel about...?\" Only southerners as a group registered a\r\nclear majority for segregated working conditions. The survey also  (p. 230)\r\nrevealed another encouraging portent: most of the opposition to\r\nintegration existed among older and less educated men.[8-67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-67: The 1946 survey is contained in\r\n                   CINFO, \"Supplementary Rpt on Attitudes of Whites\r\n                   Toward Serving With Negro EM,\" Incl to Memo, Col\r\n                   Charles S.

This time less than a third of those\r\nquestioned were opposed to integrated working conditions and some 40\r\npercent were not \"definitely opposed\" to complete integration of both\r\nworking and living arrangements. Again men from all areas tended to\r\nendorse integration as their educational level rose; opposition, on\r\nthe other hand, centered in 1949 among the chronic complainers and\r\nthose who had never worked with Negroes.[8-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-68: Armed Forces I&E Div, OSD, Rpt No.\r\n                   101, \"Morale Attitudes of Enlisted Men, May-June\r\n                   1949,\" pt. II, Attitude Toward Integration of Negro\r\n                   Soldiers in the Army, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nIn discussing prejudice and discrimination it is necessary to compare\r\nthe Army with the rest of American society. Examining the question of\r\nrace relations in the Army runs the risk of distorting the importance\r\ngiven the subject by the nation as a whole in the postwar period.\r\nWhile resistance to segregation was undoubtedly growing in the black\r\ncommunity and among an increasing number of progressives in the white\r\ncommunity, there was as yet no widespread awareness of the problem and\r\ncertainly no concerted public effort to end it. This lack of\r\nperception might be particularly justified in the case of Army\r\nofficers, for few of them had any experience with black soldiers and\r\nmost undoubtedly were not given to wide reading and reflecting on the\r\nsubject of race relations. Moreover, the realities of military life\r\ntended to insulate Army officers from the main currents of American\r\nsociety. Frequently transferred and therefore without roots in the\r\ncivilian community, isolated for years at a time in overseas\r\nassignments, their social life often centered in the military\r\ngarrison, officers might well have been less aware of racial\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of the insulation imposed on officers by their duties,\r\nthe Army's leaders were achieving reforms far beyond those accepted\r\nelsewhere in American society. Few national organizations and\r\nindustries could match the Army in 1948 for the number of Negroes\r\nemployed, the breadth of responsibility given them, and the variety\r\nof their training and occupations. Looked at in this light, the    (p. 231)\r\nArmy of 1948 and the men who led it could with considerable\r\njustification be classed as a progressive force in the fight for\r\nracial justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Segregation: An Assessment_\r\n\r\nThe gap between the Army's stated goal of integration and its\r\ncontinuing practices had grown so noticeable in 1948, a presidential\r\nelection year, that most civil rights spokesmen and their allies in\r\nthe press had become disillusioned with Army reforms. Benjamin O.\r\nDavis, still the Army's senior black officer and still after eight\r\nyears a brigadier general, called the Army staff's attention to the\r\nshift in attitude. Most had greeted publication of Circular 124 as\r\n\"the dawn of a new day for the colored soldier\"--General Davis's\r\nwords--and looked forward to the gradual eradication of segregation.\r\nBut Army practices in subsequent months had brought disappointment, he\r\nwarned the under secretary, and the black press had become \"restless\r\nand impatient.\" He wanted the Army staff to give \"definite expression\r\nof the desire of the Department of National Defense for the\r\nelimination of all forms of discrimination-segregation from the Armed\r\nServices.\"[8-69] The suggestion was disapproved. General Paul explained\r\nthat the Army could not make such a policy statement since Circular\r\n124 permitted segregated units and a quota that by its nature\r\ndiscriminated at least in terms of numbers of Negroes assigned.[8-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-69: Memo, Brig Gen B.

This effect was difficult to measure\r\nbut nevertheless real and has been the subject of considerable study\r\nby social scientists.[8-72] Their opinions are obviously open to debate,\r\nand in fact most of them were not fully formulated during the period\r\nunder discussion. Yet their conclusions, based on modern sociological\r\ntechniques, clearly reveal the pain and turmoil suffered by black\r\nsoldiers because of racial separation. Rarely did the Army staff\r\nbother to delve into these matters in the years before Korea,      (p. 232)\r\nalthough the facts on which the scientists based their conclusions\r\nwere collected by the War Department itself. This indifference is the\r\nmore curious because the Army had always been aware of what the War\r\nDepartment Policies and Programs Review Board called in 1947 \"that\r\nintangible aspect of military life called prestige and spirit.\"[8-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-72: For a detailed discussion of this\r\n                   point, see Mandelbaum, _Soldier Groups and Negro\r\n                   Soldiers_; Stouffer et al., _The American Soldier:\r\n                   Adjustment During Army Life_, ch.

Yet by\r\nignoring segregation the staff overlooked the primary cause of its\r\nracial problems and condemned the Army to their continuation. It need\r\nnot have been, because as originally conceived, the Gillem Board\r\npolicy provided, in the words of the Assistant Secretary of War, for\r\n\"progressive experimentation\" leading to \"effective manpower\r\nutilization without regard to race or color.\"[8-74] This reasonable\r\napproach to a complex social issue was recognized as such by the War\r\nDepartment and by many black spokesmen. But the Gillem Board's\r\noriginal goal was soon abandoned, and in the \"interest of National\r\nDefense,\" according to Secretary Royall, integration was postponed for\r\nthe indefinite future.[8-75] Extension of individual integration below\r\nthe company level was forbidden, and the lessons learned at the\r\nKitzingen Training Center were never applied elsewhere; in short,\r\nprogressive experimentation was abandoned.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 8-74: Ltr, Howard C.

While Patterson and his assistants accepted restriction\r\non the number of Negroes and their assignment to segregated jobs and\r\nfacilities as a temporary expedient, military subordinates used the\r\nGillem Board's reforms as a way to make more efficient a segregation\r\npolicy that neither they nor, they believed, society in general was\r\nwilling to change. Thus, despite some real progress on the periphery\r\nof its racial problem, the Army would have to face the enemy in Korea\r\nwith an inefficient organization of its men.\r\n\r\nThe Army's postwar policy was based on a false premise. The Gillem\r\nBoard decided that since Negroes had fought poorly in segregated\r\ndivisions in two world wars, they might fight better in smaller\r\nsegregated organizations within larger white units. Few officers\r\nreally believed this, for it was commonly accepted throughout the Army\r\nthat Negroes generally made poor combat soldiers. It followed then\r\nthat the size of a unit was immaterial, and indeed, given the manpower\r\nthat the Army received from reenlistments and Selective Service, any\r\nblack unit, no matter its size, would almost assuredly be an\r\ninefficient, spiritless group of predominately Class IV and V men. For\r\nin addition to its educational limitations, the typical black unit\r\nsuffered a further handicap in the vital matter of motivation. The\r\nGillem Board disregarded this fact, but it was rarely overlooked by\r\nthe black soldier: he was called upon to serve as a second-class   (p. 233)\r\nsoldier to defend what he often regarded as his second-class\r\ncitizenship. In place of unsatisfactory black divisions, Circular 124\r\nmade the Army substitute three unsatisfactorily mixed divisions whose\r\nblack elements were of questionable efficiency and a focus of\r\ncomplaint among civil rights advocates. Commanders at all levels faced\r\na dilemma implicit in the existence of white and black armies side by\r\nside. Overwhelmed by regulations and policies that tried to preserve\r\nthe fiction of separate but equal opportunity, these officers wasted\r\ntheir time and energy and, most often in the case of black officers,\r\nlost their self-confidence.\r\n\r\nIn calling for the integration of small black units rather than\r\nindividuals, the Gillem Board obviously had in mind the remarkably\r\neffective black platoons in Europe in the last months of World War II.\r\nBut even this type of organization was impossible in the postwar Army\r\nbecause it demanded a degree of integration that key commanders,\r\nespecially the major Army component commanders, were unwilling to\r\naccept.\r\n\r\nThese real problems were intensified by the normal human failings of\r\nprejudice, vested interest, well-meaning ignorance, conditioned\r\nupbringing, shortsightedness, preoccupation with other matters, and\r\nsimple reluctance to change. The old ways were comfortable, and the\r\nnew untried, frightening in their implications and demanding special\r\neffort. Nowhere was there enthusiasm for the positive measures needed\r\nto implement the Gillem Board's recommendations leading to\r\nintegration. This unwillingness to act positively was particularly\r\nnoticeable in the Organization and Training Division, in the Army\r\nGround Forces, and even to some extent in the Personnel and\r\nAdministration Division itself.\r\n\r\nThe situation might have improved had the Gillem Board been able or\r\nwilling to spell out intermediate goals. For the ultimate objective of\r\nusing black soldiers like white soldiers as individuals was\r\ninconceivable and meaningless or radical and frightening to many in\r\nthe Army. Interim goals might have provided impetus for gradual change\r\nand precluded the virtual inertia that gripped the Army staff. But at\r\nbest Circular 124 served as a stopgap measure, allowing the Army to\r\npostpone for a few more years any substantial change in race policy.\r\nThis postponement cost the service untold time and effort devising and\r\ndefending a system increasingly under attack from the black community\r\nand, significantly, from that community's growing allies in the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9                                                          (p. 234)\r\n\r\nThe Postwar Navy\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Army concerns and problems dominated the discussions of race\r\nrelations in the armed forces in the postwar years is understandable\r\nsince the Army had the largest number of Negroes and the most widely\r\npublicized segregation policy of all the services. At the same time\r\nthe Army bore, unfairly, the brunt of public criticism for all the\r\nservices' race problems. The Navy, committed to a policy of\r\nintegration, but with relatively few Negroes in its integrated general\r\nservice or in the ranks of the segregated Marine Corps and the new Air\r\nForce, its racial policy still fluid, merely attracted less attention\r\nand so escaped many of the charges hurled at the Army by civil rights\r\nadvocates both in and out of the federal government. But however\r\ndifferent or unformed their racial policies, all the services for the\r\nmost part segregated Negroes in practice and all were open to charges\r\nof discrimination.\r\n\r\nAlthough the services developed different racial policies out of their\r\nseparate circumstances, all three were reacting to the same set of\r\nsocial forces and all three suffered from race prejudice. They also\r\nfaced in common a growing indifference to military careers on the part\r\nof talented young Negroes who in any case would have to compete with\r\nan aging but persistent group of less talented black professionals for\r\na limited number of jobs. Of great importance was the fact that the\r\nracial practices of the armed forces were a product of the individual\r\nservice's military traditions. Countless incidents support the\r\ncontention that service traditions were a transcendent factor in\r\nmilitary decisions. Marx Leva, Forrestal's assistant, told the story\r\nof a Forrestal subordinate who complained that some admirals were\r\nstill opposed to naval aviation, to which Forrestal replied that he\r\nknew some admirals who still opposed steam engines.[9-1] Forrestal's\r\nhumorous exaggeration underscored the tenacity of traditional\r\nattitudes in the Navy. Although self-interest could never be\r\ndiscounted as a motive, tradition also figured prominently, for\r\nexample, in the controversy between proponents of the battleship and\r\nproponents of the aircraft carrier. Certainly the influence of\r\ntradition could be discerned in the antipathy of Navy officials toward\r\nracial change.[9-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-1: Interv, Lee Nichols with Marx Leva,\r\n                   1953, in Nichols Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-2: On the survival of traditional\r\n                   attitudes in the Navy, see Karsten, _Naval\r\n                   Aristocracy_, ch. v; Waldo H.

It endured tremendous\r\ninner conflict before it decided to drop the cavalry in favor of\r\nmechanized and armored units. Nor did the resistance to armor die\r\nquickly. Former Chief of Staff Peyton C. March reported that a     (p. 235)\r\nprevious Chief of Cavalry told him in 1950 that the Army had\r\nbetrayed the horse.[9-3] President Roosevelt was also a witness to how\r\nmilitary tradition frustrated attempts to change policy. He picked his\r\nbeloved Navy to make the point: \"To change anything in the Na-a-vy is\r\nlike punching a feather bed. You punch it with your right and you\r\npunch it with your left until you are finally exhausted, and then you\r\nfind the damn bed just as it was before you started punching.\"[9-4] Many\r\nsenior officers resisted equal treatment and opportunity simply\r\nbecause of their traditional belief that Negroes needed special\r\ntreatment and any basic change in their status was fraught with\r\ndanger.[9-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-3: Edward M.

When James Forrestal started\r\nto integrate the general service in 1944, his appeals to his senior\r\nmilitary colleagues, the President, and the public were always couched\r\nin terms of military efficiency. But if military efficiency made the\r\nnew policy announced in February 1946 inevitable, military tradition\r\nmade partial integration acceptable. Black sailors had served in\r\nsignificant numbers in an integrated general service during the\r\nnation's first century and a half, and those in the World War II\r\nperiod who spoke of a traditional Navy ban against Negroes were just\r\nas wrong as those who spoke of a traditional ban on liquor. The same\r\nabstemious secretary who completely outlawed alcohol on warships in\r\n1914 initiated the short-lived restrictions on the service of Negroes\r\nin the Navy.[9-6] Both limited integration and liquor were old\r\ntraditions in the American Navy, and the influence of military\r\ntradition made integration of the general service relatively simple.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-6: SecNav (Josephus Daniels) General\r\n                   Order 90, 1 Jul 14.

The 1914 prohibition rule\r\n                   infuriated the officers. One predicted that the\r\n                   ruling would push officers into \"the use of cocaine\r\n                   and other dangerous drugs.\" Quoted in Ronald\r\n                   Spector, _Admiral of the New Empire_ (Baton Rouge:\r\n                   University of Louisiana Press, 1974), pp. 191-92.]\r\n\r\nForrestal was convinced that in order to succeed racial reform must\r\nfirst be accepted by the men already in uniform; integration, if\r\nquietly and gradually put into effect, would soon demonstrate its\r\nefficiency and make the change acceptable to all members of the\r\nservice. Quiet gradualism became the hallmark of his effort. In August\r\n1945 the Navy had some 165,000 Negroes, almost 5.5 percent of its\r\ntotal strength. Sixty-four of them, including six women, were\r\ncommissioned officers.[9-7] Presumably, these men and women would be the\r\nfirst to enjoy the fruits of the new integration order. Their number\r\ncould also be expected to increase because, as Secretary Forrestal\r\nreported in August 1946, the only quotas on enlistment were those\r\ndetermined by the needs of the Navy and the limitation of          (p. 236)\r\nfunds.[9-8] Even as he spoke, at least some black sailors were being\r\ntrained in almost all naval ratings and were serving throughout the\r\nfleet, on planes and in submarines, working and living with whites.\r\nThe signs pointed to a new day for Negroes in the Navy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-7: Unless otherwise noted the statistical\r\n                   information used in this section was supplied by\r\n                   the Office, Assistant Chief for Management\r\n                   Information, BuPers.

Although Negroes continued to number about 5 percent\r\nof the Navy's enlisted strength, their position altered radically. The\r\naverage strength figures for 1946 showed 3,300 Negroes, 16 percent of\r\nthe total black strength, serving in the integrated general service\r\nwhile 17,300, or 84 percent, were classified as stewards. By mid-1948\r\nthe outlook was somewhat brighter, but still on the average only 38\r\npercent of the Negroes in the Navy held jobs in the general service\r\nwhile 62 percent remained in the nonwhite Steward's Branch. At this\r\ntime only three black officers remained on active duty. Again, what\r\nNavy officials saw as military efficiency helps explain this postwar\r\nretreat. Because of its rapidly sinking manpower needs, the Navy could\r\nafford to set higher enlistment standards than the Army, and the fewer\r\navailable spaces in the general service went overwhelmingly to the\r\nmany more eligible whites who applied. Only in the Steward's Branch,\r\nwith its separate quotas and lower enlistment standards, did the   (p. 237)\r\nNavy find a place for the many black enlistees as well as the\r\nthousands of stewards ready and willing to reenlist for peacetime\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIf efficiency explains why the Navy's general service remained\r\ndisproportionately white, tradition explains how segregation and\r\nracial exclusion could coexist with integration in an organization\r\nthat had so recently announced a progressive racial policy. Along with\r\nits tradition of an integrated general service, the Navy had a\r\ntradition of a white officer corps. It was natural for the Navy to\r\nexclude black officers from the Regular Navy, Secretary John L.\r\nSullivan said later, just as it was common to place Negroes in mess\r\njobs.[9-9] A _modus vivendi_ could be seen emerging from the twin\r\ndictates of efficiency and tradition: integrate a few thousand black\r\nsailors throughout the general service in fulfillment of the letter of\r\nthe Bureau of Naval Personnel circular; as for the nonwhite Steward's\r\nBranch and the lack of black officers, these conditions were ordinary\r\nand socially comfortable. Since most Navy leaders agreed that the new\r\npolicy was fair and practical, no further changes seemed necessary in\r\nthe absence of a pressing military need or a demand from the White\r\nHouse or Congress.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-9: Interv, Nichols with Secretary John L.\r\n                   Sullivan, Dec 52, in Nichols Collection, CMH.\r\n                   Sullivan succeeded James Forrestal as secretary on\r\n                   18 September 1947.]\r\n\r\nTo black publicists and other advocates of civil rights, the Navy's\r\npostwar manpower statistics were self-explanatory: the Navy was\r\ndiscriminating against the Negro. Time and again the Navy responded to\r\nthis charge, echoing Secretary Forrestal's contention that the Navy\r\nhad no racial quotas and that all restrictions on the employment of\r\nblack sailors had been lifted. As if suggesting that all racial\r\ndistinctions had been abandoned, personnel officials discontinued\r\npublishing racial statistics and abolished the Special Programs\r\nUnit.[9-10] Cynics might have ascribed other motives for these\r\ndecisions, but the civil rights forces apparently never bothered. For\r\nthe most part they left the Navy's apologists to struggle with the\r\nincreasingly difficult task of explaining why the placement of Negroes\r\ndeviated so markedly from assignment for whites.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-10: The BuPers Progress Report (Pers\r\n                   215), the major statistical publication of the\r\n                   department, terminated its statistical breakdown by\r\n                   race in March 1946. The Navy's racial affairs\r\n                   office was closed in June 1946. See BuPers,\r\n                   \"Narrative of Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1\r\n                   September 1945 to 1 October 1946\" (hereafter\r\n                   \"BuPers Narrative\"), 1:73.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy's difficulty in this regard stemmed from the fact that the\r\ndemobilization program under which it geared down from a 3.4\r\nmillion-man service to a peacetime force of less than half a million\r\nwas quite straightforward and simple. Consequently, the latest state\r\nof the Negro in the Navy was readily apparent to the black serviceman\r\nand to the public. The key to service in the postwar Navy was\r\nacceptance into the Regular Navy. The wartime Navy had been composed\r\noverwhelmingly of reservists and inductees, and shortly after V-J day\r\nthe Navy announced plans for the orderly separation of all reservists\r\nby September 1946. In April 1946 it discontinued volunteer enlistment\r\nin the Naval Reserve for immediate active duty, and in May it      (p. 238)\r\nissued its last call for draftees through Selective Service.[9-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-11: Ibid., p. 143; Selective Service\r\n                   System, _Special Groups_ (Monograph 10), 2:200.\r\n                   Between September 1945 and May 1946 the Navy\r\n                   drafted 20,062 men, including 3,394 Negroes.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Bureau of Naval Personnel launched a vigorous\r\nprogram to induce reservists to switch to the Regular Navy. In October\r\n1945 it opened all petty officer ratings in the Regular Navy to such\r\ntransfers and offered reservists special inducements for changeover in\r\nthe form of ratings, allowance extras, and, temporarily, short-term\r\nenlistments. So successful was the program that by July 1947 the\r\nstrength of the Regular Navy had climbed to 488,712, only a few\r\nthousand short of the postwar authorization. The Navy ended its\r\nchangeover program in early 1947.[9-12] While it lasted, black\r\nreservists and inductees shared in the program, although the chief of\r\nthe personnel recruiting division found it necessary to amplify the\r\nrecruiting instructions to make this point clear.[9-13] The Regular Navy\r\nincluded 7,066 enlisted Negroes on V-J day, 2.1 percent of the total\r\nenlisted strength. This figure nearly tripled in the next year to\r\n20,610, although the percentage of Negroes only doubled.[9-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-12: \"BuPers Narrative,\" 1:141, 192; see\r\n                   also BuPers Cir Ltr 41-46, 15 Feb 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-13: See Ltr, Chief, NavPers, to CO, Naval\r\n                   Barracks, NAD, Seal Beach, Calif., 8 Oct 45, sub:\r\n                   Eligibility of Negroes for Enlistment in USN, P16\r\n                   MM, BuPersRecs; Recruiting Dir, BuPers, Directive\r\n                   to Recruiting Officers, 25 Jan 46, quoted in\r\n                   Nelson, \"Integration of the Negro,\" p. 58.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-14: BuPers, \"Enlisted Strength--U.S.\r\n                   Navy,\" 26 Jul 46, Pers 215-BL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Steward's Branch_\r\n\r\nThe major concern of the civil rights groups was not so much the\r\nnumber of Negroes in the Regular Navy, although this remained far\r\nbelow the proportion of Negroes in the civilian population, but that\r\nthe majority of Negroes were being accepted for duty in the nonwhite\r\nSteward's Branch. More than 97 percent of all black sailors in the\r\nRegular Navy in December 1945 were in this branch. The ratio improved\r\nsomewhat in the next six months when 3,000 black general service\r\npersonnel (out of a wartime high of 90,000) transferred into the\r\nRegular Navy while more than 10,000 black reservists and draftees\r\njoined the 7,000 regulars already in the Steward's Branch.[9-15] The\r\nstatistical low point in terms of the ratio of Negroes in the postwar\r\nregular general service and the Steward's Branch occurred in fiscal\r\nyear 1947 when only 19.21 percent of the Navy's regular black\r\npersonnel were assigned outside the Steward's Branch.[9-16] In short,\r\nmore than eight out of every ten Negroes in the Navy trained and\r\nworked separately from white sailors, performing menial tasks and led\r\nby noncommissioned officers denied the perquisites of rank.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-15: Memo, Dir of Planning and Control,\r\n                   BuPers, for Chief, NavPers (ca.

The Steward's Branch\r\ncreated efficiency problems and was a constant source of embarrassment\r\nto the service's public image. Because of its low standards, the\r\nbranch attracted thousands of poorly educated and underprivileged\r\nindividuals who had a high rate of venereal disease but were       (p. 239)\r\nengaged in preparing and serving food. Leaders within the branch\r\nitself, although selected on the basis of recommendations from\r\nsuperiors, examinations, and seniority, were often poor performers.\r\nRelations between the individual steward and the outfit to which he\r\nwas assigned were often marked by personal conflicts and other\r\ndifficulties. Consequently, while stewards eagerly joined the branch\r\nin the Regular Navy, the incidence of disciplinary problems among them\r\nwas high. The branch naturally earned the opprobrium of civil rights\r\ngroups, who were sensitive not only to the discrimination of a\r\nseparate branch for minorities but also to the unfavorable image these\r\nmen created of Negroes in the service.[9-17]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-17: Memo, Lt Dennis D. Nelson for Dep\r\n                   Dir. Pub Relations. 26 Mar 48, sub: Problems of the\r\n                   Stewards' Branch, PR 221-5393, GenRecsNav.

Its\r\nspokesmen frequently explained that it performed an essential\r\nfunction, especially at sea. Since this function was limited in scope,\r\nthey added, the Navy was able to reduce the standards for the branch,\r\nthus opening opportunities for many men otherwise ineligible to join\r\nthe service. In order to offer a chance for advancement the Navy\r\nhad to create a separate recruiting and training system for        (p. 240)\r\nstewards. This separation in turn explained the steward's usual\r\nfailure to transfer to branches in the regular command channels. Since\r\nthere were no minimum standards for the branch, it followed that most\r\nof its noncommissioned officers remained unqualified to exercise\r\nmilitary command over personnel other than their branch subordinates.\r\nLack of command responsibility was also present in a number of other\r\nbranches not directly concerned with the operation of ships. It was\r\nnot the result of race prejudice, therefore, but of standards for\r\nenlistment and types of duties performed. Nor was the steward's\r\nfrequent physical separation based on race; berthing was arranged by\r\ndepartment and function aboard large vessels. Separation did not exist\r\non smaller ships. Messmen were usually berthed with other men of the\r\nsupply department, including bakers and storekeepers. Chief stewards,\r\nhowever, as Under Secretary Kimball later explained, had not been\r\nrequired to meet the military qualifications for chief petty officer,\r\nand therefore it was \"considered improper that they should be accorded\r\nthe same messing, berthing, club facilities, and other privileges\r\nreserved for the highest enlisted grade of the Navy.\"[9-18] Stewards of\r\nthe lower ranks received the same chance for advancement as members of\r\nother enlisted branches, but to grant them command responsibility\r\nwould necessitate raising qualifications for the whole branch,     (p. 241)\r\nthus eliminating many career stewards and extending steward training\r\nto include purely military subjects.[9-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-18: Ltr, Under SecNav for Congressman\r\n                   Clyde Doyle of California. 24 Aug 49, MM(1),\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-19: For examples of the Navy's official\r\n                   explanation of steward duties, see Ltr, Actg SecNav\r\n                   to Lester Granger, 22 Apr 46, QN/MM(2), and Ltr,\r\n                   Under SecNav to Congressman Clyde Doyle of\r\n                   California, 24 Aug 49; both in GenRecsNav.

Stewards had taken advantage of\r\nrelaxed regulations, flocking into the Regular Navy during the first\r\nmonths of the changeover program. Many did so because they had many\r\nyears invested in a naval career. Some may have wanted the training\r\nand experience to be gained from messman's service. In fact, some\r\nstewards enjoyed rewarding careers in restaurant, club, and hotel work\r\nafter retirement. More surprising, considering the numerous complaints\r\nabout the branch from civil rights groups, the Steward's Branch\r\nconsistently reported the highest reenlistment rate in the Navy.\r\nUnderstandably, the Navy constantly reiterated these statistics.\r\nActually, the stewards themselves were a major stumbling block to\r\nreform of the branch. Few of the senior men aspired to other ratings;\r\nmany were reluctant to relinquish what they saw as the advantages of\r\nthe messman's life. Whatever its drawbacks, messman's duty proved to\r\nbe a popular assignment.[9-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-20: Ltr, Nelson to author, 10 Feb 70.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy's defense was logical, but not too convincing. Technically\r\nthe Steward's Branch was open to all, but in practice it remained\r\nstrictly nonwhite. Civil rights activists could point to the fact that\r\nthere were six times as many illiterate whites as Negroes in the\r\nwartime Navy, yet none of these whites were ever assigned to the\r\nSteward's Branch and none transferred to that branch of the Regular\r\nNavy after the war.[9-21] Moreover, shortly after the war the Bureau of\r\nNaval Personnel predicted a 7,577-man shortage in the Steward's\r\nBranch, but the Navy made no attempt to fill the places with white\r\nsailors. Instead, it opened the branch to Filipinos and Guamanians,\r\nrecruiting 3,500 of the islanders before the program was stopped on 4\r\nJuly 1946, the date of Philippine independence. Some Navy recruiters\r\nfound other ways to fill steward quotas. The Urban League and others\r\nreported cases in which black volunteers were rejected by recruiters\r\nfor any assignment but steward duty.[9-22] Nor did civil rights\r\nspokesmen appreciate the distinction in petty officer rank the Navy\r\nmade between the steward and other sailors; they continued to\r\ninterpret it as part and parcel of the \"injustices, lack of respect\r\nand the disregard for the privileges accorded rated men in other\r\nbranches of the service.\"[9-23] They also resented the paternalism\r\nimplicit in the secretary's assurances that messman's duty was a haven\r\nfor men unable to compete.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-21: Ltr, Dir, Plans and Oper Div, BuPers,\r\n                   to Richard Lueking, Berea College, 6 Dec 46, P16.1,\r\n                   BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-22: Department of National Defense,\r\n                   \"National Defense Conference on Racial Affairs,\" 26\r\n                   Apr 48, morning session, pp. 46-47.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-23: Memo, Lt D.

The\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy for Air, John Nicholas Brown,      (p. 242)\r\nwanted more publicity given both in and outside the service to the\r\nfact that the branch was not restricted to any one race and,\r\nconversely, that Negroes were welcome in the general service.[9-24] In\r\nview of the strong tradition of racial separateness in the stewards\r\nrating, such publicity might be considered sheer sophistry, but no\r\nmore so than the suggestion made by a senior personnel official that\r\nthe Commissary Branch and Steward's Branch be combined to achieve a\r\nracially balanced specialty.[9-25] Lester Granger, now outside the\r\nofficial Navy family but still intimately concerned with the\r\ndepartment's racial affairs, also pleaded for a merger of the\r\ncommissary and steward functions. He reasoned that, since members of\r\nthe Commissary Branch could advance to true petty officer rating, such\r\na merger would provide a new avenue of advancement for stewards.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-24: Ltr, Asst SecNav to Lester Granger,\r\n                   22 Apr 48, QN-MM (2), GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-25: Interv, Nichols with Capt George A.\r\n                   Holderness, Jr., USN, in Nichols Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\nBut more to the point Granger also pushed for reform in the standards\r\nof the Steward's Branch. He recognized that educational and other\r\nrequirements had been lowered for stewards, but, he told Forrestal's\r\nsuccessor, Secretary John L. Sullivan, there was little wisdom in\r\n\"compounding past error.\" He also pointed out that not all messmen\r\nwere in the lower intelligence classifications and recommended that\r\nthe higher scoring men be replaced with low-scoring whites.[9-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-26: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 15 Mar 48,\r\n                   SO-3-18-56, SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nFrom within the Navy itself Lt. Dennis D. Nelson, one of the first\r\ntwelve Negroes commissioned and still on active duty, added his voice\r\nto the demand for reform of the Steward's Branch. An analogy may be\r\ndrawn between the Navy career of Nelson and that of the legendary\r\nChristopher Sargent. Lacking Sargent's advantages of wealth and family\r\nconnection, Nelson nevertheless became a familiar of Secretary\r\nSullivan's and, though not primarily assigned to the task, made equal\r\nopportunity his preeminent concern. A highly visible member of the\r\nNavy's racial minority in Washington, he made himself its spokesman,\r\npressing senior officials to bring the department's manpower practices\r\ncloser to its stated policy. Once again the Navy experienced the\r\ncurious phenomenon of a lieutenant firing off memos and letters to\r\nsenior admirals and buttonholing the Secretary of the Navy.[9-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-27: Interv, Nichols with Sullivan;\r\n                   Intervs, author with Lt Cmdr D.

All in CMH files.]\r\n\r\nNelson had a host of suggestions for the Steward's Branch: eliminate\r\nthe branch as a racially separate division of labor in the Navy,\r\nprovide permanent officer supervision for all steward units, develop\r\ncapable noncommissioned officers in the branch with privileges and\r\nresponsibilities similar to those of other petty officers,\r\nindoctrinate all personnel in the ramifications of the Navy's stated\r\nintegration policy, and create a committee to work out the details of\r\nthese changes. On several occasions Nelson tried to show his superiors\r\nhow nuances in their own behavior toward the stewards reinforced,\r\nperhaps as much as separate service itself, the image of\r\ndiscrimination. He recommended that the steward's uniform be changed,\r\neliminating the white jacket and giving the steward a regular      (p. 243)\r\nseaman's look. He also suggested that petty officer uniforms for\r\nstewards be regularized. At one poignant moment this lonely officer\r\ntook on the whole service, trying to change singlehandedly a\r\nthoughtless habit that demeaned both blacks and whites. He admonished\r\nthe service: \"refrain from the use of 'Boy' in addressing Stewards.\r\nThis has been a constant practice in the Service and is most\r\nobjectionable, is in bad taste, shows undue familiarity and pins a\r\nbadge of inferiority, adding little to the dignity and pride of\r\nadults.\"[9-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-28: Memo, Lt Nelson for Capt Dexter, Pub\r\n                   Rels Office, 24 Aug 48, sub: Negro Stewards, Petty\r\n                   Officer Ratings, Status of, PR 221-14003; idem for\r\n                   Dep Dir, Off of Pub Relations, 26 Mar 48, sub:\r\n                   Problems of the Stewards' Branch, PR 221-5393; both\r\n                   in GenRecsNav. The quotation is from the latter\r\n                   document.]\r\n\r\nIn summing up these recommendations for the Secretary of the Navy in\r\nJanuary 1949, Nelson reminded Sullivan that only 37 percent of the\r\nNavy's Negroes were in the general service, in contrast to 72 percent\r\nof the Negroes in the Marine Corps. He warned that this imbalance\r\nperturbed the members of the recently convened National Defense\r\nConference on Negro Affairs and predicted it would interest those\r\ninvolved in the forthcoming presidential inquiry on equality in the\r\narmed forces.[9-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-29: Ltr, Nelson to SecNav, 7 Jan 49,\r\n                   SecNav files, GenRecsNav. For discussion of the\r\n                   presidential inquiry, see Chapter 14.]\r\n\r\nDespite its continued defense of the _status quo_ in the Steward's\r\nBranch, the Bureau of Naval Personnel was not insensitive to\r\ncriticism. To protect Negroes from overzealous recruiters for the\r\nbranch, the bureau had announced in October 1945 that any Negro in the\r\ngeneral service desiring transfer to the Steward's Branch had to make\r\nhis request in writing.[9-30] In mid-1946 it closed the branch to first\r\nenlistment, thereby abolishing possible abuses in the recruiting\r\nsystem.[9-31] Later in the year the bureau tried to upgrade the quality\r\nof the branch by instituting a new and more rigorous training course\r\nfor second-and third-class stewards and cooks at Bainbridge, Maryland.\r\nFinally, in June 1947 it removed from its personnel manual all\r\nremaining mention of restrictions on the transfer of messmen to the\r\ngeneral service.[9-32] These changes were important, but they failed to\r\nattack racial separation, the major problem of the branch. Thus the\r\ncontroversy over messmen, in which tradition, prejudice, and necessity\r\ncontended, went on, and the Steward's Branch, a symbol of\r\ndiscrimination in the Navy, remained to trouble both the service and\r\nthe civil rights groups for some time.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-30: BuPers Cir Ltr, 17 Oct 45.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-31: Testimony of Capt Fred Stickney at\r\n                   National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26\r\n                   Apr 48, morning session, p. 47.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-32: Change 12 to Ankle D-5114, BuPers\r\n                   Manual, 1942.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black Officers_\r\n\r\nThe Navy had a racial problem of more immediate concern to men like\r\nLieutenant Nelson, one of three black officers remaining on active\r\nduty. These were the survivers of a most exclusive group that had\r\nbegun its existence with much hope. In the months following graduation\r\nof the first twelve black officers and one warrant officer in March\r\n1944, scores of Negroes had passed through the Navy's training school.\r\nBy the end of the war the V-12 program had thirty-six black candidates,\r\nwith three others attending the Supply Corps School at Harvard.    (p. 244)\r\nThe number of black officers had grown at an agonizingly slow rate,\r\nalthough in June 1944 the Secretary of the Navy approved a personnel\r\nbureau request that in effect removed any numerical quotas for black\r\nofficers. Unfortunately, black officers were still limited to filling\r\n\"needs as they appeared,\" and the need for black officers was\r\ncurtailed by the restricted range of activities open to them in the\r\nsegregated wartime service. Further, most nominees for commissions\r\nwere selected from the ranks and depended on the sponsorship of their\r\ncommanding officer who might not be able to spare a competent enlisted\r\nman who deserved promotion. Putting the matter in the best possible\r\nlight, one Navy historian blamed the dearth of black officers on\r\nbureaucratic inertia.[9-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-33: \"BuPers Hist,\" pp. 83-85, and\r\n                   Supplement (LN), pp. 4-8, copy in CMH. Unless\r\n                   otherwise noted the data for this section on black\r\n                   officers in World War II are from this source.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMANDER NELSON.]\r\n\r\nDespite procurement failures and within the limitations of general\r\nsegregation policy, the Navy treated black officers with scrupulous\r\nfairness during the war. The Bureau of Naval Personnel insisted they\r\nbe given the privileges of rank in wardroom and ashore, thus crushing\r\nan attempt by authorities at Great Lakes to underwrite a tacit ban on\r\nthe use of the officers' club by Negroes. In fact, integration proved\r\nto be more the rule than the exception in training black officers. The\r\nsmall number of black candidates made segregated classes impractical,\r\nand after graduation of the first group of black officers at Great\r\nLakes, Negroes were accepted in all officer candidate classes. As part\r\nof this change, the Special Programs Unit successfully integrated the\r\nNavy's officer candidate school in the posh hotels of still-segregated\r\nMiami Beach.\r\n\r\nThe officers graduated into a number of assignments. Some saw duty\r\naboard district and yard craft, others at departmental headquarters in\r\nWashington. A few served in recruit training assignments at Great\r\nLakes and Hampton Institute, but the majority went overseas to work in\r\nlogistical and advanced base companies, the stevedore-type outfits\r\ncomposed exclusively of Negroes. Nelson, for example, was sent to the\r\nMarshall Islands where he was assigned to a logistic support company\r\ncomposed of some three hundred black sailors and noncommissioned\r\nofficers with a racially mixed group of officers. Black staff\r\nofficers, engineers, doctors, dentists, and chaplains were also\r\nattached to these units, where they had limited responsibilities and\r\nlittle chance for advancement.[9-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-34: Nelson, \"Integration of the Negro,\"\r\n                   pp. 156-58.]\r\n\r\nExceptions to the assignment rule increased during the last months (p. 245)\r\nof the war. The Special Programs Unit had concluded that restricting\r\nblack officers to district craft and shore billets might further\r\nencourage the tendency to build an inshore black Navy, and the Bureau\r\nof Naval Personnel began assigning black officers to seagoing vessels\r\nwhen they completed their sea duty training. By July 1945 several were\r\nserving in the fleet. To avoid embarrassment, the Chief of Naval\r\nPersonnel made it a practice to alert the commanding officers of a\r\nship about to receive a black officer so that he might indoctrinate\r\nhis officers. As his assistant, Rear Adm. William M. Fechteler,\r\nexplained to one such commander, \"if such officers are accorded the\r\nproper respect and are required to discharge the duties commensurate\r\nwith their rank they should be equally competent to white officers of\r\nsimilar experience.\"[9-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-35: \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 85. The quotation\r\n                   is from Ltr, Chief, NavPers, to CO, USS _Laramie_,\r\n                   16 Jul 45, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nFechteler's prediction proved accurate. By V-J day, the Navy's black\r\nofficers, both line and staff, were serving competently in many\r\noccupations. The bureau reported that the \"personnel relationship\r\naspect\" of their introduction into the service had worked well. Black\r\nofficers with white petty officers and enlisted men under them handled\r\ntheir command responsibilities without difficulty, and in general\r\nbureau reports and field inspections noted considerable satisfaction\r\nwith their performance.[9-36] But despite this satisfactory record, only\r\nthree black officers remained on active duty in 1946. The promise\r\nengendered by the Navy's treatment of its black officers in the\r\nclosing months of the war had not been fulfilled during the\r\ndemobilization period that followed, and what had been to the civil\r\nrights movement a brightening situation rapidly became an intolerable\r\none.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-36: \"BuPers Hist,\" p. 85.]\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons for the rapid demobilization of black\r\nofficers. Some shared the popular desire of reserve officers to return\r\nto civilian life. Among them were mature men with substantial academic\r\nachievements and valuable technical experience. Many resented in\r\nparticular their assignment to all-black labor units, and wanted to\r\nresume their civilian careers.[9-37] But a number of black officers,\r\nalong with over 29,000 white reservists, did seek commissions in the\r\nRegular Navy.[9-38] Yet not one Negro was granted a regular commission\r\nin the first eighteen months after the war. Lester Granger was\r\nespecially upset by these statistics, and in July 1946 he personally\r\ntook up the case of two black candidates with Secretary Forrestal.[9-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-37: Nelson \"Integration of the Negro,\" p.\r\n                   157.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-38: ALNAV 252-46, 21 May 46, sub:\r\n                   Transfer to Regular Navy.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-39: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 31 Jul 46,\r\n                   54-1-13, Forrestal file, GenRecsNav. One of these\r\n                   applicants was Nelson, then a lieutenant, who\r\n                   received a promotion upon assignment as commanding\r\n                   officer of a logistic support company in the\r\n                   Marshall Islands. The grade became permanent upon\r\n                   Nelson's assignment to the Public Relations Bureau\r\n                   in Washington in 1946.]\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Naval Personnel offered what it considered a reasonable\r\nexplanation. As a group, black reserve officers were considerably\r\noverage for their rank and were thus at a severe disadvantage in the\r\nfierce competition for regular commissions. The average age of the\r\nfirst class of black officers was over thirty-one years. All had been\r\ncommissioned ensigns on 17 March 1944, and all had received one    (p. 246)\r\npromotion to lieutenant, junior grade, by the end of the war. When age\r\nand rank did coincide, black reservists were considered for transfer.\r\nFor example, on 15 March 1947 Ens. John Lee, a former V-12 graduate\r\nassigned as gunnery officer aboard a fleet auxiliary craft, received a\r\nregular commission, and on 6 January 1948 Lt. (jg.) Edith DeVoe, one\r\nof the four black nurses commissioned in March 1945, was transferred\r\ninto the Regular Navy. The following October Ens. Jessie Brown was\r\ncommissioned and assigned to duty as the first black Navy pilot.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, the black officers had the cards stacked against them. As\r\nNelson later explained, the bureau did not extend to its black line\r\nofficers the same consideration given other reservists. While the\r\nfirst twelve black officers were given unrestricted line officer\r\ntraining, the bureau assigned them to restricted line positions, an\r\nadded handicap when it came to promotions and retention in the postwar\r\nNavy. All were commissioned ensigns, although the bureau usually\r\ngranted rank according to the candidate's age, a practice followed\r\nwhen it commissioned its first black staff officers, one of whom\r\nbecame a full lieutenant and the rest lieutenants, junior grade. As an\r\noverage reservist himself, Nelson remained on active duty after the\r\nwar through the personal intervention of Secretary Forrestal. His tour\r\nin the Navy's public relations office was repeatedly extended until\r\nfinally on 1 January 1950, thanks to Secretary Sullivan, he received a\r\nregular commission.[9-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-40: Nelson, \"Integration of the Negro,\"\r\n                   pp. 157-59; Ltr, Nelson to author, 10 Feb 70;\r\n                   Interv, Nichols with Sullivan.]\r\n\r\nProspects for an increase in black officers were dim. With rare\r\nexception the Navy's officers came from the academy at Annapolis, the\r\nofficer candidate program, or the Naval Reserve Officers' Training\r\nCorps (NROTC) program. Ens. Wesley A. Brown would graduate in the\r\nacademy's class of 1949, the sixth Negro to attend and the first to\r\ngraduate in the academy's 104-year history. Only five other Negroes\r\nwere enrolled in the academy's student body in 1949, and there was\r\nlittle indication that this number would rapidly increase. For the\r\nmost part the situation was beyond the control of the Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel. Competition was keen for acceptance at Annapolis. The\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union later asserted that the exclusion of\r\nNegroes from many of the private prep schools, which so often produced\r\nsuccessful academy applicants, helped explain why there were so few\r\nNegroes at the academy.[9-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-41: Ltr. Exec Dir. ACLU, to SecNav, 26\r\n                   Nov 57, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nNor were many black officers forthcoming from the Navy's two other\r\nsources. Officer candidate schools, severely reduced in size after the\r\nwar and a negligible source of career officers, had no Negroes in\r\nattendance from 1946 through 1948. Perhaps most disturbing was the\r\nfact that in 1947 just fourteen Negroes were enrolled among more than\r\n5,600 students in the NROTC program, the usual avenue to a Regular\r\nNavy commission.[9-42] The Holloway program, the basis for the Navy's\r\nreserve officer training system, offered scholarships at fifty-two\r\ncolleges across the nation, but the number of these scholarships was\r\nsmall, the competition intense, and black applicants, often burdened\r\nby inferior schooling, did not fare well.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-42: \"BuPers Narrative,\" 1:295.]\r\n\r\nStatistics pointed at least to the possibility that racial         (p. 247)\r\ndiscrimination existed in the NROTC system. Unlike the Army and Air\r\nForce programs, reserve officer training in the Navy depended to a\r\ngreat extent on state selection committees dominated by civilians.\r\nThese committees exercised considerable leeway in selecting candidates\r\nto fill their state's annual NROTC quota, and their decisions were\r\nfinal. Not one Negro served on any of the state committees. In fact,\r\nfourteen of the fifty-two colleges selected for reserve officer\r\ntraining barred Negroes from admission by law and others--the exact\r\nnumber is difficult to ascertain--by policy. One black newspaper\r\ncharged that only thirteen of the participating institutions admitted\r\nNegroes.[9-43] In all, only six black candidates survived this process\r\nto win commissions in 1948.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-43: Norfolk _Journal and Guide_, August\r\n                   20, 1949.]\r\n\r\nLester Granger blamed the lack of black candidates on the fact that so\r\nfew Negroes attended the schools; undoubtedly, more Negroes would have\r\nbeen enrolled in reserve officer training had the program been\r\nestablished at one of the predominantly black colleges. But black\r\ninstitutions were excluded from the wartime V-12 program, and when the\r\nprogram was extended to include fifty-two colleges in November 1945\r\nthe Navy again rejected the applications of black schools, justifying\r\nthe exclusion, as it did for many white schools, on grounds of\r\ninadequacies in enrollment, academic credentials, and physical\r\nfacilities.[9-44] Some black spokesmen called the decision\r\ndiscriminatory. President Mordecai Johnson of Howard University\r\nruefully wondered how the Navy's unprejudiced and nondiscriminatory\r\nselection of fifty-two colleges managed to exclude so neatly all black\r\ninstitutions.[9-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-44: Ltr, SecNav to William T. Farley,\r\n                   Chmn, Civilian Components Policy Bd, DOD, 4 Mar 50,\r\n                   Q4, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-45: Statement of Dr. Mordecai Johnson at\r\n                   National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26\r\n                   Apr 48, morning session, p. 42.]\r\n\r\nOthers disagreed. From the first the Special Programs Unit had\r\nrejected the clamor for forming V-12 units in predominantly black\r\ncolleges, arguing that in the long run this could be considered\r\nenforced segregation and hardly contribute to racial harmony. Although\r\ncandidates were supposed to attend the NROTC school of their choice,\r\nblack candidates were restricted to institutions that would accept\r\nthem. If a black school was added to the program, all black candidates\r\nwould very likely gravitate toward it. Several black spokesmen,\r\nincluding Nelson, took this attitude and urged instead a campaign to\r\nincrease the number of Negroes at the various integrated schools in\r\nthe NROTC system.[9-46] Whatever the best solution, a significant and\r\nspeedy increase in the number of black officers was unlikely.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-46: Ltr, Nelson to author, 10 Feb 70; see\r\n                   also \"BuPersHist,\" p. 84.]\r\n\r\nOf lesser moment because of the small size of the WAVES and the Nurse\r\nCorps, the role of black women in the postwar Navy nevertheless\r\nconcerned several civil rights leaders. Roy Wilkins, for one,\r\nconcluded that the Navy's new policy which \"hasn't worked out on the\r\nofficer level ... hadn't worked on the women's level\" either.[9-47] The\r\nNavy's statistics seemed to proved his contention. The service had (p. 248)\r\n68 black enlisted women and 6 officers (including 4 nurses) on V-J\r\nday; a year later the number had been reduced to 5 black WAVES and 1\r\nnurse. The Navy sought to defend these statistics against charges of\r\ndiscrimination. A spokesman explained that the paucity of black WAVES\r\nresulted from the fact that Negroes were barred from the WAVES until\r\nDecember 1944, just months before the Navy stopped recruiting all\r\nWAVES. Black WAVES who had remained in the postwar Navy had been\r\nintegrated and were being employed without discrimination.[9-48]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-47: Statement of Roy Wilkins at National\r\n                   Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26 Apr 48,\r\n                   morning session p. 44.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-48: Testimony of Stickney at National\r\n                   Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26 Apr 48,\r\n                   morning session, p. 43.]\r\n\r\nBut criticism persisted. In February 1948 the Navy could count six\r\nblack WAVES out of a total enlisted force of 1,700, and during\r\nhearings on a bill to regularize the women's services several\r\ncongressmen joined with a representative of the NAACP to press for a\r\nspecific anti-discrimination amendment. The amendment was defeated,\r\nbut not before Congressman Adam Clayton Powell charged that the status\r\nof black women in the Navy proved discrimination and demonstrated that\r\nthe administration was practicing \"not merely discrimination,\r\nsegregation, and Jim Crowism, but total exclusion.\"[9-49] The same\r\ncritics also demanded a similar amendment to the companion legislation\r\non the WAC's, but it, too, was defeated.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-49: U.S. Congress, House, Committee on\r\n                   Armed Services, Subcommittee No. 3, Organization\r\n                   and Mobilization, _Hearings on S. 1641, To\r\n                   Establish the Women's Army Corps in the Regular\r\n                   Army, To Authorize the Enlistment and Appointment\r\n                   of Women in the Regular Navy and Marine Corps and\r\n                   the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve and for Other\r\n                   Purposes_, 80th Cong., 2d sess., 18 Feb 48, pp.\r\n                   5603-08, 5657, 5698, 5734-36. The Powell quotation\r\n                   is on page 5734.]\r\n\r\nBlack nurses presented a different problem. Two of the wartime nurses\r\nhad resigned to marry and the third was on inactive status attending\r\ncollege. The Navy, Secretary Forrestal claimed in July 1947, was\r\nfinding it difficult to replace them or add to their number. Observing\r\nthat black leaders had shown considerable interest in the Navy's\r\nnursing program, Forrestal noted that a similar interest had not been\r\nforthcoming from black women themselves. During the Navy's 1946\r\nrecruitment drive to attract 1,000 new nurses, only one Negro applied,\r\nand she was disqualified on physical grounds.[9-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-50: Ltr, SecNav to Congresswoman Margaret\r\n                   Chase Smith (Maine), 24 Jul 47, OG/P14-2,\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Public Image and the Problem of Numbers_\r\n\r\nIndividual black nurses no doubt had cogent reasons for failing to\r\napply for Navy commissions, but the fact that only one applied called\r\nattention to a phenomenon that first appeared about 1946. Black\r\nAmericans were beginning to ignore the Navy. Attempts by black reserve\r\nofficers to procure NROTC applicants in black high schools and\r\ncolleges proved largely unproductive. Nelson spoke before 8,500\r\npotential candidates in 1948, and a special recruiting team reached an\r\nequal number the following year, but the combined effort brought fewer\r\nthan ninety black applicants to take the competitive examination.[9-51]\r\nRecruiters had similar problems in the enlistment of Negroes       (p. 249)\r\nfor general service. Viewed from a different perspective, even the\r\ncomplaints and demands of black citizens, at flood tide during the\r\nwar, now merely trickled into the secretary's office, reflecting, it\r\ncould be argued, a growing indifference. That such unwillingness to\r\nenlist, as Lester Granger put it, should occur on the heels of a\r\nwidely publicized promise of racial equality in the service was\r\nironic. The Navy was beginning to welcome the Negro, but the Negro no\r\nlonger seemed interested in joining.[9-52]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-51: Memo, Dir, Pol Div, BuPers, for Capt\r\n                   William C.

Assistant Secretary\r\nBrown placed the blame, at least in part, on the gap between policy\r\nand practice. Because of delay in abolishing old discriminatory\r\npractices, he pointed out to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations,\r\n\"the Navy's good public relations are endangered.\"[9-53] The personnel\r\nbureau promptly investigated, found justification for complaints   (p. 250)\r\nof discrimination, and took corrective action.[9-54] Yet, as Nelson\r\npointed out, such corrections, often in the form of \"clarifying\r\ndirectives,\" were usually directed to specific commanders and tied to\r\nspecific incidents and were ignored by other commanders as\r\ninapplicable to their own racial experiences.[9-55] Despite the\r\nexistence of the racially separate Steward's Branch, the Navy's policy\r\nseemed so unassailable to the Chief of Naval Personnel that when his\r\nviews on a congressional measure to abolish segregation in the\r\nservices were solicited he reported without reservation that his\r\nbureau interposed no objection.[9-56]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-53: Memo, Asst SecNav for Air for Dep\r\n                   CNO, 3 Feb 48, sub: Racial Discrimination, P1-4\r\n                   (8), GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-54: See Memo, Chief, NavPers, for CO, USS\r\n                   _Grand Canyon_ (AD 28), 17 Dec 48, sub: Navy\r\n                   Department's Non Discrimination Policy--Alleged\r\n                   Violation of, P14; Ltr, Chief, NavPers, to Cmdt,\r\n                   Twelfth Nav Dist, 27 Feb 46, sub: Officer Screening\r\n                   Procedure and Indoctrination Course in the\r\n                   Supervision of Negro Personnel--Establishment of,\r\n                   Pers 4221; both in BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-55: Memo, Nelson for Chief, NavPers, 29\r\n                   Nov 48, sub: Complaint of Navy Enlisted Man Made to\r\n                   Pittsburgh Courier..., PR221, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-56: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for JAG, 11 Feb\r\n                   47, sub: HR 279: To Prohibit Race Segregation in\r\n                   the Armed Forces of the United States, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy's major racial problem by 1948 was the shockingly small\r\nnumber of Negroes in the service. In November 1948, a presidential\r\nelection month, Negroes accounted for 4.3 percent of the navy's\r\nstrength. Not only were there few Negroes in the Navy, but there were\r\nespecially too few in the general service and practically no black\r\nofficers, a series of statistics that made the predominately black and\r\nseparate stewards more conspicuous. The Navy rejected an obvious\r\nsolution, lowering recruitment standards, contending that it could not\r\nrun its ships and aircraft with men who scored below ninety in the\r\ngeneral classification test.[9-57] The alternative was to recruit among\r\nthe increasing numbers of educated Negroes, as the personnel bureau\r\nhad been trying to do. But here, as Nelson and others could report,\r\nthe Navy faced severe competition from other employers, and here the\r\nNavy's public image had its strongest effect.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-57: For discussion of the problem of\r\n                   comparative enlistment standards, see Chapter 12.]\r\n\r\nLt. Comdr. Edward Hope, a black reserve officer assigned to officer\r\nprocurement, concluded that the black community, especially veterans,\r\ndistrusted all the services. Consequently, Negroes tended to disregard\r\nannounced plans and policies applicable to all citizens unless they\r\nwere specially labeled \"for colored.\" Negroes tried to avoid the\r\nhumiliation of applying for certain rights or benefits only to be\r\narbitrarily rejected.[9-58] Compounding the suspicion and fear of\r\nhumiliation, Hope reported, was a genuine lack of information on Navy\r\npolicy that seriously limited the number of black applicants.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-58: Ltr, Lt Cmdr, E. S. Hope to SecDef,\r\n                   17 May 48, with attached rpt, D54-1-10,\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of confusion among black students over Navy policy was easy\r\nto pinpoint, for memories of the frustrations and insults suffered by\r\nblack seamen during the war were still fresh. Negroes remembered the\r\nlabor battalions bossed by whites--much like the old plantation\r\nsystem, Lester Granger observed. Unlike the Army, the Navy had offered\r\nfew black enlisted men the chance of serving in vital jobs under black\r\ncommanders. This slight, according to Granger, robbed the black sailor\r\nof pride in service, a pride that could hardly be restored by the\r\npostwar image of the black sailor not as a fighting man but as\r\na servant or laborer. Always a loyal member of the Navy team,      (p. 252)\r\nGranger was anxious to improve the Navy's public image in the black\r\ncommunity, and he and others often advanced plans for doing so.[9-59]\r\nBut any discussion of image quickly foundered on one point: the Navy\r\nwould remain suspect in the eyes of black youth and be condemned by\r\ncivil rights leaders as long as it retained that symbol of racism, the\r\nracially separate Steward's Branch.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 9-59: See, for example, Ltr, Granger to\r\n                   SecNav, 10 Jun 47, 54-1-13, Forrestal file,\r\n                   GenRecsNav, and Granger's extensive comments and\r\n                   questions at the National Defense Conference on\r\n                   Negro Affairs, 26 Apr 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBMARINER.]\r\n\r\nHere the practical need for change ran headlong into strong military\r\ntradition. An integrated general service was traditional and therefore\r\nacceptable; an integrated servants' branch was not. Faced with the\r\nchoice of a small number of Negroes in the Navy and the attendant\r\ncharges of racism or a change in its traditions, the Navy accepted the\r\nformer. Lack of interest on the part of the black community was not a\r\nparticularly pressing problem for the Navy in the immediate postwar\r\nyears. Indeed, it might well have been a source of comfort for the\r\nmilitary traditionalists who, armed with an unassailable integration\r\npolicy, could still enjoy a Navy little changed from its prewar\r\ncondition. Nevertheless, the lack of black volunteers for general\r\nservice was soon to be discussed by a presidential commission, and in\r\nthe next fifteen years would become a pressing problem when the Navy,\r\nthe first service with a policy of integration, would find itself\r\nrunning behind in the race to attract minority members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10                                                         (p. 253)\r\n\r\nThe Postwar Marine Corps\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the Army and Navy, the all-white Marine Corps seemed to\r\nconsider the wartime enlistment of over 19,000 Negroes a temporary\r\naberration. Forced by the Navy's nondiscrimination policy to retain\r\nNegroes after the war, Marine Corps officials at first decided on a\r\nblack representation of some 2,200 men, roughly the same proportion as\r\nduring the war. But the old tradition of racial exclusion remained\r\nstrong, and this figure was soon reduced. The corps also ignored the\r\nNavy's integration measures, adopting instead a pattern of segregation\r\nthat Marine officials claimed was a variation on the Army's historic\r\n\"separate but equal\" black units. In fact, separation was real enough\r\nin the postwar corps; equality remained elusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Racial Quotas and Assignments_\r\n\r\nThe problem was that any \"separate but equal\" race policy, no matter\r\nhow loosely enforced, was incompatible with the corps' postwar\r\nmanpower resources and mission and would conflict with its\r\ndetermination to restrict black units to a token number. The dramatic\r\nmanpower reductions of 1946 were felt immediately in the two major\r\nelements of the Marine Corps. The Fleet Marine Force, the main\r\noperating unit of the corps and usually under control of the Chief of\r\nNaval Operations, retained three divisions, but lost a number of its\r\ncombat battalions. The divisions kept a few organic and attached\r\nservice and miscellaneous units. Under such severe manpower\r\nrestrictions, planners could not reserve one of the large organic\r\nelements of these divisions for black marines, thus leaving the\r\nsmaller attached and miscellaneous units as the only place to\r\naccommodate self-contained black organizations. At first the Plans and\r\nPolicies Division decided to assign roughly half the black marines to\r\nthe Fleet Marine Force. Of these some were slated for an antiaircraft\r\nartillery battalion at Montford Point which would provide training as\r\nwell as an opportunity for Negroes' overseas to be rotated home.\r\nOthers were placed in three combat service groups and one service\r\ndepot where they would act as divisional service troops, and the rest\r\nwent into 182 slots, later increased to 216, for stewards, the\r\nmajority in aviation units.\r\n\r\nThe other half of the black marines was to be absorbed by the so\r\ncalled non-Fleet Marine Force, a term used to cover training,\r\nsecurity, and miscellaneous Marine units, all noncombat, which\r\nnormally remained under the control of the commandant. This part of\r\nthe corps was composed of many small and usually self-contained units,\r\nbut in a number of activities, particularly in the logistical\r\nestablishment and the units afloat, reductions in manpower would   (p. 254)\r\nnecessitate considerable sharing of living and working facilities,\r\nthus making racial separation impossible. The planners decided,\r\ntherefore, to limit black assignments outside the Fleet Marine Force\r\nto naval ammunition depots at McAlester, Oklahoma, and Earle, New\r\nJersey, where Negroes would occupy separate barracks; to Guam and\r\nSaipan, principally as antiaircraft artillery; and to a small training\r\ncadre at Montford Point. Eighty stewards would also serve with units\r\noutside the Fleet Marine Force. With the exception of the depot at\r\nEarle, all these installations had been assigned Negroes during the\r\nwar. Speaking in particular about the assignment of Negroes to\r\nMcAlester, the Director of the Plans and Policies Division, Brig. Gen.\r\nGerald C. Thomas, commented that \"this has proven to be a satisfactory\r\nlocation and type of duty for these personnel.\"[10-1] Thomas's\r\nconception of \"satisfactory\" duty for Negroes became the corps'\r\nrationale for its postwar assignment policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-1: Memos, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 25 Sep and 17 Oct 46, sub: Post War\r\n                   Personnel Requirements, A0-1, MC files.

The policy of\r\ntying the number of Negroes to the number of available, appropriate\r\nslots also meant that the number of black marines, and consequently\r\nthe acceptability of black volunteers, was subject to chronic\r\nfluctuation. More important, it permitted if not encouraged further\r\nrestrictions on the use of the remaining black marines who had combat\r\ntraining, thereby allowing the traditionalists to press for a\r\nsegregated service in which the few black marines would be mostly\r\nservants and laborers.\r\n\r\nThe process of reordering the assignment of black marines began just\r\neleven weeks after the commandant approved the staff's postwar policy\r\nrecommendations. Informing the commandant on 6 January 1947 that\r\n\"several changes have been made in concepts upon which such        (p. 255)\r\nplanning was based,\" General Thomas explained that the requirement for\r\nantiaircraft artillery units at Guam and Saipan had been canceled,\r\nalong with the plan for maintaining an artillery unit at Montford\r\nPoint. Because of the cancellation his division wanted to reduce the\r\nnumber of black marines to 1,500. These men could be assigned to depot\r\ncompanies, service units, and Marine barracks--all outside the Fleet\r\nMarine Force--or they could serve as stewards. The commandant's\r\napproval of this plan reduced the number of Negroes in the corps by 35\r\npercent, or 700 men. Coincidental with this reduction was a 17 percent\r\nrise in spaces for black stewards to 350.[10-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-2: Memo, G. C. Thomas, Div of Plans and\r\n                   Policies, for CMC, 6 Jan 47, sub: Negro\r\n                   Requirements, A0-1.]\r\n\r\nApproval of this plan eliminated the last Negroes from combat\r\nassignments, a fact that General Thomas suggested could be justified\r\nas \"consistent with similar reductions being effected elsewhere in the\r\nCorps.\" But the facts did not support such a palliative. In June 1946\r\nthe corps had some 1,200 men serving in three antiaircraft artillery\r\nbattalions and an antiaircraft artillery group headquarters. In June\r\n1948 the corps still had white antiaircraft artillery units on Guam\r\nand at Camp Lejeune totaling 1,020 men. The drop in numbers was\r\nexplained almost entirely by the elimination of the black units.[10-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-3: USMC Muster Rolls of Officers and\r\n                   Enlisted Men, 1946 and 1948.]\r\n\r\nA further realignment of black assignments occurred in June 1947 when\r\nGeneral Vandegrift approved a Plans and Policies Division decision to\r\nremove more black units from security forces at naval shore\r\nestablishments. The men were reassigned to Montford Point with the\r\nresult that the number of black training and overhead billets at that\r\npost jumped 200 percent--a dubious decision at best considering that\r\nblack specialist and recruit training was virtually at a standstill.\r\nGeneral Thomas took the occasion to advise the commandant that\r\nmaintaining an arbitrary quota of black marines was no longer a\r\nconsideration since a reduction in their strength could be \"adequately\r\njustified\" by the general manpower reductions throughout the corps.[10-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-4: Memo, G. C. Thomas for CMC, 11 Jun 47,\r\n                   sub: Negro Requirements and Assignments, A0-1.]\r\n\r\nActually the Marine Corps was not as free to reduce the quota of 1,500\r\nNegroes as General Thomas suggested. To make further cuts in what was\r\nat most a token representation, approximately 1 percent of the corps\r\nin August 1947, would further inflame civil rights critics and might\r\nwell provoke a reaction from Secretary Forrestal. Even Thomas's\r\naccompanying recommendation carefully retained the black strength\r\nfigure previously agreed upon and actually raised the number of\r\nNegroes in the ground forces by seventy-six men. The 1,500-man minimum\r\nquota for black enlistment survived the reorganization of the Fleet\r\nMarine Force later in 1947, and the Plans and Policies Division even\r\nfound it necessary to locate some 375 more billets for Negroes to\r\nmaintain the figure. In August the commandant approved plans to add\r\n100 slots for stewards and 275 general duty billets overseas, the\r\nlatter to facilitate rotation and provide a broader range of\r\nassignments for Negroes.[10-5] Only once before the Korean War,    (p. 256)\r\nand then only briefly, did the authorized strength of Negroes\r\ndrop below the 1,500 mark, although because of recruitment lags actual\r\nnumbers never equaled authorized strength.[10-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-5: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 28 Aug 47, sub: Requirements for General\r\n                   Duty Negro Marines, A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-6: Idem for Div, Pub Info, 10 Nov 48,\r\n                   sub: Information Relating to Negro Marines, A0-1.]\r\n\r\nBy mid-1947, therefore, the Marine Corps had abandoned its complex\r\nsystem of gearing the number of black marines to available assignments\r\nand, like the Army and the Air Force, had adopted a racial quota--but\r\nwith an important distinction. Although they rarely achieved it, the\r\nArmy and the Air Force were committed to accepting a fixed percentage\r\nof Negroes; in an effort to avoid the problems with manpower\r\nefficiency plaguing the other services, the Marine Corps established a\r\nstraight _numerical_ quota. Authorized black strength would remain at\r\nabout 1,500 men until the Korean War. During that same period the\r\nactual percentage of Negroes in the Marine Corps almost doubled,\r\nrising from 1.3 percent of the 155,679-man corps in June 1946 to\r\nslightly more than 2 percent of the 74,279-man total in June 1950.[10-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-7: Unless otherwise noted, statistics in\r\n                   this section are from NA Pers, 15658 (A), _Report,\r\n                   Navy and Marine Corps Military Statistics_, 30 Jun\r\n                   59, BuPers. Official figures on black marines are\r\n                   from reports of the USMC Personnel Accounting\r\n                   Section.]\r\n\r\nYet neither the relatively small size of the Marine Corps nor the fact\r\nthat few black marines were enrolled could conceal the inefficiency of\r\nsegregation. Over the next three years the personnel planning staff\r\ntried to find a solution to the problem of what it considered to be\r\ntoo many Negroes in the general service. First it began to reduce\r\ngradually the number of black units accommodated in the Operating\r\nForce Plan, absorbing the excess black marines by increasing the\r\nnumber of stewards. This course was not without obvious public\r\nrelations disadvantages, but they were offset somewhat by the fact\r\nthat the Marine Corps, unlike the Navy, never employed a majority of\r\nits black recruits as stewards. In May 1948 the commandant approved\r\nnew plans for a 10 percent decrease in the number of general duty\r\nassignments and a corresponding increase in spaces for stewards.[10-8]\r\nThe trend away from assigning Negroes to general service duty\r\ncontinued until the Korean War, and in October 1949 a statistical high\r\npoint was reached when some 33 percent of all black marines were\r\nserving as stewards. The doctrine that all marines were potential\r\ninfantrymen stood, but it was small comfort to civil rights activists\r\nwho feared that what at best was a nominal black representation in the\r\ncorps was being pushed into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-8: Memo, Dir, Plans and Policies Div, for\r\n                   CMC, 20 May 48, sub: Procurement and Assignment of\r\n                   Negro Enlisted Personnel, A0-1.]\r\n\r\nBut they had little to fear since the number of Negroes that could be\r\nabsorbed in the Steward's Branch was limited. In the end the Marine\r\nCorps still had to accommodate two-thirds of its black strength in\r\ngeneral duty billets, a course with several unpalatable consequences.\r\nFor one, Negroes would be assigned to new bases reluctant to accept\r\nthem and near some communities where they would be unwelcome. For\r\nanother, given the limitations in self-contained units, there was the\r\npossibility of introducing some integration in the men's living or\r\nworking arrangements. Certainly black billets would have to be created\r\nat the expense of white billets. The Director of Plans and Policies\r\nwarned in August 1947 that the reorganization of the Fleet Marine  (p. 257)\r\nForce, then under way, failed to allocate spaces for some 350 Negroes\r\nwith general duty contracts. While he anticipated some reduction in\r\nthis number as a result of the campaign to attract volunteers for the\r\nSteward's Branch, he admitted that many would remain unassigned and\r\nbeyond anticipating a reduction in the black \"overage\" through\r\nattrition, his office had no long-range plans for creating the needed\r\nspaces.[10-9] When the attrition failed to materialize, the commandant\r\nwas forced in December 1949 to redesignate 202 white billets for black\r\nmarines with general duty contracts.[10-10] The problem of finding\r\nrestricted assignments for black marines in the general service lasted\r\nuntil it was overtaken by the manpower demands of the Korean War.\r\nMeanwhile to the consternation of the civil rights advocates, as the\r\ncorps' definition of \"suitable\" assignment became more exact, the\r\nvariety of duties to which Negroes could be assigned seemed to\r\ndecrease.[10-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-9: Ibid., 28 Aug 47, sub: Requirements\r\n                   for General Duty Negro Marines, A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-10: Ibid., 14 Nov 49, sub: Designation of\r\n                   Units for Assignment of Negro Marines, A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-11: For criticism of assignment\r\n                   restrictions, see comments and questions at the\r\n                   National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26\r\n                   Apr 48 (afternoon session), pp. 1-10, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recruitment_\r\n\r\nPostwar quotas and assignments for Negroes did nothing to curb the\r\nblack community's growing impatience with separate and limited\r\nopportunities, a fact brought home to Marine Corps recruiters when\r\nthey tried to enlist the Negroes needed to fill their quota. At first\r\nit seemed the traditionalists would regain their all-white corps by\r\ndefault. The Marine Corps had ceased drafting men in November 1945 and\r\nlaunched instead an intensive recruiting campaign for regular marines\r\nfrom among the thousands of reservists about to be discharged and\r\nregulars whose enlistments would soon expire. Included in this group\r\nwere some 17,000 Negroes from among whom the corps planned to recruit\r\nits black contingent. To charges that it was discriminating in the\r\nenlistment of black civilians, the corps readily admitted that no new\r\nrecruits were being accepted because preference was being given to men\r\nalready in the corps.[10-12] In truth, the black reservists were\r\nrejecting the blandishments of recruiters in overwhelming numbers. By\r\nMay 1946 only 522 Negroes, less than a quarter of the small postwar\r\nblack complement, had enlisted in the regular service.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-12: G-1, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   Operational Diary, Sep 45-Oct 46, 23 Apr 47; Memo,\r\n                   Dir of Personnel (Div of Recruiting) for Off in\r\n                   Charge, Northeastern Recruiting Div, 17 Jan 46,\r\n                   sub: Enlistment of Negro Ex-Marines, MC 706577. See\r\n                   also _Afro-American_, February 16, 1946.]\r\n\r\nThe failure to attract recruits was particularly noticeable in the\r\nantiaircraft battalions. To obtain black replacements for these\r\ncritically depleted units, the commandant authorized the recruitment\r\nof reservists who had served less than six months, but the measure\r\nfailed to produce the necessary manpower. On 28 February 1946 the\r\ncommanding general of Camp Lejeune reported that all but seven Negroes\r\non his antiaircraft artillery roster were being processed for\r\ndischarge.[10-13] Since this list included the black noncommissioned\r\ninstructors, the commander warned that future training of black    (p. 258)\r\nmarines would entail the use of officers as instructors. The\r\nprecipitous loss of black artillerymen forced Marine headquarters to\r\nassign white specialists as temporary replacements in the heavy\r\nantiaircraft artillery groups at Guam and Saipan, both designated as\r\nblack units in the postwar organization.[10-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-13: Msg, CMC to CG, Cp Lejeune, 19 Feb\r\n                   46, MC 122026; Memo, CG, Cp Lejeune, for CMC, 28\r\n                   Feb 46, sub: Personnel and Equipment for\r\n                   Antiaircraft Artillery Training Battalion\r\n                   (Colored), Availability of, RPS-1059, MC files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-14: Memo, G.

The failure of black marines to reenlist\r\nwas the subject of many newspaper and journal articles. The reason for\r\nthe phenomenon advanced by the Norfolk _Journal and Guide_ would be\r\nrepeated by civil rights spokesmen on numerous occasions in the era\r\nbefore integration. The paper declared that veterans remembered their\r\nwartime experiences and were convinced that the same distasteful\r\npractices would be continued after the war.[10-15] Marine Corps officials\r\nadvanced different reasons. The Montford Point commander attributed\r\nslow enlistment rates to a general postwar letdown and lack of\r\npublicity, explaining that Montford Point \"had an excellent athletic\r\nprogram, good chow and comfortable barracks.\" A staff member of the\r\nDivision of Plans and Policies later prepared a lengthy analysis of\r\nthe treatment the Marine Corps had received in the black press. He\r\ncharged that the press had presented a distorted picture of conditions\r\nfaced by blacks that had \"agitated\" the men and turned them against\r\nreenlistment. He recommended a public relations campaign at Montford\r\nPoint to improve the corps' image.[10-16] But this analysis missed the\r\npoint, for while the black press might influence civilians, it could\r\nhardly instruct Marine veterans. Probably more than any other factor,\r\nthe wartime treatment of black marines explained the failure of the\r\ncorps to attract qualified, let alone gifted, Negroes to its postwar\r\njunior enlisted ranks.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-15: Norfolk _Journal and Guide_, May 4,\r\n                   1946.

Aug 55).]\r\n\r\nConsidering the critical shortages, temporarily and \"undesirably\" made\r\nup for by white marines, and the \"leisurely\" rate at which black\r\nreservists were reenlisting, General Thomas recommended in May 1946\r\nthat the corps recruit some 1,120 Negroes from civilian sources. This,\r\nhe explained to the commandant, would accelerate black enlistment but\r\nstill save some spaces for black reservists.[10-17] The commandant\r\nagreed,[10-18] and contrary to the staff's expectations, most Negroes in\r\nthe postwar service were new recruits. The mass departure of World (p. 259)\r\nWar II veterans eloquently expressed the attitude of experienced black\r\nservicemen toward the Marines' racial policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-17: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 3 May 46, sub: Enlisting of Negroes in the\r\n                   Marine Corps From Civilian Sources, A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-18: Ibid., 23 Oct 46, sub: Enlistment of\r\n                   Negroes, 1335-110; Memo, CMC to Off in Charge,\r\n                   Northeastern Recruiting Div, et al., 23 Oct 46,\r\n                   sub: Negro First Enlistments, Quota for Month of\r\n                   November, 1946, AP-1231.

When in mid-1947\r\nthe Division of Plans and Policies was looking for ways to reduce the\r\nnumber of black marines in keeping with the modified manpower ceiling,\r\nit discovered that if offered the opportunity about one-third of all\r\nNegroes would apply for discharge. An even higher percentage of\r\ndischarge requests was expected from among black marines overseas. The\r\ncommandant agreed to make the offer, except to the stewards, and in\r\nthe next six months black strength dropped by 700 men.[10-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-19: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 28 May 47, sub: Program for Accelerated\r\n                   Attrition of Negro Marines, A0-1; Maj S.

He wanted the offer published at\r\nall separation centers and a training program for stewards instituted\r\nat Camp Lejeune.[10-20] General Vandegrift approved the proposal, but a\r\nmonth later the commander of Camp Lejeune reported that only three\r\nreservists and one regular had volunteered.[10-21] He advised the\r\ncommandant to authorize recruitment among qualified civilians. Faced\r\nwith wholesale rejection of such duty by black marines, General Thomas\r\nin March 1947 opened the Steward's Branch to Negroes with previous\r\nmilitary service in any of the armed forces and qualifications for\r\nsuch work.[10-22] This ploy also proved a failure. Looking for 250\r\nstewards, the recruiters could find but one acceptable applicant in\r\nthe first weeks of the program. Retreating still further, the\r\ncommandant canceled the requirement for previous military service in\r\nApril, and in October dropped the requirement for \"clearly established\r\nqualifications.\"[10-23] Apparently the staff would take a chance on any\r\nwarm body.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-20: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 12 Mar 46, sub: Steward's Branch\r\n                   Personnel, Information Concerning, A0-3, MC files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-21: Ltr, CG, Cp Lejeune, to CMC, 4 Apr\r\n                   46, sub: Steward's Branch Personnel, 060105.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-22: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 18 Mar 47, sub: Enlistment of Negro\r\n                   Personnel, 01A7647.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-23: Ibid., 16 Apr 47, sub: First\r\n                   Enlistment of Negro Personnel, A0-1, and 9 Oct 47,\r\n                   sub: Procurement and Assignment of Stewards\r\n                   Personnel, Box 1515-30; Ltr, CMC (Div of\r\n                   Recruiting) to Off in Charge, Northeastern\r\n                   Recruiting Div, 29 Apr 47, sub: Negro First\r\n                   Enlistments, 07A11947.]\r\n\r\nIn dropping the requirement for prior military service, the corps\r\nintroduced a complication. Recruits for steward duty would be obliged\r\nto undergo basic training and their enlistment contracts would read\r\n\"general duty\"; Navy regulations required that subsequent\r\nreclassification to \"stewards duty only\" status had to be made at the\r\nrequest of the recruit. In August 1947 three men enlisted under the\r\nfirst enlistment program for stewards refused to execute a change of\r\nenlistment contract after basic training.[10-24] Although these men could\r\nhave been discharged \"for the good of the service,\" the commandant (p. 260)\r\ndecided not to contest their right to remain in the general service.\r\nThis action did not go unnoticed, and in subsequent months a number of\r\nmen who signed up with the intention of becoming stewards refused to\r\nmodify their enlistment contract while others, who already had changed\r\ntheir contract, suddenly began to fail the qualifying tests for\r\nstewards school.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-24: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 15 Sep 47, sub: Disposition of Negro\r\n                   Personnel Who Enlisted With a View Toward\r\n                   Qualifying for Stewards Duties..., 01A25847.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of filling the quota became even more distant when in\r\nSeptember 1947 the number of steward billets was increased to 380.\r\nSince only 57 stewards had signed up in the past twelve months,\r\nrecruiters now had to find some 200 men, at least 44 per month for the\r\nimmediate future. The commandant, furthermore, approved plans to\r\nincrease the number of stewards to 420. In December the Plans and\r\nPolicies Division, conceding defeat, recommended that the commandant\r\narrange for the transfer of 175 men from the Navy's oversubscribed\r\nSteward's Branch. At the same time, to overcome what the division's\r\nnew director, Brig. Gen. Ray A. Robinson, called \"the onus attached to\r\nservant type duties,\" the commandant was induced to approve a plan\r\nmaking the rank and pay of stewards comparable to those of general\r\nduty personnel.[10-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-25: Ibid., 26 Dec 47, sub: Procurement of\r\n                   Steward Personnel, A0-1; see also Ltr, CMC to Chief\r\n                   of Naval Personnel, 6 Jan 48, sub: Discharge of\r\n                   Steward Personnel From Navy to Enlist in the Marine\r\n                   Corps, MC 967879; Memo, Chief of Naval Personnel\r\n                   for CMC, 28 Jan 48, sub: Discharge of Certain\r\n                   Steward Branch Personnel for Purpose of Enlistment\r\n                   in the Marine Corps.]\r\n\r\nThese measures seemed to work. The success of the transfer program and\r\nthe fact that first enlistments had finally begun to balance\r\ndischarges led the recruiters to predict in March 1948 that their\r\nsteward quota would soon be filled. Unfortunately, success tempted the\r\nplanners to overreach themselves. Assured of a full steward quota,\r\nGeneral Robinson recommended that approval be sought from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy to establish closed messes, along with the\r\nrequisite steward billets, at the shore quarters for bachelor officers\r\noverseas.[10-26] Approval brought another rise in the number of steward\r\nbillets, this time to 580, and required a first-enlistment goal of\r\ntwenty men per month.[10-27] The new stewards, however, were not\r\nforthcoming. After three months of recruiting the corps had netted ten\r\nmen, more than offset by trainees who failed to qualify for steward\r\nschool. Concluding that the failures represented to a great extent a\r\nscheme to remain in general service and evade the ceiling on general\r\nenlistment, the planners wanted the men failing to qualify discharged\r\n\"for the good of the service.\"[10-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-26: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 19 Mar 48, sub: Procurement and\r\n                   Distribution of Steward Personnel, A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-27: Ibid., 12 Aug 48, sub: Steward\r\n                   Personnel, Allowances and Procurement, A0-1; Ltr,\r\n                   CMC to CG, Marine Barracks, Cp Lejeune, 16 Aug 48,\r\n                   sub: Negro Recruits, 01A22948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-28: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 15 Oct 48, sub: Disposition of Negro\r\n                   Personnel Who Enlist \"For Steward Duty Only\" and\r\n                   Subsequently Fail to Qualify for Such Duty, Study\r\n                   #169-48; Ltr, QMG of MC to CMC, 17 Sep 48, same\r\n                   sub, CA6.]\r\n\r\nThe lack of recruits for steward duty and constant pressure by\r\nstewards for transfer to general duty troubled the Marine Corps\r\nthroughout the postwar period. Reviewing the problem in December\r\n1948, the commanding general of Camp Lejeune saw three causes:     (p. 261)\r\n\"agitation from civilian sources,\" which labeled steward duty\r\ndegrading servant's work; lack of rapid promotion; and badgering from\r\nblack marines on regular duty.[10-29] But the commander's solution--a\r\npublic relations campaign using black recruits to promote the\r\nattractions of steward duty along with a belated promise of more rapid\r\npromotion--failed. It ignored the central issue, the existence of a\r\nsegregated branch in which black marines performed menial, nonmilitary\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-29: Msg, CG, Cp Lejeune, N.C., to CMC, 31\r\n                   Dec 48.]\r\n\r\nHeadquarters later resorted to other expedients. It obtained\r\nseventy-five more men from the Navy and lowered the qualification test\r\nstandards for steward duty. But like earlier efforts, these steps also\r\nfailed to produce enough men.[10-30] Ironically, while the corps aroused\r\nthe ire of the civil rights groups by maintaining a segregated\r\nservants' branch, it was never able to attract a sufficient number of\r\nstewards to fill its needs in the postwar period.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-30: Memo, Chief of Naval Personnel and\r\n                   CMC for All Ships and Stations, 28 Feb 49, sub:\r\n                   Discharge of Stewards, USN, For the Purpose of\r\n                   Immediate Enlistment in Marine Corps, Pers-66,\r\n                   GenRecsNav; Memo, CMC for Dir of Recruiting, 25 Feb\r\n                   49, sub: Mental Requirements for Enlistment for\r\n                   \"Steward Duty Only,\" A0-1; Ltr, CMC (Div of\r\n                   Recruiting) to Off in Charge, Northeastern\r\n                   Recruiting Div, 3 Mar 49, sub: Mental Standards for\r\n                   Enlistment for Steward Duty Only, MC1088081; Msg,\r\n                   CMC to Div of Recruiting, 7 Apr 49.]\r\n\r\nMany of the corps' critics saw in the buildup of the Steward's Branch\r\nthe first step in an attempt to eliminate Negroes from the general\r\nservice. If such a scheme had ever been contemplated, it was\r\nremarkably unsuccessful, for the corps would enter the Korean War with\r\nmost of its Negroes still in the general service. Nevertheless, the\r\napprehension of the civil rights advocates was understandable because\r\nduring most of the postwar period enlistment in the general service\r\nwas barred to Negroes or limited to a very small number of men. Closed\r\nto Negroes in early 1947, enlistment was briefly reopened at the rate\r\nof forty men per month later that year to provide the few hundred\r\nextra men called for in the reorganization of the Operating Force\r\nPlan.[10-31] Enlistment was again opened in May 1948 when the recruiting\r\noffice established a monthly quota for black recruits at ten men for\r\ngeneral duty and eight for the Steward's Branch. The figure for\r\nstewards quickly rose to thirty per month, but effective 1 May 1949\r\nthe recruitment of Negroes for general service was closed.[10-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-31: Memo, CMC for CG, Marine Barracks, Cp\r\n                   Lejeune, N.C., 8 Dec 47, sub: Negro Recruits,\r\n                   01A33847.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-32: Ltr, CMC to CG, Cp Lejeune, 24 May\r\n                   48, A0-1; Memo, CMC for Off in Charge of Recruiting\r\n                   Div, 29 Jan 49, sub: Enlistment of Negroes,\r\n                   07D14848; Msg, CMC to Offs in Charge of Recruiting\r\n                   Divs, 25 Apr 49.]\r\n\r\nThese rapid changes, indeed the whole pattern of black enlistment in\r\nthe postwar Marine Corps, demonstrated that the staff's manpower\r\npractices were out of joint with the times. Not only did they invite\r\nattack from the increasingly vocal civil rights forces, but they also\r\nfostered a general distrust among black marines themselves and among\r\nthose young Negroes the corps hoped to attract.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Segregation and Efficiency_\r\n\r\nThe assignment policies and recruitment practices of the corps were\r\nthe inevitable result of its segregation policy. Prejudice and\r\ndiscrimination no doubt aggravated the situation, but the policy of\r\nseparation limited the ways Negroes could be employed and places   (p. 262)\r\nto which they might be assigned. Segregation explained, for example,\r\nwhy Negroes were traditionally employed in certain types of combat\r\nunits, and why, when changing missions and manpower restrictions\r\ncaused a reduction in the number of such units, Negroes were not given\r\nother combat assignments. Most Negroes with combat military\r\noccupational specialties served in defense battalions during World War\r\nII. These units, chiefly antiaircraft artillery, were self-contained\r\nand could therefore be segregated; at the same time they cloaked a\r\nlarge group of men with the dignity of a combat assignment. But what\r\nwas possible during the war was no longer practical and efficient in\r\nthe postwar period. Some antiaircraft artillery units survived the\r\nwar, but they no longer operated as battalions and were divided\r\ninstead into battery-size organizations that simply could not be\r\nsegregated in terms of support and recreational facilities. In fact,\r\nthe corps found it impossible after the war to maintain segregation in\r\nany kind of combat unit.\r\n\r\nEven if segregated service had been possible, the formation of\r\nall-black antiaircraft artillery battalions would have been precluded\r\nby the need of this highly technical branch for so many kinds of\r\ntrained specialists. Not only would separate training facilities for\r\nthe few Negroes in the peacetime corps be impossibly expensive and\r\ninefficient, but not enough black recruits were eligible for such\r\ntraining. A wartime comparison of the General Classification Test and\r\nMechanical Aptitude Test scores of the men in the 52d Defense\r\nBattalion with those of men in two comparable white units showed the\r\nNegroes averaging considerably lower than the whites.[10-33] It was\r\nreasonable to expect this difference to continue since, on the whole,\r\nblack recruits were scoring lower than their World War II\r\ncounterparts.[10-34] Under current policies, therefore, the Marine Corps\r\nsaw little choice but to exclude Negroes from antiaircraft artillery\r\nand other combat units.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-33: Ltr, CO, 52d Defense Battalion, to\r\n                   CMC, 15 Jan 46, sub: Employment of Colored\r\n                   Personnel as Antiaircraft Artillery Troops,\r\n                   Recommendations on, 02-46, MC files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-34: Memo, Dir of Personnel for Dir, Div\r\n                   of Plans and Policies, 21 Jul 48, sub: General\r\n                   Classification Test Scores of Colored Enlisted\r\n                   Marines, 07DZ0348. The GCT distribution of 991\r\n                   black marines as of 1 March 1948 was as follows:\r\n                   Group I (130-163), 0%; Group II (110-129), 4.94%;\r\n                   Group III (90-109), 24.7%; Group IV (60-89),\r\n                   61.45%; and Group V (42-59), 9.54%. Memo, Dir of\r\n                   Personnel to Dir, Div of Plans and Policies, 30 May\r\n                   48, sub: Marines--Tests and Testing.]\r\n\r\nObviously the corps had in its ranks some Negroes capable of\r\nperforming any task required in an artillery battalion. Yet because\r\nthe segregation policy demanded that there be enough qualified men to\r\nform and sustain a whole black battalion, the abilities of these\r\nhigh-scoring individuals were wasted. On the other hand, many billets\r\nin antiaircraft artillery or other types of combat battalions could be\r\nfilled by men with low test scores, but less gifted black marines were\r\nexcluded because they had to be assigned to one of the few black\r\nunits. Segregation, in short, was doubly inefficient, it kept both\r\nable and inferior Negroes out of combat units that were perpetually\r\nshort of men.\r\n\r\nSegregation also promoted inefficiency in the placement of black\r\nMarine units. While the assignment of an integrated unit with a few\r\nblack marines would probably go unnoticed in most naval\r\ndistricts--witness the experience of the Navy itself--the task of  (p. 263)\r\nfinding a naval district and an American community where a large\r\nsegregated group of black marines could be peacefully assimilated was\r\ninfinitely more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe original postwar racial program called for the assignment of black\r\nsecurity units to the Marine Barracks at McAlester, Oklahoma, and\r\nEarle, New Jersey. Noting that the station was in a strict Jim Crow\r\narea where recreational facilities for Negroes were limited and\r\ndistant, the commanding officer of the Marine Barracks at McAlester\r\nrecommended that no Negroes be assigned. He reminded the commandant\r\nthat guard duty required marines to question and apprehend white\r\ncivilian employees, a fact that would add to the racial tension in the\r\narea. His conclusions, no doubt shared by commanders in many parts of\r\nthe country, summed up the problem of finding assignments for black\r\nmarines: any racial incident which might arise out of disregard for\r\nlocal racial custom, he wrote,\r\n\r\n     would cause the Marine Corps to become involved by protecting\r\n     such personnel as required by Federal law and Navy Regulations.\r\n     It is believed that if one such potential incident occurred, it\r\n     would seriously jeopardize the standing of the Marine Corps\r\n     throughout the Southwest. To my way of thinking, the Marine Corps\r\n     is not now maintaining the high esteem of public opinion, or\r\n     gaining in prestige, by the manner in which its uniform and\r\n     insignia are subjected to such laws. The uniform does not count,\r\n     it is relegated to the background and made to participate in and\r\n     suffer the restrictions and limitations placed upon it by virtue\r\n     of the wearer being subject to the Jim Crow laws.[10-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-35: Ltr, CO, MB, NAD, McAlester, Okla.,\r\n                   to CMC, 5 Nov 46, sub: Assignment of Colored\r\n                   Marines, 2385.]\r\n\r\nThe commander of the McAlester ammunition depot endorsed this\r\nrecommendation, adding that Oklahoma was a \"border\" state where the\r\nNegro was not accepted as in the north nor understood and tolerated as\r\nin the south. This argument moved the Director of Plans and Policies\r\nto recommend that McAlester be dropped and the black unit sent instead\r\nto Port Chicago, California.[10-36] With the approval of the commandant\r\nand the Chief of Naval Operations, plans for the assignment were well\r\nunder way in June 1947 when the commandant of the Twelfth Naval\r\nDistrict intervened.[10-37] The presence of a black unit, he declared,\r\nwas undesirable in a predominantly white area that was experiencing\r\nalmost constant labor turmoil. The possibility of clashes between\r\nwhite pickets and black guards would invite racial conflict. His\r\nwarnings carried the day, and Port Chicago was dropped in favor of the\r\nMarine Barracks, Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, with station at\r\nBayonne, New Jersey. At the same time, because of opposition from\r\nnaval officials, the plan for assigning Negroes to Earle, New Jersey,\r\nwas also dropped, and the commandant launched inquiries about the  (p. 264)\r\ndepots at Hingham, Massachusetts, and Fort Mifflin, Pennsylvania.[10-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-36: Ltr, CO, NAD, McAlester, Okla., to\r\n                   CMC, 5 Nov 46, 1st Ind to Ltr, CO, MB, McAlester,\r\n                   2385; Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies, for\r\n                   CMC, 3 Dec 46, sub: Assignment of Negro Marines to\r\n                   MB, Naval Magazine, Port Chicago, Calif., in lieu\r\n                   of MB, NAD, McAlester, Okla., A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-37: Memo, CMC for CNO, 3 Dec 46, sub:\r\n                   Assignment of Negro Marines to MB, Naval Magazine,\r\n                   Port Chicago, Calif., and MB, NAD, Earle, N.J.,\r\n                   A0-1; idem for CO, MB, NAD, Earle, N.J., 9 Jan 47,\r\n                   sub: Assignment of Colored Marines to Marine\r\n                   Barracks, Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle, N.J.; idem\r\n                   for CO, Department of the Pacific, and CO, MB, NAD,\r\n                   McAlester, Okla., A0-1; Memo, CNO for CMC, 6 Jan\r\n                   47, same sub, OP 30 M.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-38: Speed Ltr, CMC to Cmdt, Twelfth Naval\r\n                   District, 12 Jun 47; Memo, CMC for CO, MB, Naval\r\n                   Shipyard, Brooklyn, N.Y., 13 Jun 47, sub:\r\n                   Assignment of Negro Marines to Second Guard\r\n                   Company, Marine Barracks Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn,\r\n                   N.Y., A0-1; idem for CO, MB, USNAD, Hingham, Mass.,\r\n                   18 Jun 47, sub: Assignment of Negro Marines, A0-1;\r\n                   Speed Ltr, CMC to Cmdt, Twelfth Naval District, 18\r\n                   Jun 47, 01A76847; Memo, CMC for CO, MB, NAD, Ft.\r\n                   Mifflin, Pa., 18 Jun 47, sub: Assignment of Negro\r\n                   Marines, A0-1; Memo, Cmdt, Fourth Naval District\r\n                   for CO, MB, NAD, Ft.

The commanding officer of the naval depot\r\nendorsed these reasons and added that assigning black marines to guard\r\nduty that included vehicle search would create a problem in industrial\r\nrelations.[10-39] The commandant of the First Naval District apparently\r\ndiscounted these arguments, but he too voted against the assignment of\r\nNegroes on the grounds that the Hingham area lacked a substantial\r\nblack population, was largely composed of restricted residential\r\nneighborhoods, and was a major summer resort on which the presence of\r\nblack units would have an adverse effect.[10-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-39: Memo, CO, MB, NAD, Hingham, Mass.,\r\n                   for CMC, 26 Jun 47, sub: Comments on Assignment of\r\n                   Negro Marines, AB-1; Memo, CO, NAD, Hingham, Mass.,\r\n                   for CMC, 26 Jun 47, 1st Ind to AB-1, 26 Jun 47.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-40: Ltr, Cmdt, First Naval District, to\r\n                   CMC, 30 Jun 47, sub: Assignment of Negro Marines,\r\n                   2d Ind to AB-1, 26 Jun 47.]\r\n\r\nThe commander of the Naval Base, New York, meanwhile had refused to\r\napprove a plan to assign a black unit to Bayonne, New Jersey, and\r\nsuggested that it be sent to Earle, New Jersey, instead because there\r\nthe unit \"presented fewer problems and difficulties than at any other\r\nNaval activity.\" The commander noted that stationing Negroes at\r\nBayonne would necessitate a certain amount of integration in mess and\r\nship service facilities. Bayonne was also reputed to have the toughest\r\ngate duty in the New York area, and noncommissioned officers had to\r\nsupervise a white civilian police force. At Earle, on the other hand,\r\nthe facilities were completely separate, and although some complaints\r\nfrom well-to-do summer colonists in the vicinity could be expected,\r\nmen could be bused to Newark or Jersey City for recreation. Moreover,\r\nEarle could absorb a 175-man unit.[10-41] But chief of the Navy's Bureau\r\nof Ordnance wanted to retain white marines at Earle because a recent\r\ndecision to handle ammonium nitrate fertilizer there made it unwise to\r\nrelieve the existing trained detachment. Earle was also using contract\r\nstevedores and expected to be using Army troops whose use of local\r\nfacilities would preclude plans for a segregated barracks and\r\nmess.[10-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-41: Ltr, CO, Naval Base, New York, to\r\n                   CMC, 10 July 47, sub: Assignment of Negro Marines\r\n                   to Second Guard Company, Marine Barracks, New York\r\n                   Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, N.Y., NB-139.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-42: Ltr, Chief, Bur of Ord, to CNO, 11\r\n                   Aug 47, sub: Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle,\r\n                   N.J.--Assignment of Negro Marine Complement,\r\n                   NTI-34.]\r\n\r\nThe commandant accepted these arguments and on 20 August 1947 revoked\r\nthe assignment of a black unit to Earle. Still, with its ability to\r\nabsorb 175 men and its relative suitability in terms of separate   (p. 265)\r\nliving facilities, the depot remained a prime candidate for black\r\nunits, and in November General Vandegrift reversed himself. The Chief\r\nof Naval Operations supported the commandant's decision over the\r\nrenewed objections of the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance.[10-43] With\r\nHingham, Massachusetts, ruled out, the commandant now considered the\r\nsubstitution of Marine barracks at Trinidad, British West Indies;\r\nScotia, New York; and Oahu, Hawaii. He rejected Trinidad in favor of\r\nOahu, and officials in Hawaii proved amenable.[10-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-43: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 19 Nov 47, sub: First Enlistments of Negro\r\n                   Personnel, A0-1; Memo, Chief, Bur of Ord, for CNO,\r\n                   15 Dec 47, sub: Assignment of Negro Marines at\r\n                   Naval Ammunition Depot, Earle, Red Bank, N.J.;\r\n                   Memo, CNO for Chief, Bur of Ord, 6 Jan 48, same\r\n                   sub.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-44: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   29 Jul 47, sub: Negro Requirements and Assignments,\r\n                   A0-1, MC files.]\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Navy's Bureau of Supplies and Accounts objected to\r\nthe use of black marines at the supply depot in Scotia, claiming that\r\nsuch an assignment to the Navy's sole installation in upper New York\r\nState would bring about a \"weakening of the local public relations\r\nadvantage now held by the Navy\" and would be contrary to the Navy's\r\nbest interests. He pointed out that the assignment would necessitate\r\nbilleting white marine graves registration escorts and black marines\r\nin the same squad rooms. The use of black marines for firing squads at\r\nfunerals, he thought, would be \"undesirable.\" He also pointed out that\r\nthe local black population was small, making for extremely limited\r\nrecreational and social opportunities.[10-45] The idea of using Scotia\r\nwith all these attendant inconveniences was quietly dropped, and the\r\nblack marines were finally assigned to Earle, New Jersey; Fort\r\nMifflin, Pennsylvania; and Oahu, Hawaii.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-45: Memo, Chief, Bur of Supplies and\r\n                   Accounts, for CNO, 14 Oct 47, sub: Assignment of\r\n                   Negro Marines, P-16-1; Memo, CNO to CMC, 20 Nov 47,\r\n                   same sub, Op 415 D.]\r\n\r\nApproved on 8 November 1946, the postwar plan to assign black units to\r\nsecurity guard assignments in the United States was not fully put into\r\npractice until 15 August 1948, almost two years later. This episode in\r\nthe history of discrimination against Americans in uniform brought\r\nlittle glory to anyone involved and revealed much about the extent of\r\nrace prejudice in American society. It was an indictment of people in\r\nareas as geographically diverse as Oklahoma, New York, Massachusetts,\r\nand New Jersey who objected to the assignment of black servicemen to\r\ntheir communities. It was also an indictment of a great many\r\nindividual commanders, both in the Navy and Marine Corps, some perhaps\r\nfor personal prejudices, others for so readily bowing to community\r\nprejudices. But most of all the blame must fall on the Marine Corps'\r\npolicy of segregation. Segregation made it necessary to find\r\nassignments for a whole enlisted complement and placed an intolerable\r\nadministrative burden on the corps. The dictum that black marines\r\ncould not deal with white civilians, especially in situations in which\r\nthey would give orders, further limited assignments since such duties\r\nwere routine in any security unit. Thus, bound to a policy that was\r\nneither just nor practical, the commandant spent almost two years\r\ntrying to place four hundred men.\r\n\r\nDespite the obvious inefficiency and discrimination involved, the  (p. 266)\r\ncommandant, General Vandegrift, adamantly defended the Marine\r\nsegregation policy before Secretary of the Navy Forrestal. Wartime\r\nexperience showed, he maintained, oblivious to overwhelming evidence\r\nto the contrary since 1943, \"that the assignment of negro Marines to\r\nseparate units promotes harmony and morale and fosters the competitive\r\nspirit essential to the development of a high esprit.\"[10-46] His stand\r\nwas bound to antagonize the civil rights camp; the black press in\r\nparticular trumpeted the theme that the corps was as full of race\r\ndiscrimination as it had been during the war.[10-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-46: Memo, Gen Vandegrift to SecNav, 25\r\n                   Aug 47, sub: Assignment of Negro Marines, 54-1-29,\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-47: See, for example, the analysis that\r\n                   appeared in the Chicago _Defender_, August 14,\r\n                   1948.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Toward Integration_\r\n\r\nBut even as the commandant defended the segregation policy, the corps\r\nwas beginning to yield to pressure from outside forces and the demands\r\nof military efficiency. The first policy breach concerned black\r\nofficers. Although a proposal for commissions had been rejected when\r\nthe subject was first raised in 1944, three black candidates were\r\naccepted by the officer training school at Quantico in April 1945. One\r\nfailed to qualify on physical and two on scholastic grounds, but they\r\nwere followed by five other Negroes who were still in training on V-J\r\nday. One of this group, Frederick Branch of Charlotte, North Carolina,\r\nelected to stay in training through the demobilization period. He was\r\ncommissioned with his classmates on 10 November 1945 and placed in the\r\ninactive reserves. Meanwhile, three Negroes in the V-12 program\r\ngraduated and received commissions as second lieutenants in the\r\ninactive Marine Corps Reserve. Officer training for all these men was\r\nintegrated.[10-48]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-48: Shaw and Donnelly, _Blacks and the\r\n                   Marine Corps_, pp. 47-48; see also Selective\r\n                   Service System, _Special Groups_ (Monograph 10),\r\n                   I:105.]\r\n\r\nThe first Negro to obtain a regular commission in the Marine Corps was\r\nJohn E. Rudder of Paducah, Kentucky, a Marine veteran and graduate of\r\nthe Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Analyzing the case for the\r\ncommandant in May 1948, the Director of Plans and Policies noted that\r\nthe law did not require the Marine Corps to commission Rudder, but\r\nthat he was only the first of several Negroes who would be applying\r\nfor commissions in the next few years through the Naval Reserve\r\nOfficers' Training Corps. Since the reserve corps program was a vital\r\npart of the plan to expand Marine Corps officer strength, rejecting a\r\ngraduate on account of race, General Robinson warned, might jeopardize\r\nthe entire plan. He thought that Rudder should be accepted for duty.\r\nRudder was appointed a second lieutenant in the Regular Marine Corps\r\non 28 May 1948 and ordered to Quantico for basic schooling.[10-49] In\r\n1949 Lieutenant Rudder resigned. Indicative of the changing civil\r\nrights scene was the apprehension shown by some Marine Corps officials\r\nabout public reaction to the resignation. But although Rudder reported\r\ninstances of discrimination at Quantico--stemming for the most     (p. 267)\r\npart from a lack of military courtesy that amounted to outright\r\nostracism--he insisted his decision to resign was based on personal\r\nreasons and was irreversible. The Director of Public Information was\r\nanxious to release an official version of the resignation,[10-50] but\r\nother voices prevailed, and Rudder's exit from the corps was handled\r\nquietly both at headquarters and in the press.[10-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-49: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 11 May 48, sub: Appointment to\r\n                   Commissioned Rank in the Regular Marine Corps, Case\r\n                   of Midshipman John Earl Rudder, A0-1; see also Dept\r\n                   of Navy Press Release, 25 Aug 48.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-50: Memo, Dir of Public Information for\r\n                   CMC, 11 Feb 49, sub: Publicity on Second Lieutenant\r\n                   John Rudder, USMC, AG 1364; see also Ltr, Lt Cmdr\r\n                   Dennis Nelson to James C.

BRANCH.]\r\n\r\nThe brief active career of one black officer was hardly evidence of a\r\ngreat racial reform, but it represented a significant breakthrough\r\nbecause it affirmed the practice of integrated officer training and\r\nestablished the right of Negroes to command. And Rudder was quickly\r\nfollowed by other black officer candidates, some of whom made careers\r\nin the corps. Rudder's appointment marked a permanent change in Marine\r\nCorps policy.\r\n\r\nEnlistment of black women marked another change. Negroes had been\r\nexcluded from the Women's Reserve during World War II, but in March\r\n1949 A. Philip Randolph asked the commandant, in the name of the\r\nCommittee Against Jim Crow in Military Service and Training, if black\r\nwomen could join the corps. The commandant's reply was short and\r\ndirect: \"If qualified for enlistment, negro women will be accepted on\r\nthe same basis as other applicants.\"[10-52] In September 1949 Annie N.\r\nGraham and Ann E. Lamb reported to Parris Island for integrated\r\ntraining and subsequent assignment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-52: Ltr, A. Philip Randolph to Gen C. B.\r\n                   Cates, 8 Mar 49; Ltr, CMC to Randolph, 10 Mar 49,\r\n                   AW 828.]\r\n\r\nYet another racial change, in the active Marine Corps Reserve, could\r\nbe traced to outside pressure. Until 1947 all black reservists were\r\nassigned to inactive and unpaid volunteer reserve status, and\r\napplications for transfer to active units were usually disapproved by\r\ncommanding officers on grounds that such transfers would cost the unit\r\na loss in whites. Rejections did not halt applications, however, and\r\nin May 1947 the Director of Marine Corps Reserve decided to seek a\r\npolicy decision. While he wanted each commander of an active unit left\r\nfree to decide whether he would take Negroes, the director also wanted\r\nunits with black enlisted men formed in the organized reserve,\r\nall-black voluntary training units recognized, and integrated active\r\nduty training provided for reservists.[10-53] A group of Negroes   (p. 268)\r\nin Chicago had already applied for the formation of a black voluntary\r\ntraining unit.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-53: Memo, Dir, Div of Reserve, for CMC, 6\r\n                   May 47, sub: General Policy Governing Negro\r\n                   Reservists, AF 1271; Ltr, William Griffin to CMC, 3\r\n                   Mar 47; Ltr, Col R. McPate to William Griffin, 11\r\n                   Mar 47.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas, Director of Plans and Policies, was not prepared to go\r\nthe whole way. He agreed that within certain limitations the local\r\ncommander should decide on the integration of black reservists into an\r\nactive unit, and he accepted integrated active duty training. But he\r\nrejected the formation of black units in the organized reserve and the\r\nvoluntary training program; the latter because it would \"inevitably\r\nlead to the necessity for Negro officers and for authorizing drill\r\npay\" in order to avoid charges of discrimination. Although Thomas\r\nfailed to explain why black officers and drill pay were unacceptable\r\nor how rejecting the program would save the corps from charges of\r\ndiscrimination, his recommendations were approved by the commandant\r\nover the objection of the Reserve Division.[10-54] But the Director of\r\nReserves rejoined that volunteer training units were organized under\r\ncorps regulations, the Chicago group had met all the specifications,\r\nand the corps would be subject to just criticism if it refused to form\r\nthe unit. On the other hand, by permitting the formation of some\r\nall-black volunteer units, the corps might satisfy the wish of Negroes\r\nto be a part of the reserve and thus avoid any concerted attempt to\r\nget the corps to form all-black units in the organized reserve.[10-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-54: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 7 May 47, sub: General Policy Governing\r\n                   Negro Reservists, A0-1.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-55: Memo, Dir of Reserve for CMC, 15 May\r\n                   47, sub: General Policy Concerning Negro\r\n                   Reservists, AF 394.]\r\n\r\nAt this point the Division of Plans and Policies offered to\r\ncompromise. General Robinson recommended that when the number of\r\nvolunteers so warranted, the corps should form black units of company\r\nsize or greater, either separate or organic to larger reserve units\r\naround the country. He remained opposed to integrated units,\r\nexplaining that experience proved--he neglected to mention what\r\nexperience, certainly none in the Marine Corps--that integrated units\r\nserved neither the best interests of the individual nor the corps.[10-56]\r\nWhile the commandant's subsequent approval set the stage for the\r\nformation of racially composite units in the reserve, the stipulation\r\nthat the black element be of company size or larger effectively\r\nlimited the degree of reform.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-56: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 1 Mar 48, sub: Enlistment of Negro\r\n                   Ex-Marines in Organized Reserve, A0-1.]\r\n\r\nThe development of composite units in the reserve paralleled a far\r\nmore significant development in the active forces. In 1947 the Marine\r\nCorps began organizing such units along the lines established in the\r\npostwar Army. Like the Army, the corps discovered that maintaining a\r\nquota--even when the quota for the corps meant maintaining a minimum\r\nnumber of Negroes in the service--in a period of shrinking manpower\r\nresources necessitated the creation of new billets for Negroes. At the\r\nsame time it was obviously inefficient to assign combat-trained\r\nNegroes, now surplus with the inactivation of the black defense\r\nbattalions, to black service and supply units when the Fleet Marine\r\nForce battalions were so seriously understrength. Thus the strictures\r\nagainst integration notwithstanding, the corps was forced to begin (p. 269)\r\nattaching black units to the depleted Fleet Marine Force units.\r\nIn January 1947, for example, members of Headquarters Unit, Montford\r\nPoint Camp, and men of the inactivated 3d Antiaircraft Artillery\r\nBattalion were transferred to Camp Geiger, North Carolina, and\r\nassigned to the all-black 2d Medium Depot Company, which, along with\r\neight white units, was organized into the racially composite 2d Combat\r\nService Group in the 2d Marine Division.[10-57] Although the units of the\r\ngroup ate in separate mess halls and slept in separate barracks,\r\ninevitably the men of all units used some facilities in common. After\r\nNegroes were assigned to Camp Geiger, for instance, recreational\r\nfacilities were open to all. In some isolated cases, black\r\nnoncommissioned officers were assigned to lead racially mixed details\r\nin the composite group.[10-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-57: USMC Muster Rolls, 1947.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 10-58: Interv, Martin Blumenson with 1st Sgt\r\n                   Jerome Pressley, 21 Feb 66, CMH files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAINING EXERCISES. _Black Marine unit boards ship at\r\nMorehead City, North Carolina, 1949._]\r\n\r\nBut these reforms, which did very little for a very few men, scarcely\r\ndented the Marine Corps' racial policy. Corps officials were still\r\nfirmly committed to strict segregation in 1948, and change seemed very\r\ndistant. Any substantial modification in racial policy would require a\r\nrevolution against Marine tradition, a movement dictated by higher\r\ncivilian authority or touched off by an overwhelming military need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11                                                         (p. 270)\r\n\r\nThe Postwar Air Force\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air Force was a new service in 1947, but it was also heir to a\r\nlong tradition of segregation. Most of its senior officers, trained in\r\nthe Army, firmly supported the Army's policy of racially separate\r\nunits and racial quotas. And despite continuing objections to what\r\nmany saw as the Gillem Board's far too progressive proposals, the Air\r\nForce adopted the Army's postwar racial policy as its own. Yet after\r\nless than two years as an independent service the Air Force in late\r\n1948 stood on the threshold of integration.\r\n\r\nThis sudden change in attitude was not so much the result of\r\nhumanitarian promptings by service officials, although some of them\r\nforcibly demanded equal treatment and opportunity. Nor was it a\r\nresponse to civil rights activists, although Negroes in and outside\r\nthe Air Force continued to exert pressure for change. Rather,\r\nintegration was forced upon the service when the inefficiency of its\r\nracial practices could no longer be ignored. The inefficiency of\r\nsegregated troops was less noticeable in the Army, where a vast number\r\nof Negroes could serve in a variety of expandable black units, and in\r\nthe smaller Navy, where only a few Negroes had specialist ratings and\r\nmost black sailors were in the separate Steward's Branch. But the\r\ninefficiency of separatism was plainly evident in the Air Force.\r\n\r\nLike the Army, the Air Force had its share of service units to absorb\r\nthe marginal black airman, but postwar budget restrictions had made\r\nthe enlargement of service units difficult to justify. At the same\r\ntime, the Gillem Board policy as well as outside pressures had made it\r\nnecessary to include a black air unit in the service's limited number\r\nof postwar air wings. However socially desirable two air forces might\r\nseem to most officials, and however easy it had been to defend them as\r\na wartime necessity, it quickly became apparent that segregation was,\r\norganizationally at least, a waste of the Air Force's few black pilots\r\nand specialists and its relatively large supply of unskilled black\r\nrecruits. Thus, the inclination to integrate was mostly pragmatic;\r\nnotably absent were the idealistic overtones sounded by the Navy's\r\nSpecial Programs Unit during the war. Considering the magnitude of the\r\nAir Force problem, it was probably just as well that efficiency rather\r\nthan idealism became the keynote of change. On a percentage basis the\r\nAir Force had almost as many Negroes as the Army and, no doubt, a\r\ncomparable level of prejudice among its commanders and men. At the\r\nsame time, the Air Force was a new service, its organization still\r\nfluid and its policies subject to rapid modification. In such\r\ncircumstances a straightforward appeal to efficiency had a chance to\r\nsucceed where an idealistic call for justice and fair play might well\r\nhave floundered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Segregation and Efficiency_                                       (p. 271)\r\n\r\nMany officials in the Army Air Forces had defended segregated units\r\nduring the war as an efficient method of avoiding dangerous social\r\nconflicts and utilizing low-scoring recruits.[11-1] General Arnold\r\nhimself repeatedly warned against bringing black officers and white\r\nenlisted men together. Unless strict unit segregation was imposed,\r\nsuch contacts would be inevitable, given the Air Forces' highly mobile\r\ntraining and operations structure.[11-2] But if segregation restricted\r\ncontacts between the races it also imposed a severe administrative\r\nburden on the wartime Air Forces. It especially affected the black\r\nflying units because it ordained that not only pilots but the ground\r\nsupport specialists--mechanics, supply clerks, armorers--had to be\r\nblack. Throughout most of the war the Air Forces, competing with the\r\nrest of the Army for skilled and high-scoring Negroes, was unable to\r\nfill the needs of its black air units. At a time when the Air Forces\r\nenjoyed a surplus of white air and ground crews, the black fighter\r\nunits suffered from a shortage of replacements for their combat\r\nveterans, a situation as inefficient as it was damaging to morale.[11-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-1: For a comprehensive and authoritative\r\n                   account of the Negro in the Army Air Forces during\r\n                   World War II, sec Osur's _Blacks in the Army Air\r\n                   Forces During World War II_.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-2: See Memo, CS/AC for G-3, 31 May 40,\r\n                   sub: Employment of Negro Personnel in the Air Corps\r\n                   Units, G-3/6541-Gen 527.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-3: For the effect on unit morale, see\r\n                   Charles E.

O. Davis,\r\n                   Jr., Jan 73.]\r\n\r\nThe shortage was compounded in the penultimate year of the war when\r\nthe all-black 477th Bombardment Group was organized. (Black airmen and\r\ncivil rights spokesmen complained that restricting Negroes to fighter\r\nunits excluded them from many important and prestigious types of air\r\nservice.) In the end the new bombardment group only served to limit\r\nblack participation in the air war. Already short of black pilots, the\r\nArmy Air Forces now had to find black navigators and bombardiers as\r\nwell, thereby intensifying the competition for qualified black cadets.\r\nThe stipulation that pilots and bombardiers for the new unit be\r\ntrained at segregated Tuskegee was another obvious cause for the\r\nrepeated delays in the operational date of the 477th, and its crews\r\nwere finally assembled only weeks before the end of the war.\r\nCompetition for black bomber crews also led to a ludicrous situation\r\nin which men highly qualified for pilot training according to their\r\nstanine scores (achievements on the battery of qualifying tests taken\r\nby all applicants for flight service) were sent instead to\r\nnavigator-bomber training, for which they were only barely\r\nqualified.[11-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-4: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, pp.\r\n                   462-64; see also Interv, author with Lt Gen\r\n                   Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., 12 Jun 70, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nUnable to obtain enough Negroes qualified for flight training, the\r\nArmy Air Forces asked the Ground and Service Forces to screen their\r\npersonnel for suitable candidates, but a screening early in 1945\r\nproduced only about one-sixth of the men needed. Finally, the Air\r\nForces recommended that the Army staff lower the General Classification\r\nTest score for pilot training from 110 to 100, a recommendation the\r\nService and Ground Forces opposed because such a move would eventually\r\nmean the mass transfer of high-scoring Negroes to the Air Forces,  (p. 272)\r\nthus depriving the Service and Ground Forces of their proportionate\r\nshare. Although the Secretary of War approved the Air Forces proposal,\r\nthe change came too late to affect the shortage of black pilots and\r\nspecialists before the end of the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAMAGE INSPECTION. _A squadron operations officer of\r\nthe 332d Fighter Group points out a cannon hole to ground crew, Italy,\r\n1945._]\r\n\r\nWhile short of skilled Negroes, the Army Air Forces was being\r\ninundated with thousands of undereducated and unskilled Negroes from\r\nSelective Service. It tried to absorb these recruits, as it absorbed\r\nsome of its white draftees, by creating a great number of service and\r\nbase security battalions. A handy solution to the wartime quota\r\nproblem, the large segregated units eventually caused considerable\r\nracial tension. Some of the tension might have been avoided had black\r\nofficers commanded black squadrons, a logical course since the Air\r\nForce had a large surplus of nonrated black officers stationed at\r\nTuskegee.[11-5] Most were without permanent assignment or were assigned\r\nsuch duties as custodial responsibility for bachelor officer quarters,\r\noccupations unrelated to their specialties.[11-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-5: A nonrated officer is one not having\r\n                   or requiring a currently effective aeronautical\r\n                   rating; that is, an officer who is not a pilot,\r\n                   navigator, or bombardier.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-6: Interv, author with Davis; see also\r\n                   Osur's _Blacks in the Army Air Forces During World\r\n                   War II_, ch. V.]\r\n\r\nFew of these idle black officers commanded black service units because\r\nthe units were scattered worldwide while the nonrated officers were\r\nalmost always assigned to the airfield at Tuskegee. Approximately\r\none-third of the Air Forces' 1,559 black officers were stationed at\r\nTuskegee in June 1945. Most others were assigned to the fighter group\r\nin the Mediterranean theater or the new bombardment group in flight\r\ntraining at Godman Field, Kentucky. Only twenty-five black         (p. 273)\r\nofficers were serving at other stations in the United States. The\r\nSecond, Third, and Fourth Air Forces and I Troop Carrier Command, for\r\nexample, had a combined total of seventeen black officers as against\r\n22,938 black enlisted men.[11-7] Col. Noel F. Parrish, the wartime\r\ncommander at Tuskegee, explained that the principal reason for this\r\nrestriction was the prevailing fear of social conflict. If assigned to\r\nother bases, black officers might try to use the officers' clubs and\r\nother base facilities. Thus, despite the surplus of black officers\r\nonly too evident at Tuskegee, their requests for transfer to other\r\nbases for assignment in their rating were usually denied on the\r\ngrounds that the overall shortage of black officers made their\r\nreplacement impossible.[11-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-7: \"Summary of AAF Post-War Surveys,\"\r\n                   prepared by Noel Parrish, copy in NAACP Collection,\r\n                   Library of Congress.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-8: Noel F.

Actually, such assignments\r\ncourted morale problems and worse because they were extremely\r\nunpopular with both officers and men. Moreover, the Air Forces\r\neventually had to admit that there was a tendency to assign white\r\nofficers \"of mediocre caliber\" to black squadrons.[11-9] Yet few\r\nassignments demanded greater leadership ability, for these officers\r\nwere burdened not only with the usual problems of a unit commander but\r\nalso with the complexities of race relations. If they disparaged their\r\ntroops, they failed as commanders; if they fought for their men, they\r\nwere dismissed by their superiors as \"pro-Negro.\" Consequently, they\r\nwere generally a harassed and bewildered lot, bitter over their\r\nassignments and bad for troop morale.[11-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-9: Ltr, Hq AAF, to CG, Tactical Training\r\n                   Cmd, 21 Aug 42, sub: Professional Qualities of\r\n                   Officers Assigned to Negro Units, 220.765-3,\r\n                   AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-10: Parrish, \"Segregation of the Negro in\r\n                   the Army Air Forces,\" pp. 50-55.

Commanders found it prohibitively expensive to provide\r\nseparate but equal facilities, and without them discrimination became\r\nmore obvious. The walk-in protest at the Freeman Field Officers Club\r\nwas but one of the natural consequences of segregation rules. And such\r\ndemonstrations were only the more spectacular problems. Just as\r\ntime-consuming and perhaps more of a burden were the many\r\nadministrative difficulties. The Air Transport Command admitted in\r\n1946 that it was too expensive to maintain, as the command was\r\nobligated to do, separate and equal housing and messing, including\r\nseparate orderly and day rooms for black airmen. At the same time it\r\ncomplained of the disproportionately high percentage of black troops\r\nviolating military and civil law. Although Negroes accounted for 20\r\npercent of the command's troops, they committed more than 50 percent\r\nof its law infractions. The only connection the command was able to\r\nmake between the separate, unequal facilities and the high misconduct\r\nrate was to point out that, while it had done its best to provide for\r\nNegroes, they \"had not earned a very enviable record by\r\nthemselves.\"[11-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-11: AAF Transport Cmd, \"History of the\r\n                   Command, 1 July 1946-31 December 1946\" pp. 120-26.]\r\n\r\nIn one crucial five-month period of the war, Army Air Forces       (p. 274)\r\nheadquarters processed twenty-two separate staff actions involving\r\nblack troops.[11-12] To avoid the supposed danger of large-scale social\r\nintegration, the Air Forces, like the rest of the Army during World\r\nWar II, had been profligate in its use of material resources,\r\ninefficient in its use of men, and destructive of the morale of black\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-12: Parrish, \"Segregation of the Negro in\r\n                   the Army Air Forces.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL PARRISH. (_1946 photograph_).]\r\n\r\nThe Air staff was not oblivious to these facts and made some\r\nadjustments in policy as the war progressed. Notably, it rejected\r\nseparate training of nonrated black officers and provided for\r\nintegrated training of black navigators and bombardiers. In the last\r\ndays of the war General Arnold ordered his commanders to \"take\r\naffirmative action to insure that equity in training and assignment\r\nopportunity is provided all personnel.\"[11-13] And when it came to\r\npostwar planning, the Air staff demonstrated it had learned much from\r\nwartime experience:\r\n\r\n     The degree to which negroes can be successfully employed in the\r\n     Post-War Military Establishment largely depends on the success of\r\n     the Army in maintaining at a minimum the feeling of\r\n     discrimination and unfair treatment which basically are the\r\n     causes for irritation and disorders ... in the event of a future\r\n     emergency the arms will employ a large number of negroes and\r\n     their contribution in such an emergency will largely depend on\r\n     the training, treatment and intelligent use of negroes during the\r\n     intervening years.[11-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-13: AAF Ltr 35-268, 11 Aug 45.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-14: Rpt, ACS/AS-1 to WDSS, 17 Sep 45,\r\n                   sub: Participation of Negro Troops in the Post-War\r\n                   Military Establishment, WDSS 291.2.]\r\n\r\nBut while admitting that discrimination was at the heart of its racial\r\nproblem, the Air staff failed to see the connection between\r\ndiscrimination and segregation. Instead it adopted the recommendations\r\nof its senior commanders. The consensus was that black combat (flying)\r\nunits had performed \"more or less creditably,\" but required more\r\ntraining than white units, and that the ground echelon and combat\r\nsupport units had performed below average. Rather than abolish these\r\nbelow average units, however, commanders wanted them preserved and\r\nwanted postwar policy to strengthen segregation. The final\r\nrecommendation of the Army Air Forces to the Gillem Board was that\r\nblacks be trained according to the same standards as whites but that\r\nthey be employed in separate units and segregated for recreation,\r\nmessing, and social activities \"on the post as well as off,\" in    (p. 275)\r\nkeeping with prevailing customs in the surrounding civilian\r\ncommunity.[11-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-15: Ibid. For an analysis of these\r\n                   recommendations, see Gropman's _The Air Force\r\n                   Integrates_, ch. II.]\r\n\r\nThe Army Air Forces' postwar use of black troops was fairly consonant\r\nwith the major provisions of the Gillem Board Report. To reduce black\r\ncombat units in proportion to the reduction of its white units, it\r\nconverted the 477th Bombardment Group (M) into the 477th Composite\r\nGroup. This group, under the command of the Army's senior black pilot,\r\nCol. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., included a fighter, a bombardment, and a\r\nservice squadron. To provide segregated duty for its black\r\nspecialists, the Army Air Forces organized regular black squadrons,\r\nmostly ammunition, motor transport, and engineer throughout its\r\ncommands. To absorb the large number of unskilled Negroes, it\r\norganized one black squadron (Squadron F) in each of the ninety-seven\r\nbase units in its worldwide base system to perform laboring and\r\nhousekeeping chores. Finally, it promised \"to the fullest possible\r\nextent\" to assign Negroes with specialized skills and qualifications\r\nto overhead and special units.[11-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-16: WD Bureau of Public Relations, Memo\r\n                   for the Press, 20 Sep 45; Office of Public\r\n                   Relations, Godman Field, Ky., \"Col.

The move was unrelated to the Gillem Board Report or to\r\nthe demands of civil rights advocates. The Tuskegee operation had\r\nsimply become impractical. In the severe postwar retrenchment of the\r\narmed forces, Tuskegee's cadet enrollment had dropped sharply, only\r\nnine men graduated in the October 1945 class.[11-17] To the general\r\nsatisfaction of the black community, the few black cadets shared both\r\nquarters and classes with white students.[11-18] Nine black cadets were\r\nin training at the end of 1947.[11-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-17: \"History of the 2143d AAF Base Unit,\r\n                   Pilot School, Basic, Advanced, and Tuskegee Army\r\n                   Air Field, 1 Sep 1945-31 Oct 1945,\" AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-18: For an example of black reaction see\r\n                   _Ebony_ Magazine V (September 1949).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-19: Memo, James C.

By\r\nFebruary 1946 the 477th Composite Group had been reduced to sixteen\r\nB-25 bombers, twelve P-47 fighter-bombers, and only 746 men--a 40\r\npercent drop in four months.[11-20] Although the Tactical Air Command\r\nrated the unit's postwar training and performance satisfactory, and\r\nits transfer to the more hospitable surroundings and finer facilities\r\nof Lockbourne Field, Ohio, raised morale, the 477th, like other\r\nunderstaffed and underequipped organizations, faced inevitable\r\nconversion to specialized service. In July 1947 the 477th was\r\ninactivated and replaced by the 332d Fighter Group composed of the\r\n99th, 100th, and 301st Fighter Squadrons. Black bomber pilots were\r\nconverted to fighter pilots, and the bomber crews were removed from\r\nflying status.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-20: \"History of the 477th Composite\r\n                   Group,\" 15 Sep 45-15 Feb 46, Feb-Mar 46, and 1\r\n                   Mar-15 Jul 46, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFFICERS' SOFTBALL TEAM _representing the 477th\r\nComposite Group, Godwin Field, Kentucky_.]\r\n\r\nThese changes flew in the face of the Gillem Board Report, for     (p. 276)\r\nhowever slightly that document may have changed the Army's segregation\r\npolicy, it did demand at least a modest response to the call for equal\r\nopportunity in training, assignment, and advancement. The board\r\nclearly looked to the command of black units by qualified black\r\nofficers and the training of black airmen to serve as a cadre for any\r\nnecessary expansion of black units in wartime. Certainly the\r\nconversion of black bomber pilots to fighters did not meet these\r\nmodest demands. In its defense the Army Air Forces in effect pleaded\r\nthat there were too many Negroes for its present force, now severely\r\nreduced in size and lacking planes and other equipment, and too many\r\nof the black troops lacked education for the variety of assignments\r\nrecommended by the board.\r\n\r\nThe Army Air Forces seemed to have a point, for in the immediate\r\npostwar period its percentage of black airmen had risen dramatically.\r\nIt was drafting men to replace departing veterans, and in 1946 it was\r\ntaking anyone who qualified, including many Negroes. In seven months\r\nthe air arm lost over half its black strength, going from a wartime\r\nhigh of 80,606 on 31 August 1945 to 38,911 on 31 March 1946, but in\r\nthe same period the black percentage almost doubled, climbing from 4.2\r\nto 7.92.[11-21] The War Department predicted that all combat arms would\r\nhave a black strength of 15 percent by 1 July 1946.[11-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-21: All figures from STM-30, 1 Sep 45 and\r\n                   1 Apr 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-22: Memo, TAG for CG's et al., 4 Feb 46,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Personnel, AG 291.2 (31\r\n                   Jan 46).]\r\n\r\nThis prophecy never materialized in the Air Forces. Changes in\r\nenlistment standards, curtailment of overseas assignments for Negroes,\r\nand, finally, suspension of all black enlistments in the Regular Army\r\nexcept in certain military specialist occupations turned the\r\npercentage of Negroes downward. By the fall of 1947, when the Air  (p. 277)\r\nForce became a separate service,[11-23] the proportion of black airmen\r\nhad leveled off at nearly 7 percent. Nor did the proportion of Negroes\r\never exceed the Gillem Board's 10 percent quota during the next\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-23: Under the terms of the National\r\n                   Security Act of 1947 the U.S. Air Force was created\r\n                   as a separate service in a Department of the Air\r\n                   Force on 18 September 1947. The new service\r\n                   included the old Army Air Forces; the Air Corps,\r\n                   U.S. Army; and General Headquarters Air Force. The\r\n                   strictures of WD Circular 124, like those of many\r\n                   other departmental circulars, were adopted by the\r\n                   new service. For convenience' sake the terms _Air\r\n                   Force_ and _service_ will be employed in the\r\n                   remaining sections of this chapter even where the\r\n                   terms _Army Air Forces_ and _component_ would be\r\n                   more appropriate.]\r\n\r\nThe Air Force seemed on safer ground when it pleaded that it lacked\r\nthe black airmen with skills to carry out the variety of assignments\r\ncalled for by the Gillem Board. The Air Force was finding it\r\nimpossible to organize effective black units in appreciable numbers;\r\neven some units already in existence were as much as two-thirds below\r\nauthorized strength in certain ground specialist slots.[11-24] Yet here\r\ntoo the statistics do not reveal the whole truth. Despite a general\r\nshortage of Negroes in the high test score categories, the Air Force\r\ndid have black enlisted men qualified for general assignment as\r\nspecialists or at least eligible for specialist training, who were\r\ninstead assigned to labor squadrons.[11-25] In its effort to reduce the\r\nnumber of Negroes, the service had also relieved from active duty\r\nother black specialists trained in much needed skills. Finally, the\r\nAir Force still had a surplus of black specialists in some categories\r\nat Lockbourne Field who were not assigned to the below-strength units.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-24: \"Tactical Air Command (TAC) History,\r\n                   1 Jan-30 Dec 48,\" pp. 94-96, AFSHRC; see also\r\n                   Lawrence J. Paszek, \"Negroes and the Air Force,\r\n                   1939-1949,\" _Military Affairs_ (Spring 1967), p.\r\n                   8.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-25: Memo, DCofS/Personnel, TAC, for CG,\r\n                   TAC, 18 Mar 48, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nAgain it was not too many black enlisted men or too few black officers\r\nor specialists but the policy of strict segregation that kept the Air\r\nForce from using black troops efficiently. Insistence on segregation,\r\nnot the number of Negroes, caused maldistribution among the commands.\r\nIn 1947, for example, the Tactical Air Command contained some 5,000\r\nblack airmen, close to 28 percent of the command's strength. This\r\nsituation came about because the command counted among its units the\r\none black air group and many of the black service units whose members\r\nin an integrated service would have been distributed throughout all\r\nthe commands according to needs and abilities. The Air Force\r\nsegregation policy restricted all but forty-five of the black officers\r\nin the continental United States to one base,[11-26] just as it was the\r\nAir Force's attempt to avoid integration that kept black officers from\r\ncommand. In November 1947, 1,581 black enlisted men and only two black\r\nofficers were stationed at MacDill Field; at San Antonio there were\r\n3,450 black airmen and again two black officers. These figures provide\r\nsome clue to the cause of the riot involving black airmen at MacDill\r\nField on 27 October 1946.[11-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-26: Memo, DCofS/P&A, USAF, for Asst\r\n                   SecAF, 5 Dec 47, sub: Air Force Negro Troops in the\r\n                   Zone of Interior, Negro Affairs, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-27: \"History of MacDill Army Airfield,\r\n                   Oct 46,\" pp. 10-11, AFSHRC.

I; see also ch. 5,\r\n                   above.]\r\n\r\nSegregation also prevented the use of Negroes on a broader\r\nprofessional scale. In April 1948, 84.2 percent of Negroes in the Air\r\nForce were working in an occupational specialty as against 92.7    (p. 278)\r\npercent of whites, but the number of Negroes in radar, aviation\r\nspecialist, wire communications, and other highly specialized skills\r\nrequired to support a tactical air unit was small and far below the\r\npercentage of whites. The Air Force argued that since Negroes were\r\nassigned to black units and since there was only one black tactical\r\nunit, there was little need for Negroes with these special skills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHECKING AMMUNITION. _An armorer in the 332d Fighter\r\nGroup inspects the P-51 Mustang, Italy, 1945._]\r\n\r\nThe fact that rated black officers and specialists were restricted to\r\none black fighter group particularly concerned civil rights advocates.\r\nWithout bomber, transport, ferrying, or weather observation\r\nassignments, black officers qualified for larger aircraft had no\r\nchance to diversify their careers. It was essentially the same story\r\nfor black airmen. Without more varied and large black combat units the\r\nAir Force had no need to assign many black airmen to specialist\r\ntraining. In December 1947, for example, only 80 of approximately\r\n26,000 black airmen were attending specialist schools.[11-28] When asked\r\nabout the absence of Negroes in large aircraft, especially bombers,\r\nAir Force spokesmen cited the conversion of the 477th Composite Group,\r\nwhich contained the only black bomber unit, to a specialized fighter\r\ngroup as merely part of a general reorganization to meet the needs (p. 279)\r\nof a 55-wing organization.[11-29] That the one black bomber unit\r\nhappened to be organized out of existence was pure accident.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-28: Memo, unsigned (probably DCofS/P&A),\r\n                   for Asst SecAF Zuckert, 22 Apr 48, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-29: See Air Force Testimony Before the\r\n                   National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs\r\n                   (afternoon session), pp. 29-32, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nThe Gillem Board had sought to expand the training and placement of\r\nskilled Negroes by going outside the regular black units and giving\r\nthem overhead assignments. After the war some base commanders made\r\nsuch assignments unofficially, taking advantage of the abilities of\r\nairmen in the overmanned, all-black Squadron F's and assigning them to\r\nskilled duties. In one instance the base commander's secretary was a\r\nmember of his black unit; in another, black mechanics from Squadron F\r\nworked on the flight line with white mechanics. But whatever their\r\nwork, these men remained members of Squadron F, and often the whole\r\nblack squadron, rather than individual airmen, found itself\r\nfunctioning as an overhead unit, contrary to the intent of the Gillem\r\nBoard. Even the few Negroes formally trained in a specialty and placed\r\nin an integrated overhead unit did not approximate the Gillem Board's\r\nintention of training a cadre that would be readily expandable in an\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to expanded overhead assignments was continuation of\r\nsegregated service units and Squadron F's, but, as some manpower\r\nexperts pointed out, many special purpose units suitable for unskilled\r\nairmen were disappearing from the postwar Air Force. Experience gained\r\nthrough the assignment of large numbers of marginal men to such units\r\nin peacetime would be of questionable value during large-scale\r\nmobilization.[11-30] As Colonel Parrish, the wartime commander of\r\ntraining at Tuskegee, warned, a peacetime policy incapable of wartime\r\napplication was not only unrealistic, but dangerous.[11-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-30: Memo, DCofS/P&A, TAC, for CG, TAC, 18\r\n                   Mar 48, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower,\r\n                   AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-31: Parrish, \"Segregation of the Negro in\r\n                   the Army Air Forces,\" pp. 72-73.]\r\n\r\nThe Air staff tried to carry out the Gillem Board's suggestion that\r\nNegroes be stationed \"where attitudes are most favorable for them\r\ninsofar as military factors permit,\" but even here the service lagged\r\nbehind civilian practice. When Marcus H. Ray arrived at Wright Field,\r\nOhio, for a two-day inspection tour in July 1946, he found almost\r\n3,000 black civilians working peacefully and effectively alongside\r\n18,000 white civilians, all assigned to their jobs without regard to\r\nrace. \"I would rate this installation,\" Ray reported, \"as the best\r\nexample of efficient utilization of manpower I have seen.\" He went on\r\nto explain: \"The integration has been accomplished without publicity\r\nand simply by assigning workers according to their capabilities and\r\nwithout regard to race, creed, or color.\" But Ray also noted that\r\nthere were no black military men on the base.[11-32] Assistant Secretary\r\nof War Petersen was impressed. \"In view of the fact that the racial\r\nclimate seems exceptionally favorable at Wright Field,\" he wrote\r\nGeneral Carl Spaatz, \"consideration should be given to the employment\r\nof carefully selected Negro military personnel with specialist ratings\r\nfor work in that installation.\"[11-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-32: Memo, Ray for ASW, 25 Jul 46, ASW\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-33: Memo, Petersen for CG, AAF, 29 Jul\r\n                   46, ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Air Force complied. In the fall of 1946 it was forming black   (p. 280)\r\nunits for assignment to Air Materiel Command Stations, and it planned\r\nto move a black unit to Wright Field in the near future.[11-34] In\r\nassigning an all-black unit to Wright, however, the Air Force was\r\nintroducing segregation where none had existed before, and here as in\r\nother areas its actions belied the expressed intent of the Gillem\r\nBoard policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-34: Memo, Brig Gen Reuben C. Hood, Jr.,\r\n                   Office of CG, AAF, for ASW, 13 Sep 46, ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Impulse for Change_\r\n\r\nThe problems associated with efficient use of black airmen intensified\r\nwhen the Air Force became an independent service in 1947. The number\r\nof Negroes fluctuated during the transition from Army Air Forces to\r\nAir Force, and as late as April 1948 the Army still retained a number\r\nof specialized black units whose members had the right to transfer to\r\nthe Air Force. Estimates were that some 5,400 black airmen would\r\neventually enter the Air Force from this source. Air Force officials\r\nbelieved that when these men were added to the 26,507 Negroes already\r\nin the new service, including 118 rated and 127 nonrated male officers\r\nand 4 female officers, the total would exceed the 10 percent quota\r\nsuggested by the Gillem Board. Accordingly, soon after it became an\r\nindependent service, the Air Force set the number of black enlistments\r\nat 300 per month until the necessary adjustments to the transfer\r\nprogram could be made.[11-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-35: Memo, unsigned, for Asst SecAF\r\n                   Zuckert, 22 Apr 48, SecAF files. The figures cited\r\n                   in this memorandum were slightly at variance with\r\n                   the official strength figures as compiled later in\r\n                   the _Unites States Air Force Statistical Digest I_\r\n                   (1948). The _Digest_ put the Air Force's strength\r\n                   (excluding Army personnel still under Air Force\r\n                   control) on 31 March 1948 at 345,827, including\r\n                   25,404 Negroes (8.9 percent of the total). The 10\r\n                   percent plus estimate mentioned in the memorandum,\r\n                   however, was right on the mark when statistics for\r\n                   enlisted strength alone are considered.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the chronic problems associated with black enlistments\r\nand quotas, four very specific problems demonstrated clearly to Air\r\nForce officials the urgent need for a change in race policy. The first\r\nof these was the distribution of black airmen which threatened the\r\noperational efficiency of the Tactical Air Command. A second, related\r\nto the first, revolved around the personnel shortages in black\r\ntactical units that necessitated an immediate reorganization of those\r\nunits, a reorganization both controversial and managerially\r\ninefficient. The third and fourth problems were related; the demands\r\nof black leaders for a broader use of black servicemen suddenly\r\nintensified, dovetailing with the personal inclinations of the\r\nSecretary of the Air Force, who was making the strict segregation of\r\nblack officers and specialists increasingly untenable. These four\r\nfactors coalesced during 1948 and led to a reassessment of policy and,\r\nfinally, to a _volte-face_.\r\n\r\nLimiting black enlistment to 300 per month did little to ease the\r\nsituation in the Tactical Air Command. There, the percentage of black\r\npersonnel, although down from its postwar high of 28 percent to 15.4\r\npercent by the end of 1947, remained several points above the Gillem\r\nBoard's 10 percent quota throughout 1948. In March 1948 the command's\r\nDeputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Col. John E. Barr, found that the\r\nlarge number of Negroes gave the command a surplus of \"marginal    (p. 281)\r\nindividuals,\" men who could not be trained economically for the\r\nvarious skills needed. He argued that this theoretical surplus of\r\nNegroes was \"potentially parasitic\" and threatened the command's\r\nmission.[11-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-36: Memo, DCofS/P&A, TAC, for CG, TAC, 18\r\n                   Mar 48, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower,\r\n                   AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUADRON F, 318TH AAF BATTALION, _in review, Lockbourne\r\nAir Force Base, Ohio, 1947_.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the command's personnel director found that Negroes\r\nwere being inefficiently used. With one squadron designated for their\r\nblack airmen, most commanders deemed surplus any Negroes in excess of\r\nthe needs of that squadron and made little attempt to use them\r\neffectively. Even when some of these men were given a chance at\r\nskilled jobs in the Tactical Air Command their assignments proved\r\nshort-lived. Because of a shortage of white airmen at Shaw Air Force\r\nBase, South Carolina, in early 1948, for example, Negroes from the\r\nbase's Squadron F were assigned to fill all the slots in Squadron C,\r\nthe base fire department. The Negroes performed so creditably that\r\nwhen enough white airmen to man Squadron C became available the\r\ncommander suggested that the black fire fighters be transferred to\r\nLockbourne rather than returned to their menial assignments.[11-37] The\r\nadvantage of leaving the all-black Squadron C at Shaw was apparently\r\noverlooked by everyone.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-37: Memo, Adj, 20th Fighter Wing, for CG,\r\n                   Ninth AF, undated, sub: Transfer of Structural\r\n                   Firefighters; 2d Ind, Hq 332d Fighter Wing,\r\n                   Lockbourne, to CG, Ninth AF, 26 Apr 48, Hist of\r\n                   Ninth AF, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nEven this limited chance at occupational preferment was exceptional\r\nfor black airmen in the Tactical Air Command. The command's personnel\r\nstaff admitted that many highly skilled black technicians were\r\nperforming menial tasks and that measures taken to raise the\r\nperformance levels of other black airmen through training were\r\ninadequate. The staff also concluded that actions designed by the\r\ncommand to raise morale among black airmen left much to be desired. It\r\nmentioned specifically the excessively high turnover of officers\r\nassigned to black units, officers who for the most part proved\r\nmediocre as leaders. Most devastating of all, the study admitted that\r\npromotions and other rewards for duties performed by black airmen were\r\nnot commensurate with those received by whites.[11-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-38: Memo, DCofS/P&A, TAC, for CG, TAC, 18\r\n                   Mar 48, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower,\r\n                   AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nColonel Barr offered a solution that echoed the plea of Air Force  (p. 282)\r\ncommanders everywhere: revise Circular 124 to allow his organization\r\nto reduce the percentage of Negroes. Among a number of \"compromise\r\nsolutions\" he recommended raising enlistment standards to reduce the\r\nnumber of submarginal airmen; designating Squadron E, the\r\ntransportation squadron of the combat wings, a black unit; assigning\r\nall skilled black technicians to Lockbourne or declaring them surplus\r\nto the command; and selecting only outstanding officers to command\r\nblack units.\r\n\r\nOne of these recommendations was under fire in Colonel Barr's own\r\ncommand. All-black transportation squadrons had already been discussed\r\nin the Ninth Air Force and had brought an immediate objection from\r\nMaj. Gen. William D. Old, its commander. Old explained that few black\r\nairmen in his command were qualified for \"higher echelon maintenance\r\nactivities,\" that is, major motor and transmission overhaul, and he\r\nhad no black officers qualified to command such troops. On-the-job\r\ntraining would be impossible during total conversion of the squadrons\r\nfrom white to black; formal schooling for whole squadrons would have\r\nto be organized. Besides, Old continued, making transportation\r\nsquadrons all black would only aggravate the command's race problems,\r\nfor it would result in a further deviation from the \"desired ratio of\r\none to ten.\" Old wanted to reduce the number of black airmen in the\r\nNinth Air Force by 1,633 men. The loss would not materially affect the\r\nefficiency of his command, he concluded. It would leave the Ninth Air\r\nForce with a ratio of one black officer to ten white and one black\r\nairman to eight white, and still permit the manning of black tactical\r\nunits at full strength.[11-39] In the end none of these recommendations\r\nwas followed. They needed the approval of Air Force headquarters, and\r\nas Lt. Gen. Elwood R. Quesada, commander of the Tactical Air Command,\r\nexplained to General Old, the headquarters was in the midst of a\r\nlengthy review of Circular 124. In the meantime the command would have\r\nto carry on without guidance from higher headquarters.[11-40] Carry on it\r\ndid, but the problems associated with the distribution of black\r\nairmen, problems the command constantly shared with Air Force\r\nheadquarters, lingered throughout 1948.[11-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-39: Memo, Maj Gen Old for CG, TAC, 26 Jan\r\n                   48, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower, 9AF 200.3,\r\n                   Hist of Ninth AF, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-40: Ltr, Lt Gen Quesada to Maj Gen Old,\r\n                   Ninth AF, 9 Apr 48, Hist of Ninth AF, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-41: Ltrs, CG, TAC, to CS/USAF, 1 Sep 48,\r\n                   sub: Reception of Submarginal Enlisted Personnel;\r\n                   VCS/USAF to CG, TAC, 11 Sep 48, sub: Elimination of\r\n                   Undesirable or Substandard Airmen; CG, TAC, to\r\n                   CS/USAF, 24 Sep 48, same sub. All in AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nThe Air Force's segregation policy had meanwhile created a critical\r\nsituation in the black tactical units. The old 332d, now the 332d\r\nFighter Wing, shared with the rest of the command the burden of too\r\nmany low-scoring men--35 percent of Lockbourne's airmen were in the\r\ntwo lowest groups, IV and V--but here the problem was acute since the\r\npresence of so many persons with little ability limited the number of\r\nskilled black airmen that the Tactical Air Command could transfer to\r\nthe wing from other parts of the command. Under direction of the\r\ncommand, the Ninth Air Force was taking advantage of a regulation that\r\nrestricted the reenlistment of low-scoring airmen, but the high\r\npercentage of unskilled Negroes persisted at Lockbourne. Negroes   (p. 283)\r\nin the upper test brackets were not reenlisting while the low scorers\r\nunquestionably were.[11-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-42: Ltr, DCofS/P&A, TAC, to CG, Ninth AF,\r\n                   19 May 48, sub: Submarginal Enlisted Personnel;\r\n                   Record of Dir of Per Staff, TAC, Mtg, 28 Oct 48;\r\n                   both in AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time there was a shortage of rated black officers. The\r\n332d Fighter Wing was authorized 244 officers, but only 200 were\r\nassigned in February 1948. There was no easy solution to the shortage,\r\na product of many years of neglect. Segregation imposed the necessity\r\nof devising a broad and long-range recruitment and training program\r\nfor black officers, but not until April 1948 did the Tactical Air\r\nCommand call for a steady flow of Negroes through officer candidate\r\nand flight training schools.[11-43] It hoped to have another thirty-one\r\nblack pilot graduates by March 1949 and planned to recall thirty-two\r\nothers from inactive status.[11-44] Even these steps could not possibly\r\nalleviate the serious shortage caused by the perennial failure to\r\nreplace the wing's annual pilot attrition.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-43: Ltr, CG, TAC, to CG, Ninth AF, 9 Apr\r\n                   48, TAC 314 (9 Apr 48), AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-44: Hq TAC, Record and Routing Sheet, 16\r\n                   Apr 48, sub: Supervisory Visit 332d Ftr Gp,\r\n                   Lockbourne AFB, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nThe chronic shortage of black field grade officers in the 332d was the\r\nimmediate cause of the change in Air Force policy. By February 1948\r\nthe 332d had only thirteen of its forty-eight authorized field grade\r\nofficers on duty. The three tactical units of the wing were commanded\r\nby captains instead of the authorized lieutenant colonels. If Colonel\r\nDavis were reassigned, and his attendance at the Air War College was\r\nexpected momentarily, his successor as wing commander would be a major\r\nwith five years' service.[11-45] The Tactical Air Commander was trying to\r\nhave all field grade Negroes assigned to the 332d, but even that\r\nexpedient would not provide enough officers.[11-46] Finally, General\r\nQuesada decided to recommend that \"practically all\" the key field\r\ngrade positions in the 332d Wing be filled by whites.[11-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-45: Ltr, CG, Ninth AF, to CG, TAC, 10 Feb\r\n                   48, sub: Assignment of Negro Personnel, Hist of\r\n                   Ninth AF, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-46: Hq TAC, Record and Routing Sheet, 16\r\n                   Apr 48, sub: Supervisory Visit 332d Ftr Gp,\r\n                   Lockbourne AFB, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-47: Ltrs, CG, TAC, to CG, Ninth AF, 9 Apr\r\n                   48, and DCG, TAC, to CG, Ninth AF, 7 May 48, TAC\r\n                   210.3; both in Hist of Ninth AF, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nSubsequent discussions at Air Force headquarters gave the Air Force\r\nChief of Staff, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, three choices: leave\r\nLockbourne manned exclusively by black officers; assign a white wing\r\ncommander with a racially mixed staff; or permit Colonel Davis to\r\nremain in command with a racially mixed staff. Believing that General\r\nVandenberg would approve the last course, the Tactical Air Command\r\nproceeded to search for appropriate white officers to fill the key\r\npositions under Davis.[11-48]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-48: Memo, A-1, Ninth AF, for C/S, Ninth\r\n                   AF, 18 May 48, sub: Manning of 332d Fighter Wing,\r\n                   Hist of Ninth AF; Record of the TAC Staff Conf, 18\r\n                   May 48; both in AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nThe deputy commander of the Ninth Air Force, Brig. Gen. Jarred V.\r\nCrabb, predicted that placing whites in key positions in the 332d\r\nwould cause trouble, but leaving Davis in command of a mixed staff\r\n\"would be loaded with dynamite.\"[11-49] The commander of the Ninth (p. 284)\r\nAir Force called the proposal to integrate the 332d's staff contrary\r\nto Air Force policy, which prescribed segregated units of not less\r\nthan company strength. General Old was forthright:\r\n\r\n     [Integration] would be playing in the direction in which the\r\n     negro press would like to force us. They are definitely\r\n     attempting to force the Army and Air Force to solve the racial\r\n     problem. As you know, they have been strongly advocating mixed\r\n     companies of white and colored. For obvious reasons this is most\r\n     undesirable and to do so would definitely limit the geographical\r\n     locations in which such units could be employed. If the Air\r\n     Forces go ahead and set a precedent, most undesirable\r\n     repercussions may occur. Regardless of how the problem is solved,\r\n     we would certainly come under strong criticism of the negro\r\n     press. That must be expected.\r\n\r\n     In view of the combat efficiency demonstrated by colored\r\n     organizations during the last war, my first recommendation in the\r\n     interest of national defense and saving the taxpayer's money is\r\n     to let the organization die on the vine. We make a big subject of\r\n     giving the taxpayers the maximum amount of protection for each\r\n     dollar spent, then turn around and support an organization that\r\n     would contribute little or nothing in an emergency. It is my own\r\n     opinion that it is an unnecessary drain on our national\r\n     resources, but for political reasons I presume the organization\r\n     must be retained. Therefore, my next recommended solution is to\r\n     transfer all of the colored personnel from the Wing Headquarters\r\n     staff to the Tactical and Service Organizations within the Wing\r\n     structure and replace it with a completely white staff.[11-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-49: Ltr, Brig Gen J.

He urged that\r\nColonel Davis's absence at the Air War College be considered a\r\ntemporary arrangement. Meanwhile, the general added, \"we can carry\r\nLockbourne along for that period of time by close supervision from\r\nthis headquarters.\"[11-52] As Davis later put it, cost effectiveness, not\r\nprejudice, was the key factor in the Air Force's wish to get rid of\r\nthe 332d.

Most Negroes in the Strategic Air Command, for example,\r\nwere assigned to aviation engineer units where, as construction\r\nworkers, they built roads, runways, and housing for the command's\r\nfar-flung bases. These duties were transient, however, and like\r\nmigrant workers at home, black construction crews were shifted from\r\nbase to base as the need arose; they had little chance for promotion,\r\nlet alone the opportunity to develop other skills.[11-54]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-54: See history of various aviation air\r\n                   units in \"History of the Strategic Air Command,\r\n                   1948,\" vols VI and VIII, AFSHRC.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of Negroes in all commands, and particularly the\r\nshortage of black specialists and officers in the 332d Fighter Wing,\r\nstrongly influenced the Air Force to reexamine its racial policy,  (p. 285)\r\nbut pressures came from outside the department as well as from the\r\nblack community which began to press its demands on the new\r\nservice.[11-55] The prestigious Pittsburgh _Courier_ opened the\r\ncampaign in March 1948 by directing a series of questions on Air Force\r\npolicy to the Chief of Staff. General Carl Spaatz responded with a\r\nsmooth summary of the Gillem Board Report, leaning heavily on that\r\ndocument's progressive aims. \"It is the feeling of this Headquarters,\"\r\nthe Chief of Staff wrote, \"that the ultimate Air Force objective must\r\nbe to eliminate segregation among its personnel by the unrestricted\r\nuse of Negro personnel in free competition for any duty within the Air\r\nForce for which they may qualify.\"[11-56] Unimpressed with this\r\nfamiliar rhetoric, the _Courier_ headlined its account of the\r\nexchange, \"Air Force to Keep Segregated Policy.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-55: For discussion of the strength of\r\n                   this outside pressure, see USAF Oral History\r\n                   Program.

Putting it bluntly, they wanted to know\r\nwhy segregation was necessary in the Air Force. Zuckert could only\r\nassure them that segregation was a \"practical military expediency,\"\r\nnot an \"endorsement of belief in racial distribution.\"[11-57] But the\r\nblack leaders pressed the matter further. Why was it expedient in a\r\nsystem dedicated to consideration of the individual, asked the\r\npresident of Howard University, to segregate a Negro of superior\r\nmentality? At Yale or Harvard, Dr. Mordecai Johnson continued, he\r\nwould be kept on the team, but if he entered the Air Force he would be\r\n\"brigaded with all the people from Mississippi and Alabama who had had\r\neducation that costs $100 a year.\"[11-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-57: Department of National Defense,\r\n                   \"National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs,\" 26\r\n                   Apr 48 (morning session) p. 62. The conference,\r\n                   convened by Secretary of Defense Forrestal,\r\n                   provided an opportunity for a group of black\r\n                   leaders to question major defense officials on the\r\n                   department's racial policies.

Gen. Idwal H. Edwards, the Deputy\r\nChief of Staff for Personnel, admitted segregation was unnecessary,\r\npromised eventual integration, but stated firmly that for the present\r\nsegregation remained Air Force policy. As evidence of progress,    (p. 286)\r\nEdwards pointed to the peaceful integration of black officers in\r\ntraining at Randolph Field. For one conferee this \"progress\" led to\r\nanother conclusion: resistance to integration had to emanate from the\r\npolicymakers, not from the fighting men. All Edwards could manage in\r\nthe way of a reply was that Air Force policy was considered \"the best\r\nway to make this thing work under present conditions.\"[11-59] Later\r\nEdwards, who was not insensitive to the arguments of the black\r\nleaders, told Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington that\r\nperhaps some recommendation \"looking toward the integration of whites\r\nand negroes in the same units may be forthcoming\" from the Air Board's\r\nstudy of racial policy which was to commence the first week in\r\nMay.[11-60]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-59: Ibid., p. 69.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-60: Memo, Edwards for SecAF, 29 Apr 48,\r\n                   sub: Conference With Group of Prominent Negroes,\r\n                   Negro Affairs 1948, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nIf the logic of the black leaders impressed General Edwards, the\r\ndemands themselves had little effect on policy. It remained for James\r\nC. Evans, now the adviser to Secretary of Defense Forrestal, to\r\ntranslate these questions and demands into recommendations for\r\nspecific action. Taking advantage of a long acquaintance with the\r\nSecretary of the Air Force, Evans discussed the department's race\r\nproblem with him in May 1948. Symington was sympathetic. \"Put it on\r\npaper,\" he told Evans.[11-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-61: Interv, author with Evans, 7 Apr 70;\r\n                   Note, Evans to Col Marr, 8 Jun 50, SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\nCouching his recommendations in terms of the Gillem Board policy,\r\nEvans faithfully summarized for the secretary the demands of black\r\nleaders. Specifically, he asked that Colonel Davis, the commander of\r\nLockbourne Air Force Base, be sent for advanced military schooling\r\nwithout delay. Diversification of career was long overdue for Davis,\r\nthe ranking black officer in the Air Force, as it was for others who\r\nwere considered indispensable because of the small number of qualified\r\nblack leaders. For Davis, most of all, the situation was unfair since\r\nhe had always been in command of practically all rated black officers.\r\nNor was it good for his subordinates. The Air Force should not\r\nhesitate to assign a white replacement for Davis. In effect, Evans was\r\ntelling Symington that the black community would understand the\r\nnecessity for such a move.\r\n\r\nBesides, under the program Evans was recommending, the all-black wing\r\nwould soon cease to exist. He wanted the Air Force to \"deemphasize\"\r\nLockbourne as the black air base and scatter the black units\r\nconcentrated there. He wanted to see Negroes dispersed throughout the\r\nAir Force, either individually or in small units contemplated by the\r\nGillem Board, but he wanted men assigned on the basis of technical\r\nspecialty and proficiency rather than race. It was unrealistic, he\r\ndeclared, to assume all black officers could be most effectively\r\nutilized as pilots and all enlisted men as Squadron F laborers.\r\nLimiting training and job opportunity because of race reduced fighting\r\npotential in a way that never could be justified. The Air Force should\r\nopen to its Negroes a wide variety of training, experience, and\r\nopportunity to acquire versatility and proficiency.[11-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-62: Memo, Evans for SecAF, 7 Jun 48, sub:\r\n                   Negro Air Units, D54-1-12. SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nIf followed, this program would fundamentally alter Air Force      (p. 287)\r\nracial practices. General Edwards recommended that the reply to Evans\r\nshould state that certain policy changes would be forthcoming,\r\nalthough they would have to await the outcome of a departmental\r\nreevaluation currently under way. The suggestions had been solicited\r\nby Symington, and Edwards was anxious for Evans to understand the\r\ndelay was not a device to defer action.[11-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-63: DCofS/P Summary Sheet for CofS, 15\r\n                   Jul 48, sub: Negro Air Units, Negro Affairs 1948,\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL EDWARDS.]\r\n\r\nEdwards was in a position to make such assurances. He was an\r\ninfluential member of the Air staff with considerable experience in\r\nthe field of race relations. As a member of the Army staff during\r\nWorld War II he had worked closely with the old McCloy committee on\r\nblack troops and had strongly advocated wartime experiments with the\r\nintegration of small-scale units.[11-64] His background, along with his\r\nobservations as chief personnel officer in the new Air Force, had\r\ntaught him to avoid abstract appeals to justice and to make\r\nsuggestions in terms of military efficiency. Concern with efficiency\r\nled him, soon after the Air Force became a separate service, to order\r\nLt. Col. Jack F. Marr, a member of his staff, to study the Air Force's\r\nracial policy and practices. Testifying to Edwards's pragmatic\r\napproach, Marr later said of his own introduction to the subject:\r\n\"There was no sociology involved. It was merely a routine staff action\r\nalong with a bunch of other staff actions that were taking place.\"[11-65]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-64: During World War II, Edwards served\r\n                   as the Army's Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3.

Gen. Richard E. Nugent, then Director (p. 288)\r\nof Civilian Personnel, to reexamine the service's race policy.[11-67]\r\nNugent was another Air Force official who viewed the employment of\r\nNegroes as a problem in military efficiency.[11-68] These three,\r\nEdwards, Nugent, and Marr, were the chief figures in the development\r\nof the Air Force integration plan, which grew out of the Nugent\r\ngroup's study. Edwards and Nugent supervised its many refinements in\r\nthe staff while Marr, whom Zuckert later described as the\r\nindispensable man, wrote the plan and remained intimately connected\r\nwith it until the Air Force carried it out.[11-69] Antedating the\r\nTruman order to integrate the services, the provisions of this plan\r\neventually became the program under which the Air Force was\r\nintegrated.[11-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-66: A group created to review policy and\r\n                   make recommendations to the Chief of Staff when\r\n                   called upon, the Air Board consisted at this time\r\n                   of the Assistant Chiefs of the Air Staff, the Air\r\n                   Inspector, the Air Comptroller, the Director of\r\n                   Information, the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff\r\n                   for Research and Development, and other officials\r\n                   when appropriate.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-67: Memo, Maj Leon Bell for Zuckert, 27\r\n                   Oct 48, SecAF files.

The board\r\n                   rejected the plan at the behest of Secretary of the\r\n                   Army Royall, but later in the year outside pressure\r\n                   caused it to be reconsidered. Nothing is available\r\n                   in the files to corroborate Marr's recollections,\r\n                   nor do the other participants remember that Royall\r\n                   was ever involved in the Air Force's internal\r\n                   affairs. The records do not show when the Air Force\r\n                   study of race policy, which originated in the Air\r\n                   Board in May 1948, evolved into the plan for\r\n                   integration that Marr wrote and the Chief of Staff\r\n                   signed in December 1948, but it seems unlikely that\r\n                   the plan would have been ready before June.

It isolated several reasons for this divergence. Black\r\nairmen on the whole, as measured by classification tests, were\r\nunsuitable and inadequate for operating all-black air units organized\r\nand trained for modern combat. To achieve a balance of skills and\r\ntraining in black units was a \"never ending problem for which there\r\nappears to be no solution under either the current Air Force policies\r\nor the policies recommended by the Gillem Board.\" In short, practices\r\nwith respect to Negroes were \"wasteful, deleterious to military\r\neffectiveness and lacking in wartime application.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-71: The Air Force integration plan\r\n                   underwent considerable revision and modification\r\n                   before its submission to the Secretary of Defense\r\n                   in January 1949. The quotations in the next\r\n                   paragraphs are taken from the version approved by\r\n                   the Chief of Staff on 29 December 1948.]\r\n\r\nEdwards and his staff saw several advantages in complete           (p. 289)\r\nintegration. Wherever qualified black airmen had been permitted to\r\ncompete with whites on their individual qualifications and abilities,\r\nthe Negroes \"achieved a certain amount of acceptance and recognition.\"\r\nStudents in some schools lived and learned side by side as a matter of\r\npractical necessity. \"This degree of integration and acceptance on a\r\ncompetitive basis has been eminently successful and has to a\r\nremarkable degree solved the 'Negro problem' for the training schools\r\ninvolved.\" At some bases qualified black airmen were administratively\r\nassigned to black units but actually performed duties in white units.\r\nSome commanders had requested that these men be permanently\r\ntransferred and assigned to the white units because the men deserved\r\nhigher grades but could not receive them in black units and because it\r\nwas poor management to have individuals performing duties for one\r\nmilitary organization and living under the administrative jurisdiction\r\nof another.\r\n\r\nIn the end consideration of full integration was dropped in favor of a\r\nprogram based on the Navy's postwar integration of its general\r\nservice. Edwards and his personnel staff dismissed the Navy's problems\r\nwith stewards and its difficulty in enlisting skilled Negroes as\r\ntemporary embarrassments with little practical consequence. This\r\nproblem apparently allowed an economic and efficient use of Negroes\r\nand also \"relieved the Navy of the necessity for repeated efforts to\r\njustify an untenable position.\" They saw several practical advantages\r\nin a similar policy for the Air Force. It would allow the elimination\r\nof the 10 percent quota. The inactivation of some black units--\"and\r\nthe pronounced relief of the problems involved in maintaining those\r\nunits under present conditions\"--could be accomplished without\r\ninjustice to Negroes and with benefit to the Air Force. Nor would the\r\nintegration of qualified Negroes in technical and combat units\r\nappreciably alter current practices; according to contemporary\r\nestimates such skilled men would never total more that 1 percent of\r\nthe service's manpower.\r\n\r\nThe logic of social justice might have led to total integration, but\r\nit would not have solved the Air Force's pressing problem of too many\r\nunskilled blacks. It was consideration of military efficiency,\r\ntherefore, that led these personnel experts to propose a system of\r\nlimited integration along the lines of the Navy's postwar policy. Such\r\na system, they concluded, would release the Air Force from its quota\r\nobligation--and hence its continuing surplus of unskilled men--and\r\nfree it to assign its relatively small group of skilled black recruits\r\nwhere they were needed and might advance.\r\n\r\nAlthough limited, the proposed reform was substantial enough to arouse\r\nopposition. General Edwards reported overwhelming opposition to any\r\nform of integration among Air Force officers, and never during the\r\nspring of 1948 did the Chief of Staff seriously consider even partial\r\nintegration.[11-72] But if integration, even in a small dose, was\r\nunpalatable, widespread inefficiency was intolerable. And a new    (p. 290)\r\nservice, still in the process of developing policy, might embrace\r\nthe new and the practical, especially if pressure were exerted from\r\nabove. Assistant Secretary Zuckert intimated as much when he finally\r\nreplied to James Evans, \"You have my personal assurance that our\r\npresent position is not in the interest of maintaining the status quo,\r\nbut it is in anticipation of a more progressive and more satisfactory\r\naction in the relatively near future.\"[11-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-72: Memo, Edwards for SecAF, 29 Apr 48,\r\n                   sub: Conference With Group of Prominent Negroes,\r\n                   Negro Affairs 1948, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 11-73: Memo, Zuckert to Evans, 22 Jul 48,\r\n                   sub: Negro Air Units, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12                                                         (p. 291)\r\n\r\nThe President Intervenes\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 26 July 1948 President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981,\r\ncalling on the armed forces to provide equal treatment and opportunity\r\nfor black servicemen. This act has variously been described as an\r\nexample of presidential initiative, the capstone of the Truman civil\r\nrights program, and the climax of the struggle for racial equality in\r\nthe armed forces. But in some ways the order was simply a practical\r\nresponse to a presidential dilemma.\r\n\r\nThe President's order was related to the advent of the cold war.\r\nDevelopments in the Middle East and Europe testified to the ambitions\r\nof the Soviet Union, and many Americans feared the spread of communism\r\nthroughout the world, a threat more ominous with the erosion of\r\nAmerican military strength since World War II. In March 1947 Truman\r\nenunciated a new foreign policy calling for the containment of Soviet\r\nexpansion and pledging economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey.\r\nA year later he asked Congress to adopt the Marshall Plan for economic\r\naid to Europe, authorize military training, and enact a new selective\r\nservice law to maintain the armed forces at expanded levels. That same\r\nmonth his principal military advisers met at Key West, Florida, to\r\ndiscuss new military roles and missions for the armed forces, grapple\r\nwith paralyzing divisions among the services, and re-form the military\r\nestablishment into a genuinely unified whole.[12-1] As if to underscore\r\nthe urgency of these measures, the Soviet Union began in April 1948 to\r\nharass Allied troops in Berlin, an action that would develop into a\r\nfull-scale blockade by June.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-1: On the development of cold war roles\r\n                   and missions for the services, see Timothy W.\r\n                   Stanley, _American Defense and National Security_\r\n                   (Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1956), Chapter\r\n                   VIII.]\r\n\r\nIntegration of the armed forces hardly loomed large on the\r\ninternational scene, but if the problem of race appeared insignificant\r\nto military planners, the sheer number of Negroes in the armed forces\r\ngave them new prominence in national defense. Because of postwar\r\nracial quotas, particularly in the Army and Air Force, black\r\nservicemen now constituted a significant segment of the service\r\npopulation, and consequently their abilities and well-being had a\r\ndirect bearing on the nation's cold war defenses. The black community\r\nrepresented 10 percent of the country's manpower, and this also\r\ninfluenced defense planning. Black threats to boycott the segregated\r\narmed forces could not be ignored, and civil rights demands had to be\r\nconsidered in developing laws relating to selective service and\r\nuniversal training. Nor could the administration overlook the fact\r\nthat the United States had become a leading protagonist in a cold war\r\nin which the sympathies of the undeveloped and mostly colored world\r\nwould soon assume a special importance. Inasmuch as integration of\r\nthe services had become an almost universal demand of the black    (p. 292)\r\ncommunity, integration became, willy-nilly, an important defense\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nA second stimulus to improvement of the black serviceman's position\r\nwas the Truman administration's strong civil rights program, which\r\ngave executive sanction to a national movement started some years\r\nbefore. The civil rights movement was the product of many factors,\r\nincluding the federal government's increased sense of responsibility\r\nfor the welfare of all its citizens, a sense that had grown out of the\r\nNew Deal and a world war which expanded horizons and increased\r\neconomic power for much of the black population. The Supreme Court had\r\nrecently accelerated this movement by broadening its interpretation of\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. In the black community itself greater\r\nparticipation in elections and new techniques in community action were\r\neroding discriminatory traditions and practices in many communities.\r\n\r\nThe civil rights movement had in fact progressed by 1948 to a stage at\r\nwhich it was politically attractive for a Democratic president to\r\nassume a vigorous civil rights stance. The urban black vote had become\r\na major goal of Truman's election campaign, and he was being pressed\r\nrepeatedly by his advisers to demonstrate his support for black\r\ninterests. A presidential order on armed forces integration logically\r\nfollowed because the services, conspicuous practitioners of\r\nsegregation and patently susceptible to unilateral action on the part\r\nof the Chief Executive, were obvious and necessary targets in the\r\nblack voters' campaign for civil rights.\r\n\r\nFinally, the integration order resulted in part from the move toward\r\nservice unification and the emergence of James V. Forrestal as\r\nSecretary of Defense. Despite misgivings over centralized control of\r\nthe nation's defense establishment and overconcentration of power in\r\nthe hands of a Secretary of Defense, Forrestal soon discovered that\r\ncertain problems rising out of common service experiences naturally\r\nconverged on the office of the secretary. Both by philosophy and\r\ntemperament he was disposed to avoid a clash with the services over\r\nintegration. He remained sensitive to their interests and rights, and\r\nhe frankly doubted the efficacy of social change through executive\r\nfiat. Yet Forrestal was not impervious to the aspirations of the civil\r\nrights activists; guided by a humane interest in racial equality, he\r\nmade integration a departmental goal. His technique for achieving\r\nintegration, however, proved inadequate in the face of strong service\r\nopposition, and finally the President, acting on the basis of these\r\nseemingly unrelated motives, had to issue the executive order to\r\nstrengthen the defense secretary's hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Truman Administration and Civil Rights_\r\n\r\nExecutive and legislative interest in the civil rights of black\r\nAmericans reached a level in 1948 unmatched since Reconstruction. The\r\nPresident himself was the catalyst. By creating a presidential\r\ncommittee on civil rights and developing a legislative program based\r\non its findings, Truman brought the black minority into the political\r\narena and committed the federal government to a program of social\r\nlegislation that it has continued to support ever since. Little in (p. 293)\r\nthe President's background suggested he would sponsor basic social\r\nchanges. He was a son of the middle border, from a family firmly\r\ndedicated to the Confederate cause. His appreciation of black\r\naspirations was hardly sophisticated, as he revealed to a black\r\naudience in 1940: \"I wish to make it clear that I am not appealing for\r\nsocial equality of the Negro. The Negro himself knows better than\r\nthat, and the highest types of Negro leaders say quite frankly they\r\nprefer the society of their own people. Negroes want justice, not\r\nsocial relations.\"[12-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-2: Jonathan Daniels, _The Man of\r\n                   Independence_ (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1950), p.\r\n                   338. The quotation is from a speech before the\r\n                   National Colored Democratic Convention, Chicago,\r\n                   reprinted in the _Congressional Record_, 76th\r\n                   Cong., 3d sess., vol. 86, 5 Aug 1940, Appendix, pp.\r\n                   5367-69.]\r\n\r\nNor did his attitude change drastically in later years. In 1961, seven\r\nyears after the Supreme Court's vital school integration decision,\r\nTruman was calling the Freedom Riders \"meddlesome intruders who should\r\nstay at home and attend to their own business.\" His suggestion to\r\nproprietors of lunch counters undergoing sit-ins was to kick out\r\nunwelcome customers.[12-3] But if he failed to appreciate the scope of\r\nblack demands, Truman nevertheless demonstrated as early as 1940 an\r\nacute awareness of the connection between civil rights for blacks and\r\ncivil liberties for all Americans:\r\n\r\n     In giving Negroes the rights which are theirs we are only acting\r\n     in accord with our own ideals of a true democracy. If any class\r\n     or race can be permanently set apart from, or pushed down below\r\n     the rest in political and civil rights, so may any other class or\r\n     race when it shall incur the displeasure of its more powerful\r\n     associates, and we may say farewell to the principles on which we\r\n     count our safety.[12-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-3: Quoted in James Peck, _Freedom Ride_\r\n                   (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1962), pp. 154-55.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-4: Quoted in Daniels, _Man of\r\n                   Independence_, pp. 339-40.]\r\n\r\nHe would repeat these sentiments to other gatherings, including the\r\nassembled delegates of the NAACP's 1946 convention.[12-5] The President's\r\ncivil rights program would be based, then, on a practical concern for\r\nthe rights of the majority. Neither his social philosophy nor his\r\npolitical use of black demands should detract from his achievements in\r\nthe field of civil rights.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-5: Msg, HST to NAACP Convention, 29 Jun\r\n                   47, _Public Papers of the President, 1947_\r\n                   (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1963), pp.\r\n                   311-13.]\r\n\r\nIt was probably just as well that Truman adopted a pragmatic approach\r\nto civil rights, for there was little social legislation a reform\r\npresident could hope to get through the postwar Congresses. Dominated\r\nby a conservative coalition that included the Dixiecrats, a group of\r\nsometimes racially reactionary southerners, Congress showed little\r\ninterest in civil rights. The creation of a permanent Fair Employment\r\nPractices Commission, the one piece of legislation directly affecting\r\nNegroes and the only current test of congressional intent in civil\r\nrights, was floundering on Capitol Hill. Truman conspicuously\r\nsupported the fair employment measure, but did little else\r\nspecifically in the first year after the war to advance civil rights.\r\nInstead he seemed content to carry on with the New Deal approach to\r\nthe problem: improve the social condition of all Americans and the\r\ncondition of the minorities will also improve. In this vein his first\r\ndomestic program concentrated on national projects for housing,\r\nhealth, and veterans' benefits.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of Harry Truman into a forceful civil rights        (p. 294)\r\nadvocate seems to have come about, at least partially, from his\r\nexposure to what he later called the \"anti-minority\" incidents visited\r\non black servicemen and civilians in 1946.[12-6] Although the lynchings,\r\nproperty destruction, and assaults never matched the racial violence\r\nthat followed World War I, they were enough to convince many civil\r\nrights leaders that the pattern of racial strife was being repeated.\r\nSome of these men, along with a group of labor executives and\r\nclergymen, formed a National Emergency Committee Against Mob Violence\r\nto warn the American public against the dangers of racial intolerance.\r\nA delegation from this committee, with Walter White as spokesman, met\r\nwith the President on 19 September 1946 to demand government action.\r\nWhite described the scene:\r\n\r\n     The President sat quietly, elbows resting on the arms of his\r\n     chair and his fingers interlocked against his stomach as he\r\n     listened with a grim face to the story of the lynchings.... When\r\n     I finished, the President exclaimed in his flat, midwestern\r\n     accent, \"My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We've\r\n     got to do something!\"[12-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-6: Harry S. Truman, _Memoirs_ (New York:\r\n                   Doubleday, 1958), II:180-81; White, _A Man Called\r\n                   White_, pp. 330-31. Truman's concept of civil\r\n                   rights is analyzed in considerable detail in Donald\r\n                   R. McCoy and Richard T. Ruetten, _Quest and\r\n                   Response: Minority Rights and the Truman\r\n                   Administration_ (Lawrence, Kansas: University of\r\n                   Kansas Press, 1973), Chapter III.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-7: White, _A Man Called White_, pp.\r\n                   330-31.]\r\n\r\nBut the Truman administration had nearly exhausted the usual remedies\r\nopen to it. The Attorney General had investigated the lynchings and\r\nKlan activities and the President had spoken out strongly and\r\nrepeatedly against mob violence but without clear and pertinent civil\r\nrights legislation presidential exhortations and investigations\r\ncounted for very little. Civil rights leaders like White understood\r\nthis, and, given the mood of Congress, they were resigned to the lack\r\nof legislative support. Nevertheless, it was in this context that the\r\nPresident decided to create a committee to investigate and report on\r\nthe status of civil rights in America.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a federal civil rights group had been circulating in\r\nthe executive branch for some time. After the Detroit race riot in\r\n1943, presidential assistant Jonathan Daniels had organized a\r\ncommittee to deal with racial troubles. Proposals to create a national\r\norganization to reduce racial tensions were advanced later in the war,\r\nprincipally by Saul K. Padover, a minority specialist in the Interior\r\nDepartment, and David K. Niles of the White House staff. Little came\r\nof the committee idea, however, because Roosevelt was convinced that\r\nany steps associated with integration would prove divisive and were\r\nunwise during wartime.[12-8] With the war over and a different political\r\nclimate prevailing, Niles, now senior White House adviser on minority\r\naffairs, proposed the formation of a committee not only to investigate\r\nracial violence but also to explore the entire subject of civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-8: Intervs, Nichols with Oscar Ewing,\r\n                   former federal security administrator and senior\r\n                   presidential adviser, and Jonathan Daniels, 1954,\r\n                   in Nichols Collection, CMH; see also McCoy and\r\n                   Ruetten, _Quest and Response_, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nWalter White and his friends greeted the idea with some skepticism.\r\nThey had come demanding action, but were met instead with another\r\npromise of a committee and the probability of interminable         (p. 295)\r\ncongressional debate and unproductive hearings.[12-9] But this time,\r\nfor several reasons, it would be different. In the first place the\r\ncivil rights leaders underestimated the sincerity of Truman's reaction\r\nto the racial violence. He had quickly agreed to create Niles's\r\ncommittee by executive order to save it from possible pigeonholing at\r\nthe hands of a hostile Congress. He had also given the group, called\r\nthe President's Committee on Civil Rights, a broad directive \"to\r\ndetermine whether and in what respect current law enforcement measures\r\nand the authority and means possessed by Federal, State, and local\r\ngovernments may be strengthened and improved to safeguard the civil\r\nrights of the people.\"[12-10] The civil rights leaders also failed to\r\ngauge the effect Republican victories in the 1946 congressional\r\nelections would have on the administration. Finding it necessary to\r\ncourt the Negro and other minorities and hoping to confound\r\ncongressional opposition, the administration sought a strong civil\r\nrights program to put before the Eightieth Congress. Thus, the\r\ncommittee's recommendations would get respectful attention in the\r\nWhite House. Finally, neither the civil rights leaders nor the\r\nPresident could have foreseen the effectiveness of the committee\r\nmembers. Serving under Charles E. Wilson, president of the General\r\nElectric Company, the group included among its fifteen members\r\ndistinguished church leaders, public service lawyers, the presidents\r\nof Dartmouth College and the University of North Carolina, and\r\nprominent labor executives. The committee had two black members, Sadie\r\nT. M. Alexander, a lawyer from Philadelphia, and Channing H. Tobias,\r\ndirector of the Phelps-Stokes Fund. Its members not only prepared a\r\ncomprehensive survey of the condition of civil rights in America but\r\nalso presented to the President on 29 October 1947 a far-reaching\r\nseries of recommendations, in effect a program for corrective action\r\nthat would serve as a bench mark for civil rights progress for many\r\nyears.[12-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-9: White, _A Man Called White_, pp.\r\n                   330-31.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-10: Executive Order 9808, 5 Dec 46.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-11: In addition to Chairman Wilson, the\r\n                   following people served on the committee: Sadie T.\r\n                   M. Alexander, James B. Carey, John S. Dickey,\r\n                   Morris L. Ernst, Roland B. Gittelsohn, Frank P.\r\n                   Graham, Francis J. Haas, Charles Luckman, Francis\r\n                   P. Matthews, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., Henry Knox\r\n                   Sherrill, Boris Shishkin, Dorothy Tilly, and\r\n                   Channing Tobias.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALTER WHITE.]\r\n\r\nThe group recommended the concentration of civil rights work in the\r\nDepartment of Justice, the establishment of a permanent civil rights\r\ncommission, a federal antilynching act, a permanent Fair Employment\r\nPractices Commission, and legislation to correct discrimination in\r\nvoting and naturalization laws. It also examined the state of      (p. 296)\r\ncivil rights in the armed forces and incidentally publicized the\r\nlong-ignored survey of black infantry platoons that had fought in\r\nEurope in 1945.[12-12] It concluded:\r\n\r\n     The injustice of calling men to fight for freedom while\r\n     subjecting them to humiliating discrimination within the fighting\r\n     forces is at once apparent. Furthermore, by preventing entire\r\n     groups from making their maximum contribution to the national\r\n     defense, we weaken our defense to that extent and impose heavier\r\n     burdens on the remainder of the population.[12-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-12: Parts of the survey of attitudes of\r\n                   participants in the World War II integration of\r\n                   platoons were included in remarks by Congresswoman\r\n                   Helen G. Douglas, published in the _Congressional\r\n                   Record_, 79th Cong., 2d sess., 1 Feb 1946,\r\n                   Appendix, pp. 432-443.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-13: _To Secure These Rights_, p. 162.]\r\n\r\nThe committee called for sweeping change in the armed forces,\r\nrecommending that Congress enact legislation, followed by appropriate\r\nadministrative action, to end all discrimination and segregation in\r\nthe services. Concluding that the recent service unification provided\r\na timely opportunity for revision of existing policies and practices,\r\nthe committee proposed a specific ban on discrimination and\r\nsegregation in all phases of recruitment, assignment, and training,\r\nincluding selection for service schools and academies, as well as in\r\nmess halls, quarters, recreational facilities, and post exchanges. It\r\nalso wanted commissions and promotions awarded on merit alone and\r\nasked for new laws to protect servicemen from discrimination in\r\ncommunities adjacent to military bases.[12-14] The committee wanted the\r\nPresident to look beyond the integration of people working and living\r\non military bases, and it introduced a concept that would gain\r\nconsiderable support in a future administration. The armed forces, it\r\ndeclared, _should_ be used as an instrument of social change. World\r\nWar II had demonstrated that the services were a laboratory in which\r\ncitizens could be educated on a broad range of social and political\r\nissues, and the administration was neglecting an effective technique\r\nfor teaching the public the advantages of providing equal treatment\r\nand opportunity for all citizens.[12-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-14: Ibid., pp. 162-63.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-15: Ibid., p. 47.]\r\n\r\nPresident Truman deleted the recommendations on civil rights in the\r\nservices when he transmitted the committee's recommendations to\r\nCongress in the form of a special message on 2 February 1948. Arguing\r\nthat the services' race practices were matters of executive interest\r\nand pointing to recent progress toward better race relations in the\r\narmed forces, the President told Congress that he had already\r\ninstructed the Secretary of Defense to take steps to eliminate\r\nremaining instances of discrimination in the services as rapidly as\r\npossible. He also promised that the personnel policies and practices\r\nof all the services would be made uniform.[12-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-16: Truman, Special Message to the\r\n                   Congress on Civil Rights, 2 Feb 48, _Public Papers\r\n                   of the President, 1948_, pp. 121-26.]\r\n\r\nTo press for civil rights legislation for the armed forces or even to\r\nmention segregation was politically imprudent. Truman had two pieces\r\nof military legislation to get through Congress: a new draft law and a\r\nprovision for universal military training. These he considered     (p. 297)\r\ntoo vital to the nation's defense to risk grounding on the shoals of\r\nracial controversy. For the time being at least, integration of the\r\narmed forces would have to be played down, and any civil rights\r\nprogress in the Department of Defense would have to depend on the\r\npersuasiveness of James Forrestal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUMAN'S CIVIL RIGHTS CAMPAIGN _as seen by Washington\r\nStar cartoonist Clifford K. Berryman, March 14, 1948_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Civil Rights and the Department of Defense_\r\n\r\nThe basic postwar reorganization of the National Military\r\nEstablishment, the National Security Act of 1947, created the Office\r\nof the Secretary of Defense, a separate Department of the Air Force,\r\nthe Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Council. It\r\nalso reconstituted the War Department as the Department of the Army\r\nand gave legal recognition as a permanent agency to the Joint Chiefs\r\nof Staff. The principle of military unification that underlay the\r\nreorganization plan was muted in the legislation that finally emerged\r\nfrom Congress. Although the Secretary of Defense was given authority\r\nto establish general policies and to exercise general direction    (p. 298)\r\nand control of the services, the services themselves retained a large\r\nmeasure of autonomy in their internal administration and individual\r\nservice secretaries retained cabinet rank. In effect, the act created\r\na secretary without a department, a reorganization that largely\r\nreflected the viewpoint of the Navy. The Army had fought for a much\r\ngreater degree of unification, which would not be achieved until the\r\npassage of the National Security Act amendments of 1949. This\r\nlegislation redesignated the unified department the Department of\r\nDefense, strengthened the powers of the Secretary of Defense, and\r\nprovided for uniform budgetary procedures. Although the services were\r\nto be \"separately administered,\" their respective secretaries\r\nhenceforward headed \"military departments\" without cabinet status.\r\n\r\nThe first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, was a man of\r\nexceptional administrative talents, yet even before taking office he\r\nexpressed strong reservations on the wisdom of a unified military\r\ndepartment. As early as 30 July 1945, at breakfast with President\r\nTruman during the Potsdam Conference, Forrestal questioned whether any\r\none man \"was good enough to run the combined Army, Navy, and Air\r\nDepartments.\" What kind of men could the president get in peacetime,\r\nhe asked, to be under secretaries of War, Navy, and Air if they were\r\nsubordinate to a single defense secretary?[12-17] Speaking to Lester\r\nGranger that same year on the power of the Secretary of the Navy to\r\norder the Marine Corps to accept Negroes, Forrestal expressed\r\nuncertainty about a cabinet officer's place in the scheme of things.\r\n\"Some people think the Secretary is god-almighty, but he's just a\r\ngod-damn civilian.\"[12-18] Even after his appointment as defense\r\nsecretary doubts lingered: \"My chief misgivings about unification\r\nderived from my fear that there would be a tendency toward\r\noverconcentration and reliance on one man or one-group direction. In\r\nother words, too much central control.\"[12-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-17: Quoted in Walter Millis, ed., _The\r\n                   Forrestal Diaries_ (New York: Viking Press, 1951),\r\n                   p. 88.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-18: Quoted by Granger in the interview he\r\n                   gave Nichols in 1954.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-19: Quoted in Millis, _Forrestal\r\n                   Diaries_, p. 301.]\r\n\r\nForrestal's philosophy of management reinforced the limitations placed\r\non the Secretary of Defense by the National Security Act. He sought a\r\nmiddle way in which the efficiency of a unified system could be\r\nobtained without sacrificing what he considered to be the real\r\nadvantages of service autonomy. Thus, he supported a 1945 report of\r\nthe defense study group under Ferdinand Eberstadt that argued for a\r\n\"coordinated\" rather than a \"unitary\" defense establishment.[12-20]\r\nPractical experience modified his fears somewhat, and by October 1948,\r\nconvinced he needed greater power to control the defense\r\nestablishment, Forrestal urged that the language of the National\r\nSecurity Act, which limited the Secretary of Defense to \"general\"\r\nauthority only over the military departments, be amended to eliminate\r\nthe word _general_. Yet he always retained his basic distrust of   (p. 299)\r\ndictation, preferring to understand and adjust rather than to conclude\r\nand order.[12-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-20: Ibid., pp. 117, 147. Timothy Stanley\r\n                   describes the Eberstadt report as the Navy's\r\n                   \"constructive alternative\" to unification. See\r\n                   Stanley's _American Defense and National Security_,\r\n                   p. 75; see also Hewes, _From Root to McNamara_, pp.\r\n                   276-77.

His office would be\r\nconcerned with equal opportunity, he promised Walter White soon after\r\nhis elevation to the new post, but \"the job of Secretary of Defense,\"\r\nhe warned, \"is one which will have to develop in an evolutionary\r\nrather than a revolutionary manner.\" Further dashing hopes of sudden\r\nreform, Forrestal added that specific racial problems, as distinct\r\nfrom general policy matters, would remain the province of the\r\nindividual services.[12-22] He retained this attitude throughout his\r\ntenure. He considered the President's instructions to end remaining\r\ninstances of discrimination in the services \"in accord with my own\r\nconception of my responsibilities under unification,\" and he was in\r\nwholehearted agreement with a presidential wish that the National\r\nMilitary Establishment work out the answer to its racial problems\r\nthrough administrative action. He wanted to see a \"more nearly uniform\r\napproach to interracial problems by the three Services,\" but\r\nexperience had demonstrated, he believed, that racial problems could\r\nnot be solved simply by publishing an executive order or passing a\r\nlaw. Racial progress would come from education. Such had been his\r\nobservation in the wartime Navy, and he was ready to promise that\r\n\"even greater progress will be made in the future.\" But, he added,\r\n\"progress must be made administratively and should not be put into\r\neffect by fiat.\"[12-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-22: Ltr, Forrestal to White, 21 Oct 47,\r\n                   Day file, Forrestal Papers, Princeton University\r\n                   Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-23: Remarks by James Forrestal at Dinner\r\n                   Meeting of the National Urban League, 12 Feb 48,\r\n                   copy in Misc file, Forrestal Papers; see also Ltr,\r\n                   Forrestal to John N.

Ohly, his civilian aide,\r\nJames C. Evans,[12-24] and Truman Gibson urged the secretary to consider\r\nestablishing an interservice committee along the lines of the old\r\nMcCloy committee to prepare a uniform racial policy that he could\r\napply to all the services. They wanted the committee to examine past\r\nand current practices as well as the recent reports of the President's\r\nAdvisory Commission on Universal Training and the Committee on Civil\r\nRights and to make specific recommendations for carrying out and\r\npolicing department policy. Truman Gibson went to the heart of the\r\nmatter: the formulation of such an interservice committee would signal\r\nto the black community better than anything else the defense\r\nestablishment's determination to change the racial situation. More and\r\nmore, he warned, the discrepancies among the services' racial\r\npractices were attracting public attention. Most important to the\r\nadministration was the fact that these discrepancies were\r\nstrengthening opposition to universal military training and the\r\ndraft.[12-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-24: In addition to his duties as Civilian\r\n                   Aide to the Secretary of the Army, Evans was made\r\n                   aide to the Secretary of Defense on 29 October\r\n                   1947.

(_Detail from\r\npainting by Betsy G. Reyneau._)]\r\n\r\nGibson was no doubt referring to A. Philip Randolph, president     (p. 300)\r\nof the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and organizer of the 1940\r\nMarch on Washington Movement, who had spoken out against the pending\r\nlegislation. Randolph was particularly concerned that the bill did not\r\nprohibit segregation, and he quoted a member of the Advisory\r\nCommission on Universal Training who admitted that the bill ignored\r\nthe racial issue because \"the South might oppose UMT if Negroes were\r\nincluded.\" Drafting eighteen-year olds into a segregated Army was a\r\nthreat to black progress, Randolph charged, because enforced segregation\r\nmade it difficult to break down other forms of discrimination.\r\nConvinced that the Pentagon was trying to bypass the segregation\r\nissue, Randolph and Grant Reynolds, a black clergyman and New York\r\npolitician, formed a Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service\r\nand Training. They planned to submit a proposal to the President and\r\nCongress for drafting a nondiscrimination measure for the armed\r\nforces, and they were prepared to back up this demand with a march on\r\nWashington--no empty gesture in an election year. Randolph had\r\nimpressive backing from black leaders, among them Dr. Channing H.\r\nTobias of the Civil Rights Committee, George S. Schuyler, columnist of\r\nthe Pittsburgh _Courier_, L. D. Reddick, curator of the Schomburg\r\nCollection of the New York Public Library, and Joe Louis.[12-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-26: New York Times, November 23, 1947;\r\n                   _Herald Tribune_, November 23, 1947. See also L. D.\r\n                   Reddick, \"The Negro Policy of the American Army\r\n                   Since World War II,\" _Journal of Negro History_ 38\r\n                   (April 1953):194-215.]\r\n\r\nBlack spokesmen were particularly incensed by the attitude of the\r\nSecretary of the Army and his staff. Walter White pointed out that\r\nthese officials continued to justify segregated units on the grounds\r\nthat segregation was--he quoted them--\"in the interest of national\r\ndefense.\" White went to special pains to refute the Army's contention\r\nthat segregation was necessary because the Army had to conform to\r\nlocal laws and customs. \"How,\" he asked Secretary Forrestal,\r\n\r\n     can the imposition of segregation upon northern states having\r\n     clear-cut laws and policies in opposition to such practices be\r\n     justified by the Army?...\r\n\r\n     In view of President Truman's recent report to the Congress and\r\n     in view of the report of his Committee on Civil Rights condemning\r\n     segregation in the Armed Forces, I am at a loss to understand the\r\n     reluctance on the part of the Department of Defense to\r\n     immediately eliminate all vestiges of discrimination and      (p. 301)\r\n     segregation in the Armed Forces of this country. As the\r\n     foremost defender of democratic principles in international\r\n     councils, the United States can ill afford to any longer\r\n     discriminate against its Negro citizens in its Armed Forces\r\n     solely because they were fortunate or unfortunate enough to be\r\n     born Negroes.[12-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-27: Ltr, White to Forrestal, 17 Feb 48,\r\n                   D54-1-3, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nForrestal stubbornly resisted the pleas of his advisers and black\r\nleaders that he assume a more active role. In the first place he had\r\nreal doubts concerning his authority to do so. Forrestal was also\r\naware of the consequences an integration campaign would have on\r\nCapitol Hill, where he was in the midst of delicate negotiations on\r\ndefense measures. But most of all the role of crusader did not fit\r\nhim. \"I have gone somewhat slowly,\" Forrestal had written in late\r\nOctober 1947, \"because I believe in the theory of having things to\r\ntalk about as having been done rather than having to predict them, and\r\n... morale and confidence are easy to destroy but not easy to rebuild.\r\nIn other words, I want to be sure that any changes we make are changes\r\nthat accomplish something and not merely for the sake of change.\"[12-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-28: Ltr, Forrestal to Rear Adm W. B.\r\n                   Young, 23 Oct 47, quoted in Millis, _Forrestal\r\n                   Diaries_, p. 334.]\r\n\r\nTo Forrestal equal opportunity was not a pious platitude, but a\r\npractical means of solving the military's racial problems. Equal\r\nopportunity was the tactic he had used in the Navy where he had\r\nencouraged specialized training for all qualified Negroes. He\r\nunderstood that on shipboard machinists ate and bunked with\r\nmachinists, firemen with firemen. Inaugurated in the fleet, the\r\npractice naturally spread to the shore establishment, and equal\r\nopportunity led inevitably to the integration of the general service.\r\nGiven the opportunity to qualify for all specialties, Negroes--albeit\r\ntheir number was limited to the small group in the general\r\nservice--quickly gained equal treatment in off-the-job activities.\r\nForrestal intended to apply the same tactic to achieve the same\r\nresults in the other services.[12-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-29: Interv, Blumenson with Marx Leva,\r\n                   Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense\r\n                   (1947-49) and later Assistant Secretary of Defense\r\n                   (Legal and Legislative Affairs), 4 May 64, CMH\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nAs in the past, he turned first to Lester Granger, his old friend from\r\nthe National Urban League. Acting on the recommendation of his special\r\nassistant, Marx Leva, Forrestal invited Granger to the Pentagon to\r\ndiscuss the department's racial problems with a view to holding a\r\ngeneral conference and symposium on the subject. As usual, Granger was\r\nfull of ideas, and he and the secretary agreed that Forrestal should\r\ncreate a \"critics group,\" which would discuss \"Army and general\r\ndefense policies in the use of Negro personnel.\"[12-30] Granger suggested\r\na roster of black and white experts, influential in the black\r\ncommunity and representing most shades of opinion, but he would\r\nexclude those apt to make political capital out of the issues.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-30: Handwritten Memo, Leva for Forrestal,\r\n                   attached to Ltr, White to Forrestal, 17 Feb 48;\r\n                   Ltr, Leva to Granger, 19 Feb 48; Ltr, Granger to\r\n                   Forrestal, 2 Mar 48.

It offered the possibility of introducing to the services in\r\na systematic and documented way the complaints of responsible black\r\nleaders while instructing those leaders in the manpower problems\r\nconfronting the postwar armed forces. He hoped the conference      (p. 302)\r\nwould modify traditionalist attitudes toward integration while curbing\r\nmounting unrest in the black community. Granger and Forrestal agreed\r\nthat the conference should be held soon. Although Granger wanted some\r\n\"good solid white representation\" in the group, Forrestal decided\r\ninstead to invite fifteen black leaders to meet on 26 April in the\r\nPentagon; he alerted the service secretaries, asking them to attend or\r\nto designate an assistant to represent them in each case.[12-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-31: Memo, Marx Leva for SA et al., 13 Apr\r\n                   48; idem for Forrestal, 24 Apr 48; ltr, SecDef to\r\n                   All Invited, 10 Apr 48.

Lewis of the Pittsburgh\r\n                   _Courier_.]\r\n\r\nAnnouncement of the conference was upstaged in the press by the\r\nactivities of some civil rights militants, including those whom\r\nGranger sought to exclude from the Forrestal conference because he\r\nthought they would make a political issue of the war against\r\nsegregation. Forrestal first learned of the militants' plans from\r\nmembers of the National Negro Publishers Association, a group of\r\npublishers and editors of important black journals who were about to\r\ntour European installations as guests of the Army.[12-32] At Granger's\r\nsuggestion Forrestal had met with the publishers and editors to\r\nexplain the causes for the delay in desegregating the services.\r\nInstead, he found himself listening to an impassioned demand for\r\nimmediate change. Ira F. Lewis, president of the Pittsburgh _Courier_\r\nand spokesman for the group, told the secretary that the black\r\ncommunity did not expect the services to be a laboratory or\r\nclearinghouse for processing the social ills of the nation, but it\r\nwanted to warn the man responsible for military preparedness that the\r\nUnited States could not afford another war with one-tenth of its\r\npopulation lacking the spirit to fight. The problem of segregation\r\ncould best be solved by the policymakers. \"The colored people of the\r\ncountry have a high regard for you, Mr. Secretary, as a square\r\nshooter,\" Lewis concluded. And from Forrestal they expected\r\naction.[12-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-32: Representing eight papers, a cross\r\n                   section of the influential black press, the\r\n                   journalists included Ira F.

Randolph concentrated on one explosive issue, the Army's\r\nprocurement of troops. The first War Department plans for postwar\r\nmanpower procurement were predicated on some form of universal\r\nmilitary training, a new concept for the United States. The plans\r\nimmediately came under fire from Negroes because the Army, citing the\r\nGillem Board Report as its authority, had specified that black\r\nrecruits be trained in segregated units. The Army had also specified\r\nthat the black units form parts of larger, racially mixed units and\r\nwould be trained in racially mixed camps.[12-34] The President's   (p. 303)\r\nAdvisory Commission on Universal Training (the Compton Commission),\r\nappointed to study the Army's program, strongly objected to the\r\nsegregation provisions, but to no avail.[12-35] As if to signal its\r\nintentions the Army trained an experimental universal military\r\ntraining unit in 1947 at Fort Knox that carefully excluded black\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-34: WD Ltr, AGAO-S 353 (28 May 47),\r\n                   WDGOT-M, 11 Jun 47.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-35: _A Program for National Security:\r\n                   Report of the President's Advisory Commission on\r\n                   Universal Training, 29 May 1947_ (Washington:\r\n                   Government Printing Office, 1947), p. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe showdown between civil rights organizations and the administration\r\nover universal military training never materialized. Faced with\r\nchronic opposition to the program and the exigencies of the cold war,\r\nthe administration quietly shelved universal training and concentrated\r\ninstead on the reestablishment of the selective service system. When\r\nblack attention naturally shifted to the new draft legislation,\r\nRandolph was able to capitalize on the determination of many leaders\r\nin the civil rights movement to defeat any draft law that countenanced\r\nthe Army's racial policy. Appearing at the Senate Armed Services\r\nCommittee hearings on the draft bill, Randolph raised the specter of\r\ncivil disobedience, pledging\r\n\r\n     to openly counsel, aid, and abet youth, both white and Negro, to\r\n     quarantine any Jim Crow conscription system, whether it bear the\r\n     label of universal military training or selective service....\r\n\r\n     From coast to coast in my travels I shall call upon all Negro\r\n     veterans to join this civil disobedience movement and to recruit\r\n     their younger brothers in an organized refusal to register and be\r\n     drafted....\r\n\r\n     I shall appeal to the thousands of white youths ... to\r\n     demonstrate their solidarity with Negro youth by ignoring the\r\n     entire registration and induction machinery....\r\n\r\n     I shall appeal to the Negro parents to lend their moral support\r\n     to their sons, to stand behind them as they march with heads held\r\n     high to Federal prisons as a telling demonstration to the world\r\n     that Negroes have reached the limit of human endurance, that, in\r\n     the words of the spiritual, we will be buried in our graves\r\n     before we will be slaves.[12-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-36: Senate, Hearings Before the Committee\r\n                   on Armed Services, _Universal Military Training_,\r\n                   80th Cong., 2d sess., 1948, p. 688.]\r\n\r\nRandolph argued that hard-won gains in education, job opportunity, and\r\nhousing would be nullified by federal legislation supporting\r\nsegregation. How could a Fair Employment Practices Commission, he\r\nasked, dare criticize discrimination in industry if the government\r\nitself was discriminating against Negroes in the services? \"Negroes\r\nare just sick and tired of being pushed around,\" he concluded, \"and we\r\njust do not propose to take it, and we do not care what happens.\"[12-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-37: Ibid., p. 689.]\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Wayne Morse warned Randolph that such statements in times\r\nof national emergency would leave him open to charges of treason,\r\nRandolph replied that by fighting for their rights Negroes were\r\nserving the cause of American democracy. Borrowing from the rhetoric\r\nof the cold war, he predicted that such was the effect of segregation\r\non the international fight for men's minds that America could never\r\nstop communism as long as it was burdened with Jim Crowism. Randolph\r\nthrew down the gauntlet. \"We have to face this thing sooner or     (p. 304)\r\nlater, and we might just as well face it now.\"[12-38] It was up to the\r\nadministration and Congress to decide whether his challenge was the\r\nbeginning of a mass movement or a weightless threat by an extremist\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-38: Ibid., pp. 691-94. The quotation is\r\n                   from page 694.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate reaction of various spokesmen for the black community\r\nsupported both possibilities. Also testifying before the Senate Armed\r\nServices Committee, Truman Gibson, who was a member of the Compton\r\nCommission that had objected to segregation, expressed \"shock and\r\ndismay\" at Randolph's pledge and predicted that Negroes would continue\r\nto participate in the country's defense effort.[12-39] For his pains\r\nGibson was branded a \"rubber stamp Uncle Tom\" by Congressman Adam\r\nClayton Powell. The black press, for the most part, applauded\r\nRandolph's analysis of the mood of Negroes, but shied away from the\r\nthreat of civil disobedience. The NAACP and most other civil rights\r\norganizations took the same stand, condemning segregation but\r\ndisavowing civil disobedience.[12-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-39: Ibid., p. 645.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-40: The Philadelphia _Inquirer_, April\r\n                   11, 1948; PM, April 11, 1948.

A poll of young educated Negroes\r\nconducted by the NAACP revealed that 71 percent of those of draft age\r\nwould support the civil disobedience campaign. So impressive was\r\nRandolph's support--the New York _Times_ called it a blunt warning\r\nfrom the black public--that one news journal saw in the campaign the\r\nspecter of a major national crisis.[12-41] On the other hand, the\r\nWashington _Post_ cautioned its readers not to exaggerate the\r\nsignificance of the protest. Randolph's words, the _Post_ declared,\r\nwere intended \"more as moral pressure\" for nondiscrimination clauses\r\nin pending draft and universal military training legislation than as a\r\nserious threat.[12-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-41: New York _Times_, April 1, 1948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-42: Washington _Post_, April 2, 1948.]\r\n\r\nWhatever its ultimate influence on national policy, the Randolph civil\r\ndisobedience pledge had no visible effect on the position of the\r\nPresident or Congress. With a draft bill and a national political\r\nconvention pending, the President was not about to change his\r\nhands-off policy toward the segregation issue in the services. In fact\r\nhe showed some heat at what he saw as a threat by extremists to\r\nexploit an issue he claimed he was doing his best to resolve.[12-43] As\r\nfor members of Congress, most of those who joined in the debate on the\r\ndraft bill simply ignored the threatened boycott.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-43: McCoy and Ruetten, _Quest and\r\n                   Response_, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the militant Randolph, the Negroes who gathered at\r\nSecretary Forrestal's invitation for the National Defense Conference\r\non 26 April appeared to be a rather sedate group. But academic honors,\r\nbusiness success, and gray hairs were misleading. These eminent\r\neducators, clergymen, and civil rights leaders proved just as      (p. 305)\r\ndetermined as Randolph and his associates to be rid of segregation\r\nand, considering their position in the community, were more likely to\r\ninfluence the administration. That they were their own men quickly\r\nbecame apparent in the stormy course of the Pentagon meeting. They\r\nsubjected a score of defense officials[12-44] to searching questions,\r\nsubmitted themselves to cross-examination by the press, and agreed to\r\nprepare a report for the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-44: Department of National Defense,\r\n                   \"National Defense Conference on Negro Affairs,\" 26\r\n                   Apr 48. This document includes the testimony and\r\n                   transcript of the news conference that followed.\r\n                   Officials appearing before the committee included\r\n                   James Forrestal, Secretary of Defense; Robert P.\r\n                   Patterson, former Secretary of War; Marx Leva,\r\n                   Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense;\r\n                   James Evans, Adviser to the Secretary of Defense;\r\n                   Kenneth C.

Stuart\r\n                   Symington, Secretary of the Air Force; and\r\n                   personnel officials and consultants from each\r\n                   service.]\r\n\r\nWhile the group refrained from endorsing Randolph's position, it also\r\nrefrained from criticizing him and strongly supported his thesis that\r\nsegregation in itself was discrimination. Nor were its views\r\nsoft-pedaled in the press release issued after the conference. The\r\nSecretary of Defense was forced to announce that the black leaders\r\ndeclined to serve as advisers to the National Military Establishment\r\nas long as the services continued to practice segregation. The group\r\nunanimously recommended that the armed services eliminate segregation\r\nand challenged the Army's interpretation of its own policy, insisting\r\nthat the Army could abolish segregation even within the framework of\r\nthe Gillem Board recommendations. The members planned no future\r\nmeetings but adjourned to prepare their report.[12-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-45: NME Press Releases, 26 Apr and 8 Sep\r\n                   48.]\r\n\r\nThis adamant stand should not have surprised the Secretary of Defense.\r\nForrestal could appreciate more than most the pressures operating on\r\nthe group. In the aftermath of the report of the President's Committee\r\non Civil Rights and in the heightened atmosphere caused by the\r\nrhetoric of the Randolph campaign, these men were also caught up in\r\nthe militants' cause. If they were reluctant to attack the services\r\ntoo severely lest they lose their chance to influence the course of\r\nracial events in the department, they were equally reluctant to accept\r\nthe pace of reform dictated by the traditionalists. In the end they\r\nchose to side with their more radical colleagues. Thus despite Lester\r\nGranger's attempt to soften the blow, the conference designed to bring\r\nthe opponents together ended with yet another condemnation of\r\nForrestal's gradualism.\r\n\r\nForrestal himself agreed with the goals of the conferees, he told\r\nGranger, but at the same time he refused to abandon his approach,\r\ninsisting that he could not force people into cooperation and mutual\r\nrespect by issuing a directive. Instead he arranged for Granger to\r\nmeet with Army leaders to spread the gospel of equal opportunity and\r\nordered a report prepared showing precisely what the Navy did during\r\nthe late months of the war and \"how much of it has stuck--on the\r\nquestion of non-segregation both in messing and barracks.\" The report,\r\nwritten by Lt. Dennis D. Nelson, was sent to Secretary of the Army\r\nRoyall along with sixteen photographs picturing blacks and whites  (p. 306)\r\nbeing trained together and working side by side.[12-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-46: Memo, Forrestal for Marx Leva, 30 Apr\r\n                   48; Ltr, Nelson to Leva, 24 May 48; Memo, Leva for\r\n                   SA, 25 May 48.

Of course, even in the Army the number of segregated\r\njobs that could be created was limited, and in time Forrestal's\r\ntactics might, it could be argued, have succeeded despite the Army's\r\nsize and the intractability of its leaders. Time, however, was\r\nprecisely what Forrestal lacked, given the increasing political\r\nstrength of the civil rights movement.\r\n\r\nSparked by Randolph's stand before the congressional committee, some\r\nmembers of the black community geared up for greater protests. Worse\r\nstill for an administration facing a critical election, the protest\r\nwas finding some support in the camps of the President's rivals. Early\r\nin May, for example, a group of prominent civil rights activists\r\nformed the Commission of Inquiry with the expressed purpose of\r\nexamining the treatment of black servicemen during World War II.\r\nOrganized by Randolph and Reynolds, the commission boasted Arthur\r\nGarfield Hayes, noted civil libertarian and lawyer, as its counsel.\r\nThe commission planned to interrogate witnesses and, on the basis of\r\nthe testimony gathered, issue a report to Congress and the public that\r\nwould include recommendations on conscription legislation. Various\r\nDefense Department officials were invited to testify but only James C.\r\nEvans, who acted as department spokesman, accepted. During the     (p. 307)\r\ninquiry, which Evans estimated was attended by 180 persons, little\r\nattention was given to Randolph's civil disobedience pledge, but Evans\r\nhimself came in for considerable ridicule, and there were headlines\r\naplenty in the black press.[12-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-47: Ltr, Grant Reynolds and Randolph to\r\n                   Evans, 3 May 48; Memo, Evans for SecDef, 13 May 48,\r\n                   sub: Commission of Inquiry; both in SecDef files.\r\n                   See also A. Philip Randolph, Statement Before\r\n                   Commission of Inquiry, 8 May 48, copy in USAF\r\n                   Special Files 35, 1948, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThese attacks were being carried out in an atmosphere of heightened\r\npolitical interest in the civil rights of black servicemen. Henry A.\r\nWallace, the Progressive Party's presidential candidate, had for some\r\ntime been telling his black audiences that the administration was\r\ninsincere because if it wanted to end segregation it could simply\r\nforce the resignation of the Secretary of the Army.[12-48] Henry Cabot\r\nLodge, the Republican senator from Massachusetts, called on Forrestal\r\nto make \"a real attempt, well thought out and well organized,\" to\r\nintegrate a sizable part of the armed forces with soldiers\r\nvolunteering for such arrangements. Quoting from General Eisenhower's\r\ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee, he reminded Forrestal\r\nthat segregation was not only an undeserved and unjustified\r\nhumiliation to the Negro, but a potential danger to the national\r\ndefense effort. In the face of a manpower shortage, it was inexcusable\r\nto view segregation simply as a political question, \"of concern to a\r\nfew individuals and to a few men in public life and to be dealt with\r\nas adroitly as possible, always with an eye to the largest number of\r\nvotes.\"[12-49]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-48: New York _Times_, February 16, 1948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-49: Ltr, Sen. Henry C. Lodge, Jr.\r\n                   (Mass.), to SecDef, 19 Apr 48, D54-1-3, SecDef\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nYet as the timing of Senator Lodge's letter suggests, the political\r\nimplications of the segregation fight were a prime concern of every\r\npolitician involved, and Forrestal had to act with this fact in mind.\r\nThe administration considered the Wallace campaign a real but minor\r\nthreat because of his appeal to black voters in the early months of\r\nthe campaign.[12-50] The Republican incursion into the civil rights field\r\nwas more ominous, and Forrestal, having acknowledged Lodge's letter,\r\nturned to Lester Granger for help in drafting a detailed reply. It\r\ntook Granger some time to suggest an approach because he agreed with\r\nLodge on many points but found some of his inferences as unsound as\r\nthe Army's policy. For instance Lodge approved Eisenhower's comments\r\non segregation, and the only real difference between Eisenhower and\r\nthe Army staff was that Eisenhower wanted segregation made more\r\nefficient by putting smaller all-black units into racially composite\r\norganizations. Negroes opposed segregation as an insult to their race\r\nand to their manhood. Granger wanted Forrestal to tell Lodge that no\r\ngroup of Negroes mindful of its public standing could take a position\r\nother than total opposition to segregation. Having to choose between\r\nRandolph's stand and Eisenhower's, Negroes could not endorse\r\nEisenhower. Granger also thought Forrestal would do well to explain to\r\nLodge that he himself favored for the other services the policy\r\nfollowed by the Navy in the name of improving efficiency and\r\nmorale.[12-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-50: McCoy and Ruetten, _Quest and\r\n                   Response_, pp. 98-99.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-51: Ltr, Granger to Leva, 14 May 48,\r\n                   D54-1-3, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nA reply along these line was prepared, but Marx Leva persuaded     (p. 308)\r\nForrestal not to send it until the selective service bill had safely\r\npassed Congress.[12-52] Forrestal was \"seriously concerned,\" he wrote\r\nthe President on 28 May 1948, about the fate of that legislation. He\r\nwanted to express his opposition to an amendment proposed by Senator\r\nRichard B. Russell of Georgia that would guarantee segregated units\r\nfor those draftees who wished to serve only with members of their own\r\nrace. He also wanted to announce his intention of making \"further\r\nprogress\" in interracial relations. To that end he had discussed with\r\nSpecial Counsel to the President Clark M. Clifford the creation of an\r\nadvisory board to recommend specific steps his department could take\r\nin the race relations field. Reiterating a long-cherished belief,\r\nForrestal declared that this \"difficult problem\" could not be solved\r\nby issuing an executive order or passing a law, \"for progress in this\r\nfield must be achieved by education, and not by mandate.\"[12-53] The\r\nPresident agreed to these maneuvers,[12-54] but just three days later\r\nForrestal returned to the subject, passing along to Truman a warning\r\nfrom Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio that both the Russell amendment\r\nand one proposed by Senator William Langer of North Dakota to prohibit\r\nall segregation were potential roadblocks to passage of the\r\nbill.[12-55] In the end Congress rejected both amendments, passing a\r\ndraft bill without any special racial provisions on 19 June 1948.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-52: Memo, Leva to Forrestal, 18 May 48,\r\n                   D54-1-3, SecDef files. Forrestal's response,\r\n                   suggesting that Lodge meet with Lester Granger to\r\n                   discuss the matter, was finally sent on 24 Jun 48.\r\n                   See also Memo, Leva for Forrestal, 22 Jun 48, and\r\n                   Ltr, SecDef to Sen.

In the next few weeks the whole problem would be taken out\r\nof his hands by a White House grown impatient with his methods. There,\r\nin contrast to the comparatively weak position of the Secretary of\r\nDefense, who had not yet consolidated his authority, the full force\r\nand power of the Commander in Chief would be used to give a dramatic\r\nnew meaning to equal treatment and opportunity in the armed forces.\r\nGiven the temper of the times, Forrestal's surrender was inevitable,\r\nfor a successful reform program had to show measurable improvements,\r\nand despite his maneuvers with the civil rights activists, the\r\nCongress, and the services, Forrestal had no success worth proclaiming\r\nin his first eight months of office.\r\n\r\nThis lack of progress disappointed civil rights leaders, who had\r\nperhaps overestimated the racial reforms made when Forrestal was\r\nSecretary of the Navy. It can be argued that as Secretary of Defense\r\nForrestal himself was inclined to overestimate them. Nevertheless, he\r\ncould demonstrate some systematic improvement in the lot of the black\r\nsailor, enough improvement, according to his gradualist philosophy, to\r\nassure continued progress. Ironically, considering Forrestal's faith\r\nin the efficacy of education and persuasion, whatever can be counted\r\nas his success in the Navy was accomplished by the firm authority he\r\nand his immediate subordinates exercised during the last months of (p. 309)\r\nthe war. Yet this authority was precisely what he lacked in his new\r\noffice, where his power was limited to only a general control over\r\nintransigent services that still insisted on their traditional\r\nautonomy.\r\n\r\nIn any case, by 1948 there was no hope for widespread reform through a\r\nstep-by-step demonstration of the practicality and reasonableness of\r\nintegration. Too much of the remaining opposition was emotional,\r\nrooted in prejudice and tradition, to yield to any but forceful\r\nmethods. If the services were to be integrated in the short run,\r\nintegration would have to be forced upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Executive Order 9981_\r\n\r\nAlthough politics was only one of several factors that led to\r\nExecutive Order 9981, the order was born during a presidential\r\nelection campaign, and its content and timing reflect that fact.\r\nHaving made what could be justified as a military decision in the\r\ninterest of a more effective use of manpower in the armed forces, the\r\nPresident and his advisers sought to capitalize on the political\r\nbenefits that might accrue from it.[12-56] The work of the President's\r\nCommittee on Civil Rights and Truman's subsequent message to Congress\r\nhad already elevated civil rights to the level of a major campaign\r\nissue. As early as November 1947 Clark Clifford, predicting the\r\nnomination of Thomas Dewey and Henry Wallace, had advised the\r\nPresident to concentrate on winning the allegiance of the nation's\r\nminority voters, especially the black, labor, and Jewish blocs.[12-57]\r\nClifford had discounted the threat of a southern defection, but in the\r\nspring of 1948 southern Democrats began to turn from the party, and\r\nthe black vote, an important element in the big city Democratic vote\r\nsince the formation of the Roosevelt coalition, now became in the\r\nminds of the campaign planners an essential ingredient in a Truman\r\nvictory. Through the efforts of Oscar Ewing, head of the Federal\r\nSecurity Administration and White House adviser on civil rights\r\nmatters, and several other politicians, Harry Truman was cast in the\r\nrole of minority rights champion.[12-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-56: Interv, Nichols with Ewing; Interv,\r\n                   Blumenson with Leva.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-57: Memo, Clark Clifford for President,\r\n                   19 Nov 47; ibid., 17 Aug 48, sub: The 1948\r\n                   Campaign; both in Truman Library.

VI.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-58: Interv, Nichols with Ewing.]\r\n\r\nTheirs was not a difficult task, for the President's identification\r\nwith the civil rights movement had become part of the cause of his\r\nunpopularity in some Democratic circles and a threat to his\r\nrenomination. He overcame the attempt to deny him the presidential\r\nnomination in June, and he accepted the strong civil rights platform\r\nthat emerged from the convention. The resolution committee of that\r\nconvention had proposed a mild civil rights plank in the hope of\r\npreventing the defection of southern delegates, but in a dramatic\r\nfloor fight Hubert H. Humphrey, the mayor of Minneapolis and a\r\ncandidate for the U.S. Senate, forced through one of the strongest\r\ncivil rights statements in the history of the party. This plank\r\nendorsed Truman's congressional message on civil rights and called (p. 310)\r\nfor \"Congress to support our President in guaranteeing these basic and\r\nfundamental rights ... the right of equal treatment in the service and\r\ndefense of our nation.\"[12-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-59: Quoted in Memo, Leva for SecDef, 15\r\n                   Jul 48, D54-1-3, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nTruman admitted to Forrestal that \"he had not himself wanted to go as\r\nfar as the Democratic platform went on the civil rights issue.\" The\r\nPresident had no animus toward those who voted against the platform;\r\nhe would have done the same if he had come from their states. But he\r\nwas determined to run on the platform, and for him, he later said, a\r\nplatform was not a window dressing. His southern colleagues understood\r\nhim. When a reporter pointed out to Governor Strom Thurmond of South\r\nCarolina that the President had only accepted a platform similar to\r\nthose supported by Roosevelt, the governor answered, \"I agree, but\r\nTruman really means it.\"[12-60] After the platform fight the Alabama and\r\nMississippi delegates walked out of the convention. The Dixiecrat\r\nrevolt was on in earnest.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-60: Quoted in Truman, _Memoirs_, II:183;\r\n                   see also Interv, Nichols with Truman, and Millis,\r\n                   _Forrestal Diaries_, p. 458.]\r\n\r\nBoth the Democratic platform and the report of the President's Civil\r\nRights Committee referred to discrimination in the federal government,\r\na matter obviously susceptible to presidential action. For once the\r\n\"do-nothing\" Congress could not be blamed, and if Truman failed to act\r\npromptly he would only invite the wrath of the civil rights forces he\r\nwas trying to court. Aware of this political necessity, the\r\nPresident's advisers had been studying the areas in which the\r\nPresident alone might act in forbidding discrimination as well as the\r\nmechanics by which he might make his actions effective. According to\r\nOscar Ewing, the advisers had decided as early as October 1947 that\r\nthe best way to handle discrimination in the federal government was to\r\nissue a presidential order securing the civil rights of both civilian\r\ngovernment employees and members of the armed forces. In the end the\r\nPresident decided to issue two executive orders.[12-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-61: Interv, Nichols with Ewing.]\r\n\r\nClifford, Ewing, and Philleo Nash, who was a presidential specialist\r\non minority matters, worked on drafting both orders. After consulting\r\nwith Truman Gibson, Nash proposed that the order directed to the\r\nservices should create a committee within the military establishment\r\nto push for integration, one similar to the McCloy committee in World\r\nWar II. Like Gibson, Nash was convinced that change in the armed\r\nforces racial policy would come only through a series of steps\r\ninitiated in each service. By such steps progress had been made in the\r\nNavy through its Special Programs Unit and in the Army through the\r\nefforts of the McCloy committee. Nash argued against the publication\r\nof an executive order that spelled out integration or condemned\r\nsegregation. Rather, let the order to the services call for equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity--the language of the Democratic platform.\r\nTie it to military efficiency, letting the services discover, under\r\nguidance from a White House committee, the inefficiency of segregation.\r\nThe services would quickly conclude, the advisers assumed, that equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity were impossible in a segregated          (p. 311)\r\nsystem.[12-62] After a series of discussions with the President, Nash,\r\nClifford, and Ewing drew up a version of the order to the services\r\nalong the lines suggested by Nash.[12-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-62: Memo, Niles for Clifford, 12 May 48;\r\n                   Memo, Clifford for SecDef, 13 May 48, Nash\r\n                   Collection, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-63: Interv, Nichols with Ewing.]\r\n\r\nThe draft underwent one significant revision at the request of the\r\nSecretary of Defense. In keeping with his theory that the services\r\nshould be given the chance to work out their own methods of compliance\r\nwith the order to integrate, Forrestal wanted no deadlines set. To\r\nkeep antagonisms to a minimum he wanted the order to call simply for\r\nprogress \"as rapidly as feasible.\" The President agreed.[12-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-64: Nichols, _Breakthrough on the Color\r\n                   Front_, p. 86.]\r\n\r\nThe timing of the order was politically important to Truman, and by\r\nlate July the White House was extremely anxious to publish the\r\ndocument. The President now had his all-important selective service\r\nlegislation; he was beginning to campaign on a platform calling for a\r\nspecial session of Congress--a Congress dominated by Republicans, who\r\nhad also just approved a party platform calling for an end to\r\nsegregation in the armed forces. Haste was evident in the fact that\r\nthe order, along with copies for the service secretaries, was sent to\r\nthe Secretary of Defense on the morning of 26 July--the day it was\r\nissued--for comment and review by that afternoon.[12-65] The order was\r\nalso submitted to Walter White and A. Philip Randolph before it was\r\nissued.[12-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-65: Ltr, Donald S. Dawson, Admin Asst to\r\n                   the President, to SecDef, 26 Jul 48. The executive\r\n                   order on equal opportunity for federal employees\r\n                   was also issued on 26 July.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-66: Columbia University Oral Hist Interv\r\n                   with Wilkins.]\r\n\r\nActually, the order had been read to Forrestal on the evening of the\r\nprevious day, and his office had suggested one more change. Marx Leva\r\nbelieved that the order would be improved if it mentioned the fact\r\nthat substantial progress in civil rights had been made during the war\r\nand in the years thereafter. Since a sentence to this effect had been\r\nincluded in Truman's civil rights message of February, Leva thought it\r\nwould be well to include it in the executive order. Believing also\r\nthat policy changes ought to be the work of the government or of the\r\nexecutive branch of the government rather than of the President alone,\r\nhe offered a sentence for inclusion: \"To the extent that this policy\r\nhas not yet been completely implemented, such alterations or\r\nimprovements in existing rules, procedures and practices as may be\r\nnecessary shall be put into effect as rapidly as possible.\" Although\r\nForrestal approved the sentence, it was not accepted by the\r\nPresident.[12-67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-67: Memo, Leva for Forrestal, 26 Jul 48,\r\n                   SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nApprovals were quickly gathered from interested cabinet officials. The\r\nAttorney General passed on the form and legality of the order.\r\nForrestal was certain that Stuart Symington of the Air Force and John\r\nL. Sullivan, Secretary of the Navy, would approve the order, but he\r\nsuggested that Oscar Ewing discuss the draft with Kenneth Royall.\r\nAccording to Ewing, the Secretary of the Army read the order twice (p. 312)\r\nand said, \"tell the President that I not only have no objections but\r\nwholeheartedly approve, and we'll go along with it.\"[12-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-68: Interv, Nichols with Ewing: Ltr, Atty\r\n                   Gen to President, 26 Jul 48, 1285-0, copy in\r\n                   Eisenhower Library.]\r\n\r\nThe historic document, signed by Truman on 26 July 1948, read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     EXECUTIVE ORDER 9981\r\n\r\n     Whereas it is essential that there be maintained in the armed\r\n     services of the United States the highest standards of democracy,\r\n     with equality of treatment and opportunity for all those who\r\n     serve in our country's defense:\r\n\r\n     Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me as\r\n     President of the United States, and as Commander in Chief of the\r\n     armed services, it is hereby ordered as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that\r\n     there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all\r\n     persons in the armed services without regard to race, color,\r\n     religion or national origin. This policy shall be put into effect\r\n     as rapidly as possible, having due regard to the time required to\r\n     effectuate any necessary changes without impairing efficiency or\r\n     morale.\r\n\r\n     2. There shall be created in the National Military Establishment\r\n     an advisory committee to be known as the President's Committee on\r\n     Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services,\r\n     which shall be composed of seven members to be designated by the\r\n     President.\r\n\r\n     3. The Committee is authorized on behalf of the President to\r\n     examine into the rules, procedures and practices of the armed\r\n     services in order to determine in what respect such rules,\r\n     procedures and practices may be altered or improved with a view\r\n     to carrying out the policy of this order. The Committee shall\r\n     confer and advise with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of\r\n     the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air\r\n     Force, and shall make such recommendations to the President and\r\n     to said Secretaries as in the judgment of the Committee will\r\n     effectuate the policy hereof.\r\n\r\n     4. All executive departments and agencies of the Federal\r\n     Government are authorized and directed to cooperate with the\r\n     Committee in its work, and to furnish the Committee such\r\n     information or the services of such persons as the Committee may\r\n     require in the performance of its duties.\r\n\r\n     5. When requested by the Committee to do so, persons in the armed\r\n     services or in any of the executive departments and agencies of\r\n     the Federal Government shall testify before the Committee and\r\n     shall make available for the use of the Committee such documents\r\n     and other information as the Committee may require.\r\n\r\n     6. The Committee shall continue to exist until such time as the\r\n     President shall terminate its existence by Executive Order.\r\n\r\n     The White House                    HARRY S. TRUMAN\r\n     July 26, 1948\r\n\r\nAs indicated by the endorsement of such diverse protagonists as Royall\r\nand Randolph, the wording of the executive order was in part both\r\nvague and misleading. The vagueness was there by design. The failure\r\nto mention either segregation or integration puzzled many people and\r\nangered others, but it was certainly to the advantage of a president\r\nwho wanted to give the least offense possible to voters who supported\r\nsegregation. In fact integration was not the precise word to describe\r\nthe complex social change in the armed forces demanded by civil rights\r\nleaders, and the emphasis on equality of treatment and opportunity with\r\nits portent for the next generation was particularly appropriate.\r\nTruman, however, was not allowed to remain vague for long.         (p. 313)\r\nQuestioned at his first press conference after the order was issued, the\r\nPresident refused to set a time limit, but he admitted that he expected\r\nthe order to abolish racial segregation in the armed forces.[12-69]\r\nThe order was also misleading when it created the advisory committee\r\n\"in\" the National Military Establishment. Truman apparently intended\r\nto create a presidential committee to oversee the manpower policies of\r\nall the services, and despite the wording of the order the committee\r\nwould operate as a creature of the White House, reporting to the\r\nPresident rather than to the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-69: Presidential News Conference, 29 Jul\r\n                   48, _Public Papers of the President_, 1948, p.\r\n                   422.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the new policy would depend to a great extent, as\r\nfriends and foes of integration alike recognized, on the ability and\r\ninclination of this committee. The final choice of members was the\r\nPresident's, but he conspicuously involved the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Army. He\r\nrepeatedly solicited Forrestal's suggestions, and it was apparent that\r\nthe views of the Pentagon would carry much weight in the final\r\nselection. Just four days after the publication of Executive Order\r\n9981, the President's administrative assistant, Donald S. Dawson,\r\nwrote Forrestal that he would be glad to talk to him about the seven\r\nmembers.[12-70] Before Forrestal replied he had Leva discuss possible\r\nnominees with the three military departments and obtain their\r\nrecommendations. The Pentagon's list went to the White House on 3\r\nAugust. A list compiled subsequently by Truman's advisers, chiefly\r\nPhilleo Nash and Oscar Ewing, and approved by the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, duplicated a number of Forrestal's suggestions; its\r\nadditions and deletions revealed the practical political\r\nconsiderations under which the White House had to operate.[12-71]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-70: Ltr, Dawson to Forrestal, 30 Jul 48,\r\n                   SecDef files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-71: Memos, Leva for Forrestal, 3 and 12\r\n                   Aug 48; Ltr, Forrestal to President, 3 Aug 48,\r\n                   D54-1-3, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nBy mid-September the committee was still unformed. The White House had\r\nbeen unable to get either Frank Graham, president of the University of\r\nNorth Carolina, a member of the President's Committee on Civil Rights,\r\nand the first choice of both the White House and the Pentagon for\r\nchairman, or Charles E. Wilson, second choice, to accept the\r\nchairmanship. Secretary of the Army Royall was particularly incensed\r\nthat some of the men being considered for the committee \"have publicly\r\nexpressed their opinion in favor of abolishing segregation in the\r\nArmed Services. At least one of them, Lester Grainger [_sic_], has\r\nbeen critical both of the Army and of me personally on this particular\r\nmatter.\"[12-72] Royall wanted no one asked to serve on the President's\r\ncommittee who had fixed opinions on segregation, and certainly no one\r\nwho had made a public pronouncement on the subject. He wanted the\r\nnominees questioned to make sure they could give \"fair consideration\"\r\nto the subject.[12-73] Royall favored Jonathan Daniels, Ralph McGill of\r\nthe Atlanta _Constitution_, Colgate Darden, president of the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, and Douglas Southall Freeman, distinguished\r\nRichmond historian.[12-74] Names continued to be bruited about.    (p. 314)\r\nDawson asked Forrestal if he had any preferences for Reginald E.\r\nGillmor, president of Sperry Gyroscope, or Julius Ochs Adler, noted\r\npublisher and former military aide to Secretary Stimson, as\r\npossibilities for chairman. Forrestal inclined toward Adler; \"I\r\nbelieve he would be excellent although as a Southerner he might have\r\nlimiting views.\"[12-75]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-72: Ltr, Royall to President, 17 Sep 48,\r\n                   OSA 291.2 (17 Sep 48).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-73: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-74: Memo, Royall for Forrestal, 10 Sep\r\n                   48, OSA 291.2 (10 Sep 48).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-75: Memo, Leva for Forrestal, 1 Sep 48,\r\n                   and Handwritten Note by Forrestal, D54-1-3, SecDef\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nWith the election imminent, the need for an announcement on the\r\nmembership of the committee became pressing. On 16 September Dawson\r\ntold Leva that a chairman and five of the six members had been\r\nselected and had agreed to serve: Charles Fahy, chairman, Charles\r\nLuckman, Lester Granger, John H. Sengstacke, Jacob Billikopf, and\r\nAlphonsus J. Donahue. The sixth member, still uninvited, was to be\r\nDwight Palmer. Dawson said he would wait on this appointment until\r\nForrestal had time to consider it, but two days later he was back,\r\ntelling the secretary that the President had instructed him to release\r\nthe names. There was final change: William E. Stevenson's name was\r\nsubstituted for Billikopf's.[12-76]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-76: Memo, Leva for Forrestal, 18 Sep 48,\r\n                   D54-1-3, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nAlthough only two of Forrestal's nominees, Lester Granger and John\r\nSengstacke, survived the selection process, the final membership was\r\ncertainly acceptable to the Secretary of Defense. Charles Fahy was\r\nsuggested by presidential assistant David K. Niles, who described the\r\nsoft-voiced Georgian as a \"reconstructed southerner liberal on race.\"\r\nA lawyer and former Solicitor General, Fahy had a reputation for\r\nsensitive handling of delicate problems, \"with quiet authority and the\r\npunch of a mule.\" Granger's appointment was a White House bow to\r\nForrestal and a disregard for Royall's objections. Sengstacke, a noted\r\nblack publisher suggested by Forrestal and Ewing and supported by\r\nWilliam L. Dawson, the black congressman from Chicago, was appointed\r\nin deference to the black press. Moreover, he had supported Truman's\r\nreelection \"in unqualified terms.\" William Stevenson was the president\r\nof Oberlin College and was strongly recommended by Lloyd K. Garrison,\r\npresident of the National Urban League. Finally, there was a trio of\r\nbusinessmen on the committee: Donahue was a Connecticut industrialist,\r\nhighly recommended by Senator Howard J. McGrath of Rhode Island and\r\nBrian McMahon of Connecticut; Luckman was president of Lever Brothers\r\nand a native of Kansas City, Missouri; and Dwight Palmer was president\r\nof the General Cable Corporation.[12-77]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 12-77: Interv, Nichols with Ewing; Interv,\r\n                   Blumenson with Leva. Donahue resigned for health\r\n                   reasons shortly after the committee began its work;\r\n                   see Ltr, Donahue to Truman, 23 May 49, Truman\r\n                   Library. Luckman did not participate at all in the\r\n                   committee's work or sign its report. The\r\n                   committee's active members, in addition to its\r\n                   chairman, were Granger, Sengstacke, Palmer, and\r\n                   Stevenson.]\r\n\r\nThese were the men with whom, for a time at least, the Secretary of\r\nDefense would share his direction over the racial policies of the\r\narmed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13                                                         (p. 315)\r\n\r\nService Interests Versus Presidential Intent\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral months elapsed between the appointment of the President's\r\nCommittee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\nServices and its first meeting, a formal session with the President at\r\nthe White House on 12 January 1949. Actually, certain advantages\r\naccrued from the delay, for postponing the meetings until after the\r\nPresident's reelection enabled the committee to face the services with\r\nassurance of continued support from the administration. Renewed\r\npresidential backing was probably necessary, considering the services'\r\ndeliberations on race policy during this half-year hiatus. Their\r\nreactions to the order, logical outgrowths of postwar policies and\r\npractices, demonstrated how their perceived self-interests might\r\nsubvert the President's intentions. The events of this six-month\r\nperiod also began to show the relative importance of the order and the\r\nparochial interests of the services as factors in the integration of\r\nthe armed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Public Reaction to Executive Order 9981_\r\n\r\nConsidering the substantial changes it promised, the President's order\r\nprovoked surprisingly little public opposition. Its publication\r\ncoincided with the convening of the special session of a Congress\r\nsmarting under Truman's \"do-nothing\" label. In this charged political\r\natmosphere, the anti-administration majority in Congress quietly\r\nsidestepped the President's 27 July call for civil rights legislation.\r\nTo do otherwise would only have added to the political profits already\r\ngarnered by Truman in some important voting areas. For the same reason\r\ncongressional opponents avoided all mention of Executive Order 9981,\r\nalthough the widely expected defeat of Truman and the consequent end\r\nto this executive sally into civil rights might have contributed to\r\nthe silence. Besides, segregationists could do little in an immediate\r\nlegislative way to counteract the presidential command. Congress had\r\nalready passed the Selective Service Act and Defense Appropriations\r\nAct, the most suitable vehicles for amendments aimed at modifying the\r\nimpact of the integration order. National elections and the advent of\r\na new Congress precluded any other significant moves in this direction\r\nuntil later in the next year.\r\n\r\nYet if it was ignored in Congress, the order was nevertheless a clear\r\nsignal to the friends of integration and brought with it a tremendous\r\nsurge of hope to the black community. Publishing the order made Harry\r\nTruman the \"darling of the Negroes,\" Roy Wilkins said later. Nor did\r\nthe coincidence of its publication to the election, he added, bother a\r\ngroup that was becoming increasingly pragmatic about the reasons   (p. 316)\r\nfor social reform.[13-1] Both the declaredly Democratic Chicago\r\n_Defender_ and Republican-oriented Pittsburgh _Courier_ were aware of\r\nthe implications of the order. The _Defender_ ran an editorial on 7\r\nAugust under the heading \"Mr. Truman Makes History.\" The \"National\r\nGrapevine\" column of Charlie Cherokee in the same issue promised its\r\nreaders a blow-by-blow description of the events surrounding the\r\nPresident's action. An interview in the same issue with Col. Richard\r\nL. Jones, black commander of the 178th Regimental Combat Team\r\n(Illinois), emphasized the beneficial effects of the proposed\r\nintegration, and in the next issue, 14 August, the editor broadened\r\nthe discussion with an editorial entitled \"What About Prejudice?\"[13-2]\r\nThe _Courier_, for its part, questioned the President's sincerity\r\nbecause he had not explicitly called for an end to segregation. At the\r\nsame time it contrasted the futility of civil disobedience with the\r\nefficiency of such an order on the services, and while maintaining its\r\nsupport for the candidacy of Governor Dewey the paper revealed a\r\nstrong enthusiasm for President Truman's civil rights program.[13-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-1: Columbia University Oral Hist Interv\r\n                   with Wilkins.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-2: Chicago _Defender_, August 7 and\r\n                   August 14, 1948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-3: Pittsburgh _Courier_, August 7, August\r\n                   28, and September 25, 1948.]\r\n\r\nThese affirmations of support for Executive Order 9981 in the major\r\nblack newspapers fitted in neatly with the administration's political\r\nstrategy. Nor was the Democratic National Committee averse to using\r\nthe order to win black votes. For example it ran a half-page\r\nadvertisement in the _Defender_ under the heading \"By His Deeds Shall\r\nYe Know Him.\"[13-4] At the same time, not wishing to antagonize the\r\nopponents of integration further, the administration made no special\r\neffort to publicize the order in the metropolitan press. Consequently,\r\nwhen the order was mentioned at all, it was usually carried without\r\ncomment, and the few columnists who treated the subject did so with\r\nsome caution. Arthur Krock's \"Reform Attempts Aid Southern Extremists\"\r\nin the New York _Times_, for example, lauded the President's civil\r\nrights initiatives but warned that any attempt to force social\r\nintegration would only strengthen demagogues at the expense of\r\nmoderate politicians.[13-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-4: Chicago _Defender_, August 21, 1948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-5: New York _Times_, September 12, 1948.]\r\n\r\nIf the President's wooing of the black voter was good election\r\npolitics, his executive order was also a successful practical response\r\nto the threat of civil disobedience and the failure of the Secretary\r\nof Defense to strive actively for racial equality throughout the\r\nservices. Declaring the President's action a substantial gain, A.\r\nPhilip Randolph canceled the call for a boycott of the draft, leaving\r\nonly a small number of diehards to continue the now insignificant\r\neffort. The black leaders who had participated in Secretary\r\nForrestal's National Defense Conference gave the President their full\r\nsupport, and Donald S. Dawson, administrative assistant to the\r\nPresident, was able to assure Truman that the black press, now\r\ncompletely behind the committee on equal treatment and opportunity,\r\nhad abandoned its vigorous campaign against the Army's racial\r\npolicy.[13-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-6: Memo, Donald Dawson for President, 9\r\n                   Sep 48, Nash Collection, Truman Library; Memo,\r\n                   SecDef for [Clark] Clifford, 2 Aug 48, and Ltr,\r\n                   Bayard Rustin of the Campaign to Resist Military\r\n                   Segregation to James V.

It should be noted that\r\n                   Dawson's claim that the black press universally\r\n                   supported the executive order has not been accepted\r\n                   by all commentators; see McCoy and Ruetten, _Quest\r\n                   and Response_, p. 130.]\r\n\r\nIronically, the most celebrated pronouncement on segregation at    (p. 317)\r\nthe moment of the Truman order came not from publicists or politicians\r\nbut from the Army's new Chief of Staff, General Omar N. Bradley.[13-7]\r\nSpeaking to a group of instructors at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and unaware\r\nof the President's order and the presence of the press, Bradley\r\ndeclared that the Army would have to retain segregation as long as it\r\nwas the national pattern.[13-8] This statement prompted questions at\r\nthe President's next news conference, letters to the editor, and\r\ndebate in the press.[13-9] Bradley later explained that he had\r\nsupported the Army's segregation policy because he was against making\r\nthe Army an instrument of social change in areas of the country which\r\nstill rejected integration.[13-10] His comment, as amplified and\r\nbroadcast by military analyst Hanson W. Baldwin, summarized the Army's\r\nposition at the time of the Truman order. \"It is extremely dangerous\r\nnonsense,\" Baldwin declared, \"to try to make the Army other than one\r\nthing--a fighting machine.\" By emphasizing that the Army could not\r\nafford to differ greatly in customs, traditions, and prejudices from\r\nthe general population, Baldwin explained, Bradley was only\r\nunderscoring a major characteristic of any large organization of\r\nconscripts. Most import, Baldwin pointed out, the Chief of Staff\r\nconsidered an inflexible order for the immediate integration of all\r\ntroops one of the surest ways to break down the morale of the Army and\r\ndestroy its efficiency.[13-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-7: Bradley succeeded Eisenhower as Chief\r\n                   of Staff on 7 February 1948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-8: Washington _Post_, July 28, 1948;\r\n                   Atlanta _Constitution_, July 28, 1948.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-9: News Conference, 29 Jul 48, _Public\r\n                   Papers of the Presidents: Harry S.

General Bradley's statement, subsequent\r\n     to the President's orders, would seem to indicate that the\r\n     President either did not mean what he said or his orders were not\r\n     being obeyed. We should like to point out that General Bradley's\r\n     reported observation ... was decidedly wide of the mark.\r\n     Segregation is the legal pattern of only a few of our most\r\n     backward states.... In view of the trends in law and social\r\n     practice, it is high time that the Defense forces were not used\r\n     as brakes on progress toward genuine democracy.[13-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-12: Ltr, A.

Some of the President's most        (p. 318)\r\noutspoken supporters would not let him forget his integration order,\r\nand the Army, as represented by its Chief of Staff, failed to realize\r\nthat events were rapidly moving beyond the point where segregation\r\ncould be considered a workable policy for an agency of the United\r\nStates government.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-13: Ltrs, Bradley to President Truman, 30\r\n                   Jul 48, and Truman to Bradley, 4 Aug 48, CSUSA\r\n                   291.2 (4 Aug 48).

As further evidence of the powerful pressures for change,\r\nseveral state governors now challenged segregation in the National\r\nGuard. Generally the race policy of the reserve components echoed that\r\nof the Regular Army, in part because it seemed logical that state\r\nunits, subject to federal service, conform to federal standards of\r\nperformance and organization. Accordingly, in the wake of the\r\npublication of the Gillem Board Report, the Army's Director of\r\nPersonnel and Administration recommended to the Committee on National\r\nGuard Policy[13-14] that it amend its regulation on the employment of\r\nblack troops to conform more closely with the new policy.\r\nSpecifically, General Paul asked the committee to spell out the\r\nprohibition against integration of white and black troops below\r\nbattalion level, warning that federal recognition would be denied any\r\nstate unit organized in violation of this order.[13-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-14: As provided in various laws since\r\n                   1920, most notably in Section V of the amendments\r\n                   to the National Defense Act, members of the General\r\n                   Staff's Committee on National Guard Policy and\r\n                   Committee on Reserve Policy were the principal\r\n                   advisers to the Secretary of War on reserve\r\n                   component matters. All questions regarding these\r\n                   organizations were referred to the committees,\r\n                   which usually met in combined session as the\r\n                   Committee on National Guard and Reserve Policy. The\r\n                   combined committee was composed of twenty-one\r\n                   officers, seven each from the Regular Army, the\r\n                   guard, and the reserves. When the business under\r\n                   consideration was restricted exclusively to one of\r\n                   the reserve components, the representatives of the\r\n                   other would absent themselves, the remaining\r\n                   members, along with the Regular Army members,\r\n                   reconstituting themselves as the Committee on\r\n                   National Guard Policy or the Committee on Reserve\r\n                   Policy. These groups, familiarly known as the\r\n                   \"Section V Committees,\" wielded considerable power\r\n                   in the development of the postwar program for the\r\n                   reserves.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-15: Memo, Chief, Classification and\r\n                   Personnel Actions Br, P&A, for Brig Gen Ira Swift,\r\n                   Chief, Liaison, Planning and Policy Coordination\r\n                   Gp, P&A, 8 Apr 47, sub: Resolution Regarding\r\n                   Employment of Negro Troops in the National Guard;\r\n                   Memo, Dir, P&A, for Dir, Intel, 9 Apr 47, same sub;\r\n                   both in WDGPA 291.2 (3 Apr 47).]\r\n\r\nAgreeing to comply with General Paul's request, the National Guard\r\nCommittee went a step further and recommended that individual states\r\nbe permitted to make their own decisions on the wisdom and utility of\r\norganizing separate black units.[13-16] The Army staff rejected this\r\nproposal, however, on the grounds that it gave too much discretionary\r\npower to the state guard authorities.[13-17] Interestingly enough in view\r\nof later developments, neither the committee nor the staff disputed\r\nthe War Department's right to withhold federal recognition in racial\r\nmatters, and both displayed little concern for the principle of    (p. 319)\r\nstates' rights. Their attitude was important, for while the\r\nprohibition against integration sat well in some circles, it drew\r\nsevere criticism in others. Unlike the Regular Army, the National\r\nGuard and the Army Reserve were composed of units deeply rooted in the\r\nlocal community, each reflecting the parochial attitudes of its\r\nmembers and its section. This truth was forcefully pointed out to the\r\nArmy staff in 1946 when it tried to reactivate the 313th Infantry and\r\ndesignate it as a black unit in the 79th Division (Pennsylvania).\r\nFormer members of the old white 313th, now prominent citizens,\r\nexpressed their \"very strong sentiments\" on the matter, and the Army\r\nhad to beat a hasty retreat. In the future, the staff decided, either\r\nblack reserve units would be given the name and history of inactive\r\nblack units or new units would be constituted.[13-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-16: DF, WDGS Cmte on National Guard\r\n                   Policy, to Chief, NGB, 20 May 47, sub: Integration\r\n                   of Negro Troops; idem to Dir, P&A, and Dir, O&T,\r\n                   same date and sub.

As early as February 1947 Governor James L. McConnaughy\r\nhad publicly deplored segregation of Negroes in his own Connecticut\r\nNational Guard. Adopting the states' rights stance more commonly\r\nassociated with defenders of racial discrimination, Governor\r\nMcConnaughy argued that by requiring segregation the War Department\r\nran contrary to the wishes of individual states. Marcus Ray, the\r\nsecretary's adviser on race, predicted that integration in the reserve\r\ncomponents would continue to be a \"point of increasing pressure.\" As\r\nhe pointed out to Assistant Secretary Petersen, the Army had always\r\nsupported segregation in its southern installations on the grounds\r\nthat it had to conform with local mores. How then could it refuse to\r\nconform with the local statutes and customs of some northern states\r\nwithout appearing inconsistent? He recommended the Army amend its race\r\npolicy to permit reserve components in states which wished it to\r\nintegrate at a level consistent with \"local community attitudes.\"[13-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-19: Memo, Ray for Petersen, 2 Apr 47,\r\n                   sub: Integration of Negro Personnel in the Reserve\r\n                   Components, ASW 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Army staff would have nothing to do with Ray's suggestion.\r\nInstead, both the Director of Personnel and Administration and the\r\nDirector of Organization and Training supported a new resolution by\r\nthe National Guard Policy Committee that left the number of black\r\nunits and the question of their integration with white units above the\r\ncompany level up to the states involved. Integration at the company\r\nlevel was prohibited, and such integrated companies would be denied\r\nfederal recognition. The committee's resolution was adopted by the\r\nSecretary of War in May 1947.[13-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-20: Memo, D/O&T for ASW, 17 Apr 47, sub:\r\n                   Integration of Negro Personnel in the Reserve\r\n                   Components, WDGOT 291.2; Memo, D/P&A thru D/O&T for\r\n                   ASW, 10 Apr 47, same sub, WDGPA 291.2; DF, D/P&A to\r\n                   CofS, 20 May 47, sub: Integration of Negro Troops,\r\n                   CSUSA 291.2 Negroes.]\r\n\r\nBut the fight was not over yet. In 1947 New Jersey adopted a new\r\nconstitution that specifically prohibited segregation in the state\r\nmilitia. By extension no New Jersey National Guard unit could receive\r\nfederal recognition. In February 1948 Governor McConnaughy brought (p. 320)\r\nConnecticut back into the fray, this time taking the matter up with\r\nthe White House. A month later Governor Luther W. Youngdahl appealed\r\nto the Secretary of Defense on behalf of Negroes in the Minnesota\r\nNational Guard. Secretary of the Army Royall quickly reappraised the\r\nsituation and excepted New Jersey from the Army's segregation rule.\r\nSecretary Symington followed suit by excepting the New Jersey Air\r\nNational Guard.[13-21] Royall also let the governors of Connecticut\r\nand Minnesota know that he would be inclined to make similar\r\nconcessions to any state which, by legislative action, prohibited its\r\ngovernor from conforming to the federal requirements. At that time\r\nConnecticut and Minnesota had no such legislation, but Royall\r\nnevertheless agreed to refer their requests to his Committee on\r\nNational Guard Policy.[13-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-21: Ltr, Kenneth Royall to Alfred\r\n                   Driscoll, 7 Feb 48; Ltr, W.

Privately, Royall admitted that he did\r\nnot feel bound to accept a committee recommendation and would be\r\ninclined to recognize any state prohibition against segregation. But\r\nhe made a careful distinction between constitutional or legislative\r\naction and executive action in the states. A governor's decision to\r\nintegrate, he pointed out, would not be recognized by the Army because\r\nsuch an action was subject to speedy reversal by the governor's\r\nsuccessor and could cause serious confusion in the guard.[13-23]   (p. 321)\r\nThe majority of the National Guard Committee, supported by the\r\nDirector of Organization and Training, recommended that the secretary\r\nmake no exceptions to the segregation policy. The Director of\r\nPersonnel and Administration, on the other hand, joined with the\r\ncommittee's minority in recommending that Royall's action in the New\r\nJersey case be used as a precedent.[13-24] Commenting independently,\r\nGeneral Bradley warned Royall that integrating individual Negroes in\r\nthe National Guard would, from a military point of view, \"create\r\nproblems which may have serious consequences in case of national\r\nmobilization of those units.\"[13-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-23: Remarks by Kenneth Royall in the\r\n                   Committee of Four, 9 Mar 48, OSD Historical Office\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-24: P&A Summary Sheet, 7 Jul 48, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the National\r\n                   Guard, WDGPA 291.2; O&T Summary Sheet, 8 Apr 48,\r\n                   same sub.

While Secretary Royall, and\r\non occasion his superior, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, reiterated\r\nthe Army's willingness to accommodate certain states,[13-26] civil rights\r\ngroups were gaining allies for another proposition. The American\r\nVeterans Committee had advanced the idea that to forbid integration at\r\nthe platoon level was a retreat from World War II practice, and to\r\naccept the excuse that segregation was in the interest of national\r\ndefense was to tolerate a \"travesty on words.\"[13-27] Hearings were\r\nconducted in Congress in 1949 and 1951 on bills H.R. 1403 and H.R.\r\n1389 to prohibit segregation in the National Guard. Royall's\r\ninterpretation of the National Defense Act did not satisfy advocates\r\nof a thoroughly integrated guard, for it was clear that not many\r\nstates were likely to petition for permission to integrate. At the\r\nsame time the exceptions to the segregation rule promised an\r\nincompatible situation between the segregated active forces and the\r\nincompletely integrated reserve organization.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-26: See Ltrs, James Forrestal to A.

The price for defending the Army's\r\nsegregation policy, guard officials discovered, was the surrender of\r\ntheir long-cherished claim of state autonomy. The committee's\r\nrecommendation on the matter of applying the Gillem Board policy to\r\nthe guard was inflexible, leaving no room for separate decisions by\r\nofficials of the several states. Maj. Gen. Jim Dan Hill of the\r\nWisconsin National Guard recognized this danger. Along with a minority\r\nof his colleagues he maintained that the decision on segregation \"will\r\nhave to be solved at the state level.\"[13-28] The committee        (p. 322)\r\nmajority argued the contrary, agreeing with Brig. Gen. Alexander G.\r\nPaxton of Mississippi that the National Defense Act of 1945 prohibited\r\nthe sort of exception made in the New Jersey case. General Paxton\r\ncalled for a uniform policy for all guard units:\r\n\r\n     National Security is an obligation of all the states, and its\r\n     necessity in time of emergency transcends all local issues.\r\n     Federal recognition of the National Guard units of the several\r\n     States is extended for the purpose of affording these units a\r\n     Federal status under the National Defense Act. The issue in\r\n     question is purely one of compliance with Federal Law.[13-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-28: Ltr, Maj Gen Jim Dan Hill, Wisconsin\r\n                   National Guard, to Secy, WD Advisory Cmte, 24 Jun\r\n                   48; see also Ltr, Brig Gen Harry Evans, Maryland\r\n                   National Guard, to Col William Abendroth, Exec,\r\n                   Cmte on NG and Reserve Policy, 22 Jun 48, Office\r\n                   file, Army Reserve Forces Policy Cmte.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-29: Ltr, Brig Gen A.

In supporting the right of the Secretary of the Army to dictate\r\nracial policy to state guards in 1948, the National Guard Committee\r\nadopted a position that would haunt it when the question of\r\nintegrating the guard came up again in the early 1960's.\r\n\r\nDespite the publicity given to General Bradley's comments at Fort\r\nKnox, it was the Secretary of the Army, not the Chief of Staff, who\r\nled the fight against change in the Army's racial practices. As the\r\ndebate over these practices warmed in the administration and the\r\nnational press, Kenneth C. Royall emerged as the principal spokesman\r\nagainst further integration and the principal target of the civil\r\nrights forces. Royall's sincere interest in the welfare of black\r\nsoldiers, albeit highly paternalistic, was not in question. His\r\ntrouble with civil rights officials stemmed from the fact that he\r\nalone in the Truman administration still clung publicly to the belief\r\nthat segregation was not in itself discrimination, a belief shared by\r\nmany of his fellow citizens. Royall was convinced that the separate\r\nbut equal provisions of the Army's Gillem Board policy were right in\r\nas much as they did provide equal treatment and opportunity for the\r\nblack minority. His opinion was reinforced by the continual assurances\r\nof his military subordinates that in open competition with white\r\nsoldiers few Negroes would ever achieve a proportionate share of\r\npromotions and better occupations. And when his subordinates added to\r\nthis sentiment the notion that integration would disrupt the Army and\r\nendanger its efficiency, they quickly persuaded the already\r\nsympathetic Royall that segregation was not only correct but\r\nimperative.[13-30] The secretary might easily have agreed with General\r\nPaul, who told an assembly of Army commanders that aside from some\r\nneeded improvement in the employment of black specialists \"there isn't\r\na single complaint anyone can make in our use of the Negro.\"[13-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-30: Ltr, Marx Leva to author, 24 May 70,\r\n                   CMH files; see also Testimony of Royall at National\r\n                   Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26 Apr 48,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-31: General Paul's Remarks at Army\r\n                   Commanders Conference, 30 Mar-2 Apr 48, p. 30,\r\n                   CSUSA 337.]\r\n\r\nSecure in his belief that segregation was right and necessary, Royall\r\nconfidently awaited the judgment of the recently appointed President's\r\ncommittee. He was convinced that any fair judge could draw but one\r\nconclusion: under the provisions of Circular 124, Negroes had      (p. 323)\r\nalready achieved equal treatment and opportunity in the Army. His job,\r\ntherefore, was relatively simple. He had to defend Army policy against\r\noutside attack and make sure it was applied uniformly throughout the\r\nservice. His stand marked one of the last attempts by a major federal\r\nofficial to support a racially separate but equal system before the\r\nprinciple was finally struck down by the Supreme Court in _Brown_ v.\r\n_Board of Education_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY ROYALL REVIEWS MILITARY POLICE, _Yokohama,\r\nJapan, 1949_.]\r\n\r\nRoyall readily conceded that it was proper and necessary for Negroes\r\nto insist on integration, but, echoing a long-cherished Army belief,\r\nhe adamantly opposed using the Army to support or oppose any social\r\ncause. The Army, he contended, must follow the nation, not lead it, in\r\nsocial matters. The Army must not experiment. When, \"without prejudice\r\nto the National Defense,\" the Army could reduce segregation to the\r\nplatoon level it would do so, but all such steps should be taken one\r\nat a time. And 1948, he told the conference of black leaders in April\r\nof that year, was not the time.[13-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-32: See Testimony of Royall at National\r\n                   Defense Conference on Negro Affairs, 26 Apr 48, pp.\r\n                   24-26.]\r\n\r\nConvinced of the rightness of the Army's policy, Secretary Royall was\r\nunderstandably agitated by the unfavorable publicity directed at him\r\nand his department. The publicity, he was convinced, resulted from\r\ndiscrimination on the part of \"the Negro and liberal press\"        (p. 324)\r\nagainst the Army's policy in favor of the Navy and Air Force. He was\r\nparticularly incensed at the way the junior services had escaped the\r\n\"rap\"--his word--on racial matters. He ascribed it in large part, he\r\ntold the Secretary of Defense in September 1948, to the \"unfortunate\"\r\nNational Defense Conference, the gathering of black spokesmen held\r\nunder Forrestal's auspices the previous spring.[13-33] The specific\r\nobject of Royall's indignation was Lester Granger's final report on\r\nthe work of the National Defense Conference. That report emphasized\r\nthe conferees' rebuttal to Royall's defense of segregation on the\r\ngrounds of military expediency and past experience with black\r\nsoldiers. The Army has assumed a position, Granger claimed, that was\r\nunjustified by its own experience. Overlooking evidence to the\r\ncontrary, Granger added that the Army position was at variance with\r\nthe experience of the other services. His parting shot was aimed at\r\nthe heart of the Army's argument: \"It is as unwise as it is unsound to\r\ncite the resistance of military leadership against basic changes in\r\npolicy as sufficient cause for delaying immediate and effective\r\naction.\"[13-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-33: Memo, SA for SecDef, 22 Sep 48, copy\r\n                   in CD30-1-2, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-34: Ltr, Granger and Conferees to\r\n                   Forrestal, 26 Aug 48, D54-1-3, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nAdding to Royall's discomfort, Forrestal released the report on 8\r\nSeptember, and his letter of appreciation to Granger and the conferees\r\nassured them he would send their report to the President's committee.\r\nThe New York _Times_ promptly picked up Granger's reference to\r\nopposition among military leaders.[13-35] Royall tried to counter this\r\nattack. Since neither the President nor the Secretary of Defense had\r\ndisapproved the Army's racial policy nor suggested any modifications,\r\nRoyall told Forrestal he wanted him to go on record as approving the\r\nArmy position. This course would doubtless be more palatable to\r\nForrestal, Royall suggested, than having Royall announce that\r\nForrestal had given tacit approval to the Army's policy.[13-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-35: NME Press Release, 8 Sep 48; New York\r\n                   _Times_, September 9, 1948; Memo, Leva for\r\n                   Forrestal, 30 Aug 48; Ltr, Forrestal to Granger, 30\r\n                   Aug 48.

It was true, he told Royall,\r\nthat the Army's policy had not been disapproved. But neither had the\r\nArmy's policy or that of the Navy or Air Force yet been reviewed by\r\nthe Secretary of Defense. The President's committee would probably\r\nmake such a review an early order of business. Meanwhile, the Army's\r\nrace policy would continue in effect until it was altered either by\r\nForrestal's office or by action from some other source.[13-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-37: Memo (unsigned), Forrestal for\r\n                   Royall, 22 Sep 48. The answer was prepared by Leva\r\n                   and used by Forrestal as the basis for his\r\n                   conversation with Royall. See Memos, Leva for\r\n                   Forrestal, undated, and 30 Sep 48, both in\r\n                   CD30-1-2, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nEven as Secretary Royall tried to defend the Army from the attacks of\r\nthe press, the service's policy was challenged from another quarter.\r\nThe blunt fact was that with the reinstitution of selective service in\r\n1948 the Army was receiving more black recruits--especially those in\r\nthe lower mental categories--than a segregated system could easily\r\nabsorb. The high percentage of black soldiers so proudly publicized by\r\nRoyall at the National Defense Conference was in fact a source of\r\nanxiety for Army planners. The staff particularly resented the\r\ndifferent standards adopted by the other services to determine     (p. 325)\r\nthe acceptability of selectees. The Navy and Air Force, pleading their\r\nneed for skilled workers and dependence on volunteer enlistments,\r\nimposed a higher minimum achievement score for admission than the\r\nArmy, which, largely dependent upon the draft for its manpower, was\r\nrequired to accept men with lower scores. Thousands of Negroes, less\r\nskilled and with little education, were therefore eligible for service\r\nin the Army although they were excluded from the Navy and Air Force.\r\nGiven such circumstances, it was probably inevitable that differences\r\nin racial policies would precipitate an interservice conflict. The\r\nArmy claimed the difference in enlistment standards was discriminatory\r\nand contrary to the provisions of the draft law which required the\r\nSecretary of Defense to set enlistment standards. In April 1948\r\nSecretary Royall demanded that Forrestal impose the same mental\r\nstandards on all the services. He wanted inductees allocated to the\r\nservices according to their physical and mental abilities and Negroes\r\napportioned among them.\r\n\r\nThe other services countered that there were not enough well-educated\r\npeople of draft age to justify raising the Army's mental standards to\r\nthe Navy and Air Force levels, but neither service wanted to lower its\r\nown entrance standards to match the level necessity had imposed on the\r\nArmy. The Air Force eventually agreed to enlist Negroes at a 10\r\npercent ratio to whites, but the Navy held out for higher standards\r\nand no allocation by race. It contended that setting the same\r\nstandards for all services would improve the quality of the Army's\r\nblack enlistees only imperceptibly while it would do great damage to\r\nthe Navy. The Navy admitted that the other services should help the\r\nArmy, but not \"up to the point of _unnecessarily_ reducing their own\r\neffectiveness.... The modern Navy cannot operate its ships and\r\naircraft with personnel of G.C.T. 70.\"[13-38] General Bradley cut to the\r\npoint: if the Navy carried the day it would receive substantially\r\nfewer Negroes than the other two services and a larger portion of the\r\nbest qualified.[13-39] Secretary Forrestal first referred the\r\ninterservice controversy to the Munitions Board in May 1948 and later\r\nthat summer to a special interservice committee. After both groups\r\nfailed to reach an agreement,[13-40] Forrestal decided not to force a\r\nparity in mental standards upon the services. On 12 October he\r\nexplained to the secretaries that parity could be imposed only during\r\ntime of full mobilization, and since conditions in the period between\r\nOctober 1948 and June 1949 could not be considered comparable to those\r\nof full mobilization, parity was impossible. He promised, however, to\r\nstudy the qualitative needs of each service. Meanwhile, he had found\r\nno evidence that any service was discriminating in the selection\r\nof enlistees and settled for a warning that any serious            (p. 326)\r\ndiscrimination by any two of the services would place \"an intolerable\r\nburden\" on the third.[13-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-38: Memo, SecNav for SecDef, 27 May 48,\r\n                   sub: Liaison With the Selective Service System and\r\n                   Determination of Parity Standards, P14-6; Memo,\r\n                   Actg SecNav for SecDef, 17 Aug 48; sub: Items in\r\n                   Disagreement Between the Services as Listed in\r\n                   SecDef's Memo of 15 Jul 48, P 14-4; both in\r\n                   GenRecsNav.

Projecting these figures\r\nagainst the possible mobilization of five million men (assuming each\r\nservice increased in proportion to its current strength and absorbed\r\nthe same percentage of a black population remaining at 12 percent of\r\nthe whole), the Army calculated that its low entrance requirements\r\nwould give it a black strength of 21 percent. In the event of a\r\nmobilization equaling or surpassing that of World War II, the minimum\r\ntest score of seventy would probably be lowered, and thus the Army\r\nwould shoulder an even greater burden of poorly educated men, a burden\r\nthat in the Army's view should be shared by all the services.[13-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-42: DF, Dir, P&A, to CofS, 24 Jan 49,\r\n                   sub: Experimental Unit, GSPGA 291.2 (24 Jan 49).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Different Approach_\r\n\r\nNo matter how the Army tried to justify segregation or argue against\r\nthe position of the Navy and Air Force, the integrationists continued\r\nto gain ground. Royall, in opposition, adopted a new tactic in the\r\nwake of the Truman order. He would have the Army experiment with\r\nintegration, perhaps proving that it would not work on a large scale,\r\ncertainly buying time for Circular 124 and frustrating the rising\r\ndemand for change. He had expressed willingness to experiment with an\r\nintegrated Army unit when Lester Granger made the suggestion through\r\nForrestal in February 1948, but nothing came of it.[13-43] In September\r\nhe returned to the idea, asking the Army staff to plan for the\r\nformation of an integrated unit about the size of a regimental combat\r\nteam, along with an engineer battalion and the station complement of a\r\npost large enough to accommodate these troops. Black enlisted men were\r\nto form 10 percent of the troop basis and be used in all types of\r\npositions. Black officers, used in the same ratio as black officers in\r\nthe whole Army, were to command mixed troops. General Bradley reported\r\nthe staff had studied the idea and concluded that such units \"did not\r\nprove anything on the subject.\" Royall, however, dismissed the staff's\r\nobjection and reiterated his order to plan an experiment at a large\r\ninstallation and in a permanent unit.[13-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-43: Memo, SecDef for President, 29 Feb\r\n                   48, Secretary's File (PSF), Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-44: Memo, CofS for Dir, O&T, 11 Oct 48,\r\n                   CSUSA 291.2 Negroes (11 Oct 48).]\r\n\r\nDespite the staff's obvious reluctance, Maj. Gen. Harold R. Bull, the\r\nnew Director of Organization and Training, made an intensive study of\r\nthe alternatives. He produced a plan that was in turn further refined\r\nby a group of senior officers including the Deputy Chief of Staff for\r\nAdministration and the Chief of Information.[13-45] These officers (p. 327)\r\ndecided that \"if the Secretary of the Army so orders,\" the Army could\r\nactivate an experimental unit in the 3d Infantry Division at Camp\r\nCampbell, Kentucky. The troops, 10 percent of them black, would be\r\ndrawn from all parts of the country and include ten black officers,\r\nnone above the rank of major. The unit would be carefully monitored by\r\nthe Army staff, and its commander would report on problems encountered\r\nafter a year's trial.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-45: Lt Col D. M. Oden, Asst Secy, CS,\r\n                   Memo for Rcd, 4 Nov 48, sub: Organization of an\r\n                   Experimental Unit, CSUSA 291.2 (Negroes) (11 Oct\r\n                   48).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPRING FORMAL DANCE, FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, MARYLAND,\r\n1952.]\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that Forrestal wanted to avoid publicizing the project.\r\nHe had his assistants, Marx Leva and John Ohly, discuss the proposal\r\nwith the Secretary of the Array to impress on him the need for secrecy\r\nuntil all arrangements were completed. More important, he hoped to\r\nturn Royall's experiment back on the Army itself, using it to gain a\r\nfoothold for integration in the largest service. Leva and Ohly\r\nsuggested to Royall that instead of activating a special unit he\r\nselect a Regular Army regiment--Leva recommended one from the 82d\r\nAirborne Division to which a number of black combat units were already\r\nattached--as the nucleus of the experiment. With an eye to the\r\nforthcoming White House investigation, Leva added that, while the\r\ndetails would be left to the Army, integration of the unit, to be put\r\ninto effect \"as soon as possible,\" should be total.[13-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-46: Memo, Marx Leva for SA, 22 Nov 48;\r\n                   see also idem for Ohly, 16 Nov 48; both in CD\r\n                   30-1-2, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nThe plan for a large-scale integrated unit progressed little       (p. 328)\r\nbeyond this point, but it was significant if only because it marked\r\nthe first time since the Revolution that the Army had seriously\r\nconsidered using a large number of black soldiers in a totally\r\nintegrated unit. The situation was not without its note of irony, for\r\nthe purpose of the plan was not to abolish the racial discrimination\r\nthat critics were constantly laying at the Army's doorstep. In fact,\r\nArmy leaders, seriously dedicated to the separate but equal principle,\r\nwere convinced the Gillem Board policy had already eliminated\r\ndiscrimination. Nor was the plan designed to carry out the President's\r\norder or prompted by the Secretary of Defense. Rather, it was pushed\r\nby Secretary Royall as a means of defending the Army against the\r\nanticipated demands of the President's committee.\r\n\r\nThe plan died because, while the Army staff studied organizations and\r\ncounted bodies, Royall expanded his proposal for an integrated unit to\r\ninclude elements of the whole national defense establishment. Several\r\nmotives have been suggested for his move. By ensnaring the Navy and\r\nAir Force in the experiment, he might impress on all concerned the\r\nproblems he considered certain to arise if any service attempted the\r\nintegration of a large number of Negroes. An experiment involving the\r\nwhole department might also divert the White House from trying to\r\nintegrate the Army immediately. Besides, the scheme had an escape\r\nclause. If the Navy and Air Force refused to cooperate, and Royall\r\nthought it likely they would, given the shortage of skilled black\r\nrecruits, the Army could then legitimately cancel its offer to\r\nexperiment with integration and let the whole problem dissipate in a\r\nlengthy interservice argument.[13-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-47: Interv, author with James C. Evans, 1\r\n                   Jul 70; Ltr, E. W. Kenworthy, Exec Secy,\r\n                   Presidential Committee, to Lee Nichols, 28 Jul 53;\r\n                   both in CMH files.]\r\n\r\nRoyall formally proposed a defense-wide experiment in integration to\r\nForrestal on 2 December. He was not oblivious to the impression his\r\nvacillation on the subject had produced and went to some lengths to\r\nexplain why he had opposed such experiments in the past. Although he\r\nhad been thinking about such an experiment for some time, he told\r\nForrestal, he had publicly rejected the idea at the National Defense\r\nConference and during the Senate hearings on the draft law because of\r\nthe tense international situation and the small size of the Army at\r\nthat time. His interest in the experiment revived as the size of the\r\nArmy increased and similar suggestions were made by both black leaders\r\nand southern politicians, but again he had hesitated, this time\r\nbecause of the national elections. He was now prepared to go ahead,\r\nbut only if similar action were taken by the other services.\r\n\r\nThe experimental units, he advised Forrestal, should contain both\r\ncombat and service elements of considerable size, and he went on to\r\nspecify their composition in some detail. The Navy and Marine Corps\r\nshould include at least one shore station \"where the social problems\r\nfor individuals and their families will approximate those confronting\r\nthe Army.\" To insure the experiment's usefulness, he wanted Negroes\r\nemployed in all positions, including supervisory ones, for which they\r\nqualified, and he urged that attention be paid to \"the problem of\r\nsocial relations in off-duty hours.\" He was candid about the plan's\r\nweaknesses. The right to transfer out of the experimental unit might\r\nconfine the experiment to white and black troops who wanted it to  (p. 329)\r\nsucceed; hence any conclusions drawn might be challenged as invalid\r\nsince men could not be given the right to exercise similar options in\r\ntime of war. Therefore, if the experiment succeeded, it would have to\r\nbe followed by another in which no voluntary options were granted. The\r\nexperiment might also bring pressure from groups outside the Army, and\r\nif it failed \"for any reason\" the armed services would be accused of\r\nsabotage, no matter how sincere their effort. Curiously, he admitted\r\nthat the plan was not favored by his military advisers. The Army\r\nstaff, he noted in what must have surprised anyone familiar with the\r\nstaff's consistent defense of segregation, thought the best way to\r\neliminate segregation was to reduce gradually the size of segregated\r\nunits and extend integration in schools, hospitals, and special units.\r\nNevertheless, Royall recommended that the National Military\r\nEstablishment as a whole, not the Army separately, go forward with the\r\nexperiment and that it start early in 1949.[13-48]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-48: Memo, SA for SecDef, 2 Dec 48, CD\r\n                   30-1-2, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nThe other services had no intention of going forward with such an\r\nexperiment. The Air Force objected, as Secretary Symington explained,\r\nbecause the experiment would be inconclusive; too many artificial\r\nfeatures were involved, especially having units composed of\r\nvolunteers. Arbitrary quotas violated the principle of equal\r\nopportunity, he charged, and the experiment would be unfair to Negroes\r\nbecause the proportion of Negroes able to compete with whites was less\r\nthan 1 to 10. Symington also warned against the public relations\r\naspect of the scheme, which was of \"minimal military significance but\r\nof major significance in the current public controversy on purely\r\nracial issues.\" The Air Force could conduct the experiment without\r\ndifficulty, he conceded, for there were enough trained black\r\ntechnicians to man 10 percent of the positions and give a creditable\r\nperformance, but these men were representative neither of the general\r\nblack population of the Air Force nor of Negroes coming into the\r\nservice during wartime.\r\n\r\nSymington predicted that Negroes would suffer no matter how the\r\nexperiment came out--success would be attributed to the special\r\nconditions involved; failure would reflect unjustly on the Negro's\r\ncapabilities. The Air Force, therefore, preferred to refrain from\r\nparticipation in the experiment. Symington added that he was\r\nconsidering a study prepared by the Air staff over the past six months\r\nthat would insure equality of treatment and increased opportunities\r\nfor Negroes in the Air Force, and he expected to offer proposals to\r\nForrestal in the immediate future.[13-49]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-49: Memo, SecAF for SecDef, 22 Dec 48, CD\r\n                   30-1-2, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy also wanted no part of the Royall experiment. Its acting\r\nsecretary, John Nicholas Brown, believed that the gradual\r\nindoctrination of the naval establishment was producing the desired\r\nnondiscriminatory practices \"on a sound and permanent basis without\r\nconcomitant problems of morale and discipline.\" To adopt Royall's\r\nproposal, on the other hand, would \"unnecessarily risk losing all that\r\nhas been accomplished in the solution of the efficient utilization of\r\nNegro personnel to the limit of their ability.\"[13-50] Brown did not\r\nspell out the risk, but a Navy spokesman on Forrestal's staff was  (p. 330)\r\nnot so reticent. \"Mutiny cannot be dismissed from consideration,\"\r\nCapt. Herbert D. Riley warned, if the Navy were forced to integrate\r\nits officers' wardrooms, staterooms, and clubs. Such integration ran\r\nconsiderably in advance of the Navy's current and carefully controlled\r\nintegration of the enlisted general service and would, like the\r\nproposal to place Negroes in command of white officers and men,\r\nCaptain Riley predicted, have such dire results as wholesale\r\nresignations and retirements.[13-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-50: Memo, Actg SecNav for SecDef, 28 Dec\r\n                   48, CD 30-1-2, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-51: Memo, Capt H.

In short, the Navy and\r\nAir Force had progressed in their own estimation to the point where,\r\ndespite shortcomings in their racial policies rivaling the Army's,\r\nthey had little to fear from the coming White House investigation. The\r\nArmy could show no similar forward motion. Despite Royall's claim that\r\nhe and the Army staff favored eventual integration of black soldiers\r\nthrough progressive reduction in the size of the Army's segregated\r\nblack units, the facts indicated otherwise. For example, while\r\nSecretary of Defense Forrestal was touring Germany in late 1948 he\r\nnoted in his diary of Lt. Gen. Clarence R. Huebner, now the commander\r\nof Europe: \"Huebner's experience with colored troops is excellent....\r\nHe is ready to proceed with the implementation of the President's\r\ndirective about nonsegregation down to the platoon level, and proposes\r\nto initiate this in the three cavalry regiments and the AA battalion\r\nup north, but does not want to do it if it is premature.\"[13-52]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-52: Millis, _Forrestal Diaries_, p. 528.]\r\n\r\nHuebner's concern with prematurity was understandable, for the\r\npossibility of using black soldiers in the constabulary had been a\r\nlively topic in the Army for some time. Marcus Ray had proposed it in\r\nhis December 1946 report to the Secretary of War, but it was quickly\r\nrejected by the Army staff. The staff had approved Huebner's decision\r\nin July 1948 to attach a black engineer construction battalion and a\r\ntransportation truck company, a total of 925 men, to the constabulary.\r\nThe Director of Organization and Training, however, continued to\r\nmake a careful distinction between attached units and \"organic     (p. 331)\r\nassignment,\" adding that \"the Department of the Army does not favor\r\nthe organic assignment of Negro units to the Constabulary at this\r\ntime.\"[13-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-53: DF, Dir, O&T, to DCofS, 14 Jul 48,\r\n                   sub: Report of Visit by Negro Publishers and\r\n                   Editors to the European Theater, CSGOT 291.2 (14\r\n                   May 48); Memo for Rcd, attached to Memo, Dir, P&A,\r\n                   for DCofS, 21 Jul 48, same sub, CSGPA 291.2 (14 May\r\n                   48).

As he\r\nlater put it, he had no need for a black infantry regiment, but since\r\nthe constabulary, composed for the most part of cavalry units, lacked\r\nfoot soldiers, he wanted to integrate a black infantry battalion, in\r\nplatoon-size units, in each cavalry regiment.[13-54] The staff turned\r\ndown his request. Arguing that the inclusion of organic black units in\r\nthe constabulary \"might be detrimental to the proper execution of its\r\nmission,\" and quoting the provision of Circular 124 limiting\r\nintegration to the company level, the staff's organization experts\r\nconcluded that the use of black units in the European theater below\r\ncompany size \"would undoubtedly prove embarrassing to the Department\r\nof the Army ... in the Zone of the Interior in view of the announced\r\nDepartment of the Army policy.\" General Bull, Director of Organization\r\nand Training, informed Huebner he might use black units in composite\r\ngroupings only at the company level, including his constabulary\r\nforces, \"if such is desired by you,\" but it was \"not presently\r\ncontemplated that integration of Negro units on the platoon level will\r\nbe approved as Department of the Army policy.\"[13-55] Huebner later\r\nrecalled that the constabulary was his outfit, to be run his way, and\r\n\"Bradley and Collins always let me do what I had to.\"[13-56] Still, when\r\nblack infantrymen joined the constabulary in late 1948, they came in\r\nthree battalion-size units \"attached\" for training and tactical\r\ncontrol.[13-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-54: Interv, author with Huebner.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-55: Ltr, Dir, O&T, to CG, EUCOM, 13 Dec\r\n                   48, sub: Integration of Negro Units on the Platoon\r\n                   Level Within the Constabulary EUCOM, CSGOT 291.21\r\n                   (24 Nov 48); DF, Dir, O&T, to CofS, 9 Dec 48, same\r\n                   sub, CSUSA 291.2 (24 Nov 48).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-56: Interv, author with Huebner.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-57: Geis Monograph, p. 90.

Accurately summarizing the situation in March\r\n1949, The Adjutant General informed Army commanders that although it\r\nwas \"strategically unwise\" to republish War Department Circular 124\r\nwhile the President's committee was meeting, the policies contained in\r\nthat document, which was about to expire, would continue in effect\r\nuntil further notice.[13-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-58: Ltr, TAG to Distribution, 23 Mar 49,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower, AGAO 291.2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Navy: Business as Usual_\r\n\r\nThe Navy Department also saw no reason to alter its postwar racial\r\npolicy because of the Truman order. As Acting Secretary of Navy Brown\r\nexplained to the Secretary of Defense in December 1948, whites in  (p. 332)\r\nhis service had come to accept the fact that blacks must take their\r\nrightful place in the Navy and Marine Corps. This acceptance, in turn,\r\nhad led to \"very satisfactory progress\" in the integration of the\r\ndepartment's black personnel without producing problems of morale and\r\ndiscipline or a lowering of _esprit de corps_.[13-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-59: Memo, Actg SecNav for SecDef et al.,\r\n                   28 Dec 48, sub: The Secretary of the Army's\r\n                   Confidential Memorandum of 2 December..., copy in\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nBrown had ample statistics at hand to demonstrate that at least in the\r\nNavy this nondiscrimination policy was progressive. Whereas at the end\r\nof the World War II demobilization only 6 percent of the Navy's\r\nNegroes served in the general service, some two years later 38 percent\r\nwere so assigned. These men and women generally worked and lived under\r\ntotal integration, and the men served on many of the Navy's combat\r\nships. The Bureau of Naval Personnel predicted in early 1949 that\r\nbefore the end of the year at least half of all black sailors would be\r\nassigned to the general service.[13-60] In contrast to the Army's policy\r\nof separate but equal service for its black troops, the Navy's postwar\r\nracial policy was technically correct and essentially in compliance\r\nwith the President's order. Yet progress was very limited and in fact\r\nin the two years under its postwar nondiscrimination policy, the\r\nNavy's performance was only marginally different from that of the\r\nother services. The number of Negroes in the Navy in December 1948,\r\nthe same month Brown was extolling its nondiscrimination policy,\r\ntotaled some 17,000 men, 4.5 percent of its strength and about half\r\nthe Army's proportion. This percentage had remained fairly constant\r\nsince World War II and masked a dramatic drop in the number of black\r\nmen in uniform as the Navy demobilized. Thus while the _percentage_ of\r\nthe Navy's black sailors assigned to the integrated general service\r\nrose from 6 to 38, the _number_ of Negroes in the general service\r\ndropped from 9,900 in 1946 to some 6,000 in 1948. Looked at another\r\nway, the 38 percent figure of blacks in the general service meant that\r\n62 percent of all Negroes in the Navy, 10,871 men in December 1948,\r\nstill served in the separate Steward's Branch.[13-61] In contrast to the\r\nArmy and Air Force, the Navy's Negroes were, with only the rarest\r\nexception, enlisted men. The number of black officers in December 1948\r\nwas four; the WAVES could count only six black women in its 2,130  (p. 333)\r\ntotal. Clearly, the oft repeated rationale for these statistics--Negroes\r\nfavored the Army because they were not a seafaring people--could\r\nnot explain them away.[13-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-60: Testimony of Stickney Before the\r\n                   President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Services, 25 Apr 49, pp.\r\n                   19-20.

On 31 March 1949, for\r\n                   example, the racial and ethnic breakdown of the\r\n                   branch was as follows:\r\n\r\n                      Negro       10,499     Hawaiian           5\r\n                      Filipino     4,707     Puerto Rican       4\r\n                      Chamorro       641     Japanese           1\r\n                      Chinese         55     American Indian    1\r\n                      Samoan          25     Caucasian          1\r\n                      Korean           9     Total         15,945\r\n\r\n                   _Source_: Figures taken from BuPers, \"Steward Group\r\n                   Personnel by Race,\" 24 May 49, Pers 25,\r\n                   BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-62: This dubious assertion on the\r\n                   seagoing interests of races had been most recently\r\n                   expressed by the Chief of Naval Personnel before a\r\n                   meeting of the President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services;\r\n                   see Testimony of Fechteler, 13 Jan 49, pp. 107-08.]\r\n\r\nA substantial increase in the number of Negroes would have absolved\r\nthe Navy from some of the stigma of racial discrimination it endured\r\nin the late 1940's. Since the size of the Steward's Branch was limited\r\nby regulation and budget, any increase in black enlistment would\r\nimmediately raise the number of Negroes serving in the integrated\r\ngeneral service. Increased enlistments would also widen the choice of\r\nassignments, creating new opportunities for promotion to higher\r\ngrades. But even this obvious and basic response to the Truman order\r\nwas not forthcoming. The Navy continued to exclude many potential\r\nblack volunteers on the grounds that it needed to maintain stricter\r\nmental and physical standards to secure men capable of running a\r\nmodern, technically complex Navy. True, regular and reserve officers\r\nwere periodically sent to black colleges to discuss naval careers with\r\nthe students, but as one official, speaking of the reserves, confessed\r\nto the Fahy Committee in April 1949, \"We aren't doing anything special\r\nto procure Negro officers or Negro enlisted men.\"[13-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-63: Testimony of Capt J.

The Bureau of Naval Personnel had closed the branch\r\nto first enlistments and provided for the transfer of eligible\r\nstewards to the general service, but black stewards were only\r\ntransferring at the rate of seven men per month, hardly enough to\r\nalter the racial composition of the branch. In the six months\r\nfollowing September 1948 the branch's black strength dropped by 910\r\nmen, but because the total strength of the branch also dropped, the\r\npercentage of black stewards remained constant.[13-64] What was needed\r\nwas an infusion of whites, but this remedy, like an increase of black\r\nofficers, would require a fundamental change in the racial attitudes\r\nof Navy leaders. No such change was evident in the Navy's postwar\r\nracial policy. While solemnly proclaiming its belief in the principle\r\nof nondiscrimination, the service had continued to sanction practices\r\nthat limited integration and equal opportunity to a degree consistent\r\nwith its racial tradition and manpower needs. Curiously, the Navy\r\nmanaged to avoid strong criticism from the civil rights groups\r\nthroughout the postwar period, and the Truman order notwithstanding,\r\nit was therefore in a strong position to resist precipitous change (p. 334)\r\nin its racial practices.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-64: Memo, Head, Pers Accounting and\r\n                   Statistical Control Sec, BuPers, for Dir, Fiscal\r\n                   Div (Pers 83), 14 Dec 48, sub: Statistics on\r\n                   Steward Group Personnel in Navy; Memo, W.

Basic training, for example, was integrated in the\r\ncause of military efficiency. With fewer than twenty new black\r\nrecruits a month, the corps was finding it too expensive and\r\ninefficient to maintain a separate recruit training program, and on 1\r\nJuly 1949 the commandant, General Clifton B. Cates, ordered that\r\nNegroes be trained with the rest of the recruits at Parris Island, but\r\nin separate platoons.[13-65] Even this system proved too costly, however,\r\nbecause black recruits were forced to wait for training until their\r\nnumbers built up to platoon size. Given the length of the training\r\ncycle, the camp commander had to reserve three training platoons for\r\nthe few black recruits. Maj. Gen. Alfred H. Noble, the commander,\r\nrepeatedly complained of the waste of instructors, time, and\r\nfacilities and the \"otherwise generally undesirable\" features of\r\nseparate black training platoons. He pointed out to the commandant\r\nthat black students had been successfully assimilated into personnel\r\nadministration and drill instructor schools without friction or\r\nincident, and reservist training and local intramural sports had\r\nalready peacefully introduced integration to the base. Noble wanted to\r\nintegrate black recruits as they arrived, absorbing them in the white\r\ntraining platoons then being processed. He also wanted to use selected\r\nblack noncommissioned officers as instructors.[13-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-65: Memo, CMC for CG, MB, Cp Lejeune,\r\n                   N.C., 23 Aug 48, sub: Recruit Training Load at\r\n                   Montford Point Camp, MC 1035238; idem for CG, MCRD,\r\n                   26 May 49, MC 1091093; Memo, Dir of Recruiting for\r\n                   Off in Charge, Recruit Divs, 13 Jun 49, sub:\r\n                   Enlistment of Negro Personnel.

Noble later recalled the\r\ncircumstance of the first significant instance of integration in the\r\nhistory of the Marine Corps:\r\n\r\n     This innovation not only produced no unfavorable reaction among\r\n     the Marines, but also it had no unfavorable reaction among the\r\n     civilian citizens of South Carolina in the vicinity. Of course I\r\n     consulted the civilian leaders first and told them what I was\r\n     going to do and got their advice and promises of help to try to\r\n     stop any adverse criticisms of it. It seemed like integration was\r\n     due to take place sooner or later anyway in this country,\r\n     certainly in the Armed Forces, and I thought that it should take\r\n     place in the Armed Forces first.[13-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-67: This limited integration program was\r\n                   announced by the Secretary of the Navy on 22\r\n                   December 1949; see Memo, Under SecNav for Chmn,\r\n                   PPB, 22 Dec 49, PPB files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-68: USMC Oral History Interview with\r\n                   Noble, 20-23 May 68.]\r\n\r\nSince manpower restrictions also made the organization of          (p. 335)\r\nadministratively separate black units hard to justify, the postwar\r\nreduction in the number of black marines eventually led to the\r\nformation of a number of racially composite units. Where once separate\r\nblack companies were the norm, by 1949 the corps had organized most of\r\nits black marines into separate platoons and assigned them as parts of\r\nlarger white units. In March 1949 Secretary of the Navy Sullivan\r\nreported that with the minor exception of several black depot\r\ncompanies, the largest black units in the Marine Corps were platoons\r\nof forty-three men, \"and they are integrated with other platoons of\r\nwhites.\"[13-69]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-69: Testimony of the Secretary of the\r\n                   Navy Before President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, 28\r\n                   Mar 49, afternoon session, p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL CATES.]\r\n\r\nThe cutback in the size and kinds of black units and the integration\r\nof recruit training removed the need for the separate camp at Montford\r\nPoint, home base for black marines since the beginning of World War\r\nII. The camp's last two organizations, a provisional company and a\r\nheadquarters company, were inactivated on 31 July and 9 September,\r\nrespectively, thus ending an era in the history of Negroes in the\r\nMarine Corps.[13-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-70: On the closing of Montford Point, see\r\n                   Interv, Blumenson with Sgt Max Rousseau, Admin\r\n                   Chief, G-1 Div, USMC (former member of the Montford\r\n                   Point Camp headquarters), 21 Feb 66, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nComposite grouping of small black units usually provided for separate\r\nassignment and segregated facilities. As late as February 1949, the\r\ncommandant made clear he had no intention of allowing the corps to\r\ndrift into a _de facto_ integration policy. When, for example, it came\r\nto his attention that some commanders were restricting appointment of\r\nqualified black marines to specialist schools on the grounds that\r\ntheir commands lacked billets for black specialists, the commandant\r\nreiterated the principle that assignment to specialty training was to\r\nbe made without regard to race. At the same time he emphasized that\r\nthis policy was not to be construed as an endorsement of the use of\r\nblack specialists in white units. General Cates specifically\r\nstipulated that where no billets in their specialty or a related one\r\nwere available for black specialists in black units, his headquarters\r\nwas to be informed. The implication of this order was obvious to the\r\nDivision of Plans and Policies. \"This is an important one,\" a division\r\nofficial commented, \"it involves finding billets for Negro specialists\r\neven if we have to create a unit to do it.\"[13-71] It was also obvious\r\nthat when the Under Secretary of the Navy, Dan A. Kimball,         (p. 336)\r\nreported to the Personnel Policy Board in May that \"Negro Marines,\r\nincluding Stewards, are assigned to other [white] Marine Corps units\r\nin accord with their specialty,\" he was speaking of rare exceptions to\r\nthe general rule.[13-72]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-71: Memo, CMC for CG, FMF, Pacific, 11\r\n                   Feb 49, with attached Handwritten Note, Div of\r\n                   Plans and Policies to Asst CMC, 11 Feb 49.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-72: Memo, Under SecNav for Chmn, PPB, 2\r\n                   May 49, PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\nCates seemed determined to ignore the military inefficiency attendant\r\non such elaborate attempts to insure the continued isolation of black\r\nmarines. The defense establishment, he was convinced, \"could not be an\r\nagency for experimentation in civil liberty without detriment to its\r\nability to maintain the efficiency and the high state of readiness so\r\nessential to national defense.\" Having thus tied military efficiency\r\nto segregation, Cates explained to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy\r\nfor Air that the efficiency of a unit was a command responsibility,\r\nand so long as that responsibility rested with the commander, he must\r\nbe authorized to make such assignments as he deemed necessary. It\r\nfollowed, then, that segregation was a national, not a military,\r\nproblem, and any attempt to change national policy through the armed\r\nforces was, in the commandant's words, \"a dangerous path to pursue\r\ninasmuch as it affects the ability of the National Military\r\nEstablishment to fulfill its mission.\" Integration must first be\r\naccepted as a national custom, he concluded, \"before it could be\r\nadopted in the armed forces.\"[13-73] Nor was General Cates ambiguous on\r\nMarine Corps policy when it was questioned by civil rights leaders.\r\nIndividual marines, he told the commander of a black depot company in\r\na case involving opportunities available to reenlisting black marines,\r\nwould be employed in the future as in the past \"to serve the best\r\ninterests of the Corps under existing circumstances.\"[13-74]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-73: Memo, CMC for Asst SecNav for Air, 17\r\n                   Mar 49, sub: Proposed Directive for the Armed\r\n                   Forces for the Period 1 July 1949 to 1 July 1950,\r\n                   AO-1, MC files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-74: Idem for CO, Second Depot Co, Service\r\n                   Cmd, FMF, 2 May 49, sub: Employment of Negroes in\r\n                   the Marine Corps, MC1008783, MC files.]\r\n\r\nActually, Cates was only forcibly expressing a cardinal tenet common\r\nto all the military services: the civil rights of the individual must\r\nbe subordinated to the mission of the service. What might appear to a\r\ncivil rights activist to be a callous and prejudiced response to a\r\nlegitimate social complaint was more likely an expression of the\r\ncommandant's overriding concern for his military mission. Still it was\r\ndifficult to explain such elaborate precautions in a corps where\r\nNegroes numbered less than 2 percent of the total strength.[13-75] How\r\ncould the integration of 1,500 men throughout the worldwide units of\r\nthe corps disrupt its mission, civil rights spokesmen might well   (p. 337)\r\nask, especially given the evidence to the contrary in the Navy? In\r\nview of the President's order, how could the corps justify the\r\nproliferation of very small black units that severely restricted the\r\nspread of occupational opportunities for Negroes?\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-75: On 30 June 1949 the Marine Corps had\r\n                   1,504 Negroes on active duty, 1.9 percent of the\r\n                   total if the one-year enlistees were included or\r\n                   2.08 percent if the one-year enlistees were\r\n                   excluded.

As the\r\nnumber of marines continued to drop, the Division of Plans and\r\nPolicies was forced to justify the existence of black units by a\r\nseries of reorganizations and redistributions. When, for example, the\r\nreorganization of the Fleet Marine Force caused the inactivation of\r\ntwo black depot units, the division designated a 108-man truck company\r\nas a black unit to take up the slack. At the same time the division\r\nfound yet another \"suitable\" occupation for black marines by laying\r\ndown a policy that all security detachments at inactive naval\r\nfacilities were to be manned by Negroes. It also decided to assign\r\nsmall black units to the service battalions of the Marine divisions,\r\nmaintaining that such assignments would not run counter to the\r\ncommandant's policy of restricting Negroes to noncombat\r\norganizations.[13-76]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-76: Memo, Dir, Div of Plans and Policies,\r\n                   for CMC, 28 Jul 49, sub: Re-assignment of Negro\r\n                   Marines to Existing units (DP&P Study 88-49), MC\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nThe Marine Corps, in short, had no intention of relaxing its policy of\r\nseparating the races. The timing of the integration of recruit\r\ntraining and the breakup of some large black units perhaps suggested a\r\ngeneral concession to the Truman order, but these administrative\r\nchanges were actually made in response to the manpower restrictions of\r\nthe Truman defense budget. In fact, the position of black marines\r\nin small black units became even more isolated in the months       (p. 338)\r\nfollowing the Truman order as the Division of Plans and Policies began\r\ndevising racially separate assignments. Like the stewards before them,\r\nthe security guards at closed naval installations and ammunition\r\ndepots found themselves in assignments increasingly viewed as\r\n\"colored\" jobs. That the number of Negroes in the Marine Corps was so\r\nsmall aided and abetted these arrangements, which promised to continue\r\ndespite the presidential order until some dramatic need for change\r\narose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Air Force Plans for Limited Integration_\r\n\r\nOf all the services, the Air Force was in the best position to respond\r\npromptly to President Truman's call for equal treatment and\r\nopportunity. For some time a group of Air staff officers had been\r\nengaged in devising a new approach to the use of black manpower.\r\nIndeed their study, much of which antedated the Truman order,\r\nrepresented the solution of the Air Force's manpower experts to a\r\npressing problem in military efficiency. More important than the\r\nexecutive order or demands of civil rights advocates, the criticism of\r\nsegregation by these experts in uniform led the Air Force to accept\r\nthe need for limited integration.\r\n\r\nBut there was to be no easy road to integration for the service.\r\nConsiderable resistance was yet to be overcome, both in the Air staff\r\nand among senior commanders. As Secretary Zuckert later put it, while\r\nthere was sentiment for integration among a few of the highest\r\nofficers, \"you didn't have to scratch far to run into opposition.\"[13-77]\r\nThe Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, General Edwards, reported to\r\nSecretary Symington that he had found solid opposition to any proposed\r\npolicy of integration in the service.[13-78] Normally such resistance\r\nwould have killed the study group's proposals. In the Army, for\r\nexample, opposition supported by Secretary Royall had blocked change.\r\nIn the Air Force, the opposition received no such support. Indeed,\r\nSecretary Symington proved to be the catalyst that the Army had\r\nlacked. He was the Air Force's margin of difference, transforming the\r\nstudy group's proposal from a staffing paper into a program for\r\nsubstantial change in racial policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-77: Notes on Telecon, author with\r\n                   Zuckert, 28 Apr 70, CMH files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-78: Memo, DCofS/P&A, USAF, for SecAF, 29\r\n                   Apr 48, sub: Conference With Group of Prominent\r\n                   Negroes, Negro Affairs, 1948, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nIn Symington the Air Force had a secretary who was not only a\r\ntough-minded businessman demanding efficiency but a progressive\r\npolitician with a humanitarian interest in providing equal opportunity\r\nfor Negroes. \"With Symington,\" Eugene Zuckert has pointed out, \"it was\r\nprinciple first, efficiency second.\"[13-79] Symington himself later\r\nexplained the source of his humanitarian interest. \"What determined me\r\nmany years ago was a quotation from Bernard Shaw in Myrdal's book,\r\n_American Dilemma_, which went something like this--'First the\r\nAmerican white man makes the negro clean his shoes, then criticizes\r\nhim for being a bootblack.' All Americans should have their chance.\r\nAnd both my grandfathers were in the Confederate Army.\"[13-80] Symington\r\nhad successfully combined efficiency and humanitarianism before.   (p. 339)\r\nAs president of the Emerson Electric Manufacturing Company of St.\r\nLouis, he had racially integrated a major industry carrying out vital\r\nwar work in a border state, thereby increasing productivity. When he\r\nbecame secretary, Symington was immediately involved in the Air\r\nForce's race problems; he wanted to know, for instance, why only nine\r\nblack applicants had passed the qualifying examination for the current\r\ncadet program.[13-81] When President Truman issued his executive\r\norder, Symington was ready to move. In his own words, \"when Mr. Truman\r\nas Commander-in-Chief issued an order to integrate the Air Force, I\r\nasked him if he was serious. He said he was. Accordingly we did just\r\nthat. I turned the actual operations of the job over to my Assistant\r\nSecretary Eugene Zuckert.... It all worked out routinely.\"[13-82]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-79: Telecon, author with Zuckert.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-80: Ltr, Symington to David K. Niles, 28\r\n                   Jan 50, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-81: Memo, SecAF for Zuckert, 5 Jan 48;\r\n                   Penciled Note, signed \"Stu,\" attached to Memo,\r\n                   ASecAF for Symington, 20 Jan 48. All in SecAF\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-82: Ltr, W. Stuart Symington to author, 6\r\n                   May 70, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nTo call \"routine\" the fundamental change that took place in Air Force\r\nmanpower practices stretches the definition of the word. The\r\nintegration program required many months of intensive study and\r\nplanning, and many more months to carry out. Yet if integration under\r\nSymington was slow, it was also inevitable. Zuckert reported that\r\nSymington gave him about eight reasons for integration, the last\r\n\"because I said do it.\"[13-83] Symington's tough attitude, along with the\r\npresidential order, considerably eased the burden of those in the Air\r\nForce who were expected to abandon a tradition inherited from their\r\nArmy days. The secretary's diplomatic skill also softened opposition\r\nin other quarters. Symington, a master at congressional relations,\r\nsmoothed the way on Capitol Hill by successfully reassuring some\r\nsouthern leaders, in particular Congressman Carl Vinson of Georgia,\r\nthat integration had to come, but that it would come quietly and in a\r\nway least calculated to provoke its congressional opponents.[13-84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-83: Telecon, author with Zuckert.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-84: Ibid.; see also USAF Oral Hist Interv\r\n                   with Zuckert.]\r\n\r\nSymington assigned general responsibility for equal opportunity\r\nmatters to his assistant secretary for management, Eugene Zuckert, but\r\nthe task of formulating the specific plan fell to General Edwards. To\r\navoid conflict with some of his colleagues, Edwards resorted to the\r\nunorthodox means of ignoring the usual staff coordination. He sent his\r\nproposals directly to the Chief of Staff and then on to the secretary\r\nfor approval without reference to other staff agencies, one of which,\r\nthe Office of the Vice Chief of Staff, General Muir S. Fairchild, was\r\nthe focal point of staff opposition.[13-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-85: For discussion of the close-held\r\n                   nature of the USAF integration plan, see USAF Oral\r\n                   Hist Intervs with Davis and Marr; see also Ltrs,\r\n                   Marr to author, 19 Jun and 28 Jul 70.]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of evidence submitted by his long-standing study group,\r\nGeneral Edwards concluded that current Air Force policy for the use of\r\nblack manpower was \"wasteful, deleterious to military effectiveness\r\nand lacking in wartime application.\" The policy of the Navy was\r\nsuperior, he told the Chief of Staff and the secretary, with respect\r\nto military effectiveness, economy, and morale, especially when the\r\nneeds of full mobilization were considered. The Air Force would    (p. 340)\r\nprofit by adopting a policy similar to that of the Navy, and he\r\nproposed a program, to be \"vigorously implemented and monitored,\" that\r\nwould inactivate the all-black fighter wing and transfer qualified\r\nblack servicemen from that wing as well as from all the major commands\r\nto white units. One exception would be that those black specialists,\r\nwhose work was essential to the continued operation of their units,\r\nwould stay in their black units. Some black units would be retained to\r\nprovide for individuals ineligible for transfer to white units or for\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY SYMINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThe new program would abolish the 10 percent quota and develop\r\nrecruiting methods to enable the Air Force to secure only the \"best\r\nqualified\" enlistees of both races. Men chronically ineligible for\r\nadvancement, both black and white, would be eliminated. If too many\r\nNegroes enlisted despite these measures, Edwards explained that an\r\n\"administratively determined ceiling of Negro intake\" could be\r\nestablished, but the Air Force had no intention of establishing a\r\nminimum for black enlistees. As the Director of Personnel Planning put\r\nit, a racial floor was just as much a quota as a racial ceiling and\r\nhad the same effect of denying opportunity to some while providing\r\nspecial consideration for others.[13-86]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-86: Memo, Dir, Personnel Planning USAF,\r\n                   for the Fahy Cmte, 15 Jan 49, sub: Air Force\r\n                   Policies Regarding Negro Personnel, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThe manpower experts had decided that the social complications of such\r\na policy would be negligible--\"more imaginary than real.\" Edwards\r\nreferred to the Navy's experience with limited integration, which, he\r\njudged, had relieved rather than multiplied social tensions between\r\nthe races. Nevertheless he and his staff proposed \"as a conservative\r\nbut progressive step\" toward the integration of living quarters that\r\nthe Air Force arrange for separate sleeping quarters for blacks and\r\nwhites. The so-called \"barracks problem\" was the principal point of\r\ndiscussion within the Air staff, Edwards admitted, and \"perhaps the\r\nmost critical point of the entire policy.\" He predicted that the trend\r\ntoward more privacy in barracks, especially the separate cubicles\r\nprovided in construction plans for new barracks, would help solve\r\nwhatever problems might arise.[13-87]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-87: Summary Sheet DCS/P, USAF, for CS,\r\n                   USAF, and SecAF, 29 Dec 48, sub: Air Force Policies\r\n                   on Negro Personnel, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Chief of Staff, General Vandenberg, initialed the program\r\nwithout comment, Assistant Secretary Zuckert was enthusiastic. As\r\nZuckert explained to Symington, the program was predicated on free\r\ncompetition for all Air Force jobs, and he believed that it would also\r\neliminate social discrimination by giving black officers and men   (p. 341)\r\nall the privileges of Air Force social facilities. Although he\r\nadmitted that in the matter of living arrangements the plan \"only goes\r\npart way,\" he too was confident that time and changes in barracks\r\nconstruction would eliminate any problems.[13-88]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-88: Memo, ASecAF for Symington, 5 Jan 49,\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nSymington was already familiar with most of Edwards's conclusions, for\r\na summary had been sent him by the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff on 22\r\nDecember \"for background.\"[13-89] When he received Zuckert's comments he\r\nacted quickly. The next day he let the Secretary of Defense know what\r\nthe Air Force was doing. \"We propose,\" he told Forrestal, \"to adopt a\r\npolicy of integration.\" But he qualified that statement along the\r\nlines suggested by the Air staff: \"Although there will still be units\r\nmanned entirely by Negroes, all Negroes will not necessarily be\r\nassigned to these units. Qualified Negro personnel will be assigned to\r\nany duties in any Air Force activity strictly on the basis of the\r\nqualifications of the individual and the needs of the Air Force.\"[13-90]\r\nSymington tied the new program to military efficiency, explaining to\r\nForrestal that efficient use of black servicemen was one of the\r\nessentials of economic and effective air power. In this vein he\r\nsummarized the program and listed what he considered its advantages\r\nfor the Air Force.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-89: Memo, Maj Gen William F. McKee for\r\n                   Symington, 22 Dec 48, sub: Mr. Royall's Negro\r\n                   Experiment, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-90: Memo, SecAF for Forrestal, 6 Jan 49,\r\n                   Negro Affairs, 1949, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThe proposal forwarded to the Secretary of Defense in January 1949\r\ncommitted the Air Force to a limited integration policy frankly\r\nimitative of the Navy's. A major improvement over the Air Force's\r\ncurrent practices, the plan still fell considerably short of the\r\nlong-range goals enunciated in the Gillem Board Report, to say nothing\r\nof the implications of the President's equal opportunity order.\r\nAlthough it is impossible to say exactly why Symington decided to\r\nsettle for less than full integration, there are several explanations\r\nworth considering.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the program sent to Forrestal may well not have\r\nreflected the exact views of the Air Force secretary, nor conveyed all\r\nthat his principal manpower assistant intended. Actually, the concern\r\nexpressed by Air Force officials for military efficiency and by civil\r\nrights leaders for equal opportunity always centered specifically on\r\nthe problems of the black tactical air unit and related specialist\r\nbillets at Lockbourne Air Force Base. In fact, the need to solve the\r\npressing administrative problems of Colonel Davis's command provoked\r\nthe Air staff study that eventually evolved into the integration\r\nprogram. The program itself focused on this command and provided for\r\nthe integrated assignment of its members throughout the Air Force.\r\nOther black enlisted men, certainly those serving as laborers in the F\r\nSquadrons, scattered worldwide, did not pose a comparable manpower\r\nproblem. They were ignored on the theory that abolition of the quota,\r\nalong with the application of more stringent recruitment procedures,\r\nwould in time rid the services of its unskilled and unneeded men.\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that the purpose of the limited integration proposal\r\nwas not so much to devise a new policy as to minimize the impact of\r\nchange on congressional opponents. Edwards certainly hoped that his\r\nplan would placate senior commanders and staff officers who        (p. 342)\r\nopposed integration or feared the social upheaval they assumed would\r\nfollow the abolition of all black units. This explanation would\r\naccount for the cautious approach to racial mixing in the proposal,\r\nthe elaborate administrative safeguards against social confrontation,\r\nand the promised reduction in the number of black airmen. Some of\r\nthose pressing for the new program certainly considered the retention\r\nof segregated units a stopgap measure designed to prevent a too\r\nprecipitous reorganization of the service. As Lt. Col. Jack Marr, a\r\nmember of Edwards's staff and author of the staff's integration study,\r\nexplained to the Fahy Committee, \"we are trying to do our best not to\r\ntear the Air Force all apart and try to reorganize it overnight.\"[13-91]\r\nMarr predicted that as those eligible for reassignment were\r\ntransferred out of black units, the units themselves, bereft of\r\nessential personnel, would become inoperative and disappear one by\r\none.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 13-91: Testimony of Lt Col Jack F. Marr\r\n                   Before President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, 13\r\n                   Jan 49, afternoon session, p 46.]\r\n\r\nIn the end it must be admitted that race relations possess an inner\r\ndynamic, and it is impossible to relate the integration of the Air\r\nForce to any isolated decision by a secretary or proposal by a group\r\nfrom his military staff. The decision to integrate was the result of\r\nseveral disparate forces--the political interests of the\r\nadministration, the manpower needs of the Air Force, the aspirations\r\nof its black minority, and perhaps more than all the rest, the\r\nacceptance by its airmen of a different social system. Together, these\r\nfactors would make successive steps to full integration impossible to\r\nresist. Integration, then, was an evolutionary process, and\r\nSymington's acceptance of a limited integration plan was only one step\r\nin a continuing process that stretched from the Air staff's study of\r\nblack manpower in 1948 to the disappearance of the last black unit two\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14                                                         (p. 343)\r\n\r\nThe Fahy Committee Versus the Department of Defense\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven James Forrestal's sympathy for integration, considerable\r\ncooperation could be expected between members of his department and\r\nthe Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\nServices, better known as the Fahy Committee. In the wake of the\r\ncommittee's establishment, Forrestal proposed that the service\r\nsecretaries assign an assistant secretary to coordinate his\r\ndepartment's dealings with the group and a ranking black officer from\r\neach service be assigned to advise the assistant secretaries.[14-1] His\r\nown office promised to supply the committee with vital documentation,\r\nand his manpower experts offered to testify. The service secretaries\r\nagreed to follow suit.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-1: Memo, SecDef for SA et al., 21 Oct 48,\r\n                   copy in Fahy Committee file, CMH [hereafter cited\r\n                   as FC file]. The Center of Military History has\r\n                   retained an extensive collection of significant\r\n                   primary materials pertaining to the Fahy Committee\r\n                   and its dealings with the Department of Defense.\r\n                   While most of the original documents are in the\r\n                   Charles Fahy Papers and the Papers of the\r\n                   President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Services at the Harry S.\r\n                   Truman Library or in the National Archives, this\r\n                   study will cite the CMH collection when possible.]\r\n\r\nWilling to cooperate, Forrestal still wanted to chart his own course.\r\nBoth he and his successor, Louis A. Johnson, made it quite clear that\r\nas a senior cabinet officer the Secretary of Defense was accountable\r\nin all matters to the President alone. The Fahy Committee might report\r\non the department's racial practices and suggest changes, but the\r\ndevelopment of policy was his prerogative. Both men dealt directly\r\nwith the committee from time to time, but their directives to the\r\nservices on the formulation of race policy were developed\r\nindependently of the White House group.[14-2] Underscoring this\r\nindependent attitude, Marx Leva reminded the service secretaries that\r\nthe members of the Personnel Policy Board were to work with the\r\nrepresentatives of their respective staffs on racial matters. They\r\nwere not expected \"to assist Fahy.\"[14-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-2: Ltrs, James Forrestal to Fahy, 26 Mar\r\n                   49, and Louis Johnson to Fahy, 18 Apr 49; both in\r\n                   FC file.

His attempt to develop a new racial policy was probably in\r\npart an effort to forestall committee criticism and in part a wish to\r\ndraw up a policy that would satisfy the committee without really doing\r\nmuch to change things. After all, such a departmental attitude toward\r\ncommittees, both congressional and presidential, was fairly normal.\r\nFaced with the conflicting racial policies of the Air Force and Army,\r\nForrestal agreed to let the services present their separate        (p. 344)\r\nprograms to the Fahy Committee, but he wanted to develop a race policy\r\napplicable to all the services.[14-4] Some of his subordinates debated\r\nthe wisdom of this decision, arguing that the President had assigned\r\nthat task to the Fahy Committee, but they were overruled. Forrestal\r\nordered the newly created Personnel Policy Board to undertake,\r\nsimultaneously with the committee, a study of the department's racial\r\npolicy. The board was to concentrate on \"breaking down the problem,\"\r\nas Forrestal put it, into its component parts and trying to arrive\r\nquietly at areas of agreement on a uniform policy that could be held\r\nin readiness until the Fahy Committee made its report.[14-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-4: Min, War Council Mtg, 12 Jan 49,\r\n                   Office of OSD Historian; Memo, Secy of War Council\r\n                   for SA et al., 13 Jan 49, sub: Significant Action\r\n                   of the Special Meeting of the War Council on 12\r\n                   January 1949, OSD 291.2.

It seemed unlikely, for at\r\ntheir first meeting the board members agreed that any policy developed\r\nmust be \"satisfactory to the three services.\"[14-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-6: Forrestal signed an interim directive\r\n                   appointing members of the board on 22 February\r\n                   1949.

Reid and\r\nhis chief of staff, Army Brig. Gen. Charles T. Lanham, acted.[14-8] On 28\r\nFebruary they drafted a directive for the Secretary of Defense that\r\nwould abolish all racial quotas and establish uniform standards of\r\ninduction for service which in times of emergency would include\r\nprovisions for the apportionment of enlistees both qualitatively and\r\nquantitatively. Moreover, all black enlistees would be given the\r\nopportunity to serve as individuals in integrated units. The services\r\nwould be completely integrated by 1 July 1950. To ease the change,\r\nReid and Lanham would in the interim regulate the number of Negroes in\r\nintegrated units, allowing not less than four men and not more than 10\r\npercent in a company-size unit. Enlisted men could choose to serve\r\nunder officers of their own race.[14-9]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-8: Memo, Col J. F.

On 3 March Forrestal resigned, and\r\nalthough Leva hoped the directive could be issued before Forrestal's\r\nactual departure, \"in view of his long-standing interest in this\r\nfield,\" Forrestal was obviously reluctant to commit his successor  (p. 345)\r\nto so drastic a course.[14-10] With a final bow to his belief in\r\nservice autonomy, Forrestal asked Reid and Lanham to submit their\r\nproposal to the service secretaries for review.[14-11] The secretaries\r\napproved the idea of a unified policy in principle, but each had very\r\ndefinite and individual views on what that policy should contain and\r\nhow it should be carried out. Denied firm direction from the ailing\r\nForrestal, Reid and Lanham could do little against service opposition.\r\nTheir proposal was quietly tabled while the board continued its search\r\nfor an acceptable unified policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-10: Note, Leva thru Ohly to Buck Lanham,\r\n                   attached to Draft of Proposed Directive cited in n.\r\n                   9.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-11: Memo, Chmn, PPB, for John Ohly,\r\n                   Assistant to SecDef, 15 Mar 49; Revised Min, PPB\r\n                   Mtg, 18 Mar 49; both in FC file.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was just as well, for the Reid-Lanham draft had serious\r\ndefects. It failed to address the problems of qualitative imbalance in\r\nthe peacetime services, probably in deference to Forrestal's recent\r\nrejection of the Army's call for a fair distribution of high-scoring\r\nenlistees. While the proposal encouraged special training for Negroes,\r\nit also limited their assignment to a strict 10 percent quota in any\r\nunit. The result would have been an administrative nightmare, with\r\ntrained men in excess of the 10 percent quota assigned to other,\r\nnonspecialty duties. As one manpower expert later admitted, \"you ran\r\nthe real chance of haying black engineers and the like pushing\r\nwheelbarrows.\"[14-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-12: Interv, author with Roy K. Davenport,\r\n                   7 Oct 71, CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe service objections to a carefully spelled out policy were in\r\nthemselves quite convincing to Lanham and Reid. Reid agreed with\r\nEugene Zuckert, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, that \"probably\r\nthe most logical and soundest approach\" was for each service to\r\nprepare a policy statement and explain how it was being carried out.\r\nThe board could then prepare a general policy based on these\r\nstatements, and, with the approval of the Secretary of Defense, send\r\nit to the Fahy Committee in time for its report to the President.[14-13]\r\nBut if Zuckert's scheme was logical and sound, it also managed to\r\nreduce the secretary's status to final endorsement officer. Such a\r\nrole never appealed to James Forrestal, and would be even less\r\nacceptable to the politically energetic Louis Johnson, who succeeded\r\nForrestal as Secretary of Defense on 28 March 1949.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-13: Memo for Files, Clarence H.

All persons would be accorded equal\r\nopportunity for appointment, advancement, professional improvement,\r\nand retention, and although some segregated units would be retained,\r\n\"qualified\" Negroes would be assigned without regard to race. The\r\nsecretary ordered the services to reexamine their policies and submit\r\ndetailed plans for carrying out this directive.[14-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-14: Memo, Thomas Reid for Asst SecNav, 1\r\n                   Apr 49, sub: Statement on Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-15: PPB, Draft Memo, SecDef for Svc Secys\r\n                   (prepared by Col J.

They were concerned lest the\r\nservices treat it as an endorsement of their current policies. Reid\r\npointedly explained to their representatives on the Personnel Policy\r\nBoard that the service statements due by 1 May should not merely\r\nreiterate present practices, but should represent a \"sincere effort\"\r\nby the departments to move toward greater racial equality.[14-17] Service\r\nresponses, he warned, would be scrutinized to determine \"their\r\nadequacy in the light of the intent of the Secretary's policy.\" Reid\r\nlater admitted to Secretary Johnson that the directive was so broadly\r\nformed that it \"permits almost any practice under it.\"[14-18] He, Lanham,\r\nand others agreed that since its contents were bound to reach the\r\npress anyway, the policy should be publicized in a way that played\r\ndown generalizations and emphasized the responsibilities it imposed\r\nfor new directions. Johnson agreed, and the announcement of his\r\ndirective, emphasizing the importance of new service programs and\r\nsetting a deadline for their submission, was widely circulated.[14-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-17: Min, PPB Mtg, 8 Apr 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-18: Memo, Reid for SecDef, 14 Apr 49,\r\n                   sub: The President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-19: Min, PPB Mtg, 5 May 49; NME Press\r\n                   Release 3-49A, 20 Apr 49; both in FC file.]\r\n\r\nThe directive reflected Louis Johnson's personality, ambition, and\r\nadministrative strategy. If many of his associates questioned his\r\npersonal commitment to the principle of integration, or indeed even\r\nhis private feeling about President Truman's order, all recognized his\r\npolitical ambition and penchant for vigorous and direct action.[14-20]\r\nThe secretary would recognize the political implications of the\r\nexecutive order just as he would want to exercise personal control\r\nover integration, an issue fraught with political uncertainties that\r\nan independent presidential committee would only multiply. A dramatic\r\npublic statement might well serve Johnson's needs. By creating at\r\nleast the illusion of forward motion in the field of race relations, a\r\ndirective issued by the Secretary of Defense might neutralize the Fahy\r\nCommittee as an independent force, protecting the services from\r\noutside interference while enhancing Johnson's position in the White\r\nHouse and with the press. A \"blustering bully,\" one of Fahy's\r\nassistants later called Johnson, whose directive was designed, he\r\ncharged, to put the Fahy Committee out of business.[14-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-20: This conclusion is based on\r\n                   Interviews, author with Charles Fahy, 8 Feb 68,\r\n                   James C.

(p. 347)\r\nAnnouncing his directive to the press transformed what could have been\r\nan innocuous, private reaffirmation of the department's pledge of\r\nequal treatment and opportunity into a public exercise in military\r\npolicymaking. The Secretary of Defense in effect committed himself to\r\na public review of the services' racial practices. In this sense the\r\nresponses he elicited from the Army and Navy were a disappointment.\r\nBoth services contented themselves with an outline of their current\r\npolicies and ignored the secretary's request for future plans. The\r\nArmy offered statistics to prove that its present program guaranteed\r\nequal opportunity, while the Navy concluded that its practices and\r\nprocedures revealed \"no inconsistencies\" with the policy prescribed by\r\nthe Secretary of Defense.[14-22] Summing up his reaction to these\r\nresponses for the Personnel Policy Board, Reid said that the Army had\r\na poor policy satisfactorily administered, while the Navy had an\r\nacceptable policy poorly administered. Neither service complied \"with\r\nthe spirit or letter of the request.\"[14-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-22: Memo, Actg SecNav for Chmn, PPB, 2\r\n                   May 49, sub: Equality of Treatment and Opportunity\r\n                   in the Navy and Marine Corps; Memo, SA for SecDef,\r\n                   21 Apr 49, sub: Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Services; both in FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-23: Min, PPB Mtg, 5 May 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JOHNSON.]\r\n\r\nNot all the board members agreed. In the wake of the Army and Navy\r\nreplies, some saw the possible need for separate service policies\r\nrather than a common policy; considering the many advances enumerated\r\nin the replies, one member even suggested that Johnson might achieve\r\nmore by getting the services to prosecute their current policies\r\nvigorously. Although Chairman Reid promised that these suggestions\r\nwould all be taken into consideration, he still hoped to use the Air\r\nForce response to pry further concessions out of the Army and\r\nNavy.[14-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-24: Ibid.; see also Ltr, Thomas Reid to\r\n                   Richard Dalfiume, 1 Apr 65, Incl to Ltr, Reid to\r\n                   author, 15 Jan 71.

Disregarding the views of some board members, he\r\nsuggested that Johnson reject the Army and Navy answers and, without\r\nindicating the form he thought their answers should take, order them\r\nto prepare new proposals.[14-28] Johnson would also have to ignore a\r\nwarning from Secretary of the Army Royall, who had recently reminded\r\nhim that Forrestal had assured Congress during the selective service\r\nhearings that the administration would not issue a preemptory order\r\ncompletely abolishing segregation. \"I have no reason to believe that\r\nthe President had changed his mind,\" Royall continued, \"but I think\r\nyou should be advised of these circumstances because if any action\r\nwere later taken by you or other authority to abolish segregation in\r\nthe Army I am confident that these Southern senators would remember\r\nthis incident.\"[14-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-28: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-29: Memo, SA for SecDef, 22 Apr 49, OSA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nDespite Royall's not so subtle warning, Reid's scheme worked. The\r\nSecretary of Defense explicitly and publicly approved the Air Force\r\nprogram and rejected those of the Army and Navy. Johnson told the\r\nArmy, for example, that he was pleased with the progress made in the\r\npast few years, but he saw \"that much remains to be done and that the\r\nrate of progress toward the objectives of the Executive Order must be\r\naccelerated.\"[14-30] He gave the recalcitrants until 25 May to submit\r\n\"specific additional actions which you propose to take.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-30: Memo, SecDef for SA, 13 May 49, sub:\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Forces; idem for SecAF and SecNav, 11 May 49, same\r\n                   sub; DOD Press Release 35-49A, 11 May 42.

The considerable attention paid by senior officials of the\r\nDepartment of Defense to racial matters in the spring of 1949 could be\r\nattributed in part to the commonly held belief that the Fahy Committee\r\nplanned an integration crusade, using the power of the White House to\r\ntransform the services' racial policies in a profound and dramatic\r\nway. Indeed, some members of the committee itself demanded that the\r\nchairman \"lay down the law to the services.\"[14-31] But this approach,\r\nCharles Fahy decided, ignored both the personalities of the        (p. 349)\r\nparticipants and the realities of the situation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-31: Interv, author with Fahy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAHY COMMITTEE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMAN AND ARMED SERVICES\r\nSECRETARIES. _Seated with the President are Secretary Forrestal and\r\nCommitteeman A.

Palmer; Secretary\r\nSullivan; and Charles Fahy._]\r\n\r\nThe armed forces had just won a great world war, and the opinions of\r\nthe military commanders, Fahy reasoned, would carry much weight with\r\nthe American public. In any conflict between the committee and the\r\nservices, Fahy believed that public opinion would be likely to side\r\nwith the military. He wanted the committee to issue no directive.\r\nInstead, as he reported to the President, the committee would seek the\r\nconfidence and help of the armed services in working out changes in\r\nmanpower practices to achieve Truman's objectives.[14-32] It was\r\nimportant to Fahy that the committee not make the mistake of telling\r\nthe services what should be done and then have to drop the matter with\r\nno assurances that anything would be done. He was determined, rather,\r\nto obtain not only a change in policy, but also a \"program in being\"\r\nduring the life of the committee. To achieve this change the group\r\nwould have to convince the Army and the other services of the need for\r\nand justice of integration. To do less, to settle for the issuance of\r\nan integration directive alone, would leave the services the       (p. 350)\r\noption of later disregarding the reforms on the grounds of national\r\nsecurity or for other reasons. Fahy explained to the President that\r\nall this would take time.[14-33] \"Take all the time you need,\" Truman\r\ntold his committee.[14-34] This the committee proceeded to do, gathering\r\nthousands of pages of testimony, while its staff under the direction\r\nof Executive Secretary Edwin W. Kenworthy toured military\r\ninstallations, analyzed the existing programs and operations of the\r\nthree services, and perused the reams of pertinent historical\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-32: Ibid.; see also Fahy Cmte, \"A\r\n                   Progress Report for the President,\" 7 Jun 49, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-33: Memo, Fahy for Brig Gen James L.\r\n                   Collins, Jr. 16 Aug 76, CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-34: Interv, author with Fahy.]\r\n\r\nThat the committee expected the Secretary of Defense to take the lead\r\nin racial affairs, refraining from dictating policy itself, did not\r\nmean that Fahy and his associates lacked a definite point of view.\r\nFrom the first, Fahy understood Truman's executive order to mean\r\nunequivocally that the services would have to abandon segregation, an\r\ninterpretation reinforced in a later discussion he had with the\r\nPresident.[14-35] The purpose of the committee, in Fahy's view, was not\r\nto impose integration on the services, but to convince them of the\r\nmerits of the President's order and to agree with them on a plan to\r\nmake it effective.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-35: Interv, Blumenson with Fahy, 7 Apr\r\n                   66; Interv, author with Davenport, 31 Oct 71; both\r\n                   in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe trouble, the committee quickly learned, lay in trying to convince\r\nthe Army of the practical necessity for integration. On one hand the\r\nArmy readily admitted that there were some advantages in spreading\r\nblack soldiers through the white ranks. \"It might remove any false\r\ncharges that equal opportunities are not provided,\" General Bradley\r\ntestified. \"It would simplify administration and the use of manpower,\r\nand it would distribute our losses in battle more nearly in proportion\r\nto the percentage of the two races.\"[14-36] But then the Army had so\r\ncarefully and often repeated the disadvantages of integration that\r\nBradley and others could very easily offer a logical and\r\nwell-rehearsed apology for continuing the Army's current policy. Army\r\nofficials repeatedly testified, for example, that their situation\r\nfundamentally differed from those of the other two services. The Army\r\nhad a much higher proportion of Negroes in its ranks, 10 to 11 percent\r\nduring the period of the committee's life, and in addition was\r\nrequired by law to accept by the thousands recruits, many of them\r\nblack, whose aptitude or education would automatically disqualify them\r\nfor the Air Force or Navy. Armed with these inequities, the Army\r\nremained impervious to the claims of the Navy and Air Force, defending\r\nits time-honored charge that segregation was necessary to preserve the\r\nefficiency of its combat forces. In Zuckert's opinion, the Army was\r\ntrying to maintain the _status quo_ at any cost.[14-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-36: Testimony of General Omar N. Bradley,\r\n                   Fahy Cmte Hearings, 28 Mar 49, afternoon session,\r\n                   p. 71.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-37: Memo, Asst SecAF for Symington, 11\r\n                   Apr 49, sub: Statement of the Secretary of the Army\r\n                   Before the President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services--March 28, 1949, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThe Army offered other reasons. Its leaders testified that the\r\nunlimited induction of Negroes into an integrated Army would seriously\r\naffect enlistments and the morale of troops. Morale in particular\r\naffected battle efficiency. Again General Bradley testified.\r\n\r\n     I consider that a unit has high morale when the men have      (p. 351)\r\n     confidence in themselves, confidence in their fellow members of\r\n     their unit, and confidence in their leaders. If we try to force\r\n     integration on the Army before the country is ready to accept\r\n     these customs, we may have difficulty attaining high morale along\r\n     the lines I have mentioned.[14-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-38: Testimony of Bradley, Fahy Cmte\r\n                   Hearings, 28 Mar 49, afternoon session, pp. 71-72.]\r\n\r\nUnderlying all these discussions of morale and efficiency lurked a\r\ndeep-seated suspicion of the combat reliability and effectiveness of\r\nblack troops and the fear that many white soldiers would refuse to\r\nserve with blacks. Many Army leaders were convinced that the\r\nperformance of black troops in the past two wars did not qualify\r\nNegroes for a role in the Army's current mission, the execution of\r\nfield operations in relatively small groups. These reservations were\r\nexpressed frequently in Army testimony. Bradley, in defense of\r\nsegregation, for example, cited the performance of the 92d Division.\r\nWhen asked whether a 15 percent black Army would reduce efficiency, he\r\nsaid, \"from our experience in the past I think the time might come\r\nwhen it wouldn't, but the average educational standards of these men\r\nwould not be up to the average of the white soldier. In modern combat\r\na man is thrown very much on his own initiative.\"[14-39] This attitude\r\nwas closely related to the Army's estimates of white morale: white\r\nsoldiers, the argument ran, especially many among those southerners\r\nwho comprised an unusually high proportion of the Army's strength,\r\nwould not accept integration. Many white men would refuse to take\r\norders from black superiors, and the mutual dependence of individual\r\nsoldiers and small units in combat would break down when the races\r\nwere mingled.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-39: Ibid., p. 83.]\r\n\r\nAlthough these beliefs were highly debatable, they were tenaciously\r\nheld by many senior officials and were often couched in terms that\r\nwere extremely difficult to refute. For instance, Royall summed up the\r\nargument on morale: \"I am reluctant--and I am sure all sincere\r\ncitizens will be reluctant--to force a pace faster than is consistent\r\nwith the efficiency and morale of the Army--or to follow a course\r\ninconsistent with the ability of the Army, in the event of war, to\r\ntake the battlefield with reasonable assurance of success.\"[14-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-40: Testimony of the Secretary of the\r\n                   Army, Fahy Cmte Hearings, 28 Mar 49, morning\r\n                   session, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nBut in time the Fahy Committee found a way, first suggested by its\r\nexecutive secretary, to turn the efficiency argument around. Certainly\r\na most resourceful and imaginative man, Kenworthy had no doubt about\r\nthe immorality of segregation, but he also understood, as he later\r\ntold the Secretary of the Army, that whatever might be morally\r\nundeniable in the abstract, military efficiency had to govern in\r\nmatters of military policy. His study of the record and his\r\ninvestigation of existing service conditions convinced him that\r\nsegregation actually impeded military efficiency. Convinced from the\r\nstart that appeals to morality would be a waste of time, Kenworthy\r\npressed the committee members to tackle the services on their own\r\nground--efficiency.[14-41] After seeing the Army so effectively dismiss\r\nin the name of military efficiency and national security the moral\r\narguments against segregation as being valid but irrelevant, Kenworthy\r\nasked Chairman Fahy:\r\n\r\n     I wonder if the one chance of getting something done isn't    (p. 352)\r\n     to meet the military on their own ground--the question of\r\n     military efficiency. They have defended their Negro manpower\r\n     policies on the grounds of efficiency. Have they used Negro\r\n     manpower efficiently?... Can it be that the whole policy of\r\n     segregation, especially in large units like the 92nd and 93rd\r\n     Division, ADVERSELY AFFECTS MORALE AND EFFICIENCY?[14-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-41: Ltr, Kenworthy to SA, 20 Jul 50, FC\r\n                   file; see also Memo, Kenworthy for Chief of\r\n                   Military History, 13 Oct 76, CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-42: Ltr, Kenworthy to Fahy, 10 Mar 49, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\nThe committee did not have to convince the Navy or the Air Force of\r\nthe practical necessity for integration. With four years of experience\r\nin integrating its ships and stations, the Navy did not bother arguing\r\nthe merits of integration with the committee, but instead focused its\r\nattention on black percentages and the perennial problem of the\r\nlargely black Steward's Branch. Specifically, naval officials\r\ntestified that integration increased the Navy's combat efficiency.\r\nSpeaking for the Air Force, Symington told the committee that \"in our\r\nposition we believe that non-segregation will improve our efficiency\r\nin at least some instances\" and consequently \"it's simply been a case\r\n[of] how we are going to do it, not whether we are going to do it.\"\r\nConvinced of the simple justice of integration, Symington also told\r\nthe committee: \"You've got to clear up that basic problem in your\r\nheart before you can really get to this subject. Both Zuckert and\r\nEdwards feel right on the basic problem.\"[14-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-43: Testimony of the Secretary of the Air\r\n                   Force, Fahy Cmte Hearings, 28 Mar 49, afternoon\r\n                   session, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nEven while the Air Force and the Navy were assuring Fahy of their\r\nbelief in the efficiency of integration, they hastened to protect\r\nthemselves against a change of heart. General Edwards gave the\r\ncommittee a caveat on integration: \"if it comes to a matter of\r\nlessening the efficiency of the Air Force so it can't go to war and do\r\na good job, there isn't any question that the policy of\r\nnon-segregation will have to go by the boards. In a case like that,\r\nI'd be one of the first to recommend it.\"[14-44] Secretary of the Navy\r\nSullivan also supported this view and cautioned the committee against\r\nmaking too much of the differences in the services' approach to racial\r\nreforms. Each service, he suggested, should be allowed to work out a\r\nprogram that would stand the test of war. \"If war comes and we go back\r\n[to segregation], then we have taken a very long step in the wrong\r\ndirection.\" He wanted the committee to look to the \"substance of the\r\nadvance rather than to the apparent progress.\"[14-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-44: Fahy Cmte Hearings, 28 Mar 49,\r\n                   afternoon session, pp. 28-29.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-45: Ibid., p. 29.]\r\n\r\nKenworthy predicted that attacking the Army's theory of military\r\nefficiency would require considerable research by the committee into\r\nArmy policy as well as the past performance of black units. Ironically\r\nenough, he got the necessary evidence from the Army itself, in the\r\nperson of Roy K. Davenport.[14-46] Davenport's education at Fisk and\r\nColumbia universities had prepared him for the scholar's life, but\r\nPearl Harbor changed all that, and Davenport eventually landed behind\r\na desk in the office that managed the Army's manpower affairs. One of\r\nthe first black professionals to break through the armed forces racial\r\nbarrier, Davenport was not a \"Negro specialist\" and did not wish to be\r\none. Nor could he, an experienced government bureaucrat, be blamed if\r\nhe saw in the Fahy Committee yet one more well-meaning attempt by (p. 353)\r\nan outside group to reform the Army. Only when Kenworthy convinced him\r\nthat this committee was serious about achieving change did Davenport\r\nproceed to explain in great detail how segregation limited the\r\navailability of military occupational specialties, schooling, and\r\nassignments for Negroes.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-46: Intervs, Blumenson with Fahy, and\r\n                   author with Fahy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. W. KENWORTHY.]\r\n\r\nKenworthy decided that the time had come for Fahy to meet Davenport,\r\nparticularly since the chairman was inclined to be impressed with, and\r\noptimistic over, the Army's response to Johnson's directive of 6 April\r\n1949. Fahy, Kenworthy knew, was unfamiliar with military language and\r\nthe fine art practiced by military staffs of stating a purpose in\r\ntechnical jargon that would permit various interpretations. There was\r\nno fanfare, no dramatic scene. Kenworthy simply invited Fahy and\r\nDavenport, along with the black officers assigned by the services to\r\nassist the committee, to meet informally at his home one evening in\r\nApril.[14-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-47: This incident is described in detail\r\n                   in Interviews, author with Fahy; Davenport, 17 Oct\r\n                   71; and E. W. Kenworthy (by telephone), 1 Dec 71.\r\n                   See also Interv, Nichols with Davenport, in Nichols\r\n                   Collection. All in CMH.]\r\n\r\nNever one to waste time, Fahy summarized the committee's activities\r\nthus far, outlined its dealings with Army witnesses, and then handed\r\nout copies of the Army's response to Secretary Johnson's directive.\r\nFahy was inclined to recommend approval, a course agreed to by the\r\nblack officers present, but he nevertheless turned courteously to the\r\npersonnel expert from the Department of the Army and asked him for his\r\nopinion of the official Army position. Davenport did not hesitate.\r\n\"The directive [the Army's response to Secretary Johnson's 6 April\r\ndirective] isn't worth the paper it's written on,\" he answered. It\r\ncalled for sweeping changes in the administration of the Army's\r\ntraining programs, he explained, but would produce no change because\r\npersonnel specialists at the training centers would quickly discover\r\nthat their existing procedures, which excluded so many qualified black\r\nsoldiers, would fit quite comfortably under the document's idealistic\r\nbut vague language. The Army's response, Davenport declared, had been\r\nvery carefully drawn up to retain segregation rather than to end it.\r\n\r\nChairman Fahy seemed annoyed by this declaration. After all, he had\r\nlistened intently to the Army's claims and promises and was inclined\r\nto accept the Army's proposal as a slow, perhaps, but certain way to\r\nbring about racial integration. He was, however, a tough-minded\r\nman and was greatly impressed by the analysis of the situation     (p. 354)\r\npresented by the Army employee. When Davenport asked him to reexamine\r\nthe directive with eyes open to the possibility of deceit, Fahy walked\r\nto a corner of the room and reread the Army's statement in the light\r\nof Davenport's charges. Witnesses would later remember the flush of\r\nanger that came to his face as he read. His committee was going to\r\nhave to hear more from Davenport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES FAHY _(a later portrait)_.]\r\n\r\nIf efficiency was to be the keynote of the committee's investigation,\r\nDavenport explained, it would be a simple thing to prove that the Army\r\nwas acting inefficiently. In a morning of complex testimony replete\r\nwith statistical analysis of the Army's manpower management, he and\r\nMaj. James D. Fowler, a black West Point graduate and personnel\r\nofficer, provided the committee with the needed breakthrough. Step by\r\nstep they led Fahy and his associates through the complex workings of\r\nthe Army's career guidance program, showing them how segregation\r\ncaused the inefficient use of manpower on several counts.[14-48] The\r\nArmy, for example, as part of a continuing effort to find men who\r\n_could_ be trained for specialties in which it had a shortage of men,\r\npublished a monthly list, the so-called \"40 Report,\" of its authorized\r\nand actual strength in each of its 490 military occupational\r\nspecialties. Each of these specialties was further broken down by\r\nrace. The committee learned that no authorization existed at all for\r\nNegroes in 198 of these specialties, despite the fact that in many of\r\nthem the Army was under its authorized strength. Furthermore, for many\r\nof the specialties in which there were no authorizations for Negroes\r\nno great skill was needed. In short, it was the policy of segregated\r\nservice that allowed the Army, which had thousands of jobs unfilled\r\nfor lack of trained specialists, to continue to deny training and\r\nassignment to thousands of Negroes whose aptitude test scores showed\r\nthem at least minimally suited for those jobs. How could the Army\r\nclaim that it was operating efficiently when a shortage existed and\r\npotentially capable persons were being ignored?\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-48: Fahy Cmte Hearings, 28 Apr 49,\r\n                   morning session.]\r\n\r\nOne question led to another. If there were no authorizations for black\r\nsoldiers in 198 specialties, what were the chances for qualified\r\nNegroes to attend schools that trained men for these specialties? It\r\nturned out that of the 106 school courses available after a man\r\nfinished basic training, only twenty-one were open to Negroes. That\r\nis, 81 percent of the courses offered by the Army were closed to\r\nNegroes. The Army denied that discrimination was involved. Since   (p. 355)\r\nexisting black units could not use the full range of the Army's\r\nmilitary occupational specialties, went the official line of\r\nreasoning, it would be wasteful and inefficient to train men for\r\nnonexistent jobs in those units. It followed that the Organization and\r\nTraining Division must exclude many Negroes from being classified in\r\nspecialties for which they were qualified and from Army schools that\r\nwould train others for such unneeded specialties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROY DAVENPORT.]\r\n\r\nThis reasoning was in the interest of segregation, not efficiency, and\r\nDavenport and others were able to prove to the committee's\r\nsatisfaction that the Army's segregation policy could be defended\r\nneither in terms of manpower efficiency nor common fairness. With\r\nDavenport and Fowler's testimony, Charles Fahy later explained, he\r\nbegan to \"see light for a solution.\"[14-49] He began to see how he would\r\nprobably be able to gain the committee's double objective: the\r\nannouncement of an integration policy for the Army and the\r\nestablishment of a practical program that would immediately begin\r\nmoving the Army from segregation to integration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-49: Interv, Nichols with Fahy, in Nichols\r\n                   Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, military efficiency was a potent weapon which, if skillfully\r\nhandled, might well force the Army into important concessions leading\r\nto integration. Taking its cue from Davenport and Fowler, the\r\ncommittee would contend that, as the increasing complexity of war had\r\ncreated a demand for skilled manpower, the country could ill-afford to\r\nuse any of its soldiers below their full capacity or fail to train\r\nthem adequately. With a logic understandable to President and public\r\nalike, the committee could later state that since maximum military\r\nefficiency demanded that all servicemen be given an equal opportunity\r\nto discover and exploit their talents, an indivisible link existed\r\nbetween military efficiency and equal opportunity.[14-50] Thus equal\r\nopportunity in the name of military efficiency became one of the\r\ncommittee's basic premises; until the end of its existence the\r\ncommittee hammered away at this premise.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-50: Fahy Cmte, \"Second Interim Report to\r\n                   the President,\" 27 Jul 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\nWhile the committee's logic was unassailable when applied to the\r\nplight of a relatively small number of talented and qualified black\r\nsoldiers, a different solution would have to prevail when the far\r\nlarger number of Negroes ineligible for Army schooling either by\r\ntalent, inclination, or previous education was considered. Here the\r\nArmy's plea for continued segregation in the name of military efficiency\r\ncarried some weight. How could it, the Army asked, endanger the\r\nmorale and efficiency of its fighting forces by integrating these  (p. 356)\r\nmen? How could it, with its low enlistment standards, abandon its\r\nracial quota and risk enlarging the already burdensome concentration\r\nof \"professional black privates?\" The committee admitted the justice\r\nof the Army's claim that the higher enlistment score required by the\r\nNavy and Air Force resulted in the Army's getting more than its share\r\nof men in the low-test categories IV and V. And while Kenworthy\r\nbelieved that immediate integration was less likely to cause serious\r\ntrouble than the Army's announced plan of mixing the races in\r\nprogressively smaller units, he too accepted the argument that it\r\nwould be dangerous to reassign the Army's group of professional black\r\nprivates to white units. Fahy saw the virtue of the Army's position\r\nhere; his committee never demanded the immediate, total integration of\r\nthe Army.\r\n\r\nOne solution to the problem, reducing the number of soldiers with low\r\naptitude by forcing the other services to share equally in the burden\r\nof training and assimilating the less gifted and often black enlistee\r\nand draftee, had recently been rejected by the Navy and Air Force, a\r\nrejection endorsed by Secretary of Defense Forrestal. Even in the\r\nevent that the Army could raise its enlistment standards and the other\r\nservices be induced to lower theirs, much time would elapse before the\r\nconcentration of undereducated Negroes could be broken up. Davenport\r\nwas aware of all this when he limited his own recommendations to the\r\ncommittee to matters concerning the integration of black specialists,\r\nthe opening of all Army schools to Negroes, and the establishment of\r\nsome system to monitor the Army's implementation of these reforms.[14-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-51: Interv, author with Davenport, 31 Oct\r\n                   71.]\r\n\r\nHaving gained some experience, the committee was now able to turn the\r\nArmy's efficiency argument against the racial quota. It decided that\r\nthe quota had helped defeat the Gillem Board's aim of using Negroes on\r\na broad professional scale. It pointed out that, when forced by\r\nmanpower needs and the selective service law to set a lower enlistment\r\nstandard, the Army had allowed its black quota to be filled to a great\r\nextent by professional privates and denied to qualified black men, who\r\ncould be used on a broad professional scale, the chance to enlist.[14-52]\r\nIt was in the name of military efficiency, therefore, that the\r\ncommittee adopted a corollary to its demand for equal opportunity in\r\nspecialist training and assignment: the racial quota must be abandoned\r\nin favor of a quota based on aptitude.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-52: Fahy Cmte, \"Initial Recommendations\r\n                   by the President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services,\"\r\n                   attached to Fahy Cmte, \"A Progress Report for the\r\n                   President\", 7 Jun 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\nFahy was not sure, he later admitted, how best to proceed at this\r\npoint with the efficiency issue, but his committee obviously had to\r\ncome up with some kind of program if only to preserve its\r\nadministrative independence in the wake of Secretary Johnson's\r\ndirective. As Kenworthy pointed out, short of demanding the\r\nelimination of all segregated units, there was little the committee\r\ncould do that went beyond Johnson's statement.[14-53] Fahy, at least, was\r\nnot prepared to settle for that. His solution, harmonizing with his\r\nbelief in the efficacy of long-range practical change and his estimate\r\nof the committee's strength vis-a-vis the services' strength, was  (p. 357)\r\nto prepare a \"list of suggestions to guide the Army and Navy in its\r\n[_sic_] determinations.\"[14-54] The suggestions, often referred to by\r\nthe committee as its \"Initial Recommendations,\" would in the fullness\r\nof time, Fahy thought, effect substantial reforms in the way the Negro\r\nwas employed by the services.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-53: Ltr, Kenworthy to Fahy, 5 May 49,\r\n                   Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-54: Fahy Cmte, \"A Progress Report for the\r\n                   President,\" 7 Jun 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\nThe committee's recommendations, sent to the Personnel Policy Board in\r\nlate May 1949, are easily summarized.[14-55] Questioning why the Navy's\r\npolicy, \"so progressive on its face,\" had attracted so few Negroes\r\ninto the general service, the committee suggested that Negroes\r\nremembered the Navy's old habit of restricting them to servant duties.\r\nIt wanted the Navy to aim a vigorous recruitment program at the black\r\ncommunity in order to counteract this lingering suspicion. At the same\r\ntime the committee wanted the Navy to make a greater effort among\r\nblack high school students to attract qualified Negroes into the Naval\r\nReserve Officers' Training Corps program. To reinforce these campaigns\r\nand to remove one more vestige of racial inequality in naval service,\r\nthe committee also suggested that the Navy give to chief stewards all\r\nthe perquisites of chief petty officers. The lack of this rating, in\r\nparticular, had continued to cast doubt on the Navy's professed\r\npolicy, the committee charged. \"There is no reason, except custom, why\r\nthe chief steward should not be a chief petty officer, and that custom\r\nseems hardly worth the suspicion it evokes.\" Finally, the committee\r\nwanted the Navy to adopt the same entry standards as the Army. It\r\nrejected the Navy's claim that men who scored below ninety were\r\nunusable in the general service and called for an analysis by outside\r\nexperts to determine what jobs in the Navy could be performed by men\r\nwho scored between seventy and ninety. At the same time the committee\r\nreiterated that it did not intend the Navy or any of the services to\r\nlower the qualifications for their highly skilled positions.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-55: Min, War Council Mtg, 24 May 49; Fahy\r\n                   Cmte, \"Initial Recommendations by the President's\r\n                   Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity\r\n                   in the Armed Services,\" attached to Fahy Cmte, \"A\r\n                   Progress Report for the President\", 7 Jun 49, FC\r\n                   file.

Commenting\r\nthat the Air Force had apparently been able to use efficiently\r\nthousands of men with test scores below ninety in the past, the\r\ncommittee doubted that the contemporary differential in Air Force and\r\nArmy standards was justified. With a bow to Secretary Symington's new\r\nand limited integration policy, the committee deferred further\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nIt showed no such reluctance when it came to the Army. It wanted the\r\nArmy to abolish racial considerations in the designation of military\r\noccupational specialties, attendance at its schools, and use of its\r\nschool graduates in their military specialties. In line with the\r\nestablishment of a parity of enlistment standards among the services,\r\nthe committee wanted the Army to abandon its racial quotas. The\r\ncommittee did not insist on an immediate end to segregation in the\r\nArmy, believing that no matter how desirable, such a drastic change\r\ncould not be accomplished, as Davenport had warned, without very   (p. 358)\r\nserious administrative confusion. Besides, there were other pragmatic\r\nreasons for adopting the gradualist approach. For the committee to\r\ndemand immediate and complete integration would risk an outcry from\r\nCapitol Hill that might endanger the whole reform program. Gradual\r\nchange, on the other hand, would allow time for qualified Negroes to\r\nattend school courses, and the concept that Negroes had a right to\r\nequal educational opportunities was one that was very hard for the\r\nsegregationists to attack, given the American belief in education and\r\nthe right of every child to its benefits.[14-56] If the Army could be\r\npersuaded to adopt these recommendations, the committee reasoned, the\r\nArmy itself would gradually abolish segregation. The committee's\r\nformula for equality of treatment and opportunity in the Army,\r\ntherefore, was simple and straightforward, but each of its parts had\r\nto be accepted to achieve the whole.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-56: Memo, Kenworthy for Chief of Military\r\n                   History, 13 Oct 76, CMH.]\r\n\r\nAs it was, the committee's program for gradual change proved to be a\r\nrather large dose for senior service officials. An Army representative\r\non the Personnel Policy Board staff characterized the committee's work\r\nas \"presumptuous,\" \"subjective,\" and \"argumentative.\" He also charged\r\nthe committee with failing to interpret the executive order and thus\r\nleaving unclear whether the President wanted across-the-board\r\nintegration, and if so how soon.[14-57] The Personnel Policy Board\r\nignored these larger questions when it considered the subject on 26\r\nMay, focusing its opposition instead on two of the committee's\r\nrecommendations. It wanted Secretary Johnson to make \"a strong\r\nrepresentation\" to Fahy against the suggestion that there be a parity\r\nof scores for enlistment in the services. The board also unanimously\r\nopposed the committee's suggestion that the Army send all qualified\r\nNegroes to specialty schools within eighteen months of enlistment,\r\narguing that such a policy would be administratively impossible to\r\nenforce and would discriminate against white servicemen.[14-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-57: Col J.

He admitted that the whole question of parity of entrance\r\nstandards was highly controversial. He recognized the justice in\r\nestablishing universal standards for enlistment through selective\r\nservice, but at the same time he believed it unfair to ask any service\r\nto accept volunteers of lesser quality than it could obtain through\r\ngood enlistment and recruitment methods. He wanted Johnson to\r\nconcentrate his attack on the parity question.[14-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-59: Memo, Reid for Under SecDef, 23 May\r\n                   49, sub: Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in\r\n                   the Armed Services; idem for SecDef, 1 Jun 49, sub:\r\n                   Fahy Committee Initial Recommendations--Discussion\r\n                   With Members of the Fahy Committee; both in PPB\r\n                   files.

Surprisingly, the services provided a measure\r\nof support for the Fahy Committee. For its part, the Navy was under\r\nparticular pressure to develop an acceptable program. It, after all,\r\nhad been the first to announce a general integration policy for which\r\nit had, over the years, garnered considerable praise. But now it   (p. 359)\r\nwas losing this psychological advantage under steady and persistent\r\ncriticism from civil rights leaders, the President's committee, and,\r\nfinally, the Secretary of Defense himself. Proud of its racial policy\r\nand accustomed to the rapport it had always enjoyed with Forrestal,\r\nthe Navy was suddenly confronted with a new Secretary of Defense who\r\nbluntly noted its \"lack of any response\" to his 6 April directive,\r\nthus putting the Navy in the same league as the Army.\r\n\r\nSecretary Johnson's rejection of the Navy's response made a\r\nreexamination of its race program imperative, but it was still\r\nreluctant to follow the Fahy Committee's proposals completely.\r\nAlthough the personnel bureau had already planned special recruitment\r\nprograms, as well as a survey of all jobs in the Navy and the mental\r\nrequirements for each, the idea of making chief petty officers out of\r\nchief stewards caused \"great anger and resentment in the upper reaches\r\nof BuPers,\" Capt. Fred Stickney of the bureau admitted to a\r\nrepresentative of the committee. Stickney was confident that the\r\nbureau's opposition to this change could be surmounted, but he was not\r\nso sure that the Navy would surrender on the issue of equality of\r\nenlistment standards. The committee's arguments to the contrary, the\r\nNavy remained convinced that standardizing entrance requirements for\r\nall the services would mean \"lowering the calibre of men taken into\r\nthe Navy.\"[14-60]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-60: Ltr, Kenworthy to Fahy, 24 May 49, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\nBut even here the Navy proved unexpectedly conciliatory. Replying to\r\nthe Secretary of Defense a second time on 23 May, Acting Secretary Dan\r\nKimball committed the Navy to a program that incorporated to a great\r\nextent the recommendations of the Fahy Committee, including raising\r\nthe status of chief stewards and integrating recruit training in the\r\nMarine Corps. While he did not agree with the committee's proposal for\r\nequality of enlistment standards, Kimball broke the solid opposition\r\nto the committee's recommendation on this subject by promising to\r\nstudy the issue to determine where men who scored less than forty-five\r\n(the equivalent of General Classification Test score ninety) could be\r\nused without detriment to the Navy.[14-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-61: Memo, Actg SecNav for SecDef, 23 May\r\n                   49, sub: Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in\r\n                   the Armed Forces, FC file.]\r\n\r\nThe question of parity of enlistment standards aside, the Navy's\r\nprogram generally followed the suggestions of the Fahy Committee, and\r\nChairman Reid urged Johnson to accept it.[14-62] The secretary's\r\nacceptance was announced on 7 June and was widely reported in the\r\npress.[14-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-62: Draft Memo, Reid for SecNav, 3 Jun\r\n                   49, and Memo, Reid for SecDef, 1 Jun 49, both in\r\n                   PPB files; Memo, Kenworthy for Fahy, 30 May 49,\r\n                   sub: Replies of Army and Navy to Mr. Johnson's May\r\n                   11 Memo, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-63: NME, Off of Pub Info, Release 78-49A,\r\n                   7 Jun 49. See Washington _Post_, June 7, 1949, and\r\n                   New York _Times_, June 8, 1949.]\r\n\r\nTo some extent the Army had an advantage over the Navy in its dealings\r\nwith Johnson and Fahy. It never had an integration policy to defend,\r\nhad in fact consistently opposed the imposition of one, and was not,\r\ntherefore, under the same psychological pressures to react positively\r\nto the secretary's latest rebuff. Determined to defend its current\r\ninterpretation of the Gillem Board policy, the Army resisted the\r\nPersonnel Policy Board's use of the Air Force plan, Secretary Johnson's\r\ndirective, and the initial recommendations of the Fahy Committee   (p. 360)\r\nto pry out of it a new commitment to integrate. In lieu of such a\r\ncommitment, Acting Secretary of the Army Gordon Gray[14-64] offered\r\nSecretary Johnson another spirited defense of Circular 124 on 26 May,\r\npromising that the Army's next step would be to integrate black\r\ncompanies in the white battalions of the combat arms. This step could\r\nnot be taken, he added, until the reactions to placing black\r\nbattalions in white regiments and black companies in composite\r\nbattalions had been observed in detail over a period of time. Gray\r\nremained unmoved by the committee's appeal for the wider use and\r\nbroader training of the talented black soldiers in the name of combat\r\nefficiency and continued to defend the _status quo_. He cited with\r\nfeeling the case of the average black soldier who because of his\r\n\"social environment\" had most often missed the opportunity to develop\r\nleadership abilities and who against the direct competition with the\r\nbetter educated white soldier would find it difficult to \"rise above\r\nthe level of service tasks.\" Segregation, Gray claimed, was giving\r\nblack soldiers the chance to develop leadership \"unhindered and\r\nunfettered by overshadowing competition they are not yet equipped to\r\nmeet.\" He would be remiss in his duties, he warned Johnson, if he\r\nfailed to report the concern of many senior officers who believed that\r\nthe Army had already gone too far in inserting black units into white\r\nunits and that \"we are weakening to a dangerous degree the combat\r\nefficiency of our Army.\"[14-65]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-64: Following the resignation of\r\n                   Secretary Royall, President Truman nominated Gordon\r\n                   Gray as Secretary of the Army. His appointment was\r\n                   confirmed by the Senate on 13 June 1949. A lawyer,\r\n                   Gray had been a newspaper publisher in North\r\n                   Carolina before his appointment as assistant\r\n                   secretary in 1947.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-65: Memo, Actg SA for SecDef, 26 May 49,\r\n                   sub: Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the\r\n                   Armed Services; see also P&A Summary Sheet, 19 May\r\n                   49, same sub, FC file.]\r\n\r\nThe Army's response found the Fahy Committee and the office of the\r\nSecretary of Defense once again in agreement. The committee rejected\r\nGray's statement, and Kenworthy drew up a point-by-point rebuttal. He\r\ncontended that unless the Army took intermediate steps, its first\r\nobjective, a specific quota of black units segregated at the battalion\r\nlevel, would always block the realization of integration, its ultimate\r\nobjective.[14-66] The secretary's Personnel Policy Board struck an even\r\nharder blow. Chairman Reid called Gray's statement a rehash of Army\r\naccomplishments \"with no indication of significant change or step\r\nforward.\" It ignored the committee's recommendations. In particular,\r\nand in contrast to the Navy, which had agreed to restudy the\r\nenlistment parity question, the Army had rejected the committee's\r\nrequest that it reconsider its quota system. Reid's blunt advice to\r\nJohnson: reject the Army's reply and demand a new one by a definite\r\nand early date.[14-67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-66: Memo, Kenworthy for Fahy, 30 May 49,\r\n                   sub: Replies of Army and Navy to Mr. Johnson's May\r\n                   11 Memo, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-67: Memo, Reid for SecDef, 1 Jun 49, sub:\r\n                   Army and Navy Replies to Your Memorandum of 6 April\r\n                   on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the\r\n                   Army Services; Min, PPB Mtg, 2 Jun 49; both in FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\nMembers of the Fahy Committee met with Johnson and Reid on 1 June.\r\nDespite the antagonism that was growing between the Secretary of\r\nDefense and the White House group, the meeting produced several notable\r\nagreements. For his part, Johnson, accepting the recommendations of\r\nFahy and Reid, agreed to reject the Army's latest response and     (p. 361)\r\norder the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff to confer\r\ninformally with the committee in an attempt to produce an acceptable\r\nprogram. At the same time, Johnson made no move to order a common\r\nenlistment standard; he told Fahy that the matter was extremely\r\ncontroversial and setting such standards would involve rescinding\r\nprevious interdepartmental agreements. On the committee's behalf, Fahy\r\nagreed to reword the recommendation on schooling for all qualified\r\nNegroes within eighteen months of enlistment and to discuss further\r\nthe parity issue.[14-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-68: Min, PPB Mtg, 2 Jun 49; Ltr, Fahy to\r\n                   Johnson, 25 Jul 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESS NOTICE. _Rejection of the Army's second proposal\r\nas seen by the Afro-American, June 14, 1949._]\r\n\r\nGeneral Lanham endorsed the committee's belief that there was a need\r\nfor practical, intermediate steps when he drafted a response to the\r\nArmy for Secretary Johnson to sign. \"It is my conviction,\" he wanted\r\nJohnson to say, \"that the Department of the Army must meet this issue\r\n[the equal opportunity imposed by Executive Order 9981] squarely and\r\nthat its action, no matter how modest or small at its inception, must\r\nbe progressive in spirit and carry with it the unmistakable promise of\r\nan ultimate solution in consonance with the Chief Executive's position\r\nand our national policy.\"[14-69]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-69: Draft Memo, Lanham for SecDef, 2 Jun\r\n                   49, FC file.]\r\n\r\nBut the Army received no such specific instruction. Although Johnson\r\nrejected the Army's second reply and demanded another based on a\r\ncareful consideration of the Fahy Committee's recommendations,[14-70]\r\nhe deleted Lanham's demand for immediate steps toward providing equal\r\nopportunity. Johnson's rejection of Lanham's proposal--a tacit\r\nrejection of the committee's basic premise as well--did not\r\nnecessarily indicate a shift in Johnson's position, but it did\r\nestablish a basis for future rivalry between the secretary and the\r\ncommittee. Until now Johnson and the committee, through the medium of\r\nthe Personnel Policy Board, had worked in an informal partnership\r\nwhose fruitfulness was readily apparent in the development of\r\nacceptable Navy and Air Force programs and in Johnson's rejection of\r\nthe Army's inadequate responses. But this cooperation was to be    (p. 362)\r\nshort-lived; it would disappear altogether as the Fahy Committee began\r\nto press the Army, while the Secretary of Defense, in reaction, began\r\nto draw closer to the Army's position.[14-71]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-70: Memo, SecDef for SA, 7 Jun 49, sub:\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services; NME, Off of Pub Info, Press Release\r\n                   78-49A, 7 Jun 49. The secretary gave the Army a new\r\n                   deadline of 20 June, but by mutual agreement of all\r\n                   concerned this date was postponed several times and\r\n                   finally left to the Secretary of the Army to submit\r\n                   his program \"at his discretion,\" although at the\r\n                   earliest possible date.

Kenworthy was convinced that the committee's\r\nmoderate and concrete recommendations had reassured Reid and the\r\nPersonnel Policy Board and would strengthen its hand in dealing with\r\nthe recalcitrant Army,[14-72] and Fahy, outlining for the President the\r\nprogress the committee had made with the services, said that he looked\r\nforward to his coming meetings with Gray and Bradley.[14-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-72: Ltr, Kenworthy to Fahy, 20 May 49,\r\n                   Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-73: Fahy Cmte, \"A Progress Report for the\r\n                   President,\" 7 Jun 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\nTo remove any unnecessary obstacle to what Fahy hoped would be\r\nfruitful sessions, the committee revised its initial recommendations\r\nto the Army. First, as Fahy had promised Johnson, it modified its\r\nposition on guaranteeing qualified black soldiers already assigned to\r\nunits the opportunity to attend Army schools within eighteen months.\r\nCalling the imbroglio over this issue a mere misunderstanding--the\r\ncommittee did not intend that preferential treatment be given Negroes\r\nnor that the Army train more people than it needed--Fahy explained to\r\nJohnson that the committee only wanted to make sure that qualified\r\nNegroes would have the same chance as qualified white men. It would be\r\nhappy, Fahy said, to work with the Army on rewording the\r\nrecommendation.[14-74] The committee also added the suggestion that so\r\nlong as racial units existed, the Army might permit enlisted men in\r\nthe four lowest grades, at their request, to remain in a unit\r\npredominantly composed of men of their own race. This provision,\r\nhowever, was not to extend to officers and noncommissioned officers in\r\nthe top three grades, who received their promotions on a worldwide\r\ncompetitive basis. Finally, the committee offered a substitute for the\r\nnumerical quota it wanted abolished. So that the Army would not get\r\ntoo many low-scoring recruits, either black or white, the committee\r\nproposed a separate quota for each category in the classification test\r\nscores. Only so many voluntary enlistments would be accepted in\r\ncategories I through III, their numbers based on the normal spread of\r\nscores that existed in both the wartime and peacetime Army. If the\r\nArmy netted more high scorers than average in any period, it would\r\ninduct fewer men from the next category. It would also deny\r\nreenlistment to any man scoring less than eighty (category IV).[14-75]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-74: Ltr, Fahy to Johnson, 15 Jun 49, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-75: Idem to SA, 25 Jul 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\nAfter meeting first with Gray and then the Chief of Staff, Fahy called\r\nthe sessions \"frank and cordial\" and saw some prospect of accord,\r\nalthough their positions were still far apart.[14-76] Just how far\r\napart had already become apparent on 5 July when Gray presented    (p. 363)\r\nFahy with an outline for yet another program for using black soldiers.\r\nThis new program was based in part on the comments of the field\r\ncommanders, and the Director of Personnel and Administration warned\r\nthat \"beyond the steps listed in this plan, there is very little major\r\ncompromise area left short of complete integration.\"[14-77] While the\r\nArmy plan differed from the committee's recommendations in many ways,\r\nin essence the disagreement was limited to two fundamental points.\r\nDetermined to retain segregated units, the Army opposed the\r\nreassignment of school-trained Negroes to vacancies in white units;\r\nand in order to prevent an influx of Negroes in the low achievement\r\ncategories, the Army was determined to retain the numerical\r\nquota.[14-78]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-76: Idem to SecDef, 25 Jul 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-77: P&A Summary Sheet to DC/S (Adm), 24\r\n                   Jun 49, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower, CSUSA\r\n                   291.2 Negroes.

It\r\ncould not see how removal of the numerical quota would result in a\r\nflood of Negroes joining the Army, but it could see how retaining the\r\nquota would prevent the enlistment of blacks for long periods of time.\r\nThese two provisions--that school-trained Negroes be freely assigned\r\nand that the quota be abolished--were really the heart of the\r\ncommittee's plan and hope for the gradual integration of the Army. The\r\nprovisions would not require the abolition of racial units \"at this\r\ntime,\" Fahy explained to President Truman, but they would gradually\r\nextend the integration already practiced in overhead installations and\r\nArmy schools. The committee could not demand any less, he confessed,\r\nin light of the President's order.[14-79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-79: Ltrs, Fahy to SecDef and SA, 25 Jul\r\n                   49; idem to President, 27 Jul 49. All in FC file.]\r\n\r\nThe committee and the Army had reached a stalemate. As a staff member\r\nof the Personnel Policy Board put it, their latest proposal and\r\ncounterproposals were simply extensions of what had long been put\r\nforth by both parties. He advised Chairman Reid to remain neutral\r\nuntil both sides presented their \"total proposal.\"[14-80] But the\r\npress was not remaining neutral. The New York _Times_, for example,\r\naccused the Army of stalling and equivocating, engaging in a \"private\r\ninsurrection,\" and trying \"to preserve a pattern of bigotry which\r\ncaricatures the democratic cause in every corner of the world.\" There\r\nwas no room for compromise, the _Times_ added, and President Truman\r\ncould not retreat without abdicating as Commander in Chief.[14-81]\r\nSecretary Gray countered with a statement that the Army was still  (p. 364)\r\nunder injunction from the Secretary of Defense to submit a new race\r\nprogram, and he was contemplating certain new proposals on the\r\nmilitary occupational specialty issue.[14-82]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-80: Memo, Col J.

Haislip, the Vice Chief of Staff, claimed privately to\r\nGray that the new reply was almost identical with the plan presented\r\nto the committee on 5 July and that the new concessions on\r\noccupational specialties would only require the conversion of some\r\nunits from white to black.[14-83] Haislip, however, had not reckoned\r\nwith the concession that Gray was prepared to make to Fahy. Gray\r\naccepted in principle the committee's argument that the assignment of\r\nblack graduates of specialist schools should not be limited to black\r\nunits or overhead positions but could be used to fill vacancies in any\r\nunit. At the same time, he remained adamant on the quota. When the\r\ncommittee spoke hopefully of the advantages of an Army open to all,\r\nthe Army contemplated fearfully the racial imbalance that might\r\nresult. The future was to prove the committee right about the\r\nadvantages, but as of September 1949 Gray and his subordinates had no\r\nintention of giving up the quota.[14-84] Gray did agree, however, to\r\ncontinue studying the quota issue with the committee, and Fahy\r\noptimistically reported to President Truman: \"It is the Committee's\r\nexpectation that it will be able within a few weeks to make a formal\r\nreport to you on a complete list of changes in Army policy and\r\npractices.\"[14-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-83: Memo, VCofS for Gray, 29 Aug 49, sub:\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services, CSUSA 291.2 Negroes.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-84: Interv, Nichols with Gordon Gray,\r\n                   1953, in Nichols Collection, CMH; Memo, Kenworthy\r\n                   for Cmte, 19 Sep 49, sub: Meeting With Gray, 16 Sep\r\n                   49, Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-85: Ltrs, Fahy to President, 21 Sep and\r\n                   26 Sep 49, both in FC file.]\r\n\r\nFahy made his prediction before Secretary of Defense Johnson took a\r\ncourse of action that, in effect, rendered the committee's position\r\nuntenable. On 30 September Johnson received from Gray a new program\r\nfor the employment of black troops. Without reference to the Fahy\r\nCommittee, Johnson approved the proposal and announced it to the\r\npress. Gray's program opened all military occupational specialties to\r\nall qualified men, abolished racial quotas for the Army's schools, and\r\nabolished racially separate promotion systems and standards. But it\r\nalso specifically called for retention of the racial quota on\r\nenlistments and conspicuously failed to provide for the assignment of\r\nblack specialists beyond those jobs already provided by the old Gillem\r\nBoard policy.[14-86] Secretary Gray had asked for Fahy's personal\r\napproval before forwarding the plan discussed by the two men at such\r\nlength, but Fahy refused; he wanted the plan submitted to his full\r\ncommittee. When Johnson received the plan he did not consult the\r\ncommittee at all, although he briefly referred it to the acting\r\nchairman of the Personnel Policy Board, who interposed no\r\nobjection.[14-87]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-86: Memo, SA for SecDef, 30 Sep 49, sub:\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services, CSGPA 291.2; DOD, Off of Pub Info, Press\r\n                   Release 256-49, 30 Sep 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-87: Memo, Kenworthy for Cmte, 27 Sep 49,\r\n                   sub: Army's Reply to Secretary Johnson, Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library; Note, handwritten and\r\n                   signed McCrea, attached to memo, SA for SecDef, 30\r\n                   Sep 49; Memo, Thompson for Leva, 3 Oct 49, sub:\r\n                   Army Policy of Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity, CD 30-1-4; both in SecDef files.]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand Johnson's reasons for ignoring   (p. 365)\r\nthe President's committee. He had been forced to endure public\r\ncriticism over the protracted negotiations between the Army and the\r\ncommittee. Among liberal elements on Capitol Hill, his position--that\r\nhis directive and the service replies made legislation to prohibit\r\nsegregation in the services unnecessary--was obviously being\r\ncompromised by the lack of an acceptable Army response.[14-88] In a\r\nword, the argument over civil rights in the armed forces had become a\r\npolitical liability for Louis Johnson, and he wanted it out of the\r\nway. Glossing over the Army's truculence, Johnson blamed the committee\r\nand its recommendations for his problem, and when his frontal assault\r\non the committee failed--Kenworthy reported that the secretary tried\r\nto have the committee disbanded--he had to devise another\r\napproach.[14-89] The Army's new proposal, a more reasonable-sounding\r\ndocument than its predecessor, provided him with a convenient\r\nopportunity. Why not quickly approve the program, thereby presenting\r\nthe committee with a _fait accompli_ and leaving the President with\r\nlittle excuse for prolonging the civil rights negotiations?\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-88: Ltr, SecDef to Congressman Vinson, 7\r\n                   Jul 49; Memo, Lanham for Reid, 29 Mar 49; both in\r\n                   PPB files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-89: Ltr, Kenworthy to Nichols, 28 Jul 53,\r\n                   in Nichols Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Johnson the gambit failed. While Fahy admitted that\r\nthe Army's newest proposal was an improvement, for several reasons he\r\ncould not accept it. The assignment of black specialists to white\r\nunits was a key part of the committee's program, and despite Gray's\r\nprivate assurances that specialists would be integrated, Fahy was not\r\nprepared to accept the Army's \"equivocal\" language on this subject.\r\nThere was also the issue of the quota, still very much alive between\r\nthe committee and the Army. The committee was bound, furthermore, to\r\nresent being ignored in the approval process. Fahy and his associates\r\nhad been charged by the President with advising the services on\r\nequality of treatment and opportunity, and they were determined to be\r\nheard.[14-90] Fahy informed the White House that the committee would\r\nreview the Army's proposal in an extraordinary meeting. He asked that\r\nthe President meanwhile refrain from comment.[14-91]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-90: Memo, Kenworthy to Cmte, 27 Sep 49,\r\n                   sub: Army's Reply to Secretary Johnson, and Ltr,\r\n                   Kenworthy to Joseph Evans, 30 Sep 49, both in Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library; Memo, Worthington Thompson\r\n                   for Leva, 3 Oct 49, sub: Army Policy of Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity, SecDef files; Ltr,\r\n                   Kenworthy to Nichols, 28 Jul 53, in Nichols\r\n                   Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-91: Memo for Rcd, probably written by\r\n                   Philleo Nash, 3 Oct 49, Nash Collection, Truman\r\n                   Library.]\r\n\r\nThe committee's stand received support from the black press and\r\nnumerous national civil rights organizations, all of which excoriated\r\nthe Army's position.[14-92] David K. Niles, the White House adviser on\r\nracial matters, warned President Truman about the rising controversy\r\nand predicted that the committee would again reject the Army's\r\nproposal. He advised the President to tell the press that Johnson's\r\nnews release was merely a \"progress report,\" that it was not final,\r\nand that the committee was continuing its investigation.[14-93] The\r\nPresident did just that, adding: \"Eventually we will reach, I      (p. 366)\r\nhope, what we contemplated in the beginning. You can't do it all at\r\nonce. The progress report was a good report, and it isn't finished\r\nyet.\"[14-94] And lest his purpose remain unclear, the President\r\ndeclared that his aim was the racial integration of the Army.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-92: See Los Angeles _Star Review_,\r\n                   October 6, 1949; _Afro-American_, October 8, 1949;\r\n                   Washington _Post_, October 6, 1949; Pittsburgh\r\n                   _Courier_, Octobers, 1949; Norfolk _Journal and\r\n                   Guide_, October 15, 1949; New York _Amsterdam\r\n                   News_, October 15, 1949.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-93: Ltr, Niles to President, 5 Oct 49,\r\n                   Nash Collection, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-94: News Conference, 6 Oct 49, as quoted\r\n                   in _Public Papers of the President: Harry S.\r\n                   Truman, 1949_, p. 501.]\r\n\r\nThe President's statement signaled a victory for the committee; its\r\nextent became apparent only when the Army tried to issue a new\r\ncircular, revising its Gillem Board policy along the lines of the\r\noutline plan approved by Johnson on 30 September. During the weeks of\r\nprotracted negotiations that followed, the committee clearly remained\r\nin control, its power derived basically from its willingness to have\r\nthe differences between the committee and the Army publicized and the\r\nreluctance of the White House to have it so. The attitudes toward\r\npublicity were already noticeable when, on 11 October, Fahy suggested\r\nto Truman some possible solutions to the impasse between the committee\r\nand the Army. The Secretary of Defense could issue a supplementary\r\nstatement on the Army's assignment policy, the committee could release\r\nits recommendations to the press, or the Army and the committee could\r\nresume discussions.[14-95]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-95: Memo, Fahy for President, 11 Oct 49,\r\n                   FC file.]\r\n\r\nPresident Truman ordered his military aide to read the committee's 11\r\nOctober suggestion and \"then take [it] up with Johnson.\"[14-96] As a\r\nresult the Secretary of Defense retired from the controversy.\r\nReminding Gray through intermediaries that he had approved the Army's\r\nplan in outline form, Johnson declared that it was \"inappropriate\" for\r\nhim to approve the plan's publication as an Army circular as the Army\r\nhad requested.[14-97] About the same time, Niles informed the Army\r\nthat any revision of Circular 124 would have to be submitted to the\r\nWhite House before publication, and he candidly admitted that\r\npresidential approval would depend on the views of the Fahy\r\nCommittee.[14-98] Meanwhile, his assistant, Philleo Nash, predicting\r\nthat the committee would win both the assignment and quota arguments,\r\npersuaded Fahy to postpone any public statement until after the Army's\r\nrevised circular had been reviewed by the committee.[14-99]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-96: Penciled Note, signed HST, on Memo,\r\n                   Niles for President, Secretary's File (PSF), Truman\r\n                   Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-97: Memo, Maj Gen Levin C.

Until\r\nthe committee disbanded, its opponents would try to block any real\r\nchange in Army policy.[14-100] Kenworthy offered in evidence the\r\ncurrent controversy over the Army's instructions to its field\r\ncommanders. These instructions, a copy of the outline plan         (p. 367)\r\napproved by Secretary Johnson, had been sent to the commanders by The\r\nAdjutant General on 1 October as \"additional policies\" pending a\r\nrevision of Circular 124.[14-101] Included in the message, of course,\r\nwas Gray's order to open all military occupational specialties to\r\nNegroes; but when some commanders, on the basis of their\r\ninterpretation of the message, began integrating black specialists in\r\nwhite units, officials in the Personnel and Administration and the\r\nOrganization and Training Divisions dispatched a second message on 27\r\nOctober specifically forbidding such action \"except on Department of\r\nArmy orders.\"[14-102] Negroes would continue to be authorized for\r\nassignment to black units, the message explained, and to \"Negro spaces\r\nin T/D [overhead] units.\" In effect, the Army staff was ordering\r\ncommanders to interpret the secretary's plan in its narrowest sense,\r\nblocking any possibility of broadening the range of black assignments.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-100: Memo, Kenworthy for Cmte, 29 Oct 49,\r\n                   sub: Background to Proposed Letter to Gray, Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-101: Msg, TAG to Chief, AFF, et al., WCL\r\n                   45586, 011900Z Oct 49, copy in AG 220.3.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-102: Memo, D/PA for TAG, 25 Oct 49, sub:\r\n                   Assignment of Negro Enlisted Personnel, with\r\n                   attached Memo for Rcd, Col John H.

He knew that Negroes, both civilian and military, worked\r\nin the message centers, and he suspected that if any hanky-panky was\r\nafoot they would discover it and he would be anonymously apprised of\r\nit. A few days after the dispatch of the second message, Kenworthy\r\nopened his desk drawer to find a copy. For the first and only time, he\r\nlater explained, he broke his self-imposed rule of relying on\r\nnegotiations between the military and the committee and its staff _in\r\ncamera_. He laid both messages before a long-time friend of his, the\r\neditor of the Washington _Post_'s editorial page.[14-103] Thus\r\ndelivered to the press, the second message brought on another round of\r\naccusations, corrections, and headlines to the effect that \"The Brass\r\nGives Gray the Run-Around.\" Kenworthy was able to denounce the\r\nincident as a \"step backward\" that even violated the Gillem Board\r\npolicy by allocating \"Negro spaces\" in overhead units. The Army\r\nstaff's second message nullified the committee's recommendations since\r\nthey depended ultimately on the unlimited assignment of black\r\nspecialists. The message demonstrated very well, Kenworthy told the\r\ncommittee, that careful supervision of the Army's racial policy would\r\nbe necessary.[14-104] Some newspapers were less charitable. The\r\nPittsburgh _Courier_ charged that the colonel blamed for the release\r\nof the second message had been made the \"goat\" in a case that involved\r\nfar more senior officials, and the Washington _Post_ claimed that the\r\nmessage \"vitiates\" even the limited improvements outlined in the\r\nArmy's plan as approved by Secretary Johnson. The paper called on\r\nSecretary Gray to assert himself in the case.[14-105]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-103: Memo, Kenworthy for Chief of\r\n                   Military History, 13 Oct 76, CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-104: Idem for Cmte, 29 Oct 49, sub:\r\n                   Instructions to Commanding Generals on New Army\r\n                   Policy, Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-105: Lem Graves, Jr. (Washington\r\n                   correspondent of the Pittsburgh _Courier_), \"A\r\n                   Colonel Takes the Rap,\" Pittsburgh _Courier_,\r\n                   October 29, 1949; Washington _Post_, November 3,\r\n                   1949.]\r\n\r\nA furious secretary, learning of the second message from the press (p. 368)\r\nstories, did enter the case.

He would\r\ncontinue, in effect, the plan approved by the Secretary of Defense on\r\n30 September, he told Fahy.[14-107]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-106: DOD, Off of Pub Info, Release\r\n                   400-49, 3 Nov 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-107: Ltr, SA to Fahy, 17 Nov 49, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\nThe Army staff's draft revision of the Gillem Board circular, sent to\r\nthe committee on 25 November, reflected Gray's 30 September\r\nplan.[14-108] In short, when it emerged from its journey through the\r\nvarious Army staff agencies, the proposed revision still contained\r\nnone of the committee's key recommendations. It continued the severe\r\nrestrictions on the assignment of Negroes who had specialty training;\r\nit specifically retained the numerical quota; and, with several\r\nspecific exceptions, it carefully preserved the segregation of Army\r\nlife.[14-109] Actually, the proposed revision amounted to little more\r\nthan a repetition of the Gillem Board policy with minor modifications\r\ndesigned to make it easier to carry out. Fahy quickly warned the\r\nDeputy Director of Personnel and Administration that there was no\r\nchance of its winning the committee's approval.[14-110]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-108: Ltr, Bendetsen to Fahy, 25 Nov 49;\r\n                   Memo for Rcd, Kenworthy, 28 Nov 49; both in Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-109: Army Draft No. 1 of Revised Circular\r\n                   124, 16 Nov 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-110: Ltr, Fahy to Maj Gen C. E. Byers, 30\r\n                   Nov 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Assignments_\r\n\r\nThe quota and assignments issues remained the center of controversy\r\nbetween the Army and the committee. Although Fahy was prepared to\r\npostpone a decision on the quota while negotiations continued, he was\r\nunwilling to budge on the assignments issue. As the committee had\r\nrepeatedly emphasized, the question of open, integrated assignment of\r\ntrained Negroes was at the heart of its program. Without it the\r\nopening of Army schools and military occupational specialties would be\r\nmeaningless and the intent of Executive Order 9981 frustrated.\r\n\r\nAt first glance it would seem that the revision of Circular 124\r\nsupported the assignment of Negroes to white units, as indeed\r\nSecretary Gray had recently promised. But this was not really the\r\ncase, as Kenworthy explained to the committee. The Army had always\r\nmade a distinction between _specialists_, men especially recruited for\r\ncritically needed jobs, and _specialties_, those military occupations\r\nfor which soldiers were routinely trained in Army schools. The draft\r\nrevision did not refer to this second and far larger category and was\r\nintended to provide only for the placement of the rare black\r\nspecialist in white units. The document as worded even limited     (p. 369)\r\nthe use of Negroes in overhead units. Only those with skills\r\nconsidered appropriate by the personnel office--that is, those who\r\npossessed a specialty either inappropriate in a black unit or in\r\nexcess of its needs--would be considered for racially mixed overhead\r\nunits.[14-111]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-111: Memo, Kenworthy for President's\r\n                   Cmte, 18 Nov 49, sub: Successor Policy to WD Cir\r\n                   124; idem for Fahy, 28 Nov 49, sub: Revised WD Cir\r\n                   124; both in Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nFahy was determined to have the Army's plan modified, and furthermore\r\nhe had learned during the past few weeks how to get it done. On 9\r\nDecember Kenworthy telephoned Philleo Nash at the White House to\r\ninform him of the considerable sentiment in the committee for\r\npublicizing the whole affair and read to him the draft of a press\r\nstatement prepared by Fahy. As Fahy expected, the White House wanted\r\nto avoid publicity; the President, through Nash, assured the committee\r\nthat the issues of assignment and quota were still under discussion.\r\nNash suggested that instead of a public statement the committee\r\nprepare a document for the Army and the White House explaining what\r\nprinciples and procedures were demanded by the presidential order. In\r\nhis opinion, Nash assured Kenworthy, the White House would order the\r\nArmy to meet the committee's recommendations.[14-112]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-112: Memo for Rcd, Kenworthy, 9 Dec 49,\r\n                   sub: Telephone Conversation With Nash, Fahy Papers,\r\n                   Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nWhite House pressure undoubtedly played a major role in the resolution\r\nof the assignment issue. When on 14 December 1949 the committee\r\npresented the Army and the President with its comments on the Army's\r\nproposed revision of Circular 124, it took the first step toward what\r\nwas to be a rapid agreement on black assignments. At the same time it\r\nwould be a mistake to discount the effectiveness of reasonable men of\r\ngood will discussing their very real differences in an effort to reach\r\na consensus. There is considerable evidence that when Fahy met on 27\r\nDecember with Secretary Gray and General J. Lawton Collins, the Chief\r\nof Staff, he was able to convince them that the committee's position\r\non the assignment of black graduates of specialist schools was right\r\nand inevitable.[14-113]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-113: Interv, Nichols with Fahy. J. Lawton\r\n                   Collins became Chief of Staff of the Army on 1\r\n                   August 1949, succeeding Omar Bradley who stepped up\r\n                   to the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.]\r\n\r\nWhile neither Gray nor Collins could even remotely be described as\r\nsocial reformers, both were pragmatic leaders, prepared to accept\r\nchanges in Army tradition.[14-114] Collins, unlike his immediate\r\npredecessors, was not so much concerned with finding the Army in the\r\nvanguard of American social practices as he was in determining that\r\nits racial practices guaranteed a more efficient organization. While\r\nhe wanted to retain the numerical quota, lest the advantages of an\r\nArmy career attract so large a number of Negroes that a serious racial\r\nimbalance would result, he was willing to accept a substantive\r\nrevision of the Gillem Board policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-114: Intervs, Nichols with Gray and Fahy,\r\n                   and author with Collins.]\r\n\r\nGray was perhaps more cautious than Collins. Confessing later that he\r\nhad never considered the question of equal opportunity until Fahy\r\nbrought it to his attention, Gray began with a limited view of the\r\nexecutive order--the Army must eliminate racial discrimination,    (p. 370)\r\nnot promote racial integration. In their meeting on 27 December Fahy\r\nwas able to convince Gray that the former was impossible without the\r\nlatter. According to Kenworthy, Gray demonstrated an \"open and\r\nunbiased\" view of the problem throughout all discussions.[14-115]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-115: Ltr, Kenworthy to Gray, 20 Jul 50,\r\n                   FC file; Intervs, Nichols with Gray, Davenport, and\r\n                   Fahy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY OF THE ARMY GRAY.]\r\n\r\nThe trouble was, as Roy Davenport later noted, Gordon Gray was a\r\nlawyer, not a personnel expert, and he failed to grasp the full\r\nimplications of the Army staff's recommendations.[14-116] Davenport\r\nwas speaking from firsthand knowledge because Gray, after belatedly\r\nlearning of his experience and influence with the committee, sent for\r\nhim. Politely but explicitly Davenport told Gray that the staff\r\nofficers who were advising him and writing the memos and directives to\r\nwhich he was signing his name had deceived him. Gray was at first\r\nannoyed and incredulous; after Davenport finally convinced him, he was\r\nangry. Kenworthy, years later, wrote that the Gray-Davenport\r\ndiscussion was decisive in changing Gray's mind on the assignment\r\nissue and was of great help to the Fahy Committee.[14-117]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-116: Interv, author with Davenport, 31\r\n                   Oct 71.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-117: Memo, Kenworthy for Chief of\r\n                   Military History, 13 Oct 76, CMH.]\r\n\r\nFahy reduced the whole problem to the case of one qualified black\r\nsoldier denied a job because of color and pictured the loss to the\r\nArmy and the country, eloquently pleading with Gray and Collins at the\r\n27 December meeting to try the committee's way. \"I can't say you won't\r\nhave problems,\" Fahy concluded, \"but try it.\" Gray resisted at first\r\nbecause \"this would mean the complete end of segregation,\" but unable\r\nto deny the logic of Fahy's arguments he agreed to try.[14-118] There\r\nwere compromises on both sides. When Collins pointed out some of the\r\nadministrative difficulties that could come from the \"mandatory\"\r\nlanguage recommended by the committee, Fahy said that the policy\r\nshould be administered \"with latitude.\" To that end he promised to\r\nsuggest some changes in wording that would produce \"a policy with some\r\nplay in the joints.\" The conferees also agreed that the quota issue\r\nshould be downplayed while the parties continued their discussions on\r\nthat subject.[14-119]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-118: Memo for Rcd, Karl R. Bendetsen,\r\n                   Spec Asst to SA, 27 Dec 49, sub: Conference With\r\n                   Judge Charles Fahy, SA files.

Roy Davenport presented the committee members with the\r\nfinal draft of the Army proposal and urged that it be accepted as  (p. 371)\r\n\"the furthest and most hopeful they could get.\"[14-120] Lester\r\nGranger, Davenport later reported, was the first to say he would\r\naccept, with Fahy and the rest following suit,[14-121] and on 16\r\nJanuary 1950 the Army issued Special Regulation 600-629-1,\r\n_Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Army_, with the committee's\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-120: Interv, Nichols with Davenport.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-121: Ltr, Kenworthy to Nichols, 29 Jul\r\n                   53, in Nichols Collection, CMH; Interv, Nichols\r\n                   with Davenport.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL COLLINS.]\r\n\r\nFahy reported to Truman that the new Army policy was consistent with\r\nthe executive order. Its paragraphs on assignments spelled out the\r\nprinciple long advocated by the committee: \"Negro manpower possessing\r\nappropriate skills and qualifications will be utilized in accordance\r\nwith such skills and qualifications, and will be assigned to any ...\r\nunit without regard to race or color.\" Adding substance to this\r\ndeclaration, the Army also announced that a list of critical\r\nspecialties in which vacancies existed would be published periodically\r\nand ordered major commanders to assign Negroes who possessed those\r\nspecialties to fill the vacancies without regard to race. The first\r\nsuch list was published at the same time as the new regulation. The\r\nArmy had taken a significant step, Fahy told the President, toward the\r\nrealization of equal treatment and opportunity for all soldiers.[14-122]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-122: Memo, Fahy for President, 16 Jan 50,\r\n                   FC file; SR 600-629-1, 16 Jan 50; DOD, Off of Pub\r\n                   Info, Release 64-50, 16 Jan 50. The special\r\n                   regulation was circulated worldwide on the day of\r\n                   the issue; see Memo, D/P&A to TAG, 16 Jan 50, WDGPA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nSecretary of Defense Johnson was also optimistic, but he warned Gordon\r\nGray that many complex problems remained and asked the Army for\r\nperiodic reports. His request only emphasized the fact that the Army's\r\nnew regulation lacked the machinery for monitoring compliance with its\r\nprovisions for integration. As the history of the Gillem Board era\r\ndemonstrated, any attempt to change the Army's traditions demanded not\r\nonly exact definition of the intermediate steps but also establishment\r\nof a responsible authority to enforce compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quotas_\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the Army's new assignment regulation, the committee\r\nturned its full attention to the last of its major recommendations,\r\nthe abolition of the numerical quota. Despite months of discussion,\r\nthe disagreement between the Army and the committee over the quota (p. 372)\r\nshowed no signs of resolution. Simply put, the Fahy Committee wanted\r\nthe Army to abolish the Gillem Board's racial quota and to substitute\r\na quota based on General Classification Test scores of enlistees. The\r\ncommittee found the racial quota unacceptable in terms of the\r\nexecutive order and wasteful of manpower since it tended to encourage\r\nthe reenlistment of low-scoring Negroes and thereby prevented the\r\nenlistment of superior men. None of the Negroes graduating from high\r\nschool in June 1949, for example, no matter how high their academic\r\nrating, could enlist because the black quota had been filled for\r\nmonths. Quotas based on test scores, on the other hand, would limit\r\nenlistment to only the higher scoring blacks and whites.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the committee wanted no enlistment to be decided by\r\nrace. The Army would open all enlistments to anyone who scored ninety\r\nor above, limiting the number of blacks and whites scoring between\r\neighty and eighty-nine to 13.4 percent of the total Army strength, a\r\npercentage based on World War II strengths. With rare exception it\r\nwould close enlistment to anyone who scored less than eighty. Applying\r\nthis formula to the current Army, 611,400 men on 31 March 1949, and\r\nassessing the number of men from seventeen to thirty-four years old in\r\nthe national population, the committee projected a total of 65,565\r\nNegroes in the Army, almost exactly 10 percent of the Army's strength.\r\nIn a related statistical report prepared by Davenport, the committee\r\noffered figures demonstrating that the higher black reenlistment rates\r\nwould not increase the number of black soldiers.[14-123]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-123: D/PA Summary Sheet for SA, 28 Feb\r\n                   50, sub: Fahy Committee Proposal re: Numerical\r\n                   Enlistment Quota, CSGPA 291.2 (2 Nov 49); Roy\r\n                   Davenport, \"Figures on Reenlistment Rate and\r\n                   Explanation,\" Document FC XL, FC file; Memo, Fahy\r\n                   for SA, 9 Feb 50, sub: Recapitulation of the\r\n                   Proposal of the President's Committee for the\r\n                   Abolition of the Racial Quota, FC file; Memo,\r\n                   Kenworthy for Dwight Palmer (cmte member), 8 Feb\r\n                   50, Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nThe Army's reply was based on the premise that \"the Negro strength of\r\nthe Army must be restricted and that the population ratio is the most\r\nequitable method [of] limitation.\" In fact, the _only_ method of\r\ncontrolling black strength was a numerical quota of original\r\nenlistments. The personnel staff argued that enlistment specifically\r\nunrestricted by race, as the high rate of unrestricted black\r\nreenlistment had demonstrated, would inevitably produce a \"very high\r\npercentage of Negroes in the Army.\" A quota based on the\r\nclassification test scores could not limit sufficiently the number of\r\nblack enlistments if, as the committee insisted, it required that\r\nidentical enlistment standards be maintained for both blacks and\r\nwhites. Looking at the census figure another way, the Army had its own\r\nstatistics to prove its point. Basing its figures on the number of\r\nNegroes who became eighteen each month (11,000), the personnel staff\r\nestimated that black enlistments would total from 15 to 20 percent of\r\nthe Army's monthly strength if an entrance quota was imposed with the\r\ncut-off score set at ninety or from 19 to 31 percent if the enlistment\r\nstandards were lowered to eighty. It also pointed to the experience of\r\nthe Air Force where with no quotas in the third quarter of 1949 black\r\nenlistments accounted for 16.4 percent of the total; even when a   (p. 373)\r\nGCT quota of 100 was imposed in October and November, 10 percent of\r\nall Air Force enlistees were black.[14-124]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-124: Memo, Actg D/PA for Karl R.\r\n                   Bendetsen, Spec Asst to SA, 13 Dec 49, sub: Ten\r\n                   Percent Racial Quota; D/PA Summary Sheet, with\r\n                   Incl, for SA, 28 Feb 50, sub: Fahy Committee\r\n                   Proposals re: Numerical Enlistment Quota; both in\r\n                   CSGPA 291.2 (2 Nov 49). The quotations are from the\r\n                   former document.]\r\n\r\nThe committee quickly pointed out that the Army had neglected to\r\nsubtract from the monthly figure of 11,000 blacks those physically and\r\nmentally disqualified (those who scored below eighty) and those in\r\nschool. Using the Army's own figures and taking into account these\r\ndeductions, the committee predicted that Negroes would account for\r\n10.6 percent of the men accepted in the 8,000 monthly intake, probably\r\nat the GCT eighty level, or 5 percent of the 6,000 men estimated\r\nacceptable at the GCT ninety level.[14-125]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-125: Memo, Kenworthy for Karl Bendetsen,\r\n                   19 Oct 49, sub: Manpower Policy, Fahy Papers,\r\n                   Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nOn 14 December 1949 the Army, offering to compromise on the quota,\r\nretired from its statistical battle with the committee. It would\r\naccept the unlimited enlistment of Negroes scoring 100 or better,\r\nlimiting the number of those accepted below 100 so that the total\r\nblack strength would remain at 10 percent of the Army's\r\npopulation.[14-126] Attractive to the committee because it would\r\nprovide for the enlistment of qualified men at the expense of the less\r\nable, the proposal was nevertheless rejected because it still insisted\r\nupon a racial quota. Again there was a difference between the\r\ncommittee and the Army, but again the advantage lay with the\r\ncommittee, for the White House was anxious for the quota problem to be\r\nsolved.[14-127]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-126: Memo for Rcd, Kenworthy, 14 Dec 49,\r\n                   sub: Conference With Maj Lieblich and Col Smith, 14\r\n                   Dec 49, FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-127: Memo, Fahy for President's Cmte, 1\r\n                   Feb 50, Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nNiles warned the President that the racial imbalance which had for so\r\nlong frustrated equal treatment and opportunity for Negroes in the\r\nArmy would continue despite the Army's new assignment policy unless\r\nthe Army was able to raise the quality of its black enlistees. Niles\r\nconsidered the committee's proposal doubly attractive because, while\r\nit abolished the quota, it would also raise the level of black\r\nrecruits. The proposal was sensible and fair, Niles added, and he\r\nbelieved it would reduce the number of black soldiers as it raised\r\ntheir quality. It had been used successfully by the Navy and Air\r\nForce, and, as it had in those services, would provide for the gradual\r\ndissolution of the all-black units rather than a precipitous\r\nchange.[14-128] The Army staff did not agree, and as late as 28\r\nFebruary 1950 the Director of Personnel and Administration was\r\nrecommending that the Army retain the racial quota at least for all\r\nNegroes scoring below 110 on the classification test.[14-129]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-128: Ltr, Niles to President, 7 Feb 50,\r\n                   Secretary's File (PSF), Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-129: D/PA Summary Sheet for SA, 28 Feb\r\n                   50, sub: Fahy Committee Proposal re: Numerical\r\n                   Enlistment Quota, CSGPA 291.2 (2 Nov 49).]\r\n\r\nSecretary Gray, aware that the Army's arguments would not move the\r\ncommittee, was sure that the President did not want to see a\r\nspectacular and precipitous rise in the Army's black strength. He\r\ndecided on a personal appeal to the Commander in Chief.[14-130] The\r\nArmy would drop the racial quota, he told Truman on 1 March, with  (p. 374)\r\none proviso: \"If, as a result of a fair trial of this new system,\r\nthere ensues a disproportionate balance of racial strengths in the\r\nArmy, it is my understanding that I have your authority to return to a\r\nsystem which will, in effect, control enlistments by race.\"[14-131]\r\nThe President agreed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-130: Interv, Nichols with Gray.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-131: Ltr, SA to President, 1 Mar 50, Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nAt the President's request, Gray outlined a program for open\r\nrecruitment, fixing April as the date when all vacancies would be open\r\nto all qualified individuals. Gray wanted to handle the changes in\r\nroutine fashion. With the committee's concurrence, he planned no\r\npublic announcement. From his vacation quarters in Key West, Truman\r\nadded a final encouraging word: \"I am sure that everything will work\r\nout as it should.\"[14-132] The order opening recruiting to all races\r\nwent out on 27 March 1950.[14-133]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-132: Memo, President for SA, 27 Mar 50,\r\n                   FC file; Memo, SA for President, 24 Mar 50, sub:\r\n                   Discontinuance of Racial Enlistment Quotas, copy in\r\n                   CSGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-133: Msg, TAG to Chief, AFF, et al., Fort\r\n                   Monroe, Va., WCL 44600, 27 Mar 50, copy in FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\nDespite the President's optimism, the Fahy Committee was beginning to\r\nhave doubts about just how everything would work out. Specifically,\r\nsome members were wondering how they could be sure the Army would\r\ncomply with the newly approved policies. Such concern was reasonable,\r\ndespite the Army's solemn commitments, when one considers the\r\ncommittee's lengthening experience with the Defense Department's\r\nbureaucracy and its familiarity with the liabilities of the Gillem\r\nBoard policy. The committee decided, therefore, to include in its\r\nfinal report to the President a request for the retention of a\r\nwatchdog group to review service practices. In this its views clashed\r\ndirectly with those of Secretary Johnson, who wanted the President to\r\nabolish the committee and make him solely responsible for the equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity program.[14-134]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-134: Memo, Clark Clifford for President\r\n                   (ca. Mar 50), Nash Collection, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nNiles, anxious to settle the issue, tried to reconcile the\r\ndifferences[14-135] and successfully persuaded the committee to omit a\r\nreference in its final report to a successor group to review the\r\nservices' progress. Such a move, he told Kenworthy, would imply that,\r\nunless policed, the services would not carry out their programs.\r\nPublic discussion about how long the committee was to remain in effect\r\nwould also tend to tie the President's hands. Niles suggested instead\r\nthat the committee members discuss the matter with the President when\r\nthey met with him to submit their final report and perhaps suggest\r\nthat a watchdog group be appointed or their committee be retained on a\r\nstandby basis for a later review of service actions.[14-136] Before\r\nthe committee met with the President on 22 May, Niles recommended to\r\nTruman that he make no commitment on a watchdog group.[14-137]\r\nPrivately, Niles agreed with Clark Clifford that the committee should\r\nbe retained for an indefinite period, but on an advisory rather than\r\nan operating basis so that, in Clifford's words, \"it will be in a\r\nposition to see that there is not a gap between policy and an      (p. 375)\r\nadministration of policy in the Defense Establishment.\"[14-138]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-135: Interv, author with Kenworthy.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-136: Memo, Kenworthy for Fahy, 28 Apr 50,\r\n                   Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-137: Ltr, Niles to President, 22 May 50,\r\n                   Nash Collection, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-138: Memo, Clifford for President, Nash\r\n                   Collection, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nThe President proceeded along these lines. Several months after the\r\ncommittee presented its final report, _Freedom to Serve_,[14-139] in a\r\npublic ceremony, Truman relieved the group of its assignment.\r\nCommenting that the services should have the opportunity to work out\r\nin detail the new policies and procedures initiated by the committee,\r\nhe told Fahy on 6 July 1950 that he would leave his order in effect,\r\nnoting that \"at some later date, it may prove desirable to examine the\r\neffectuation of your Committee's recommendations, which can be done\r\nunder Executive Order 9981.\"[14-140]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-139: _Freedom to Serve: Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services; A\r\n                   Report by the President's Committee_ (Washington:\r\n                   Government Printing Office, 1950).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-140: Ltr, President to Fahy, 6 Jul 50,\r\n                   Fahy Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Assessment_\r\n\r\nThus ended a most active period in the history of armed forces\r\nintegration, a period of executive orders, presidential conferences,\r\nand national hearings, of administrative infighting broadcast to the\r\npublic in national headlines. The Fahy Committee was the focus of this\r\nbureaucratic and journalistic excitement. Charged with examining the\r\npolicies of the services in light of the President's order, the\r\ncommittee could have glanced briefly at current racial practices and\r\nautomatically ratified Secretary Johnson's general policy statement.\r\nIndeed, this was precisely what Walter White and other civil rights\r\nleaders expected. But the committee was made of sterner stuff. With\r\ndedication and with considerable political acumen, it correctly\r\nassessed the position of black servicemen and subjected the racial\r\npolicies of the services to a rigorous and detailed examination, the\r\nfirst to be made by an agency outside the Department of Defense. As a\r\nresult of this scrutiny, the committee clearly and finally\r\ndemonstrated that segregation was an inefficient way to use military\r\nmanpower; once and for all it demolished the arguments that the\r\nservices habitually used against any demand for serious change. Most\r\nimportant is the fact that the committee kept alive the spirit of\r\nreform the Truman order had created. The committee's definition of\r\nequal treatment and opportunity became the standard by which future\r\naction on racial issues in the armed forces would be measured.\r\n\r\nThroughout its long existence, the Fahy Committee was chiefly\r\nconcerned with the position of the Negro in the Army. After protracted\r\nargument it won from the Army an agreement to abolish the racial quota\r\nand to open all specialties in all Army units and all Army schools and\r\ncourses to qualified Negroes. Finally, it won the Army's promise to\r\ncease restricting black servicemen to black units and overhead\r\ninstallations alone and to assign them instead on the basis of\r\nindividual ability and the Army's need.\r\n\r\nAs for the other services, the committee secured from the Navy a\r\npledge to give petty officer status to chief stewards and stewards of\r\nthe first, second, and third class, and its influence was discernible\r\nin the Navy's decision to allow stewards to transfer to the general\r\nservice. The committee also made, and the Navy accepted, several\r\npractical suggestions that might lead to an increase in the number (p. 376)\r\nof black officers and enlisted men. The committee approved the Air\r\nForce integration program and publicized the success of this major\r\nreform as it was carried out during 1949; for the benefit of the\r\nreluctant Army, the committee could point to the demonstrated ability\r\nof black servicemen and the widespread acceptance of integration among\r\nthe rank and file of the Air Force. In regard to the Marine Corps,\r\nhowever, the committee was forced to acknowledge that the corps had\r\nnot yet \"fully carried out Navy policy.\"[14-141]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-141: _Freedom to Serve_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe Fahy Committee won from the services a commitment to equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity and a practical program to achieve that end.\r\nYet even with this victory and the strong support of many senior\r\nmilitary officials, the possibility that determined foes of\r\nintegration might erect roadblocks or that simple bureaucratic inertia\r\nwould delay progress could not be discounted. There was, for example,\r\nnothing in the postwar practices of the Marine Corps, even the\r\ntemporary integration of its few black recruits during basic training,\r\nthat hinted at any long-range intention of adopting the Navy's\r\nintegration program. And the fate of one of the committee's major\r\nrecommendations, that all the services adopt equal enlistment\r\nstandards, had yet to be decided. The acceptance of this\r\nrecommendation hinged on the results of a Defense Department study to\r\ndetermine the jobs in each service that could be filled by men in the\r\nlowest mental classification category acceptable to all three\r\nservices. Although the Navy and the Air Force had agreed to reexamine\r\nthe matter, they had consistently opposed the application of\r\nenlistment parity in the past, and the Secretary of Defense's\r\nPersonnel Policy Board had indorsed their position. Secretary\r\nForrestal, himself, had rejected the concept, and there was nothing in\r\nthe record to suggest that his successor would do otherwise. Yet the\r\nparity of enlistment standards was a vital part of the committee's\r\nargument for the abolition of the Army's racial quota. If enlistment\r\nstandards were not equalized, especially in a period when the Army was\r\nturning to Selective Service for much of its manpower, the number of\r\nmen in the Army's categories IV and V was bound to increase, and that\r\nincrease would provide strong justification for reviving the racial\r\nquota. The Army staff was aware, if the public was not, that a\r\nresurrected quota was possible, for the President had given the\r\nSecretary of the Army authority to take such action if there was \"a\r\ndisproportionate balance of racial strengths.\"[14-142]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-142: Ltr, SA to President, 1 Mar 50, Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library.]\r\n\r\nThe Army's concern with disproportionate balance was always linked to\r\na concern with the influx of men, mostly black, who scored poorly on\r\nthe classification tests. The problem, the Army repeatedly claimed,\r\nwas not the quantity of black troops but their quality. Yet at the\r\ntime the Army agreed to the committee's demand to drop the quota, some\r\n40 percent of all black soldiers scored below eighty. These men could\r\nrarely profit from the Army's agreement to integrate all specialist\r\ntraining and assignments. The committee, aware of the problem, had\r\nstrongly urged the Army to refuse reenlistment, with few exceptions,\r\nto anyone scoring below eighty. On 11 May 1950 Fahy reminded Secretary\r\nof the Army Frank Pace, Jr., that despite the Army's promise to\r\neliminate its low scorers it continued to reenlist men scoring     (p. 377)\r\nless than seventy.[14-143] But by July even the test score for\r\nfirst-time enlistment into the Army had declined to seventy because\r\nmen were needed for the Korean War. The law required that whenever\r\nSelective Service began drafting men the Army would automatically\r\nlower its enlistment standards to seventy. Thus, despite the\r\ncommittee's recommendations, the concentration of low-scoring Negroes\r\nin the lower grades continued to increase, creating an even greater\r\npool of men incapable of assignment to the schools and specialties\r\nopen without regard to race.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-143: Memo, Fahy for SA, 11 May 50, Fahy\r\n                   Papers, Truman Library.

By July 1950, the\r\nlast month of the Fahy Committee's life, the Army had added only seven\r\nmore specialties with openings for Negroes to the list of forty\r\npublished seven months before at the time of its agreement with the\r\ncommittee. In a pessimistic mood, Kenworthy confessed to Judge     (p. 378)\r\nFahy[14-144] that \"so long as additions are not progressively made to\r\nthe critical list of MOS in which Negroes can serve, and so long as\r\nsegregated units continue to be the rule, all MOS and schools can not\r\nbe said to be open to Negroes because Negro units do not have calls\r\nfor many of the advanced MOS.\" Kenworthy was also disturbed because\r\nthe Army had disbanded the staff agency created to monitor the new\r\npolicies and make future recommendations and had transferred both its\r\ntwo members to other duties. In the light of progress registered in\r\nthe half year since the Army had adopted the committee's proposal,\r\nKenworthy concluded that \"the Army intends to do as little as possible\r\ntowards implementing the policy which it adopted and published.\"[14-145]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-144: President Truman appointed Charles\r\n                   Fahy to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the\r\n                   District of Columbia on 15 October 1949. Fahy did\r\n                   not assume his judicial duties, however, until 15\r\n                   December after concluding his responsibilities as a\r\n                   member of the American delegation to the United\r\n                   Nations General Assembly.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-145: Memo, Kenworthy for Fahy, 25 Jul 50,\r\n                   Fahy Papers, Truman Library. In the memorandum the\r\n                   number of additional specialties is erroneously\r\n                   given as six; see DCSPER Summary Sheet, 23 Apr 50,\r\n                   sub: List of Critical Specialties Referred to in SR\r\n                   600-629-1, G-1 291.2 (25 Oct 49).]\r\n\r\nRoy Davenport later suggested that such pessimism was ill-founded.\r\nOther factors were at work within the Army in 1950, particularly after\r\nthe outbreak of war in Korea.[14-146] Davenport alluded principally to\r\nthe integration of basic training centers and the assignment of\r\ngreater numbers of black inductees to combat specialties--developments\r\nthat were pushing the Army ahead of the integration timetable\r\nenvisioned by committee members and making concern over black\r\neligibility for an increased number of occupation categories less\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-146: Ltr, Davenport to OSD Historian, 31\r\n                   Aug 76, copy in CMH. For a discussion of these\r\n                   war-related factors, see Chapters 14 and 17.]\r\n\r\nThe Fahy Committee has been given full credit for proving that\r\nsegregation could not be defended on grounds of military efficiency,\r\nthereby laying the foundation for the integration of the Army. But\r\nperhaps in the long run the group's idealism proved to be equally\r\nimportant. The committee never lost sight of the moral implications of\r\nthe services' racial policies. Concern for the rightness and wrongness\r\nof things is readily apparent in all its deliberations, and in the end\r\nthe committee would invoke the words of Saint Paul to the Philippians\r\nto remind men who perhaps should have needed no such reminder that\r\nthey should heed \"whatsoever things are true ... whatsoever things are\r\njust.\" What was right and just, the committee concluded, would\r\n\"strengthen the nation.\"[14-147]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-147: _Freedom to Serve_, pp. 66-67.]\r\n\r\nThe same ethics stood forth in the conclusion of the committee's final\r\nreport, raising that practical summary of events to the status of an\r\neloquent state paper. The committee reminded the President and its\r\nfellow citizens that the status of the individual, \"his equal worth in\r\nthe sight of God, his equal protection under the law, his equal rights\r\nand obligations of citizenship and his equal opportunity to make just\r\nand constructive use of his endowment--these are the very foundation\r\nof the American system of values.\"[14-148]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 14-148: _Ibid._, p. 67.]\r\n\r\nTo its lasting honor the Fahy Committee succeeded in spelling out for\r\nthe nation's military leaders how these principles, these \"high\r\nstandards of democracy\" as President Truman called them in his order,\r\nmust be applied in the services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15                                                         (p. 379)\r\n\r\nThe Role of the Secretary of Defense\r\n1949-1951\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving ordered the integration of the services and supported the Fahy\r\nCommittee in the development of acceptable racial programs, President\r\nTruman quickly turned the matter over to his subordinates in the\r\nDepartment of Defense, severing White House ties with the problem.\r\nAgainst the recommendations of some of his White House advisers,\r\nTruman adjourned the committee, leaving his executive order in effect.\r\n\"The necessary programs having been adopted,\" he told Fahy, it was\r\ntime for the services \"to work out in detail the procedures which will\r\ncomplete the steps so carefully initiated by the committee.\"[15-1] In\r\neffect, the President was guaranteeing the services the freedom to put\r\ntheir own houses in order.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-1: Ltr, Truman to Fahy, 6 Jul 50, FC\r\n                   file.]\r\n\r\nThe issue of civil rights, however, was still of vital interest to one\r\nof the President's major constituencies. Black voters, recognized as a\r\ndecisive factor in the November 1948 election, pressed their demands\r\non the victorious President; in particular some of their spokesmen\r\ncalled on the administration to implement fully the program put forth\r\nby the Fahy Committee. These demands were being echoed in Congress by\r\na civil rights bloc--for bloc it had now become in the wake of the\r\nelection that sent Harry Truman back to the White House. No longer the\r\nconcern of a congressman or two, the cause of the black serviceman was\r\nnow supported by a group of politicians who, joining with civil rights\r\nleaders, pressed the Department of Defense for rapid changes in its\r\nracial practices.\r\n\r\nThe traditionalists in the armed forces also had congressional allies.\r\nIn all probability these legislators would accept an integrated Navy\r\nbecause it involved relatively few Negroes; they might even tolerate\r\nan integrated Air Force because they lacked a proprietary attitude\r\ntoward this new service; but they would fight to keep the Army\r\nsegregated because they considered the Army their own.[15-2]\r\nCongressional segregationists openly opposed changes in the Army's\r\nracial policy only when they thought the time was right. They carefully\r\navoided the subject in the months following publication of the     (p. 380)\r\nexecutive order, waiting to bargain until their support became crucial\r\nto the success of such vital military legislation as the renewal of\r\nthe Selective Service Act and the establishment of universal military\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-2: Interv, Nichols with Gen Wade H.\r\n                   Haislip, 1953, in Nichols Collection; Telephone\r\n                   Interv, author with Haislip, 18 Mar 71; Interv,\r\n                   author with Martin Blumenson, 8 Jan 68. All in CMH\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nAt most, Congress played only a minor role in the dramatic changes\r\nbeginning in the armed forces. Champions of civil rights had little\r\neffect on service practices, although these congressmen channeled the\r\ncomplaints of black voters and kept the military traditionalists on\r\nthe defensive. As for the congressional traditionalists, their support\r\nmay have helped sustain those on the staff who resisted racial change\r\nwithin the Army, thus slowing down that service's integration. But the\r\ndemands of congressional progressives and obstructionists tended to\r\ncancel each other out, and in the wake of the Fahy Committee's\r\ndisbandment the services themselves reemerged as the preeminent factor\r\nin the armed forces racial program.\r\n\r\nThe services regained control by default. Logically, direction of\r\nracial reforms in the services should have fallen to the Secretary of\r\nDefense. In the first place, the secretary, other administration\r\nofficials, and the public alike had begun to use the secretary's\r\noffice as a clearinghouse for reconciling conflicting demands of the\r\nservices, as an appellate court reviewing decisions of the service\r\nsecretaries, and as the natural channel of communication between the\r\nservices and the White House, Congress, and the public. Many racial\r\nproblems had become interservice in nature, and only the Office of the\r\nSecretary of Defense possessed the administrative machinery to deal\r\nwith such matters. The Personnel Policy Board or, later, the new\r\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and\r\nPersonnel might well have become the watchdog recommended by the Fahy\r\nCommittee to oversee the services' progress toward integration, but\r\nneither did.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Secretary of Defense had other matters pressing for his\r\nattention. Secretary Johnson had become the central character in the\r\nbudgetary conflicts of Truman's second term, and both he and General\r\nGeorge C. Marshall, who succeeded him as secretary on 20 September\r\n1950, were suddenly thrust into leadership of the Korean War. In\r\nadministrative matters, at least, Marshall had to concentrate on\r\nboosting the morale of a department torn by internecine budgetary\r\narguments. Integration did not appear to have the same importance to\r\nnational security as these weighty matters. More to the point, Johnson\r\nand Marshall were not social reformers. Whatever their personal\r\nattitudes, they were content to let the services set the pace of\r\nracial reform. With one notable exception neither man initiated any of\r\nthe historic racial changes that took place in the armed forces during\r\nthe early 1950's.\r\n\r\nFor the most part those racial issues that did involve the Secretary\r\nof Defense centered on the status of the Negro in the armed forces in\r\ngeneral and were extraneous to the issue of integration. One of the\r\nmost persistent status problems was classification by race. First\r\nposed during the great World War II draft calls, the question of how\r\nto determine a serviceman's race, and indeed the related one of who\r\nhad the right to make such a determination, remained unanswered five\r\nyears later. In August 1944 the Selective Service System decided   (p. 381)\r\nthat the definition of a man's race should be left to the man himself.\r\nWhile this solution no doubt pleased racial progressives and certainly\r\nsimplified the induction process, not to speak of protecting the War\r\nDepartment from a ticklish court review, it still left the services\r\nthe difficult and important task of designating racial categories into\r\nwhich men could be assigned. As late as April 1949 the Army and the\r\nAir Force listed a number of specific racial categories, one of which\r\nhad to be chosen by the applicant or recruiter--the regulation left\r\nthe point unclear--to identify the applicant's race. The regulation\r\nlisted \"white, Negro, Indian (referring to American Indian only),\r\nPuerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, East\r\nIndian, etc.,\" and specifically included mulattoes and \"others of\r\nnegroid race or extraction\" in the Negro category, leaving other men\r\nof mixed race to be entered under their predominant race.[15-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-3: SR 615-105-1 (AFR 39-9), 15 Apr 49.]\r\n\r\nThe regulation was obviously subject to controversy, and in the wake\r\nof the President's equality order it is not surprising that some\r\ngroup--a group of Spanish-speaking Americans from southern California,\r\nas it turned out--would raise the issue. Specifically, they objected\r\nto a practice of Army and Air Force recruiters, who often scratched\r\nout \"white\" and inserted \"Mexican\" in the applications of\r\nSpanish-speaking volunteers. These young men wanted to be integrated\r\ninto every phase of community life, Congressman Chet Holifield told\r\nthe Secretary of Defense, and he passed on a warning from his\r\nCalifornia constituents that \"any attempt to forestall this ambition\r\nby treating them as a group apart is extremely repellent to them and\r\ngives rise to demoralization and hostility.\"[15-4] If the Department\r\nof Defense considered racial information essential, Holifield\r\ncontinued, why not make the determination in a less objectionable\r\nmanner? He suggested a series of questions concerning the birthplace\r\nof the applicant's parents and the language spoken in his home as\r\ninnocuous possibilities.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-4: Ltr, Holifield to SecDef, 10 Aug 49,\r\n                   SD 291.2 Negroes.]\r\n\r\nSecretary Johnson sent the congressman's complaint to the Personnel\r\nPolicy Board, which, ignoring the larger considerations posed by\r\nHolifield, concentrated on simplifying the department's racial\r\ncategories to five--Caucasian, Negroid, Mongolian, Indian (American),\r\nand Malayan--and making their use uniform throughout the services. The\r\nboard also adopted the use of inoffensive questions to help determine\r\nthe applicant's proper race category. Obviously, the board could not\r\nabandon racial designations because the Army's quota system, still in\r\neffect, depended on this information. Less clear, however, was why the\r\nboard failed to consider the problem of who should make the racial\r\ndetermination. At any rate, its new list of racial categories,\r\napproved by the secretary and published on 11 October, immediately\r\ndrew complaints from members of the department.[15-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-5: Memo, Dep Dir, Personnel Policy Bd\r\n                   Staff, for Chmn, PPB, 13 Sep 49, sub: Project\r\n                   Summary--Change of Nomenclature on Enlistment Forms\r\n                   as Pertains to \"Race\" Entries (M-63); Memo, Chmn,\r\n                   PPB, for SA et al., 11 Oct 49, sub: Policy\r\n                   Regarding Race Entries on Enlistment Contracts and\r\n                   Shipping Articles; both in PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAVY CORPSMAN IN KOREA _attends wounded from the 1st\r\nMarine Division, 1950_.]\r\n\r\nThe secretary's racial adviser, James C. Evans, saw no need for    (p. 382)\r\nracial designations on departmental forms, but knowing their removal\r\nwas unlikely in the near future, he concentrated on trying to change\r\nthe newly revised categories. He explained to the board, obviously\r\nunschooled in the nuance of racial slurs, that the word \"Negroid\" was\r\noffensive to many Negroes. Besides, the board's categories made no\r\nsense since Indian (American) and Malayan were not comparable to the\r\nother three entries listed. Why not, he suggested, settle for the old\r\nblack, white, yellow, red, and brown designations?[15-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-6: Memo, Evans for Chmn, PPB, 25 Nov 49,\r\n                   sub: Racial Designation and Terminology, SD 291.2;\r\n                   Interv, author with Evans, 22 Jul 71, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy, too, objected to the board's categories. After consulting a\r\nSmithsonian ethnologist, the Under Secretary of the Navy suggested\r\nthat the board create a sixth category, Polynesian, for use in\r\nshipping articles and in forms for reporting casualties. The Army,\r\nalso troubled by the categories, requested they be defined. The\r\ncategories were meant to provide a uniform basis for classifying\r\nmilitary personnel, The Adjutant General pointed out, but given the\r\nvariety and complexity of Army forms--he had discovered that the Army\r\nwas using seven separate forms with racial entries, each with a\r\ndifferent procedure for deciding race--uniformity was practically  (p. 383)\r\nimpossible without a careful delineation of each category.[15-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-7: Memo, Head, Strength and Statistics\r\n                   Br, BuPers, for Head, Policy Control Br, BuPers, 27\r\n                   Oct 49, sub: Policy Regarding Race Entries, Pers\r\n                   25-EL, BuPersRecs; Memo, Under SecNav for Chmn,\r\n                   PPB, 25 Nov 49, sub: Policy Regarding \"Race\"\r\n                   Entries on Enlistment Contracts and Shipping\r\n                   Articles, GenRecsNav; DF, D/P&A to TAG, 18 Oct 49,\r\n                   same sub, with CMT 2, TAG to D/P&A, 2 Nov 49, copy\r\n                   in AG 291.2 (11 Oct 49).]\r\n\r\nIts ruling under attack from the services, the board made a hasty\r\nappeal to authority. Its chief of staff, Vice Adm. John L.\r\nMcCrea,[15-8] recommended that the Army and Navy consult Funk and\r\nWagnalls _Standard Dictionary_ for specific definitions of the five\r\nracial categories. That source, the admiral explained to the Under\r\nSecretary of the Navy, listed Polynesian in the Malayan category, and\r\nif the Navy decided to add race to its shipping articles, the five\r\ncategories should be sufficient. The board, he added, had not meant to\r\nencourage additional use of racial information. The Navy had always\r\nused the old color categories on its shipping articles forms, the\r\nones, incidentally, favored by Evans, and McCrea thought they\r\ngenerally corresponded to the categories developed by the board.[15-9]\r\nThe admiral also suggested that the Army use the color system to help\r\nclarify the board's categories. He offered some generalizations on\r\nspecific Army questions: \"a) Puerto Ricans are officially Caucasian,\r\nunless of Indian or Negro birth; b) Filipinos are Malayan; c)\r\nHawaiians are Malayan; d) Latin Americans are Caucasian or Indian; and\r\ne) Indian-Negro and White-Negro mixtures should be classified in\r\naccordance with the laws of the states of their birth.\"[15-10] The\r\nlessons on definition of race so painfully learned during World War II\r\nwere ignored. Henceforth race was to be determined by a dictionary, a\r\ncolor scheme, and the legal vagaries found in the race laws of the\r\nseveral states.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-8: Admiral McCrea succeeded General\r\n                   Lanham as director of the board's staff in 1949.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-9: Memo, Dir, PPB Staff, for Under\r\n                   SecNav, 7 Dec 49, sub: Policy Regarding \"Race\"\r\n                   Entries on Enlistment Contracts and Shipping\r\n                   Articles, PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-10: Idem for Administrative Asst to SA, 8\r\n                   Dec 49, sub: Policy Regarding \"Race\" Entries on\r\n                   Enlistment Contracts and Shipping Articles, OSA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe board's rulings, unscientific and open to all sorts of legal\r\ncomplications, could only be stopgap measures, and when on 4 January\r\n1950 the Army again requested clarification of the racial categories,\r\nthe board quickly responded. Although it continued to defend the use\r\nof racial categories, it tried to soften the ruling by stating that an\r\napplicant's declaration of race should be accepted, subject to\r\n\"sufficient justification\" from the applicant when his declaration\r\ncreated \"reason to doubt.\" It was 5 April before the board's new\r\nchairman, J. Thomas Schneider,[15-11] issued a revised directive to\r\nthis effect.[15-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-11: Schneider succeeded Thomas Reid as\r\n                   chairman on 2 February 1950.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-12: Memo, Chmn, PPB, for SA et al., 5 Apr\r\n                   50, sub: Policy Regarding \"Race\" on Enlistment\r\n                   Contracts and Shipping Articles, PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe board's decision to accept an applicant's declaration was simply a\r\nreturn to the reasonable and practical method the Selective Service\r\nhad been using for some time. But adopting the vague qualification\r\n\"sufficient justification\" invited further complaints. When the\r\nservices finally translated the board's directive into a new\r\nregulation, the role of the applicant in deciding his racial identity\r\nwas practically abolished. In the Army and the Air Force, for      (p. 384)\r\nexample, recruiters had to submit all unresolved identity cases to the\r\nhighest local commander, whose decision, supposedly based on available\r\ndocumentary evidence and answers to the questions first suggested by\r\nCongressman Holifield, was final. Further, the Army and the Air Force\r\ndecided that \"no enlistment would be accomplished\" until racial\r\nidentity was decided to the satisfaction of both the applicant and the\r\nservice.[15-13] The Navy adopted a similar procedure when it placed\r\nthe board's directive in effect.[15-14] The new regulation promised\r\nlittle comfort for young Americans of racially mixed parentage and\r\neven less for the services. Contrary to the intent of the Personnel\r\nPolicy Board, its directive once again placed the burden of deciding\r\nan applicant's race, with the concomitant complaints and potential\r\ncivil suits, back on the services.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-13: SR 615-105-1 (AFR 39-9), 6 Sep 50.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-14: BuPers Cir Ltr 84-50, 1 Jun 50.]\r\n\r\nAt the time the Army did not see this responsibility as a burden and\r\nin its quest for uniformity was willing to assume an even greater\r\nshare of the decision-making in a potentially explosive issue. On 7\r\nAugust the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff, G-1, asked the Personnel\r\nPolicy Board to include Army induction centers in the directive meant\r\noriginally for recruiting centers only.[15-15] In effect the Army was\r\noffering to assume from Selective Service the task of deciding the\r\nrace of all draftees. The board obtained the necessary agreement from\r\nMaj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, and Selective Service was thus relieved of\r\nan onerous task reluctantly acquired in 1944. On 29 August 1950 The\r\nAdjutant General ordered induction stations to begin entering the\r\ndraftee's race in the records.[15-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-15: Memo, Dep Asst CS/G-1 for Dep Dir of\r\n                   Staff, Mil Pers, PPB, 7 Aug 50, sub: \"Race\" Entries\r\n                   on Induction Records, PPB 291.2.

The simplified racial categories and the regulations\r\ndetermining their application continued to irritate members of\r\nAmerica's several minority groups. The ink was hardly dry on the new\r\nregulation, for example, before the director of the NAACP's Washington\r\nbureau was complaining to Secretary of the Air Force Thomas K.\r\nFinletter that the department's five categories were comparatively\r\nmeaningless and caused unnecessary humiliation for inductees. He\r\nwanted racial entries eliminated.[15-17] Finletter explained that\r\nracial designations were not used for assignment or administrative\r\npurposes but solely for evaluating the integration program and\r\nanswering questions from the public. His explanation prompted much\r\ndiscussion within the services and correspondence between them and\r\nClarence Mitchell and Walter White of the NAACP. It culminated in a\r\nmeeting of the service secretaries with the Secretary of Defense   (p. 385)\r\non 16 January 1951 at which Finletter reaffirmed his position.[15-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-17: Ltr, Clarence Mitchell to SecAF\r\n                   Thomas K.

Still, not all\r\nthe reasons for retaining the racial identification entry were so\r\ndefensible. The Army, for example, had to maintain accurate statistics\r\non the number of Negroes inducted because of its concern with a\r\npossible unacceptable rise in their number and the President's promise\r\nto reimpose the quota to prevent such an increase. Whatever the\r\nreasons, it was obvious that racial statistics had to be kept. It was\r\nalso obvious that as long as they were kept and continued to matter,\r\nthe Secretary of Defense would be saddled with the task of deciding in\r\nthe end which racial tag to attach to each man in the armed forces. It\r\nwas an unenviable duty, and it could be performed with neither\r\nprecision nor justice.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-19: Memo, Dep Asst SecAF (Program\r\n                   Management) for SecAF, 18 Jan 51, SecAF files;\r\n                   Memo, Col Robin B.

The problem was not new. Making a distinction in cases where\r\nAmerican troops were stationed in a country at the request of the\r\nUnited States government, the services excluded black troops from\r\nassignment in some Allied countries during and immediately after World\r\nWar II.[15-20] The Army, for example, barred the assignment of black\r\nunits to China (the Chinese government did not object to assignment of\r\nindividual black soldiers up to 15 percent of any unit's strength),\r\nand the Navy removed black messmen from stations in Iceland.[15-21]\r\nAlthough these restrictions did not improve the racial image of the\r\nservices, they were only a minor inconvenience to military officials\r\nsince Negroes were for the most part segregated and their placement\r\ncould be controlled easily. The armed forces continued to exclude\r\nblack servicemen from certain countries into 1949 under what the\r\nPersonnel Policy Board called \"operating agreements (probably not in\r\nwriting)\" with the State Department.[15-22] But the situation changed\r\nradically when some of the services started to integrate. Efficient\r\nadministration then demanded that black servicemen be interchanged (p. 386)\r\nfreely among the various duty stations. Even in the case of the still\r\nsegregated Army the exclusion of Negroes from certain commands further\r\ncomplicated the chronic maldistribution of black soldiers throughout\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-20: Memo, Secy, Cmte on Negro Policies,\r\n                   for ASW, 26 Sep 42, sub: Digest of War Department\r\n                   Policy Pertaining to Negro Military Personnel, ASW\r\n                   291.2 Negro Troops.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-21: Msg, CG, China Theater, to War\r\n                   Department, 16 Mar 46, G-1 291.2 (1 Jan-31 Mar 46);\r\n                   Memo Vice CNO for Chief of NavPers, 1 Jul 42, sub:\r\n                   Colored Personnel on Duty in Iceland--Replacement\r\n                   of, P-14, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-22: Memo, Thomas R.

Following promulgation of his directive\r\non racial equality and at the instigation of his Personnel Policy\r\nBoard and his assistant, Najeeb Halaby, Johnson asked the Secretary of\r\nState for a formal expression of views on the use of black troops in a\r\nlengthy list of countries.[15-23] Such an expression was clearly\r\nnecessary, as Air Force spokesmen pointed out. Informed of the\r\nconsultations, Assistant Secretary Zuckert asked that an interim\r\npolicy be formulated, so urgent had the problem become in the Air\r\nForce where new racial policies and assignments were under way.[15-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-23: Ltr, SecDef to Secy of State, 14 Sep\r\n                   49, CD 30-1-4, SecDef files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-24: Memo, Asst SecAF for Chmn, PPB, 16\r\n                   Sep 49, sub: Assignment of Negroes to Overseas\r\n                   Areas; Memo, Dir of Staff, PPB, for Asst SecAF, 28\r\n                   Sep 49, same sub; Memo, Asst SecAF for Chmn, PPB,\r\n                   12 Oct 49, same sub. All in SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nFor his part the Secretary of State had no objection to stationing\r\nNegroes in any of the listed countries. In fact, Under Secretary James\r\nE. Webb assured Johnson, the State Department welcomed the new Defense\r\nDepartment policy of equal treatment and opportunity as a step toward\r\nthe achievement of the nation's foreign policy objectives. At the same\r\ntime Webb admitted that there were certain countries--he listed\r\nspecifically Iceland, Greenland, Canada, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and\r\nBritish possessions in the Caribbean--where local attitudes might\r\naffect the morale of black troops and their relations with the\r\ninhabitants. The State Department, therefore, preferred advance\r\nwarning when the services planned to assign Negroes to these countries\r\nso that it might consult the host governments and reduce \"possible\r\ncomplications\" to a minimum.[15-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-25: Ltr, James E.

In the first place the\r\nState Department decided not to restrict its list of excepted areas to\r\nthe six mentioned. While it had no objection to the assignment of\r\nindividual Negroes or nonsegregated units to Panama, the department\r\ninformally advised the Army in December 1949, it did interpose grave\r\nobjections to the assignment of black units.[15-26] Accordingly, only\r\nindividual Negroes were assigned to temporary units in the Panama\r\nCommand.[15-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-26: DF, D/PA to D/OT, 1 Mar 50, sub:\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower; Ltr, D/PA for Maj\r\n                   Gen Ray E.

Yet the corps was\r\nreluctant to change the system.[15-28] An Air Force objection was  (p. 387)\r\nmore pointed. General Edwards worried that the restrictions were\r\nbecoming public knowledge and would probably cause adverse criticism\r\nof the Air Force. He wanted the State Department to negotiate with the\r\ncountries concerned to lift the restrictions or at least to establish\r\na clear-cut, defensible policy. Secretary Symington discussed the\r\nmatter with Secretary of Defense Johnson, and Halaby, knowing Deputy\r\nUnder Secretary of State Dean Rusk's particular interest in having men\r\nassigned without regard to race, agreed to take the matter up with\r\nRusk.[15-29] Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews reminded\r\nJohnson that black servicemen already numbered among the thousands of\r\nNavy men assigned to four of the six areas mentioned, and if the\r\nsystem continued these men would periodically and routinely be\r\nreplaced with other black sailors. Should the Navy, he wanted to know,\r\nwithdraw these Negroes? Given the \"possible unfavorable reaction\" to\r\ntheir withdrawal, the Navy wanted to keep Negroes in these areas in\r\napproximately their present numbers.[15-30] Both the Fahy Committee\r\nand the Personnel Policy Board made it clear that they too wanted\r\nblack servicemen retained wherever they were currently assigned.[15-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-28: Memo, Dir of Personnel, USMC, for\r\n                   Dir, Div of Plans and Policies, 22 Dec 49, Hist\r\n                   Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-29: Memo, Dep CS/Pers for SecAF, 28 Dec\r\n                   49; Memo, Clarence H.

Burns, Secretary Johnson's assistant for foreign\r\nmilitary affairs, put the matter to the State Department, and James\r\nEvans followed up by discussing it with Rusk. Reassured by these\r\nconsultations, Secretary Johnson issued a more definitive policy\r\nstatement for the services on 5 April explaining that \"the Department\r\nof State endorses the policy of freely assigning Negro personnel or\r\nNegro or non-segregated units to any part of the world to which US\r\nforces are sent; it is prepared to support the desires of the\r\nDepartment of Defense in this respect.\"[15-32] Nevertheless, since\r\ncertain governments had from time to time indicated an unwillingness\r\nto accept black servicemen, Johnson directed the services to inform\r\nhim in advance when black troops were to be dispatched to countries\r\nwhere no blacks were then stationed so that host countries might be\r\nconsulted. This new statement produced immediate reaction in the\r\nservices. Citing a change in policy, the Air Force issued directives\r\nopening all overseas assignments except Iceland to Negroes. After an\r\nextended discussion on the assignment of black troops to the Trieste\r\n(TRUST) area, the Army followed suit.[15-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-32: Memo, SecDef for SA et al., 5 Apr 50,\r\n                   sub: Foreign Assignment of Negro Personnel; Ltr,\r\n                   Dean Rusk to Maj Gen Burns, 1 Mar 50; Memo, Burns\r\n                   for SecDef, 3 Apr 50.

The Army's G-3, for example, concluded in 1949 that,     (p. 388)\r\nwhile the race of an individual was not a factor in determining\r\neligibility for a mission assignment, the attitude of certain\r\ncountries (he was referring to certain Latin American countries) made\r\nit advisable to inform the host country of the race of the prospective\r\napplicant. For a host country to reject a Negro was undesirable, he\r\nconcluded, but for a Negro to be assigned to a country that did not\r\nwelcome him would be embarrassing to both countries.[15-34] When the\r\nchief of the military mission in Turkey asked the Army staff in 1951\r\nto reconsider assigning black soldiers to Turkey because of the\r\nattitude of the Turks, the Army canceled the assignment.[15-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-34: G-3 Summary Sheet, 15 Nov 49, sub:\r\n                   Assignment of Negro Personnel, G-3 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-35: Msg, Chief, JAMMAT, Ankara, Turkey,\r\n                   to DA, personal for the G-1, 14 Apr 51; Ltr, Brig\r\n                   Gen W.

The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army admitted that\r\nNegroes were barred from Ethiopia, and although documentary evidence\r\ncould not be produced, the ban was thought to have been imposed at the\r\nrequest of the United Nations. The State Department claimed it was\r\nunaware of any such ban, nor could it find documentation to support\r\nthe Army's contention. It objected neither to the assignment of\r\nindividual Negroes to attache and advisory offices in Ethiopia nor to\r\n\"most\" other countries.[15-38] Having received these assurances, the\r\nDepartment of Defense informed the services that \"it was considered\r\nappropriate\" to assign black servicemen to the posts discussed by\r\nCongressman Powell.[15-39] For some time, however, the notion\r\npersisted in the Department of Defense that black troops should not be\r\nassigned to Ethiopia.[15-40] In fact, restrictions and reports of\r\nrestrictions against the assignment of Americans to a number of\r\noverseas posts on grounds of race or religion persisted into the\r\n1970's.[15-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-36: Jack Greenberg, _Race Relations and\r\n                   American Law_ (New York: Columbia University Press,\r\n                   1959), pp. 359-60.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-37: Memo, Dep ASA for ASD/ISA, 6 Feb 57,\r\n                   sub: Racial Assignment Restrictions, OSA 291.2\r\n                   Ethiopia.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-38: Ltr, Dep Asst Secy of State for\r\n                   Personnel to Dep ASD (MP&R), 24 May 57, OASD (MP&R)\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-39: Memo, Dep ASD for ASA (MP&R) et al.,\r\n                   24 Jun 57, ASD (MP&R) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-40: Memo, James C.

In its special preelection session, the Eightieth\r\nCongress ignored the recently issued Truman order on racial equality\r\njust as it ignored the President's admonition to enact a general civil\r\nrights program. But when the new Eighty-first Congress met in January\r\n1949 the subjects of armed forces integration, the Truman order, and\r\nthe Fahy Committee all began to receive attention. Debate on race in\r\nthe services occurred frequently in both houses. Each side appealed to\r\nconstitutional and legal principles to support its case, but the\r\ndiscussions might well have remained a philosophical debate if the\r\ndraft law had not come up for renewal in 1950. The debate focused\r\nmostly on an amendment proposed by Senator Richard B. Russell of\r\nGeorgia that would allow inductees and enlistees, upon their written\r\ndeclaration of intent, to serve in a unit manned exclusively by\r\nmembers of their own race. Russell had made this proposal once before,\r\nbut because it seemed of little consequence to the still largely\r\nsegregated services of 1948 it was ignored. Now in the wake of the\r\nexecutive order and the Fahy Committee Report, the amendment came to\r\nsudden prominence. And when Russell succeeded in discharging the draft\r\nbill with his amendment from the Senate Armed Forces Committee with\r\nthe members' unanimous approval, civil rights supporters quickly   (p. 390)\r\njumped to the attack. Even before the bill was formally introduced on\r\nthe floor, Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon told his colleagues that the\r\nRussell amendment conflicted with the stated policy of the\r\nadministration as well as with sound Republican principles. He cited\r\nthe waste of manpower the amendment would bring about and reminded his\r\ncolleagues of the international criticism the armed forces had endured\r\nin the past because of undemocratic social practices.[15-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-42: _Congressional Record_, 81st Cong.,\r\n                   2d sess., vol. 96, p. 8412.]\r\n\r\nWhen debate began on the amendment, Senator Leverett Saltonstall of\r\nMassachusetts was one of the first to rise in opposition. While\r\nconfessing sympathy for the states' rights philosophy that recognized\r\nthe different customs of various sections of the nation, he branded\r\nthe Russell amendment unnecessary, provocative, and unworkable, and\r\nsuggested Congress leave the services alone in this matter. To support\r\nhis views he read into the record portions of the Fahy Committee\r\nReport, which represented, he emphasized, the judgment of impartial\r\ncivilians appointed by the President, another civilian.[15-43]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-43: Ibid., pp. 8973, 9073.]\r\n\r\nDiscussion of the Russell amendment continued with opponents and\r\ndefenders raising the issues of military efficiency, legality, and\r\nprinciples of equality and states' rights. In the end the amendment\r\nwas defeated 45 to 27 with 24 not voting, a close vote if one\r\nconsiders that the abstentions could have changed the outcome.[15-44]\r\nA similar amendment, this time introduced by Congressman Arthur\r\nWinstead of Mississippi, was also defeated in 1951.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-44: Ibid., p. 9074; see also Memo, Rear\r\n                   Adm H. A. Houser, OSD Legis Liaison, for ASD\r\n                   Rosenberg, 17 Mar 51, sub: Winstead\r\n                   Anti-nonsegregation Amendment, SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Russell amendment was the high point of the congressional fight\r\nagainst armed forces integration. During the next year the\r\nintegrationists took their turn, their barrage of questions and\r\ndemands aimed at obtaining from the Secretary of Defense additional\r\nreforms in the services. On balance, these congressmen were no more\r\neffective than the segregationists. Secretary Johnson had obviously\r\nadopted a hands-off policy on integration.[15-45] Certainly he openly\r\ndiscouraged further public and congressional investigations of the\r\ndepartment's racial practices. When the Committee Against Jim Crow\r\nsought to investigate racial conditions in the Seventh Army in\r\nDecember 1949, Johnson told A. Philip Randolph and Grant Reynolds that\r\nhe could not provide them with military transport, and he closed the\r\ndiscussion by referring the civil rights leaders to the Army's new\r\nspecial regulation on equal opportunity published in January\r\n1950.[15-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-45: See Ltrs, Rep.

All in SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSISTANT SECRETARY ROSENBERG _talks with men of the\r\n140th Medium Tank Battalion during a Far East tour_.]\r\n\r\nJohnson employed much the same technique when Congressman Jacob    (p. 391)\r\nK. Javits of New York, who with several other legislators had become\r\ninterested in the joint congressional-citizen commission proposed by\r\nthe Committee Against Jim Crow, introduced a resolution in the House\r\ncalling for a complete investigation into the racial practices and\r\npolicies of the services by a select House committee.[15-47] Johnson\r\ntried to convince Chairman Adolph J. Sabath of the House Committee on\r\nRules that the new service policies promised equal treatment and\r\nopportunity, again using the new Army regulation to demonstrate how\r\nthese policies were being implemented.[15-48] Once more he succeeded\r\nin diverting the integrationists. The Javits resolution came to\r\nnaught, and although that congressman still harbored some reservations\r\non racial progress in the Army, he nevertheless reprinted an article\r\nfrom _Our World_ magazine in the _Congressional Record_ in April 1950\r\nthat outlined \"the very good progress\" being made by the Secretary (p. 392)\r\nof Defense in the racial field.[15-49] Javits would have no\r\nreason to suspect, but the \"very good progress\" he spoke of had not\r\nissued from the secretary's office. For all practical purposes,\r\nJohnson's involvement in civil rights in the armed forces ended with\r\nhis battle with the Fahy Committee. Certainly in the months after the\r\ncommittee was disbanded he did nothing to push for integration and\r\nallowed the subject of civil rights to languish.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-47: Ltr, Javits to Johnson, 22 Dec 49;\r\n                   Press Release, Jacob K.

Rosenberg as the first Assistant\r\nSecretary of Defense for Manpower and Personnel.[15-50] Rosenberg had\r\nserved on both the Manpower Consulting Committee of the Army and Navy\r\nMunitions Board and the War Manpower Commission and toward the end of\r\nthe war in the European theater as a consultant to General Eisenhower,\r\nwho recommended her to Marshall for the new position.[15-51] She was\r\nencouraged by the secretary to take independent control of the\r\ndepartment's manpower affairs, including racial matters.[15-52] That\r\nshe was well acquainted with integration leaders and sympathetic to\r\ntheir objectives is attested by her correspondence with them. \"Dear\r\nAnna,\" Senator Hubert H. Humphrey wrote in March 1951, voicing\r\nconfidence in her attitude toward segregation, \"I know I speak for\r\nmany in the Senate when I say that your presence with the Department\r\nof Defense is most reassuring.\"[15-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-50: Carl W.

She had to reassure integrationists that the new racial\r\npolicy would be enforced by urging the sometimes reluctant services to\r\ntake further steps toward eliminating discrimination. At the same time\r\nshe had to promote integration and avoid provoking the segregationists\r\nin Congress to retaliate by blocking other defense legislation. The\r\nbill for universal military training was especially important to the\r\ndepartment and to push for its passage was her primary assignment. It\r\nis not surprising, therefore, that she accomplished little in the way\r\nof specific racial reform during the first year of the Korean War.\r\n\r\nSecretary Rosenberg took it upon herself to meet with legislators\r\ninterested in civil rights to outline the department's current\r\nprogress and future plans for guaranteeing equal treatment for black\r\nservicemen. She also arranged for her assistants and Brig. Gen. B. M.\r\nMcFayden, the Army's Deputy G-1, to brief officials of the various\r\ncivil rights organizations on the same subject.[15-54] She had\r\ncongressional complaints and proposals speedily investigated, and  (p. 393)\r\ndemanded from the services periodic progress reports which she issued\r\nto legislators who backed civil rights.[15-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-54: See Memo for Rcd, Maj M.

Reflecting a desire to placate\r\nsegregationist forces in Congress, they did little, for example, to\r\npromote federal protection of servicemen in cases of racial violence\r\noutside the military reservation. The NAACP had been urging the\r\npassage of such legislation for many years, and in March 1951 Clarence\r\nMitchell called Rosenberg's attention to the mistreatment of black\r\nservicemen and their families suffered at the hands of policemen and\r\ncivilians in communities surrounding some military bases.[15-56] At\r\ntimes, Walter White charged, these humiliations and abuses by\r\ncivilians were condoned by military police. He warned that such\r\ntreatment \"can only succeed in adversely affecting the morale of Negro\r\ntroops ... and hamper efforts to secure fullhearted support of the\r\nAmerican Negro for the Government's military and foreign policy\r\nprogram.\"[15-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-56: Ltr, Mitchell to Rosenberg, 26 Mar\r\n                   51, SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-57: Telgs, White to Marshall and SA, 9\r\n                   Jan 51, copy in SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe civil rights leaders had at least some congressional support for\r\ntheir demand. Congressman Abraham J. Multer of New York called on the\r\nArmed Services Committee to include in the 1950 extension of the\r\nSelective Service Act an amendment making attacks on uniformed men and\r\nwomen and discrimination against them by public officials and in\r\npublic places of recreation and interstate travel federal\r\noffenses.[15-58] Focusing on a different aspect of the problem,\r\nSenator Humphrey introduced an amendment to the Senate version of the\r\nbill to protect servicemen detained by public authority against civil\r\nviolence or punishment by extra legal forces. Both amendments were\r\ntabled before final vote on the bill.[15-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-58: _Congressional Record_, 81st Cong.,\r\n                   2d sess., vol. 96, p.

But Marshall was against linking\r\nthe measure to the training bill, which, he explained to Congressman\r\nFranck R. Havenner of California, was of such fundamental importance\r\nthat its passage should not be endangered by consideration of\r\nextraneous issues. He wanted the problem of federal protection\r\nconsidered as a separate piece of legislation.[15-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-60: Memo for Rcd, Maj M. O.

Summing up department\r\npolicy on 1 June, the day after the training bill passed the House,\r\nRosenberg explained that the Department of Defense would not itself\r\npropose any legislation to extend to servicemen the protection\r\nafforded \"civilian employees\" of the federal government but would\r\nsupport such a proposal if it came from \"any other source.\"[15-63]\r\nThis limitation was further defined by Rosenberg's colleagues in the\r\nDefense Department. On 19 June the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\r\nLegal and Legislative Affairs, Daniel K. Edwards, rejected Mitchell's\r\nrequest for help in preparing the language of a bill to protect black\r\nservicemen. Mitchell had explained that discussions with congressional\r\nleaders convinced the NAACP that chances for such legislation were\r\nfavorable, but the Defense Department's Assistant General Counsel\r\ndeclared the department did not ordinarily act \"as a drafting service\r\nfor outside agencies.\"[15-64] In fact, effective legislation to\r\nprotect servicemen off military bases was more than a decade away.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-62: Ltr, Mitchell to Rosenberg, 16 Apr\r\n                   51; Ltr, Rosenberg to Mitchell, 9 May 51; both in\r\n                   SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-63: Memo, ASD (MP&R) for ASD (Legal and\r\n                   Legis Affairs), 14 Jun 51, SD 291.1; PL 51, 82d\r\n                   Congress.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-64: Ltr, Mitchell, Dir, Washington Br,\r\n                   NAACP, to Dir of Industrial Relations, DOD, 25 May\r\n                   51; Ltr, ASD (Legal and Legis Affairs) to Mitchell,\r\n                   19 Jun 51; Memo, Asst Gen Counsel, OSD, for ASD\r\n                   (Legal and Legis Affairs), 19 Jun 51.

For\r\nyears the Army's demand for a parity of enlistment standards had been\r\nopposed by the Navy and the Air Force and had once been rejected by\r\nSecretary Forrestal. Now Rosenberg was able to convince Marshall and\r\nthe armed services committees that in times of manpower shortages the\r\nservices suffered a serious imbalance when each failed to get its fair\r\nshare of recruits from the various so-called mental categories.[15-65]\r\nHer assistant, Ralph P. Sollat, prepared a program for her\r\nincorporating Roy K. Davenport's specific suggestions. The program\r\nwould allow volunteer enlistments to continue but would require all\r\nthe services to give a uniform entrance test to both volunteers and\r\ndraftees. (Actually, rather than develop a completely new entrance\r\ntest, the other services eventually adopted the Army's, which was\r\nrenamed the Armed Forces Qualification Test.) Sollat also devised an\r\narrangement whereby each service had to recruit men in each of the\r\nfour mental categories in accordance with an established quota.\r\nManpower experts agreed that this program offered the best chance to\r\ndistribute manpower equally among the services. Approved by Secretary\r\nMarshall on 10 April 1951 under the title Qualitative Distribution of\r\nMilitary Manpower Program, it quickly changed the intellectual\r\ncomposition of the services by obliging the Navy and Air Force to\r\nshare responsibility with the Army for the training and employment (p. 395)\r\nof less gifted inductees. For the remainder of the Korean War, for\r\nexample, each of the services, not just the Army, had to take 24\r\npercent of its new recruits from category IV, the low-scoring group.\r\nThis figure was later reduced to 18 percent and finally in 1958 to 12\r\npercent.[15-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-65: Ltr, Anna Rosenberg Hoffman to\r\n                   author, 23 Sep 71.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-66: BuPers Study, Pers A 1224 (probably\r\n                   Jan 59), GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy and the Air Force had always insisted their high minimum\r\nentrance requirements were designed to maintain the good quality of\r\ntheir recruits and had nothing to do with race. Roy Davenport believed\r\notherwise and read into their standards an intent to exclude all but a\r\nfew Negroes. Rosenberg saw in the new qualitative distribution program\r\nnot only the chance to upgrade the Army but also a way of \"making sure\r\nthat the other Services had their proper share of Negroes.\"[15-67]\r\nBecause so many Negroes scored below average in achievement tests and\r\ntherefore made up a large percentage of the men in category IV, the\r\nnew program served Rosenberg's double purpose. Even after discounting\r\nthe influence of other factors, statistics suggest that the imposition\r\nof the qualitative distribution program operated just as Rosenberg and\r\nthe Fahy Committee before her had predicted. (_Table 3_)\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-67: Interv, author with Davenport, 17 Oct\r\n                   71; and Ltr, Anna Rosenberg Hoffman to author, 23\r\n                   Sep 71.]\r\n\r\nTable 3--Percentage of Black Enlisted Men and Women\r\n\r\n  Service                1 July 1949   1 July 1954 1 July 1956\r\n  Army                     12.4          13.7         12.8\r\n  Navy                      4.7           3.6          6.3\r\n  Air Force                 5.1           8.6         10.4\r\n  Marine Corps              2.1           6.5          6.5\r\n\r\n_Source_: Memo for Rcd, ASD/M, 12 Sep 56, sub: Integration\r\nPercentages, ASD(M) 291.2.\r\n\r\nThe program had yet another consequence: it destroyed the Army's best\r\nargument for the reimposition of the racial quota. Upset over the\r\nsteadily rising number of black enlistments in the early months of the\r\nKorean War, the Army's G-1 had pressed Secretary Pace in October 1950,\r\nand again five months later with G-3 concurrence, to reinstate a\r\nceiling on black enlistments. Assistant Secretary Earl D. Johnson\r\nreturned the request \"without action,\" noting that the new qualitative\r\ndistribution program would produce a \"more equitable\" solution.[15-68]\r\nThe President's agreement with Secretary Gray about reimposing a quota\r\nnotwithstanding, it was highly unlikely that the Army could have done\r\nso without returning to the White House for permission, and when in\r\nMay 1951 the Army staff renewed its demand, Pace considered asking the\r\nWhite House for a quota on Negroes in category IV. After consulting\r\nwith Rosenberg on the long-term effects of qualitative distribution of\r\nmanpower, however, Pace agreed to drop the matter.[15-69]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-68: G-1 Summary Sheet with incl, 13 Mar\r\n                   51, sub: Negro Strength in the Army; Memo, ASA for\r\n                   CofS, 13 Apr 51, same sub; both in CS 291.2 Negroes\r\n                   (13 Mar 51).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 15-69: Memo, Actg CofS for SA, 31 May 51,\r\n                   sub: Present Overstrength in Segregated Units; G-1\r\n                   Summary Sheet for CofS, 26 May 51, same sub; Draft\r\n                   Memo, Frank Pace, Jr., for President; Memo, ASA for\r\n                   SA, 1 Jul 51.

The race issues\r\nwith which the Secretary of Defense concerned himself in these\r\nyears--the definition of race, the status of black servicemen\r\noverseas, even the parity of enlistment standards--while no doubt\r\nimportant in the long run to the status of the Negro in the armed\r\nforces, had little to do with the immediate problem of segregation.\r\nSecretary Johnson had done nothing to enforce the executive order in\r\nthe Army and his successor achieved little more. Willing to let the\r\nservices set the pace of reform, neither secretary substantially\r\nchanged the armed forces' racial practices. The integration process\r\nthat began in those years was initiated, appropriately enough perhaps,\r\nby the services themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16                                                         (p. 397)\r\n\r\nIntegration in the Air Force and the Navy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe racial reforms instituted by the four services between 1949 and\r\n1954 demonstrated that integration was to a great extent concerned\r\nwith effective utilization of military manpower. In the case of the\r\nArmy and the Marine Corps the reforms would be delayed and would\r\noccur, finally, on the field of battle. The Navy and the Air Force,\r\nhowever, accepted the connection between military efficiency and\r\nintegration even before the Fahy Committee began to preach the point.\r\nDespite their very dissimilar postwar racial practices, the Air Force\r\nand the Navy were facing the same problem. In a period of reduced\r\nmanpower allocations and increased demand for technically trained men,\r\nthese services came to realize that racial distinctions were imposing\r\nunacceptable administrative burdens and reducing fighting efficiency.\r\nTheir response to the Fahy Committee was merely to expedite or revise\r\nintegration policies already decided upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Air Force, 1949-1951_\r\n\r\nThe Air Force's integration plan had gone to the Secretary of Defense\r\non 6 January 1949, committing that service to a major reorganization\r\nof its manpower. In a period of severe budget and manpower\r\nretrenchment, the Air Force was proposing to open all jobs in all\r\nfields to Negroes, subject only to the individual qualifications of\r\nthe men and the needs of the service.[16-1] To ascertain these needs\r\nand qualifications the Director of Personnel Planning was prepared to\r\nscreen the service's 20,146 Negroes (269 officers and 19,877 airmen),\r\napproximately 5 percent of its strength, for the purpose of\r\nreassigning those eligible to former all-white units and training\r\nschools and dropping the unfit from the service.[16-2] As Secretary of\r\nthe Air Force Symington made clear, his integration plan would be\r\nlimited in scope. Some black service units would be retained; the rest\r\nwould be eliminated, \"thereby relieving the Air Force of the critical\r\nproblems involved in manning these units with qualified\r\npersonnel.\"[16-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-1: Memo, ASecAF for Symington, 25 Mar 49,\r\n                   sub: Salient Factors of Air Force Policy Regarding\r\n                   Negro Personnel, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-2: Negro strength figures as of 5 April\r\n                   1949.

Submitted to Forrestal on 6 January 1949, it was     (p. 398)\r\nslightly revised after lengthy discussions in both the Fahy Committee\r\nand the Personnel Policy Board and in keeping with the Defense\r\nSecretary's equal treatment and opportunity directive of 6 April 1949.\r\nSome further delay resulted from the Personnel Policy Board's abortive\r\nattempt to achieve an equal opportunity program common to all the\r\nservices. The Air Force plan was not finally approved by the Secretary\r\nof Defense until 11 May. Some in the Air Force were worried about the\r\nlong delay in approval. As early as 12 January the Chief of Staff\r\nwarned Symington that budget programming for the new 48-wing force\r\nrequired an early decision on the plan, especially in regard to the\r\ninactivation of the all-black wing at Lockbourne. Further delay, he\r\npredicted, would cause confusion in reassignment of some 4,000\r\ntroops.[16-4] In conversation with the Secretary of Defense, Symington\r\nmentioned a deadline of 31 March, but Assistant Secretary Zuckert was\r\nlater able to assure Symington that the planners could tolerate a\r\ndelay in the decision over integration until May.[16-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-4: Memo, Hoyt S. Vandenberg, CofS, USAF,\r\n                   for SecAF, 12 Jan 49, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-5: Memo, SecAF for Forrestal, 17 Feb 49;\r\n                   Memo, ASecAF for Symington, 24 Mar 49, sub:\r\n                   Lockbourne AFB; both in SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nBy then the long official silence had produced serious consequences,\r\nfor despite the lack of any public announcement, parts of the plan had\r\nleaked to the press and caused some debate in Congress and\r\nconsiderable dissatisfaction among black servicemen. Congressional\r\ninterest in the internal affairs of the armed forces was always of\r\nmore than passing concern to the services. When a discussion of the\r\nnew integration plan appearing in the Washington _Post_ on 29 March\r\ncaused a flurry of comment on Capitol Hill, Zuckert's assistant,\r\nClarence H. Osthagen, met with the clerk of the House Armed Services\r\nCommittee to \"explain and clarify\" for the Air Force. The clerk,\r\nRobert Harper, warned Osthagen that the impression in the House was\r\nthat a \"complete intermingling of Negro and white personnel was to\r\ntake place\" and that Congressman Winstead of Mississippi had been\r\ntempted to make a speech on the subject. Still, Harper predicted that\r\nthere would be no adverse criticism of the plan in the House \"at this\r\ntime,\" adding that since that body had already passed the Air Force\r\nappropriation Chairman Carl Vinson was generally unconcerned about the\r\nAir Force racial program. Reporting on Senate reaction, Harper noted\r\nthat while many members of the upper house would have liked to see the\r\nplan deferred, they recognized that the President's order made change\r\nmandatory. At any rate, Harper reassured Osthagen, the announcement of\r\nan integration plan would not jeopardize pending Air Force\r\nlegislation.[16-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-6: Memo for Files, Osthagen, Asst to\r\n                   ASecAF, 13 Apr 49, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Air Force's black personnel were not so easily\r\nreassured, and the service had a morale problem on its hands during\r\nthe spring of 1949. As later reported by the Fahy Committee staff,\r\nblack troops generally supported the inactivation of the all-black\r\n332d Fighter Wing at Lockbourne as a necessary step toward\r\nintegration, but news reports frequently linked the disbandment of\r\nthat unit to the belt tightening imposed on the Air Force by the 1950\r\nbudget. Some Negroes in the 332d concluded that the move was not   (p. 399)\r\ndirected at integration but at saving money for the Air Force.[16-7]\r\nThey were concerned lest they find themselves relegated to unskilled\r\nlabor units despite their training and experience. This fear was not\r\nso farfetched, considering Zuckert's private prediction that the\r\nredistribution of Lockbourne men had to be executed exactly according\r\nto the proposed program or \"we would find experienced Air Force Negro\r\ntechnical specialists pushing wheelbarrows or driving trucks in Negro\r\nservice units.\"[16-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-7: Ltr, Joseph H.

Many of the\r\nblack officers were overage in grade, their proficiency geared to the\r\nF-51, a wartime piston plane, and they were the logical victims of any\r\nreduction in force that might occur in this period of reduced military\r\nbudgets.[16-9] Some men doubted that the new program, as they\r\nimperfectly understood it, would truly integrate the service. They\r\ncould, for example, see no way for the Air Force to break through what\r\nthe press called the \"community patterns\" around southern bases, and\r\nthey were generally suspicious of the motives of senior department\r\nofficials. The Pittsburgh _Courier_ summarized this attitude by\r\nquoting one black officer who expressed doubt \"that a fair program\r\nwill be enforced from the top echelon.\"[16-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-9: Washington _Post_, April 4, 1949; USAF\r\n                   Oral History Program, Interview with Lt Col Spann\r\n                   Watson (USAF, Ret.), 3 Apr 73.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-10: Pittsburgh _Courier_, January 22,\r\n                   1949.]\r\n\r\nBut such suspicions were unfounded, for the Air Force's senior\r\nofficials were determined to enforce the new program both fairly and\r\nexpeditiously. General Vandenberg, the Chief of Staff, reported to the\r\nWar Council on 11 January that the Air Force would \"effect full and\r\ncomplete implementation\" of its integration plan not only by issuing\r\nthe required directives and orders, but also by assigning\r\nresponsibility for monitoring the worldwide implementation of the\r\nprogram to his deputy for personnel. The Chief of Staff also planned\r\nto call a meeting of his senior commanders to discuss and solve\r\nproblems rising from the plan and impress on them the personal\r\nattention they must give to carrying it out in the field.[16-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-11: Memo, Vandenberg, CofS, USAF, for\r\n                   SecAF, 12 Jan 49, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThe Air Force Commanders' Conference, assembled on 12 April 1949,\r\nheard Lt. Gen. Idwal Edwards, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel,\r\nexplain the genesis of the integration plan and outline its major\r\nprovisions. He mentioned two major steps to be taken in the first\r\nphase of the program. First, the 332d Fighter Wing would be\r\ninactivated on or before 30 June, and all blacks would be removed from\r\nLockbourne. The commander of the Continental Air Command would create\r\na board of Lockbourne officers to screen those assigned to the\r\nall-black base, dividing them into three groups. The skilled and\r\nqualified officers and airmen would be reassigned worldwide to white\r\nunits \"just like any other officers or airmen of similar skills    (p. 400)\r\nand qualifications.\" General Edwards assumed that the number of men in\r\nthis category would not be large. Some 200 officers and 1,500 airmen,\r\nhe estimated, would be found sufficiently qualified and proficient for\r\nsuch reassignment. He added parenthetically that Colonel Davis\r\nunderstood the \"implications\" of the new policy and intended to\r\nrecommend only an individual \"of such temperament, judgment, and\r\ncommon sense that he can get along smoothly as an individual in a\r\nwhite unit, and second, that his ability is such as to warrant respect\r\nof the personnel of the unit to which he is transferred.\"\r\n\r\nThe technically unqualified but still \"usable\" men would be reassigned\r\nto black service units. The staff recognized, General Edwards added,\r\nthat some Negroes were unsuited for assignment to white units for\r\n\"various reasons\" and had specifically authorized the retention of\r\n\"this type of Negro\" in black units. Finally, those who were found\r\nneither qualified nor useful would be discharged under current\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe second major action would be taken at the same time as the first.\r\nAll commands would similarly screen their black troops with the object\r\nof reassigning the skilled and qualified to white units and\r\neliminating the chronically unqualified. At the same time racial\r\nquotas for recruitment and school attendance would be abolished.\r\nHenceforth, blacks would enter the Air Force under the same standards\r\nas whites and would be classified, assigned, promoted, or eliminated\r\nin accordance with rules that would apply equally to all. \"In other\r\nwords,\" Edwards commented, \"no one is either helped or hindered\r\nbecause of the color of his skin; how far or how fast each one goes\r\ndepends upon his own ability.\" To assure equal treatment and\r\nopportunity, he would closely monitor the problem. Edwards admitted\r\nthat the subject of integrated living quarters had caused discussion\r\nin the staff, but based on the Navy's years of good experience with\r\nintegrated quarters and bolstered by the probability that the number\r\nof Negroes in any white unit would rarely exceed 1 percent, the staff\r\nsaw no need for separate sleeping accommodations.\r\n\r\nGeneral Edwards reminded the assembled commanders that, while\r\nintegration was new to the Air Force, the Navy had been following a\r\nsimilar policy for years, encountering no trouble, even in the Deep\r\nSouth where black troops as well as the nearby civilian communities\r\nunderstood that when men left the base they must conform to the laws\r\nand customs of the community. And as a parting shot he made the\r\ncommanders aware of where the command responsibility lay:\r\n\r\n     There will be frictions and incidents. However, they will be\r\n     minimized if commanders give the implementation of this policy\r\n     their personal attention and exercise positive command control.\r\n     Unless our young commanders are guided and counselled by the\r\n     senior commanders in unbiased implementation, we may encounter\r\n     serious troubles which the Navy has very ably avoided. It must\r\n     have your _personal attention and personal control_.[16-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-12: Lt Gen I. H.

Italics in the original.]\r\n\r\nCompelling reasons for reform notwithstanding, the effectiveness of\r\nan integration program would in the end depend on the attitude and\r\ninitiative of the local commander. In the Air Force's case the     (p. 401)\r\nultimate effectiveness owed much to the fact that the determination of\r\nits senior officials was fully explained and widely circulated\r\nthroughout the service. As Lt. Gen. Daniel (Chappie) James, Jr., later\r\nrecalled, those who thought to frustrate the process were well aware\r\nthat they risked serious trouble if their opposition was discovered by\r\nthe senior commanders. None of the obvious excuses for preserving the\r\nracial _status quo_ remained acceptable after Vandenberg and Edwards\r\nmade their positions clear.[16-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-13: USAF Oral History Program, Interview\r\n                   with Lt Gen Daniel James, Jr., 2 Oct 73. James was\r\n                   to become the first four-star black officer in the\r\n                   armed forces.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the control of the new plan was specifically made a\r\npersonal responsibility of the senior commanders spoke well for its\r\nspeedy and efficient execution. This was the kind of talk commanders\r\nunderstood, and as the order filtered down to the lower echelons its\r\nterms became even more explicit.[16-14] \"Direct attention to this\r\nchanged condition is required throughout the Command,\" Maj. Gen.\r\nLaurence S. Kuter notified his subordinate commanders at the Military\r\nAir Transport Service. \"Judgment, leadership, and ingenuity are\r\ndemanded. Commanders who cannot cope with the integration of Negroes\r\ninto formerly white units or activities will have no place in the Air\r\nForce structure.\"[16-15]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-14: Ltr, Marr to author, 19 Jun 70.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-15: MATS Hq Ltr No. 9, 1 May 49, SecAF\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nThe order itself, as approved by the Secretary of Defense on 11 May\r\n1949 and published on the same day as Air Force Letter 35-3, was\r\nunmistakable in intent and clearly spelled out a new bill of rights\r\nfor Negroes in the Air Force.[16-16] The published directive differed\r\nin some respects from the version drafted by the Chief of Staff in\r\nJanuary. Despite General Edwards's comments at the commanders'\r\nconference in April, the provision for allowing commanders to\r\nsegregate barracks \"if considered necessary\" was removed even before\r\nthe plan was first forwarded to the Secretary of Defense. This\r\ndeletion was made in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force,\r\nprobably by Zuckert.[16-17] Later Zuckert commented, \"I wouldn't want\r\nto give the commanders that kind of sweeping power. I would be afraid\r\nof how it might be exercised.\"[16-18] From the beginning, black airmen\r\nwere billeted routinely in the living quarters of the units to which\r\nthey were assigned.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-16: AF Ltr 35-3, 11 May 49.

Zuckert\r\nhad assured the Fahy Committee this limitation was designed to\r\nfacilitate, not frustrate, the absorption of Negroes into white units,\r\nand Edwards even agreed that given the determination of Air Force\r\nofficials to make a success of their program, the measure was probably\r\nunnecessary.[16-19] In the end Zuckert decided to drop any reference\r\nto such limitations \"because of the confusion that seemed to arise\r\nfrom this statement.\"[16-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-19: Testimony of Zuckert and Edwards,\r\n                   USAF, Before the Fahy Committee, 28 Mar 49,\r\n                   afternoon session, pp. 7-8.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-20: Memo, ASecAF for Symington, 29 Apr\r\n                   49, sub: Department of the Air Force Implementation\r\n                   of the Department of Defense Policy on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services,\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSISTANT SECRETARY ZUCKERT.]\r\n\r\nZuckert also deleted several clauses in the supplementary letter   (p. 402)\r\nto Air Force commanders that was to accompany and explain the order.\r\nThese clauses had listed possible exemptions from the new order: one\r\nmade it possible to retain a man in a black unit if he was one of the\r\n\"key personnel\" considered necessary for the successful functioning of\r\na black unit, and the other allowed the local commander to keep those\r\nNegroes he deemed \"best suited\" for continued assignment to black\r\nunits. The free reassignment of all eligible Negroes, particularly the\r\nwell-qualified, was essential to the eventual dissolution of the\r\nall-black units. The Fahy Committee had objected to these provisions\r\nand considered it important for the Air Force to delete them,[16-21]\r\nbut the matter was not raised during the committee hearings. There is\r\nevidence that the deletions were actually requested by the Secretary\r\nof Defense's Personnel Policy Board, whose influence in the\r\nintegration of the Air Force is often overlooked.[16-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-21: _Freedom to Serve_, pp. 37-38.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-22: Memo, SecAF for Chmn, PPB, 30 Apr 49,\r\n                   copy in FC file.

A board of officers under the presidency of Col. Davis, the\r\ncommander of Lockbourne, and composed of representatives of Air Force\r\nheadquarters, the Continental Air Command, and the Air Training\r\nCommand, and important officers of Lockbourne, interviewed every\r\nofficer in the wing. After considering each man's technical training,\r\nhis performance, and his career field preference, the board\r\nrecommended him for reassignment in a specific duty field. Although\r\nEdwards had promised that the screening boards would also judge each\r\nman's \"adaptability\" to integrated service, this requirement was\r\nquickly dropped by Davis and his fellow board members.[16-23] In fact,\r\nthe whole idea of having screening boards was resented by some black\r\nofficers. Zuckert later admitted that the screening may have been a\r\nmistake, but at the time it had been considered the best mechanism for\r\nascertaining the proper assignment for the men.[16-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-23: USAF Oral Hist Interv with Davis.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-24: USAF Oral Hist Interv with Zuckert.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a screening team in the Air Training Command gave a\r\nwritten examination to Lockbourne's more than 1,100 airmen and WAF's\r\nto determine if they were in appropriate military occupational\r\nspecialties. A team of personnel counselors interviewed all        (p. 403)\r\nairmen, weighed test scores, past performances, qualifications outside\r\nof assigned specialty, and choices of a career field, and then placed\r\nthem in one of three categories. First, they could be earmarked for\r\ngeneral reassignment in a specific military occupational specialty\r\ndifferent from the one they were now in; second, they could be\r\nscheduled for additional or more advanced technical training; or\r\nthird, they could be trained in their current specialties. The\r\nscreeners referred marginal or extraordinary cases to Colonel Davis's\r\nboard for decision.[16-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-25: NME Fact Sheet No. 105-49, 27 Jul\r\n                   49.]\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the Lockbourne processing, individual commanders\r\nestablished similar screening procedures wherever black airmen were\r\nthen assigned. All these teams uncovered a substantial number of men\r\nand women considered eligible for further training or reassignment.\r\n(_Table 4_)\r\n\r\nTable 4--Disposition of Black Personnel at Eight Air Force Bases, 1949\r\n\r\n                                   Percentages\r\n                Total    Asgmt to   Asgmt to   Asgmt to   Recom for\r\n      Base     Tested     Instr       Tech     Present      Board\r\n                           Duty      School      MOS        Action\r\n\r\n  Lockbourne\r\n    Male          970       .32      12.08       64.64      22.98\r\n    Female         58      0.00      25.86       55.17      18.97\r\n  Lackland        247      1.62      20.65       67.61      10.12\r\n  Barksdale       158      0.00      20.25       65.82      13.93\r\n  Randolph        252      2.38      26.19       57.14      14.29\r\n  Waco            146      2.06      30.14       57.53      10.27\r\n  Mather          126       .79      27.78       40.48      30.95\r\n  Williams        144      8.33      21.53       39.58      30.56\r\n  Goodfellow      122       .82      36.89       40.89      21.31\r\n\r\n  Total         2,223      1.35      19.61       59.20      19.84\r\n\r\n_Source_: President's Cmte on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in\r\nthe Armed Forces, \"A First Report on the Racial Integration Program of\r\nthe Air Force,\" 6 Feb 50, FC file.\r\n\r\nThe process of screening Lockbourne's troops was quickly completed,\r\nbut the process of reassigning them was considerably more drawn-out.\r\nThe reassignments were somewhat delayed in the first place by\r\nindecision, caused by budgetary uncertainties, on the future of\r\nLockbourne itself. By 25 July, a full two months after the screening\r\nbegan, the Lockbourne board had recommended only 181 officers and 700\r\nairmen to Air Force headquarters for new assignment. A short time\r\nlater, however, Lockbourne was placed on inactive status and its\r\nremaining men and women, with the exception of a small caretaker\r\ndetachment, were quickly reassigned throughout the Air Force.\r\n\r\nThe staff had predicted that the speed with which the integration\r\norder was carried out would follow a geographical pattern, with\r\nsouthern bases the last to integrate, but in fact no special pattern\r\nprevailed. For the many Negroes assigned to all-black base squadrons\r\nfor administrative purposes but serving on a day-to-day basis in\r\nintegrated units, the change was relatively simple. These men had\r\nalready demonstrated their ability to perform their duties competently\r\nunder integration, and in conformity with the new order most       (p. 404)\r\ncommanders immediately assigned them to the units in which they were\r\nalready working. Except for their own squadron overhead, some base\r\nservice squadrons literally disappeared when these reassignments were\r\neffected. After the screening process, most commanders also quickly\r\nreassigned troops serving in the other all-black units, such as\r\nSquadron F's, air ammunition, motor transport, vehicle repair, signal\r\nheavy construction, and aviation engineer squadrons.[16-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-26: \"Report on the First Year of\r\n                   Implementation of Current Policies Regarding Negro\r\n                   Personnel,\" Incl to Memo, Maj Gen Richard E.

See also USAF Oral Hist Interv\r\n                   with Marr.]\r\n\r\nThere were of course a few exceptions. Some commanders, noticeably\r\nmore cautious than the majority, began the integration process with\r\nconsiderably less ease and speed.[16-27] As late as January 1950, for\r\nexample, the Fahy Committee's executive secretary found that, with the\r\nexception of a small number of Negroes assigned to white units, the\r\nblack airmen at Maxwell Air Force Base were still assigned to the\r\nall-black 3817th Base Service Squadron, the only such unit he found,\r\nincidentally, in a tour of seven installations.[16-28] But as the\r\nmonths went by even the most cautious commander, learning of the\r\nsuccess of the new policy in other commands, began to reassign his\r\nblack airmen according to the recommendations of the screening board.\r\nDespite the announcement that some black units would be retained,\r\npractically all units were integrated by the end of the first year of\r\nthe new program. Even using the Air staff's very restricted definition\r\nof a \"Negro unit,\" that is, one whose strength was over 50 percent\r\nblack, statistics show how radical was the change in just one year.\r\n(_Table 5_)\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-27: USAF Oral Hist Interv with Davis.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-28: President's Committee on Equality of\r\n                   Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces, \"A\r\n                   First Report on the Racial Integration Program of\r\n                   the Air Force,\" 6 Feb 50, FC file (hereafter cited\r\n                   as Kenworthy Report).]\r\n\r\nTable 5--Racial Composition of Air Force Units\r\n\r\n                                   Negroes Assigned   Negroes Assigned\r\n   Month      Black    Integrated    to Black           to Integrated\r\n              Units      Units         Units              Units[1]\r\n\r\n  1949\r\n   June        106        167      Not available      Not available\r\n   July         89        350         14,609              7,369\r\n   August       86        711         11,921             11,977\r\n   September    91        863         11,521             13,290\r\n   October      88      1,031          9,522             15,980\r\n   November     75      1,158          8,038             17,643\r\n   December     67      1,253          7,402             18,489\r\n\r\n  1950\r\n   January      59      1,301          6,773             18,929\r\n   February     36      1,399          5,511             20,654\r\n   March        26      1,476          5,023             20,938\r\n   April        24      1,515          4,728             20,793\r\n   May          24      1,506          4,675             21,033\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote 1: Figures extracted from the Marr\r\n                   Report; see also monthly reports on AF integration,\r\n                   for example Memo, Dir, Pers Plng, for Osthagen\r\n                   (SecAF office), 10 Mar 50, sub: Distribution of\r\n                   Negro Personnel, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nDespite the predictions of some analysts, the effect of            (p. 405)\r\nintegration on black recruitment proved to be negligible.

In addition to the\r\nbacklog of Negroes who for some time had been trying to enlist only to\r\nfind the Air Force quota filled, there were many black volunteers who\r\nhad turned to the quota-free Air Force when the Army, its quota of\r\nNegroes filled for some time, stopped recruiting Negroes.\r\n\r\nWith Negroes serving in over 1,500 separate units there was no need to\r\ninvoke the 10 percent racial quota in individual units as Vandenberg\r\nhad ordered. One notable exception during the first months of the\r\nprogram was the Air Training Command, where the rapid and unexpected\r\nreassignment of many black airmen caused some bases, James Connally in\r\nTexas, for example, to acquire a great many Negroes while others\r\nreceived few or none. To prevent a recurrence of the Connally\r\nexperience and \"to effect a smooth operation and proper adjustment of\r\nsocial importance,\" the commander of the Air Training Command imposed\r\nan 8 to 10 percent black quota on his units and established a\r\nprocedure for staggering the assignment of black airmen in small\r\ngroups over a period of thirty to sixty days instead of assigning them\r\nto any particular base in one large increment. These quotas were not\r\napplied to the basic training flights, which were completely\r\nintegrated. It was not uncommon to find black enlistees in charge of\r\nracially mixed training flights.[16-29] Of all Air Force\r\norganizations, the Training Command received the greatest number of\r\nblack airmen as a result of the screening and reassignment.

Whatever their personal convictions regarding discrimination,\r\nsenior Air Force officials had agreed that integration would be\r\nlimited. They were most concerned with managerial problems associated\r\nwith continued segregation of the black flying unit and the black\r\nspecialists scattered worldwide. Other black units were not considered\r\nan immediate problem. Assistant Secretary Zuckert admitted as much in\r\nMarch 1949 when he reported that black service units would be retained\r\nsince they performed a \"necessary Air Force function.\"[16-31] As\r\noriginally conceived, the Air Force plan was frankly imitative of the\r\nNavy's postwar program, stressing merit and ability as the limiting\r\nfactors of change. The Air Force promised to discharge all its\r\nsubstandard men, but those black airmen either ineligible for\r\ndischarge or for reassignment to specialist duty would remain in\r\nsegregated units.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-31: Memo, ASecAF for Symington, 25 Mar\r\n                   49, sub: Salient Factors of Air Force Policy\r\n                   Regarding Negro Personnel, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nYet once begun, the integration process quickly became universal. By\r\nthe end of 1950, for example, the Air Force had reduced the number of\r\nblack units to nine with 95 percent of its black airmen serving in\r\nintegrated units. The number of black officers rose to 411, an     (p. 407)\r\nincrease of 10 percent over the previous year, and black airmen to\r\n25,523, an increase of 15 percent, although the proportion of blacks\r\nto whites continued to remain between 6 and 7 percent.[16-32] Some\r\neighteen months later only one segregated unit was left, a 98-man\r\noutfit, itself more than 26 percent white. Negroes were then serving\r\nin 3,466 integrated units.[16-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-32: _Air Force Times_, 10 February 1951.\r\n                   These figures do not take into account the SCARWAF\r\n                   (Army personnel) who continued to serve in\r\n                   segregated units within the Air Force.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-33: Memo, DepSecAF for Manpower and\r\n                   Organizations for ASD/M, 5 Sep 52, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons for the universal application of what was\r\nconceived as a limited program. First, the Air Force was in a sense\r\nthe captive of its own publicity. While Secretary Symington had\r\ncarefully delineated the limits of his departmental plan for the\r\nPersonnel Policy Board in January 1949, he was carried considerably\r\nbeyond these limits when he addressed President Truman in the open\r\nforum of the Fahy Committee's first formal meeting:\r\n\r\n     As long as you mentioned the Air Force, sir, I just want to\r\n     report to you that our plan is to completely eliminate\r\n     segregation in the Air Force. For example, we have a fine group\r\n     of colored boys. Our plan is to take those boys, break up that\r\n     fine group, and put them with the other units themselves and go\r\n     right down the line all through these subdivisions one hundred\r\n     percent.[16-34]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-34: Transcript of the Meeting of the\r\n                   President and the Four Service Secretaries With the\r\n                   President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Services, 12 Jan 49, FC\r\n                   file, which reports the President's response as\r\n                   being \"That's all right.\"]\r\n\r\nLater, Symington told the Fahy Committee that while the new program\r\nwould probably temporarily reduce Air Force efficiency \"we are ready,\r\nwilling, and anxious to embark on this idea. We want to eliminate the\r\nfundamental aspect of class in this picture.\"[16-35] Clearly, the\r\nretention of large black units was incompatible with the elimination\r\nof class distinctions.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-35: Testimony of the Secretary of the Air\r\n                   Force Before the Fahy Committee, 28 Mar 49,\r\n                   afternoon session, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nThe more favorable the publicity garnered by the plan in succeeding\r\nmonths, the weaker the distinction became between the limited\r\nintegration of black specialists and total integration. Reinforcing\r\nthe favorable publicity were the monthly field reports that registered\r\na steady drop in the number of black units and a corresponding rise in\r\nthe number of integrated black airmen. This well-publicized progress\r\nprovided another, almost irresistible reason for completing the task.\r\n\r\nMore to the point, the success of the program provided its own impetus\r\nto total integration. The prediction that a significant number of\r\nblack officers and men would be ineligible for reassignment or further\r\ntraining proved ill-founded. The Air Force, it turned out, had few\r\nuntrainable men, and after the screening process and transfer of those\r\neligible was completed, many black units were so severely reduced in\r\nstrength that their inactivation became inevitable. The fear of white\r\nopposition that had inhibited the staff planners and local commanders\r\nalso proved groundless. According to a Fahy Committee staff report\r\nin March 1950, integration had been readily accepted at all levels\r\nand the process had been devoid of friction. \"The men,\" E. W.      (p. 408)\r\nKenworthy reported, \"apparently were more ready for equality of\r\ntreatment and opportunity than the officer corps had realized.\"[16-36]\r\nAt the same time, Kenworthy noted the effect of successful integration\r\non the local commanders. Freed from the charges of discrimination that\r\nhad plagued them at every turn, most of the commanders he interviewed\r\nremarked on the increased military efficiency of their units and the\r\nimproved utilization of their manpower that had come with integration.\r\nThey liked the idea of a strictly competitive climate of equal\r\nstandards rigidly applied, and some expected that the Air Force\r\nexample would have an effect, eventually, on civilian attitudes.[16-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-36: Kenworthy Report, as quoted and\r\n                   commented on in Memo, Worthington Thompson\r\n                   (Personnel Policy Board staff) for Leva, 9 Mar 50,\r\n                   sub: Some Highlights of Fahy Committee Report on\r\n                   Air Force Racial Integration Program, SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-37: Ltr, Kenworthy to Zuckert, 5 Jan 50,\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC MAKERS _of the U.S. Far East Air Force prepare to\r\ncelebrate Christmas, Korea, 1950_.]\r\n\r\nFor the Air Force, it seemed, the problem of segregation was all over\r\nbut for the celebrating. And there was plenty of that, thanks to the\r\nFahy Committee and the press. In a well-publicized tour of a cross\r\nsection of Air Force installations in early 1950, Kenworthy surveyed\r\nthe integration program for the committee. His favorable report won\r\nthe Air Force laudatory headlines in the national press and formed the\r\ncore of the Air Force section of the Fahy Committee's final report,\r\n_Freedom to Serve_.[16-38] For its part, the black press covered the\r\nprogram in great detail and gave its almost unanimous approval. As\r\nearly as July 1949, for example, Dowdal H. Davis, president of the\r\nNegro Newspaper Publishers Association, reported on the highly\r\nencouraging reaction to the breakup of the 332d, and the headlines\r\nreflected this attitude: \"The Air Force Leads the Way,\" the Chicago\r\n_Defender_ headlined; \"Salute to the Air Force,\" the Minneapolis\r\n_Spokesman_ editorialized; and \"the swiftest and most amazing upset of\r\nracial policy in the history of the U.S. Military,\" _Ebony_ concluded.\r\nPointing to the Air Force program as the best, the Pittsburgh\r\n_Courier_ called the progress toward total integration \"better than\r\nmost dared hope.\"[16-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-38: See, for example, the Washington\r\n                   _Post_, March 27, 1950.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-39: Press reaction summarized in Memo,\r\n                   James C.

The\r\nstaff had expected a certain amount of testing of the new policy by\r\nboth white and black troops, and with few exceptions the incidents\r\nreported turned out to be little more than that. Some arose from\r\nattempts by Negroes to win social acceptance at certain Air Force\r\ninstallations, but the majority of cases involved attempts by white\r\nairmen to introduce their black comrades into segregated off-base\r\nrestaurants and theaters. Two examples might stand for all. The first\r\ninvolved a transient black corporal who stopped off at the Bolling Air\r\nForce Base, Washington, D.C., to get a haircut in a post exchange\r\nbarbershop. He was refused service and in the absence of the post\r\nexchange officer he returned to the shop to trade words and eventually\r\nblows with the barber. The corporal was subsequently court-martialed,\r\nbut the sentence was set aside by a superior court.[16-40] Another\r\ncase involved a small group of white airmen who ordered refreshments\r\nat a segregated lunch counter in San Antonio, Texas, for themselves\r\n\"and a friend who would join them later.\" The friend, of course, was a\r\nblack airman. The Inspector General reported this incident to be just\r\none of a number of attempts by groups of white and black airmen to\r\nintegrate lunch counters and restaurants. In each case the commanders\r\nconcerned cautioned their men against such action, and there were few\r\nreoccurrences.[16-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-40: Memo, IG, USAF, for ASecAF, 25 Jul\r\n                   49, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-41: Idem for DCSPER, 7 Sep 49, copy in\r\n                   SecAF files; see also ACofS, G-2, Fourth Army, Ft.\r\n                   Sam Houston, Summary of Information, 7 Sep 49, copy\r\n                   in SA 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe commanders' warnings were understandable because, as any official\r\nfrom Secretary Symington on down would quickly explain, the Air Force\r\ndid not regard itself as being in the business of forcing changes in\r\nAmerican society; it was simply trying to make the best use of its\r\nmanpower to build military efficiency in keeping with its national\r\ndefense mission.[16-42] But in the end the integration order proved\r\neffective on both counts. Racial feelings, racial incidents, charges\r\nof discrimination, and the problems of procurement, training, and\r\nassignment always associated with racially designated units had been\r\nreduced by an appreciable degree or eliminated entirely. The problems\r\nanticipated from the mingling of blacks and whites in social\r\nsituations had proved to be largely imaginary. The Air Force adopted a\r\nstandard formula for dealing with these problems during the next\r\ndecade. Incidents involving black airmen were treated as individual\r\nincidents and dealt with on a personal basis like any ordinary\r\ndisciplinary case. Only when there was no alternative was an incident\r\nlabeled \"racial\" and then the commander was expected to deal speedily\r\nand firmly with the troublemakers.[16-43] This sensible procedure\r\nfreed the Air Force for a decade from the charges of on-base\r\ndiscrimination that had plagued it in the past.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-42: See, for example, Memo, SecAF for\r\n                   SecDef, 17 Feb 49; Ltr, SecAF to Sen. Burnet R.\r\n                   Maybank, 21 Jul 49; both in SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-43: Memo, Evans, OSD, for Worthington\r\n                   Thompson, 18 May 53, sub: Summary of Topics\r\n                   Reviewed in Thompson's office 15 May 53, SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAINTENANCE CREW, _462d Strategic Fighter Squadron,\r\ndisassembles aft section of an F-84 Thunderstreak_.]\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt the new policy improved the Air Force's manpower   (p. 410)\r\nefficiency, as the experience of the 3202d Installation Group\r\nillustrates. A segregated unit serving at Eglin Air Force Base,\r\nFlorida, the 3202d was composed of an all-black heavy maintenance and\r\nconstruction squadron, a black maintenance repair and utilities\r\nsquadron, and an all-white headquarters and headquarters squadron.\r\nThis rigid segregation had caused considerable trouble for the unit's\r\npersonnel section, which was forced to assign men on the basis of\r\ncolor rather than military occupational specialty. For example, a\r\nwhite airman with MOS 345, a truck driver, although assigned to the\r\nunit, could not be assigned to the heavy maintenance and construction\r\nsquadron where his specialty was authorized but had to be assigned to\r\nthe white headquarters squadron where his specialty was not\r\nauthorized. Clearly operating in an inefficient manner, the unit was\r\ncharged with misassignment of personnel by the Air Inspector; in July\r\n1950 it was swiftly and peaceably, if somewhat belatedly, integrated,\r\nand its three squadrons were converted to racially mixed units,\r\nallowing an airman to be assigned according to his training and not\r\nhis color.[16-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-44: History Officer, 3202d Installations\r\n                   Groups, \"History of the 3202d Installations Group,\r\n                   1 July-31 October 1950,\" Eglin AFB, Fla., pp. 8-9.]\r\n\r\nThe preoccupation of high officials with the effects of integration on\r\na soldier's social life seemed at times out of keeping with the issues\r\nof national defense and military efficiency. At one of the Fahy\r\nCommittee hearings, for instance, an exasperated Charles Fahy asked\r\nOmar Bradley, \"General, are you running an Army or a dance?\"[16-45]\r\nYet social life on military bases at swimming pools, dances, bridge\r\nparties, and service clubs formed so great a part of the fabric of\r\nmilitary life that the Air Force staff could hardly ignore the\r\npossibility of racial troubles in the countless social exchanges that\r\ncharacterized the day-to-day life in any large American institution.\r\nThe social situation had been seriously considered before the new\r\nracial policy was approved. At that time the staff had predicted that\r\nproblems developing out of integration would not prove insurmountable,\r\nand indeed on the basis of a year's experience a member of the Air\r\nstaff declared that                                                (p. 411)\r\n\r\n     at the point where the Negro and the white person are actually in\r\n     contact the problem has virtually disappeared. Since all races of\r\n     Air Force personnel work together under identical environmental\r\n     conditions on the base, it is not unnatural that they participate\r\n     together, to the extent that they desire, in certain social\r\n     activities which are considered a normal part of service life.\r\n     This type of integration has been entirely voluntary, without\r\n     incident, and considerably more complete and more rapid than was\r\n     anticipated.[16-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-45: This off-the-record comment occurred\r\n                   during the committee hearings in the Pentagon and\r\n                   was related to the author by E.

Under these inflexible rules,\r\nthe Fahy Committee later reported, there was a steady movement in the\r\ndirection of shared facilities. \"Here again, mutual respect engendered\r\non the job or in the school seemed to translate itself into friendly\r\nassociation.\"[16-47] Whether it liked it or not, the Air Force was in\r\nthe business of social change.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-47: _Freedom to Serve_, p. 41.]\r\n\r\nTypical of most unit reports was one from the commander of the 1701st\r\nAir Transport Wing, Great Falls Air Force Base, Montana, who wrote\r\nSecretary Symington that the unit's eighty-three Negroes, serving in\r\nten different organizations, lived and worked with white airmen \"on an\r\napparently equal and friendly basis.\"[16-48] The commander had been\r\nunable to persuade local community leaders, however, to promote\r\nequality of treatment outside the base, and beyond its movie theaters\r\nGreat Falls had very few places that allowed black airmen. The\r\ncommander was touching upon a problem that would eventually trouble\r\nall the services: airmen, he reported to Secretary Symington, although\r\nthey have good food and entertainment on the base, sooner or later\r\nwant to go to town, sit at a table, and order what they want. The Air\r\nForce was now coming into conflict with local custom which it could\r\nsee no way to control. As the _Air Force Times_ put it, \"The Air\r\nForce, like the other services, feels circumspect policy in this\r\nregard is the only advisable one on the grounds that off-base\r\nsegregation is a matter for civilian rather than military\r\ndecision.\"[16-49]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-48: Ltr, Col Paul H. Prentiss, Cmdr,\r\n                   1701st AT Wing, to SecAF, 27 Dec 49, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-49: _Air Force Times_, 10 February 1951.]\r\n\r\nBut this problem could not detract from what had been accomplished on\r\nthe bases. Judged by the standards it set for itself before the Fahy\r\nCommittee, the Air Force had achieved its goals. Further, they     (p. 412)\r\nwere achieved in the period between 1949 and 1956 when the percentage\r\nof blacks in the service doubled, an increase resulting from the\r\nDefense Department's qualitative distribution of manpower rather than\r\nthe removal of the racial quota.[16-50] During these years the number\r\nof black airmen rose from 5.1 to 10.4 percent of the enlisted strength\r\nand the black officers from 0.6 to 1.1 percent. Reviewing the\r\nsituation in 1960, _Ebony_ noted that the program begun in 1949 was\r\nworking well and that white men were accepting without question\r\nprogressive racial practices forbidden in their home communities.\r\nMinor racial flare-ups still occurred, but integration was no longer a\r\nmajor problem in the Air Force; it was a fact of life.[16-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-50: Memo for Rcd, ADS(M), 12 Sep 56, sub:\r\n                   Integration Percentages, ADS(M) 291.2. For further\r\n                   discussion of the qualitative distribution program,\r\n                   see Navy section, below.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-51: \"Integration in the Air Force\r\n                   Abroad,\" _Ebony_ 15 (March 1960):27.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Navy and Executive Order 9981_\r\n\r\nThe changing government attitude toward integration in the late 1940's\r\nhad less dramatic effect on the Navy than upon the other services\r\nbecause the Navy was already the conspicuous possessor of a racial\r\npolicy guaranteeing equal treatment and opportunity for all its\r\nmembers. But as the Fahy Committee and many other critics insisted,\r\nthe Navy's 1946 equality guarantee was largely theoretical; its major\r\nracial problem was not one of policy but of practice as statistics\r\ndemonstrated. It was true, for example, that the Navy had abolished\r\nracial quotas in recruitment, yet the small number of black\r\nsailors--17,000 during 1949, averaging 4.5 percent of the total\r\nstrength--made the absence of a quota academic.[16-52] It was true\r\nthat Negroes served side by side with white sailors in almost every\r\noccupation and training program in the Navy, but it was also a fact\r\nthat 62 percent of all Negroes in the Navy in 1949 were still assigned\r\nto the nonwhite Steward's Branch. This figure shows that as late as\r\nDecember 1949 fewer than 7,000 black sailors were serving in racially\r\nintegrated assignments.[16-53] Again, with only 19 black officers,\r\nincluding 2 nurses, in a 1949 average officer strength of 45,464, it\r\nmeant little to say that the Navy had an integrated officer corps. A\r\nshadow had fallen, then, between the promise of the Navy's policy and\r\nits fulfillment, partly because of indifferent execution.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-52: Unless otherwise noted all statistics\r\n                   are from information supplied by the Bureau of\r\n                   Naval Personnel. The exact percentage on 1 July\r\n                   1949 was 4.7; see Memo for Rcd, ASD(M), 12 Sep 56,\r\n                   sub: Integration Percentages, ASD(M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-53: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for Under\r\n                   SecNav, 5 Dec 49, sub: Proposed Report to Chairman\r\n                   Personnel Policy Board Regarding the Implementation\r\n                   of Executive Order 9981, Pers 21, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nSubmitted to and approved by the Secretary of Defense, the new Navy\r\nplan announced on 7 June 1949 called for a specific series of measures\r\nto bring departmental practices into line with policy.[16-54] Once he\r\nhad gained Johnson's approval, Secretary of the Navy Matthews did not\r\ntarry. On 23 June he issued an explicit statement to all ships and\r\nstations, abjuring racial distinctions in the Navy and Marine      (p. 413)\r\nCorps and ordering that all personnel be enlisted or appointed,\r\ntrained, advanced or promoted, assigned and administered without\r\nregard to race, color, religion, or national origin.[16-55] Admirable\r\nand comprehensive, Matthew's statement scarcely differed in intent\r\nfrom his predecessor's general declaration of equal treatment and\r\nopportunity of 12 December 1945 and the more explicit directive of the\r\nChief of Naval Operations on the same subject on 27 February 1946. Yet\r\ndespite the close similarity, a reiteration was clearly necessary. As\r\neven the most ardent apologist for the navy's postwar racial policy\r\nwould admit, these groundbreaking statements had not done the job,\r\nand, to satisfy the demands of the Fahy Committee and the Secretary of\r\nDefense, Secretary Matthews had to convince his subordinates that the\r\ndemand for equal treatment and opportunity was serious and had to be\r\ndealt with immediately. His specific mention of the Marine Corps and\r\nthe problems of enlistment, assignment, and promotion, subjects\r\nignored in the earlier directives, represented a start toward the\r\nreform of his department's racial practices currently out of step with\r\nits expressed policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-54: Memo, SecNav for SecDef, 23 May 49,\r\n                   sub: Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the\r\n                   Armed Forces, copy in FC file.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-55: ALNAV 447-49, which remained in force\r\n                   until 23 March 1953 when SecNav Instruction 1000.2\r\n                   superseded it without substantial change.]\r\n\r\nYet a restatement of policy, no matter how specific, was not enough.\r\nAs Under Secretary Dan A. Kimball admitted, the Navy had the\r\nformidable task of convincing its own people of the sincerity of its\r\npolicy and of erasing the distrust that had developed in the black\r\ncommunity \"resulting from past discriminating practices.\"[16-56] Those\r\nwho were well aware of the Navy's earlier failure to achieve\r\nintegration by fiat were bound to greet Secretary Matthews's directive\r\nwith skepticism unless it was accompanied by specific reforms.\r\nMatthews, aware of the necessity, immediately inaugurated a campaign\r\nto recruit more black sailors, commission more black officers, and\r\nremove the stigma attached to service in the Steward's Branch.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-56: Memo, Under SecNav for Chmn, PPB, 22\r\n                   Dec 49, sub: Implementation of Executive Order\r\n                   9981, PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\nIt was logical enough to start a reform of the Navy's integration\r\nprogram by attacking the perennial problem of too few Negroes in the\r\ngeneral service. In his annual report to the Secretary of Defense,\r\nMatthews outlined some of the practical steps the Navy was taking to\r\nattract more qualified young blacks. The Bureau of Naval Personnel, he\r\nexplained, planned to assign black sailors and officers to its\r\nrecruiting service. As a first step it assigned eight Negroes to\r\nRecruitment Procurement School and subsequently to recruit duty in\r\neight major cities with further such assignments planned when current\r\nmanpower ceilings were lifted.[16-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-57: SecNav, Annual Report to SecDef, FY\r\n                   1949, p. 230; Memo, Under SecNav Chmn, PPB, 22 Dec\r\n                   49, sub: Implementation of Executive Order 9981,\r\n                   PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Naval Personnel had also polled black reservists on the\r\npossibility of returning to active duty on recruiting assignments, and\r\nfrom this group had chosen five officers for active duty in the New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, Washington, Detroit, and Chicago recruiting\r\noffices. At the same time black officers and petty officers were sent\r\nto extol the advantages of a naval career before black student     (p. 414)\r\nbodies and citizen groups.[16-58] Their performances were exceedingly\r\nwell received. The executive secretary of the Dayton, Ohio, Urban\r\nLeague, for example, thanked Secretary Matthews for the appearances of\r\nLieutenant Nelson before groups of students, reporters, and community\r\nleaders in the city. The lieutenant, he added, not only \"clearly and\r\neffectively interpreted the opportunities open to Negro youth in the\r\nUnited States Navy\" but also \"greatly accelerated\" the community's\r\nunderstanding of the Navy's integration program.[16-59] Nelson,\r\nhimself, had been a leading advocate of an accelerated public\r\nrelations program to advertise the opportunities for Negroes in the\r\nNavy.[16-60] The personnel bureau had adopted his suggestion that all\r\nrecruitment literature, including photographs testifying to the fact\r\nthat Negroes were serving in the general service, be widely\r\ndistributed in predominantly black institutions. Manpower ceilings,\r\nhowever, had forced the bureau to postpone action on Nelson's\r\nsuggestion that posters, films, pamphlets, and the like be\r\nused.[16-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-58: Memo, Dir, Recruiting Div, BuPers,\r\n                   for Admin Aide to SecNav, 22 Dec 50, sub: Negro\r\n                   Officer in Recruiting on the West Coast; Ltr,\r\n                   SecNav to Actg Exec Dir, Urban League, Los Angeles,\r\n                   22 Dec 50; both in Pers B6, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-59: Ltr, Charles W.

The personnel bureau\r\nwas well aware of this connection; Comdr. Luther C. Heinz, officer in\r\ncharge of naval reserve officer training, called the shortage of\r\nNegroes in his program a particularly important problem. He promised,\r\n\"in accord with the desires of the President,\" as he put it, to\r\nincrease black participation in the Naval Reserve Officers' Training\r\nCorps, and his superior, the Chief of Naval Personnel, started a\r\nprogram in the bureau for that purpose.[16-62] With the help of the\r\nNational Urban League, Heinz arranged a series of lectures by black\r\nofficers at forty-nine black schools and other institutions to\r\ninterest Negroes in the Navy's reserve officers program. In August\r\n1949, for example, Ens. Wesley Brown, the first Negro to be graduated\r\nfrom Annapolis, addressed gatherings in Chicago on the opportunities\r\nfor Negroes as naval officers.[16-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-62: Memo, Off in Charge, NROTC Tng, for\r\n                   Chief, Plans & Policy Div, BuPers, 14 Jul 49, sub:\r\n                   NROTC Personnel Problems, Pers 424, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-63: Ltr, Granger to Chief, NavPers, 3 Aug\r\n                   49, Pers 42, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Bureau of Naval Personnel wrote special press\r\nreleases, arranged interviews for naval officials with members of the\r\nblack press, and distributed publicity materials in predominantly\r\nblack schools to attract candidates and to assure interested young men\r\nthat race was no bar to their selection. In this connection Commander\r\nHeinz bid for and received an invitation to address the Urban League's\r\nannual conference in August 1949 to outline the Navy's program.\r\nThe Chief of Naval Personnel, Rear Adm. Thomas L. Sprague, also    (p. 415)\r\narranged for the training of all those engaged in promoting the\r\nprogram--professors of naval science, naval procurement officers, and\r\nthe like. In states where such assignments were considered acceptable,\r\nSprague planned to appoint Negroes to selection committees.[16-64] In\r\na related move he also ordered that when local law or custom required\r\nthe segregation of facilities used for the administration of\r\nqualifying tests for reserve officer training, the Navy would use its\r\nown facilities for testing. This ruling was used when the 1949\r\nexaminations were given in Atlanta and New Orleans; to the delight of\r\nthe black press the Navy transferred the test site to its nearby\r\nfacilities.[16-65] These efforts had some positive effect. In 1949\r\nalone some 2,700 black youths indicated an interest in the Naval\r\nReserve Officers' Training Corps by submitting applications.[16-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-64: Memo, Dir of Tng, BuPers, for Chief,\r\n                   NavPers, 1 Jul 49; Ltr, Granger to Cmdr Luther\r\n                   Heinz, 3 Aug 49; Ltr, Heinz to Granger, 18 Aug 49.\r\n                   All in Pers 42, BuPersRecs.

The percentage of Negroes in the Navy increased so\r\nslowly that not until 1955, in the wake of the great manpower buildup\r\nduring the Korean War, did it exceed the 1949 figure. Although the\r\npercentage of black enlistments increased significantly at\r\ntimes--approximately 12 percent of all enlistments in 1955 were black,\r\nfor example--the proportion of Negroes in the Navy's enlisted ranks\r\nwas only 0.4 percent higher in 1960 than in 1949. While the number of\r\nblack officers increased more than sevenfold in the same decade, it\r\nwas still considerably less than 1 percent of the total officer\r\nstrength, well below Army and Air Force percentages.\r\n\r\nTable 8--Black Manpower, U.S. Navy\r\n\r\nA.

All figures represent yearly averages.\r\n\r\nThe Navy had an explanation for the small number of Negroes. The\r\nreduced manpower ceilings imposed on the Navy, even during the Korean\r\nWar, had caused a drastic curtailment in recruiting. At the same time,\r\nwith the brief exception of the Korean War, the Navy had depended on\r\nvolunteers for enlistment and had required volunteers to score ninety\r\nor higher on the general classification test. The percentage of those\r\nwho scored above ninety was lower for blacks than for whites--16\r\npercent against 67 percent, a ratio, naval spokesmen suggested, that\r\nexplained the enlistment figures. Furthermore, the low enlistment\r\nquotas produced a long waiting list of those desiring to volunteer.\r\nAll applicants for the relatively few openings were thoroughly\r\nscreened, and competition was so keen that any Negroes accepted for\r\nthe monthly quota had to be extraordinarily well qualified.[16-67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-67: For a public expression of these\r\n                   sentiments see, for example, Ltr, Capt R. B. Ellis,\r\n                   Policy Control Br, BuPers, to President of\r\n                   Birmingham, Ala., Branch, NAACP, 30 Mar 50, Pers 66\r\n                   MM, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nWhat the Navy's explanation failed to mention was that the rise and\r\ndecline in the Navy's black strength during the 1950's was intimately\r\nrelated to the number of group IV enlistees being forced on the\r\nservices under the provisions of the Defense Department's program  (p. 416)\r\nfor the qualitative distribution of manpower. Each service was\r\nrequired to accept 24 percent of all recruits in group IV from fiscal\r\nyear 1953 to 1956, 18 percent in fiscal year 1957, and 12 percent\r\nthereafter. Between 1953 and 1956 the Navy accepted well above the\r\nrequired 24 percent of group IV men, but in fiscal year 1957 took only\r\n15.1 percent, and in 1958 only 6.8 percent. In 1958, with the\r\nknowledge of the Secretary of Defense, all the services took in fewer\r\nof the group IV's than the distribution program required, but\r\njustified the reduction on the grounds that declining strength made it\r\nnecessary to emphasize high quality in recruits. In a move endorsed by\r\nthe Navy, the Air Force finally requested in 1959 that the qualitative\r\ndistribution program be held in abeyance. On the basis of this request\r\nthe Navy temporarily ceased to accept all group IV and some group III\r\nmen, but resumed recruiting them when it seemed likely that the    (p. 417)\r\nSecretary of Defense would refuse the request.[16-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-68: BuPers, \"Memo on Discrimination of\r\n                   the Negro,\" 24 January 1959, Pers A1224, BuPers\r\n                   Tech Library.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTMAS IN KOREA, 1950.]\r\n\r\nThe correlation between the rise and fall of the group IV enlistments\r\nand the percentage of Negroes in the Navy shows that all the increases\r\nin black strength between 1952 and 1959 came not through the Navy's\r\npublicized and organized effort to attract the qualified black\r\nvolunteers it had promised the Fahy Committee, but from the men forced\r\nupon it by the Defense Department's distribution program. The\r\ncorrelation also lends credence to the charges of some of the civil\r\nrights critics who saw another reason for the shortage of Negroes.\r\nThey claimed that there had been no drop in the number of applicants\r\nbut that fewer Negroes were being accepted by Navy recruiters. One\r\nNAACP official claimed that Negroes were \"getting the run around.\"\r\nThose who had fulfilled all enlistment requirements were not being\r\ninformed, and others were being given false information by recruiters.\r\nHe concluded that the Navy was operating under an unwritten policy of\r\nfilling recruit quotas with whites, accepting Negroes only when whites\r\nwere unavailable.[16-69] If these accusations were true, the Navy was\r\ndenying itself the services of highly qualified black applicants at a\r\ntime when the Defense Department's qualitative distribution program\r\nwas forcing it to take large numbers of the less gifted. Certainly the\r\nnumber of Negroes capable of moving up the career and promotion ladder\r\nwas reduced and the Navy left vulnerable to further charges of\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-69: Ltr, Exec Secy, Birmingham, Ala.,\r\n                   Branch, NAACP, to Chief, NavPers, 14 Mar 50, Pers\r\n                   A, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nAs for the shortage of officers, Nelson cited the awareness among\r\ncandidates that promotions were slower for blacks in the Navy than in\r\nthe other services where there was \"less caste and class to\r\nbuck.\"[16-70] Nelson was aware that out of the 2,700 blacks who had\r\nindicated an interest in the reserve officer training program in 1949\r\nonly 250 actually took the aptitude tests. Of these, only two passed\r\nthe tests and one of these was later rejected for poor eyesight. An\r\nUrban League spokesman believed that some failed to take the tests out\r\nof fear of failure but that many harbored a suspicion that the program\r\nwas not entirely open to all regardless of race.[16-71] Reinforcing\r\nthis suspicion was the fact that, despite the intentions of the    (p. 418)\r\nBureau of Naval Personnel and the Navy's increasing control over the\r\nappointment process, as of 1965 not a single Negro had been appointed\r\nto any of the 150-man state selection committees on reserve officer\r\ntraining.[16-72] Also to be considered, as the American Civil\r\nLiberties Union later pointed out, was the promotion record of black\r\nofficers. As late as 1957 no black officer had ever commanded a ship,\r\nand while both black and white officers started up the same promotion\r\nladder, the blacks were usually transferred out of the line into staff\r\nbillets.[16-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-70: Interv, Nichols with Nelson, 1953, in\r\n                   Nichols Collection; Ltr, Nelson to author, 10 Feb\r\n                   70; both in CMH files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-71: Quoted in Memo, Dir of Tng, BuPers,\r\n                   for Chief, NavPers, 1 Jul 49, Pers 42, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-72: Memo for Rcd, Evans, 23 Jun 65, sub:\r\n                   NROTC Boards, ASD/M 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-73: Ltr, Exec Dir, ACLU, to SecNav, 26\r\n                   Nov 57, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REARMING AT SEA. _Ordnancemen at work on the deck of\r\nthe USS Philippine Sea, off Korea, October 1950._]\r\n\r\nGiven the pressure on the personnel bureau to develop some respectable\r\nblack manpower statistics, it is unlikely that the lack of educated,\r\nblack recruits can be blamed on widespread subterfuge at the\r\nrecruiting level. Far more likely is the explanation offered by Under\r\nSecretary Kimball, that the black community distrusted the\r\nNavy.[16-74] First apparent in the 1940's, this distrust lasted\r\nthroughout the next decade as young Negroes continued to show a\r\ngeneral apathy toward the Navy, which at times turned into open\r\nhostility. In September 1961 the Chief of Naval Personnel reported\r\nthat recruiters were not infrequently being treated to \"booing,\r\nhissing and other disorderly conduct\" when they tried to discuss the\r\nopportunities for naval careers before black audiences.[16-75]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-74: Memo, Under SecNav for Chmn, PPB, 22\r\n                   Dec 49, sub: Implementation of Executive Order\r\n                   9981, PPB 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-75: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for Pers B, 23\r\n                   Sep 61, copy in Harris Wofford Collection, J. F.\r\n                   Kennedy Library.]\r\n\r\nThe Navy's poor reputation in the black community centered on the\r\ncontinued existence of the racially separate servants' branch, in the\r\neyes of many the symbol of the service's racial exclusiveness. The\r\nSteward's Branch remained predominantly black. In 1949 it had 10,499\r\nNegroes, 4,707 Filipinos, 741 other nonwhites, and 1 white man. Chief\r\nstewards continued to be denied the grade of chief petty officer, on\r\nthe grounds that since stewards were not authorized to exercise\r\nmilitary command over others than stewards because of their lack of\r\nmilitary training, chief stewards were not chiefs in the military\r\nsense of the word. This difference in authority also explained, as the\r\nChief of Naval Personnel put it, why as a general rule chief stewards\r\nwere not quartered with other petty officers.[16-76] These         (p. 419)\r\ndistinctions were true also for stewards in the first, second, and\r\nthird classes, a fact in their case symbolized by differences in\r\nuniform. Most of the thousands of black stewards continued to be\r\nrecruited, trained, and employed exclusively in that branch, and thus\r\nfor over half the Negroes--65 percent--in the 1949 Navy the chance for\r\nadvancement was severely limited and the chance to qualify for a\r\ndifferent job almost nonexistent.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-76: Testimony of Vice Adm William M.\r\n                   Fechteler Before the President's Committee on\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed\r\n                   Services (the Fahy Cmte), 28 Mar 49, p. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROADENING SKILLS. _Stewards on the USS Valley Forge\r\nvolunteer for classes leading to advancement in other fields, Korea,\r\n1950._]\r\n\r\nThe Navy instituted several changes in the branch in the wake of the\r\nFahy Committee's recommendations. On 25 July 1949 the Chief of Naval\r\nPersonnel ordered all chief stewards designated chief petty officers\r\nwith all the prerogatives of that status; in precedence they came\r\nimmediately after chief dental technicians,[16-77] who were at the\r\nbottom of the list. That the change was limited to chief stewards did\r\nnot go unnoticed. Joseph Evans of the Fahy Committee staff charged\r\nthat the bureau \"seemed to have ordered this to accede to the\r\ncommittee's recommendations never intending to go beyond Chief\r\nStewards.\"[16-78] Nelson, by now a sort of unofficial ombudsman and\r\ngadfly for black sailors, urged his superiors to broaden the reform,\r\nand Kimball warned Admiral Sprague that limiting the change to\r\nchief stewards might be \"justified on the literal statement of     (p. 420)\r\nintention, but is vulnerable to criticism of continued discrimination.\"\r\nWithout compelling reasons to the contrary, he added, \"I do not feel\r\nthat we can afford to risk any possible impression of reluctant\r\nimplementation of the spirit of the directive.\"[16-79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-77: BuPers Cir Ltr 115-49, 25 Jul 49.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-78: Memo, Evans for Fahy Cmte, 23 Aug 49,\r\n                   sub: Progress in Navy, Fahy Papers, Truman\r\n                   Library.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-79: Memo, Under SecNav for Chief,\r\n                   NavPers, 10 Aug 49, MM (1) GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Sprague got the point, and on 30 August he announced that\r\neffective with the new year, stewards--first, second, and third\r\nclass--would be designated petty officers with appropriate pay,\r\nprerogatives, and precedence, and that their uniforms would be changed\r\nto conform to those of other petty officers. He also amended the\r\nbureau's manual to allow commanding officers to change the ratings of\r\nstewards without headquarters approval, thus enlarging the opportunity\r\nfor stewards, in all other respects qualified, to transfer into other\r\nratings.[16-80] These reforms brought about a slow but steady change\r\nin the assignment of black sailors. Between January 1950 and August\r\n1953, the percentage of Negroes in the general service rose from 42 to\r\n47 percent of the Navy's 23,000 man black strength, with a\r\ncorresponding drop in the percentage of those assigned to the\r\nSteward's Branch.[16-81]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-80: BuPers Cir Ltr 141-49, 30 Aug 49.

Secretary of the Navy Kimball's\r\nobservation that 133 stewards had transferred out of the branch in a\r\nrecent four-month period hardly promised any speedy change in the\r\ncurrent percentages.[16-82] In fact there was evidence even at that\r\nlate date that some staff members in the personnel bureau were working\r\nat cross-purposes to the Navy's expressed policy. Worried about the\r\nshortages of volunteers for the Steward's Branch, a group of officials\r\nhad met in August 1951 to discuss ways of improving branch morale.\r\nSome suggested publicizing the branch to the black press and schools,\r\nshowing that Negroes were in all branches of the Navy including the\r\nSteward's. They also studied a pamphlet called \"The Advantages of\r\nStewards Duty in the Navy\" that gave nine reasons why a man should\r\nbecome a steward.[16-83]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-82: Kimball was sworn in as Secretary of\r\n                   the Navy on 31 July 1951.

Despite his earlier efforts to raise\r\nthe status of stewards, Kimball, in a variation on an old postwar\r\nargument, tried to show that the exclusiveness of the Steward's    (p. 421)\r\nBranch actually worked to the Negro's advantage. As he explained to\r\nLester Granger in November 1952, any action to effect radical or\r\nwholesale changes in ratings \"would not only tend to reduce the\r\nefficiency of the Navy, but also in many instances be to the\r\ndisadvantage or detriment of the individuals concerned, particularly\r\nthose in the senior Steward ratings.\"[16-84] Supporting this line of\r\nargument, the Chief of Naval Personnel announced the reenlistment\r\nfigures for the Steward's Branch--over 80 percent during the Korean\r\nWar period. These figures, Vice Admiral James L. Holloway, Jr., added,\r\nproved the branch to be the most popular in the Navy and offered \"a\r\nrational measure of the state of the morale and job satisfaction.\"[16-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-84: Ltr, SecNav for Granger, 19 Nov 52,\r\n                   SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-85: Ltrs, Chief, NavPers, to James C.\r\n                   Evans, OSD, 19 Jun 53, and Granger, 28 Jul 53, both\r\n                   in P 8 (4), BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nThese explanations still figured prominently in the Navy's 1961\r\ndefense of its racial statistics. Discussing the matter at a White\r\nHouse meeting of civil rights leaders, the Chief of Naval Personnel\r\npointed out that all the black stewards could be replaced with\r\nFilipinos, but the Navy had refrained from such a course for several\r\nreasons. The branch still had the highest reenlistment rate. It\r\nprovided jobs for those group IV men the Navy was obliged to accept\r\nbut could never use in technical billets. Without the opportunity\r\nprovided by the branch, moreover, \"many of the rated black stewards\r\nwould probably not achieve a petty officer rating at all.\"[16-86]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-86: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for Pers B, 23\r\n                   Sep 61, Harris Wofford Collection, J.

Lester Granger, for example,\r\nwarned Secretary Kimball of the skepticism that persisted among\r\nsections of the black community: \"As long as that branch [the\r\nSteward's Branch] is composed entirely of nonwhite personnel, the Navy\r\nis apt to be held by some to be violating its own stated\r\npolicy.\"[16-87] To Kimball's successor, Robert B. Anderson,[16-88]\r\nGranger was even more blunt. The Steward's Branch, he declared, was \"a\r\nconstant irritant to the Negro public.\" He saw some logical reason for\r\nthe continued concentration of Negroes in the branch but added \"logic\r\ndoes not necessarily imply wisdom and I sincerely believe that it is\r\nunwise from the standpoint of efficiency and public relations to\r\ncontinue the Stewards Branch on its present basis.\"[16-89]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-87: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 24 Oct 52,\r\n                   SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-88: Secretary Anderson, appointed by\r\n                   President Eisenhower, became Secretary of the Navy\r\n                   on 4 February 1953.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-89: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 24 Apr 53,\r\n                   SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nGranger's suggestion for change was straightforward. He wanted the\r\nBureau of Naval Personnel to find a way to introduce a sufficiently\r\nlarge number of whites into the branch to transform its racial\r\ncomposition. The task promised to be difficult if the charges leveled\r\nin the Detroit _Free Press_ were accurate. In May 1953 the paper   (p. 422)\r\nreported incidents of naval recruiting officers who, \"by one ruse or\r\nanother,\" were shunting young volunteers, sometimes without their\r\nknowledge, into the Steward's Branch.[16-90]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-90: Detroit _Free Press_, May 16, 1953.]\r\n\r\nGranger's suggestions were taken up by Secretary Anderson, who\r\nannounced his intention of integrating the Steward's Branch and\r\nordered the Chief of Naval Personnel to draw up plans to that\r\nend.[16-91] To devise some practical measures for handling the\r\nproblem, the personnel bureau brought back to active duty three\r\nofficers who had been important to the development of the Navy's 1946\r\nintegration policy. Their study produced three recommendations:\r\nabolish the segregation of the Steward's Branch from the general\r\nservice and separate recruitment for its members; consider\r\nconsolidating the branch with the predominantly white Commissary\r\nBranch; and change the steward's insignia.[16-92]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-91: UP News Release, September 21, 1953,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-92: Ltr, Cmdr Durwood W.

Holloway,\r\n                   Jr., 31 Aug 53, P 8 (4), BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\nThe group acknowledged that the Steward's Branch was a \"sore spot with\r\nthe Negroes, and is our weakest position from the standpoint of Public\r\nRelations,\" and two of their recommendations were obviously aimed at\r\nimmediate improvement of public relations. Combining the messmen and\r\ncommissary specialists would of course create an integrated branch,\r\nwhich Granger estimated would be only 20 percent black, and would\r\nprobably provide additional opportunities for promotions, but in the\r\nend it could not mask the fact that a high proportion of black sailors\r\nwere employed in food service and valet positions. Nor was it clear\r\nhow changing the familiar crescent insignia, symbolic of the steward's\r\nduties, would change the image of a separate group that still\r\nperformed the most menial duties. Long-term reform, everyone agreed,\r\ndemanded the presence of a significant number of whites in the branch,\r\nand there was strong evidence that the general service contained more\r\nthan a few group IV white sailors. The group's proposal to abolish\r\nseparate recruiting would probably increase the number of blacks in\r\nthe general service and eliminate the possibility that unsuspecting\r\nblack recruits would be dragooned into a messman's career; both were\r\nsubstantial reforms but did not guarantee that whites would be\r\nattracted or assigned to the branch.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Holloway was concerned about this latter point, which dominated\r\nhis discussions with the Secretary of the Navy on 1 September 1953. He\r\nhad, he told Anderson, discussed with his recruiting specialists the\r\npossibility of recruiting white sailors for the branch, and while they\r\nall agreed that whites must not be induced to join by \"improper\r\nprocedures,\" such as preferential recruitment to escape the draft,\r\nthey felt that whites could be attracted to steward duty by skillful\r\nrecruiters, especially in areas of the country where industrial\r\nintegration had already been accomplished. His bureau was considering\r\nthe abolition of separate recruiting, but to make specific recommendations\r\non matters involving the stewards he had created an ad hoc committee,\r\nunder the Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel and composed of          (p. 423)\r\nrepresentatives of the other bureaus. When he received this committee's\r\nviews, Holloway promised to take \"definite administrative action.\"[16-93]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-93: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for SecNav, 1\r\n                   Sep 53, sub: Mr. Granger's Visit and Related\r\n                   Matters, Pers, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTEGRATED STEWARDS CLASS GRADUATES, GREAT LAKES, 1953.]\r\n\r\nThe three recommendations of the reservist experts did not survive\r\nintact the ad hoc committee's scrutiny. At the committee's suggestion,\r\nHolloway rejected the proposed merger of the commissary and steward\r\nfunctions on the grounds that such a move was unnecessary in an era of\r\nhigh reenlistment. He also decided that stewards would retain their\r\nbranch insignia. He did approve, however, in a decision announced on\r\n28 February 1954, putting an end to the separate recruitment of\r\nstewards with the exception of the contract enlistment of Filipino\r\ncitizens. As Anderson assured Congressman Adam Clayton Powell of New\r\nYork, only after recruit training and \"with full knowledge of the\r\nopportunities in various categories of administrative specialties\"\r\nwould an enlistee be allowed to volunteer for messman's duty.[16-94]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-94: Ltr, SecNav to Congressman Adam C.\r\n                   Powell, 19 Mar 54, SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Holloway promised a further search for ways to eliminate\r\n\"points of friction\" regarding the stewards, and naval officials\r\ndiscussed the problem with civil rights leaders and Defense Department\r\nofficials on several occasions in the next years.[16-95] The       (p. 424)\r\nSpecial Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Adam Yarmolinsky,\r\nreported in 1961 that the Bureau of Naval Personnel \"was not sanguine\"\r\nabout recruiting substantial numbers of white seamen for the Steward's\r\nBranch.[16-96] In answer, the Chief of Naval Personnel could only\r\npoint out that no matter what their qualifications or ambitions all\r\nmen assigned to the Steward's Branch were volunteers. As one\r\ncommentator observed, white sailors were very rarely attracted to the\r\nmessmen's field because of its reputation as a black specialty.[16-97]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-95: See, for example, ASD/M, Thursday\r\n                   Reports, 7 Jan 54 and 12 Apr 56, copies in Dep ASD\r\n                   (Civil Rights) files; see also Memo, Chief,\r\n                   NavPers, for Special Asst to SecDef, 29 Mar 61,\r\n                   sub: Stewards in U.S. Navy, BuPersRecs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-96: Memo, Adam Yarmolinsky for Fred\r\n                   Dutton, 31 Oct 61, sub: Yarmolinsky Memo of October\r\n                   26, Harris Wofford Collection, J.

The end of separate recruitment drastically cut the\r\nnumber of Negroes entering the rating, while the renewed emphasis on\r\ntransferring eligible chief stewards to other specialties somewhat\r\nreduced the number of Negroes already in the branch. Between 1956 and\r\n1961, some 600 men out of the 1,800 tested transferred to other rating\r\ngroups or fields. The substantial drop in black strength resulting\r\nfrom these changes combined with a corresponding rise in the number of\r\ncontract messmen from the western Pacific region reduced for the first\r\ntime in some thirty years Negroes in the Steward's Branch to a\r\nminority. Even for those remaining in the branch, life changed\r\nconsiderably. Separate berthing for stewards, always justified on the\r\ngrounds of different duties and hours, was discontinued, and the\r\namount of time spent by stewards at sea, with the varied military work\r\nthat sea duty involved, was increased.[16-98]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-98: Memo, Chief, NavPers, for Special\r\n                   Asst to SecDef, 29 Mar 61, sub: Stewards in U.S.\r\n                   Navy, Pers 8 (4), GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nIf these changes caused by the increased enlistment of stewards from\r\nthe western Pacific relieved the Steward's Branch of its reputation as\r\nthe black man's navy, they also perpetuated the notion that servants'\r\nduties were for persons of dark complexion. The debate over a\r\nsegregated branch that had engaged the civil rights leaders and the\r\nNavy since 1932 was over, but it had left a residue of ill will; some\r\nwere bitter at what they considered the listless pace of reform, a\r\npace which left the impression that the service had been forced to\r\nchange against its will. To some extent the Navy in the 1950's failed\r\nto capitalize on its early achievements because it had for so long\r\nmissed the point of the integrationists' arguments about the stewards.\r\nIn the fifties the Navy expended considerable time and energy\r\nadvertising for black officer candidates and recruits whom they\r\nguaranteed a genuinely equal chance to participate in all specialties,\r\nbut these efforts were to some extent dismissed by critics as not\r\ngermane. In 1950, for example, only 114 Negroes served in the\r\nglamorous submarine assignments and even fewer in the naval air\r\nservice.[16-99] Yet this obvious underrepresentation caused no great\r\noutcry from the black community. What did cause bitterness and     (p. 425)\r\nprotest in an era of aroused racial pride was the fact that servants'\r\nduties fell almost exclusively on nonwhite Americans. That these\r\nduties were popular--the 80 percent reenlistment rate in the Steward's\r\nBranch continued throughout the decade and the transfer rate into the\r\nbranch almost equaled the transfer out--was disregarded by many of the\r\nmore articulate spokesmen, who considered the branch an insult to the\r\nblack public. As Congressman Powell informed the Navy in 1953, \"no one\r\nis interested in today's world in fighting communism with a frying pan\r\nor shoe polish.\"[16-100] Although statistics showed nearly half the\r\nblack sailors employed in other than menial tasks, Powell voiced the\r\nmood of a large segment of the black community.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-99: The Navy commissioned its first black\r\n                   pilot, Ens.

Convinced that Negroes\r\nwere getting a full and equal chance to enlist in the general service\r\nand compete for officer commissions, the committee had approved the\r\nNavy's policy, trusting to time and equal opportunity to produce the\r\ndesired result. Unfortunately for the Navy, there would be many\r\ncritics both in and out of government in the 1960's who disagreed with\r\nthe committee's trust in time and good intentions, for equal opportunity\r\nwould remain very much a matter of numbers and percentages. In an  (p. 426)\r\nera when a premium would be placed on the size of minority membership,\r\nthe palm would go to the other services. \"The blunt fact is,\" Granger\r\nreminded the Secretary of the Navy in 1954, \"that as a general rule\r\nthe most aspiring Negro youth are apt to have the least interest in a\r\nNavy career, chiefly because the Army and Air Force have up to now\r\ncaptured the spotlight.\"[16-101] A decade later the statement still\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-101: Ltr, Granger to SecNav, 7 Jan 54,\r\n                   SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMIRAL GRAVELY (_1973 portrait_).]\r\n\r\nIt was ironic that black youth remained aloof from the Navy in the\r\n1950's when the way of life for Negroes on shipboard and at naval\r\nbases had definitely taken a turn for the better. The general service\r\nwas completely integrated, although the black proportion, 4.9 percent\r\nin 1960, was still far less than might reasonably be expected,\r\nconsidering the black population.[16-102] Negroes were being trained\r\nin every job classification and attended all the Navy's technical\r\nschools. Although not yet represented in proportionate numbers in the\r\ntop grades within every rating, Negroes served in all ratings in every\r\nbranch, a fact favorably noticed in the metropolitan press.[16-103]\r\nBlack officers, still shockingly out of proportion to black strength,\r\nwere not much more so than in the other services and were serving more\r\noften with regular commissions in the line as well as on the staff.\r\nTheir lack of representation in the upper ranks demonstrated that the\r\nclimb to command was slow and arduous even when the discriminatory\r\ntactics of earlier times had been removed. In 1961 the Navy could\r\nfinally announce that a black officer, Lt. Comdr. Samuel L. Gravely,\r\nJr., had been ordered to command a destroyer escort, the USS\r\n_Falgout_.[16-104]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-102: Memo, ASD/M for SA et al., 21 Nov\r\n                   51, sub: Manuscript on the Negro in the Armed\r\n                   Forces, SecDef 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-103: See New York _Herald Tribune_,\r\n                   December 2, 1957, and New York Post, March 14,\r\n                   1957.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 16-104: Gravely would eventually become the\r\n                   first black admiral in the U.S. Navy.]\r\n\r\nBut how were these changes being accepted among the rank and file?\r\nComments from official sources and civil rights groups alike showed\r\nthe leaven of racial tolerance at work throughout the service.[16-105]\r\nReporter Lee Nichols, interviewing members of all the services in  (p. 427)\r\n1953,[16-106] found that whites expected blacks to prove themselves in\r\ntheir assignments while blacks were skeptical that equal opportunities\r\nfor assignment were really open to them.

Bigots\r\nof both races inevitably remained, and the black community continued\r\nto resent the separate Steward's Branch, but the sincerity of the\r\nNavy's promise to integrate the service seemed no longer in doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17                                                         (p. 428)\r\n\r\nThe Army Integrates\r\n\r\n\r\nThe integration of the United States Army was not accomplished by\r\nexecutive fiat or at the demand of the electorate. Nor was it the\r\nresult of any particular victory of the civil rights advocates over\r\nthe racists. It came about primarily because the definition of\r\nmilitary efficiency spelled out by the Fahy Committee and demonstrated\r\nby troops in the heat of battle was finally accepted by Army leaders.\r\nThe Army justified its policy changes in the name of efficiency, as\r\nindeed it had always, but this time efficiency led the service\r\nunmistakably toward integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Race and Efficiency: 1950_\r\n\r\nThe Army's postwar planners based their low estimate of the black\r\nsoldier's ability on the collective performance of the segregated\r\nblack units in World War II and assumed that social unrest would\r\nresult from mixing the races. The Army thus accepted an economically\r\nand administratively inefficient segregated force in peacetime to\r\npreserve what it considered to be a more dependable fighting machine\r\nfor war. Insistence on the need for segregation in the name of\r\nmilitary efficiency was also useful in rationalizing the prejudice and\r\nthoughtless adherence to traditional practice which obviously played a\r\npart in the Army's tenacious defense of its policy.\r\n\r\nAn entirely different conclusion, however, could be drawn from the\r\nsame set of propositions. The Fahy Committee, for example, had clearly\r\ndemonstrated the inefficiency of segregation, and more to the point,\r\nsome senior Army officials, in particular Secretary Gray and Chief of\r\nStaff Collins, had come to question the conventional pattern.\r\nExplaining later why he favored integration ahead of many of his\r\ncontemporaries, Collins drew on his World War II experience. The major\r\nblack ground units in World War II, and to a lesser degree the 99th\r\nPursuit Squadron, he declared, \"did not work out.\" Nor, he concluded,\r\ndid the smaller independent black units, even those commanded by black\r\nofficers, who were burdened with problems of discipline and\r\ninefficiency. On the other hand, the integrated infantry platoons in\r\nEurope, with which Collins had personal experience, worked well. His\r\nobservations had convinced him that it was \"pointless\" to support\r\nsegregated black units, and while the matter had \"nothing to do with\r\nsociology itself,\" he reasoned that if integration worked at the\r\nplatoon level \"why not on down the line?\" The best plan, he believed,\r\nwas to assign two Negroes to each squad in the Army, always assuming\r\nthat the quota limiting the total number of black soldiers would be\r\npreserved.[17-1]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-1: Interv, author with Collins.]\r\n\r\nBut the Army had promised the Fahy Committee in April 1950 it      (p. 429)\r\nwould abolish the quota. If carried out, such an agreement would\r\ncomplicate an orderly and controlled integration, and Collins's desire\r\nfor change was clearly tempered by his concern for order and control.\r\nSo long as peacetime manpower levels remained low and inductions\r\nthrough the draft limited, a program such as the one contemplated by\r\nthe Chief of Staff was feasible, but any sudden wartime expansion\r\nwould change all that. Fear of such a sudden change combined with the\r\nstrong opposition to integration still shared by most Army officials\r\nto keep the staff from any initiative toward integration in the period\r\nimmediately after the Fahy Committee adjourned.\r\n\r\nEven before Gray and Collins completed their negotiations with the\r\nFahy Committee, they were treated by the Chamberlin Board to yet\r\nanother indication of the scope of Army staff opposition to\r\nintegration. Gray had appointed a panel of senior officers under Lt.\r\nGen. Stephen J. Chamberlin on 18 September 1949 in fulfillment of his\r\npromise to review the Army's racial policy periodically \"in the light\r\nof changing conditions and experiences of this day and time.\"[17-2]\r\nAfter sitting four months and consulting more than sixty major Army\r\nofficials and some 280 officers and men, the board produced a\r\ncomprehensive summary of the Army's racial status based on test\r\nscores, enlistment rates, school figures, venereal disease rates,\r\nopinion surveys, and the like.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-2: Memo, SA for Lt Gen Stephen J.\r\n                   Chamberlin, 30 Nov 49, sub: Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Manpower in the Army, CSGPA 291.2.

VanVoorst, Personnel and\r\n                   Administration Division, as recorder without vote.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusions and recommendations of the Chamberlin Board represent\r\nperhaps the most careful and certainly the last apologia for a\r\nsegregated Army.[17-3] The Army's postwar racial policy and related\r\ndirectives, the board assured Secretary Gray, were sound, were proving\r\neffective, and should be continued in force. It saw only one objection\r\nto segregated units: black units had an unduly high proportion of men\r\nwith low classification test scores, a situation, it believed, that\r\ncould be altered by raising the entrance level and improving training\r\nand leadership. At any rate, the board declared, this disadvantage was\r\na minor one compared to the advantages of an organization that did not\r\nforce Negroes into competition they were unprepared to face, did not\r\nprovoke the resentment of white soldiers with the consequent risk of\r\nlowered combat effectiveness, and avoided placing black officers and\r\nnoncommissioned officers in command of white troops, \"a position which\r\nonly the exceptional Negro could successfully fill.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-3: Memo, Gen Chamberlin et al. for SA, 9\r\n                   Feb 50, sub: Report of Board of Officers on\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Army, AG 291.2\r\n                   (6 Dec 49). A copy of the report and many of the\r\n                   related and supporting documents are in CMH.]\r\n\r\nA decision on these matters, the board stated, had to be based on\r\ncombat effectiveness, not the use of black manpower, and what\r\nconstituted maximum effectiveness was best left to the judgment of\r\nwar-tested combat leaders. These men, \"almost without exception,\"\r\nvigorously opposed integration. Ignoring the Army's continuing     (p. 430)\r\nnegotiations with the Fahy Committee on the matter, the board called\r\nfor retaining the 10 percent quota. To remove the quota without\r\nimposing a higher entrance standard, it argued, would result in an\r\ninflux of Negroes \"with a corresponding deterioration of combat\r\nefficiency.\" In short, ignoring the political and budgetary realities\r\nof the day, the board called on Secretary Gray to repudiate the\r\nfindings of the Fahy Committee and the stipulations of Executive Order\r\n9981 and to maintain a rigidly segregated service with a carefully\r\nregulated percentage of black members.\r\n\r\nWhile Gray and Collins let the recommendations of the Chamberlin Board\r\ngo unanswered, they did very little to change the Army's racial\r\npractices in the year following their agreements with the Fahy\r\nCommittee. The periodic increase in the number of critical specialties\r\nfor which Negroes were to be trained and freely assigned did not\r\nmaterialize. The number of trained black specialists increased, and\r\nsome were assigned to white units, but this practice, while\r\nsubstantially different from the Gillem Board's idea of limiting such\r\nintegration to overhead spaces, nevertheless produced similar results.\r\nBlack specialists continued to be assigned to segregated units in the\r\nmajority of cases, and in the minds of most commanders such assignment\r\nautomatically limited black soldiers to certain jobs and schools no\r\nmatter what their qualifications. Kenworthy's blunt conclusion in May\r\n1951 was that the Army had not carried out the policy it had agreed\r\nto.[17-4] Certainly the Army staff had failed to develop a successful\r\nmechanism for gauging its commanders' compliance with its new policy.\r\nDespite the generally progressive sentiments of General Collins and\r\nSecretary Gray's agreement with the Fahy Committee, much of the Army\r\nclung to old sentiments and practices for the same old reasons.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-4: Kenworthy, \"The Case Against Army\r\n                   Segregation,\" p. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe catalyst for the sudden shift away from these sentiments and\r\npractices was the Korean War. Ranking among the nation's major\r\nconflicts, the war caused the Army to double in size in five months.\r\nBy June 1951 it numbered 1.6 million, with 230,000 men serving in\r\nKorea in the Eighth Army. This vast expansion of manpower and combat\r\ncommitment severely tested the Army's racial policy and immediately\r\naffected the racial balance of the quota-free Army. When the quota was\r\nlifted in April 1950, Negroes accounted for 10.2 percent of the total\r\nenlisted strength; by August this figure reached 11.4 percent. On 1\r\nJanuary 1951, Negroes comprised 11.7 percent of the Army, and in\r\nDecember 1952 the ratio was 13.2 percent. The cause of this striking\r\nrise in black strength was the large number of Negroes among wartime\r\nenlistments. The percentage of Negroes among those enlisting in the\r\nArmy for the first time jumped from 8.2 in March 1950 to 25.2 in\r\nAugust, averaging 18 percent of all first-term enlistments during the\r\nfirst nine months of the war. Black reenlistment increased from 8.5 to\r\n12.9 percent of the total reenlistment during the same period, and the\r\npercentage of black draftees in the total number of draftees supplied\r\nby Selective Service averaged 13 percent.[17-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-5: Memo, G-1 for VCofS, sub: Negro\r\n                   Statistics, 16 Jun 50-6 Oct 50, CS 291.2 Negro;\r\n                   idem for G-3, 18 Apr 51, sub: Training Spaces for\r\n                   Negro Personnel, OPS 291.2; Memo, Chief, Mil Opers\r\n                   Management Branch, G-1, for G-1, 1 Feb 51, sub:\r\n                   Distribution of Negro Manpower in the Army, G-1\r\n                   291.2, and Memo, Chief, Procurement and\r\n                   Distribution Div, G-1, for G-1, 20 Oct 53, same sub\r\n                   and file.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOVING UP. _25th Division infantrymen head for the\r\nfront, Korea, July 1950._]\r\n\r\nThe effect of these increases on a segregated army was tremendous. (p. 431)\r\nBy April 1951, black units throughout the Army were reporting large\r\noverstrengths, some as much as 60 percent over their authorized\r\norganization tables. Overstrength was particularly evident in the\r\ncombat arms because of the steady increase in the number of black\r\nsoldiers with combat occupational specialties. Largely assigned to\r\nservice units during World War II--only 22 percent, about half the\r\nwhite percentage, were in combat units--Negroes after the war were\r\nassigned in ever-increasing numbers to combat occupational specialties\r\nin keeping with the Gillem Board recommendation that they be trained\r\nin all branches of the service. By 1950 some 30 percent of all black\r\nsoldiers were in combat units, and by June 1951 they were being\r\nassigned to the combat branches in approximately the same percentage\r\nas white soldiers, 41 percent.[17-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-6: STM-30, Strength of the Army, Sep 50,\r\n                   Mar 51, and Jul 51.]\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Staff's concern with the Army's segregation policy went\r\nbeyond immediate problems connected with the sudden manpower increases.\r\nSpeaking to Maj. Gen. Lewis A. Craig, the Inspector General, in August\r\n1950, Collins declared that the Army's social policy was unrealistic\r\nand did not represent the views of younger Americans whose attitudes\r\nwere much more relaxed than those of the senior officers who       (p. 432)\r\nestablished policy. Reporting Collins's comment to the staff, Craig\r\nwent on to say the situation in Korea confirmed his own observations\r\nthat mixing whites and blacks \"in reasonable proportions\" did not\r\ncause friction. Continued segregation, on the other hand, would force\r\nthe Army to reinstate the old division-size black unit, with its\r\nineffectiveness and frustrations, to answer the Negro's demand for\r\nequitable promotions and job opportunities. In short, both Collins and\r\nCraig agreed that the Army must eventually integrate, and they wanted\r\nthe use of black servicemen restudied.[17-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-7: IG Summary Sheet for CofS, 7 Dec 50,\r\n                   sub: Policy Regarding Negro Segregation, CS 291.2\r\n                   (7 Dec 50).]\r\n\r\nTheir view was at considerable variance with the attitude displayed by\r\nmost officers on the Army staff and in the major commands in December\r\n1950. His rank notwithstanding, Collins still had to persuade these\r\nmen of the validity of his views before they would accept the\r\nnecessity for integration. Moreover, with his concept of orderly and\r\ncontrolled social change threatened by the rapid rise in the number of\r\nblack soldiers, Collins himself would need to assess the effects of\r\nracial mixing in a fluid manpower situation. These necessities explain\r\nthe plethora of staff papers, special boards, and field investigations\r\npertaining to the employment of black troops that characterized the\r\nnext six months, a period during which every effort was made to\r\nconvince senior officers of the practical necessity for integration.\r\nThe Chief of Staff's exchange of views with the Inspector General was\r\nnot circulated within the staff until December 1950. At that time the\r\npersonnel chief, Lt. Gen. Edward H. Brooks, recommended reconvening\r\nthe Chamberlin Board to reexamine the Army's racial policy in light of\r\nthe Korean experience. Brooks wanted to hold off the review until\r\nFebruary 1951 by which time he thought adequate data would be\r\navailable from the Far East Command. His recommendation was approved,\r\nand the matter was returned to the same group which had so firmly\r\nrejected integration less than a year before.[17-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-8: G-1 Summary Sheet for CofS, 18 Dec 50,\r\n                   sub: Policy Regarding Negro Segregation, G-1\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nEven as the Chamberlin Board was reconvening, another voice was added\r\nto those calling for integration. Viewing the critical overstrength in\r\nblack units, Assistant Secretary Earl D. Johnson recommended\r\ndistributing excess black soldiers among other units of the\r\nArmy.[17-9] The response to his proposal was yet another attempt to\r\navoid the dictates of the draft law and black enlistments. Maj. Gen.\r\nAnthony C. McAuliffe, the G-1, advised against integrating the\r\norganized white units on the grounds that experience gained thus far\r\non the social impact of integration was inadequate to predict its\r\neffect on \"overall Army efficiency.\" Since the Army could not continue\r\nassigning more men to the overstrength black units, McAuliffe wanted\r\nto organize additional black units to accommodate the excess, and he\r\nasked Maj. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, the G-3, to activate the necessary\r\nunits.[17-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-9: Memo, ASA for SA, 3 Apr 51, sub:\r\n                   Present Overstrength in Segregated Units, G-1\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-10: Memo, G-1 for CofS, 26 May 51, sub:\r\n                   Present Overstrength in Segregated Units; DF, G-1\r\n                   for G-3, 16 Apr 51, sub: Training Spaces for Negro\r\n                   Personnel; both in G-1 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Army Field Forces was even more direct. Integration\r\nwas untimely, General Mark W. Clark advised, and the Army should\r\ninstead reimpose the quota and push for speedy implementation of the\r\nSecretary of Defense's directive on the qualitative distribution   (p. 433)\r\nof manpower.[17-11] Clark's plea for a new quota was one of many\r\ncirculating in the staff since black enlistment percentages started to\r\nrise. But time had run out on the quota as a solution to overstrength\r\nblack units. Although the Army staff continued to discuss the need for\r\nthe quota, and senior officials considered asking the President for\r\npermission to reinstitute it, the Secretary of Defense's acceptance of\r\nparity of enlistment standards had robbed the Army of any excuse for\r\nspecial treatment on manpower allotments.[17-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-11: Memo, CG, AFF, for G-1, 8 May 51,\r\n                   sub: Negro Strength in the Army, G-1 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-12: Memo, ASA for SA, 1 Jul 51, and Draft\r\n                   Memo, SA for President (not sent), both in SA\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEN OF BATTERY A, _159th Field Artillery Battalion,\r\nfire 105-mm. howitzer, Korea, August 1950_.]\r\n\r\nMcAuliffe's recommendation for additional black units ran into serious\r\nopposition and was not approved. Taylor's staff, concerned with the\r\npractical problems of Army organization, objected to the proposal,\r\nciting budget limitations that precluded the creation of additional\r\nunits and policy restrictions that forbade the creation of new units\r\nmerely to accommodate black recruits. The operations staff recommended\r\ninstead that black soldiers in excess of unit strength be shipped\r\ndirectly from training centers to overseas commands as replacements\r\nwithout regard for specific assignment. McAuliffe's personnel staff,\r\nin turn, warned that on the basis of a monthly average dispatch of\r\n25,000 replacements to the Far East Command, the portion of Negroes in\r\nthose shipments would be 15 percent for May 1951, 21 percent for June,\r\n22 percent for July, and 16 percent for August. McAuliffe listed the\r\nfamiliar problems that would accrue to the Far East commanders from\r\nthis decision, but he was unable to break the impasse in Washington.\r\nThus the problem of excess black manpower was passed on to the\r\noverseas commanders for resolution.[17-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-13: CMT 2 (Brig Gen D.

Confronted with battle losses in white units and a growing\r\nsurplus of black replacements arriving in Japan, the Eighth Army began\r\nassigning individual black soldiers just as it had been assigning\r\nindividual Korean soldiers to understrength units.[17-14] In August\r\n1950, for example, initial replacements for battle casualties in   (p. 434)\r\nthe 9th Infantry of the U.S. 2d Infantry Division included two black\r\nofficers and eighty-nine black enlisted men. The commander assigned\r\nthem to units in his severely undermanned all-white 1st and 2d\r\nBattalions. In September sixty more soldiers from the regiment's\r\nall-black 3d Battalion returned to the regiment for duty. They were\r\nfirst attached but later, with the agreement of the officers and men\r\ninvolved, assigned to units of the 1st and 2d Battalions.\r\nSubsequently, 225 black replacements were routinely assigned wherever\r\nneeded throughout the regiment.[17-15] By December the 9th Infantry\r\nhad absorbed Negroes to about their proportion of the national\r\npopulation, 11 percent. Of six black officers among them, one\r\ncommanded Company C and another was temporarily in command of Company\r\nB when that unit fought in November on the Ch'ongch'on River line. S.\r\nL. A. Marshall later described Company B as \"possibly the bravest\"\r\nunit in that action.[17-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-14: The Korean Augmentation to the United\r\n                   States Army, known as KATUSA, a program for\r\n                   integrating Korean soldiers in American units, was\r\n                   substantially different from the integration of\r\n                   black Americans in terms of official authorization\r\n                   and management; see CMH study by David C.

L. A. Marshall, \"Integration,\"\r\n                   Detroit _News_, May 13, 1956.]\r\n\r\nThe practice of assigning individual blacks throughout white units in\r\nKorea accelerated during early 1951 and figured in the manpower\r\nrotation program which began in Korea during May. By this time the\r\npractice had so spread that 9.4 percent of all Negroes in the theater\r\nwere serving in some forty-one newly and unofficially integrated\r\nunits.[17-17] Another 9.3 percent were in integrated but predominantly\r\nblack units. The other 81 percent continued to serve in segregated\r\nunits: in March 1951 these numbered 1 black regiment, 10 battalions,\r\n66 separate companies, and 7 separate detachments. Looked at another\r\nway, by May 1951 some 61 percent of the Eighth Army's infantry\r\ncompanies were at least partially integrated.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-17: ORO Technical Memorandum T-99, A\r\n                   Preliminary Report on the Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Manpower, 30 Jun 51, p. 34, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThough still limited, the conversion to integrated units was\r\npermanent. The Korean expedient, adopted out of battlefield necessity,\r\ncarried out haphazardly, and based on such imponderables as casualties\r\nand the draft, passed the ultimate test of traditional American\r\npragmatism: it worked. And according to reports from Korea, it worked\r\nwell. The performance of integrated troops was praiseworthy with no\r\nreport of racial friction.[17-18] It was a test that could not fail to\r\nimpress field commanders desperate for manpower.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-18: Ibid., p. 35. For a popular report on\r\n                   the success of this partial integration, see Harold\r\n                   H. Martin, \"How Do Our Negro Troops Measure Up?,\"\r\n                   _Saturday Evening Post_ 223 (June 16, 1951):30-31.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Training_\r\n\r\nTraining units in the United States were subject to many of the\r\nstresses suffered by the Eighth Army, and without fanfare they too\r\nbegan to integrate. There was little precedent for the change. True,\r\nthe Army had integrated officer training in World War II and basic\r\ntraining at the Women's Army Corps Training Center at Fort Lee,\r\nVirginia, in April 1950. But beyond that only the rare black trainee\r\ndesignated for specialist service was assigned to a white training\r\nunit. Until 1950 there was no effort to mix black and white trainees\r\nbecause the Army's manpower experts always predicted a \"social     (p. 435)\r\nproblem,\" a euphemism for the racial conflict they feared would follow\r\nintegration at large bases in the United States.\r\n\r\nNot that demands for integration ever really ceased. Civil rights\r\norganizations and progressive lawmakers continued to press the Army,\r\nand the Selective Service System itself complained that black draftees\r\nwere being discriminated against even before induction.[17-19] Because\r\nso many protests had focused on the induction process, James Evans,\r\nthe Civilian Aide to the Secretary of Defense, recommended that the\r\ntraditional segregation be abandoned, at least during the period\r\nbetween induction and first assignment.[17-20] Congressman Jacob\r\nJavits, always a critic of the Army's segregation policy, was\r\nparticularly disturbed by the segregation of black trainees at Fort\r\nDix, New Jersey. His request that training units be integrated was\r\npolitely rejected in the fall of 1950 by General Marshall, who implied\r\nthat the subject was an unnecessary intrusion, an attitude\r\ncharacteristic of the Defense Department's war-distracted feelings\r\ntoward integration.[17-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-19: Ltr, Lewis B.

All in SD 291.2 Neg.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the change in Army policy came not because the staff ordered\r\nit, but because local commanders found it necessary. The commanders of\r\nthe nine training divisions in the continental United States were hard\r\npressed because the number of black and white inductees in any monthly\r\ndraft call, as well as their designated training centers, depended on\r\nSelective Service and was therefore unpredictable. It was impossible\r\nfor commanders to arrange for the proper number of separate white and\r\nblack training units and instructors to receive the inductees when no\r\none knew whether a large contingent of black soldiers or a large group\r\nof whites would get off the train. A white unit could be undermanned\r\nand its instructors idle while a black unit was overcrowded and its\r\ninstructors overworked. This inefficient use of their valuable\r\ntraining instructors led commanders, first at Fort Ord and then at the\r\nother training divisions and replacement centers throughout the United\r\nStates, to adopt the expedient of mixing black and white inductees in\r\nthe same units for messing, housing, and training. As the commander of\r\nFort Jackson, South Carolina, put it, sorting out the rapidly arriving\r\ninductees was \"ridiculous,\" and he proceeded to assign new men to\r\nunits without regard to color. He did, however, divert black inductees\r\nfrom time to time \"to hold the Negro population down to a workable\r\nbasis.\"[17-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-22: G-1 Summary Sheet for VCofS, 22 Apr\r\n                   52, sub: Information for the G-1 Information Book,\r\n                   G-1 291.2; Memo, ASA (M&PR) for ASD (M&PR), 22 Aug\r\n                   52, sub: Progress Report on Elimination of\r\n                   Segregation in the Army, SD 291.2; Memo, VCofS for\r\n                   SA, 18 Jun 51, sub: Assimilation of Negroes at Ft.\r\n                   Jackson, S.C., SA 291.2.

He had integrated all\r\nwhite units other than reserve units at his station, he explained  (p. 436)\r\nto the First Army commander in January 1951, but since he was receiving\r\nmany more white trainees than black he would soon be forced to\r\nintegrate his two black training regiments as well by the unprecedented\r\nassignment of white soldiers to black units with black officers and\r\nnoncommissioned officers.[17-23] Actually, such reverse integration\r\nwas becoming commonplace in Korea, and in the case of Fort Dix the\r\nArmy G-1 solved the commander's dilemma by simply removing the\r\nasterisk, which meant black, from the names of the 364th and 365th\r\nInfantry Regiments.[17-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-23: Ltr, Maj Gen W.

Conversion proved trouble-free and permanent; no racial\r\nincidents were reported. In June Assistant Secretary of the Army\r\nJohnson assured the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and\r\nPersonnel, Anna Rosenberg, that current expansion of training\r\ndivisions would allow the Army to avoid in the future even the\r\noccasional funneling of some inductees into temporarily segregated\r\nunits in times of troop overstrengths.[17-25] Logic dictated that\r\nthose who trained together would serve together, but despite\r\nintegrated training, the plethora of Negroes in overseas replacement\r\npipelines, and the increasing amount of integrated fighting in Korea,\r\n98 percent of the Army's black soldiers still served in segregated\r\nunits in April 1951, almost three years after President Truman issued\r\nhis order.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-25: Memo, ASA for ASD (M&P), 5 Jun 51;\r\n                   Memo, SA for ASD (M&P), 3 Sep 52; both in SD\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Performance of Segregated Units_\r\n\r\nAnother factor leading to a change in racial policy was the\r\nperformance of segregated units in Korea. Despite \"acts of heroism and\r\ncapable performance of duty\" by some individuals, the famous old 24th\r\nInfantry Regiment as a whole performed poorly. Its instability was\r\nespecially evident during the fighting on Battle Mountain in August\r\n1950, and by September the regiment had clearly become a \"weak link in\r\nthe 25th Division line,\" and in the Eighth Army as well.[17-26] On 9\r\nSeptember the division commander recommended that the regiment be\r\nremoved from combat. \"It is my considered opinion,\" Maj. Gen. William\r\nB. Kean told the Eighth Army commander, that the 24th Infantry has\r\ndemonstrated in combat that\r\n\r\n     it is untrustworthy and incapable of carrying out missions\r\n     expected of an Infantry Regiment. In making this statement, I am\r\n     fully cognizant of the seriousness of the charges that I am\r\n     making, and the implications involved....

The regiment was unreliable (p. 437)\r\nin combat, particularly on the defensive and at night; it abandoned\r\npositions without warning to troops on its flanks; it wasted\r\nequipment; it was prone to panic and hysteria; and some of its members\r\nwere guilty of malingering. The general made clear that his charges\r\nwere directed at the unit as an organization and not at individual\r\nsoldiers, but he wanted the unit removed and its men reassigned as\r\nreplacements on a percentage basis in the other units of the Eighth\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Kean also claimed to have assigned unusually able officers to\r\nthe regiment, but to no avail. In attempting to lead their men in\r\nbattle, all the unit's commanders had become casualties. Concluding\r\nthat segregated units would not work in a combat situation, the\r\ngeneral believed that the combat value of black soldiers would never\r\nbe realized unless they were integrated into white units at a rate of\r\nnot more than 10 percent.[17-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-28: Observer Report, Lt Col J.

Zundel meanwhile continued the investigation\r\nand in March 1951 offered a more comprehensive assessment of the 24th.\r\nIt was a fact, for example, that 62 percent of the unit's troops were\r\nin categories IV and V as against 41 percent of the troops in the 35th\r\nInfantry and 46 percent in the 27th, the 25th Division's white\r\nregiments. The Gillem Board had recommended supplying all such units\r\nwith 25 percent more officers in the company grades, something not\r\ndone for the 24th Infantry. Some observers also reported evidence in\r\nthe regiment of the lack of leadership and lack of close relationships\r\nbetween officers and men; absence of unit _esprit de corps_;\r\ndiscrimination against black officers; and poor quality of\r\nreplacements.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause of the unit's poor performance, the unanimous\r\nrecommendation in the Eighth Army, its inspector general reported, was\r\nintegration. Yet he perceived serious difficulty in integration. To\r\nmix the troops of the eighty-four major segregated units in the Eighth\r\nArmy under wartime conditions would create an intolerable\r\nadministrative burden and would be difficult for the individuals\r\ninvolved. If integration was limited to the 24th Infantry alone, on\r\nthe other hand, its members, indeed even its former members, would\r\nshare the onus of its failure. The inspector general therefore     (p. 438)\r\nagain recommended retaining the 24th, assigning additional officers\r\nand noncommissioned officers to black units with low test averages,\r\nand continuing the integration of the Eighth Army.[17-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-30: Ltr, EUSAK IG to CG, EUSAK, 15 Mar\r\n                   51, sub: Report of Investigation Concerning 24th\r\n                   Infantry Regiment and Negro Soldiers in Combat,\r\n                   EUSAK IG Report.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURVIVORS OF AN INTELLIGENCE AND RECONNAISSANCE\r\nPLATOON, _24th Infantry, Korea, May 1951_.]\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Army was not alone in investigating the 24th Infantry. The\r\nNAACP was also concerned with reports of the regiment's performance,\r\nin particular with figures on the large number of courts-martial.\r\nThirty-six of the men convicted, many for violation of Article 75 of\r\nthe Articles of War (misbehavior before the enemy), had appealed to\r\nthe association for assistance, and Thurgood Marshall, then one of its\r\ncelebrated attorneys, went to the Far East to investigate. Granted\r\n_carte blanche_ by the Far East commander, General Douglas MacArthur,\r\nMarshall traveled extensively in Korea and Japan reviewing the record\r\nand interviewing the men. His conclusions: \"the men were tried in an\r\natmosphere making justice impossible,\" and the NAACP had the evidence\r\nto clear most of them.[17-31] Contrasting the Army's experiences\r\nwith those of the Navy and the Air Force, Marshall attributed      (p. 439)\r\ndiscrimination in the military justice system to the Army's\r\nsegregation policy. He blamed MacArthur for failing to carry out\r\nTruman's order in the Far East and pointed out that no Negroes served\r\nin the command's headquarters. As long as racial segregation\r\ncontinued, the civil rights veteran concluded, the Army would dispense\r\nthe kind of injustice typical of the courts-martial he reviewed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-31: Thurgood Marshall, _Report on Korea:\r\n                   The Shameful Story of the Courts Martial of Negro\r\n                   GIs_ (New York: NAACP, 1951).]\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to refute Marshall's contention that discrimination\r\nwas a handmaiden of segregation. Not so Walter White's contention that\r\nthe reports of the 24th Infantry's poor performance constituted an\r\nattempt to discredit the combat ability of black soldiers and return\r\nthem to labor duties. The association's executive secretary had fought\r\nracial injustice for many decades, and, considering his World War II\r\nexperiences with the breakup of the 2d Cavalry Division into labor\r\nunits, his acceptance of a conspiracy theory in Korea was\r\nunderstandable. But it was inaccurate. The Army operated under a\r\ndifferent social order in 1951, and many combat leaders in the Eighth\r\nArmy were advocating integration. The number of black service units in\r\nthe Eighth Army, some ninety in March 1951, was comparable to the\r\nnumber in other similar Army commands. Nor, for that matter, was the\r\nnumber of black combat units in the Eighth Army unusual. In March 1951\r\nthe Eighth Army had eighty-four such units ranging in size from\r\nregiment to detachment. Far from planning the conversion of black\r\ncombat troops to service troops, most commanders were recommending\r\ntheir assignment to integrated combat units throughout Korea.\r\n\r\nApprised of these various conclusions, MacArthur ordered his staff to\r\ninvestigate the problem of segregation in the command.[17-32] The Far\r\nEast Command G-1 staff incorporated the inspector general's report in\r\nits study of the problem, adding that \"Negro soldiers can and do fight\r\nwell when integrated.\" The staff went on to dismiss the importance of\r\nleadership as a particular factor in the case of black troops by\r\nobserving that \"no race has a monopoly on stupidity.\"[17-33]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-32: Ltr, Lt Gen Edward Almond, CofS,\r\n                   FECOM, to TIG, 15 Mar 51, IG 333.9.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-33: FECOM Check Sheet, IG to G-1, FEC, 27\r\n                   May 51, sub: Report of Investigation; Memo, FEC G-1\r\n                   for CofS FEC, 30 Apr 51, sub: G-1 Topics Which CINC\r\n                   May Discuss With Gen Taylor.]\r\n\r\nBefore the staff could finish its investigation, General Matthew B.\r\nRidgway replaced MacArthur as Far East commander. Fresh from duty as\r\nEighth Army commander, Ridgway had had close-hand experience with the\r\n24th Infantry's problems; from both a military and a human viewpoint\r\nhe had concluded that segregation was \"wholly inefficient, not to say\r\nimproper.\" He considered integration the only way to assure _esprit de\r\ncorps_ in any large segment of the Army. As for segregation, Ridgway\r\nconcluded, \"it has always seemed to me both un-American and\r\nun-Christian for free citizens to be taught to downgrade themselves\r\nthis way as if they were unfit to associate with their fellows or to\r\naccept leadership themselves.\"[17-34] He had planned to seek\r\nauthorization to integrate the major black units of the Eighth Army in\r\nmid-March, but battlefield preoccupations and his sudden elevation to\r\ntheater command interfered. Once he became commander in chief, however,\r\nhe quickly concurred in his inspector general's recommendation, adding\r\nthat \"integration in white combat units in Korea is a practical    (p. 440)\r\nsolution to the optimum utilization of Negro manpower provided the\r\noverall theater level of Negroes does not exceed 15 percent of troop\r\nlevel and does not exceed over 12 percent in any combat unit.\"[17-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-34: Matthew B. Ridgway, _The Korean War_\r\n                   (New York: Doubleday, 1967), pp. 192-93.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-35: Memorandum for File, FECOM IG, 2 May\r\n                   51, copy in AG 330.1.]\r\n\r\nThe 24th Infantry's experiences struck yet another blow at the Army's\r\nrace policy. Reduce the size of black units, the Gillem Board had\r\nreasoned, and you will reduce inefficiency and discrimination. Such a\r\ncourse had not worked. The same troubles that befell the 92d Division\r\nin Italy were now being visited in Korea on the 24th Infantry, a unit\r\nrich with honors extending back to the Indian fighting after the Civil\r\nWar, the War with Spain, and the Philippine Insurrection. The unit\r\ncould also boast among its medal of honor winners the first man to\r\nreceive the award in Korea, Pfc. William Thompson of Company M. Before\r\nits inactivation in 1951 the 24th had yet another member so honored,\r\nSgt. Cornelius H. Carlton of Company H.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Final Arguments_\r\n\r\nTo concentrate on the widespread sentiment for integration in the Far\r\nEast would misrepresent the general attitude that still prevailed in\r\nthe Army in the spring of 1951. This attitude was clearly reflected\r\nagain by the Chamberlin Board, which completed its reexamination of\r\nthe Army's racial policy in light of the Korean experience in April.\r\nThe board recognized the success of integrated units and even cited\r\nevidence indicating that racial friction had decreased in those units\r\nsince the men generally accepted any replacement willing to fight. But\r\nin the end the board retreated into the Army's conventional wisdom:\r\nseparate units must be retained, and the number of Negroes in the Army\r\nmust be regulated.[17-36]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-36: Report of Board of Officers on\r\n                   Utilization of Negro Manpower (2d Chamberlin\r\n                   Report), 3 Apr 51, G-1 334 (8 Nov 51).]\r\n\r\nThe board's recommendations were not approved. Budgetary limitations\r\nprecluded the creation of more segregated units and the evidence of\r\nKorea could not be denied. Yet the board still enjoyed considerable\r\nsupport in some quarters. The Vice Chief of Staff, General Haislip,\r\nwho made no secret of his opposition to integration, considered it\r\n\"premature\" to rely and act solely on the experience with integration\r\nin Korea and the training divisions, and he told Secretary Pace in May\r\n1951 that \"no action should be taken which would lead to the immediate\r\nelimination of segregated units.\"[17-37] And then there was the\r\nassessment of Lt. Gen. Edward M. Almond, World War II commander of the\r\n92d Division and later X Corps commander in Korea and MacArthur's\r\nchief of staff. Twenty years after the Korean War Almond's attitude\r\ntoward integration had not changed.\r\n\r\n     I do not agree that integration improves military efficiency; I\r\n     believe that it weakens it. I believe that integration was and is\r\n     a political solution for the composition of our military forces\r\n     because those responsible for the procedures either do not\r\n     understand the characteristics of the two human elements      (p. 441)\r\n     concerned, the white man and the Negro as individuals.\r\n     The basic characteristics of Negro and White are fundamentally\r\n     different and these basic differences must be recognized by those\r\n     responsible for integration. By trial and error we must test the\r\n     integration in its application. These persons who promulgate and\r\n     enforce such policies either have not the understanding of the\r\n     problem or they do not have the intestinal fortitude to do what\r\n     they think if they do understand it. There is no question in my\r\n     mind of the inherent difference in races. This is not racism--it\r\n     is common sense and understanding. Those who ignore these\r\n     differences merely interfere with the combat effectiveness of\r\n     battle units.[17-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-37: Memo, Actg CofS for SA, 31 May 51,\r\n                   sub: Negro Strength in the Army, CS 291.2 Negroes\r\n                   (11 Apr 51); see also Interv, author with Haislip,\r\n                   14 Feb 71, CMH files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-38: Incl to Ltr, Almond to CMH, 1 Apr 72,\r\n                   CMH files.]\r\n\r\nThe opinions of senior commanders long identified with segregated\r\nunits in combat carried weight with the middle-ranking staff officers\r\nwho, lacking such experience, were charged with devising policy.\r\nBehind the opinions expressed by many staff members there seemed to be\r\na nebulous, often unspoken, conviction that Negroes did not perform\r\nwell in combat. The staff officers who saw proof for their convictions\r\nin the troubles of the 24th Infantry ignored the possibility that\r\nsegregated units, not individual soldiers, was the problem. Their\r\nattitude explains why the Army continued to delay changes made\r\nimperative by its experience in Korea.\r\n\r\nIt also explains why at this late date the Army turned to the\r\nscientific community for still another review of its racial policy.\r\nThe move originated with the Army's G-3, Maj. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor,\r\nwho in February called for the collection of all information on the\r\nArmy's experiences with black troops in Korea. If the G-1, General\r\nMcAuliffe, did not consider the available data sufficient, General\r\nTaylor added, he would join in sponsoring further investigation in the\r\nFar East.[17-39] The result was two studies. The G-1 sent an Army\r\npersonnel research team, which left for Korea in April 1951, to study\r\nthe Army's regulations for assigning men under combat conditions and\r\nto consider the performance of integrated units.[17-40] On 29 March,\r\nMaj. Gen. Ward S. Maris, the G-4, requested the Operations Research\r\nOffice, a contract agency for the Army, to make a study of how best to\r\nuse black manpower in the Army.[17-41] The G-1 investigation,\r\nundertaken by manpower experts drawn from several Army offices,\r\nconcentrated on the views of combat commanders; the contract agency\r\nreviewed all available data, including a detailed battlefield survey\r\nby social scientists. Both groups submitted preliminary reports in\r\nJuly 1951.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-39: Memo, ACofS, G-3, for ACofS, G-1, 22\r\n                   Feb 51, WDGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-40: Memo, Chief, Pers Mgmt Div, G-1, for\r\n                   CofS, G-3, 6 Mar 51, WDGPA 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-41: Ltr, Maj Gen Ward Maris, G-4, for\r\n                   Dir, ORO, 29 Mar 51, G-4 291.2. The Operations\r\n                   Research Office, a subsidiary of the Johns Hopkins\r\n                   University, performed qualitative and quantitative\r\n                   analyses of strategy, tactics, and materiel. Some\r\n                   of its assignments were subcontracted to other\r\n                   research institutions; all were assigned by the\r\n                   G-4's Research and Development Division and\r\n                   coordinated with the Department of Defense.]\r\n\r\nTheir findings complemented each other. The G-1 team reported that\r\nintegration of black soldiers into white combat units in Korea had\r\nbeen accomplished generally \"without undue friction and with better\r\nutilization of manpower.\" Combat commanders, the team added, \"almost\r\nunanimously favor integration.\"[17-42] The individual soldier's own\r\nmotivation determined his competence, the team concluded. The      (p. 442)\r\ncontract agency, whose report was identified by the code name Project\r\nCLEAR,[17-43] observed that large black units were, on average, less\r\nreliable than large white units, but the effectiveness of small black\r\nunits varied widely. The performance of individual black soldiers in\r\nintegrated units, on the other hand, approximated that of whites. It\r\nfound that white officers commanding black units tended to attribute\r\ntheir problems to race; those commanding integrated units saw their\r\nproblems as military ones. The contract team also confirmed previous\r\nArmy findings that efficient officers and noncommissioned officers,\r\nregardless of race, were accepted by soldiers of both races.\r\nIntegration, it decided, had not lowered white morale, but it had\r\nraised black morale. Virtually all black soldiers supported\r\nintegration, while white soldiers, whatever their private sentiments,\r\nwere not overtly hostile. In most situations, white attitudes toward\r\nintegration became more favorable with firsthand experience. Although\r\nopinions varied, most combat commanders with integration experience\r\nbelieved that a squad should contain not more than two Negroes. In\r\nsum, the Project CLEAR group concluded that segregation hampered the\r\nArmy's effectiveness while integration increased it. Ironically, this\r\nconclusion practically duplicated the verdict of the Army's surveys of\r\nthe integration of black and white units in Europe at the end of World\r\nWar II.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-42: DA Personnel Research Team, \"A\r\n                   Preliminary Report on Personnel Research Data\" (ca.\r\n                   28 Jul 51), AG 333.3.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-43: ORO-T-99, \"A Preliminary Report on\r\n                   the Utilization of Negro Manpower,\" 30 Jun 51,\r\n                   S4-S6, copy in CMH.

The declassification and eventual\r\n                   publication of this very important social document\r\n                   had a long and interesting history; see, for\r\n                   example, Memo, Howard Sacks, Office of the General\r\n                   Counsel, SA, for James C.

Leo Bogart (Chicago: Markham, 1969).]\r\n\r\nGeneral Collins immediately accepted the Project CLEAR conclusions\r\nwhen presented to him verbally on 23 July 1951.[17-44] His endorsement\r\nand the subsequent announcement that the Army would integrate its\r\nforces in the Far East implied a connection which did not exist.\r\nActually, the decision to integrate in Korea was made before Project\r\nCLEAR or the G-1 study appeared. This is not to denigrate the\r\nimportance of these documents. Their justification of integration in\r\nobjective, scientific terms later helped convince Army traditionalists\r\nof the need for worldwide change and absolved the Secretary of the\r\nArmy, his Chief of Staff, and his theater commander of the charge of\r\nhaving made a political and social rather than a military\r\ndecision.[17-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-44: ORO, \"Utilization of Negro Manpower\r\n                   in the Army: A 1951 Study\" (advance draft), pp.\r\n                   viii-ix, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-45: Ltr, Dir, ORO, to G-3, 20 Nov 52, G-3\r\n                   291.2; see also Interv, Nichols with Davis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Integration of the Eighth Army_\r\n\r\nOn 14 May 1951 General Ridgway forced the issue of integration by\r\nformally requesting authority to abolish segregation in his command.\r\nHe would begin with the 24th Infantry, which he wanted to replace\r\nafter reassigning its men to white units in Korea. He would then\r\nintegrate the other combat units and, finally, the service units.  (p. 443)\r\nWhere special skills were not a factor Ridgway wanted to assign his\r\nblack troops throughout the theater to a maximum of 12 percent of any\r\nunit. To do this he needed permission to integrate the 40th and 45th\r\nDivisions, the federalized National Guard units then stationed in\r\nJapan. He based his proposals on the need to maintain the combat\r\neffectiveness of his command where segregated units had proved\r\nineffective and integrated units acceptable.[17-46]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-46: Msg, CINCFE to DA, DA IN 12483, 14\r\n                   May 51, sub: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the\r\n                   FEC; ibid., DA IN 13036, 15 May 51, same sub.

Taylor \"heartily approved,\"\r\ncalling the times auspicious for such a move.[17-47] Of course his\r\noffice quickly approved the plan, and McAuliffe in G-1 and the rest of\r\nthe staff followed suit. There was some sentiment on the staff,\r\neventually suppressed, for retaining the 24th Infantry as an\r\nintegrated unit since the statutory requirement for the four black\r\nregiments had been repealed in 1950.[17-48] The staff did insist, over\r\nthe G-1's objections, on postponing the integration of the two\r\nNational Guard divisions until their arrival in Korea, where the\r\nchange could be accomplished through normal replacement-rotation\r\nprocedures.[17-49] There were other minor complications and\r\nmisunderstandings between the Far East Command and the Army staff over\r\nthe timing of the order, but they were easily ironed out.[17-50]\r\nCollins discussed the plan with the appropriate congressional\r\nchairmen, Ridgway further briefed the Secretary of Defense during\r\nGeneral Marshall's 1951 visit to Japan, and Secretary of the Army Pace\r\nkept the President informed.[17-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-47: Ridgway, _The Korean War_, p. 192.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-48: Section 401, Army Organization Act of\r\n                   1950 (PL 581, 81st Cong.), published in DA Bull 9,\r\n                   6 Jul 50.

A\r\nHarvard-trained lawyer with impressive managerial skills, Pace did not\r\noriginate any of the Army's racial programs, but he fully supported\r\nthe views of his Chief of Staff, General Collins.[17-52] Meeting with\r\nhis senior civilian assistants, the G-1 and G-3 of the Army, and\r\nAssistant Secretary of Defense Rosenberg on 9 June, Pace admitted that\r\ntheir discussions were being conducted \"probably with a view to\r\nachieving complete integration in the Army.\" Nevertheless, he stressed\r\na cautionary approach because \"once a step was taken it was very much\r\nharder to retract.\" He was particularly worried about the high\r\npercentage of black soldiers, 12.5 percent of the Army's total,\r\ncompared with the percentage of Negroes in the other services. He\r\nsummarized the three options still under discussion in the Department\r\nof the Army: Ridgway's call for complete integration in Korea, followed\r\nby integration of Army elements in Japan, with a 10 percent limit  (p. 444)\r\non black replacements; Mark Clark's proposal to ship black combat\r\nbattalions to Korea to be used at the division commanders' discretion,\r\nwith integration limited to combat-tested individuals and then only in\r\nsupport units; and, finally, the Army staff's decision to continue\r\nsending replacements for use as the Far East Command saw fit.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-52: Interv, author with Collins.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL RIDGWAY.]\r\n\r\nCommenting on the Ridgway proposal, one participant pointed out that a\r\n10 percent limit on black replacements, even if integration spread to\r\nthe European Command, would mean that the majority of the Army's\r\nNegroes would remain in the United States. Rosenberg, however,\r\npreferred the Ridgway plan. Stressing that it was an Army decision and\r\nthat she was \"no crusader,\" she nevertheless reminded Secretary Pace\r\nthat the Army needed to show some progress. Rosenberg mentioned the\r\nthreat of a Congress which might force more drastic measures upon the\r\nArmy and pointedly offered to defer answering her many congressional\r\ninquisitors until the Army reached a decision.[17-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-53: Memo for Rcd, Col James F.

A message went out\r\nto General Ridgway approving \"deactivation of the 24th Infantry and\r\nyour general plan for integration of Negroes into all units (with the\r\ntemporary exception of the 40th and 45th Divisions).\"[17-54] The staff\r\nwanted the move to be gradual, progressive, and secret to avoid any\r\npossible friction in the Eighth Army and to win general acceptance for\r\nintegration. But it did not remain secret for long. In the face of\r\nrenewed public criticism for its segregated units and after lengthy\r\nstaff discussion, the Army announced the integration of the Far East\r\nCommand on 26 July, the third anniversary of the Truman order.[17-55]\r\nProminent among the critics of the Army's delay was General MacArthur,\r\nwho publicly blamed President Truman for the continued segregation of\r\nhis former command. The charge, following as it did the general's\r\ndismissal, was much discussed in the press and the Department of\r\nDefense. Easily disputed, it was eventually overtaken by the fact of\r\nintegration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-54: Msg, DA to CINCFE, DA 95359, 1 Jul\r\n                   51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-55: Memo, Chief, Public Info Div, CINFO,\r\n                   for Dir, Office of Public Info, DOD, 26 Jul 51; DOD\r\n                   Press Release, 26 Jul 51.

The first, inactivation of the 24th Infantry and the choice of\r\na replacement, was quickly overcome. From the replacements suggested,\r\nRidgway decided on the 14th Infantry, which had been recently assigned,\r\nminus men and equipment, to the Far East Command. It was filled with\r\ntroops and equipment from the 34th Infantry, then training replacements\r\nin Japan. On 1 October it was assigned to the 24th's zone of\r\nresponsibility in the 25th Division's line. The 24th Infantry, its men\r\nand equipment transferred to other infantry units in Korea, was\r\ninactivated on 1 October and \"transferred to the control of the\r\nDepartment of the Army.\"[17-56]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-56: Per Ltr, TAG to CINCFE, 9 Aug 51,\r\n                   AGAO-I 322 (26 Jul 51), implemented by Eighth Army\r\n                   GO 717, 22 Sep 51.]\r\n\r\nThe second problem, integration of units throughout the command,\r\nproved more difficult and time-consuming. Ridgway considered the need\r\nmost urgent in the infantry units and wanted their integration to take\r\nprecedence. The 3d Battalion of the 9th Infantry was reorganized\r\nfirst, many of its black members scattered throughout other infantry\r\nunits in the 2d Division. But then things got out of phase. To speed\r\nthe process the Army staff dropped its plan for inactivating all\r\nsegregated units and decided simply to remove the designation\r\n\"segregated\" and assign white soldiers to formerly all-black units.\r\nBefore this form of integration could take place in the 3d Battalion,\r\n15th Infantry, the last major black infantry unit, the 64th Tank\r\nBattalion and the 58th Armored Field Artillery Battalion began the\r\nprocess of shifting their black troops to nearby white units. The 77th\r\nEngineer Combat Company was the last combat unit to lose the asterisk,\r\nthe Army's way of designating a unit black.[17-57] The command was\r\noriginally committed to an Army contingency plan that would transfer\r\nblack combat troops found superfluous to the newly integrated units to\r\nservice units, but this proved unnecessary. All segregated combat\r\ntroops were eventually assigned to integrated combat units.[17-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-57: Msg, DA 81846, 19 Sep 51; Eighth Army\r\n                   GO 774, 16 Oct 51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-58: FECOM Mil Hist Section, \"History of\r\n                   the Korean War,\" III (pt. 2):153-57.]\r\n\r\nTo soften the emotional aspects of the change, troop transfers were\r\nscheduled as part of the individual soldier's normal rotation. By the\r\nend of October 1951 the Eighth Army had integrated some 75 percent of\r\nits infantry units. The process was scheduled for completion by\r\nDecember, but integration of the rest of its combat units and the\r\ngreat number of service units dragged on for another half year. It was\r\nnot until May 1952 that the last divisional and nondivisional\r\norganizations were integrated.[17-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-59: Memo, ASA (M&RF) for ASD (M&P), 22\r\n                   Aug 52, sub: Integration of Negro Manpower, SD\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe third and greatest problem in the integration of the Far East\r\nCommand was how to achieve a proportionate distribution of black\r\ntroops throughout the command. Ridgway was under orders to maintain\r\nblack strength at a maximum 12 percent except in combat infantry\r\nunits, where the maximum was 10 percent. The temporary restriction on\r\nintegrating the 40th and 45th Divisions and the lack of specially\r\ntrained Negroes eligible for assignment to the Japan Logistical\r\nCommand added to the difficulty of achieving this goal, but the basic\r\ncause of delay was the continued shipment of black troops to the   (p. 446)\r\nFar East in excess of the prescribed percentage. During the integration\r\nperiod the percentage of black replacements averaged between 12.6 and\r\n15 percent and occasionally rose above 15 percent.[17-60] Ridgway\r\nfinally got permission from Washington to raise the ratio of black\r\nsoldiers in his combat infantry units to 12 percent, and further\r\nrelief could be expected in the coming months when the two National\r\nGuard divisions began integrating.[17-61] Still, in October 1951 the\r\nproportion of Negroes in the Eighth Army had risen to 17.6 percent,\r\nand the flow of black troops to the Far East continued unabated,\r\nthreatening the success of the integration program. Ridgway repeatedly\r\nappealed for relief, having been warned by his G-1 that future black\r\nreplacements must not exceed 10 percent if the integration program was\r\nto continue successfully.[17-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-60: Ibid.; Stillwaugh, \"Personnel\r\n                   Problems in the Korean Conflict,\" pp. 33-35.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-61: Msg, CSA to CINCFE, DA 96489, 18 Jul\r\n                   51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-62: Journal Files, G-1, FEC, Oct 51,\r\n                   Annex 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINE GUNNERS OF COMPANY L, 14TH INFANTRY, _Hill 931,\r\nKorea, September 1952_.]\r\n\r\nRidgway was particularly concerned with the strain on his program\r\ncaused by the excessive number of black combat replacements swelling\r\nthe percentage of Negroes in his combat units. By September black\r\ncombat strength reached 14.2 percent, far above the limits set by\r\nthe Army staff. Ridgway wanted combat replacements limited to 12   (p. 447)\r\npercent. He also proposed that his command be allowed to request\r\nreplacements by race and occupational specialty in order to provide\r\nArmy headquarters with a sound basis for allotting black enlisted men\r\nto the Far East. While the Army staff promised to try to limit the\r\nnumber of black combat troops, it rejected the requisition scheme.\r\nSelection for occupational specialist training was not made by race,\r\nthe G-1 explained, and the Army could not control the racial\r\nproportions of any particular specialty. Since the Army staff had no\r\ncontrol over the number of Negroes in the Army, their specialties or\r\nthe replacement needs of the command, no purpose would be served by\r\ngranting such a request.[17-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-63: Rad, CINCFE for DA, DA IN 182547, 11\r\n                   Sep 52, sub: Negro Personnel; Msg, DA to CINCFE, 23\r\n                   Sep 52, G-1 291.2.]\r\n\r\nYet Ridgway's advice could not be ignored, because by year's end the\r\nwhole Army had developed a vested interest in the success of\r\nintegration in the Far East. The service was enjoying the praise of\r\ncivil rights congressmen, much of the metropolitan press, and even\r\nsome veterans' groups, such as the Amvets.[17-64] Secretary Pace was\r\nmoved to call the integration of the Eighth Army a notable advance in\r\nthe field of human relations.[17-65] But most of all, the Army began\r\nto experience the fruits of racial harmony. Much of the conflict and\r\nconfusion among troops that characterized the first year of the war\r\ndisappeared as integration spread, and senior officials commented\r\npublicly on the superior military efficiency of an integrated Army in\r\nKorea.[17-66] As for the men themselves, their attitudes were in sharp\r\ncontrast to those predicted by the Army traditionalists. The\r\nconclusion of some white enlisted men, wounded and returned from\r\nKorea, were typical:\r\n\r\n     Far as I'm concerned it [integration] worked pretty good.... When\r\n     it comes to life or death, race does not mean any difference....\r\n     It's like one big family.... Got a colored guy on our machine gun\r\n     crew--after a while I wouldn't do without him.... Concerning\r\n     combat, what I've seen, an American is an American. When we have\r\n     to do something we're all the same.... Each guy is like your own\r\n     brother--we treated all the same.... Had a colored platoon\r\n     leader. They are as good as any people....

But\r\nthis solution was frustrated by the segregation still in force in\r\nother commands. Organized black units in the United States were small\r\nand few in number, and black recruits who could not be used in them\r\nwere shipped as replacements to the overseas commands, principally in\r\nthe Far East and Europe.[17-68] Consequently, Ridgway's problem was\r\nnot an isolated one; his European counterpart was operating a largely\r\nsegregated command almost 13 percent black. The Army could not prevent\r\nblack overstrengths so long as Negroes were ordered into the\r\nquota-free service by color-blind draft boards, but it could equalize\r\nthe overstrength by integrating its forces all over the world.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-68: In 1951 the European Command was the\r\n                   major Army headquarters in the European theater. It\r\n                   was, at the same time, a combined command with some\r\n                   20,000 members of the Air Force and Navy serving\r\n                   along with 234,000 Army troops. In August 1952 a\r\n                   separate Army command (U.S. Army, Europe) was\r\n                   created within the European Command.

But they wanted certain reassurances.\r\nBelieving that integration of the continental commands would create,\r\nin the words of the G-1, \"obstacles and difficulties vastly greater\r\nthan those in FECOM,\" the Army staff wanted these problems         (p. 449)\r\nthoroughly analyzed before taking additional moves, \"experimental or\r\notherwise,\" to broaden integration.[17-69] General Collins, although\r\npersonally committed to integration, voiced another widespread concern\r\nover extending integration beyond the Far East units. Unlike the Navy\r\nand the Air Force, which were able to secure more highly qualified men\r\non a volunteer basis, the Army had long been forced to accept anyone\r\nmeeting the draft's minimum standards. This circumstance was very\r\nlikely to result, he feared, in an army composed to an unprecedented\r\ndegree of poorly educated black soldiers, possibly as much as 30\r\npercent in the near future.[17-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-69: Memo, G-1 for DCofS, Admin, 18 Jul\r\n                   51, G-1 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-70: Ltr, Eli Ginzberg to Lt Col Edward J.\r\n                   Barta, Hist Div, USAREUR, attached to Ltr, Ginzberg\r\n                   to Carter Burgess, ASD (M&P), 11 Nov 55, SD 291.2\r\n                   (11 Nov 55).]\r\n\r\nThe Army's leaders received the necessary reassurances in the coming\r\nmonths. The Secretary of Defense laid to rest their fear that the\r\ndraft-dependent Army would become a dumping ground for the ignorant\r\nand untrainable when, in April 1951, he directed that troops must be\r\ndistributed among the services on a qualitative basis. Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Army Johnson asked Professor Eli Ginzberg, a social\r\nscientist and consultant to the Army, to explain to the Army Policy\r\nCouncil the need for aggressive action to end segregation.[17-71] And\r\nonce again, but this time with considerable scientific detail to\r\nsupport its recommendations, the Project CLEAR final report told Army\r\nleaders that the service should be integrated worldwide. Again the\r\nresearchers found that the Army's problem was not primarily racial,\r\nbut a question of how best to use underqualified men. Refining their\r\nearlier figures, they decided that black soldiers were best used in\r\nintegrated units at a ratio of 15 to 85. Integration on the job was\r\nconducive to social integration, they discovered, and social\r\nintegration, dependent on several variables, was particularly amenable\r\nto firm policy guidance and local control. Finally, the report found\r\nthat integration on military posts was accepted by local civilians as\r\na military policy unlikely to affect their community.[17-72]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-71: Ltr, Ginzberg to Burgess, 11 Nov 55.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-72: ORO-R-11, Rpt, Utilization of Negro\r\n                   Manpower in the Army, Project CLEAR, vol. 1; G-1\r\n                   Summary Sheet for CofSA, 5 Jan 52, sub: Evaluation\r\n                   of ORO-R-11 on Utilization of Negro Manpower in the\r\n                   Army, CS 291.2 Negroes (5 Jan 52).]\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Staff approved the Project CLEAR final report, although\r\nhis staff had tried to distinguish between the report's view of\r\non-the-job integration and social integration, accepting the former\r\nwith little reservation, but considering the latter to be \"weak in\r\nsupporting evidence.\" The personnel staff continued to stress the need\r\nto reimpose a racial quota quickly without waiting for black\r\nenrollment to reach 15 percent as the Project CLEAR report suggested.\r\nIt also believed that integration should be limited to the active\r\nfederal service, exempting National Guard units under state control.\r\nGeneral McAuliffe agreed to drop racial statistics but warned that\r\ninvestigation of discrimination charges depended on such statistics.\r\nHe also agreed that blacks could be mixed with whites at 10 to 20\r\npercent of the strength of any white unit, but to assign whites in\r\nsimilar percentages to black units \"would undoubtedly present\r\ndifficulties and place undue burdens on the assigned white personnel.\"\r\nFinally, McAuliffe stressed that commanders would have flexibility (p. 450)\r\nin working out the nonoperational aspects of integration so long as\r\ntheir methods and procedures were consistent with Army policy.[17-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-73: G-1 Summary Sheet for CofSA, 5 Jan\r\n                   52.]\r\n\r\nThese reservations aside, McAuliffe concluded that integration was\r\nworking in enough varied circumstances to justify its extension to the\r\nentire Army. General Collins agreed, and on 29 December 1951 he\r\nordered all major commanders to prepare integration programs for their\r\ncommands. Integration was the Army's immediate goal, and, he added, it\r\nwas to be progressive, in orderly stages, and without publicity.[17-74]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-74: Ibid., 29 Dec 51, sub: Integration of\r\n                   Negro Enlisted Personnel, G-1 291.2 Negroes.]\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Staff's decision was especially timely for the European\r\nCommand where General Thomas T. Handy faced manpower problems similar\r\nto if not so critical as those in the Far East. During 1951 Army\r\nstrength in Europe had also risen sharply--from 86,000 to 234,000 men.\r\nBlack strength had increased even more dramatically, from 8,876 (or 11\r\npercent) to 27,267 (or 13 percent). The majority of black soldiers in\r\nEurope served in segregated units, the number of which more than\r\ndoubled because of the Korean War. From sixty-six units in June 1950,\r\nthe figure rose to 139 in March 1952. Most of these units were not in\r\ndivisions but in service organizations; 113 were service units, of\r\nwhich fifty-three were transportation units.\r\n\r\nAgain as in the Far East, some integration in Europe occurred in\r\nresponse to the influx of new soldiers as well as to Army directives.\r\nHandy integrated his Noncommissioned Officers' Academy in 1950 in an\r\noperation involving thousands of enlisted men. After he closed the\r\nsegregated Kitzingen Training Center in February 1951, black troops\r\nwere absorbed into other training and replacement centers on an\r\nintegrated basis. For some time Army commanders in Europe had also\r\nbeen assigning certain black soldiers with specialist training to\r\nwhite units, a practice dramatically accelerated in 1950 when the\r\ncommand began receiving many Negroes with occupation specialties\r\nunneeded in black units. In March 1951 Handy directed that, while the\r\nassignment of Negroes to black units remained the first priority,\r\nNegroes possessing qualifications unusable or in excess of the needs\r\nof black units would be assigned where they could be used most\r\neffectively.[17-75] Consequently, by the end of 1951 some 7 percent of\r\nall black enlisted men, 17 percent of the black officers, and all\r\nblack soldiers of the Women's Army Corps in the command were serving\r\nin integrated units.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-75: Ltr, EUCOM to Sub Cmds, 16 Mar 51,\r\n                   sub: Utilization of Negro Personnel, USAREUR SGS\r\n                   291.2.

Sent by\r\nAssistant Secretary Johnson to brief European commanders on the Army's\r\ndecision, Eli Ginzberg met with almost universal skepticism. Most\r\ncommanders were unaware of the Army's success with integration in the\r\nFar East and in the training divisions at home; when so informed they\r\nwere quick to declare such a move impractical for Europe. They warned\r\nof the social problems that would arise with the all-white civilian\r\npopulation and predicted that the Army would be forced to abandon  (p. 451)\r\nthe program in midstream.[17-76]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-76: Ltr, Ginzberg to Burgess, 11 Nov 55,\r\n                   CMH files.]\r\n\r\nThere were exceptions. Lt. Gen. Manton S. Eddy, the commander of the\r\nSeventh Army, described the serious operational problems caused by\r\nsegregation in his command. Most of his black units were\r\nunsatisfactory, and without minimizing the difficulties he concluded\r\nin 1951 that integration was desirable not only for the sake of his\r\nown mission but for the Army's efficiency and the nation's world\r\nleadership. Officers at Headquarters, Supreme Allied Powers, Europe,\r\nalso recited personnel and training problems caused in their command\r\nby segregation, but here, Ginzberg noted, the attitude was one of\r\ncautious silence, an attitude that made little difference because\r\nGeneral Eisenhower's command was an international organization having\r\nnothing to do with the Army's race policies. It would, however, be of\r\nsome interest during the 1952 political campaign when some\r\ncommentators made the false claim that Eisenhower had integrated\r\nAmerican units in Europe.[17-77]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-77: See, for example, _Pathfinder_\r\n                   Magazine 58 (May 7, 1952):11.

This consultation, and a series of\r\nexchanges between McAuliffe and command officials, led Collins to ask\r\nHandy to submit an integration plan as quickly as possible.[17-78]\r\nHandy complied with a proposal that failed on the whole to conform to\r\nthe Army's current plans for worldwide integration and was quickly\r\namended in Washington. The European Command would not, Collins\r\ndecreed, conduct a special screening of its black officers and noncoms\r\nfor fitness for combat duty. The command would not retain segregated\r\nservice units, although the Army would allow an extension of the\r\nprogram's timetable to accomplish the integration of these units.\r\nFinally, the command would stage no publicity campaign but would\r\ninstead proceed quietly and routinely. The program was to begin in\r\nApril 1952.[17-79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-78: Msg, CofSA to CINCEUR, 4 Dec 51, DA\r\n                   88688.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-79: Ltr, AG, EUCOM, to CofSA, 14 Dec 51,\r\n                   sub: Racial Integration in Combat Units; G-1\r\n                   Summary Sheet, 24 Jan 52, same sub; Ltr, CofSA to\r\n                   Handy, 15 Feb 52; Msg, CINCEUR to CofSA, 22 Mar 52,\r\n                   DA IN 119235; Msg, CofSA to CINCEUR, DA 904459, 24\r\n                   Mar 52.

Handy directed that Negroes be assigned\r\nas individuals in a 1 to 10 ratio in all units although he would\r\ntolerate a higher ratio in service and temporary duty units during the\r\nearly stages of the program.[17-80] This figure was adjusted upward\r\nthe following year to a maximum of 12 percent black for armor and\r\ninfantry units, 15 percent for combat engineers and artillery, and\r\n17.5 percent for all other units. During the process of integrating\r\nthe units, a 25 percent black strength was authorized.[17-81]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-80: Memo, CINCEUCOM for Commanding\r\n                   Generals et al., 1 Apr 52, sub: Racial Integration\r\n                   of EUCOM Army Units, copy in CS 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-81: Sher Monograph, p. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe ratios were raised because the percentage of Negroes in the    (p. 452)\r\ncommand continued to exceed the 1 to 10 ratio and was still\r\nincreasing. In September 1953 the new commander, General Alfred M.\r\nGruenther, tried to slow the rate of increase.[17-82] He got\r\nWashington to halt the shipment of black units, and he himself\r\ninstituted stricter reenlistment standards in Europe. Finally, he\r\nwarned that with fewer segregated units to which black troops might be\r\nassigned, the racial imbalance was becoming more critical, and he\r\nasked for a deferment of the program's completion.[17-83] The Army\r\nstaff promised to try to alleviate the racial disproportions in the\r\nreplacement stream, but asked Gruenther to proceed as quickly as\r\npossible with integration.[17-84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-82: As of 1 August 1952 the major joint\r\n                   American command in Europe was designated U.S.\r\n                   European Command (USEUCOM). The U.S. Army element\r\n                   in this command was designated U.S. Army, Europe\r\n                   (USAREUR). Gruenther was the commander in chief of\r\n                   the European Command from July 1953 to November\r\n                   1956. At the same time he occupied the senior\r\n                   position in the NATO Command under the title\r\n                   Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-83: Memo, USCINCEUR for TAG, 30 Sep 53,\r\n                   sub: Racial Integration of USAREUR Units, AG 291.2\r\n                   (30 Sep 53); see also Sher Monograph, pp. 24-27.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-84: Memos, G-1 for TAG, 30 Oct 53, sub:\r\n                   Negro Overstrength in USAREUR, and TAG for\r\n                   USCINCEUR, 2 Nov 53, same sub; both in AG 291.2 (30\r\n                   Oct 53).]\r\n\r\nThere was little the Army staff could do. The continental commands had\r\nthe same overstrength problem, and the staff considered the European\r\nCommand an inappropriate place to raise black percentages. By mid-1953\r\nNegroes accounted for some 16 percent of Army personnel in Europe and,\r\nmore important to the command, the number of Negroes with combat\r\noccupation specialties continued to increase at the same rate. As an\r\nalternative to the untenable practice of reclassifying combat-trained\r\nmen for noncombat assignments purely on account of race, Gruenther\r\nagain raised the acceptable ratio of blacks in combat units. At the\r\nsame time he directed the Seventh Army commander to treat ratios in\r\nthe future merely as guidelines, to be adhered to as circumstances\r\npermitted.[17-85] The percentage of Negroes in the command leveled off\r\nat this time, but not before the black proportion of the command's\r\ntransportation units reached 48.8 percent. Summing up his command's\r\npolicy on integration, Gruenther concluded: \"I cannot permit the\r\nassignment of large numbers of unqualified personnel, regardless of\r\nrace, to prejudice the operation readiness of our units in an effort\r\nto attain 100 percent racial integration, however desirable that goal\r\nmay be.\"[17-86] A heavy influx of white replacements with\r\ntransportation specialties allowed the European Command to finish\r\nintegrating the elements of the Seventh Army in July 1954.[17-87] The\r\nlast black unit in the command, the 94th Engineer Battalion, was\r\ninactivated in November.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-85: Ltr, USCINCEUR to CG, Seventh Army, 8\r\n                   Jul 53, sub: Racial Integration of USAREUR Units,\r\n                   USAREUR AG 291.2 (1953).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-86: Ltr, CINCUSAREUR to SACEUR, 10 Apr\r\n                   53, USAREUR SGS 291.2 (1953), quoted in Sher\r\n                   Monograph, p. 28.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-87: Hq USAREUR, \"Annual Historical\r\n                   Report, 1 January 1953-30 June 1954,\" p. 60, in\r\n                   CMH.]\r\n\r\nIntegration of black troops in Europe proved successful on several\r\ncounts, with the Army, in Assistant Secretary Fred Korth's words,\r\n\"achieving benefits therefrom substantially greater than we\r\nhad anticipated at its inception.\"[17-88] The command's combat     (p. 453)\r\nreadiness increased, he claimed, while its racial incidents and\r\ndisciplinary problems declined. The reaction of the soldiers was,\r\nagain in Korth's words, \"generally good\" with incidents stemming from\r\nintegration \"fewer and much farther between.\" Moreover, the program\r\nhad been a definite advantage in counteracting Communist propaganda,\r\nwith no evidence of problems with civilians arising from social\r\nintegration. More eloquent testimony to the program's success appeared\r\nin the enthusiasm of the European Command's senior officials.[17-89]\r\nTheir fears and uncertainties eased, they abruptly reversed their\r\nattitudes and some even moved from outright opposition to praise for\r\nthe program as one of their principal achievements.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-88: Memo, ASA (M&RF) for J.

As early as\r\nSeptember 1951 the Army G-1 discovered instances of unauthorized\r\nintegration in every Army area,[17-91] the result of either\r\nunrectified administrative errors or the need to find suitable\r\nassignments for black replacements. \"The concern shown by you over the\r\npress reaction to integrating these men into white units,\" the Sixth\r\nArmy commander, Lt. Gen. Joseph M. Swing, reported to the Army staff,\r\n\"causes me to guess that your people may not realize the extent to\r\nwhich integration has already progressed--at least in the Sixth\r\nArmy.\"[17-92] Swing concluded that gradual integration had to be the\r\nsolution to the Army's race problems everywhere. McAuliffe agreed with\r\nSwing that the continental commands should be gradually integrated,\r\nbut, as he put it, \"the difficulty is that my superiors are not\r\nprepared to admit that we are already launched on a progressive\r\nintegration program\" in the United States.

Nevertheless, even while the integration of the\r\nFar East forces was proceeding, General McAuliffe's office prepared a\r\ncomprehensive two-phase plan for the integration of the continental\r\narmies. It would consolidate all temporary units then separated into\r\nracial elements, redistributing all Negroes among the organized white\r\nunits; then, Negroes assigned to black components of larger white\r\nunits would be absorbed into similar white units through normal\r\nattrition or by concentrated levies on the black units.

The breakdown of the \"10\r\npercent Army\" proceeded uneventfully, and the old black units\r\ndisappeared. The 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments, now converted into\r\nthe 509th and 510th Tank Battalions (Negro), received white\r\nreplacements and dropped the racial designation. The 25th Infantry,\r\nnow broken down into smaller units, was integrated in September 1952.\r\nOn 12 October 1953 Assistant Secretary of Defense John Hannah\r\nannounced that 95 percent of the Army's Negroes were serving in\r\nintegrated units with the rest to be so assigned not later than June\r\n1954.[17-95] His estimate was off by several months. The European  (p. 455)\r\nCommand's 94th Engineer Battalion, the last major all-black unit, was\r\ninactivated in November 1954, several weeks after the Secretary of\r\nDefense had announced the end of all segregated units.[17-96]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-95: _U.S. News and World Report_ 35\r\n                   (October 16, 1953):99-100.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-96: Hq USAREUR, \"Annual Historical\r\n                   Report, 1 July 1954-30 June 1955,\" p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROTHERS UNDER THE SKIN, _inductees at Fort Sam\r\nHouston, Texas, 1953_.]\r\n\r\nLike a man who discovers that his profitable deeds are also virtuous,\r\nthe Army discussed its new racial policy with considerable pride. From\r\ncompany commander to general officer the report was that the Army\r\nworked better; integration was desirable, and despite all predictions\r\nto the contrary, it was a success. Military commentators in and out of\r\nuniform stoutly defended the new system against its few\r\ncritics.[17-97] Most pointed to Korea as the proving ground for the\r\nnew policy. Assistant Secretary of Defense Hannah generalized about\r\nthe change to integration: \"Official analyses and reports indicate a\r\ndefinite increase in combat effectiveness in the overseas areas....\r\nFrom experience in Korea and elsewhere, Army commanders have       (p. 456)\r\ndetermined, also, that more economical and effective results accrue\r\nfrom the policies which remove duplicate facilities and operations\r\nbased upon race.\"[17-98] The Army, it would seem, had made a complete\r\nabout-face in its argument from efficiency.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-97: See, for example, _Semiannual Report\r\n                   of the Secretary of Defense, January 1-June 30,\r\n                   1933_, p. 24; ibid., January 1-June 30, 1954, pp.\r\n                   21-22; and annual reports of the Secretary of the\r\n                   Army for same period, as well as CINCUSAREUR's\r\n                   response to criticisms by General Mark Clark, _Army\r\n                   Times_, May 19, 1956, and S.

It also stilled several genuine fears long entertained by\r\nmilitary leaders. Many thoughtful officials had feared that the social\r\nmingling that would inevitably accompany integration in the\r\ncontinental United States might lead to racial incidents and a\r\nbreakdown in discipline. The new policy seemed to prove this fear\r\ngroundless.[17-99] A 1953 Army-sponsored survey reported that, with\r\nthe single major exception of racially separate dances for enlisted\r\nmen at post-operated service clubs on southern bases, segregation\r\ninvolving uniformed men and women now stopped at the gates of the\r\nmilitary reservation.[17-100] Army headquarters, carefully monitoring\r\nthe progress of social integration, found it without incident.[17-101]\r\nAt the same time the survey revealed that some noncommissioned\r\nofficers' clubs and enlisted men's clubs tended to segregate\r\nthemselves, but no official notice was taken of this tendency, and not\r\none such instance was a source of racial complaint in 1953. The survey\r\nalso discovered that racial attitudes in adjacent communities had\r\nsurprisingly little influence on the relations between white and black\r\nsoldiers on post. Nor was there evidence of any appreciable resentment\r\ntoward integration on the part of white civilian employees, even when\r\nthey worked with or under black officers and enlisted men.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-99: One exception was the strong\r\n                   objection in some states to racially mixed\r\n                   marriages contracted by soldiers.

But even here restrictions were not uniform.\r\nMutual use of dance floors by white and black couples was frequent\r\nthough not commonplace and was accepted in officers' clubs, many\r\nnoncommissioned officers' clubs, and at special unit affairs. The\r\nrules for social integration were flexible, and many adjustments could\r\nbe made to the sentiments of the community if the commander had the\r\nwill and the tact. Some commanders, unaware of what was being\r\naccomplished by progressive colleagues, were afraid to establish a\r\nprecedent, and often avoided practices that were common elsewhere.\r\nSocial scientists reviewing the situation suggested that the Army\r\nshould acquaint the commanders with the existing wide range of social\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nFear of congressional disapproval, another reason often given for\r\ndeferring integration, was exaggerated, as a meeting between Senator\r\nRichard B. Russell and James Evans in early 1952 demonstrated.     (p. 457)\r\nAt the request of the manpower secretary, Evans went to Capitol Hill\r\nto inform the chairman of the Armed Services Committee that for\r\nreasons of military efficiency the Army was going to integrate.\r\nSenator Russell observed that he had been unable to do some things he\r\nwanted to do \"because your people [black voters] weren't strong enough\r\npolitically to support me.\" Tell the secretary, Russell added, \"that I\r\nwon't help him integrate, but I won't hinder him either--and neither\r\nwill anyone else.\"[17-102] The senator was true to his word. News of\r\nthe Army's integration program passed quietly through the halls of\r\nCongress without public or private protest.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-102: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nMuch opposition to integration was based on the fear that low-scoring\r\nblack soldiers, handicapped by deficiencies in schooling and training,\r\nwould weaken integrated units as they had the all-black units. But\r\nintegration proved to be the best solution. As one combat commander\r\nput it, \"Mix 'um up and you get a strong line all the way; segregate\r\n'um and you have a point of weakness in your line. The enemy hits you\r\nthere, and it's bug out.\"[17-103] Korea taught the Army that an\r\nintegrated unit was not as weak as its weakest men, but as strong as\r\nits leadership and training. Integration not only diluted the impact\r\nof the less qualified by distributing them more widely, but also\r\nbrought about measurable improvement in the performance and standards\r\nof a large number of black soldiers.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-103: Quoted in John B. Spore and Robert\r\n                   F. Cocklin, \"Our Negro Soldiers,\" _Reporter_ 6\r\n                   (January 22, 1952):6-9.]\r\n\r\nClosely related to the concern over the large number of ill-qualified\r\nsoldiers was the fear of the impact of integration on a quota-free\r\nArmy. The Project CLEAR team concluded that a maximum of 15 to 20\r\npercent black strength \"seems to be an effective interim working\r\nlevel.\"[17-104] General McAuliffe pointed out in November 1952 that he\r\nwas trying to maintain a balanced distribution of black troops, not\r\nonly geographically but also according to combat and service\r\nspecialties (_see Tables 9 and 10_). Collins decided to retain the\r\nceiling on black combat troops--no more than 12 percent in any combat\r\nunit--but he agreed that a substantially higher percentage was\r\nacceptable in all other units.[17-105]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-104: Ltr, Dir, ORO, to ACofS, G-3, 20 Nov\r\n                   52, G-3 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-105: Memo for Rcd, G-1, 6 Nov 52, ref:\r\n                   ACofS, G-1, Memo for CofS, sub: Distribution of\r\n                   Negro Personnel, 14 Oct 52, G-1 291.2.]\r\n\r\nTable 9--Worldwide Distribution of Enlisted Personnel by Race,\r\nOctober 1952\r\n\r\n  (In Thousands)\r\n\r\n                European  Far East  Other Overseas  Continental\r\n    Category     Command   Command    Commands        United      Total\r\n                                                      States\r\n\r\n  White           212.1      293.1       96.0          649.2     1,250.5\r\n  Black            35.6       41.5        5.8[a]       110.6       193.4\r\n      Total       247.7      334.6      101.8          759.8     1,445.9\r\n  Percent black    14.4       12.4        5.7           14.6        13.4\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote a: Restrictions remained in effect on\r\n                   the assignment of Negroes to certain stations in\r\n                   USARPAC, TRUST, and USARCARIB.]\r\n\r\n_Source_: Memo, Chief, Per and Dist Br, G-1, for ACofS, G-1, 8 Oct 52,\r\nsub: Distribution of Negro Enlisted Personnel, G-1, 291.2.\r\n\r\nTable 10--Distribution of Black Enlisted Personnel by Branch and Rank,\r\n31 October 1952\r\n\r\n                                   AUS                   Regular\r\n  Branch                      Total    Percent[b]    Total    Percent[b]\r\n\r\n  Armor                       7,738      13.7        3,565       13.8\r\n  Artillery                  33,684      16.9       14,854       19.9\r\n  Infantry                   37,220      14.1       15,713       14.9\r\n  Adjutant General's Corps    1,074       8.8          663       10.8\r\n  Chemical Corps              1,504      15.5          633       20.1\r\n  Corps of Engineers         18,987      16.4        8,315       17.9\r\n  Military Police Corps       3,012       8.1        1,751        9.8\r\n  Finance Corps                  68       2.4           51        5.3\r\n  Army Medical Service        9,896      12.2        4,439       12.9\r\n  Ordnance Corps              5,683      10.2        2,598       12.0\r\n  Quartermaster Corps         9,690      20.8        4,187       20.6\r\n  Signal Corps                6,923       8.2        3,192        8.7\r\n  Transportation Corps       16,380      31.2        8,765       38.2\r\n  Women's Army Corps          1,310      13.1        1,283       13.3\r\n  No Branch assignment[a]    42,643      11.4       17,779       11.7\r\n  Total                     195,812[c]              87,788\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote a: In training.]\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote b: Figures show black percentage of\r\n                   total Army enlistments.]\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote c: Discrepancy with Table 9, which is\r\n                   based on September figures.]\r\n\r\n_Source_: STM-30, 31 Oct 52.\r\n\r\nThese percentages were part of a larger concern over the number of\r\nNegroes in the Army as a whole. Based on the evidence of draft-swollen\r\nenlistment statistics, it seemed likely that the 15 to 20 percent\r\nfigure would be reached or surpassed in 1953 or 1954, and there was\r\nsome discussion in the staff about restoring the quota. But such talk\r\nquickly faded as the Korean War wound down and the percentage\r\ndeclined. Negroes constituted 14.4 percent of enlisted strength in\r\nDecember 1952 and leveled off by the summer of 1955 at 11.9 percent.\r\nStatistics for the European Command illustrated the trend. In June\r\n1955, Negroes accounted for 3.6 percent of the command's officer\r\nstrength and 11.4 percent of its enlisted strength. The enlisted\r\nfigure represents a drop from a high of 16.1 percent in June 1953.\r\nThe percentage of black troops was down to 11.2 percent of the     (p. 458)\r\ncommand's total strength--officers, warrant officers, and enlisted\r\nmen--by June 1956. The reduction is explained in part by a policy\r\nadopted by all commands in February 1955 of refusing, with certain\r\nexceptions, to reenlist three-year veterans who scored less than\r\nninety in the classification tests. In Europe alone some 5,300\r\nenlisted men were not permitted to reenlist in 1955. Slightly more\r\nthan 25 percent were black.[17-106]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 17-106: Hq USAREUR, \"Annual Historical\r\n                   Report, 1 July 1954-30 June 1955,\" pp. 76-80, 92;\r\n                   ibid., 1 July 1955-30 June 1956, pp. 65-67.]\r\n\r\nThe racial quota, in the guise of an \"acceptable\" percentage of\r\nNegroes in individual units, continued to operate long after the Army\r\nagreed to abandon it. No one, black or white, appears to have voiced\r\nin the early 1950's the logical observation that the establishment of\r\na racial quota in individual Army units--whatever the percentage and\r\nthe grounds for that percentage--was in itself a residual form of\r\ndiscrimination. Nor did anyone ask how establishing a race quota,\r\nclearly distinct from restricting men according to mental, moral, or\r\nprofessional standards, could achieve the \"effective working       (p. 459)\r\nlevel\" posited by the Army's scientific advisers.\r\n\r\nThese questions would still be pertinent years later because the\r\nalternative to the racial quota--the enlistment and assignment of men\r\nwithout regard for color--would continue to be unacceptable to many.\r\nThey would argue that to abandon the quota, as the services did in the\r\n1960's, was to violate the concept of racial balance, which is yet\r\nanother hallmark of an egalitarian society. For example, during the\r\nVietnam War some black Americans complained that too many Negroes were\r\nserving in the more dangerous combat arms. Since men were assigned\r\nwithout regard to race, these critics were in effect asking for the\r\nquota again, reminding the service that the population of the United\r\nStates was only some 11 percent black. And during discussions of the\r\nall-volunteer Army a decade later, critics would be asking how the\r\nwhite majority would react to an army 30 or even 50 percent black.\r\n\r\nThese considerations were clearly beyond the ken of the men who\r\nintegrated the Army in the early 1950's. They concentrated instead on\r\nthe perplexities of enlisting and assigning vast numbers of segregated\r\nblack soldiers during wartime and closely watched the combat\r\nperformance of black units in Korea. Integration provided the Army\r\nwith a way to fill its depleted combat units quickly. The shortage of\r\nwhite troops forced local commanders to turn to the growing surplus of\r\nblack soldiers awaiting assignment to a limited number of black units.\r\nManpower restrictions did not permit the formation of new black units\r\nmerely to accommodate the excess, and in any case experience with the\r\n24th Infantry had strengthened the Army staff's conviction that black\r\ncombat units did not perform well. However commanders may have felt\r\nabout the social implications of integration, and whatever they\r\nthought of the fighting ability of black units, the only choice left\r\nto them was integration. When the Chief of Staff ordered the\r\nintegration of the Far East Command in 1951, what had begun as a\r\nbattlefield expedient became official policy.\r\n\r\nSegregation became unworkable when the Army lost its power to limit\r\nthe number of black soldiers. Abandonment of the quota on enlistments,\r\npressed on the Army by the Fahy Committee, proved compatible with\r\nsegregated units only so long as the need for fighting men was not\r\nacute. In Korea the need became acute. Ironically, the Gillem Board,\r\nwhose work became anathema to the integrationists, accurately\r\npredicted the demise of segregation in its final report, which\r\ndeclared that in the event of another major war the Army would use its\r\nmanpower \"without regard to antecedents or race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18                                                         (p. 460)\r\n\r\nIntegration of the Marine Corps\r\n\r\n\r\nEven more so than in the Army, the history of racial equality in the\r\nMarine Corps demonstrates the effect of the exigencies of war on the\r\nintegration of the armed forces. The Truman order, the Fahy Committee,\r\neven the demands of civil rights leaders and the mandates of the draft\r\nlaw, all exerted pressure for reform and assured the presence of some\r\nblack marines. But the Marine Corps was for years able to stave off\r\nthe logical outcome of such pressures, and in the end it was the\r\nmanpower demands of the Korean War that finally brought integration.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Korean War caused a sudden and dramatic rise in\r\nthe number of black marines: from 1,525 men, almost half of them\r\nstewards, in May 1949, to some 17,000 men, only 500 of them serving in\r\nseparate stewards duty, in October 1953.[18-1] Whereas the careful\r\ndesignation of a few segregated service units sufficed to handle the\r\ntoken black representation in 1949, no such organization was possible\r\nin 1952, when thousands of black marines on active duty constituted\r\nmore than 5 percent of the total enlistment. The decision to integrate\r\nthe new black marines throughout the corps was the natural outcome of\r\nthe service's early experiences in Korea. Ordered to field a full\r\ndivision, the corps out of necessity turned to the existing black\r\nservice units, among others, for men to augment the peacetime strength\r\nof its combat units. These men were assigned to any unit in the Far\r\nEast that needed them. As the need for more units and replacements\r\ngrew during the war, newly enlisted black marines were more and more\r\noften pressed into integrated service both in the Far East and at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-1: All statistics from official Marine\r\n                   Corps sources, Hist Div, HQMC.]\r\n\r\nMost significantly, the war provided a rising generation of Marine\r\nCorps officers with a first combat experience with black marines. The\r\ncompetence of these Negroes and the general absence of racial tension\r\nduring their integration destroyed long accepted beliefs to the\r\ncontrary and opened the way for general integration. Although the\r\ncorps continued to place special restrictions on the employment of\r\nNegroes and was still wrestling with the problem of black stewards\r\nwell into the next decade, its basic policy of segregating marines by\r\nrace ended with the cancellation of the last all-black unit\r\ndesignation in 1951. Hastily embraced by the corps as a solution to a\r\npressing manpower problem, integration was finally accepted as a\r\npermanent manpower policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Impetus for Change_                                               (p. 461)\r\n\r\nThis transformation seemed remote in 1949 in view of Commandant\r\nClifton B. Cates's strong defense of segregation. At that time Cates\r\nmade a careful distinction between allocating men to the services\r\nwithout regard to race, which he supported, and ordering integration\r\nof the services themselves. \"Changing national policy in this respect\r\nthrough the Armed Forces,\" he declared, \"is a dangerous path to pursue\r\ninasmuch as it effects [_sic_] the ability of the National Military\r\nEstablishment to fulfill its mission.\"[18-2] Integration of the\r\nservices had to follow, not precede, integration of American society.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-2: Memo, CMC for Asst SecNav for Air, 17\r\n                   Mar 49, MC files.]\r\n\r\nThe commandant's views were spelled out in a series of decisions\r\nannounced by the corps in the wake of the Secretary of the Navy's call\r\nfor integration of all elements of the Navy Department in 1949. On 18\r\nNovember 1949 the corps' Acting Chief of Staff announced a new racial\r\npolicy: individual black marines would be assigned in accordance with\r\ntheir specialties to vacancies \"in any unit where their services can\r\nbe effectively utilized,\" but segregated black units would be retained\r\nand new ones created when appropriate in the regular and reserve\r\ncomponents of the corps. In the case of the reserve component, the\r\ndecision on the acceptance of an applicant was vested in the unit\r\ncommander.[18-3] On the same day the commandant made it clear that the\r\npolicy was not to be interpreted too broadly. Priority for the\r\nassignment of individual black marines, Cates informed the commander\r\nof the Pacific Department, would be given to the support establishment\r\nand black officers would be assigned to black units only.[18-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-3: MC Memo 119-14, 18 Nov 49, sub: Policy\r\n                   Regarding Negro Marines, Hist Div, HQMC, files.\r\n                   Unless otherwise noted, all documents in this\r\n                   section are located in these files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-4: Msg, CMC (signed C.

A. Pollock\r\n                   for Asst CMC, 8 Nov 49.]\r\n\r\nFurther limiting the chances that black marines would be integrated,\r\nCates approved the creation of four new black units. The Director of\r\nPersonnel and the Marine Quartermaster had opposed this move on the\r\ngrounds that the new units would require technical billets,\r\nparticularly in the supply specialties, which would be nearly\r\nimpossible to fill with available enlisted black marines. Either\r\nschool standards would have to be lowered or white marines would have\r\nto be assigned to the units. Cates met this objection by agreeing with\r\nthe Director of Plans and Policies that no prohibition existed against\r\nracial mixing in a unit during a period of on-the-job training. The\r\nDirector of Personnel would decide when a unit was sufficiently\r\ntrained and properly manned to be officially designated a black\r\norganization.[18-5] In keeping with this arrangement, for example, the\r\ncommanding general of the 2d Marine Division reported in February 1950\r\nthat his black marines were sufficiently trained to assume complete\r\noperation of the depot platoon within the division's service command.\r\nCates then designated the platoon as a unit suitable for general   (p. 462)\r\nduty black marines, which prompted the Coordinator of Enlisted\r\nPersonnel to point out that current regulations stipulated \"after a\r\nunit has been so designated, all white enlisted personnel will be\r\nwithdrawn and reassigned.\"[18-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-5: DP&P Study 119-49, 14 Nov 49, sub:\r\n                   Designation of Units for Assignment of Negro\r\n                   Marines, approved by CMC, 2 Dec 49.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-6: Memo, CG, 2d Marine Div, for CMC, 18\r\n                   Feb 50, sub: Assignment of Negro Enlisted\r\n                   Personnel; Memo, CMC to CG, 2d Marine Div, 28 Mar\r\n                   50, sub: Designation of the Depot Platoon, Support\r\n                   Company, Second Combat Service Group, Service\r\n                   Command, for Assignment of Negro Enlisted Marines;\r\n                   MC Routing Sheet, Enlisted Coordinator, Personnel\r\n                   Department, 27 Mar 50, same sub.]\r\n\r\nNor were there any plans for the general integration of black\r\nreservists, although some Negroes were serving in formerly all-white\r\nunits.

Smith,\r\nput it on 4 January 1950, black units would be formed \"in any area\r\nwhere there is an expressed interest\" provided that the black\r\npopulation was large enough to support it.[18-7] When the NAACP\r\nobjected to the creation of another all-black reserve unit in New York\r\nCity as being contrary to Defense Department policy, the Marine Corps\r\njustified it on the grounds that the choice of integrated or\r\nsegregated units must be made by the local community \"in accord with\r\nits cultural values.\"[18-8] Notwithstanding the Secretary of the\r\nNavy's integration order and assignment policies directed toward\r\neffective utilization, it appeared that the Marine Corps in early 1950\r\nwas determined to retain its system of racially segregated units\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-7: Ltr, Smith to Franklin S.

Two factors connected with that\r\nconflict caused an abrupt change in Marine race policy. The first was\r\nthe great influx of Negroes into the corps. Although the commandant\r\ninsisted that race was not considered in recruitment, and in fact\r\nrecruitment instructions since 1948 contained no reference to the race\r\nof applicants, few Negroes had joined the Marine Corps in the two\r\nyears preceding the war.[18-9] In its defense the corps pointed to its\r\nexceedingly small enlistment quotas during those years and its high\r\nenlistment standards, which together allowed recruiters to accept only\r\na few men. The classification test average for all recruits enlisted\r\nin 1949 was 108, while the average for black enlistees during the same\r\nperiod was 94.7. New black recruits were almost exclusively enlisted\r\nfor stewards duty.[18-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-9: Ltr, CMC to Walter White, 2 Jul 51.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-10: Memo, Div of Plans and Policies for\r\n                   Asst Dir of Public Info, 4 Jun 51, sub: Article in\r\n                   Pittsburgh _Courier_ of 26 May 51.]\r\n\r\nA revision of Defense Department manpower policy combined with the\r\ndemands of the war to change all that. The imposition of a qualitative\r\ndistribution of manpower by the Secretary of Defense in April 1950\r\nmeant that among the thousands of recruits enlisted during the Korean\r\nWar the Marine Corps would have to accept its share of the large\r\npercentage of men in lower classification test categories. Among these\r\nmen were a significant number of black enlistees who had failed to\r\nqualify under previous standards. They were joined by thousands    (p. 463)\r\nmore who were supplied through the nondiscriminatory process of the\r\nSelective Service System when, during the war, the corps began using\r\nthe draft. The result was a 100 percent jump in the number of black\r\nmarines in the first year of war, a figure that would be multiplied\r\nalmost six times before war inductions ran down in 1953.

When General\r\nMacArthur called for the deployment of a Marine regimental combat team\r\nand supporting air group on 2 July 1950, the Secretary of the Navy\r\nresponded by sending the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, which\r\nincluded the 5th Marine Regiment, the 1st Battalion of the 11th\r\nMarines (Artillery), and Marine Air Group 33. By 13 September the 1st\r\nMarine Division and the 1st Marine Air Wing at wartime strength had\r\nbeen added. Fielding these forces placed an enormous strain on the\r\ncorps' manpower, and one result was the assignment of a number of\r\nblack service units, often combined with white units in composite\r\norganizations, to the combat units.\r\n\r\nThe pressures of battle quickly altered this neat arrangement.\r\nTheoretically, every marine was trained as an infantryman, and when\r\nshortages occurred in combat units commanders began assigning black\r\nreplacements where needed. For example, as the demand for more marines\r\nfor the battlefield grew, the Marine staff began to pull black marines\r\nfrom routine duties at the Marine Barracks in New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, and Hawaii and send them to Korea to bring the fighting\r\nunits up to full strength. The first time black servicemen were\r\nintegrated as individuals in significant numbers under combat\r\nconditions was in the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade during the\r\nfighting in the Pusan Perimeter in August 1950. The assignment of\r\nlarge numbers of black marines throughout the combat units of the 1st\r\nMarine Division, beginning in September, provided the clearest\r\ninstance of a service abandoning a social policy in response to the\r\ndemands of the battlefield. The 7th Marines, for example, an organic\r\nelement of the 1st Marine Division since August 1950, received into\r\nits rapidly expanding ranks, along with many recalled white reservists\r\nand men from small, miscellaneous Marine units, a 54-man black     (p. 464)\r\nservice unit. The regimental commander immediately broke up the\r\nblack unit, assigning the men individually throughout his combat\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nThat the emergency continued to influence the placement of Negroes is\r\napparent from the distribution of black marines in March 1951, when\r\nalmost half were assigned to combat duty in integrated units.[18-11]\r\nBefore the war was over, the 1st Marine Division had several thousand\r\nblack marines, serving in its ranks in Korea, where they were assigned\r\nto infantry and signal units as well as to transportation and food\r\nsupply organizations. One of the few black reserve officers on active\r\nduty found himself serving as an infantry platoon commander in Company\r\nB of the division's 7th Marines.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-11: _Location of Black Marines, 31 March\r\n                   1951_\r\n\r\n                     Posts and stations inside the United States     938\r\n                     Posts and stations outside the United States    181\r\n                     Troop training units                              3\r\n                     Aviation                                        190\r\n                     Fleet Marine Force (Ground)                   1,327\r\n                     Ships                                             3\r\n                     En route                                         58\r\n                     Missing in action                                 8\r\n\r\n                     Total                                         2,708\r\n\r\n                   _Source_: Tab 1 to Memo, ACofS, G-1, to Asst Dir of\r\n                   Public Info, 6 Jun 51, sub: Queries Concerning\r\n                   Negro Marines.]\r\n\r\nThe shift to integration in Korea proved uneventful. In the words of\r\nthe 7th Marines commander: \"Never once did any color problem bother\r\nus.... It just wasn't any problem. We had one Negro sergeant in\r\ncommand of an all-white squad and there was another--with a graves\r\nregistration unit--who was one of the finest Marines I've ever\r\nseen.\"[18-12] Serving for the first time in integrated units, Negroes\r\nproceeded to perform in a way that not only won many individuals\r\ndecorations for valor but also won the respect of commanders for\r\nNegroes as fighting men. Reminiscing about the performance of black\r\nmarines in his division, Lt. Gen. Oliver P. Smith remembered \"they did\r\neverything, and they did a good job because they were integrated, and\r\nthey were with good people.\"[18-13] In making his point the division\r\ncommander contrasted the performance of his integrated men with the\r\nArmy's segregated 24th Infantry. The observations of field commanders,\r\nparticularly the growing opinion that a connection existed between\r\ngood performance and integration, were bound to affect the\r\ndeliberations of the Division of Plans and Policies when it began to\r\nrestudy the question of black assignments in the fall of 1951.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-12: Washington _Post_, February 27,\r\n                   1951.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-13: USMC Oral History Interview, Lt Gen\r\n                   Oliver P. Smith, Jun 69.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the division's study, the Commandant of the Marine\r\nCorps announced a general policy of racial integration on 13 December\r\n1951, thus abolishing the system first introduced in 1942 of\r\ndesignating certain units in the regular forces and organized reserves\r\nas black units.[18-14] He spelled out the new order in some detail (p. 465)\r\non 18 December, and although his comments were addressed to the\r\ncommanders in the Fleet Marine Force, they were also forwarded to\r\nvarious commands in the support establishment that still retained\r\nall-black units. The order indicated that the practices now so\r\ncommonplace in Korea were about to become the rule in the United\r\nStates.[18-15] Some six months later the commandant informed the Chief\r\nof Naval Personnel that the Marine Corps had no segregated units and\r\nwhile integration had been gradual \"it was believed to be an\r\naccomplished fact at this time.\"[18-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-14: MC Policy Memo 109-51, 13 Dec 51,\r\n                   sub: Policy Regarding Negro Marines.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-15: Memo, CMC for CG, FMF, Pacific, et\r\n                   al., 18 Dec 51, sub: Assignment of Negro Enlisted\r\n                   Personnel.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-16: Idem for Chief, NavPers (ca.

Reporting on a Mediterranean tour of the 3d Battalion, 6th\r\nMarines (Reinforced), from 17 April to 20 October 1952, Capt. Thomas\r\nL. Faix, a member of the unit, noted: \"We have about fifteen Negro\r\nmarines in our unit now, out of fifty men. We have but very little\r\ntrouble and they sleep, eat and go on liberty together. It would be\r\nhard for many to believe but the thought is that here in the service\r\nall are facing a common call or summons to service regardless of\r\ncolor.\"[18-17] Finally, in August 1953, Lt. Gen. Gerald C. Thomas, (p. 466)\r\nwho framed the postwar segregation policy, announced that \"integration\r\nof Negroes in the Corps is here to stay. Colored boys are in almost\r\nevery military occupation specialty and certainly in every enlisted\r\nrank. I believe integration is satisfactory to them, and it is\r\nsatisfactory to us.\"[18-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-17: Extract from Thomas L.

The commandant had retained the option\r\nto employ black marines \"where their services can be effectively\r\nutilized,\" and in the years after the Korean War it became apparent\r\nthat the corps recognized definite limits to the kinds of duty to\r\nwhich black marines could be assigned. Following standard assignment\r\nprocedures, the Department of Personnel's Detail Branch selected\r\nindividual staff noncommissioned officers for specific duty billets.\r\nAfter screening the records of a marine and considering his race, the\r\nbranch could reject the assignment of a Negro to a billet for any  (p. 467)\r\n reason \"of overriding interest to the Marine Corps.\"[18-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-19: Memo, Head of Detail Br, Pers Dept,\r\n                   for Dir of Pers, 10 Jun 52, sub: Policy Regarding\r\n                   Negro Marines, MC files. This method of assigning\r\n                   staff noncommissioned officers still prevailed in\r\n                   1976.]\r\n\r\nBy the same token, the assignment of marines in the lower ranks was\r\nleft to the individual commands, which filled quotas established by\r\nheadquarters. Commanders usually filled the quotas from among eligible\r\nmen longest on station, but whether or not Negroes were included in a\r\ntransfer quota was left entirely to the discretion of the local\r\ncommander. The Department of Personnel reserved the right, however, to\r\nmake one racial distinction in regard to bulk quotas: it regulated the\r\nnumber of black marines it took from recruit depots as replacements,\r\nas insurance against a \"disproportionate\" number of Negroes in combat\r\nunits. Under the screening procedures of Marine headquarters and unit\r\ncommanders, black enlisted men were excluded from assignment to\r\nreserve officer training units, recruiting stations, the State\r\nDepartment for duty at embassies and legations, and certain special\r\nduties of the Department of Defense and the Navy Department.[18-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-20: Ibid., 4 Aug 52.]\r\n\r\nFor the service to reserve the right to restrict the assignment of\r\nNegroes when it was of \"overriding interest to the Marine Corps\" was\r\nperhaps understandable, but it was also susceptible to considerable\r\nmisinterpretation if not outright abuse. The Personnel Department was\r\n\"constantly\" receiving requests from commanders that no black noncoms\r\nbe assigned to their units. While some of these requests seemed\r\nreasonable, the chief of the division's Detail Branch noted, others\r\nwere not. Commanders of naval prison retraining centers did not want\r\nblack noncommissioned officers assigned because, they claimed, Negroes\r\ncaused unrest among the prisoners. The Marine Barracks in Washington,\r\nD.C., where the commandant lived, did not want black marines because\r\nof the ceremonial nature of its mission. The Marine Barracks at\r\nDahlgren, Virginia, did not want Negroes because conflicts might arise\r\nwith civilian employees in cafeterias and movies. Other commanders\r\nquestioned the desirability of assigning black marines to the Naval\r\nAcademy, to inspector-instructor billets in the clerical and supply\r\nfields, and to billets for staff chauffeurs. The Detail Branch wanted\r\na specific directive that listed commands to which black marines\r\nshould not be assigned.[18-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-21: Ibid., 10 Jun 52.]\r\n\r\nRestrictions on the assignment of black marines were never codified,\r\nbut the justification for them changed. In place of the \"overriding\r\ninterest to the Marine Corps\" clause, the corps began to speak of\r\nrestrictions \"solely for the welfare of the individual Marine.\" In\r\n1955 the Director of Personnel, Maj. Gen. Robert O. Bare, pointed to\r\nthe unusually severe hardships imposed on Negroes in some communities\r\nwhere the attitude toward black marines sometimes interfered with\r\ntheir performance of duty. Since civilian pressures could not be\r\nrecognized officially, Bare reasoned, they had to be dealt with\r\ninformally on a person-to-person basis.[18-22] By this statement   (p. 468)\r\nhe meant the Marine Corps would informally exclude Negroes from\r\ncertain assignments. Of course no one explained how barring Negroes\r\nfrom assignment to recruitment, inspector-instructor, embassy, or even\r\nchauffeur duty worked for \"the welfare of the individual Marine.\" Such\r\nan explanation was just what Congressman Powell was demanding in\r\nJanuary 1958 when he asked why black marines were excluded from\r\nassignments to the American Embassy in Paris.[18-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-22: Ltr, Maj Gen R.

Anxiety over\r\nassignments anywhere in the United States was unfounded, they claimed,\r\nand offered in support statistics demonstrating the existence of a\r\nsubstantial black community in all the duty areas from which Negroes\r\nwere unofficially excluded. The Assignment and Classification Branch\r\nalso pointed out that the corps had experienced no problems\r\nin the case of the thirteen black marines then assigned to\r\ninspector-instructor duty, including one in Mobile, Alabama. The\r\nbranch went on to discuss the possibility of assigning black marines\r\nto recruiting duty. Since recruiters were assigned to areas where they\r\nunderstood local attitudes and customs, some officials reasoned,\r\nNegroes should be used to promote the corps among potential black\r\nenlistees whose feelings and attitudes were not likely to be\r\nunderstood by white recruiters.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-24: See Ltrs, A.

But the picture\r\nquickly changed in the next year, and by June 1962 all restrictions on\r\nthe assignment of black marines had been dropped with the exception of\r\nseveral installations in the United States where off-base housing was\r\nunavailable and some posts overseas where the use of black marines was\r\nlimited because of the attitudes of foreign governments.[18-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-25: Draft Memo, Head of Assignment and\r\n                   Classification Br for Dir, Pers (ca. 1961), sub:\r\n                   Restricted Assignments; Memo, IG for Dir, Pers, 31\r\n                   Aug 62; Ltr, Lt Col A.

Stewards served a necessary though unglamorous function\r\nin the Marine Corps, and education standards for such duty were    (p. 469)\r\nconsiderably lower than those for the rest of the service. Everyone\r\nunderstood this, and beyond the stigma many young people felt was\r\nattached to such duties, many Negroes particularly resented the fact\r\nthat while the branch was officially open to all, somehow none of the\r\nless gifted whites ever joined. Stewards were acquired either by\r\nrecruiting new marines with stewards-duty-only contracts or by\r\naccepting volunteers from the general service. The evidence suggests\r\nthat there was truth in the commonly held assumption among stewards\r\nthat when a need for more stewards arose, \"volunteers\" were secured by\r\ntampering with the classification test scores of men in the general\r\nservice.[18-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-26: Shaw and Donnelly, _Blacks in the\r\n                   Marine Corps_, pp. 64-65.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAINING EXERCISES _on Iwo Jima, March 1954_.]\r\n\r\nThe commandant seemed less concerned with methods than results when\r\nstewards were needed. In June 1950 he had reaffirmed the policy of\r\nallowing stewards to reenlist for general duty, but when he learned\r\nthat some stewards had made the jump to general duty without being\r\nqualified, he announced that men who had signed contracts for stewards\r\nduty only were not acceptable for general duty unless they scored at\r\nleast in the 31st percentile of the qualifying tests. To make the\r\nchange to general duty even less attractive, he ruled that if a\r\nsteward reenlisted for general duty he would have to revert to the\r\nrank of private, first class.[18-27] Such measures did nothing to\r\nimprove the morale of black stewards, many of whom, according to civil\r\nrights critics, felt confined forever to performing menial tasks, nor\r\ndid it prevent constant shortages in the Steward's Branch and problems\r\narising from the lack of men with training in modern mess management.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-27: Speed Ltr, CMC to Distribution List,\r\n                   22 Jun 50; Routing Sheet, Pers Dept, 21 Jun 50,\r\n                   sub: Enlistment of Stewards.]\r\n\r\nThe corps tried to attack these problems in the mid-1950's. At the\r\nbehest of the Secretary of the Navy it eliminated the stewards-duty-only\r\ncontract in 1954; henceforth all marines were enlisted for general\r\nduty, and only after recruit training could volunteers sign up for\r\nstewards duty. Acceptance of men scoring below ninety in the\r\nclassification tests would be limited to 40 percent of those\r\nvolunteering each month for stewards duty.[18-28] The corps also\r\ninstituted special training in modern mess management for stewards. In\r\n1953 the Quartermaster General had created an inspection and\r\ndemonstration team composed of senior stewards to instruct members (p. 470)\r\nof the branch in the latest techniques of cooking and baking,\r\nsupervision, and management.[18-29] In August 1954 the commandant\r\nestablished an advanced twelve-week course for stewards based on the\r\nNavy's successful system.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-28: Ltrs, CMC to Distribution List, 16\r\n                   Apr 55 and 18 Nov 55.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-29: Memo, Head, Enlisted Monitoring Unit,\r\n                   Detail Br, for Lt Col Gordon T.

In 1959, for example, the branch was\r\nstill 8 percent short of its 826-man goal.[18-30] The obvious\r\nsolution, to use white volunteers for messman duty, would be a radical\r\ndeparture from tradition. True, before World War II white marines had\r\nbeen used in the Marine Corps for duties now performed by black\r\nstewards, but they had never been members of a branch organized\r\nexclusively for that purpose. In 1956 tradition was broken when white\r\nvolunteers were quietly signed up for the branch. By March 1961 the\r\nbranch had eighty white men, 10 percent of its total. Reviewing the\r\nsituation later that year, the commandant decided to increase the\r\nnumber of white stewards by setting a racial quota on steward\r\nassignment. Henceforth, he ordered, half the volunteers accepted   (p. 471)\r\nfor stewards duty would be white.[18-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-30: Memo, J. J. Holicky, Detail Br, for\r\n                   Dir of Pers, USMC, 3 Aug 59, sub: Inspection of\r\n                   Occupational Field 36 (Stewards), Pers 1, MC\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-31: Memo, Asst Chief for Plans, BuPers\r\n                   (Rear Adm B.

In less than two months\r\nthe Steward's Branch was 20 percent white. In marked contrast to the\r\nclaims of Navy recruiters, the marines reported no difficulty in\r\nattracting white volunteers for messman duties. Curiously, the\r\nvolunteers came mostly from the southeastern states. As the racial\r\ncomposition of the Steward's Branch changed, the morale of its black\r\nmembers seemed to improve. As one senior black warrant officer later\r\nexplained, simply opening stewards duty to whites made such duty\r\nacceptable to many Negroes who had been prone to ask \"if it [stewards\r\nduty] was so good, why don't you have some of the whites in\r\nit.\"[18-32] When transfer to general service assignments became easy\r\nto obtain in the 1960's, the Marine Corps found that only a small\r\npercentage of the black stewards now wished to make the change.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-32: USMC Oral History Interview, CWO\r\n                   James E. Johnson, 27 Mar 73.]\r\n\r\nThere were still inequities in the status of black marines, especially\r\nthe near absence of black officers (two on active duty in 1950,\r\nnineteen in January 1955) and the relatively slow rate of promotion\r\namong black marines in general. The corps had always justified its\r\nfigures on the grounds that competition in so small a service was\r\nextremely fierce, and, as the commandant explained to Walter White in\r\n1951, a man had to be good to compete and outstanding to be promoted.\r\nHe cited the 1951 selection figures for officer training: out of 2,025\r\nhighly qualified men applying, only half were selected and only half\r\nof those were commissioned.[18-33] Promotion to senior billets for\r\nnoncommissioned officers was also highly competitive, with time in\r\nservice an important factor. It was unlikely in such circumstances\r\nthat many black marines would be commissioned from the ranks or a\r\nhigher percentage of black noncommissioned officers would be promoted\r\nto the most senior positions during the 1950's.[18-34] The Marine\r\nCorps had begun commissioning Negroes so recently that the development\r\nof a representative group of black officers in a system of open\r\ncompetition was of necessity a slow and arduous task. The task was\r\nfurther complicated because most of the nineteen black officers on (p. 472)\r\nactive duty in 1955 were reservists serving out tours begun in the\r\nKorean War. Only a few of them had made the successful switch from\r\nreserve to regular service. The first two were 2d Lt. Frank E.\r\nPetersen, Jr., the first black Marine pilot, and 2d Lt. Kenneth H.\r\nBerthoud, Jr., who first served as a tank officer in the 3d Marine\r\nDivision. Both men would advance to high rank in the corps, Petersen\r\nbecoming the first black marine general.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-33: Ltr, CMC to Walter White, 2 Jul 51,\r\n                   AO-1, MC files.

Here again promotion to higher rank was\r\nslow. The first black marine to make the climb to the top in the\r\nintegrated corps was Edgar R. Huff. A gunnery sergeant in an\r\nintegrated infantry battalion in Korea, Huff later became battalion\r\nsergeant major in the 8th Marines and eventually senior sergeant major\r\nof the Marine Corps.[18-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 18-35: Shaw and Donnelly, _Blacks in the\r\n                   Marine Corps_, pp. 62-63. 66.]\r\n\r\nBy 1962 there were 13,351 black enlisted men, 7.59 percent of the\r\ncorps' strength, and 34 black officers (7 captains, 25 lieutenants,\r\nand 2 warrant officers) serving in integrated units in all military\r\noccupations. These statistics illustrate the racial progress that\r\noccurred in the Marine Corps during the 1950's, a change that was both\r\norderly and permanent, and, despite the complicated forces at work, in\r\nessence a gift to the naval establishment from the Korean battlefield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19                                                         (p. 473)\r\n\r\nA New Era Begins\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 30 October 1954 the Secretary of Defense announced that the last\r\nracially segregated unit in the armed forces of the United States had\r\nbeen abolished.[19-1] Considering the department's very conservative\r\ndefinition of a segregated unit--one at least 50 percent black--the\r\nannouncement celebrated a momentous change in policy. In the little\r\nmore than six years since President Truman's order, all black\r\nservicemen, some quarter of a million in 1954, had been intermingled\r\nwith whites in the nation's military units throughout the world. For\r\nthe services the turbulent era of integration had begun.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-1: New York _Times_, October 31, 1954;\r\n                   ibid., Editorial, November 1, 1954.]\r\n\r\nThe new era's turbulence was caused in part by the decade-long debate\r\nthat immediately ensued over the scope of President Truman's guarantee\r\nof equal treatment and opportunity for servicemen. On one side were\r\nranged most service officials, who argued that integration, now a\r\nsource of pride to the services and satisfaction to the civil rights\r\nmovement, had ceased to be a public issue. Abolishing segregated\r\nunits, they claimed, fulfilled the essential elements of the executive\r\norder, leaving the armed forces only rare vestiges of discrimination\r\nto correct. Others, at first principally the civil rights bloc in\r\nCongress and civil rights organizations, but later black servicemen\r\nthemselves, contended that the Truman order committed the Department\r\nof Defense to far more than integration of military units. They\r\nbelieved that off-base discrimination, so much more apparent with the\r\nimprovement of on-base conditions, seriously affected morale and\r\nefficiency. They wanted the department to challenge local laws and\r\ncustoms when they discriminated against black servicemen.\r\n\r\nThis interpretation made little headway in the Department of Defense\r\nduring the first decade of integration. Both the Eisenhower and\r\nKennedy administrations made commitments to the principle of equal\r\ntreatment within the services, and both admitted the connection\r\nbetween military efficiency and discrimination, but both presumed, at\r\nleast until 1963, severe limitations on their power to change local\r\nlaws and customs. For their part, the services constantly referred to\r\nthe same limitations, arguing that their writ in regard to racial\r\nreform ran only to the gates of the military reservation.\r\n\r\nYet while there was no substantive change in the services' view of\r\ntheir racial responsibilities, the Department of Defense was able to\r\nmake significant racial reforms between 1954 and 1962. More than\r\nexpressing the will of the Chief Executive, these changes reflected\r\nthe fact that military society was influenced by some of the same\r\nforces that were operating on the larger American society. Possessed\r\nof a discipline that enabled it to reform rapidly, military society\r\nstill shared the prejudices as well as the reform impulses of the  (p. 474)\r\nbody politic. Racial changes in the services during the first decade\r\nof integration were primarily parochial responses to special internal\r\nneeds; nevertheless, they took place at a time when civil rights\r\ndemands were stirring the whole country. Their effectiveness must be\r\nmeasured against the expectations such demands were kindling in the\r\nblack community.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Civil Rights Revolution_\r\n\r\nThe post-World War II civil rights movement was unique in the nation's\r\nhistory. Contrasting this era of black awakening with the post-Civil\r\nWar campaign for black civil rights, historian C. Vann Woodward found\r\nthe twentieth century phenomenon \"more profound and impressive ...\r\ndeeper, surer, less contrived, more spontaneous.\"[19-2] Again in\r\ncontrast to the original, the so-called second reconstruction period\r\nfound black Americans uniting in a demand for social justice so long\r\nwithheld. In 1953, the year before the Supreme Court decision to\r\ndesegregate the schools, Clarence Mitchell of the NAACP gave voice to\r\nthe revolutionary rise in black expectations:\r\n\r\n     Twenty years ago the Negro was satisfied if he could have even a\r\n     half-decent school to go to (and took it for granted that it\r\n     would be a segregated school) or if he could go to the hotel in\r\n     town or the restaurant maybe once a year for some special\r\n     interracial dinner and meeting. Twenty years ago much of the\r\n     segregation pattern was taken for granted by the Negro. Now it is\r\n     different.[19-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-2: C. Vann Woodward, _Strange Career of\r\n                   Jim Crow_, p. 170. This account of the civil rights\r\n                   movement largely follows Woodward's famous study,\r\n                   but the following works have also been consulted:\r\n                   Benjamin Muse, _Ten Years of Prelude: The Story of\r\n                   Integration Since the Supreme Court's 1954\r\n                   Decision_ (New York: Viking Press, 1964); Constance\r\n                   M.

The rapid urbanization of many\r\nblack Americans, coupled with their experience in World War II,\r\nespecially in the armed forces and in defense industries, had enhanced\r\ntheir economic and political power and raised their educational\r\nopportunities. And what was true for the war generation was even truer\r\nfor its children. Possessed of a new self-respect, young Negroes began\r\nto demonstrate confidence in the future and a determination to reject\r\nthe humiliation of second-class citizenship. Out of this attitude grew\r\na widespread demand among the young for full equality, and when this\r\ndemand met with opposition, massive participation in civil rights\r\ndemonstrations became both practical and inevitable. Again historian\r\nWoodward's observations are pertinent:\r\n\r\n     More than a black revolt against whites, it was in part a\r\n     generational rebellion, an uprising of youth against the older\r\n     generation, against the parental \"uncle Toms\" and their\r\n     inhibitions. It even took the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE (Congress of\r\n     Racial Equality) by surprise. Negroes were in charge of their (p. 475)\r\n     own movement, and youth was in the vanguard.[19-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-4: Woodward, _Strange Career of Jim\r\n                   Crow_, p. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARENCE MITCHELL.]\r\n\r\nTo a remarkable extent, this youthful vanguard was strongly religious\r\nand nonviolent. The influence of the church on the militant phase of\r\nthe civil rights movement is one of the movement's salient\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nThis black awakening paralleled a growing realization among an\r\nincreasing number of white Americans that the demands of the civil\r\nrights leaders were just and that the government should act. World War\r\nII had made many thoughtful Americans aware of the contradiction\r\ninherent in fighting fascism with segregated troops. In the postwar\r\nyears, the cold war rivalry for the friendship and allegiance of the\r\nworld's colored peoples, who were creating a multitude of new states,\r\nadded a pragmatic reason for ensuring equal treatment and opportunity\r\nfor black Americans. A further inducement, and a particularly forceful\r\none, was the size of the northern black vote, which had become the key\r\nto victory in several electorally important states and had made the\r\ncivil rights cause a practical political necessity for both major\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court was the real pacesetter. Significantly\r\nbroadening its interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court\r\nreversed a century-old trend and called for federal intervention to\r\nprotect the civil rights of the black minority in transportation,\r\nhousing, voting, and the administration of justice. In the _Morgan_ v.\r\n_Virginia_ decision of 1946,[19-5] for example, the Court launched an\r\nattack on segregation in interstate travel. In another series of cases\r\nit proclaimed the right of Negroes to be tried only in those courts\r\nwhere Negroes could serve on juries and outlawed the all-white primary\r\nsystem, which in some one-party states had effectively barred Negroes\r\nfrom the elective process. The latter decision partly explains the\r\nrise in the number of qualified black voters in twelve southern states\r\nfrom 645,000 in 1947 to some 1.2 million by 1952. However, many\r\ndifficulties remained in the way of full enfranchisement. The poll\r\ntax, literacy tests, and outright intimidation frustrated the\r\nregistration of Negroes in many areas, and in some rural counties\r\nblack voter registration actually declined in the early 1960's. But\r\nthe Court's intervention was crucial because its decisions established\r\nthe precedent for federal action that would culminate in the Voting\r\nRights Act of 1965.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-5: 328 U.S. 373 (1946).]\r\n\r\nThese judicial initiatives whittled away at segregation's hold on  (p. 476)\r\nthe Constitution, but it was the Supreme Court's rulings in the field\r\nof public education that dealt segregation a mortal blow. Its\r\nunanimous decision in the case of _Oliver Brown et al._ v. _Board of\r\nEducation of Topeka, Kansas_, on 17 May 1954[19-6] not only undermined\r\nsegregation in the nation's schools, but by an irresistible extension\r\nof the logic employed in the case also committed the nation at its\r\nhighest levels to the principle of racial equality. The Court's\r\nconclusion that \"separate educational facilities are inherently\r\nunequal\" exposed segregation in all public areas to renewed judicial\r\nscrutiny. It was, as Professor Woodward described it, the most\r\nfar-reaching Court decision in a century, and it marked the beginning\r\nof the end of Jim Crow's reign in America.[19-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-6: 347 U.S. 483 (1954); see also 349 U.S.\r\n                   294 (1955).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-7: Woodward, _Strange Career of Jim\r\n                   Crow_, p. 147.]\r\n\r\nBut it was only the beginning, for the Court's order that the\r\ntransition to racially nondiscriminatory school systems be\r\naccomplished \"with all deliberate speed\"[19-8] encountered massive\r\nresistance in many places. Despite ceaseless litigation and further\r\naffirmations by the Court, and despite enforcement by federal troops\r\nin the celebrated cases of Little Rock, Arkansas, and Oxford,\r\nMississippi, and by federal marshals in New Orleans, Louisiana,[19-9]\r\nelimination of segregated public schools was painfully slow. As late\r\nas 1962, for example, only 7.6 percent of the more than three million\r\nNegroes of school age in the southern and border states attended\r\nintegrated schools.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-8: 349 U.S. 294 (1955).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-9: For an outline of the federal and\r\n                   National Guard intervention in these areas, see\r\n                   Robert W. Coakley, Paul J. Scheips, Vincent H.\r\n                   Demma, and M. Warner Stark, \"Use of Troops in Civil\r\n                   Disturbances Since World War II\" (1945 to 1965 with\r\n                   two supplements through 1967), Center of Military\r\n                   History Study 75.]\r\n\r\nThe executive branch also took up the cause of civil rights, albeit in\r\na more limited way than the courts. The Eisenhower administration, for\r\ninstance, continued President Truman's efforts to achieve equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity for black servicemen. Just before the\r\n_Brown_ decision the administration quickly desegregated most\r\ndependent schools on military bases. It also desegregated the school\r\nsystem of Washington, D.C., and, with a powerful push from the Supreme\r\nCourt in the case of the _District of Columbia_ v. _John R. Thompson\r\nCo._ in 1953,[19-10] abolished segregation in places of public\r\naccommodation in the nation's capital. Eisenhower also continued\r\nTruman's fight against discrimination in federal employment, including\r\njobs covered by government contracts, by establishing watchdog\r\ncommittees on government employment policy and government contracts.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-10: 346 U.S. 100 (1953).]\r\n\r\nIndependent federal agencies also began to attack racial\r\ndiscrimination. The Interstate Commerce Commission, with strong\r\nassistance from the courts, made a series of rulings that by 1961 had\r\noutlawed segregation in much interstate travel. The Federal Housing\r\nAuthority, following the Supreme Court's abrogation of the state's\r\npower to enforce restrictive covenants in the sale of housing, began\r\nin the early 1950's to push toward a federal open-occupancy policy in\r\npublic housing and all housing with federally guaranteed loans.    (p. 477)\r\nThe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, an investigatory agency appointed\r\nby the President under the Civil Rights Act of 1957, examined\r\ncomplaints of voting discrimination and denials of equal protection\r\nunder the law. Both Eisenhower and Kennedy dispatched federal\r\nofficials to investigate and prosecute violations of voting rights in\r\nseveral states.\r\n\r\nBut civil rights progress was still painfully slow in the 1950's. The\r\nfight for civil rights in that decade graphically demonstrated a\r\npolitical fact of life: any profound change in the nation's social\r\nsystem requires the concerted efforts of all three branches of the\r\nnational government. In this case the Supreme Court had done its part,\r\nrepeatedly attacking segregation in many spheres of national life. The\r\nexecutive branch, on the other hand, did not press the Court's\r\ndecisions as thoroughly as some had hoped, although Eisenhower\r\ncertainly did so forcibly and spectacularly with federal troops at\r\nLittle Rock in 1957. The dispatch of paratroopers to Little\r\nRock,[19-11] a memorable example of federal intervention and one\r\npopularly associated with civil rights, had, in fact, little to do\r\nwith civil rights, but was rather a vivid example of the exercise of\r\nexecutive powers in the face of a threat to federal judicial\r\nauthority. Where the _Brown_ decision was concerned, Eisenhower's view\r\nof judicial powers was narrow and his leadership antithetical to the\r\nCourt's call for \"all deliberate speed.\" He even withheld his support\r\nin school desegregation cases. Eisenhower was quite frank about the\r\nlimitations he perceived in his power and, by inference, his duty to\r\neffect civil rights reforms. Such reforms, he believed, were a matter\r\nof the heart and, as he explained to Congressman Powell in 1953, could\r\nnot be achieved by means of laws or directives or the action of any\r\none person, \"no matter with how much authority and forthrightness he\r\nacts.\"[19-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-11: For an authoritative account of\r\n                   Little Rock, see Robert W.

The 1957 and 1960 civil rights laws,\r\npallid harbingers of later powerful legislation in this field,\r\ndemonstrated Congress's lukewarm commitment to civil rights reform\r\nthat severely limited federal action. The reluctance of Congress to\r\nenact the reforms augured in the _Brown_ decision convinced many\r\nNegroes that they would have to take further measures to gain their\r\nfull constitutional rights. They had seen presidents and federal\r\njudges embrace principles long argued by civil rights organizations,\r\nbut to little avail. Seven years after the _Brown_ decision, Negroes\r\nwere still disfranchised in large areas of the south, still        (p. 478)\r\nendured segregated public transportation and places of public\r\naccommodation, and still encountered discrimination in employment and\r\nhousing throughout the nation. Nor had favorable court decisions and\r\nfederal attempts at enforcement reversed the ominous trend in black\r\nunemployment rates, which had been rising for a decade. Above all,\r\ncourt decisions could not spare Negroes the sense of humiliation that\r\nsegregation produced. Segregation implied racial inferiority, a\r\n\"constant corroding experience,\" as Clarence Mitchell once called it.\r\nIt was segregation's seeming imperviousness to governmental action in\r\nthe 1950's that caused the new generation of civil rights leaders to\r\ndevelop new civil rights techniques.\r\n\r\nTheir new methods forced the older leaders, temporarily at least, into\r\neclipse. No longer could they convince their juniors of the efficacy\r\nof legal action, and the 1950's ended with the younger generation\r\ntaking to the streets in the first spontaneous battles of their civil\r\nrights revolution. Under the direction of the Southern Christian\r\nLeadership Council and its charismatic founder, Martin Luther King,\r\nJr., the strategy of massive civil disobedience, broached in 1948 by\r\nA. Philip Randolph, became a reality. Other organizations quickly\r\njoined the battle, including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating\r\nCommittee (SNCC), also organized by Dr. King but soon destined to\r\nbreak away into more radical paths, and the Congress of Racial\r\nEquality (CORE), an older organization, now expanded and under its new\r\ndirector, James Farmer, rededicated to activism.\r\n\r\nRosa Parks's refusal to move to the rear of the Montgomery bus in 1955\r\nand the ensuing successful black boycott that ended the city's\r\nsegregated transportation pointed the way to a wave of nonviolent\r\ndirect action that swept the country in the 1960's. Thousands of young\r\nAmericans, most notably in the student-led sit-ins enveloping the\r\nsouth in 1960[19-13] and the scores of freedom riders bringing chaos\r\nto the transportation system in 1961, carried the civil rights\r\nstruggle into all corners of the south. \"We will wear you down by our\r\ncapacity to suffer,\" Dr. King warned the nation's majority, and suffer\r\nNegroes did in the brutal resistance that met their demands. But it\r\nwas not in vain, for police brutality, mob violence, and\r\nassassinations set off hundreds of demonstrations throughout the\r\ncountry and made civil rights a national political issue.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-13: For an account of the first major\r\n                   sit-in demonstrations, which occurred at\r\n                   Greensboro, North Carolina, and their influence on\r\n                   civil rights organizations, including the Student\r\n                   Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, see Miles Wolff,\r\n                   _Lunch at the Five and Ten; The Greensboro Sit-in_\r\n                   (New York: Stein and Day, 1970). See also Clark,\r\n                   \"The Civil Rights Movement,\" pp. 255-60.]\r\n\r\nThe stage was set for a climatic scene, and onto that stage walked the\r\nfamiliar figure of A. Philip Randolph, calling for a massive march on\r\nWashington to demand a redress of black grievances. This time, unlike\r\nthe response to his 1940 appeal, the answer was a promise of support\r\nfrom both races. The churches joined in, many labor leaders, including\r\nWalter Reuther, enlisted in the demonstration, and even the President,\r\nat first opposed, gave his blessing to the national event. A quarter\r\nof a million people, about 20 percent of them white, marched to\r\nLincoln Memorial on 28 August 1963 to hear King appeal to the      (p. 479)\r\nthe nation's conscience by reciting his dream of a just society. In\r\nthe words of the Kerner Commission:\r\n\r\n     It [the march] was more than a summation of the past years of\r\n     struggle and aspiration. It symbolized certain new directions: a\r\n     deeper concern for the economic problems of the masses, more\r\n     involvement of white moderates and new demands from the most\r\n     militant, who implied that only a revolutionary change in\r\n     American institutions would permit Negroes to achieve the dignity\r\n     of citizens.[19-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-14: _Report of the National Advisory\r\n                   Commission on Civil Disorders_, p. 109.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limitations on Executive Order 9981_\r\n\r\nThe decade of national civil rights activity that culminated\r\nsymbolically at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 was closely mirrored in\r\nthe Department of Defense, where the services' definition of equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity underwent a marked evolution. Here, a decade\r\nthat had begun with the department's placing severe limitations on its\r\ndefense of black servicemen's civil rights ended with the department's\r\njoining the vanguard of the civil rights movement.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1950's the services were constantly referring to the\r\nlimitations of Executive Order 9981. The Air Force could not intervene\r\nin local custom, Assistant Secretary Zuckert told Clarence Mitchell in\r\n1951. Social change in local communities must be evolutionary, he\r\ncontinued, either ignoring or contrasting the Air Force's own social\r\nexperience.[19-15] Defending the practice of maintaining large\r\ntraining camps in localities discriminating against black soldiers,\r\nthe Army Chief of Staff explained to Senator Homer Ferguson of\r\nMichigan that while its facilities were open to all soldiers\r\nregardless of race, the Army had no control over nearby civilian\r\ncommunities. There was little its commanders could do beyond urging\r\nlocal civic organizations to cooperate.[19-16] The Deputy Chief of\r\nNaval Personnel was even more blunt. \"The housing situation at Key\r\nWest is not within the control of the Navy,\" he told the Assistant\r\nSecretary of Defense in 1953. Housing was segregated, he admitted, but\r\nit was the Federal Housing Authority, not the Navy, that controlled\r\nthe location of off-base housing for black sailors.[19-17]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-15: Memo, Lt Col Leon Bell, Asst Exec,\r\n                   Off, Asst SecAF, for Col Barnes, Office, SecAF, 9\r\n                   Jan 51, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-16: Ltr, CofSA to Ferguson, 7 May 51; see\r\n                   also Ltr, Under SA Earl D.

As late as 1959, discussing a case of racial\r\ndiscrimination near an Army base in Germany, a Defense Department\r\nspokesman explained to Congressman James Roosevelt that \"since the\r\nincident did not take place on one of our military bases, we are not\r\nin a position to offer direct relief in the situation....\"[19-18] Even\r\nJames Evans, the racial counselor, came to use this explanation.\r\n\"Community mores with respect to race vary,\" Evans wrote in 1956, and\r\n\"such matters are largely beyond direct purview of the Department  (p. 480)\r\nof Defense.\"[19-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-18: Ltr, ASD (MP&R) Charles C. Finucane\r\n                   to James Roosevelt, 3 Jun 59, ASD (MP&R) files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-19: Evans and Lane, \"Integration in the\r\n                   Armed Services,\" p. 83.]\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, in view of the difficulties they perceived, the\r\nservices tried to avoid the whole problem. In 1954, for example, a\r\ngroup of forty-eight black soldiers traveling on a bus in Columbia,\r\nSouth Carolina, were arrested and fined when they protested the\r\nattempted arrest of one of them for failing to comply with the state's\r\nsegregated seating law. In the ensuing furor, Secretary of Defense\r\nCharles E. Wilson explained to President Eisenhower that soldiers were\r\nsubject to community law and his department contemplated no\r\ninvestigation or disciplinary action in the case. In view of the civil\r\nrights issues involved, Wilson continued,[19-20] the Judge Advocate\r\nGeneral of the Army discussed the matter with the Justice Department\r\nand referred related correspondence to that department \"for whatever\r\ndisposition it considered appropriate.\" \"This reply,\" an assistant\r\nnoted on Wilson's file copy of the memo for the President, \"gets them\r\noff our neck, but I don't know about Brownell's [the Attorney\r\nGeneral].\"[19-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-20: Wilson, former president of General\r\n                   Motors Corporation, became President Eisenhower's\r\n                   first Secretary of Defense on 28 January 1953.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-21: Memo, CofS, G-1, for ASA, 6 Jan 54,\r\n                   sub: Mass Jailing and Fining of Negro Soldiers in\r\n                   Columbia, S.C.; Memo, ASA for ASD (M&P), same date\r\n                   and sub; Memo, SecDef for President, 7 Jan 54.

Their attitude toward extending their standards of equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity to local communities implied a benign\r\nneutrality on their part in racial disputes involving servicemen. This\r\nattitude was belied by the fact that on numerous and sometimes\r\ncelebrated occasions the services helped reinforce local segregation\r\nlaws. In 1956, for example, Secretary of the Air Force Harold E.\r\nTalbott explained that military commanders were expected to foster\r\ngood relations with local authorities and in many areas were obliged\r\nto \"require\" servicemen to conform to the dictates of local law\r\n\"regardless of their own convictions or personal beliefs.\"[19-22]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-22: SecAF statement, 1 May 56, quoted in\r\n                   Address by James P. Goode, Employment Policy\r\n                   Officer for the Air Force, at a meeting called by\r\n                   the President's Committee on Government Employment\r\n                   Policy, 24 May 56, AF File 202-56, Fair Employment\r\n                   Program.]\r\n\r\nThis requirement could be rather brutal in practice and placed the\r\nservices, the nation's leading equal opportunity employer, in\r\nquestionable company. In 1953 a black pilot stationed at Craig Air\r\nForce Base, Alabama, refused to move to the rear of a public bus until\r\nthe military police ordered him to comply with the state law. The Air\r\nForce officially reprimanded and eventually discharged the pilot. The\r\nposition of the Air Force was made clear in the reprimand:\r\n\r\n     Your actions in this instance are prejudicial to good order and\r\n     military discipline and do not conform to the standards of\r\n     conduct expected of a commissioned officer of the United States\r\n     Air Force.

Your open violation of the segregation policy established\r\n     by this Railroad Company and the State of Alabama is          (p. 481)\r\n     indicative of extremely poor judgment on your part and reflects\r\n     unfavorably on your qualifications as a commissioned\r\n     officer.[19-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-23: Memo, CG, 3380th Tactical Training\r\n                   Wing, Keesler AFB, Miss., for (name withheld), Jul\r\n                   53, sub: Administrative Reprimand; NAACP News\r\n                   Release, 23 Nov 53; copies of both in SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nAs the young pilot's commanding officer put it, the lieutenant had\r\nrefused to accept the fact that military personnel must use tact and\r\ndiplomacy to avoid discrediting the United States Air Force.[19-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-24: Memo, Cmdr, 3615th Pilot Tng Wing,\r\n                   Craig AFB, Ala., for Cmdr, Flying Dir, Air Tng Cmd,\r\n                   Waco, Tex., 4 Aug 53, sub: Disciplinary Punishment,\r\n                   copy in SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nTact and diplomacy were also the keynote when the services helped\r\nenforce the local segregation practices of the nation's allies. This\r\nbecame increasingly true even in Europe in the 1950's, although never\r\nwith as much publicity as the events connected with the carrier\r\n_Midway's_ visit to Capetown, South Africa, in 1955. Its captain, on\r\nthe advice of the U.S. consul, agreed to conform with a local law that\r\nsegregated sailors when they were ashore. This agreement became public\r\nknowledge while the ship was en route, but despite a rash of protests\r\nand congressional demands that the visit be canceled, the _Midway_\r\narrived at Capetown. Later a White House spokesman tried to put a good\r\nface on the incident:\r\n\r\n     We believe that a far greater blow was struck for the cause of\r\n     equal justice when 23,000 South Africans came aboard the Midway\r\n     on a non-segregated basis--when the whole community saw American\r\n     democracy in action--than could have been made if we had decided\r\n     to by-pass Capetown. Certainly no friends for our cause would\r\n     have been gained in that way![19-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-25: Ltr, Maxwell M.

For example, one black soldier requested transfer\r\nbecause of discrimination he was forced to endure in the vicinity of\r\nCamp Hanford, Washington. His request was denied, and in commenting on\r\nthe case the Army's G-1 gave a typical service excuse when he said\r\nthat the Army could not practically arrange for the mass reassignment\r\nof black soldiers or the restriction of their assignments to certain\r\ngeographical areas to avoid discrimination.[19-26] The Air Force added\r\na further twist. Replying to a similar request, a spokesman wrote that\r\nlimiting the number of bases to which black airmen could be assigned\r\nwould be \"contrary to the policy of equality of treatment.\"[19-27]\r\nThere was, however, one exception to the refusal to alter assignments\r\nfor racial reasons. Both the Air Force and the Army had an established\r\nand frequently reiterated policy of not assigning troops involved  (p. 482)\r\nin interracial marriages to states where such unions were\r\nillegal.[19-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-26: Memo, ACofS, G-1, for TIG, 30 Nov 53,\r\n                   sub: Complaint of Cpl Israel Joshua, G-1 291.2 (3\r\n                   Nov 53).

Answering a complaint made by Congressman Powell in 1956,\r\nfor example, The Adjutant General of the Army explained that off-duty\r\nentertainment did not fall within the scope of the Truman order. Since\r\nmost dances were sponsored by outside groups, they had to take place\r\n\"under conditions cited by them.\" To insist on integration in this\r\ninstance, The Adjutant General argued, would mean cancellation of\r\nthese dances to the detriment of the soldiers' morale. For that\r\nreason, segregated dances would continue on post.[19-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-29: Ltr, TAG to Powell, 9 Aug 56, GF\r\n                   124-A-1, Eisenhower Library.]\r\n\r\nThis response illustrates the services' approach to equal opportunity\r\nand treatment during the Eisenhower administration. The President\r\nshowed a strong reluctance to interfere with local laws and customs, a\r\nreluctance that seemed to flow out of a pronounced constitutional\r\nscruple against federal intervention in defiance of local racial laws.\r\nThe practical consequence of this scruple was readily apparent in the\r\narmed forces throughout his administration. In 1955, for example, a\r\nblack veteran called the President's attention to the plight of black\r\nsoldiers, part of an integrated group, who were denied service in an\r\nAlabama airport and left unfed throughout their long journey.\r\nAnswering for the President, Maxwell M. Rabb, Secretary to the\r\nCabinet, reaffirmed Eisenhower's dedication to equal opportunity but\r\nadded that it was not in the scope of the President's authority \"to\r\nintervene in matters which are of local or state-wide concern and\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of local legislation and determination.\"[19-30]\r\nAgain to a black soldier complaining of being denied service near Fort\r\nBragg, North Carolina, a White House assistant, himself a Negro,\r\nreplied that \"outside of an Army post, there is little that the\r\nFederal Government can do, except to appeal to the decency of the\r\ncitizens to treat men in uniform with courtesy and respect.\" He then\r\nsuggested a course of action for black soldiers:\r\n\r\n     The President's heart bleeds when any Americans are victims of\r\n     injustice, and he is doing everything he possibly can to rectify\r\n     this situation in our country.\r\n\r\n     You can hold up his hand by carrying on, despite the unpleasant\r\n     things that are happening to you at this moment, realizing that,\r\n     on this end, we will work all the harder to make your sacrifices\r\n     worthwhile.[19-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-30: Ltrs, C.

This presidential   (p. 483)\r\nresolution was particularly obvious in the integration of civilian\r\nfacilities at Navy shipyards and installations and in schools for\r\ndependent children on military posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Integration of Navy Shipyards_\r\n\r\nThe Navy employed many thousands of civilians, including a large\r\nnumber of Negroes, at some forty-three installations from Virginia to\r\nTexas. At the Norfolk shipyard, for example, approximately 35 percent\r\nof the 15,000 employees were black. To the extent dictated by local\r\nlaws and customs, black employees were segregated and otherwise\r\ndiscriminated against. The degree of segregation depended upon\r\nlocation, and, according to a 1953 newspaper survey, ranged \"from\r\nminor in most instances to substantial in a few cases.\"[19-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-32: UPI News Release, 20 Aug 53, copy in\r\n                   CMH files.]\r\n\r\nIn January 1952 the Chief of the Office of Industrial Relations, Rear\r\nAdm. W. McL. Hague, all but absolved Navy installations from the\r\nprovisions of Executive Order 9980.[19-33] He announced that\r\nsegregation would continue if \"the station is subject to local laws of\r\nthe community in which located, and the laws of the community require\r\nsegregated facilities,\" or if segregation were \"the norm of the\r\ncommunity and conversion to common facilities would, in the judgment\r\nof the commanding officer, result in definite impediment to productive\r\neffort.\" Known officially as \"OIR Notice CP75,\" Hague's statement left\r\nlittle doubt that segregation would remain the norm in most instances.\r\nIt specified that a change to integrated facilities would be allowed\r\nonly after the commander had decided that it could be accomplished\r\nwithout \"inordinate interference with the Station's ability to carry\r\nout its mission.\" If other facilities stood nearby, the change would\r\nbe allowed only after he had coordinated with the naval district\r\ncommander.[19-34] Shortly thereafter the Acting Secretary of the Navy\r\nexpressed his agreement with Hague's statement,[19-35] thus elevating\r\nit to an official expression of Navy policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-33: Executive Order 9980, announcing\r\n                   regulations governing fair employment practices\r\n                   within the federal government, was signed by\r\n                   President Truman on 26 July 1948, the same day and\r\n                   as a companion to his order on equal treatment and\r\n                   opportunity in the services.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-34: OIR Notice CP75, Chief, Office of\r\n                   Industrial Relations, to Chiefs, Bureaus, et al.,\r\n                   23 Jan 52, sub: Segregation of Facilities for Civil\r\n                   Service Employees; Navy Department Policy.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-35: Ltr, Actg SecNav Francis Whitehair to\r\n                   Jerry O.

Evans, in the Department of Defense, charged that this\r\nwas in fact the \"insidious intent\" of Hague's notice. He pointed out\r\nto Assistant Secretary of Defense Rosenberg that signs and notices of\r\nsegregation were reappearing over drinking fountains and toilets at\r\nnaval installations which had abandoned such practices, that men in\r\nuniform were now subjected to segregation at such facilities, and that\r\nthe local press was making the unrefuted claim that local law was  (p. 484)\r\nbeing reestablished on federal properties.[19-36] Somewhat late to the\r\nbattle, Dennis D. Nelson seemingly a permanent fixture in the\r\nPentagon, spoke out against his department's policy, but from a\r\ndifferent angle. He warned the Secretary of the Navy through his aide\r\nthat Notice 75 was embarrassing not only for the Navy but for the\r\nWhite House as well.[19-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-36: Draft Memo, Evans for Rosenberg,\r\n                   SecDef 291.2.

The notice quickly won the attention of\r\ncivil rights leaders. Walter White condemned the policy, but his\r\nprotest, along with the sharp complaints of the NAACP's Clarence\r\nMitchell and Jerry Gilliam and the arguments of the Urban League's\r\nLester Granger, failed to move Secretary of the Navy Dan A.\r\nKimball.[19-38] The secretary insisted that integrating these\r\ninstallations might jeopardize the fulfillment of the Navy's mission,\r\ndependent as it was on the \"efficiency and whole-hearted cooperation\"\r\nof the employees. \"In a very realistic way,\" he told Walter White, the\r\nNavy must recognize and conform to local labor customs and\r\nusages.[19-39] Answering Rosenberg's inquiry on the subject, the Navy\r\ngave its formula for change:\r\n\r\n     This Department cannot take the initiative in correcting this\r\n     social ill but must content itself with being alert to take\r\n     advantage of the gradual dissolution of these racial prejudices\r\n     which can be effectively brought about only by a process of\r\n     social education and understanding.

Should Eisenhower falter, there was always his\r\n1952 campaign ally, Congressman Powell, to remind him of his\r\n\"forthright stand on segregation when federal funds are expended.\"[19-42]\r\nIn colorful prose that pulled no punches, Powell reminded the\r\nPresident of his many black supporters and pressed him on the Navy's\r\ncontinuing segregation. Although he denied Powell's charge of\r\nobstructionist tactics in the executive branch, the President had in\r\nfact been told by Maxwell Rabb, now serving as his minority affairs\r\nassistant, that \"some government agencies were neglecting their\r\nduty.\"[19-43] The President responded to this news promptly enough by\r\nordering Rabb to supervise the executive agencies in their application\r\nof the presidential racial policy. Rabb thereafter discussed the\r\nNavy's policy with Secretary Anderson and his assistants on 11 June\r\n1953.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-42: Ltr, Powell to Eisenhower, 17 Apr 53,\r\n                   copy in SecNav files, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-43: Dwight D.

He had been unaware of the implications of the\r\nproblem, he later explained, and had accepted his predecessor's\r\njudgment. His mistake, he pled, was one of timing not intent.[19-44]\r\nYet Anderson had conducted a wide correspondence on the subject,\r\ndiscussed the matter with Lester Granger, and as late as 28 May was\r\nstill defending Notice 75, telling Special White House Assistant\r\nWilton B. Persons that it represented a practical answer to a problem\r\nthat could not be corrected by edict. Nor could he introduce any\r\nchanges, he maintained, adopting his predecessor's argument that the\r\nNavy should \"be alert to take advantage of its [segregation's] gradual\r\ndissolution through the process of social education and\r\nunderstanding.\"[19-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-44: Interv, Nichols with Anderson, 18 Sep\r\n                   53, and Nichols UPI Release, 21 Sep 53; both in\r\n                   Nichols Collection, CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-45: Ltrs, SecNav to W.

In an\r\naddress to the NAACP annual convention, Walter White plainly referred\r\nto the secretary's position as a \"defiance of President Eisenhower's\r\norder.\"[19-46] If such barbed criticism left the secretary unmoved,\r\nRabb carried a stronger weapon, and in their 11 June meeting the two\r\nmen discussed the President's order to integrate federally owned or\r\ncontrolled properties, the possibility of a Supreme Court decision on\r\nthe same subject, and, more to the point, Powell's public statements\r\nconcerning segregation at the Norfolk and Charleston naval\r\nshipyards.[19-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-46: White, Address Delivered at 44th\r\n                   NAACP Annual Convention, 28 Jun 53, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-47: Memo, Under SecNav for President, 23\r\n                   Jun 53, sub: Segregation in Naval Activities,\r\n                   attached to Ltr, Under SecNav to Sherman Adams, 24\r\n                   Jun 53, P 8(4), GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY ANDERSON _talks to a member of the fleet_.]\r\n\r\nAnderson then proceeded to reverse his position. He began by       (p. 486)\r\nordering a survey of a group of southern installations to estimate\r\nthe effect of integration on their civilian programs. He learned\r\nsegregation could be virtually eliminated at these shipyards and\r\nstations within six months, although Under Secretary Charles S.\r\nThomas, who prepared the report, agreed with the local commanders that\r\nan integration directive would be certain to cause trouble. But the\r\nformula chosen by the commanders for eliminating segregation, in which\r\nThomas concurred, might well have given Anderson pause. They wanted to\r\nremove racial signs from drinking fountains and toilets, certain that\r\nthe races would continue using separate facilities, and leave the\r\nproblem of segregated cafeterias till later. It was the unanimous\r\nopinion of those involved, Thomas reported, that the situation should\r\nnot be forced by \"agitators,\" a category in which they all placed\r\nPowell.\r\n\r\nOn 20 August Anderson directed commanders of segregated facilities to\r\nproceed steadily toward complete elimination of racial barriers.\r\nFurthermore, each commander was to submit a progress report on 1\r\nNovember and at sixty-day intervals thereafter.[19-48] Although the\r\nsecretary was concerned with the possible reaction of the civil rights\r\ngroups were integration not achieved in the first sixty days, he was\r\ndetermined to give local commanders some leeway in carrying out his\r\norder.[19-49] But he made it clear to the press that he did not intend\r\n\"to put up with inaction.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-48: ALL NAV, 20 Aug 53; Ltr, Chief,\r\n                   Industrial Relations, to Commandant, 6th Naval\r\n                   District, 21 Aug 53, OIR 200, GenRecsNav.

In a period when national attention was focused on\r\nthe constitutional implications of segregated education, the\r\nEisenhower administration was thrust into a dispute over the intent of\r\nfederal aid to education and eventually into a reappraisal of the\r\nfederal role in public education. Confusing to the Department of\r\nDefense, the President's personal attitude remained somewhat ambiguous\r\nthroughout the controversy. He had publicly committed himself to\r\nending segregation in federally financed institutions, yet he had\r\ndeclared scruples against federal interference with state laws and\r\ncustoms that would prevent him from acting to keep such a pledge when\r\nall its ramifications were revealed.\r\n\r\nIn fact not one but four separate categories of educational\r\ninstitutions came under scrutiny. Only the first category, schools run\r\nby the U.S. Office of Education for the Department of Defense overseas\r\nand on military reservations in the United States, operated\r\nexclusively with federal funds. The next two categories, schools\r\noperated by local school districts on military reservations and\r\nschools on federal land usually adjacent to a military reservation,\r\nwere supported by local and state funds with federal subsidies. The\r\nfourth and by far the largest group contained the many community\r\nschools attended by significant numbers of military dependents. These\r\nschools received considerable federal support through the impact aid\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThe federal support program for schools in \"federally impacted\" areas\r\nadded yet another dimension to the administration's reappraisal. The\r\nimpact aid legislation (Public Laws 815 and 874),[19-53] like similar\r\nprograms during World War II, was based on the premise that a school\r\ndistrict derived no tax from land occupied by a federal installation\r\nbut usually incurred an increase in school enrollment. In many cases\r\nthe enrollment of military dependents was far greater than that of the\r\ncommunities in the school district. Actually, these programs were not\r\nlimited to the incursion of military families; the most extreme\r\nfederal impact in terms of enrollment percentages was found in remote\r\nmountain districts where in some cases almost all students were\r\nchildren of U.S. Forest Service or National Park Service employees.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-53: PL 815, 23 Sep 50, 64 U.S. 967; PL\r\n                   874, 30 Sep 50, 64 U.S. 1100.]\r\n\r\nIn recognition of these inequities in the tax system, Congress gave\r\nsuch school systems special \"in-lieu of tax\" support. Public Law 815\r\nprovided for capital projects, land, buildings, and major equipment;\r\nPublic Law 874 gave operating support in the form of salaries,     (p. 488)\r\nsupplies, and the like. If, for example, a school district could prove\r\nat least 3 percent of its enrollment federally connected, it was\r\neligible to receive from the U.S. Office of Education a grant equal to\r\nthe district's cost of instruction for federally connected students.\r\nIf it could show federally connected enrollment necessitated\r\nadditional classrooms, the school district was eligible for federally\r\nfinanced buildings. Such schools were usually concentrated in military\r\nhousing areas, but examples existed of federally financed schools,\r\nlike federal dependents, scattered throughout the school district.\r\nStudents from the community at large attended the federally\r\nconstructed schools and the school district continued to receive state\r\nsupport for all students. Although Public Law 874 was far more\r\nimportant in terms of general application and fiscal impact, its\r\ncompanion piece, Public Law 815, was more important to integration\r\nbecause it involved the construction of schools. From the beginning\r\nCongress sought to prevent these laws from becoming a means by which\r\nfederal authorities exercised control over the operation of school\r\ndistricts. It stipulated that \"no department, officer or employee of\r\nthe United States shall exercise any direction, supervision or control\r\nover the personnel, curriculum or program of instruction\" of any local\r\nschool or school system.[19-54] The firmness of this admonition, an\r\nindication of congressional opinion on this important issue, later\r\nplayed a decisive part in the integration story.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-54: Sec. 7a, PL 874, 64 U.S. 1100.]\r\n\r\nAttacks on segregation in schools attended by military dependents did\r\nnot begin until the early fifties when the Army, in answer to\r\ncomplaints concerning segregated schools in Texas, Oklahoma, and\r\nVirginia, began using a stock answer to the effect that the schools\r\nwere operated by state agencies as part of the state school system\r\nsubject to state law.[19-55] Trying to justify the situation to\r\nClarence Mitchell, Assistant Secretary of the Army Fred Korth cited\r\nPublic Law 874, whose intent, he claimed, was that educating children\r\nresiding on federal property was the responsibility of \"the local\r\neducational agency.\"[19-56]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-55: DA Office of Legislative Liaison\r\n                   Summary Sheet for ASA, 27 Sep 51, sub: Alleged\r\n                   Segregation Practiced at Fort Bliss, Texas, CS\r\n                   291.2 Negroes (17 Sep 51); Ltr, CG, The Artillery\r\n                   School, to Parents of School Age Children, 2 Sep\r\n                   52, sub: School Information, AG 352.9 AKPSIGP.

He reminded Assistant Secretary Rosenberg that\r\nPresident Truman had vetoed an education bill in 1951 because of\r\nprovisions requiring segregation in schools on federal property. As a\r\nmember of the subcommittee that guided Public Law 874 through\r\nCongress, Humphrey could assure Rosenberg that at no time did Congress\r\ninclude language requiring segregation in post schools. Thanks to the\r\nArmy's interpretation, he observed, local community segregation\r\npractices were being extended for the first time to federal property\r\nunder the guise of compliance with federal law. He predicted further\r\nincursions by the segregationists if this move was left\r\nunchallenged.[19-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-57: Ltr, Humphrey to ASD (M&P), 16 Oct\r\n                   52, OASD (M&P) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nAfter conferring with both Humphrey and Mitchell, Rosenberg took   (p. 489)\r\nthe matter of segregated schools on military posts to the U.S.\r\nCommissioner of Education, Earl J. McGrath. With Secretary of Defense\r\nLovett's approval she put the department on record as opposed to\r\nsegregated schools on posts because they were \"violative not only of\r\nthe policy of the Department\" but also of \"the policy set forth by the\r\nPresident.\"[19-58] Evidently McGrath saw Public Law 874 in the same\r\nlight, for on 15 January 1953 he informed Rosenberg that if the\r\nDepartment of Defense outlawed segregated dependent schooling and\r\nlocal educational agencies were unable to comply, his office would\r\nhave to make \"other arrangements\" for the children.[19-59]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-58: Ltr, ASD (M&P) to U.S. Commissioner\r\n                   of Educ, 10 Jan 53, SecDef 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-59: Ltr, U.S. Commissioner of Educ to ASD\r\n                   (M&P), 15 Jan 53; Ltr, ASD (M&P) to Humphrey, 10\r\n                   Jan 53; both in OASD 291.2.]\r\n\r\nCommissioner McGrath proposed that his office discuss the integration\r\nquestion further with Defense Department representatives but the\r\nchange in administrations interrupted these negotiations and\r\nRosenberg's successor, John A. Hannah, made it clear that there would\r\nbe no speedy change in the racial composition of post schools.\r\nCommenting at Hannah's request on the points raised by McGrath, the\r\nArmy's principal personnel officer concluded that integration should\r\nbe considered a departmental goal, but one that should be approached\r\nby steps \"consistent with favorable local conditions as determined by\r\nthe installation commander concerned.\" In his opinion, committing the\r\ndepartment to integration of all on-post schools, as the Assistant\r\nSecretary of Defense had proposed earlier, would create teacher\r\nprocurement problems and additional financial burdens.[19-60] This\r\ncautious endorsement of integrated schools was further qualified by\r\nthe Secretary of the Army. It was a \"desirable goal,\" he told Hannah,\r\nbut \"positive steps to eliminate segregation ... should be preceded\r\nby a careful analysis of the impact on each installation\r\nconcerned.\"[19-61] Hannah then broke off negotiations with the Office\r\nof Education.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-60: G-1 Summary Sheet for CofS, 13 Feb\r\n                   53, sub: Segregation of School Children on Military\r\n                   Installations, G-1 291.2 (15 Jan 53).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-61: Memo, Exec Off, SA, for ASD (M&P), 20\r\n                   Feb 53, sub: Proposed Reply to U.S. Commissioner of\r\n                   Education Regarding Segregation in Dependent\r\n                   Schools, copy in G-1 291.2 (15 Jan 53).]\r\n\r\nThe matter was rescued from bureaucratic limbo when in answer to a\r\nquestion during his 19 March 1953 press conference President\r\nEisenhower promised to investigate the school situation, adding:\r\n\r\n     I will say this--I repeat it, I have said it again and again:\r\n     whenever Federal funds are expended for anything, I do not see\r\n     how any American can justify--legally, or logically, or\r\n     morally--a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds as\r\n     among our citizens. All are taxed to provide these funds. If\r\n     there is any benefit to be derived from them, I think they must\r\n     all share, regardless of such inconsequential factors as race and\r\n     religion.[19-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-62: President's News Conference, 19 Mar\r\n                   53, _Public Papers of the Presidents: Dwight D.\r\n                   Eisenhower, 1953_, p. 108.]\r\n\r\nThe sweeping changes implied in this declaration soon became apparent.\r\nStatistics compiled as a result of the White House investigation\r\nrevealed that federal dependents attended thousands of schools, a\r\ncomplex mix of educational institutions having little more in common than\r\ntheir mutual dependence in whole or part on federal funds.[19-63]  (p. 490)\r\nMost were under local government control and the great majority,\r\nincluding the community public schools, were situated a long distance\r\nfrom any military base. The President was no doubt unaware of the\r\nramifications of federal enrollment and impacted aid on the nation's\r\nschools when he made his declaration, and, given his philosophy of\r\ngovernment and the status of civil rights at the time, it is not\r\nsurprising that his promise to look into the subject came to nothing.\r\nFrom the beginning Secretary of Defense Wilson limited the\r\ndepartment's campaign against segregated schools to those on federal\r\n_property_ rather than those using federal _funds_. And even this\r\nlimited effort to integrate schools on federal property encountered\r\ndetermined opposition from many local officials and only the\r\nhalfhearted support of some of the federal officials involved.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-63: Memo for Rcd, Human Relations and\r\n                   Research Br, G-1 (ca.

Its overseas schools, especially in\r\nGermany and Japan, had always been integrated, and its schools in the\r\nUnited States now quickly followed suit. Eleven in number, they were\r\npaid for and operated by the U.S. Commissioner of Education because\r\nthe states in which they were located prohibited the use of state\r\nfunds for schools on federal property. With only minimal public\r\nattention, all but one of these schools was operating on an integrated\r\nbasis by 1953. The exception was the elementary school at Fort\r\nBenning, Georgia, which at the request of the local school board\r\nremained a white-only school. On 20 March 1953 the new Secretary of\r\nthe Army, Robert T. Stevens, informed the White House that this school\r\nhad been ordered to commence integrated operations in the fall.[19-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-64: Memo, SA for James Hagerty, White\r\n                   House Press Secretary, 20 Mar 53, sub: Segregation\r\n                   in Army Schools, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe integration of schools operated by local school authorities on\r\nmilitary posts was not so simple, and before the controversy died down\r\nthe Department of Defense found itself assuming responsibility for a\r\nnumber of formerly state-operated institutions. As of April 1953,\r\ntwenty-one of these sixty-three schools in the United States were\r\noperating on a segregated basis.

The\r\ncommanders found, for example, that the twenty-one school districts\r\ninvolved would not operate the schools as integrated institutions. (p. 492)\r\nWilson also stressed that operating the schools under federal\r\nauthority would be very expensive, but his recommendation was\r\nexplicit.

By 18 February all\r\nhad issued specific directives for enforcing it. The Secretary of the\r\nNavy, for example, declared that the \"policy of non-segregation\" would\r\napply\r\n\r\n     to the operation of existing schools and school facilities\r\n     hereafter constructed on Navy and Marine Corps installations\r\n     within the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the\r\n     Virgin Islands, the area in which Public Law 874 and ... 815 ...\r\n     are operative....

In response\r\nto queries on the subject, the services quoted their instructions, and\r\nif they excused continued segregation during the 1954 school year they\r\nwere adamant about the September 1955 integration date.[19-76] The\r\nresponse of Secretary of the Air Force Talbott to one request for an\r\nextension revealed the services' determination to stick to the letter\r\nof the Wilson order. Talbott agreed with the superintendent of the\r\nMontgomery County, Alabama, school board that local school boards were\r\nbest qualified to run the schools for dependent children of the\r\nmilitary, but he refused to extend the deadline. \"Unilateral action in\r\nthe case of individual Air Force base schools would be in violation of\r\nthe directive,\" he explained, adding: \"At such time as the Alabama\r\nlegislature acts to permit your local board of education to operate\r\nthe school at Maxwell AFB on an integrated basis, the Air Force will\r\nreturn operational responsibility for the school to the local board at\r\nthe earliest practicable date.\"[19-77]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-76: Ltr, SecNav to Clarence Mitchell, 30\r\n                   Apr 54; Ltr, Jack Cochrane, BuPers Realty Legal\r\n                   Section, to B.

This move by the armed forces, he   (p. 494)\r\npointed out, could have far-reaching effects.

A small group of institutions\r\nbuilt and operated by local authorities stood on land leased from the\r\nservices. At the time of Secretary Wilson's order this category of\r\nschools included three with 75-year leases, those at Fort Meade,\r\nMaryland, and Fort Bliss and Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, and one with\r\na 25-year lease at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas.[19-80] The Air\r\nForce's general counsel believed the lease could be broken in light\r\nof the Wilson order, but the possibility developed that some\r\nextensions might be granted to these schools because of the lease\r\ncomplication.[19-81] The Secretary of the Army went right to the\r\npoint, asking the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Carter L. Burgess,\r\nfor an extension in the case of Fort Meade pending Maryland's\r\nintegration of its schools under the Supreme Court's decision.[19-82]\r\nIn response Burgess ordered, as of 1 June 1955, the exemption of four\r\nschools. \"No attempt shall be made,\" he informed the services, \"to\r\nbreak the lease or take over operation of the schools pending further\r\ninstruction from the Secretary of Defense.\"[19-83]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-80: Ltr, Col Staunton Brown, USA,\r\n                   District Engineer, Little Rock District, to\r\n                   Division Engineer, Southwestern Div, 8 Jun 56, sub:\r\n                   Meeting With Representatives of White Hall School\r\n                   District, Pine Bluff Arsenal; Memo, Asst Adjutant,\r\n                   Second Army, for CG, Second Army, 7 Jun 56, sub:\r\n                   Lease for Meade Heights Elementary School; copies\r\n                   of both in OASD (M&P) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-81: Memo, AF General Counsel for Dir of\r\n                   Mil Pers, 29 Mar 55, sub: Lease on Property\r\n                   Occupied by Briggs Air Force Base Dependent's\r\n                   School; Memo, Asst SecAF for ASD (M&P), 24 May 55,\r\n                   sub: Biggs Air Force Base Dependent School; both in\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-82: Memo, ASA for ASD (M&P), 3 May 55,\r\n                   sub: Elimination of Segregation in On-Post Public\r\n                   Schools, OASD (M&P) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-83: Memo, ASD (M&P) for SA et al., 1 Jun\r\n                   55, sub: Operation of Dependent Schools on Military\r\n                   Installations on an Integrated Basis; idem for\r\n                   SecDef et al., 25 Aug 55, sub: Status of Racial\r\n                   Integration in Schools on Military Installations\r\n                   for Dependents of Military and Civilian Personnel;\r\n                   both in OASD (M&P) 291.2 (25 Aug 55).]\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the question of temporary extensions was\r\nresolved. Two of the leased property schools, Biggs and Fort Bliss,\r\nwere integrated before the September deadline as a result of a change\r\nin state law in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision. Then, on 16\r\nJuly 1956, the Assistant Secretary of the Army reported that the\r\nphased integration of Fort Meade's elementary school had\r\nstarted.[19-84] The Pine Bluff Arsenal case was still unresolved in\r\n1956, but since at that time there were no black dependents at the\r\ninstallation it was not considered so pressing by Burgess, who allowed\r\nthe extension to continue beyond 1956. Besides, it turned out there\r\nwere still other schools in this category that the Navy had\r\ntemporarily exempted from the September 1955 deadline. The school at\r\nthe Patuxent River Naval Air Station, for example, which had no black\r\ndependents eligible for attendance, was allowed to continue to operate\r\nas usual while negotiations were under way for the transfer of the\r\nschool and property to the St. Mary's County, Maryland, school     (p. 495)\r\nboard.[19-85] A lease for the temporary use of buildings by local\r\nauthorities for segregated schools on the grounds of the New Orleans\r\nNaval Air Station was allowed to run on until 1959 because of\r\ntechnicalities in the lease, but not, however, without considerable\r\npublic comment.[19-86]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-84: Memo, ASA for ASD (M&P), 16 Jul 56,\r\n                   sub: Status of Racial Integration in Schools at\r\n                   Fort George G.

In\r\nless than three years after President Eisenhower had promised to look\r\ninto segregated schools for military dependents, the department had\r\nintegrated hundreds of classrooms, inducing local authorities to\r\nintegrate a series of schools in areas that had never before seen\r\nblacks and whites educated together. It had even ordered the\r\nintegration of classes conducted on post by local universities and (p. 496)\r\nvoluntarily attended by servicemen in off-duty hours.[19-87] Yet many\r\ndependent schools were untouched because Wilson's order applied only\r\nto schools on federal property. It ignored the largest category of\r\ndependent schools, those in the local community that because of heavy\r\nenrollment of federal dependents were supported in whole or part by\r\nfederal funds. In these institutions some 28,000 federal dependents\r\nwere being educated in segregated classes. Integration for them would\r\nhave to await the long court battles that followed _Brown_ v. _Board\r\nof Education_.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-87: Ltr, Sen. Herbert Lehman to SecDef,\r\n                   10 Oct 56; Ltr, SecDef to Lehman, 15 Oct 56, both\r\n                   in SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThis dreary prospect had not always seemed so inevitable. Although\r\nWilson's order ignored local public schools, civil rights advocates\r\ndid not, and the problem of off-base segregation, typified by the\r\nhighly publicized school at the Little Rock Air Force Base in 1958,\r\nbecame an issue involving not only the Department of Defense but the\r\nwhole administration. The decision to withhold federal aid to school\r\ndistricts that remained segregated in defiance of court orders was\r\nclearly beyond the power of the Department of Defense. In a memorandum\r\ncirculated among Pentagon officials in October 1958, Assistant\r\nSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Elliot C. Richardson\r\ndiscussed the legal background of federal aid to schools attended by\r\nmilitary dependents, especially congressional intent and the\r\ndefinition of \"suitable\" facilities as expressed in Public Laws 815\r\nand 874. He also took up the question of whether to provide off-base\r\nintegrated schooling, balancing the difficult problem of protecting\r\nthe civil rights of federal employees against the educational\r\nadvantages of a state-sponsored education system. Richardson mentioned\r\nthe great variation in school population--some bases having seven high\r\nschool aged children one year, none the next--and the fact that the\r\ncost of educating the 28,087 dependents attending segregated schools\r\nin 1957 would amount to more than $49 million for facilities and $8.7\r\nmillion annually for operations. He was left with one possible\r\nconclusion, that \"irrespective of our feelings about the unsuitability\r\nof segregated education as a matter of principle, we are constrained\r\nby the legislative history, the settled administrative construction,\r\nand the other circumstances surrounding the statutes in question to\r\nadhere to the existing interpretation of them.\"[19-88]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-88: Memo, Asst Secy of HEW for Secy of\r\n                   HEW, 4 Oct 58, sub: Payments of Segregated Schools\r\n                   Under P.L. 815 and P.L. 874, Incl to Ltr, Asst Secy\r\n                   of HEW to ASD (M&P), 10 Oct 58, OASD (M&P)291.2 (10\r\n                   Oct 58).]\r\n\r\nRichardson might be \"constrained\" to accept the _status quo_, but some\r\nblack parents were not. In the fall of 1958 matters came to a head at\r\nthe school near the Little Rock air base. Here was a new facility,\r\nbuilt by the local school board exclusively with federal funds, on\r\nstate land, and intended primarily for the education of dependents\r\nliving at a newly constructed military base. On the eve of the\r\nschool's opening, the Pulaski County school board informed the Air\r\nForce that the school would be for white students only. The decision\r\nwas brought to the President's attention by a telegram from a black\r\nsergeant's wife whose child was denied admission.[19-89] The telegram\r\nwas only the first in a series of protests from congressmen, civil (p. 497)\r\nrights organizations, and interested citizens. For all the Defense\r\nDepartment had a stock answer: there was nothing the Air Force could\r\ndo. The service neither owned nor operated the school, and the impact\r\naid laws forbade construction of federal school facilities if the\r\nlocal school districts could provide public school education for\r\nfederal dependents.[19-90]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-89: Memo, Dir of Pers Policy, OSD, for\r\n                   Stephen Jackson, 29 Aug 58, sub: Air Force\r\n                   Segregated School Situation in Pulaski County,\r\n                   Arkansas (San Francisco _Chronicle_ article of Aug\r\n                   26, 58); Memo for Rec, Stephen Jackson, OASD (M&P),\r\n                   8 Oct 58, sub: Integration of Little Rock Air Force\r\n                   Base School, Jacksonville, Ark., attached to Memo,\r\n                   ASD (M&P) for SA et al., 10 Oct 58.

If the department transferred the father, it was open to\r\na court suit on his behalf; if it tried to force integration on the\r\nlocal authorities, they would close the school. Since neither course\r\nwas acceptable, Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles C. Finucane\r\nordered his troubleshooter, Stephen Jackson, to Little Rock to\r\ninvestigate.[19-92]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-91: Memo, Lt Col Winston P.

The school would then be on a\r\nmilitary base and subject to integration. Should local authorities\r\nrefuse to operate the integrated on-base school, the Air Force would\r\ndo so. In that event, Jackson warned local officials on his arrival in\r\nArkansas, the school district would lose much of its federal\r\nenrollment and hence its very important federal subsidy. Nor could the\r\nboard be assured that the federal acquisition would be limited to one\r\nschool. Jackson later admitted the local black school had also been\r\nconstructed with federal funds, and he could not guarantee that it\r\nwould escape federal acquisition. Board members queried Jackson on\r\nthis point, introducing the possibility that the federal government\r\nmight try to acquire local high schools, also attended in large\r\nnumbers by military dependents and also segregated. Jackson assured\r\nthe school board that the department \"had no desire to change the\r\ncommunity patterns where schools were already in existence merely\r\nbecause they received federal aid,\"[19-93] a statement that amounted\r\nto a new federal policy.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-93: Memo for Rcd, Dep ASD (MR&P), 8 Oct\r\n                   58, sub: Integration of Little Rock Air Force Base\r\n                   School, Jacksonville, Ark.; attached to Memo, ASD\r\n                   (MP&R) for SA et al., 10 Oct 58, OASD (MP&R)\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nJackson failed to convince the board, and in late October 1958 it\r\nrejected the government's offer to run an integrated school on land\r\npurchased from them.[19-94] Jackson thereupon met with justice\r\nofficials and together they decided that sometime before 1 January\r\n1959 the Justice Department would acquire title to the school land for\r\none year by taking a leasehold through the right of eminent domain.\r\nThey did not at that time, however, formulate any definite plan of (p. 498)\r\naction to accomplish the school take-over.[19-95]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-94: Memo for Rcd, Dep Asst SecAF, 24 Nov\r\n                   58, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-95: Ibid.; Memo, Lt Col Winston P.\r\n                   Anderson, Exec Off, Asst SecAF (M&P) for Asst SecAF\r\n                   (M&P), 24 Nov 58, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nIt was just as well, for soon after this decision was reached the\r\nNAACP brought up the subject of dependent schools near the Air Force\r\nbases at Blytheville, Arkansas, and Stewart, Tennessee.[19-96] Air\r\nForce Deputy Assistant Secretary James P. Goode was quick to point out\r\nthat there were at least five other segregated schools constructed\r\nwith federal funds, situated near Air Force bases, and attended almost\r\nexclusively by federal dependents. He also predicted that a careful\r\nsurvey would reveal perhaps another fifteen schools in segregated\r\ndistricts serving only Air Force dependents. In light of these facts,\r\nand with a frankly confessed aversion to the administration's\r\nacquisition of the properties by right of eminent domain, Goode\r\npreferred to have the schools integrated in an orderly manner through\r\nthe supervision of the federal courts.[19-97]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-96: Memo, Asst SecAF (M&P) for Under\r\n                   SecAF, 26 Nov 58, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-97: Memo, Dep Asst SecAF (MP&R) for Asst\r\n                   SecAF (MP&R), 26 Nov 58, sub: Little Rock Air Force\r\n                   Base Elementary School, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThis attitude was to prevail for some time in the Department of\r\nDefense. In April 1961, for example, the Assistant Secretary for\r\nManpower informed a Senate subcommittee that, while schools under\r\ndepartmental jurisdiction were integrated \"without reservation and\r\nwith successful results,\" many children of black servicemen stationed\r\nin Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and elsewhere still attended\r\nsegregated off-post schools. Adjacent to military posts and attended\r\n\"in whole or in part by federal dependents,\" these schools \"conformed\r\nto state rather than federal laws.\"[19-98] And as late as May 1963, a\r\nnaval official admitted there was no way for the Navy to require\r\nschool officials in Key West, Florida, to conform to the Department of\r\nDefense's policy of equal opportunity.[19-99]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-98: Memo, ASD (M) for Chmn, Subcommittee\r\n                   on Education, Cmte on Labor and Pub Welfare, of the\r\n                   U.S. Senate, 25 Apr 61, OASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-99: Ltr, Rear Adm C.

In the\r\nfall of 1959, less than a year after the administration suspended its\r\ncampaign to integrate off-base schools in Arkansas, black Air Force\r\ndependents quietly entered the Little Rock school. At the same time,\r\nschools catering predominantly to military dependents near bases in\r\nFlorida and Tennessee integrated with little public attention.[19-100]\r\nUnder pressure from the courts, and after President Eisenhower had\r\ndiscussed the case in a national press conference in terms of the\r\nproper use of impact aid in segregated districts, the city of Norfolk,\r\nVirginia, agreed to integrate its 15,000 students, roughly one-third\r\nof whom were military dependents.[19-101]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-100: Morton Puner, \"What the Armed Forces\r\n                   Taught Us About Integration,\" _Coronet_ (June\r\n                   1960), reprinted in the _Congressional Record_,\r\n                   vol. 106, pp. 11564-65.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-101: Press Conference, 21 Jan 59, _Public\r\n                   Papers of the Presidents: Dwight D.

Before these limits could be breached a\r\nnew administration would have to redefine the scope of the Defense\r\nDepartment's power. Nevertheless, the armed forces had scored some\r\ndramatic successes in the field of race relations by 1960. Some five\r\nmillion servicemen, civilians, and their dependents were proving the\r\npracticality of integration on the job, in schools, and in everyday\r\nliving. Several writers even suggested that the services' experience\r\nhad itself become a dynamic force for social change in the United\r\nStates.[19-102] The New York _Times's_ Anthony Lewis went so far as to\r\nsay that the successful integration of military society led to the\r\nblack crusade against discrimination in civilian society.[19-103]\r\nOthers took the services' influence for granted, as Morton Puner did\r\nwhen he observed in 1959 that \"the armed services are more advanced in\r\ntheir race relations than the rest of the United States. Perhaps it is\r\nuniquely fitting that this should be so, that in one of the greatest\r\npeacetime battles of our history, the armed forces should be leading\r\nthe way to victory.\"[19-104]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-102: See Fred Richard Bahr, \"The\r\n                   Expanding Role of the Department of Defense as an\r\n                   Instrument of Social Change\" (Ph.D. dissertation,\r\n                   George Washington University, February 1970), ch.\r\n                   III.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-103: As quoted, ibid., p. 87.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-104: Morton Puner, \"Integration in the\r\n                   Army,\" _The New Leader_ 42 (January 12, 1959).]\r\n\r\nAs such encomiums became more frequent, successful integration became\r\na source of pride to the services. Military commanders with experience\r\nin Korea had, according to Assistant Secretary of Defense Hannah,\r\nuniversally accepted the new order as desirable, conceding that\r\nintegration worked \"very well\" despite predictions to the\r\ncontrary.[19-105] Nor was this attitude limited to military\r\ncommanders, for there had been considerable change in sentiment among\r\nsenior defense officials. Citing the major economies realized in the\r\nuse of manpower and facilities, Secretary Wilson reported to President\r\nEisenhower in March 1955 that the results of integration were\r\nencouraging:\r\n\r\n     Combat effectiveness is increased as individual capabilities\r\n     rather than racial designations determine assignments and\r\n     promotions. Economics in manpower and funds are achieved by the\r\n     elimination of racially duplicated facilities and operations.\r\n     Above all, our national security is improved by the more\r\n     effective utilization of military personnel, regardless of\r\n     race.[19-106]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-105: Extracted from an interview given by\r\n                   Hannah and published in _U.S. News and World\r\n                   Report_ 35 (October 16, 1953):99.

Moreover,\r\nsupporting Secretary Wilson's claim of national solidarity, major\r\ncivil rights organizations began to cite the racial experiences of the\r\narmed forces to strengthen their case against segregated American\r\nsociety. Civil rights leaders continued to press for action against\r\ndiscrimination outside the military reservation, but in the years\r\nafter Korea their sense of satisfaction with the department's progress\r\nwas quite obvious. At its national conventions in 1953 and 1954, for\r\nexample, the NAACP officially praised the services for their race\r\npolicy. As one writer observed, integration not only increased black\r\nsupport for the armed forces and black commitment to national defense\r\nduring the cold war, but it also boosted the department's prestige in\r\nthe black and white community alike, creating indirect political\r\nsupport for those politicians who sponsored the racial reforms.[19-108]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-108: Bahr, \"The Expanding Role of the\r\n                   Department of Defense,\" pp. 86-87.]\r\n\r\nBut what about the black serviceman himself? A Negro enlisting in the\r\narmed forces in 1960, unlike his counterpart in 1950, entered an\r\nintegrated military community. He would quickly discover traces of\r\ndiscrimination, especially in the form of unequal treatment in\r\nassignments, promotions, and the application of military justice, but\r\nfor a while at least these would seem minor irritants to a man who was\r\nmore often than not for the first time close to being judged by\r\nability rather than race.[19-109] It was a different story in the\r\ncivilian community, where the black serviceman's uniform commanded\r\nlittle more respect than it did in 1950. Eventually this contrast\r\nwould become so intolerable that he and his sympathizers would\r\nbeleaguer the Department of Defense with demands for action against\r\ndiscrimination in off-base housing, schools, and places of public\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 19-109: Ginzberg, _The Negro Potential_, p.\r\n                   90.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20                                                         (p. 501)\r\n\r\nLimited Response to Discrimination\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good feelings brought on by the integration of the armed forces\r\nlasted less than a decade. By the early 1960's the Department of\r\nDefense and the civil rights advocates had begun once more to draw\r\napart, the source of contention centering on their differing\r\ninterpretations of the scope of the Truman order. The Defense\r\nDepartment professed itself unable to interfere with community laws\r\nand customs even when those laws and customs discriminated against men\r\nin uniform. The civil rights leaders, however, rejected the federal\r\ngovernment's acceptance of the _status quo_. Reacting especially to\r\nthe widespread and blatant discrimination encountered by servicemen\r\nboth in communities adjacent to bases at home and abroad and in the\r\nreserve components of the services in many parts of the country, they\r\nstepped up demands for remedial action against a situation that they\r\nbelieved continued at the sufferance of the armed forces.\r\n\r\nNor were their demands limited to the problem of discrimination in the\r\nlocal community. Civil rights spokesmen backed the complaints of those\r\nblack servicemen who had begun to question their treatment in the\r\nmilitary community itself. Lacking what many of them considered an\r\neffective procedure for dealing with racial complaints, black\r\nservicemen usually passed on their grievances to congressmen and\r\nvarious civil rights organizations, and these, in turn, took the\r\nproblems to the Defense Department. The number of complaints over\r\ninequalities in promotion, assignment, and racial representation never\r\nmatched the volume of those on discrimination in the community, nor\r\ndid their appearance attest to a new set of problems or any particular\r\nincrease in discrimination. It seemed rather that the black\r\nserviceman, after the first flush of victory over segregation, was\r\nbeginning to perceive from the vantage of his improved position that\r\nother and perhaps more subtle barriers stood in his way. Whatever the\r\nreason, complaints of discrimination within the services themselves,\r\nrarely heard in the Pentagon in the late 1950's, suddenly\r\nreappeared.[20-1] Actually, the complaints about discrimination both\r\nin the local civilian community and on the military reservation called\r\nfor a basic alteration in the way the services interpreted their\r\npolicies of equal treatment and opportunity. In the end it would prove\r\neasier for the services to attack the gaudier but ultimately less\r\ncomplicated problems outside their gates.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-1: For discussion of charges of\r\n                   discrimination within the services, see Ltrs, ASD\r\n                   (M) to Congressman Charles C.

Defense Department officials were aware,\r\nfor example, that decent housing open to black servicemen was scarce.\r\nWith limited income, under military orders, and often forced by\r\ncircumstances to reside in the civilian community, black servicemen\r\nwere, in the words of Robert S. McNamara, President Kennedy's\r\nSecretary of Defense, \"singularly defenseless against this\r\nbigotry.\"[20-2] While the services had always denied responsibility\r\nfor combating this particular form of discrimination, many in the\r\nblack community were anxious to remind them of John F. Kennedy's claim\r\nin the presidential campaign of 1960 that discrimination in housing\r\ncould be alleviated with a stroke of the Chief Executive's pen.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-2: Robert S. McNamara, _The Essence of\r\n                   Security_ (New York: Harper & Row, 1972), p. 124.]\r\n\r\nBut housing was only part of a larger pattern of segregation that\r\nincluded restrictions on black servicemen's use of many places of\r\npublic accommodation such as restaurants, theaters, and saloons, some\r\nliterally on the doorstep of military reservations. James Evans listed\r\nsome twenty-seven military installations in the United States where in\r\n1961 segregation in transportation and places of public accommodation\r\nwas established in adjacent communities by law or custom.[20-3]\r\nMoreover, instances of blatant Jim Crow tactics were rapidly\r\nmultiplying near bases in Japan, Germany, the Philippines, and\r\nelsewhere as host communities began to adopt the prejudices of their\r\nvisitors.[20-4] The United States Commission on Civil Rights charged\r\nthat black servicemen were often reluctant to complain to their\r\nsuperiors or the Inspector General because of the repeated failure of\r\nlocal commands to show concern for the problem and suspicion that\r\ncomplainers would be subjected to reprisals.[20-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-3: James C.

Diggs,     (p. 503)\r\nJr., did not share this hope. Citing numerous examples for the\r\nPresident of discrimination against black servicemen, he charged that,\r\nfar from influencing local communities to change, commanders actually\r\ncooperated in discrimination by punishing or otherwise identifying\r\nprotesting servicemen as troublemakers.[20-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-6: Memo, ASD (M) for Asst Legal Counsel\r\n                   to President, 7 Nov 61, sub: Racial Discrimination\r\n                   in the Armed Services, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-7: See transcribed taped interviews\r\n                   conducted by Nichols of the UPI with military and\r\n                   civilian personnel in the Charleston, S.C., area in\r\n                   March 1963, copies in the James C.

Kennedy poses with (from left) Martin Luther King,\r\nJr., Roy Wilkins, Whitney M. Young, Jr., and A. Philip Randolph._]\r\n\r\nEspecially galling to civil rights leaders was the conviction that the\r\narmed forces had set up artificial and self-imposed barriers to a\r\nneeded social reform. In the end this conviction seemed to spur them\r\non. The American Veterans Committee, for example, demanded that when a\r\ncommunity \"mistreats American troops, such as in Montgomery, Alabama,\r\nor flaunts its Ku Klux Klan membership, as does Selma, Alabama, the\r\nentire area should be placed 'off limits' to purchases by Defense\r\ninstallations and by Servicemen.\"[20-9] Others were convinced that the\r\nfederal government was in effect supporting segregation through its\r\nwidespread economic assistance programs to state and local governments\r\nand to private institutions in the fields of employment, housing,\r\neducation, health service, military affairs, and agriculture. In\r\nAugust 1961 a group of fifty civil rights leaders petitioned the   (p. 504)\r\nPresident to end such federal support.[20-10] On a more modest scale,\r\nthe Congress of Racial Equality asked the Army in August 1962 to\r\ndeclare segregated restaurants in Aberdeen, Maryland, off limits to\r\nall military personnel. The activist group justified its demand by\r\nstating that \"the Army declares dangerous or immoral establishments\r\noff limits to soldiers and what is more dangerous or immoral in a\r\ndemocracy than racial intolerance?\"[20-11] In this they failed to\r\ndistinguish between the commander's proper response to what was\r\nillegal, for example prostitution, and what was still legal, for\r\nexample, segregated housing.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-9: American Veterans Committee, \"Audit of\r\n                   Negro Veterans and Servicemen,\" 1960, p. 16, copy\r\n                   in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-10: Leadership Conference on Civil\r\n                   Rights, \"Proposals for Executive Action to End\r\n                   Federally Supported Segregation and Other Forms of\r\n                   Racial Discrimination,\" August 1961, copy in SD\r\n                   291.2.

Highly trained in modern\r\nmanagerial techniques, Robert S. McNamara came to the Pentagon with\r\nthe idea of instituting a series of fundamental changes in the\r\nmanagement of the armed forces through manpower reorganization and\r\nwhat was becoming known as systems analysis. Whatever his attitude\r\ntoward racial justice, his initial interest in the Defense\r\nDepartment's black employees, military and civilian, was closely\r\nlinked to his concern for military efficiency. Less than a week on the\r\njob, he called for information on the status of Negroes in the\r\ndepartment. He had heard that some services were better integrated\r\nthan others, and he wanted his Assistant Secretary for Manpower to\r\ninvestigate. He wanted to know if there was a \"fair\" proportion of\r\nNegroes in the higher civilian grades. If not, he asked, \"what do you\r\nrecommend be done about it?\"[20-12] These questions, and indeed all\r\naction on civil rights matters originating in his office in the months\r\nto come, indicated that McNamara, like his predecessors, would limit\r\nhis reforms to discrimination within the services themselves. But as\r\ntime passed, McNamara, like President Kennedy, would warm to the civil\r\nrights cause and eventually both would become firmly committed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-12: Memo, SecDef for ASD (MP&R)\r\n                   Designate, 27 Jan 61, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe Kennedy administration has been closely identified with civil\r\nrights, yet the President's major biographers and several of his\r\nassistants agree that his commitment to civil rights reform did not\r\nemerge full-blown on inauguration day. It was only in the last months\r\nof his administration that Kennedy, subjected to civil rights demands\r\nand sharing the interests and experiences of his brother Robert,\r\nthe Attorney General, threw himself wholeheartedly into the civil  (p. 505)\r\nrights fray.[20-13] As senator and later as President, Kennedy was\r\nsympathetic to the aspirations of the black minority, appreciated its\r\nsupport in his campaign, but regarded civil rights as one, and not the\r\nmost pressing, problem facing the Chief Executive. Even his\r\nadministrations's use of federal marshals during the freedom rides in\r\n1961 and its use of both marshals and troops at Oxford, Mississippi,\r\nin 1962 and troops again in Alabama in 1963 were justified in the name\r\nof enforcement of federal judicial processes. Well into 1963 he\r\nstudiously downplayed the civil rights issues involved.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-13: This discussion of Kennedy's civil\r\n                   rights position is based on Arthur M.

To urge it on an\r\nunwilling Congress would only jeopardize his legislative program,\r\nincrease the black minority's feeling of frustration, and divide the\r\nnation in a period of national crisis. Discussing the Civil Rights\r\nCommission's \"non-negotiable\" demands concerning the organized\r\nreserves, for example, commission member Father Theodore Hesburgh\r\nremembered the President saying:\r\n\r\n     Look, I have a serious problem in West Berlin, and I do not think\r\n     this is the proper time to start monkeying around with the\r\n     Army.... I have no problem with the principle of this, and we'll\r\n     certainly be doing it, but at this precise moment I have to keep\r\n     uppermost in mind that I may need these units ... and I can't\r\n     have them in the midst of a social revolution while I'm trying to\r\n     do this.[20-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-14: Quoted from O'Connor's oral history\r\n                   interview with Hesburgh, 27 Mar 66.]\r\n\r\nKennedy temporized. He would promptly and positively endorse the\r\nprinciple of equal rights and enforce the civil rights decisions of\r\nthe Supreme Court through negotiation, moral suasion, executive order,\r\nand, when necessary, through the use of federal marshals.[20-15] The\r\nJustice Department meanwhile would pursue a vigorous course of\r\nlitigation to insure the franchise for Negroes from which, he\r\nbelieved, all civil blessings flowed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-15: For a critical interpretation of the\r\n                   Kennedy approach to enforcing the Court's\r\n                   decisions, see Navasky's _Kennedy Justice_, pp.\r\n                   97-98, and Howard Zinn, _Postwar America_,\r\n                   1945-1971 (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1973), ch.\r\n                   iv.]\r\n\r\nCivil rights was not mentioned in Kennedy's first State of the Union\r\nmessage. With the exception of a measure to outlaw literacy and poll\r\ntax requirements for voting, no civil rights bills were sent to the\r\nEighty-seventh Congress. Yet at one of his first press conferences,\r\nthe President told newsmen that a plan to withhold federal funds in\r\ncertain segregation cases would be included in a general study \"of\r\nwhere the Federal Government might usefully place its power and\r\ninfluence to expand civil rights.\"[20-16] On 6 March 1961 he signed\r\nExecutive Order 10925, which combined the committees on government (p. 506)\r\ncontracts and employment policy into a single Committee on Equal\r\nEmployment Opportunity chaired by the Vice President.[20-17] His\r\norder, he believed, specified sanctions \"sweeping enough to ensure\r\ncompliance.\"[20-18] Finally, in November 1962, after numerous and\r\nincreasingly pointed reminders from civil rights advocates, the\r\nPresident issued Executive Order 11063, directing executive agencies\r\nto take action against discrimination in the sale or lease of federal\r\nhousing or any housing bought with loans from or insured by the\r\nfederal government.[20-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-16: Press Conference, 1 Mar 61, _Public\r\n                   Papers of the Presidents: John F.

Upon the recommendation of Special Assistant\r\nFrederick G. Dutton, the President created the Civil Rights Subcabinet\r\nGroup in March 1961 to coordinate the administration's civil rights\r\nactions. Under Dutton's chairmanship, this group included the\r\nassistant secretaries responsible for racial matters in their\r\nrespective agencies, with White House Special Civil Rights Assistant\r\nHarris Wofford serving as executive secretary.[20-20] The group\r\nregularly scrutinized the racial programs of the various departments,\r\ndemanding reports and investigations of racial matters and insuring\r\nthat the interests and criticisms of the administration were quickly\r\ndisseminated at the operations level of the federal agencies\r\naffected.[20-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-20: Memo, Frederick G.

The\r\n                   department's initial choice seems to have been\r\n                   Evans, but Wofford rejected this selection on the\r\n                   grounds that Evans's position did not place him in\r\n                   the department's power structure. He preferred to\r\n                   have Yarmolinsky or Assistant Secretary Carlisle P.\r\n                   Runge. Yarmolinsky insisted that Runge be included\r\n                   so that it would not appear that racial reform in\r\n                   the Department of Defense was a duty only for the\r\n                   administration's men.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-21: See Memo, ASD (M) for Under SA et\r\n                   al., 7 Nov 61, sub: Minority Representation in\r\n                   Officer Procurement and Training, ASD (M) 291.2.\r\n                   See also Memos, Wofford for Civil Rights Subcabinet\r\n                   Group, 15 Sep, 20 Oct, and 10 Nov 61, copies in\r\n                   CMH.]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the subcabinet group was responsible for\r\nconsiderable cross-fertilization of civil rights programs among the\r\ndepartments. For example, it appears to have used the experience of\r\nblack servicemen in interstate travel to move the Department of\r\nJustice and, with the assistance of Attorney General Kennedy,\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission toward eliminating such\r\ndiscrimination.[20-22] And it was through the subcabinet group that\r\nthe Attorney General's interest in minority voting rights was\r\ntranslated into a voting registration campaign among servicemen.[20-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-22: Memo for Rcd, James C.

Copies of all in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of this group, with its surveys, questions, and      (p. 507)\r\ninvestigations, put constant pressure on the armed services. They were\r\nnot singled out for special treatment, but they obviously attracted\r\nthe attention of both the White House and the civil rights organizations\r\nbecause their commitment to equal treatment and opportunity affected\r\nso many people and their past successes and remaining problems were\r\nhaving a decided impact on American society. In the words of\r\npresidential assistant Wofford, the Defense Department was \"a world\r\nwithin itself,\" a world which by its magnitude could make a\r\n\"significant contribution by its example\" to the solution of the\r\nnation's racial problems.[20-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-24: Memo for Rcd, James C. Evans, 21 Jul\r\n                   61, sub: Meeting, Subcabinet Group on Civil Rights,\r\n                   Friday, July 21, 1961 (Judge Jackson represented\r\n                   Mr. Runge), ASD (M&P) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe size of the department's racial program alluded to by Wofford also\r\ninvited the attention of a federal agency outside White House control.\r\nThe United States Commission on Civil Rights was continually\r\ninvestigating the services, probing allegations of discrimination\r\nagainst black servicemen and evaluating the role of the department in\r\ncommunity race relations.[20-25] Of particular interest to an\r\nunderstanding of racial policy in the 1960's is the commission's\r\ncomprehensive survey, titled \"The Services and Their Relations with\r\nthe Community,\" which concluded that the continued existence of\r\ncommunity discrimination against servicemen and their dependents had a\r\ndetrimental effect on the morale and efficiency of significant numbers\r\nof them. The commission cataloged the traditional alibis of military\r\ncommanders: \"it is not the mission of the services to concern\r\nthemselves with the practices of the local community\"; the commander's\r\nresponsibility \"stops at the gate\"; harmonious relations with the\r\ncommunity must be maintained; and, finally, in order to achieve\r\nharmony, servicemen must comply with local laws and customs. Yet when\r\nit came to other areas of community relations, particularly where the\r\ngeneral health, welfare, and morale of the servicemen were involved,\r\nthe commission found that commanders did not hesitate to ally\r\nthemselves with servicemen, local community controversy and opposition\r\nnotwithstanding. The commission wanted the services to take a similar\r\nstand against racial discrimination in the community. Although its\r\nspecific recommendations differed little from those of civil rights\r\nleaders, its position as an independent federal agency and its access\r\nto the news media added a constant and special pressure on the\r\nservices.[20-26]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-25: See, for example, Ltr, Chmn,\r\n                   Commission on Civil Rights, to SecDef, 26 Mar 62;\r\n                   Memo, ASD (M) for Under SA et al., 7 May 62, sub:\r\n                   Survey, United States Commission on Civil Rights;\r\n                   Memo, Under SecNav for ASD (M), 25 May 62, sub:\r\n                   United States Commission on Civil Rights Survey of\r\n                   the Department of Defense; Ltr, Yarmolinsky to Berl\r\n                   I.

Various\r\npresidential assistants subjected the services' reports on progress in\r\nthe equal opportunity field to unprecedented scrutiny, asking\r\nquestions that forced the Defense Department to explain or justify its\r\nracial policies and practices.[20-27] In March 1961, civil rights\r\nassistants on the President's staff inquired about the number of   (p. 508)\r\nNegroes on the Defense Department's military and civilian screening\r\nboards.[20-28] Later, Special Assistant Frank D. Reeves inquired about\r\nthe employees working in the executive area of the department and\r\nsuggested that the front offices do something about hiring more black\r\noffice workers.[20-29] And again as a result of a number of questions\r\nraised about the Navy's race policy, presidential assistant Wofford\r\nsponsored a White House meeting on 18 September 1961 for several civil\r\nrights representatives and Adam Yarmolinsky, Special Assistant to the\r\nSecretary of Defense, with the Chief of Naval Personnel, Vice Adm.\r\nWilliam R. Smedberg. Beginning with Yarmolinsky's probing questions\r\nconcerning the perennial problem of racial composition of the\r\nSteward's Branch, the meeting evolved into a general review of the\r\nNavy's recent problems and achievements in race relations.[20-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-27: For examples of DOD reports submitted\r\n                   to the White House on this subject, see Memo, ASD\r\n                   (M) for Harris Wofford, 15 Nov 61, and idem for\r\n                   Frank D.

He was concerned with the allegation,\r\ncategorically denied by the Defense Department, that black servicemen\r\nwith school-aged dependents were being moved off bases to avoid\r\nintegrating base schools. He wanted a prompt investigation. Dutton was\r\nimpatient with the Navy's explanation for the continuing predominance\r\nof Negroes in the Steward's Branch, and he was especially critical of\r\nthe racial situation in the National Guard. He wanted a progress\r\nreport on these points. Finally, he was unhappy with the lack of\r\nNegroes in officer training, an executive area, he claimed, in which\r\ncivilian agencies were forging ahead. He wanted something done about\r\nthat also.[20-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-31: Composed of representatives of some\r\n                   fifty civil rights groups under the chairmanship of\r\n                   Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, the Leadership Conference\r\n                   on Civil Rights presented to President Kennedy a\r\n                   list of proposals for executive action to end\r\n                   federally supported segregation.

John Kennedy rarely intervened but he\r\ndid so on occasion quickly and decisively and in a way illustrative of\r\nhis administration's civil rights style. He acted promptly, for\r\nexample, when he noticed an all-white unit from the Coast Guard\r\nAcademy marching in his inaugural parade. His call to the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury Douglas Dillon on inauguration night led to the admission\r\nof the first black students to the Coast Guard Academy. He elaborated\r\non the incident during his first cabinet meeting, asking each      (p. 509)\r\ndepartment head to analyze the minority employment situation in his\r\nown department. He was also upset to see \"few, if any\" black honor\r\nguardsmen in the units that greeted visiting Ghanian President Kwame\r\nNkrumah on 13 March, an observation not lost on Secretary McNamara.\r\n\"Would it be possible,\" the new defense chief asked his manpower\r\nassistant, \"to introduce into these units a reasonable number of negro\r\npersonnel?\"[20-33] An immediate survey revealed that Negroes accounted\r\nfor 14 percent of the Air Force honor unit, 8 percent of the Army's,\r\nand 2.2 percent of the Marines Corps'.

Despite a reputation for\r\nfoot-dragging in some quarters--Deputy Secretary Roswell L. Gilpatric\r\nadmitted that neither he nor McNamara was especially interested in\r\npersonnel matters and that some of their early appointments in the\r\npersonnel field were inappropriate--[20-37]the secretary and his\r\nassistants issued a spate of directives and policy memorandums and\r\ninaugurated a whole series of surveys and investigations. Yarmolinsky\r\nwas later able to recall eleven major papers produced by the\r\nsecretary's office during the first thirty months of McNamara's\r\nincumbency. Evans's more comprehensive list of actions taken by the\r\noffice of the secretary's manpower assistant with regard to equal\r\nopportunity contained some forty items.[20-38] These totals did not\r\ninclude 1,717 racial complaints the Defense Department investigated\r\nand adjudicated before September 1963 nor the scores of contract\r\ncompliance reviews conducted under the equal opportunity clauses in\r\ndefense contracts.[20-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-37: Interv, Dennis O'Brien with Roswell\r\n                   L.

Many concerned the recruitment of Negroes and the increase in\r\ntheir proportion of the military establishment. Others pertained to\r\noff-base matters, ranging from prohibitions against the use of\r\nsegregated facilities during field exercises to the use of military\r\nunits in ceremonies and shows involving segregated audiences.\r\nContinued segregation in the reserves, the racial policies of\r\nthe United Services Organization, and even the racial rule of      (p. 511)\r\nmorticians who dealt with the services came in for attention.\r\n\r\nYet if these investigations and directives bespoke a quickened tempo\r\nin the fight for equal treatment and opportunity in the armed forces,\r\nthey did not herald a substantive reinterpretation of policy. The\r\nDefense Department continued to limit its actions to matters obviously\r\nand directly within its purview. The same self-imposed restriction\r\nthat kept McNamara's immediate predecessors from dealing with the most\r\npressing demands for reforms by black servicemen and the civil rights\r\nleaders continued to be observed. This fact was especially clear in\r\nthe case of the Defense Department's four major policy pronouncements\r\ninvolving the complex problem of discrimination visited upon\r\nservicemen and their dependents outside the gates of the military\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discrimination Off the Military Reservation_\r\n\r\nIn the first of these directives, which was derived from President\r\nKennedy's executive order on equal employment opportunity,[20-40]\r\nSecretary McNamara laid down that no departmental facility could be\r\nused by employee recreational organizations that practiced racial or\r\nreligious discrimination. Included were facilities financed from\r\nnonappropriated funds as well as all organizations to which civilian\r\nas well as military personnel belonged.[20-41] A straightforward\r\nenough commitment to a necessary racial reform, the secretary's order\r\ncould by logical extension also be viewed as carrying the department's\r\nfight against racial discrimination into the civilian community. Yet\r\nprecisely because of these implications, the directive was subjected\r\nto later clarification. Official interpretation revealed that\r\nsecretarial rhetoric aside, the Department of Defense was not yet\r\nready to involve civilians in its equality crusade.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-40: The Office of the Secretary of\r\n                   Defense also issued several other statements\r\n                   implementing sections of Executive Order 10925; see\r\n                   DOD Dir 1125.4, 2 Jan 62, and OSD Admin Instr No.\r\n                   31, 13 July 62, both in SD files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-41: Memo, SecDef for Secys of Military\r\n                   Departments et al., 28 Apr 61, sub: Military and\r\n                   Civilian Employee Recreational Organizations, copy\r\n                   in ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe problem emerged when the commander of Maxwell Air Force Base, in\r\nkeeping with his reading of the McNamara order, prohibited the use of\r\nMaxwell's dining halls for a segregated luncheon of the American\r\nLegion's Boys' State and its playing fields for the segregated Maxwell\r\nLittle League teams. Assistant Secretary Runge quickly reassured\r\nSenator Lister Hill of Alabama that the 28 April order was limited to\r\nemployee organizations and so informed the Under Secretary of the Air\r\nForce.[20-42] But a further clarification and, in effect, a further\r\nrestriction of the department's policy in discrimination cases was\r\nissued when the Civil Rights Commission became interested in the case.\r\n\"If these activities are not covered by the April 28 directive,\" the\r\ncommission's staff director-designate wanted to know, \"what is the\r\nposition of the Department of Defense on them?\"[20-43] Runge's     (p. 512)\r\nresponse, cleared through Special Assistant Yarmolinsky, was hardly\r\nreassuring to the commission. The department did not inquire into the\r\nracial rules of private organizations that used departmental\r\nfacilities, Runge explained, nor did it object when its departmentally\r\nsponsored teams and groups played or performed with segregated private\r\nrecreational groups.[20-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-42: Ltr, Runge to Hill, 14 Jun 61; Memo,\r\n                   Runge for Under SecAF, 28 Jan 61, sub: Military and\r\n                   Civilian Employee Recreational Organizations both\r\n                   in ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-43: Ltr, Bernhard to Runge, 6 Jul 61, ASD\r\n                   (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-44: Ltr, Runge to Bernhard, 17 Jul 61,\r\n                   with attached Handwritten Note, signed SSJ [Stephen\r\n                   Jackson], 13 Jul 61, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nWith the effect of a stone dropped into water, the implications of the\r\nanti-discrimination memorandum continued to ripple outward. The\r\ncommander of Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, canceled the sale of\r\nsubsidized tickets to the Mobile Bears baseball games by the base's\r\ncivilian welfare council on the grounds that the ball park's\r\nsegregated seating of Air Force personnel violated the secretary's\r\norder. Inquiries from Capitol Hill set off another round of\r\nclarifications.[20-45] While the secretary's manpower advisers were\r\ninclined to support the base commander's action, some of the\r\ndepartment's legal advisers had reservations. Canceling the sale of\r\ntickets, a lawyer in the general counsel's office noted, was\r\nconsistent with one construction of the secretary's memorandum but was\r\nnot the \"inevitable interpretation\" since it was the ball club and not\r\nthe Air Force recreational organization that discriminated.[20-46]\r\nAnother departmental lawyer warned that if the commander's\r\ninterpretation was sustained the department would next have to\r\nprohibit welfare groups from selling unsubsidized tickets to events\r\nwhere the seating or even perhaps the performers themselves were\r\nsegregated.[20-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-45: Ltr, Hill to Runge, 26 Jul 61; Memo,\r\n                   ASD (M) for SecAF, 25 Sep 61, sub: Purchase and\r\n                   Sale of Baseball Tickets at Brookley AFB; both in\r\n                   ASD (M) 353.8.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-46: Memo, R.C.

Although the sale of tickets did\r\nnot technically violate Executive Order 10925, the department's\r\nsponsorship and subsidy of segregated events, he said, \"is, in our\r\nopinion, not consonant with the clear intent of the President's\r\nmemorandum.\"[20-48] Yarmolinsky suggested the White House might want\r\nto consider proposing to the ball club that the air base would resume\r\nthe sale of tickets if it could sell a block of unsegregated seats.\r\nThe White House reply was postponed until after the passage of the\r\nforeign aid bill, but the Air Force eventually received notice to\r\nproceed along these lines.[20-49]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-48: Memo, Yarmolinsky for Dutton, 4 Aug\r\n                   61, sub: President's Memorandum of 18 April 1961,\r\n                   ASD (M) 291.2 (22 May 61).]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-49: Note, signed, \"MB,\" 16 Aug 61, sub:\r\n                   Call From Virginia McGuire, attached to Draft Ltr,\r\n                   ASD (M) to Sen.

This one ostensibly dealt with the availability of\r\nintegrated community facilities for servicemen, but was in fact far\r\nwider in scope, and brought the department nearer the uncharted    (p. 513)\r\nshoals of community race relations. A testament to the extraordinary\r\npolitical sensitivity of the subject was the long time the document\r\nspent in the drafting stage. Its wording incorporated the suggestions\r\nof representatives of the three service secretaries and was carefully\r\nreviewed by the President's civil rights advisers, who wanted the\r\ndraft shown to the President \"because of his particular interest in\r\nCivil Rights matters.\"[20-50] With their request in mind, and because\r\nof what he considered \"the tense situation now existent in the South,\"\r\nRunge urged the secretary to send the President the memorandum. Before\r\ndoing so McNamara asked his general counsel, Cyrus R. Vance, to\r\ndiscuss the draft with the under secretaries of the services and\r\nAssistant Attorney General Nicholas B. Katzenbach and Burke Marshall.\r\nAt the suggestion of the justice officials, the draft was slightly\r\nrevised; then it was sent once again to the services for review.\r\nFinally on 19 June 1961, and only after Yarmolinsky had rejected\r\ncertain minor alterations suggested by the services, was the\r\nmemorandum issued under Gilpatric's signature and its provisions\r\npassed down to the local commanders by the service secretaries.[20-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-50: Memo, ASD (M) for SecDef, 22 May 61,\r\n                   sub: Availability of Facilities to Military\r\n                   Personnel, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-51: Memo, Dep SecDef for Service Secys,\r\n                   19 Jun 61, sub: Availability of Facilities to\r\n                   Military Personnel, SD 291.2.

In the first place the title, The\r\nAvailability of Facilities to Military Personnel, was vague, a legacy\r\nof the department's fear of congressional retaliation for any\r\nsubstantive move in the politically sensitive area of race relations.\r\nActually the secretary's office was primarily concerned with\r\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation such as swimming\r\npools, recreational facilities, meeting halls, and the like while the\r\nexplosive subject of off-base housing was ignored. Although the\r\norder's ambiguity did not preclude initiatives in the housing field by\r\nsome zealous commanders, neither did it oblige any commander to take\r\nany specific action, thus providing a convenient excuse for no action\r\nat all.[20-52] Commanders, for example, were ordered to provide\r\nintegrated facilities off post for servicemen \"to the extent\r\npossible,\" a significant qualification in areas where such facilities\r\nwere not available in the community. Commanders were also \"expected to\r\nmake every effort\" to obtain integrated facilities off base through\r\nthe good offices of their command-community relations committees. In\r\neffect the department was asking its commanders to achieve through\r\ntact what the courts and the Justice Department were failing to\r\nachieve through legal process.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-52: Interv, author with James C. Evans,\r\n                   15 Nov 72, CMH files.]\r\n\r\nWhere the order was specific, it carefully limited the extent of\r\nreforms. It barred the use of military police in the enforcement of\r\nlocal segregation laws, a positive step but a limited reform since\r\nonly in very rare instances had military police ever been so employed.\r\nThe order also provided \"as circumstances warranted\" for legal\r\nassistance to servicemen to insure that they were afforded due\r\nprocess of law in cases growing out of the enforcement of local    (p. 514)\r\nsegregation ordinances. Again what seemed a broad commitment and\r\nextensive interference with local matters was in practice very\r\ncarefully circumscribed, as demonstrated by the Air Force policy\r\nstatement issued in the wake of the secretary's order.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force announced that in the case of discrimination in the\r\ncommunity, the local Air Force commander and his staff judge advocate\r\nwould interview the aggrieved serviceman to ascertain the facts and\r\nadvise him of his legal recourses, \"but will neither encourage nor\r\ndiscourage the filing of a criminal complaint.\" The purpose of the\r\npolicy, the Air Force Chief of Staff explained, was to assist\r\nservicemen and at the same time avoid disrupting good community\r\nrelations. The commander should remain interested, but he should leave\r\nthe work to his judge advocate so that the commander would not\r\npersonally be \"caught in the middle\" to the detriment of his community\r\nrelations program. If local authorities refused to cooperate, the\r\nmatter should be referred to higher authority who might pursue it with\r\nlocal government officials. Such procedures might keep the commander\r\nfrom becoming embroiled in locally sensitive issues.[20-53] In short,\r\ndiscrimination was to be fought through voluntary action at the local\r\ncommand level, but nothing was to be done that might compromise the\r\ncommander's standing with the local authorities.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-53: Memo, Maj Gen Albert M.

The secretary had inherited\r\na policy from his predecessor who, in the wake of a series of sit-in\r\ndemonstrations involving black airmen in the spring of 1960, had\r\napproved a plan devised by the judge advocate generals of the services\r\nand other Defense Department officials. Declaring such activity\r\n\"inappropriate\" in light of the services' mission, these officials\r\nbanned the participation of servicemen in civil rights demonstrations\r\nand gave local commanders broad discretionary powers to prevent such\r\nparticipation, including the right to declare the place of\r\ndemonstration off limits or to restrict servicemen to the base.\r\nAlthough all the services adopted the new policy, only the Air Force\r\npublished detailed instructions.[20-54]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-54: Memo for Rcd, ASD (P), 23 Mar 60;\r\n                   Memo, Dep Chief, NavPers, for Asst SecNav (Pers and\r\n                   Reserve Forces), 23 Mar 60, sub: Considerations\r\n                   Relative to Department of Defense Policy Concerning\r\n                   Disputes Over Local Laws or Customs; copies of both\r\n                   in ASD (M) 291.2.

Such was the case\r\nduring a series of sit-ins at Killeen, Texas, near the Army's Fort\r\nHood, where, as reported in the national press and subsequently\r\ninvestigated by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, the\r\ncommander used military police to break up two demonstrations.[20-55]\r\nThe secretary's office reacted quickly to the incidents. A         (p. 515)\r\nprohibition against the use of military police to quell civil rights\r\ndemonstrations was quickly included in the secretary's policy\r\nstatement, The Availability of Facilities to Military Personnel, then\r\nbeing formulated. \"This memorandum,\" Assistant Secretary Runge assured\r\nMcNamara, \"should preclude any further such incidents.\"[20-56] In\r\nspecific reference to the situation in the Fort Hood area, the Deputy\r\nUnder Secretary of the Army reported that as a result of a new policy\r\nand the emphasis placed on personal contact by commanders with local\r\ncommunity representatives, \"a cordial relationship now exists between\r\nFort Hood and the surrounding communities.\"[20-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-55: Memo, ASD (M) for SecDef, 18 Jul 61,\r\n                   sub: Use of Military Police to Halt Sit-ins as\r\n                   Reported by Drew Pearson's Column of July 19 in the\r\n                   Washington Post; Ltr, U.S. Commission on Civil\r\n                   Rights Staff Dir Designate to ASD (M), 26 Jul 61;\r\n                   both in ASD (M) 291.2.

Significantly, the much-heralded memorandum on the\r\navailability of integrated facilities failed to review the rules\r\ngoverning participation in demonstrations, a subject of pressing\r\ninterest to an increasing number of Negroes as the civil rights\r\nstruggle moved into a more active phase. Bothered by this failure, Air\r\nForce representatives on the policy drafting team had wanted to\r\nprovide local commanders with guidance before civil rights incidents\r\noccurred. The justice officials who reviewed the memorandum at\r\nMcNamara's invitation, however, were reluctant to see specific\r\nreference to such incidents incorporated, and the matter was\r\nignored.[20-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-58: Memo, Vance and Runge for SecDef, 5\r\n                   Jun 61, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, justice officials were not the only ones reluctant to see the\r\nissue raised. It was a common belief in the Defense Department that\r\nmilitary service placed some limitations on a man's basic liberties.\r\nBecause servicemen were assigned to their duty station, subject to\r\nimmediate transfers and on duty twenty-four hours a day, they were\r\nallowed no opportunity for participating in demonstrations.[20-59] The\r\ndepartment's general counsel was even more specific, saying that a\r\nprohibition against picketing would not conflict with the department's\r\nanti-discrimination policies and could be lawfully imposed by the\r\nservices. \"Indeed,\" he believed, \"the role of the military\r\nestablishment in our society required the imposition of such a\r\nlimitation on the off-duty activities of service personnel.\"[20-60]\r\nBlessed by such authority, the 1960 prohibition against participation\r\nin civil rights demonstrations remained in effect for more than three\r\nyears.[20-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-59: Ltr, ASD (M) to John de J.

Given the civil      (p. 516)\r\nrights temper of the times--1963 witnessed the mammoth march on\r\nWashington, the introduction of President Kennedy's civil rights bill,\r\nand the landmark directive of the Secretary of Defense on equal\r\nopportunity in the armed forces--a total prohibition on servicemen's\r\nparticipation in demonstrations appeared more and more incongruous.\r\nFinally, on 16 July 1963, McNamara relaxed the department's policy.\r\nStill declaring such participation inappropriate and unnecessary for\r\nservicemen in view of their \"special obligations of citizenship,\" he\r\nnevertheless lifted the ban on military participation in\r\ndemonstrations, provided that the uniform was not worn; such activity\r\ntook place during off-duty hours, off the military reservation, and\r\ndid not constitute a breach of law and order; and no violence was\r\nreasonably likely to result.[20-62]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-62: Memo, SecDef for Secys of Mil Depts\r\n                   et al., 16 Jul 63, SD files; see also New York\r\n                   _Times_, July 16, 17, 20, 22, 28, and 30, 1963.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MCNAMARA.]\r\n\r\nAgain an apparent liberalization of departmental racial policy\r\nactually promised very little change. First, the continuing\r\nprohibitions on participation in demonstrations were so broad and so\r\nvague that they could be interpreted to cover almost any civil rights\r\nactivity. Then, too, the secretary left the interpretation of his\r\norder to the judgment of local commanders, a dubious blessing in the\r\neyes of the civil libertarians and concerned servicemen in light of\r\nthe narrow constructions commanders had given recent Defense\r\nDepartment memorandums. Finally, the relaxation of the ban was\r\napplicable only to the continental United States. In response to a\r\nrequest for guidance from the European commander, the Joint Chiefs of\r\nStaff informed all overseas commanders that as guests of Allied\r\nnations, U.S. servicemen had no right to picket, demonstrate, or\r\notherwise participate in any act designed to \"alter the policies,\r\npractices, or activities of the local inhabitants who are operating\r\nwithin the framework of their own laws.\"[20-63]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-63: Msg, USCINCEUR to JCS, 201256Z Aug\r\n                   63; Msg, JCS 2190 to CINSCO et al.

Racial\r\ndiscrimination in off-base housing had become perhaps the chief\r\ncomplaint of black servicemen who were further incensed by many    (p. 517)\r\nlocal commanders who maintained lists of segregated houses in their\r\nbase housing offices. In some cases commanders referred their black\r\nservicemen to the Urban League or similar organizations for help in\r\nfinding suitable housing.[20-64] Demands that the services do\r\nsomething about the situation were rebuffed. As the Assistant\r\nSecretary of Defense explained to a White House official, the\r\nDepartment of Defense had \"virtually no direct involvement\" in\r\noff-base housing, the segregation of which was \"not readily\r\nsusceptible to change by actions that are within the control of the\r\nmilitary departments.\"[20-65]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-64: Omaha _World Herald_, August 17,\r\n                   1962; see also Memo, Adam [Yarmolinsky] for L.\r\n                   White, 7 Sep 62, Lee White Collection, J.

They drafted a housing\r\norder for the secretary but not without opposition at first from some\r\nof their colleagues. An Army representative, for example, suggested a\r\ncounterproposal that commanders be ordered to work through the federal\r\nagencies established in various geographical areas of the country by\r\nExecutive Order 11063. An Air Force spokesman recommended the creation\r\nof special regional and local community committees, chaired by\r\nrepresentatives of the Housing and Home Finance Agency and including\r\nmembers from all major federal agencies. For his part, Stephen S.\r\nJackson, a special assistant in the manpower office, thought these\r\nservice proposals had merit, and he wanted to postpone action until\r\nthey had been discussed with other interested federal agencies.[20-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-66: Memo, Jackson for Dep ASD, Family\r\n                   Housing-OASD (I&L), 8 Feb 63, sub: Implementation\r\n                   of EX 11063, Equal Opportunity in Housing, copy in\r\n                   CMH.]\r\n\r\nMcNamara, however, \"readily agreed\" with his housing experts that a\r\nletter on nondiscrimination in family housing was necessary. On 8\r\nMarch 1963 he informed the service secretaries that effective\r\nimmediately all military leases for family housing, that is, contracts\r\nfor private housing rented by the services for servicemen, would\r\ncontain a nondiscrimination clause in accordance with the President's\r\nexecutive order. He also ordered military bases to maintain listings\r\nonly on nonsegregated private housing.[20-67] Again an attempt to\r\nbring about a needed change was severely limited in effectiveness by\r\nthe department's concern for the scope of the commander's authority in\r\nthe local community. The application of the President's order would\r\nend segregation in leased housing, but only a small percentage of\r\nblack servicemen lived in such housing. The majority of service\r\nfamilies lived off base in private housing, which the new order,\r\nexcept for banning the listing of segregated properties by base\r\nhousing offices, ignored. Barring the use of segregated private\r\nhousing to all servicemen, a more direct method of changing the racial\r\npattern surrounding military installations, would have to wait for a\r\nsubstantive change in departmental thinking.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-67: Memo, SecDef for SA et al., 8 Mar 63,\r\n                   sub: Non-Discrimination in Family Housing; Memo,\r\n                   ASD (I&L) for Dep ASD (Family Housing), 8 Mar 63;\r\n                   copies of both in ASD (M) 291.2.

A          (p. 518)\r\nparticularly sensitive issue to the services, which in the public mind\r\nhad complete jurisdiction over all men in uniform, was the position of\r\nthe Negro in the reserve components. To generalize on the racial\r\npolicies of the fifty-four National Guard organizations is difficult,\r\nbut whereas some state guards had been a progressive force in the\r\nintegration of the services in the early postwar period, others had\r\nbecome symbols of racism by 1961. Some fourteen years after the Truman\r\norder, ten states with large black populations and understaffed guard\r\nunits still had no Negroes in the guard. The Kennedy administration\r\nwas not the first to wrestle with the problem of applying a single\r\nracial policy to both the regulars and the guard. It was aware that\r\ntoo much tampering with the politically influential and volatile guard\r\ncould produce an explosion. At the same time any appearance of\r\ntimidity courted antagonism from another quarter.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the new administration found itself criticized by\r\ncivil rights organizations, including the U.S. Commission on Civil\r\nRights, for not moving quickly against segregated National Guard\r\nunits.[20-68] A delegation from the NAACP's 1961 convention visited\r\nAssistant Secretary Runge in July and criticized--to the exclusion of\r\nall other subjects--discrimination in the National Guard. This group\r\nwanted the federal government to withhold funds from states that\r\ncontinued to bar black participation. Repeating the old claim that\r\nspecial federal-state relationships precluded direct action by the\r\nSecretary of Defense, Runge nevertheless promised the delegates a\r\nrenewed effort to provide equal opportunity. He also made a somewhat\r\nirrelevant reference to the recent experience of a black citizen in\r\nOklahoma who had secured admission to the state guard by a direct\r\nappeal to the governor.[20-69] How futile such appeals would be in\r\nsome states was demonstrated a week later when the Adjutant General of\r\nFlorida declared that since the guard was a volunteer organization and\r\nhis state had always drawn its members from among white citizens,\r\nFlorida was under no obligation to enlist black men.[20-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-68: See petitions signed by thousands of\r\n                   Negroes to the President demanding redress of\r\n                   grievances against the discriminatory practices of\r\n                   the National Guard, in White House Cen files, 1962,\r\n                   J.

The veterans group called on\r\nthe administration to use the threat of withdrawal of federal\r\nrecognition to alter guard practices.[20-71] The administration\r\nrefused. A policy of force might be acceptable for the active armed\r\nforces, but voluntary persuasion seemed more appropriate for the\r\nNational Guard. Enunciating what would become the Defense Department's\r\nposition on the National Guard through 1963, Runge declared that the\r\nfederal government had no legal authority to force integration on the\r\nguard when it was not serving in a federal status. Furthermore,    (p. 519)\r\nwithdrawal of federal recognition or withholding federal funds as a\r\nmeans of bringing about integration, though legally sound, would cause\r\nsome states to reject federal support and inactivate their units,\r\nthereby stripping the country of a portion of its military reserve and\r\ndamaging national security. Citing the progress being made by\r\npersuasion, Runge predicted that some recalcitrant states might in\r\ntime voluntarily move toward integration.[20-72] Noting instances of\r\nrecent progress and citing legal restrictions against forcing state\r\ncompliance, McNamara endorsed the policy of encouraging voluntary\r\ncompliance.[20-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-71: Ltr, Murray Gross, Chmn of the AVC,\r\n                   to SecDef, 22 Jun 61, SD 291.2.

A6589.]\r\n\r\nAlthough unauthorized, similar patterns of discrimination persisted in\r\nparts of the organized reserves. Reserve units had links with both the\r\nregular forces and the guard. Like the regulars, the reserve was\r\nlegally a creature of the federal government and subject to policies\r\nestablished by the Secretary of Defense. Moreover, the reserve drew\r\nmuch of its manpower from the pool of soldiers separating from active\r\nduty with a reserve obligation still to fulfill, and within some\r\nlimits the Defense Department could assign such men to units in a\r\nmanner that could influence the reserve's racial composition. But like\r\nthe guard, the reserve also had a distinct local flavor, serving\r\nalmost as a social club in some parts of the country. This\r\ncharacteristic was often an important factor in maintaining a unit at\r\nsatisfactory strength. Since segregation sometimes went hand in hand\r\nwith the clublike atmosphere, the services feared that a strong stand\r\non integration might cause a severe decline in the strength of some\r\nunits.[20-74] When the Army staff reviewed the situation in 1956,\r\ntherefore, it had not pressed for integration of all units, settling\r\ninstead for merely \"encouraging\" commanders to open their units to\r\nNegroes.[20-75]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-74: ACofS (Reserve Components) Summary\r\n                   Sheet, 11 Feb 57, sub: Race Issue in Armory Debate,\r\n                   copy in DCSPER 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-75: DCSPER Summary Sheet, 6 Apr 56, sub:\r\n                   Policy for Reserve Training Assignments of\r\n                   Obligated Non-Caucasian Personnel of the Ready\r\n                   Reserve Who Reside in Segregated Areas, DCSPER\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe move toward complete integration of the reserves was slow. In\r\n1956, for example, more than 75 percent of the Army's reserve units in\r\nsouthern states were still segregated. The other services followed a\r\nsimilar pattern; in 1962 more than 40 percent of all reserve units in\r\nthe country were white; the Army retained six all-black reserve units\r\nas well. Racial exclusion persisted in the Reserve Officers' Training\r\nCorps also, although here the fault was probably not so much a matter\r\nof reserve policy as the lingering segregation pattern in some state\r\nschool systems. At the same time, the reserves had more blacks in\r\nnondrill status than in drill status. In other words, more blacks were\r\nin reserve pools where, unassigned to specific units, they did not\r\nparticipate in active duty training. In 1962, some 75 percent of the\r\nblack reservists in the Army and Air Force, 85 percent in the Navy,\r\nand 38 percent in the Marine Corps were assigned to such pools. For\r\nmany reservists, paid drill status was desirable; apart from the money\r\nreceived for such active duty, they had the opportunity to gain    (p. 520)\r\ncredit toward retirement and pensions.\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Gilpatric reminded the services in April\r\n1962 that the Truman order applied to the reserves and called on the\r\nunder secretaries to integrate the all-black and all-white units \"as\r\nrapidly as is consistent with military effectiveness.\"[20-76] He also\r\nwanted a review of black assignments for the purpose of removing the\r\ndisproportionate number of Negroes in pools \"consistent with the\r\nmilitary requirements and the skills of the personnel involved.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-76: Memo, Dep SecDef for Under Secys, 3\r\n                   Apr 62, sub: Compliance With E.O. 9981 in the Army,\r\n                   Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Reserves, in SD\r\n                   files. The secretary's memo was distributed to the\r\n                   commands; see, for example, Memo, TAG for CINCARPAC\r\n                   et al., 15 May 62 (TAG 291.2/15 May 62).]\r\n\r\nA defense manpower team surveyed the reserves in November 1962. It\r\ntried to soften the obvious implication of its racial statistics by\r\npointing out that the all-black units were limited to two Army areas,\r\nand action had already been taken by the Third Army and Fourth Army\r\ncommanders to integrate the six units as soon as possible. The team\r\nalso announced initiation of a series of administrative safeguards\r\nagainst discrimination in the enlistment and assignment of men to\r\ndrilling units. As for the all-white units, the reviewers cautioned\r\nthat discrimination was not necessarily involved since Negroes\r\nconstituted a relatively small proportion of the strength of the\r\nreserves--4.8 percent of the Army, 4.4 percent of the Air Force, and\r\nan estimated 3.2 percent of the Navy. Furthermore, the data neither\r\nproved nor disproved allegations of discrimination since the degree to\r\nwhich individuals volunteered, the skills and aptitudes they\r\npossessed, and the needs of the services were all factors in the\r\nassignment and use of the men involved.[20-77]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-77: Office of the ASD (M), Review of\r\n                   Compliance With E.O. 9981 in the Army, Navy, Air\r\n                   Force, and Marine Corps Reserves, 7 Nov 62, copy in\r\n                   CMH.]\r\n\r\nPleas of an absence of legal authority in regard to the National Guard\r\nand generalized promises of racial reform in the reserves were not\r\ngoing to still the complaints of the civil rights organizations nor\r\ndiscourage the interest of their allies in the administration.\r\nClearly, the Department of Defense would be hearing more about race in\r\nthe reserve components in the months to come.\r\n\r\nThe sudden reemergence in the early 1960's of complaints of\r\ndiscrimination in the regular forces centered around a familiar\r\nlitany: the number of Negroes in some of the services still fell\r\nsignificantly short of the black percentage of the national\r\npopulation; and separate standards, favorable to whites, prevailed in\r\nthe promotion and assignment systems of all the services. There had to\r\nbe some discrimination involved, Congressman Diggs pointed out to the\r\nSecretary of the Air Force in July 1960. With extensive help from the\r\nservices, Diggs had been investigating servicemen's complaints for\r\nsome time. While his major concern remained the discrimination\r\nsuffered by black servicemen off base, he nevertheless concluded that\r\nthe service regulations developed in consultation with the Fahy\r\nCommittee more than a decade earlier had not been fully implemented\r\nand discriminatory practices existed \"in varying degrees\" at       (p. 521)\r\nmilitary installations around the world. Diggs admitted that a black\r\nserviceman might well charge discrimination to mask his failure to\r\ncompete successfully for a job or grade, but to accept such failures\r\nas a universal explanation for the disproportionate number of Negroes\r\nin the lower ranks and undesirable occupations was to accept as true\r\nthe canard that Negroes as a group were deficient. Diggs's conclusion,\r\nwhich he pressed upon the department with some notice in the press,\r\nwas that some black servicemen were being subtly but deliberately and\r\narbitrarily restricted to inferior positions because their military\r\nsuperiors exercised judgments based on racial considerations. These\r\njudgments, he charged, were inconsistent with the spirit of the Truman\r\norder.[20-78]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-78: Ltr, Diggs to SecAF, 7 Jul 60; see\r\n                   also Memo, Dir, AF Legis Liaison, for Spec Asst for\r\n                   Manpower, Personnel, and Reserve Forces, USAF, 14\r\n                   Jul 60, with attached Summary of Findings and\r\n                   Highlights of the Diggs Report Concerning Alleged\r\n                   Discriminatory Practices in the Armed Forces; both\r\n                   in SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nAt first glance the 1963 study of racial discrimination by the U.S.\r\nCommission on Civil Rights seemed to contradict Diggs's charges. The\r\ncommission concluded that taken as a whole the status of black\r\nservicemen had improved considerably since the Truman order. It noted\r\nthat black representation had remained relatively constant since the\r\nearly days of integration, 8.2 percent of the total, 9.2 percent of\r\nthe enlisted strength, and approached national population averages.\r\nThe percentage of black officers, 1.6 percent of all officers, while\r\nadmittedly low, had been rising steadily and compared favorably with\r\nthe number of black executives in the civilian economy. The\r\noccupational status of the black enlisted man had also undergone\r\nsteady improvement since the early days of integration, especially\r\nwhen one compared the number and variety of military occupation\r\nspecialties held by black servicemen with opportunities in the rest of\r\nthe civil service and the business community.\r\n\r\nFinally, and perhaps most important, the commission found that in\r\ntheir daily operations, military installations were \"generally free\r\nfrom the taint of racial discrimination.\"[20-79] It confirmed the\r\ngeneral assessments of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and\r\nthe American Veterans Committee among others, pointing out that black\r\nand white servicemen not only worked side by side, but also mingled in\r\noff-duty hours.[20-80] In sum, the study demonstrated general\r\nsatisfaction with the racial situation on military bases. Its major\r\nconcern, and indeed the major concern of Diggs and most black\r\nservicemen, remained the widespread discrimination prevailing against\r\nblack servicemen in the local community.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-79: U.S. Commission on _Civil Rights_,\r\n                   Civil Rights '63, pp. 173-85. The quotation is from\r\n                   page 185.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-80: See, for example, Morton Puner, \"The\r\n                   Armed Forces: An Integration Success Story,\"\r\n                   _Anti-Defamation League Bulletin_, Nov 62, pp. 3,\r\n                   7; and American Veterans Committee, \"Audit of Negro\r\n                   Veterans and Servicemen,\" 1960.]\r\n\r\nThese important generalizations aside, the commission nevertheless\r\noffered impressive statistical support for some of Diggs's charges\r\nwhen it investigated the diverse and conflicting enlistment and\r\nassignment patterns of the different services. The Navy and Marine\r\nCorps came in for special criticism. Even when the complexities of\r\nmental aptitude requirements and use of draftees versus enlistees  (p. 522)\r\nwere discounted, the commission found that these two services\r\nconsistently employed a significantly smaller percentage of Negroes\r\nthan the Army and Air Force. A similar disparity existed in assignment\r\nprocedures. The commission found that both services failed to match\r\nthe record of the civilian economy in the use of Negroes in technical,\r\nmechanical, administrative, clerical, and craft fields. It suspected\r\nthat the services' recruiting and testing methods intensified these\r\ndifferences and wondered whether they might not operate to exclude\r\nNegroes in some instances.\r\n\r\nDespite general approval of conditions on the bases, the commission\r\nfound what it called \"vestiges of discrimination on some bases.\" It\r\nreported some segregated noncommissioned officer clubs, some\r\nsegregated transportation of servicemen to the local community, and\r\nsome discriminatory employment patterns in the hiring of civilians for\r\npost jobs. Partly the legacy of the old segregated services, this\r\ndiscrimination, the commission concluded, was to a greater extent the\r\nresult of the intrusion of local civilian attitudes. The commission's\r\nattention to outside influences on attitudes at the base suggested\r\nthat it found the villain of the Diggs investigation, the prejudiced\r\nmilitary official, far too simplistic an explanation for what was in\r\nreality institutional racism, a complex mixture of sociological forces\r\nand military traditions acting on the services. The Department of\r\nDefense's manpower experts dwelt on these forces and traditions when\r\nthey analyzed recruitment, promotion, and assignment trends for\r\nMcNamara in 1963.[20-81]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-81: Memo, DepASD (Special Studies and\r\n                   Requirements) for ASD (M), 16 Jul 63, with\r\n                   attachment, Utilization of Negroes in the Armed\r\n                   Forces, July 1963, copy in CMH. All the tables\r\n                   accompanying this discussion are from the preceding\r\n                   source, with the exception of Table 16, which is\r\n                   from the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Policy\r\n                   Planning and Research, _The Negro Family: The Case\r\n                   for National Action_, Mar 64, p. 75, where it is\r\n                   reproduced from DOD sources.]\r\n\r\nThey found a general increase in black strength ratios between 1949\r\nand 1962 (_Table 13_). They blamed the \"selective\" recruiting\r\npractices in vogue before the Truman order for the low enlistment\r\nratios in 1949, just as they attributed the modest increases since\r\nthat time to the effects of the services' equal treatment and\r\nopportunity programs. In the judgment of these analysts, racial\r\ndifferences in representation since the Truman order, and indeed most\r\nof the other discrepancies between black and white servicemen, could\r\nusually be explained by the sometimes sharp difference in aptitude\r\ntest results (_Table 14_). A heritage of the Negro's limited, often\r\nsegregated and inferior education and his economic and related     (p. 523)\r\nenvironmental handicaps, low aptitude scores certainly explained the\r\ncontrast in disqualification rates (_Tables 15 and 16_). By 1962 fully\r\nhalf of all Negroes--as compared to 8 percent of all whites--failed to\r\nqualify for service under minimum mental test standards. In some\r\nsouthern states, the draftee rejection rate for Negroes exceeded 80\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nTable 13--Black Strength in the Armed Forces for Selected Years\r\n(In Percentage)\r\n\r\n         Army            Navy         Marine Corps      Air Force\r\n       Enlisted        Enlisted         Enlisted         Enlisted\r\n  Year   Men   Officers  Men   Officers   Men   Officers   Men   Officers\r\n\r\n  1949  12.4     1.8     4.7     0.0      2.1      0.0     5.1      0.6\r\n  1954  13.7     3.0     3.6     0.1      6.5      0.1     8.6      1.1\r\n  1962  12.2     3.2     5.2     0.2      7.6      0.2     9.2      1.2\r\n\r\nTable 14--Estimated Percentage Distribution of Draft-Age Males in U.S.\r\nPopulation by AFQT Groups (Based on Preinduction Examination, 1959-1962)\r\n\r\n  Group     White     Nonwhite\r\n  I         11.8         0.3\r\n  II        31.3         2.6\r\n  III       31.9        15.0\r\n  IV        19.0        40.1\r\n  V          6.0        42.0\r\n\r\nTable 15--Rate of Men Disqualified for Service in 1962\r\n(In Percentage)\r\n\r\n     Cause                White     Nonwhite\r\n  Medical and other        21.8       10.1\r\n  Mental test failure       8.4       50.6\r\n    Total                  30.2       60.7\r\n\r\nTable 16--Rejection Rates for Failure to Pass\r\n          Armed Forces Mental Test, 1962\r\n\r\n                                                     Failed Mental Test\r\n                                            Number\r\n                    Area                   Examined    Number   Percent\r\n  Grand total, Continental United States    286,152    64,536    22.6\r\n    Total, white                            235,678    36,204    15.4\r\n    Total, black                             50,474    28,332    56.1\r\n\r\n  First Army: Connecticut, Maine,\r\n    Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\r\n    New Jersey, New York, Rhode\r\n    Island, Vermont\r\n\r\n      White                                  49,171    12,989    26.4\r\n      Black                                   7,937     3,976    50.1\r\n\r\n  Second Army: Delaware, Washington,\r\n    D.C., Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio,\r\n    Pennsylvania, Virginia,\r\n    West Virginia\r\n\r\n      White                                  48,641     5,888    12.1\r\n      Black                                   9,563     4,255    44.5\r\n\r\n  Third Army: Alabama, Florida, Georgia,\r\n    Mississippi, North Carolina,\r\n    South Carolina, Tennessee\r\n\r\n      White                                  30,242     5,786    19.1\r\n      Black                                  20,343    13,772    67.7\r\n\r\n  Fourth Army: Arkansas, Louisiana,\r\n    New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas\r\n\r\n      White                                  15,048     2,039    13.5\r\n      Black                                   4,796     2,988    62.3\r\n\r\n  Fifth Army: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa,\r\n    Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,\r\n    Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota,\r\n    Wisconsin, Wyoming\r\n\r\n      White                                  51,117     4,495     8.9\r\n      Black                                   5,723     2,684    46.9\r\n\r\n  Sixth Army: Arizona, California, Idaho,         1         1       1\r\n    Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah,\r\n    Washington\r\n\r\n      White                                  41,459     5,007    12.1\r\n      Black                                   2,112       657    31.1\r\n\r\nThis problem became critical for black enlistments in the mid-1950's\r\nwhen the services, with less need for new servicemen, raised the\r\nmental standards for enlistees, denying Group IV men the right to\r\nenlist. (An exception to this pattern was the Navy's decision to\r\naccept Group IV enlistments in 1956 and 1957 to replace post-Korean\r\nenlistment losses.) In terms of total black representation, however,\r\nthe new mental standards made a lesser difference (_Table 17_).\r\nDenying Group IV men enlistment during the 1950's only increased their\r\nnumber in the draft pool, and when the Army stepped up draft\r\ninductions in the early 1960's the number of Group IV men in uniform,\r\nincluding Negroes, rapidly increased.\r\n\r\nTable 17--Nonwhite Inductions and First Enlistments, Fiscal Years\r\n1953-1962[1]\r\n\r\n  Fiscal | Total    |               Percent Nonwhite\r\n  Year   |Accessions| DOD|           Army       |Navy|Marine| Air\r\n         | (000)[1] |    |Inductees[2]|Enlistees|    |Corps |Force\r\n\r\n   1953      886.1   12.8     14.7       13.4     4.3   8.0   11.1\r\n   1954      576.3   10.0      9.9       13.0     4.0   7.8   11.9\r\n   1955      622.6   10.6      8.8       12.7     9.0   5.4   13.5\r\n   1956      481.9   11.2     10.3       15.1     9.5  10.6   12.2\r\n   1957      456.7    9.1     10.8        9.3     3.6   9.5    9.7\r\n   1958      367.1    7.9     13.2        6.4     2.8   5.1    7.1\r\n   1959      392.0    7.1     10.4        8.1     2.4   5.0    6.5\r\n   1960      389.4    8.1     12.3        8.4     3.0   7.9    8.4\r\n   1961      394.7    8.2     14.4        8.2     2.9   5.9    9.5\r\n   1962      518.6    9.7     15.3        9.0     4.1   6.5    8.6\r\n   Total   5,085.4    9.9     12.3       10.3     4.9   7.4   10.4\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote 1: Includes inductions and male\r\n                   \"non-prior service\" enlistments into the Regular\r\n                   components.]\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote 2: The Army was the only service\r\n                   drafting men during this decade.]\r\n\r\nWhile the Army's dependence on the draft, and thus Group IV men,\r\nexplained part of the continuing high percentage of Negroes in that\r\nservice, the Defense Department manpower group was at a loss to\r\nexplain the notable variation in black enlistments among the services.\r\nAll employed similar enlistment standards, yet during the period\r\n1958--1960, for example, black enlistment in the Army and Air Force\r\naveraged 7 percent, the Marine Corps 6 percent, and the Navy 2.7\r\npercent. Nor could the analysts isolate the factors contributing to\r\nthe low officer ratios in all four services. Almost all military\r\nofficers during the period under analysis were college graduates,\r\nNegroes comprised about 4 percent of all male college graduates, yet\r\nonly the Army maintained a black officer ratio approaching that\r\nfigure. (_See Table 13._)\r\n\r\nThe inability of many black servicemen to score highly in the tests\r\nmight also explain why training in some technical occupations\r\ncontinued more restricted for them (_Tables 18 and 19_). In        (p. 524)\r\ncontrast to ground combat and service occupations, which required\r\nlittle formal school training, some occupation groups--electronics,\r\nfor example--had high selection standards. The Defense Department\r\ngroup admitted that occupations for blacks in the armed forces had\r\nalso been influenced by historical patterns of segregated assignments\r\nto food service and other support occupations. Among men with twenty\r\nor more years in uniform, 40 percent of the blacks and 12 percent  (p. 525)\r\nof the whites were assigned to service occupations. But this pattern\r\nwas changing, the analysts pointed out. The reduction in the\r\ndifferential between whites and blacks in service occupations among\r\nmore recent recruits clearly reflected the impact of policies designed\r\nto equalize opportunities (_Table 20_). These policies had brought (p. 526)\r\nabout an increasing proportion of Negroes in white collar skills as\r\nwell as in ground combat skills.\r\n\r\nTable 18--Distribution of Enlisted Personnel in Each Major\r\nOccupation, 1956\r\n\r\n                            Percentage Distribution by AFQT Groups\r\n  Occupation                       I&II       III        IV\r\n\r\n  Electronics                      60.3       31.4        8.3\r\n  Other technical                  57.9       30.7       11.4\r\n  Admin. & clerical                51.5       37.4       11.1\r\n  Mechanics & repairmen            37.6       43.8       18.6\r\n  Crafts                           30.0       44.1       25.9\r\n  Services                         21.5       43.3       35.2\r\n  Ground combat                    24.5       37.1       38.4\r\n\r\nTable 19--Occupational Group Distribution by Race.

Although the\r\ndifference in grade distribution among black and white enlisted men\r\nwas much smaller, it too seemed related to disadvantages in education\r\nand service occupation. Again, for Negroes entering the services since\r\n1950, the grade distribution had become similar to that of whites. The\r\nNavy's experience illustrated this point. In the case of those\r\nentering the Navy since the Korean War, the grade distribution of\r\nwhites and nonwhites within the first three mental categories was\r\nnearly identical (_Table 23_). The divergences were much wider among\r\nthe more senior men in the service groups, but this was probably due\r\nat least in part to the concentration of senior black servicemen in\r\nrelatively overmanned specialties, such as food service, where\r\npromotional opportunities were limited. With this exception little\r\nevidence exists that whites enjoyed an advantage over blacks in the\r\nmatter of promotions in the enlisted ranks.\r\n\r\nTable 22--Percentage Distribution of Blacks and Whites by Pay Grade,\r\nAll DOD, 1962\r\n\r\n  Grade               Black         White\r\n\r\n  Officers\r\n  O-1 to O-2          35.9          34.5\r\n  O-3                 47.7          30.2\r\n  O-4                 12.1          18.0\r\n  O-5                  4.0          12.0\r\n  O-6 to O-10           .3           5.3\r\n  Total              100.0         100.0\r\n\r\n  Enlisted Men\r\n  E-1 to E-3          45.5          46.9\r\n  E-4                 23.1          19.6\r\n  E-5                 20.1          16.1\r\n  E-6                  8.2          10.0\r\n  E-7 to E-9           3.0           7.5\r\n  Total              100.0         100.0\r\n\r\nTable 23--Percentage Distribution of Navy Enlisted Personnel by Race,\r\nAFQT Groups, Pay Grade, and Length of Service, 1962\r\n\r\n                       0-12 Years       Over 12 Years\r\n  Pay Grade          White   Negro      White   Negro\r\n\r\n  AFQT Groups I & II\r\n  E-1 to E-3        50.0     50.4        0.1     0.5\r\n  E-4               22.5     21.8        1.0     5.3\r\n  E-5               17.8     18.6        6.6    16.8\r\n  E-6                8.3      8.5       30.8    33.9\r\n  E-7 to E-9         1.4       .7       61.5    43.6\r\n  Total            100.0    100.0      100.0   100.0\r\n\r\n  AFQT Group III\r\n  E-1 to E-3        60.6     60.5        0.5     3.5\r\n  E-4               20.7     20.4        4.4    14.7\r\n  E-5               13.1     14.2       19.3    28.8\r\n  E-6                5.1      4.6       40.1    33.7\r\n  E-7 to E-9          .5       .3       35.7    19.3\r\n  Total            100.0    100.0      100.0   100.0\r\n\r\n  AFQT Group IV\r\n  E-1 to E-3        77.1     61.2        2.2    12.2\r\n  E-4               13.0     23.3       14.9    32.6\r\n  E-5                7.9     13.0       34.0    29.9\r\n  E-6                1.9      2.4       32.4    19.3\r\n  E-7 to E-9          .1      [a]       16.5     6.0\r\n  Total            100.0    100.0      100.0   100.0\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote a: Less than .05 percent.]\r\n\r\nAll these figures could be conjured up when the services had to answer\r\ncomplaints of discrimination, but more often than not the services\r\ncontented themselves with a vague defense of the _status quo_[20-82]\r\nSuch answers were clearly unacceptable to civil rights leaders     (p. 528)\r\nand their allies in the administration, and it is not surprising that\r\nthe complaints persisted. To the argument that higher enlistment\r\nstandards were a matter of military economy during a period of partial\r\nmobilizations, those concerned about civil rights responded that,\r\nsince marginal manpower was a necessary ingredient of full\r\nmobilization, the services should learn to deal in peacetime with what\r\nwould be a wartime problem.[20-83] To pleas of helplessness against\r\noff-base discrimination, the activists argued that these practices had\r\ndemonstrably adverse effects on the morale of more than 9 percent of\r\nthe armed forces and were, therefore, a clear threat to the\r\naccomplishment of the services' military mission.[20-84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-82: See, for example, the following\r\n                   Memos: Dep Under SA (Manpower) for ASD (M), 30 Mar\r\n                   62, sub: Servicemen's Complaints of Discrimination\r\n                   in the U.S. Military; AF Dep for Manpower, Pers,\r\n                   and Organization for ASD (M), 29 Mar 62, sub:\r\n                   Alleged Racial Discrimination Within the Air Force;\r\n                   Under SecNav for ASD (M), 16 Mar 62, sub:\r\n                   Discrimination in the U.S. Military Services.

Some members of the administration rode with the reform\r\nmovement. Although he was speaking particularly of increased black\r\nenrollment at the military academies, Special White House Assistant\r\nWofford betrayed the reformer's attitude toward the whole problem of\r\nequal opportunity when he told James Evans \"I am sure that much work\r\nhas been done, but there is, of course, still a long way to\r\ngo.\"[20-85] But by 1962 the services had just about exhausted the\r\ntraditional reform methods available to them. To go further, as\r\nWofford and the civil rights advocates demanded, meant a fundamental\r\nchange in the department's commitment to equal treatment and\r\nopportunity. The decision to make such a change was clearly up to\r\nSecretary McNamara and the Kennedy administration.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 20-85: Memo, Wofford for Evans, 2 Feb 62,\r\n                   Wofford Collection, J.

Such an extension of policy, certainly the most\r\nimportant to be contemplated since President Truman's executive order\r\nin 1948, would involve the Department of Defense in the fight for\r\nservicemen's civil rights, thrusting it into the forefront of the\r\ncivil rights movement.\r\n\r\nGiven the forces at work in the department, it was by no means certain\r\nin 1962 that the fight against discrimination would be extended beyond\r\nthose vestiges that continued to exist in the military community\r\nitself. In Robert McNamara the department had an energetic secretary,\r\ncommitted to the principle of equal treatment and opportunity, and,\r\nsince his days with the Ford Motor Company in Michigan, a member of\r\nthe NAACP. But, as his directives indicated, McNamara had much to\r\nlearn in the field of race relations. As he later recalled: \"Adam\r\n[Yarmolinsky] was more sensitive to the subject [race relations] in\r\nthose days than I was. I was concerned. I recognized what Harry Truman\r\nhad done, his leadership in the field, and I wanted to continue his\r\nwork. But I didn't know enough.\"[21-1]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-1: Interv, author with McNamara, telecon\r\n                   of 11 May 72, CMH files.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Secretary Makes a Decision_\r\n\r\nSome of McNamara's closest advisers and some civil rights advocates in\r\nthe Kennedy administration, increasingly critical of current\r\npractices, were anxious to instruct the secretary in the need for a\r\nnew racial outlook. But their efforts were counterbalanced by the\r\ninfluence of defenders of the _status quo_, primarily the manpower\r\nbureaucrats in the secretary's office and their colleagues in the\r\nservices. These men opposed substantive change not because they\r\nobjected to the reformers' goals but because they doubted the wisdom\r\nand propriety of interfering in what they regarded as essentially a\r\ndomestic political issue.\r\n\r\nSuperficially, the department's racial policy appears to have been\r\nshaped by a conflict between traditionalists and progressives, but it\r\nwould be a mistake to apply these labels mechanically to the men\r\ninvolved. There were among them several shades of opinion, and     (p. 531)\r\nthey were affected as well by complex political and social pressures.\r\nMany of those involved in the debate shared a similar goal. A\r\ncontinuum existed, one defense official later suggested, that ranged\r\nfrom a few people who wanted for a number of reasons to do\r\nnothing--who even wanted to tolerate the continued segregation of\r\nNational Guard units called to active duty in 1961--to men of\r\nconsiderable impatience who thought the off-limits sanction was a\r\nneglected and obvious weapon which ought to be invoked at once.[21-2]\r\nNevertheless, these various views tended to coalesce into a series of\r\nmutually exclusive arguments that can be analyzed.[21-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-2: Ltr, Alfred B.

Copies of all in CMH. See\r\n                   also Adam Yarmolinsky, _The Military Establishment:\r\n                   Its Impacts in American Society_ (New York: Harper\r\n                   & Row, 1971), p. 351.]\r\n\r\nOne group, from whom Adam Yarmolinsky, McNamara's special assistant,\r\nmight be singled out as the most prominent member, developed arguments\r\nfor a new racial policy that would encourage the services to modify\r\nlocal laws and customs in ways more favorable to black servicemen.\r\nUnlike earlier reformers in the department who acted primarily out of\r\nan interest in military efficiency, these men were basically civil\r\nlibertarians, or \"social movers,\" as Secretary of the Air Force\r\nZuckert called them. They were allied with like-minded new\r\nfrontiersmen, including the President's special counsel on minority\r\naffairs and Attorney General Kennedy, who were convinced that Congress\r\nwould enact no new civil rights legislation in 1962. The services,\r\nthis group argued, had through their recent integration found\r\nthemselves in the vanguard of the national campaign for equal\r\ntreatment and opportunity for Negroes, and to some it seemed only\r\nlogical that they be used to retain that lead for the administration.\r\nThese men had ample proof, they believed, for the proposition that the\r\nservices' policies had already influenced reforms elsewhere. They saw\r\na strong connection, for example, between the new Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission's order outlawing segregation in interstate travel and the\r\nservices' efforts to secure equal treatment for troops in transit. In\r\neffect, in the name of an administration handicapped by an unwilling\r\nlegislature, they were asking the services to fly the flag of civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nIf their motives differed from those of their predecessors, their\r\nrhetoric did not. Yarmolinsky and his colleagues argued that racial\r\ndiscrimination, particularly discrimination in housing and public\r\naccommodations, created a serious morale problem among black GIs, a\r\ncontention strongly supported by the recent Civil Rights Commission\r\nfindings. While the services had always denied responsibility for\r\ncombating discrimination outside the military reservation, these   (p. 532)\r\nofficials were confident that the connection between this\r\ndiscrimination and military efficiency could be demonstrated. They\r\nwere also convinced that segregated housing and the related\r\nsegregation of places of public accommodation were particularly\r\nsusceptible to economic pressure from military authorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADAM YARMOLINSKY.]\r\n\r\nThis last argument was certainly not new. For some time civil rights\r\nspokesmen had been urging the services to use economic pressure to\r\nease discrimination. Specifically, Congressman Powell, and later a\r\nnumber of civil rights groups, had called on the armed forces to\r\nimpose off-limits sanctions for all servicemen against businesses that\r\ndiscriminated against black servicemen. Clear historical precedent\r\nseemed to exist for the action demanded by the controversial Harlem\r\nlegislator because from earliest time the services had been declaring\r\nestablishments and whole geographical areas off limits to their\r\nofficers and men in order to protect their health and welfare. In view\r\nof the services' contention that equal treatment and opportunity were\r\nimportant to the welfare of servicemen, was it not reasonable, the\r\nspokesmen could ask, for the armed forces to use this powerful\r\neconomic weapon against those who discriminated?\r\n\r\nThose defense officials calling for further changes also argued that\r\neven the limited reforms already introduced by the administration\r\nfaced slow going in the Department of Defense. This point was of\r\nparticular concern to Robert Kennedy and his assistants in the Justice\r\nDepartment who agreed that senior defense officials lacked neither the\r\nzeal nor the determination to advance the civil rights of black\r\nservicemen but that the uniformed services were not, as Deputy\r\nSecretary Gilpatric expressed it, \"putting their hearts and souls into\r\nreally carrying out all of these directives and policies.\" Reflecting\r\non it later, Gilpatric decided that the problem in the armed forces\r\nwas one of pace. The services, he believed, were willing enough to\r\ncarry out the policies, but in their own way and at their own speed,\r\nto avoid the appearance of acting as the agent of another federal\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nAll these arguments failed to convince Assistant Secretary for\r\nManpower Runge, some officials in the general counsel's office, and\r\nprincipal black adviser on racial affairs James Evans, among others.\r\nThis group and their allies in the services could point to a political\r\nfact of life: to interfere with local segregation laws and customs,\r\nspecifically to impose off-limits sanctions against southern businessmen,\r\nwould pit the administration against powerful congressmen, calling (p. 533)\r\ndown on it the wrath of the armed services and appropriation committees.\r\nTo the charge that this threat of congressional retaliation was simply\r\nan excuse for inaction, the services could explain that unlike the\r\nrecent integration of military units, which was largely an executive\r\nfunction with which Congress, or at least some individual congressmen,\r\nreluctantly went along, sanctions against local communities would be\r\nconsidered a direct threat by scores of legislators. \"Even one obscure\r\ncongressman thus threatened could light a fire over military\r\nsanctions,\" Evans later remarked, \"and there were plenty of folks\r\naround who were eager to fan the flames.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES EVANS.]\r\n\r\nEven more important, the department's equal opportunity bureaucracy\r\nargued, was the need to protect the physical well-being of the\r\nindividual black soldier. In a decade when civil rights beatings and\r\nmurders were a common occurrence, these men knew that Evans was right\r\nwhen he said \"by the time Washington could enter the case the young\r\nman could be injured or dead.\" Operating under the principle that the\r\nsafety and welfare of the individual transcended the civil rights of\r\nthe group, these officials wanted to forbid the men, both the black\r\nand the increasing number of white activists, to disobey local\r\nsegregation laws and customs.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of intervention pointed out that the services would be\r\nill-advised to push for changes outside the military reservation until\r\nthe reforms begun under Truman were completely realized inside the\r\nreservation. Ignoring the argument that discrimination in the local\r\ncommunity had a profound effect on morale, they wanted the services to\r\nconcentrate instead on the necessary but minor reforms within their\r\njurisdiction. To give the local commander the added responsibility for\r\ncorrecting discrimination in the community, they contended, might very\r\nwell dilute his efforts to correct conditions within the services. And\r\nto use servicemen to spearhead civil rights reform was a misuse of\r\nexecutive power. With support from the department's lawyers, they\r\nquestioned the legality of using off-limits sanctions in civil rights\r\ncases. They constantly repeated the same refrain: social reform was\r\nnot a military function. As one manpower spokesman put it to the\r\nrenowned black civil rights lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, \"let the Army\r\ntend its own backyard, and let other government agencies work on civil\r\nrights.\"[21-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-4: Interv, author with Evans, 4 Mar 72.]\r\n\r\nRunge and the rest were professional manpower managers who had a   (p. 534)\r\nhealthy respect for the chance of command error and its effect on race\r\nrelations nationally. In this they found an ally in Secretary of the\r\nAir Force Eugene M. Zuckert, one of the architects of Air Force\r\nintegration in 1949. American commanders lacked training in the\r\ndelicate art of community relations, Zuckert later explained, and\r\nshould even a few of them blunder they could bring on a race crisis of\r\nmajor proportions. He sympathized with the activists' goals and was\r\nconvinced that the President as Commander in Chief could and should\r\nuse the armed forces for social ends; but these social objectives had\r\nto be balanced against the need to preserve the military forces for\r\ntheir primary mission. Again on the practical level, Deputy Secretary\r\nof Defense Gilpatric was concerned with the problems of devising\r\ngeneral instructions that could be applied in all the diverse\r\nsituations that might arise at the hundreds of bases and local\r\ncommunities involved.[21-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-5: USAF Oral Hist Interv with Zuckert,\r\n                   Apr 73; Interv, O'Brien with Gilpatric, 5 May 70.]\r\n\r\nMany of the manpower officials carefully differentiated between equal\r\ntreatment, which had always been at the heart of the Defense\r\nDepartment's reforms, and civil rights, which they were convinced were\r\na constitutional matter and belonged in the hands of the courts and\r\nthe Justice Department. The principle of equal treatment and\r\nopportunity was beyond criticism. Its application, a lengthy and\r\narduous task that had occupied and still concerned the services'\r\nracial advisers, had brought the Department of Defense to unparalleled\r\nheights of racial harmony. Convinced that the current civil rights\r\ncampaign was not the business of the Defense Department, they\r\nquestioned the motives of those who were willing to make black GI's\r\nthe stalking horse for their latest and perhaps transient enthusiasm,\r\nin the process inviting congressional criticism of the department's\r\nvital racial programs. In short, Assistant Secretary Runge and his\r\ncolleagues argued that the administration's civil rights campaign\r\nshould be led by the Justice Department and by the Department of\r\nHealth, Education, and Welfare, not the Defense Department, which had\r\nother missions to perform.\r\n\r\nSuch were the rationalizations that had kept the Department of Defense\r\nout of the field of community race relations for over a decade, and\r\nthe opponents of change in a strong position. Their opposition was\r\nreasonable, their allies in the services were legion, they were backed\r\nby years of tradition, and, most important, they held the jobs where\r\nthe day-to-day decisions on racial matters were made. To change the\r\n_status quo_, to move the department beyond the notion that the\r\nguarantee of equal rights stopped at the boundaries of military\r\ninstallations, might seem \"desirable and indeed necessary\" to\r\nYarmolinsky and his confreres,[21-6] but it would take something more\r\nthan their eloquent words to bring about change.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-6: Ltr, Yarmolinsky to author, 30 May 72,\r\n                   CMH files.]\r\n\r\nYarmolinsky was convinced that the initiative for such a change had to\r\ncome from outside the department. Certain that any outside\r\ninvestigation would quickly reveal the connection between racial\r\ndiscrimination in the community and military efficiency, he wanted the\r\nSecretary of Defense to appoint a committee of independent         (p. 535)\r\ncitizens to investigate and report on the situation.[21-7] The idea of\r\na citizens' committee was not new. The Fahy Committee provided a\r\nrecent precedent, and in August 1961 Congressman Diggs had asked the\r\nSecretary of Defense to consider the appointment of such a group, a\r\nsuggestion rejected at the time by Assistant Secretary Runge.[21-8]\r\nBut Yarmolinsky enjoyed opportunities unavailable to the Michigan\r\ncongressman; he had the attention and the support of Robert McNamara.\r\nIn the latter's words: \"Adam suggested another broad review of the\r\nplace of the Negro in the Department. The committee was necessary\r\nbecause the other sources--the DOD manpower reports and so forth--were\r\ninadequate. They didn't provide the exact information I needed. This\r\nis what Adam and I decided.\"[21-9] This decision launched the\r\nDepartment of Defense into one of the most important civil rights\r\nbattles of the 1960's.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-7: Not everyone supporting the idea of an\r\n                   investigatory committee was necessarily an advocate\r\n                   of Yarmolinsky's theories. Roy K. Davenport, soon\r\n                   to be appointed a deputy under secretary of the\r\n                   Army for personnel management, decided that an\r\n                   assessment of the status of black servicemen was\r\n                   timely after a decade of integration. His\r\n                   professional curiosity, like that of some of the\r\n                   other manpower experts in the services, was piqued\r\n                   more by a concern for the fate of current\r\n                   regulations than an interest in the development of\r\n                   new ones.

Kennedy announced the formation of the\r\nPresident's Committee on Equality of Opportunity in the Armed Forces,\r\npopularly designated the Gesell Committee after its chairman, Gerhard\r\nA. Gesell.[21-10] It was inevitable that the Gesell Committee should\r\nbe compared to the Fahy Committee, given the similarity of interests,\r\nbut in fact the two groups had little in common and served different\r\npurposes. The Fahy Committee had been created to carry out President\r\nTruman's equal treatment and opportunity policy. The Gesell Committee,\r\non the other hand, was less concerned with carrying out existing\r\npolicy than with developing a new policy for the Department of\r\nDefense. The Fahy Committee operated under an executive order and\r\nsought an acceptable integration program from each service. The Gesell\r\nCommittee enjoyed no such advantage, although the Truman order was\r\ntechnically still in effect and could have been used to support it.\r\n(The Kennedy administration ignored this possibility, and Yarmolinsky\r\nwarned one presidential aide that the Truman order should be quietly\r\nrevoked lest someone question why the Gesell Committee had not been\r\nafforded similar stature.)[21-11]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-10: Ltr, Kennedy to Gesell, 22 Jun 62, as\r\n                   reproduced in White House Press Release, 24 Jun 62,\r\n                   copy in CMH. For an example of the attention the\r\n                   new committee received in the press, see Washington\r\n                   _Post_, June 24, 1962.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-11: Memo, Yarmolinsky for Lee C. White,\r\n                   26 Jul 62, sub: Revocation of Executive Order 9981,\r\n                   SD 291.2.]\r\n\r\nAgain unlike the Fahy Committee, which forced its attention upon a\r\ngenerally reluctant Defense Department at the behest of the President,\r\nthe Gesell Committee was created by the Secretary of Defense; the\r\npresidential appointment of its members bestowed an aura of special\r\nauthority on a group that lacked the power of its predecessor to   (p. 536)\r\nmake and review policy. McNamara later put it quite bluntly: \"The\r\ncommittee was the creature of the Secretary of Defense. Calling it a\r\nPresident's committee was just windowdressing. The civil rights people\r\ndidn't have a damn thing to do with it. We wanted information, and\r\nthat's just what the Gesell people gave us.\"[21-12] In fact,\r\nYarmolinsky conceived the project, named it, nominated its members,\r\nand drew up its directives. Only when it was well along was the\r\nproject passed to the White House for review of the committee's makeup\r\nand guidelines.[21-13]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-12: Interv, author with McNamara, 11 May\r\n                   72; see also Ltr, Yarmolinsky to author, 30 May 72.\r\n                   Yarmolinsky called the presidential appointment an\r\n                   example of the Defense Department's borrowing the\r\n                   prestige of the White House.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-13: Memo, ASD (M) for Asst Legal Counsel\r\n                   to President, 7 Nov 61, sub: Racial Discrimination\r\n                   in the Armed Services, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThis special connection between the Department of Defense and the\r\nGesell Committee influenced the course of the investigation. True to\r\nhis concept of the committee as a fact-finding team, McNamara\r\npersonally remained aloof from its proceedings, never trying to\r\ninfluence its investigation or findings. Ironically, Gesell would\r\nlater complain about this remoteness, regretting the secretary's\r\nfailure to intervene in the case of the recalcitrant National\r\nGuard.[21-14] He could harbor no complaint, however, against the\r\nsecretary's special assistant, Yarmolinsky, who carefully guided the\r\ncommittee's investigation to the explosive subject of off-base\r\ndiscrimination. Even while expressing the committee's independence,\r\nGesell recognized Yarmolinsky's influence. \"It was perfectly clear,\"\r\nGesell later noted, \"that Yarmolinsky was interested in the off-base\r\nhousing and discrimination situation, but he had no solution to\r\nsuggest. He wanted the committee to come up with one.\"[21-15]\r\nYarmolinsky formally spelled out this interest when he devised the\r\ngroup's presidential directive. The committee, he informed Vice\r\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson during March 1962, would devote itself to\r\nthose measures that should be taken to improve the effectiveness of\r\ncurrent policies and procedures in the services and to the methods\r\nwhereby the Department of Defense could improve equality of\r\nopportunity for members of the armed forces and their dependents in\r\nthe civilian community.[21-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-14: Interv, author with Gesell, 3 Nov 74,\r\n                   CMH files.

Gesell always assumed that this\r\nfriendship with Marshall explained his selection by the Kennedy\r\nadministration for such a sensitive task.[21-19] Black committeemen\r\nwere Nathaniel S. Colley, a California lawyer, civil rights advocate\r\nassociated with the NAACP, and former law school classmate of\r\nYarmolinsky's; John H. Sengstacke, publisher of the Chicago _Defender_\r\nand a member of the Fahy Committee; and Whitney M. Young, Jr., of the\r\nNational Urban League. The other members were Abe Fortas, a prominent\r\nWashington attorney and former Yale professor; Benjamin Muse, a leader\r\nof the Southern Regional Council and a noted student of the civil\r\nrights movement; and Louis Hector, also a Yale-educated lawyer, who\r\nwas called in to replace ailing Dean Joseph O'Meara of the Notre Dame\r\nLaw School. Gesell arranged for the appointment of Laurence I. Hewes\r\nIII, of Yale College and Law School, as the committee's counsel.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-17: Memo, ASD (M) for Lee C.

Fitt, the first Deputy\r\n                   Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civil Rights),\r\n                   Cyrus R. Vance, Secretary of the Army, and Deputy\r\n                   Secretary of Defense Gilpatric, were Yale men. Of\r\n                   course, Secretary McNamara was not a Yale graduate;\r\n                   his undergraduate degree is from the University of\r\n                   California at Berkeley, his graduate degree from\r\n                   Harvard.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-19: Interv, author with Gesell, 13 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nSome of the members had definite ideas on how the committee should\r\noperate. Warning of a new mood in the black community where\r\n\"impatience and expectations\" were far different from what they were\r\nat the time of the Fahy Committee, Whitney Young wanted the committee\r\nto prepare a frank and honest report free of the \"taint of whitewash.\"\r\nTo that end he wanted the group's directive interpreted in its\r\nbroadest sense as leading to a wide-ranging examination of off-base\r\nhousing, recreation, and educational opportunity, among other\r\nsubjects. He wanted an investigation at the grass roots level, and he\r\noffered specific suggestions about the size and duties of the staff to\r\nachieve this. Young also recommended commissioning \"additional citizen\r\nteams\" to assist in some of the numerous and necessary field trips and\r\nwanted the committee to use Congressman Diggs and his files.[21-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-20: Ltr, Young to Gesell, 27 Aug 62,\r\n                   Gesell Collection, J. F. Kennedy Library.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Muse, on the other hand, considered direct, personal\r\ninvestigation of specific grievances too time-consuming. He wanted the\r\ngroup to concentrate instead on the command level, holding formal\r\nconferences with key staff officials. The best way to impress upon the\r\nservices that the White House was serious, he told Gesell, was to\r\nlearn the opinions of these officials and to elicit, \"subject to our\r\nprivate analysis and discount,\" a great deal of helpful\r\ninformation.[21-21]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-21: Ltr, Muse to Gesell, 26 Jan 63,\r\n                   Gesell Collection, J. F. Kennedy Library.]\r\n\r\nChairman Gesell compromised. He wanted the group to develop some broad\r\nrecommendations on the basis of a limited examination of specific\r\ncomplaints. President Kennedy agreed. He told Gesell: \"don't go\r\noverboard and try to visit every base, but unless you see at least\r\nsome bases you will never understand the situation.\"[21-22] White\r\nHouse assistant Lee C. White suggested that while the committee had no\r\ndeadline it should be advised that a report would be needed in June if\r\nany legislative proposals were to be submitted to Congress. At the (p. 538)\r\nsame time he wanted the White House to make clear that the members,\r\n\"and particularly the Negro members,\" would be left free to act as\r\nthey chose.[21-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-22: Quoted by Gesell during interview\r\n                   with author, 13 May 72.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-23: Memo, White for Dep Atty Gen, 23 Jan\r\n                   63, copy in Lee C.

According to Yarmolinsky, the White\r\n                   suggestion might have originated with Secretary\r\n                   McNamara.]\r\n\r\nIn the end the committee's operations owed something to all these\r\nsuggestions. The group worked out of a small office near the White\r\nHouse and pointedly distant from the Pentagon. Its formal meetings\r\nwere rare--only seven in all--and were used primarily to hear the\r\npresentations of service officials and consider the committee's\r\nfindings. At a meeting in November 1962, for instance, Gesell arranged\r\nfor five Air Force base commanders to discuss the application of the\r\nequal opportunity policy in their commands and in neighboring\r\ncommunities and describe their own duties as they saw them.[21-24]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-24: Ltr, Gesell to SecAF, 25 Oct 62,\r\n                   SecAF files.]\r\n\r\nThe chairman explained that the infrequent meetings were used mostly\r\nfor \"needling people and asking for statistics.\" Some black members at\r\nfirst opposed asking the services for statistical data on the grounds\r\nthat such requests would reinforce the tendency to identify servicemen\r\nby race, thus encouraging racial assignments and, ultimately, racial\r\nquotas. The majority, however, was convinced of the need for\r\nstatistical material, and in the end the requests for such information\r\nenjoyed the committee's unanimous support.[21-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-25: Interv, author with Gesell, 3 Nov\r\n                   74.]\r\n\r\nMost of the committee's work was done in a \"shirt sleeve\" atmosphere,\r\nas its chairman described it, with a staff of four people.[21-26]\r\nMembers, alone and in groups, studied the mountains of racial\r\nstatistics, some prepared by the staff of the Civil Rights Commission,\r\nand the lengthy answers to committee questionnaires prepared by the\r\nservices. The services also arranged for on-site inspections by\r\ncommittee members.[21-27] The field trips proved to be of paramount\r\nimportance, not only in ascertaining the conditions of black\r\nservicemen and their dependents but also in fixing the extent of the\r\nlocal commander's responsibility for race relations. Operating usually\r\nin two-man biracial teams, the committee members would separate to\r\ninterview the commander, local businessmen, and the men themselves.\r\nThe firsthand information thus gathered had a profound influence on\r\nthe committee's thinking, an influence readily discernible in its\r\nrecommendations to the President.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-26: Memo, Gesell for Cmte Members, 20 Nov\r\n                   64, Gesell Collection, J.

Regarding evidence of discrimination within the services,\r\nthe committee isolated a series of problems existing \"both\r\nservice-wide and at particular bases.\"[21-28] Specifically, the group\r\nwas not convinced by official reasons for the disproportionately small\r\nnumber of Negroes in some services, especially among the\r\nnoncommissioned officers and in the officer corps. Chairman Gesell\r\ncalled the dearth of black officers a \"shocking condition.\"[21-29] His\r\ngroup was particularly concerned with the absence of black officers on\r\npromotion boards and the possibility of unfairness in the promotion\r\nprocess where photos and racial and religious information were\r\nincluded in the selection files made available to these boards. It\r\nalso noted the failure of the services to increase the number of black\r\nROTC graduates. The committee considered and rejected the idea of\r\nproviding preferential treatment for Negroes to achieve better\r\nrepresentation in the services and in the higher grades.[21-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-28: The President's Committee on Equal\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Forces, \"Initial Report:\r\n                   Equality of Treatment and Opportunity for Negro\r\n                   Military Personnel Stationed Within the United\r\n                   States, June 13, 1963\" (hereafter cited as \"Initial\r\n                   Rpt\"), p. 10.

On another score, the Chief\r\nof Naval Personnel noted that the committee \"considers the Navy and\r\nMarines far behind the Army and Air Force, particularly in the area of\r\ncommunity relations,\" a criticism, he admitted, \"to some extent\"\r\njustified.[21-32] So apparent was the justification that, at the\r\nsuggestion of the Secretary of the Navy, Gesell discussed with Under\r\nSecretary Paul B. Fay, Jr., ways to better the Navy's record in its\r\n\"areas of least progress.\"[21-33] Gesell later concluded that the\r\nclose social contact necessary aboard ship had been a factor in the\r\nNavy's slower progress.[21-34] Whatever the reason, the Navy and\r\nMarine Corps fell statistically short of the other services in every\r\ncategory measured by the Gesell group.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-31: Memo, Dep for Manpower, Personnel, &\r\n                   Organization, USAF, for SecAF, 25 Jan 63, sub:\r\n                   Meeting With President's Committee on Equal\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Forces, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-32: Ltr, Chief of NavPers to CONUS\r\n                   District Cmdrs et al., 22 Apr 63, attached to Memo,\r\n                   Chief of NavPers for Distribution List, 24 Apr 63,\r\n                   sub: President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in\r\n                   the Armed Forces, GenRecsNav 5420.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-33: Ltr, Under SecNav to Gesell, 8 Feb\r\n                   63, SecNav file 5420 (1179), GenRecsNav.

The committee itself had\r\npersuaded the National United Services Organization to integrate its\r\nfacilities, and it wanted local commanders to follow up by inviting black\r\ncivilians to participate in USO dances and entertainments.[21-35]  (p. 540)\r\nThe committee also discussed discrimination in military police\r\nassignments, segregation in local transport and on school buses, and\r\nthe commander's attitude toward interracial associations both on and\r\noff the military reservation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-35: For an example of how an individual\r\n                   service was handling the USO and other on-base\r\n                   social problems, see Memo, Maj Gen John K.

See also\r\n                   \"Initial Rpt,\" pp. 73-74.]\r\n\r\nDespite its criticism of the imperfect application of service race\r\npolicies--some service-wide, others confined to certain bases--the\r\ncommittee reported to the President that the services had made \"an\r\nintelligent and far-reaching advance toward complete integration, and,\r\nwith some variations from service to service, substantial progress\r\ntoward equality of treatment and opportunity.\"[21-36] Gesell called\r\nthe services the nation's \"pace setter,\" and he was convinced that\r\nthey had not received sufficient credit for their racial achievements,\r\nwhich were \"way ahead of General Motors and the other great\r\ncorporations.\"[21-37] That the services were more advanced than other\r\nsegments of American society in terms of equal treatment and\r\nopportunity was beyond dispute; nevertheless, serious problems\r\nconnected with racial prejudice and the armed forces' failure to\r\nunderstand the fundamental needs of black servicemen remained. The\r\ncommittee's investigation, with its emphasis on off-base realities and\r\nits dependence on statistics and other empirical data, did not lend\r\nitself to more than a superficial treatment of these subtle and\r\nstubborn, if unmeasurable, on-base problems.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-36: \"Initial Rpt,\" p. 10.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-37: Interv, author with Gesell, 3 Nov\r\n                   74.]\r\n\r\nThe committee believed that some of what appeared discriminatory was\r\nin reality the working of such factors as the black serviceman's lack\r\nof seniority, deficiencies in education, and lack of interest in\r\nspecific fields and assignments. Looking beyond these, the fruits of\r\ninstitutional racism, the committee concluded that much of the\r\nsubstantiated discrimination disclosed in its investigations had\r\nproved to be limited in scope. But whether limited or widespread,\r\ndiscrimination had to be eliminated. Prompt attention to even minor\r\nincidents of discrimination would contribute substantially to morale\r\nand serve to keep before all servicemen the standard of conduct\r\ndecreed by executive policy.[21-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-38: \"Initial Rpt,\" pp. 10-11, 30, 51.]\r\n\r\nThe committee was considerably less sanguine over conditions\r\nencountered by black servicemen off military bases. In eloquent\r\nparagraphs it outlined for the President the injustices suffered by\r\nthese men and their families in some American communities, the effect\r\nof these practices on morale, and the consequent danger to the mission\r\nof the armed forces. It reviewed the services' efforts to eliminate\r\nsegregated housing, schooling, and public accommodations around the\r\nmilitary reservations and found them wanting. Local commanders, the\r\ncommittee charged, were often naive about the existence of social\r\nproblems and generally did not keep abreast of departmental policy\r\nspecifying their obligations; they were especially ill-informed on the\r\nMcNamara-Gilpatric directives and memorandums on equal treatment.\r\nOften quizzed on the subject, the commanders told the committee that\r\nthey enjoyed very fine community relationships. To this Whitney    (p. 541)\r\nYoung would answer that fine community relationships and racial\r\ninjustice were not necessarily exclusive.[21-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-39: Memo for Rcd, USAF Dep for Manpower,\r\n                   Personnel, & Organization, 14 Nov 62, sub: Meeting\r\n                   of the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity\r\n                   in the Armed Forces, SecAF file 2426-62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GESELL COMMITTEE MEETS WITH THE PRESIDENT. _Left to\r\nright_: _Laurence I.

Sengstacke_; and _Abe Fortas_.]\r\n\r\nThis community-based discrimination, the committee found, had become a\r\ngreater trial for black servicemen and their families because of its\r\noften startling contrast to their life in the services. There was even\r\nevidence that some of the off-base segregation, especially overseas,\r\nhad been introduced through the efforts of white servicemen.\r\nParticularly irritating to the committee were restrictions placed on\r\nblack participation in civil rights demonstrations protesting such\r\noff-base conditions. The committee wanted the restrictions\r\nremoved.[21-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-40: Memo, Dep for Manpower, Personnel, &\r\n                   Organization, USAF, for SecAF, 25 Jan 63, sub:\r\n                   Meeting With President's Committee on Equal\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Forces, SecAF files.

After all,\r\nothers, most notably the Civil Rights Commission, had recently\r\ndocumented the problems encountered by black servicemen, although not\r\nin the detail offered by the Gesell group, and had convincingly tied\r\nthis discrimination to black morale and military efficiency. The   (p. 542)\r\ncommittee's major contribution lay rather in its establishment of\r\na new concept in command responsibility that directly attacked the\r\ntraditional parochialism of the services' social concerns:\r\n\r\n     It should be the policy of the Department of Defense and part of\r\n     the mission of the chain of command from the Secretaries of the\r\n     Services to the local base commander not only to remove\r\n     discrimination within the Armed Forces, but also to make every\r\n     effort to eliminate discriminatory practices as they affect\r\n     members of the Armed Forces and their dependents within the\r\n     neighboring civilian communities.[21-41]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-41: \"Initial Rpt,\" p. 61.]\r\n\r\nIn effect the committee proposed a new racial policy for the\r\nDepartment of Defense, one that would translate the services' promise\r\nof equality of treatment and opportunity into a declaration of civil\r\nliberties. To that end it recommended the adoption of a set of\r\ntechniques radically new to the thinking of the military commanders,\r\none that grew out of the committee's own experiences in the field.\r\n\r\nChairman Gesell later recollected how this recommendation developed:\r\n\r\n     I remember in particular our experiences at the bases at Augusta\r\n     and Pensacola. This made a strong impression on me. I saw\r\n     discrimination on bases right under the noses of the commanders\r\n     who were often not even aware of it. And I saw much\r\n     discrimination in communities around the bases. Sometimes\r\n     unbelievable. At Pensacola, for example, I found that the Station\r\n     had never used Negroes for guard duty at the main gate where they\r\n     would be seen by the public, black and white. We told this to the\r\n     commander and reminded him of the effect that it had on black\r\n     morale. He changed it immediately. On base the housing for blacks\r\n     was segregated off to one side in poor run-down shacks below the\r\n     railroad tracks. We told the commander who admitted that he had\r\n     some substandard housing units but was unaware of any segregation\r\n     in housing. The commander promised to report to us about this in\r\n     two weeks. He did later report: \"the whole housing area has been\r\n     bulldozed and all housing on base integrated.\" It was examples\r\n     like this that convinced me that there was much the commanders\r\n     could do.[21-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-42: Interv, author with Gesell, 13 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nThis sense of racial progress made a vivid impression on committee\r\nmember Muse who later recalled that \"it was amazing how much activity\r\nour presence stirred up. It showed that a lot could be done by\r\ncommanders.\"[21-43] Gesell and Muse were particularly impressed by how\r\nlocal commanders, acting firmly but informally, could achieve swift\r\nbreakthroughs. But actually, as the Gesell-Young trip to Pensacola\r\ndemonstrated, often more than the base commander was involved in these\r\ndramatic reforms. A week after their trip to Florida, Gesell and Young\r\nhad a casual chat with Under Secretary Fay about conditions at\r\nPensacola, particularly housing conditions, that, they claimed, had\r\ncontributed to a \"literally disgraceful\" state of black morale,\r\nleading black sailors \"almost to the point of rebellion.\" Although the\r\nbase commander seemed concerned, he had deferred to his military\r\nsuperior who lacked the \"philosophical outlook oriented toward the\r\nsuccessful implementation of equal opportunity policies.\" Fay was\r\nquick to see the point. He pledged the Navy to a \"constructive effort\"\r\nto eliminate the problem at Pensacola \"prior to the Committee's\r\nreporting date [to the President] of 1 June.\"[21-44] In a matter   (p. 543)\r\nof hours Fay was arranging to send the Inspector General to Pensacola,\r\nbut the matter did not end there. In late May committee counsel Hewes\r\nasked the Assistant Secretary of Defense concerned with military\r\ninstallations about housing at Pensacola, thus setting off yet another\r\ninvestigation of the base.[21-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-43: Idem with Benjamin Muse, 2 Mar 73,\r\n                   CMH files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-44: Memo, Under SecNav for SecNav, 9 Apr\r\n                   63, sub: Meeting With the President's Cmte on Equal\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Forces, SecNav file 5420,\r\n                   GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-45: Ltr, DASD (Family Housing) to Chmn\r\n                   Gesell, 4 Jun 63, Gesell Collection, J. F. Kennedy\r\n                   Library.]\r\n\r\nGesell saw the reforms at Pensacola as a direct result of his own\r\nsuggestion to a commander. He seemed unaware that his remarks to Fay\r\nhad set in motion a chain of action behind the scenes. In the weeks\r\nfollowing, black servicemen were moved from the substandard segregated\r\nhousing to integrated Navy-controlled housing both on and off base.\r\nThe local commander also arranged for the desegregation of some\r\noff-base social facilities in a effort to improve black morale.[21-46]\r\nIf the changes at Pensacola appear more closely related to the\r\ncommittee's political clout in Washington than to the commander's\r\ninterest in reform, they also demonstrate the power for reform that\r\nthe commander could exercise. This was the committee's main point,\r\nthat equal opportunity was a command responsibility.[21-47] But it\r\nwould be hard to sell in the Department of Defense where, as Gesell\r\nhimself later admitted, resistance to what was perceived as a\r\npolitical matter was common to most American military officers.[21-48]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-46: Ltr, Under SecNav to Chmn Gesell, 5\r\n                   Jun 63, copy in Gesell Collection, J.

Kennedy\r\n                   Library; see also Memo, Under SecNav for SecNav, 13\r\n                   Sep 63, sub: NAS Pensacola, SecNav file 5420\r\n                   (1179), GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-47: \"Initial Rpt,\" p. 52.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-48: Interv, author with Gesell, 3 Nov\r\n                   74.]\r\n\r\nThe most controversial recommendation, however, was that the armed\r\nforces should, when necessary, exercise economic sanctions against\r\nrecalcitrant businesses. In the name of troop morale and military\r\nefficiency, the committee wanted commanders to put public\r\naccommodations off limits for all servicemen, and it wanted the\r\nSecretary of Defense, as a last resort, to close the military\r\ninstallations in communities that persisted in denying black\r\nservicemen their civil rights.[21-49] Again, Gesell elaborated on the\r\npower of base commanders and recommended tactics.\r\n\r\n     There was also much that they could do in the community to\r\n     improve the lot of their blacks. If only they were sensitive to\r\n     the situation.... For example, we visited the local community\r\n     leaders. I would put it to the local banker who held the mortgage\r\n     on the local bowling alley: \"what would you do if you were a\r\n     commander and some of your men were barred from the local bowling\r\n     alley?\" He got the point and the alley outside the base was\r\n     desegregated overnight. To another I said, \"you know, I'm just a\r\n     lawyer down here on a temporary job, and I can only talk with you\r\n     about these things. But you can't tell about those guys in\r\n     Washington. They will have to be closing some bases soon. Now put\r\n     yourself in their shoes. Which would you shut, those bases that\r\n     don't have race problems or those that do?\" Again, they got the\r\n     point. In other words, an implied economic threat by the\r\n     commander would work well. Hell, the commanders were always\r\n     getting good citizenship awards and ignoring the major\r\n     citizenship problem of the era. Commanders were local heroes, and\r\n     they had plenty of influence. They use it. The trouble was most\r\n     commanders were ignorant of the ferment among their own men on\r\n     this subject. In all my trips I hinted at sanctions and base  (p. 544)\r\n     closings. The dutch uncle approach. I wanted the commanders\r\n     to do the same. I talked economics to the community leaders. It\r\n     opened their eyes. The commanders could do the same.[21-50]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-49: \"Initial Rpt,\" pp. 68-71.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-50: Interv, author with Gesell, 13 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nThe committee further refined its concepts of economic sanctions\r\nduring the course of its hearings. Commanders were frequently quizzed\r\non the probable effects of the imposition of off-limits sanctions or\r\nbase closings.[21-51] Despite the reluctance of most commanders to\r\ninvoke sanctions, committee members, assuming that no community would\r\nlong persist in a social order detrimental to its economic welfare,\r\ncame to the belief that ultimately only a firm and uncompromising\r\npolicy of economic sanctions would eliminate off-base discrimination.\r\nThe committee was obviously aware of the controversial aspects of its\r\nrecommendation, and it stressed that the department's objective should\r\nalways be \"the preservation of morale, not the punishment of local\r\ncommunities which have a tradition of segregation.\"[21-52]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-51: Memo for Rcd, Dep for Manpower,\r\n                   Personnel, & Organization, USAF, 14 Nov 62, sub:\r\n                   Meeting of President's Committee on Equal\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Forces, SecAF files.\r\n                   Deputy Goode's assumptions about the committee's\r\n                   thinking were later confirmed in its \"Initial Rpt,\"\r\n                   pages 68-71, and in author's interview with Gesell\r\n                   on 13 May 1972.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-52: \"Initial Rpt,\" p. 70.]\r\n\r\nMindful of the wish expressed by the White House staff that a report\r\nbe submitted by mid-1963, the committee, acting unanimously, completed\r\non 13 June 1963 an initial report on discrimination in the services\r\nand the local community, postponing the results of its time-consuming\r\nand less-pressing investigation of the National Guard and overseas\r\nposts until a later date.[21-53] Complete accord among the members had\r\nnot been automatic. The chairman later recalled that the group's black\r\nmembers had remained somewhat aloof during the months of\r\ninvestigation, perhaps because at first they felt the report might be\r\na whitewash of executive policy, but that they became \"enthusiastic\"\r\nwhen they read his draft and quickly joined in the preparation of the\r\nfinal version.[21-54]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-53: Ltr, Gesell to President Kennedy, 13\r\n                   Jun 63, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-54: Interv, author with Gesell, 13 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nThe reason for this enthusiasm was a report that faithfully reflected\r\nthe realities of discrimination suffered by black servicemen and\r\nproposed solutions based on conclusions drawn by the members from\r\ntheir months of discussion and investigation. The committee's\r\nconclusions and recommendations were the natural reaction of a group\r\nof humane and sensible men to the overwhelming evidence of continued\r\ndiscrimination against black servicemen. National policy, the\r\ncommittee told the President, required that this discrimination be\r\neliminated, for\r\n\r\n     equal opportunity for the Negro will exist only when it is\r\n     possible for him to enter upon a career of military service with\r\n     assurance that his acceptance and his progress will be in no way\r\n     impeded by reason of his color. Clearly, distinctions based on\r\n     race prevent full utilization of Negro military personnel and are\r\n     inconsistent with the objectives of our democratic\r\n     society.[21-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-55: \"Initial Rpt,\" p. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe committee wanted responsibility for eliminating these color    (p. 545)\r\ndistinctions in the services shifted to the local commander.\r\nCommanders, it believed, needed to improve their communication with\r\nblack servicemen and should be \"held accountable to discover and\r\nremedy discrimination\" in their commands. The committee, in short,\r\nwanted racial sensitivity made a function of command.\r\n\r\nCommand responsibility for equal opportunity, the committee\r\nemphasized, was particularly important \"in the area of most pressing\r\nconcern, off-base discrimination.\" It wanted local commanders to\r\nattack discrimination in the community by seeking the voluntary\r\ncompliance of local businessmen and by establishing biracial community\r\ncommittees. The committee asserted that despite the services' claims\r\nto the contrary the Department of Defense had made no serious effort\r\nto achieve off-base compliance with its anti-discrimination measures\r\nthrough voluntary action. Commanders had been given little guidance\r\nthus far, and a carefully planned program of voluntary action should\r\nbe given a chance. If it failed, commanders should be able to employ\r\nsanctions against the offending businesses; if sanctions failed, the\r\nservices should consider closing installations in offending areas. The\r\ncommittee again stressed the need to fix responsibility for the\r\nprogram on local commanders. A commander's performance should be\r\nmonitored and rated, and offices should be established in the\r\nDepartment of Defense and in the individual services to devise\r\nprograms, monitor their progress, and bring base commanders into close\r\nworking relationship with other interested and responsible federal\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nAlthough their recommendations were later excoriated by critics as a\r\nradical usurpation of state sovereignty and a threat to civil\r\nliberties, the committee had meant only to provide a graduated\r\nsolution to a national defense problem. Let reform begin with the\r\nlocal commander's improving conditions on his base and pressing for\r\nvoluntary changes in the local community. Only when this tactic\r\nfailed--and the committee predicted that failure would be a rare\r\noccurrence--should the services employ economic sanctions.\r\n\r\nA firm philosophical assumption underlay all these recommendations.\r\nThe committee believed that the armed forces, a worldwide symbol of\r\nAmerican society, had to be the leader in the quest for racial\r\njustice. Social reform, therefore, both within the services and where\r\nit affected servicemen in the community beyond, was a legitimate\r\nmilitary function. To the extent that these reforms were successful,\r\nthe armed forces would not only be protecting the civil rights of\r\nblack servicemen but also providing a standard against which civilian\r\nsociety could measure its conduct and other nations could judge the\r\ncountry's adherence to its basic principles.[21-56]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-56: Ibid., pp. 92-93.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reaction to a New Commitment_\r\n\r\nThe Gesell Committee's conclusion that discrimination in the community\r\nwas tied to military efficiency meshed well with the civil rights\r\nphilosophy of the New Frontier. Responding to the committee's      (p. 546)\r\nreport, President Kennedy cited \"the interests of national defense,\r\nnational policy and basic considerations of human decency\" to justify\r\nhis administration's interest in opening public accommodations and\r\nhousing to black servicemen. He considered it proper to ask the\r\n\"military community to take a leadership role\" in the matter and asked\r\nSecretary McNamara to review the committee's recommendations.[21-57]\r\nThe secretary, in turn, personally asked the service secretaries to\r\ncomment on the recommendations and assigned the Deputy Under Secretary\r\nof the Army (Manpower), Alfred B. Fitt, to act as coordinator and draw\r\nup the Defense Department's reply.[21-58]\r\n\r\n     The comments thus solicited revealed that some of McNamara's\r\n     senior subordinates had not been won over by the committee's\r\n     arguments that the services should take an active role in\r\n     community race relations.[21-59] The sticking point at all levels\r\n     involved two important recommendations: the rating of commanders\r\n     on their handling of racial matters and the use of economic\r\n     sanctions. In regard to the proposal to close bases in\r\n     communities that persisted in racial discrimination, the\r\n     Secretary of the Navy said bluntly: \"Do not concur. Base siting\r\n     is based upon military requirements.\"[21-60] These officials\r\n     promised that commanders would press for voluntary compliance,\r\n     but for more aggressive measures they preferred to wait for the\r\n     passage of federal legislation--they had in mind the\r\n     administration's civil rights bill then being considered by\r\n     Congress--which would place the primary responsibility for the\r\n     protection of a serviceman's civil rights in another federal\r\n     department. The Secretary of the Air Force suggested that the\r\n     services continue to plan, but defer action on the committee's\r\n     recommendations until Congress acted on the civil rights\r\n     bill.[21-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-57: Ltr, President to SecDef, 21 Jun 63,\r\n                   copy in CMH. The President also sent the\r\n                   committee's report to the Vice President for\r\n                   comment. Indicative of the Pentagon's continuing\r\n                   influence in the committee's work, the Kennedy\r\n                   letter had been drafted by Gesell and Yarmolinsky;\r\n                   see Memo, Yarmolinsky for White, 8 Jun 63, White\r\n                   Collection, J.

Noting, for\r\nexample, that the services wanted to do their own monitoring of their\r\ncommander's performance, Fitt agreed this would be acceptable so long\r\nas the Secretary of Defense could monitor the monitors. Adding that\r\nofficers, like other human beings, tended to concentrate on the tasks\r\nthat would be reviewed by superiors, he wanted to see a judgment of a\r\ncommander's ability to handle discrimination matters included in   (p. 547)\r\nthe narrative portion of his efficiency report. On the question of\r\nsanctions, Fitt pointed out to McNamara that the services now\r\nunderstood that their equal opportunity responsibilities extended\r\nbeyond the limits of the military reservation but that several of\r\ntheir objections to the use of sanctions were sound. He suggested the\r\nsecretary approve the use of sanctions in discrimination cases but\r\nplace severe restraints on their imposition, restricting the decision\r\nto the secretary's office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED FITT.]\r\n\r\nThis suggestion no doubt pleased McNamara. Although the committee's\r\nrecommendations might be the logical outcome of its investigations, in\r\nthe absence of a strong federal civil rights law even a sympathetic\r\nsecretary of defense could not accept such radical changes in the\r\nservices' community relations programs without reservations. Nor, as\r\nGesell later admitted, could a secretary of defense chance the serious\r\ncompromise to the administration's effort to win passage of such a law\r\nthat could be caused by some \"too gung-ho\" commander left to impose\r\nsanctions on his own.[21-62] The secretary agreed with the committee\r\nthat much could be done by individual commanders in a voluntary way to\r\nchange the customs of the local community, and he wanted the emphasis\r\nto be kept there.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-62: Interv, author with Gesell, 13 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nUnlike Gesell, who doubted the effectiveness of directives and\r\nexecutive edicts (\"trouble-making\" he called them), McNamara\r\nconsidered equal opportunity matters \"an executive job that should be\r\nhandled by the Departments, using directives.\"[21-63] Armed with the\r\ncommittee's call for action and the services' agreement in principle,\r\nMcNamara turned to the preparation of a directive, the main outline of\r\nwhich he transmitted to the President on 24 July after review by Burke\r\nMarshall in the Department of Justice. As McNamara explained to\r\nMarshall, \"I would like to be able to tell him [the President] that\r\nyou have read same and offer no objection.\"[21-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-63: Ibid., and with McNamara, 11 May 72.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-64: Memo, McNamara for Burke Marshall\r\n                   (ca. 20 Jul 63), Marshall Papers, J. F. Kennedy\r\n                   Library.]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Defense promised the President to \"eliminate the\r\nexceptions and guard the continuing reality\" of racial equality in the\r\nservices. In the light of the committee's conclusion that off-base\r\ndiscrimination reduced military effectiveness, he pledged that \"the\r\nmilitary departments will take a leadership role in combating\r\ndiscrimination wherever it affects the military effectiveness\" of\r\nservicemen. McNamara admitted having reservations about some of    (p. 548)\r\nthe committee's recommendations, especially the closing of bases\r\nnear communities that constantly practiced discrimination; such\r\nclosings, he declared, were not feasible \"at this time.\" Nevertheless\r\nhe agreed with the committee that off-limits sanctions should be\r\navailable to the services, for \"certainly the damage to military\r\neffectiveness from off-base discrimination is not less than that\r\ncaused by off-base vice, as to which the off-limits sanction is quite\r\ncustomary.\"[21-65] He failed to add that even though sanctions against\r\nvice were regularly applied by the local commander, sanctions against\r\ndiscrimination would be reserved to higher authority.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-65: Idem for President, 24 Jul 63, copy\r\n                   in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe directive, in reality an outline of the Department of Defense's\r\ncivil rights responsibilities and the prototype of subsequent\r\nsecretarial orders dealing with race, was published on 26 July 1963,\r\nthe fifteenth anniversary of Harry Truman's executive order. It read\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n     _II. Responsibilities._\r\n\r\n     A. Office of the Secretary of Defense:\r\n\r\n     1. Pursuant to the authority vested in the Secretary of Defense\r\n     and the provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as\r\n     amended, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) is hereby\r\n     assigned responsibility and authority for promoting equal\r\n     opportunity for members of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n     In the performance of this function he shall (a) be the\r\n     representative of the Secretary of Defense in civil rights\r\n     matters, (b) give direction to programs that promote equal\r\n     opportunity for military personnel, (c) provide policy guidance\r\n     and review policies, regulations and manuals of the military\r\n     departments, and (d) monitor their performance through periodic\r\n     reports and visits to field installations.\r\n\r\n     2. In carrying out the functions enumerated above, the Assistant\r\n     Secretary of Defense (Manpower) is authorized to establish the\r\n     Office of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civil Rights).\r\n\r\n     B. The Military Departments:\r\n\r\n     1. The military departments shall, with the approval of the\r\n     Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower), issue appropriate\r\n     instructions, manuals and regulations in connection with the\r\n     leadership responsibility for equal opportunity, on and off base,\r\n     and containing guidance for its discharge.\r\n\r\n     2. The military departments shall institute in each service a\r\n     system for regularly reporting, monitoring and measuring progress\r\n     in achieving equal opportunity on and off base.\r\n\r\n     C. Military Commanders:\r\n\r\n     Every military commander has the responsibility to oppose\r\n     discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents\r\n     and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under\r\n     his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they\r\n     may live or gather in off-duty hours. In discharging that\r\n     responsibility a commander shall not, except with the prior\r\n     approval of the Secretary of his military department, use the\r\n     off-limits sanction in discrimination cases arising within the\r\n     United States.[21-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-66: DOD Dir 5120.36, 26 Jul 63.]\r\n\r\nAfter some thirty months in office, Robert McNamara had made a     (p. 549)\r\nmost decisive move in race relations. In the name of fulfilling\r\nHarry Truman's pledge of equal treatment and opportunity he announced\r\nan aggressive new policy. Not only would the department work to\r\neliminate discrimination in the armed forces, but when servicemen were\r\naffected it would work in the community as well. Even more ominous to\r\nthe secretary's critics was the fact that the new policy revealed\r\nMcNamara's willingness, under certain circumstances, to use the\r\ndepartment's economic powers to force these changes. This directive\r\nmarked the beginning of McNamara's most active period of participation\r\nin the civil rights revolution of the 1960's.\r\n\r\nBut the secretary's move did not escape strong criticism. The\r\ndirective was denounced as infamous and shocking, as biased,\r\nimpractical, undemocratic, brutally authoritarian, and un-American. If\r\nfollowed, critics warned, it would set the military establishment at\r\nwar with society, inject the military into civilian political\r\ncontroversies in defiance of all traditions to the contrary, and\r\nburden military commanders with sociological tasks beyond their powers\r\nand to the detriment of their military mission.[21-67]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-67: Alfred B.

It is a tragic event when the Federal\r\nGovernment is again trying to bring Reconstruction Days into the\r\nSouth. Again the military is being used to bring this about.\" Did\r\nbusinesses not have the right to choose their customers? Did local\r\nauthorities not have the right to enforce the law in their\r\ncommunities? And surely the white soldier deserved the freedom to\r\nchoose his associates.[21-68] Another correspondent reproached\r\nMcNamara: \"you have, without conscience and with total disregard for\r\nthe honorable history of the Military of our Great Nation, signed our\r\nfreedom away.\" And still another saw her white supremacy menaced: \"We\r\nhave a bunch of mad dogs in Washington and if you and others like you\r\nare not stopped, our children will curse us. We don't want black\r\ngrandchildren and we won't have them. If you want to dance with\r\nthem--you have two legs, start dancing.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-68: Ltr to SecDef, 29 Jul 63.

The Senate debated the subject on 31 July; the House on 7\r\nAugust. During lengthy sessions on those days, opponents cast the\r\ncontroversy in the familiar context of states' rights, arguing that\r\nconstitutional and legal points were involved. As Congressman Durward\r\nG. Hall of Missouri put it: \"The recommendations made in the report\r\nand in the directive indicate a narrowness of vision which, in seeing\r\nonly the civil rights issue, has blinded itself to the question of\r\nwhether it is proper to use the Armed Forces to enforce a moral or\r\nsocial, rather than a legal, issue in the civilian sector.\"[21-71]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-70: Ltr, Fitt to author, 22 May 72.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-71: _Congressional Record_, 88th Cong.,\r\n                   1st sess., vol. 109, p. 14350.]\r\n\r\nOpponents argued generally that the directive represented government\r\nby fiat, an unprecedented extension of executive power that imposed\r\nthe armed forces on civilian society in a new and illegal way. If the\r\nadministration was already empowered to protect the civil rights of\r\nsome citizens, why, they asked, was it pushing so hard for a civil\r\nrights bill? The fact was, several legislators argued, the Department\r\nof Defense was interfering with the civil rights of businessmen and\r\npracticing a crude form of economic blackmail.[21-72]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-72: Ibid., pp. 13778-87, 14349-56.]\r\n\r\nCritics also discussed the directive in terms of military efficiency.\r\nThe secretary had given the commanders a new mission, Senator John\r\nStennis of Mississippi noted, that \"can only be detrimental to\r\nmilitary tradition, discipline, and morale.\" Elaborating on this idea,\r\nCongressman L. Mendel Rivers of South Carolina predicted that the new\r\npolicy would destroy the merit promotion system. Henceforth, Rivers\r\nforecast, advancement would depend on acceptance of integration;\r\nhenceforth, racial quotas would \"take the place of competence for\r\npurposes of promotion.\" Others were alarmed at the prospect of civil\r\nrights advisers on duty at each base and outside the regular chain of\r\ncommand. This outrage, Congressman H. R. Gross of Iowa charged, \"would\r\ncreate the biggest army of snoopers and informers that the military\r\nhas ever heard of.\"\r\n\r\nSome legislators saw sinister things afoot in the Pentagon. Senator\r\nHerman E. Talmadge of Georgia thought he recognized a return to the\r\nmilitary districting of Reconstruction days, and Congressman F. Edward\r\nHebert of Louisiana warned that \"everybody should be prepared for the\r\nmidnight knock on the door.\" Congressman Otto E. Passman of Louisiana\r\nthought it most likely that Attorney General Kennedy was behind the\r\nwhole thing; \"a tragic state of affairs,\" he said, if the Justice\r\nDepartment was directing \"the missions of the Military Establishment.\"\r\nCongressman Hebert found yet another villain in the piece. Adam\r\nYarmolinsky, whom he incorrectly identified as the author of the\r\nMcNamara directive, had, Hebert accused, \"one objective in mind--with\r\nan almost sataniclike zeal--the forced integration of every facet of\r\nthe American way of life, using the full power of the Department of\r\nDefense to bring about this change.\"[21-73] In line with these     (p. 551)\r\nsuspicions, some legislators reported that the secretary's new civil\r\nrights deputy, Alfred B. Fitt, was circulating among southern\r\nsegregationist businessmen with, in Senator Barry M. Goldwater's\r\nwords, \"a dossier gleaned from Internal Revenue reports.\" Senator\r\nStennis suspected that the Secretary of Defense had come under the\r\ninfluence of \"obscure men,\" and he warned against their revolutionary\r\nstrategy: \"It had been apparent for some time that the more extreme\r\nexponents of revolutionary civil rights action have wanted to use the\r\nmilitary in a posture of leadership to bring about desegregation\r\noutside the boundaries of military bases.\"[21-74]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-73: Quotes are from ibid., pp. 13778,\r\n                   13780, 14345-46, 14349, 14351, 14352.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-74: Ibid., Senate, 31 Jul 63, pp. 13779,\r\n                   13783.]\r\n\r\nThe congressional critics had a strategy of their own. They would try\r\nto persuade McNamara to rescind or modify his directive, and, failing\r\nthat, they would try to change the new defense policy by law. Senators\r\nGoldwater, J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, and Robert C. Byrd of\r\nWest Virginia, along with some of their constituents, debated with\r\nMcNamara while no less than the chairman of the House Armed Services\r\nCommittee, Carl Vinson of Georgia, introduced a bill aimed at\r\noutlawing all integration activity by military officers.[21-75] Their\r\ncampaign came to naught because the new policy had its own supporters\r\nin Congress,[21-76] and the great public outcry against the directive,\r\nso ardently courted by its congressional opponents, failed to\r\nmaterialize. Judging by the press, the public showed little interest\r\nin the Gesell Committee's report and comment on the secretary's\r\ndirective was regional, with much of it coming from the southern\r\npress. Certainly the effect of the directive could not compare with\r\nthe furor set off by the Truman order in 1948.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-75: Congressional letters critical of the\r\n                   directive can be found in DASD (CR) and SD files,\r\n                   1963.

Intense discussion of\r\n                   the constitutionality of the directive and of\r\n                   Vinson's bill took place among department officials\r\n                   during September and October 1963.

The media reaction\r\nalso suggested that prolonged attacks against the committee and the\r\ndirective were for hometown consumption and not a serious effort to\r\nreverse policy. In effect a last hurrah for the congressional\r\nopponents of integration in the armed forces, the attacks failed to\r\nbudge the Secretary of Defense and marked the end of serious\r\ncongressional attempts to influence armed forces racial policy.[21-77]\r\nThe threat of congressional opposition, at times real and sometimes\r\nimagined, had discouraged progressive racial policies in the\r\nDepartment of Defense for over a quarter of a century. Its abrupt and\r\npublic demise robbed the traditionalists in the Department of      (p. 552)\r\nDefense of a cherished excuse for inaction.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-77: A late victim of the anticivil rights\r\n                   forces in Congress was Adam Yarmolinsky.

One cause of this criticism\r\n                   was his connection with the Gesell Committee. See\r\n                   Mary McGrory, \"A Southern Hatchet Fell,\" Washington\r\n                   _Star_, August 10, 1964.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gesell Committee: Final Report_\r\n\r\nWhile the argument over the McNamara directive raged, the Gesell\r\nCommittee worked quietly if intermittently on the final segment of its\r\ninvestigation, the status of blacks stationed overseas and in the\r\nNational Guard. President Kennedy's death in November 1963 introduced\r\nan element of uncertainty in a group serving at the pleasure of the\r\nChief Executive. Special Presidential Counsel Lee C. White arranged\r\nfor Gesell to meet with President Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gesell\r\noffered to disband the committee if Johnson wished. The President left\r\nit in being. As Gesell later observed: \"The committee felt that\r\nJohnson understood us and our work in a way better than Kennedy who\r\nhad no clear idea on how to go with the race issue. We had no trouble\r\nwith Johnson who could have stopped us if he wanted.\"[21-78]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-78: The quote is from author's interview\r\n                   with Gesell on 13 May 1972. See also Ltr, White to\r\n                   Gesell, 8 Jan 64, and Memo, Gesell for Members of\r\n                   the Committee, 26 Feb 64, both in Gesell\r\n                   Collection, J. F. Kennedy Library.]\r\n\r\nThe committee's operations became even more informal in this final\r\nstage. Its investigations completed, its staff dissolved, and its\r\nmembers (now one man short with the resignation of Nathaniel Colley)\r\nscattered, the committee operated out of Gesell's law office. He was\r\nalmost exclusively responsible for its final report.[21-79] This\r\ninformality masked the protracted negotiations that the committee\r\nconducted with the National Guard Bureau over the persistent exclusion\r\nof Negroes. It also masked the solid investigation by individual\r\ncommittee members and the voluminous evidence gathered by the staff in\r\nsupport of the group's final report.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-79: Memo, Gesell for Members of the\r\n                   Committee, 26 Feb 64.]\r\n\r\nThese investigations and the documentary evidence again confirmed the\r\nfindings of the Civil Rights Commission, although the Gesell\r\nCommittee's emphasis was different. It dismissed the problem of\r\nassignment of Negroes to overseas stations. The percentage of Negroes,\r\nboth officers and men, sent overseas approximated their percentage in\r\nthe continental United States, and with rare and \"understandable\"\r\nexceptions--it cited South Africa--overseas assignments in the armed\r\nforces were made routinely without regard for race.[21-80] The\r\ncommittee also quickly dismissed the problem of discrimination on\r\noverseas bases, which it considered \"minimal,\" and as in the United\r\nStates chiefly the result of poor communication between commanders and\r\nmen. The group concentrated instead on discrimination off base,\r\nespecially in Germany. Back from a firsthand look in April 1964,\r\nBenjamin Muse reported that local American commanders seemed unwilling\r\nto take the matter seriously, but he considered it delicate and\r\ncomplex, principally because prejudice had been most often introduced\r\nby American servicemen. He suggested that off-limits sanctions should\r\nalso be imposed in Germany but \"only after consultation and on a   (p. 553)\r\nbasis of mutual understanding with German municipal authorities.\"[21-81]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-80: The President's Committee on Equal\r\n                   Opportunity in the Armed Forces, \"Final Report:\r\n                   Military Personnel Stationed Overseas and\r\n                   Membership and Participation in the National Guard,\r\n                   November 1964\" (hereafter cited as \"Final Report\"),\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-81: Ltr, Muse to Gesell, 23 Apr 64,\r\n                   Gesell Collection, J. F. Kennedy Library.]\r\n\r\nThe committee wanted the recommendations on off-base discrimination\r\ncontained in its initial report also applied overseas. Ignoring the\r\noft made distinction about the guest status of overseas service, it\r\nwanted the Department of State enlisted in a campaign against\r\ndiscrimination in public accommodations, including the use of\r\noff-limits sanctions when necessary. The committee also called for a\r\ncontinuing review to insure equal opportunity in assignments to\r\nattache and mission positions.\r\n\r\nThe committee devoted the largest portion of its final report to the\r\nNational Guard, \"the only branch of the Armed Forces,\" it told\r\nPresident Johnson, \"which has not been fully integrated.\"[21-82]\r\nChairman Gesell later reported that when the segregated state guards\r\nwere pressured they \"resisted like hell.\"[21-83] This resistance had a\r\npolitical dimension, but when Attorney General Kennedy chided that\r\n\"you are killing us with the Guard,\" Gesell replied that the committee\r\ntook orders from the President and would ignore the political problems\r\ninvolved. Nevertheless, before the committee issued its report Gesell\r\nsent the portions on the National Guard to the Justice Department for\r\ncomment, as one justice official noted, \"apparently ... in the hope\r\nthat its recommendation will not prove embarrassing to the\r\nadministration.\"[21-84]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-82: \"Final Report,\" p. 12.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-83: Interv, author with Gesell, 3 Nov\r\n                   74.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-84: The Kennedy quote is from the\r\n                   author's interview with Gesell on 13 May 1972. The\r\n                   Justice Department quote is from Memo, Gordon A.\r\n                   Martin (Dept of Justice) for Burke Marshall, 26 Jul\r\n                   63, sub: Proposed Gesell Cmte Rpt on the National\r\n                   Guard, Marshall Papers, J. F. Kennedy Library.]\r\n\r\nThe committee admitted that its investigation of the National Guard\r\nwas incomplete because of the variation in state systems and the\r\nabsence of statistical data on recruitment, assignment, and promotion\r\nin some state guards. It had no doubt, however, of the central premise\r\nthat discrimination existed. For example, until 1963 ten states with\r\nlarge black populations had no black guardsmen at all. Membership in\r\nthe guard, the committee concluded, was a distinct advantage for some\r\nindividuals, providing the chance to perform their military obligation\r\nwithout a lengthy time away from home or work. Because of the peculiar\r\nrelationship between the reserve and regular systems, National Guard\r\nservice had important advantages in retirement benefits for others.\r\nThese advantages and benefits should, in simple fairness, be open to\r\nall, but beyond the basic constitutional rights involved there were\r\npractical reasons for federal insistence on integration. The committee\r\naccepted the National Guard Bureau's conclusion that, since guard\r\nunits were subject to integration when federalized, their morale and\r\ncombat efficiency would be improved if their members were accustomed\r\nto service with Negroes in all ranks during training.[21-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-85: \"Final Report,\" pp. 19-20.]\r\n\r\nThe committee stressed executive initiatives. It wanted the President\r\nto declare the integration of the National Guard in the national\r\ninterest. It wanted the Department of Defense to demand pertinent  (p. 554)\r\nracial statistics from the states. For psychological advantages, it\r\nwanted the recent liberalization of guard policies toward Negroes\r\nwidely publicized. Again suggesting voluntary methods as a first step,\r\nthe committee called for the use of economic sanctions if voluntary\r\nmethods failed. The President should lose no time in applying the\r\nprovisions of the new Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbade the use\r\nof federal funds in discriminatory activities, to offending states. As\r\nit had been in the case of discrimination in local communities, the\r\ncommittee was optimistic about the success of voluntary compliance.\r\nCiting its own efforts and those of the National Guard Bureau,[21-86]\r\nthe committee reported that the last ten states to hold out had now\r\nbegun to integrate their guard units at least on a token basis. In\r\nfact, the committee's report had to be revised at the last minute\r\nbecause Alabama and Mississippi enrolled Negroes in their enlisted\r\nranks.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-86: The National Guard Bureau is a joint\r\n                   agency of the Departments of the Army and Air Force\r\n                   which acts as adviser to the service staffs on\r\n                   National Guard matters and as the channel of\r\n                   communication between the two departments and the\r\n                   state guards. The chief of the bureau is always a\r\n                   National Guard officer.]\r\n\r\nChairman Gesell circulated a draft report containing these findings\r\nand recommendations among committee members in September 1964.[21-87]\r\nHis colleagues suggested only minor revisions, although Whitney Young\r\nthought that some of the space spent on complimenting the services\r\ncould be better used to emphasize the committee's recommendations for\r\nfurther reform. He did not press the point but noted wryly: \"if we\r\nwere as sensitive about the feelings of the victims of discrimination\r\nas we are of the perpetuators, we wouldn't have most of these problems\r\nto begin with.\"[21-88] Maj. Gen. Winston P. Wilson, the Chief of the\r\nNational Guard Bureau, also reviewed the draft and found it \"entirely\r\nfair, temperate and well-founded.\"[21-89] The committee's final report\r\nwas sent to the President on 20 November 1964. A month later Johnson\r\nsent it along to McNamara with the request that he be kept informed on\r\nprogress of the negotiations between the secretary and the governors\r\non integration of the National Guard.[21-90]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-87: The draft was also sent for comment\r\n                   to the National Guard Bureau; see Ltr, Chief, NGB,\r\n                   to Gesell, 13 Nov 64, Gesell Collection, J.

It was, as a member of the Gesell\r\nCommittee later remarked, a task that only a group of independent\r\ncitizens reporting to the President could effectively suggest.[21-91]\r\nIn the end the committee did all that its sponsors could have wanted.\r\nIt confirmed the persistence of discrimination against black\r\nservicemen both on and off the military base and effectively tied that\r\ndiscrimination to troop morale and military efficiency. The        (p. 555)\r\ncommittee's conclusions, logically derived from the connection between\r\nmorale and efficiency, introduced a radically expanded concept of\r\nracial responsibility for the armed forces.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 21-91: Interv, author with Muse, 2 Mar 73.]\r\n\r\nAlthough many people strongly associate the Gesell Committee with the\r\nuse of economic coercion against race discrimination in the community,\r\nthe committee's emphasis was always on the local commander's role in\r\nachieving voluntary compliance with the department's equal opportunity\r\npolicies. Economic sanction was conceived of as a last resort. The\r\ndirective of the Secretary of Defense that endorsed these\r\nrecommendations was also denounced for embracing sanctions, although\r\nhere the charges were even less appropriate because the use of\r\nsanctions was severely circumscribed. It remained to be seen how far\r\ncommand initiative and voluntary compliance could be translated by the\r\nservices into concrete gains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22                                                         (p. 556)\r\n\r\nEqual Opportunity in the Military Community\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Secretary McNamara issued his equal opportunity directive in\r\n1963, all segregated public accommodations, schools, and even housing\r\nnear military reservations became potential targets of the Department\r\nof Defense's integration drive. This change in policy was substantive,\r\nbut the traditionalists who feared the sudden intrusion of the\r\nservices into local community affairs and the reformers who later\r\ncharged McNamara with procrastination missed the point. More than a\r\ndeclaration of racial principles, the directive was a guideline for\r\nthe progressive application of a series of administrative pressures.\r\nEndorsing the Gesell Committee's concept of command responsibility,\r\nMcNamara enjoined the local commander to oppose discrimination and\r\nfoster equal opportunity both on and off the military base. He also\r\nendorsed the committee's recommendation for the use of economic\r\nsanctions in cases where voluntary compliance could not be obtained.\r\nBy demanding the approval of the service secretaries for the use of\r\nsanctions, McNamara served notice that this serious application of the\r\ncommander's authority would be limited and infrequent. He avoided\r\naltogether the committee's call for closing military bases.\r\n\r\nThe secretary's critics overlooked the fact that no exact timetable\r\nwas set for the reforms outlined in the directive, and actually\r\nseveral factors were operating against precipitate action on\r\ndiscrimination outside the military reservation. Strong sentiment\r\nexisted among service officials for leaving off-base discrimination\r\nproblems to the Department of Justice, and, as early reactions to the\r\ncommittee report revealed, the committee's findings did little to\r\nalter these feelings. More important, the inclination to postpone the\r\nmore controversial aspects of the equal opportunity directive received\r\nsupport from the White House itself. Political wisdom dictated that\r\nthe Department of Defense refrain from any dramatic move in the civil\r\nrights field while Congress debated the civil rights bill, a primary\r\nlegislative goal of both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.\r\n\"Avoid civil rights spectaculars\" was the White House's word to the\r\nexecutive departments while the civil rights act hung fire.[22-1]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-1: Quoted in Ltr, Fitt to author, 22 May\r\n                   72; see also Interv, author with Jordan, 7 Jun 72.]\r\n\r\nThe lack of pressure by black servicemen and civil rights advocates\r\nlent itself to official procrastination. Civil rights organizations,\r\npreoccupied with racial unrest throughout the nation and anxious for\r\nthe passage of new civil rights legislation, seemed to lose some   (p. 557)\r\nof their intense interest in service problems. They paid scant\r\nattention to the directive beyond probing for the outer limits of the\r\nnew policy. In the months following the directive, officials of the\r\nNAACP and other organizations shot off a spate of requests for the\r\nimposition of off-limits sanctions against certain businesses and\r\nschools and in some cases even whole towns and cities.[22-2] When\r\nDefense Department officials made clear that sanctions were to be a\r\nlast, not first, resort and offered the cooperation of local\r\ncommanders for a joint effort against local discrimination through\r\nvoluntary compliance, the demands of the civil rights organizations\r\npetered out.[22-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-2: See Ltr, J.

One unsettling note: although\r\nfewer in number, the complaints were often addressed to the White\r\nHouse, the Justice Department, the civil rights organizations, or the\r\nSecretary of Defense, thus confirming the Gesell Committee's finding\r\nthat black servicemen continued to distrust the services' interest in\r\nor ability to administer justice.[22-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-4: Charles Moskos, \"Findings on American\r\n                   Military Establishment\" (Northeastern University,\r\n                   1967), quoted in Yarmolinsky, _The Military\r\n                   Establishment_, p. 343.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-5: For many examples of these racial\r\n                   complaints and their disposition, see DASD (CR)\r\n                   files, 1963-64, especially Access Nos. 68-A-1006\r\n                   and 68-A-1033.]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Defense's manpower staff processed all these\r\ncomplaints. It dismissed those considered unrelated to race but\r\nforwarded many to the individual services with requests for immediate\r\nremedial action. Significantly, those involving the violation of a\r\nserviceman's civil rights off base continued to be sent to the Justice\r\nDepartment for disposition. Defense Department officials themselves\r\nadjudicated the hundreds of discrimination cases involving civilian\r\nemployees.[22-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-6: The Assistant Secretary of Defense\r\n                   (Manpower) prepared a monthly compilation of all\r\n                   discrimination cases in the Department of Defense\r\n                   involving civilian employees. Originally requested\r\n                   by then Vice President Lyndon Johnson in his\r\n                   capacity as chairman of the President's Committee\r\n                   on Equal Opportunity in Employment in June 1962,\r\n                   the reports were continued after the Gesell\r\n                   Committee disbanded. The report for November 1963,\r\n                   for example, listed 144 cases of \"Contractor\r\n                   Complaints\" investigated and adjudicated and 159\r\n                   cases of \"In-House Complaints\" being processed in\r\n                   the Department of Defense. See Memo, ASD (M) for SA\r\n                   et al., 20 Dec 63, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nIn the weeks and months following publication of the equal opportunity\r\ndirective, official replies to the demands and complaints of black\r\nservicemen and their allies in the civil rights organizations\r\ncontinued to be carefully circumscribed. Whatever skepticism such\r\nrestricted application of the Gesell recommendations may have produced\r\namong the civil rights leaders, the department found itself\r\nsurprisingly free from outside pressure. It was able to set the pace\r\nof its own reform and to avoid meanwhile a clash with either       (p. 558)\r\nreformers or segregationists over major civil rights issues of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Creating a Civil Rights Apparatus_\r\n\r\nThe Defense Department could do little about discrimination either on\r\nor off the military reservation until it was better organized for the\r\ntask. The secretary needed new bureaucratic tools with which to\r\ndevelop new civil rights procedures, unite the disparate service\r\nprograms, and document whatever failures might occur. He created a\r\ncivil rights secretariat, assigning to his manpower assistant, Norman\r\nS. Paul,[22-7] the responsibility for promoting equal opportunity in\r\nthe armed forces. Although racial affairs had always been considered\r\namong the manpower secretary's general duties, with precedents\r\nreaching back through the Personnel Policy Board to World War II when\r\nAssistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy supervised the employment of\r\nblack troops, McNamara now significantly increased these\r\nresponsibilities. The assistant secretary would represent him \"in\r\ncivil rights matters,\" would direct the department's equal opportunity\r\nprograms, and would provide policy guidance for the military\r\ndepartments, reviewing their policies, regulations, instructions, and\r\nmanuals and monitoring their performance.[22-8] To carry out these\r\nfunctions, the Secretary of Defense authorized his assistant to create\r\na deputy assistant secretary for civil rights.[22-9] Again a precedent\r\nexisted for the secretary's move. In January 1963 Paul had assigned an\r\nassistant to coordinate the department's racial activities.[22-10] The\r\nreorganization transferred the person and duties of the secretary's\r\ncivilian aide, James C. Evans, to the Office of the Deputy Assistant\r\nSecretary for Civil Rights. The new organization was thus provided\r\nwith a pedigree traceable to World War I and the work of Emmett J.\r\nScott,[22-11] although Evans' move to the deputy's staff was the only\r\nconnection between Scott and that office. The civilian aides, limited\r\nby the traditionally indifferent attitudes of the services toward\r\nequal opportunity programs, had been used to advise civilian officials\r\non complaints from the black community, especially black servicemen,\r\nand to rationalize service policies for civil rights organizations.\r\nThe new civil rights office, reflecting McNamara's positive\r\nintentions, was organized to monitor and instruct military\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-7: Norman S.

(p. 559)\r\nHe might investigate discrimination and isolate its causes, but he\r\nenjoyed no independent power to reform service practices. His\r\nsubstantive dealings with the services had to be staffed through his\r\nsuperior, the Assistant Secretary for Manpower, a man to whom equal\r\nopportunity was but one of many problems and who might well question\r\nnew or aggressive civil rights tactics. Such an attitude was\r\nunderstandable in an official with little or no experience in civil\r\nrights matters and no day-to-day contact with civil rights operations.\r\nNorman Paul, whose experience was in legislative liaison, might also\r\nbe especially sensitive to the possibility of congressional or public\r\ncriticism.[22-12] Indicative of the assistant secretary's attitude\r\ntoward his civil rights deputy was the fact that the position was\r\nreorganized and retitled, with some significant corresponding changes\r\nin function each time, a bewildering five times in ten years.[22-13]\r\nTo add to the problems of the civil rights office, nine different men\r\nwere to occupy the deputy's position, three of them in the capacity of\r\nacting deputy, in that same decade.[22-14]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-12: Before assuming the manpower\r\n                   position, Norman Paul was the chief of legislative\r\n                   liaison for the Department of Defense.

Some wanted to enhance the\r\nprestige of the equal opportunity program by creating a separate\r\nassistant secretary for civil rights.[22-15] Such an official,\r\naccountable to the Secretary of Defense alone, would be free to direct\r\nthe services' racial activities and, they agreed, would also serve as\r\na highly visible symbol to servicemen and civil rights advocates alike\r\nof the department's determination to execute its new policy. Others,\r\nhowever, defended the existing organization, arguing that racial\r\ndiscrimination was a manpower problem, and the number of assistant\r\nsecretaries was fixed by law and the chance of congressional approval\r\nfor yet another manpower position was remote.[22-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-15: This solution was still being\r\n                   recommended a decade later; see Department of\r\n                   Defense, \"Report of the Task Force on the\r\n                   Administration of Military Justice in the Armed\r\n                   Forces,\" 30 Nov 72, vol.

Fitt\r\nthe first civil rights deputy. Since 1961 the Army's Deputy Under\r\nSecretary for Manpower, Fitt had recently been on loan to the Office\r\nof the Secretary of Defense to coordinate the department's responses\r\nto the Gesell Committee. He was the author of the equal opportunity\r\ndirective signed by McNamara, and his personal views on the subject,\r\nwhile consistent with those of Yarmolinsky and McNamara, were often\r\nexpressed in more advanced terms. Going beyond the usual arguments for\r\nequal treatment based on morale and military efficiency, Fitt      (p. 560)\r\nreferred to the black servicemen's struggle as a moral issue. He was\r\nglad, he later confessed, to be on the right side of such an issue,\r\nand he felt indebted to the positive racial policies of Kennedy and\r\nJohnson and their Secretary of Defense.[22-17] He quickly gathered\r\naround him a staff of like-minded experts who proceeded to their first\r\ntask, a review of the services' outline plans called for in the\r\nsecretary's directive.[22-18]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-17: Ltr, DASD (CR) to Gesell, 28 Jul 64,\r\n                   Gesell Collection, J.

All three services discussed new     (p. 561)\r\nprovisions for monitoring their equal opportunity programs, with the\r\nArmy including explicit provisions for the processing of servicemen's\r\nracial complaints. And to insure the coordination of equal opportunity\r\nmatters in future staff decisions, each service also announced (the\r\nNavy in a separate staff action) the formation of an equal opportunity\r\norganization in its military staff: an Equal Rights Branch in the\r\noffice of the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, an Equal\r\nOpportunity Group in the Air Force's Directorate of Personnel Planning\r\nto work in conjunction with its Secretary's Committee on Equal\r\nOpportunity, and an Ad Hoc Committee in the Navy's Bureau of\r\nPersonnel.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-19: Memos: Dep to SecAF for Manpower,\r\n                   Personnel, and Organization for ASD (M), 15 Aug 63,\r\n                   sub: Implementation of DOD Directive 5120.36; SA\r\n                   for ASD (M), 15 Aug 63, sub: Equal Opportunity in\r\n                   the Armed Forces; Under SecNav for ASD (M), 15 Aug\r\n                   63, sub: Outline Plan for Implementing Department\r\n                   of Defense Directive 5120.36, \"Equal Opportunity in\r\n                   the Armed Forces,\" dated 26 Jul 63. All in ASD (M)\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe outline plans revealed that the services entertained differing\r\ninterpretations of the McNamara call for command responsibility in\r\nequal opportunity matters. The Gesell Committee had considered this\r\nresponsibility of fundamental importance and wanted the local\r\ncommander held accountable and his activities in this area made part\r\nof his performance rating. There was some disagreement among manpower\r\nexperts on this point. How, one critic asked, could the services set\r\nup standards against which a commander's performance might be fairly\r\njudged? How could they insure that an overzealous commander might\r\nnot, in the interest of a higher efficiency report, upset\r\nanti-discrimination programs that called for subtle negotiation?[22-20]\r\nBut to Chairman Gesell the equal opportunity situation demanded\r\naction, and how could this demand be better impressed on the commander\r\nthan by the knowledge that his performance was being measured?[22-21]\r\nThe point of this argument, which the committee accepted, was that\r\nunless personal responsibility was fixed, policies and directives on\r\nequal opportunity were just so much rhetoric.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-20: Interv, author with Davenport, 2 Aug\r\n                   73, CMH files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-21: Interv, author with Gesell, 13 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nOnly the Army's outline plan explicitly adopted the committee's\r\ncontroversial recommendation that \"the effective performance of\r\ncommanders in this area will be considered along with other\r\nresponsibilities in determining his overall manner of duty\r\nperformance.\" The Navy equivocated. Commanders would \"monitor\r\ncontinually racial matters with a goal toward improvement.\" The\r\nInspectors General of the Navy and Marine Corps were \"instructed to\r\nappraise\" all command procedures. The Air Force expected base base\r\ncommanders to concern themselves with the welfare nondiscriminatory\r\ntreatment of its servicemen when they were away from the base, but it\r\nleft them considerable freedom in the matter. \"The military mission is\r\npredominant,\" the Air Force announced, and the local commander must be\r\ngiven wide latitude in dealing with discrimination cases since \"each\r\ncommunity presented a different situation for which local solutions\r\nmust be developed.\"\r\n\r\nThe decision by the Navy and Air Force to exempt commanders from\r\nexplicit responsibility in equal opportunity matters came after some\r\nsix months of soul-searching. Under Secretary of the Navy Fay agreed\r\nwith his superior that the Navy's equal opportunity \"image\" suffered\r\nin comparison to the other services and the percentage of Negroes in\r\nthe Navy and Marine Corps left much to be desired. But when        (p. 562)\r\nordered by Secretary Fred Korth to develop a realistic approach to\r\nequal opportunity in consultation with the Gesell Committee, Fay's\r\nresponse tended to ignore service shortcomings and, most significantly,\r\nfailed to fix responsibility for equal opportunity matters. He\r\nproposed to revise Navy instructions to provide for increased liaison\r\nbetween local commanders and community leaders and monitor civil\r\nrights cases involving naval personnel, but his response neither\r\ndiscussed new ways to increase job opportunities for Negroes nor\r\nmentioned making equal opportunity performance a part of the military\r\nefficiency rating system.[22-22] His elaborate provisions for\r\nmonitoring and reporting notwithstanding, his efforts appeared\r\nprimarily cosmetic.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-22: Memo, Under SecNav for SecNav, 7 Feb\r\n                   63, sub: Equal Opportunity in the Navy and Marine\r\n                   Corps, SecNav file 5420, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIGGING IN. _Men of M Company, 7th Marines, construct a\r\ndefense bunker during \"Operation Desoto,\" Vietnam._]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the Navy's image in the black community needed some\r\nrefurbishing. Despite substantial changes in the racial composition of\r\nthe Steward's Branch in recent years, Negroes continued to avoid naval\r\nservice, as a special Navy investigation later found, because \"they\r\nhave little desire to become stewards or cooks.\"[22-23] Fay believed\r\nthat the shortage of Negroes was part of a general problem shared by\r\nall the services. His public relations proposals were designed     (p. 563)\r\nto overcome the difficulty of attracting volunteers. His recommendations\r\nwere approved by Secretary Korth in February 1963 and disseminated\r\nthroughout the Navy and Marine Corps for execution.[22-24] With only\r\nminor modification they were also later submitted to the Secretary of\r\nDefense as the Navy's outline plan.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-23: Memo, David M.

The Chief of Naval Personnel admitted that\r\nthe Gesell Committee's charges against the service were \"to some\r\nextent\" justified and warned naval commanders that if they failed to\r\ntake a more positive approach to equal opportunity they would be\r\nordered to take actions difficult for both the Navy and the community.\r\nBetter \"palatable evolutionary progress,\" he counseled, than \"bitter\r\nrevolutionary change.\"[22-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-25: Ltr, Chief, NavPers, to CONUS\r\n                   District Cmdrs et al., 22 Apr 63, attached to Memo,\r\n                   Chief, NavPers, for Distribution List, 24 Apr 63,\r\n                   sub: President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in\r\n                   the Armed Forces, SecNav file 5420, GenRecsNav.]\r\n\r\nAir Force officials had also considered the problem of command\r\nresponsibility in the months before submitting their outline plan. As\r\nearly as December 1962, Under Secretary Joseph V. Charyk admitted the\r\npossibility of confusion over what the policy of base commanders\r\nshould be concerning off-base segregation. He proposed that the staff\r\nconsider certain \"minimum\" actions, including \"mandatory evaluation of\r\nall officers concerning their knowledge of this program and the extent\r\nto which they have complied with the policy of anti-discrimination.\"[22-26]\r\nSecretary Zuckert discussed Charyk's proposal with his assistants on\r\n23 January 1963. It was also considered by McNamara, who then passed\r\nit to the other services, calling on them to develop similar\r\nprograms.[22-27] Finally, Air Force officials discussed command\r\nresponsibility in preparing their critique of Gesell Committee\r\nrecommendations, and Secretary Zuckert informed Assistant Secretary of\r\nDefense Paul that \"the responsibility for this [the Air Force's\r\nanti-discrimination] program will be clearly designated down to base\r\nlevel.\"[22-28] Despite this attention, the subject of specific command\r\nresponsibility was not clearly delineated in the Air Force's outline\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-26: Memo, Actg SecAF CofSAF, 8 Dec 62,\r\n                   sub: Anti-Discrimination Policy in the Military\r\n                   Service, SecAF files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-27: Memo, SecDef for SA and Navy, 4 Mar\r\n                   63, sub: Anti-Discrimination Policy in the Military\r\n                   Service, copy in CMH.

Commenting on the committee's call for the\r\nappointment of a special officer at each base to transmit black\r\nservicemen's grievances to base commanders, Fitt acknowledged that\r\nmost Negroes were reluctant to complain, but said the services were\r\naware of this reluctance and had already devised means to overcome it.\r\nProblems in communication, he pointed out, were leadership problems,\r\nand commanders must be left free to find their own method of learning\r\nabout conditions in their commands. As for the committee's suggestion\r\nthat equal opportunity initiatives in the local community be made a\r\nconsideration in the promotion of the commander, the Defense\r\nDepartment had temporized. Such initiatives, Fitt explained, might be\r\nconsidered part of the commander's total performance, but it should\r\nnever be the governing factor in determining advancement.[30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-29: Memo, ASD (M) for Under SA et al., 13\r\n                   Sep 63, sub: DOD Directive 5120.36, 26 Jul 63,\r\n                   Equal Opportunity, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-30: Alfred B.

Each service had to prepare for commanders\r\nan instruction manual dealing with the discharge of their equal\r\nopportunity responsibilities, develop an equal opportunity information\r\nprogram for the periodic orientation of all personnel, and institute\r\nsome method of insuring that all new commanders promptly reviewed\r\nequal opportunity programs applicable to their commands. The secretary\r\nalso set deadlines for putting the plans into effect. The preparation\r\nof these comprehensive regulations and manuals, however, took much\r\nlonger than expected, a delay, Fitt admitted, that slowed equal\r\nopportunity progress to some extent.[22-31] In fact, it was not until\r\nJanuary 1965 that the last of the basic service regulations on equal\r\nopportunity was published.[22-32]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-31: Ltr, DASD (Civil Rights) to Gesell,\r\n                   30 Apr 64, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-32: AR 600-21, 2 Jul 64 (superseded by AR\r\n                   600-21, 18 Mar 65); AFR 35-78, 19 Aug 64\r\n                   (superseded in May 71); SecNav Instructions 5350.6,\r\n                   Jan 65, 5350.5A, 16 Dec 65, and 5370.7, 4 Mar 65.\r\n                   See also NAVSO P2483, May 65, \"A Commanding\r\n                   Officer's Guide for Establishing Minority Community\r\n                   Relations.\"]\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons for the delay. The first was the protracted\r\ncongressional debate over the civil rights bill. Some service\r\nofficials strongly supported the stand that off-base complaints of\r\nblack servicemen were chiefly the concern of the Justice Department.\r\nOn a more practical level, however, the Department of Defense was\r\nreluctant to issue new directives while legislation bearing directly\r\non discrimination affecting servicemen was being formulated. Accepting\r\nthese arguments, Paul postponed the services' submission of new\r\nregulations and manuals until the act assumed final form.\r\n\r\nThe delayed publication of the service regulations could also be\r\nblamed in part on the confusion that surrounded the announcement of a\r\nnew Defense policy on attendance at segregated meetings. The issue\r\narose in early 1964 when Fitt discovered some defense employees\r\naccepting invitations to participate in segregated affairs while\r\nothers refused on the basis of the secretary's equal opportunity\r\ndirectives. Inconsistency on such a delicate subject disturbed the\r\ncivil rights deputy. The services had fortuitously avoided several (p. 565)\r\npotentially embarrassing incidents when officials were invited to\r\nattend segregated functions, and Fitt warned Paul that \"if we don't\r\nerect a better safeguard than sheer chance, we're bound somewhere,\r\nsometime soon to look foolish and insensitive.\"[22-33] He wanted\r\nMcNamara to issue a policy statement on the subject, admittedly a\r\ndifficult task because it would be hard to write and would require\r\nWhite House clearance that might not be forthcoming. For the short run\r\nFitt wanted to deal with the problem at a regular staff meeting where\r\nhe could discuss the matter and coordinate his strategy without the\r\ndelay of publishing new regulations.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-33: Memo, DASD (CR) for Paul, 10 Feb 64,\r\n                   sub: Official Attendance at Segregated Meetings,\r\n                   ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, anxiety over White House approval proved groundless.\r\n\"The President has on numerous occasions made clear his view that\r\nFederal officials should not participate in segregated meetings,\"\r\nWhite House Counsel Lee C. White informed all department and agency\r\nheads, and he suggested that steps be taken in each department to\r\ninform all employees.[22-34] The Deputy Secretary of Defense, Cyrus R.\r\nVance, complied on 7 July by issuing a memorandum to the services\r\nprohibiting participation in segregated meetings. Adding to the text\r\nprepared in the White House, he ordered that this prohibition be\r\nincorporated in regulations then being prepared, a move that\r\nnecessitated additional staffing of the developing equal opportunity\r\nregulations.[22-35]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-34: Memo, Assoc Spec Counsel to President\r\n                   for Heads of Departments and Agencies, 12 Jun 64,\r\n                   sub: Further Participation at Segregated Meetings,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-35: Memo, Dep SecDef for Secys of\r\n                   Military Departments et al., 7 Jul 64, sub: Federal\r\n                   Participation at Segregated Meetings, SD 291.2. The\r\n                   Army's regulation, published on 2 July, five days\r\n                   before Secretary Vance's memorandum, was\r\n                   republished on 18 May 1965 to include the\r\n                   prohibition against segregated meetings and other\r\n                   new policies. The Navy prepared a special Secretary\r\n                   of Navy instruction (5720.38, 30 Jul 1964) on the\r\n                   subject.]\r\n\r\nObjections to the prohibition were forthcoming. Continuing on a tack\r\nhe had pursued for several years, the Air Force Deputy Special\r\nAssistant for Manpower, Personnel, and Organization, James P. Goode,\r\nobjected to the application of the Vance memorandum to base\r\ncommanders. These men had to maintain good relations with community\r\nleaders, he argued, and good relations were best fostered by the\r\ncommander's joining local community organizations such as the Rotary\r\nClub and the Chamber of Commerce, which were often segregated. These\r\ncivic and social organizations offered an effective forum for\r\npublicizing the objectives of the Department of Defense, and to forbid\r\nthe commander's participation because of segregation would seriously\r\nreduce his local influence. Goode wanted the order \"clarified\" to\r\nexclude local community organizations from its coverage on the grounds\r\nthat including them would be \"detrimental to the best interests of all\r\nmilitary personnel and their dependents and would result in a\r\ncorresponding reduction in military effectiveness.\"[22-36] The Defense\r\nDepartment would have nothing to do with the idea. Such an exception to\r\nthe rule, the civil rights deputy declared, would not constitute a (p. 566)\r\nclarification, but rather a nullification of the order. The Air Force\r\nrequest was rejected.[22-37]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-36: Memo, James P. Goode for Dep SecDef,\r\n                   29 Sep 64, sub: Federal Participation at Segregated\r\n                   Meetings, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-37: Draft Memo, DASD (Civ Pers, Indus\r\n                   Rels, and CR) for Dep for Manpower, Personnel, and\r\n                   Organization, USAF, 7 Oct 64, sub: Federal\r\n                   Participation at Segregated Meetings.

Service officials argued that\r\ncommanders had always been allowed to execute racial policy without\r\nspecific instructions. They feared popular reaction to forceful\r\nregulations, and, in truth, they were already being subjected to\r\ncongressional criticism over minor provisions of the Gesell\r\nCommittee's report. Even the innocuous suggestion that officers be\r\nappointed to channel black servicemen's complaints was met with\r\ncharges of \"snooping\" and \"gestapo\" tactics.[22-38]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-38: Fitt, \"Remarks Before Civilian Aides\r\n                   Conference of the Secretary of the Army,\" 6 Mar\r\n                   64.]\r\n\r\nAlthough both the Gesell Committee and Secretary McNamara had made\r\nclear that careful direction was necessary, the manpower office of the\r\nDepartment of Defense temporized. Instead of issuing detailed\r\nguidelines to the services that outlined their responsibilities for\r\nenforcing the provision of the secretary's equal opportunity\r\ndirective, instead of demanding a strict accounting from commanders of\r\ntheir execution of these responsibilities, Paul asked the services for\r\noutline plans and then indiscriminately approved these plans even when\r\nthey passed over real accountability in favor of vaguely stated\r\nprinciples. The result was a lengthy period of bureaucratic confusion.\r\nProtected by the lack of specific instructions the services went\r\nthrough an Alfonse-Gaston routine, each politely refraining from\r\ncommitment to substantial measures while waiting to see how far the\r\nothers would go.[22-39]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-39: Interv, author with Evans, 23 Jul 73,\r\n                   CMH files.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fighting Discrimination Within the Services_\r\n\r\nThe immediate test for the services' belatedly organized civil rights\r\napparatus was the racial discrimination lingering within the armed\r\nforces themselves. The Civil Rights Commission and the Gesell\r\nCommittee had been concerned with the exceptions to the services'\r\ngenerally satisfactory equal opportunity record. It was these\r\nexceptions, such chronic problems as underrepresentation of Negroes in\r\nsome services, in the higher military grades, and in skilled military\r\noccupations, that continued to concern the Defense Department civil\r\nrights organization and the services as they tried to carry out\r\nMcNamara's directive. Seemingly minor compared to the discrimination\r\nfaced by black servicemen outside the military reservation, racial\r\nproblems within the military family and how the services dealt with\r\nthem would have direct bearing on the tranquility of the armed forces\r\nin the 1970's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LISTENING TO THE SQUAD LEADER. _Men of Company D, 21st\r\nInfantry, prepare to move out, Quang Tin Province, Vietnam._]\r\n\r\nTwo pressing needs, and obviously interrelated ones, were to       (p. 567)\r\nattract a greater number of young blacks to a military career and\r\nimprove the status of Negroes already in uniform. These were not easy,\r\nshort-term tasks. In the first place the Negro, ironically in view of\r\nthe services' now genuine desire to have him, was no longer so\r\ninterested in joining. As explained by Defense Department civil rights\r\nofficials, the past attitudes and practices of the services,\r\nespecially the treatment of Negroes during World War II, had created\r\namong black opinion-makers an indifference toward the services as a\r\nvocation.[22-40] Lacking encouragement from parents, teachers, and\r\npeers, black youths were increasingly reluctant to consider a military\r\ncareer. For their part the services tried to counter this attitude\r\nwith an energetic public relations program.[22-41] Encouraged by the\r\ndepartment's civil rights experts they tried to establish closer   (p. 568)\r\nrelations with black students. They even reorganized their recruitment\r\nprograms, and the Secretary of Defense himself initiated a program to\r\nattract more black ROTC cadets.[22-42] Service representatives also\r\nworked with teachers and school officials to inform students on\r\nmilitary career opportunities.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-40: Paul Memo.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-41: For accounts of Navy and Marine\r\n                   Corps attempts to attract more Negroes, see Memos:\r\n                   Smedberg for Under SecNav, 20 May 63, sub: Interim\r\n                   Progress Report on Navy Measures in the Area of\r\n                   Equality of Opportunity in the Armed Forces; Under\r\n                   SecNav for SecNav, 15 Jul 63, sub: First Report of\r\n                   Progress in the Area of Equal Opportunity in the\r\n                   Navy Department; E.

Following the publication of a presidential task\r\nforce report on the chronic problem of high draft rejection rates, the\r\nArmy inaugurated in August 1964 a Special Training and Enlistment\r\nProgram (STEP), an experiment in the \"military training, education,\r\nand physical rehabilitation of men who cannot meet current mental or\r\nmedical standards for regular enlistment in the Army.\"[22-43] Aimed at\r\nincreasing enlistments by providing special training after induction\r\nfor those previously rejected as unqualified, the program provided for\r\nthe enlistment of 8,000 substandard men, which included many Negroes.\r\nBefore the men could be enlisted, however, Congress killed the\r\nprogram, citing its cost and duplication of the efforts of the Job\r\nCorps. It was not until 1967 that the idea of accepting many young men\r\nineligible for the draft because of mental or educational deficiencies\r\nwas revived when McNamara launched his Project 100,000.[22-44]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-43: DOD News Release, 13 Aug 64.

V.]\r\n\r\nThe services were unable to bring off a dramatic change in black\r\nenlistment patterns in the 1960's. With the exception of the Marine\r\nCorps, in which the proportion of black enlisted men increased 4\r\npercent, the percentage of Negroes in the services remained relatively\r\nstationary between 1962 and 1968 (_Table 24_). In 1968, when Negroes\r\naccounted for 11 percent of the American population, their share of\r\nthe enlisted service population remained at 8.2, with significant\r\ndifferences among the services. Nor did there seem much chance of\r\nincreasing the number of black servicemen since the percentage of\r\nNegroes among draftees and first-time enlistees was rising very    (p. 569)\r\nslowly while black reenlistment rates, for some twenty years a major\r\nfactor in holding black strength steady, began to decline (_Table 25_).\r\nActually, enlistment figures for both whites and blacks declined, a\r\ncircumstance usually attributed to the unpopularity of the Vietnam\r\nWar, although in the midst of the war, in 1967, black first-term\r\nreenlistment rates continued to exceed white rates 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nTable 24--Black Percentages, 1962-1968\r\n\r\n      |      Army      |      Navy      |   Marine Corps |    Air Force\r\n  Year|        Enlisted|        Enlisted|        Enlisted|        Enlisted\r\n      |Officers|  Men  |Officers|  Men  |Officers|  Men  |Officers| Men\r\n  1962   3.2     12.2      .2      5.2      .2      7.6     1.2     9.2\r\n  1964   3.4     13.4      .3      5.8      .4      8.7     1.5    10.0\r\n  1965   3.5     13.9      .3      5.8      .4      9.0     1.6    10.7\r\n  1967   3.4     12.1      .3      4.7      .7     10.3     1.8    10.4\r\n  1968   3.3     12.6      .4      5.0      .9     11.5     1.8    10.2\r\n\r\n_Source_: Records of ASD (M) 291.2.\r\n\r\nTable 25--Rates for Reenlistments, 1964-1967\r\n\r\n             Army            Navy         Marine Corps     Air Force\r\n  Year | White | Black | White | Black | White | Black | White | Black\r\n  1964    18.5    49.3    21.6    41.3    12.9    25.1    27.4    50.3\r\n  1965    13.7    49.3    24.2    44.8    18.9    38.9    19.1    39.2\r\n  1966    20.0    66.5    17.6    24.7    10.5    19.5    16.0    30.1\r\n  1967    12.9    31.7    16.7    22.5    10.7    17.4    17.3    26.9\r\n\r\n_Source_: Records of ASD (M) 291.2; see especially Paul Memo.\r\n\r\nThe low percentage of black officers, a matter of special concern to\r\nthe Civil Rights Commission and the Gesell Committee as well as the\r\ncivil rights organizations, remained relatively unchanged in the\r\n1960's (_see Table 24_). Nor could any dramatic rise in the number of\r\nblack officers be expected. Between 1963 and 1968 the three service\r\nacademies graduated just fifty-one black officers, an impressive\r\nstatistic only in the light of the record of a total of sixty black\r\ngraduates in the preceding eighty-six years. Furthermore, there were\r\nonly 116 black cadets in 1968, a vast proportional increase over\r\nformer years but also an indication of the small number of black\r\nofficers that could be expected from that source during the next four\r\nyears (_Table 26_). Since cadets were primarily chosen by\r\ncongressional nomination and from other special categories, little\r\ncould be done, many officials assumed, to increase substantially the\r\nnumber of black cadets and midshipmen. An imaginative effort by Fitt\r\nin early 1964, however, proved this assumption false. Fitt got the\r\nacademies to agree to take all the qualified Negroes he could find and\r\nsome senators and congressmen to relinquish some of their appointments\r\nto the cause. He then wrote every major school district in the\r\ncountry, seeking black applicants and assuring them that the academies\r\nwere truly open to all those qualified. Even though halfway through\r\nthe academic year, Fitt's \"micro-personnel operation,\" as he later\r\ncalled it, yielded appointments for ten Negroes. Unfortunately,    (p. 570)\r\nhis successor did not continue the effort.[22-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-45: Ltr, Fitt to author, 21 Oct 76, CMH\r\n                   files.]\r\n\r\nTable 26--Black Attendance at the Military Academies, July 1968\r\n\r\n              Class     Class     Class     Class    Total     Total\r\n  Academy | of 1969 | of 1970 | of 1971 | of 1972 | Negro | Attendance\r\n  Army         10         7         5         9       31       3,285\r\n  Navy          2         8         8        15       33       4,091\r\n  Air Force     6        10        13        23       52       3,028\r\n    Totals     18        25        26        47      116\r\n\r\n_Source_: Office, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civil\r\nRights).\r\n\r\nThe ROTC program at predominantly black colleges had always been the\r\nchief source of black officers, but here, again, there was little hope\r\nfor immediate improvement. With the exception of a large increase in\r\nthe number of black Air Force officers graduating from five black\r\ncolleges, the percentage of officers entering the service from these\r\ninstitutions remained essentially unchanged throughout the 1960's\r\ndespite the services' new equal opportunity programs (_Table 27_).\r\nSome civil rights leaders had been arguing for years that the\r\nestablishment of ROTC units at predominantly black schools merely\r\nhelped perpetuate the nation's segregated college system. Fitt agreed\r\nthat as integrated education became more commonplace the number of\r\nblack ROTC graduates would increase in predominantly white colleges,\r\nbut meanwhile he considered units at black schools essential. Among\r\nthe approximately 140 black colleges without ROTC affiliation, some\r\ncould possibly qualify for units, and in February 1965 Fitt's\r\nsuccessor, Stephen N. Shulman, called for the formation of more    (p. 571)\r\nROTC units as an equal opportunity measure.[22-46] The Army responded\r\nby creating a unit at Arkansas A&M Normal College, and the Navy opened\r\na unit at Prairie View A&M in the President's home state of Texas.\r\nBalancing the expectations implied by the formation of these new units\r\nwere the growing antiwar sentiment among college students and the\r\nspecial competition for black college graduates in the private\r\nbusiness community, both of which made ROTC commissions less\r\nattractive to many black students.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-46: Fitt left the civil rights office in\r\n                   August 1964 to become the General Counsel of the\r\n                   Army.

A statistical\r\ncomparison of the ranks of enlisted black servicemen between 1964 and\r\n1966 reveals a steady advance (_Table 28_). With the exception of the\r\nAir Force, the percentage of Negroes in the higher enlisted ranks\r\ncompared favorably with the total black percentage in each service.\r\nThe advance was less marked for officers, but here too the black share\r\nof the O-4 grade (major or lieutenant commander) was comparable with\r\nthe black percentage of the service's total strength. The services\r\ncould declare with considerable justification that reform in this area\r\nwas necessarily a drawn-out affair; promotion to the senior ranks must\r\nbe won against strong competition.\r\n\r\nTable 28--Percentage of Negroes in Certain Military Ranks, 1964-1966\r\n\r\n  E-6 (Staff Sergeant or Petty Officer, First Class)\r\n\r\n                   _1964_ _1965_ _1966_\r\n  Army              13.9   15.5   18.1\r\n  Navy               4.7    5.0    5.6\r\n  Marine Corps       5.0    5.3   10.4\r\n  Air Force          5.3    5.6    6.6\r\n\r\n  O-4 (Major or Lieutenant Commander)\r\n\r\n  Army               3.6    4.5    5.2\r\n  Navy               0.3    0.3    0.3\r\n  Marine Corps       0.3    0.3    0.2\r\n  Air Force          0.8    0.9    1.6\r\n\r\n_Source_: Office, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civil\r\nRights).\r\n\r\nThe department's civil rights office forwarded to the services\r\ncomplaints from black servicemen who, despite the highest efficiency\r\nratings and special commendations from commanders, failed to win\r\npromotions. \"Almost uniformly,\" the office reported in 1965, \"the\r\nreply comes back from the service that there had been no bias, no\r\npartiality, no prejudice operating in detriment on the complainant's\r\nconsideration for promotion. They reply the best qualified was\r\npromoted, but this was not to say that the complainant did not have a\r\nvery good record.\"[22-47] While black officers might well have     (p. 572)\r\nbeen subtly discriminated against in matters of promotion, they also,\r\nit should be pointed out, shared in the general inflation in\r\nefficiency ratings, common in all the services, that resulted in\r\naverage officers being given \"highest efficiency ratings.\"\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-47: Paul Memo.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to complaining of direct denial of promotion opportunity,\r\nso-called \"vertical mobility,\" some black officers alleged that their\r\nchances of promotion had been systematically reduced by the services\r\nwhen they failed to provide Negroes with \"horizontal mobility,\" that\r\nis, with a wide variety of assignments and all-important command\r\nexperience which would justify their future advancement. Supporting\r\nthese claims, the civil rights office reported that only 5 Negroes\r\nwere enrolled at the senior service schools in 1965, 4 black naval\r\nofficers with command experience were on active duty, and 26 black Air\r\nForce officers had been given tactical command experience since 1950.\r\nThe severely limited assignment of black Army officers at the major\r\ncommand headquarters, moreover, illustrated the \"narrow gauge\"\r\nassignment of Negroes.[22-48] This picture seemed somewhat at variance\r\nwith Deputy Assistant Secretary Shulman's assurances to the Kansas\r\nConference on Civil Rights in May 1965 that \"we have paid particular\r\nattention to the assignment of Negro officers to the senior Service\r\nschools, and to those positions of command that are so vital to\r\nofficer advancement to the highest rank.\"[22-49]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-48: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-49: Shulman, \"The Civil Rights Policies\r\n                   of the Department of Defense,\" 4 May 65.]\r\n\r\nSince promotion in the military ranks depended to a great extent on a\r\nman's skills, training in and assignment to vital job categories were\r\nimportant to enlisted men. Here, too, the statistics revealed that the\r\npercentage of Negroes in the technical occupations, which had begun to\r\nrise in the years after Korea, had continued to increase but that a\r\nlarge proportion still held unskilled or semiskilled military\r\noccupational specialties (_Table 29_). Eligibility for the various\r\nmilitary occupations depended to a great extent on the servicemen's\r\nmental aptitude, with men scoring in the higher categories usually\r\nwinning assignment to technical occupations. When the Army began\r\ndrafting large numbers of men in the mid-1960's, the number of men in\r\ncategory IV, which included many Negroes, began to go up. Given the\r\nfact that many Negroes with the qualifications for technical training\r\nwere ignoring the services for other vocations while the less\r\nqualified were once again swelling the ranks, the Department of\r\nDefense could do little to insure a fair representation of Negroes in\r\ntechnical occupations or increase the number of black soldiers in\r\nhigher grades. The problem tended to feed upon itself. Not only were\r\nthe statistics the bane of civil rights organizations, but they also\r\ninfluenced talented young blacks to decide against a service career,\r\nin effect creating a variation of Gresham's law in the Army wherein\r\nmen of low mentality were keeping out men of high intelligence. There\r\nseemed little to be done, although the department's civil rights\r\noffice pressed the services to establish remedial training for\r\ncategory IV men so that they might become eligible for more technical\r\nassignments.\r\n\r\nTable 29--Distribution of Servicemen in Occupational Groups by Race, 1967\r\n\r\n                    |     White     |     Black              |Unknown|Total\r\n                    |       |       |       |       | Percent|       |\r\n                    |       |       |       |       |of Total|       |\r\n                    |       |Percent|       |Percent| in Each|       |\r\n    Group/Activity  | Number| Dist. | Number| Dist. | Group/ | Number|Number\r\n                    |       |       |       |       |Activity|       |\r\n  Combat troops      324,560   12.1   55,518   18.7    14.5   2,646   382,724\r\n  Electronics\r\n    repairmen        239,595    9.0   13,843    4.7     5.5     204   253,642\r\n  Communications\r\n    specialists      191,372    7.2   12,856    4.4     6.3     392   204,620\r\n  Medical personnel  101,793    3.8   11,074    3.8     9.8      76   112,943\r\n  Other technicians   52,132    1.9    3,812    1.3     6.8      86    56,030\r\n  Administrative\r\n    personnel        430,186   16.1   55,543   18.8    11.4     986   486,715\r\n  Mechanical\r\n    repairmen        498,899   18.6   39,820   13.5     7.4     794   539,513\r\n  Draftsmen          144,070    5.4   15,728    5.3     9.8     248   160,046\r\n  Service & supply\r\n  personnel          283,976   10.6   53,136   18.0    15.7     998   338,110\r\n  Miscellaneous/\r\n    unknown          245,055    9.1   14,964    5.1    13.5   1,337   261,356\r\n  Trainees[a]        166,478    6.2   18,753    6.4    10.1   1,194   186,425\r\n    Total          2,678,116  100.0  295,047  100.0     9.9   8,961 2,982,124\r\n\r\n                   [Tablenote a: Represents an Army category only.]\r\n\r\n_Source_: Bahr, \"The Expanding Role of the Department of Defense As an\r\nInstrument of Social Change.\" Bahr's table is based on unpublished\r\ndata from the DASD (CR).\r\n\r\nIf a man's assignment and promotion depended ultimately on his     (p. 573)\r\naptitude category, that category depended upon his performance in the\r\nArmed Forces Qualifying Test and other screening tests usually\r\nadministered at induction.

Some educational psychologists have claimed\r\nthat an individual's performance in written tests measured his\r\ncultural and educational background, not his mental aptitude. It is\r\ntrue that the accuracy of test measurements was never reassessed in\r\nlight of the subsequent performance of those tested.

I, p.\r\n                   47.]\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense depended on the \"limited predictive\r\ncapability of these tests,\" the task force charged, in deciding\r\nwhether a serviceman was assigned to a \"soft core\" field, that is,\r\ngiven a job in such categories as transportation or supply, or whether\r\nhe could enter one of the more profitable and prestigious \"hard core\"\r\nfields that would bring more rapid advancement.\r\n\r\nAccurate and comprehensive testing and the measurement of acquired (p. 574)\r\nskills was obviously an important and complex matter, but in 1963 it\r\nwas ignored by both the Civil Rights Commission and the Gesell\r\nCommittee. President Kennedy, however, seemed aware of the problem.\r\nBefore leaving for Europe in the summer of 1963 he called on the\r\nSecretary of Defense to consider establishing training programs keyed\r\nprimarily to the special problems of black servicemen found ineligible\r\nfor technical training. According to Lee White, the President wanted\r\nto use new training techniques \"and other methods of stimulating\r\ninterest and industry\" that might help thousands of men bridge \"the\r\ngap that presently exists between their own educational and cultural\r\nbackgrounds and those of the average white serviceman.\"[22-51]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-51: Memo, Asst Spec Counsel to President\r\n                   for SecDef, 27 Jun 63, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the complexity of the problem, White agreed with Fitt that\r\nthe program should be postponed pending further study, but the\r\nPresident's request happened to coincide with a special survey of the\r\ndeficiencies and changes in recruit training then being made by Under\r\nSecretary of the Army Stephen Ailes.[22-52] Ailes offered to develop a\r\nspecial off-duty training program in line with the President's\r\nrequest. The program, to begin on a trial basis in October 1963, would\r\nalso include evaluation counseling to determine if and when trainees\r\nshould be assigned to technical schools.[22-53] Such a program\r\nrepresented a departure for the services, which since World War II had\r\nconsistently rejected the idea frequently advanced by sociologists\r\nthat the culturally, environmentally, and educationally deprived were\r\ndenied equal opportunity when they were required to compete with the\r\nmiddle-class average.[22-54] Although no specific, measurable results\r\nwere recorded from this educational experiment, the project was\r\neventually blended into the Army's Special Training and Enlistment\r\nProgram and finally into McNamara's Project 100,000.[22-55]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-52: ACSFOR, \"Annual Historical Summary,\r\n                   Fiscal Years 1963-64,\" copy in CMH; Memo, DASD (CR)\r\n                   for Paul, 25 Sep 63, sub: Training Program Keyed\r\n                   Primarily to the Special Problems of Negro\r\n                   Servicemen, ASD (M) files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-53: Memo, Under SA for ASD (M), 14 Sep\r\n                   63, sub: Training Program Keyed Primarily to the\r\n                   Special Problems of Negro Servicemen; Memo, ASD (M)\r\n                   for Asst Spec Counsel to President, 25 Sep 63; both\r\n                   in ASD (M) files.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-54: For a discussion of this argument,\r\n                   see [BuPers] Memo for Rcd, Capt K.

Along with the integration of military\r\nunits in the 1950's, the services had narrowed their multiple and\r\ncumbersome definition of races to a list of five groups. Even this\r\nlist, a compromise drawn up by the Defense Department's Personnel\r\nPolicy Board, was criticized. Reflecting the opinion of the civil\r\nrights forces, Evans declared that the definition of five races and\r\ntwelve subcategories was scientifically inaccurate, statistically  (p. 575)\r\ncomplicated, and racially offensive. He wanted a simple \"white,\r\nnonwhite\" listing of servicemen.[22-56] The subject continued to be\r\ndiscussed throughout the 1960's, the case finally going to the\r\nDirector of the Bureau of the Budget, the ultimate authority on\r\ngovernment forms. In August 1969 the director announced a uniform\r\nmethod for defining the races in federal statistics. The collectives\r\n\"Negro and Other Races,\" \"All Other Rates,\" or \"All Other\" would be\r\nacceptable to designate minorities; the terms \"White,\" \"Negro,\" and\r\n\"Other Races\" would be acceptable in distinguishing between the\r\nmajority, principal minority, and other races.[22-57]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-56: See, for example, the following\r\n                   Memos: Evans for Judge Jackson, 1 Apr 63, and Mr.\r\n                   Jordan, 3 Sep 64, sub: Racial Designations; Douglas\r\n                   Dahlin for E.

Under\r\npressure from civil rights organizations, some congressmen, and the\r\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, the services began to abandon some\r\nof the least justifiable uses of racial designations, principally\r\nthose used on certain inductees' travel orders, reassignment orders,\r\nand reserve rosters.[22-58] But change was not widespread, and as late\r\nas 1963 the services still distinguished by race in their basic\r\npersonnel records, casualty reports, statistical and command strength\r\nreports, personnel control files, and over twenty-five other\r\ndepartmental forms.[22-59] They continued to defend the use of racial\r\ndesignations on the grounds that measurement of equal opportunity\r\nprograms and detection of discrimination patterns depended on accurate\r\nracial data.[22-60] Few could argue with these motives, although\r\ncritics continued to question the need for race designations on\r\nrecords that were used in assignment and promotion processes. When\r\npublic opposition developed to the use of racial entries on federal\r\nforms in general, the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity\r\nappointed a subcommittee in 1963 under Civil Service Chairman John W.\r\nMacy, Jr., to investigate. After much deliberation this group\r\nconducted a statistical experiment within the Department of\r\nAgriculture to discover whether employees could be identified by\r\nracial groups in a confidential manner separate from other personnel\r\ndata.[22-61]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-58: See Ltr, Clarence Mitchell, NAACP, to\r\n                   ASD (M), 8 Jul 53; Ltr, Congressman Henry S.

On 3 March\r\n1964 Paul discreetly ordered the removal of race designations on all\r\nbut nine of these forms, those concerning biostatistical, criminal,\r\nand casualty figures.[22-63] His order did not, however, extend to\r\nanother group of forms used by individual services for their own\r\npurposes, and later in the year Fitt drafted an order that would have\r\neliminated all racial designations in the services except an entry for\r\ndata processing systems and one for biostatistical information. The\r\ndirective also would have allowed racial designations on forms that\r\ndid not identify individuals, arranged for the disposition of remains\r\nand casualty reporting, described fugitives and other \"wanted\" types,\r\nand permitted other exceptions granted at the level of the Assistant\r\nSecretary of Defense or that of the service secretary. Finally it\r\nwould have set up a system for purging existing records and removing\r\nphotographs from promotion board selection folders.[22-64] The\r\nservices strongly objected to a purge of existing records on the\r\ngrounds of costliness, and they were particularly opposed to the\r\nremoval of photographs. Photographs were traditional and remained\r\ndesirable, Deputy Under Secretary of the Army Roy K. Davenport\r\nexplained, because they were useful in portraying individual physical\r\ncharacteristics unrelated to race.[22-65] Davenport added, however,\r\nthat photographs could be eliminated from promotion board materials.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-62: Memo, Spec Asst to ASD (M) for Under\r\n                   SA, 15 Apr 63, sub: Racial Identification on\r\n                   Military Records (similar memorandums were sent to\r\n                   the Secretaries of Navy and Air Force on the same\r\n                   day); Memo, ASD (M) for OASD (Comptroller) (ca. 1\r\n                   Jun 63); both in ASD (M) 291.2.

The\r\ndemand was also supported by representatives of the smaller racial\r\nminorities who, joining in the civil rights revolution, developed a\r\nself-awareness that made detailed racial and ethnic statistics\r\nmandatory. The shift was made possible to a great extent by the change\r\nin public opinion toward racial minorities. As one civil rights\r\nofficial later noted, the change in attitude had caused black\r\nservicemen to reconsider their belief that detrimental treatment\r\nnecessarily followed racial identification.[22-67] Ironically, just a\r\ndecade after the McNamara directive on equal opportunity, a\r\ndepartmental civil rights official, himself a Negro, was defending the\r\nuse of photographs in the selection process on the grounds that such\r\nprocedures were necessary in any large organization where individuals\r\nwere relatively unknown to their superiors.[22-68] So strong had the\r\nservices' need for black officers become, it could be argued, that a\r\npromotion board's knowledge of a candidate's race redounded to the\r\nadvantage of the black applicants. For whatever reason, the pressure\r\nto eliminate racial indicators from personnel forms had largely\r\ndisappeared at the end of the 1960's.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-67: Memo, Bennett for ASD (M) and DASD\r\n                   (Civ Pers, Indus Rels, and CR), 8 Dec 66, copy in\r\n                   CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-68: Interv, author with Johnson, 9 Aug\r\n                   73.]\r\n\r\nThe Gesell Committee's investigations also forced the Department of\r\nDefense to consider the possibility of discrimination in the rarefied\r\narea of embassy and special mission assignments and the certainty of\r\ndiscrimination against black servicemen in local communities near some\r\noverseas bases. Concerning the former, the staff of the civil rights\r\ndeputy concluded that such assignments were voluntary and based on\r\nspecial selection procedures. Race was not a factor except for three\r\ncountries where assignments were \"based on politically ethnic\r\nconsiderations.\"[22-69] Nevertheless, Fitt began to discuss with\r\nthe services ways to attract more qualified black volunteers for   (p. 578)\r\nassignments to attache, mission, and military assistance groups.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-69: Memo, Exec to DASD (CR) for DASD\r\n                   (CR), 20 Mar 64; see also OASD (CR), Summary of\r\n                   Military Personnel Assignments in Overseas Areas;\r\n                   both in ODASD (CR) files.

When the Department of Defense outlined\r\nthe commander's responsibility regarding off-base discrimination\r\noverseas, it expressly authorized commanders to impose sanctions in\r\nforeign communities, yet just five weeks later the services clarified\r\nthe order for the press, explaining that sanctions would be limited to\r\nthe United States.[22-70] A spokesman for the U.S. Army in Germany\r\nadmitted that discrimination continued in restaurants and bars, adding\r\nthat such discrimination was illegal in Germany and was limited to the\r\nlowest class establishments.[22-71] Supporting these conclusions was a\r\nspate of newspaper reports of segregated establishments in certain\r\nareas of Okinawa and the neighborhood around an Army barracks near\r\nFrankfurt, Germany.[22-72]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-70: DOD directive cited in Gesell\r\n                   Committee's \"Final Report,\" p. 7; see also New York\r\n                   _Times_, September 12, 1963.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-71: New York _Times_ and Washington\r\n                   _Post_, December 29, 1964.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-72: See, for example, New York _Herald\r\n                   Tribune_, January 3, 1965; New York _Times_, March\r\n                   29, 1964.]\r\n\r\nDespite these continuing press reports, the services declared in\r\nmid-1965 that the \"overwhelming majority\" of overseas installations\r\nwere free of segregation problems in housing or public accommodations.\r\nOne important exception to this overwhelming majority was reported by\r\nGeneral Paul Freeman, the commander of U.S. Army Forces in Europe. He\r\nnot only admitted that the problem existed in his command but also\r\nconcluded that it had been imported from the United States. The\r\ngeneral had met with Gerhard Gesell and subsequently launched a\r\nspecial troop indoctrination program in Europe on discrimination in\r\npublic accommodations. He also introduced a voluntary compliance\r\nprogram to procure open housing.[22-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-73: Memo for Rcd, Timpane, 25 Nov 64,\r\n                   ODASD (CR) files.]\r\n\r\nThe Gesell Committee had repeatedly asserted that discrimination\r\nexisted only in areas near American bases, and its most serious\r\nmanifestations were \"largely inspired by the attitude of a minority of\r\nwhite servicemen\" who exerted social pressure on local businessmen. It\r\nwas, therefore, a problem for American forces, and not primarily one\r\nfor its allies. The civil rights office, however, preferred to\r\nconsider the continuing discrimination as an anti-American phenomenon\r\nrather than a racial problem.[22-74] Fitt and his successor seemed\r\nconvinced that such discrimination was isolated and its solution\r\ncomplex because of the difficulty in drawing a line between the\r\nattitudes of host nations and American GI's. Consequently, the problem\r\ncontinued throughout the next decade, always low key, never\r\nwidespread, a problem of black morale inadequately treated by the\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-74: Paul Memo.]\r\n\r\nThe failure to solve the problem of racial discrimination overseas\r\nand, indeed, the inability to liquidate all remaining vestiges of\r\ndiscrimination within the military establishment, constituted the\r\nmajor shortfall of McNamara's equal opportunity policy. With no    (p. 579)\r\nattempt to shift responsibility to his subordinates,[22-75] McNamara\r\nlater reflected with some heat on the failure of his directive to\r\nimprove treatment and opportunities for black servicemen substantially\r\nand expeditiously: \"I was naive enough in those days to think that all\r\nI had to do was show my people that a problem existed, tell them to\r\nwork on it, and that they would then attack the problem. It turned out\r\nof course that not a goddamn thing happened.\"[22-76]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-75: For an example of McNamara's\r\n                   extremely self-critical judgments on the subject of\r\n                   equal opportunity, see Brock Brower, \"McNamara Seen\r\n                   Now, Full Length,\" _Life_ 64 (May 10, 1968): 78.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-76: Interv, author with McNamara, 11 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nAlthough critical of his department's performance, McNamara would\r\nprobably admit that more than simple recalcitrance was involved. For\r\nexample, the services' traditional opposition to outside interference\r\nwith the development of their personnel policies led naturally to\r\ntheir opposition to any defense programs setting exact command\r\nresponsibilities or dictating strict monitoring of their racial\r\nprogress. Defense officials, respecting service attitudes, failed to\r\ndemand an exact accounting. Again, the services' natural reluctance to\r\ncourt congressional criticism, a reluctance shared by McNamara and his\r\ndefense colleagues, led them all to avoid unpopular programs such as\r\ncreating ombudsmen at bases to channel black servicemen's complaints.\r\nAs one manpower official pointed out, all commanders professed their\r\nintolerance of discrimination in their commands, yet the prospect of\r\nany effective communication between these commanders and their\r\nsubordinates suffering such discrimination remained unlikely.[22-77]\r\nAgain defense officials, restrained by the White House from\r\nantagonizing Congress, failed to insist upon change.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-77: Memo, William C. Baldes, ODASD (CR),\r\n                   for DASD (CR), 8 Jul 63, ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nFinally, while it was true that the services had not responded any\r\nbetter to McNamara's directive than to any of several earlier and less\r\nnoteworthy calls for racial equality within the military community, it\r\nwas not true that the reason for the lack of progress lay exclusively\r\nwith the service. Against the background of the integration\r\nachievements of the previous decade, a feeling existed among defense\r\nofficials that such on-base discrimination as remained was largely a\r\nmatter of detail. Even Fitt shared the prevailing view. \"In three\r\nyears of close attention to such matters, I have observed [no] ...\r\ngreat gains in on-base equality,\" because, he explained to his\r\nsuperior, \"_the basic gains were made in the 1948-1953 period_.\"[22-78]\r\nIt must be remembered that discrimination operating within the armed\r\nforces was less tractable and more difficult to solve than the\r\npatterns of segregation that had confronted the services of old or the\r\noff-base problems confronting them in the early 1960's. The services\r\nhad reached what must have seemed to many a point of diminishing\r\nreturns in the battle against on-base discrimination, a point at which\r\neach successive increment of effort yielded a smaller result than its\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-78: Memo, DASD (CR) for ASD (M), 2 Jul\r\n                   64, copy in CMH. Emphasis not in original.]\r\n\r\nNo one--not the Civil Rights Commission, the Gesell Committee, the\r\ncivil rights organizations, and, judging from the volume of complaints,\r\nnot even black servicemen themselves--seriously tried to disabuse\r\nthese officials of their satisfaction with the pace of reform.     (p. 580)\r\nCertainly no one equated the importance of on-base discrimination with\r\nthe blatant off-base discrimination that had captured everyone's\r\nattention. In fact, problems as potentially explosive as the\r\ndiscrimination in the administration of military justice were all but\r\nignored during the 1960's.[22-79]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 22-79: The administration of military\r\n                   justice was not considered by the Civil Rights\r\n                   Commission nor by the Gesell Committee, although it\r\n                   was mentioned once by the NAACP as a cause of\r\n                   numerous complaints and once by the Deputy\r\n                   Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in regard to\r\n                   black representation on courts-martial.

The failure of\r\nNegroes to win skilled job assignments and promotions, for example,\r\nwould remain to fester and contribute significantly to the bitterness\r\nvisited upon a surprised Department of Defense in later years. In\r\nbrief, because the services had become a model of racial equality when\r\njudged by contemporary standards, the impulse of almost all concerned\r\nwas to play down the reforms still needed on base and turn instead to\r\nthe pressing and spectacular challenges that lay in wait outside the\r\ngates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23                                                         (p. 581)\r\n\r\nFrom Voluntary Compliance to Sanctions\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Defense Department's attitude toward off-base discrimination\r\nagainst servicemen underwent a significant change in the mid-1960's.\r\nAt first Secretary McNamara relied on his commanders to win from the\r\nlocal communities a voluntary accommodation to his equal opportunity\r\npolicy. Only after a lengthy interval, during which the accumulated\r\nevidence demonstrated that voluntary compliance would, in some cases,\r\nnot be forthcoming, did he take up the cudgel of sanctions. His use of\r\nthis powerful economic weapon proved to be circumscribed and of brief\r\nduration, but its application against a few carefully selected targets\r\nhad a salubrious and widespread effect. At the same time developments\r\nin the civil rights movement, especially the passage of strong new\r\nlegislation in 1964, permitted servicemen to depend with considerable\r\nassurance upon judicial processes for the redress of their grievances.\r\n\r\nSanctions were distasteful, and almost everyone concerned was anxious\r\nto avoid their use. The Gesell Committee wanted them reserved for\r\nthose recalcitrants who had withstood the informal but determined\r\nefforts of local commanders to obtain voluntary compliance. McNamara\r\nagreed. \"There were plenty of things that the commanders could do in a\r\nvoluntary way,\" he said later, and he wanted to give them time \"to get\r\nto work on this problem.\"[23-1] His principal civil rights assistants\r\nconsidered it inappropriate to declare businesses or local communities\r\noff limits while the services were still in the process of developing\r\nvoluntary action programs and before the full impact of new federal\r\ncivil rights legislation on those programs could be tested. As for the\r\nservices themselves, each was on record as being opposed to any use of\r\nsanctions in equal opportunity cases. The 1963 equal opportunity\r\ndirective of the Secretary of Defense reflected this general\r\nreluctance. It authorized the use of sanctions, but in such a\r\ncarefully restricted manner that for three years agencies of the\r\nDepartment of Defense never seriously contemplated using them.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-1: Interv, author with McNamara, 11 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development of Voluntary Action Programs_\r\n\r\nDespite this obvious aversion to the use of sanctions in equal\r\nopportunity cases, the public impression persisted that Secretary\r\nMcNamara was trying to use military commanders as instruments for\r\nforcing the desegregation of civilian communities. Actually, the   (p. 582)\r\nGesell Committee and the McNamara directive had demanded no such\r\nthing, as the secretary's civil rights deputy was repeatedly forced to\r\npoint out. Military commanders, Fitt explained, were obligated to\r\nprotect their men from harm and to secure their just treatment.\r\nTherefore, when \"harmful civilian discrimination\" was directed against\r\nmen in uniform, \"the wise commander seeks to do something about it.\"\r\nCommanders, he observed, did not issue threats or demand social\r\nreforms; they merely sought better conditions for servicemen and their\r\nfamilies through cooperation and understanding. As for the general\r\nproblem of racial discrimination in the United States, that was a\r\nresponsibility of the civilian community, not the services.[23-2]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-2: See Memo, DASD (CR) for ASD (M), 2 Jul\r\n                   64; Fitt, \"Remarks Before the Civilian Aides\r\n                   Conference of the Secretary of the Army,\" 6 Mar 64;\r\n                   copies of both in CMH. The quoted passage is from\r\n                   the latter document.]\r\n\r\nExhibiting a similar concern for the sensibilities of congressional\r\ncritics, Secretary McNamara assured the Senate Armed Services\r\nCommittee that he had no plans \"to utilize military personnel as a\r\nmethod of social reform.\" At the same time he reiterated his belief\r\nthat troop efficiency was affected by segregation, and added that when\r\nsuch a connection was found to exist \"we should work with the\r\ncommunity involved.\" He would base such involvement, he emphasized, on\r\nthe commander's responsibility to maintain combat readiness and\r\neffectiveness.[23-3] Similar reassurances had to be given the military\r\ncommanders, some of whom saw in the Gesell recommendations a demand\r\nfor preferential treatment for Negroes and a level of involvement in\r\ncommunity affairs that would interfere with their basic military\r\nmission.[23-4] To counter this belief, Fitt and his successor hammered\r\naway at the Gesell Committee's basic theme: discrimination affects\r\nmorale; morale affects military efficiency. The commander's activities\r\nin behalf of equal opportunity for his men in the community is at\r\nleast as important as his interest in problems of gambling, vice, and\r\npublic health, and is in furtherance of his military mission.[23-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-3: Robert S.

Fitt organized conferences with base\r\ncommanders to develop techniques for dealing with off-base\r\ndiscrimination, and his office provided commanders with legal advice\r\nto counter the arguments of authorities in segregated communities.\r\nFitt also encouraged commanders to establish liaison with local civil\r\nrights groups whose objectives and activities coincided with\r\ndepartmental policy. At his request, Assistant Secretary of Defense\r\nfor Manpower Paul devised numerous special instructions and asked the\r\nservices to issue regulations supporting commanders in their attempts\r\nto change community attitudes toward black servicemen. These\r\nregulations, in turn, called on commanders to enlist community support\r\nfor equal treatment and opportunity measures, utilizing in the     (p. 583)\r\ncause their command-community relations committees. Consisting of base\r\nofficials and local business and community leaders, these committees\r\nhad originally been organized by the services to improve relations\r\nbetween the base and town. Henceforth, they would become the means by\r\nwhich the local commanders might introduce measures to secure equal\r\ntreatment for servicemen.[23-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-6: Memos: DASD (CR) for White, Assoc Spec\r\n                   Council to President, 9 Jul 64; Philip M.

His vehicle was\r\na series of off-base equal opportunity inventories, the first\r\ncomprehensive, statistical record of discrimination affecting\r\nservicemen in the United States. Based on detailed reports from every\r\nmilitary installation to which 500 or more servicemen were         (p. 584)\r\nassigned, the first inventory covered some 305 bases in forty-eight\r\nstates and the District of Columbia and nearly 80 percent of the total\r\nmilitary population stationed in the United States. Along with\r\ndetailed surveys of public transportation, education, public\r\naccommodations, and housing, the inventory reported on local racial\r\nlaws and customs, police treatment of black servicemen, the existence\r\nof state and local agencies concerned with equal opportunity\r\nenforcement, and the base commander's use of command-community\r\nrelations committees.[23-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-7: See especially UPI Press Release,\r\n                   October 4, 1963; New York _Times_, October 3, 1963;\r\n                   Memo, Robert E.

It also uncovered\r\ninteresting patterns in that discrimination. In matters of commercial\r\ntransportation, local schools, and publicly owned facilities such as\r\nlibraries and stadiums, the problem of discrimination against black\r\nservicemen was confined almost exclusively to areas around\r\ninstallations in the south. But segregated public accommodations such\r\nas motels, restaurants, and amusements, a particularly virulent form\r\nof discrimination for servicemen, who as transients had to rely on\r\nsuch businesses, existed in all parts of the country including areas\r\nas diverse as Iowa, Alaska, Arizona, and Illinois. Discrimination in\r\nthese states was especially flagrant since all except Arizona had\r\nlegislation prohibiting enforced segregation of public accommodations.\r\nDiscrimination in the sale and rental of houses showed a similar\r\npattern. Only thirty installations out of the 305 reporting were\r\nlocated in states with equal housing opportunity statutes. These were\r\nin northern states, stretching from Maine to California. At the same\r\ntime, some of these installations reported discrimination in housing\r\ndespite existing state legislation forbidding such practices. No\r\ndifferences were reported in the treatment of black and white\r\nservicemen with respect to civilian law enforcement except that in\r\nsome communities black servicemen were segregated when taken into\r\ncustody for criminal violations.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the practice of most forms of discrimination was more\r\nintense in the south, but the record of other sections of the country\r\nwas no better than mixed, even where legislation forbade such separate\r\nand unequal treatment. Obviously there was much room for progress, and\r\nas indicated in the inventory much still could be done within the\r\narmed forces themselves. The reports revealed that almost one-third of\r\nthe commands inventoried failed to form the command-community\r\nrelations committees recommended by the Gesell Committee and ordered\r\nin the services' equal opportunity directives. Of the rest, only\r\nsixty-one commands had invited local black leaders to participate in\r\nwhat were supposed to be biracial groups.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the follow-up inventories--three were due from each\r\nservice at six-month intervals--was to determine the progress of local\r\ncommanders in achieving equal opportunity for their men. The       (p. 585)\r\nDefense Department showed considerable energy in extracting from\r\ncommanders comprehensive information on the state of equal opportunity\r\nin their communities.[23-9] In fact, this rather public exposition\r\nproved to be the major reporting system on equal opportunity progress,\r\nthe strongest inducement for service action, and the closest\r\nendorsement by the department of the Gesell Committee's call for an\r\naccountability system.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-9: See, for example, the following Memos:\r\n                   USAF Dep for Manpower, Personnel, and Organization\r\n                   for ASD (M), 6 Feb 64, sub: Off-Base Equal\r\n                   Opportunity Inventory Report, SecAF files; DASD\r\n                   (CR) for Fridge, USAF Manpower Office, 14 May 64;\r\n                   idem for Davenport et al., 3 Aug 64, sub: Off-Base\r\n                   Equal Opportunity Inventory Follow-Up Reports. All\r\n                   in ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\nThe first follow-up inventory revealed some progress in overcoming\r\ndiscrimination near military installations, but progress was slight\r\neverywhere and in some areas of concern nonexistent. Discrimination in\r\nschooling for dependents off base, closely bound to the national\r\nproblem of school desegregation, remained a major difficulty.\r\nCommanders reported that discrimination in public accommodations was\r\nmore susceptible to command efforts, but here, too, in some parts of\r\nthe country, communities were resisting change. A Marine Corps\r\ncommander, for example, reported the successful formation of a\r\ncommand-community relations committee at his installation near Albany,\r\nGeorgia, but to inquiries concerning the achievements of this\r\ncommittee the commander was forced to reply \"absolutely none.\"[23-10]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-10: OASD (CR), Summary of Follow-Up\r\n                   Off-Base Equal Opportunity Inventory (ca. Jun 64),\r\n                   DASD (CR) files.]\r\n\r\nSome forms of discrimination seemed impervious to change. Open\r\nhousing, for one, was the exception rather than the rule throughout\r\nthe country. One survey noted the particular difficulty this created\r\nfor servicemen, especially the many enlisted men who lived in trailers\r\nand could find no unsegregated place to park.[23-11] At times the\r\ncommanders' efforts to improve the situation seemed to compound the\r\nproblem. The stipulation that only open housing be listed with base\r\nhousing officers served more to reduce the number of listings than to\r\ncreate opportunities for open housing. Small wonder then that\r\nsegregated housing, \"the most pervasive and most intractable injustice\r\nof all,\" in Alfred Fitt's words, was generally ignored while the\r\ncommanders and civil rights officials concentrated instead on the more\r\neasily surmountable forms of discrimination.[23-12]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-11: Memo, DASD (CP, IR, & CR) for\r\n                   Stewart, 23 Dec 64, sub: Civil Rights\r\n                   Responsibilities of the Department of Defense, copy\r\n                   in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-12: Ltr, Fitt to author, 22 May 72.]\r\n\r\nAt least part of the reason for the continued existence of housing\r\ndiscrimination against servicemen lay in the fact that the Department\r\nof Defense continued to deny itself the use of its most potent equal\r\nopportunity weapon. Well into 1964, Fitt could report that no service\r\nhad contemplated the use of sanctions in an equal opportunity\r\ncase.[23-13] Nor had housing discrimination ever figured prominently\r\nin any decision to close a military base. At Fitt's suggestion,\r\nAssistant Secretary Paul proposed that community discrimination\r\npatterns be listed as one of the reasons for closing military      (p. 586)\r\nbases.[23-14] Although the Assistant Secretary for Installations and\r\nLogistics, Thomas D. Morris, agreed to consult such information during\r\ndeliberations on closings, he pointed out that economics and\r\noperational suitability were the major factors in determining a base's\r\nvalue.[23-15] As late as December 1964, an official of the Office of\r\nthe Secretary of Defense was publicly explaining that \"discrimination\r\nin the community is certainly a consideration, but the military\r\neffectiveness and justification of an installation must be\r\nprimary.\"[23-16]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-13: Ltr, DASD (CR) to Congressman Charles\r\n                   Diggs, 3 Feb 64, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-14: Memo, DASD (CR) for ASD (M), 24 Apr\r\n                   64, sub: Base Closings; Memo, ASD (M) for ASD\r\n                   (I&L), 29 Apr 64, sub: Base Closing Decisions; both\r\n                   in ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-15: Memo, ASD (I&L) for ASD (M), 23 May\r\n                   64, sub: Base Closing Decisions, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-16: Ltr, Principal Asst for CR, DASD (CP,\r\n                   IR, & CR) to Stanley T. Gutman, 18 Dec 64, ASD (M)\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nClearly, voluntary compliance had its limits, and Fitt said as much on\r\nthe occasion of his departure after a year's assignment as the civil\r\nrights deputy. Reviewing the year's activities for Gesell, Fitt\r\nconcluded that \"we have done everything we could think of\" in\r\nformulating civil rights policy and in establishing a monitoring\r\nsystem for its enforcement. He was confident that the department's\r\ncampaign against discrimination had gained enough momentum to insure\r\ncontinued progress. If, as he put it, the \"off-base lot of the Negro\r\nserviceman will not in my time be the same as that of his white\r\ncomrade-in-arms\" he was nevertheless satisfied that the Department of\r\nDefense was committed to equal opportunity and that commitment was\r\n\"bound to be beneficial.\"[23-17]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-17: Ltr, DASD (CR) to Gesell, 28 Jul 64,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nFitt's assessment was accurate, no doubt, but not exactly in keeping\r\nwith the optimistic spirit of the Gesell Committee and Secretary\r\nMcNamara's subsequent equal opportunity commitment to the President.\r\nObviously more could be achieved through voluntary compliance if the\r\nthreat of legal sanctions were available. In the summer of 1964,\r\ntherefore, the Defense Department's manpower officials turned to new\r\nfederal civil rights legislation for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Civil Rights, 1964-1966_\r\n\r\nThe need for strong civil rights legislation had become increasingly\r\napparent in the wake of _Brown_ v. _Board of Education_.[23-18] With\r\nthat decision, the judicial branch finally lined up definitively with\r\nthe executive in opposition to segregation. But the effect of this\r\nunited opposition was blunted by the lack of a strong civil rights\r\nlaw, something that President Kennedy had not been able to wrestle\r\nfrom a reluctant legislative branch. The demands of the civil rights\r\nmovement only underscored the inability of court judgments and     (p. 587)\r\nexecutive orders alone to guarantee the civil rights of all Americans.\r\nSuch a profound social change in American society required the\r\nconcerted action of all three branches of government, and by 1963 the\r\ndrive for strong civil rights legislation had made such legislation\r\nthe paramount domestic political issue. Lyndon Johnson fully\r\nunderstood its importance. \"We have talked long enough in this country\r\nabout equal rights,\" he told his old colleagues in Congress, \"we have\r\ntalked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next\r\nchapter, and to write it in the books of law.\"[23-19]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-18: _Benjamin Muse, The American Negro\r\n                   Revolution: From Nonviolence to Black Power,\r\n                   1963-1967_ (Bloomington: University of Indiana\r\n                   Press, 1968).

A southerner in quest of\r\nnational support, Johnson was determined for very practical reasons to\r\ncarry out the civil rights program of his slain predecessor and to end\r\nthe long rule of Jim Crow in many areas of the country. He let it be\r\nknown that he would accept no watered-down law.\r\n\r\n     I made my position [on the civil rights bill] unmistakably clear:\r\n     We were not prepared to compromise in any way. \"So far as this\r\n     administration is concerned,\" I told a press conference, \"its\r\n     position is firm.\" I wanted absolutely no room for bargaining....\r\n     I knew that the slightest wavering on my part would give hope to\r\n     the opposition's strategy of amending the bill to death.[23-20]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-20: Lyndon B.

Wofford later noted.[23-21] The new President\r\nexhorted his countrymen: \"To the extent that Negroes were imprisoned,\r\nso was I ... to the extent that Negroes were free, really free, so was\r\nI. And so was my country.\"[23-22] Skillfully employing the wave of\r\nsympathy for equal rights that swept the country after John Kennedy's\r\ndeath, President Johnson procured a powerful civil rights act, which\r\nhe signed on 2 July 1964.[23-23]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-21: Interv, Bernhard with Wofford, 29 Nov\r\n                   65.

Its major provisions outlawed\r\ndiscrimination in places of amusement and public accommodation, in\r\npublic education, labor unions, employment, and housing. It called for\r\nfederal intervention in voting rights cases and established a\r\nCommunity Relations Service in the Department of Commerce to arbitrate\r\nracial disputes. The act also strengthened the Civil Rights Commission\r\nand broadened its powers. It authorized the United States Attorney\r\nGeneral and private citizens to bring suit in discrimination cases,\r\noutlining the procedures for such cases. Most significant were\r\nthe sweeping provisions of the law's Title VI that forbade         (p. 588)\r\ndiscrimination in any activity or program that received federal\r\nfinancial assistance. This added the threat of economic sanctions\r\nagainst any of those thousands of institutions, whether public or\r\nprivate, which, while enjoying federal benefactions, discriminated\r\nagainst citizens because of race. Accurately characterized as the\r\n\"most effective instrument yet found for the elimination of racial\r\ndiscrimination,\"[23-24] Title VI gave the federal government leave to\r\ncut segregation and discrimination out of the body politic. In\r\nProfessor Woodward's words, \"a national consensus was in the making\r\nand a peaceful solution was in sight.\"[23-25]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-24: Muse, _The American Negro\r\n                   Revolution_, p. 183.

Believing\r\nthat \"great social change tends to come rapidly in periods of intense\r\nactivity before the impulse slows,\"[23-26] he considered his victory a\r\nmandate for further social reform. On the advice of the Justice\r\nDepartment and the Civil Rights Commission, he called on Congress to\r\neliminate the \"barriers to the right to vote.\"[23-27]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-26: Johnson, \"Remarks at the National\r\n                   Urban League's Community Action Assembly,\" 10 Dec\r\n                   64, as reproduced in _Public Papers of the\r\n                   Presidents: Johnson, 1963-1964_, II:1653.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-27: Lyndon B.

With\r\nbipartisan support, the President introduced a measure aimed directly\r\nat states that discriminated against black voters, providing for the\r\nabolition of literacy tests, appointment of federal examiners to\r\nregister voters for all elections, and assignment of federal\r\nsupervisors for those elections. The Twenty-fourth Amendment, adopted\r\nin February 1964, had eliminated the poll tax in federal elections,\r\nand the President's new measure carried a strong condemnation of the\r\nuse of the poll tax in state elections as well.\r\n\r\nIn all of his efforts the President had the unwitting support of the\r\nsegregationists, who treated the nation to another sordid racial\r\nspectacular. In February 1965 Alabama police jailed Martin Luther\r\nKing, Jr., and some 2,000 members of his voting rights drive, and a\r\ngenerally outraged nation watched King's later clash with the police\r\nover a voting rights march. This time he and his followers were\r\nstopped at a bridge in Selma, Alabama, by state troopers using tear\r\ngas and clubs. The incident climaxed months of violence that saw the\r\nmurder of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi; the\r\nharassment of the Mississippi Summer Project, a voting registration\r\ncampaign sponsored by several leading civil rights organizations; and\r\nended in the assassination of a white Unitarian minister, James    (p. 589)\r\nReeb, of Washington, D.C., one of the hundreds of clergymen, students,\r\nand other Americans who had joined in the King demonstrations.\r\nAddressing a joint session of Congress on the voting rights bill, the\r\nPresident alluded to the Selma incident, declaring: \"Their cause must\r\nbe our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all\r\nof us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.\r\nAnd we shall overcome.\"[23-28]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-28: Lyndon B. Johnson, \"Speech Before\r\n                   Joint Session of Congress,\" 15 Mar 65, _Public\r\n                   Papers of the Presidents: Johnson, 1965_, I:284.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDICAL EXAMINATION. _Navy doctor on duty, Yokosuka,\r\nJapan._]\r\n\r\nThe President's bill passed easily with bipartisan support, and he\r\nsigned it on 6 August 1965. Two days later federal examiners were on\r\nthe job in three states. The act promised a tremendous difference in\r\nthe political complexion of significant portions of the country. In\r\nless than a year federal examiners certified 124,000 new voters in\r\nfour states and almost half of all eligible Negroes were registered to\r\nvote in the states and counties covered by the law. Another result of\r\nthe new legislation was that the Attorney General played an active\r\nrole in the 1966 defeat of the state poll tax laws in _Harper_ v.\r\n_Virginia Board of Elections_.[23-29]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-29: 383 U.S. 663 (1966).]\r\n\r\nUseful against legalized discrimination, chiefly in the south, the\r\ncivil rights laws of the mid-1960's were conspicuously less successful\r\nin those areas where discrimination operated outside the law. In the\r\ngreat urban centers of the north and west, home of some 45 percent of\r\nthe black population, _de facto_ segregation in housing, employment,\r\nand education had excluded millions of Negroes from the benefits of\r\neconomic progress. This ghettoization, this failure to meet human\r\nneeds, led to the alienation of many young Americans and a bitter\r\nresentment against society that was dramatized just five days after\r\nthe signing of the 1965 voting rights act when the Watts section of\r\nLos Angeles exploded in flames and violence. There had been racial\r\nunrest before, especially during the two previous summers when\r\nflare-ups occurred in Cambridge (Maryland), Philadelphia,\r\nJacksonville, Brooklyn, Cleveland, and elsewhere, but Watts was a\r\ndifferent matter. Before the California National Guard with some\r\nlogistical help from the Army quelled the riots, thirty-four people\r\nwere killed, some 4,000 arrested, and $35 million worth of property\r\ndamaged or destroyed. The greatest civil disturbance since the 1943\r\nDetroit riot, Watts was but the first in a series of urban         (p. 590)\r\ndisturbances which refuted the general belief that the race problem\r\nhad been largely solved in cities of the north and the west.[23-30]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-30: For an account of the Watts riot and\r\n                   its aftermath, see Robert Conot, _Rivers of Blood,\r\n                   Years of Darkness_ (New York: Bantam Books, 1967),\r\n                   and Anthony Platt, ed., _The Politics of Riot\r\n                   Commissions_ (New York: Collin Books, 1971), ch.\r\n                   vi.]\r\n\r\nDiscrimination in housing was a major cause of black urban unrest, and\r\nhousing was foremost among the areas of discrimination still untouched\r\nby federal legislation. The housing provision of the 1964 Civil Rights\r\nAct was severely limited, and Johnson rejected the idea of yet another\r\nexecutive order proposed by his Committee on Equal Opportunity in\r\nHousing. Like the order signed by Kennedy, it could cover only new\r\nhousing and even that with dubious legality. Johnson, relying on the\r\ncivil rights momentum developed over the previous years, decided\r\ninstead to press for a comprehensive civil rights bill that would\r\noutlaw discrimination in the sale of all housing. The new measure was\r\nalso designed to attack several other residual areas of\r\ndiscrimination, including jury selection and the physical protection\r\nof Negroes and civil rights workers. Although he enjoyed a measure of\r\nbipartisan support for these latter sections of the bill, the\r\nPresident failed to overcome the widespread opposition to open\r\nhousing, and the 1966 civil rights bill died in the Senate, thereby\r\npostponing an effective law on open housing until after the\r\nassassination of Dr. King in 1968.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of demonstrators and riots in northern cities and the\r\nappearance in 1966 of the \"black power\" slogan considered ominous by\r\nmany citizens were blamed for the bill's failure. Another and more\r\nlikely cause was that in violating the sanctity of the all-white\r\nneighborhood Johnson had gone beyond any national consensus on civil\r\nrights. In August 1966, for example, a survey by the Louis Harris\r\norganization revealed that some 46 percent of white America would\r\nobject to having a black family as next-door neighbors and 70 percent\r\nbelieved that Negroes \"were trying to move too fast.\" Of particular\r\nimportance to the Department of Defense, which would be taking some\r\nequal opportunity steps in the housing field in the next months, was\r\nthe fact that this opposition was not translated into a general\r\nrejection of the concept of equal opportunity. In fact, although the\r\nbill failed to win enough votes to apply the Senate's cloture rule,\r\nthe President could boast that he won a clear majority in both houses.\r\nHis defeat slowed the pace of the civil rights movement and postponed\r\na solution to a major domestic problem; postponed, because, as Roy\r\nWilkins reminded his fellow citizens at the time, \"the problem is not\r\ngoing away ... the Negro is not going away.\"[23-31]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-31: Both the Harris and Wilkins remarks\r\n                   are quoted in Sundquist, \"Building the Great\r\n                   Society,\" pp. 205-06.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Civil Rights Act and Voluntary Compliance_\r\n\r\nThe enactment of new civil rights legislation in 1964 had thrust the\r\narmed forces into the heart of the civil rights movement in a special\r\nway. As Secretary McNamara himself reminded his subordinates,\r\nPresident Johnson was determined to have each federal department\r\ndevelop programs and policies that would give meaning to the new   (p. 591)\r\nlegislation. That legislation, he added, created \"new opportunities\"\r\nto win full equality for all servicemen. The secretary made the usual\r\nconnection between discrimination and military efficiency, adding that\r\n\"this reason alone\" compelled departmental action.[23-32] Obviously\r\nother reasons existed, and when McNamara called on all commanders to\r\nsupport their men in the \"lawful assertion of the rights guaranteed\"\r\nby the act he was making his more than 300 local commanders agents of\r\nthe new federal legislation.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-32: Memo, SecDef for SA et al., 10 Jul\r\n                   64, copy in CMH; see also SecDef News Conference,\r\n                   15 Jul 64, p. 13, OASD (PA).]\r\n\r\nDefense officials quickly arranged for the publication of directives\r\nand regulations applying the provisions of the new law to the whole\r\ndefense establishment. To insure, as McNamara put it, that military\r\ncommanders understood their responsibility for seeing that those in\r\nuniform were accorded fair treatment as prescribed by the new law,\r\nAssistant Secretary Paul had already ordered the services to advise\r\nthe rank and file of their rights and instruct commanders to seek\r\ncivilian cooperation for the orderly application of the act to\r\nservicemen.[23-33] After considering the service comments solicited by\r\nhis civil rights deputy,[23-34] Paul issued a departmental instruction\r\non 24 July that prescribed specific policies and procedures for\r\nprocessing the requests of uniformed men and women for legal action\r\nunder Titles II (Public Accommodations), III (Public Facilities), and\r\nIV (Public Education) of the act.

Although this\r\ndirective would affect the Department of Defense chiefly through the\r\nNational Guard and various civil defense programs, it was          (p. 592)\r\nnevertheless a potential source of economic leverage for use by the\r\narmed forces in the fight against discrimination.[23-38] Furthermore,\r\nthis directive, unlike McNamara's equal opportunity directive of the\r\nprevious year, was supported by federal legislation and thus escaped\r\nthe usual criticism suffered by his earlier directives on\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-36: DOD Directive 5500.11, 28 Dec 64.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-37: Memo, ASD (M) for Dir, BOB, 15 Jul\r\n                   64, sub: Defense Department Regulations to\r\n                   Implement Title VI of the Civil Rights Act; see\r\n                   also Ltr, Spec Asst to DASD (CR), to Gesell, 24 Jul\r\n                   64; copies of both in Gesell Collection, J.

Given the passage of the act and\r\nother federal legislation, pronouncements of the federal courts, and\r\nthe broad advance of racial tolerance throughout the nation, the\r\nDefense Department's civil rights officials came to expect that most\r\ndiscrimination could be dealt with in a routine manner. As Robert E.\r\nJordan III, a staff assistant to the department's civil rights deputy,\r\nput it, the use of sanctions would not \"normally\" be invoked when the\r\nCivil Rights Act or other laws could provide a judicial remedy.[23-39]\r\nFitt predicted that only a \"very tiny number\" of requests by\r\nservicemen for suits under the act would ever be processed all the way\r\nthrough to the courts. He expected to see many voluntary settlements\r\nachieved by commanders spurred to action by the filing of requests for\r\nsuit.[23-40]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-39: Ltr, Jordan to William A.

Each service had reported \"really surprising\r\nexamples of progress\" in obtaining integrated off-base housing in\r\nneighborhoods adjoining military installations and heavily populated\r\nby service families. The services also reported good progress in\r\nobtaining integrated off-duty education for servicemen, as distinct\r\nfrom their dependents in the public schools.[23-41] At the same time\r\nlesser but noticeable progress was reported in Titles II and III\r\ncases. In the first off-base inventory some 145 installations in\r\ntwenty states had reported widespread discrimination in nearby\r\nrestaurants, hotels, bars, bowling alleys, and other Title II\r\nbusinesses; forty installations in nine states reported similar\r\ndiscrimination in libraries, city parks, and stadiums (Title III\r\ncategories). Each succeeding inventory reported impressive reductions\r\nin these figures.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-41: Memo, Timpane (Staff Asst) for\r\n                   Shulman, DASD (CP, IR, & CR), 11 Feb 65, sub:\r\n                   Service Reports on Equal Rights Activities, ASD (M)\r\n                   291.2.]\r\n\r\nDefense Department officials observed that the amount of progress\r\ndepended considerably on the size of the base, its proximity to the\r\nlocal community, and the relationship between the commander and local\r\nleaders. Progress was most notable at large bases near towns. The\r\ninfluence of the Civil Rights Act on cases involving servicemen was\r\nalso readily apparent. But above all, these officials pointed to the\r\npersonal efforts of the local commander as the vital factor. Many\r\ncommanders were able to use the off-base inventory itself as a weapon\r\nto fight discrimination, especially when the philosophy of \"if     (p. 593)\r\neverybody else desegregates I will\" was so prevalent. Nor could the\r\neffect of commanders' achievements be measured merely in terms of\r\nhotels and restaurants open to black servicemen. The knowledge that\r\nhis commander was fighting for his rights in the community gave a\r\ntremendous boost to the black serviceman's morale. It followed that\r\nwhen a commander successfully forced a change in the practices of a\r\nbusiness establishment, even one only rarely frequented by servicemen,\r\nhe stirred a new pride and self-respect in his men.[23-42]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-42: For discussion of command initiatives\r\n                   and black morale, see Memo, DASD (CR) for Under SA\r\n                   et al., 25 May 64, sub: Off-Base Equal Opportunity\r\n                   Inventories; Fitt, \"Remarks Before Civilian Aides\r\n                   Conference of the Secretary of the Army,\" 6 Mar 64;\r\n                   Memo, DASD (CR) for Burke Marshall, Dept of\r\n                   Justice, 20 Mar 64, sub: The Civil Rights of Negro\r\n                   Servicemen. Copies of all in CMH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Limits of Voluntary Compliance_\r\n\r\nIf the Civil Rights Act strengthened the hands of the commander, it\r\nalso quickly revealed the ultimate limits of voluntary compliance\r\nitself. The campaign against Titles II and III discrimination was only\r\none facet of the Department of Defense's battle against off-base\r\ndiscrimination, which also included major attacks against\r\ndiscrimination in the National Guard, in the public schools, and,\r\nfinally, in housing. It was in these areas that the limits of\r\nvoluntary compliance were reached, and the technique was abandoned in\r\nfavor of economic sanctions.\r\n\r\nBecause of its intimate connection with the Department of Defense, the\r\nNational Guard appeared to be an easy target in the attack against\r\noff-base discrimination. Although Secretary McNamara had accepted his\r\ndepartment's traditional voluntary approach toward ending\r\ndiscrimination in this major reserve component,[23-43] the possibility\r\nof using sanctions against the guard had been under discussion for\r\nsome time. As early as 1949 the legal counsel of the National Guard\r\nBureau had concluded that the federal government had the right to\r\ncompel integration.[23-44] Essentially the same stand was taken in\r\n1961 by the Defense Department's Assistant General Counsel for\r\nManpower.[23-45]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-43: For the discussion of McNamara's\r\n                   initial dealings with the National Guard on the\r\n                   subject of race, see Chapter 20.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-44: \"Opinion of the Legal Adviser of the\r\n                   National Guard Bureau, April 1949,\" reproduced in\r\n                   Special Board to Study Negro Participation in the\r\n                   Army National Guard (ARNG) and the United States\r\n                   Army Reserve (USAR), \"Participation of Negroes in\r\n                   the Reserve Components of the Army,\" 3 vols.

Indeed, there is no evidence\r\nof opposition to this position in the 1940's, and southern guard\r\nleaders openly accepted federal supremacy during the period when the\r\nArmy and Air Force were segregated. But in the 1960's, long after  (p. 594)\r\nthe services had integrated their active forces and seemed to be\r\nmoving toward a similar policy for the guard, doubts about federal\r\nauthority over a peacetime guard appeared. The National Guard Bureau\r\ndisputed the 1949 opinion of its legal counsel and the more recent one\r\nfrom the Defense Department and stressed the political implications of\r\nforcing integration; a bureau spokesman asserted that \"an ultimatum to\r\na governor that he must commit political suicide in order to obtain\r\nfederal support for his National Guard will be rejected.\" Moreover, if\r\nfederal officials insisted on integration, the bureau foresaw a\r\ndeterioration of guard units to the detriment of national\r\nsecurity.[23-47]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-46: For a discussion of earlier efforts\r\n                   to integrate the New Jersey National Guard and the\r\n                   attitude of individual states toward Defense\r\n                   Department requests, see Chapter 12.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-47: Memo, Legal Adviser, NGB, for Bruce\r\n                   Docherty, Office of the General Counsel, DA, 19 Jul\r\n                   63, sub: Authority to Require Integration in the\r\n                   National Guard, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTO PILOT SHOP. _Airmen check out equipment, Biggs Air\r\nForce Base, Texas._]\r\n\r\nThe National Guard Bureau supported voluntary integration, and its\r\nchiefs tried in 1962 and 1963 to prod state adjutants general into\r\ntaking action on their own account. Citing the success some states,\r\nnotably Texas, enjoyed in continuing the integration their units first\r\nexperienced during federalized service in the Berlin call-up, Maj.\r\nGen. D. W. McGowan warned other state organizations that outright\r\ndefiance of federal authorities could not be maintained indefinitely\r\nand would eventually lead to integration enforced by Washington.[23-48]\r\nReplies from the state adjutants varied, but in some cases it      (p. 595)\r\nbecame clear that the combination of persuasion and quiet pressure\r\nmight bring change. The Louisiana adjutant general, for example,\r\nreported that considering the feelings in his state's legislature any\r\nmove toward integration would require \"a selling job.\" At the same\r\ntime, he carefully admitted, \"some of these days, the thing\r\n[integration] is probably inevitable.\"[23-49] The administration,\r\nhowever, continued to take the view that integration of the National\r\nGuard was a special problem because the leverage available to\r\nimplement it was in no way comparable to the federal government's\r\ncontrol over the active forces or the organized reserves.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-48: Ltrs, Chief, NGB, to AG's of Alabama\r\n                   et al., 3 Mar 62, 3 Jul 63, and 9 Dec 63; see also\r\n                   Williams Board Rpt, II: 36.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-49: Ltr, Maj Gen Raymond H.

Title VI of the act undercut all arguments\r\nagainst federal supremacy over the guard, for it no longer mattered\r\nwho had technical responsibility for units in peacetime. In practical\r\nterms, the power to integrate clearly rested now with the federal\r\ngovernment, which in a complete reversal of its earlier policy showed\r\na disposition to use it. On 15 February 1965 Deputy Secretary of\r\nDefense Vance ordered the Army and Air Force to amend National Guard\r\nregulations to eliminate any trace of racial discrimination and \"to\r\nensure that the policy of equal opportunity and treatment is clearly\r\nstated.\"[23-52] Vance's order produced a speedy change in the states,\r\nso much so that later in 1965 the Department of Defense was finally\r\nable to oppose New York Congressman Abraham J. Multer's biannual bill\r\nto withhold federal aid from segregated guard units on the grounds\r\nthat there were no longer any such units.[23-53]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-52: Memo, Dep SecDef for SA and SecAF, 15\r\n                   Feb 65, sub: Equality of Opportunity in the\r\n                   National Guard, SD 291.2; see also Memo, Chief,\r\n                   NGB, for Chief, Office of Reserve Components, 27\r\n                   Jan 65.

Alfred Fitt summarized these feelings in\r\n1964:\r\n\r\n     The imposition of unconstitutionally segregated schooling on\r\n     their children is particularly galling for the Negro servicemen.\r\n     As comparative transients--and as military men accustomed to\r\n     avoiding controversy with civilian authorities--they cannot\r\n     effectively sue for the constitutional rights of their sons and\r\n     daughters. Yet they see their children, fresh from the integrated\r\n     environment which is the rule on military installations,\r\n     condemned to schools which are frequently two, even three grades\r\n     behind the integrated schools these same children had attended\r\n     on-base or at their fathers' previous duty stations.[23-54]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-54: Memo, DASD (CR) for Burke Marshall,\r\n                   20 Mar 64, sub: The Civil Rights of Negro\r\n                   Servicemen, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThere was much to be said for the Defense Department's theory that an\r\nappeal for voluntary compliance would produce much integration in\r\noff-base schools attended by military dependents. That these children\r\nwere the offspring of men serving in defense of their country was\r\nlikely to have considerable impact in the south, especially, with its\r\nstrong military traditions. That the children had in most cases\r\nalready attended integrated schools, competing and learning with\r\nchildren of another race, was likely to make their integration more\r\nacceptable to educators.\r\n\r\nBeyond these special reasons, the services could expect help from new\r\nlegislation and new administration rulings. The Civil Rights Act of\r\n1960, for example, had authorized the Department of Health, Education,\r\nand Welfare to provide integrated education for military dependents in\r\nareas where public schools were discontinued. In March 1962 Secretary\r\nof Health, Education, and Welfare Abraham Ribicoff announced that\r\nracially segregated schools were no longer \"suitable\" institutions\r\nunder the terms of Public Laws 815 and 879 and that beginning in\r\nSeptember 1963 his department would \"exercise sound discretion, take\r\nappropriate steps\" to provide integrated education for military\r\ndependents. If the children were withdrawn from local school systems\r\nto achieve this, he warned, so too the federal aid.[23-55] Lending\r\ncredence to Ribicoff's warning, his department undertook a survey in\r\nthe fall of 1962 of selected military installations to determine the\r\neducational status of military dependents.[23-56] On 17 September 1962\r\nAttorney General Kennedy filed suit in Richmond to bar the use of\r\nfederal funds in the segregated schools of Prince George County,\r\nVirginia, the location of Fort Lee.[23-57] Finally, in January 1963,\r\nthe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare announced that unless\r\nstate officials relented it would start a crash program of\r\nconstruction and operation of integrated schools for military\r\ndependents in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina.[23-58]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-55: Ltr, Actg U.S. Comm of Ed to\r\n                   Superintendent of Public Instruction, Fla., et al.,\r\n                   6 Nov 62, with incls; see also Memo for Rcd, Evans,\r\n                   20 Nov 62, sub: Schools for Dependents, copies of\r\n                   both in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-56: AFNS, Release No. 2851, 17 Aug 62.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-57: Four similar suits were filed in\r\n                   January 1963 regarding segregation in Huntsville\r\n                   and Mobile, Alabama; Gulfport and Biloxi,\r\n                   Mississippi; and Bossier Parish, Louisiana.

The commandant of the Marine\r\nCorps Schools, Quantico, for example, won an agreement from Stafford\r\nCounty, Virginia, authorities that the county would open its high\r\nschool and two elementary schools to Marine Corps dependents without\r\nregard to race. The commandant also announced that schools in Albany,\r\nGeorgia, had agreed to take military dependents on an integrated\r\nbasis.[23-59] The Air Force announced that schools near Eglin,\r\nWhiting, and MacDill Air Force Bases in Florida as well as those near\r\nsix bases in Texas, including Sheppard and Connally, would integrate.\r\nThe Under Secretary of the Navy reported similar successes in school\r\ndistricts in Florida, Tennessee, and Texas. And the commander of Fort\r\nBelvoir started discussions with the Fairfax County, Virginia, school\r\nboard looking toward the speedy desegregation of schools near the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-59: Both the Marine Corps and the Navy\r\n                   operated installations in the vicinity of Albany,\r\n                   Georgia.]\r\n\r\nLest any commander hesitate, the Department of Defense issued a new\r\npolicy in regard to the education of military dependents. On 15 July\r\n1963 Assistant Secretary Paul directed all local commanders in areas\r\nwhere public education was still segregated--large parts of some\r\nfifteen states--to counsel parents on the procedures available for the\r\ntransfer of their children to integrated schools, on how to appeal\r\nassignment to segregated schools, and on legal action as an\r\nalternative to accepting local school board decisions to bar their\r\nchildren.[23-60] In December 1963 Fitt drew up contingency plans for\r\nthe education of dependent children in the event of local school\r\nclosings.[23-61] In April of 1964 Fitt reminded the services that\r\nDefense Department policy called for the placement of military\r\ndependents in integrated schools and that commanders were expected to\r\nmake \"appropriate efforts\" on behalf of the children to eliminate any\r\ndeviation from that policy.[23-62] In effect, base commanders were\r\nbeing given a specific role in the fight to secure for black and white\r\ndependents equal access to public schools.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-60: Memo, ASD (M) for SA et al., 15 Jul\r\n                   63, sub: Assignment of Dependents of Military\r\n                   Personnel to Public Schools, ASD(M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-61: Memo, DASD (CR) for Under SecNav, 4\r\n                   Dec 63, sub: Dependent Schooling in Closed School\r\n                   Districts; Memo, Asst SecNav for DASD (CR), 20 Dec\r\n                   63, same sub; both in SecNav files, GenRecsNav.

At the end of the 1964 school year more\r\nthan 76,300 military dependents, including 6,177 black children, at\r\nforty-nine installations attended segregated schools. Another 14,390\r\nchildren on these same bases attended integrated schools, usually  (p. 598)\r\ngrade school, on the military base itself.[23-63] Because of the\r\nrestrictions against base closings and off-limits sanctions, there was\r\nlittle hope that base commanders could produce any substantial\r\nimprovement in this record. Fitt admitted that the Department of\r\nDefense could not compel the integration of a school district. He\r\nrecognized that it was impossible to establish an accredited\r\ntwelve-grade system at the forty-nine installations, yet at the same\r\ntime he considered it \"incompatible with military requirements\" to\r\nassign black servicemen with children to areas where only integrated\r\nschools were available. Even the threat to deny impacted-area aid was\r\nlimited because in many communities the services' contracts with local\r\nschool districts to educate dependent children was contingent on\r\ncontinuous federal aid. If the aid was stopped the schools would be\r\nclosed, leaving service children with no schools to attend.[23-64]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-63: Memo, DASD (CR) for Under SA et al.,\r\n                   25 May 64, sub: Off-Base Equal Opportunity\r\n                   Inventories, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-64: For an example of how these contracts\r\n                   for the education of dependents were tied to\r\n                   federal aid, see the case concerning Columbus Air\r\n                   Force Base, Mississippi, as discussed in Ltr, DASD\r\n                   (CR) to J.

Copies of both in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe only practical recourse for parents of military dependents, Fitt\r\nbelieved, was to follow the slow process of judicial redress under\r\nTitle IV of the civil rights bill then moving through Congress.\r\nAnticipating the new law, Fitt asked the services to provide him with\r\npertinent data on all school districts where military dependents\r\nattended segregated schools. He planned to use this information in\r\ncooperation with the Departments of Justice and Health, Education, and\r\nWelfare for use in federal suits. He also requested reports on the\r\nefforts made by local commanders to integrate schools used by\r\ndependent children and the responses of local school officials to such\r\nefforts.[23-65] Later, after the new law had been signed by the\r\nPresident, Norman Paul outlined for the services the procedures to be\r\nused for lodging complaints under Titles IV and VI of the Civil Rights\r\nAct and directed that local commanders inform all parents under their\r\ncommand of the remedies afforded them under the new legislation.[23-66]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-65: Memo, DASD (CR) for Spec Asst to\r\n                   SecAF for Manpower, Personnel, and Reserve Forces,\r\n                   23 Jun 64, SecAF files.

With the close of the 1964 spring semester, Paul\r\nannounced, no Defense Department funds would be spent to pay tuition\r\nfor such schooling.[23-67] The economic pressure implicit in this\r\nruling, which for some time had been applied to the education of   (p. 599)\r\ncivilian employees of the department, allowed many base commanders to\r\nnegotiate an end to segregation in off-base schools.[23-68]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-67: Memo, ASD (M) for SA et al., 25 Mar\r\n                   64, sub: Non-Discrimination in Civil Schooling of\r\n                   Military Personnel; Ltr, DASD (CR) to Congressman\r\n                   John Bell Williams of Mississippi, 18 Mar 64; Ltr,\r\n                   DASD (M) to Sen.

Copies of all in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe effort of the Department of Defense to secure education for its\r\nmilitary dependents in integrated schools was, on the whole,\r\nunsuccessful. Integration, when it finally came to most of these\r\ninstitutions later in the 1960's, came principally through the efforts\r\nof the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to enforce Title\r\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yet the role of local military\r\ncommanders in the effort to secure integrated schools cannot be\r\nignored, for with the development of a new policy toward off-base\r\nfacilities in 1963 the commander became a permanent and significant\r\npartner in the administration's fight to desegregate the nation's\r\nschools. In contrast to earlier times when the Department of Defense\r\ndepended on moral suasion to desegregate schools used by servicemen's\r\nchildren, its commanders now educated parents on their legal rights,\r\ncollected data to support class action suits, and negotiated with\r\nschool boards. If the primary impetus for this activity was the Civil\r\nRights Act of 1964, the philosophy of the Gesell Committee and the\r\nSecretary of Defense's directive were also implicit.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination in the sale and lease of housing continued to be the\r\nmost widespread and persistent form of racial injustice encountered by\r\nblack servicemen, and a most difficult one to fight. The chronic\r\nshortage of on-base accommodations, the transient nature of a military\r\nassignment, and the general reluctance of men in uniform to protest\r\npublicly left the average serviceman at the mercy of local landlords\r\nand real estate interests. Nor did he have recourse in law. No\r\nsignificant federal legislation on the subject existed before 1969,\r\nand state laws (by 1967 over half the states had some form of\r\nprohibition against discrimination in public housing and twenty-one\r\nstates had open housing laws) were rather limited, excluding\r\nowner-occupied dwellings, for example, from their provisions. Even\r\nPresident Kennedy's 1962 housing order was restricted to future\r\nbuilding and to housing dependent on federal financing.\r\n\r\nBoth the Civil Rights Commission and the Gesell Committee studied the\r\nproblem in some detail and concluded that the President's directive to\r\nall federal agencies to use their \"good offices\" to push for open\r\nhousing in federally supported housing had not been followed in the\r\nDepartment of Defense. The Civil Rights Commission, in particular,\r\npainted a picture of a Defense Department alternating between naivete\r\nand indifference in connection with the special housing problems of\r\nblack servicemen.[23-69] White House staffer Wofford later decided (p. 600)\r\nthat the Secretary of Defense was dragging his feet on the subject of\r\noff-base housing, although Wofford admitted that each federal agency\r\nwas a forceful advocate of action by other agencies.[23-70]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-69: Memo, ASD (CR) for SecDef, 29 Oct 63,\r\n                   sub: Family Housing and the Negro Serviceman, Civil\r\n                   Rights Commission Staff Report; Memo, ASD (M) for\r\n                   SecDef, 2 Nov 63, sub: Family Housing for Negro\r\n                   Servicemen; both in ASD (M) 291.2.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-70: Interv, Bernhard with Wofford, 29 Nov\r\n                   65, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBMARINE TENDER DUTY. _A senior chief boatswain mate\r\nand master diver at his station on the USS Hunley._]\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Secretary for Manpower conceded in November 1963 that\r\nlittle had been done, but, citing the widely misunderstood off-base\r\ninventory, he pleaded the need to avoid retaliation by segregationist\r\nforces in Congress both on future authorizations for housing and on\r\nthe current civil rights legislation. He recommended that the\r\nDepartment of Defense complete and disseminate to local commanders\r\ninformation packets containing relevant directives, statistics, and\r\nlegal procedures available in the local housing field.[23-71]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-71: Memo, ASD (M) for SecDef, 2 Nov 63,\r\n                   sub: Family Housing for Negro Servicemen, ASD (M)\r\n                   291-2.]\r\n\r\nMcNamara approved this procedure, again investing local commanders\r\nwith responsibility for combating a pervasive form of discrimination\r\nwith a voluntary compliance program. Specifically, local commanders\r\nwere directed to promote open housing near their bases, expanding\r\ntheir open housing lists and pressing the problem of local housing (p. 601)\r\ndiscrimination on their biracial community committees for solution.\r\nThey were helped by the secretary's assistants. His civil rights and\r\nhousing deputies became active participants in the President's housing\r\ncommittee, transmitting to local military commanders the information\r\nand techniques developed in the executive body. McNamara's civil\r\nrights staff inaugurated cooperative programs with state and municipal\r\nequal opportunity commissions and other local open housing bodies,\r\nmaking these community resources available to local commanders.\r\nFinally, in February 1965, the Department of Defense entered into a\r\nformal arrangement with the Federal Housing Administration to provide\r\ncommanders with lists of all housing in their area covered by the\r\nPresident's housing order and to arrange for the lease of foreclosed\r\nFederal Housing Authority properties to military personnel.[23-72]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-72: Ltr, DASD (CR) to Chmn, President's\r\n                   Cmte on Equal Opportunity in Housing, 19 Sep 63,\r\n                   copy in CMH; see also Paul Memo.]\r\n\r\nThese activities had little effect on the military housing situation.\r\nAn occasional apartment complex or trailer court got integrated, but\r\nno substantial progress could be reported in the four years following\r\nSecretary McNamara's 1963 equal opportunity directive. On the\r\ncontrary, the record suggests that many commanders, discouraged\r\nperhaps by the overwhelming difficulties encountered in the fair\r\nhousing field, might agree with Fitt: \"I have no doubt that I did\r\nnothing about it [housing discrimination] in 1963-4 because I was\r\nworking on forms of discrimination at once more blatant and easier to\r\novercome. I did not fully understand the impact of housing\r\ndiscrimination, and I did not know what to do about it.\"[23-73]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-73: Ltr, Fitt to author, 22 May 72.]\r\n\r\nA special Defense Department housing survey of thirteen representative\r\ncommunities, including a study of service families in the Washington,\r\nD.C., area, documented this failure. The survey described a housing\r\nsituation as of early 1967 in which progress toward open off-base\r\nhousing for servicemen was minimal. Despite the active off-base\r\nprograms sponsored by local commanders, discrimination in housing\r\nremained widespread,[23-74] and based on four years' experience the\r\nDepartment of Defense had to conclude that appeals to the community\r\nfor voluntary compliance would not produce integrated housing for\r\nmilitary families on a large scale. Still, defense officials were\r\nreluctant to substitute more drastic measures. Deputy Secretary Vance,\r\nfor one, argued in early 1967 that nationwide application of\r\noff-limits sanctions would raise significant legal issues, create\r\nchaotic conditions in the residential status of all military\r\npersonnel, downgrade rather than enhance the responsibility of local\r\ncommanders to achieve their equal opportunity goals, and, above all,\r\nfail to produce more integrated housing. Writing to the chairman of\r\nthe Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs\r\n(ACCESS),[23-75] he asserted that open housing for servicemen      (p. 602)\r\nwould be achieved only through the \"full commitment at every level of\r\ncommand to the proposition of equal treatment.\"[23-76]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-74: Ltr, Dep SecDef to J.

The center of this particular group's\r\n                   concern was in the Washington, D.C., suburbs.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-76: Ltr, Dep SecDef to Jones, 21 Feb 67,\r\n                   copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nBut even as Vance wrote, the department's housing policy was\r\nundergoing substantial revision. And, ironically, it was the very\r\ngroup to which Vance was writing that precipitated the change. It was\r\nthe members of ACCESS who climaxed their campaign against segregated\r\napartment complexes in the Washington suburbs with a sit-down\r\ndemonstration in McNamara's reception room in the Pentagon on 1\r\nFebruary, bringing the problem to the personal attention of a\r\nSecretary of Defense burdened with Vietnam.[23-77] Although strongly\r\ncommitted to the principle of equal opportunity and always ready to\r\nsupport the initiatives of his civil rights assistants,[23-78]\r\nMcNamara had largely ignored the housing problem. Later he castigated\r\nhimself for allowing the problem to drift for four years.\r\n\r\n     I get charged with the TFX.

The TFX mentioned by McNamara\r\n                   was an allusion to the heated and lengthy\r\n                   controversy that arose during his administration\r\n                   over fighter aircraft for the Navy and Air Force.]\r\n\r\nMcNamara was being unnecessarily harsh with himself. There were\r\nseveral reasons, quite unrelated to either the Secretary of Defense or\r\nhis assistants, that explain the failure of voluntarism to integrate\r\nhousing used by servicemen. A major cause--witness the failure of\r\nPresident Johnson's proposed civil rights bill in 1966--was that open\r\nhousing lacked a national consensus or widespread public support.\r\nVoluntary compliance was successful in other areas, such as public\r\naccommodation, transportation, and to some extent even in dependent\r\nschooling, precisely because the requests of local commanders were\r\nsupported by a growing national consensus and the force of national\r\nlegislation. In dealing with housing discrimination, however, these\r\nsame commanders faced public indifference or open hostility without\r\nthe comforting support of federal law. Even with the commander's\r\nwholehearted commitment to open housing, a commitment that equal\r\nopportunity directives from the services could by no means insure, his\r\neffectiveness against such widespread discrimination was questionable.\r\nNothing in his training prepared him for the delicate negotiations\r\ninvolved in obtaining integrated housing. Moreover, it was extremely\r\ndifficult if not impossible to isolate the black serviceman's housing\r\nplight from that of other black citizens; thus, an open housing\r\ncampaign really demanded comprehensive action by the whole federal\r\ngovernment. The White House had never launched a national open housing\r\ncampaign; it was not, indeed, until 16 February 1967 that President\r\nJohnson submitted a compulsory national open housing bill to\r\nCongress.[23-80]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-80: A weakened version of this bill\r\n                   eventually emerged as the Civil Rights Act of\r\n                   1968.]\r\n\r\nWhatever the factors contributing to the lack of progress,         (p. 603)\r\nMcNamara admitted that \"the voluntary program had failed and failed\r\nmiserably.\"[23-81] Philosophically, Robert McNamara found this\r\nsituation intolerable. He had become interested in the \"unused\r\npotential\" of his department to change American society as it affected\r\nthe welfare of servicemen. As Fitt explained, the secretary believed\r\n\r\n     any department which administers 10% of the gross national\r\n     product, with influence over the lives of 10 million people, is\r\n     bound to have an impact. The question is whether it's going to be\r\n     a dumb, blind impact, or a marshaled and ordered impact.\r\n\r\n     McNamara wanted to marshal that impact by committing defense\r\n     resources to social goals that were still compatible with the\r\n     primary mission of security.[23-82]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-81: McNamara, _The Essence of Security_,\r\n                   p. 124.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-82: Quoted by Brower, \"McNamara Seen Now,\r\n                   Full Length,\" p. 89.]\r\n\r\nClearly, the Secretary of Defense considered open housing for service\r\nfamilies one of these goals, and when his attention was drawn to the\r\nimmediacy of the problem by the ACCESS demonstration he acted quickly.\r\nAt his instigation Vance ordered the local commanders of all services\r\nto conduct a nationwide census of all apartment houses, housing\r\ndevelopments, and mobile home courts consisting of five or more rental\r\nunits within normal commuting distance of all installations having at\r\nleast 500 servicemen. He also ordered the commanders to talk to the\r\nowners or operators of these properties personally and to urge them to\r\nopen their properties to all servicemen. He organized an Off-base\r\nEqual Opportunity Board, consisting of the open housing coordinators\r\nof each service and his office to monitor the census. Finally, he\r\nannounced the establishment of a special action program under the\r\ndirection of Thomas D. Morris, now the Assistant Secretary for\r\nManpower. Aimed at the Washington, D.C., area specifically, the\r\nprogram was designed to serve as a model for the rest of the\r\ncountry.[23-83]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-83: Memo, Dep SecDef for Secys of\r\n                   Military Departments, 11 Apr 67, sub: Equal\r\n                   Opportunity for Military Personnel in Rental of\r\n                   Off-Base Housing.

Copies\r\n                   of both in CMH.]\r\n\r\nVance also notified the service secretaries that subsequent to the\r\ncensus all local commanders would be asked to discuss the census\r\nfindings with local community leaders in an effort to mobilize support\r\nfor open housing. Later Assistant Secretary Morris, with the help of\r\nthe acting civil rights deputy, L. Howard Bennett, spelled out a\r\nprogram for \"aggressive\" negotiation with community leaders and\r\ncooperation with other government agencies, in effect a last-ditch\r\nattempt to achieve open housing for servicemen through voluntary\r\ncompliance. Underscoring the urgency of the housing campaign, the\r\ndepartment demanded a monthly report from all commanders on their open\r\nhousing activities,[23-84] and Morris promptly launched a\r\nproselytizing effort of his own in the metropolitan Washington area.\r\nDescribed simply by McNamara as \"a decent man,\" Morris spoke\r\nindefatigably before civil leaders and realtors on behalf of open\r\nhousing.[23-85]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-84: Memos, ASD (M) for Dep Under Secys of\r\n                   Military Departments, 22 Apr and 17 Jul 67, sub:\r\n                   Equal Opportunity for Military Personnel in Rental\r\n                   of Off-Base Housing.

The\r\nSecretary of Defense himself, not the local commander nor the service\r\nsecretaries, made the decision: housing not opened to _all_ servicemen\r\nwould be closed to _all_ servicemen.[23-87] Aware of the controversy\r\naccompanying such action, the secretary's legal counsel prepared a\r\njustification. Predictably, the department's lawyer argued that\r\nsanctions against discrimination in off-base housing were an extension\r\nof the commander's traditional right to forbid commerce with\r\nestablishments whose policies adversely affected the health or morals\r\nof his men. Acutely conscious of the lack of federal legislation\r\nbarring housing discrimination, Vance and his legal associates were\r\ncareful to distinguish between an owner's legal right to choose his\r\ntenants and the commander's power to impose a military order on his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-86: McNamara, _The Essence of Security_,\r\n                   p. 126.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-87: Interv, author with McNamara, 11 May\r\n                   72.]\r\n\r\nAlthough committed to a nationwide imposition of sanctions on housing\r\nif necessary, the Secretary of Defense hoped that the example of a few\r\ncases would be sufficient to break the intransigence of offending\r\nlandlords; certainly a successful test case would strengthen the hand\r\nof the commanders in their negotiations with community leaders.\r\nMetropolitan Washington was the obvious area for the first test case,\r\nand the Maryland General Assembly further focused attention on that\r\nregion when on 28 February 1967 it called on the Secretary of Defense\r\nto end housing discrimination for all military personnel in the\r\nstate.[23-88] On the night of 21 June, Gerhard Gesell received an\r\nunexpected phone call: there would be something in tomorrow's paper,\r\nRobert McNamara told him, that should be especially interesting to the\r\njudge.[23-89] And there was, indeed, on the front page. As of 1 July,\r\nall military personnel would be forbidden to lease or rent housing in\r\nany segregated apartment building or trailer court within a\r\nthree-and-a-half-mile radius of Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.\r\nCiting the special housing problems of servicemen returning from\r\nVietnam, McNamara pointed out that in the Andrews area of Maryland\r\nless than 3 percent of some 22,000 local apartment units were open to\r\nblack servicemen. The Andrews situation, he declared, was causing\r\nproblems \"detrimental to the morale and welfare of the majority of our\r\nNegro military families and thus to the operational effectiveness of\r\nthe base.\"[23-90]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-88: Joint Resolution 47 of the Maryland\r\n                   General Assembly as cited in Memo, SecDef for\r\n                   Secretaries of Military Departments, 22 Jun 67,\r\n                   sub: Unsatisfactory Housing of Negro Military\r\n                   Families Living Off-Post in the Andrews Air Force\r\n                   Base Area, copy in CMH.

No less a personage than Chairman\r\nL. Mendel Rivers of the House Armed Services Committee admitted that\r\nhe had no objection to the sanctions near Andrews. Asked about\r\npossible sanctions elsewhere, Rivers added that he would cross that\r\nbridge later.[23-91]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-91: New York _Times_, June 23, 1967.\r\n                   Rivers did criticize later applications of the\r\n                   housing sanctions; see Washington _Post_, December\r\n                   28, 1977.]\r\n\r\nRivers and his congressional allies would have little time for\r\nreflection, because McNamara quickly made it clear that the Andrews\r\naction was only a first step. Sanctions were imposed in rapid\r\nsuccession on areas surrounding four other military installations in\r\nMaryland, Fort George G. Meade, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Edgewood\r\nArsenal, and Fort Holabird.[23-92] More pressure was placed on\r\nsegregationists when McNamara announced on 8 September his intention\r\nto extend the sanctions nationwide. He singled out California, where\r\nthe Defense Department census had shown black servicemen barred from a\r\nthird of all rental units, for special attention. In fact, off-limits\r\nsanctions imposed on broad geographical areas were used only once\r\nmore--in December 1967 against multiple rental properties in the\r\nnorthern Virginia area.[23-93] In the meantime, the Department of\r\nDefense had developed a less dramatic but equally effective method of\r\nexerting economic pressure on landlords. On 17 July 1967 McNamara\r\nordered the establishment of housing referral offices at all\r\ninstallations where more than 500 men were assigned. All married\r\nservicemen seeking off-base housing were required to obtain prior\r\nclearance from these offices before entering into rental agreements\r\nwith landlords.[23-94]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-92: Actually, McNamara imposed the\r\n                   sanctions in the first two instances, the Secretary\r\n                   of the Army in the other two.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-93: DOD News Release No. 1209-67, 26 Dec\r\n                   67.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-94: Memo, SecDef for Service Secys et\r\n                   al., 17 Jul 67, sub: Off-Base Housing Referral\r\n                   Services, SD files.]\r\n\r\nFinally, in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968\r\nand the Supreme Court's ruling against housing discrimination in\r\n_Jones_ v. _Mayer_, McNamara's successor, Clark M. Clifford, was able\r\nto combine economic threats with new legal sanctions against landlords\r\nwho continued to discriminate. On 20 June 1968 Clifford ordered the\r\nservices to provide advice and legal assistance to servicemen who\r\nencountered discrimination in housing. The services were also to\r\ncoordinate their housing programs with the Departments of Housing and\r\nUrban Development and Justice, provide assistance in locating\r\nnondiscriminatory rental units, and withhold authorization for\r\nservicemen to sign leases where discriminatory practices were evident.\r\nIn a separate action the manpower assistant secretary also ordered\r\nthat housing referral offices be established on all bases to which\r\n100--as opposed to the earlier 500--military personnel were\r\nassigned.[23-95]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-95: In _Jones_ v. _Mayer_ (392 U.S.\r\n                   409, 421 [1968]) the Supreme Court held that the\r\n                   Civil Rights Act of 1968 \"bars all racial\r\n                   discrimination, private as well as public, in the\r\n                   sale or rental of property.\" For Clifford's\r\n                   response, see Memo, SecDef for Secys of Military\r\n                   Departments, et al., 20 Jun 68; Clark Clifford,\r\n                   News Conference, 20 Jun 68; Memo, ASD (M&RA) for\r\n                   Secys of Military Departments, et al., 25 Nov 68.\r\n                   For instructions concerning legal assistance to\r\n                   servicemen and civilian employees of the Department\r\n                   of Defense under the 1968 Civil Rights Act, see DOD\r\n                   Instr 1338.12, 8 Aug 68. Copy of all in CMH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST AID. _Soldier of the 23d Infantry gives water to\r\nheat stroke victim during \"Operation Wahiawa,\" Vietnam._]\r\n\r\nThe result of these directives was spectacular. By June 1968 the   (p. 606)\r\nratio of off-base housing units carried on military referral\r\nlistings--that is, apartment and trailer court units with open housing\r\npolicies assured in writing by the owner or certified by the local\r\ncommander--rose to some 83 percent of all available off-base housing\r\nfor a gain of 247,000 units over the 1967 inventory.[23-96] In the\r\nsuburban Washington area alone, the number of housing units opened to\r\nall servicemen rose more than 300 percent in 120 days--from 15,000 to\r\nmore than 50,000 units.[23-97] By the end of 1968 some 1.17 million\r\nrental units, 93 percent of all those identified in the 1967 survey,\r\nwere open to all servicemen.[23-98] Still, these impressive gains did\r\nnot signal the end of housing discrimination for black servicemen. The\r\nvarious Defense Department sanctions excluded dwellings for four\r\nfamilies or less, and the evidence suggests that the original and\r\nhastily compiled off-base census on which all the open housing gains\r\nwere measured had ignored some particularly intransigent landlords in\r\nlarger apartment houses and operators of trailer courts on the grounds\r\nthat their continued refusal to negotiate with commanders had made (p. 607)\r\nthe likelihood of integrating their properties extremely remote.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-96: SecDef News Conference, 29 Jun 68,\r\n                   transcript in CMH.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-97: McNamara, _The Essence of Security_,\r\n                   p. 127.]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-98: Bahr, \"_The Expanding Role of the\r\n                   Department of Defense_,\" p. 123.]\r\n\r\nThe campaign for open housing is the most noteworthy chapter in the\r\nfight for equality of treatment and opportunity for servicemen. The\r\nefforts of the Department of Defense against other forms of off-base\r\ndiscrimination were to a great extent successful because they\r\ncoincided with court rulings and powerful civil rights legislation.\r\nThe campaign for open housing, on the other hand, was launched in\r\nadvance of court and congressional action and in the face of much\r\npopular feeling against integrated housing. McNamara's fight for open\r\nhousing demonstrates, as nothing had before, his determination to use,\r\nif necessary, the department's economic powers in the civilian\r\ncommunity to secure equal treatment and opportunity for servicemen. In\r\nthe name of fair housing, McNamara invested not only his own prestige\r\nbut also the Defense Department's manpower and financial resources. In\r\neffect, this willingness to use the extreme weapon of off-limits\r\nsanctions revitalized the idea of using the Department of Defense as\r\nan instrument of social change in American society.\r\n\r\nMcNamara's willingness to push the department beyond the national\r\nconsensus on civil rights (as represented by the contemporary civil\r\nrights laws) also signified a change in his attitude. Unlike\r\nYarmolinsky and Robert Kennedy, McNamara limited his attention to\r\ndiscrimination's effect on the individual serviceman and, ultimately,\r\non the military efficiency of the armed forces. Despite his interest\r\nin the cause of civil rights, he had, until the open housing campaign,\r\nalways circumscribed the department's equal opportunity program to fit\r\na more traditional definition of military mission. Seen in this light,\r\nMcNamara's attack against segregated housing represented not only the\r\nsubstitution of a new and more powerful technique--sanctions--for one\r\nthat had been found wanting--voluntary compliance, but also a\r\nsubstantial evolution in his own social philosophy. He later implied\r\nas much.\r\n\r\n     We request cooperation and seek voluntary compliance [in\r\n     obtaining open housing].... I am fully aware that the Defense\r\n     Department is not a philanthropic foundation or a social-welfare\r\n     institution. But the Department does not intend to let our Negro\r\n     servicemen and their families continue to suffer the injustices\r\n     and indignities they have in the past. I am certain my successors\r\n     will pursue the same policy.[23-99]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-99: McNamara, _The Essence of Security_,\r\n                   p. 127.]\r\n\r\nBy 1967 the major programs derived from Secretary McNamara's equal\r\nopportunity policy had been defined, and the Department of Defense\r\ncould look back with pride on the substantial and permanent changes it\r\nhad achieved in the treatment of black servicemen in communities near\r\nmilitary bases.[23-100] Emphasizing voluntary compliance with its\r\npolicy, the department had proved to be quite successful in its\r\ncampaign against discrimination in off-base recreation, public\r\ntransportation and accommodation, in the organized reserves, and even,\r\nto a limited extent, in off-base schools. It was logical that the\r\nservices should seek voluntary compliance before resorting to more\r\ndrastic methods. As the Gesell Committee had pointed out, base     (p. 608)\r\ncommanders had vast influence in their local communities, influence\r\nthat might be used in countless ways to alter the patterns of off-base\r\ndiscrimination. For the first time the armed forces had fought\r\ndiscrimination by making the local commander responsible for a\r\nsystematic program of negotiations in the community.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-100: This analysis owes much to the\r\n                   author's correspondence with Alfred Fitt and the\r\n                   interviews with McNamara, Gesell, and Jordan. See\r\n                   also Memo, Timpane tor Stephen Schulman, 11 Feb 65,\r\n                   sub: Service Reports of Equal Rights Activities,\r\n                   and Paul Memo. Copies of all in CMH.]\r\n\r\nBut voluntary compliance had its limits. Its success depended in large\r\nmeasure on the ability and will of local commanders, who, for the most\r\npart, were unprepared by training or temperament to deal with the\r\ncomplex and explosive problems of off-base discrimination. Even if the\r\ncommander could qualify as a civil rights reformer, he had little time\r\nor incentive for a duty that would go unrecognized in terms of his\r\nefficiency rating yet must compete for his attention with other\r\nnecessary duties that were so recognized. Finally, the successful use\r\nof voluntary compliance techniques depended on the implied threat of\r\nlegal or economic pressures, yet, for a considerable period following\r\nMcNamara's 1963 directive, no legal strictures against some forms of\r\ndiscrimination existed, and the use of economic sanctions had been so\r\ncarefully circumscribed by defense officials as to render the\r\npossibility of their use extremely remote.\r\n\r\nThe decision to circumscribe the use of economic sanctions against\r\noff-base discrimination made sense. Closing a base because of\r\ndiscrimination in nearby communities was practically if not\r\npolitically impossible and might conceivably become a threat to\r\nnational security. As to sanctions aimed at specific businesses, the\r\nsecretary's civil rights assistants feared the possibility that the\r\nabrupt or authoritarian imposition of sanctions by an insensitive or\r\nunsympathetic commander might sabotage the department's whole equal\r\nopportunity program in the community. They were determined to leave\r\nthe responsibility for sanctions in the hands of senior civilian\r\nofficials. In the end it was the most senior of these officials who\r\nacted. When his attention turned to the problem of discrimination in\r\noff-base housing for black servicemen in 1967, Secretary McNamara\r\nquickly decided to use sanctions against a discriminatory practice\r\nwidely accepted and still legal under federal law.\r\n\r\nThe combination of voluntary compliance techniques and economic\r\nsanctions, in tandem with the historic civil rights legislation of the\r\nmid-1960's, succeeded in eliminating most of the off-base\r\ndiscrimination faced by black servicemen. Ironically, in view of its\r\nunquestioned control in the area, the Department of Defense failed to\r\nachieve an equal success against discrimination within the military\r\nestablishment itself. Complaints concerning the number, promotion,\r\nassignment, and punishment of black servicemen, a limited problem in\r\nthe mid-1960's, went mostly unrecognized. Relatively speaking, they\r\nwere ignored by the Gesell Committee and the civil rights\r\norganizations in the face of the more pressing off-base problems and\r\nonly summarily treated by the services, which remained largely silent\r\nabout on-base and in-house discrimination. Long after off-base\r\ndiscrimination had disappeared as a specific military problem, this\r\nneglected on-base discrimination would rise up again to trouble the\r\narmed forces in more militant times.[23-101]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 23-101: Interv, author with Bennett, 13 Dec\r\n                   73.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24                                                         (p. 609)\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Defense Department's response to the recommendations of the Gesell\r\nCommittee marked the close of a well-defined chapter in the racial\r\nhistory of the armed forces. Within a single generation, the services\r\nhad recognized the rights of black Americans to serve freely in the\r\ndefense of their country, to be racially integrated, and to have, with\r\ntheir dependents, equal treatment and opportunity not only on the\r\nmilitary reservation but also in nearby communities. The gradual\r\ncompliance with Secretary McNamara's directives in the mid-1960's\r\nmarked the crumbling of the last legal and administrative barriers to\r\nthese goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why the Services Integrated_\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, several causes for the elimination of these barriers\r\ncan be identified. First, if only for the constancy and fervor of its\r\ndemands, was the civil rights movement. An obvious correlation exists\r\nbetween the development of this movement and the shift in the\r\nservices' racial attitudes. The civil rights advocates--that is, those\r\nspokesmen of the rapidly proliferating civil rights organizations and\r\ntheir allies in Congress, the White House, and the media--formed a\r\npressure group that zealously enlisted political support for equal\r\nopportunity measures. Their metier was presidential politics. In\r\nseveral elections they successfully traded their political assistance,\r\nan unknown quantity, for specific reform. Their influence was crucial,\r\nfor example, in Roosevelt's decision to enlist Negroes for general\r\nservice in the World War II Navy and in all branches of the Army and\r\nin Truman's proclamation of equal treatment and opportunity; it was\r\nnotable in the adjudication of countless discrimination cases\r\ninvolving individual black servicemen both on and off the military\r\nbase. Running through all their demands and expressed more and more\r\nclearly during this period was the conviction that segregation itself\r\nwas discrimination. The success of their campaign against segregation\r\nin the armed forces can be measured by the extent to which this\r\nproposition came to be accepted in the counsels of the White House and\r\nthe Pentagon.\r\n\r\nBecause the demands of the civil rights advocates were extremely\r\npersistent and widely heard, their direct influence on the integration\r\nof the services has sometimes been overstressed. In fact, for much of\r\nthe period their most important demands were neutralized by the\r\nlogical-sounding arguments of those defending the racial _status quo_.\r\nMore to the point, the civil rights revolution itself swept along some\r\nimportant defense officials. Thus the reforms begun by James Forrestal\r\nand Robert McNamara testified to the indirect but important influence\r\nof the civil rights movement.\r\n\r\nResisting the pressure for change was a solid bloc of officials    (p. 610)\r\nin the services which held out for the retention of traditional\r\npolicies of racial exclusion or segregation. Professed loyalty to\r\nmilitary tradition was all too often a cloak for prejudice, and\r\nprejudice, of course, was prevalent in all the services just as it was\r\nin American society. At the same time traditionalism simply reflected\r\nthe natural inclination of any large, inbred bureaucracy to preserve\r\nthe privileges and order of an earlier time. Basically, the military\r\ntraditionalists--that is, most senior officials and commanders of the\r\narmed forces and their allies in Congress--took the position that\r\nblack servicemen were difficult to train and undependable in battle.\r\nThey cited the performance of large black combat units during the\r\nworld wars as support for their argument. They also rationalized their\r\nopposition to integration by saying that the armed forces should not\r\nbe an instrument of social change and that the services could only\r\nreflect the social mores of the society from which they sprang. Thus,\r\nin their view, integration not only hindered the services' basic\r\nmission by burdening them with undependable units and marginally\r\ncapable men, but also courted social upheaval in military units.\r\n\r\nEventually reconciled to the integration of military units, many\r\nmilitary officials continued to resist the idea that responsibility\r\nfor equal treatment and opportunity of black servicemen extended\r\nbeyond the gates of the military reservation. Deeply ingrained in the\r\nofficer corps was the conviction that the role of the military was to\r\nserve, not to change, society. To effect social change, the\r\ntraditionalist argued, would require an intrusion into politics that\r\nwas by definition militarism. It was the duty of the Department of\r\nJustice and other civilian agencies, not the armed forces, to secure\r\nthose social changes essential for the protection of the rights of\r\nservicemen in the civilian community.[24-1] If these arguments appear\r\nto have overlooked the real causes of the services' wartime racial\r\nproblems and ignored some of the logical implications of Truman's\r\nequal treatment and opportunity order, they were nevertheless in the\r\nmainstream of American military thought, ardently supported, and\r\nwidely proclaimed.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-1: Speaking at a later date on this\r\n                   subject, former Army Chief of Staff J. Lawton\r\n                   Collins observed that \"when we look about us and\r\n                   see the deleterious effects of military\r\n                   interference in civilian governments throughout ...\r\n                   many other areas of the world, we can be grateful\r\n                   that American military leaders have generally stuck\r\n                   to their proper sphere.\" See Memo, Collins for OSD\r\n                   Historian, 21 Aug 76, copy in CMH.]\r\n\r\nThe story of integration in the armed forces has usually, and with\r\nsome logic, been told in terms of the conflict between the \"good\"\r\ncivil rights advocates and the \"bad\" traditionalists. In fact, the\r\nhistory of integration goes beyond the dimensions of a morality play\r\nand includes a number of other influences both institutional and\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIETNAM PATROL. _Men of the 35th Infantry advance\r\nduring \"Operation Baker.\"_]\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of these institutional factors were federal\r\nlegislation and executive orders. After World War II most Americans\r\nmoved slowly toward acceptance of the proposition that equal treatment\r\nand opportunity for the nation's minorities was both just and\r\nprudent.[24-2] A drawn-out process, this acceptance was in reality a\r\ngrudging concession to the promptings of the civil rights movement;\r\ntranslated into federal legislation, it exerted constant pressure  (p. 612)\r\non the racial policy of the armed forces. The Selective Service Acts\r\nof 1940 and 1948, for example, provided an important reason for\r\nintegrating when, as interpreted by the executive branch, their racial\r\nprovisions required each service to accept a quota of Negroes among\r\nits draftees. The services could evade the provisions of the acts for\r\nonly so long before the influx of black draftees in conjunction with\r\nother pressures led to alterations in the old racial policies.\r\nTruman's order calling for equality of treatment and opportunity in\r\nthe services was also a major factor in the racial changes that took\r\nplace in the Army in the early 1950's. To a great extent the dictates\r\nof the civil rights laws of 1964 and 1965 exerted similar pressure on\r\nthe services and account for the success of the Defense Department's\r\ncomprehensive response during the mid-1960's to the discrimination\r\nfaced by servicemen in the local community.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-2: For an extended discussion of the\r\n                   moral basis of racial reform, see O'Connor's\r\n                   interview with Hesburgh, 27 Mar 66.]\r\n\r\nQuestions concerning the effect of law on social custom, and\r\nparticularly the issue of whether government should force social\r\nchange or await the popular will, are of continuing interest to the\r\nsociologist and the political scientist. In the case of the armed\r\nforces, a sector of society that habitually recognizes the primacy of\r\nauthority and law, the answer was clear. Ordered to integrate, the\r\nmembers of both races adjusted, though sometimes reluctantly, to a new\r\nsocial relationship. The traditionalists' genuine fear that racial\r\nunrest would follow racial mixing proved unfounded. The performance of\r\nindividual Negroes in the integrated units demonstrated that changed\r\nsocial relationships could also produce rapid improvement in\r\nindividual and group achievement and thus increase military\r\nefficiency. Furthermore, the successful integration of military units\r\nin the 1950's so raised expectations in the black community that the\r\ncivil rights leaders would use that success to support their\r\nsuccessful campaign in the 1960's to convince the government that it\r\nmust impose social change on the community at large.[24-3]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-3: For an extended discussion of the law\r\n                   and racial change, see Greenberg, _Race Relations\r\n                   and American Law_; Charles C. Moskos, Jr., \"Racial\r\n                   Integration in the Armed Forces,\" _American Journal\r\n                   of Sociology_ 72 (September 1966): 132-48;\r\n                   Ginzberg, _The Negro Potential_, pp. 127-31.]\r\n\r\nParalleling the influence of the law, the quest for military\r\nefficiency was another institutional factor that affected the\r\nservices' racial policies. The need for military efficiency had always\r\nbeen used by the services to rationalize racial exclusion and\r\nsegregation; later it became the primary consideration in the decision\r\nof each service to integrate its units. Reinforcing the efficiency\r\nargument was the realization by the military that manpower could no\r\nlonger be considered an inexhaustible resource. World War II had\r\ndemonstrated that the federal government dare not ignore the military\r\nand industrial potential of any segment of its population. The reality\r\nof the limited national manpower pool explained the services'\r\nguarantee that Negroes would be included in the postwar period as\r\ncadres for the full wartime mobilization of black manpower. Timing was\r\nsomewhat dependent on the size and mission of the individual service;\r\nintegration came to each when it became obvious that black manpower\r\ncould not be used efficiently in separate organizations. In the case\r\nof the largest service, the Army, the Fahy Committee used the      (p. 613)\r\nfailure to train and use eligible Negroes in unfilled jobs to convince\r\nsenior officials that military efficiency demanded the progressive\r\nintegration of its black soldiers, beginning with those men eligible\r\nfor specialist duties. The final demonstration of the connection\r\nbetween efficiency and integration came from those harried commanders\r\nwho, trying against overwhelming odds to fight a war in Korea with\r\nsegregated units, finally began integrating their forces. They found\r\nthat their black soldiers fought better in integrated units.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARINE ENGINEERS IN VIETNAM. _Men of the 11th Engineer\r\nBattalion move culverts into place in a mountain stream during\r\n\"Operation Pegasus.\"_]\r\n\r\nLater, military efficiency would be the rationale for the Defense\r\nDepartment's fight against discrimination in the local community. The\r\nGesell Committee was used by Adam Yarmolinsky and others to\r\ndemonstrate to Secretary McNamara if not to the satisfaction of\r\nskeptical military traditionalists and congressional critics that the\r\nneed to solve a severe morale problem justified the department's\r\nintrusion. Appeals to military efficiency, therefore, became the\r\nultimate justification for integrating the units of the armed forces\r\nand providing for equal treatment of its members in the community.\r\n\r\nBeyond the demands of the law and military efficiency, the integration\r\nof the armed forces was also influenced by certain individuals within\r\nthe military establishment who personified America's awakening\r\nsocial conscience. They led the services along the road toward     (p. 614)\r\nintegration not because the law demanded it, nor because activists\r\nclamored for it, nor even because military efficiency required it, but\r\nbecause they believed it was right. Complementing the work of these\r\nmen and women was the opinion of the American serviceman himself.\r\nBetween 1940 and 1965 his attitude toward change was constantly\r\ndiscussed and predicted but only rarely solicited by senior officials.\r\nActually his opinion at that time is still largely unknown;\r\ndocumentary evidence is scarce, and his recollections, influenced as\r\nthey are by the intervening years of the civil rights movement, are\r\nunreliable. Yet it was clearly the serviceman's generally quiet\r\nacceptance of new social practices, particularly those of the early\r\n1950's, that ratified the services' racial reforms. As a perceptive\r\ncritic of the nation's racial history described conditions in the\r\nservices in 1962:\r\n\r\n     There was a rising tide of tolerance around the nation at that\r\n     time. I was thrilled to see it working in the services. Whether\r\n     officers were working for it or not it existed. From time to time\r\n     you would find an officer imbued with the desire to improve race\r\n     relations.... It was a marvel to me, in contrast to my recent\r\n     investigations in the South, to see how well integration worked\r\n     in the services.[24-4]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-4: Interv, author with Muse, 2 Mar 73.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, it could be argued, American servicemen of the 1950's became a\r\npositive if indirect cause of racial change. By demonstrating that\r\nlarge numbers of blacks and whites could work and live together, they\r\ndestroyed a fundamental argument of the opponents of integration and\r\nmade further reforms possible if not imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How the Services Integrated, 1946-1954_\r\n\r\nThe interaction of all these factors can be seen when equal treatment\r\nand opportunity in the armed forces is considered in two distinct\r\nphases, the first culminating in the integration of all active\r\nmilitary units in 1954, the second centering around the decision in\r\n1963 to push for equal opportunity for black servicemen outside the\r\ngates of the military base.[24-5]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-5: Portions of the following discussion\r\n                   have been published in somewhat different form\r\n                   under the title \"Armed Forces Integration--Forced\r\n                   or Free?\" in _The Military and Society, Proceedings\r\n                   of the Fifth Military Symposium_ (U.S. Air Force\r\n                   Academy, 1972).]\r\n\r\nThe Navy was the acknowledged pioneer in integration. Its decision\r\nduring World War II to assign black and white sailors to certain ships\r\nwas not entirely a response to pressures from civil rights advocates,\r\nalthough Secretary James Forrestal relied on his friends in the Urban\r\nLeague, particularly Lester Granger, to teach him the techniques of\r\nintegrating a large organization. Nor was the decision solely the work\r\nof racial reformers in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, although this\r\nsmall group was undoubtedly responsible for drafting the regulations\r\nthat governed the changes in the wartime Navy. Rather, the Navy began\r\nintegrating its general service because segregation proved painfully\r\ninefficient. The decision was largely the result of the impersonal\r\noperation of the 1940 draft law. Although imperfectly applied during\r\nthe war, the anti-discrimination provision of that law produced a\r\nmassive infusion of black inductees. The Army, with its larger     (p. 615)\r\nmanpower base and expandable black units, could evade the implications\r\nof a nondiscrimination clause, but the sheer presence of large numbers\r\nof Negroes in the service, more than any other force, breached the\r\nwalls of segregation in the Navy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOADING A ROCKET LAUNCHER. _Crewmen of the USS\r\nCarronade participating in a coordinated gunfire support action near\r\nChu Lai, Vietnam._]\r\n\r\nThe Navy experiment with an all-black crew had proved unsatisfactory,\r\nand only so many shore-based jobs were considered suitable for large\r\nsegregated units. Bowing to the argument that two navies--one black,\r\none white--were both inefficient and expensive, Secretary Forrestal\r\nbegan to experiment with integration during the last months of the war\r\nand finally announced a policy of integration in February 1946. The\r\nfull application of this new policy would wait for some years while\r\nthe Navy's traditional racial attitudes warred with its practical\r\ndesire for efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force was the next to end segregation. Again, immediate\r\noutside influences appeared to be slight. Despite the timing of the\r\nAir Force integration directive in early 1949 and Secretary Stuart\r\nSymington's discussions of the subject with Truman and the Fahy\r\nCommittee, plans to drop many racial barriers in the Air Force had\r\nalready been formulated at the time of the President's equal\r\nopportunity order in 1948. Nor is there any evidence of special\r\nconcern among Air Force officials about the growing criticism of their\r\nsegregation policy. The record clearly reveals, however, that by late\r\n1947 the Air staff had become anxious over the manpower requirements\r\nof the Gillem Board Report, which enunciated the postwar racial policy\r\nthat the Air Force shared with the Army.\r\n\r\nThe Gillem Board Report would hardly be classified as progressive by\r\nlater standards; its provisions for reducing the size of black units\r\nand integrating a small number of black specialists were, in a way, an\r\neffort to make segregation less wasteful. Nevertheless, with all its\r\nshortcomings, this postwar policy contained the germ of integration.\r\nIt committed the Army and Air Force to total integration as a\r\nlong-range objective, and, more important, it made permanent the\r\nwartime policy of allotting 10 percent of the Army's strength to\r\nNegroes. Later branded by the civil rights spokesmen as an instrument\r\nfor limiting black enlistment, the racial quota committed the Army and\r\nits offspring, the Air Force, not only to maintaining at least 10\r\npercent black strength but also to assigning black servicemen to all\r\nbranches and all job categories, thereby significantly weakening   (p. 616)\r\nthe segregated system. Although never filled in either service, the\r\nquotas guaranteed that a large number of Negroes would remain in\r\nuniform after the war and thus gave both services an incentive to\r\ndesegregate.\r\n\r\nOnce again the Army could postpone the logical consequences of its\r\nracial policy by the continued proliferation of its segregated combat\r\nand service units. But the new Air Force almost immediately felt the\r\nfull force of the Gillem Board policy, quickly learning that it could\r\nnot maintain 10 percent black strength separate but equal. It too\r\nmight have continued indefinitely enlarging the number of service\r\nunits in order to absorb black airmen. Like the Army, it might even\r\nhave ignored the injunction to assign a quota of blacks to every\r\nmilitary occupation and to every school. But it was politically\r\nimpossible for the Air Force to do away with its black flying units,\r\nand it became economically impossible in a time of shrinking budgets\r\nand manpower cuts to operate separate flying units for the small group\r\nof Negroes involved. It was also unfeasible, considering the small\r\nnumber of black rated officers and men, to fill all the positions in\r\nthe black air units and provide at the same time for the normal\r\nrotation and advanced training schedules. Facing these difficulties\r\nand mindful of the Navy's experience with integration, the Air Force\r\nbegan serious discussion of the integration of its black pilots and\r\ncrews in 1947, some months before Truman issued his order.\r\n\r\nCommitted to integrating its air units and rated men in 1949, the Air\r\nstaff quietly enlarged its objectives and broke up all its black\r\nunits, thereby making the Air Force the first service to achieve total\r\nintegration. There were several reasons for this rapid escalation in\r\nwhat was to have been a limited program. As devised by General Edwards\r\nand Colonel Marr of the Air staff the plan demanded that all black\r\nairmen in each command be conscientiously examined so that all might\r\nbe properly reassigned, further trained, retained in segregated units,\r\nor dismissed. The removal of increasing numbers of eligible men from\r\nblack units only hastened the end of those organizations, a tendency\r\nratified by the trouble-free acceptance of the program by all\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe integration of the Army was more protracted. The Truman order in\r\n1948 and the Fahy Committee, the White House group appointed to\r\noversee the execution of that order, focused primarily on the\r\nsegregated Army. There is little doubt that the President's action had\r\na political dimension. Given the fact that the Army had become a major\r\ntarget of the President's own Civil Rights Commission and that it was\r\na highly visible practitioner of segregation, the equal opportunity\r\norder would almost have had to be part of the President's plan to\r\nunite the nation's minorities behind his 1948 candidacy. The order was\r\nalso a logical response to the threat of civil disobedience issued by\r\nA. Philip Randolph and endorsed by other civil rights advocates. In a\r\nmatter of weeks after Truman issued his integration order, Randolph\r\ndropped his opposition to the 1948 draft law and his call for a\r\nboycott of the draft by Negroes.\r\n\r\nIt remained for the Fahy Committee to translate the President's order\r\ninto a working program leading toward integration of the Army. Like\r\nRandolph and other activists, the committee quickly concluded that\r\nsegregation was a denial of equal treatment and opportunity and that\r\nthe executive order, therefore, was essentially a call for the     (p. 617)\r\nservices to integrate. After lengthy negotiations, the committee\r\nwon from the Army an agreement to move progressively toward full\r\nintegration. Gradual integration was disregarded, however, when the\r\nArmy, fighting in Korea, was forced by a direct threat to the\r\nefficiency of its operations to begin wide-scale mixing of the races.\r\nSpecifically, the proximate reason for the Army's integration in the\r\nFar East was the fact that General Ridgway faced a severe shortage of\r\nreplacements for his depleted white units while accumulating a surplus\r\nof black replacements. So pressing was his need that even before\r\npermission was received from Washington integration had already begun\r\non the battlefield. The reason for the rapid integration of the rest\r\nof the Army was more complicated. The example of Korea was persuasive,\r\nas was the need for a uniform policy, but beyond that the rapid\r\nmodernization of the Army was making obsolete the large-scale labor\r\nunits traditionally used by the Army to absorb much of its black\r\nquota. With these units disappearing, the Army had to find new jobs\r\nfor the men, a task hopelessly complicated by segregation.\r\n\r\nThe postwar racial policy of the Marine Corps struck a curious\r\ncompromise between that of the Army and of the Navy. Adopting the\r\nformer's system of segregated units and the latter's rejection of the\r\n10 percent racial quota, the corps was able to assign its small\r\ncontingent of black marines to a few segregated noncombatant duties.\r\nBut the policy of the corps was only practicable for its peacetime\r\nsize, as its mobilization for Korea demonstrated. Even before the Army\r\nwas forced to change, the Marine Corps, its manpower planners pressed\r\nto find trained men and units to fill its divisional commitment to\r\nKorea, quietly abandoned the rules on segregated service.\r\n\r\nWhile progressives cited the military efficiency of integration,\r\ntraditionalists used the efficiency argument to defend the racial\r\n_status quo_. In general, senior military officials had concluded on\r\nthe basis of their World War II experience that large black units were\r\nineffective, undependable in close combat, and best suited for supply\r\nassignments. Whatever their motives, the traditionalists had reached\r\nthe wrong conclusion from their data. They were correct when they\r\ncharged that, despite competent and even heroic performance on the\r\npart of some individuals and units, the large black combat units had,\r\non average, performed poorly during the war. But the traditionalists\r\nfailed, as they had failed after World War I, to see the reasons for\r\nthis poor performance. Not the least of these were the benumbing\r\ndiscrimination suffered by black servicemen during training, the\r\nhumiliations involved in their assignments, and the ineptitude of many\r\nof their leaders, who were most often white.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the postwar manpower planners drew the wrong conclusion\r\nfrom the fact that the average General Classification Test scores of\r\nmen in World War II black units fell significantly below that of their\r\nwhite counterparts. The scores were directly related to the two\r\ngroups' relative educational advantages which depended to a large\r\nextent on their economic status and the geographic region from which\r\nthey came. This mental average of servicemen was a unit problem, for\r\nat all times the total number of white individuals who scored in\r\nlow-aptitude categories IV and V greatly outnumbered black individuals\r\nin those categories. This greater number of less gifted white      (p. 618)\r\nservicemen had been spread thinly throughout the services' thousands\r\nof white units where they caused no particular problem. The lesser\r\nnumber of Negroes with low aptitude, however, were concentrated in the\r\nrelatively few black units, creating a serious handicap to efficient\r\nperformance. Conversely, the contribution of talented black servicemen\r\nwas largely negated by their frequent assignment to units with too\r\nmany low-scoring men. Small units composed in the main of black\r\nspecialists, such as the black artillery and armor units that served\r\nin the European theater during World War II, served with distinction,\r\nbut these units were special cases where the effect of segregation was\r\ntempered by the special qualifications of the carefully chosen men.\r\nSegregation and not mental aptitude was the key to the poor\r\nperformance of the large black units in World War II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN SAILORS _help evacuate Vietnamese child_.]\r\n\r\nPostwar service policies ignored these facts and defended segregation\r\nin the name of military efficiency. In short, the armed forces had to\r\nmake inefficiency seem efficient as they explained in paternalistic\r\nfashion that segregation was best for all concerned. \"In general, the\r\nNegro is less well educated than his brother citizen that is white,\"\r\nGeneral Eisenhower told the Senate Armed Forces Committee in 1948,\r\n\"and if you make a complete amalgamation, what you are going to have\r\nis in every company the Negro is going to be relegated to the minor\r\njobs ... because the competition is too rough.\"[24-6]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-6: Quoted in Senate, Hearings Before the\r\n                   U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, _Universal\r\n                   Military Training_, 80th Cong., 2d sess., 1948, pp.\r\n                   995-96.]\r\n\r\nCompetence in a great many skills became increasingly important for\r\nservicemen in the postwar period as the trend toward technical\r\ncomplexity and specialization continued in all the services.\r\nDifferences in recruiting gave some services an advantage. The Navy\r\nand Air Force, setting stricter standards of enlistment, could fill\r\ntheir ranks with high-scoring volunteers and avoid enlisting large\r\ngroups of low-scoring men, often black, who were eventually drafted\r\nfor the Army. While this situation helped reduce the traditional\r\nopposition to integration in the Navy and Air Force, it made the Army\r\nmore determined to retain separate black units to absorb the large\r\nnumber of low-scoring draftees it was obligated to take. A major\r\nfactor in the eventual integration of the Army--and the single most\r\nsignificant contribution of the Secretary of Defense to that       (p. 619)\r\nend--was George Marshall's decision to establish a parity of\r\nenlistment standards for the services. On the advice of his manpower\r\nassistant, Anna Rosenberg, Marshall abolished the special advantage\r\nenjoyed by the Navy and Air Force, making all the services share in\r\nthe recruitment of low-scoring men. The common standard undercut the\r\nArmy's most persuasive argument for restoring a racial quota and\r\nmaintaining segregated units.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOBY TRAP VICTIM _from Company B, 47th Infantry,\r\nresting on buddy's back, awaits evacuation_.]\r\n\r\nIn the years from 1946 to 1954, then, several forces converged to\r\nbring about integration of the regular armed forces. Pressure from the\r\ncivil rights advocates was one, idealistic leadership another. Most\r\nimportant, however, was the services' realization that segregation was\r\nan inefficient way to use the manpower provided by a democratic draft\r\nlaw or a volunteer system made democratic by the Secretary of Defense.\r\nEach service reached its conclusion separately, since each had a\r\ndifferent problem in the efficient use of manpower and each had its\r\nown racial traditions. Accordingly, the services saw little need to\r\nexchange views, develop rivalries, or imitate one another's racial\r\npolicies. There were two exceptions to this situation: both the Army\r\nand Air Force naturally considered the Navy's integration experience\r\nwhen they were formulating postwar policies, and the Navy and Air\r\nForce fought the Army's proposals to experiment with integrated units\r\nand institute a parity of enlistment standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Equal Treatment and Opportunity_\r\n\r\nSegregation officially ended in the active armed forces with the\r\nannouncement of the Secretary of Defense in 1954 that the last\r\nall-black unit had been disbanded. In the little more than six years\r\nafter President Truman's order, some quarter of a million blacks had\r\nbeen intermingled with whites in the nation's military units\r\nworldwide. These changes ushered in a brief era of good feeling during\r\nwhich the services and the civil rights advocates tended to overlook\r\nsome forms of discrimination that persisted within the services. This\r\ntendency became even stronger in the early 1960's when the\r\ndiscrimination suffered by black servicemen in local communities\r\ndramatized the relative effectiveness of the equal treatment and\r\nopportunity policies on military installations. In July 1963, in the\r\nwake of another presidential investigation of racial equality      (p. 620)\r\nin the armed forces, Secretary of Defense McNamara outlined a new\r\nracial policy. An extension of the forces that had produced the\r\nabolition of segregated military units, the new policy also vowed to\r\ncarry the crusade for equal treatment and opportunity for black\r\nservicemen outside the military compound into the civilian community\r\nbeyond. McNamara's 1963 directive became the model for subsequent\r\nracial orders in the Defense Department.\r\n\r\nThis enlargement of the department's concept of equal treatment and\r\nopportunity paralleled the rise of the modern civil rights movement,\r\nwhich was reaching its apogee in the mid-1960's. McNamara later\r\nacknowledged the influence of the civil rights activists on his\r\ndepartment during this period. But the department's racial progress\r\ncannot be explained solely as a reaction to the pressures exerted by\r\nthe civil rights movement. Several other factors lay behind the new\r\nand broader policy. The Defense Department was, for instance, under\r\nconstant pressure from black officers and men who were not only\r\nreporting inequities in the newly integrated services and complaining\r\nof the remaining racial discrimination within the military community\r\nbut were also demanding the department's assistance in securing their\r\nconstitutional rights from the communities outside the military bases.\r\nThis was particularly true in the fields of public education, housing,\r\nand places of entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe services as well as the Defense Department's manpower officials\r\nresisted these demands and continued in the early 1960's to limit\r\ntheir racial reforms to those necessary but exclusively internal\r\nmatters most obviously connected with the efficient operation of their\r\nunits. Reinforcing this resistance was the reluctance on the part of\r\nmost commanders to break with tradition and interfere in what they\r\nconsidered community affairs. Nor had McNamara's early policy\r\nstatements in response to servicemen's demands come to grips with the\r\nissue of discrimination in the civilian community. At the same time,\r\nsome reformers in the Defense Department had allied themselves with\r\nlike-minded progressives throughout the administration and were\r\nsearching for a way to carry out President Kennedy's commitment to\r\ncivil rights. These individuals were determined to use the services'\r\nearly integration successes as a stepping-stone to further civil\r\nrights reforms while the administration's civil rights program\r\nremained bogged down in Congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough these reformers believed that the armed forces could be an\r\neffective instrument of social change for society at large, they\r\nclothed their aims in the garb of military efficiency. In fact,\r\nmilitary efficiency was certainly McNamara's paramount concern when he\r\nsupported the idea of enlarging the scope of his department's racial\r\nprograms and when in 1962 he readily accepted the proposal to appoint\r\nthe Gesell Committee to study the services' racial program.\r\n\r\nThe Gesell Committee easily documented the connection, long suspected\r\nby the reformers, between discrimination in the community and poor\r\nmorale among black servicemen and the link between morale and combat\r\nefficiency. More important, with its ability to publicize the extent\r\nof discrimination against black servicemen in local communities and to\r\noffer practical recommendations for reform, the committee was able (p. 621)\r\nto stimulate the secretary into action. Yet not until his last years\r\nin office, beginning with his open housing campaign in 1967, did\r\nMcNamara, who had always championed the stand of Adam Yarmolinsky and\r\nthe rest, become a strong participant.\r\n\r\nMcNamara promptly endorsed the Gesell Committee's report, which called\r\nfor a vigorous program to provide equal opportunity for black\r\nservicemen, ordering the services to launch such a program in\r\ncommunities near military bases and making the local commander\r\nprimarily responsible for its success. He soft-pedaled the committee's\r\ncontroversial provision for the use of economic sanctions against\r\nrecalcitrant businessmen, stressing instead the duty of commanders to\r\npress for changes through voluntary compliance. These efforts,\r\naccording to Defense Department reports, achieved gratifying results\r\nin the next few years. In conjunction with other federal officials\r\noperating under provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, local\r\ncommanders helped open thousands of theaters, bowling alleys,\r\nrestaurants, and bathing beaches to black servicemen. Only in the face\r\nof continued opposition to open housing by landlords who dealt with\r\nservicemen, and then not until 1967, did McNamara decide to use the\r\npowerful and controversial weapon of off-limits sanctions. In short\r\norder his programs helped destroy the patterns of segregation in\r\nmultiple housing in areas surrounding most military bases.\r\n\r\nThe federal government's commitment to civil rights, manifest in\r\nSupreme Court decisions, executive orders, and congressional actions,\r\nwas an important support for the Defense Department's racial program\r\nduring this second part of the integration era. It is doubtful whether\r\nmany of the command initiatives recommended by the Gesell Committee\r\nwould have succeeded or even been tried without the court's 1954\r\nschool ruling and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yet in several\r\nimportant instances, such as the McNamara 1963 equal opportunity\r\ndirective and the open housing campaign in 1967, the department's\r\nactions antedated federal action. Originally a follower of civilian\r\nsociety in racial matters, the armed forces moved ahead in the 1950's\r\nand by the mid-1960's had become a powerful stimulus for change in\r\ncivilian practices in some areas of the country.[24-7]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-7: For a discussion of this point, see\r\n                   Yarmolinsky's _The Military Establishment_, pp.\r\n                   346-51.]\r\n\r\nAchievements of the services should not detract from the primacy of\r\ncivil rights legislation in the reforms of the 1960's. The sudden fall\r\nof barriers to black Americans was primarily the result of the Civil\r\nRights Acts. But the fact and example of integration in the armed\r\nforces was an important cause of change in the communities near\r\nmilitary bases. Defense officials, prodding in the matter of\r\nintegrated schooling for dependent children, found the mere existence\r\nof successfully integrated on-base schooling a useful tool in\r\nachieving similar schooling off-base. The experience of having served\r\nin the integrated armed forces, shared by so many young Americans,\r\nalso exercised an immeasurable influence on the changes of the 1960's.\r\nGesell Committee member Benjamin Muse recalled hearing a Mississippi\r\nhitchhiker say in 1961 at the height of the anti-integration, anti-Negro\r\nfever in that area: \"I don't hold with this stuff about 'niggers'. (p. 622)\r\nI had a colored buddy in Korea, and I want to tell you he was all\r\nright.\"[24-8]\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-8: Quoted in Ltr, Muse to Chief of\r\n                   Military History, 2 Aug 76, in CMH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMARADERIE. _A soldier of Company C, 7th Infantry,\r\nlights a cigarette for a marine from D Company, 26th Marines, during\r\n\"Operation Pegasus\" near Khe Sanh._]\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, the attention paid by defense officials and the\r\nservices to off-base discrimination in the 1960's may have been\r\nmisdirected; many of these injustices would eventually have succumbed\r\nto civil rights legislation. Certainly more attention could have been\r\npaid to the unfinished business of providing equal treatment and\r\nopportunity for black servicemen within the military community.\r\nDiscrimination in matters of promotion, assignment, and military\r\njustice, overlooked by almost everyone in the early 1960's, was never\r\ntreated with the urgency it deserved. To have done so might have\r\naverted at least some of the racial turmoil visited on the services in\r\nthe Vietnam era.\r\n\r\nBut these shortcomings merely point to the fact that the services were\r\nthe only segment of American society to have integrated, however\r\nimperfectly, the races on so large a scale. In doing so they\r\ndemonstrated that a policy of equal treatment and opportunity is more\r\nthan a legal concept; it also ordains a social condition. Between  (p. 623)\r\nthe enunciation of such a policy and the achievement of its goals can\r\nfall the shadow of bigotry and the traditional way of doing things.\r\nThe record indicates that the services surmounted bigotry and rejected\r\nthe old ways to a gratifying degree. To the extent that they were\r\nsuccessful in bringing the races together, their efficiency prospered\r\nand the nation's ideal of equal opportunity for all citizens was\r\nfortified.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the collapse of the legal and administrative barriers\r\nto equal treatment and opportunity in the armed forces did not lead\r\nimmediately to the full realization of this ideal. Equal treatment and\r\nopportunity would remain an elusive goal for the Department of Defense\r\nfor years to come. The post-1965 period comprises a new chapter in the\r\nracial history of the services. The agitation that followed the\r\nMcNamara era had different roots from the events of the previous\r\ndecades. The key to this difference was suggested during the Vietnam\r\nWar by the Kerner Commission in its stark conclusion that \"our nation\r\nis moving toward two societies, one black, one white--separate but\r\nunequal.\"[24-9] In contrast to the McNamara period of integration,\r\nwhen civil rights advocates and Defense Department officials worked\r\ntoward a common goal, subsequent years would be marked by an often\r\ngreater militancy on the part of black servicemen and a new kind of\r\nfriction between a fragmented civil rights movement and the Department\r\nof Defense. Clearly, in coping with these problems the services will\r\nhave to move beyond the elimination of legal and administrative\r\nbarriers that had ordered their racial concerns between 1940 and 1965.\r\n\r\n                   [Footnote 24-9: _Report of the National Advisory\r\n                   Commission on Civil Disorders_, p. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on Sources                                                    (p. 625)\r\n\r\nThe search for source materials used in this volume provided the\r\nwriter with a special glimpse into the ways in which various\r\ngovernment agencies have treated what was until recently considered a\r\nsensitive subject. Most important documents and working papers\r\nconcerning the employment of black servicemen were, well into the\r\n1950's and in contrast to the great bulk of personnel policy papers,\r\nroutinely given a security classification. In some agencies the\r\n\"secret\" or \"confidential\" stamp was considered sufficient to protect\r\nthe materials, which were filed and retired in a routine manner and,\r\ntherefore, have always been readily available to the persistent and\r\nqualified researcher. But, as any experienced staff officer could\r\ndemonstrate, other methods beyond mere classification can be devised\r\nto prevent easy access to sensitive material.\r\n\r\nThus, subterfuges were employed from time to time by officials dealing\r\nwith racial subjects. In some staff agencies, for example, documents\r\nwere collected in special files, separated from the normal personnel\r\nor policy files. In other instances the materials were never retired\r\nin a routine matter, but instead remained for many years scattered in\r\noffices of origin or, less often, in some central file system. If some\r\nofficials appear to have been overly anxious to shield their agency's\r\nrecord, they also, it should be added, possessed a sense of history\r\nand the historical import of their work. Though the temptation may\r\nhave been strong within some agencies to destroy papers connected with\r\npast controversies, most officials scrupulously preserved not only the\r\nbasic policy documents concerning this specialized subject, but also\r\nmuch of the back-up material that the historian treasures.\r\n\r\nThe problem for the modern researcher is that these special\r\ncollections and reserved materials, no longer classified and no longer\r\nsensitive, have fallen, largely unnoted, into a sea of governmental\r\npaper beyond the reach of the archivist's finding aids. The frequently\r\nexpressed comment of the researcher, \"somebody is withholding\r\nsomething,\" should, for the sake of accuracy, be changed to \"somebody\r\nhas lost track of something.\"\r\n\r\nThis material might never have been recovered without the skilled\r\nassistance of the historical offices of the various services and\r\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense. At times their search for lost\r\ndocuments assumed the dimensions of a detective story. In partnership\r\nwith Marine Corps historian Ralph Donnelly, for example, the author\r\nfinally traced the bulk of the World War II racial records of the\r\nMarine Corps to an obscure and unmarked file in the classified records\r\nsection of Marine Corps headquarters. A comprehensive collection of\r\nofficial documents on the employment of black personnel in the Navy\r\nbetween 1920 and 1946 was unearthed, not in the official archives, but\r\nin a dusty file cabinet in the Bureau of Naval Personnel's Management\r\nInformation Division.\r\n\r\nThe search also had its frustrations, for some materials seem      (p. 626)\r\npermanently lost. Despite persistent and imaginative work by the Coast\r\nGuard's historian, Truman Strobridge, much of the documentary record\r\nof that service's World War II racial history could not be located.\r\nThe development of the Coast Guard's policy has had to be reconstructed,\r\npainstakingly and laboriously, from other sources. The records of many\r\nArmy staff agencies for the period 1940-43 were destroyed on the\r\nassumption that their materials were duplicated in The Adjutant\r\nGeneral's files, an assumption that frequently proved to be incorrect.\r\nAlthough generally intact, the Navy's records of the immediate\r\npost-World War II period also lack some of the background staff work\r\non the employment of black manpower. Fortunately for this writer, the\r\nrecent, inadvertent destruction of the bulk of the Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel's classified wartime records occurred after the basic\r\nresearch for this volume had been completed, but this lamentable\r\naccident will no doubt cause problems for future researchers.\r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of the services' historical offices and the\r\nwonder of photocopying, future historians may be spared some of the\r\nlabor connected with the preparation of this volume. Most of the\r\nrecords surviving outside regular archives have been identified and\r\nrelocated for easy access. Copies of approximately 65 percent of all\r\ndocuments cited in this volume have been collected and are presently\r\non file in the Center of Military History, from which they will be\r\nretired for permanent preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Official Archival Material_\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the official records used in the preparation of this\r\nvolume is in the permanent custody of the National Archives and\r\nRecords Service, Washington, D.C. The records of most military\r\nagencies for the period 1940-54 are located in the Modern Military\r\nRecords Branch or in the Navy and Old Army Branch of the National\r\nArchives proper. Most documents dated after 1954, along with military\r\nunit records (including ships' logs), are located in the General\r\nArchives Division in the Washington National Records Center, Suitland,\r\nMaryland. The Suitland center also holds the other major group of\r\nofficial materials, that is, all those documents still administered by\r\nthe individual agencies but stored in the center prior to their\r\nscreening and acquisition by the National Archives. These records are\r\nopen to qualified researchers, but access to them is controlled by the\r\nrecords managers of the individual agencies, a not altogether\r\nfelicitous arrangement for the researcher, considering the bulk of the\r\nmaterial and its lack of organization.\r\n\r\nThe largest single group of materials consulted were those of the\r\nvarious offices of the Army staff. Although these agencies have\r\nabandoned the system of classifying all documents by a decimal-subject\r\nsystem, the system persisted in many offices well into the 1960's,\r\nthereby enabling the researcher to accomplish a speedy, if unrefined,\r\nscreening of pertinent materials. Even with this crutch, the\r\nresearcher must still comb through thousands of documents created by\r\nthe Secretary of War (later Secretary of the Army), his assistant\r\nsecretary, the Chief of Staff, and the various staff divisions,    (p. 627)\r\nespecially the Personnel (G-1), Organization and Training (G-3), and\r\nOperations Divisions, together with the offices of The Adjutant\r\nGeneral, the Judge Advocate General, and the Inspector General. The\r\nWar Department Special Planning Division's files are an extremely\r\nimportant source, especially for postwar racial planning, as are the\r\nrecords of the three World War II major commands, the Army Ground,\r\nService, and Air Forces. Although illuminating in regard to the\r\nproblem of racial discrimination, the records of the office of the\r\nsecretary's civilian aide are less important in terms of policy\r\ndevelopment. Finally, the records of the black units, especially the\r\nimportant body of documents related to the tribulations of the 92d\r\nInfantry Division in World War II and the 24th Infantry Regiment in\r\nKorea, are also vital sources for this subject.\r\n\r\nThe records managers in the Office of the Secretary of Defense also\r\nused the familiar 291.2 classification to designate materials related\r\nto the subject of Negroes. (An exception to this generalization were\r\nthe official papers of the secretary's office during the Forrestal\r\nperiod when a Navy file system was generally employed.) The most\r\nimportant materials on the subject of the Defense Department's racial\r\ninterests are found in the records of the Office of the Secretary of\r\nDefense. The majority of these records, including the voluminous files\r\nof the Assistant Secretary (Manpower) so helpful for the later\r\nsections of the study, have remained in the custody of the department\r\nand are administered by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary\r\nof Defense (Administration). After 1963 the Office of the Deputy\r\nAssistant Secretary (Civil Rights) and its successor organizations\r\nloom as a major source. Many of the official papers were eventually\r\nfiled with those of the Assistant Secretary (Manpower) or have been\r\nretained in the historical files of the Equal Opportunity Office of\r\nthe Secretary of Defense. The records of the Personnel Policy Board\r\nand the Office of the General Counsel, both part of the files of the\r\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, are two more important sources of\r\nmaterials on black manpower.\r\n\r\nA subject classification system was not universally applied in the\r\nNavy Department during the 1940's and even where used proved\r\nexceedingly complicated. The records of the Office of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy are especially strong in the World War II period, but they\r\nmust be supplemented with the National Archives' separate Forrestal\r\npapers file. Despite the recent loss of records, the files of the\r\nBureau of Naval Personnel remain the primary source for documents on\r\nthe employment of black personnel in the Navy. Research in all these\r\nfiles, even for the World War II period, is best begun in the Records\r\nManagement offices of those two agencies. More readily accessible, the\r\nrecords of the Chief of Naval Operations and the General Board, both\r\nof considerable importance in understanding the Navy's World War II\r\nracial history, are located in the Operational Archives Branch, Naval\r\nHistorical Division, Washington Navy Yard. This office has recently\r\ncreated a special miscellaneous file containing important documents of\r\ninterest to the researcher on racial matters that have been gleaned\r\nfrom various sources not easily available to the researcher.\r\n\r\nCopies of all known staff papers concerning black marines and the  (p. 628)\r\ndevelopment of the Marine Corps' equal opportunity program during\r\nthe integration period have been collected and filed in the reference\r\nsection of the Director of Marine Corps History and Museums,\r\nHeadquarters, U.S. Marine Corps. Likewise, most of the very small\r\nselection of extant official Coast Guard records on the employment of\r\nNegroes have been identified and collected by the Coast Guard\r\nhistorian. The log of the _Sea Cloud_, the first Coast Guard vessel in\r\nmodern times to boast a racially mixed crew, is located in the\r\nArchives Branch at Suitland.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force has retained control of a significant portion of its\r\npostwar personnel records, and the researcher would best begin work in\r\nthe Office of the Administrative Assistant, Secretary of the Air\r\nForce. This office has custody of the files of the Secretary of the\r\nAir Force, his assistant secretaries, the Office of the Chief of\r\nStaff, and the staff agencies pertinent to this story, especially the\r\nDeputy Chief of Staff, Personnel, and the Director of Military\r\nPersonnel. The records of black air units, as well as the extensive\r\nand well-indexed collection of official unit and base histories and\r\nstudies and reports of the Air staff that touch on the service's\r\nracial policies, are located in the Albert F. Simpson Historical\r\nResearch Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. These records are supplemented,\r\nand sometimes duplicated, by the holdings of the Suitland Records\r\nCenter and the Office of Air Force History, Boiling Air Force Base,\r\nWashington, D.C. Other Air Force files of interest, particularly in\r\nthe area of policy planning, can be found in the holdings of the\r\nNational Archives' Modern Military Branch.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Selective Service System also provide some\r\ninteresting material, but most of this has been published by the\r\nSelective Service in its _Special Groups_ (Special Monograph Number\r\n10, 2 vols. [Washington: Government Printing Office, 1953]). Far more\r\nimportant are the records of the War Manpower Commission, located in\r\nthe National Archives, which, when studied in conjunction with the\r\npapers of the Secretaries of War and Navy, reveal the influence of the\r\n1940 draft law on the services' racial policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Personal Collections_\r\n\r\nThe official records of the integration of the armed forces are not\r\nlimited to those documents retired by the governmental agencies. Parts\r\nof the story must also be gleaned from documents that for various\r\nreasons have been included in the personal papers of individuals.\r\nDocuments created by government officials, as well as much unofficial\r\nmaterial of special interest, are scattered in a number of\r\ninstitutional or private repositories. Probably the most noteworthy of\r\nthese collections is the papers of the President's Committee on\r\nEquality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces (the Fahy\r\nCommittee) in the Harry S. Truman Library. In addition to this central\r\nsource, the Truman Library also contains materials contributed by\r\nPhilleo Nash, Oscar Chapman, and Clark Clifford, whose work in the\r\nWhite House was intimately, if briefly, concerned with armed forces\r\nintegration. The President's own papers, especially the recently\r\nopened White House Secretary's File, contain a number of important (p. 629)\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nDocuments of special interest can also be found in the Roosevelt\r\nPapers at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and among the various\r\nWhite House files preserved in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library. The\r\nCentral White House file in the John F. Kennedy Library, along with\r\nthe papers of Harris Wofford and Gerhard Gesell, are essential to the\r\nhistory of equal opportunity in the early 1960's. Most of these\r\ncollections are well indexed.\r\n\r\nThe James V. Forrestal Papers, Princeton University Library, while\r\nhelpful in tracing the Urban League's contribution to the Navy's\r\nintegration policy, lack the focus and comprehensiveness of the\r\nForrestal Papers in the National Archives' Office of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy file. Another collection of particular interest for the naval\r\naspects of the story is the Dennis D. Nelson Papers, in the custody of\r\nthe Nelson family in San Diego, California, with a microfilm copy on\r\nfile in the Navy's Operational Archives Branch in Washington. The\r\nheart of this collection is the materials Nelson gathered while\r\nwriting \"The Integration of the Negro in the United States Navy,\r\n1776-1947,\" a U.S. Navy monograph prepared in 1948. The Nelson\r\ncollection also contains a large group of newspaper clippings and\r\nother rare secondary materials of special interest. The Maxie M. Berry\r\nPapers, in the custody of the equal opportunity officer of the U.S.\r\nCoast Guard headquarters, offer a rare glimpse into the life of black\r\nCoast Guardsmen during World War II, especially those assigned to the\r\nall-black Pea Island Station, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Army Military History Research Collection at Carlisle\r\nBarracks, Pennsylvania, has acquired the papers of James C. Evans, the\r\nlong-time Civilian Aide to the Secretaries of War and Defense, and\r\nthose of Lt. Gen. Alvan C. Gillem, Jr., the chairman of the Army's\r\nspecial personnel board that bears his name. The Evans materials\r\ncontain a rare collection of clippings and memorandums on integration\r\nin the armed forces; the Gillem Papers are particularly interesting\r\nfor the summaries of testimony before the Gillem Board.\r\n\r\nThe papers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\r\nPeople in the Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, are useful,\r\nespecially if used in conjunction with that library's Arthur B.\r\nSpingarn Papers, in assessing the role of the civil rights leaders in\r\nbringing about black participation in World War II. The collection of\r\nsecondary materials on Negroes in the armed forces in the Schomburg\r\nCollection, New York Public Library, however, is disappointing,\r\nconsidering the prominence of that institution.\r\n\r\nFinally, the U.S. Army Center of Military History, Washington, D.C.,\r\nhas on file those materials collected by the author in the preparation\r\nof this volume, including not only those items cited in the footnotes,\r\nbut also copies of hundreds of official documents and correspondence\r\nwith various participants, together with the unique body of documents\r\nand notes collected by Lee Nichols in his groundbreaking research on\r\nintegration. Of particular importance among the documents in the\r\nCenter of Military History are copies of many Bureau of Naval\r\nPersonnel documents, the originals of which have since been destroyed,\r\nas well as copies of the bulk of the papers produced by the Fahy\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interviews_                                                       (p. 630)\r\n\r\nThe status of black servicemen in the integration era has attracted\r\nconsiderable attention among oral history enthusiasts. The author has\r\ntaken advantage of this special source, but oral testimony concerning\r\nintegration must be treated cautiously. In addition to the usual\r\ndangers of fallible memory that haunt all oral history interviews, the\r\nsubjects of some of these interviews, it should be emphasized, were\r\nseparated from the events they were recalling by a civil rights\r\nrevolution that has changed fundamentally the attitudes of many\r\npeople, both black and white. In some instances it is readily apparent\r\nthat the recollections of persons being interviewed have been colored\r\nby the changes of the 1950's and 1960's, and while their recitation of\r\nspecific events can be checked against the records, their estimates of\r\nattitudes and influences, not so easily verified, should be used\r\ncautiously. Much of this danger can be avoided by a skillful\r\ninterviewer with special knowledge of integration. Because of the care\r\nthat went into the interviews conducted in the U.S. Air Force Oral\r\nHistory Program, which are on file at the Albert F. Simpson Historical\r\nResearch Center, they are particularly dependable. This is especially\r\ntrue of those used in this study, for they were conducted by Lt. Col.\r\nAlan Gropman and Maj. Alan Osur, both serious students of the subject.\r\nParticular note should be made of the especially valuable interviews\r\nwith former Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert and several\r\nof the more prominent black generals.\r\n\r\nThe extensive Columbia University Oral History Collection has several\r\ninterviews of special interest, in particular the very revealing\r\ninterview with the National Urban League's Lester Granger. Read in\r\nconjunction with the National Archives' Forrestal Papers, this\r\ninterview is a major source for the Navy's immediate postwar policy\r\nchanges. Similarly, the Kennedy Library's oral history program\r\ncontains several interviews that are helpful in assessing the role of\r\nthe services in the Kennedy administration's civil rights program. Of\r\nparticular interest are the interviews with Harris Wofford, Roy\r\nWilkins, and Theodore Hesburgh.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Marine Corps Oral History Program, whose interviews are on\r\nfile in Marine Corps headquarters, and the U.S. Navy Oral History\r\nCollection, copies of which can be found in the Navy's Operational\r\nArchives Branch, contain several interviews of special interest to\r\nresearchers in racial history. Mention should be made of the Marine\r\nCorps interviews with Generals Ray A. Robinson and Alfred G. Noble and\r\nthe Navy's interviews with Captains Mildred McAfee Horton and Dorothy\r\nStratton, leaders of the World War II WAVES and SPARS.\r\n\r\nFinally, included in the files of the Center of Military History is a\r\ncollection of notes taken by Lee Nichols, Martin Blumenson, and the\r\nauthor during their interviews with leading figures in the integration\r\nstory. The Nichols notes, covering the series of interviews conducted\r\nby that veteran reporter in 1953-54, include such items as summaries\r\nof conversations with Harry S. Truman, Truman K. Gibson, Jr., and\r\nEmmett J. Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed Materials_                                                (p. 631)\r\n\r\nMany of the secondary materials found particularly helpful by the\r\nauthor have been cited throughout the volume, but special attention\r\nshould be drawn to certain key works in several categories. In the\r\narea of official works, Ulysses Lee's _The Employment of Negro Troops_\r\nin the United States Army in World War II series (Washington:\r\nGovernment Printing Office, 1966) remains the definitive account of\r\nthe Negro in the World War II Army. The Bureau of Naval Personnel's\r\n\"The Negro in the Navy,\" Bureau of Naval Personnel History of World\r\nWar II (mimeographed, 1946, of which there is a copy in the bureau's\r\nTechnical Library in Washington), is a rare item that has assumed even\r\ngreater significance with the loss of so much of the bureau's records.\r\nPresented without attribution, the text paraphrases many important\r\ndocuments accurately. Margaret L. Geis's \"Negro Personnel in the\r\nEuropean Command, 1 January 1946-30 June 1950,\" part of the Occupation\r\nForces in Europe series (Historical Division, European Command, 1952),\r\nRonald Sher's \"Integration of Negro and White Troops in the U.S. Army,\r\nEurope, 1952-1954\" (Historical Division, Headquarters, U.S. Army,\r\nEurope, 1956), and Charles G. Cleaver, \"Personnel Problems,\" vol. III,\r\npt. 2, of the \"History of the Korean War\" (Military History Section,\r\nHeadquarters, Far East Command, 1952), are important secondary sources\r\nfor guiding the student through a bewildering mass of materials. Alan\r\nM. Osur's _Blacks in the Army Air Forces During World War II: The\r\nProblem of Race Relations_ (Washington: Government Printing Office,\r\n1977) and Alan Gropman's _The Air Force Integrates, 1945-1964_\r\n(Washington: Government Printing Office, 1978), both published by the\r\nOffice of Air Force History, and Henry I. Shaw, Jr., and Ralph W.\r\nDonnelly's _Blacks in the Marine Corps_ (Washington: Government\r\nPrinting Office, 1975) provided official, comprehensive surveys of\r\ntheir subjects. Finally, there is in the files of the Center of\r\nMilitary History a copy of the transcripts of the National Defense\r\nConference on Negro Affairs (26 April 1948). Second only to the\r\ntranscripts of the Fahy Committee hearings in comprehensiveness on the\r\nsubject of postwar racial policies, this document also provides a rare\r\nlook at the attitudes of the traditional black leadership at a crucial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAs the footnotes indicate, congressional documents and newspapers were\r\nalso important resources mined in the preparation of this volume. Of\r\nparticular interest, the Center of Military History has on file a\r\nspecial guide to some of these sources prepared by Lt. Col. Reinhold\r\nS. Schumann (USAR). This guide analyzes the congressional and press\r\nreaction to the 1940 and 1948 draft laws and to the Fahy and Gesell\r\nCommittee reports.\r\n\r\nIn his _Blacks and the Military in American History: A New\r\nPerspective_ (New York: Praeger, 1974), Jack D. Foner provides a fine\r\ngeneral survey of the Negro in the armed forces, including an accurate\r\nsummary of the integration period. Among the many specialized studies\r\non the integration period itself, cited throughout the text, several\r\nmight provide a helpful entree to a complicated subject. The standard\r\naccount is Richard M. Dalfiume's _Desegregation of the_ _United    (p. 632)\r\nStates Armed Forces: Fighting on Two Fronts, 1939-1953_ (Columbia,\r\nMissouri: University of Missouri Press, 1969). Carefully documented\r\nand containing a very helpful bibliography, this work tends to\r\nemphasize the influence of the civil rights advocates and Harry Truman\r\non the integration process. The reader will also benefit from\r\nconsulting Lee Nichols's pioneer work, _Breakthrough on the Color\r\nFront_ (New York: Random House, 1954). Although lacking documentation,\r\nNichols's journalistic account was devised with the help of many of\r\nthe participants and is still of considerable value to the student.\r\nThe reader may also want to consult Richard J. Stillman II's short\r\nsurvey, _Integration of the Negro in the U.S. Armed Forces_ (New York:\r\nPraeger, 1968), principally for its statistical information on the\r\npost-Korean period.\r\n\r\nThe role of President Truman and the Fahy Committee in the integration\r\nof the armed forces has been treated in detail by Dalfiume and by\r\nDonald R. McCoy and Richard T. Ruetten in _Quest and Response:\r\nMinority Rights and the Truman Administration_ (Lawrence, Kansas: The\r\nUniversity of Kansas Press, 1973). A valuable critical appraisal of\r\nthe short-range response of the Army to the Fahy Committee's work\r\nappeared in Edwin W. Kenworthy's \"The Case Against Army Segregation,\"\r\n_Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science_ 275\r\n(May 1951):27-33. In addition, the reader may want to consult William\r\nC. Berman's _The Politics of Civil Rights in the Truman\r\nAdministration_ (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1970) for a\r\ngeneral survey of civil rights in the Truman years.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the Defense Department's equal treatment and\r\nopportunity policy in the 1960's is explained by Adam Yarmolinsky in\r\n_The Military Establishment: Its Impacts on American Society_ (New\r\nYork: Harper & Row, 1971). This book is the work of a number of\r\ninformed specialists sponsored by the 20th Century Fund. A general\r\nsurvey of President Kennedy's civil rights program is presented by\r\nCarl M. Brauer in his _John F. Kennedy and the Second Reconstruction_\r\n(New York: Columbia University Press, 1977). The McNamara era is\r\ntreated in Fred Richard Bahr's \"The Expanding Role of the Department\r\nof Defense as an Instrument of Social Change\" (Ph.D. dissertation,\r\nGeorge Washington University, 1970).\r\n\r\nConcerning the rise of the civil rights movement itself, the reader\r\nwould be advised to consult C. Vann Woodward's masterful _The Strange\r\nCareer of Jim Crow_, 3d ed. rev. (New York: Oxford University Press,\r\n1974), and the two volumes composed by Gesell Committee member\r\nBenjamin Muse, _Ten Years of Prelude: The Story of Integration Since\r\nthe Supreme Court's 1954 Decision_ (New York: The Viking Press, 1964),\r\nand _The American Negro Revolution: From Nonviolence to Black Power,\r\n1963-1967_ (Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 1968). Important\r\naspects of the civil rights movement and its influence on American\r\nservicemen are discussed by Jack Greenberg in _Race Relations and\r\nAmerican Law_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 1959) and Eli\r\nGinzberg, _The Negro Potential_ (New York: Columbia University Press,\r\n1956).\r\n\r\nFinally, many of the documents supporting the history of the\r\nintegration of the armed forces, including complete transcripts of the\r\nFahy Committee hearings and the Conference on Negro Affairs, have  (p. 633)\r\nbeen compiled by the author and Bernard C. Nalty in the multivolumed\r\n_Blacks in the United States Armed Forces: Basic Documents_\r\n(Wilmington: Scholarly Resources, 1977).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex                                                              (p. 635)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md., 605.\r\n\r\n  Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs\r\n    (ACCESS), 601, 601_n_.\r\n\r\n  Adler, Julius Ochs, 314.\r\n\r\n  Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies (McCloy Committee),\r\n    34-35, 39, 41-43, 45, 56, 123.\r\n\r\n  Advisory Commission on Universal Training (Compton Commission), 303.\r\n\r\n  Ailes, Stephen, 574.\r\n\r\n  _Air Force Times_, 411.\r\n\r\n  Air forces\r\n    Second, 273;\r\n    Third, 273;\r\n    Fourth, 273;\r\n    Ninth, 282.\r\n\r\n  Air Training Command, 402, 405.\r\n\r\n  Air Transport Command, 273.\r\n\r\n  Air Transport Wing, 1701st, 411.\r\n\r\n  Airborne Division, 82d, 190-92, 200.\r\n\r\n  Alaskan Command, integration of, 452.\r\n\r\n  Alaskan Department, 190, 197.\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Sadie T.
