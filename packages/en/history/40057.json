MARTIN'S STREET, LONDON\r\n                                   1913\r\n\r\n                                 COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nMen and women are divided, in relation to their papers, into hoarders\r\nand scatterers. Miss Nightingale was a hoarder, and as she lived to be\r\n90 the accumulation of papers, stored in her house at the time of her\r\ndeath, was very great. The papers referring to years up to 1861 had been\r\nneatly done up by herself, and it was evident that not everything had\r\nbeen kept. After that date, time and strength to sort and weed had been\r\nwanting, and Miss Nightingale seems to have thrown little away. Even\r\nsoiled sheets of blotting-paper, on which she had made notes in pencil,\r\nwere preserved. By a Will executed in 1896 she had directed that all her\r\nletters, papers, and manuscripts, with some specific exceptions, should\r\nbe destroyed. By a Codicil executed in the following year she revoked\r\nthis direction, and bequeathed the letters, papers, and manuscripts to\r\nher cousin, Mr. Henry Bonham Carter. After her death the papers were\r\nsorted chronologically by his direction, and they have formed the\r\nprincipal foundation of this Memoir.\r\n\r\nOf expressly autobiographical notes, Miss Nightingale left very few. At\r\nthe date of the Codicil above mentioned she seems to have contemplated\r\nthe probability of some authoritative record of her life; for in that\r\nyear she wrote a short summary of what she called \"My Responsibility to\r\nIndia,\" detailing her relations with successive Secretaries of State,\r\nGovernors-General, and other administrators. Her memory in these matters\r\nwas still accurate, for the summary is fully borne out by letters and\r\nother papers of the several dates: it adds some personal details. In\r\nprivate letters she sometimes recounted, at later times, episodes or\r\nexperiences in her life, but such references are few. Nor, except for a\r\nfew years, did Miss Nightingale keep any formal diary; and during the\r\nCrimean episode she was too incessantly busy with her multitudinous\r\nduties to find time for many private notes.\r\n\r\nThe principal authority for Miss Nightingale's Life is thus the\r\ncollection of papers aforesaid, and these are very copious in\r\ninformation. The records, in one sort or another, of her earlier years\r\nare full. The papers relating to her work during the Crimean War are\r\nvoluminous, and I have supplemented the study of these by consulting the\r\nofficial documents concerning Miss Nightingale's mission which are\r\npreserved, among War Office papers, in the Public Record Office. Her\r\npapers relating to public affairs during the years 1856 to 1861 are also\r\nvery voluminous. After the latter date she seems, as already stated, to\r\nhave kept almost everything, even every advertisement, that she\r\nreceived. She often made notes for important letters that she sent, and\r\nsometimes kept copies of them. Of official documents, of printed\r\nmemoranda, pamphlets, reports, and returns, she accumulated an immense\r\ncollection. And though she was not a regular diarist, she was in the\r\nhabit of jotting down on sheets of notepaper her engagements,\r\nimpressions, thoughts, meditations, as also in many cases reports of\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe collection of letters received by Miss Nightingale, and of her notes\r\nfor letters sent by her, has been supplemented, through the kindness of\r\nmany of her correspondents or their representatives, by letters which\r\nwere received from her. I am more especially indebted in this respect to\r\nthe care of the late Sir Douglas Galton, whose docketed collection of\r\nletters from Miss Nightingale, taken in conjunction with a long series\r\nof his letters to her, forms a main authority for much of the record of\r\nher activity in public affairs. Her letters to Julius and Mary Mohl,\r\nreturned to her after the death of the latter, are, in another way, of\r\npeculiar interest. I am particularly indebted, among the lenders of\r\nletters addressed to nursing friends, to Miss Pringle and to the father\r\nof the late Mrs. Daniel Morris (Miss Rachel Williams). Miss Pringle has\r\nalso favoured me with personal reminiscences.\r\n\r\nFor permission to print letters written to Miss Nightingale, I am\r\nindebted to many of her relations, friends, and correspondents, or their\r\nrepresentatives; to so many, indeed, that I ask them to accept here a\r\ngeneral acknowledgment. I am especially indebted to the King, who has\r\nbeen pleased to permit the publication of letters from Queen Victoria\r\nand some other members of the Royal Family. The German Emperor has\r\ngraciously given a like permission in the case of correspondence with\r\nthe Empress Frederick. The Dowager Grand Duchess (Luise) of Baden has\r\nallowed me to quote from a long series of letters addressed by her to\r\nMiss Nightingale.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext to the letters and other papers, above described, the most valuable\r\nmaterial for the Life of Miss Nightingale is contained in her own\r\nprinted writings--many of them published, some (and these, from the\r\nbiographical point of view, the most important) privately printed. In\r\nthe case of the Crimean War, material under both of these heads is\r\nparticularly abundant. Her published _Notes on Hospitals_ and _Notes on\r\nNursing_ and other works relating to those subjects, together with her\r\nprivately circulated _Addresses to Probationers_, supplement her private\r\nrecords. For her inner life, her privately printed book, Suggestions for\r\nThought, is of special importance.\r\n\r\nA List of Miss Nightingale's Printed Writings (whether published or\r\nprivately circulated) is given at the end of the second volume\r\n(_Appendix A_). My purpose in compiling this List was biographical\r\nillustration, not bibliographical minuteness. I have not included every\r\nscrap from Miss Nightingale's pen which has appeared in print, but have\r\ngiven every piece which is directly or indirectly referred to in the\r\nMemoir, or which is of any importance. The List will, I hope, serve a\r\ndouble purpose. It enables me to abbreviate in the text the references\r\nto my authorities; and it provides, in chronological order, a conspectus\r\nof Miss Nightingale's varied activities, so far as they were reflected\r\nin her printed writings.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is much biographical material, not only in Blue-books and\r\nofficial reports, but in writings about Miss Nightingale. Except in the\r\ncase of the Crimean War, where many eye-witnesses recorded their\r\nobservations or impressions, this material is not all of great value.\r\nThroughout her subsequent life, Miss Nightingale was screened from the\r\npublic gaze; a somewhat legendary figure grew up, and it is that which\r\nfor the most part appears in books about her. This, however, is a\r\nsubject fully dealt with in an Introductory chapter. In _Appendix B_ I\r\ngive a short List of Writings about Miss Nightingale. Here, again, the\r\npurpose is not bibliographical. There is a great mass of such writing,\r\nand a complete list would have been altogether outside the scope of a\r\nbiography. I have included only first-hand authorities or such other\r\nbooks, etc., as for one reason or another (explained in the notes upon\r\neach item) seemed relevant to the Memoir. This second List also serves\r\nthe purpose of simplifying references in the text.\r\n\r\nIn a third Appendix (_C_) I have enumerated the principal portraits of\r\nMiss Nightingale. Notes on those reproduced in this book will there be\r\nfound. I am indebted to the kindness of Sir William Richmond and Sir\r\nHarry Verney for the inclusion of the portrait which forms the\r\nfrontispiece to the second volume, and to Mrs. Cunliffe for the\r\nfrontispiece to the present volume.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Miss Nightingale's executors I am indebted for the confidence which\r\nthey have shown in entrusting her Papers to my discretion. A biography\r\nis worth nothing unless it is sincere. The aim of the present book has\r\nbeen to tell the truth about the subject of it, and I have done my work\r\nunder no conscious temptation to suppress, exaggerate, extenuate, or\r\ndistort. From Miss Nightingale's executors, and from other of her\r\nfriends and relations, I have received help and information which has\r\nbeen of the greatest assistance. More especially I am indebted to her\r\ncousin, Mrs. Vaughan Nash, who has been good enough to read my book,\r\nboth in manuscript and in proof, and who has favoured me throughout with\r\nvaluable information, corrections, suggestions, and criticisms. This\r\nobligation makes it the more incumbent upon me to add that for any\r\nfaults in the book, whether of commission or of omission, I alone must\r\nbear the blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTORY                                                       xxiii\r\n\r\n                                  PART I\r\n                          ASPIRATION (1820-1854)\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER I\r\n                          CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION\r\n                                (1820-1839)\r\n\r\n  Name, ancestry, and parentage.

She wanted to know at every stage\r\nprecisely what a person, or a book, or an institution was driving at.\r\n\"Of all human sounds,\" she said, \"I think the words _I don't know_ are\r\nthe saddest.\" Unless a book had something of definite importance to say,\r\nit had better, she thought, not be written; and in order to save the\r\nreader's time and fix his attention, he should be told at once wherein\r\nthe significance of the book consists. This, though it may be a hard\r\nsaying, is perhaps not unwholesome even to biographers. At any rate, as\r\nMiss Nightingale's biographer, I am moved to obey her injunction. I\r\npropose, therefore, in this Introductory chapter to state wherein, as I\r\nconceive, the significance and importance of Miss Nightingale's life\r\nconsists, and what the work was that she did in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     I\r\n\r\n\"In the course of a life's experience such as scarcely any one has ever\r\nhad, I have always found,\" said Miss Nightingale,[1] \"that no one ever\r\ndeserves his or her character. Be it better or worse than the real one,\r\nit is always unlike the real one.\" Of no one is this saying more true\r\nthan of herself. \"It has been your fate,\" said Mr. Jowett to her once,\r\n\"to become a Legend in your lifetime.\" Now, nothing is more persistent\r\nthan a legend; and the legend of Florence Nightingale became fixed early\r\nin her life--at a time, indeed, antecedent to that at which her best\r\nwork in the world, as she thought, had begun. The popular imagination of\r\nMiss Nightingale is of a girl of high degree who, moved by a wave of\r\npity, forsook the pleasures of fashionable life for the horrors of the\r\nCrimean War; who went about the hospitals of Scutari with a lamp,\r\nscattering flowers of comfort and ministration; who retired at the close\r\nof the war into private life, and lived thenceforth in the seclusion of\r\nan invalid's room--a seclusion varied only by good deeds to hospitals\r\nand nurses and by gracious and sentimental pieties. I do not mean, of\r\ncourse, that this was all that anybody knew or wrote about her. Any such\r\nsuggestion would be far from the truth. But the popular idea of Florence\r\nNightingale's life has been based on some such lines as I have\r\nindicated, and the general conception of her character is to this day\r\nfounded upon them. The legend was fixed by Longfellow's poem and Miss\r\nYonge's _Golden Deeds_. Its growth was favoured by the fact of Miss\r\nNightingale's seclusion, by the hidden, almost the secretive, manner in\r\nwhich she worked, by her shrinking from publicity, by her extreme\r\nreticence about herself. It is only now, when her Papers are accessible,\r\nthat her real life can be known. There are some elements of truth in the\r\npopular legend, but it is so remote from the whole truth as to convey in\r\ngeneral impression everything but the truth. The real Florence\r\nNightingale was very different from the legendary, but also greater. Her\r\nlife was built on larger lines, her work had more importance, than\r\nbelong to the legend.\r\n\r\n  [1] In a letter to Madame Mohl, December 13, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe Crimean War was not the first thing, and still less was it the last,\r\nthat is significant in Miss Nightingale's life. The story of her earlier\r\nyears is that of the building up of a character. It shows us a girl of\r\nhigh natural ability and of considerable attractions feeling her way to\r\nan ideal alike in practice and in speculation. Having found it, she was\r\nthrown into revolt against the environment of her home. We shall see her\r\npursuing her ideal with consistent, though with self-torturing, tenacity\r\nagainst alike the obstacles and the temptations of circumstance. She\r\nhad already served an apprenticeship when the call to the Crimea came.\r\nIt was a call not to \"sacrifice,\" but to the fulfilment of her dearest\r\nwishes for a life of active usefulness. Such is the theme of the _First\r\nPart_, which I have called \"Aspiration.\"\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany other women have passed through similar experiences. But there is\r\nspecial significance in them in the case of Florence Nightingale--a\r\nsignificance both historic and personal. The glamour that surrounded her\r\nservice in the Crimea, the wide-world publicity that was given to her\r\nname and deeds, invested with peculiar importance her fight for freedom.\r\nTo do \"as Florence Nightingale did\" became an object of imitation which\r\nthe well-to-do world was henceforth readier to condone, or even to\r\napprove; and thus the story of Miss Nightingale's earlier years is the\r\nhistory of a pioneer, on one side, in the emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nFor the understanding of her own later life, the earlier years are\r\nall-important. They give the clue to her character, and explain much\r\nthat would otherwise be puzzling or confused. Through great difficulties\r\nand at a heavy price she had purchased her birthright--her ideal of\r\nself-expression in work. On her return from the Crimea she was placed,\r\non the one hand, owing to her fame, in a position of special\r\nopportunity; on the other hand, owing to illness, in a position of\r\nspecial disability. She shaped her life henceforward so as to make these\r\ntwo factors conform to the continued fulfilment of her ideal. I need not\r\nhere forestall what subsequent chapters will abundantly illustrate. I\r\nwill only say that the resultant effect was a manner of life and work,\r\nboth extraordinary, and, to me at least, of the greatest interest.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Second Part_ of the Memoir is devoted to the Crimean War. The\r\npopular conception with regard to Miss Nightingale's work during this\r\nepisode in her life is not untrue so far as it goes, but it is amazingly\r\nshort of the whole truth as now ascertainable from her Papers. The\r\npopular imagination pictures Florence Nightingale at Scutari and in the\r\nCrimea as \"the ministering angel.\" And such in very truth she was. But\r\nthe deeper significance of her work in the Crimean War lies elsewhere.\r\nIt was as Administrator and Reformer, more than as Angel, that she\r\nshowed her peculiar powers. Queen Victoria, with native shrewdness and a\r\ntouch of humour, hit off the truth about Miss Nightingale's services in\r\nthe Crimea in concise words: \"Such a clear head. I wish we had her at\r\nthe War Office.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of Miss Nightingale's service in the Crimea was great.\r\nSome of it is obvious, and on the moral side Longfellow's poem said the\r\nfirst, and the last, word. She may also be accounted, if not the\r\nfounder, yet the promoter of Female Nursing in war, and the Red Cross\r\nSocieties throughout the world are, as we shall hear, the direct outcome\r\nof her labours in the Crimea. The indirect, and less obvious, results\r\nwere in many spheres. From a sick-room in the West End of London Miss\r\nNightingale played a part--and a much larger part than could be known\r\nwithout access to her Papers--in reforming the sanitary administration\r\nof the British army, in reconstructing hospitals throughout the world,\r\nin founding the modern art of nursing, in setting up a sanitary\r\nadministration in India, and in promoting various other reforms in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's return from the Crimea, it will thus be seen, was not\r\nthe end of her active life. In a sense it was the beginning. The nursing\r\nat Scutari and in the Crimea was an episode. The fame which she shunned,\r\nbut which nevertheless came to her, gave her a starting-point for doing\r\nwork which was destined, as she hoped, and as in large measure was\r\ngranted, to be of permanent service to her country and the world. The\r\nfirst chapter of the _Third Part_ shows her laying her plans for the\r\nhealth of the British soldier, and the subsequent chapters tell what\r\nfollowed. This is the period of Miss Nightingale's close co-operation\r\nwith Sidney Herbert. To the writer this later phase of Miss\r\nNightingale's life--with its ingenious adjustment of means to ends, its\r\nmasterful resourcefulness, its incessant industry, and then with its\r\nperpetual struggle against physical weakness and its extraordinary power\r\nof devoted concentration--has seemed not less interesting than the\r\nCrimean episode.\r\n\r\nThe _Fourth Part_ describes, as its main themes, the work which Miss\r\nNightingale did, concurrently with that described in the preceding Part,\r\nas Hospital Reformer and the Founder of Modern Nursing. Other chapters\r\nintroduce two topics which might at first sight seem widely separate,\r\nbut which were yet closely associated in Miss Nightingale's mind. They\r\ndeal with her, respectively, as a Passionate Statistician and as a\r\nReligious Thinker. The nature of her speculations is fully explained in\r\nthe latter chapters, and elsewhere in the memoir. It will be seen that\r\nMiss Nightingale had thought out a scheme of religious belief which\r\nwidely differed from the creeds of Christian orthodoxy, whether Catholic\r\nor Protestant, but which yet admitted of accommodation to much of their\r\nlanguage and formularies. It admitted also, as will appear in due\r\ncourse, of close alliance with mysticism. Miss Nightingale believed\r\nintensely in a Personal God and in personal religion. The language which\r\nexpressed most adequately to her the sense of union with God was the\r\nlanguage of the Greek and Christian mystics. But \"law\" was to her \"the\r\nthought of God\"; union with God meant co-operation with Him towards\r\nhuman perfectibility; and for the discovery of \"the thought of God\"\r\nstatistics were to her mind an indispensable means.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _Fifth Part_ we are introduced to a new interest in Miss\r\nNightingale's life, a new sphere of her work. For forty years she worked\r\nat Indian questions. She took up the subject at first through interest\r\nin the army. It was a natural supplement to her efforts for the health\r\nof the British soldier at home, to make a like attempt on behalf of the\r\narmy in India. Gradually she was drawn into other questions, and she\r\nbecame a keen Indian reformer all along the line. Her assiduity, her\r\npersistence, her ingenuity were as marked in this sphere as in others;\r\nit was only her immediate success that was less.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the primary object with which she began her Indian\r\ncampaigns, Miss Nightingale's life and work have great importance. The\r\nRoyal Commission of 1859-63, which was due to her, and the measures\r\ntaken in consequence of its Report, were the starting-point of a new era\r\nin sanitary improvement for the army. The results have been most\r\nsalutary. Miss Nightingale's friendship with Lord Stanley and with Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence here served her somewhat as that with Mr. Herbert served\r\nin the earlier campaign. In the wider sphere of Indian sanitation\r\ngenerally Miss Nightingale's efforts were not so successful. The field\r\nwas perhaps too vast, the conditions were too adverse, for any great and\r\nimmediate success to be possible. Yet this and her other efforts for\r\nIndia were the part of Miss Nightingale's life and work to which she\r\nattached most importance, and by the record of which she set most store.\r\nEven in the Will (afterwards revoked) directing her Papers to be\r\ndestroyed, she made exception of those relating to India; and, as\r\nalready stated in the preface, one of her few pieces of autobiographical\r\nrecord related to her Indian work. Perhaps it was the special affection\r\nwhich a mother often feels for the least robust or least successful\r\nchild. Perhaps it was that she took long views; and that, foreseeing a\r\nfuture time when many of the reforms for which she had toiled might be\r\naccomplished, she desired to be remembered as a pioneer. \"Sanitation,\"\r\nsaid a high authority in 1894, \"is the Cinderella of the Indian\r\nadministrative family.\"[2] The difficulty of finding money and a\r\nreluctance to introduce Western reforms in advance of Eastern opinion\r\nare objections with which we shall often meet in the correspondence of\r\nIndian officials with Miss Nightingale, and they are still raised in the\r\npresent day.[3] On the other hand, the Under-Secretary for India, in his\r\nBudget Statement for 1913, declared that \"the service which has the\r\nstrongest claim after education on the resources of the Government is\r\nsanitation,\" and explained that \"the Budget estimate of expenditure for\r\nsanitation comes this year to nearly £2,000,000, showing an increase of\r\n112 per cent over the expenditure of three years ago.\" So perhaps\r\nCinderella is to go to the ball; if ever the glass slipper is found,\r\nlet it be remembered, as this Memoir will show, that Miss Nightingale\r\nwas the good fairy.\r\n\r\n  [2] Sir Auckland Colvin in the _Journal of the Society of Arts_, May 11,\r\n      1894, p. 515.\r\n\r\n  [3] As, for instance, in some of the speeches in the House of Lords on\r\n      June 9, 1913, and in a leading article in the _Times_ of the\r\n      following day. The speech of Lord Midleton, in introducing the\r\n      subject, was, on the other hand, upon Miss Nightingale's lines,\r\n      being founded upon the Report of her Royal Commission of 1859-63.\r\n      Some pages (194-197) in Mr. George Peel's _The Future of England_\r\n      (1911) are on similar lines.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer Indian work continued as long as she was able to work at all, and\r\nfrom 1862 onwards it forms one of the recurring themes in our story. The\r\n_Sixth Part_, while continuing that subject, introduces another sphere\r\nin which Miss Nightingale's life and work have important significance.\r\nFrom the reform of Hospital Nursing she turned, in conjunction with the\r\nlate Mr. William Rathbone, to the reform of workhouse nursing. And as\r\none thing led to another, it will be seen that Miss Nightingale deserves\r\nto be remembered also as a Poor Law Reformer.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Seventh Part_ comprises the last thirty-eight years of Miss\r\nNightingale's life (1872-1910), and a word or two may here be said to\r\nexplain an apparent alteration of scale. In a biography the scale must\r\nbe proportionate not to the number of the years, but to their richness\r\nin characteristic significance. After 1872, the year in which (as Miss\r\nNightingale put it) she went \"out of office,\" her life was less full\r\nthan theretofore in new activities. The germinant seeds had all been\r\nsown. But these later years, though they have admitted of more summary\r\ntreatment, were full of interest. The chapters in which they are\r\nrecorded deal first with Miss Nightingale's literary work, and more\r\nespecially with her studies in Plato and the Christian mystics. These\r\nstudies were in part a result of her close friendship of thirty years\r\nwith Mr. Jowett. Then, too, occasion is found for an endeavour to\r\nportray Miss Nightingale as the Mother-Chief (for so they called her) of\r\nthe Nurses. It is only by access to her enormous correspondence in this\r\nsort that the range and extent of her personal influence can be\r\nmeasured. Her ideal of the nursing vocation stands out very clearly from\r\nthe famous \"Nurses' Battle\" which occupied much of her later years. She\r\nfound an opportunity during the same period to start an important\r\nexperiment in Rural Hygiene. At the same time she was preaching\r\nindefatigably the need of Health missionaries in Indian villages. And\r\nthen came the end. To the time of labour, there succeeds in every life,\r\nsays Ruskin, \"the time of death; which in happy lives is very short, but\r\nalways a _time_.\" In the case of Miss Nightingale the time was long. She\r\nlived for many years after the power to labour was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nSo much, by way of preface, in explanation of the significance of Miss\r\nNightingale's life and work. But this book endeavours to depict a\r\ncharacter, as well as to record a career. There has been much\r\ndiscussion, in our days as in others, of the proper scope and method of\r\nbiography, and various models are held up, in one sense or another, to\r\npractitioners in this difficult art. The questions are propounded,\r\nwhether biography should describe a person's life or his character? his\r\nwork or how he did it? If the person did anything worthy of record, a\r\nbiography should, surely, describe alike the life and the character, the\r\nwork and the methods. The biographer may fail in his attempt; but in the\r\ncase of Miss Nightingale the attempt is peculiarly necessary, because\r\nall that she did and the manner in which she did it were, as it has\r\nseemed to me, characteristic of a strongly-marked personality behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis book is, however, a biography and not a history. It is not a\r\nhistory of the Crimean War, nor of nursing, nor of Indian\r\nadministration. Something on all these matters will be found in it; but\r\nonly so much of detail as was necessary to place Miss Nightingale's work\r\nin its true light and to exhibit her characteristic methods. So, also,\r\nmany other persons will pass across the stage--persons drawn from a\r\ngreat many different classes, occupations, walks in life; but the book\r\ndoes not aim at giving a detailed picture of \"Miss Nightingale's\r\ncircle.\" Her relations, her friends, her acquaintances, her\r\ncorrespondents only concern us here in so far as their dealings with her\r\naffected her work, or illustrate her character.\r\n\r\nHere, again--to revert to what has been said above--it will be found, I\r\nthink, that this book possesses a certain significance as correcting, or\r\nsupplementing, a popular legend. A preacher, in an obituary sermon upon\r\nMiss Nightingale, said that all her work was done \"by force of simple\r\ngoodness.\" Assuredly Miss Nightingale was a good woman, and there was\r\nalso a certain simplicity about her. But there was much else. A man of\r\naffairs, who in the course of a long and varied life had come in contact\r\nwith many of the acutest intellects and greatest administrators of the\r\ntime, said of Miss Nightingale that hers was the clearest brain he had\r\never known in man or woman. Strength of head was quite as marked in her\r\nas goodness of heart, and she had at least as much of adroitness as of\r\nsimplicity. Her character was in fact curiously many-sided. A remarkable\r\nvariety of interests, motives, methods will be found coming into play in\r\nthe course of this record. The Florence Nightingale who will be shown in\r\nit--by her acts, her methods, her sayings, her ways of looking at things\r\nand people--is a very different person from Santa Filomena. Miss\r\nNightingale has been given a place among the saints in the popular\r\ncalendars of many nations; and she deserves the canonisation, but not\r\nentirely for the popular reasons. Her character, as I have endeavoured\r\nto depict it, was stronger, more spacious, and, as I have felt, more\r\nlovable than that of The Lady with the Lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PART I\r\n\r\n                                ASPIRATION\r\n\r\n                                (1820-1854)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 I go to prove my soul!\r\n             I see my way as birds their trackless way.\r\n             I shall arrive--what time, what circuit first,\r\n             I ask not; but unless God send his hail\r\n             Or blinding fire-balls, sleet, or stifling snow,\r\n             In some time, his good time, I shall arrive:\r\n             He guides me and the bird. In his good time.\r\n                                      BROWNING: _Paracelsus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                          CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION\r\n                                (1820-1839)\r\n\r\n\r\n     I found her in her chamber reading _Phaedon Platonis_ in Greek, and\r\n     that with as much pleasure as some gentlemen would read a merry\r\n     tale in Bocace.--ROGER ASCHAM.\r\n\r\nTo the tender sentiment and popular adoration that gathered around the\r\nsubject of this Memoir, something perhaps was added by the beauty of a\r\nname which linked together the City of the Flowers and the music of the\r\nbirds. Her surname suggested to Longfellow the title of the poem which\r\nhas carried home to the hearts of thousands in two continents a lesson\r\nof her life. The popularity of \"Florence\"--in the Middle Ages a\r\nmasculine name--as a Christian name for English girls is noted by the\r\nhistorian of that subject as due to association with the heroine of the\r\nCrimea.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoth of her names were the result of circumstance. Her father came of\r\nthe old Derbyshire family of Shore of Tapton, and changed his name in\r\n1815 from William Edward Shore to William Edward Nightingale on\r\nsucceeding to the property of his mother's uncle, Peter Nightingale of\r\nLea, in the same county. Mr. William Nightingale was fond of travel, and\r\nthe close of the French war, shortly before his marriage (1818), had\r\nthrown the Continent open to the grand tour. Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale's\r\nonly children, two daughters, were born during a sojourn in Italy. The\r\nelder was born at Naples in 1819, and was named, firstly, Frances,\r\nafter her mother, and, secondly, after the old Greek settlement on the\r\nsite of her birthplace, Parthenope. She afterwards became the second\r\nwife of Sir Harry Verney.[4] The younger daughter, the subject of this\r\nMemoir, was also named after her birthplace. She was born at Florence on\r\nMay 12, 1820, in the Villa Colombaia, near the Porta Romana, as a\r\nmemorial-tablet now affixed to the house records; and there on the 4th\r\nof July she was baptized by Dr. Trevor, Prebendary of Chester. The\r\nplace-names became in familiar intercourse \"Parthe\" or \"Pop,\" and \"Flo.\"\r\n\r\n\"The surprises of sainthood,\" said a speaker at a Congress on Eugenics,\r\n\"are no less remarkable than those of genius. St. Francis of Assisi, St.\r\nCatherine of Siena, and Florence Nightingale could no more have been\r\npredicted from their ancestry than Napoleon, Beethoven, Michael Angelo,\r\nor Shakespeare.\" But the peculiarities of tissue on which some physical\r\ncharacteristics are held to depend can, at any rate, be inherited.\r\nFlorence Nightingale's mother was one of the eleven children of William\r\nSmith of Parndon Hall, Essex, of whom Sir James Stephen said: \"When he\r\nhad nearly completed four score years, he could still gratefully\r\nacknowledge that he had no remembrance of any bodily pain or illness,\r\nand that of the very numerous family of which he was the head every\r\nmember still lived to support and gladden his old age.\" This statement\r\nis not absolutely correct, for one child did not long survive its birth;\r\nbut of the other sons and daughters of William Smith, none died at an\r\nearlier age than 69, two lived to be more than 75, six to be more than\r\n80, and one to be more than 90. This last was Frances, Mrs. Nightingale,\r\nwho lived to be 92. On the father's side there was longevity also. Mr.\r\nNightingale himself lived to be 80. His mother lived to be 95; he had an\r\naunt who lived to be 90; and \"your uncle,\" wrote his father, \"young at\r\n82, enters into politics of the present moment with all the ardour of\r\n22.\" Of the children of Mr. and Mrs. William Nightingale, Parthenope\r\nlived to be 75, and Florence, though (or, in part, perhaps, because)\r\nshe lived for 53 years the life of an invalid, attained the age of 90.\r\n\r\n  [4] To avoid confusion, I sometimes refer to her before her marriage as\r\n      \"Lady Verney,\" reserving \"Miss Nightingale\" throughout for Florence.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale, whether saint or not, was certainly conscious of a\r\n\"call\"; but there was nothing in her descent or inheritance which\r\nencouraged her parents to allow it to become readily effectual. Because\r\nshe was a woman, her early life was one long struggle for liberation\r\nfrom circumstance and social prepossessions. Yet there were features in\r\nher mental equipment and intellectual outlook which may well have been\r\ninherited, and which certainly owed much to environment. Sir James\r\nStephen adds to the remarks quoted above that if William Smith \"had gone\r\nmourning all his days, he could scarcely have acquired a more tender\r\npity for the miserable, or have laboured more habitually for their\r\nrelief.\" In politics he was a follower of Fox. He was a friend of\r\nWilberforce, with whom he co-operated in the House of Commons in the\r\nAbolitionist and other humanitarian movements. Of Wilberforce, as of\r\nThomas Clarkson, \"he possessed the almost brotherly love, and of all\r\ntheir fellow-labourers there was none who was more devoted to their\r\ncause, or whom they more entirely trusted.\"[5] In religion a Unitarian,\r\nhe was a stout defender of liberty of thought and conscience, a\r\npersistent opponent of religious tests and disabilities. The liberal\r\nopinions, alike in Church and State, which were thus traditional in the\r\nfamily of Florence Nightingale's mother, were shared by that of her\r\nfather. Her grandfather Shore, in a letter to his son in 1818, referred\r\nto \"one of the finest pieces of eloquence either in ancient or modern\r\ntimes, given by Sir Samuel Romilly in the Court of Chancery on a motion\r\nrespecting the right of Jews to the benefit of a charity in Bedford. It\r\ndoes honour to the man and to human nature.\" Florence Nightingale's\r\nfather was also a Unitarian; and in politics he was a Whig. \"How I hate\r\nTories,\" he wrote to his wife; and in another letter, after the election\r\nof 1835, in which the hated ones had gained ground, he explained that\r\nthey were mighty only \"by Beer, Brandy, and Money.\" The Whigs, as is\r\nwell known, were not all lacking in the latter equipment for political\r\nsuccess, and Mr. Nightingale was a frequent subscriber to electoral\r\nfunds on the Whig side. He was an ardent supporter of Parliamentary\r\nReform. He held that \"Bentham has taught great moral truth more\r\neffectually than all the Christian divines.\" At a later time he was a\r\nfollower of Lord Palmerston, of whom he was also a neighbour in the\r\ncountry. One of the earliest notices which I find of Florence\r\nNightingale's interest in politics is in a letter from her father\r\ndescribing a meeting at Romsey to which he had taken her. \"Florence,\" he\r\nsays, \"approved very much Palmerston's exposition of his foreign\r\npolicy.\"\r\n\r\n  [5] _Essays in Ecclesiastical Biography_, \"The Clapham Sect,\"\r\n      pp. 543-544 (ed. 1860). Miss Nightingale referred to this association\r\n      of her grandfather with Wilberforce and Clarkson in one of her\r\n      _Addresses to Probationers_ (1875).\r\n\r\nSomething else Florence Nightingale owed to, or shared with, her father.\r\nHe, like some other members of his family, was of a reflective\r\ntemperament, interested in speculative problems. There is a letter\r\nwritten by him to his wife from his father's sick-room (Sept. 1822)\r\nwhich shows the bent of his thoughts:--\r\n\r\n     I sit by his bedside and look at him as one would at a sleeping\r\n     man, the idea of death only now and then flashing across my mind. I\r\n     have been _studying_ Mad. de Staël on the feeling of conviction,\r\n     which exists more or less in different people and different\r\n     nations, on the subject of soul as independent of external ideas.\r\n     My imagination is a dull one, for it certainly required _study_\r\n     with me to feel the full force of conviction that soul does and\r\n     must exist quite separately from, though influenced by, external\r\n     circumstances. _You_ will say, I know, with a firm belief in\r\n     Scripture and religion, Leave all philosophical speculation to the\r\n     wild imaginations of the Germans. Nothing can change _your_\r\n     reliance on religion. The perversity of _my_ nature refers me to\r\n     experience and analogies, though I begin to think that the study of\r\n     the creation displayed before our faculties will exalt me into a\r\n     conception of Divinity completely pervading the whole, but\r\n     particularly that part of man which enables him to feel the\r\n     difference between right and wrong independently of the ideas which\r\n     he derives from external circumstances.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale's mother accepted the religious standpoint of the\r\nday without question. Unitarianism was dropped by her and by her elder\r\ndaughter; by Florence it was, as we shall hear, transcended. The\r\nmother's essential bent was practical, though the scope of it was\r\nsomewhat limited. The mind of her daughter Florence found room in equal\r\nmeasure for practice and for contemplation. She inherited her mother's\r\norganising capacity, though she turned it to directions of her own. It\r\nwas from her father that she inherited the taste for speculative inquiry\r\nwhich absorbed a large part of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nFrom the worldly circumstances of her parents Florence came to draw\r\nconclusions little sympathetic, in some respects, with existing usages\r\nand conventions. She accepted, indeed, the position of worldly wealth\r\ninto which she was born without any fundamental questioning. In later\r\nyears a young friend, on being urged to visit the villagers around one\r\nof Miss Nightingale's country homes, explained that she did not like the\r\nrelation, she could not bring herself to go from a big comfortable house\r\nto instruct poor people how to live. Miss Nightingale laughed, and said,\r\n\"You surely don't call Lea Hurst a big house.\" It had only about fifteen\r\nbedrooms. She took for granted the position into which she was born. But\r\nshe thought that wealth should only be used as a means of work. The\r\neasy, comfortable, not very strenuous conditions of her home life as a\r\ngirl fixed the nature of her earlier years, but her soul did not become\r\nrooted in them. They sowed seeds which grew, as the years passed, not\r\ninto acquiescence, but into revolt. Mr. Nightingale had inherited his\r\ngreat-uncle's property when nine years old. It accumulated for him, and\r\na lead mine added greatly to its value. By the time of his marriage he\r\nwas blessed (or, as his younger daughter came to think, afflicted) by\r\nthe possession of a considerable fortune. Whether it were indeed a\r\nblessing or an affliction, it involved him in much uncertainty of mind.\r\nHe and his wife returned from the Continent with their infant daughters\r\nin 1821, and the question became urgent, Where to live? The landed\r\nproperty which he inherited from his great-uncle was a comparatively\r\nsmall estate at and around Lea Hall in Derbyshire. To this property he\r\nadded largely. The Hall, the old residence of his great-uncle, was\r\ndiscarded (it is now used as a farm-house), and Mr. Nightingale built a\r\nnew house, called Lea Hurst. The charm of its situation and prospect is\r\ndescribed in a letter by Mrs. Gaskell:--\r\n\r\n     \"High as Lea Hurst is, one seems on a pinnacle, with the clouds\r\n     careering round one. Down below is a garden with stone terraces and\r\n     flights of steps--the planes of these terraces being perfectly\r\n     gorgeous with masses of hollyhocks, dahlias, nasturtiums,\r\n     geraniums, etc. Then a sloping meadow losing itself in a steep\r\n     wooded descent (such tints over the wood!) to the river Derwent,\r\n     the rocks on the other side of which form the first distance, and\r\n     are of a red colour streaked with misty purple. Beyond this,\r\n     interlacing hills, forming three ranges of distance; the first,\r\n     deep brown with decaying heather; the next, in some purple shadow,\r\n     and the last catching some pale, watery sunlight.\" \"I am left\r\n     alone,\" continued Mrs. Gaskell, \"established high up, in two rooms,\r\n     opening one out of the other--the old nurseries.\" (The inner one,\r\n     in which Mrs. Gaskell slept, was, when Parthenope grew up, her\r\n     bedroom.) \"It is curious how simple it is. The old carpet doesn't\r\n     cover the floor. No easy chair, no sofa, a little curtainless bed,\r\n     a small glass. In the outer room--the former day nursery--Miss\r\n     Florence's room when she is at home, everything is equally simple;\r\n     now, of course, the bed is reconverted into a sofa; two small\r\n     tables, a few bookshelves, a drab carpet only partially covering\r\n     the clean boards, and stone-coloured walls--as cold in colouring as\r\n     need be, but with one low window on one side, trellised over with\r\n     Virginian creeper as gorgeous as can be; and the opposite one, by\r\n     which I am writing, looking over such country!\"[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] From a letter to Catherine Winkworth, October 20, 1854, kindly\r\n      communicated by Miss Meta Gaskell. Mrs. Gaskell had gone to stay at\r\n      Lea Hurst with the understanding that she was to have a quiet time\r\n      for writing, remaining in the house as long as she might wish after\r\n      the family had left it. For other passages from the letter, see\r\n      pp. 39, 41, 139.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the Derwent was often in Florence's ears. When she was in\r\nthe Hospital at Scutari any fretting in the Straits recalled it to her.\r\n\"How I like,\" she said on a stormy night, \"to hear that ceaseless roar;\r\nit puts me in mind of the dear Derwent; how often I have listened to it\r\nfrom the nursery window.\"\r\n\r\nLea Hurst became one of Florence Nightingale's earliest homes in\r\nEngland, but it was not the earliest of all. The house was not built\r\nwhen the family returned from the Continent, and Mr. Nightingale took\r\nKynsham Court, Presteigne, in Herefordshire. The place, it seems, was\r\n\"more picturesque than habitable,\" and negotiations for the purchase of\r\nit, with a view to improvements, fell through. Mr. Nightingale liked\r\nDerbyshire, and was fond of his new house; but the rich, as well as the\r\npoor, have their perplexities. \"The difficulty is,\" wrote Mr.\r\nNightingale to his wife, \"where is the county that is habitable for\r\ntwelve successive months?\" And, again, \"How would you like\r\nLeicestershire? For my part, I think that, provided I could get about\r\n2000 acres and a house in some neighbouring county where sporting and\r\nscenery were in tolerable abundance, and the visit to Lea Hurst were\r\nannually confined to July, August, September, and October, then all\r\nwould be well.\" While Mrs. Nightingale stayed at Kynsham, or took the\r\nchildren for change of air to the seaside or Tunbridge Wells, Mr.\r\nNightingale divided his time between the management of his property in\r\nDerbyshire and the search for a second home elsewhere. Ultimately he\r\nfound what he wanted at Embley Park in the parish of Wellow, near\r\nRomsey. This estate was bought in 1825, and Kynsham was given up. Embley\r\nis on the edge of the New Forest, and the rich growth of its woods and\r\ngardens is much favoured by sun and moisture. Old oaks and beeches,\r\nthickets of flowering laurel and rhododendron, and a profusion of\r\nflowers and scents, contrast with the bare breezy hills of Derbyshire.\r\nIts new owners had here the variety they wished for, and a full scope\r\nfor their taste. The most praised of its beauties is a long road almost\r\nshut in by masses of rhododendron. One of the occasional pleasures of\r\nMiss Nightingale's later life in London was a drive in the Park, in\r\nrhododendron-time, \"to remind her of Embley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nFrom her fifth year onwards Florence Nightingale had, then, for her\r\nhomes Lea Hurst in the summer months and Embley during the rest of the\r\nyear. The family usually spent a portion of the season in London. The\r\nsisters led, it will thus be seen, a life mainly in the country, and\r\nFlorence as a child became fond of flowers, birds, and beasts. A neatly\r\nprinted manuscript-book is preserved, in which she made a catalogue of\r\nher collection of flowers, describing each with analytical accuracy, and\r\nnoting the particular spot at which it was picked. Her childish letters\r\ncontain many references to animal companions. She made particular\r\nfriends with the nuthatch. She had a pet pig, a pet donkey, a pet pony.\r\nShe was fond of riding, and fond of dogs. \"A small pet animal,\" she said\r\nmany years afterwards, \"is often an excellent companion for the sick,\r\nfor long chronic cases especially.\" \"The more I see of men,\" wrote a\r\ncynic, \"the more I love dogs.\" Florence Nightingale, in the same piece\r\nfrom which I have just quoted, drew a like moral from her experience of\r\nsome nurses. \"An invalid,\" she said, \"in giving an account of his\r\nnursing by a nurse and a dog, infinitely preferred that of the dog.\r\n'Above all,' he said, 'it did not talk.'\"[7] There were no babies in the\r\nNightingale family after the arrival of Florence herself, but most of\r\nher mother's many brothers and sisters married and had families; and as\r\nMr. and Mrs. Nightingale's houses were often visited by these relations,\r\nthere was seldom wanting a succession of babies, and in them and their\r\nchristenings, and teethings, and illnesses, and lessons, Florence took\r\nthat interest which is often strong in little girls.\r\n\r\n  [7] _Notes on Nursing_, ed. 1860, p. 147 _n._\r\n\r\nSometimes a baby died, and her letters show that Florence was as much\r\ninterested in a death as in a birth. She rejoiced in \"the little angels\r\nin heaven.\" One of her favourite poems at this period was _The Better\r\nLand_ of Mrs. Hemans, which she copied out for a cousin as \"so very\r\nbeautiful.\" The earliest letter which I have seen, written when she was\r\nten, strikes mingled notes. She is staying with Uncle Octavius Smith at\r\n\"Thames Bank\" (a house which then adjoined his distillery at Millbank),\r\nand writes to her sister, who is on a visit with the maid to another set\r\nof cousins:--\r\n\r\n     Give my love to Clémence, and tell her, if you please, that I am\r\n     not in the room where she established me, but in a very small one;\r\n     instead of the beautiful view of the Thames, a most dismal one of\r\n     the black distillery, and, whenever I open my window, the nasty\r\n     smell rushes in like a torrent. But I like it pretty well\r\n     notwithstanding. There is a hole through the wall close to my\r\n     door, which communicates with the bath-room, which is next the room\r\n     where Freddy[8] sleeps, and he talks to me by there. Tell her also,\r\n     if you please, that I have washed myself all over and feet in warm\r\n     water since I came every night. I went up into the distillery to\r\n     the very tip-top by ladders with Uncle Oc and Fred Saturday night.\r\n     We walked along a great pipe. We have had a good deal of boating\r\n     which I like very much. We see three steam-boats pass every day,\r\n     the _Diana_, the _Fly_, and the _Endeavour_. My love to all of them\r\n     except Miss W----. Give my love particularly to Hilary. Your affect\r\n     and only sister. Dear Pop, I think of you, pray let us love one\r\n     another more than we have done. Mama wishes it particularly, it is\r\n     the will of God, and it will comfort us in our trials through life.\r\n     Good-bye.\r\n\r\n  [8] Freddy, who was a bright, promising boy, went with Sir George Grey\r\n      on his journey of exploration in Australia, and there died of\r\n      starvation. In Rees's _Life of Sir George Grey_ a note was made, by\r\n      Sir George's desire, as to his having \"met the death of a martyr in\r\n      the cause of science and discovery, led on by personal friendship and\r\n      affection for Sir George himself.\"\r\n\r\nWas Miss W---- an unsympathetic governess? Whoever she was, the\r\nexception in her disfavour shows an unregenerate impulse which contrasts\r\nnaïvely with the following good resolve towards her sister. To a year\r\nearlier belongs a little note-book, entitled \"Journal of Flo, Embley.\"\r\nIt begins with the reminder, \"The Lord is with thee wherever thou art.\"\r\nAnd then an entry records, \"Sunday, I obliged to sit still by Miss\r\nChristie till I had the spirit of obedience.\" As a child, and throughout\r\nall the earlier part of her life, Florence was much given to dreaming,\r\nand in some introspective speculations written in 1851 she recalled the\r\npleasures of naughtiness. \"When I was a child and was naughty, it always\r\nput an end to my dreaming for the time. I never could tell why. Was it\r\nbecause naughtiness was a more interesting state than the little motives\r\nwhich make man's peaceful civilized state, and occupied imagination for\r\nthe time?\" To Miss Christie, her first governess, Florence became\r\ngreatly attached, and the death of the lady a few years later threw her\r\ninto deep grief. She was a sensitive, and a somewhat morbid child; and\r\nthough she presently developed a lively sense of humour, to which she\r\nhad the capacity of giving trenchant expression, it was the humour of\r\nintellect rather than the outcome of a joyous disposition. Her early\r\nletters contain little note of childish fun. They are for the most part\r\ngrave and introspective. She was self-absorbed, and had the shyness\r\nwhich attends upon that habit. \"My greatest ambition,\" she wrote in some\r\nprivate reminiscences of her early life, \"was not to be remarked. I was\r\nalways in mortal fear of doing something unlike other people, and I\r\nsaid, 'If I were sure that nobody would remark me I should be quite\r\nhappy.' I had a morbid terror of not using my knives and forks like\r\nother people when I should come out. I was afraid of speaking to\r\nchildren because I was sure I should not please them.\" Meanwhile, she\r\nwas perhaps at times, even as a child, a little \"difficult\" at home.\r\n\"Ask Flo,\" wrote her father to his wife in 1832, \"if she has lost her\r\nintellect. If not, why does she grumble at troubles which she cannot\r\nremedy by grumbling?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThe appeal to his daughter's intellect was characteristic of Mr.\r\nNightingale. He was himself a well-informed man, educated at Edinburgh,\r\nand Trinity, Cambridge; and, like some others of the Unitarian circle,\r\nhe held views much in advance of the average opinion of his time about\r\nthe intellectual education of women. The home education of his daughters\r\nwas largely supervised by himself; it included a range of subjects far\r\noutside the curriculum current in \"young ladies' seminaries\"; and\r\nperhaps, like Hannah More's father, he was sometimes \"frightened at his\r\nown success.\" Letters and note-books show, it is true, that his\r\ndaughters were duly instructed in the accomplishments deemed appropriate\r\nto young ladies. We hear of them learning the use of the globes, writing\r\nbooks of elegant extracts, working footstools, and doing fancy work.\r\nThey studied music, grammar, composition, modern languages. \"We used to\r\nread Tasso and Ariosto and Alfieri with my father,\" Florence said; \"he\r\nwas a good and always interested Italian scholar, never pedantic, never\r\na tiresome grammarian, but he spoke Italian like an Italian and I took\r\ncare of the verbs.\" Mr. Nightingale added constitutional history, Latin,\r\nGreek, and mathematics. By the time Florence was sixteen, he was\r\nreading Homer with his daughters. Miss Nightingale used to say that at\r\nGreek her sister was the quicker scholar. Their father set them\r\nappointed tasks to prepare. Parthenope would trust largely to\r\nimprovisation or lucky shots. Florence was more laborious; and sometimes\r\nwould get up at four in the morning to prepare the lesson. Her knowledge\r\nof Latin was of some practical use in later years. In conversations with\r\nabbots and monks whom she met during her travels she sometimes found in\r\nLatin their only common tongue. Among Florence's papers were preserved\r\nmany sheets in her father's handwriting, containing the heads of\r\nadmirable outlines of the political history of England and of some\r\nforeign states. Her own note-books show that in her teens she had\r\nmastered the elements of Latin and Greek. She analysed the _Tusculan\r\nDisputations_. She translated portions of the _Phaedo_, the _Crito_ and\r\nthe _Apology_. She had studied Roman, German, Italian, and Turkish\r\nhistory. She had analysed Dugald Stewart's _Philosophy of the Human\r\nMind_. Her father was in the habit, too, of suggesting themes on which\r\nhis daughters were to write compositions. It was the system of the\r\nCollege Essay. \"Florence has now taken to mathematics,\" wrote her sister\r\nin 1840, \"and, like everything she undertakes, she is deep in them and\r\nworking very hard.\" The direction in which Florence Nightingale was to\r\nexercise the faculties thus trained was as yet hidden in the future; but\r\nto her father's guidance she was indebted for the mental grasp and power\r\nof intellectual concentration which were to distinguish her work in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is a natural temptation of biographers to give a formal unity to\r\ntheir subject by representing the child as in all things the father of\r\nthe man; to date the vocation of their hero or heroine very early in\r\nlife; to magnify some childish incident as prophetic of what is to come\r\nthereafter. Material is available for such treatment in the case of\r\nFlorence Nightingale. It has been recorded that she used to nurse and\r\nbandage the dolls which her elder sister damaged. Every book about the\r\nheroine of the Crimea contains, too, a tale of \"first aid to the\r\nwounded\" which Florence administered to Cap, the shepherd's collie, whom\r\nshe found with a broken leg on the downs near Embley. \"I wonder,\" wrote\r\nher \"old Pastor\"[9] to her in 1858, \"whether you remember how,\r\ntwenty-two years ago, you and I together averted the intended hanging of\r\npoor old Shepherd Smithers's dog, Cap. How many times I have told the\r\nstory since! I well recollect the pleasure which the saving of the life\r\nof a poor dog then gave to your young mind. I was delighted to witness\r\nit; it was to me not indeed an omen of what you were about to do and be\r\n(for of that I never dreamed), but it was an index of that kind and\r\nbenevolent disposition, of that I Cor. xiii. Charity, which has been at\r\nthe root of it.\" And it is certainly interesting and curious, if nothing\r\nmore, that the very earliest piece in the handwriting of Florence\r\nNightingale which has been preserved should be a medical prescription.\r\nIt is contained in a tiny book, about the size of a postage-stamp, which\r\nthe little girl stitched together and in which the instruction is\r\nwritten, in very childish letters, \"16 grains for an old woman, 11 for a\r\nyoung woman, and 7 for a child.\" But these things are after all but\r\ntrifles. Florence Nightingale is not the only little girl who has been\r\nfond of nursing sick dolls or mending them when broken. Other children\r\nhave tended wounded animals and had their pill-boxes and simples. Much,\r\ntoo, has been written about Florence's kindness as a child to her poorer\r\nneighbours. Her mother, both at Lea Hurst and at Embley, sometimes\r\noccupied herself in good works. She and her husband were particularly\r\ninterested in a \"cheap school\" which they supported at their Derbyshire\r\nhome. \"Large sums of money have been paid,\" wrote Mr. Nightingale to his\r\nwife in 1832, \"to your schoolmistress for many praiseworthy purposes,\r\nwho works _con amore_ in looking after the whole population, young and\r\nold.\" Florence took her place, beside her mother, in visiting poor\r\nneighbours, in arranging school-treats, in giving village\r\nentertainments. But thousands of other squires' daughters, before and\r\nafter her, have done the like. And Florence herself, as many entries in\r\nher diaries show, was not conscious of doing much, but reproachful of\r\nherself for doing little. The constant burden of her self-examination,\r\nboth at this time and for many years to come, was that she was for ever\r\n\"dreaming\" and never \"doing.\" She was dreaming because for a long time\r\nshe did not clearly feel or see what her work in life was to be; and\r\nthen for yet another period of time because, when she knew what she was\r\ncalled to do, she could not compass the means to do it. Her faculties\r\nwere not brought outwards, but were left, by the conditions of her life,\r\nto devour themselves inwardly.\r\n\r\n  [9] The Rev. J. T. Giffard.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of her true vocation belongs, then, to a later period of\r\nour story; and it was not the result of childish fancy, or the\r\naccomplishment of early incident; it was the fruit of long and earnest\r\nstudy. What did come to Florence Nightingale early in life--perhaps, as\r\none entry in her autobiographical notes suggests, as early as her sixth\r\nyear--was the sense of a \"call\"; of some appointed mission in life; of\r\nself-dedication to the service of God. \"I remember her,\" wrote Fanny\r\nAllen in 1857 to her niece Elizabeth Wedgwood, \"as a little girl of\r\nthree or four, then the girl of sixteen of high promise. When I look\r\nback on every time I saw her after her sixteenth year, I see that she\r\nwas ripening constantly for her work, and that her mind was dwelling on\r\nthe painful differences of man and man in this life, and on the traps\r\nthat a luxurious life laid for the affluent. A conversation on this\r\nsubject between the father and daughter made me laugh at the time, the\r\ncontrast was so striking; but now, as I remember it, it was the Divine\r\nSpirit breathing in her.\"[10] In an autobiographical fragment written in\r\n1867 Florence mentions as one of the crises of her inner life that \"God\r\ncalled her to His service\" on February 7, 1837, at Embley; and there are\r\nlater notes which still fix that day as the dawn of her true life. But\r\nas yet she knew not whither the Spirit was to lead. For three months,\r\nindeed, as she notes in another passage of retrospect, she \"worked very\r\nhard among the poor people\" under \"a strong feeling of religion.\"\r\n\r\n  [10] _A Century of Family Letters_, vol. ii. p. 174.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nPresently, however, a new direction was given to her thoughts and\r\ninterests. She was now seventeen, her sister eighteen. Their home\r\neducation had been far advanced, and might seem to require only such\r\n\"finishing\" as masters and society in France and Italy could supply. Mr.\r\nNightingale had, moreover, decided to carry out extensive alterations\r\nat Embley. With his wife and daughters, he crossed from Southampton to\r\nHavre on September 8, 1837, and they did not return to England till\r\nApril 6, 1839. Those were days of leisurely travel, such as Ruskin\r\ndescribes, in which \"distance could not be vanquished without toil, but\r\nin which that toil was rewarded, partly by the power of deliberate\r\nsurvey of the countries through which the journey lay, and partly by the\r\nhappiness of the evening hours, when from the top of the last hill he\r\nhad surmounted, the traveller beheld the quiet village where he was to\r\nrest, scattered among the meadows beside its valley stream; or, from the\r\nlong-hoped-for turn in the dusty perspective of the causeway, saw, for\r\nthe first time, the towers of some famed city, faint in the rays of\r\nsunset--hours of peaceful and thoughtful pleasure, for which the rush of\r\nthe arrival in the railway station is perhaps not always, or to all men,\r\nan equivalent.\" There were many such hours during the journeys which the\r\nNightingales took with a _vetturino_ through France and Italy; and\r\nFlorence, writing at a later date, when all her life was fixed on doing,\r\nnoted that on this tour there was \"too much time for dreaming.\" Yet it\r\nis clear from her diaries that she entered heartily, and with a wider\r\nrange of interest than some English travellers show, into the life of\r\nforeign society and sight-seeing. A love of statistical method which\r\nbecame one of her most marked characteristics may already be seen in an\r\nitinerary which she compiled; noting, in its several columns, the number\r\nof leagues from place to place, with the day and the hour both of\r\narrival and of departure. They went leisurely through France, visiting,\r\nbesides many other places, Chartres, Blois, Tours, Nantes, Bordeaux,\r\nBiarritz, Carcassonne, Nîmes, Avignon, and Toulon, and then going by the\r\nRiviera to Nice. There they stayed for nearly a month (Dec. 1837-Jan.\r\n1838). A month was next spent at Genoa, and two months were given to\r\nFlorence. The late spring and summer were devoted to travel in the\r\ncities of Northern Italy, among the lakes, and in Switzerland. They\r\nspent the month of September in Geneva, and reached Paris on October 8,\r\n1838. Miss Nightingale preserved her diary of the greater part of the\r\ntour, and it shows her keenly interested alike in scenery and in works\r\nof art. It contains also, what records of sentimental pilgrimages often\r\nlack, an admixture of notes and statistics upon the laws, the land\r\nsystems, the social conditions and benevolent institutions of the\r\nseveral states or cantons. Her interest in the politics of the day was\r\nkeen wherever she was; and the society of many refugees into which she\r\nwas thrown at Geneva gave her a particularly ardent sympathy with the\r\ncause of Italian freedom. The diary contains many biographical notes\r\nupon Italian patriots, whose adventures she heard related by their own\r\nlips. \"A stirring day,\" she wrote on September 12 (1838), \"the most\r\nstirring which we have ever lived.\" It was the day on which the news\r\nreached Geneva that the Emperor of Austria had declared an amnesty in\r\nItaly. The Nightingales attended an evening party at which the Italian\r\nrefugees assembled and the Imperial decree was read out amidst loud\r\njubilation; which, however, was afterwards abated when it turned out\r\nthat the \"general amnesty\" contained many conditions and some\r\nexceptions. The Nightingales had the entrée to all the learned society\r\nof Geneva. Florence records an evening spent with M. de Candolle, the\r\nfamous botanist; and the diary gives many glimpses of Sismondi, the\r\nhistorian, who was then living in his native city. He escorted the\r\nNightingale party up the Salève. They made that not very formidable\r\nascent first on donkeys and then \"in a sledge covered with straw and\r\ndrawn by four oxen.\" Florence was present on another occasion when \"all\r\nthe company gathered round Sismondi who, sitting on a table, gave us a\r\nlecture on Florentine history.\" The conscientious Florence made a full\r\nnote in her diary of the great man's discourse. \"All Sismondi's\r\npolitical economy,\" she also noted, \"seems to be founded on the\r\noverflowing kindness of his heart. He gives to old beggars on principle,\r\nto young from habit. At Pescia he had 300 beggars at his door on one\r\nmorning. He feeds the mice in his room while he is writing his\r\nhistories.\" Presently there was a new excitement in Geneva. \"What a\r\nstirring time we live in,\" Florence wrote on September 18; \"one day to\r\ndecide the fate of the Italians, to-morrow to decide the fate of\r\nSwitzerland.\" \"To-morrow\" was the day fixed for the meeting of the\r\nConseil Représentatif which was to take into consideration the demand\r\nof Louis Philippe for the expulsion of Louis Napoleon, the future\r\nEmperor. Many pages of Miss Nightingale's diary are given up to this\r\naffair. She analysed all the _pros_ and _cons_, and recorded day by day\r\nthe course of the debate. Sismondi thought that the refugee ought to be\r\nsurrendered--on principle because he was a pretender, in expediency\r\nbecause Geneva would be unable to withstand a French assault. He \"spoke\r\nfor an hour\" in this sense. The Genevois radicals, on the other hand,\r\nwhile entertaining no great love for the pretender, thought that, cost\r\nwhat it might, \"the sacred right of asylum\" should be maintained. And\r\nso the debate continued. The French Government began to move troops from\r\nLyons; the Genevois, to throw up fortifications. Whereupon Mr.\r\nNightingale, like many other English visitors, thought it time to take\r\nhis family across the frontier. Miss Nightingale's diary written _en\r\nroute_ to Paris shows her excitement to obtain news of the crisis. When\r\nshe learnt that it had been solved by Louis Napoleon being given a\r\npassport for England, she did not see that Louis Philippe had gained\r\nvery much; the pretender would be nearer, and not less dangerous, in\r\nLondon than in Geneva--a very just prediction. Not every girl of\r\neighteen, when taking her first tour abroad, shows so lively an interest\r\nin political affairs.\r\n\r\nPolitics and social observations mingle in the diary with artistic and\r\narchitectural notes. The city which seems most to have appealed to her\r\nimagination was not Florence; though she said that she \"would not have\r\nmissed it for anything,\" and, curiously, her sojourn in her birthplace\r\nwas the occasion of a characteristic incident. An English lady, who\r\nafterwards became Princess Reuss Köstritz, was staying in the same\r\nlodgings and fell ill, and Florence Nightingale volunteered to nurse\r\nher. But the city which she most admired was Genoa La Superba. She notes\r\nindeed the excessive indolence of the nobles and excessive poverty of\r\nthe people, but the palaces \"realized an Arabian Nights story\" for her.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Nightingale had many friends and brought many\r\nintroductions. In the various towns where they stayed they mixed in the\r\nbest society, and their daughters were thrown into a lively round of\r\npicnics, concerts, soirées, dancing:\r\n\r\n     Balls and masks begun at midnight, burning ever to mid-day,\r\n     When they made up fresh adventures for the morrow--\r\n\r\nThere were Court balls at which Grand Dukes were \"exceedingly polite\" to\r\nFlorence Nightingale and her sister. They went to an evening Court at\r\nFlorence, and found \"everyone most courteous and agreeable.\" There was a\r\nball at the Casino in Genoa, at which, writes Florence in her diary, \"my\r\npartner and I made an _embrouillement_, and a military officer came up\r\nwith a very angry face to challenge me for having refused him and then\r\nnot dancing.\" But the music was not all to the tune of \"A Toccata of\r\nGaluppi's.\" What gave Florence the greatest pleasure on this tour was\r\nthe Italian opera. In those days the reigning singers were Grisi,\r\nLablache, Rubini, and Tamburini. Florence Nightingale heard them all.\r\nHer Italian diary is nowhere so elaborate as in descriptions of the\r\noperas and in notes on the performers. She kept a separate book in which\r\nshe wrote tabulated details of all the performances. \"I should like to\r\ngo every night,\" she said in her diary; and for some time after her\r\nreturn from the Continent she was, as she wrote to Miss Clarke,\r\n\"music-mad.\" She took music-lessons at Florence, and in London studied\r\nunder German and Italian masters. She played and sang. It was as yet\r\nuncertain whether \"the call\"--to what, as yet also unknown--might not be\r\ndrowned in the tastes, interests, and pursuits which fill the life of\r\nother young ladies in her position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThe fascination of social life must have been brought vividly before her\r\nduring the winter (1838-39) which they spent in Paris, in apartments in\r\nthe Place Vendôme (No. 22). She was now introduced into the brilliant\r\ncircle of the last of the _salons_. Mary Clarke, afterwards Madame Mohl,\r\nwas by descent half Irish, half Scottish; by education and residence,\r\nalmost wholly French. \"A charming mixture,\" said Ampère of her, \"of\r\nFrench vivacity and English originality.\" Full at once of _esprit_ and\r\nof _espièglerie_, well read and artistic yet wholly devoid of pedantry,\r\nwithout regular beauty of feature, but alert and _piquante_, Mary Clarke\r\nhad gathered round her what Ticknor in 1837 had found the most\r\nintellectual circle in Paris. For seven years she and her mother lived\r\nin apartments in the Abbaye-au-Bois, adjoining those of Madame Récamier,\r\nand Mary was a daily visitor to the famous _salon_ during the reign of\r\nChateaubriand, whose closing years she did much to brighten and amuse.\r\nAt the time when the Nightingales arrived in Paris, Mrs. and Miss Clarke\r\nhad left the Abbaye-au-Bois and established themselves in those\r\napartments in the Rue du Bac which for nearly forty years were a haunt\r\nof all that was brilliant in the intellectual life of Paris. Mary Clarke\r\ntook most affectionately to the Nightingale family, who, with some of\r\ntheir connections, remained for long years among her closest friends.\r\nShe used to pay a yearly visit to Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale, either at\r\nEmbley or at Lea Hurst, generally staying three weeks or a month; and to\r\nher many of Florence's most interesting letters were, as we shall find,\r\naddressed. To her other and more superficial qualities, Mary Clarke\r\nadded great warmth of lasting affection for her intimate friends, and\r\nher sympathetic kindness to the Nightingale circle was unfailing. The\r\nattraction of Paris to Florence lay principally in its hospitals and\r\nnursing sisterhoods, but partly also in that it was the home of\r\n\"Clarkey,\" as they called her. And it was the same with other members of\r\nthe family. There is a letter from Lady Verney to Clarkey which\r\ndescribes how some one asked Mr. Nightingale, \"Are you going to Paris?\"\r\n\"Oh, no,\" he replied; \"Madame Mohl is ill.\" \"Then does Paris mean Madame\r\nMohl?\" \"Yes, certainly,\" he replied gravely. During the winter of\r\n1838-39 Miss Clarke, writes Lady Verney, was \"exceedingly kind to\r\nFlorence and me, two young girls full of all kinds of interests, which\r\nshe took the greatest pains to help. She made us acquainted with all her\r\nfriends, many and notable, among them Madame Récamier. I know now,\r\nbetter than then, what her influence must have been thus to introduce an\r\nEnglish family (two of them girls who, if French, would not have\r\nappeared in society) into that jealously guarded sanctuary, the most\r\nexclusive aristocratic and literary _salon_ in Paris. We were asked,\r\neven, to the reading by Chateaubriand, at the Abbaye-au-Bois, of his\r\n_Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe_, which he could not wait to put forth, as he\r\nhad intended when writing them, until after his death--desiring, it was\r\nsaid, to discount the praises which he expected, but hardly received.\r\nThis hearing was a favour eagerly sought for by the cream of the cream\r\nof Paris society at that time.\"[11] In Miss Clarke's own apartments, the\r\nNightingales met many distinguished men. The intimates who were always\r\nthere, and who assisted their hostess in making the tea, were MM.\r\nFauriel and Mohl--Claude Fauriel, versed in mediæval and Provençal lore,\r\na man exceedingly handsome, who had captivated Madame de Staël and other\r\nladies besides Mary Clarke in his friendships; and Julius Mohl, one of\r\nthe first Orientalists in Europe, a more ardent lover whom, after a\r\nprobation of eighteen years, Miss Clarke married in 1847. M. Mohl was\r\nonce asked by Queen Victoria why, loving Germany so much, he had given\r\nup his native country for France. \"Ma foi, madame,\" he replied, \"j'ètais\r\namoureux.\" With M. Mohl, no less than with his wife, Florence\r\nNightingale was on terms of affectionate friendship. Among the frequent\r\nvisitors whom she and her sister met at Miss Clarke's were Madame Tastu\r\n(the poetess), Élie de Beaumont (the geologist), Roulin (the traveller\r\nand naturalist), Cousin, Mignet, Guizot, Tocqueville, Barthélemy St.\r\nHilaire, and Thiers. The last-named was one of Miss Clarke's earliest\r\nadmirers; and many years later, after the Franco-German war, when Thiers\r\nwas at the head of affairs, Lady Verney heard M. Mohl say to his wife,\r\n\"Madame, why did you not marry M. Thiers instead of me, for now you\r\nwould have been Queen of France?\"\r\n\r\n  [11] _Julius and Mary Mohl_, p. 29.\r\n\r\nIn such circles as that which gathered around Miss Clarke, Florence\r\nNightingale was well qualified to hold her own and even to play a\r\nbrilliant part. Her life of gaiety on the Riviera and in Italy must have\r\nrubbed away much of the shyness from which she had suffered. If not\r\nbeautiful, she was elegant and distinguished. She was both widely and\r\ndeeply read. She had many and varied interests. She had powers of\r\nexpression, in which clearness was not unmixed with a note of humorous\r\nsubacidity. These are social advantages, and she was not without the\r\ninclination to use them. She chose in the end another path--a path which\r\nwas beset by many obstacles of circumstance; but there were obstacles in\r\nherself also, and one of the last \"temptations\" to be overcome, before\r\nshe was free to interpret her call and to act upon it, was (as she wrote\r\nin many a page of confession and self-examination) \"the desire to shine\r\nin society.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                                 HOME LIFE\r\n\r\n                                (1839-1845)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Her passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were\r\n     many-volumed romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a\r\n     brilliant girl to her? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel;\r\n     and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction,\r\n     some object which would never justify weariness, which would\r\n     reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life\r\n     beyond self.--GEORGE ELIOT: _Middlemarch_.\r\n\r\nThe home life to which Florence Nightingale returned in April 1839 was\r\nrich in possibilities of social pleasure, and might have seemed to\r\npromise every happiness. She was well fitted by nature and by education\r\nto be an ornament of any country house; to shine in any cultivated\r\nsociety; to become the wife, as many of her best friends hoped and\r\nbelieved, of some good and clever man. But Florence, as she passed from\r\nchildhood to womanhood, came to form other plans. Her life, as she\r\nultimately shaped it, her example, which circumstances were destined to\r\nrender far-shining, have been potent factors in opening new avenues for\r\nwomen in the modern world. Thousands of women in these days are, in\r\nconsequence of Florence Nightingale's career, born free; but it was at a\r\ngreat price, and after long and weary struggles, that she herself\r\nattained such freedom. During the years with which, in this Part, we\r\nshall be concerned, she lived in some sort the life of a caged bird.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cage, however, was pleasantly gilded. Florence was not always\r\ninsensible of the gilding; there were times when she was tempted to\r\nchafe no longer at its bars, and to accept a restricted life within the\r\nconventional lines. I do not propose to detail, as might be done from\r\nher letters, diaries, and other materials, the precise succession of her\r\ngoings and comings, her visits, and her home pursuits. She herself gives\r\nan excellent reason in one of her diaries. \"Our movements are so\r\nregular,\" she said; one year was very like another. The setting of\r\nFlorence Nightingale's life during this period was such as many women\r\nhave enjoyed, and many others have envied. The lines of the Nightingale\r\nfamily were laid in pleasant places. Their summer months were spent, as\r\nin preceding years, at Lea Hurst. A portion of the season was spent in\r\nLondon, and the rest of the year at Embley. On their return from the\r\nContinent in 1839, the Nightingales spent some weeks in London, when the\r\ntwo girls were presented at Court, and a letter to Miss Clarke shows\r\nFlorence absorbed in music, but not so completely as to conquer a lively\r\ninterest in the politics of the Bedchamber Plot:--\r\n\r\n     CARLTON HOTEL, REGENT STREET, _June_ 1 [1839].... We are enjoying\r\n     ourselves much, for the Nicholsons, our cousins, came up to town\r\n     the day after we did, and are living in the same hotel with us in\r\n     Regent Street, the best situation in London, I think, but some\r\n     people call it too noisy. As Marianne Nicholson is as music-mad as\r\n     I am, we are revelling in music all day long. Schulz, who is a\r\n     splendid player, and Crivelli, her singing master, give us lessons,\r\n     and the unfortunate piano has been strummed out of tune in a week,\r\n     not having even its natural rest at nights, as there are other\r\n     masters as well. We went to Pauline Garcia's début at the opera in\r\n     _Otello_. She was exceedingly nervous and trembled all over, but\r\n     her great improvement towards the end promised well. Her lower\r\n     notes are very fine indeed, and two shakes she made low down,\r\n     though too much like _instrumental_ to be agreeable, were very\r\n     extraordinary. Her voice, however, is excessively unequal, and\r\n     sometimes her singing is quite commonplace. She makes too much of\r\n     her execution, which is very uneven. It is very easy to say that\r\n     she will be another Malibran, but if they were side by side the\r\n     difference would be seen; so say wiser judges than we. Even Grisi\r\n     is quite superior to her in Desdemona, although P. Garcia's voice\r\n     is the most powerful, but then P. Garcia was excessively\r\n     frightened. We have heard her sing a duet with Persiani in which\r\n     both were perfect, and I heard Dohler for the first time at the\r\n     same concert. I was nowise disappointed, although I had heard so\r\n     much of him at Paris, his execution is extraordinary, but I think\r\n     one would soon grow tired of it, for both his music and his style\r\n     are very inferior to Thalberg's. Have you heard Batta on the\r\n     violoncello at Paris? His playing approaches more nearly to the\r\n     human voice than anything I ever heard. We are going to hear\r\n     charming Persiani to-night in the _Lucia di Lammermoor_. Tamburini,\r\n     the most good-natured of mortals, has volunteered to come and sing\r\n     two or three hours with my cousin Marianne every season, whenever\r\n     she thinks herself sufficiently advanced. We are going to hear him\r\n     at a private concert on Monday.\r\n\r\n     Now there has been enough and too much of musical news, but\r\n     political news is scarce.... London was in a perfect whirlwind of\r\n     excitement for the few days that the Melbourne ministry was out,\r\n     but that is stale already. Our little Queen, who was sadly\r\n     unpopular when we first came to England, recovered much of her\r\n     former favour with the Whig party after the firmness she showed in\r\n     this affair. She was cheered and called forward at the opera, which\r\n     had not been done for months, and again returning from chapel. And\r\n     the birthday drawing-room was overflowing, whereas at the two first\r\n     she gave this season, there were hardly _forty_ people! The story\r\n     of this last fracas is that on Tuesday, the day of Lord Melbourne's\r\n     resignation, the Queen dined upstairs with her mother, Baroness\r\n     Lehzen, and Lady F. Hastings, which she had never done since her\r\n     accession, and it is supposed that the _amende honorable_ was then\r\n     made to Lady Flora, and that in this _partie carrée_ was also\r\n     arranged the course which was to be pursued with Sir Robert Peel.\r\n     The poor little Queen was seen in tears by several people who told\r\n     us in the course of the three days, and struggled for her Ladies,\r\n     as you see, manfully. However matters may turn out now, it is said\r\n     that she has taken so tremendous a dislike to Sir R. Peel in this\r\n     affair, that she will never send for _him_ again.\r\n\r\n     Since that, the House has been adjourned for a fortnight and only\r\n     met last Monday when the Speaker was elected, Abercromby going up\r\n     to the House of Peers. We are rejoicing in the election of Shaw\r\n     Lefevre, by a majority of eighteen; rather less than was expected,\r\n     however, Spring Rice arriving half an hour too late to vote, which\r\n     has made rather a commotion. Shaw Lefevre is a great friend of\r\n     ours, and a very agreeable man, which is his chief qualification\r\n     for the chair. Macaulay is not likely to come into the Ministry;\r\n     Lord Melbourne says that it is impossible to get on with a man who\r\n     talks so fast. So he is now writing history, and saying that it is\r\n     the only thing worth doing, except, however, standing for Edinburgh\r\n     in Abercromby's room against Crawford. Macaulay has made an\r\n     admirable speech in favour of ballot there.\r\n\r\n     The Queen is vibrating between popularity and unpopularity, and it\r\n     is not yet known which way the scale will turn between the two\r\n     parties; she was very much applauded, and Lord Melbourne too, at\r\n     Ascot yesterday. He is likely to keep the upper hand, as the Tories\r\n     have not such a man as Lord John Russell in all their party, and\r\n     the _nine_ obstreperous Radicals have had a sop and give in their\r\n     adhesion for the present. Papa is shocked to hear that M. Guizot\r\n     has declared himself so anti-English....\r\n\r\n     We always talk of you and all that you did for us at Paris. I heard\r\n     yesterday that Gonfalonieri was coming to London in a month. Is he\r\n     at Paris now? I have just been reading the account of M. Mignet's\r\n     _éloge_ of Talleyrand. I hope you were there, for it must have been\r\n     very interesting, but did not he make rather an extraordinary\r\n     defence of Talleyrand's political tergiversation, and of his\r\n     conduct while the Allies were at Paris? extraordinary to our ideas of\r\n     political integrity. We met \"ubiquity\" Young and Mr. Babbage yesterday\r\n     at dinner at the E. Strutts', who told all sorts of droll stories\r\n     about Lord Brougham, who seems to have fairly lost his wits. He had\r\n     Lord Duncannon to dine with him the other day, which is new, he having\r\n     formerly stipulated when he went out to dinner that he should see none\r\n     of his former colleagues. He sends his carriage to stand before Lord\r\n     Denman's house for hours while he goes and walks in the Park, or\r\n     even while he is out of town, to give the idea that they are very\r\n     intimate....\r\n\r\nIn another letter to Miss Clarke (Sept. 18), some further gossip is\r\ngiven. Miss Nightingale was on her way back to London from Lea Hurst,\r\nand had broken the journey at Nottingham:--\r\n\r\n     The next day we went up to town by rail in six and a half hours,\r\n     notwithstanding that the engine was twice out of order and stopped\r\n     us. We had very agreeable company on the road, a neighbour of ours\r\n     and equerry to the Queen,[12] who was full of her virtues and\r\n     condescensions. How much pleasanter it is travelling by these\r\n     public conveyances than in one's own stupid carriage. He said that\r\n     Lord Melbourne called the Queen's favourite terrier a frightful\r\n     little beast, and often contradicted her flat, all which she takes\r\n     in good part, and lets him go to sleep after dinner, taking care\r\n     that he shall not be waked.[13] She reads all the newspapers and\r\n     all the vilifying abuse which the Tories give her, and makes up her\r\n     mind that a queen must be abused, and hates them cordially.\r\n\r\n  [12] General Sir Frederick Stovin, G.C.B. He was groom-in-waiting to\r\n       Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1860.\r\n\r\n  [13] Many stories of Lord Melbourne and the \"dull dog\" are now accessible\r\n       in the Queen's own diaries, but he made friends with the pets in the\r\n       end. The Queen may have forbidden others to wake her Minister; but\r\n       she herself objected sometimes, though with a pretty playfulness, to\r\n       his snoring. See _The Girlhood of Queen Victoria_, vol. ii. p. 240.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe Nightingales had taken up their residence at Embley in September\r\n1839, and remained there, in accordance with their wont, till the early\r\nsummer following. The charm of the place is vividly described in a\r\nletter from Florence's sister to her cousin, Miss Hilary Bonham\r\nCarter:--\r\n\r\n     MY LOVE--It is so beautiful in this world! so very beautiful, you\r\n     really cannot fancy anything so near approaching to Eden or\r\n     fairy-land, or _il paradiso terrestre_ as depicted in the 25th\r\n     Canto, stanza 40 something; so very, very lovely that we cannot\r\n     resist a very strong desire that you should come down and see it.\r\n     My dear, I assure you we are worth seeing. I never, though blest\r\n     with many fair visions (both in my sleeping and my waking hours),\r\n     conceived anything so exquisite as to-day lying among the flowers,\r\n     such smells and such sounds hovering round me! Flo reading and\r\n     talking so that my immortal profited too, and she comforted me when\r\n     I said I must have much of the beast in me to be so _very_ happy in\r\n     the sunshine and the flowers, by suggesting that God gave us His\r\n     blessings to enjoy them. So I _am_ comforted, and set to work to\r\n     enjoy with all my might, and succeed _à merveille_. Still the\r\n     garden is big, there are many clumps of rhododendrons and azaleas,\r\n     and showers of rosebuds, and I cannot be all round them at once; so\r\n     we want you to come and help, not so much for your pleasure as to\r\n     relieve the weight of responsibility, you see.... My love, I am\r\n     writing perched on a chair on the grass, nightingales all round,\r\n     blue sky above (_such_ long shadows sleeping on the lawn), and June\r\n     smells about me. Will you not come? The rhododendrons are early\r\n     this year, and will be much passed in another ten days. Will you\r\n     not come? If you ask learned men they will tell you June at Embley\r\n     is a poetry ready made; and the first thing I shall do when I get\r\n     to heaven (you'd better set about getting there Miss Pop directly,\r\n     you're a _very_ long way off at these presents), where I expect to\r\n     have the gift of language, is to celebrate the pomps and beauties\r\n     of the garden in this wicked world, than which I never wish for a\r\n     better.\r\n\r\nFlorence and her sister loved each other, but their characters were\r\nwidely different, as we shall hear, and their love at this time was not\r\nthat of perfect sympathy, but rather of wistful admiration on the one\r\nside, and half-pitying fondness on the other. Parthenope looked upon\r\nFlorence as upon some strange being in another world, whose happiness\r\nshe passionately longed to see, and whose rejection of it she could but\r\ndimly understand. Florence, on her side, regarded her elder sister's\r\ncontentment in the beauties of art and nature, and in the world as she\r\nfound it, with the tender pity which one may feel for a happy child. \"It\r\nwould be an ill return for all her affection,\" wrote Florence to one of\r\nher aunts, \"to drag down my White Swan from her cool, fresh, blue sea of\r\nart into our baby chicken-yard of struggling, scratting[14] life. How\r\ncruel it would be, as she is rocked to rest there on her dreamy waves,\r\nfor anybody to waken her.\" The difference in temperament between the\r\nsisters comes out very clearly in their several descriptions of Embley.\r\nFlorence was sensible of its beauties, but they came to her with\r\nthoughts of a better world beyond, or with echoes from the still sad\r\nmusic of humanity in the world that now is. \"I should have so liked you\r\nto see Embley in the summer,\" she wrote,[15] \"for everything is such a\r\nblaze of beauty. I had such a lovely walk yesterday before breakfast.\r\nThe voice of the birds is like the angels calling me with their songs,\r\nand the fleecy clouds look like the white walls of our Home. Nothing\r\nmakes my heart thrill like the voice of the birds; but the living chorus\r\nso seldom finds a second voice in the starved and earthly soul, which,\r\nlike the withered arm, cannot stretch forth its hand till Christ bids\r\nit.\" A very different note, it will be observed, from that which\r\nParthenope--and Pippa--heard from \"the lark on the wing.\" And so, too,\r\nwith regard to the house at Embley. Mr. Nightingale had found it a\r\nplain, substantial building of the Georgian period. He enlarged it into\r\nan ornate mansion in the Elizabethan style. His wife and elder daughter\r\nwere much occupied with the interest of furnishing it appropriately, and\r\nMr. Nightingale was greatly pleased with his alterations. \"Do you know,\"\r\nsaid Florence, as she walked with an American friend on the lawn in\r\nfront of the drawing-room, \"what I always think when I look at that row\r\nof windows? I think how I should turn it into a hospital, and just how I\r\nshould place the beds.\"[16]\r\n\r\n  [14] An expressive, old English word, which often occurs in Miss\r\n       Nightingale's letters. \"As we say in Derbyshire,\" she sometimes\r\n       added. George Eliot, also of Derbyshire, often uses it.\r\n\r\n  [15] Miss Nightingale took great pains with most of her letters. She\r\n       often made a rough draft in a note-book, and then used the same\r\n       words in letters to different correspondents, or used part of the\r\n       original passage in a letter to one correspondent, and part in a\r\n       letter to another. Here, as in one or two other cases, I reunite\r\n       passages from two letters. One of them was addressed to the same\r\n       cousin to whom Parthenope wrote.\r\n\r\n  [16] Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell's _Pioneer Work_, 1895, p. 185.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nEmbley was now a large house, with accommodation enough to receive at\r\none time, as Florence recorded in a letter, \"five able-bodied married\r\nfemales, with their husbands and belongings.\" The large number of Mr.\r\nNightingale's brothers and sisters, some of whom had many sons and\r\ndaughters, made the family circle of the Nightingales a very wide one.\r\nBetween four of the families the intercourse was particularly close--the\r\nNightingales, the Nicholsons, the Bonham Carters, and the Samuel Smiths.\r\nOne of Mrs. Nightingale's sisters married Mr. George Thomas Nicholson,\r\nof Waverley Abbey, near Farnham, Surrey.[17] Among their children,\r\nMarianne was as a girl a great friend of her cousin Florence. In 1851\r\nMiss Nicholson married Captain (afterwards Sir) Douglas Galton, who,\r\nsome few years later, became closely and helpfully connected with Miss\r\nNightingale's work. To Mr. Nicholson's sister, \"Aunt Hannah,\" Florence\r\nwas greatly attached. Another of Mrs. Nightingale's sisters married Mr.\r\nJohn Bonham Carter, of Ditcham, near Petersfield, for many years M.P.\r\nfor Portsmouth. His eldest daughter, Joanna Hilary, was a particular\r\nfriend of Florence Nightingale, who said that of all her contemporaries\r\nwithin her circle, her cousin Hilary was the most gifted. One of the\r\nsons, Mr. Henry Bonham Carter, was, and is, Secretary of the Nightingale\r\nFund, and Miss Nightingale appointed him one of her executors. Between\r\nthe Nightingales and the Samuel Smiths the relationship was double. Mrs.\r\nNightingale's brother, Mr. Samuel Smith, of Combe Hurst, Surrey, married\r\nMary Shore, sister of Mr. Nightingale; moreover, their son, Mr. William\r\nShore Smith, was the heir (after his mother) to the entailed land at\r\nEmbley and Lea Hurst, in default of a son to Mr. Nightingale. The eldest\r\nchild of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Smith, Blanche, married Arthur Hugh Clough,\r\nthe poet, who, as we shall hear, was closely associated with Miss\r\nNightingale. There were many other relations; but without being troubled\r\nto go into further details, which might tax severely even the authoress\r\nof the _Pillars of the House_, the reader will perceive that Florence\r\nNightingale was well provided with uncles, aunts, and cousins.\r\n\r\n  [17] The annals of the Cistercian Abbey (of which ruins remain) are said\r\n       to have suggested to Sir Walter Scott the name of his first novel.\r\n\r\nThe fact is of some significance in understanding the circumstances of\r\nher life at this time, and the nature of her struggle for independence.\r\nEmancipated or revolting daughters are sometimes pardoned or condoned if\r\nthey can aver that they have few home ties. To Mrs. Nightingale it may\r\nhave seemed that in the domestic intercourse within so large a family\r\ncircle, any comfortable daughter might find abundance of outlet and\r\ninterest. And so, in one respect at least, her daughter Florence did.\r\nThe maternal instinct in her, for which she was not in her own person to\r\nfind fruition, went out in almost passionate fullness to the young\r\ncousin, William Shore Smith, mentioned above. He was \"her boy,\" she used\r\nto say, from the day on which he was put as a baby into her arms when\r\nshe was eleven years old. Up to the time of his going up to Cambridge,\r\nhe spent a portion of his holidays in every year at Lea Hurst or Embley.\r\nFlorence's letters at such times were full of him. She was successively\r\nhis nurse, playfellow, and tutor. \"The son of my heart,\" she called him;\r\n\"while he is with me all that is mine is his, my head and hands and\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nIt generally happens in any large family circle that there is one woman\r\nto whom all its members instinctively turn when trouble comes or help\r\nis needed. Florence was the one in the Nightingale circle who filled\r\nthis rôle of Sister of Mercy or Emergency Man--taking charge of one\r\nhousehold when an aunt was away, or being dispatched to another when\r\nillness was prevalent. In 1845 she spent some time with her father's\r\nmother, who was threatened with paralysis, and whom she nursed into\r\npartial recovery. \"I am very glad sometimes,\" she wrote from her\r\ngrandmother's sick-room to her cousin Hilary, \"to walk in the valley of\r\nthe shadow of death as I do here; there is something in the stillness\r\nand silence of it which levels all earthly troubles. God tempers our\r\nwings in the waters of that valley, and I have not been so happy or so\r\nthankful for a long time. And yet it is curious, in the last years of\r\nlife, that we should go down-hill in order to climb up the other side;\r\nthat in the struggle of the spiritual with the material part of the\r\nuniverse, the material should get the better, and the soul, just at the\r\nmoment of becoming spiritualised for ever, should seem to become more\r\nmaterialised.\" She made a similar reflection a little later in the same\r\nyear (1845), when tending her old nurse, Gale, in her last illness. \"The\r\nold lady's spirit,\" she wrote, \"was in her pillow-cases, and one night\r\nwhen she thought she was dying, and I was sitting up with her, she said,\r\n'Now, Miss Florence, mind you have two new cases made for this bed, for\r\nI think whoever sleeps here next year will find them comfortable.'\" The\r\ndeath-bed of the nurse of the Queen of Nurses deserves some note. The\r\nlast words of Mrs. Gale, as reported in other letters, were, \"Don't wake\r\nthe cook,\" \"Hannah, go to your work,\" and \"Miss Florence, be careful in\r\ngoing down those stairs.\" If the spirit of this old servant was\r\nmaterialised at the moment of passing, the materialising took the form\r\nat any rate of faithful service and of consideration for others.\r\n\r\nFlorence's sympathy with those in distress is shown in the letter of\r\ncondolence which she wrote to Miss Clarke upon the death of M.\r\nFauriel:--\r\n\r\n     EMBLEY, _July_ 1844. I cannot help writing one word, my dear Miss\r\n     Clarke, after having just received your note, though I know I\r\n     cannot say anything which can be of any comfort. For there are few\r\n     sorrows I do believe like your sorrow, and few people so necessary\r\n     to another's happiness of every instant, as he was to yours.... How\r\n     sorry I am, dear Miss Clarke, that you will not think of coming to\r\n     us here. Oh, do not say that you \"will not cloud young people's\r\n     spirits.\" Do you think young people are so afraid of sorrow, or\r\n     that if they have lively spirits, which I often doubt, they think\r\n     these are worth anything, except in so far as they can be put at\r\n     the service of sorrow, not to relieve it, which I believe can very\r\n     seldom be done, but to sympathise with it? I am sure this is the\r\n     only thing worth living for, and I do so believe that every tear\r\n     one sheds waters some good thing into life.... Dear Miss Clarke, I\r\n     wish we had you here, or at least could see you and pour out\r\n     something of what our hearts are full of. That clever man of\r\n     Thebes, one Cadmus, need never have existed, for any good that that\r\n     cold pen and ink of his ever did, in the way of expressing oneself.\r\n     The iron pen seems to make the words iron, but words are what\r\n     always takes the dust off the butterfly's wings.... What nights we\r\n     have had this last month, though when one thinks that there are\r\n     hundreds and thousands of people suffering in the same way, and\r\n     when one sees in every cottage some trouble which defies\r\n     sympathy--and there is all the world putting on its shoes and\r\n     stockings every morning all the same--and the wandering earth going\r\n     its inexorable tread-mill through those cold-hearted stars in the\r\n     eternal silence, as if nothing were the matter;--death seems less\r\n     dreary than life at that rate. But I did not mean to say that, for\r\n     who would know the peace of night, if it were not for the troubles\r\n     of the day, \"the welcome, the thrice-prayed-for, the most fair, the\r\n     best beloved night,\" when one feels, what at other times one only\r\n     repeats to oneself, that the coffin of every hope is the cradle of\r\n     a good experience, and that nobody suffers in vain. It is odd what\r\n     want of faith one has for one's friends. _We_ know what soft lots\r\n     we would have made for them if we could; and that we should believe\r\n     ourselves so infinitely more good-natured than God, that we cannot\r\n     trust their lots with Him!\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that Florence was in request among the\r\nfamily circle only at times of sad emergency. She sometimes took her\r\nplace no less effectually on festive occasions. Waverley Abbey, the\r\nhouse of Uncle Nicholson aforesaid, was the scene of family reunions at\r\nChristmas-time; and in letters to Miss Clarke from both Mrs. Nightingale\r\nand her daughter Parthe, there is a lively account of private\r\ntheatricals there in 1841. The _Merchant of Venice_ was chosen, and\r\nMacready volunteered some assistance. Parthe's artistic gifts were\r\nrequisitioned, and she was \"scene-painter, milliner, and cap-and-fur\r\nmaker.\" The powers of command and organization, which Florence was\r\nafterwards to exhibit in another field, seem to have been divined by her\r\ncousins, for she was unanimously appointed stage-manager. Miss Joanna\r\nHorner, who was one of the party, remembers that the usual little\r\njealousies about parts and costumes used to disappear in presence of\r\nFlorence. \"Flo very blooming,\" reported Mrs. Nightingale. \"The actors\r\nwere not very obstinate, and were tolerably good-tempered,\" wrote\r\nParthe, \"but it was hard work for Flo. There was a Captain Elliot, fresh\r\nfrom China, who could by no means be brought to obey. He was Antonio,\r\nand _would_ burst out laughing in the midst of his most pathetic bits,\r\nto the horror of Shylock, who was very earnest and hard-working.\" The\r\nLady-in-Chief in later years in the Crimea had a rather peremptory way\r\nwith obstructive military gentlemen. On this occasion, however, she was\r\nperhaps satisfied with the assurance given at a well-known pantomime\r\nrehearsal, that it would \"be all right on the night.\" But it was not.\r\n\"Your flame, Uncle Adams,\"[18] continues the letter to Miss Clarke, \"was\r\nvery fine in Lancelot! but, oh, desperation, forgot his Duke's part in\r\nthe most flagrant way, tho' Flo had been putting it into him with a\r\nsledge-hammer all the week.\" In the intervals of rehearsing, the girls\r\nand their cousins danced and sang, and took large walks, sixteen\r\ntogether. After the performance, dancing was kept up till five in the\r\nmorning. \"Next day,\" continues Lady Verney, \"we were debating whether\r\n'Sing a Song of Sixpence' went on with a _bag_ or a _pocket_ full of\r\nrye; and warming on this interesting subject, we young ones dragged in\r\nall the old people, sought recruits high and low, and had a regular\r\nelection scene. Uncle Adams made a hustings speech, giving both parties\r\nhopes of his vote; then the boys slunk out after the counting, and came\r\nin with large outcries to be counted a second time, with many other\r\ncorrupt practices much used at such times; then we bribed a little boy\r\nto go and make disturbances in the other faction; but you will be happy\r\nto hear the _pockets_ had it by a large majority, and we beat the base\r\n_baggites_ out of the field. After the holloaing was over, and the\r\nalarming rushings and screamings we had made, M. Kroff (a Bohemian), who\r\nhad listened and assisted, came to Mama, and said, 'This do give me the\r\ngreat idea of the liberty of your land, your young people are brought up\r\nso to understand it in your domestic life; if _we_ were to make such a\r\nnoise we should have the police in with swords and cutlasses to divide\r\nus!'\"\r\n\r\n  [18] William Adams Smith, an unmarried brother of Mrs. Nightingale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThe Nightingales had as many friends without as within the family\r\ncircle. Their two homes brought them in touch with county society alike\r\nin Derbyshire and in Hampshire, and acquaintanceships made in London\r\nwere often ripened in the country, or _vice versa_. In Derbyshire their\r\nfriends included the Strutts, and Richard Monckton Milnes, who\r\nafterwards took a cordial interest in the Nightingale Fund. In London,\r\nFlorence and her sister went out a great deal, and saw all that was\r\ninteresting to well-educated young persons. A letter from Florence to\r\none of her aunts shows her occupied in politics, in literature, in\r\nastronomy, with something, perhaps, of the note of a blue; yet with her\r\nmind already set on a purpose in life:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss F. Nightingale to Miss Julia Smith._) _June_ 20 [1843]. A\r\n     cold east wind, _forty_-one days of rain in the last month! as our\r\n     newspaper informs us to prove that '43 is worse than any preceding\r\n     year. _Du reste_, the world very pleasant--people looking up in the\r\n     prospect of Peel's giving them free trade and all radical measures\r\n     in the course of one or two years. Carlyle's new _Past and\r\n     Present_, a beautiful book. There are bits about \"Work,\" which how\r\n     I should like to read with you! \"Blessed is he who has found his\r\n     work: let him ask no other blessedness. He has a work, a\r\n     life-purpose: he has found it and will follow it....\" Sir J. Graham\r\n     is going to be obliged to give up his Factories Education Bill for\r\n     this year; O ye bigoted Dissenters! but I am going to hold my\r\n     tongue and not \"meddle with politics\" or \"talk about things which I\r\n     don't understand,\" for I tremble already in anticipation, and\r\n     proceed at once to facts.... The two things we have done in London\r\n     this year--the most striking things--are seeing Bouffé in\r\n     Clermont, the blind painter (you have seen him, so I need not\r\n     descant on his entire difference from anybody else); and going\r\n     under Mr. Bethune to Sir James South's at Kensington,[19] where we\r\n     were from ten o'clock till three the next morning. Mr. Bethune is\r\n     certainly the most good-natured man in ancient or modern history.\r\n     You will fancy the first going out upon the lawn on that most\r\n     beautiful of nights, with the immense fellow slung in his frame\r\n     like a great steam-engine, and working as easily; and the mountains\r\n     of the moon striking out like bright points in the sky, and the\r\n     little stars resolving themselves into double and even quadruple\r\n     stars.... Those dialogues of Galileo are so beautiful. Mr. Bethune\r\n     lent them us to read in the real old _first_ edition.\r\n\r\n  [19] Sir James South, astronomer (1785-1867), had a famous observatory\r\n       on Campden Hill.\r\n\r\nAt Embley the Nightingales saw something of the Palmerstons and the\r\nAshburtons. With Miss Louisa Stewart Mackenzie, who afterwards became\r\nthe second wife of the second Lord Ashburton, Florence formed a\r\nfriendship which was one of the solaces and supports of her life at this\r\ntime. Other friends who played a yet larger part in her life were Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Bracebridge[20] of Atherstone, near Coventry. Florence sketches\r\nthe character of some of her friends in a letter to her cousin Hilary\r\n(April 1846):--\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Keith, Miss Dutton, and Louisa Mackenzie, may be shortly\r\n     described as the respective representatives of the Soul, the Mind,\r\n     and the Heart. The first has one's whole _worship_, the second\r\n     one's greatest _admiration_, and the third one's most lively\r\n     _interest_. Mrs. Bracebridge may be described as all three; the\r\n     Human Trinity in one; and never do I see her, without feeling that\r\n     she is eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. Many a plan, which\r\n     disappointment has thinned off into a phantom in my mind, takes\r\n     form and shape and fair reality when touched by her Ithuriel's\r\n     spear (for there is an Ithuriel's spear for good as well as for\r\n     evil).\r\n\r\n  [20] _Née_ Mills, cousin of Mr. Arthur Mills, M.P.\r\n\r\nDr. Richard Dawes, Dean of Hereford, who was an educational reformer,\r\nand Dr. Fowler of Salisbury, who anticipated the open-air treatment, and\r\nwas otherwise a man of marked originality, were among those whose\r\nfriendship she valued. If Florence Nightingale was to find her home\r\nlife empty and unprofitable, it was not for lack of congenial friends.\r\n\r\nShe saw much, too, of general society, and Embley was often the scene of\r\nentertaining. We get a glimpse of its parties from an invitation which\r\nMr. Nightingale sent to Miss Clarke (Oct. 1843) to bring her friend\r\nLeopold von Ranke with her on a visit:--\r\n\r\n     Pray send him a sly line to the effect that he will find\r\n     _Notabilities_ here on the 24th--to wit, the Speaker (Shaw\r\n     Lefevre), the ex-Foreign Secretary (Palmerston), the Catholic Weld\r\n     (future owner of Lulworth and nephew of the Cardinal of that ilk),\r\n     and mayhap a Queen's Equerry or two, a Baron of the Exchequer\r\n     (Rolfe), an Inspector, or rather Engineering Architect, of the new\r\n     prisons,[21] and a couple of Baronets. He should think well on\r\n     this. Yours, quizzically, but faithfully,             W. E. N.\r\n\r\n  [21] Sir Joshua Jebb, surveyor-general of prisons, designed the \"model\r\n       prison\" at Pentonville. Miss Nightingale valued his friendship\r\n       greatly, and appointed him a member of the Council of the\r\n       Nightingale Fund.\r\n\r\n\"Papa is quizzing the Baronets,\" added Florence, \"who are not wise ones.\r\nProvided you come, I care for nobody, no not I, and shall be quite\r\nsatisfied. As M. de Something said to the Staël, 'Nous aurons à nous\r\ndeux de l'esprit pour quarante; vous pour quatre et moi pour zéro.'\"\r\n\r\nThere were return invitations to great houses, and occasionally Florence\r\nretails their gossip, or her own reflections, for the benefit of cousins\r\nor aunts:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Hilary Bonham Carter._) 1845 (or early '46). What is the\r\n     secret of Lady Jocelyn's sublime placidity? I never saw anything so\r\n     lovely as she is, and she has lived four-and-twenty years of more\r\n     excitement, I suppose, than ever fell to anybody's lot but an\r\n     actress, all the young peerage having proposed to her. What gives\r\n     her such a fullness of life now and makes her find enough in herself?\r\n     It is not that she talks to Lord Palmerston or Lord Jocelyn, for she\r\n     never does; and though she is very fond of her baby, she told me\r\n     herself she did not care to play with it. Perhaps you will say it is\r\n     want of earnestness, but, good gracious, my dear, if earnestness\r\n     breaks one heart, who is fulfilling most the Creation's end--she who\r\n     is breaking her heart, or this woman who has kept her serenity in the\r\n     midst of excitement and her simplicity in unbounded admiration? The\r\n     Palmerstons are certainly the most good-natured people under the\r\n     stars to their guests.\r\n\r\n     We have been since to Sir William Heathcote's to meet the\r\n     Ashburtons. I wish you had been there for the sake of the pictures,\r\n     and also for the sake of the artistical dinner which, even I became\r\n     aware, was such a dinner and such plate as has seldom blessed my\r\n     housekeeping eyes. The Palmerstons, too, have had down all their\r\n     pictures from London--such a Rembrandt, Pilate washing his hands.\r\n     Lord Ashburton does not look much like a settler of a Boundary\r\n     question.[22] She is an American, and we swore eternal friendship\r\n     upon Boston; I having, you know, much curious information to give\r\n     _her_ upon that city and its inhabitants. She had a raspberry-tart\r\n     of diamonds upon her forehead worth seeing. Then Mesmerism, and\r\n     when we parted, we had got up so high into _Vestiges_[23] that I\r\n     could not get down again, and was obliged to go off as an angel.\r\n     The Ashburtons were the only people asked to meet the Queen at\r\n     Strathfieldsaye (of her society). It was the most entire crash ever\r\n     heard of, and the not asking the Palmerstons considered almost a\r\n     personal insult; but they say the old Duke now cares for nothing\r\n     but flattery, and asks nobody but masters of hounds. He almost\r\n     ill-treated the Speaker. After dinner, they all stood at ease about\r\n     the drawing-room, and behaved like so many soldiers on parade. The\r\n     Queen did her very best to enliven the gloom, but was at last\r\n     over-powered by numbers, gagged, and her hands tied. The only\r\n     amusement was seeing Albert taught to miss at billiards.\r\n\r\n  [22] A reference to the \"Ashburton Treaty\" concluded at Washington in\r\n       1842. Alexander Baring, first Baron Ashburton, was the English\r\n       commissioner.\r\n\r\n  [23] _Vestiges of Creation_, by Robert Chambers, had been published in\r\n       the preceding year (1844).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nFlorence's remark that she would only provide the _zéro_ of _esprit_ to\r\nMiss Clarke's _quatre_, is by no means to be taken literally. She was\r\nattractive, and she attracted both men and women. She talked well, and\r\noften laid herself out to interest her companions, and sometimes\r\nconfounded them with learning. In 1844 Julia Ward Howe was in England\r\nwith her husband, Dr. Howe, and they visited the Nightingales at Embley.\r\n\"Florence,\" writes Mrs. Howe in her reminiscences, \"was rather elegant\r\nthan beautiful; she was tall and graceful of figure, her countenance\r\nmobile and expressive, her conversation most interesting.\"[24] A\r\nreminiscence of a later date records an encounter with Sir Henry de la\r\nBèche, the pioneer of the Geological Map of England. Warrenton Smythe\r\nand Sir Henry dined at Mr. Nightingale's, and Florence sat between them.\r\n\"She began by drawing Sir Henry out on geology, and charmed him by the\r\nboldness and breadth of her views, which were not common then. She\r\naccidentally proceeded into regions of Latin and Greek, and then our\r\ngeologist had to get out of it. She was fresh from Egypt, and began\r\ntalking with W. Smythe about the inscriptions, etc., where he thought he\r\ncould do pretty well; but when she began quoting Lepsius, which she had\r\nbeen studying in the original, he was in the same case as Sir Henry.\r\nWhen the ladies left the room, Sir Henry said to Smythe, 'A capital\r\nyoung lady that, if she hadn't floored me with her Latin and\r\nGreek.'\"[25] \"I have been dowagering out with Papa,\" wrote Florence to\r\nMiss Clarke (March 1843), \"in the big coach to a formal dinner-party,\r\nwhere, however, Mr. Gerard Noel and I were very thick, he inquiring\r\ntenderly after you and your whereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n  [24] _Reminiscences, 1819-1899_, by Julia Ward Howe, 1900, p. 138.\r\n\r\n  [25] Caroline Fox, _Memories of Old Friends_, 1882, pp. 311-312.\r\n\r\nOf Miss Nightingale's personal appearance in early womanhood, there are\r\npen-pictures by very competent hands. Lady Lovelace, in her verses\r\nentitled _A Portrait, Taken from Life_, emphasises a certain spiritual\r\naloofness in her friend:--\r\n\r\n          I saw her pass, and paused to think!\r\n            She moves as one on whom to gaze\r\n          With calm and holy thoughts, that link\r\n            The soul to God in prayer and praise.\r\n          She walks as if on heaven's brink,\r\n            Unscathed thro' life's entangled maze.\r\n\r\n          I heard her soft and silver voice\r\n            Take part in songs of harmony,\r\n          Well framed to gladden and rejoice;\r\n            Whilst her ethereal melody\r\n          Still kept my soul in wav'ring choice,\r\n            'Twixt smiles and tears of ecstasy....\r\n\r\n          I deem her fair,--yes, very fair!\r\n            Yet some there are who pass her by,\r\n          Unmoved by all the graces there.\r\n            Her face doth raise no burning sigh,\r\n          Nor hath her slender form the glare\r\n            Which strikes and rivets every eye.\r\n\r\n          Her grave, but large and lucid eye,\r\n            Unites a boundless depth of feeling\r\n          With Truth's own bright transparency,\r\n            Her singleness of heart revealing;\r\n          But still her spirit's history\r\n            From light and curious gaze concealing....\r\n\r\n[Illustration:      _Florence Nightingale as a girl: about 1845_\r\n                    _from a drawing by Miss Hilary Bonham Carter_]\r\n\r\nMrs. Gaskell's picture in prose gives some lighter touches. \"She is\r\ntall; very straight and willowy in figure; thick and shortish rich brown\r\nhair; very delicate complexion; grey eyes, which are generally pensive\r\nand drooping, but when they choose can be the merriest eyes I ever saw;\r\nand perfect teeth, making her smile the sweetest I ever saw. Put a long\r\npiece of soft net, and tie it round this beautifully shaped head, so as\r\nto form a soft white framework for the full oval of her face (for she\r\nhad the toothache, and so wore this little piece of drapery), and dress\r\nher up in black silk, high up to the long, white round throat, and with\r\na black shawl on, and you may get _near_ an idea of her perfect grace\r\nand lovely appearance. She is so like a saint.\"[26] She dressed\r\nbecomingly; but had a saint's carelessness in such things, somewhat to\r\nher elder sister's despair. \"_Make_ Flo wear her white silk frock\r\nto-night,\" she wrote on one occasion to her mother. Many years later,\r\nwhen stores and comforts were being sent out to the East under cover to\r\nthe Lady-in-Chief, Lady Verney insinuated \"one little gown for Flo,\" and\r\nwho will not love her for it? \"When in 1849 she started to winter in the\r\nEast, her mother says\"--I quote again from Mrs. Gaskell--\"they equipped\r\nher _en princesse_, and when she came back she had little besides the\r\nclothes she had on; she had given away her linen, etc., right and left\r\nto those who wanted it.\"\r\n\r\n  [26] From a letter to Catherine Winkworth, written in 1854; for other\r\n       passages in the letter, see pp. 8, 41, 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThose who have social gifts often find sufficient happiness in their\r\nexercise; but Florence, though she sometimes enjoyed the intercourse of\r\nintellectual society, reproached herself all the while for doing so. She\r\nfelt increasingly that she had other gifts which were more properly\r\nhers, and that the life of society was a distraction into the wrong\r\npath. She found even the London season more congenial than the life of\r\nthe hospitable country-house. \"People talk of London gaieties,\" she\r\nwrote to Miss Nicholson (\"Aunt Hannah\"); \"but there you can at least\r\nhave your mornings to yourself. To me the country is the place of 'row.'\r\nSince we came home in September, how long do you think we have been\r\nalone? Not one fortnight. A country-house is the real place for\r\ndissipation. Sometimes I think that everybody is hard upon me, that to\r\nbe for ever expected to be looking merry and saying something lively is\r\nmore than can be asked mornings, noons, and nights.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she was alone with her parents and her sister, she hardly found the\r\nlife at home more satisfying. This was partly, as she confessed in many\r\na page of self-examination, the result of her own shortcomings. \"Ask\r\nme,\" she wrote to \"Aunt Hannah,\" \"to do something for your sake,\r\nsomething difficult, and you will see that I shall do it _regularly_,\r\nwhich is for me the most difficult thing of all.\" Let those who reproach\r\nthemselves for a desultoriness, seemingly incurable, take heart again\r\nfrom the example of Florence Nightingale! No self-reproach recurs more\r\noften in her private outpourings at this time than that of irregularity\r\nand even sloth. She found it difficult to rise early in the morning; she\r\nprayed and wrestled to be delivered from desultory thoughts, from idle\r\ndreaming, from scrappiness in unselfish work. She wrestled, and she won.\r\nWhen her capacities had found full scope in congenial work, nothing was\r\nmore fixed and noteworthy in her life and work than regularity,\r\nprecision, method, persistence. But in part, the failings with which she\r\nreproached herself were the fault of her circumstances. The fact of the\r\ntwo country homes militated against steady work in either. Her parents\r\nwere not, indeed, careless or thoughtless beyond others in their\r\nstation, but rather the reverse. Mr. Nightingale was a careful landlord\r\nand zealous in county business, and his wife took some interest, as I\r\nhave already said, in village schools and charities. But to Florence's\r\nparents, these things were rather graces rightly incidental to their\r\nstation, than the main business of life. Florence's more eager\r\ntemperament and larger capacity craved for greater consistency in the\r\nenergies of life. She was expected to play the part of Lady Bountiful\r\none day, and to be equally ready to play that of Lady Graceful the next.\r\nA friend who visited at Lea Hurst recalls how Florence would often be\r\nmissing in the evening, and on search being made she would be found in\r\nthe village, sitting by the bedside of some sick person, and saying she\r\ncould not sit down to a grand seven o'clock dinner while this was going\r\non.[27] But by the time she had schooled herself to any regularity of\r\nwork at Lea Hurst, the hour had come for moving to Embley. By the time\r\nshe had settled down to work amongst her poor at Embley, the hour of the\r\nLondon season had struck. \"I should be very glad,\" she wrote to her aunt\r\nfrom Embley, \"if I could have been left here when they went to London,\r\nas there is so much to be done, but as that would not be heard of,\r\nLondon is really my place of rest.\"\r\n\r\n  [27] Letter of Mrs. Gaskell to Catherine Winkworth, Oct. 20, 1854.\r\n\r\nThe companionship which Florence had at home was sometimes wearisome to\r\nher. The sisters, as we have already seen, were not in full sympathy.\r\nThe parents were not unintellectual persons, but, again, much the\r\nreverse. Mrs. Nightingale was a woman of bright intelligence, and of\r\nmuch social charm. Mr. Nightingale was a highly intellectual man,\r\nsensitive, too, and refined. He shot and hunted, but he was not ardently\r\ndevoted to either sport, and was interested in many things. Perhaps in\r\ntoo many, and yet not enough in any. Florence Nightingale in her later\r\nyears used sometimes to describe with a twinkle of affectionate humour\r\nthe routine of a morning in her home life as a girl. Mama, we may\r\nsuppose, was busy with housekeeping cares. Papa was very fond of reading\r\naloud, and in order to interest his daughters, would take them through\r\nthe whole of _The Times_, with many a comment, no doubt, by the way.\r\n\"Now, for Parthe,\" Miss Nightingale used to say, \"the morning's reading\r\ndid not matter; she went on with her drawing; but for me, who had no\r\nsuch cover, the thing was boring to desperation.\" \"To be read aloud to,\"\r\nshe wrote, \"is the most miserable exercise of the human intellect. Or\r\nrather, is it any exercise at all? It is like lying on one's back, with\r\none's hands tied, and having liquid poured down one's throat. Worse than\r\nthat, because suffocation would immediately ensue, and put a stop to\r\nthis operation. But no suffocation would stop the other.\"[28] As the\r\nyounger daughter of a busily efficient mother, Florence was not often\r\nentrusted with household duties; but on one occasion at any rate, she\r\nwas left in command, and that, during the important season of\r\njam-making. \"My reign is now over,\" she wrote to her cousin Hilary, who\r\nwas an art-student (Dec. 1845); \"angels and ministers of grace defend me\r\nfrom another! though I cannot but view my fifty-six pots with the proud\r\nsatisfaction of an Artist, my head a little on one side, inspecting the\r\nhappy effect of my works with more feeling of the Beautiful than Parthe\r\never had in hers.\" And even housekeeping brought obstinate questionings\r\nwith it to Florence. She describes a bout of it on another occasion in a\r\nletter to Madame Mohl (July 1847):--\r\n\r\n     I am up to my chin in linen and glass, and I am very fond of\r\n     housekeeping. In this too-highly-educated, too-little-active age\r\n     it, at least, is a practical application of our theories to\r\n     something--and yet, in the middle of my lists, my green lists,\r\n     brown lists, red lists, of all my instruments of the ornamental in\r\n     culinary accomplishments which I cannot even divine the use of, I\r\n     cannot help asking in my head, Can reasonable people want all this?\r\n     Is all that china, linen, glass necessary to make man a Progressive\r\n     animal? Is it even good Political Economy (query, for \"good,\" read\r\n     \"atheistical\" Pol. Econ.?) to invent wants in order to supply\r\n     employment? Or ought not, in these times, all expenditure to be\r\n     reproductive? \"And a proper stupid answer you'll get,\" says the\r\n     best Versailles service; \"so go and do your accounts; there is one\r\n     of us cracked.\"\r\n\r\n  [28] _Suggestions for Thought_, vol. ii. p. 385.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nFlorence was an affectionate and dutiful daughter. She obeyed and\r\nyielded for many years. She strove hard to think that her duty lay at\r\nhome, and that the trivial round and common task would furnish all that\r\nshe had any right, before God or man, to ask. But as the sense of a\r\nvocation elsewhere strengthened and deepened in her mind, she may well\r\nhave thought that, as her elder sister was contented to stay at home, a\r\nlife of activity outside might for the other daughter not be\r\ninconsistent with affection for her parents.\r\n\r\nShe had, indeed, intellectual interests of her own. She read a great\r\ndeal in English, French, German; in devotional works, in poetry,\r\nhistory, philosophy. And what she read she marked, and inwardly\r\ndigested. A copy (unfortunately not complete) is preserved of the first\r\nedition of Browning's _Paracelsus_, which she annotated with remarks,\r\nparaphrases, and illustrative cases as she read. The first scene of the\r\npoem--\"Paracelsus Aspires\"--contains many a passage which aroused a\r\nsympathetic echo in her heart. The key-note is struck early. \"Pursuing\r\nan aim not to be found in life,\" is her comment, \"is its true misery.\"\r\nThen she kept commonplace-books, in which, under heads alphabetically\r\narranged--such as Age of Reason, Bigotry, Creeds, Death, Education, and\r\nso forth--she copied out passages which struck her. She was accumulating\r\nstores of information and reflection. In some remarks upon Lacordaire in\r\none of her note-books I find this passage copied out:--\r\n\r\n     I desire for a considerable time only to lead a life of obscurity\r\n     and toil, for the purpose of allowing whatever I may have received\r\n     of God to ripen, and turning it some day to the glory of His Name.\r\n     Nowadays people are too much in a hurry both to produce and consume\r\n     themselves. It is only in retirement, in silence, in meditation,\r\n     that are formed the men who are called to exercise an influence on\r\n     society.\r\n\r\nFor her own part, as her powers of reflection were strengthened, so did\r\nher sense of a vocation become more insistent with every year. In some\r\nautobiographical notes, Miss Nightingale records May 7, 1852, as the\r\ndate at which she was conscious of \"a call from God to be a saviour\";\r\nbut the thought of devoting herself to be a nurse came much earlier.\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe, in the reminiscences quoted above, describes how\r\nduring the visit of herself and her husband to Embley in 1844, Florence\r\nhad taken Dr. Howe aside and asked him this question: \"If I should\r\ndetermine to study nursing, and to devote my life to that profession, do\r\nyou think it would be a dreadful thing?\" Dr. Howe, it will be\r\nremembered, was of wide repute as a philanthropist, and Miss\r\nNightingale thought much of his opinion. It was favourable to her wish.\r\n\"Not a dreadful thing at all,\" he replied; \"I think it would be a very\r\ngood thing.\" \"My idea of heaven,\" she wrote a little time afterwards,\r\n\"is when my dear Aunt Hannah and I and my boy Shore and all of us shall\r\nbe together, nursing the sick people who are left behind, and giving\r\neach other sympathies beside, and our Saviour in the midst of us, giving\r\nus strength.\" But, meanwhile, she hoped to realize some little piece of\r\nthe heaven on earth. She pursued other inquiries, laid her plans, kept\r\nher own counsel, and then made a first bid for freedom. The nature of\r\nher plans, the nipping of them in the bud by maternal frost, and her\r\nfollowing dejection are told in a letter to her cousin Hilary (Dec. 11,\r\n1845):--\r\n\r\n     Well, my dearest, I am not yet come to the great thing I wanted to\r\n     say. I have always found that there was so much truth in the\r\n     suggestion that you must dig for hidden treasures _in silence_ or\r\n     you will not find it; and so I dug after my poor little plan in\r\n     silence, even from you. It was to go to be a nurse at Salisbury\r\n     Hospital for these few months to learn the \"prax.\"; and then to\r\n     come home and make such wondrous intimacies at West Wellow, under\r\n     the shelter of a rhubarb powder and a dressed leg; let alone that\r\n     no one could ever say to me again, your health will not stand this\r\n     or that. I saw a poor woman die before my eyes this summer because\r\n     there was no one but fools to sit up with her, who poisoned her as\r\n     much as if they had given her arsenic. And then I had such a fine\r\n     plan for those dreaded latter days (which I have never dreaded), if\r\n     I should outlive my immediate ties, of taking a small house in West\r\n     Wellow.--Well, I do not like much talking about it, but I thought\r\n     something like a Protestant Sisterhood, without vows, for women of\r\n     educated feelings, might be established. But there have been\r\n     difficulties about my very first step, which terrified Mama. I do\r\n     not mean the physically revolting parts of a hospital, but things\r\n     about the surgeons and nurses which you may guess. Even Mrs.\r\n     Fowler[29] threw cold water upon it; and nothing will be done this\r\n     year at all events, and I do not believe--ever; and no advantage\r\n     that I see comes of my living on, excepting that one becomes less\r\n     and less of a young lady every year, which is only a negative one.\r\n     You will laugh, dear, at the whole plan, I daresay; but no one but\r\n     the mother of it knows how precious an infant idea becomes; nor\r\n     how the soul dies between the destruction of one and the taking up\r\n     of another. I shall never do anything, and am worse than dust and\r\n     nothing. I wonder if our Saviour were to walk the earth again, and\r\n     I were to go to Him and ask, whether He would send me back to live\r\n     this life again, which crushes me into vanity and deceit. Oh for\r\n     some strong thing to sweep this loathsome life into the past.\r\n\r\n  [29] The wife of Dr. Richard Fowler, physician to the Salisbury\r\n       Infirmary, mentioned above, p. 35.\r\n\r\nAnd so ended for the time the dash of the caged bird for liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                            THE SPIRITUAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n     Though the outward man may perish, yet the inward man is renewed\r\n     day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,\r\n     worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;\r\n     while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things\r\n     which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal, but\r\n     the things which are not seen are eternal.--ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nThe failure of her plan left Florence in a state of great dejection.\r\n\"The day of personal hopes and fears,\" she wrote, \"is over for me. Now I\r\ndread and desire no more.\" This was but a passing mood; and very soon,\r\nas we shall hear in the next chapter, she resumed, with increased\r\ndetermination, her struggle for freedom and self-expression in a life of\r\naction. But for the moment, and at many recurring moments in later\r\nyears, the dejection was intense. It was not merely the disappointment\r\nof an eager mind denied its appropriate energy; it was the exceeding\r\nbitter cry of an intensely religious soul, tempted in its perplexity to\r\nask, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"\r\n\r\nIn some autobiographical notes Miss Nightingale recorded under the year\r\n1843 \"an illness and an acquaintance I made with a woman to whom all\r\nunseen things seemed real, and eternal things near, awakened me\" [from\r\ndreaming]. The woman to whom she referred was, it may safely be\r\nconjectured, Miss Hannah Nicholson. They met once or twice a year--when\r\nMiss Nicholson visited Embley or Miss Nightingale stayed with Miss\r\nNicholson's brother at Waverley. At other times they exchanged a\r\nvoluminous correspondence, and this was almost entirely devoted to\r\nreligious experiences and speculations. \"Aunt Hannah\" had inexhaustible\r\nsympathy with her self-torturing young friend. She did not chide or\r\ndiscourage Florence; but the burden of her message was the claim of the\r\nspiritual life, the message of Paul to the Corinthians. \"Your whole\r\nlife,\" wrote Florence in one of many bursts of affectionate gratitude to\r\nMiss Nicholson, \"seems to be love, and you always find words in your\r\nheart which, without the pretension of enlightening, yet are like a\r\nclearing up to me. You always seem to rest on the heart of the divine\r\nTeacher, and to participate in His mysteries.\" \"Your letters,\" she said\r\non another occasion, \"stay by me and warm me when the dreams of life\r\ncome one after another, clouding and covering the realities of the\r\nunseen.\" To this sympathetic and (in some limited respects) kindred\r\nsoul, Florence poured out unreservedly the experiences of her spiritual\r\nlife; as also, sometimes, though with more conscious art of literary\r\nexpression, to Miss Clarke in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nA few letters, selected from a great number, will serve to trace the\r\ncourse of her religious thoughts. They resumed, it will be seen, the\r\nspiritual experiences and convictions of the saints who have served\r\nmankind. The _Reality of the Unseen World_ is the subject of a letter to\r\nMiss Clarke (August 1846), in which, after a page of family news, she\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n     But I think you must be tired of all this, for I fancy that you\r\n     live much more in the supernatural than the natural world. I always\r\n     believe in Homer; and in St. Paul's \"cloud of witnesses\"; and in\r\n     the old Italian pictures, which have a first story, where the\r\n     Unseen live _au premier_, with a two-pair back, where the Père\r\n     Eternel's shadow is half seen peeping out, and a ground floor where\r\n     poor mortals live, but still have a connexion with the\r\n     establishment above stairs. I like those books, where the Invisible\r\n     communicates freely with the Visible Kingdom; not that they ever\r\n     come up to one's idea, which is always so much brighter than the\r\n     execution (for the word is only the shadow cast by the light of the\r\n     thought); but they are suggestive. I always believe in a multitude\r\n     of spirits inhabiting the same house with ourselves; we are only\r\n     the entresol, quite the most insignificant of its lodgers, and too\r\n     busy with our pursuit of daily bread, too much confined with hard\r\n     work, and too full of the struggle with the material world, to\r\n     visit the glorious beings immediately about us--whom we shall see,\r\n     when the present candle of our earthly reason is put out, which\r\n     blinds us just as the candle end, left burning after one is in bed,\r\n     long prevents us from seeing the world without, lit up by the full\r\n     moon. It trembles and flickers and sinks into its socket, and then\r\n     we catch a bright stripe of moonlight shining on the floor; but it\r\n     flares up again, and the silvery stream is gone \"as if it could not\r\n     be, as if it had not been,\" and we can see nothing but the candle,\r\n     and hardly imagine any other light--till at last it goes quite out,\r\n     and the flood of moonlight rushes into the room, and every pane of\r\n     the casement window, and every ivy leaf without, are stamped, as it\r\n     were, upon the floor, and a whole world revealed to us, which that\r\n     flickering candle was the means of concealing from us. This is what\r\n     Jesus Christ meant, I suppose, when He said that He must go away in\r\n     order to be _with_ His friends in His spirit, that He would be much\r\n     nearer to them after death than in the flesh. In the flesh, we were\r\n     separated from our friends by their going into the next room\r\n     only--a door, a partition divided us; but what can separate two\r\n     souls? Often I fancy that we can perceive the presence of a good\r\n     spirit communicating thoughts to us: are they not all ministering\r\n     spirits, sent forth to minister unto us? When Jesus Christ warns us\r\n     not to despise any one, because that in Heaven their angels do\r\n     always behold the face of His Father, perhaps He thought that our\r\n     beloved ones, who are gone, might be these our \"angels,\" who must\r\n     therefore have communion with men.\r\n\r\n     It is here, where a cold and false life of conventionalism and\r\n     prejudices and frivolity is often all that reaches our outward\r\n     senses, that we are sometimes baffled in seeing into the life which\r\n     lies beneath; it is here, amidst the tempers and little vexations,\r\n     which are the shadows that dim the brightest intercourse, it is\r\n     here that we fail sometimes in having intimate communion with\r\n     souls, and we stop short at the dead coverings; but between the\r\n     soul which is free, and our soul, what barrier, what restraint can\r\n     there be? Human sympathy is indeed necessary to our happiness of\r\n     every moment, and the absence of it makes an awful void in our\r\n     life. Every room becomes a grave, and every book we used to read\r\n     together a monument to the one we love. But some one says, that we\r\n     need an _idée merveilleuse_ to preserve us from the busy devils,\r\n     which imagination here is always conjuring up. This _idée\r\n     merveilleuse_, I think, is the idea of the loving presence of\r\n     spirits. Those dear ones are safe, and yet with us still, for truly\r\n     do I believe that these senses of ours are what veil from us, not\r\n     discover to us, the world around (which is sometimes revealed to\r\n     us in dreams, or in moments of excitement, as at the point of\r\n     death, either our own or a friend's, or by mesmerism, or by faith).\r\n     Faith is the real eye and ear of the soul, and as it would be\r\n     impossible to describe the harmony and melody of Music to one who\r\n     was born deaf, or to make a blind man perceive the beauty of the\r\n     effects of colour, so without faith the spiritual world is as much\r\n     a hidden one to the soul as the Art of Painting to the blind man.\r\n     On a dark night the moon, when at last she rises, reveals to us,\r\n     just at our feet, a world of objects, of the presence of which we\r\n     were not aware before. We see the river sparkling in the moonbeams\r\n     close beside us, and the tall shadows sleeping quietly on the\r\n     grass, and the sharp relief of the architectural cornices, and the\r\n     strong outline of the lights and shades, so well defined that we\r\n     can scarcely believe that a moment ago, and we did not see them.\r\n     What shall we say if, one day, the moon rises upon our spiritual\r\n     world, and we see close at hand, ready to hold the most intimate\r\n     communion with us, those spirits, whom we had loved and mourned as\r\n     lost to us? We are like the blind men by the wayside, and ought to\r\n     sit and cry, Lord that we may receive our sight! And, when we _do_\r\n     receive it, we shall perhaps find that we require no transporting\r\n     into another world, to become aware of the immediate presence of an\r\n     Infinite Spirit, and of other lesser ones whom we thought gone.\r\n     What we require is sight, not change of place, I believe.\r\n\r\nThe struggle which absorbed Florence's mind and heart was to establish\r\nsome harmony between her dealings in the world of sense and her\r\ncommunion with the unseen world. She reproached herself for impatience,\r\nfor selfishness, for lack of confidence in the good time of God. Happy\r\nare they who have no more occasion than she to deem themselves\r\nunprofitable servants! But the condition of attainment to comparative\r\nsinlessness is, I suppose, the _Conviction of Sin_; and this was\r\nintensely present to Florence Nightingale. \"I have read over your\r\nletters many times again and again since I have been here,\" she wrote\r\nfrom Tapton (her grandmother Shore's house) in 1845. \"Ah, my dear Aunt\r\nHannah, you are like the white swan on your cool, fresh, blue lake,\r\nrocked to peace and rest by the sweet winds of your faith and love, and\r\nyou cannot be dragged down into our busy chicken-yard of struggling,\r\n_scratting_ life.[30] You do not know what it is, when one has sinned\r\nwith such aggravation as I have. No one has had such advantages, and I\r\nhave sinned with all these, and after having been made to know what sin\r\nwas, and what my obligations were. No one has so grieved the Holy\r\nSpirit. I have sinned against my conviction, and, as it were, standing\r\nbefore God's judgment-seat.\" In many of Miss Nightingale's religious\r\noutpourings, both in letters and in private diaries, there is a note\r\nwhich borders on the morbid; but the danger-point is averted, sometimes\r\nby practical good sense, and sometimes by a saving sense of humour. The\r\nletter, just given, was soon followed by another (from Embley, Oct.\r\n1845), containing this account of a scene at the bedside of her\r\nfavourite little cousin:--\"One night when I was reading to Shore the\r\nverse about the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, and\r\nwe were agreeing that the temptations of the flesh were liking a great\r\ndeal of play and no work, and lying long bed, and the temptations of the\r\nworld liking to be praised and admired, and be a general favourite, and\r\nso on, more than anything else, and we were both very much affected, he\r\nsaid before I left him, 'Now I may lie in bed to-morrow, and you won't\r\ncall me at six, will you?' And I too went away to dream about a great\r\nmany things which I had much better not think about. Oh, how I did laugh\r\nat the results of all our feelings! To think and to be are two such\r\ndifferent things!\"\r\n\r\n  [30] The reader will note the recurrence here of some phrases already\r\n       used in another letter. It is an instance of a point there noted\r\n       (p. 28).\r\n\r\nTo bring thought and action into harmony, to make the presence of the\r\nUnseen a guide through the path of this present world: that is the\r\nproblem of the practically religious life. To Florence Nightingale,\r\ncommunion with the Unseen meant something deeper, richer, fuller, more\r\npositive than the fear of God. The fear of God is the beginning, but not\r\nthe end, of wisdom, for perfect love casteth out fear. It was for the\r\nlove of God as an active principle in her mind, constraining all her\r\ndeeds, that she strove. When she was conscious of falling away from this\r\ngrace, she knew _the pains of hell_, here and now, as the state of a\r\nsoul in estrangement from the Eternal goodness:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Nicholson._) EMBLEY, _Christmas Eve_ [undated]. Think of\r\n     me to-morrow at the Sacrament. I have not taken it since I last\r\n     took it with you, except once, with a poor woman on her death-bed.\r\n     Time has sped wearily with me since then, Aunt Hannah. If, when the\r\n     plough goes over the soul, there were always the hand of the Sower\r\n     there to scatter the seed after it, who would regret? But how often\r\n     the seed-time has passed, it is too late, the harrow has gone over,\r\n     the time of harvest has come and the harvest is not.... Give me\r\n     your thoughts to-morrow, my dear Aunt Hannah; I want them sadly;\r\n     and take me with you to the Throne of Grace. Bless me too, as poor\r\n     Esau said. I have so felt with him, and cried with a great and\r\n     exceeding bitter cry, Bless me, even me also, O my Father; but He\r\n     never has yet, and I have not deserved that He should.\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Nicholson, May 1846._) \"The sorrows of hell compassed me\r\n     about.\" We learn to know what these are beforehand, when we cannot\r\n     command our thoughts to pray, when all our omissions give\r\n     themselves form and life, and shut us up within a wall over which\r\n     there is no looking, no return: when they hold us down with a\r\n     resistless power, and we are hemmed in with our remembrances, like\r\n     a cell compassing us about. What can the future hell be other than\r\n     this? The Unspeakable Presence may be joy and peace unspeakable,\r\n     but it may be a Horror, a Dweller on our Threshold, a Spirit of\r\n     Fear to the stricken conscience. Jesus Christ prayed on the Cross\r\n     not for life or safety, but only for the light of His countenance:\r\n     Why hast Thou forsaken me? And all sorrows disappear before that\r\n     one. Let those who have felt it say if it is not so, and if there\r\n     is any sorrow like unto that sorrow. How willingly would we\r\n     exchange it for pain, which we almost welcome as a proof of His\r\n     care and attention. Grief in itself is no evil; as making the\r\n     Unseen, the Eternal, and the Infinite present to our consciousness,\r\n     it is rather a good. But when all one's imaginations are wandering\r\n     out of one's reach, then one realizes the future state of\r\n     punishment even in this world. Pray that He will not leave my soul\r\n     in hell. How little can be done under the spirit of fear; it is the\r\n     very sentence pronounced upon the serpent, \"Upon thy belly shalt\r\n     thou go all the days of thy life.\" Oh, if any one thinks that, in\r\n     the repentance of fear, this is the time for the soul to open to\r\n     the Infinite goodness, to the spirit of love and of power and of a\r\n     sound mind, in the heart's death to live and love,--let him try how\r\n     hard it is to collect oneself out of distraction--let him feel the\r\n     woes of saying _To-morrow_, when God has said _To-day_; and then\r\n     when he has found how weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable seem all\r\n     the uses of the world, let him try with a dead heart to live unto\r\n     God, to love with all his strength when all energy to love is gone.\r\n\r\nThe state of perfect love, expressing itself in perfect rightness of\r\nthought and deed, may be unattainable on earth, but nothing lower than\r\nthe search for this ideal can satisfy the yearnings of a soul such as\r\nwas Florence Nightingale's. She had the _Hunger for Righteousness_. \"The\r\ncrown of _righteousness_!\" she wrote to Miss Nicholson (May 1846). \"That\r\nword always strikes me more than anything in the Bible. Strange that not\r\nhappiness, not rest, not forgiveness, not glory, should have been the\r\nthought of that glorious man's mind, when at the eve of the last and\r\ngreatest of his labours; all desires so swallowed up in the one great\r\ncraving after _righteousness_ that, at the end of all his struggles, it\r\nwas mightier within him than ever, mightier even than the desire of\r\npeace. How can people tell one to dwell within a good conscience, when\r\nthe chief of all the apostles so panted after righteousness that he\r\nconsidered it the last best gift, unattainable on earth, to be bestowed\r\nin Heaven?\"\r\n\r\nTo do _All for the Love of God_ was the ideal which she sought to\r\nattain. \"The foundation of all must be the love of God. That the\r\nsufferings of Christ's life were intense, who doubts? but the happiness\r\nmust also have been intense. Only think of the happiness of working, and\r\nworking successfully too, and with no doubts as to His path, and with no\r\nalloy of vanity or love of display or glory, but with the ecstasy of\r\nsingle-heartedness! All that I do is always poisoned by the fear that I\r\nam not doing it in simplicity and godly sincerity.\" This was one of the\r\nconstant dreads throughout her life. When she had become famous, and was\r\npraised and courted by the popular breath, she shrank, with an\r\nabhorrence which some may have considered almost morbid and which was\r\ncertainly foreign to the fashion of the world, from any avoidable\r\npublicity. This was no pose or affectation; it was part of her religion.\r\nIt was a counsel dictated by her earnest striving to dissociate her work\r\nfor God from any taint of worldliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe world which came to owe much to the life and example of Florence\r\nNightingale, owes something to Miss Nicholson, whose gentle sympathy\r\nbrought to her young friend much strength and peace. But the world may\r\nalso be glad, I think, that Miss Nightingale's religious thought worked\r\nitself out in the end on lines of her own. Florence Nightingale has been\r\nenrolled by the popular voice among the saints; but there are saints and\r\nsaints--saints contemplative or mystic, and saints active and\r\nministering. In all ages of the world there have been godly women whose\r\npassion of religious spirit has led them to lives of professional\r\npieties, rather than of practical service; who have spent in ecstasies\r\nof pity, or in tortures of self-abasement at the foot of the Cross,\r\npowers which might have gone to redeem and save the world. Florence\r\nNightingale had, as we have sufficiently seen, a profound sense of\r\npersonal religion. She felt, as all the saints must feel, that a\r\nreligious life means a state of the soul; but she attained also to the\r\nconviction, which became ever stronger within her, that a state of the\r\nsoul can only be approved by its fruits, and that thus _the Service of\r\nGod is the Service of Man_:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Nicholson._) EMBLEY, _Sept._ 24, [1846]. I am almost\r\n     heart-broken to leave Lea Hurst. There are so many duties there\r\n     which lie near at hand, and I could be well content to do them\r\n     there all the days of my life. I have left so many poor friends\r\n     there whom I shall never see again, and so much might have been\r\n     done for them.... I feel my sympathies are with Ignorance and\r\n     Poverty. The things which interest me interest them; we are alike\r\n     in expecting little from life, much from God; we are taken up with\r\n     the same objects.... My imagination is so filled with the misery of\r\n     this world that the only thing in which to labour brings any\r\n     return, seems to me helping and sympathizing _there_; and all that\r\n     poets sing of the glories of this world appears to me untrue: all\r\n     the people I see are eaten up with care or poverty or disease. I\r\n     know that it was God who created the good, and man the evil, which\r\n     was not the will of God, but the necessary consequence of His\r\n     leaving free-will to man. I know that misery is the alphabet of\r\n     fire, in which history, with its warning hand, writes in flaming\r\n     letters the consequences of Evil (the Kingdom of _Man_), and that\r\n     without its glaring light, we should never see the path back into\r\n     the Kingdom of God, or heed the directing guide-posts. But the\r\n     judgments of nature (the law of God), as she goes her mighty,\r\n     solemn, inflexible march, sweeps sometimes so fearfully over man\r\n     that though it is the triumph, not the defeat of God's truth and of\r\n     His laws, that falsehood against them must work misery, and misery\r\n     is perhaps _here_ the strongest proof that His loving hand is\r\n     present,--yet all our powers, hopes, and fears must, it seems to\r\n     me, be engrossed by doing His work for its relief. Life is no\r\n     holiday game, nor is it a clever book, nor is it a school of\r\n     instruction, nor a valley of tears; but it is a hard fight, a\r\n     struggle, a wrestling with the Principle of Evil, hand to hand,\r\n     foot to foot. Every inch of the way must be disputed. The night is\r\n     given us to take breath, to pray, to drink deep at the fountain of\r\n     power. The day, to use the strength which has been given us, to go\r\n     forth to work with it till the evening. The Kingdom of God is\r\n     coming; and \"_Thy Kingdom_ come\" does not mean only \"_My salvation_\r\n     come.\"\r\n\r\n\"To find out what we can do,\" she wrote as an annotation in Browning's\r\n_Paracelsus_, \"one's individual place, as well as the General End, is\r\nman's task. To serve man for God's sake, not man's, will prevent failure\r\nfrom being disappointment.\" Florence Nightingale sought then to save her\r\nsoul by serving others.\r\n\r\nIt was by this same test of practical service that she came to try and\r\nto weigh the various forms of religious doctrine. Her father was, as I\r\nhave said, a Unitarian, and several other members of her family circle\r\nwere of the same persuasion. But she and some others of that circle\r\nconformed in practice to the services of the English Church. And so, in\r\nsome degree, Miss Nightingale continued to conform to the end of her\r\nlife; though, as we shall find later on, she departed widely from the\r\ndoctrines of the Church as ordinarily received, did not care about\r\n\"going to church,\" and framed a creed of her own. But she always had a\r\ntolerant mind for any faith that issued in good works, and an impatience\r\nwith any that did not. It is for this reason that she seemed to be all\r\nthings to all men in religious matters. Her mission to the Crimea\r\ninvolved, as we shall learn, some religious bickerings. Protestants\r\nthought her too indulgent to Roman Catholics, and Catholics were sore\r\nthat she did not go further with them. But her real attitude is\r\nperfectly clear, and was entirely consistent. If she looked with a\r\nfavouring eye on Roman Catholics, it was on account, not of their\r\ndogmas, but of their deeds. Two letters to Madame Mohl, ten years apart\r\nin date, suggest what was always Miss Nightingale's point of view:--\r\n\r\n     LEA HURST, _Sept._ [1841]. We are very anxious to hear, dearest\r\n     Miss Clarke, how you are going on, and how Mrs. Clarke is, some day\r\n     when you are able to write. We are just returned from the Leeds\r\n     Consecration, and a more curious or interesting sight I never saw.\r\n     Imagine a procession of 400 clergymen, all in their white robes,\r\n     with scarfs of blue and black and fur and even scarlet, so that I\r\n     thought some of them were cardinals, headed by the Archbishop of\r\n     York,[31] the Bishop of Ripon, &c., and most curious of all the\r\n     Bishop of _New Jersey_ to whom Dr. Hook (who is,--you know,\r\n     perhaps,--the _Puseyite_ vicar of Leeds) had written to ask him to\r\n     come over from America, expressly to preach the consecration\r\n     sermon. Imagine all this procession, entering the church, repeating\r\n     the 24th Ps.--and then filling the space before the altar and the\r\n     Transept--and _all_ responding aloud through the service, so that\r\n     the roll and echo of their responses through the Transept, without\r\n     being able to see _them_, was the most striking thing I ever heard.\r\n     It was quite a gathering-place for Puseyites from all parts of\r\n     England. Papa heard them debating, whether they should have lighted\r\n     candles before the Altar, but they decided no, because the Bishop\r\n     of Ripon would not like it--however they had them in the evening\r\n     and the next morning when he was gone--and Dr. Hook has the regular\r\n     Catholic jerk in making the genuflexion every time he approaches\r\n     the altar. The church is a most magnificent one, and every one has\r\n     contributed their best to it, with a true Catholic spirit; one gave\r\n     the beautiful painted window, another the Correggio for the Altar\r\n     piece, the Queen Dowager the Altar-cloth, another the bells, &c.,\r\n     &c. Dr. Hook gives a service every morning and evening at 1/2 p. 7,\r\n     and the Sacrament every Sunday; and the aisle is all occupied by\r\n     _open_ seats. During the consecration I wished to have been a\r\n     clergyman, but when Mrs. Gaskell[32] (whom I was with, she is a\r\n     good Tory and half a Puseyite and withal the most general favourite\r\n     and generally _lenient_ person in England)--when she and I came\r\n     down afterwards for the Sacrament, I could not help looking in the\r\n     faces of the clergymen, for the impression I expected to see, as\r\n     they walked down the aisle, and wandered about, (this immense\r\n     crowd) after the Sacrament--and oh! I was woefully\r\n     disappointed--they looked so stupid; and I could not help thinking,\r\n     If you had been Catholics, you would all have been on your knees\r\n     during the service, without minding your fine gowns and the cold\r\n     stones.\r\n\r\n  [31] Edward Vernon Harcourt.\r\n\r\n  [32] _Née_ Brandreth (not Mrs. Gaskell, the authoress).\r\n\r\n     EMBLEY, _Feb._ 7 [1851].... I suppose you know how the two churches\r\n     have been convulsing themselves in England in a manner\r\n     discreditable to themselves and ridiculous to others. The Anglican\r\n     Ch. screamed and struggled as if they were taking away something of\r\n     _hers_, the Catholic Ch. sang and shouted as if she had conquered\r\n     England--neither the one nor the other has happened. Only a good\r\n     many people (in our Church) found out they were Catholics and went\r\n     to Rome, and a good many other people found out they were\r\n     Protestants, which they never knew before, and left the Puseyite\r\n     pen, which has now lost half its sheep. At Oxford the Puseyite\r\n     volcano is extinct.... You know what a row there will be this\r\n     Session in Parliament about it. The most moderate wish for a\r\n     Concordat, but even these say that we must strip the R.C. Bishops\r\n     of their new titles. Many think the present Gov. will go out upon\r\n     it, because they won't do enough to satisfy the awakened prejudices\r\n     of dear John Bull. I used to think it was a mere selfish quarrel\r\n     between red stockings and lawn sleeves; but not a bit of it; it's a\r\n     real popular feeling. One would think that all our religion was\r\n     political by the way we talk, and so I believe it is. From the\r\n     rising of the sun until the going down of the same, you hear our\r\n     clergy talking of nothing but Bishops _versus_ Vicars\r\n     General--never a word of different plans of education, prisons,\r\n     penitentiaries, and so on. One would think we were born ready made\r\n     as to education, but that Art made a Church.\r\n\r\n     I feel little zeal in pulling down one Church or building up\r\n     another, in making Bishops or unmaking them. If they would _make_\r\n     us, our Faith would spring up of itself, and then we shouldn't want\r\n     either Anglican Ch. or R.C. Church to make it for us. But, bless my\r\n     soul, people are just as ignorant now of any law in the human mind\r\n     as they were in Socrates' time. We have learnt the physical laws\r\n     since then; but mental laws--why, people don't even acknowledge\r\n     their existence. They talk of grace and divine influence,--why, if\r\n     it's an arbitrary gift from God, how unkind of Him not to give it\r\n     before! And if it comes by certain laws, why don't we find them\r\n     out? But people in England think it quite profane to talk of\r\n     finding them out, and they pray \"That it may please Thee to have\r\n     mercy upon all men,\" when I should knock you down if you were to\r\n     say to _me_ \"That it should please you to have mercy upon your\r\n     boy.\" I never had any training; and training to be called\r\n     \"training,\" (as we train the fingers to play scales and shakes)--I\r\n     doubt whether anybody ever gets from other people, because they\r\n     don't know how to give it according to any certain laws. I wish\r\n     everybody would write as far as they can A Short Account of God's\r\n     Dealings with them, like the old Puritans, and then perhaps we\r\n     should find out at last what are God's ways in His goings on and\r\n     what are not.\r\n\r\nArthur Stanley (afterwards the Dean) once asked her to use her influence\r\nin preventing a friend of his and of hers from taking the step, supposed\r\nto be imminent, of joining the Roman Communion. In a long reply which\r\nMiss Nightingale wrote with great care (Nov. 26, 1852), she promised to\r\ndo what she could, but explained that this might not be much. She\r\nherself remained in the Anglican Communion \"because she was born there,\"\r\nand because the Roman Church offered some things which she personally\r\ndid not want. She feared their friend might consider that such arguments\r\nas she could urge against the Roman Church applied equally against the\r\nAnglican. And, on the other hand, she had never concealed her opinion\r\nthat the Roman Communion offered advantages to women which the Church of\r\nEngland (at that time) did not. \"The Catholic orders,\" she wrote,\r\n\"offered me work, training for that work, sympathy and help in it, such\r\nas I had in vain sought in the Church of England. The Church of England\r\nhas for men bishoprics, archbishoprics, and a little work (good men make\r\na great deal for themselves). For women she has--what? I had no taste\r\nfor theological discoveries. I would have given her my head, my heart,\r\nmy hand. She would not have them. She did not know what to do with them.\r\nShe told me to go back and do crochet in my mother's drawing-room; or,\r\nif I were tired of that, to marry and look well at the head of my\r\nhusband's table. You may go to the Sunday School, if you like it, she\r\nsaid. But she gave me no training even for that. She gave me neither\r\nwork to do for her, nor education for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the second letter to Miss Clarke shows Miss\r\nNightingale's interest in speculations about the basis of moral law; but\r\nso far as the rivalry of Churches was concerned, it was by works that\r\nshe tried them. \"In all the dens of disgrace and disease,\" she wrote in\r\none of her note-books (1849), \"the only clergy who deserve the name of\r\n_pastors_ are the Roman Catholic. The rest, of all denominations--Church\r\nof England, Church of Scotland, Dissenters--are only theology or tea\r\nmongers.\" \"It will never do,\" she once said to a friend, \"unless we have\r\na Church of which the terms of membership shall be works, not\r\ndoctrines.\"[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] _Life of Lord Houghton_, by T. Wemyss Reid, vol. i. p. 524.\r\n\r\nShe was interested, however, in doctrines also. If she was resolved to\r\ndedicate her life to the Service of Man, she was no less convinced that\r\nsuch service could only be rendered, at the best and highest, in the\r\nlight, and with the sanction, of Service to God. Herein may be found an\r\nunderlying unity and harmony through the many and diverse interests of\r\nher life. We shall see that she who opened new careers and standards of\r\npractical benevolence in the modern world, spent also years of thought\r\nupon the less manageable task, if not of providing the world with a new\r\nreligion, at any rate of giving to old doctrines a new application, and,\r\nas she hoped, a more acceptable sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                              DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n                                (1846-1847)\r\n\r\n\r\n     There are Private Martyrs as well as burnt or drowned ones. Society\r\n     of course does not know them; and Family cannot, because our\r\n     position to one another in our families is, and must be, like that\r\n     of the Moon to the Earth. The Moon revolves round her, moves with\r\n     her, never leaves her. Yet the Earth never sees but one side of\r\n     her; the other side remains for ever unknown.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\r\n     (in a Note-book of 1847-49).\r\n\r\nA poet of our time has counted \"Disappointment's dry and bitter root\"\r\namong the ingredients of \"the right mother-milk to the tough hearts that\r\npioneer their kind.\" If it indeed be so, Florence Nightingale was well\r\nnurtured. The spiritual experiences and speculations, recorded in the\r\nlast chapter, worked round to a justification, as we have seen, of her\r\nchosen plan of life. Religion thus brought no consolation for the\r\nfailure of her scheme to escape in December 1845. \"My misery and vacuity\r\nafterwards,\" she wrote in an autobiographical retrospect, \"were\r\nindescribable.\" \"All my plans have been wrecked,\" she wrote at the time,\r\n\"and my hopes destroyed, and yet without any visible, any material\r\nchange.\" She faced the new year and its life on the old lines in a mood\r\nof depression which, with some happier intervals, was to grow deeper and\r\nmore intense during the next few years.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe did not, however, abandon her ideal. We shall see in subsequent\r\nchapters that neither foreign travel distracted her from it, nor did\r\nopportunities for another kind of life allure her from the chosen path.\r\nThe way was dark before her; the goal might never be reached, she often\r\nthought, in this present sphere; but she felt increasingly that only in\r\na life of nursing or other service to the afflicted could her being find\r\nits end and scope. \"The longer I live,\" she wrote in her diary (June 22,\r\n1846), \"the more I feel as if all my being was gradually drawing to one\r\npoint, and if I could be permitted to return and accomplish that in\r\nanother being, if I may not in this, I should need no other heaven. I\r\ncould give up the hope of meeting and living with those I have loved\r\n(and nobody knows how I love) and been separated from here, if it would\r\nplease God to give me, with a nearer consciousness of His Presence, the\r\ntask of doing this in the real life.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she pursued her inquiries. Now that the fruits of Florence\r\nNightingale's pioneer work have been gathered, and that nursing is one\r\nof the recognized occupations for gentlewomen, it is not altogether easy\r\nto realize the difficulties which stood in her way. The objections were\r\nmoral and social, rooted to large measure in conventional ideas.\r\nGentlewomen, it was felt, would be exposed, if not to danger and\r\ntemptations, at least to undesirable and unfitting conditions. \"It was\r\nas if I had wanted to be a kitchen-maid,\" she said in later years.\r\nNothing is more tenacious than a social prejudice. But the prejudice was\r\nin part founded on very intelligible reasons, and in part was justified\r\nby the level of the nursing profession at the time. These are\r\nconsiderations to which full weight must be allowed, both in justice to\r\nthose who opposed Miss Nightingale's plans, and in order to understand\r\nher own courage and persistence. The idea was widely prevalent at the\r\ntime that for certain cases in hospital practice a modest woman was,\r\nfrom the nature of things, unsuited to act as a nurse. Mr. Nightingale,\r\nwho desired to do what was right by his daughter, made many inquiries,\r\nand consulted many friends. There is a letter to him from a Brighton\r\ndoctor arguing against the prevalent belief, and maintaining stoutly\r\nthat \"women of a proper age and character are not unfit for such cases.\r\nAge, habit, and office give the mind a different turn.\" But the whole of\r\nthis letter shows a degree of broad-mindedness with regard to the\r\neducation and sphere of women which was in advance of the average\r\nopinion at the time. And in any case, whether women were fit or unfit by\r\nnature, it was certain that many, perhaps most, of the women actually\r\nengaged in nursing were unfit by character, and that a refined\r\ngentlewoman, who joined the profession, might thus find herself in\r\nunpleasant surroundings. We shall have to consider this matter more\r\nfully in a subsequent chapter. Here it will suffice to say that though\r\nthere were better-managed hospitals and worse-managed, yet there was a\r\nstrong body of evidence to show that hospital nurses had opportunities,\r\nwhich they freely used, for putting the bottle to their lips \"when so\r\ndisposed,\" and that other evils were more or less prevalent also.[34]\r\nReports from Paris and its famous schools of medicine and surgery were\r\nno better. One who had been through it said that life at the \"Maternité\"\r\nwas very coarse. In the _clinique obstétricale_ at the École de Médecin,\r\n\"the élèves have the reputation of being pretty generally the students'\r\nmistresses.\" The difficulties in the way of a refined woman, who sought\r\nto obtain access to the best training, were very great. Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell, a pioneer among woman-doctors in America, told Miss\r\nNightingale of a young girl who had planned, as the only feasible way of\r\nstudying surgery in Paris, to don male attire. \"Pantaloons will be\r\naccepted as a token she is in earnest, while a petticoat is always a\r\nflag for intrigue. She has a deep voice, and I think will pass muster\r\nexceedingly well among a set of young students, but I shall be quite\r\nsorry for her to sacrifice a mass of beautiful dark auburn hair! What a\r\nstrange age we live in! What singular sacrifices and extraordinary\r\nactions are required of us in the service of truth! An age of reform is\r\na stirring, exciting one, but it is not the most beautiful.\" The more\r\nshe heard of the worst, the more was Florence Nightingale resolved to\r\nmake things better; but the more her parents heard, the greater and the\r\nmore natural was their repugnance. Somebody must do the rough pioneer\r\nwork of the world; but one can understand how the parents of an\r\nattractive daughter, for whom their own life at home seemed to them to\r\nopen many possibilities of comfortable happiness, came to desire that in\r\nthis case the somebody should be somebody else.\r\n\r\n  [34] See Miss Nightingale's letter, printed below (p. 117). Similarly she\r\n       wrote to her father in 1854 (Feb. 22), that the head nurse in a\r\n       certain London hospital told her that \"in the course of her large\r\n       experience she had never known a nurse who was not drunken, and that\r\n       there was immoral conduct practised in the very wards, of which she\r\n       gave me some awful examples.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale herself was so much impressed by the difficulties and\r\ndangers in the way of women nurses, that she was inclined at first to\r\nthe idea that the admission of gentlewomen into the calling could best\r\nbe secured, either in special hospitals connected with some religious\r\ninstitution, or in general hospitals under cover of some religious bond.\r\n\"I think,\" wrote Monckton Milnes to his wife, \"that Florence always much\r\ndistrusted the Sisterhood matter,\"[35] and such was the case. Her inner\r\nthought was that no vow was needed other than the nurse's own fitness\r\nfor the calling and devotion to it. But she was engaged in the crusade\r\nof a pioneer, and had to consider what was practically expedient and\r\nimmediately feasible, as well as what was theoretically reasonable. Dr.\r\nBlackwell was of the same opinion. She did not like religious orders in\r\nthemselves; they only \"become beautiful,\" she said, \"as an expedient, a\r\ntemporary condition, an antidote to present evils.\" Miss Nightingale was\r\ntherefore intensely interested in the Institution for Deaconesses, with\r\nits hospital, school, and penitentiary, which a Protestant minister,\r\nPastor Theodor Fliedner, had established some years before at\r\nKaiserswerth. Her family were great friends with the Bunsens, and the\r\nBaron had sent Florence one of Pastor Fliedner's Annual Reports.[36] Her\r\ninterest in it was twofold. It was the kind of institution to which\r\nProtestant mothers might not object to send their daughters. It was also\r\nin some sort a school of nursing where, whatever wider scope might\r\nafterwards be attainable, gentlewomen could serve an apprenticeship to\r\nthe calling. \"Flo,\" wrote her sister to a friend in 1848, \"is\r\nexceedingly full of the Hospital Institutions of Germany, which she\r\nthinks so much better than ours. Do you know anything of the great\r\nestablishment at Kaiserswerth, where the schools, the reform place for\r\nthe wicked, and a great hospital are all under the guidance of the\r\nDeaconesses?\" Two years before (June 1846) Florence herself had written\r\nto Miss Hilary Bonham Carter, begging her to ask Mrs. Jameson about \"the\r\nGerman lady she knew, who, not being a Catholic, could not take upon\r\nherself the vows of a Sister of Charity, but who obtained permission\r\nfrom the physician of the hospital of her town to attend the sick there,\r\nand perform all the duties which the S[oe]urs do at Dublin and the Hôtel\r\nDieu, and who had been there fifteen years when Mrs. Jameson knew her. I\r\ndo not want to know her name, if it is a secret; but only if she has\r\nextended it further into anything like a Protestant Sisterhood, if she\r\nhad any plans of that sort which should embrace women of an educated\r\nclass, and not, as in England, merely women who would be servants if\r\nthey were not nurses. How she disposed of the difficulties of surgeons\r\nmaking love to her, and of living with the women of indifferent\r\ncharacter who generally make the nurses of hospitals, as it appears she\r\nwas quite a young woman when she began, and these are the difficulties\r\nwhich vows remove which one sees nothing else can.\" Perhaps it was as a\r\nresult of these inquiries that Florence Nightingale became acquainted,\r\nthrough Baron von Bunsen, with the institution at Kaiserswerth; though,\r\nas appears from a letter given below, Madame Mohl had also sent her some\r\ninformation about it. It is certain that by the autumn of 1846 she was\r\nin possession of its Reports, and that the place had become the home of\r\nher heart. During these years she was also quietly pursuing studies on\r\nmedical and sanitary subjects.\r\n\r\n  [35] _Life of Lord Houghton_, vol. i. p. 524.\r\n\r\n  [36] In many accounts of Kaiserswerth and of Florence Nightingale, it is\r\n       stated that her knowledge of the institution came from Elizabeth\r\n       Fry. It was a pleasant temptation to establish such a link between\r\n       these two famous women, but Mrs. Fry was dead (1845) before Miss\r\n       Nightingale had ever heard, so far as her papers show, of\r\n       Kaiserswerth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts in her mind, the routine of home life became more\r\nthan ever empty and distasteful. Here are two typical extracts from her\r\ndiary of 1846:--\r\n\r\n     LEA HURST, _July_ 7. What is my business in this world and what\r\n     have I done this last fortnight? I have read the _Daughter at\r\n     Home_[37] to Father and two chapters of Mackintosh; a volume of\r\n     _Sybil_ to Mama. Learnt seven tunes by heart. Written various\r\n     letters. Ridden with Papa. Paid eight visits. Done company. And\r\n     that is all.\r\n\r\n  [37] See below, p. 94.\r\n\r\n     EMBLEY, _Oct._ 7. What have I done the last three months? O happy,\r\n     happy six weeks at the Hurst, where (from July 15 to Sept. 1) I had\r\n     found my business in this world. My heart was filled. My soul was\r\n     at home. I wanted no other heaven. May God be thanked as He never\r\n     yet has been thanked for that glimpse of what it is to _live_. Now\r\n     for the last five weeks my business has been much harder. They\r\n     don't know how weary this way of life is to me--this _table d'hôte_\r\n     of people.... When I want _Erfrischung_ I read a little of the\r\n     _Jahresberichte über die Diakonissen-Anstalt in Kaiserswerth_.\r\n     There is my home; there are my brothers and sisters all at work.\r\n     There my heart is, and there I trust one day will be my body;\r\n     whether in this state or in the next, in Germany or in England, I\r\n     do not care.\r\n\r\nThe \"happy six weeks at Lea Hurst\" were a time, as appears from the\r\nletter to Miss Nicholson already given (p. 53), when she found\r\nopportunity to do much sick-visiting. \"One's days pass away,\" she added\r\nin the same letter, \"like a shadow, and leave not a trace behind. How we\r\nspend hours that are sacred in things that are profane, which we choose\r\nto call necessities, and then say 'We cannot' to our Father's business.\"\r\nAt Embley the opportunities for work among the poor were less\r\nfavourable. The distances were greater. Florence interested herself, so\r\nfar as she was able, in the school at Wellow; and amongst her papers of\r\n1846 there is an able discussion of the defects of elementary education\r\nas she had there observed them. But the distractions were many. There\r\nwas a constant round of company at home; and, as has been said before,\r\nthe migrations of the family between London, Lea Hurst, and Embley were\r\nfatal to concentration of effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe year 1847 was one of much social movement in Miss Nightingale's\r\nlife. In the spring she was in London \"doing the exhibitions and\r\nhearing Jenny Lind; but it really requires a new language to define\r\nher.\" Then she went with her parents to the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Oxford, where Adams and Leverrier, the twin discoverers\r\nof Neptune, were the lions of the day. She wrote many lively accounts of\r\nthe meeting to her friends, from which a passage or two may be given:--\r\n\r\n     Here we are in the midst of loveliness and learning; for never\r\n     anything so beautiful as this place is looking now, my dearest,\r\n     have I seen abroad or at home, with its flowering acacias in the\r\n     midst of its streets of palaces. I saunter about the churchyards\r\n     and gardens by myself before breakfast, and wish I were a College\r\n     man. I wish you could see the Astronomical Section--Leverrier and\r\n     Adams sitting on either side of the President, like a pair of\r\n     turtle-doves cooing at their joint star and holding it between\r\n     them.... We work hard. Chapel at 8, to that glorious service at New\r\n     College; such an anthem yesterday morning! and that quiet cloister\r\n     where no one goes. I brought home a white rose to-day to dry in\r\n     remembrance. Sections from 11 to 3. Then Colleges or Blenheim till\r\n     dinner time. Then lecture at 8 in the Radcliffe Library. And\r\n     philosophical tea and muffins at somebody's afterwards. The\r\n     Fowlers, Hamilton Grays, Barlows and selves are the muffins;\r\n     Wheatstone, Hallam, Chevalier, Monckton Milnes and some of the\r\n     great guns occasionally are the philosophy....\r\n\r\nand so forth, and so forth; with particulars of \"church every two hours\"\r\non Sunday, and of a luncheon with Buckland and his famous menagerie at\r\nChrist Church, when Florence petted a little bear, and her father drew\r\nher away, but Mr. Milnes mesmerised it. \"And one thing more,\" she adds;\r\n\"Mr. Hallam's discovery that Gladstone is the Beast 666 (in the\r\nRevelations) came to him one day by inspiration in the Athenæum, after\r\nhe had tried Pusey and Newman, and found that they wouldn't do.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale paid many visits during the same year with her father.\r\nThey went, for instance, to Lord Sherborne, whose daughter, Mrs.\r\nPlunkett, became a great friend of hers; and they spent a couple of days\r\nwith Lord Lovelace. Lady Lovelace, Byron's daughter, conceived a great\r\nadmiration for Florence Nightingale, which found expression in the\r\nverses already quoted. It was in this year that Miss Clarke married her\r\nold admirer, M. Mohl. Florence's letter of congratulation was not\r\nwithout significance upon the state of her own feelings, as will be seen\r\nin a later chapter:--\r\n\r\n     EMBLEY, _October_ 13 [1847]. DEAREST FRIEND--To think that you are\r\n     now a two months' wife, and I have never written to tell you that\r\n     your piece of news gave me more joy than I ever felt in all my\r\n     life, except once, no, not even excepting that once, because _that_\r\n     was a game of Blind-man's-Buff,--and in _your_ case you knew even\r\n     as you were known. I had the news on a Sunday from dear Ju, and it\r\n     was indeed a Sunday joy and I kept it holy, though not like the\r\n     city, which was to be in cotton to be looked at _only_ on Sundays.\r\n     As has often been said, we must all take Sappho's leap, one way or\r\n     other, before we attain to her repose--though some take it to\r\n     death, and some to marriage, and some again to a new life even in\r\n     this world.\r\n\r\n     Which of them to the better part, God only knows. Popular prejudice\r\n     gives it in favour of marriage. Should we not look upon marriage,\r\n     less as an absolute blessing, than as a remove into another and\r\n     higher class of this great school-room--a promotion--for it is a\r\n     promotion, which creates new duties, before which the coward\r\n     sometimes shrinks, and gives new lessons, of more advanced\r\n     knowledge, with more advanced powers to meet them, and a much\r\n     clearer power of vision to read them. In your new development of\r\n     life, I take, dearest friend, a right fervent interest, and bless\r\n     you with a right heartfelt and earnest love.\r\n\r\n     We are only just returned to Embley, after having passed through\r\n     London, on our way from Derbyshire. News have I none, excepting\r\n     financial, for no one could talk of anything in London excepting\r\n     the horrid quantity of failures in the City, by which all England\r\n     has suffered more or less. Why didn't I write before? Because I\r\n     thought you would rather be let alone at first and that you were on\r\n     your travels.\r\n\r\n     And now for my confessions. I utterly abjure, I entirely renounce\r\n     and abhor, all that I may have said about M. Robert Mohl, not\r\n     because he is now your brother-in-law, but because I was so moved\r\n     and touched by the letters which he wrote after your marriage to\r\n     Mama; so anxious they were to know more about you, so absorbed in\r\n     the subject, so eager to prove to us that his brother was _such_ a\r\n     man, he was quite sure to make you happy.\r\n\r\n     And I have not said half enough either upon that score, not\r\n     anything that I feel; how \"to marry\" is no impersonal verb, upon\r\n     which I am to congratulate you, but depends entirely upon the\r\n     Accusative Case which it governs, upon which I do wish you\r\n     heartfelt and trusting joy. In single life the stage of the Present\r\n     and the Outward World is so filled with phantoms, the phantoms, not\r\n     unreal tho' intangible, of Vague Remorse, Tears, dwelling on the\r\n     threshold of every thing we undertake alone, Dissatisfaction with\r\n     what is, and Restless Yearnings for what is not, cravings after a\r\n     world of wonders (which _is_, but is like the chariot and horses of\r\n     fire, which Elisha's frightened servant could not see, till his\r\n     eyes were opened)--the stage of actual life gets so filled with\r\n     these that we are almost pushed off the boards and are conscious of\r\n     only just holding on to the foot lights by our chins, yet even in\r\n     that very inconvenient position love still precedes joy, as in St.\r\n     Paul's list, for love laying to sleep these phantoms (by assuring\r\n     us of a love so great that we may lay aside all care for our own\r\n     happiness, not because it is of _no_ consequence to us, whether we\r\n     are happy or not, as Carlyle says, but because it is of so much\r\n     consequence to another) gives that leisure frame to our mind, which\r\n     opens it at once to joy.\r\n\r\n     But how impertinently I ramble on--\"You see a penitent before you,\"\r\n     don't say \"I see an impudent scoundrel before me\"--But when thou\r\n     seest, and what's more, when thou readest, forgive.--You will not\r\n     let another year pass without our seeing you. M. Mohl gives us\r\n     hopes, in his letter to Ju, that you won't, that you will come to\r\n     England next year for many months, then, dearest friend, we will\r\n     have a long talk out. If not, we really must come to Paris--and\r\n     then I shall see you, and see the Deaconesses too, whom you so\r\n     kindly wrote to me about, but of whom I have never heard half\r\n     enough....\r\n\r\n     The Bracebridges are at home--she rejoiced as much as we did over\r\n     your event--Parthe is going at the end of November to do\r\n     Officiating Verger to a friend of ours on a like event.--Her\r\n     prospects are likewise so satisfactory, that I can rejoice and\r\n     sympathize under any form she may choose to marry in. Otherwise I\r\n     think that the day will come, when it will surprise us as much, to\r\n     see people dressing up for a marriage, as it would to see them put\r\n     on a fine coat for the Sacrament. Why should the Sacrament or Oath\r\n     of Marriage be less sacred than any other?\r\n\r\nThe letter goes on to speak of a visit recently paid to Mrs. Archer\r\nClive, well known in her day as the authoress of _Poems by V._ and of\r\n_Paul Ferroll_, a sensational novel of some force,--a lady whose powers\r\nof heart and mind were housed in an infirm body. Miss Nightingale\r\nadmired her talents and her character, and valued her friendship.\r\n\r\nBut new friendships and varied interests did not bring satisfaction to\r\nMiss Nightingale. She was still constantly bent on pursuing a vocation\r\nof her own. Her parents caught eagerly at an opportunity which offered\r\nitself at the end of this year (1847), for giving, as they hoped, a new\r\nturn to her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                        A WINTER IN ROME; AND AFTER\r\n\r\n                                (1847-1849)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Six months of Rome and happiness.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (1848).\r\n\r\nIt was an event of some importance in the Nightingale family when\r\nFlorence set out with Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, in the autumn of 1847,\r\nto spend the winter at Rome. The attraction to her was the society of\r\nMrs. Bracebridge, the friend of whom she spoke as \"her Ithuriel.\"\r\nMoreover the mental unrest from which Florence constantly suffered at\r\nhome was beginning to tell upon her health. \"All that I want to do in\r\nlife,\" she wrote to her cousin Hilary, in explaining the motive of the\r\ntour, \"depends upon my health, which, I am told, a winter in Rome will\r\nestablish for ever.\" She took the foreign tour as a tonic to enable her\r\nthe better to fulfil her vocation. By her parents and her sister the\r\ntour was regarded as a tonic which might divert her from it. They hoped\r\nthat foreign travel would distract her thoughts, and dispel what they\r\nperhaps considered morbid fancies. She would enjoy pleasant\r\ncompanionship. She would see famous and beautiful things. She might\r\nreturn converted to the more comfortable belief that her duty lay in\r\naccepting life as she found it. The point of view comes out clearly\r\nenough in a letter from her sister to Miss Bonham Carter:--\r\n\r\n     EMBLEY, _October_ [1847]. It is a very great pleasure to think of\r\n     her with such a companion, one who, she says, lives always with the\r\n     best part of her; one who has all the sense and discretion and the\r\n     warm-hearted sympathy and the quick enjoyment and the taste and the\r\n     affection which will most give her happiness; who will value her\r\n     and take care of her, and do her all the good mentally and bodily\r\n     one can fancy. Yes, dear, God is very good to provide such a\r\n     pleasant time, and it will rest her mind, I think, entirely from\r\n     wearing thoughts that all men have at home when their duties weigh\r\n     much on their consciences, while she will feel she is wasting nothing;\r\n     for Mrs. Bracebridge has not been at all well and Flo will _feel_\r\n     herself a comfort and a help to her, I hope, for I know she _is_ a\r\n     great one.... Though it is but for so short a time, yet it seems to me\r\n     a great event, the solemn first launching her into life, and my heart\r\n     is very full of many feelings, but yet the joy is greatest by an\r\n     incalculable deal, for one does not see how harm can come to her. Yet\r\n     when one loves a great deal, one cannot but be a little anxious.... It\r\n     is so pretty to see Papa wandering over the big map of Rome\r\n     remembering every corner, and Mama over Piranesi, and both over all\r\n     the fair things that dwell there as tho' they had just left them.\r\n\r\nAnd Florence herself did find comfort and pleasure in the tour; but it\r\nwas destined not to divert, but to strengthen, her purpose, as also to\r\nlay a train of circumstances which was to lead her to the Crimea.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlorence and her companions reached Paris on October 27, took ship at\r\nMarseilles for Civita Vecchia, and stayed in Rome--in the Via S.\r\nBastinello (No. 8)--from the beginning of November till March 29, 1848.\r\nFlorence entered heartily into all the pursuits and occupations of\r\nelegant tourists in Rome. She studied the ruins; explored the catacombs;\r\ncopied inscriptions; visited the churches and galleries; spent a morning\r\nin Gibson's studio and another in Overbeck's; collected plants in the\r\nColosseum; rode in the Campagna, and bought brooches, mosaics, and Roman\r\npearls. Her father had drawn out a programme of famous sights and pretty\r\nwalks and drives; and the methodical Florence duly ticked them off on\r\nthe list. She read her own thoughts and aspirations into many of the\r\nworks of art. She greatly admired the Apollo Belvedere, seeing in it the\r\ntype of triumphant Free Will. \"We can never lose the recollection of our\r\npoor selves while we still do things with difficulty, while we are still\r\nuncertain whether we shall succeed or not. The triumph of success may be\r\ngreat and delightful, but the divine life--eternal life--is when to\r\nwill is to do, when the will is the same thing as the act, and therefore\r\nthe act is unconscious.\" Of the Jupiter of the Capitol, again, she says:\r\n\"Jupiter is that perfect grace in power where the divine _Will_, pure\r\nfrom exertion, speaks, and It is done.\" But what chiefly interested her,\r\nwhat really impressed her mind and stimulated her imagination, was the\r\ngenius of Michael Angelo:--\r\n\r\n     (_To her Sister._) _December_ 17 [1847]. Oh, my dearest, I have had\r\n     such a day--my red Dominical, my Golden Letter, the 15th of\r\n     December is its name, and of all my days in Rome this has been the\r\n     most happy and glorious. Think of a day alone in the Sistine Chapel\r\n     with [Greek: S] [Selina, Mrs. Bracebridge], quite alone,\r\n     without custode, without visitors, looking up into that heaven of\r\n     angels and prophets.... I did not think that I was looking at\r\n     pictures, but straight into Heaven itself, and that the faults of\r\n     the representation and the blackening of the colours were the\r\n     dimness of my own earthly vision, which would only allow me to see\r\n     obscurely, indistinctly, what was there in all its glory to be\r\n     known even as I was known, if mortal eyes and understandings were\r\n     cleared from the mists which we have wilfully thrown around them.\r\n     There is Daniel, opening his windows and praying to the God of his\r\n     Fathers three times a day in defiance of fear. You see that young\r\n     and noble head like an eagle's, disdaining danger, those glorious\r\n     eyes undazzled by all the honours of Babylon. Then comes Isaiah,\r\n     but he is so divine that there is nothing but his own 53rd chapter\r\n     will describe him. He is the Isaiah, the \"_grosse Unbekannte_\" of\r\n     the Comfort ye, Comfort ye my people. I was rather startled at\r\n     first by finding him so young, which was not my idea of him at all,\r\n     while the others are old. But M. Angelo knew him better; it is the\r\n     perpetual youth of inspiration, the vigour and freshness, ever new,\r\n     ever living, of that eternal spring of thought which is typed under\r\n     that youthful face. Genius has no age, while mind (Zechariah) has\r\n     no youth. Next to Isaiah comes the Delphic Sibyl, the most\r\n     beautiful, the most inspired of all the Sibyls here; but the\r\n     distinction which M. Angelo has drawn even between _her_ and the\r\n     _Prophets_ is so interesting. There is a security of inspiration\r\n     about Isaiah; he is listening and he is speaking; \"that which we\r\n     _hear_ we declare unto you.\" There is an anxiety, an effort to hear\r\n     even, about the Delphian; she is not quite sure; there is an\r\n     uncertainty, a wistfulness in her eyes; she expects to be rewarded\r\n     rather in another stage than this for her struggle to gain the\r\n     prize of her high calling, to reach to the Unknown that Isaiah\r\n     knows already. There is no uncertainty as to her feeling of being\r\n     called to hear the voice, but she fears that her earthly ears are\r\n     heavy and gross, and corrupt the meaning of the heavenly words. I\r\n     cannot tell you how affecting this anxious look of her far-reaching\r\n     eyes is to the poor mortals standing on the pavement below, while\r\n     the Prophets ride secure on the storm of Inspiration.... I feel\r\n     these things to be part of the word of God, of the ladder to\r\n     Heaven. The word of God is all by which He reveals His thought, all\r\n     by which He makes a manifestation of Himself to men. It is not to\r\n     be narrowed and confined to one book, or one nation; and no one can\r\n     have seen the Sistine without feeling that he has been very near to\r\n     God, that he will understand some of His words better for ever\r\n     after; and that Michael Angelo, one of the greatest of the sons of\r\n     men, when one looks at the dome of St. Peter's on the one hand and\r\n     the prophets and martyrs on the other, has received as much of the\r\n     breath of God, and has done as much to communicate it to men, as\r\n     any Seer of old. He has performed that wonderful miracle of giving\r\n     form to the breath of God, wonderful whether it is done by words,\r\n     colours, or hard stones....\r\n\r\nThe thoughts and emotions which have been suggested by the contemplation\r\nof the vault of the Sistine Chapel are countless. None are more\r\nenthusiastic than those which it inspired in Florence Nightingale, and\r\nfew have been so discriminating. It is at once the privilege and a mark\r\nof consummate works of art to be capable of as many meanings as they may\r\nfind of competent spectators. Each man brings to the study of them the\r\ninsight of which he is capable; and each, perchance, finds in them some\r\nimage of himself or of his own experience. \"There are few moments, most\r\nprobably,\" Florence Nightingale went on to say, \"which we shall carry\r\nwith us through the gate of Death, few recollections which will stand\r\nthe Eternal Light.\" She felt as she came out of the Sistine Chapel that\r\nher first sight of Michael Angelo's stupendous work would be one of\r\nthose few for her. We may surmise that the wistful uncertainty which she\r\nfound in the face of the Delphic Sibyl had especially appealed to her in\r\nits truth to life as she had experienced it; conscious as she was of a\r\ncall from God, conscious also as she could not but have been of great\r\npowers, and yet doubtful whether on this side of the gate of Death it\r\nwould be given to her to interpret the Divine voice aright. She\r\nretained to the end of her life the same reverential feeling for Michael\r\nAngelo. She had photographs and engravings of the Sistine ceiling\r\nhanging in her rooms, and she sent some framed and inscribed photographs\r\nof the symbolical figures on the Medici tombs to hang at Embley on the\r\nlittle private staircase, where her father fell and died. Those at her\r\nhome were bequeathed specifically in her Will.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of the day on which the revelation of the Sistine Chapel\r\ncame to her was spent by Florence and her friend in walking up the Monte\r\nMario, to enjoy the famous view from the Villa Mellini, not then, as\r\nnow, included within a fort:--\r\n\r\n     \"We spent an exquisite half-hour,\" she wrote, \"mooning, or rather\r\n     sunning about; the whole Campagna and city lying at our feet, the\r\n     sea on one side like a golden laver below the declining sun, the\r\n     windings of the Tiber and the hills of Lucretilis on the other, with\r\n     Frascati, Tivoli, Tusculum on their cypress sides, for in that clear\r\n     atmosphere you could see the very cypresses of Maecenas' villa at\r\n     Tivoli; with long stripes of violet and pomegranate coloured light\r\n     sweeping over the plain like waves; one stone pine upon the edge of\r\n     our Mellini hill; and Rome, the fallen Babylon, like a dead city\r\n     beneath, no sound of multitudes ascending, but the only life these\r\n     great crimson lights and shadows (for here the shadow of a red light\r\n     is violet) like the carnation-coloured wings of angels, themselves\r\n     invisible, flapping over the plain and leaving this place behind them.\r\n     We rushed down as fast as we could for the sun was setting, and we\r\n     reached St. Peter's just as the doors were going to close. We had the\r\n     great Church all to ourselves, the tomb of St. Peter wreathed with\r\n     lights. It felt like the times when a Christian knight watched by\r\n     his arms before some great enterprise at the Holy Sepulchre; and\r\n     one shadowy white angel we could see through the windows over the\r\n     great door; and do you know he quite made us startle as he stood there\r\n     in the gloaming. Of course it was the marble statue on the facade; and\r\n     there were workmen still laughing and talking at the extreme end, and\r\n     their sounds, as they were repeated under the long vaults, were like\r\n     the gibbering of devils, and their lanthorns, as they wavered along\r\n     close to the ground, were like corpse-lights. I thought of St. Anthony\r\n     and holy knights and their temptations. And at last the Sacristan took\r\n     us out of that vast solemn dome through a _tomb_! and we glided into\r\n     the silvery moonlight, and walked home over Ponte St. Angelo, where I\r\n     made a little invocation to St. Michael to help me to thank; for why\r\n     the Protestants should shut themselves out, in solitary pride, from\r\n     the Communion of Saints in heaven and in earth, I never could\r\n     understand. And so ended this glorious day.\"\r\n\r\nThe obsession of Rome, which sooner or later comes upon every\r\nintelligent visitor to the Eternal City, dated in the case of Florence\r\nNightingale from this golden-letter day. She surmounted the sense of\r\nconfusion which sometimes oppresses the traveller. \"I do not feel,\" she\r\nwrote, \"though Pagan in the morning, Jew in the afternoon, and Christian\r\nin the evening, anything but a unity of interest in all these\r\nrepresentations. To know God we must study Him as much in the Pagan and\r\nJewish dispensations as in the Christian (though that is the last and\r\nmost perfect manifestation), and this gives unity to the whole--one\r\ncontinuous thread of interest to all these pearls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe politics of modern Italy interested her no less than the ruins of\r\nancient Rome or the monuments of mediæval art. She had met many Italian\r\nrefugees, both at Geneva and in the _salon_ of Madame Mohl in Paris, and\r\nwas a whole-hearted enthusiast in the cause of Italian freedom. Her\r\npresent visit to Rome synchronized with that curious and short-lived\r\nepisode in the struggle during which Pio Nono was playing \"the\r\nineffectual tragedy of Liberal Catholicism.\" All Rome seemed seized with\r\nsympathy for the cities beyond the Papal states, which were fighting for\r\nliberty, and within the states themselves Pio Nono's offerings of mild\r\nbenevolence sufficed to call forth \"floods of ecstatic, demonstrative\r\nItalian humanity, torchlight processions, and crowds kneeling at his\r\nfeet.\"[38] Miss Nightingale saw the Roman nobles, Prince Corsini, Prince\r\nGaetano, and others, presiding at \"patriotic altars,\" which had been set\r\nup in the public squares for the receipt of gifts in money and in\r\njewellery. She heard the famous Father Gavazzi preach the crusade in the\r\nColosseum. She cheered as the Tricolor of Italy was hoisted on the\r\nCapitol. \"I certainly was born,\" she wrote to her cousin Hilary, \"to be\r\na tag-rag-and-bob-tail, for when I hear of a popular demonstration, I am\r\nnothing better than a ragamuffin.\" She heard the rumble of a distant\r\ndrum, and rushed up for Mr. Bracebridge, and he and she broke their own\r\nwindows because they were not illuminated; stayed to see the torchlight\r\nprocession of patriots singing the hymn to Pio Nono, and were rewarded\r\nby the crowd crying \"God save the Queen,\" as they passed the English\r\n\"milord\" and his companion. \"Very touching,\" she said; \"though royalty\r\nwas the very last thing I was thinking of\"; for at this time, as she\r\noften avowed in her letters, her sympathies were Republican. \"When this\r\nmemorable year began with all its revolutions,\" she wrote later to\r\nMadame Mohl, after disillusion had come (June 27), \"I thought that it\r\nwas the Kingdom of Heaven coming under the fate of a Republic. But alas!\r\nthings have shown that more of us must slowly ripen to angels here,\r\nbefore the régime of the angels, _i.e._ the Kingdom of Heaven, will\r\nbegin.\" But for the moment everything seemed radiant. She recorded with\r\npleasure in February that a deputation of Romans had gone up to the Pope\r\nto express their \"complete confidence in him.\" In her note-books she\r\ncollected particulars of his life and character; and when in March he\r\ngranted what can only be called a sort of a Constitution, she wrote to\r\nMadame Mohl: \"My dear Santo Padre seems doing very well. He has given up\r\nhis Temporal Power. No man took it from him; he laid it down of himself.\r\nI think that he will reign in history as the only prince who ever did,\r\nand that his character is nearer Christ's than any I ever heard of.\"\r\nHistory will hardly confirm this saying; but if Miss Nightingale's words\r\nseem ill-balanced in the light of subsequent events, let it be\r\nremembered that, as Mr. Trevelyan says, \"the cult of Pio Nono was for\r\nsome months the religion of Italy, and of Liberals and exiles all over\r\nthe world. Even Garibaldi in Monte Video, and Mazzini in London, shared\r\nthe enthusiasm of the hour.\" A year later, when the Roman Republic had\r\nbeen declared and the Pope had fled, and the French troops besieged Rome\r\non his behalf, Miss Nightingale had only pity for Pio Nono; her anger\r\nshe reserved for the French \"cannibals,\" for the one Republic that was\r\ndevouring another. \"I must exhale my rage and indignation,\" she wrote in\r\na diary (June 30, 1849), \"before I have lost all notions of absolute\r\nright and wrong. It makes my heart bleed that the French nation, the\r\nnation above all others capable of an ideal, of aspiring after the\r\nabstract right, should have lent itself to such a brutal crime against\r\nits own brother--one may say its own offspring, for the Roman Republic\r\nsprang from the French; it is purest cannibalism; this breaks my heart.\r\nWhen I think of that afternoon at Villa Mellini (now occupied by a\r\nFrench general), of Rome, bathed in her crimson and purple shadows,\r\nlying at our feet, and St. Michael spreading his wings over all--the\r\nAngel of Regeneration as we thought him then--my eyes fill with tears.\r\nBut he will be the Angel of Regeneration yet.\" The French, she said,\r\nmight reduce the city and occupy it; but the heroic defence of the\r\nRepublic \"will have raised the Romans in the moral scale, and in their\r\nown esteem.\" They would never sink back to what they had been. Sooner or\r\nlater, Rome would be free. She was especially indignant at the talk\r\nwhich she heard on all sides in cultivated society at home about the\r\n\"vandalism\" of the Romans in exposing their precious monuments of art to\r\nassault. She loved those monuments, as we have seen; but if the defence\r\nof Rome against the French required it, she would have been ready to see\r\nthem all levelled to the ground. \"They must carry out their defence to\r\nthe last,\" she cried. \"I should like to see them fight the streets, inch\r\nby inch, till the last man dies at his barricade, till St. Peter's is\r\nlevel with the ground, till the Vatican is blown into the air. Then\r\nwould this be the last of such brutal, not house-breakings, but\r\ncity-breakings; then, and not till then, would Europe do justice to\r\nFrance as a thief and a murderer, and a similar crime be rendered\r\nimpossible for all ages. If I were in Rome, I should be the first to\r\nfire the Sistine, turning my head aside, and Michael Angelo would cry,\r\n'Well done,' as he saw his work destroyed.\" It was not only in relation\r\nto the restraints of conventional domesticity that Florence Nightingale\r\nwas a rebel.\r\n\r\n  [38] G. M. Trevelyan, _Garibaldi's Defence of the Roman Republic_,\r\n       p. 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nDuring her own stay in Rome, however, there was something which\r\ninterested her more than Roman politics or Roman monuments. It was the\r\nphilanthropic work of a Convent School. Every visitor to Rome knows the\r\nTrinità de' Monti. The flight of steps between the church and the Piazza\r\ndi Spagna is celebrated alike for its own beauty and for the\r\nflower-girls and women in peasant-costume who frequent it. The church\r\nitself contains many fine works of art, and the choral service is one of\r\nthe attractions of ecclesiastical Rome. The neighbourhood is rich in\r\nartistic and literary associations. Florence Nightingale had sympathetic\r\neyes and ears for all these things; but what attracted her most was the\r\nconvent attached to the church, with its school for girls, and (in\r\nanother part of the city) its orphanage. She was broad-minded, as we\r\nhave seen in an earlier chapter, in relation to church creeds. It was by\r\nworks, not faith, or at any rate by faith issuing in works, that she\r\nweighed the churches. It was characteristic of the thoroughness of her\r\nmental character that during this sojourn in Rome she made a methodical\r\nstudy of Roman doctrine and ritual. Among her papers and note-books\r\nbelonging to this time, there are careful analyses of the theory of\r\nIndulgence, of the Real Presence, of the Rosary, and so forth. She made,\r\ntoo, a careful collation of the Latin Breviary with the English\r\nPrayer-Book. She summed up her comparative study of the churches in this\r\ngeneralization: \"The great merit of the _Catholic Church_: its assertion\r\nof the truth that God still inspires mankind as much as ever. Its great\r\nfault: its limiting this inspiration to itself. The great merit of\r\n_Protestantism_: its proclamation of freedom of conscience within the\r\nlimits of the Scriptures. Its great fault: its erection of the Bible\r\ninto a master of the soul.\" Her deep sense of the self-responsibility of\r\nevery human soul kept her free from any inclination to Roman doctrine;\r\nbut she was profoundly impressed by the practical beneficence of Roman\r\nsisterhoods. An example of such beneficence she found in the school and\r\norphanage of the Dames du Sacré C[oe]ur. She had picked up a poor girl\r\ncalled Felicetta Sensi, and procured her admission as a free boarder,\r\npaying for her care and education for many years. She formed a warm\r\nattachment to the Lady Superior, the Madre Sta. Colomba. She studied the\r\norganization, rules, and methods of the large school, and for ten days\r\nshe went into Retreat in the Convent.[39] Her intercourse with the Madre\r\nSta. Colomba, of whose talk and spiritual experiences she made full and\r\ndetailed notes, made a very deep impression on her mind. She studied\r\nrules and organization, but, as in all her studies, she was seeking a\r\nmotive, as well as, and indeed more than, a method. Many years later, a\r\nfriend wrote to her: \"It seems to me that the greatest want among nurses\r\nis _devotion_. I use the word in a very wide sense, meaning that state\r\nof mind in which the current of desire is flowing towards one high end.\r\nThis does not presuppose knowledge, but it very soon attains it.\"[40]\r\nThis was a profound conviction of her own, often expressed, as we shall\r\nhear, in her Addresses and Letters of Exhortation in later years. What\r\nshe set herself to study at the Trinità de' Monti was the secret of\r\n_devotion_. She made notes of the Lady Superior's exhortations; of the\r\nspiritual exercises which were enjoined upon novices; of the forms and\r\ndiscipline of self-examination. She sought to extract the secret, and to\r\napply it to the inculcation of the highest kind of service to man as the\r\nservice of God. For many years the thought in her mind was to be the\r\nfoundation of some distinctive order or sisterhood; and though in the\r\nend she came to be glad that she had not done this, she never abandoned\r\nthe high ideal which was behind her thought. Nor, though in some ways\r\nand in some cases she came to be disillusioned about nursing\r\nsisterhoods, did she ever cease to speak with admiration of what she had\r\nseen and learnt in some of them. She thought more often, and with more\r\naffectionate remembrance, about the spirit of the best Catholic\r\nsisterhoods than of Kaiserswerth, or indeed of anything else in her\r\nprofessional experience.\r\n\r\n  [39] The Convent was giving hospitality at this time to the Abbess of\r\n       Minsk (in Lithuania), whose persecution by the Russian Government\r\n       formed the subject of much debate. Miss Nightingale wrote a long\r\n       account of the extraordinary adventures which the Abbess related to\r\n       her. She was advised in 1853 to print this, but I cannot find that\r\n       she did so.\r\n\r\n  [40] Letter from R. Angus Smith, July 7, 1859.\r\n\r\nIn such studies upon the Trinità de' Monti in the winter of 1847-48, she\r\nwas taken, as she said in a note of self-examination, out of all\r\ninterests that fostered her \"vanity\"; it was her \"happiest New Year.\"\r\n\"The most entire and unbroken freedom from dreaming I ever had,\" she\r\nwrote at a later time. \"Oh, how happy I was!\" And so again, looking back\r\nafter twenty years, she wrote: \"I never enjoyed any time in my life so\r\nmuch as my time at Rome.\"[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] Letter to M. Mohl, Nov. 21, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nAnother incident of Miss Nightingale's sojourn in Rome was destined,\r\nthough she knew it not at the time, to have a far-reaching influence\r\nupon her career. Among the English visitors who spent the winter of\r\n1847-48 in Rome were Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Herbert. Mr. Herbert had\r\nalready been Secretary at War under Peel, a post to which he was\r\nafterwards to return under Aberdeen. The resignation of Peel's Cabinet\r\nin 1846 released Mr. Herbert from official work. Later in the year he\r\nmarried a lady with whom he had been long acquainted, Elizabeth à Court,\r\ndaughter of General Charles Ashe à Court; and in the following year he\r\nand his wife set out for a long Continental tour. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBracebridge were friends of the Herberts, and thus Florence Nightingale\r\nmade their acquaintance in Rome. In her retrospect she specially\r\nrecalled the beginning there of her friendship with Sidney Herbert\r\n\"under the dear Bracebridges' wing.\" Compatriots who meet in this way in\r\nany foreign resort are apt to see a good deal of each other, and from\r\nthis winter dates the beginning of a friendship which was to be a\r\ngoverning factor in the life of Florence Nightingale. Sidney Herbert,\r\nwhen they met in galleries or at soirées, or rode together in the\r\nCampagna, must have been struck by Miss Nightingale's marked abilities,\r\nand for Mrs. Herbert she formed an affectionate attachment. She noted\r\n\"the great kindness, the desire of love, the magnanimous generosity\" of\r\nher new friend. Mr. and Mrs. Herbert saw much of Archdeacon Manning (the\r\nfuture cardinal), who was also spending the winter in Rome, and Miss\r\nNightingale was on friendly terms with him.[42] This also was an\r\nacquaintance which had some influence on her future career. Sidney\r\nHerbert, aided by the ready sympathy of his wife, was devoting much\r\nthought, now liberated from official duties, to schemes of benevolence\r\namong the poor on his estates. \"He felt strongly the disadvantage at\r\nwhich the poor were placed in being compelled after illness, and perhaps\r\nafter undergoing painful operations, to return in the earliest stage of\r\nconvalescence, without rest or change, to their accustomed labour.\"[43]\r\nHe was full of a scheme for a Convalescent Home and Cottage Hospital\r\n(such as is now no rarity, but was then almost unknown), and it can be\r\nimagined with what zest Miss Nightingale shared his thoughts. One of the\r\nfirst things which she records in her diary after return from the\r\nContinent is \"an expedition with Mrs. Sidney Herbert to set up her\r\nConvalescent Home at Charmouth\"; but this was only a passing incident,\r\nand return to the habitual home life, after the distraction of foreign\r\ntravel, left her no more contented than before.\r\n\r\n  [42] Purcell's _Life of Manning_, vol. i. p. 362.\r\n\r\n  [43] _Sidney Herbert_: _a Memoir_, by Lord Stanmore, vol. i. pp. 97-98.\r\n\r\nOn her return to London in the early summer of 1848 she sent her friends\r\noccasionally the talk of the town:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) _July_ 26 [1848]. In London there have been the\r\n     usual amount of Charity Balls, Charity Concerts, Charity Bazaars,\r\n     whereby people bamboozle their consciences and shut their eyes.\r\n     Nevertheless there does not seem the slightest prospect of a\r\n     revolution here. Why, would be hard to say, as England is surely\r\n     the country where luxury has reached its height and poverty its\r\n     depth. Perhaps it is our Poor Law, perhaps the strength of our\r\n     Middle Class, perhaps a greater degree of sympathy between the rich\r\n     and poor, which is the conservative principle. Lord Ashley had a\r\n     Chartist deputation with him the other day, who stayed to tea and\r\n     talked with him for five hours. \"That a man should ride in a\r\n     carriage and have twenty thousand a year is contrary to the laws of\r\n     Nature,\" said their leader, and slapped his leg. \"I could show you,\r\n     if you would go with me to-night,\" said Lord Ashley, \"people who\r\n     would say to _you_, that a man should go in broadcloth and wear a\r\n     shirt-pin (pointing to the Chartist's shirt) is contrary to the\r\n     laws of Nature.\" The Chartist was silent. \"And it was the only\r\n     thing I said,\" says Lord Ashley, \"after arguing with them for five\r\n     hours which made the least impression.\"\r\n\r\nHer acquaintance with Lord Ashley (afterwards Lord Shaftesbury) brought\r\nher in touch with Ragged School work. But society grew more and more\r\ndistasteful to Miss Nightingale. She explained the reasons in a letter\r\nto her \"Aunt Hannah.\" Why could she not smile and be gay, while yet\r\nbiding her time and not forsaking her ultimate ideals? It was, she said,\r\nbecause she \"hated God to hear her laugh, as if she had not repented of\r\nher sin.\" There is something obviously morbid in such words, and they\r\nmight be multiplied indefinitely, if there were good reason for doing\r\nso, from her letters, diaries, and note-books. The sins of which she\r\nmost often convicted herself were \"hypocrisy\" and \"vanity.\" She prayed\r\nto be delivered from \"the desire of producing an effect.\" That was the\r\n\"vanity\"; and it was \"hypocrisy,\" because she was playing a part,\r\nresponding to friends' conception of her, though all the while her heart\r\nwas really set on other things, and her true life was being lived\r\nelsewhere. The morbidness was a symptom of a mind at war with its\r\nsurroundings. Then again the kind \"Aunt\" reminded her, in the spirit of\r\nGeorge Herbert, that anything and everything may be done \"to the glory\r\nof God.\" But Miss Nightingale at this time was deep in the study of\r\npolitical economy; and \"can it be to the glory of God,\" she asked, \"when\r\nthere is so much misery among the poor, which we might be curing instead\r\nof living in luxury?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1848 an opportunity occurred which promised the\r\nrealization of the dearest wish of her heart, but once more she was\r\ndoomed to disappointment. Her mother and sister had been advised to go\r\nto Carlsbad for the cure. M. and Madame Mohl were to be at Frankfurt,\r\nand they were all to meet in that city. Frankfurt is near to\r\nKaiserswerth, and Florence was to be allowed to go there. But at the\r\nvery moment disturbances broke out in Frankfurt, and the whole plan was\r\nabandoned. \"I am not going to consign to paper for your benefit,\" she\r\nwrote to Madame Mohl (October 1848), \"all the cursings and swearings\r\nwhich relieved my disappointed feelings; for oh! what a plan of plans I\r\nhad made out for myself! All that I most wanted to do at Kaiserswerth,\r\nBrussels, and Co., lay for the first time within reach of my mouth, and\r\nthe ripe plum has dropped.\" Florence accompanied her mother to the cure\r\nat Malvern instead, where, with many prayers for humility under the will\r\nof God, she lived for several weeks upon the dry and bitter fruit of\r\ndisappointment. During the winter of 1848-49 Miss Nightingale saw\r\nsomething of M. Guizot and his family. The Minister had escaped to\r\nLondon after the fall of Louis Philippe, and was living in a modest\r\nhouse in Brompton. He found in Miss Nightingale \"a brave and sympathetic\r\nsoul, for whom great thoughts and great devotions had a serious\r\nattraction.\"[44]\r\n\r\n  [44] See the \"Lettre de M. Guizot\" prefixed to the French translation of\r\n       _Notes on Nursing_ (1862).\r\n\r\nDuring the next year she found some congenial work in London. She\r\ninspected hospitals. She worked in Ragged Schools. She spoke of her\r\n\"little thieves at Westminster\" as her \"greatest joy in London.\" But\r\nthese unconventional attractions of the London season set her all the\r\nmore against the life of country houses. \"Ought not one's externals,\"\r\nshe wrote in her diary (July 2, 1849), \"to be as nearly as possible an\r\nincarnation of what life really is? Life is _not_ a green pasture and a\r\nstill water, as our homes make it. Life is to some a forty days'\r\nfasting, moral or physical, in the wilderness; to some it is a fainting\r\nunder the carrying of the crop; to some it is a crucifixion; to all, a\r\nstruggle for truth, for safety. Life is seen in a much truer form in\r\nLondon than in the country. In an English country place everything that\r\nis painful is so carefully removed out of sight, behind those fine\r\ntrees, to a village three miles off. In London, at all events if you\r\nopen your eyes, you cannot help seeing in the next street that life is\r\nnot as it has been made to you. You cannot get out of a carriage at a\r\nparty without seeing what is in the faces making the lane on either\r\nside, and without feeling tempted to rush back and say, 'Those are my\r\nbrothers and sisters.'\" She longed to rush back, to be able to go out\r\nfreely into the slums, to comfort some old woman who was dying\r\nunattended, or rescue some child who was going astray untaught. But the\r\nproprieties prevented. \"It would never do,\" she was told, \"for a young\r\nwoman in her station in life to go out in London without a servant.\" In\r\nthe autumn of 1849 the distraction of another foreign tour was offered.\r\nHer parents and her sister hoped once more that Florence would return a\r\ndifferent and a more comfortable woman. Those with whom we are cast into\r\nthe nearest intimacy sometimes understand us least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                      FOREIGN TRAVEL: EGYPT AND GREECE\r\n\r\n                                (1849-1850)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 When o'er the world we range\r\n               'Tis but our climate, not our mind, we change.\r\n                                                          HORACE.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1849 Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, who were to spend some\r\nmonths in the East, again proposed that Miss Nightingale should travel\r\nwith them, and again the offer was gladly accepted. Her sister was\r\ndelighted. The expedition to Rome had not done what was hoped, but here\r\nwas a second chance. The sister reported to her friends that \"Flo had\r\ntaken tea with the Bunsens to receive the _dernier mot_ on Egyptology,\"\r\nand that she was going out \"laden with learned books.\" Perhaps Florence\r\nwould become absorbed in such studies, and adopt a life of gracefully\r\nlearned leisure. The literary temptation did, it is true, assail\r\nFlorence, but she put it behind her.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe party started in October, bound for Egypt, where the winter was to\r\nbe spent. Thence they were to proceed to Athens, where Mr. Bracebridge\r\nhad property. The return journey in the summer of 1850 was to be made\r\nthrough Germany, and Kaiserswerth was to be visited. Florence, we may\r\nsurmise, looked forward most to the last stage in the journey. On\r\nNovember 18 the travellers landed at Alexandria. On the 27th they\r\nreached Cairo. On December 4 they started in a dahabiah for the Nile\r\nvoyage. The boat was christened in honour of Florence's sister. \"My\r\nwork,\" she wrote, \"is making the pennant, blue bunting with swallow\r\ntail, a Latin red cross upon it, and [Greek: PARTHENOPÊ] in white tape.\r\nIt has taken all my tape, and a vast amount of stitches, but it will be\r\nthe finest pennant on the river, and my petticoats will joyfully\r\nacknowledge the tribute to sisterly affection, for sisterly affection in\r\ntape in Lower Egypt, let me observe, is worth having.\" They went up the\r\nriver as far as Ipsambul (Abu-Simbel), a little below Wady Halfy; on the\r\nreturn journey they spent several days at Thebes. The letters which\r\nFlorence sent home show that Egypt appealed strongly to her imagination.\r\nWhat struck her most was the solemnity of the country. \"Nothing ever\r\nlaughs or plays. Everything is grown up and grown old.\" The letters are\r\nfull too of Egyptology; for she had made tables of dynasties, copied\r\nplans of temples, and analysed the leading ideas in Egyptian mythology\r\nas expounded by the best writers of the time:--\r\n\r\n     ABU-SIMBEL, _January_ 17 [1850].... I passed through other halls,\r\n     till at last I found myself in a chamber in the rock, where sat, in\r\n     the silence of an eternal night, four figures against the further\r\n     end. I could see nothing more; yet I did not feel afraid as I did\r\n     at Karnak, though I was quite alone in these subterranean halls;\r\n     for the sublime expression of that judge of the dead had looked\r\n     down on me, the incarnation of the goodness of the deity, as Osiris\r\n     is; and I thought how beautiful the idea which placed him in the\r\n     foremost hall, and then led the worshipper gradually on to the more\r\n     awful attributes of the deity; for here, as I could dimly see\r\n     through the darkness, sat the creative power of the mind--Neph,\r\n     \"the intellect\"; Amun, \"the concealed god\"; Phthah, \"the creator of\r\n     the visible world\"; and Ra, \"the sustainer,\" Ra, \"the sun\" to whom\r\n     the temple is dedicated.... I turned to go out, and saw at the\r\n     further end the golden sand glittering in the sunshine outside the\r\n     top of the door; and the long sand-hill, sloping down from it to\r\n     the feet of the innermost Osirides, which are left quite free, all\r\n     but their pedestals, looked like the waves of time, gradually\r\n     flowing in and covering up these imperishable genii, who have seen\r\n     three thousand years pass over their heads and heed them not. In\r\n     the holiest place, there where no sound ever reaches, it is as if\r\n     you felt the sensible progress of time, not by the tick of a clock,\r\n     as we measure time, but by some spiritual pulse which marks to you\r\n     its onward march, not by its second, nor its minute, nor its\r\n     hour-hand, but by its century hand. I thought of the worshippers of\r\n     three thousand years ago; how they by this time have reached the\r\n     goal of spiritual ambition, have brought all their thoughts to\r\n     serve God or the ideal of goodness; how we stand there with the\r\n     same goal before us, only as distant as the star, which, a little\r\n     later, I saw rising exactly over that same sand-hill in the centre\r\n     of the top of the doorway, but as sure and fixed; how to them all\r\n     other thoughts are now as nothing, and the ideal we all pursue of\r\n     happiness is won; not because they have not probably sufferings,\r\n     like ours, but because they no longer suggest any other thought but\r\n     of doing God's will, which is happiness. I thought, too, three\r\n     thousand years hence, we might perhaps have attained--and others\r\n     would stand here, and still those old gods would be sitting in the\r\n     eternal twilight....\r\n\r\n     THEBES, _February_ 10 [1850].... The Valley of the Kings seems,\r\n     though within a mile of Thebes, as if one had arrived at the\r\n     mountains of Kaf, beyond which are only \"creatures unknown to any\r\n     but God,\"--so deep are the ravines, so high and blue the sky, so\r\n     absolutely solitary and unearthly, so utterly uninhabitable the\r\n     place. One look at that valley would give you more idea of the\r\n     supernatural, the gate of Hades, than all the descriptions, sacred\r\n     or profane. What a moment it is, the entering that valley, where in\r\n     those rocky caverns, the vastness and the gloomy darkness of which\r\n     are equally awful, the kings of the earth lie, each in his huge\r\n     sarcophagus, with the bodies of his chiefs, each in their chamber,\r\n     about him; and where, about this time, they are to return, to find\r\n     their bodies and resume their abode on earth,--if purified by their\r\n     three thousand years of probation, in a higher and better state; if\r\n     degraded, in a lower. I thought I met them at every turn in those\r\n     long subterraneous galleries,--saw their shades rising from their\r\n     shattered sarcophagi, and advancing once more towards the light of\r\n     day, which shone like a star, so distant and so faint, at the end\r\n     of that opening; the dead were stirred up, the chief ones of the\r\n     earth.... Well, these Pharaohs are perhaps now here, again in the\r\n     body, their three thousand years having just elapsed to some of\r\n     them,--that is, if they have philosophized sincerely, or, together\r\n     with philosophy, have \"loved beautiful forms.\" ... And if I were a\r\n     Pharaoh now, I would choose the Arab form, and come back to help\r\n     these poor people; and I am going to-morrow to a tomb of Rameses,\r\n     B.C. 1150, to meet him and tell him so....\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Miss Nightingale pitied the poor people; for the\r\nEgypt in which she travelled was as Mehemet Ali, the Lion of the Levant,\r\nhad left it. She saw girls sold in the open slave market \"at from £2 to\r\n£9 a head.\" She heard how justice was sold to the highest bidder; and\r\n\"everybody,\" she noted, \"seems to bastinado everybody else.\" \"Every\r\nman,\" she noted further, \"is a conscript for the army, and mothers put\r\nout their children's right eye to save them from conscription, till\r\nMehemet Ali, who was too clever for them, had a one-eyed regiment, who\r\ncarried the musket on the left shoulder.\" Miss Nightingale was fond of\r\nescaping from the dahabiah in order to wander about the desert, \"poking\r\nmy own nose,\" as she wrote home, \"into all the villages,\" and seeing for\r\nherself how \"these poor people\" lived. \"They call me 'the wild ass of\r\nthe wilderness, snuffing up the wind,' because I am so fond of getting\r\naway.\" Egyptian impressions stayed long in her memory, and they recurred\r\nto her thirty years later in connection with her Indian studies.[45] As\r\non her earlier visit to Rome, so now in Egypt she utilized all such\r\nopportunities as came in her way for studying the work of religious\r\nSisterhoods. At Alexandria she passed her days, she wrote, \"much to my\r\nsatisfaction, as I had travelled with two Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul\r\nfrom Paris to Auxerre, who gave me an introduction to the Sisters here;\r\nand I have spent a great deal of time with them in their beautiful\r\nschools and _Miséricorde_. There are only 19 of them, but they seem to\r\ndo the work of 90.\"\r\n\r\n  [45] _E.g._ in an article in _Good Words_, August 1879: \"Whoever in the\r\n       glorious light of an Egyptian sunset--where all glows with colour,\r\n       not like that of birds and flowers, but like transparent emeralds\r\n       and sapphires and rubies and amethysts, the gold and jewels and\r\n       precious stones of the Revelations--has seen the herds wending their\r\n       way home on the plain of Thebes by the colossal pair of sitting\r\n       statues, followed by the stately woman in her one draped garment,\r\n       plying her distaff, a naked, lovely little brown child riding on her\r\n       shoulder, and another on a buffalo, can conjure up something of the\r\n       ideal of the ryot's family life in India.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nIn April 1850 Miss Nightingale went with her friends to Athens. Their\r\nhouse was in Eucharis Street, and Florence \"slept in the library, which\r\nopens on to a terrace looking upon the back of the Acropolis.\" She had\r\nlittle taste for the topographical research and nice distinctions\r\nbetween different masters of sculpture which absorb the interest of many\r\nmodern travellers and students. She was interested in broader\r\nspeculations. The soul of a people, as expressed in their art, was the\r\nobject to which she directed her observation, and around which she loved\r\nto let her imagination play. In her note-books and letters she discusses\r\nthe spiritual conceptions embodied in the worship of the several Greek\r\ngods; she traces the symbols of Greek mythology to their sources in\r\nGreek scenery; she pictures the genius of Aeschylus (her favourite\r\ntragedian, preferred by her even to Shakespeare) or of Sophocles\r\ndeveloping in relation to local conditions and surroundings. Of the\r\nstatues, the pensive beauty of the sepulchral bas-reliefs most arrested\r\nher attention; and in architecture, she loved most the Doric, for its\r\nseverity, its simplicity, its perfection of proportion, its image of the\r\nideal republic:--\r\n\r\n     Only a republican could have conceived it, and it is sin for any\r\n     other government to imitate it. Look at each column--man, I\r\n     mean--rearing its noble head; yet none has a separate base. Each\r\n     man stands upon the common base of his country. Look at the\r\n     simplicity of the fluting of the capital. No man thinks of his own\r\n     adornment, but only of the glory of the whole. The fluting does not\r\n     look like its ornament, but its drapery. I do love the old _Doric_\r\n     as if it was a person. Then comes the _Ionic_, light and elegant\r\n     and airy, it is true, like the Attic wit, but somewhat luscious to\r\n     the taste; it soon palls; the fluting is too laboured, too\r\n     semicircular, like the people sitting in a semi-circle to hear the\r\n     wit of Aristophanes; it does not look as if it _belonged_ to the\r\n     column; and that ridge between the flutes, what is it doing there?\r\n     It looks like the interval while the next interlocutor is thinking\r\n     of a repartee. Then that rich beading round the base, like one of\r\n     Euripides' choruses which have nothing to do with the piece. Give\r\n     me the Ionic to amuse me, but the Doric to interest me. The\r\n     _Corinthian_ is like the worship of Dionysus, like the illustration\r\n     of Nature by Art--a bad conjunction, I think, which in any other\r\n     hands would become Art run mad, but modified by the exquisite\r\n     artistic perceptions of the Greeks is exquisitely beautiful, but it\r\n     is not architecture. The Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian are\r\n     the ethical, the poetical, and the aesthetic views of life. But\r\n     look at the workmanship of these things. How mathematically exact\r\n     it is--the very poetry of number.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the philosophical bent of her mind that she\r\nsought to refer the charm of the scenery to some general law:--\r\n\r\n     ATHENS, _June_ 8. I have been taking some lovely rides with Mr.\r\n     Hill on Hymettus, along the Daphne road, and to Karà. How lovely\r\n     the scenery is, would be difficult to describe, and why it is so\r\n     lovely. I begin to think that it is the proportion, and that there\r\n     must be proportion in the things of Nature as of Art. I am talking\r\n     nonsense, I believe, but nobody minds me, you know. In the valleys\r\n     of Switzerland the height is too great for the width, and it looks\r\n     like a bottle. In the valleys of Egypt the width is too great for\r\n     the height, and it looks like a tray. For this reason clouds are\r\n     provided in Switzerland and Scotland; the height would become\r\n     intolerably out of proportion unless it were covered in at the top.\r\n     For this reason clear sky is in Egypt, or you would feel in a\r\n     shelf. But here, where the clear sky is meant, they say, to be\r\n     perpetual (tho' I cannot say I have seen much of it since I came),\r\n     the proportion observed has been perfect, the exact curve is always\r\n     there, the exact slope which you want; and if a line were to change\r\n     its place, you feel the effect would be spoilt. You feel towards it\r\n     as to an architectural building. I believe that in this lies the\r\n     great peculiarity of the Athenian views. Otherwise, for colouring,\r\n     I must declare I have seen nothing like the evenings of the\r\n     Campagna.\r\n\r\nOf the Parthenon by moonlight she wrote that it was \"impossible that\r\nearth or heaven could produce anything more beautiful.\" In other letters\r\nshe dwells on the beauty of the view from Lycabettus, and the glory of\r\nthe sunset from Hymettus. One day upon the Acropolis she found some boys\r\nwith a baby owl that had just fallen from its nest in the Parthenon. She\r\nbought it from them and kept it. It used to travel in her pocket, and\r\nlived at Embley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nPublic affairs in Greece interested her also. She had arrived in Greek\r\nwaters at the height of the \"Pacifico crisis.\" There had been a rupture\r\nbetween England and Greece, which threatened also the relations between\r\nEngland and France, and which convulsed political parties at\r\nWestminster, over the claims of Mr. Finlay, the historian of modern\r\nGreece, and Don Pacifico, a native of Gibraltar. Lord Palmerston had\r\nordered the Mediterranean Fleet to the Peiraeus to enforce the British\r\nclaims, and Miss Nightingale was sitting beside Mr. Wyse, the British\r\nMinister at Athens, at dinner on board H.M.S. _Howe_, when the\r\nsubmission of the Greek Government was brought to him. Her home letters\r\nthrow much light on the ins and outs of this affair, which, however, is\r\nnow only remembered as the occasion of Lord Palmerston's vindication in\r\nthe House of Commons with its famous peroration about _Civis Romanus\r\nsum_. Miss Nightingale now, as earlier, was a strong Palmerstonian. \"The\r\nfriends of Broadlands,\" she wrote to her parents, \"need never have been\r\nless uneasy for his reputation\"; and if parliamentary success be a\r\nsufficient test, she was entirely right. She found herself again in the\r\nthick of political discussion on leaving Greek waters. Her party sailed\r\nfrom Athens on June 17, and went to Trieste by Corfu--\"that fairy\r\nisland,\" she wrote, \"where every flower grows twice as big as it does\r\nanywhere else, and where no frost can touch the olive and the\r\npomegranate.\" She and her parents were acquainted with Sir Henry Ward,\r\nthen Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. Sir Henry, who had\r\nbeen an active Liberal at home, had felt himself obliged to adopt\r\nsternly repressive measures in the islands. Miss Nightingale was opposed\r\nto his policy, as also to the British occupation. He invited her and her\r\nfriends to the Palace. She went to proffer excuses. \"He came out, said\r\nthat I had often called him 'Tyrant,' and took me in his arms like a\r\nfather, and stood over me in the character of Tyrant (he said) till I\r\nhad written a letter compelling them all to come, which he then sealed\r\nand I sent. So the whole _posse comitatus_ of us spent the day there,\r\nthey sending the carriage for us, and I am really glad to have seen what\r\nis my idea of Eastern luxury.\" The tyrant placed his accuser next to him\r\nat dinner, deplored his \"false position,\" and so forth, and they made\r\nsome sort of peace; though not perhaps till Miss Nightingale had sought\r\nto bring him to a conviction of sin for his executions and arbitrary\r\narrests, for she was armed, as her letters show, now as ever, with all\r\nthe facts and figures marshalled in Blue-book precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nHer mind was interested in all these things, but her heart was\r\nelsewhere. \"Wherever thou art,\" said a famous statesman, \"it is with the\r\npoor that thou should'st live.\" It was so with Florence Nightingale's\r\ninmost thoughts. Her greatest pleasure in Athens was found in the\r\nsociety of the American missionaries, Mr. and Mrs. Hill, who conducted a\r\nschool and orphanage. Of Mrs. Hill she wrote, \"From heaven she comes, in\r\nheaven she lives.\" In charge of the mission school was a Greek refugee\r\nfrom Crete, Elizabeth Kontaxaki, and with her too Florence Nightingale\r\nformed a warm friendship. Elizabeth had lived an adventurous life before\r\nshe found security at Athens. Her father had fallen by a Turkish bullet.\r\nHer mother had made an heroic escape from a Turkish captor, and the\r\nfirst years of the child's life were spent in the fastnesses of Mount\r\nIda. \"Alas,\" wrote Miss Nightingale, \"how worthless my life seems to me\r\nby the side of these women.\" A mood of great dejection appears in her\r\ndiary of this time, to which an attack of low-fever no doubt\r\ncontributed. She could not find satisfaction in the interests of foreign\r\ntravel. She was tortured by unsatisfied longings which could find outlet\r\nonly in a world of dreams. An entry in her diary for June 7 is in these\r\nwords: \"Grotto of the Eumenides. Will this Fury go on increasing till by\r\ndegrees my mind is more and more taken off the outer world with all its\r\nclaims, and I am no longer able to command my attention at all?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale and her friends landed at Trieste at the end of June,\r\nand thence made their way to Dresden and Berlin. The pictures which most\r\nimpressed her were Raphael's \"Sistine Madonna\" and the \"Reading\r\nMagdalen,\" then attributed to Correggio. A year later her mother and\r\nsister were at Dresden, and she enjoined them, above all things, to see\r\n\"the Magdalen, the queen of pictures.\" \"How I feel that picture now,\"\r\nshe wrote to them (August 26, 1851), \"dark wood behind, sharp stones in\r\nfront, nothing to look back upon, nothing to look forward to, clinging\r\nto the present as she does to the book, which beams bright light upon\r\nme. Oh what a history that picture contains in its little canvass; and\r\nhow well it hangs near that glorious Sistine Virgin. All that woman\r\n_might_ be, all that she will be, near what she _is_; for it is not a\r\nMagdalen, in the common sense of the word, or rather it is in the common\r\nsense of what woman commonly is--not what we mean by a Magdalen.\" At\r\nDresden Miss Nightingale was still in much dejection. \"I have never felt\r\nso bad,\" she wrote (July 7); \"the habit of living not in the present but\r\nin a future of dreams is gradually spreading over my whole existence. It\r\nis rapidly approaching the state of madness when dreams become\r\nrealities.\" And now when the goal of Kaiserswerth was near, she felt\r\nalmost unmanned; almost inclined to turn back and follow another path.\r\n\"It seemed to me now (July 10) as if quiet, with somebody to look for my\r\ncoming back, was all I wanted.\" But this was only a moment of passing\r\nweakness. At Berlin her spirits revived; for her vital interests were\r\nsatisfied, and she spent some days in inspecting the hospitals and other\r\nbenevolent institutions. On July 31 she reached Kaiserswerth. \"I could\r\nhardly believe I was there,\" she wrote in her diary. \"With the feeling\r\nwith which a pilgrim first looks on the Kedron, I saw the Rhine, dearer\r\nto me than the Nile.\" She stayed a fortnight with the Pastor and his\r\nwife and the Deaconesses, studying their institutions. \"Left\r\nKaiserswerth,\" says the diary (August 13), \"feeling so brave as if\r\nnothing could ever vex me again.\"[46] She rejoined her friends at\r\nDüsseldorf. \"They stayed at Ghent actually for me to finish my MS.\"\r\n(August 17). \"Finished my MS. They read it. Mr. Bracebridge corrected it\r\nand sent it off\" (August 19). Next day they returned to England. The\r\nmanuscript was of the pamphlet describing \"The Institution of\r\nKaiserswerth on the Rhine,\" which was issued anonymously soon after Miss\r\nNightingale's return.[47] Some notice of the pamphlet will be found in a\r\nlater chapter in connection with her longer sojourn at Kaiserswerth in\r\n1851. It was printed by the inmates of the Ragged School at Westminster\r\nin which she was interested. She described in it the work of the\r\nDeaconesses, and ended with an appeal to Englishwomen to go and do\r\nlikewise. The fire burnt within her, and she returned home more than\r\never resolved to consecrate her life to the service of the sick and\r\nsorrowful.\r\n\r\n  [46] In the Album of the Pastor's eldest daughter, Miss Nightingale left\r\n       this inscription:--\r\n\r\n            \"Vier Dinge, Gott, habe ich dir zu bieten,\r\n            Die sich in all deinen Schatzkammern nicht finden:\r\n            Meine Nichtigkeit, meine traurige Armut,\r\n            Meine verderbliche Sünde, meine ernste Reue.\r\n            Nimm diese Gaben an und nimm den Geber hin.\r\n\r\n       Kaiserswerth, den 13 August 1850.

Their hope, even their\r\nexpectation, was not unreasonable. Florence Nightingale was a woman of\r\nlearning, and her foreign travels had stimulated her alike to research\r\nand to imaginative thought. At home, too, during all the years of\r\nrestless and unsatisfied yearning for some other life, she had been a\r\ndiligent reader and student. She had a real gift for literary\r\nexpression, as her letters may already have indicated, and as her later\r\nwritings were to prove more decisively. She had, moreover, the instinct\r\nfor self-expression. She was a constant letter-writer and note-taker.\r\nShe communed with herself not only in speechless thought, but in written\r\nmemoranda. Had another impulse not been stronger within her, she might\r\neasily have become a literary woman of some distinction. But though she\r\nwas fond of writing for her own satisfaction, she had a profound\r\ndistrust of it as a substitute for action. Like one of George Eliot's\r\nheroines, \"she did not want to deck herself with knowledge--to wear it\r\nloose from the nerves and blood that fed her action.\" \"You ask me,\" she\r\nhad written to Miss Clarke in 1844, \"why I do not write something. I\r\nthink what is not of the first class had better not exist at all; and\r\nbesides I had so much rather live than write; writing is only a\r\nsupplement for living. Would you have one go away and 'give utterance\r\nto one's feelings' in a poem to appear (price 2 guineas) in the _Belle\r\nAssemblée_? I think one's feelings waste themselves in words; they ought\r\nall to be distilled into actions, and into actions which bring results.\r\nDo you think a babe would _ever_ learn to walk if it were to talk about\r\nits living in such 'strange times,' 'I _must_ learn to use my legs,' and\r\nso on? Or do you think anybody ever did anything, who did not go to it\r\nwith a directness of purpose, which prevented him from frittering away\r\nhis impressions in words?\" She was of Ibsen's persuasion:--\r\n\r\n                    What is Life? a fighting\r\n                    In heart and in brain with trolls.\r\n                    Poetry? that means writing\r\n                    Doomsday-accounts of our souls.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] _Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen_, translated by F. E. Garrett.\r\n\r\nShe held in great suspicion and dislike what she called the \"artist-like\r\nway of looking upon life.\" It reduces all religions, she said, and most\r\ninward and spiritual feelings \"into a sort of magic-lantern, with which\r\nto make play for the amusement of the company.\" Her mother used to\r\npraise her \"beautiful letters,\" was proud of the \"European reputation\"\r\nshe had won among learned men, and wanted to know why she could not be\r\nhappy in cultivating at home the gifts which God had given her. To\r\nFlorence Nightingale these things were not gifts to be cultivated, but\r\nrather temptations to be subdued. She read with some attention in 1846 a\r\nbook called _Passages from the Life of a Daughter at Home_, a religious\r\nwork containing counsels of submission for women dissatisfied with their\r\nhome life. \"Piling up miscellaneous instruction for oneself,\" she wrote\r\nin one place in the margin; \"the most unsatisfactory of all pursuits!\"\r\nShe strove to say to God, as she wrote in another place, \"Behold the\r\nhandmaid of the Lord! _not_ Behold the handmaid of correspondence, or of\r\nmusic, or of metaphysics!\" \"That power of always writing a good letter\r\nwhenever one likes,\" she said in one of her pages of self-examination,\r\n\"is a great temptation\"--a temptation, if such it be, to which, it must\r\nbe confessed, she continually succumbed. But she wished to win no repute\r\nfrom her fall. In 1854 her sister printed the \"beautiful letters\" from\r\nEgypt,[49] and issued a few copies for private circulation. Florence was\r\nnot pleased, but acquiesced, and corrected the proofs.\r\n\r\n  [49] Bibliography A, No. 2.\r\n\r\nAny dreams, then, which she may have harboured of literary distinction,\r\nshe had put resolutely away from her. \"Oh God,\" she had written in her\r\ndiary at Cairo, \"thou puttest into my heart this great desire to devote\r\nmyself to the sick and sorrowful. I offer it to thee. Do with it what is\r\nfor thy service.\" But there was still one other temptation to be\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                              THE SINGLE LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n     The craving for sympathy, which exists between two who are to form\r\n     one indivisible and perfect whole, is in most cases between man and\r\n     woman, in some between man and God. This the Roman Catholics have\r\n     understood and expressed under the simile, Christ the bridegroom,\r\n     the Nun married to Him, the Monk married to the Church; or as St.\r\n     Francis to poverty, or as St. Ignatius Loyola to the divine\r\n     mistress of his thoughts, the Virgin. This sort of tie between man\r\n     and God seems alone able to fill the want of the other, the\r\n     permanent exclusive tie between the one man and the one\r\n     woman.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE: _Suggestions for Thought_.\r\n\r\n\"I had three paths among which to choose,\" wrote Miss Nightingale in a\r\ndiary of 1850: \"I might have been a literary woman, or a married woman,\r\nor a Hospital Sister.\" We have seen how she turned away from the first\r\npath. Why did she reject the second?\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Our dear Flo,\" wrote Mrs. Bracebridge to Miss Clarke in 1844, \"has just\r\nrecovered from a severe cold, but I hear nothing of what I long for,\r\n_i.e._ some noble-hearted, true man, one who can love her as she\r\ndeserves to be loved, prepared to take her to a house of her own.\" And\r\nthree years later another friend, Fanny Allen, in describing a visit to\r\nEmbley, said of Florence: \"What a wife she would make for a man worthy\r\nof her! but I am not sure I yet know the mate fit for her.\" The two\r\nNightingale girls, she surmised, would experience a \"difficulty in\r\nfinding any one they would like well enough to forsake such a home.\"[50]\r\nIn the case of Florence, the position was ill understood by outsiders.\r\nTo her the home was not a happy garden which she would be very\r\nreluctant to forsake, but rather a gilded cage from which she eagerly\r\nsought a way of escape. To us who have the means of knowing her inmost\r\nthoughts and feelings, the question thus presents itself in another\r\nlight than that in which it appeared to her friends at the time. She\r\ncraved for a larger, fuller life than she could find at home. Why could\r\nshe not, or why did she not, seek it in marriage? It is love that\r\nsometimes \"frees the imprisoned spirit,\" that enables it to find and to\r\nexpress itself. That Miss Nightingale remained single was not the result\r\nof lack of opportunity to marry. The reason is to be found elsewhere--in\r\nfeelings, thoughts, and ideals, in reasoned convictions and aspirations,\r\nwhich, if I can present them aright, will illuminate her character and\r\nher career.\r\n\r\n  [50] _A Century of Family Letters_, vol. ii. pp. 106, 107.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Miss Nightingale, like the rest of the world, was reading\r\n_Middlemarch_, and a paper which she wrote in that year contained some\r\nnotice of George Eliot's heroine.[51] \"A novel of genius has appeared.\r\nIts writer once put before the world (in a work of fiction too),\r\ncertainly the most living, probably the most historically truthful,\r\npresentment of the great Idealist, Savonarola of Florence. This\r\nauthor now can find no better outlet for the heroine--also an\r\nIdealist--_because_ she cannot be a 'St. Teresa' or an 'Antigone,' than\r\nto marry an elderly sort of literary impostor, and, quick after him, his\r\nrelation, a baby sort of itinerant Cluricaune (see _Irish Fairies_) or\r\ninferior Faun (see Hawthorne's matchless _Transformation_). Yet close at\r\nhand, in actual life, was a woman--an Idealist too--and if we mistake\r\nnot, a connection of the author's, who has managed to make her ideal\r\nvery real indeed. By taking charge of blocks of buildings in poorest\r\nLondon, while making herself the rent-collector, she found work for\r\nthose who could not find work for themselves; she organized a system of\r\nvisitors; ... she brought sympathy and education to bear from individual\r\nto individual, ... so that one might be tempted to say, 'Were there one\r\nsuch woman with power to direct the flow of volunteer help, nearly\r\neverywhere running to waste, in every street of London's East End,\r\nalmost might the East End be persuaded to become Christian.' Could not\r\nthe heroine, the 'sweet sad enthusiast,' have been set to some such\r\nwork as this? Indeed it is past telling the mischief that is done in\r\nthus putting down youthful ideals. There are not too many to begin with.\r\nThere are few indeed to end with--even without such a gratuitous impulse\r\nas this to end them.\" In this passage, as in much that Florence\r\nNightingale wrote, there is an autobiographical note. She did not marry\r\nbecause she held fast to an ideal--an ideal nearer to that of Octavia\r\nHill than to that of Dorothea Brooke.\r\n\r\n  [51] _Fraser's Magazine_, May 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nFor two or three years Florence Nightingale was in much trouble of mind\r\nfrom an attachment which one of her cousins had formed for her. In no\r\ncase would she have thought it right to marry him. \"Accident or\r\nrelationship,\" she wrote some years later,[52] \"throw people together in\r\ntheir childhood, and acquaintance has grown up naturally and\r\nunconsciously. Accordingly in novels it is generally cousins who marry;\r\nand now it seems the only natural thing, the only possible way of making\r\nan intimacy. And yet we know that intermarriage between relations is in\r\ndirect contravention of the laws of nature for the well-being of the\r\nrace.\" It was supposed by some of the family circle at the time that\r\nthis was the only objection to an engagement; but there were others.\r\nFlorence was in no mood, then or afterwards, to marry for the sake of\r\nmarrying. Marriage, she had written to Miss Clarke (p. 66), was not an\r\nabsolute blessing; and though she liked her cousin, she was in no sense\r\nin love with him. She felt relief, intense and unmixed, as she recorded\r\nin her private meditations, when she learnt that the young man had at\r\nlast forgotten her. But though this episode left her heart-whole, it had\r\na great and painful influence upon her mind. \"Cleanse all my love from\r\nthe desire of creating an interest in another's heart\" is the burden of\r\nmany of her meditations.\r\n\r\n  [52] _Suggestions for Thought_, vol. ii. p. 401.\r\n\r\nAmong other attachments of which Florence Nightingale was the object,\r\nthere was one which had a deeper effect and called for a more difficult\r\nand searching choice in life. She was asked in marriage by one who\r\ncontinued for some years to press his suit. It was a proposal which\r\nseemed to those about her to promise every happiness. The match would by\r\nall have been deemed suitable, and by many might have been called\r\nbrilliant. And Florence herself was strongly drawn to her admirer. She\r\nhad not come to this state of mind in hasty inclination. She was on her\r\nguard against any such temptation. Many years before, in a letter to her\r\n\"brother Jonathan,\" as she called Miss Hilary Bonham Carter, she had\r\nwritten:--\r\n\r\n     It strikes me that in all the most unworldly poetry (both prose and\r\n     verse) _la passion qu'on appelle inclination_ is treated in a very\r\n     extraordinary way. When one finds a comparative stranger becoming\r\n     all of a sudden more essential to one than one's family (via\r\n     flattery, in general, of one sort or another), one is content with\r\n     saying to oneself, \"Oh! that's love,\" instead of saying, \"How\r\n     unjust and how blind this feeling is.\" I wonder whether if people\r\n     were to examine--for, as Socrates says, the life unexamined is not\r\n     a living life--they would not find that (whatever it may ripen to\r\n     afterwards) this feeling at first is generally begun by vanity or\r\n     jealousy or self-love; and that what is very much to be guarded\r\n     against, instead of submitted to, is the stranger's admiration (and\r\n     I suppose everybody has been susceptible at one time of their\r\n     lives) having more effect upon one than one's own family's.\r\n\r\nIn this case, however, the stranger's admiration had stood the test. She\r\nfelt drawn to him, not by vanity or self-love; but because she admired\r\nhis talents, and because the more she saw of him the greater pleasure\r\ndid she find in his society. She leaned more and more upon his sympathy.\r\nYet when the proposal first came, she refused it; and when it was\r\nrenewed, she persisted. Then, it may be said, she cannot have been \"in\r\nlove\" with him. And in one sense that is, I suppose, quite true; for\r\nlove, as the poets tell us, does not reason, and Florence Nightingale\r\nreasoned deeply over her case. But it is certain that she felt at least\r\nas much affection as suffices to make half the marriages in the world.\r\nShe turned away from a path to which she was strongly drawn in order to\r\npursue her Ideal.\r\n\r\nIn one of the many pages of autobiographical notes which she preserved\r\nin relation to this episode in her life, Miss Nightingale thus\r\nexplained her refusal to marry. \"I have an intellectual nature which\r\nrequires satisfaction, and that would find it in him. I have a passional\r\nnature which requires satisfaction, and that would find it in him. I\r\nhave a moral, an active nature which requires satisfaction, and that\r\nwould not find it in his life. I can hardly find satisfaction for any of\r\nmy natures. Sometimes I think that I will satisfy my passional nature at\r\nall events, because that will at least secure me from the evil of\r\ndreaming. But would it? I could be satisfied to spend a life with him\r\ncombining our different powers in some great object. I could not satisfy\r\nthis nature by spending a life with him in making society and arranging\r\ndomestic things.... To be nailed to a continuation and exaggeration of\r\nmy present life, without hope of another, would be intolerable to me.\r\nVoluntarily to put it out of my power ever to be able to seize the\r\nchance of forming for myself a true and rich life would seem to me like\r\nsuicide.\"\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale was no vestal ascetic. A true and perfect marriage\r\nwas, she thought, the perfect state. \"Marrying a man of high and good\r\npurpose, and following out that purpose with him is the happiest\" lot.\r\n\"The highest, the only true love, is when two persons, a man and a\r\nwoman, who have an attraction for one another, unite together in some\r\ntrue purpose for mankind and God.\"[53] The thought of God in instituting\r\nmarriage was \"that these two, when the right two are united, shall throw\r\nthemselves fearlessly into the universe, and do its work, secure of\r\ncompanionship and sympathy.\" Miss Nightingale recognized also that for\r\nmany women marriage, even though it may fall short of this ideal state,\r\nis the proper lot in life. But she held, on the other hand, that there\r\nare some women who may be marked out for single life. \"I don't agree at\r\nall (she wrote in 1846) that a woman has no reason (if she does not care\r\nfor any one else) for not marrying a good man who asks her, and I don't\r\nthink Providence does either. I think He has as clearly marked out some\r\nto be single women as He has others to be wives, and has organized them\r\naccordingly for their vocation. I think some have every reason for not\r\nmarrying, and that for these it is much better to educate the children\r\nwho are already in the world and can't be got out of it, than to bring\r\nmore into it. The Primitive Church clearly thought so too, and provided\r\naccordingly; and though no doubt the Primitive Church was in many\r\nmatters an old woman, yet I think the experience of ages has proved her\r\nright in this.\" And again: \"Ours is a system of Christianity without the\r\nCross\"; the single life was the life of Christ. \"Has Heaven bestowed\r\neverlasting souls on men, and sent them upon earth for no better purpose\r\nthan to marry and be given in marriage? True, there is in this world\r\nmuch more waiting to be done; but is it the man leading a secular life\r\nwho will do it? He is apt to see nothing beyond himself and the fair\r\ncreature he has chosen for his bride.\" And, as with men, so with women.\r\nThere are women of intellectual or actively moral natures for whom\r\nmarriage (unless it realizes the perfect ideal) means the sacrifice of\r\ntheir higher capacities to the satisfaction of their lower. \"Death,\" she\r\nwrote (again in a note-book of 1846), \"is often the gateway to the\r\nGarden where we shall no longer hunger and thirst after real\r\nsatisfaction. Marriage, on the contrary, is often an initiation into the\r\nmeaning of that inexorable word Never; which does not deprive us, it is\r\ntrue, of what 'at their festivals the idle and inconsiderate call life,'\r\nbut which brings in reality the end of our lives, and the chill of death\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\n  [53] _Suggestions for Thought_, vol. ii. pp. 229, 231.\r\n\r\nIn her own case, Miss Nightingale was conscious of capacities within her\r\nfor \"high purposes for mankind and for God.\" She could not feel sure\r\nthat the marriage which was offered to her would enable her to employ\r\nthose capacities to their best and fullest power. And so she sacrificed\r\nher \"passional\" nature to her moral ideal. \"I am 30,\" she wrote on her\r\nbirthday in her diary of 1850; \"the age at which Christ began His\r\nmission. Now no more childish things, no more vain things, no more love,\r\nno more marriage. Now, Lord, let me only think of Thy will.\" And amongst\r\nher sayings in another book, I find this: \"Strong passions to teach the\r\nsecrets of the human heart, and a strong will to hold them in\r\nsubjection, these are the keys of the kingdom in this world and the\r\nnext.\" Florence Nightingale turned away from marriage in order that she\r\nmight remain entirely free to fulfil her vocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nIt was not a sacrifice which cost her little. If, as some may hold, she\r\nwas not in love, yet she confessed to herself many of a lover's pangs,\r\nand there were moments when, as she met her admirer again, or as she\r\nthought of him, she was half inclined to repent of her choice of the\r\nsingle life. And the sacrifice, moreover, was of an immediate\r\nsatisfaction to an ideal which after all she might never be able to\r\nrealize. The legends of the saints tell of many virgins and martyrs who\r\nhave crucified the flesh and sacrificed worldly happiness for the love\r\nof Christ. But when the sacrifice was made, the love which seemed to\r\nthem far better was already theirs. In the ears of St. Agnes the Divine\r\nVoice had sounded with sweet assurance, and she had tasted of the milk\r\nand honey of His lips. St. Dorothea was already espoused in a garden\r\nwhere celestial fruits and roses that never fade surrounded her. And to\r\nFlorence Nightingale also happiness was to be given, filling all her\r\nlife for some years, so that she \"sought no better heaven\"; but at the\r\ntime when she made her choice, and renounced all else to follow her\r\nideal, the way before her was still dark and uncertain. She was\r\nconscious of a call, but she had no assurance of appointed work. To have\r\nentered into a marriage which gave no sure promise of her ideal, would\r\nhave been, she felt, the suicide of a soul; yet, when she was called to\r\nchoose between the two paths, her present life was starvation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the price which she had paid for her ideal that led to\r\nwhat, in later years, some considered a certain hardness in her. When\r\nonce a woman had devoted her life to the work of nursing, Miss\r\nNightingale had little sympathy with any turning back. She seemed\r\nsometimes in such cases to regard marriage as the unpardonable sin.\r\n\r\nBut another and a loftier train of thought was prompted by her\r\nexperience. At the end of one of her meditations upon marriage, and her\r\nrefusal of it, I find these significant words: \"I must strive after a\r\nbetter life for woman.\" She did not mean a better life than marriage;\r\nshe meant also a life that should make the conditions of marriage\r\nbetter. In the world in which she lived, daughters, she wrote, \"can only\r\nhave a choice among those people whom their parents like, and who like\r\ntheir parents well enough to come to their house.\" One may doubt whether\r\nin the mid-Victorian or in any age, young men paid calls only because\r\nthey liked the parents; but unquestionably restriction in the\r\nemployments of women involves also limitation in the opportunities for\r\nchoice in marriage. And at the same time the lack of interest and\r\nvariety in the lives of girls at home makes many of them inclined to\r\nmarriage as a mere means of escape. By throwing open new spheres of\r\nusefulness to women, Miss Nightingale hoped at one and the same time to\r\nimprove the lot of those who were marked out to be wives, and to find\r\nsatisfaction for those marked out for the single life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                      APPRENTICESHIP AT KAISERSWERTH\r\n\r\n                                  (1851)\r\n\r\n\r\n     The only happiness a brave man ever troubled himself with asking\r\n     much about was, happiness enough to get his work done. It is, after\r\n     all, the one unhappiness of a man, that he cannot work; that he\r\n     cannot get his destiny as a man fulfilled.--CARLYLE.\r\n\r\nForeign travel had, as we have seen, in no way changed Florence\r\nNightingale's resolve to devote herself to a life of nursing. She had\r\nturned away deliberately from marriage, and was bent upon finding a new\r\nfield of usefulness for unmarried women. But ways and means of doing\r\nthis were not yet apparent. She had no independent fortune of her own.\r\nShe returned to a family circle which understood her cravings no better\r\nthan before. The call of domestic duties was the same as before. There\r\nwere aunts and a grandmother to be visited, company at home to be\r\nentertained, a sister to be humoured, a father and mother to be pleased.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut she could not please them, because she herself could find no\r\npleasure in their life. She did not say to herself that she was better\r\nthan they. Still less did she thank God that she was not as they were.\r\nBut she felt with piteous keenness the gulf that separated her alike\r\nfrom her parents and from her sister. She loved her father, and admired\r\nhis good impulses and amiable character. But she perceived that his\r\ncontentment in a life of busy idleness made him constitutionally unable\r\nto enter fully into her state of mind. She loved her mother, and\r\nconsidered that she was, within her range, a woman of genius. \"She has\r\nthe genius of order,\" she wrote in a character-sketch of her mother,\r\n\"the genius to organize a parish, to form society. She has obtained by\r\nher own exertions the best society in England.\" What pained the daughter\r\nwas the inability to please the mother. \"When I feel her disappointment\r\nin me, it is as if I was becoming insane.\" She loved her sister also,\r\nand, I think, yet more tenderly. But as the sister once wrote: \"The\r\nnatures God has given us differ as widely as different races.\" Florence\r\nwas deeply sensible of the attractive side of her sister's character.\r\nLady Verney had indeed a most attractive mind; she was very vivacious,\r\ninquiring, and highly gifted, both as an artist and as a writer. She was\r\na perfect hostess, and her memory is pleasant to all who knew her. If\r\nshe lacked some of her sister's stronger English characteristics, she\r\nhad a light touch which Florence did not possess. And Florence felt the\r\ncharm of all this. \"No one less than I,\" she wrote, \"wants her to do one\r\nsingle thing different from what she does. She wants no other religion,\r\nno other occupation, no other training than what she has. She has never\r\nhad a difficulty except with me; she knows nothing of struggle in her\r\nown unselfish nature.\" But for that very reason she could not sympathize\r\nwith, because she could not understand, her sister's difficulties. In a\r\npassage which is doubtless autobiographical, Florence wrote: \"Very few\r\npeople can sympathise with each other in any pursuit or thought of any\r\nimportance. If people do not give you thought for thought, receive\r\nyours, digest it, and give it back with the impression of their own\r\ncharacter upon it, then give you one for you to do likewise, it is best\r\nto know what one is about, and not to attempt more than kindly, cheerful\r\noutward intercourse. Some find amusement in the outward, do not suffer\r\ninwardly, because the attention is turned elsewhere.\"[54] Meanwhile\r\nFlorence felt that everything she said or did was a subject of vexation\r\nto her sister, a disappointment to her mother, a worry to her father. \"I\r\nhave never known a happy time,\" she exclaimed to herself, \"except at\r\nRome and that fortnight at Kaiserswerth. It is not the unhappiness I\r\nmind, it is not indeed; but people can't be unhappy without making those\r\nabout them so.\"\r\n\r\n  [54] _Suggestions for Thought_, vol. ii. pp. 236, 237.\r\n\r\nShe strove to attain happiness. She tried to submit her will to what her\r\nspiritual confidantes told her must be taken to be the will of God; to\r\ntrust that in His own good time He would make her vocation sure; in such\r\nconfidence to find relief, and to throw herself meanwhile into the round\r\nof immediate duties. But the more she struggled, the more she failed.\r\nShe could not subdue the imperious longing to be up and doing which\r\nsurged within her. \"The thoughts and feelings that I have now,\" she\r\nwrote, \"I can remember since I was six years old. It was not that I made\r\nthem. A profession, a trade, a necessary occupation, something to fill\r\nand employ all my faculties, I have always felt essential to me, I have\r\nalways longed for, consciously or not. During a middle part of my life,\r\ncollege education, acquirement, I longed for, but that was temporary.\r\nThe first thought I can remember, and the last, was nursing work; and in\r\nthe absence of this, education work, but more the education of the bad\r\nthan of the young. But for this I had had no education myself.\" Finding\r\nno outlet in active reality, she lived more than ever in a land of\r\ndreams. \"Everything has been tried,\" she exclaimed to herself; \"foreign\r\ntravel, kind friends, everything.\" And again, \"My God! what is to become\r\nof me?\" Eighteen months before she had resolved on a great effort to\r\ncrucify her old self, \"to break through the habits, entailed upon me by\r\nan idle life, of living, not in the present world of action, but in a\r\nfuture one of dreams. Since then nations have passed before me, but have\r\nbrought no new life to me. In my 31st year I see nothing desirable but\r\ndeath.\" She was perishing, as she put it, for want of food; and she\r\ncould find no impulse to activity. Her habit of late rising grew upon\r\nher; for what had she to wake for? \"Starvation does not lead a man to\r\nexertion, it only weakens him. O weary days, O evenings that seem never\r\nto end! For how many long years, I have watched that drawing-room clock\r\nand thought it would never reach the ten! And for 20 or 30 more years to\r\ndo this!\" And again, \"Oh, how I am to get through this day, to talk\r\nthrough all this day, is the thought of every morning.... This is the\r\nsting of death. Why do I wish to leave this world? God knows I do not\r\nexpect a heaven beyond, but that He would set me down in St. Giles's, at\r\na Kaiserswerth, there to find my work and my salvation in my work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nSuch cries from the heart, cries for the food for which she was\r\nhungering and which her parents could or would not let her take, filled\r\nmany a sheet of Florence Nightingale's diaries, letters, and memoranda.\r\n\"Mountains of difficulties,\" as she says in one place, were \"piled up\"\r\naround her. Looking forward to a New Year (1851) she could see nothing\r\nin front of her but the same unsatisfying routine. \"The next three\r\nweeks,\" she said, in one of her written colloquies with herself, \"you\r\nwill have company; then a fortnight alone; then a few weeks of London,\r\nthen Embley; then perhaps go abroad; then three months of company at Lea\r\nHurst; next the same round of Embley company.\" And then, with a humorous\r\ntransition not infrequent in her musings, she asks, \"But why can't you\r\nget up in the morning? I have nothing I like so much as unconsciousness,\r\nbut I will try.\" As the year advanced a more decided spirit of revolt\r\nbegins to appear in her diaries. One of her perplexities hitherto had\r\nbeen a doubt whether the \"mountains of difficulties\" were to be taken as\r\noccasions for submission to God's will, or whether they were piled up in\r\norder to try her patience and her resolve, and were to be surmounted by\r\nsome initiative of her own. She now began to interpret God's will in the\r\nlatter sense. \"I must _take_ some things,\" she wrote on Whitsunday (June\r\n8, 1851), \"as few as I can, to enable me to live. I must _take_ them,\r\nthey will not be given me; take them in a true spirit of doing Thy will,\r\nnot of snatching them for my own will. I must do without some things, as\r\nmany as I can, which I could not have without causing more suffering\r\nthan I am obliged to cause any way.\" She would cease looking for the\r\nsympathy and understanding of her mother and sister. \"I have been so\r\nlong treated as a child and have so long allowed myself to be treated\r\nas a child.\" She would submit to such tutelage no longer.\r\n\r\nVarious plans had at different times found place in her dreams. She\r\nwould collect funds for founding a sisterhood, an institution, a\r\nhospital; but one thing she saw clearly and consistently. If she were\r\never to have an opportunity of doing good work in nursing or otherwise\r\nin service to the poor, she must first learn her business. There is a\r\nlong letter of 1850 from her to her father in which she argues the\r\npoint, not specifically with reference to herself, but as a general\r\nproposition. Something more than good intention is necessary in order to\r\ndo good. Philanthropy is a matter of skill, and an apprenticeship in it\r\nis necessary. An opportunity occurred sooner than she had dared to hope\r\nwhich enabled her to serve such an apprenticeship. Her sister was still\r\nin bad health, and a visit to Carlsbad was again proposed. She insisted\r\non being allowed to start with her mother and her sister, and to spend\r\nat Kaiserswerth the time that they would spend upon the cure and\r\nsubsequent travels.\r\n\r\nShe reached Kaiserswerth early in July and stayed there as an inmate of\r\nthe Institution until October 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nKaiserswerth is an ancient town on the Rhine, on the right bank, six\r\nmiles below Düsseldorf. In its Church of the twelfth century a reliquary\r\nis shown, in which are preserved the bones of St. Suitbertus, who came\r\nthere from Ireland to preach the Gospel in 710. Eleven centuries later,\r\na Protestant pastor of Kaiserswerth repaid the debt to the British Isles\r\nby founding the famous Institution for Deaconesses which was now to give\r\nFlorence Nightingale an important part of her training. The order of\r\ndeaconesses, as she was careful to point out in her account of\r\nKaiserswerth, was known in the Primitive Church; and long before St.\r\nVincent de Paul established the Sisters of Mercy in 1633, Protestant\r\ncommunities had in 1457 organized \"Presbyterae,\" since \"many women chose\r\na single state, not because they expected thereby to reach a\r\nsuper-eminent degree of holiness, but that they might be better able to\r\ncare for the sick and young.\" It was in 1823-24 that the young pastor of\r\nKaiserswerth, Theodor Fliedner, set out on a journey to Holland and\r\nEngland to beg for funds to relieve his parish, which had been ruined by\r\nthe failure of a silk-mill. In England, the little Princess Victoria\r\nheaded his list of subscribers. In London he met Mrs. Elizabeth Fry and\r\nwas greatly impressed with her work in Newgate. Shortly after his return\r\nhe founded (1826) the Rhenish-Westphalian Prison Association. Presently\r\nhe met a kindred spirit in Friederike Münster, a woman in comparatively\r\neasy circumstances who was devoting herself to reformatory work. They\r\nmarried, and in 1833--in a tiny summer-house in the pastor's garden--a\r\nrefuge was opened for the reception of a single discharged prisoner.\r\nThree years later, they added, on an equally modest scale at first, an\r\nInfant School, and a Hospital in which to train volunteer-nurses as\r\ndeaconesses. From these humble beginnings has grown a great congeries of\r\ninstitutions, the fame of which has spread throughout the philanthropic\r\nworld. There are thirty branch or daughter houses in various parts of\r\nGermany. They are to be found also at Jerusalem, Alexandria, Cairo,\r\nBeirut, Smyrna, and Bucharest. \"Not only its own daughter houses, but\r\nall independent institutions for deaconesses, owe their existence to\r\nKaiserswerth, for all subsequent work wrought by deaconesses whether in\r\nFrance, Switzerland, or America, whether Lutheran, Methodist, or\r\nEpiscopalian, has been the fruit of the Kaiserswerth tree.\"[55]\r\n\r\n  [55] _History of Nursing_, vol. ii. p. 4.\r\n\r\nBut the forest began as a tiny acorn. Pastor Fliedner started his work\r\nnot with grandiose schemes or full-fledged programmes, but with\r\nindividual cases and personal devotion. This was a point to which Miss\r\nNightingale called particular attention in her account of the place. \"It\r\nis impossible not to observe,\" she said, \"how different was the\r\nbeginning from the way in which institutions are generally founded--a\r\nlist of subscribers with some royal and noble names at the head--a\r\ndouble column of rules and regulations--a collection of great names\r\nbegin (and end) most new enterprises. The regulations are made without\r\nexperience. Honorary members abound, but where are the working ones? The\r\nscheme is excellent, but what are the results?\" Miss Nightingale's\r\nintensely practical genius had ever a holy horror of prospectuses. In\r\nsome notes written on June 15, 1848, I find this passage:--\r\n\r\n     Eschew Prospectuses; they're the devil, and make one sick. It is\r\n     like making out a bill of fare when you have not a single pound of\r\n     meat. What do the cookery books say? First catch your hare. All the\r\n     instances on the Continent have begun in one of two ways. At\r\n     Kaiserswerth, a clergyman and his wife have begun, not with a\r\n     Prospectus, but with a couple of hospital beds, and have offered,\r\n     not an advertisement, but a home to young women willing to come. At\r\n     Berne, a Mdlle. Würstenberger, a woman of rank and education, goes\r\n     to Kaiserswerth to learn, and her friend to Strassburg. They return\r\n     and open a hospital with two rooms, increase their funds, others\r\n     join them and are taught by them.... To publish first is as bad a\r\n     practical bull as is the name of the _Prospective Review_.\r\n\r\nA few years were to pass, and Florence Nightingale herself was to begin\r\nher work in the world not with a programme, but with a deed.\r\n\r\nThe institutions of Kaiserswerth, when she was there in 1851, were still\r\non a comparatively modest scale. They comprised, as she enumerates them,\r\na Hospital (with 100 beds), an Infant School, a Penitentiary (with 12\r\ninmates), an Orphan Asylum, and a Normal School for schoolmistresses.\r\nThere were in all 116 deaconesses, of whom 94 were \"consecrated,\" the\r\nremainder being still on probation. The \"consecration\" consisted only of\r\n\"a solemn blessing in the Church, without vows of any kind.\" Of the 116\r\ndeaconesses, 67 were on service in other parts of Germany, or abroad;\r\nthe rest were engaged in working the various institutions at\r\nKaiserswerth itself. After six months' trial they received a modest\r\nsalary, just enough to provide their clothes. There was no other reward,\r\nexcept that the Mother House stood open to receive those who might fall\r\nill or become infirm in its service. Everything was clean and well\r\nordered, but there was no luxury; the board was simple to the verge of\r\nroughness. The place was pervaded by two notes. It was a place of\r\ntraining, and a place of consecrated service. The training was both in\r\npractice and by precept. Every week the pastor gave a conversational\r\nlecture to the deaconesses, finding out from each the difficulties she\r\nmight have experienced in her work, and suggesting how they could best\r\nbe met. The education of the young, the ministration of the sick, the\r\nart of district visiting, the yet more difficult work of rescue and\r\nreformation, all were taught.\r\n\r\nIn such a place as this, Florence Nightingale found by actual\r\nexperience, as already she had learnt to expect from reading the\r\nreports, the realization in some degree of her most earnest desires. The\r\ntraining in nursing was, it is true, not particularly good; it fell far\r\nshort of the professional standard which the Nightingale School was\r\nafterwards to set up. She objected strongly in later years to current\r\nstatements that her own training was confined to Kaiserswerth. \"The\r\nnursing there,\" she wrote, \"was _nil_. The hygiene horrible. The\r\nhospital was certainly the worst part of Kaiserswerth. I took all the\r\ntraining that was to be had--there was none to be had in England, but\r\nKaiserswerth was far from having trained me.\" On the other hand \"the\r\ntone was excellent, admirable. And Pastor Fliedner's addresses were the\r\nvery best I ever heard. The penitentiary out-door work and vegetable\r\ngardening under a very capable Sister were excellently adapted to the\r\ncase. And Pastor Fliedner's solemn and reverential teaching to us of the\r\nsad events of hospital life was what I have never heard in England.\"[56]\r\nBut here, at Kaiserswerth, Miss Nightingale found \"a better life for\r\nwomen,\" a scope for the exercise of \"morally active\" powers. And here,\r\nthough the field was limited, was provided in some sort the training\r\nwhich alone could fit women for larger responsibilities elsewhere. Here\r\nwas \"the service of man\" organized as \"the service of God\"; here was\r\nopportunity for the Dedicated Life, as she had found it also in the\r\nTrinità de' Monti.\r\n\r\n  [56] Letter to Mrs. C. S. Roundell, August 4, 1896.\r\n\r\nHer manner of life at Kaiserswerth and her joy in it were told in\r\nletters to her mother:--\r\n\r\n     On Sunday I took the sick boys a long walk along the Rhine; two\r\n     Sisters were with me to help me to keep order. They were all in\r\n     ecstasies with the beauty of the scenery, and really I thought it\r\n     very fine too in its way--the broad mass of waters flowing ever on\r\n     slowly and calmly to their destination, and all that unvarying\r\n     horizon--so like the slow, calm, earnest, meditative German\r\n     character.\r\n\r\n     The world here fills my life with interest, and strengthens me in\r\n     body and mind. I succeeded directly to an office, and am now in\r\n     another, so that until yesterday I never had time even to send my\r\n     things to the wash. We have ten minutes for each of our meals, of\r\n     which we have four. We get up at 5; breakfast 1/4 before 6. The\r\n     patients dine at 11; the Sisters at 12. We drink tea (_i.e._ a\r\n     drink made of ground rye) between 2 and 3, and sup at 7. We have\r\n     two ryes and two broths--ryes at 6 and 3, broths at 12 and 7; bread\r\n     at the two former, vegetables at 12. Several evenings in the week\r\n     we collect in the Great Hall for a Bible lesson. The Pastor sent\r\n     for me once to give me some of his unexampled instructions; the\r\n     man's wisdom and knowledge of human nature is wonderful; he has an\r\n     instinctive acquaintance with every character in his place. Except\r\n     that once I have only seen him in his rounds.\r\n\r\n     The operation to which Mrs. Bracebridge alludes was an amputation\r\n     at which I was present, but which I did not mention to----, knowing\r\n     that she would see no more in my interest in it than the pleasure\r\n     dirty boys have in playing in the puddles about a butcher's shop. I\r\n     find the deepest interest in everything here, and am so well in\r\n     body and mind. This is Life. Now I know what it is to live and to\r\n     love life, and really I should be sorry now to leave life. I know\r\n     you will be glad to hear this, dearest Mum. God has indeed made\r\n     life rich in interests and blessings, and I wish for no other\r\n     earth, no other world but this.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Miss Nightingale slept during her residence at\r\nKaiserswerth was in the Orphan Asylum. She took her meals with the\r\nDeaconesses. The Spartan severity, but no less the beautiful spirit of\r\nthe place, were clear in her recollection nearly half a century later.\r\nIn 1897 the authorities of the British Museum applied to her for a copy\r\nof the pamphlet on Kaiserswerth which she had printed in 1851. The\r\npencilled note which she sent with a torn copy of the pamphlet, the only\r\none she could find, is preserved in the Museum Library. \"I was twice in\r\ntraining there myself,\" she wrote (September 24, 1897). \"Of course\r\nsince then, Hospital and District nursing have made giant strides.\r\nIndeed District nursing has been invented. But never have I met with a\r\nhigher tone, a purer devotion, than there. There was no neglect. It was\r\nthe more remarkable because many of the Deaconesses had been only\r\npeasants--none were gentlewomen (when I was there). The food was poor.\r\nNo coffee but bean-coffee. No luxury; but cleanliness.\" Pastor Fliedner\r\ntold a visitor to Kaiserswerth that \"no person had ever passed so\r\ndistinguished an examination, or shown herself so thoroughly mistress of\r\nall she had to learn, as Miss Nightingale.\"[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] Mr. Sidney Herbert's speech at the Nightingale Fund Meeting, Nov.\r\n       29, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nHappy as Miss Nightingale was at Kaiserswerth, there was yet one thing\r\nlacking. She wished, it is true, for no other earth; she had found her\r\npictured heaven; her life was full and rich. Yet with all her\r\nself-reliance, and even in the moment of first victory in her long\r\nstruggle for self-expression, she yearned, woman-like, for sympathy.\r\nNay, and not only woman-like. \"Not till we can think,\" said Carlyle,\r\n\"that here and there one is thinking of us, one is loving us, does this\r\nwaste earth become a peopled garden.\" It was not enough to Florence that\r\nshe should have had her way and that her parents should have acquiesced.\r\nHer loving heart craved for their positive sympathy; her mind, half\r\nleaning for all its masterfulness, demanded that what she had decided\r\nshould be accepted by those dear to her as their choice also. \"I should\r\nbe as happy here,\" she wrote to her mother (August 31), \"as the day is\r\nlong, if I could hope that I had your smile, your blessing, your\r\nsympathy upon it; without which I cannot be quite happy. My beloved\r\npeople, I cannot bear to grieve you. Life and everything in it that\r\ncharms you, you would sacrifice for me; but unknown to you is my thirst,\r\nunseen by you are waters which would save me. To save me, I know would\r\nbe to bless yourselves, whose love for me passes the love of women. Oh\r\nhow shall I show you love and gratitude in return, yet not so perish\r\nthat you chiefly would mourn! Give me time, give me faith. Trust me,\r\nhelp me. I feel within me that I could gladden your loving hearts which\r\nnow I wound. Say to me, 'Follow the dictates of that spirit within\r\nthee.' Oh my beloved people, that spirit shall never lead me to anything\r\nunworthy of one who is yours in love.\"[58] But her mother and her\r\nsister, though they loved and admired her, or perhaps from their point\r\nof view because they did so, were unable to give any such active\r\nsympathy as that for which she craved. Her sister hoped that the visit\r\nto Kaiserswerth would be only an episode. It was a good thing, she had\r\nwritten to her mother, for Florence to go there, \"as we can get her back\r\nsooner to Lea Hurst.\" To Florence herself she wrote affectionately, but\r\nyet with gentle irony. She sent a lively letter describing in detail the\r\nbirth of a friend's twins: \"I tell you, as you are going to be a _sage\r\nfemme_, I suppose.\" Mrs. Nightingale, for her part, had acquiesced in\r\nthe visit to Kaiserswerth, but was already wondering what people would\r\nthink of her daughter's escapade. \"I have not mentioned to any one,\"\r\nwrote Florence (July 16), \"where I am, and should also be very sorry\r\nthat the old ladies should know. With regard, however, to your fear of\r\nwhat people will say, the people whose opinion you most care about, it\r\nhas been their earnest wish for years that I should come here. The\r\nBunsens (I know he wishes one of his own daughters would come), the\r\nBracebridges, the Sam Smiths, Lady Inglis, the Sidney Herberts, the\r\nPlunketts, all wish it; and I know that others--Lady Byron, Caroline\r\nBathurst, Mr. Tremenheere, Mr. Rich (whose opinions however I have not\r\nasked)--would think it a very desirable thing for everybody.... With\r\nregard to telling people the fact (afterwards) of my having been here, I\r\ncan see no difficulty. The Herberts, as you know, even commissioned me\r\nto do something for them here. The fact itself will pain none of them.\"\r\nMr. and Mrs. Herbert, who were at Homburg, presently paid her a visit at\r\nKaiserswerth.\r\n\r\n  [58] Much of this appeal was suggested to Florence, in almost identical\r\n       words (as an extant letter shows), by her Aunt Mai.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nightingale and her elder daughter reached Cologne on their way\r\nhome in October 1851, and there Florence rejoined them. \"Our dear child\r\nFlorence,\" wrote the mother to Madame Mohl (October 9), \"came to us\r\nyesterday, and is gone this morning to visit certain Deaconesses and\r\nothers. I long to be at home and among our people. Daily and hourly I\r\ncongratulate myself that our home is where it is. Oh what a land of\r\njustice and freedom and all good things it is, compared to what we have\r\nseen, and how surprising that with all our advantages and our freedom\r\nwon we should not be so much better than other people. Well, I hope\r\nFlorence will be able to apply all the fine things she has been\r\nlearning, to do a little to make us better. Parthe and I are much too\r\nidle to help and too apt to be satisfied with things as they are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                               AN INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n                                  (1852)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow.--BYRON.\r\n\r\nThe three months which Miss Nightingale spent at Kaiserswerth in 1851\r\nwere a turning-point in her career, but they were not immediately\r\neffectual in altering the tenor of her life. The battle for freedom was\r\nnot yet completely won; but the \"mountains of difficulty\" in her way had\r\nbeen turned, and henceforth the resistance offered to her was but a\r\nrear-guard action.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA note of serenity, in marked contrast to the storm and distress of\r\nearlier years, now appears in some of her letters. She had firmly\r\nresolved on taking her life into her own hands; and at Kaiserswerth she\r\nhad already served some apprenticeship. She was resolved no less firmly\r\nto follow up the advantage; and, though there were still to be some\r\ndifficulties ahead, she could afford to be patient for a while:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss H. Bonham Carter._) UMBERSLADE, _Jan. 8._ Brussels\r\n     Sprouts is at it already, I mean at correspondence. I mention it to\r\n     show how little women's occupations are respected, when people can\r\n     think that a woman has time to spin out long theories with every\r\n     young fool who visits at her house. This place is grand--Inigo\r\n     Jones, and Papa is content.... I like Dr. Johnson; but I can always\r\n     talk better to a medical man than to any one else. They have not\r\n     that detestable nationality which makes it so difficult to talk\r\n     with an Englishman. I suppose the habit of examining organisations\r\n     gives them this.... Poor Cassandra has found an unexpected ally in\r\n     a young surgeon of a London hospital, a son of Dr. Johnson who\r\n     sits next Papa at the _table d'hôte_. The account he gives of the\r\n     nurses beats everything that even I know of. This young prophet\r\n     says that they are all drunkards, without exception, Sisters and\r\n     all, and that there are but two nurses whom the surgeon can trust\r\n     to give the patients their medicines. I thought you would be\r\n     pleased to hear how bad they are, so I tell you. Johnson is\r\n     extraordinarily careful, but he does not strike me as having genius\r\n     like Gully. The company is of a nature which would give Mama some\r\n     hopes of me that I should learn \"the value of good society\" by the\r\n     contrast....\r\n\r\n     (_To her Father._) _May_ 12 [1852]. On my 32nd birthday I think I\r\n     must write a word of acknowledgment to you. I am glad to think that\r\n     my youth is past, and rejoice that it never, never can return--that\r\n     time of follies and bondage, of unfulfilled hopes and disappointed\r\n     _in_experience, when a man possesses nothing, not even himself. I\r\n     am glad to have lived; though it has been a life which, except as\r\n     the necessary preparation for another, few would accept. I hope now\r\n     that I have come into possession of myself. I hope that I have\r\n     escaped from that bondage which knows not how to distinguish\r\n     between \"bad habits\" and \"duties\"--terms often used synonymously by\r\n     all the world. It is too soon to holloa before you are out of the\r\n     wood; and like the Magdalen in Correggio's picture, I see the dark\r\n     wood behind, the sharp stones in front only with too much\r\n     clearness. Of clearness, however, there cannot be _too_ much. But,\r\n     as in the picture, there is light. I hope that I may live; a thing\r\n     which I have not often been able to say, because I think I have\r\n     learnt something which it would be a pity to waste. And I am ever\r\n     yours, dear father, in struggle as in peace, with thanks for all\r\n     your kind care, F. N.\r\n\r\n     When I speak of the disappointed inexperience of youth, of course I\r\n     accept that, not only as inevitable, but as the beautiful\r\n     arrangement of Infinite Wisdom, which cannot create us gods, but\r\n     which will not create us animals, and therefore wills mankind to\r\n     create mankind by their own experience--a disposition of Perfect\r\n     Goodness which no one can quarrel with. I shall be very ready to\r\n     read you, when I come home, any of my \"Works,\" in your own room\r\n     before breakfast, if you have any desire to hear them.--Au revoir,\r\n     dear Papa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThere were various reasons for the comparative serenity of Miss\r\nNightingale's mind during this period of pause. One was the obvious\r\ncall of filial duty for the moment. Her father was in poor health, and\r\nhad been advised to take the water-cure under Dr. Johnson at Umberslade\r\nPark, in Worcestershire. Florence, being herself convalescent at the\r\ntime from an attack of the measles, was the more ready to companion her\r\nfather. She was at Umberslade with him for some weeks at the beginning,\r\nand again at the end, of the year. Her observation of some of the\r\npatients there, as in a former year at Malvern, was the origin of an\r\nepigrammatic definition which I find in one of her note-books: \"The\r\nwater-cure: a highly popular amusement within the last few years amongst\r\nathletic invalids who have felt the _tedium vitae_, and those indefinite\r\ndiseases which a large income and unbounded leisure are so well\r\ncalculated to produce.\" Then, again, towards the end of the year, her\r\nkinswoman, \"Aunt Evans,\" was smitten down. She was the sister of her\r\nfather's mother, and died at the age of ninety. Florence attended her in\r\nher last illness, and as emergency-man made all the arrangements for her\r\nfuneral. George Eliot was, I believe, distantly connected with \"Aunt\r\nEvans's\" family; and it was in this year that she and Florence met. \"I\r\nhad a note from Miss Florence Nightingale yesterday,\" wrote George Eliot\r\nin July 1852; \"I was much pleased with her. There is a loftiness of mind\r\nabout her which is well expressed by her form and manner.\"[59] Florence\r\nalso at this time called upon Mrs. Browning, who in a letter to a\r\nfriend, three years later, said: \"I remember her face and her graceful\r\nmanner and the flowers she sent me afterwards. She is an earnest, noble\r\nwoman.\"[60] In August 1852 Miss Nightingale visited Ireland, and\r\ninspected the Dublin hospitals, somewhat, it seems, to her\r\ndisappointment. She went in September with her father to stay with Sir\r\nJames Clark, Queen Victoria's physician, at Birk Hall, near Ballater.\r\nShe always got on well, as we have just heard, with medical men, and the\r\nopportunity of discussing her plans and thoughts with so eminent a\r\nphysician must have pleased her greatly.\r\n\r\n  [59] _George Eliot's Life as Related in her Letters and Journals_,\r\n       edited by J. W. Cross, vol. i. p. 285.\r\n\r\n  [60] _Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning_, vol. i. p. 188.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe letter to her father, given above, refers to Miss Nightingale's\r\n\"Works\"; and herein is to be found a second explanation of this peaceful\r\ninterlude in her life. She had, as I have said, renounced a literary\r\ncareer; but she drew a sharp distinction between what she called\r\nliterature for its own sake, and writing as subservient to action. She\r\nwas intensely anxious to find some theological sanction, less assailable\r\nthan she deemed the popular creeds to be, for her religion of practical\r\nservice. Again, as I have also said, she was determined to open up a new\r\nsphere of usefulness for women. These were the subjects of her \"Works,\"\r\nwhich comprised \"a Novel\" and a book on \"Religion.\" Of the novel, no\r\nmanuscript has been found among her papers. But in one of three volumes\r\nof _Suggestions for Thought_, which she printed privately in 1860, there\r\nis a section entitled \"Cassandra,\" dealing with the life at home of an\r\nordinary English gentlewoman. It may be conjectured that the form of the\r\nnovel was abandoned after 1852, and the theme treated instead in the\r\npages of \"Cassandra.\" The manuscript book on \"Religion\" was doubtless\r\nenlarged between 1852 and 1860 into the main portion of the _Suggestions\r\nfor Thought_, of which the first volume was dedicated \"To the Artizans\r\nof England.\"\r\n\r\nAlready in 1851, in a sheet of good resolutions, Miss Nightingale had\r\nplanned to devote some portion of her life at home to giving \"a new\r\nreligion to the Tailors.\" The hero of _Alton Locke_, published in 1850,\r\nwas, it will be remembered, a tailor. Miss Nightingale herself had some\r\nacquaintance with operatives in the North of England and in London,\r\n\"among those of what are called 'Holyoake's party.'\"[61] She met these\r\nlatter through Mr. Edward Truelove, whom some readers of earlier\r\ngenerations may still remember as a publisher and vendor of radical and\r\n\"free-thinking\" literature. \"The Literary and Scientific Institution\" in\r\nJohn Street, Fitzroy Square, was in the 'forties the headquarters of\r\nOwenite Socialists, the Secularists (whose chief prophet was George\r\nJacob Holyoake) and other \"advanced\" persons. In 1846 Mr. Truelove had\r\ncome up from \"Harmony Hall,\" the Owenite community at Tytherley in\r\nHampshire, to act as Secretary of the Institution in John Street; and in\r\na small house next door he set up his shop--afterwards removed,\r\nsuccessively, to the Strand and High Holborn. A west-end lady, who did\r\nnot at first give her name, used to pay occasional visits to the shop in\r\nJohn Street, and have long conversations with the wife of the\r\nproprietor. The lady was Miss Nightingale, and the acquaintance\r\ndeveloped into a friendship with Mrs. Truelove, which extended over many\r\nyears. Mr. Truelove was an unworldly man, conducting his affairs with\r\nentire disregard for \"business principles,\" conventional opinions, and\r\nconstituted authorities. His shop, as Mr. Holyoake said, was one of the\r\n\"fortresses of prohibited thought, not garrisoned without daring\"; and\r\nprovisioned, it may be added, scantily enough. Miss Nightingale\r\ncontinued to see Mrs. Truelove from time to time in later years; wrote\r\nto her occasionally; sent her books and various presents regularly; and\r\nin times of her husband's difficulties and (literally) trials, never\r\nwithheld sympathy.\r\n\r\n  [61] Letter to Sir John McNeill, May 17, 1860.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's object, in her first expeditions to John Street, had\r\nbeen to discover and discuss the kind of literature affected by the more\r\nintelligent working-men. The conclusion at which she arrived was that\r\n\"the most thinking and conscientious of the artizans have no religion at\r\nall.\"[62] She set to work, accordingly, to find a new religion for them.\r\nIn this undertaking she took much counsel with one of her aunts. This\r\nwas \"Aunt Mai,\" her father's sister, Mary Shore, married to Mr. Samuel\r\nSmith, her mother's brother. A large number of her letters on religious\r\nsubjects was preserved by Miss Nightingale. They show spiritual insight,\r\nand a considerable talent in speculative thought. The postscript of Miss\r\nNightingale's letter to her father, given above, contains one of the\r\nfundamental ideas in her scheme of theology--the idea of Perfect\r\nGoodness, willing that mankind shall create mankind by man's own\r\nexperience. The same idea was suggested by Aunt Mai when she wrote to\r\nher niece: \"The purpose of God is to accomplish the welfare of man, not\r\nas a gift from Him, but as to be attained for each individual and for\r\nthe whole race by the right exercise of the capabilities of each.\"\r\n\r\n  [62] Letter to Sir John McNeill, May 17, 1860.\r\n\r\nDuring 1851 and 1852 aunt and niece corresponded at great length on\r\nthese high matters, and by the end of the latter year Miss Nightingale\r\nhad her new religion ready for the criticism of her friends. \"Many\r\nthanks,\" she wrote (Nov. 19) to her cousin Hilary, \"for your letter of\r\ncorrections and annotations, all of which I have adopted. I should much\r\nlike to have a regular talk with you about the Novel. I have not the\r\nleast idea whether I shall have to remodel the Novel and 'Religion'\r\nentirely; for I am so sick of it that I lose all discrimination about\r\nthe ensemble and the form.\" Her object is explained in a letter of about\r\nthe same date to another friend:--\r\n\r\n     (_To R. Monckton Milnes._) I am going abroad soon. Before I go, I\r\n     am thinking of asking you whether you would look over certain\r\n     things which I have written for the working-men on the subject of\r\n     belief in a God. All the moral and intellectual among them seem\r\n     going over to atheism, or at least to a vague kind of theism. I\r\n     have read them to one or two, and they have liked them. I should\r\n     have liked to have asked you if you think them likely to be read by\r\n     more; but you are perhaps not interested in the subject, or you\r\n     have no time, which is fully taken up with other things. If you\r\n     tell me this, it will be no surprise or disappointment.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] _Life of Lord Houghton_, vol. i. p. 475.\r\n\r\nLord Houghton read the manuscript attentively, and did not forget it.\r\nSeveral years later, when Miss Nightingale was ill, and thought likely\r\nto die, he wrote to her suggesting that if she had made no other\r\narrangements for the preservation and possible publication of her essay,\r\nshe might think of entrusting it to him. \"I have often thought,\" he said\r\n(March 11, '61), \"of asking you what you meant to do with the papers you\r\nhave written on social and speculative subjects. They surely should not\r\nbe destroyed; and yet I hardly know to whom you will entrust them, who\r\nwould not misunderstand, misinterpret, and misuse them. If you were to\r\nleave them in my hands, they would be, at any rate, safe from\r\nirreverent handling or crude exposure, and could be used in any way more\r\nor less future that you might think fit.\" By that time, however, the\r\nwork had been submitted to the judgment of other men of letters; and to\r\nthat later period further reference to the subject had better be\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThe formulating of a religion, whether for the tailors or others, is no\r\nshort task, and Miss Nightingale's \"Works\" must have well filled her\r\nmind during otherwise unoccupied hours in 1852. But the \"Works\" were\r\nonly bye-work. Her main concern was to continue her apprenticeship in\r\nnursing. Some vexatious delays and difficulties were still to be\r\nencountered, but she faced them with a brighter confidence than before,\r\nand the last stage of the struggle wears an aspect more of comedy than\r\nof tragedy. She had successfully asserted her independence once in going\r\nto Kaiserswerth. In an imaginary dialogue with her mother, she makes\r\nherself say, \"Why, my dear, you don't suppose that with my 'talents' and\r\nmy 'European reputation' and my 'beautiful letters,' and all that, I'm\r\ngoing to stay dangling about my mother's drawing-room all my life! I\r\nshall go and look out for work, to be sure. You must look upon me as\r\nyour son. I should have cost you a great deal more if I had married or\r\nbeen a son. You must now consider me married or a son. You were willing\r\nto part with me to be married.\" In presenting the case in this light to\r\nher parents, Florence had now a valuable ally in her Aunt Mai. Something\r\nof a diplomatist, as well as of a philosopher, was within the powers of\r\nthat excellent woman. Without any interference which could be resented,\r\nby insinuating a word here, suggesting a phrase there, and pouring oil\r\nupon troubled waters everywhere, Aunt Mai did a good deal to smooth the\r\nlast stages in her niece's struggle for independence.\r\n\r\nLike all good diplomatists, the aunt sought first for a basis of\r\ncompromise. She was able to sympathize with both sides. She was wholly\r\nfavourable to her niece's aspirations and claims. But as a mother\r\nherself, she could enter into the case of her brother and his wife. It\r\nwas not that they were selfishly obstructive; it was that, finding so\r\nmuch interest and enjoyment themselves in their own way of life, they\r\ndesired in all love that the daughter should not deprive herself of the\r\nsame privileges. But could not a compromise be arranged? Let it be\r\nagreed that Florence should spend part of each year in pursuit of what\r\nthe mother considered her daughter's fancies, and spend another part at\r\nhome. This was the arrangement which was in fact now in force.\r\n\r\nThe compromise served well enough for a while, but Florence wanted\r\nsomething more; and here, again, Aunt Mai's diplomacy prepared the way.\r\nWith a good strategic eye, she saw that Mrs. Nightingale held the key of\r\nthe position. Mr. Nightingale in his heart was at one with Florence. He\r\nadmired her and believed in her; he was quite willing that she should go\r\nher own way, and was not reluctant to make her some independent\r\nallowance, such as would enable her to conduct a mission or an\r\ninstitution. But, as he said to his sister, whenever he broached\r\nanything of the kind to his wife and elder daughter, he found them\r\nunited against him. Mr. Nightingale was one of those amiable men who are\r\ninclined to take the line of least resistance. It was Mrs. Nightingale's\r\nopposition, therefore, that had to be overcome. \"Your mother,\" reported\r\nthe aunt, \"would, I believe, be most willing that you undertake a\r\nmission like Mrs. Fry or Mrs. Chisholm,[64] but she thinks it necessary\r\nfor your peace and well-being that there should be a Mr. Fry or Captain\r\nChisholm to protect you, and in conscience she thinks it right to defend\r\nyou from doing anything which _she thinks_ would be an impediment to the\r\nexistence of Mr. F. or Captain C.\" A good many mothers, even in these\r\ndays, will, I doubt not, be on Mrs. Nightingale's side. But Aunt Mai,\r\nhaving made her sister-in-law define the position, pressed the advantage\r\nin an ingenious way. Florence was already thirty-two; and a time comes\r\nsoon after that age when even the most sanguine mother begins to\r\ndespair. It was agreed, accordingly, that \"at some future specified age\"\r\nFlorence should be free to do the work of a Mrs. Fry or a Mrs. Chisholm\r\nwithout the protection of a Mr. F. or a Captain C. There was even some\r\ntalk of obtaining a written agreement to that effect, specifying the\r\nage; but Aunt Mai thought better of such a plan, and contented herself\r\nwith calling in another witness to the verbal understanding. This was\r\nthe lady--Mrs. Bracebridge--who two years later was to accompany Miss\r\nNightingale on a mission more renowned even than that of Mrs. Fry or\r\nMrs. Chisholm. But from the point gained by Aunt Mai's diplomacy and\r\nFlorence's own persistence, a logical consequence followed. Presently,\r\nat some future unspecified age, Florence was to be free to control some\r\nphilanthropic institution; but what would be the use of being free to do\r\nso, unless she were also trained and qualified?\r\n\r\n  [64] Caroline Jones (1808-77) married Captain Chisholm, 1830; opened\r\n       orphan schools in Madras, 1832; befriended female emigrants to\r\n       Australia, 1841-66. Miss Nightingale had correspondence with her\r\n       in 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nHaving lived and learnt among the Protestant Deaconesses in Germany,\r\nMiss Nightingale was next determined to do the like among the Catholic\r\nSisters in France. She sought the good offices of Manning, whose\r\nacquaintance she had made in Rome five years before, and who had now\r\nlately been received into the Roman Communion. Manning put himself into\r\ncommunication with his friend, the Abbé Des Genettes, in Paris. The Abbé\r\nobtained leave from the Council of the Sisters of Charity for the\r\nEnglish lady to study their institutions. It had been explained to him\r\nthat Miss Nightingale was also desirous of studying the hospitals in\r\nParis. The Abbé accordingly selected a House belonging to the Sisters\r\nwhich would offer every advantage in this respect. Her cousin, Miss\r\nHilary Bonham Carter, who was intent on the study of art and had been\r\ninvited to stay with M. and Madame Mohl, was to accompany her to Paris;\r\nand Lady Augusta Bruce was also to be of the party. It was in the salon\r\nof Madame Mohl that Lady Augusta met her future husband, Dean Stanley.\r\n\r\nThus, then, it had been arranged. The necessary authorization from the\r\nSisters had been obtained in September. The start was to be made in\r\nNovember. But as the time approached, Mrs. Nightingale drew back. She\r\nwrote of the plan, not as something agreed upon, but as a new\r\nproposition. \"I am afraid,\" she said to Aunt Mai, \"that Flo is thinking\r\nof some new expedition, perhaps to Paris. I cannot make up my mind to\r\nit.\" Florence was staying at a friend's house in London. Her father came\r\nin, and reported that her mother was greatly distressed. There was\r\ncompany coming to Embley, and could Florence have the heart to leave her\r\nmother? \"Parthe would be in hysterics.\" Every one would be in despair.\r\nCould she not delay? An aged kinswoman, moreover, was ill, as already\r\nrelated. Florence yielded, perhaps more to this last consideration than\r\nto the others, and the start was postponed. There was a lingering hope\r\nthat the expedition to Paris might be abandoned, and a suggestion was\r\nmade to that end. Why must Florence go to the Sisters, and Roman\r\nCatholic Sisters, too--abroad? Why should she not stay at home, and\r\nconduct some small institution on her own account? There was a house\r\navailable for such a purpose at Cromford Bridge, close to their own Lea\r\nHurst, and Mr. Nightingale would provide the necessary funds. In this\r\nway the best might be made of both worlds--of theirs, and of hers.\r\nFlorence was touched, but remained of her own mind:--\r\n\r\n     (_To her sister._) _January_ 3. Oh, my dearest Pop, I wish I could\r\n     tell you how I love you and thank you for your kind thoughts as\r\n     received in your letter to-day. If you did but know how genial it\r\n     is to me, when my dear people give me a hope of their blessing and\r\n     that they would speed me on my way! as the kind thought of Cromford\r\n     seems to say they are ready to do. I will write to Mama about Paris\r\n     and Cromford. My Pop, whether at one or the other, my heart will be\r\n     with thee. Now if these seem mere words, because bodily I shall be\r\n     leaving you, have patience with me, my dearest. I hope that you and\r\n     I shall live to prove a true love to each other. I cannot, during\r\n     the year's round, go the way which (for my sake, I know) you have\r\n     wished. There have been times when, for your dear sake, I have\r\n     tried to stifle the thoughts which I feel ingrained in my nature.\r\n     But, if that may not be, I hope that something better shall be. If\r\n     I ask your blessing on a part of my time for my absence, I hope to\r\n     be all the happier with you for that absence when we are together.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale refused Cromford Bridge House: it was most unsuitable\r\nfor the purpose; the only more unsuitable place was the \"Forest Lodge\"\r\nat Embley, which her sister Parthe had suggested. In the following year,\r\nFlorence joined the Sisters of Charity in Paris. And thus, after many\r\nstruggles and delays, was she launched upon her true work in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                     FREEDOM. PARIS AND HARLEY STREET\r\n\r\n                            (1853-October 1854)\r\n\r\n\r\n               Lo, as some venturer from his stars receiving\r\n                 Promise and presage of sublime emprise,\r\n               Wears evermore the seal of his believing\r\n                 Deep in the dark of solitary eyes.\r\n                                                   F. W. H. MYERS.\r\n\r\nThe institution in which Florence Nightingale was to serve her\r\napprenticeship in Paris was the Maison de la Providence, belonging to\r\nthe S[oe]urs de la Charité in the Rue Oudinot (No. 5), Faubourg St.\r\nGermain. The Abbé Des Genettes described in a letter to Manning the\r\nattractions which it would offer to his protegée. The principal House,\r\nmanaged by twenty Sisters, received nearly two hundred poor orphans, and\r\nalso conducted a _crêche_. A hospital was attached to it, next door, for\r\naged and sick women. Within ten minutes' walk Miss Nightingale would\r\nfind two other hospitals, one a general hospital, the other a children's\r\nhospital. The English _demoiselle_ would conform, in accordance with her\r\ndesire, to the rules of the House as a _postulante_, rendering all\r\nnecessary service to the sick. The only restrictions were that she would\r\nnot be able to enter the refectory or the dormitory of the Sisters. She\r\nwould have to sleep and take her meals in her own room. But she would be\r\nfree to visit the poor in company with the Sisters, to serve the sick\r\nunder their direction in various hospitals and infirmaries, and to\r\nassist in the care of the orphans alike in class and at play.\r\n\r\nSuch was the life in Paris to which Miss Nightingale was looking forward\r\neagerly. She left London for Paris on February 3, 1853, with her cousin,\r\nMiss Bonham Carter, and they stayed with M. and Madame Mohl in the Rue\r\ndu Bac. Before entering the Maison de la Providence, Miss Nightingale\r\ndesired to visit and study other institutions in Paris. She was armed\r\nwith a comprehensive permit from the Administration Générale de\r\nl'Assistance Publique to study in all the hospitals of the city. She\r\navailed herself indefatigably of this permission, spending her days in\r\ninspecting hospitals, infirmaries, and religious houses, and having the\r\nadvantage of seeing the famous Paris surgeons at their work. Now, as at\r\nall times, she was a diligent collector and student of reports, returns,\r\nstatistics, pamphlets. Among her papers of this date are elaborately\r\ntabulated analyses of hospital organization and nursing arrangements\r\nboth in France and in Germany, and a circular of questions bearing on\r\nthe same subjects which she seems to have addressed to the principal\r\ninstitutions in the United Kingdom. Her evenings were spent in company\r\nwith her host and hostess. There were _soirées dansantes_ in the Rue du\r\nBac. She went once or twice with Madame Mohl to balls elsewhere, and\r\nalso to the opera. She met many English visitors and distinguished\r\nParisians. Having completed her general inquiries into the Paris\r\nhospitals, she presented herself to the Reverend Mother of the Maison de\r\nla Providence, and had arranged a day for her admission, when she was\r\nsuddenly recalled to England by the illness of her grandmother, who died\r\nat the age of ninety-five. \"Great has been the occasion for Flo's\r\nusefulness,\" wrote Mr. Nightingale to his wife. And \"I shall never be\r\nthankful enough,\" wrote Florence herself to her cousin in Paris, \"that I\r\ncame. I was able to make her be moved and changed, and to do other\r\nlittle things which perhaps smoothed the awful passage, and which\r\nperhaps would not have been done as well without me.\" A family event of\r\na different kind interested Miss Nightingale at this time. Her cousin\r\nBlanche Shore Smith had become engaged to Arthur Hugh Clough. Miss\r\nNightingale greatly liked him. As a long engagement seemed likely, Miss\r\nNightingale interested herself in the future of the young couple;\r\ndiscussing the proper limits of parental allowances in such matters;\r\ndrawing up elaborately detailed estimates of household expenditure, not\r\nforgetting to include future charges for a young family, as by the\r\nstatistics of the average birth-rate they might be calculated.\r\nStatistics were already almost a passion with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nNegotiations were now on foot for Miss Nightingale to take charge of a\r\nbenevolent institution in London, and Madame Mohl advised her to keep in\r\ntheir places the great ladies who were concerned in it. Neither now, nor\r\nat any time, was she much in love with committees, but not every word in\r\nthe following account of the negotiations need be taken very\r\nseriously:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) LEA HURST, _April_ 8. In all that you say I\r\n     cordially agree, and if you knew what the \"fashionable asses\" have\r\n     been doing, their \"offs\" and their \"ons,\" poor fools! you would say\r\n     so ten times more. I shall be truly grateful if you will write to\r\n     Pop--my people know as much of the affair now as I do--which is not\r\n     much. You see the F.A.S. (or A.F.S., which will stand for \"ancient\r\n     fathers\" and be more respectful, as they are all Puseyites), the\r\n     F.A.S. want me to come up to London now and look at them, and if we\r\n     suit to come very soon into the Sanatorium, which, I am afraid,\r\n     will preclude my coming back to Paris, especially if you are coming\r\n     away soon, for going there without you would unveil all my\r\n     iniquities, as the F.A.S. are quite as much afraid of the R.C.'s as\r\n     my people are. It is no use telling you the history of the\r\n     negotiations, which are enough to make a comedy in 50 acts. They\r\n     may be summed up as I once heard an Irish shoeless boy translate\r\n     Virgil: _Obstupui_, \"I was althegither bothered\"--_steteruntque\r\n     comae_, \"and my hair stood up like the bristles of a pig\"--_vox\r\n     faucibus haesit_, \"and divil a word could I say.\" Well, divil a bit\r\n     of a word can I say except that you are very good, dear friend, to\r\n     take so much interest, and that I shall be truly glad if you will\r\n     write to Pop, ... _dans le sens du muscle_.\r\n\r\n     All your advice, which I sent to Mrs. Bracebridge, I give my\r\n     profoundest adhesion to--I would gladly point the finger of scorn\r\n     in the liveliest manner at the F.A.S. and ride them roughshod round\r\n     Grosvenor Sq. I will even do my very best--but I am afraid it is\r\n     not in me to do it as I should wish. It would be only a poor\r\n     feint--a mean Caricature. But I will practise and you shall see me.\r\n\r\n     My people are now at 30 Old Burlington Street, where I shall be in\r\n     another week. Please write to them there, and if you can do a\r\n     little quacking for me to them, the same will be thankfully\r\n     received, in order that I may come in, when I arrive, not with my\r\n     tail between my legs, but gracefully curved round me, in the old\r\n     way in which Perugino's Devil wears it, in folds round the waist.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid I _must_ live at the place. If I don't, it will be a\r\n     half and half measure which will satisfy no one. However, I shall\r\n     take care to be perfectly free to clear off, without its being\r\n     considered a failure, at my own time. I can give you no\r\n     particulars, dearest friend, because I don't know any. I can only\r\n     say that, unless I am left a free agent and am to organize the\r\n     thing myself and not they, I will have nothing to do with it. But\r\n     as the thing is yet to be organized, I cannot lay a plan either\r\n     before you or my people. And that rather perplexes them, as they\r\n     want to make conditions that I shan't do this or that. If you would\r\n     \"well present\" my plans, as you say, to them, it would be an\r\n     inestimable benefit both to them and to me.... Hillie will tell you\r\n     all I know--that it is a Sanatorium for sick governesses managed by\r\n     a Committee of fine ladies. But there are no surgeon-students nor\r\n     improper patients there at all, which is, of course, a great\r\n     recommendation in the eyes of the Proper. The Patients, or rather\r\n     the Impatients, for I know what it is to nurse sick ladies, are all\r\n     pay patients, poor friendless folk in London. I am to have the\r\n     choosing of the house, the appointment of the Chaplain and the\r\n     management of the funds, as the F.A.S. are _at present_ minded. But\r\n     Isaiah himself could not prophesy how they will be minded at 8\r\n     o'clock this evening.\r\n\r\nWhat specially annoyed Miss Nightingale was that some of the fashionable\r\nladies in the course of gossip had begun to wonder whether her\r\nappointment would have the approval of her family. Some officious friend\r\nhad suggested that \"it would be cruel to take her away from her home.\"\r\nThis difficulty was disposed of by Miss Nightingale's assurance that the\r\nappointment would be submitted to the approval of her mother and father.\r\nHer father now agreed to make her an independent allowance, paid\r\nquarterly in advance. It was on a scale sufficiently liberal to enable\r\nher to offer her services to the Institution entirely gratuitously. She\r\nalso agreed to pay all the charges (board and lodging included) of the\r\nmatron (Mrs. Clarke), whom she was to bring with her. Another difficulty\r\nwas then raised. The superintendent of a nursing-home ought to be\r\npresent when the doctors went their rounds and when operations were\r\nperformed. But would it be seemly for a gentlewoman to do this? Miss\r\nNightingale insisted, and an agreement was arrived at in April. She was\r\nto enter upon her duties as superintendent as soon as new premises had\r\nbeen secured, and meanwhile she was free to resume her studies in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nShe returned to Paris on May 30, and after a week spent with M. and\r\nMadame Mohl, during which she again inspected various hospitals, she\r\nentered the Maison de la Providence in the Rue Oudinot on June 8. From\r\nParis she kept up correspondence with regard to the new premises for the\r\ninstitution in London. \"The indispensable conditions of a suitable house\r\nare,\" she wrote to Lady Canning (June 5), \"_first_, that the nurse\r\nshould never be obliged to quit her floor, except for her own dinner and\r\nsupper, and her patients' dinner and supper (and even the latter might\r\nbe avoided by the windlass we have talked about). Without a system of\r\nthis kind, the nurse is converted into a pair of legs. _Secondly_, That\r\nthe bells of the patients should all ring in the passage outside the\r\nnurse's own door _on that story_, and should have a valve which flies\r\nopen when its bell rings, and _remains_ open in order that the nurse may\r\nsee who has rung.\" The letter continues for some pages to describe other\r\nrequirements--about a hot-water supply and the like; points which are\r\nnow in the A B C of hospitals or nursing-homes, but which then were\r\nnovel counsels of perfection. The idea of a lift, in particular, was\r\nnew; inquiries were made by the ladies in various parts of the country,\r\nand there were many hitches before a suitable apparatus was installed.\r\nThe correspondence is significant of the attention to practical detail\r\nwhich characterized all Miss Nightingale's work. Meanwhile her work with\r\nthe Sisters of Charity among the poor came to a tiresome pause. The\r\nnurse had herself to be nursed. The nature of the calamity is described\r\nin a letter to Madame Mohl, who was paying visits in England at the\r\ntime:--\r\n\r\n     BACK DRAWING-ROOM AT MADAME MOHL'S, RUE DU BAC 120, _June_ 28.\r\n     MY DEAREST FRIENT--Do you see where I am? Here's a \"go\"! Has M. Mohl\r\n     told you? Here am I in bed in your back drawing-room. Poor M. Mohl\r\n     appears to bear it with wonderful equanimity and recueillement,\r\n     like his danseuse. Not so I. It is the most impertinent, the most\r\n     surprising, the most inopportune thing I have ever done--me\r\n     established in a lady's house in her absence, to be ill. If M. Mohl\r\n     had any sins, I should think I was the avenging Phooka appointed to\r\n     castigate him--as he has none, I am obliged to arrest myself at the\r\n     other supposition that it is for my own. It was not my fault though\r\n     really. Here is how the things have happened....\r\n\r\n     I have had the measles at the S[oe]urs. And, of all my adventures,\r\n     of which I have had many and queer, as will be (never) recorded in\r\n     the Book of my Wanderings, the dirtiest and the queerest I have\r\n     ever had has been a measles in the cell of a S[oe]ur de la Charité.\r\n     They were very kind to me--and dear M. Mohl wrote to me almost\r\n     every day, and sent me tea (which, however, they would not let me\r\n     have), and he lastly, in his paternity, would have me back (where I\r\n     came yesterday), and established me in the back drawing-room, to my\r\n     infinite horror, and now I am getting better very fast, and mean to\r\n     be out again in a day or two. I had got rid of the eruption and all\r\n     that before I came. M. Mohl is _so_ kind and comes to see me and talk,\r\n     which I suppose is very improper, but I can't help it, and he has been\r\n     like a father to me and never was _such_ a father! I really am so\r\n     ashamed of all his kindness, and the trouble I give them, that my\r\n     brazen old face blushes crimson, and I assure you this paper ought to\r\n     be red. Julie [the servant] is very kind to me. But I hope not to be\r\n     long on their hands. As to my calamity itself, it is like the Mariage\r\n     de Mademoiselle: who could have foreseen it? It really was not my\r\n     fault. There was no measles at any of my posts, and I had had them not\r\n     eighteen months ago, so that, erect in the consciousness of that\r\n     dignity, I should not have kept out of their way, if I had seen them.\r\n     The Dr. would not believe I could have had them before. Well, I'm so\r\n     ashamed of myself that I shall lock myself up for the rest of my life,\r\n     and never go nowhere no more. For you see, it's evident that\r\n     Providence, who was always in my way, and who, as the Supérieure\r\n     said, is _très admirable_ (meaning wonderful) in having done this,\r\n     does not mean me to come to Paris nor to the S[oe]urs, having twice\r\n     made me ill when I was doing so--and given you all this trouble.\r\n     For me to come to Paris to have the measles a second time, is like\r\n     going to the Grand Desert to die of getting one's feet wet, or\r\n     anything most unexpected.... Please write to M. Mohl, and comfort\r\n     him for his disaster. I am so repentant that I can say\r\n     nothing--which, the Catholics tell me, is the \"marque\" of a true\r\n     \"humiliation.\" Thank you a thousand times for all your kindness. I\r\n     come to England next week.                          F. N.\r\n\r\nM. Mohl required no comfort. Miss Nightingale's father wrote to thank\r\nhim for his kindness to her. The kindness, he gallantly replied, was on\r\nher side in giving him the advantage of her society and conversation.\r\n\"Her gentle manner,\" he wrote (July 25), \"covers such a depth and\r\nstrength of mind and thought, that I am afraid of nothing for her, but\r\nthat her health should fail her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nConvalescence was rapid. On July 13 she returned to London, and a month\r\nlater, on August 12, 1853, Miss Nightingale went into residence in her\r\nfirst \"situation.\" The place in question, already briefly described in\r\none of her letters to Madame Mohl, was that of Superintendent of an\r\n\"Establishment for Gentlewomen during Illness.\" This institution had\r\nbeen founded a few years before, at 8 Chandos Street, Cavendish Square,\r\nto give medical assistance and a home to sick governesses and other\r\ngentlewomen of narrow means. It was managed by a Council, which in its\r\nturn appointed a \"Committee of Ladies\" and a \"Committee of Gentlemen.\"\r\nWe need not trouble ourselves with the relations between the two\r\ncommittees, though they much troubled Miss Nightingale; but it is\r\ncharacteristic of the ideas of the time that the ladies made over to the\r\ngentlemen \"all payments, contracts, and financial arrangements,\" as also\r\n\"the selection of medical officers and male servants.\" Some years later\r\nKinglake devoted several pages of his most elaborate satire to a\r\ncomparison of the male pretensions and the female performances in their\r\nrespective spheres in the hospitals of the Crimea; but on the present\r\noccasion Miss Nightingale found the ladies more difficult than the\r\ngentlemen. The institution had languished in Chandos Street. She was\r\ncalled in to give it new life. Suitable new premises had been found at\r\nNo. 1 Upper Harley Street, and there Miss Nightingale lived, with a few\r\nbrief intervals, until October 1854. She had also a _pied-à-terre_ in\r\nsome lodgings taken for her by her aunt in Pall Mall, where she\r\noccasionally saw her friends, and whither she resorted on Sunday\r\nmornings, in order not to scandalize the patients in Harley Street by\r\nbeing known not to go to church. She had stipulated for extensive\r\npowers of control, and she was not one to let any agreed powers suffer\r\ndiminution from desuetude. The ladies on the Council and the Committee\r\nincluded (besides Lady Canning already mentioned) Lady Ellesmere, Lady\r\nCranworth, Lady Monteagle, Lady Caroline Murray, and others well known\r\nin the worlds of society and philanthropy. Miss Nightingale had her\r\nspecial friends and allies among them, such as Lady Canning and Lady\r\nInglis, and Mrs. Sidney Herbert presently joined the Committee in order\r\nto lend her support. Since their meeting in Rome, Mrs. Herbert and Miss\r\nNightingale had seen much of each other, for Wilton House was within\r\ncalling distance of Embley. Miss Nightingale had assisted at the birth\r\nof one of Mrs. Herbert's children; and amongst Miss Nightingale's papers\r\nbelonging to this period is a \"Syllabus of Religious Teaching for a\r\nGirls' School,\" which they had adapted from the Madre S. Colomba's\r\nlessons to girls. Mrs. Herbert now wrote from Wilton, offering to come\r\nup to a committee meeting: \"I thought some wicked cats might be there\r\nwho would set up their backs; and if so, I should like to have mine up\r\ntoo.\" And, again: \"I hope you will write to me, dearest Flo, should any\r\nlittle difficulties arise whilst we are out of town.\"\r\n\r\nDifficulties did arise in plenty, but Miss Nightingale was sometimes\r\nperemptory, and at other times showed herself a master in the gentle art\r\nof managing committees:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) 1 UPPER HARLEY ST., _August_ 20.... Clarkey\r\n     dear, I would write, but I can't. I have had to prepare this\r\n     immense house for patients in ten days--without a bit of help but\r\n     only hindrance from my Committee. If M. Mohl would write a book\r\n     upon English societies, I would supply him with such Statistics as\r\n     would astonish even him. But it's no use talking about these\r\n     things, and I've no time. I have been \"in service\" ten days, and\r\n     have had to furnish an entirely empty house in that time. We take\r\n     in patients this Monday, and have not got our workmen out yet.\r\n\r\n     My Committee refused me to take in _Catholic_ patients--whereupon I\r\n     wished them good-morning, unless I might take in Jews and their\r\n     Rabbis to attend them. So now it is settled, and _in print_, that\r\n     we are to take in all denominations whatever, and allow them to be\r\n     visited by their respective priests and Muftis, provided _I_ will\r\n     receive (in any case _whatsoever_ that is _not_ of the Church of\r\n     England) the obnoxious animal at the door, take him upstairs\r\n     myself, remain while he is conferring with his patient, make myself\r\n     _responsible_ that he does not speak to, or look at, _any one\r\n     else_, and bring him downstairs again in a noose, and out into the\r\n     street. And to this I have agreed! And this is in print!\r\n\r\n     Amen. From Committees, charity, and Schism--from the Church of\r\n     England and all other deadly sin--from philanthropy and all the\r\n     deceits of the Devil, Good Lord, deliver us.\r\n\r\n     In great haste, ever yours overflowingly. It will do me so much\r\n     good to see a good man again.\r\n\r\n     (_To her Father._) 1 UPPER HARLEY ST., _December_ 3 [1853]. DEAR\r\n     PAPA--You ask for my observations upon _my_ line of statesmanship. I\r\n     have been so very busy that I have scarcely made any résumé in my own\r\n     mind, but upon doing so now for your benefit, I perceive:--\r\n\r\n     When I entered into service here, I determined that, happen what\r\n     would, I _never_ would intrigue among the Committee. Now I perceive\r\n     that I do all my business by intrigue. I propose in private to A,\r\n     B, or C the resolution I think A, B, or C most capable of carrying\r\n     in committee, and then leave it to them, and I always win.\r\n\r\n     I am now in the hey-day of my power. At the last General Committee\r\n     they proposed and carried (without my knowing anything about it) a\r\n     resolution that I should have £50 per month to spend for the House,\r\n     and wrote to the Treasurer to advance it me. Whereupon I wrote to\r\n     the Treasurer to refuse it me. Lady----, who was my greatest enemy,\r\n     is now, I understand, trumpeting my fame through London. And all\r\n     because I have reduced their expenditure from 1s. 10d. per head per\r\n     day to 1s. The opinions of others concerning you depend, not at\r\n     all, or very little, upon what _you_ are, but upon what _they_ are.\r\n     Praise and blame are alike indifferent to me, as constituting an\r\n     indication of what myself is, though very precious as the\r\n     indication of the other's feeling....\r\n\r\n     Last General Committee I executed a series of Resolutions on five\r\n     subjects, and presented them as coming from the Medical Men:--\r\n\r\n     1. That the successor to our House Surgeon (resigned) should be a\r\n     dispenser, and dispense the medicines in the house, saving our bill\r\n     at the druggist's of £150 per annum.\r\n\r\n     2. A series of House Rules, of which I send you the rough copy.\r\n\r\n     3. A series of resolutions about not _keeping_ patients, of which I\r\n     send you the foul copy.\r\n\r\n     4. A complete revolution as to Diet, which is shamefully abused at\r\n     present.\r\n\r\n     5. An advertisement for the Institution, of which I send the foul\r\n     copy.\r\n\r\n     All these I proposed and carried in Committee, without telling them\r\n     that they came from _me_ and not from the Medical Men; and then,\r\n     and not till then, I showed them to the Medical Men, without\r\n     telling _them_ that they were already passed _in committee_.\r\n\r\n     It was a bold stroke, but success is said to make an insurrection\r\n     into a revolution. The Medical Men have had two meetings upon them,\r\n     and approved them all _nem. con._, and thought they were their own.\r\n     And I came off with flying colours, no one suspecting my intrigue,\r\n     which of course would ruin me were it known, as there is as much\r\n     jealousy in the Committee of one another, and among the Medical Men\r\n     of one another, as ever what's his name had of Marlborough.\r\n\r\n     I have also carried my point of having good, harmless Mr.----as\r\n     Chaplain; and no young curate to have spiritual flirtations with my\r\n     young ladies.\r\n\r\n     And so much for the earthquakes in this little mole-hill of ours.\r\n\r\n     (_To her Father._) ... I send you some more documentary\r\n     evidence--the tail of my Quarterly Report. My Committee are such\r\n     children in administration that I am obliged to tell them such\r\n     obvious truths as are contained in what _I make the Medical Men\r\n     say_. This place is exactly like the administering of the Poor Law.\r\n     We have cases of purely lazy fits and cases deserted by their\r\n     families. And my Committee have not the courage to discharge a\r\n     single case. _They_ say the Medical Men must do it. The Medical Men\r\n     say _they_ won't, although the cases, they say, _must_ be\r\n     discharged. And I always have to do it, as the stop-gap on all\r\n     occasions.\r\n\r\nBy such arts, and by such readiness to shoulder responsibility, Miss\r\nNightingale reduced chaos to order, and her management of the\r\nInstitution won praise in all quarters. It was hard work, for the Lady\r\nSuperintendent was here, there, and everywhere, shepherding those who\r\nhad cure of souls, managing the nurses, assisting at operations,\r\nchecking waste in the coal-cellar or the larder. When a thing wanted to\r\nbe done, she did it herself. Mrs. Herbert heard with anxiety that her\r\nfriend had strained her back by lifting a patient, though she was\r\nsuffering from lumbago at the time. There were smaller worries too. The\r\nBritish workman, and the British tradesman also, tried her sorely. \"The\r\nchemists,\" she wrote to her father, \"sent me a bottle of ether labelled\r\nS. spirits of nitre, which, if I had not smelt it, I should certainly\r\nhave administered, and should have had an inquiry into poisoning. And\r\nthe whole flue of a new gas-stove came down the second time of using it,\r\nwhich, if I had not caught it in my arms, would certainly have killed a\r\npatient.\" Then there were the anxieties necessarily incident to a\r\nnursing home. \"We have had an awful disappointment,\" she wrote to her\r\nfather (1854), \"in a couching for a cataract, which has failed. The eye\r\nis lost (through _no_ fault of Bowman's), and I am left, after a most\r\nanxious watching, with a poor blind woman on my hands, whom we have\r\nblinded, and with a prospect of insanity. I had rather ten times have\r\nkilled her. These are the cases, not those like the poor German who\r\ndied, which make _our_ lives so anxious.\" What was afterwards to\r\ncharacterize her work in a larger field was already observed in Harley\r\nStreet. It was the combination of masterful powers of organization with\r\nwomanly gentleness and sympathy. Letters of gratitude, which she\r\nreceived from patients after their discharge from Harley Street, speak\r\nof her \"unwearied and affectionate attention.\" They were often addressed\r\nto her as \"My good, dear, and faithful Friend,\" or \"My darling Mother.\"\r\nAnd a friend and mother she was indeed to many of the young women who\r\ncame under her care. She had a large and influential circle of friends\r\nand acquaintances, and she was indefatigable in finding convalescent\r\nhomes or sympathetic care, or openings in the Colonies, for those who\r\nstood in need of such assistance. She was much interested in the scheme\r\nfor Female Emigration, which Sidney Herbert had started in 1849, and in\r\nwhich he and his wife superintended every detail.[65]\r\n\r\n  [65] See _Stanmore_, vol. i. pp. 111-120.\r\n\r\nThough the work was hard and the anxieties many, Miss Nightingale did\r\nnot lose heart. \"Our vocation is a difficult one,\" she wrote to Miss\r\nNicholson (Jan. 10, 1854), \"as you, I am sure, know; and though there\r\nare many consolations, and very high ones, the disappointments are so\r\nnumerous that we require all our faith and trust. But that is enough. I\r\nhave never repented nor looked back, not for one moment. And I begin the\r\nNew Year with more true feeling of a happy New Year than ever I had in\r\nmy life.\" She had found her vocation. But her family had not yet quite\r\nfully accepted it. On their side there was still some looking back. Her\r\nfather, indeed, took pride in his daughter's success, and the\r\ncorrespondence between them at this time is very pleasant. He was\r\nhimself a county magistrate, concerned in the administration of\r\nhospitals and asylums; and he followed every move in his daughter's\r\nstrategy with lively interest. He admired her masterfulness, but was not\r\nquite sure that she might not carry it too far. \"You will have,\" he\r\nwrote, \"to govern by a representative system after all. In England we go\r\nthis way to work, and a good way it is, for a good autocrat is only to\r\nbe found at intervals. Despots do nothing in teaching others.\r\nRepublicans keep teaching each other all day long.\" He was most\r\nsympathetic in her difficulties, but he was not sure that those about\r\nhim would be so. There is a postscript in one of his letters which tells\r\na good deal between the lines: \"Better write to me at the Athenæum so as\r\nnot to excite inquiry.\" Her mother and sister seem to have thought that\r\nwhile they were in London Florence might have lived at home, or, at any\r\nrate, have often been with them. Why should she be wearing herself out\r\naway from them? Their point of view was put by Madame Mohl, who was the\r\naffectionate friend of both sisters:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Madame Mohl._) HARLEY STREET, _August_ 27 [1853].... I have\r\n     not taken this step, Clarkey dear, without years of anxious\r\n     consideration. It is the result of the experience of years and of\r\n     the fullest and deepest thought; it has not been done without\r\n     advice, and it is a step, which, being the growth of so long, is\r\n     not likely to be repented of or reconsidered. I mean the step of\r\n     leaving them. I do not wish to talk about it--and this is the last\r\n     time I shall ever do so, but as you ask me a plain question,\r\n     Clarkey dear, I will give you a plain answer. I _have_ talked\r\n     matters over (\"made a clean breast,\" as you express it) with\r\n     Parthe, _not once but thousands of times_. Years and years have\r\n     been spent in doing so. It has been, therefore, with the deepest\r\n     consideration and with the fullest advice that I have taken the\r\n     step of leaving home, and it is a _fait accompli_. With regard to\r\n     \"_my_ sacrificing my peace and comfort,\" it is true that I am\r\n     _here_ entirely for their sakes. But to serve my country in this\r\n     _way_ has been also the object of my life, though I should not have\r\n     done it in this time or manner. But it is not a sacrifice any more\r\n     than that I have done a thing in a bad way, which I should fain\r\n     have done in a good one. For _this_ is sure to fail. So farewell,\r\n     Clarkey dear, don't let us talk any more about this. It is, as I\r\n     said before, a _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\nHaving at so great difficulty won her freedom, Florence clearly felt\r\nthat any policy of half-and-half now might necessitate in the future a\r\nrenewal of the struggle. Her sister was still in very delicate health,\r\nand Florence was advised, by the family doctor himself, that her visits\r\ninvolved much disturbing excitement. Besides, the work at Harley Street,\r\nif it was to be done efficiently, required constant residence and\r\nunremitting attention. And it was written: \"He that loveth father or\r\nmother more than me is not worthy of me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nIn August 1854 Miss Nightingale took a few days' holiday at Lea Hurst,\r\nwhere Mrs. Gaskell, the authoress, was on a visit to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nNightingale. It was then that Mrs. Gaskell wrote the description of\r\nFlorence's personal appearance, which has already been given (p. 39).\r\nMrs. Gaskell was struck no less by the beauty of her character. She gave\r\na sketch of Miss Nightingale's career, and then continued: \"Is it not\r\nlike St. Elizabeth of Hungary? The efforts of her family to interest her\r\nin other occupations by allowing her to travel, etc.--but the clinging\r\nto one object! She must be a creature of another race, so high and\r\nangelic, doing things by impulse or some divine inspiration, not by\r\neffort and struggle of will. But she seems almost too holy to be talked\r\nabout as a mere wonder. Mrs. Nightingale says with tears in her eyes\r\n(alluding to Andersen's _Fairy Tales_), that they are ducks, and have\r\nhatched a wild swan. She seems as completely led by God as Joan of Arc.\r\nI never heard of any one like her. It makes me feel the _livingness_ of\r\nGod more than ever to think how straight He is sending His Spirit down\r\ninto her as into the prophets and saints of old....\" And in another\r\nletter:[66] \"I am glad that Miss----likes _North and South_. I did not\r\nthink Margaret _was_ so _over_ good. What would she say to Florence\r\nNightingale? I can't imagine! for _there_ is intellect such as I never\r\ncame in contact with before in woman!--only twice in man--great beauty,\r\nand of her holy goodness who is fit to speak?\" A famous writer has said\r\nof the saints, that the greatest and most helpful of them have always\r\nshown some wit or humour;[67] and of Florence Nightingale Mrs. Gaskell\r\nnoted further: \"She has a great deal of fun, and is carried along by\r\nthat, I think. She mimics most capitally.\"\r\n\r\n  [66] To Catherine Winkworth, Jan. 1, 1855.\r\n\r\n  [67] See Ruskin's _Works_, vol. xxxi. p. 386, vol. xxxii. p. 72.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale cut short her holiday on hearing that an epidemic of\r\ncholera had broken out in London. She volunteered to give help with the\r\ncholera patients in the Middlesex Hospital. She was up day and night\r\nreceiving the women patients--chiefly, it seems, outcasts in the\r\ndistrict of Soho--undressing them, and ministering to them. The\r\nepidemic, however, subsided, and she returned to her normal work in\r\nHarley Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThe work there did not fail within its appointed scope, but in another\r\nway the failure which Miss Nightingale had predicted in her letter to\r\nMadame Mohl soon became apparent. The scale of the undertaking was more\r\nrestricted than Florence had desired, and she saw no means of widening\r\nit. She had wanted to receive patients of all classes, to enrol many\r\nvolunteer nurses, to have opportunities for training them. Among a wide\r\ncircle, both at home and abroad, her knowledge and her talents were well\r\nunderstood; and already, in her correspondence for a year or two past,\r\nshe appears as a woman to whom reference was made as to one speaking\r\nwith authority. A missionary in Paris applied to her for two\r\nwell-qualified matrons. \"Alas,\" she had to reply, \"I have no fish of\r\nthat kind.\" She was making the most of her present opportunity, but it\r\nwas narrow. Some of her friends had thought from the first that she was\r\nwasting her powers on unsuitable soil in Harley Street. Monckton Milnes,\r\nwho paid a visit to Embley in December 1853, wrote to his wife: \"They\r\ntalk quite easily about Florence, but her position does not seem very\r\nsuitable. I wish we could put her at the head of a Juvenile\r\nReformatory.\"[68] Her own primary object was to train nurses; and other\r\nfriends--Mrs. Bracebridge among the number--advised her to leave Harley\r\nStreet, since there she found no scope for so doing. King's College\r\nHospital had just been rebuilt, and another friend, Miss Louisa Twining,\r\nopened negotiations in August 1854 for securing Miss Nightingale's\r\nappointment as Superintendent of Nurses there. Some of the medical men,\r\nwho had been impressed at Harley Street with her rare combination of\r\ngifts, were most anxious that she should consent to take up such a post.\r\nDr. William Bowman in particular strongly pressed her, and was confident\r\nthat, if she agreed, he could get the appointment _en train_ in the\r\nautumn. Miss Nightingale's mother and sister sought as strongly to\r\ndissuade her. The sister laid stress on Florence's \"doubtful health.\"\r\nThe mother added objections on the score of the medical students. They\r\nboth urged that, if she must do something of the kind, Great Ormond\r\nStreet and work among children were more suitable and convenient.\r\nFlorence herself was greatly drawn to King's College Hospital, and began\r\ndevising plans, on the model of Kaiserswerth, for enrolling a staff of\r\nnurses among farmers' daughters.\r\n\r\n  [68] _Life of Lord Houghton_, vol. i. p. 491.\r\n\r\nBut the immediate future hid in it another fate for Florence\r\nNightingale. \"Thy lot or portion in life,\" said the Caliph Ali, \"is\r\nseeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.\" So Miss\r\nNightingale may have read in Emerson; and in homelier phrase her good\r\nAunt Mai had said to her, \"If you will but be ready for _it_, something\r\nis getting ready for you, and will be sure to turn up in time.\" Which\r\nthings Florence, I doubt not, laid up in her heart. When news began to\r\narrive from the East, did she recall a prophecy which had been made\r\nabout her by a friend long before the Crimean War was dreamt of? Lady\r\nLovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, the \"Ada sole daughter of my home\r\nand heart,\" had, before her death in 1852, written a poem in honour of\r\nher friend, Florence Nightingale. I have quoted some of it already. The\r\npiece ends with a presage:--\r\n\r\n              In future years, in distant climes,\r\n                Should war's dread strife its victims claim,\r\n              Should pestilence, unchecked betimes,\r\n                Strike more than sword, than cannon maim,\r\n              He who then reads these truthful rhymes\r\n                Will trace her progress to undying fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PART II\r\n\r\n                              THE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\n                                (1854-1856)\r\n\r\n\r\n             Who is the happy Warrior?

O pioneers!\r\n                                                  WALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\nOn September 20 the Battle of the Alma was fought, and the country, as\r\nGreville noted, was \"in a fever of excitement.\" The disembarkation of\r\nthe allied British and French forces for the invasion of the Crimea had\r\nbegun on the 14th. Their advance was not resisted until they reached the\r\nbank of the Alma, where the Russian commander was awaiting attack, in so\r\nstrong a position that he was confident of victory. In less than three\r\nhours the allied troops had driven the enemy from every part of the\r\nground. Lord Raglan, the Commander of the Forces, congratulated the\r\ntroops on \"the brilliant success that attended their unrivalled efforts\r\nin the battle, on which occasion they carried a most formidable\r\nposition, defended by large masses of Russian infantry, and a most\r\npowerful and numerous artillery.\" The river which the Russian commander\r\nhad hoped to make the grave of the invaders became famous in the annals\r\nof British valour:--\r\n\r\n     Thou, on England's banners blazoned with the famous fields of old,\r\n     Shalt, where other fields are winning, wave above the brave and bold;\r\n     And our sons unborn shall nerve them for some great deed to be done,\r\n     By that twentieth of September, when the Alma's heights were won.\r\n     O thou river! dear for ever to the gallant, to the free,\r\n     Alma! roll thy waters proudly, proudly roll them to the sea!\r\n\r\nNearly forty years had passed since the British army had been engaged in\r\nEuropean warfare. The Battle of the Alma, though it disclosed little\r\ntactical skill, and though it was not followed up as it might have been,\r\nhad at any rate shown the desperate courage of the British soldier. The\r\nnote of exultation which inspired the verses of Archbishop Trench\r\nexpressed the popular mood.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a change. The number of killed and wounded was very\r\nlarge; but though many homes were thrown into mourning, it was felt, in\r\nthe words of the official bulletin, that such a victory \"could not be\r\nachieved without a considerable sacrifice.\" The country did not at the\r\ntime grudge the sacrifice; but Lord Raglan's dispatch was followed by\r\nanother. The Crimean War was the first in which the \"Special\r\nCorrespondent\" played a conspicuous part, and the dispatches sent to the\r\n_Times_ by Mr. William Howard Russell availed even to overthrow a\r\nMinistry. In the _Times_ of October 9, attention was drawn to the\r\nfutility of the nursing arrangements on the British side. The old\r\npensioners, who had been sent out for such service, were \"not of the\r\nslightest use\"; the soldiers had to \"attend upon each other.\" On the\r\n12th a long letter from \"Our Special Correspondent,\" dated\r\n\"Constantinople, September 30,\" ended with the following passage:--\r\n\r\n     It is with feelings of surprise and anger that the public will\r\n     learn that no sufficient preparations have been made for the proper\r\n     care of the wounded. Not only are there not sufficient\r\n     surgeons--that, it might be urged, was unavoidable; not only are\r\n     there no dressers and nurses--that might be a defect of system for\r\n     which no one is to blame; but what will be said when it is known\r\n     that there is not even linen to make bandages for the wounded? The\r\n     greatest commiseration prevails for the sufferings of the unhappy\r\n     inmates of Scutari, and every family is giving sheets and old\r\n     garments to supply their wants. But why could not this clearly\r\n     foreseen want have been supplied? Can it be said that the Battle of\r\n     the Alma has been an event to take the world by surprise? Has not\r\n     the expedition to the Crimea been the talk of the last four months?\r\n     And when the Turks gave up to our use the vast barracks to form a\r\n     hospital and depot, was it not on the ground that the loss of the\r\n     English troops was sure to be considerable when engaged in so\r\n     dangerous an enterprise? And yet, after the troops have been six\r\n     months in the country, there is no preparation for the commonest\r\n     surgical operations! Not only are the men kept, in some cases, for\r\n     a week without the hand of a medical man coming near their wounds;\r\n     not only are they left to expire in agony, unheeded and shaken off,\r\n     though catching desperately at the surgeon whenever he makes his\r\n     rounds through the fetid ship; but now, when they are placed in the\r\n     spacious building, where we were led to believe that everything was\r\n     ready which could ease their pain or facilitate their recovery, it\r\n     is found that the commonest appliances of a workhouse sick-ward are\r\n     wanting, and that the men must die through the medical staff of the\r\n     British army having forgotten that old rags are necessary for the\r\n     dressing of wounds. If Parliament were sitting, some notice would\r\n     probably be taken of these facts, which are notorious and have\r\n     excited much concern; as it is, it rests with the Government to\r\n     make inquiries into the conduct of those who have so greatly\r\n     neglected their duty.\r\n\r\nOn the following day a further letter from the \"Special Correspondent\"\r\nwas published. \"It is impossible,\" he wrote, \"for any one to see the\r\nmelancholy sights of the last few days without feelings of surprise and\r\nindignation at the deficiencies of our medical system. The manner in\r\nwhich the sick and wounded are treated is worthy only of the savages of\r\nDahomey.... The worn-out pensioners who were brought as an ambulance\r\ncorps are totally useless, and not only are surgeons not to be had, but\r\nthere are no dressers or nurses to carry out the surgeon's directions,\r\nand to attend on the sick during the intervals between his visits. Here\r\nthe French are greatly our superiors. Their medical arrangements are\r\nextremely good, their surgeons more numerous, and they have also the\r\nhelp of the Sisters of Charity, who have accompanied the expedition in\r\nincredible numbers.[69] These devoted women are excellent nurses.\" These\r\nscathing attacks changed the mood of the country. There was still\r\nexultation in victory, and still readiness to pay its price; but the\r\n\"Special Correspondent's\" charges of neglect towards the sick and\r\nwounded raised a feeling of bitter resentment--of resentment against the\r\nauthorities, but also of pity for the victims. The _Times_ accompanied\r\nthe \"Special Correspondent's\" letter on October 12 by a leading article,\r\nmaking appeal to its readers, who were sitting comfortably at home, to\r\nbestir themselves, and render such help as might be possible to the\r\nsoldiers in the East. A letter was published next day from Sir Robert\r\nPeel, who had enclosed £200 to start a fund for supplying the sick and\r\nwounded with comforts. Other contributions were quickly forthcoming, and\r\non October 14 a letter was published asking: \"Why have we no Sisters of\r\nCharity? There are numbers of able-bodied and tender-hearted English\r\nwomen who would joyfully and with alacrity go out to devote themselves\r\nto nursing the sick and wounded, if they could be associated for that\r\npurpose, and placed under proper protection.\"\r\n\r\n  [69] For the actual number, see below, p. 149.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThere were those among the ladies of England who had not waited to be\r\nstung into action by such appeals. On the first news of the failure of\r\nthe British nursing arrangements, they had asked themselves whether they\r\nmight not help, not merely by money, but by personal service. One of the\r\nfirst to move was Lady Maria Forester. She must have read and marked the\r\nletter in the _Times_ on October 9, for already by October 11 she had\r\nplaced herself in communication with Miss Nightingale, offering money to\r\nsend out some trained nurses. \"I was so anxious something should be\r\ndone,\" she said to Lady Verney, \"that I would have gone myself, only I\r\nknew that I should not have been the slightest use.\" Happily the minds\r\nof those who could be of the greatest use were moving in the same\r\ndirection. If a party of women nurses were to be sent out to the East\r\nwith any prospect of success, there were two persons in England whose\r\nco-operation was essential, and by fortunate chance they were personal\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOne was Mr. Sidney Herbert, the Secretary _at_ War. The preposition\r\nwhich I have placed in italics must be noted. The reader would not thank\r\nme for entering at length into all the intricacies of War Office\r\norganization, disorganization, and reorganization, which went on during\r\nthe Crimean War, and have continued to our own day. But this much it is\r\nnecessary to remember, that in 1854 there was a Secretary _for_ War (the\r\nDuke of Newcastle) and a Secretary _at_ War (Mr. Sidney Herbert). The\r\ncurious part of the arrangement was that the Secretary _at_ War had\r\nnothing to do with war, as such; he was, technically, only a financial\r\nand accounting official. But Mr. Sidney Herbert, in the emergency\r\ncreated by the Crimean War, stepped courageously beyond the strict\r\nbounds of his office. He had already shown himself by many beneficent\r\nmeasures of practical reform to be the Soldiers' Friend. He was deeply\r\ninterested, as we have heard (p. 80), in the care of the sick. He knew\r\nhow over-worked was his colleague, the Duke of Newcastle, and in this\r\nmatter of hospitals he assumed the position of volunteer delegate of the\r\nSecretary of State. \"I wish,\" wrote Mr. Gladstone to Monckton Milnes\r\n(Oct. 15, 1855), \"that some one of the thousand who in prose justly\r\ncelebrate Miss Nightingale would say a single word for the man of\r\n'routine' who devised and projected her going.\"[70] Lord Stanmore has\r\nsaid not a word, but a volume, in that sense; what was truly admirable\r\nwas \"the man of routine's\" bold departure from routine. The employment\r\nof female nurses in the army was in this country entirely novel. It\r\nwould probably excite some jealousy in the medical profession; it was\r\nsure to be criticized by the military men. The Cabinet had much else to\r\nthink of. The Duke of Newcastle had more on his hands than any one human\r\nbeing could properly accomplish. Mr. Herbert, from his influence in the\r\nCabinet, from his winning manner and general popularity, was the man to\r\ncarry through the new departure. He had pondered long over the problems\r\nof nursing, both in military hospitals and in civil life. He could see\r\nno reason why a task, which in civil life was entrusted almost\r\nexclusively to women, should in the case of military hospitals be\r\nconfined to men. The French Government had sent out fifty Sisters of\r\nMercy. Mr. Herbert could see no reason why England should not do\r\nsomething of a like kind. He determined to make the experiment.\r\n\r\n  [70] _Life of Lord Houghton_, vol. i. p. 521.\r\n\r\nHe was strengthened in his resolve by the fact that he was intimately\r\nacquainted with the character and the powers of the second indispensable\r\nperson. He knew Miss Florence Nightingale. The preceding Part of this\r\nvolume has shown by \"what circuit first\" her life had been one long\r\npreparation for precisely such work as was now wanted. She and the\r\nMinister had read the dispatch in the _Times_ with equal, if different,\r\ninterest. To Mr. Herbert it came as a call for something to be done, if\r\nthe Ministry were to avoid dangerous criticism; and to this motive,\r\nwhich must rightly actuate every Minister, there was added the\r\nconscience of a high-minded man, sincerely and eagerly anxious to do all\r\nthat was possible to improve the treatment of the sick and wounded\r\nsoldiers. To Miss Nightingale, as she read the dispatch, and the\r\nstirring appeal which accompanied it, the words came with something of\r\nthe force of a call from Above. For nearly ten years of her life she had\r\nconsciously yearned, and half-consciously for a much larger period,\r\nafter ample scope in which to exercise her power of organization, and\r\nher desire to serve the sick and suffering. During many of those years\r\nshe had been training herself so as to be ready to use her opportunity\r\nwhen it should occur. And here was the opportunity at hand, in which\r\npatriotism confirmed her personal aspirations. \"God's good time\" had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe minds of the Minister and of Miss Nightingale were kindled together.\r\nThey reached the flash-point of action at almost an identical moment.\r\nPrivate initiative forestalled official overtures only by a few hours.\r\nWorking in harmony, they carried the scheme into operation with an\r\nunparalleled rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nWithin two days of the publication of the dispatch from Constantinople,\r\nMiss Nightingale and her friends had made their plans. She submitted\r\nthem to the Minister in the following letter addressed to his wife:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Mrs. Herbert_.) 1 UPPER HARLEY STREET,\r\n     _October_ 14 [1854]. MY DEAREST--I went to Belgrave Square this\r\n     morning for the chance of catching you or Mr. Herbert even, had he\r\n     been in town.\r\n\r\n     A small private expedition of nurses has been organized for\r\n     Scutari, and I have been asked to command it. I take myself out and\r\n     one nurse.\r\n\r\n     Lady Maria Forester has given £200 to take out three others. We\r\n     feed and lodge ourselves there, and are to be no expense whatever\r\n     to the country. Lord Clarendon has been asked by Lord Palmerston to\r\n     write to Lord Stratford for us, and has consented. Dr. Andrew Smith\r\n     of the Army Medical Board, whom I have seen, authorizes us, and\r\n     gives us letters to the Chief Medical Officer at Scutari.\r\n\r\n     I do not mean to say that I believe the _Times_ accounts, but I do\r\n     believe that we may be of use to the wounded wretches.\r\n\r\n     Now to business.\r\n\r\n     (1) Unless my Ladies' Committee feel that this is a thing which\r\n     appeals to the sympathies of all, and urge me, rather than barely\r\n     consent, I cannot honourably break my engagement here. And I write\r\n     to you as one of my mistresses.\r\n\r\n     (2) What does Mr. Herbert say to the scheme itself? Does he think\r\n     it will be objected to by the authorities? Would he give us any\r\n     advice or letters of recommendation? And are there any stores for\r\n     the Hospital he would advise us to take out? Dr. Smith says that\r\n     nothing is needed.\r\n\r\n     I enclose a letter from E. Do you think it any use to apply to Miss\r\n     Burdett Coutts?\r\n\r\n     We start on Tuesday if we go, to catch the Marseilles boat of the\r\n     21st for Constantinople, where I leave my nurses, thinking the\r\n     Medical Staff at Scutari will be more frightened than amused at\r\n     being bombarded by a parcel of women, and I cross over to Scutari\r\n     with some one from the Embassy to present my credentials from Dr.\r\n     Smith, and put ourselves at the disposal of the Drs.\r\n\r\n     (3) Would you or some one of my Committee write to Lady Stratford\r\n     to say, \"This is not a lady but a real Hospital Nurse,\" of me? \"And\r\n     she has had experience.\"\r\n\r\n     My uncle went down this morning to ask my father and mother's\r\n     consent.\r\n\r\n     Would there be any use in my applying to the Duke of Newcastle for\r\n     his authority?\r\n\r\n     Believe me, dearest, in haste, ever yours,\r\n                                                F. NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps it is better to keep it quite a private thing, and not\r\n     apply to Gov^t. _qua_ Gov^t.\r\n\r\nThis letter was posted on Saturday. Mr. Herbert had left London to spend\r\nSunday at Bournemouth, and thence, unaware of the communication which\r\nwas on its way to him from Miss Nightingale, he addressed the following\r\nletter to her:--\r\n\r\n     (_Sidney Herbert to Miss Nightingale._) BOURNEMOUTH, _October_ 15\r\n     [1854]. DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE--You will have seen in the papers\r\n     that there is a great deficiency of nurses at the Hospital at\r\n     Scutari.\r\n\r\n     The other alleged deficiencies, namely of medical men, lint,\r\n     sheets, etc., must, if they have really ever existed, have been\r\n     remedied ere this, as the number of medical officers with the army\r\n     amounted to one to every 95 men in the whole force, being nearly\r\n     double what we have ever had before, and 30 more surgeons went out\r\n     3 weeks ago, and would by this time, therefore, be at\r\n     Constantinople. A further supply went on Thursday, and a fresh\r\n     batch sail next week.\r\n\r\n     As to medical stores, they have been sent out in profusion; lint by\r\n     the _ton_ weight, 15,000 pairs of sheets, medicine, wine, arrowroot\r\n     in the same proportion; and the only way of accounting for the\r\n     deficiency at Scutari, if it exists, is that the mass of stores\r\n     went to Varna, and was not sent back when the army left for the\r\n     Crimea; but four days would have remedied this. In the meanwhile\r\n     fresh stores are arriving.\r\n\r\n     But the deficiency of female nurses is undoubted, none but male\r\n     nurses having ever been admitted to military hospitals.\r\n\r\n     It would be impossible to carry about a large staff of female\r\n     nurses with the army in the field. But at Scutari, having now a\r\n     fixed hospital, no military reason exists against their\r\n     introduction, and I am confident they might be introduced with\r\n     great benefit, for hospital orderlies must be very rough hands, and\r\n     most of them, on such an occasion as this, very inexperienced ones.\r\n\r\n     I receive numbers of offers from ladies to go out, but they are\r\n     ladies who have no conception of what an hospital is, nor of the\r\n     nature of its duties; and they would, when the time came, either\r\n     recoil from the work or be entirely useless, and consequently--what\r\n     is worse--entirely in the way. Nor would these ladies probably ever\r\n     understand the necessity, especially in a military hospital, of\r\n     strict obedience to rule. Lady M. Forester (Lord Roden's daughter)\r\n     has made some proposal to Dr. Smith, the head of the Army Medical\r\n     Department, either to go with or to send out trained nurses. I\r\n     apprehend she means from Fitzroy Square, John Street, or some such\r\n     establishment. The Rev. Mr. Hume, once chaplain to the General\r\n     Hospital at Birmingham (and better known as author of the scheme\r\n     for transferring the city churches to the suburbs), has offered to\r\n     go out himself as chaplain with two daughters and twelve nurses. He\r\n     was in the army seven years, and has been used to hospitals, and I\r\n     like the tone of his letters very much. I think from both of these\r\n     offers practical effects may be drawn. But the difficulty of\r\n     finding nurses who are at all versed in their business is probably\r\n     not known to Mr. Hume, and Lady M. Forester probably has not\r\n     tested the willingness of the trained nurses to go, and is\r\n     incapable of directing or ruling them.\r\n\r\n     There is but one person in England that I know of who would be\r\n     capable of organizing and superintending such a scheme; and I have\r\n     been several times on the point of asking you hypothetically if,\r\n     supposing the attempt were made, you would undertake to direct it.\r\n\r\n     The selection of the rank and file of nurses will be very\r\n     difficult: no one knows it better than yourself. The difficulty of\r\n     finding women equal to a task, after all, full of horrors, and\r\n     requiring, besides knowledge and goodwill, great energy and great\r\n     courage, will be great. The task of ruling them and introducing\r\n     system among them, great; and not the least will be the difficulty\r\n     of making the whole work smoothly with the medical and military\r\n     authorities out there. This it is which makes it so important that\r\n     the experiment should be carried out by one with a capacity for\r\n     administration and experience. A number of sentimental enthusiastic\r\n     ladies turned loose into the Hospital at Scutari would probably,\r\n     after a few days, be _mises à la porte_ by those whose business\r\n     they would interrupt, and whose authority they would dispute.\r\n\r\n     My question simply is, Would you listen to the request to go and\r\n     superintend the whole thing? You would of course have plenary\r\n     authority over all the nurses, and I think I could secure you the\r\n     fullest assistance and co-operation from the medical staff, and you\r\n     would also have an unlimited power of drawing on the Government for\r\n     whatever you thought requisite for the success of your mission. On\r\n     this part of the subject the details are too many for a letter, and\r\n     I reserve it for our meeting; for whatever decision you take, I\r\n     know you will give me every assistance and advice.\r\n\r\n     I do not say one word to press you. You are the only person who can\r\n     judge for yourself which of conflicting or incompatible duties is\r\n     the first, or the highest; but I must not conceal from you that I\r\n     think upon your decision will depend the ultimate success or\r\n     failure of the plan. Your own personal qualities, your knowledge\r\n     and your power of administration, and among greater things your\r\n     rank and position in Society give you advantages in such a work\r\n     which no other person possesses.\r\n\r\n     If this succeeds, an enormous amount of good will be done now, and\r\n     to persons deserving everything at our hands; and a prejudice will\r\n     have been broken through, and a precedent established, which will\r\n     multiply the good to all time.\r\n\r\n     I hardly like to be sanguine as to your answer. If it were \"yes,\" I\r\n     am certain the Bracebridges would go with you and give you all the\r\n     comfort you would require, and which their society and sympathy\r\n     only could give you. I have written very long, for the subject is\r\n     very near my heart. Liz [Mrs. Herbert] is writing to Mrs.\r\n     Bracebridge to tell her what I am doing. I go back to town\r\n     to-morrow morning. Shall I come to you between 3 and 5? Will you\r\n     let me have a line at the War Office to let me know?\r\n\r\n     There is one point which I have hardly a right to touch upon, but I\r\n     know you will pardon me. If you were inclined to undertake this\r\n     great work, would Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale give their consent? The\r\n     work would be so national, and the request made to you proceeding\r\n     from the Government who represent the nation comes at such a\r\n     moment, that I do not despair of their consent. Deriving your\r\n     authority from the Government, your position would secure the\r\n     respect and consideration of every one, especially in a service\r\n     where official rank carries so much weight. This would secure to\r\n     you every attention and comfort on your way and there, together\r\n     with a complete submission to your orders. I know these things are\r\n     a matter of indifference to you except so far as they may further\r\n     the great objects you have in view; but they are of importance in\r\n     themselves, and of every importance to those who have a right to\r\n     take an interest in your personal position and comfort.\r\n\r\n     I know you will come to a wise decision. God grant it may be in\r\n     accordance with my hopes! Believe me, dear Miss Nightingale, ever\r\n     yours,\r\n                                                      SIDNEY HERBERT.[71]\r\n\r\n  [71] This famous letter--obviously private at the time--was printed _in\r\n       extenso_, for a controversial purpose (see below, p. 245), in the\r\n       _Daily News_ of October 28, 1854. Miss Nightingale was much\r\n       distressed when she heard of the publication, and her family could\r\n       not think how it had \"got into the papers\"; but they had shown it,\r\n       and copies of it, too widely.\r\n\r\nThere was no hitch, such as Sidney Herbert half feared, from reluctance\r\non the part of Miss Nightingale's parents. Her uncle, Mr. Samuel Smith\r\n(husband of her Aunt Mai, of whose helpfulness we have heard), had\r\nalready half obtained their consent to her going as a volunteer. All\r\nhesitation was removed when the news came that she was asked to go by\r\nand for the Government itself:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY LOVE,\" wrote Miss Nightingale's sister to a friend (Oct. 18),\r\n     \"Government has asked, I should say entreated, Flo to go out and\r\n     help in the Hospital at Scutari. I am sure you will feel that it is\r\n     a great and noble work, and that it is a real duty; for there is no\r\n     one, as they tell her, and I believe truly, who has the knowledge\r\n     and the zeal necessary to make such a step succeed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to the same friend a day or two later:--\r\n\r\n     Before, in Harley Street, I did not feel sure that she was right,\r\n     there seemed so much to be done at home; but now there is no doubt\r\n     that she is fitted to do this work, and that no one else is, and\r\n     that it _is_ a work. I must say the way in which all things have\r\n     tended to and fitted her for this is so very remarkable that one\r\n     cannot but believe she was intended for it. None of her previous\r\n     life has been wasted, her experience all tells, all the gathered\r\n     stores of so many years, her Kaiserswerth, her sympathy with the R.\r\n     Catholic system of work, her travels, her search into the hospital\r\n     question, her knowledge of so many different minds and different\r\n     classes, all are serving so curiously--and much more than I have\r\n     time for.\r\n\r\nYes, and perhaps even the difficulties which affectionate solicitude had\r\nplaced in Florence Nightingale's way might have been counted among her\r\npreparations for a task involving great power of will and determination.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale saw Mr. Herbert on Monday, October 16, and the matter\r\nwas arranged between them. Mrs. Sidney Herbert and the other ladies of\r\nthe Harley Street Committee readily released their Superintendent. Her\r\nfaithful friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, agreed to accompany her. Mr.\r\nHerbert had assured Miss Nightingale of their willingness, without any\r\nprevious consultation--a fine instance, surely, of friendly confidence.\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle, who had some slight personal acquaintance with\r\nMiss Nightingale, and the other members of the Cabinet cordially\r\napproved the initiative of their colleague, and three days later Miss\r\nNightingale received her official appointment and instructions:--\r\n\r\n     (_The Secretary-at-War to Miss Nightingale._) WAR OFFICE, _October_\r\n     19 [1854]. MADAM--Having consented at the pressing instance of the\r\n     Government to accept the office of Superintendent of the female\r\n     nursing establishment in the English General Military Hospitals in\r\n     Turkey, you will, on your arrival there, place yourself at once in\r\n     communication with the Chief Army Medical Officer of the Hospital\r\n     at Scutari, under whose orders and direction you will carry on the\r\n     duties of your appointment.\r\n\r\n     Everything relating to the distribution of the nurses, the hours of\r\n     their attendance, their allotment to particular duties, is placed\r\n     in your hands, subject, of course, to the sanction and approval of\r\n     the Chief Medical Officer; but the selection of the nurses in the\r\n     first instance is placed solely under your control, or under that of\r\n     persons to be agreed upon between yourself and the Director-General of\r\n     the Army and Ordnance Medical Department, and the persons so selected\r\n     will receive certificates from the Director-General or the principal\r\n     Medical Officer of one of the General Hospitals, without which\r\n     certificate no one will be permitted to enter the Hospital in order to\r\n     attend the sick.\r\n\r\n     In like manner the power of discharge on account of illness or of\r\n     dismissal for misconduct, inaptitude, or other cause, is vested\r\n     entirely in yourself; but in cases of such discharge or dismissal\r\n     the cost of the return passage of such person home will, if you\r\n     think it advisable and if they proceed at once or so soon as their\r\n     health enables them, be defrayed by the Government.\r\n\r\n     Directions will be given by the mail of this day to engage one or\r\n     two houses in a situation as convenient as can be found for\r\n     attendance at the Hospital, or to provide accommodation in the\r\n     Barracks if thought more advisable. And instructions will be given\r\n     to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to afford you every facility and\r\n     assistance on landing at Constantinople, as also to Dr. Menzies,\r\n     the Chief Medical Officer of the Hospital at Scutari, who will give\r\n     you all the aid in his power and every support in the execution of\r\n     your arduous duties.\r\n\r\n     The cost of the passage both out and home of yourself and the\r\n     nurses who may accompany you, or who may follow you, will be\r\n     defrayed by the Government, as also the cost of house rent,\r\n     subsistence, &c., &c.; and I leave to your discretion the rate of\r\n     pay which you may think it advisable to give to the different\r\n     persons acting under your authority.\r\n\r\n     In the meanwhile Sir John Kirkland, the Army Agent, has received\r\n     orders to honor your drafts to the amount of One Thousand Pounds\r\n     for the necessary expense of outfit, travelling expenses, &c., &c.,\r\n     of which sum you will render an account to the Purveyor of the\r\n     Forces at Scutari.\r\n\r\n     You will, for your current expenses, payment of wages, &c., &c.,\r\n     apply to the Purveyor through the Chief Medical Officer, in charge\r\n     of the Hospital, who will provide you with the necessary funds.\r\n\r\n     I feel confident that, with a view to the fulfilment of the arduous\r\n     task you have undertaken, you will impress upon those acting under\r\n     your orders the necessity of the strictest attention to the\r\n     regulations of the Hospital, and the preservation of that\r\n     subordination which is indispensable in every Military\r\n     Establishment.\r\n\r\n     And I rely on your discretion and vigilance carefully to guard\r\n     against any attempt being made among those under your authority,\r\n     selected as they are with a view to fitness and without any\r\n     reference to religious creed, to make use of their position in the\r\n     Hospitals to tamper with or disturb the religious opinions of the\r\n     patients of any denomination whatever, and at once to check any\r\n     such tendency and to take, if necessary, severe measures to prevent\r\n     its repetition.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to be, Madam, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                                           SIDNEY HERBERT.\r\n\r\nThe instructions promised in this letter were duly sent to the Commander\r\nof the Forces, the Purveyor-in-Chief, and the Principal Medical\r\nOfficer;[72] and the way was smoothed for Miss Nightingale, as they\r\nthought in Downing Street, by supplementary letters to some of the\r\nofficials. A letter was sent to the Purveyor-General (Oct. 19), in which\r\n\"Mr. Sidney Herbert trusts that you will use every endeavour to assist\r\nMiss Nightingale in the performance of the arduous duties she has\r\nvoluntarily undertaken, the success of which must necessarily depend\r\nupon the assistance and co-operation of others, and cannot fail to be of\r\ngreat benefit to those Gallant Men who have suffered in the service of\r\ntheir country.\" Similarly Sir Charles Trevelyan, Assistant-secretary to\r\nthe Treasury, remarking that the commissariat officers are the bankers\r\nand stewards of the army, wrote, as he told Miss Nightingale (Oct. 20),\r\n\"to Commissary-General Filder and Deputy-Commissary-General Smith, the\r\nSenior Officer at Scutari, to request that they will from the first give\r\nyou all the support they are able, and instruct their officers of every\r\ngrade to do the same.\" Any difficulties which might confront her would\r\nnot be caused, it seemed, by lack of support at home.\r\n\r\n  [72] The text of the instructions may be found in the _Journal of the\r\n       Royal Army Medical Corps_, October 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nPrivate support was forthcoming as readily as official. Mr. Henry Reeve,\r\nan old friend of Miss Nightingale and her family, rejoicing that she had\r\nnow \"an opportunity of action worthy of her,\" spoke to the great Delane,\r\nand requested him to direct Mr. Macdonald--who was being sent out to\r\nadminister the _Times_ Fund--to co-operate with Miss Nightingale. Mr.\r\nMacdonald was a man, as Mr. Reeve testified, and as Miss Nightingale was\r\nto discover--to the great advantage of their common cause,--\"of\r\nremarkable intelligence and activity.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days after the receipt of her official instructions, five days after\r\nher interview with Mr. Herbert, Miss Nightingale and her party left\r\nLondon (Oct. 21). The amount of work which fell upon Miss Nightingale\r\nduring the ten days (Oct. 12-21) was enormous, and some of the details\r\nshe was obliged to delegate to others. The headquarters of the\r\nexpedition during its outfit were established at Mr. Sidney Herbert's\r\nhouse in Belgrave Square, and there Miss Mary Stanley and Mrs.\r\nBracebridge interviewed applicants. Miss Nightingale, foreseeing (only\r\ntoo truly, as the event was to show) the difficulty both of finding\r\nsuitable women and of supervising them, was inclined to limit the number\r\nto twenty. Mr. Herbert, thinking that such a new departure should be\r\nmade on a considerable scale, proposed a larger number, and Miss\r\nNightingale gave way. Forty was the number agreed upon; but the material\r\nwhich offered itself was not promising. \"Here we sit all day,\" wrote\r\nMiss Stanley; \"I wish people who may hereafter complain of the women\r\nselected could have seen the set we had to choose from. All London was\r\nscoured for them. We sent emissaries in every direction to every likely\r\nplace.... We felt ashamed to have in the house such women as came. One\r\nalone expressed a wish to go from a good motive. Money was the only\r\ninducement.\"[73] Ultimately thirty-eight nurses were obtained.\r\n\r\n  [73] _Stanmore_, vol. i. p. 342.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert, in the concluding passage of his Instructions, relied on\r\nMiss Nightingale's vigilance to prevent religious \"tampering.\" This was\r\nan instruction which she had discussed with him, for she foresaw (again\r\nonly too well) the _odium theologicum_ that might confront her. She was\r\nprimarily concerned to get the best nurses as such, but she was anxious\r\nalso that the different churches or shades should be represented. In\r\nthis desire she was in large measure disappointed. Application was made\r\nboth to St. John's House, an institution inclined towards Tractarianism,\r\nand to the Protestant Institution for Nurses in Devonshire Square. In\r\neach case the answer was returned that nurses could only be supplied if\r\nthey were to be subject to their own Committees; the Government's\r\ncondition of subjection to Miss Nightingale's control was rejected. The\r\nauthorities of St. John's House proposed that their nurses should be\r\naccompanied by the Master of the House, to act as \"their guardian.\" It\r\nwill readily be imagined how impossible Miss Nightingale's position\r\nwould have been on such terms. The proposal shows incidentally how\r\nlittle some people understood of the conditions of discipline necessary\r\nin a military hospital. Mr. Sidney Herbert, the Chaplain-General of the\r\nForces, and Miss Nightingale met the Council of St. John's House; the\r\npoint of Miss Nightingale's exclusive control was conceded, and the\r\nMaster stayed at home. The Lady Superior of St. John's House at this\r\ntime was Miss Mary Jones, who to the end of her life remained one of the\r\nmost valued and tenderly devoted of Miss Nightingale's friends.[74] The\r\nauthorities in Devonshire Square, on the other hand, would not surrender\r\nthe point of separate control, and accordingly no nurses were supplied\r\nby the distinctively Protestant institution. \"We are only vexed,\" wrote\r\nLady Verney, \"because Flo so earnestly desired to include all shades of\r\nopinion, to prove that all, however they differed, might work together\r\nin a common brotherhood of love to God and man.\"\r\n\r\n  [74] Miss Jones resigned her appointment at St. John's House in 1868,\r\n       owing to differences of opinion with the Council, and set up a\r\n       private nursing establishment. She died in 1887.\r\n\r\nThe party, as ultimately recruited, was composed of ten Roman Catholic\r\nSisters (five from Bermondsey and five from Norwood), eight Anglican\r\nSisters (from Miss Sellon's Home at Devonport), six nurses from St.\r\nJohn's House, and fourteen from various English hospitals. It has often\r\nbeen supposed that the nurses who accompanied Miss Nightingale were\r\nladies of gentle birth, but, with a few exceptions, this was not the\r\ncase. On the eve of their departure, the nurses were addressed by Mr.\r\nHerbert in his dining-room. He told them that if any desired to turn\r\nback, now was the time of decision, and he impressed upon them that all\r\nwho went were bound implicitly to obey Miss Nightingale in all things.\r\n\"All started on their ways,\" we are told,[75] \"strengthened by his\r\nheart-stirring words, and cheered no less by the sunny brightness of his\r\npresence than by his kindly and unfailing sympathy.\" Unhappily the\r\neffect was not in all cases permanent, as we shall hear.\r\n\r\n  [75] _Stanmore_, vol. i. p. 342.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\n\"Do not answer this,\" wrote a Minister to Miss Nightingale; \"for I am\r\nsure you must have more on your hands now than a Secretary of State.\"\r\nBut what struck those about her was her perfect calm. \"No one is so well\r\nfitted as she to do such work,\" wrote Lady Canning to Lady Stuart de\r\nRothesay (Oct. 17); \"she has such nerve and skill, and is so wise and\r\nquiet. Even now she is in no bustle and hurry, though so much is on her\r\nhands, and such numbers of people volunteer services.\" She had only one\r\nworry. Her pet owl had died. When her family were leaving Embley to see\r\nher off, the feeding of the owl was forgotten in the hurry and flurry.\r\nIt was embalmed, and \"the only tear its mistress shed through that\r\ntremendous week,\" says her sister, \"was when I put the little body into\r\nher hands. 'Poor little beastie, it was odd how much I loved you.'\"[76]\r\nFor the rest, she was \"as calm and composed in this furious haste,\"\r\nwrote her sister (Oct. 19), \"with the War Office, the Military Medical\r\nBoard, half the nurses in London to speak to, her own Committee and\r\nInstitution, as if she were going out for a walk.\" She was quiet\r\nbecause, like Wordsworth's Happy Warrior, in the heat of excitement, she\r\n\"kept the law in calmness made, and saw what she foresaw.\" Like the\r\ncharacter drawn by another master-hand, \"in the tumult she was\r\ntranquil,\" because she had pondered when at rest.\r\n\r\n  [76] From the _Life and Death of Athena, an Owlet from the Parthenon_, a\r\n       manuscript book charmingly written and illustrated by Lady Verney.\r\n       She wrote it in 1855, and sent it to Scutari \"to try and make Flo\r\n       and Mrs. Bracebridge laugh when F. was recovering from her fever.\"\r\n\r\nA small black pocket-book is preserved in which were found, at Miss\r\nNightingale's death, a few of the many letters received just before she\r\nleft England for the East. Perhaps they were the very last letters\r\nreceived; perhaps they were there for other reasons. One spoke of a\r\nmother's love:--\r\n\r\n     Monday morning. God speed you on your errand of mercy, my own\r\n     dearest child. I know He will, for He has given you such loving\r\n     friends, and they will be always at your side to help in all your\r\n     difficulties. They came just when I felt that you must fail for\r\n     want of strength, and more mercies will come in your hour of need.\r\n     They are so wise and good, they will be to you what no one else\r\n     could. They will write to us, and save you in that and in all ways.\r\n     They are to us an earnest of blessings to come. I do not ask you to\r\n     spare yourself for your own sake, but for the sake of the\r\n     cause.--Ever Thine.\r\n\r\nAnother letter reminded her of the love of God:--\r\n\r\n     God will keep you. And my prayer for you will be that your one\r\n     object of Worship, Pattern of Imitation, and Source of consolation\r\n     and strength may be the Sacred Heart of our Divine Lord. Always\r\n     yours for our Lord's sake,\r\n                                                     HENRY E. MANNING.\r\n\r\nAnd a third among them was from the friend whose life she had declined\r\nto share, but whose sympathy was still precious to her:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR FRIEND,\" he wrote (Oct. 18), \"I hear you are going to the\r\n     East. I am happy it is so, for the good you will do there, and the\r\n     hope that you may find some satisfaction in it yourself. I cannot\r\n     forget how you went to the East once before, and here am I writing\r\n     quietly to you about what you are going to do now. You can\r\n     undertake _that_, when you could not undertake me. God bless you,\r\n     dear Friend, wherever you go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                      THE EXPEDITION--PROBLEMS AHEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n     On the ocean no post brings us letters which we are compelled to\r\n     answer. No newspaper tempts us into reading the last night's debate\r\n     in Parliament. The absence of distracting incidents, the sameness\r\n     of the scene, and the uniformity of life on board ship, leave us\r\n     leisure for reflection; we are thrown in upon our own thoughts, and\r\n     can make up our accounts with our consciences.--FROUDE.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale and her party left London on Saturday, October 21.\r\nAmong those who saw them off was her cousin, Arthur Hugh Clough. The\r\nprincipal halts were made in Paris and Marseilles. At Paris, Miss\r\nNightingale had hoped to recruit some Sisters for nursing service. She\r\nwent to the headquarters of the Order of St. Vincent de Paul, furnished\r\nwith letters from the British Government and the French military\r\nauthorities, and accompanied by the British Ambassador's private\r\nsecretary in order to strengthen her application; but it was\r\nrefused.[77] At Marseilles, with what turned out to be admirable\r\nforethought, she laid in a large store of miscellaneous provisions. Her\r\nuncle, Mr. Sam Smith, accompanied the party to Marseilles, and from his\r\nletters we obtain vivid glimpses of the expedition _en route_:--\r\n\r\n     \"Kindly received everywhere,\" he wrote (Oct. 26), \"by French and\r\n     English. Still it was very hard work for Flo to keep 40 in good\r\n     humour; arranging the rooms of 5 different sects each night, before\r\n     sitting down to supper, took a long time; then calling all to be\r\n     down at 6 ready to start. She bears all wonderfully--so calm,\r\n     winning everybody, French and English.\"\r\n\r\n  [77] Letter to Captain Galton, May 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nA correspondent wrote to the _Times_ from Boulogne, describing how the\r\narrival of the party there caused so much enthusiasm, that the sturdy\r\nfisherwomen seized their bags and carried them to the hotel, refusing to\r\naccept the slightest gratuity; how the landlord of the hotel gave them\r\ndinner, and told them to order what they liked, adding that they would\r\nnot be allowed to pay for anything; and how waiters and chambermaids\r\nwere equally firm in refusing any acknowledgment for their attentions.\r\nLady Verney, in a letter to a friend, acutely noted a yet more\r\nremarkable thing, \"the railroad would not be paid for her boxes.\"\r\n\r\nAt Marseilles the expedition excited lively interest, and its Chief was\r\noverwhelmed with attentions:--\r\n\r\n     \"Where she was seen or heard,\" wrote the proud uncle, \"there was\r\n     nothing but admiration from high and low. Her calm dignity\r\n     influenced everybody. I am sure the nurses quite love her already.\r\n     Some cried when she exhorted them at the last, and all promised\r\n     well. Blessings on her! She makes everybody who joins with her feel\r\n     the good and like it (instead of disposing them against it, as some\r\n     well-meaning oppositious spirits do).\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in another letter:--\r\n\r\n     Words cannot tell Mrs. Bracebridge's devotion to Flo, nor Flo's to\r\n     the cause. Neither sat down but for a hurried meal. Shopkeepers,\r\n     visitors, nurses, servants, every single instant. Flo never crossed\r\n     the threshold. There she was, receiving in her little bedroom (not\r\n     at bedtime) the Inspector-General, the Consul and Agent, a Queen's\r\n     Messenger, _Times_ Correspondent, and two or three shopkeepers with\r\n     the same serenity as if in a drawing-room quite _dés[oe]uvrée_. Her\r\n     influence on all (to captain and steward of boat) was wonderful.\r\n     The rough hospital nurses, on the third day after breakfasting and\r\n     dining with us each day, and receiving all her attentions, were\r\n     quite humanized and civilized, their very manners at table\r\n     softened. \"We never had so much care taken of our comforts before;\r\n     it is not people's way with _us_; we had no notion Miss N. would\r\n     slave herself so for us.\" She looked so calm and noble in it all,\r\n     whether waiting on the nurses at dinner in the station (because no\r\n     one else would), or carrying parcels, or receiving functionaries.\r\n     The Bracebridges are fuller than ever of admiration of her, as I\r\n     am. She looked better and handsomer than even the day she sailed. I\r\n     went back with the literary public of Marseilles, all full of\r\n     admiration. It was very doleful sitting in Flo's deserted room.\r\n\r\nShe sailed from Marseilles on board the _Vectis_ on Friday, October 27,\r\nloudly cheered from an English vessel in the harbour, carrying with her,\r\nas a friend had written, \"the deep prayers and gratitude of the English\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when public announcement of her mission was made, she\r\nhad, indeed, become a popular heroine. Though well known in Society, she\r\nhad been as yet a stranger to public fame; so much so that the _Times_\r\nitself, in printing the announcement (Oct. 19), said: \"We are authorised\r\nto state that Mrs. Nightingale,\" etc. Delane cannot have kept his eye on\r\nthe news-columns, for not until some days had elapsed was it discovered\r\nto the public that \"Mrs.\" Nightingale was in fact \"Miss.\" \"Who is 'Mrs.'\r\nNightingale?\" was a heading in the _Examiner_ (Oct. 28), and the\r\nquestion was answered in a biographical article. Some passages of it\r\ndeserve record here, for it went the round of the press throughout the\r\nworld, and was the source from which, from that day to this, the popular\r\nidea of Florence Nightingale has been derived. The article stated\r\nsuccinctly, and with substantial accuracy, the course of her life; dwelt\r\nupon the facts that she was \"young, graceful, feminine, rich, and\r\npopular\"; enlarged, with less accuracy, upon her delight in the\r\n\"palpable and heart-felt attractions\" of her home; described her\r\nforsaking the \"assemblies, lectures, concerts, exhibitions, and all the\r\nentertainments for taste and intellect with which London in its season\r\nabounds,\" in order to sit beside the sick and dying; and concluded thus:\r\nShe had set out for the scene of war\r\n\r\n     ... at the risk of her own life, at the pang of separation from all\r\n     her friends and family, and at the certainty of encountering\r\n     hardship, dangers, toils, and the constantly renewing scene of\r\n     human suffering, amid all the worst horrors of war. There are few\r\n     who would not recoil from such realities, but Miss Nightingale\r\n     shrank not, and at once accepted the request that was made her to\r\n     form and control the entire nursing establishment for all sick and\r\n     wounded soldiers and sailors in the Levant. While we write, this\r\n     deliberate, sensitive, and highly-endowed young lady is already at\r\n     her post, rendering the holiest of women's charities to the sick,\r\n     the dying, and the convalescent. There is a heroism in dashing up\r\n     the heights of Alma in defiance of death and all mortal opposition,\r\n     and let all praise and honour be, as they are, bestowed upon it;\r\n     but there is a quiet forecasting heroism and largeness of heart in\r\n     this lady's resolute accumulation of the powers of consolation, and\r\n     her devoted application of them, which rank as high and are at\r\n     least as pure. A sage few will no doubt condemn, sneer at, or pity\r\n     an enthusiasm which to them seems eccentric, or at best misplaced;\r\n     but to the true heart of the country it will speak home, and be\r\n     there felt that there is not one of England's proudest and purest\r\n     daughters who at this moment stands on so high a pinnacle as\r\n     Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nThe discovery by the public that the head of the Nursing Expedition was\r\nnot \"Mrs.\" Nightingale, a matron, but a young lady, \"graceful, rich, and\r\npopular,\" added to the enthusiasm which her devotion called forth. Her\r\nservices were rendered gratuitously; her necessary expenses were to be\r\ndefrayed by the Government, and officialdom opined that no voluntary\r\ncontributions, either in money or in kind, were needed. Happily for the\r\ncomfort of our soldiers in the East, private individuals took a\r\ndifferent view, and--in addition to the _Times_ Fund--donations were\r\nsent to Miss Nightingale personally, both by her friends and by the\r\ngeneral public. An account rendered after her return[78] from the East\r\nshows that from the general public she received nearly £7000 in money.\r\nThis fund, added to the help which she obtained from the _Times_, and\r\nsupplemented by expenditure out of her private purse, enabled Miss\r\nNightingale greatly to extend the scope of her work. The statement that\r\nshe was rich requires some qualification. Her father was rich, but the\r\npersonal allowance which he had made to her, when she declared her\r\nindependence in 1853, was £500 a year, and it remained at this figure\r\nfor several years. During her mission to the East she devoted the whole\r\nof it to her work.\r\n\r\n  [78] The _Statement_ (see Bibliography A, No. 5).\r\n\r\nGifts in kind and offers of personal service also poured in. Now that\r\nMiss Nightingale was at sea, the task of dealing with such matters was\r\nundertaken by her sister and a friend. The Nightingale family had taken\r\na house for the time in Cavendish Square (No. 4), which became the\r\nheadquarters of a charitable bureau.\r\n\r\n     \"I am well nigh writ out,\" wrote Lady Verney to Madame Mohl (Nov.\r\n     6), \"170 letters to answer in the last fortnight, and very\r\n     difficult ones, some of them. I should like you to hear a batch of\r\n     the offers of all kinds we receive, some so pretty, some so queer.\r\n     Old linen is abating, I am happy to say; even knitted socks are\r\n     slacker; but nurses, rabble and respectable, ladies, and _very\r\n     much_ the reverse, continue to rain. It is tremendous; however,\r\n     having reached No. 276, we are going to shut the door. Mary Stanley\r\n     and I sit daily at the receipt of custom, and funny things do we\r\n     see and hear! Human nature is a wondrous work, whether of God\r\n     Almighty I sometimes begin to doubt.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting, in view of an unfortunate dispute that presently\r\narose, that both Lady Verney and Miss Stanley distinctly understood that\r\nadditional nurses would only be sent \"if Flo asks.\" All applicants were\r\nso informed; but so keen was the desire to serve, that \"many ladies,\" so\r\nLady Verney wrote, \"are undergoing hospital training on chance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, meanwhile, was at sea on her way to Constantinople,\r\nrevolving many things in her mind. She had been called to a mission upon\r\nwhich issues very near to her heart depended. If it succeeded, then, as\r\nMr. Herbert had written to her, not only would an enormous amount of\r\ngood be done now to the sick and wounded, but \"a prejudice would have\r\nbeen broken through, and a precedent established, which would multiply\r\nthe good to all time.\" And so, as we all know, it was destined to be.\r\nBut at the time the fate of the experiment was doubtful. It was Mr.\r\nHerbert's conviction that no one except Florence Nightingale could make\r\nit succeed, but it was by no means certain that even she could do so.\r\nShe took in her hands the reputation of the Minister who trusted her,\r\nand her own; and not her reputation only, but the hopes, the\r\naspirations, the ambitions which had ruled her life.\r\n\r\nShe determined to succeed, and she counted the difficulties which would\r\nconfront her. Writing two years later and giving account of her\r\nstewardship, she paid her tribute of thanks to those \"among the\r\nofficials, medical as well as military, to whose benevolence, ability,\r\nand unselfish devotion to duty she was indebted for facilities, without\r\nwhich, in a position such as hers, new to the service, and exposed to\r\nmuch criticism and difficulty, she would have been utterly unable to\r\nperform the work entrusted to her.\"[79] She saw from the start that she\r\nwould be exposed, in the very nature of the case, to some medical\r\njealousy and much military prejudice.\r\n\r\n  [79] _Statement_, pp. 3-4.\r\n\r\nThe idea of employing female nurses at Scutari had been mooted before\r\nthe army left for the East, but was abandoned, as the Duke of Newcastle\r\nexplained, because \"it was not liked by the military authorities.\"[80]\r\nOf the military prejudice against the intrusion of women, even for the\r\ngentle office of nursing, into the rough work of war, some entertaining\r\nillustrations are happily on record. Lieutenant-Colonel Sterling,\r\nafterwards Sir Anthony Sterling, K.C.B., was on active service during\r\nthe Crimean campaign, first as brigade-major, and afterwards as\r\nassistant adjutant-general to the Highland division. He was an elder\r\nbrother of Carlyle's John Sterling, and himself possessed of some\r\nliterary skill. \"A solid, substantial man,\" Carlyle calls him; he was\r\nalso a man who loved to stand by the ancient ways. He wrote a series of\r\nlively letters during the campaign, and in his will directed that they\r\nshould be published. Nowhere, so clearly as in Sterling's _Highland\r\nBrigade in the Crimea_, have I found contemporary evidence of the\r\nprejudices against which the experiment of Mr. Herbert and Miss\r\nNightingale had to contend. During Miss Nightingale's visit to Balaclava\r\nin 1855, some dispute arose among the nurses. \"Miss---- has added\r\nherself,\" wrote Colonel Sterling, \"to the hospital of the 42nd; and will\r\nnot acknowledge the voice of the Nightingale, who has written an\r\nofficial letter to Lord Raglan on the subject. I suppose he will order a\r\ncourt-martial composed of nurses, who will administer queer justice.\"\r\nOur Colonel is something of a wag. He cannot help laughing at \"the\r\nNightingale,\" because, as he explains, he has such \"a keen sense of the\r\nridiculous.\" He is so pleased with his quip about the female\r\ncourt-martial that he returns to it in another letter. He is tickled,\r\ntoo, by a saying of the mess-room, that \"Miss Nightingale has shaved her\r\nhead to keep out vermin.\" One can almost hear the honest Colonel's\r\nguffaw as he wonders whether \"she will wear a wig or a helmet?\" Women,\r\nhe supposes, imagine that \"war can be made without wounds\"; they will be\r\nteaching us how to fight next; and as for their ideas of nursing, why\r\nsome of the ladies actually took to \"scrubbing floors\"! It amused him,\r\nbut angered him no less. He has to admit that he believes \"the\r\nNightingale\" has been of some use; but he bitterly resents her \"capture\"\r\nof orderlies for mere purposes of nursing, and when he is asked, \"When\r\nwill she go home?\" answers with Christopher Sly, \"Would it were done.\"\r\n\"However,\" he writes, \"---- (presumably Sidney Herbert) is gone; and I\r\nhope there is not to be found another Minister who will allow these\r\nabsurdities.\" Miss Nightingale read Sir Anthony's book when it came out\r\nin 1895, and made some severe _marginalia_ upon it; remarking upon his\r\n\"absolute ignorance of sanitary things,\" noting the \"misprints as a fair\r\nindex to the whole,\" and finally dismissing the book as \"one long string\r\nof Seniority complaints.\" But I protest that she need not have been so\r\nangry. And, indeed, perhaps she was not so angry as she seemed, for her\r\ncaustic pen was not always a true index of her mind. For my part I take\r\nmy hat off to Sir Anthony Absolute. His honest, old-fashioned outbursts\r\nlet in a flood of light upon one side of the difficulties which were to\r\nconfront Miss Nightingale upon landing at Scutari.\r\n\r\n  [80] _Roebuck Committee, Q_. 14625.\r\n\r\nShe pondered much also upon the possibilities of friction with the\r\nmedical officers; and here, too, our Colonel has some light to give us.\r\n\"The Chief Medical Officer out here,\" he wrote, \"ought to have been\r\nintrusted with Nightingale powers.\" The Service in all its branches\r\nstuck together, it will be seen, and no blame to it for that! But if a\r\nfighting colonel smarted under what he deemed a slight upon an army\r\nmedical officer, how much more might the Medical Service itself be\r\nexpected to resent any encroachment upon its appointed province! How\r\nkeenly it did resent such encroachment may be gathered from the _Life\r\nand Letters of Sir John Hall, M.D._, by Mr. Mitra, whose book supplies\r\nus with the same kind of illustration in regard to the army doctors that\r\nwe may gather from Colonel Sterling's in regard to the soldiers. Sir\r\nJohn, like Sir Anthony, thought the whole thing \"very droll.\" He was\r\nstationed in the Crimea, and we shall hear something of the strained\r\nrelations between him and Miss Nightingale, when we follow her thither.\r\nBut at Scutari also, there were some few medical officers who retained\r\neven to the last a ridiculous jealousy of any \"meddling\" by Miss\r\nNightingale and her staff.[81] She foresaw this danger, and made up her\r\nmind to avert it by every means in her power.\r\n\r\n  [81] _Pincoffs_, p. 79.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a third danger which she foresaw also. Not only had she to\r\novercome military prejudice and to avert medical jealousy, but she had\r\nalso to prevent religious disputation. This last task was beyond her\r\npowers, as it has ever proved beyond those of men, women, and angels;\r\nfor by this cause even the angels fell. No work, however beneficent, has\r\never yet been found beyond the capacity of the _odium theologicum_ to\r\nmar and embitter. Miss Nightingale's mission did not escape the common\r\nlot, as we shall hear; but she was keenly sensible of the danger.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale pondered over all these things as the ship sped on its\r\nway to the Golden Horn; and the more she pondered, the more she was\r\ndriven to decide upon a course of action, very different from what many\r\npeople supposed that she would adopt, but entirely consonant with the\r\nbent of her own mind. She saw quite clearly that, if she was to avoid\r\nthe rocks ahead of her, what was needed was not so much genial,\r\nimpulsive kindness, reckless of rules and defiant of constituted\r\nauthority, but rather strict method, stern discipline, and rigid\r\nsubordination. The criticisms to which she exposed herself in the\r\nsuperintendence of her nurses were based, not upon laxity, but upon her\r\nalleged severity.[82] As for her own conduct, she supposed that her\r\nwork, when she landed, would be that of the matron of a hospital. If, as\r\nit turned out, she became rather (as she put it) mistress of a barrack,\r\nit was because she found herself in the midst of conditions which the\r\nconstituted authorities at home had not foreseen, and before which those\r\non the spot stood powerless. Miss Nightingale was happily possessed of\r\nan original mind and a resolute will. She saw evils which cried out for\r\nremedies; and new occasions taught new duties.\r\n\r\n  [82] See on this point the references given below, p. 210 _n._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                         THE HOSPITALS AT SCUTARI\r\n\r\n\r\n     Dearth of creative brain-power showed itself in our Levantine\r\n     hospitals, for there industrious functionaries worked hard at their\r\n     accustomed tasks, and doggedly omitted to innovate at times when\r\n     not to be innovating was surrendering, as it were, at discretion to\r\n     want and misery. But happily, after a while, and in gentle, almost\r\n     humble, disguise, which put foes of change off their guard, there\r\n     acceded to the state a new power.--KINGLAKE.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale reported the arrival of her expedition at\r\nConstantinople in a short note to her parents:--\r\n\r\n     CONSTANTINOPLE, _November_ 4, on board _Vectis_.--DEAREST PEOPLE--\r\n     Anchored off the Seraglio point, waiting for our fate whether we can\r\n     disembark direct into the Hospital, which, with our heterogeneous\r\n     mass, we should prefer.\r\n\r\n     At six o'clock yesterday morn I staggered on deck to look at the\r\n     plains of Troy, the tomb of Achilles, the mouths of the Scamander,\r\n     the little harbour of Tenedos, between which and the mainshore our\r\n     _Vectis_, with steward's cabins and galley torn away, blustering,\r\n     creaking, shrieking, storming, rushed on her way. It was in a dense\r\n     mist that the ghosts of the Trojans answered my cordial hail,\r\n     through which the old Gods, nevertheless, peered down from the hill\r\n     of Ida upon their old plain. My enthusiasm for the heroes though\r\n     was undiminished by wind and wave.\r\n\r\n     We made the castles of Europe and Asia (Dardanelles) by eleven, but\r\n     also reached Constantinople this morn in a thick and heavy rain,\r\n     through which the Sophia, Sulieman, the Seven Towers, the walls,\r\n     and the Golden Horn looked like a bad daguerrotype washed out.\r\n\r\n     We have not yet heard what the Embassy or Military Hospital have\r\n     done for us, nor received our orders.\r\n\r\n     Bad news from Balaclava. You will hear the awful wreck of our poor\r\n     cavalry, 400 wounded, arriving _at this moment_ for us to nurse. We\r\n     have just built another hospital at the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n     You will want to know about our crew. One has turned out ill,\r\n     others will do.\r\n\r\n     (_Later_) Just starting for Scutari. We are to be housed in the\r\n     Hospital this very afternoon. Everybody is most kind. The fresh\r\n     wounded are, I believe, to be placed under our care. They are\r\n     landing them now.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital, to which Miss Nightingale refers, was to be the chief\r\nscene of her labours for the next six months, and a few particulars\r\nabout it and other hospitals, in which the nursing was under her\r\nsuperintendence, must be given in order to make future proceedings\r\nintelligible. The principal hospitals of the British army during the\r\nCrimean War--four in number--were at Scutari (or in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood), the suburb of mournful beauty which looks across to\r\nConstantinople from the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe first hospital to be established was in the Turkish Military\r\nHospital. This was made over to the British in May 1854, and was called\r\nby them _The General Hospital_. Having been originally designed for a\r\nhospital, and being given up to the English partially fitted, it was,\r\nwrote Miss Nightingale, \"reduced to good order early, by the unwearied\r\nefforts of the first-class Staff Surgeon in introducing a good working\r\nsystem. It was then maintained in excellent condition till the close of\r\nthe war.\"[83] It had accommodation for 1000 patients, but the Battle of\r\nthe Alma showed that much larger accommodation would be wanted.\r\n\r\n  [83] _Statement_, p. 13 _n._\r\n\r\nNorth of the General Hospital, and near to the famous Turkish cemetery\r\nof Scutari, are the Selimiyeh Barracks--a great yellow building with\r\nsquare towers at each angle. This building was made over to the British\r\nfor use as a hospital after the Battle of the Alma, and by them was\r\nalways called _The Barrack Hospital_. This is the hospital in which Miss\r\nNightingale and her band of female nurses were first established, and in\r\nwhich she herself had her headquarters throughout her stay at Scutari.\r\nIt is built on rising ground, in a beautiful situation, looking over the\r\nSea of Marmora on one side, towards the Princes' Islands on another,\r\nand towards Constantinople and up the Bosphorus on a third. \"I have not\r\nbeen out of the Hospital Walls yet,\" wrote Miss Nightingale ten days\r\nafter her arrival, \"but the most beautiful view in all the world, I\r\nbelieve, lies outside.\" Her quarters were in the north-west tower, on\r\nthe left of the Main Guard (or principal entrance). There was a large\r\nkitchen or storeroom, of which we shall hear more presently, and out of\r\nit on either side various other rooms opened. Mr. Bracebridge and the\r\ncourier slept in one small room; Miss Nightingale and Mrs. Bracebridge\r\nin another. The nurses slept in other rooms. The whole space occupied by\r\nMiss Nightingale and her nurses was about equal to that allotted to\r\nthree medical officers and their servants, or to that occupied by the\r\nCommandant. \"This was done,\" she explained, \"in order to make no\r\npressure for room on an already overcrowded hospital. It could not have\r\nbeen done with justice to the women's health, had not Miss Nightingale\r\nlater taken a house in Scutari at private expense, to which every nurse\r\nattacked with fever was removed.\"[84] The quarters were as uncomfortable\r\nas they were cramped. \"Occasionally,\" wrote Miss Nightingale, \"our roof\r\nis torn off, or the windows are blown in, and we are under water for the\r\nnight.\" The Hospital was infested also with rodents and vermin; and,\r\namong other new accomplishments acquired under the stress of new\r\noccasions, Miss Nightingale became an expert rat-killer. This skill was\r\nafterwards called into use at Balaclava. In the spring of 1856, one of\r\nthe nuns whom she had taken with her to the Crimea--Sister Mary\r\nMartha--had a dangerous attack of fever. Miss Nightingale nursed the\r\ncase; and one night, while watching by the sick-bed, she saw a large rat\r\nupon the rafters over the Sister's head; she succeeded in knocking it\r\ndown and killing it, without disturbing the patient.[85] The condition\r\nof physical discomfort in which, surrounded by terrible scenes of\r\nsuffering, she had to do her work, should be remembered in taking the\r\nmeasure of her fortitude and devotion.[86]\r\n\r\n  [84] _Notes_ (Bibliography A, No. 8), sec. iii. p. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n  [85] _Grant_, p. 174.\r\n\r\n  [86] For a lively description of like discomforts endured by her staff,\r\n       see _Eastern Hospitals_, vol. i. pp. 91-94.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of patients accommodated at any one time (Dec. 23,\r\n1854) in the Barrack Hospital was 2434. It was half-an-hour's walk from\r\nthe General Hospital, and an invalided soldier records that he used to\r\naccompany Miss Nightingale from one hospital to another in order to\r\nlight her home on wet stormy nights, across the barren common which lay\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nFarther south of the General Hospital, in the quarter of Haidar Pasha,\r\nwas what was known as _The Palace Hospital_, consisting of various\r\nbuildings belonging to the Sultan's Summer Palace. These were occupied\r\nas a hospital in January 1855. Miss Nightingale had no responsibility\r\nhere; but in the summer of 1855, the female nursing of sick officers,\r\nquartered in one of these buildings, was placed under the\r\nsuperintendence of Mrs. Willoughby Moore, the widow of an officer who\r\nhad died a noble death in the war, and four female nurses, sent out\r\nspecially from England.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were hospitals at _Koulali_, four or five miles farther\r\nnorth, upon the same Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. These hospitals\r\nwere opened in December 1854. The nursing in them was originally under\r\nMiss Nightingale's supervision, but she was presently relieved of it (p.\r\n193 _n._). The hospitals were broken up in November 1855, when, of the\r\nfemale nursing establishment, a portion went home, and the rest passed\r\nunder Miss Nightingale into the hospitals at Scutari.\r\n\r\nThere were also five hospitals in the Crimea, but particulars of these\r\nmay be deferred till the time comes for following Miss Nightingale upon\r\nher expeditions to the front. For the nursing in the Civil Military\r\nHospitals (_i.e._ hospitals controlled by a civilian medical staff) at\r\nRenkioi (on the Dardanelles) and at Smyrna, and for the Naval Hospital\r\nat Therapia, Miss Nightingale had no responsibility, though there is\r\nvoluminous correspondence among her papers showing that she was\r\nconstantly consulted upon the site and arrangements of these hospitals.\r\nThe medical superintendent of the hospital at Renkioi was Dr. E. A.\r\nParkes, with whom Miss Nightingale formed a friendship which endured to\r\nthe end of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe state of the hospitals when Miss Nightingale arrived requires some\r\ndescription, which, however, need not be long. The treatment of the sick\r\nand wounded during the Crimean War was the subject of Departmental\r\nInquiries, Select Committees, and Royal Commissions, which, when they\r\nhad finished sitting upon the hospitals, began sitting upon each other.\r\nEnormous piles of Blue-books were accumulated, and in the course of my\r\nwork I have disturbed much dust upon them. The conduct of every\r\ndepartment and every individual concerned was the subject of charge,\r\nanswer, and countercharge innumerable. Each generation deserves, no\r\ndoubt, the records of mal-administration which it gets; but one\r\ngeneration need not be punished by having to examine in detail the\r\nrecords of another. Some of the details of the Crimean muddle will\r\nindeed necessarily be disinterred in the course of our story; but all\r\nthat need here be collected from the heaps aforesaid are three general\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember, in the first place, that, apart from\r\ncontroverted particulars, it was made abundantly manifest that there was\r\ngross neglect in the service of the sick and wounded. The conflict of\r\ntestimony is readily intelligible. It was easy to give an account based\r\nupon the facts of one hospital or of one time which was not applicable\r\nto another. At Scutari, for instance, the General Hospital was from the\r\nfirst better ordered than the Barrack Hospital. Then, again, different\r\nwitnesses had different standards of what was \"good\" in War Hospitals;\r\nto some, anything was good if it was no worse than the standard of the\r\nPeninsular War. Of Sir George Brown, who commanded the Light Division in\r\nthe Crimea, it was said: \"As he was thrown into a cart on some straw\r\nwhen shot through the legs in Spain, he thinks the same conveyances\r\nadmirable now, and hates ambulances as the invention of the Evil\r\nOne.\"[87] Miss Nightingale had much indignant sarcasm for those who\r\nseemed content that the soldier in hospital should be placed in the\r\ncondition of \"former wars,\" instead of perceiving that he \"should be\r\ntreated with that degree of decency and humanity which the improved\r\nfeeling of the nineteenth century demands.\" But the principal reason for\r\nthe conflict of testimony was that the very facts of protest and inquiry\r\nput all the officials concerned upon the defensive. Any suggestion of\r\ndefault or defect was resented as a personal imputation. There is a\r\ncurious illustration in the letter which the Head of the Army Medical\r\nDepartment wrote to his Principal Medical Officer in view of the Roebuck\r\nCommittee. \"I beg you to supply me, and that immediately\"--with what?\r\nwith the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? No--\"with\r\nevery kind of information which you may deem likely to enable me to\r\nestablish a character for it [the Department], which the public appear\r\ndesirous to prove that it does not possess.\"[88] But though there was\r\nmuch conflict of evidence, the final verdict was decisive. What Greville\r\nwrote in his Journal--\"the accounts published in the _Times_ turn out to\r\nbe true\"--was established by official inquiry and admitted by Ministers.\r\nIn consequence of the indictment in the _Times_, a Commission of Inquiry\r\nwas dispatched to the East by the Secretary of State. The Commission\r\narrived at Constantinople simultaneously with Miss Nightingale, and four\r\nmonths later it reported to the Duke of Newcastle.[89] I need not\r\ntrouble the reader here with many particulars of its Report; for they\r\nwere adopted and confirmed by a Select Committee of the House of Commons\r\na few months later (the famous \"Roebuck Committee\"), which pronounced\r\nsuccinct sentence that \"the state of the hospitals was disgraceful.\" The\r\nships which brought the sick and wounded from the Crimea were painfully\r\nill-equipped. The voyage from Balaclava to Scutari usually took eight\r\ndays and a half. During the first four months of the war, there died on\r\na voyage, no longer than from Tynemouth to London, 74 out of every 1000\r\nembarked. The landing arrangements added to the men's sufferings. To an\r\nunpractised eye the buildings used as hospitals at Scutari were\r\nimposing and convenient; and this fact accounts for some of the\r\nrose-coloured descriptions by which persons in high places were for a\r\ntime misled. Even the Principal Medical Officer on the spot was naïvely\r\ncontent with whitewash as a preparation to fit the Barrack for use as a\r\nhospital. In fact, however, the buildings were pest-houses. Underneath\r\nthe great structures \"were sewers of the worst possible construction,\r\nloaded with filth, mere cesspools, in fact, through which the wind blew\r\nsewer air up the pipes of numerous open privies into the corridors and\r\nwards where the sick were lying.\"[90] There was also frightful\r\novercrowding. For many months the space for each patient was one-fourth\r\nof what it ought to have been. And there was no proper ventilation. \"It\r\nis impossible,\" Miss Nightingale told the Royal Commission of 1857, \"to\r\ndescribe the state of the atmosphere of the Barrack Hospital at night. I\r\nhave been well acquainted with the dwellings of the worst parts of most\r\nof the great cities in Europe, but have never been in any atmosphere\r\nwhich I could compare with it.\" Lastly, hospital comforts, and even many\r\nhospital necessaries, were deficient.[91] The supply of bedsteads was\r\ninadequate. The commonest utensils, for decency as well as for comfort,\r\nwere lacking. The sheets, said Miss Nightingale, \"were of canvas, and so\r\ncoarse that the wounded men begged to be left in their blankets. It was\r\nindeed impossible to put men in such a state of emaciation into those\r\nsheets. There was no bedroom furniture of any kind, and only empty beer\r\nor wine bottles for candlesticks.\" Necessary surgical and medical\r\nappliances were often either wanting or not forthcoming. There was no\r\nmachinery, until Miss Nightingale came, for providing any hospital\r\ndelicacies. The result of this state of things upon patients arriving\r\nafter a painful voyage in an extreme state of weakness and emaciation,\r\nfrom wounds, from frost-bite, from dysentery, may be imagined, and it\r\nis no wonder that cholera and typhus were rife. In February 1855 the\r\nmortality per cent of the cases treated was forty-two. No words are\r\nnecessary to emphasize so terrible a figure.\r\n\r\n  [87] J. B. Atkins, _Life of Sir W. H. Russell_, vol. i. p. 143.\r\n\r\n  [88] _Notes_, sec. i. p. xxii.\r\n\r\n  [89] This Commission is referred to on later pages as \"The Duke of\r\n       Newcastle's.\"\r\n\r\n  [90] _Notes_, sec. iii. pp. iii., ix.\r\n\r\n  [91] If any reader desires to be sickened, I recommend to him the Report\r\n       on the Hospitals by the Sanitary Commissioners of 1855. And if any\r\n       one desires to find painful details under some of these heads\r\n       detailed above, without recourse to Blue-books, he may be referred\r\n       to the report in Hansard of the speech made by Mr. Augustus Stafford\r\n       (an eye-witness of what he described) in the House of Commons,\r\n       Jan. 29, 1855.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert had not waited for the reports of Commission and Committee\r\nto reach the conclusion that things were wrong:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have for some time,\" he wrote on December 14, 1854, to the\r\n     Commandant at Scutari, \"been very anxious and very much\r\n     dissatisfied as to the state of the hospital. I believe that every\r\n     effort has been made by the medical men, and I hear that you have\r\n     been indefatigable in the conduct of the immediate business of your\r\n     department. But there has been evidently a want of co-operation\r\n     between departments, and a fear of responsibility or timidity,\r\n     arising from an entire misconception of the wishes of the\r\n     Government. No expense has been spared at home, and immense stores\r\n     are sent out, but they are not forthcoming. Some are at Varna, and\r\n     for some inexplicable reason they are not brought down to Scutari.\r\n     When stores are in the hospital, they are not issued without forms\r\n     so cumbrous as to make the issue unavailing through delay. The\r\n     Purveyor's staff is said to be insufficient. The Commissariat staff\r\n     is said to be insufficient, your own staff is said to be\r\n     insufficient,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBy admission, then, and by official sentence, there were things amiss at\r\nScutari which urgently called for amendment. This is the first general\r\nconclusion which has to be remembered in relation to Miss Nightingale's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTo what individuals the disgrace of \"a disgraceful state of things\"\r\nattached, it is happily no concern of ours here to inquire. But as I\r\nhave called Mr. Sidney Herbert as a witness to the fact of the disgrace,\r\nI must add my conviction that his own part in the business was wholly\r\nbeneficent. Some research among the documents entitles me, perhaps, to\r\nexpress entire agreement with Mr. Kinglake's remark upon \"what might\r\nhave been if the Government, instead of appointing a Commission of\r\n_enquiry_ on the 23rd of October, had then delegated Mr. Sidney Herbert\r\nto go out for a month to the Bosphorus, and there _dictate_ immediate\r\naction.\" At home, Mr. Herbert was a good man struggling in the toils.\r\nThe fact is that, though there were some individuals palpably to blame,\r\nthe real fault was everybody's or nobody's. It was the fault of a\r\nvicious system, or rather the vice was that there was no system at all,\r\nno co-ordination, but only division of responsibility. The remarks of\r\nMr. Herbert, just quoted, point to the evil, and on every page of the\r\nBlue-books it is written large. There were at least eight authorities,\r\nworking independently of each other, whose co-operation was yet\r\nnecessary to get anything well done. There was the Secretary of State;\r\nthere was the War Office (under the Secretary-_at_-War); there were the\r\nHorse Guards, the Ordnance, the Victualling Office, the Transport\r\nOffice, the Army Medical Department, and the Treasury. The\r\nDirector-General of the Medical Department in London told the\r\nRoebuck Committee that he was under five distinct masters--the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, the Secretary of State, the Secretary-_at_-War, the\r\nMaster-General of Ordnance, and the Board of Ordnance. The Secretary of\r\nState said that he had issued no instructions as to the hospitals; he\r\nhad left that to the Medical Board. But the Medical Director-General\r\nsaid that it would have been impertinent for him to take the first\r\nstep.[92] If I were writing the history of the Crimean War, or of the\r\nGovernment Offices, other fundamental reasons for the disgraceful state\r\nof things in the hospitals--notably the miscalculated plan of military\r\ncampaign--would have to be taken into account; but I am writing only the\r\nlife of Miss Nightingale, and all that under this head the reader need\r\nbe asked to bear in mind is this: That the root of the evils which had\r\nto be dealt with was division of responsibility, and reluctance to\r\nassume it.\r\n\r\n  [92] _Roebuck Committee_, Fifth Report, pp. 17, 19.\r\n\r\nThe third conclusion of the official inquiries, which I want to\r\nemphasize, is contained in a passage in the Roebuck Committee's Report,\r\nwhich prefaced a reference to Miss Nightingale's mission: \"Your\r\nCommittee in conclusion cannot but remark that the first real\r\nimprovements in the lamentable condition of the hospitals at Scutari are\r\nto be attributed to private suggestions, private exertions, and private\r\nbenevolence.\"\r\n\r\nSo, then, we see that there were disgraceful evils at Scutari needing\r\namendment, and that in order to amend them what was needed was bold\r\ninitiative. This it was that Miss Nightingale supplied. The popular\r\nvoice thought of her only or mainly as the gentle nurse. That, too, she\r\nwas; and to her self-devotion in applying a woman's insight to a new\r\nsphere, a portion of her fame must ever be ascribed. But when men who\r\nknew all the facts spoke of her \"commanding genius,\"[93] it was rather\r\nof her work as an administrator that they were thinking. \"They could\r\nscarcely realize without personally seeing it,\" Mr. Stafford told the\r\nHouse of Commons, \"the heartfelt gratitude of the soldiers, or the\r\namount of misery which had been relieved\" by Miss Nightingale and her\r\nnurses; and, he added, \"it was impossible to do justice, not only to the\r\nkindness of heart, but to the clever judgment, the ready intelligence,\r\nand the experience displayed by the distinguished lady to whom this\r\ndifficult mission had been entrusted.\" These were the qualities which\r\nenabled her to reform, or to be the inspirer and instigator of reforms\r\nin, the British system of military hospitals. She began her work, where\r\nit lay immediately to her hand, in the Barrack Hospital at Scutari. She\r\ndid the work in three ways. She applied an expert's touch and a woman's\r\ninsight to a hospital hitherto managed exclusively by men. She boldly\r\nassumed responsibility, and did things herself which she could find no\r\none else ready to do. And, thirdly, she was instant and persistent in\r\nsuggestion, exhortation, reproaches, addressed to the authorities at\r\nhome. It will not be possible to keep these three branches of our\r\nsubject entirely distinct; but in the main they will form the topics\r\nsuccessively of the next three chapters.\r\n\r\n  [93] Dean Stanley, _Memorials of Edward and Catherine Stanley_, 2nd ed.,\r\n       p. 335. So, too, Mr. Sidney Herbert, in his speech at Willis's Rooms\r\n       on Nov. 29, 1855, referred to her as \"a woman of genius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                            THE EXPERT'S TOUCH\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Write that, when pride of human skill\r\n                   Fell prostrate with the weight of care,\r\n                 And men pray'd out for some strong will,\r\n                   Some reason 'mid the wild despair,--\r\n                 The loving heart of Woman rose\r\n                   To guide the hand and clear the eye,\r\n                 Gave hope amid the sternest woes,\r\n                   And saved what man had left to die.\r\n                                  R.

The Battle of\r\nBalaclava was fought on October 25; and on the day after her arrival,\r\nthe Battle of Inkerman.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Miss N. is decidedly well received,\" reported Mr. Bracebridge to Mr.\r\nHerbert (Nov. 8). A few days later, the Commander of the Forces, in a\r\nletter dated \"Before Sevastopol, Nov. 13th, 1854,\" bade her a hearty\r\nwelcome, tendering to her a \"grateful acknowledgment for thus charitably\r\ndevoting yourself to those who have suffered in the service of their\r\ncountry, regardless of the painful scenes you may have to witness.\" With\r\nsome of the military officers she had difficulties; from the Commander\r\nshe received nothing but courtesy, sympathy, and support.\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Nightingale cannot but here recall,\" she wrote after the war,\r\n     \"with deep gratitude and respect, the letters of support and\r\n     encouragement which she received from the late Lord Raglan, who\r\n     invariably acknowledged all that was attempted, for the good of\r\n     his men, with the deepest feeling, as well as with the high\r\n     courtesy and true manliness of his character. No tinge of petty\r\n     jealousy against those entrusted with any commission, public or\r\n     private, connected with the Army under his command, ever alloyed\r\n     his generous benevolence.\"[94]\r\n\r\n  [94] _Statement to Subscribers_, p. vii.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of some (but not all) of the military officers, and of the\r\nmen who caught their manners from the officers, was at first different.\r\nThere was sometimes ill-disguised jealousy, and consequent sulkiness.\r\nOutwardly, there was politeness; but difficulties were put into the way\r\nof \"the Bird,\" as some of them called her behind her back, and she was\r\nleft to shift for herself, when a little help might have eased the\r\nburden. \"It is the Bird's duty,\" they would say. Miss Nightingale,\r\nhowever, kept perfect command of her temper. \"She was always calm and\r\nself-possessed,\" says one of the Roman Catholic Sisters; \"she was a\r\nperfect lady through everything--never overbearing. I never heard her\r\nraise her voice.\"\r\n\r\nUpon most of the medical men on the spot she made a good impression at\r\nonce, because she proved herself to be efficient and helpful. She\r\napplied the expert's touch. But there were doctors and doctors. Some\r\nwelcomed her and her staff, and made as much use of them as possible.\r\nOthers resented their presence, and threw obstacles in their way. There\r\nwas one ward in which the junior medical officers had been advised by\r\ntheir superior to have as little to do with Miss Nightingale as\r\npossible. She showed exemplary patience under this kind of opposition,\r\nand gradually won her way into the confidence of most of the\r\ndoctors.[95] \"Miss Nightingale told us,\" says one of her staff, \"only to\r\nattend to patients in the wards of those surgeons who wished for our\r\nservices, and she charged us never to do anything for the patients\r\nwithout the leave of the doctors.\"[96] \"The number of nurses admitted\r\ninto each division of a hospital depended,\" Miss Nightingale herself\r\nexplained, \"upon the medical officer of that division, who sometimes\r\naccepted them, sometimes refused them, sometimes accepted them after\r\nthey had been refused; while the duties they were permitted to perform\r\nvaried according to the will of each individual medical officer.\"[97]\r\nThat this ill-defined state of things called constantly for tact and\r\ndiplomacy on the part of the Lady Superintendent, and often for severe\r\nself-restraint, will readily be perceived.\r\n\r\n  [95] See _Pincoffs_, p. 79.\r\n\r\n  [96] _Eastern Hospitals_, vol. i. p. 71.\r\n\r\n  [97] _Notes_, p. 152.\r\n\r\nOn the first arrival of Miss Nightingale and her staff, the wounded were\r\npouring in fast, and the nurses were told off to the worst surgical\r\ncases:--\r\n\r\n     \"Comfort yourselves,\" wrote Mr. Bracebridge to her parents (Nov.\r\n     20), \"that what the good Flo has done and is doing is priceless,\r\n     and is felt to be so by the medical men--the cleanliness of the\r\n     wounds, which were horribly dirty, the general order and\r\n     arrangement. There has not been half the jealousy I expected from\r\n     them towards her.\"\r\n\r\n     \"As to Miss Nightingale and her companions,\" wrote Mr. Osborne to\r\n     Mr. Herbert (Nov. 15), \"nothing can be said too strong in their\r\n     praise; she works them wonderfully, and they are so useful that I\r\n     have no hesitation in saying some 20 more of the same sort would be\r\n     a very great blessing to the establishment. Her nerve is equal to\r\n     her good sense; she, with one of the nurses and myself, gave\r\n     efficient aid at an amputation of the thigh yesterday. She was just\r\n     as cool as if she had had to do it herself.\"[98]\r\n\r\n  [98] _Stanmore_, vol. i. p. 349.\r\n\r\nA letter from Miss Nightingale herself to her friend of Harley Street,\r\nDr. Bowman, the ophthalmic surgeon, gives a lively account of some of\r\nher difficulties, and a vivid picture of the horrors amid which her work\r\nwas done (Nov. 14):--\r\n\r\n     \"_I came out, Ma'am, prepared to submit to everything, to be put\r\n     upon in every way. But there are some things, Ma'am, one can't\r\n     submit to. There is the Caps, Ma'am, that suits one face, and some\r\n     that suits another. And if I'd known, Ma'am, about the Caps, great\r\n     as was my desire to come out to nurse at Scutari, I wouldn't have\r\n     come, Ma'am._\"--_Speech of Mrs. Lawfield_.--Time must be at a\r\n     discount with the man who can adjust the balance of such an\r\n     important question as the above, and I for one have none: as you\r\n     will easily suppose when I tell you that on Thursday last we had\r\n     1715 sick and wounded in this Hospital (among whom 120 Cholera\r\n     Patients), and 650 severely wounded in the other Building called\r\n     the General Hospital, of which we also have charge, when a message\r\n     came to me to prepare for 510 wounded on our side of the Hospital\r\n     who were arriving from the dreadful affair of the 5th November from\r\n     Balaklava, in which battle were 1763 wounded and 442 killed,\r\n     besides 96 officers wounded and 38 killed. I always expected to end\r\n     my Days as Hospital Matron, but I never expected to be Barrack\r\n     Mistress. We had but half an hour's notice before they began\r\n     landing the wounded. Between one and 9 o'clock we had the\r\n     mattresses stuffed, sewn up, laid down--alas! only upon matting on\r\n     the floor--the men washed and put to bed, and all their wounds\r\n     dressed. I wish I had time. I would write you a letter dear to a\r\n     surgeon's heart. I am as good as a _Medical Times_! But oh! you\r\n     Gentlemen of England who sit at Home in all the well-earned\r\n     satisfaction of your successful cases, can have little Idea from\r\n     reading the newspapers of the Horror and Misery (in a Military\r\n     Hospital) of operating upon these dying, exhausted men. A London\r\n     Hospital is a Garden of Flowers to it.\r\n\r\n     We have had such a Sea in the Bosphorus, and the Turks, the very\r\n     men for whom we are fighting, carry in our Wounded so cruelly, that\r\n     they arrive in a state of Agony. One amputated Stump died 2 hours\r\n     after we received him, one compound Fracture just as we were\r\n     getting him into Bed--in all, twenty-four cases died on the day of\r\n     landing. The Dysentery Cases have died at the rate of one in two.\r\n     Then the day of operations which follows....\r\n\r\n     We are very lucky in our Medical Heads. Two of them are brutes, and\r\n     four are angels--for this is a work which makes either angels or\r\n     devils of men and of women too. As for the assistants, they are all\r\n     Cubs, and will, while a man is breathing his last breath under the\r\n     knife, lament the \"annoyance of being called up from their dinners\r\n     by such a fresh influx of wounded\"! But unlicked Cubs grow up into\r\n     good old Bears, tho' I don't know how; for certain it is the old\r\n     Bears are good. We have now _four miles_ of Beds, and not eighteen\r\n     inches apart.\r\n\r\n     We have our Quarters in one Tower of the Barrack, and all this\r\n     fresh influx has been laid down between us and the Main Guard, in\r\n     two Corridors, with a line of Beds down each side, just room for\r\n     one person to pass between, and four wards. Yet in the midst of\r\n     this appalling Horror (we are steeped up to our necks in blood)\r\n     there is good, and I can truly say, like St. Peter, \"It is good for\r\n     us to be here\"--though I doubt whether if St. Peter had been here,\r\n     he would have said so. As I went my night-rounds among the newly\r\n     wounded that first night, there was not one murmur, not one groan,\r\n     the strictest discipline--the most absolute silence and quiet\r\n     prevailed--only the steps of the Sentry--and I heard one man say,\r\n     \"I was dreaming of my friends at Home,\" and another said, \"I was\r\n     thinking of them.\" These poor fellows bear pain and mutilation\r\n     with an unshrinking heroism which is really superhuman, and die, or\r\n     are cut up without a complaint.\r\n\r\n     The wounded are now lying up to our very door, and we are landing\r\n     540 more from the _Andes_. I take rank in the Army as Brigadier\r\n     General, because 40 British females, whom I have with me, are more\r\n     difficult to manage than 4000 men. Let no lady come out here who is\r\n     not used to fatigue and privation.... Every ten minutes an Orderly\r\n     runs, and we have to go and cram lint into the wound till a Surgeon\r\n     can be sent for, and stop the Bleeding as well as we can. In all\r\n     our corridor, I think we have not an average of three Limbs per\r\n     man. And there are two Ships more \"loading\" at the Crimea with\r\n     wounded--(this is our Phraseology). Then come the operations, and a\r\n     melancholy, not an encouraging List is this. They are all performed\r\n     in the wards--no time to move them; one poor fellow exhausted with\r\n     hæmorrhage, has his leg amputated as a last hope, and dies ten\r\n     minutes after the Surgeon has left him. Almost before the breath\r\n     has left his body it is sewn up in its blanket, and carried away\r\n     and buried the same day. We have no room for Corpses in the Wards.\r\n     The Surgeons pass on to the next, an excision of the\r\n     shoulder-joint, beautifully performed and going on well. Ball\r\n     lodged just in the head of the joint and fracture starred all\r\n     round. The next poor fellow has two Stumps for arms, and the next\r\n     has lost an arm and a leg. As for the Balls they go in where they\r\n     like and come out where they like and do as much harm as they can\r\n     in passing. That is the only rule they have....\r\n\r\n     I am getting a Screen now for the amputations, for when one poor\r\n     fellow, who is to be amputated to-morrow sees his comrade to-day\r\n     die under the knife, it makes impression and diminishes his chance.\r\n     But, anyway, among these exhausted Frames, the mortality of the\r\n     operations is frightful. We have Erysipelas, fever and gangrene,\r\n     and the Russian wounded are the worst.\r\n\r\n     We are getting on nicely though in many ways. They were so glad to\r\n     see us. The Senior Chaplain is a sensible man, which is a\r\n     remarkable Providence.... If you ever see Mr. Whitfield, the House\r\n     Apothecary of St. Thomas', will you tell him that the nurse he sent\r\n     me, Mrs. Roberts, is worth her weight in gold.... Mrs. Drake is a\r\n     Treasure. The four others are not fit to take care of themselves,\r\n     but they may do better by and bye if I can convince them of the\r\n     absolute necessity of discipline. We hear there was another\r\n     engagement on the 8th and more wounded, who are coming down to us.\r\n     This is only the beginning of things.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Chaplain had the sense, among other things, to appreciate\r\nMiss Nightingale. \"The Chaplain says,\" wrote Mr. Nightingale to a\r\nfriend (Dec. 12), \"'Miss Nightingale is an admirable person; none of us\r\ncan sufficiently admire her. A perfect lady, she wins and rules every\r\none, the most rugged official melts before her gentle voice, and all\r\nseem glad to do her bidding.'\"\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale had that \"excellent thing in woman\": Lady Lovelace,\r\nin the poem already quoted, spoke of her friend's \"soft, silvery voice\";\r\nbut it could command, as well as charm, unless indeed it were the charm\r\nthat commanded. \"She scolds sergeants and orderlies all day long,\" wrote\r\nMr. Bracebridge to her parents (Nov. 20); \"you would be astonished to\r\nsee how fierce she is grown.\" That was written, of course, in fun; but\r\nthere was always a note of calm authority in her voice. A Crimean\r\nveteran recalled her passing his bed with some doctors, who were saying,\r\n\"It can't be done,\" and her replying quietly, \"It _must_ be done.\" \"I\r\nseem to hear her saying it,\" writes one who knew her well; \"there seemed\r\nto be no appeal from her quiet conclusive manner.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the nurses, Miss Nightingale, as may be gathered from the\r\nletter to Dr. Bowman, found them rather a difficult team to drive, and\r\nthis fact should be remembered in considering an episode presently to be\r\nrelated (II.). She had to send one nurse back to England at once,\r\nfilling the vacancy by a German Sister from the Kaiserswerth colony at\r\nConstantinople. Of the six nurses supplied by St. John's House, \"four,\r\nalas! returned shortly from Scutari, not being prepared to accept the\r\ndiscipline and privations of the life out there.\"[99] We need not be too\r\nimpatient with Mrs. Lawfield (who turned out an excellent nurse) for her\r\nobjection to the cap. The uniform, devised on the spur of the moment,\r\nseems to have been very much less becoming than that of the \"Staff\r\nNurse, New Style,\" with her \"gown of silver gray, bright steel chain,\r\nand chignon's elegant array.\"[100] The Nightingale nurses in the East\r\nwore \"grey tweed wrappers, worsted jackets, with caps and short woollen\r\ncloaks, and a frightful scarf of brown holland, embroidered in red with\r\nthe words, 'Scutari Hospital.'\"[101] Such is the description of the\r\ncostume worn by the seculars which is given by one of the Roman Catholic\r\nSisters, not without some pity as she thought of her own religious\r\nhabit. But the short cloak should not be so contemptuously dismissed.\r\n\"The red uniform cape worn by the ladies of the Queen Alexandra's\r\nImperial Military Nursing Service is modelled on that originally\r\nintroduced by Florence Nightingale for the nurses whom she took with her\r\nto Scutari. This cape may therefore be regarded as a memorial to the\r\ngreat founder of military nursing.\"[102] As for the \"frightful scarf\"\r\nsome such distinctive badge was a very necessary precaution amid the\r\nrough-and-tumble of a military depot and its camp-followers. A raw\r\nnew-comer was seen to approach one of the nurses in the street. \"You\r\nleave her alone,\" said his mate, \"don't you see she's one of Miss\r\nNightingale's women?\" Their cloth was respected throughout the camps;\r\nbut Miss Nightingale had to dismiss two or three for levity of conduct.\r\nOn arriving at Scutari, she had placed ten in the General Hospital and\r\ntwenty-eight in the Barrack Hospital, and in neither did she find it\r\neasy to maintain discipline. From time to time she transferred nurses,\r\nsending the best to other hospitals, keeping the less trustworthy under\r\nher own eye; and sending some home, who were unwilling to stay or found\r\nincompetent, as other recruits arrived. Of the thirty-eight in the first\r\nparty, she considered that not more than sixteen were really efficient,\r\nwhilst five or six were in a class of excellence by themselves.\r\n\r\n   [99] _St. John's House: a Record_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n  [100] W. E. Henley, _In Hospital_.\r\n\r\n  [101] _Memories of the Crimea_, by Sister Mary Aloysius, p. 17. The\r\n        \"frightful scarf\" was a plain band worn, I suppose, over one arm\r\n        and under the other.\r\n\r\n  [102] _Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps_ (Bibliography B, No.\r\n        52), p. 393.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties--including the great Dress Question--which Miss\r\nNightingale had with her staff, appear clearly enough in the \"Rules and\r\nRegulations for the Nurses attached to the Military Hospitals in the\r\nEast,\" which Miss Nightingale presently sent home to Mr. Herbert, who\r\nhad them printed, and handed to every candidate for appointment as\r\nnurse. \"As it has been stated,\" says the preamble, \"that the nurses who\r\nhave gone to the hospitals in the East, have in some instances\r\ncomplained of being subject to hardships and to rules for which they\r\nwere not previously prepared, and of having to do work differing from\r\nwhat they expected, it has been thought desirable to state distinctly\r\nthe regulations relative to the outfit, clothing, duties, and position\r\nof nurses in military hospitals.\" The nurses, it is then set forth, \"are\r\nrequired to appear at all times in the regulation dress with the badge,\r\nand never to wear flowers in their bonnet-caps, or ribbons, other than\r\nsuch as are provided for them, or are sanctioned by the superintendent.\"\r\nAnother rule defines the precise quantities of spirituous liquor which a\r\nnurse will be allowed; a third states that \"no nurse will be allowed to\r\nwalk out except with the housekeeper, or with a party of at least three\r\nnurses together, and never without leave previously obtained.\" The whole\r\ncode shows the necessity which Miss Nightingale had found for enforcing\r\nstrict discipline.[103] And even with these new regulations to back her,\r\nshe still found discipline hard to enforce. Her official letters to the\r\nWar Office complain of unsuitable recruits being sent out to her, and of\r\nthe greater number of them as being \"wholly undisciplined.\"\r\n\r\n  [103] The manuscript of this document is preserved among the archives of\r\n        the War Office. The text of these, \"the earliest rules defining the\r\n        position and duties of a female nurse in any military hospital,\"\r\n        has been printed elsewhere (Bibliography B, No. 52).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nIn December 1854 Miss Nightingale was astonished to receive an\r\nannouncement that a party of forty-seven more nurses, under the care of\r\nher friend, Miss Mary Stanley, were on their way to join her. She\r\nremonstrated, and threatened to resign:--\r\n\r\n     \"You have sacrificed the cause so near my heart,\" she wrote to Mr.\r\n     Sidney Herbert (Dec. 15); \"you have sacrificed me, a matter of\r\n     small importance now; you have sacrificed your own written word to\r\n     a popular cry. You must feel that I ought to resign, where\r\n     conditions are imposed upon me which render the object for which I\r\n     am employed unattainable, and I only remain at my post till I have\r\n     provided in some measure for these poor wanderers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert replied, as his biographer states, in terms of courtesy and\r\nkindliness, and without any trace of the bitterness which Miss\r\nNightingale's vehemence might have evoked in a smaller-minded man. There\r\nis a letter to Mrs. Bracebridge (Dec. 27) in which Mrs. Herbert says: \"I\r\nam heart-broken about the nurses, but I do assure you, if you send them\r\nall home without a trial, you will lose some really valuable women.\" The\r\nMinister had authorized Miss Nightingale, if on full consideration she\r\nthought fit, to return Miss Stanley's party to England at his own\r\nprivate expense. Her good sense soon showed her that such a course would\r\nbe, as she wrote, \"a moral impossibility\"; and in the end she made the\r\nbest she could of what she considered a bad job--to the great advantage,\r\nas it was to turn out, of the wounded soldiers, though at a great\r\nincrease to her own responsibilities and difficulties.\r\n\r\nMuch has been made in some quarters[104] of this episode, and it may be\r\nwell here to explain Miss Nightingale's position clearly; for the affair\r\nthrows strong light upon the difficulties of her task. It is essential\r\nto know, in the first place, that Mr. Herbert had distinctly stated that\r\nthe selection of nurses was to be exclusively in Miss Nightingale's\r\nhands. This is implied in his official instructions (p. 156), and was\r\nstated with the utmost emphasis in a letter \"to a correspondent,\" which\r\nhe had caused to be inserted in the newspapers of October 24. Already\r\nthe cry had been raised that more nurses should be sent, and volunteers\r\nwere clamouring for enlistment. Mr. Herbert thereupon wrote:--\r\n\r\n     WAR OFFICE, _October_ 21 [1854].... The duties of a hospital nurse,\r\n     if they are properly performed, require great skill as well as\r\n     strength and courage, especially where the cases are surgical cases\r\n     and the majority of them are from gunshot wounds. Persons who have\r\n     no experience or skill in such matters would be of no use whatever;\r\n     and in moments of great pressure, such as must of necessity at\r\n     intervals occur in a military hospital, any person who is not of\r\n     use is an impediment. Many ladies, whose generous enthusiasm\r\n     prompts them to offer their services as nurses, are little aware of\r\n     the hardships they would have to encounter, and the horrors they\r\n     would have to witness, which would try the firmest nerves. Were all\r\n     accepted who offer, I fear we should have not only many inefficient\r\n     nurses, but many hysterical patients themselves requiring treatment\r\n     instead of assisting others....\r\n\r\n     No additional nurses will be sent out to Miss Nightingale until she\r\n     shall have written home from Scutari and reported how far her\r\n     labours have been successful, and what number and description of\r\n     persons, if any, she requires in addition.... No one can be sent\r\n     out until we hear from Miss Nightingale that they are required.\r\n\r\n  [104] Especially by Lord Stanmore in his _Memoir of Sidney Herbert_. He\r\n        handles it, I think, with some needless asperity, and he might have\r\n        mentioned Mr. Herbert's letter which is here quoted.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had not written home in that sense at all, but Mr.\r\nHerbert had sent the nurses. That was what she meant when she said that\r\nhe had \"sacrificed his own written word.\" \"Had I had the enormous\r\nfolly,\" she wrote to Mr. Herbert (Dec. 15), \"at the end of eleven days'\r\nexperience, to require more women, would it not seem that you, as a\r\nstatesman, should have said, 'Wait till you can see your way better.'\r\nBut I made no such request.\" She was an expert, and did not wish to be\r\ninundated with amateurs. Moreover, everybody at Scutari knew, as she\r\nwrote, the terms of Mr. Herbert's letter to the newspapers, and the\r\nmedical men knew that she had not asked for any more nurses. Yet here\r\nwas a new party sent out; and, to make the encroachment on her domain\r\nthe more marked, Miss Stanley had received instructions to, and reported\r\nherself to, not the Superintendent of the Nurses, but other officials.\r\nMiss Nightingale felt that her authority had been flouted, her position\r\nundermined. But personal considerations were not the cause of her\r\nvexation. It was not a case of \"pique,\" as some people in England\r\nimagined. Mr. Herbert and she were engaged in making a new experiment.\r\nIt was full of difficulties, and the only chance of success lay in the\r\nmaintenance of undivided responsibility and clearly established\r\nauthority. Miss Nightingale could not quietly have accepted the new\r\nsituation without sacrificing the key of the position. Had she\r\nacquiesced, she would have admitted that Mr. Herbert might henceforth\r\nsend out nurses without consulting her, and without placing them\r\nexpressly under her orders. She would have left herself at the mercy of\r\nany well-meaning person in England who thought that this or that might\r\nbe helpful to her. Her judgment would no longer have been the governing\r\nfactor; while yet for any confusion or failure that might follow, she\r\nwould be held responsible. Mr. Herbert thought, no doubt, that already\r\nthe experiment had been a great success, as indeed it was, and he was\r\neager to increase the scale of it. He might not unreasonably think that,\r\nas the number of the wounded increased, so should the number of female\r\nnurses be increased also. Mr. Osborne's remark, cited above (p. 183),\r\nmust have confirmed him in such an opinion. But to Miss Nightingale on\r\nthe spot the case wore a very different aspect. We must remember the\r\nsevere mental strain of her position; the high pressure of work and\r\nemotion at which she was living, all the higher to one of her intensely\r\nsensitive conscientiousness; the continual failure (to her critical\r\nmind) of attempts to reform cruel abuses; the danger of real,\r\nacknowledged failure always present. In such a position, the arrival of\r\na fresh batch of nurses, unexpected and unsolicited, must have seemed to\r\nher the break-up of all her plans, the destruction of the standard of\r\nnursing which she was painfully creating, the gravest peril to an\r\nexperiment, still on its trial, and ever subject to hostile criticism.\r\n\r\nImmediate and practical difficulties were also great. There was no\r\naccommodation in the hospitals at Scutari available for additional\r\nfemale nurses. \"The 46,\" wrote Mr. Bracebridge to Mr. Smith (Dec. 18),\r\n\"have fallen on us like a cloud of locusts. Where to house them, feed\r\nthem, place them, is difficult; how to care for them, not to be\r\nimagined.\" The Principal Medical Officer flatly refused to have any\r\nmore, and Miss Nightingale herself felt that she could not manage any\r\nmore:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have toiled my way,\" she wrote (Dec. 15), \"into the confidence\r\n     of the Medical Men. I have, by incessant vigilance, day and night,\r\n     introduced something like system into the disorderly operations of\r\n     these women. And the plan may be said to have succeeded in some\r\n     measure, _as it stands_.... But to have women scampering about the\r\n     wards of a Military Hospital all day long, which they would do, did\r\n     an increased number relax the discipline and increase their\r\n     leisure, would be as improper as absurd.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was a further objection. A considerable number of the second\r\nparty were Roman Catholics, and Miss Stanley herself (as Miss\r\nNightingale well knew) was on the verge of joining the Roman Communion.\r\nHow much this factor in the case added to the force of Miss\r\nNightingale's objections, we shall learn in a later chapter. Mr. Herbert\r\nthought, I suppose, that the additional nurses would be welcome to her\r\nbecause they came under the escort of a friend. But so strongly did Miss\r\nNightingale feel on the subject, that Miss Stanley's part in the affair\r\nrankled the more. It was in the house of her friends, she felt, that she\r\nhad been wounded. Their personal relations were further embittered by\r\nthe case of a nurse whom Miss Nightingale (with the concurrence of the\r\nother authorities) felt obliged to dismiss, but whom Miss Stanley\r\nbelieved to be ill-used. Miss Nightingale's friendship with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHerbert was in no way impaired. They had confessed themselves in the\r\nwrong; and so she was deeply touched, as she wrote, by their kindness\r\nand generosity. But between her and Miss Stanley the breach was never\r\nhealed. Their later lives took different directions, and they did not\r\nmeet again.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's resentment was perfectly justified. Her remonstrances\r\nto Mr. Herbert were necessary. His well-intentioned action was\r\ncalculated to undermine her authority, and to aggravate her\r\ndifficulties; and, in both of these ways, to imperil the success of\r\ntheir joint experiment. Her handling of the crisis which had burst upon\r\nher was, perhaps, in relation to the subordinates unfortunate. Miss\r\nStanley was accompanied by Dr. Meyer, a medical man, and Mr. Jocelyne\r\nPercy, who had gone out (as Mrs. Herbert wrote to Mrs. Bracebridge)\r\ndevoted to Miss Nightingale, \"saying he would be her footman, etc.\"[105]\r\n\"We picked out,\" added Mrs. Herbert plaintively, \"the two men in England\r\nwho, we thought, would help Flo most,\" and they returned sad and sore at\r\ntheir cold reception. Miss Nightingale, acting on advice she received on\r\nthe spot, asked them to sign notes of their conversation with her;[106]\r\nthis rankled with them, and Mr. Percy made a grievance of it in\r\nEngland. Mrs. Herbert, in reporting all this to Mrs. Bracebridge (Jan.\r\n7, 1855), made the final reflection: \"Perhaps it is wholesome for us to\r\nbe reminded that Flo is _still a mortal_, which we were beginning to\r\ndoubt.\" Mortals have to deal with entanglements as best they may on the\r\nspur of the moment; and those at a distance hardly made enough allowance\r\nfor the difficulties with which Miss Nightingale was suddenly\r\nconfronted, for the danger which Mr. Herbert's dispatch of unsolicited\r\nreinforcements involved, and, therefore, for the importance which she\r\nattached to having all the conditions defined in black and white.\r\n\r\n  [105] See below, p. 241.\r\n\r\n  [106] It was Mr. Bracebridge who took the notes of the interview.\r\n\r\nHer practical genius and good sense speedily triumphed, however, over\r\nthe difficulties of the case. In agreement with the medical authorities,\r\nthe number of female nurses at Scutari was raised to 50, and Miss\r\nNightingale weeded out some of her original staff in favour of\r\nnew-comers. Others of them were sent to the hospitals at Balaclava (p.\r\n254); and others to those at Koulali (p. 174). Miss Stanley, whose\r\nintention it had been to return to England as soon as she had deposited\r\nher party, remained for several months in charge at the latter place,\r\nnot administering the nursing service altogether according to Miss\r\nNightingale's ideas,[107] but rendering aid to the afflicted of which\r\nher brother, the Dean, has left us so charming and sympathetic a\r\nmemorial.[108]\r\n\r\n  [107] Miss Nightingale made some criticisms in an official letter to the\r\n        War Office, May 1, 1855; printed at pp. 389, 390 of the pamphlet\r\n        No. 52 in Bibliography B. And in another letter (March 5) she\r\n        begged Lord Panmure to relieve her of responsibility for the\r\n        hospitals at Koulali.\r\n\r\n  [108] In an appendix to the _second_ edition (1880) of his _Memorials of\r\n        Edward and Catherine Stanley_.\r\n\r\nIn the end, then, the scope of Miss Nightingale's experiment was\r\nconsiderably enlarged; and the deeper significance of the episode is to\r\nbe found in the emphasis which it throws upon the novelty and\r\ndifficulties of Miss Nightingale's enterprise. In these days, nurses,\r\ntrained and distinctively attired, are so much part of everyday life,\r\nwomen-nurses serving under the Red Cross are so normal a feature of war,\r\nand Territorial nurses, smartly uniformed, are so familiar a unit of\r\nauxiliary forces, that some effort of imagination is required to realize\r\nthe conditions which existed sixty years ago. We remember that a staff\r\nof nearly 800 female nurses was maintained for service in the South\r\nAfrican War, and may be tempted to smile at the question between 20 and\r\n40, or 40 and 90 for the Crimea. But it was Miss Nightingale who showed\r\nthe way, and the way of the pioneer is rough. No one who reads this\r\nvolume will suspect her of timidity, or think her wanting in\r\nself-confidence; yet so conscious was she of the difficulties that in\r\nthis instance she under-rated her power, and was anxious to keep the\r\nexperiment within much narrower limits than it assumed. Her original\r\nidea had been to limit the number of female nurses to 20, but at various\r\ndates after Miss Stanley's arrival she sent home for more nurses, and,\r\nbefore the war was over, she had had control of 125.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's reluctance to assume the superintendence of\r\nadditional nurses will be the more readily understood when we pass to\r\nthe multifarious duties which circumstances led her to discharge.\r\n\r\n     \"Having understood,\" she wrote to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe (Nov.\r\n     7), \"that Your Excellency has the power of drawing upon Government\r\n     for the uses of the sick and wounded, I beg to state that there is\r\n     at present a great deficiency of linen among the men in the\r\n     Hospitals until the Government Stores can arrive and be\r\n     appropriated to them. A hundred pairs of sheets and 200 shirts\r\n     might be applied to such a temporary purpose, and would never be\r\n     _de trop_. Also a few American stoves, upon which we might prepare\r\n     delicate food for the worst cases, who require to be fed every two\r\n     or three hours, which is of course impossible for the Medical\r\n     Officers and Orderlies to attend to; many deaths are necessarily\r\n     the consequence.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion to the Ambassador, made on the third day after Miss\r\nNightingale's arrival, serves to introduce two main directions in which\r\nshe applied a woman's insight to the condition of things at Scutari.\r\nEfficient nursing requires, she well knew, cleanliness and delicately\r\ncooked food. She set herself with characteristic energy to supply these\r\nnecessities. She found \"not a basin, nor a towel, nor a bit of soap, nor\r\na broom,\" and instantly requisitioned 300 scrubbing brushes. \"The first\r\nimprovements took place,\" said Mr. Macdonald, \"after Miss Nightingale's\r\narrival--greater cleanliness and greater order. I recollect one of the\r\nfirst things she asked me to supply was 200 hard scrubbers and sacking\r\nfor washing the floors, for which no means existed at that time.\"[109]\r\nMiss Nightingale had foreseen that washing would be one of the first\r\nthings necessary. During the voyage out, as the ship was approaching\r\nConstantinople, one of the party went up to her and said earnestly, \"Oh,\r\nMiss Nightingale, when we land, don't let there be any red-tape delays,\r\nlet us get straight to nursing the poor fellows!\" \"The strongest will be\r\nwanted at the wash-tub,\" was the reply. Until Miss Nightingale arrived,\r\nthe number of shirts washed during a month was six.[110] Up to the date\r\nof her arrival, the Purveyor-General had contracted for the washing of\r\nthe hospital bedding, and of the linen of the patients. Simultaneously,\r\nhowever, with the arrival of the wounded from Inkerman, it was found\r\nthat the contractor had broken down in the latter part of his contract.\r\nAnd even with regard to the former part, the bedding was washed, Miss\r\nNightingale discovered, in cold water. She insisted upon hot; the more\r\nsince it was found, as the Duke of Newcastle's commissioners reported,\r\nthat many of the articles sent back from the wash as clean, had to be\r\ndestroyed as being in fact verminous. Miss Nightingale accordingly took\r\na Turkish house, had boilers supplied in it by the Engineer's Office,\r\nemployed soldiers' wives to do the washing, and thus gave the sick and\r\nwounded the comfort of clean linen. All this was paid for partly out of\r\nher private funds and partly by the _Times_ fund.\r\n\r\n  [109] _Roebuck Committee, Q_. 6140.\r\n\r\n  [110] This fact, reported by the Roebuck Committee, barbed one of\r\n        Mr. Kinglake's sarcasms against the males (vi. 427 _n._). It also\r\n        greatly impressed John Bright. See Mr. G. M. Trevelyan's _Life_ of\r\n        him, 1913, p. 242.\r\n\r\nYet more important, perhaps, to the comfort and recovery of the sick,\r\nwere Miss Nightingale's \"Extra Diet Kitchens.\" When she came to the\r\nBarrack Hospital she found that all the cooking was done in thirteen\r\nlarge coppers, situated at one end of the vast building. The patients'\r\nbeds extended over a space of from three to four miles (including, of\r\ncourse, both wards and corridors); it took three or four hours to serve\r\nthe ordinary dinners, and there were no facilities whatever for\r\npreparing delicacies between times. Within ten days of her arrival, Miss\r\nNightingale had remedied this defect. She opened two \"extra diet\r\nkitchens\" in different parts of the building, and had three\r\nsupplementary boilers fixed on one of the staircases for the preparation\r\nof arrowroot and the like. As explained more fully below (p. 201),\r\nnothing was supplied except in accordance with medical directions; and\r\nshe met the doctors' requisitions out of her private stores only when\r\nthe government stores failed. \"It is obvious,\" she explained, \"that Miss\r\nNightingale would have shielded herself from heavy responsibility by\r\nadhering, and by obtaining the adherence of the medical officers, to the\r\nstrict precedents of Military Hospital Regulations, according to which\r\nthe materials for the Extra Diets would have been sent in to her by the\r\npurveyor without requisition, in the same manner as is practised in the\r\ncase of the ordinary diets; but she felt that in doing so she would most\r\nfrequently be defeating the object she was sent to carry out, for in the\r\nmajority of cases the purveyor had either no supply, or a supply of a\r\nvery indifferent quality of the articles required.\"[111] It is safe to\r\nsay that many lives were saved by the application by Miss Nightingale of\r\nthe good housewife's care to the kitchen of the hospitals. The woman's\r\neye was not above distinguishing between bone and gristle and meat in\r\nthe men's dinner, and she wanted to have the meat issued from the stores\r\nboned, so that one patient should not get all bone, another all gristle,\r\nand another all meat. But on this point she was beaten. The\r\nInspector-General informed her that it would require a new \"Regulation\r\nof the Service\" to \"bone the meat\"!! The notes of exclamation are\r\nhers.[112] In the culinary department an invaluable volunteer arrived in\r\n1855 in the person of Alexis Soyer, once famous as the _chef_ of the\r\nReform Club, and still alive as M. Mirobolant in Thackeray's\r\n_Pendennis_. M. Soyer rearranged and partly superseded Miss\r\nNightingale's kitchens at Scutari. We shall meet with him and his good\r\nwork again when we accompany her to the Crimea.\r\n\r\n  [111] _Statement_, p. 26 _n._\r\n\r\n  [112] Letter to Mr. Herbert, Feb. 5, 1855.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was not long at Scutari without being touched by the\r\npitiable condition of the women camp-followers, separated often from\r\ntheir regiments, and in a very forlorn state. Miss Nightingale deputed\r\nthe care of them in large measure to Mrs. Bracebridge, who, with her\r\nhusband, collected and administered a separate fund for giving\r\nassistance to the wives, women, and children of soldiers at Scutari. A\r\nLying-in Hospital was organized; and Miss Nightingale found employment\r\nfor many of the women, both in washing as aforesaid, and in making up\r\nold linen into various hospital requisites. Here, too, helpful\r\nvolunteers presently arrived. The Rev. Dr. and Lady Alicia Blackwood\r\nwere moved after the Battle of Inkerman to go out to Scutari and see if\r\nthey could be of use. Dr. Blackwood asked and obtained an appointment as\r\na military chaplain; and, on their arrival, Lady Alicia went straight to\r\nMiss Nightingale and asked what she could do to help:--\r\n\r\n     \"The reply she gave me,\" wrote Lady Alicia, \"or rather the question\r\n     she put me in reply, after a few seconds of silence, with a\r\n     peculiar expression of countenance, made an indelible impression.\r\n     'Do you mean what you say?' 'Yes, certainly; why do you ask me?'\r\n     'Because I have had several such applications before, and when I\r\n     have suggested work, I found it could not be done, or some excuse\r\n     was made; it was not exactly the sort of thing intended, it\r\n     required special suitability, &c.' 'Well,' I replied, 'I am in\r\n     earnest; we came out here with no other wish than to help where we\r\n     could.' 'Very well, then, you really can help me if you will. In\r\n     this Barrack are now located some two hundred poor women in the\r\n     most abject misery. A great number have been sent down from Varna;\r\n     they are in rags, and covered with vermin. My heart bleeds for\r\n     them; but my work is with the soldiers, not with their wives. Now,\r\n     will you undertake to look after them? If you will take them as\r\n     your charge, I will send an orderly who will show you their\r\n     haunts.'\"[113]\r\n\r\n  [113] _Narrative of a Residence on the Bosphorus_, p. 49. Any reader who\r\n        wishes to be harrowed should read the following pages in Lady\r\n        Alicia's Journal. She died in July 1913 in her 95th year.\r\n\r\nLady Alicia went, and with her husband was of great assistance. Miss\r\nNightingale was mindful also of the families of her nurses. Some of them\r\nwere wives and widows who had left children at home. \"Many things turn\r\nup,\" wrote Lady Verney to a friend, \"for us to do for Florence; as in\r\nlooking after the children of her nurses.\" And Mrs. Nightingale wrote\r\nsimilarly (April 1855):--\r\n\r\n     Flo has been writing incessantly lately about her nurses' families,\r\n     for whom the best seem getting very anxious, and she scarcely\r\n     mentions anything else. We have seen and heard much in visiting\r\n     them which is a great pleasure to us.\r\n\r\nBefore the Roebuck Committee, Dr. Andrew Smith, the head of the Army\r\nMedical Department in London, was asked, \"What do you think was the\r\nresult of Miss Nightingale's mission?\" \"I daresay,\" he answered,\r\napparently with some reluctance, \"it was very advantageous\"; and then,\r\npulling himself together like a man and seeking to be just, he added:\r\n\"There is no doubt about it; because females are able to discover many\r\ndeficiencies that a man would not think of, and they will look at things\r\nthat a man will have no idea of looking to.\" A very true statement; and\r\nperhaps as much as could reasonably be expected from an official on the\r\ndefensive. But I think we shall find in the next chapter that some of\r\nthe things which Miss Nightingale saw and did were not unworthy of the\r\nmore comprehensive sweep claimed by Dr. Smith for the male faculty of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                             THE ADMINISTRATOR\r\n\r\n\r\n     I have no hesitation in saying that Miss Nightingale has exhibited\r\n     greater power of organization, a greater familiarity with details,\r\n     while at the same time taking a comprehensive view of the general\r\n     bearing of the subject, than has marked the conduct of any one\r\n     connected with the hospitals during the present war.--_Sidney\r\n     Herbert_ (speech at Willis's Rooms, Nov. 29, 1855).\r\n\r\nOstensibly, and by the strict letter of her original instructions, Miss\r\nNightingale was only Superintendent of the Female Nursing establishment.\r\nIn fact, and by force of circumstances, she became a Purveyor to the\r\nHospitals, a Clothier to the British Army, and in many emergencies a\r\n_Dea ex machina_.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe became, first, Purveyor-Auxiliary to the hospitals at Scutari. My\r\nstatements under this head might seem to be the inventions of a satirist\r\nif I did not disclaim credit for such ingenuity by adding that they are\r\nin every case extracted from official sources. Of the ignorance existing\r\nin high places of the true state of things at Scutari, the best\r\nillustration is the answer which the British Ambassador gave when he was\r\nasked by the Commissioner of the _Times_ Fund what things were most\r\nneeded in the hospitals. \"Nothing is needed,\" said Lord Stratford, and\r\nthe only suggestion he could make to the _Times_ was that it should\r\ndevote its fund to building an English Church at Pera. Miss Nightingale\r\nthought that the service of God included the service of man, and Mr.\r\nMacdonald, the _Times_ Commissioner, agreed with her. Between them, they\r\nestablished not a church, but a store. The Ambassador of course formed\r\nhis conclusions from what he was told; and the Principal Medical Officer\r\nat Scutari \"stated that he wanted nothing in the shape of stores or\r\nmedical comforts at a time when his patients were destitute of the\r\ncommonest necessaries. Assistance which had been discouraged as\r\nsuperfluous was eventually found essential for the lives of the\r\npatients.\"[114]\r\n\r\n     \"I am a kind of General Dealer,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to Mr.\r\n     Herbert (Jan. 4, 1855), \"in socks, shirts, knives and forks, wooden\r\n     spoons, tin baths, tables and forms, cabbage and carrots, operating\r\n     tables, towels and soap, small tooth combs, precipitate for\r\n     destroying lice, scissors, bedpans and stump pillows. I will send\r\n     you a picture of my Caravanserai, into which beasts come in and\r\n     out. Indeed the vermin might, if they had but 'unity of purpose,'\r\n     carry off the four miles of beds on their backs, and march with\r\n     them into the War Office, Horse Guards, S.W.\"\r\n\r\n  [114] _Roebuck Committee_, Fifth Report, pp. 20, 21.\r\n\r\nThe caravanserai was the large kitchen aforesaid (p. 173). \"From this\r\nroom,\" wrote one of the lady volunteers, \"were distributed quantities of\r\narrowroot, sago, rice puddings, jelly, beef-tea, and lemonade upon\r\nrequisitions made by the surgeons. This caused great comings to and fro;\r\nnumbers of orderlies were waiting at the door with requisitions. One of\r\nthe nuns or a lady received them, and saw they were signed and\r\ncountersigned before serving. We used, among ourselves, to call this\r\nkitchen the tower of Babel. In the middle of the day everything and\r\neverybody seemed to be there: boxes, parcels, bundles of sheets, shirts,\r\nand old linen and flannels, tubs of butter, sugar, bread, kettles,\r\nsaucepans, heaps of books, and of all kinds of rubbish, besides the\r\ndiets which were being dispensed; then the people, ladies, nuns, nurses,\r\norderlies, Turks, Greeks, French and Italian servants, officers and\r\nothers waiting to see Miss Nightingale; all passing to and fro, all\r\nintent upon their own business, and all speaking their own\r\nlanguage.\"[115]\r\n\r\n  [115] _Eastern Hospitals_, vol. i. p. 68.\r\n\r\nThere was also in \"The Sisters' Tower,\" as this part of the Barrack\r\nHospital came to be called, a small sitting-room; and in it \"were held\r\nthose councils over which Miss Nightingale so ably presided, at which\r\nwere discussed the measures necessary to meet the daily-varying\r\nexigencies of the hospital. From hence were given the orders which\r\nregulated the female staff. This, too, was the office from which were\r\nsent those many letters to the Government, to friends and supporters at\r\nhome, telling of the sufferings of the sick and wounded.\"[116] In the\r\nReport of the Duke of Newcastle's Commission, as also in Miss\r\nNightingale's _Statement to Subscribers_, the full list of articles\r\nsupplied by her may be found, tabulated with a precision and amplitude\r\nof detail characteristic of her. It included the miscellaneous utensils,\r\netc., enumerated above, and also various articles of food required for\r\nthe \"extra diets\" mentioned in the preceding chapter. The supplies were\r\nfurnished partly by the _Times_ Fund, partly out of moneys sent to her\r\nby benevolent persons, and partly out of the private purse of herself\r\nand her immediate friends. Much of the expenditure was ultimately\r\nrefunded to her by the Government. The sick and wounded soldiers at\r\nScutari would, I fear, have felt ill requited for the lack of linen,\r\nsheets, utensils, and extra diet by hearing that a beautiful new church\r\nwas being built at Pera.\r\n\r\n  [116] _Scutari and its Hospitals_, by S. G. O., p. 24.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked, were the things which Miss Nightingale procured\r\nand issued really wanted? May they not have been her fads? and was not\r\nhers perhaps a work of supererogation, for could not the official\r\nPurveyor have supplied them? Such statements were widely made at the\r\ntime, and one can readily understand the reason. By drawing upon her own\r\nstores, Miss Nightingale not only furnished the soldiery with the things\r\nthey were needing, but \"administered to the defaulting administrators a\r\ntelling, though silent, rebuke; and it would seem that under this\r\ndiscipline the groove-going men winced in agony, for they uttered\r\ntouching complaints, declaring that the Lady-in-Chief did not choose to\r\ngive them time (it was always time the males wanted), and that the\r\nmoment a want declared itself, she made haste to supply it\r\nherself.\"[117] But such complaints were entirely unfounded; for it was\r\nshown by the Duke of Newcastle's Commission that she never issued\r\nanything from her stores, nor did she allow any one else to do so,\r\nexcept upon the demand of the medical officers, and after inquiry of the\r\nPurveyor if he could supply them. I find among Miss Nightingale's papers\r\na few of the original requisitions from medical officers. Here is one of\r\nthem:--\r\n\r\n     PALACE HOSPITAL, 18_th January_ 1855. MADAM--I have the honor to\r\n     forward a requisition for 50 shirts and 50 warm flannels. The\r\n     Purveyor has none. Knowing the extensive demand, I have limited my\r\n     request to meet the urgent requirements of the most serious cases\r\n     in my charge. I have the honor to be, Madam, your most obedient\r\n     humble servant,\r\n                              EDWARD MENZIES, Staff Surgeon in Charge.\r\n\r\n  [117] Kinglake, p. 430. He cites an example of the complaints in a\r\n        private letter from Sir John Burgoyne to Lord Raglan (March 27,\r\n        1855). The complaint of the \"groove-going men\" has been revived\r\n        in our own day by Lord Stanmore, who complains of Miss Nightingale\r\n        (_Memoir of Sidney Herbert_, vol. i. p. 381) that she got things\r\n        (which the Purveyor had failed to get) instead of informing him\r\n        where they could be got. She acted on what is a golden rule in\r\n        cases of emergency. When she wanted a thing done without delay,\r\n        she did it herself.\r\n\r\nThe list, said the commissioners drily, \"must not be regarded as\r\nconclusive proof that the articles mentioned in it were invariably\r\nwanting in the [Government] stores.\" Goods, they explained, \"have been\r\nrefused, although they were, to our personal knowledge, lying in\r\nabundance in the store of the Purveyor.\" Why refused? Because the\r\nPurveyor took it upon himself to override the requisition of the medical\r\nofficers? Not at all. \"This was done because they had not been examined\r\nby the Board of Survey. On one occasion, in the month of December last\r\n[1854], we found that this was the case with respect to Hospital rugs,\r\nand it is probable that this has not been the only instance of such an\r\noccurrence.\" Miss Nightingale's letters to Mr. Herbert show that it was\r\na frequent occurrence. For instance, in February 1855, she received a\r\nrequisition from the medical officers at Balaclava for shirts. She knew\r\nthat 27,000 shirts had at her instance been sent by Government from\r\nhome, and they were already landed. But the Purveyor would not let them\r\nbe used; \"he could not unpack them without a Board.\" Three weeks elapsed\r\nbefore the Board released the shirts. The sick and wounded, lying\r\nshivering for want of rugs and shirts, would have expressed themselves\r\nforcibly, I fear, if it had been explained that they must shiver still\r\nuntil the Board of Survey's good time had arrived.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's impatience at such delays was the origin, doubtless,\r\nof a story which had wide currency at the time that on one occasion she\r\nordered a Government consignment to be opened forcibly, while the\r\nofficials wrung their hands at the thought of what the Board of Survey\r\nmight presently say. The story was mentioned in the Roebuck Committee;\r\nand, though it was not confirmed, I think that Miss Nightingale was\r\nquite capable of the dreadful deed. Certainly she often insisted on\r\nobtaining first-hand evidence for herself, instead of trusting to the\r\nreport of others; for in one of her letters to Mr. Herbert (Dec. 21,\r\n1854), I find this passage: \"This morning I foraged in the Purveyor's\r\nStore--a cruise I make almost daily, as the only way of getting things.\r\nNo mops, no plates, no wooden trays (the engineer is having these made),\r\nno slippers, no shoe-brushes, no blacking, no knives and forks, no\r\nspoons, no scissors (for cutting the men's hair, which is literally\r\nalive), no basins, no towelling, no chloride of zinc.\" Then she\r\nenumerates the things which Mr. Herbert should send from London, adding,\r\n\"The other articles mentioned above as not now in store can be had at\r\nConstantinople\" or Marseilles; whence, I imagine, she proceeded to get\r\nthem. Shopping at Scutari was not an afternoon's easy amusement:--\r\n\r\n     \"English people,\" she wrote to Mr. Herbert (Dec. 10), \"look upon\r\n     Scutari as a place with inns and hackney-coaches, and houses to let\r\n     furnished. It required yesterday, to land 25 casks of sugar, four\r\n     oxen and two men for six hours, plus two passes, two requisitions,\r\n     Mr. Bracebridge's two interferences, and one apology from a\r\n     quarter-master for seizing the _araba_, received with a smile and a\r\n     kind word, because he did his duty; for every _araba_ is required\r\n     on Military store or Commissariat duty. There are no pack-horses\r\n     and no asses, except those used by the peasantry to attend the\r\n     market 1-1/4 miles off. An _araba_ consists of loose poles and planks,\r\n     extended between two axle-trees, placed on four small wheels, and\r\n     drawn by a yoke of weak oxen.... Four days in the week we cannot\r\n     communicate with Constantinople, except by the other harbour,\r\n     1-1/4 miles off, to which the road is almost impassable.\"\r\n\r\nBut, somehow or other, Miss Nightingale was able to supply from her\r\nstores in hand, or to obtain from Constantinople or Smyrna or elsewhere,\r\nmany things which the Purveyor-General could not, or would not, obtain.\r\nShe had the forethought, as already related, to lay in at Marseilles on\r\nher way out a large supply of articles which she deemed likely to be\r\nuseful; and at Scutari Mr. Macdonald of the _Times_ was untiring and\r\nresourceful. In the course of time, as funds continued to pour in, and\r\nthe Government purveying became more efficient, Miss Nightingale was\r\nable on emergency to supply, not only the British, but their allies. In\r\nthe spring of 1856, when the scourge of typhus committed sad ravages\r\namong the French, and the _amour propre_ of the _Intendance_ prevented\r\nthe acceptance of the humane offer of medical comforts as a loan from\r\nthe British Government, Miss Nightingale paved the way in overcoming\r\nthis scruple by sending, as a present to the French Sisters and Medical\r\nOfficers, large quantities of wine, arrowroot, and meat-essence. The\r\nSardinian Sisters of Mercy also experienced much kindness at her hands\r\nwhen the destruction of a supply-ship by fire had left them without many\r\nthings needed by their patients. She sent supplies also to the Prussian\r\nCivil Hospital, where many Britishers were treated; for this good office\r\nshe received a letter of thanks from the king of Prussia (Sept. 1856).\r\nTo her quarters at Scutari, the Turks, too, often resorted for medicine\r\nand advice. In her, says an eye-witness, the sickly and needy of all\r\nnations found an active friend.[118] \"She embraced in her solicitude,\"\r\nsaid a French historian of the Crimean War, \"the sick of three\r\narmies.\"[119]\r\n\r\n  [118] _Pincoffs_, pp. 82-83; and see _Hall_, p. 378.\r\n\r\n  [119] _La Guerre de Crimée_, by M. L. Baudens, p. 104. Miss Nightingale\r\n        paid a tribute to the \"wise and enlightened sanitary views\" of\r\n        M. Baudens. See her _Subsidiary Notes_, p. 133 _n._\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's initiative was further useful in extracting needed\r\narticles which were contained in the Government store, but yet had not\r\nbeen forthcoming, either because nobody else had asked for them, or\r\nbecause somebody had not been lucky enough to hit upon the right moment\r\nfor asking. The system in force was most ingeniously contrived to bring\r\nabout such a state of things. Articles were only supplied to the\r\nhospitals by the Purveyor on the requisition of a medical officer. The\r\nmedical officers were overburdened with work, and perhaps omitted to\r\nsend in a requisition. Or they sent in a requisition, and the form was\r\nreturned, marked \"None in store.\" The articles may subsequently have\r\nbeen obtained or have arrived from England, but no note was kept in the\r\nPurveying Department of unfulfilled requisitions, and unless the medical\r\nofficers requisitioned again, the articles were not supplied. The\r\nCommissioners found that from this cause patients were sometimes left\r\nwithout beds, though there were bedsteads in store at the time. Happily\r\nMiss Nightingale had laid in a good many at Marseilles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThere was another sphere in which Miss Nightingale came to the rescue of\r\nthe sick and wounded from the blunders of official administration. She\r\nclothed them, 50,000 shirts in all having been issued from her store.\r\nThe history of this private clothing department is curious. The\r\nregulations of the War Office assumed that every soldier brought with\r\nhim into hospital an adequate kit, and it was no part of the Purveyor's\r\nduty to supply such a thing as a shirt. But three of the four generals\r\nof division in the Crimea had decided not to disembark the men's\r\nknapsacks. Sebastopol, it was confidently expected, would fall in a few\r\ndays' time, and the men were to march light. In most cases they never\r\nsaw their knapsacks again.[120] Hence the sick and wounded who arrived\r\nat Scutari immediately after the Battle of the Alma were destitute of\r\nall clothing except what was on their persons, and that was in many\r\ncases fit only for the furnace. No regulation existed whereby, if the\r\nsoldier had for military reasons been deprived of his kit, the\r\ndeficiency could be made good. The supply of a change of linen for the\r\nsick and wounded while in hospital, and of clean shirts to wear when\r\ninvalided home or returned to the front, was perhaps a better allocation\r\nof benevolent funds than a supply of altar-cloths for a new church at\r\nPera. At any rate Miss Nightingale thought so; and thus she and her\r\ncoadjutors were in some measure the clothiers as well as the purveyors\r\nof the wounded soldiers.\r\n\r\n  [120] For a reference to this matter by Miss Nightingale, see below,\r\n        p. 224.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale assumed responsibility on one occasion as a builder,\r\nand this was at the time the usurpation which was most condemned in some\r\nquarters and the most commended in others. Some wards in the Barrack\r\nHospital were in so dilapidated a condition as to be unfit for the\r\nreception of patients. The Commander-in-Chief had warned the hospital\r\nauthorities that additional sick and wounded might shortly be upon their\r\nhands. The uninhabited wards might by prompt expenditure be made capable\r\nof accommodating 800 cases. The expenditure, however, would be\r\nconsiderable, and no one seemed willing to incur it without superior\r\nauthority. Miss Nightingale stepped into the breach. With the\r\nconcurrence of Dr. McGrigor, a senior medical officer of the hospital,\r\nshe represented the urgency of the case to Lady Stratford de Redcliffe.\r\nThe Ambassador had been empowered, as we have seen, to incur\r\nexpenditure; and his wife, as she had given Miss Nightingale to\r\nunderstand, was the authorized intermediary between the Ambassador and\r\nthe authorities of the hospitals. Lady Stratford saw the urgent\r\nnecessity of the work, and Mr. Gordon, the chief of the engineering\r\nstaff, was instructed to put it immediately in hand. The workmen, 125 in\r\nnumber, presently struck, whereupon Miss Nightingale, on her own\r\nauthority, succeeded in engaging 200 other workmen, and the work was\r\nrapidly completed. Lord Stratford subsequently disclaimed any\r\nresponsibility,[121] and Miss Nightingale paid the bill out of her own\r\nprivate resources. The War Department, when the affair came to their\r\nknowledge, approved her action, and reimbursed her. This instance of\r\n\"the Nightingale power\" made a great impression, and she herself\r\nregarded it as the most beneficent thing she did in the East. The fame\r\nof the affair was noised abroad, and reached the British camp at\r\nBalaclava, where our unfailing friend, Colonel Sterling, heard of it\r\nwith hot indignation. Miss Nightingale, he wrote, \"coolly draws a\r\ncheque. Is this the way to manage the finances of a great nation? _Vox\r\npopuli_? A divine afflatus. Priestess, Miss N. Magnetic impetus drawing\r\ncash out of my pocket!\" In normal times it would certainly not be the\r\nway to manage the finances of a great nation. And even in times of\r\nemergency the way which would of course have occurred to any\r\nwell-regulated slave of routine was that Miss Nightingale should have\r\nspoken to some officer on the spot, that he should have represented the\r\ncase to the Director-General of the Army Medical Department in London,\r\nthat the Director-General should have moved the Horse Guards, and the\r\nHorse Guards the Ordnance, that the Ordnance should then have approached\r\nthe Treasury, and that after process of minuting and countersigning, the\r\nwork should in due course have been officially ordered. But meanwhile\r\nLord Raglan's wounded would have arrived at the hospital, and there\r\nwould have been no wards ready to receive them. As it was, \"the wards\r\nwere ready,\" as Miss Nightingale reported to Mr. Herbert (Dec. 21), \"to\r\nreceive 500 men on the 19th from the ships _Ripon_ and _Golden Fleece_.\r\nThey were received in the wards by Dr. McGrigor and myself, and were\r\ngenerally in the last stage of exhaustion. I supplied all the utensils,\r\nincluding knives and forks, spoons, cans, towels, etc., clearing our\r\nquarters of these.\"\r\n\r\n  [121] My statements are based on a letter from Miss Nightingale to\r\n        Mr. Sidney Herbert of Dec. 5, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nIn all these things Miss Nightingale may be warmly commended, but the\r\nofficials need not be too hotly condemned. They were but doing their\r\nduty, as they had learnt it; and for the rest, it was the system, or\r\nwant of system, that was at fault. Just as in London there was no\r\nco-ordination among the Departments, so at Scutari there was no unity of\r\naction, and no clear personal responsibility. \"It is a current joke\r\nhere,\" wrote Miss Nightingale from Scutari, \"to offer a prize for the\r\ndiscovery of any one willing to take responsibility.\" It was never\r\nawarded, for Miss Nightingale herself was, I suppose, \"barred.\" In\r\nwriting to Mr. Herbert, she called many of the officials at Scutari by\r\nvery hard names, but in other letters she admitted that the ultimate\r\nfault lay elsewhere. \"The grand administrative evil,\" she said (Dec.\r\n10), \"emanates from home--in the existence of a number of departments\r\nhere, each with its centrifugal and independent action, uncounteracted\r\nby any centripetal attraction, viz. a central authority capable of\r\nsupervising and compelling combined effort for each object at each\r\nparticular time.\" Mr. Herbert might write, but the officials would not\r\nact. The force of custom was too strong. Miss Nightingale showed the\r\nPurveyor a letter from the Minister. \"This is the first time,\" he said,\r\n\"I have had it in writing that I was not to spare expense. I never knew\r\nthat I might not be thrown overboard.\" \"Your name,\" she had told Mr.\r\nHerbert (Nov. 25), \"is continually used as a bug-bear. They make a deity\r\nof cheapness, and the Secretary at War stands as synonymous here with\r\nJupiter Tonans, whose shafts end only in a _brutum fulmen_. The\r\ncheese-paring system, which sounds unmusical in British ears, is here\r\nidentified with you by the officers who carry it out. It is in vain to\r\ntell the Purveyors that they will get no _kudos_ by this at home.\"\r\n\r\nIt should not be supposed, however, that Miss Nightingale was a spurner\r\nof rules, and a despiser of discipline, routine, and subordination. The\r\nvery reverse is the case. Her whole career makes it probable, the\r\ncharacter of her mind suggests it, and the administration of the funds\r\nplaced at her disposal, with which the present chapter has mainly been\r\nconcerned, proves it. If she shocked and staggered some official minds\r\nby her daring innovations, it was her strictness and insistence upon\r\nrules and regulations that was most criticized in unofficial quarters.\r\nShe explained the matter very clearly in her final _Statement to\r\nSubscribers_. She had been placed by the Government in two positions of\r\ntrust, each independent of the other. She had been appointed\r\nsuperintendent of the nursing establishment; and she further had\r\nreceived authority, as almoner of the \"Free Gifts\" (as the Royal Bounty\r\nwas called), to apply them, and any other gifts derived from private\r\nsources, in the War Hospitals. In the second of these capacities, she\r\ncould, if she had chosen, have administered her stores solely at her\r\npersonal discretion, and have delegated a like discretion to other\r\nsuperintendents, sisters, or nurses appointed by her. But, except in a\r\nfew special cases, which it were superfluous to enumerate, she rejected\r\nthe liberty of personal discretion, and administered her funds only upon\r\nthe requisition of medical officers. (She lays repeated stress on this\r\nfact, but I daresay that she herself was often the originating source of\r\nthe requisitions. We have seen that in Harley Street she had learnt the\r\nart of managing overworked doctors.) Her statement of the reasons which\r\ngoverned her action is characteristic of her good sense. The exercise of\r\npersonal discretion alone would have been the easier course; but the\r\nobjections to it were \"the abrogation of ordinary rule; the\r\nimpossibility of preventing irregular issues, or at least of disproving\r\nthe charge, and the unfitness of a large proportion of the women, who\r\nefficiently discharge the duty of the Nurses, to be the judges of the\r\nwants of soldiers and distribution of supplies to them; and, farther,\r\nthe abuse which some would undoubtedly make of the power. To those to\r\nwhom the charge of dishonesty would not apply, religious partiality\r\neither would, or, what in matters of this kind is only less mischievous,\r\nwould be believed to, apply.\" Next, there was the danger of patients\r\nbeing given other food than what the medical officers ordered. \"It is\r\nneedless to state to any sensible person, even without hospital\r\nexperience, the manifold dangers of issuing to Nurses, whether 'Ladies,\r\nSisters, or Nurses,' stores or facilities for procuring stores, to be\r\ndistributed at their own discretion through the Wards. It is to be\r\nremembered that the employment of women in Army Hospitals is recent,\r\nthat many experienced and able Surgeons are opposed to it, that, among\r\nthese, some are honestly, and some are unscrupulously prone to find\r\nobjections to it, and to exaggerate mischiefs arising from it; that the\r\nSurgeon can, to a considerable extent, allow the Nurse to be useful, or\r\nforce her to be comparatively useless, in his Wards; that the War\r\nHospitals are a bad field for investing the Nurse with powers and\r\noffices which she never exercises in Civil Hospitals. On these grounds,\r\nas strict an adherence to existing rules as was possible appeared to be\r\nthe only course.... Miss Nightingale exacted and she rendered adherence\r\nto rules to a large extent, and she strictly reverted to them when any\r\nemergency, during which, at the instance of authorities, she had\r\ndeparted from them, had ceased. A position such as hers necessarily\r\nexposes the holder to attacks from different quarters upon opposite\r\ngrounds. While previously existing authorities are disposed to complain\r\nof all novel expenditure as lavish, and tending to the relaxation of\r\ndiscipline by over-indulgence, others, who feel themselves checked or\r\nrestrained by regulations in the distribution of comforts according to\r\ntheir ideas of benevolence, will naturally object to the obstruction, in\r\ntheir view unnecessarily, interposed to the current of public\r\nliberality. While the experience of all who have conducted the\r\noperations of any extensive charity proves that the application of the\r\nordinary axioms of business is the only road to success, it also\r\nsufficiently shows that such application is surely attended by no small\r\nmeasure of unpopularity.\"[122]\r\n\r\n  [122] _Statement_, pp. 19, 26. How greatly Miss Nightingale's strict\r\n        rules were resented is shown by attacks upon her administration\r\n        printed by certain of Miss Stanley's nurses. The most bitter of\r\n        these is to be found in the text and appendix of _The Autobiography\r\n        of a Balaclava Nurse_, 1857 (No. 13, Bibliography B). See also\r\n        _Eastern Hospitals_, 3rd ed., pp. 44-5, 52-3.\r\n\r\nShe saw the value of rules, and respected them, sometimes even when they\r\nwere ridiculous. On a cold night in January 1856, she was by the bedside\r\nof a dying patient; whose feet she found to be stone cold. She requested\r\nan orderly to fetch a hot-water bottle immediately. He refused, on the\r\nground that his instructions were to do nothing for a patient without\r\ndirections from a medical officer. Miss Nightingale stood corrected, and\r\ntrudged off to find a doctor and make requisition for the bottle in due\r\nform. On a night in the following month, there was an unusually cold\r\neast wind, with a heavy snowfall. The patients in the ward attended by a\r\ncivilian doctor were exposed to the wind and complained bitterly of the\r\ncold, but the regulation supply of fuel had given out. As the Government\r\nstore was closed, Miss Nightingale waived the rule about applying first\r\nto the Purveyor, and gave the doctor fuel from her private stores. Next\r\nday the civilian doctor requisitioned in due form for an extra supply of\r\nfuel. He was refused. He carried his case to the Inspector-General. That\r\nofficial pleaded that he could not depart from the regulations which\r\nallowed only a certain quantity of wood for each stove. But, urged the\r\ncivilian, exceptional cold calls for an extra allowance. Possibly,\r\nreplied the Inspector-General with exemplary gravity, but \"a Board must\r\nfirst sit\" upon the question. The civilian smiled good-humouredly, and\r\nbegged the great man to supply the wood first, and let the Board sit\r\nupon it when the weather was milder. The Inspector-General consented.\r\nThese little incidents[123] throw a flood of light upon the difficulties\r\nthrough which Miss Nightingale had to thread her way. She was a firm\r\nbeliever in rules; but she was one of those able administrators who have\r\nthe sense to know, and the courage to act upon the knowledge, that rules\r\nsometimes exist only to be broken.\r\n\r\n  [123] I take them from _Pincoffs_, pp. 58, 79.\r\n\r\nAnd this was precisely the kind of initiative that the state of things\r\nin the hospitals at Scutari demanded. Miss Nightingale's adherence to\r\nrules may have brought unpopularity upon her from some of her\r\nsubordinates or subscribers; but her departure from rules, on due cause\r\nof emergency, and her cutting of knots--perhaps even her breaking open\r\nof consignments--brought from her official superior, Mr. Sidney Herbert,\r\nnothing but commendation and support. One sees this sometimes in his\r\nletters to herself, sometimes in those which he addressed to others, and\r\nwhich reflect the impression made upon him by her vigour and resource.\r\n\"Pray recollect,\" he wrote to the senior medical officer (Dec. 1, 1854),\r\n\"in your demands upon us here, whether for more men, more comforts, or\r\nmore necessaries, that there is no question of pounds, shillings and\r\npence in such matters, but that whatever can be got _must_ be got.\" And\r\nto the Purveyor-General he wrote: \"This is not a moment for sticking at\r\nforms, but for facilitating the rapid and easy transaction of business.\r\nThere is much mischief done to the public service by the stickling for\r\nprecedence and dignity between departments.\" Thus he wrote to many\r\nothers also; but he confessed to Mr. Bracebridge that he had \"small\r\nhopes of these men. I have been writing in this sense before, and in\r\nvain; but I trust there is some improvement. They are so saturated with\r\nthe cheese-paring economy of forty years' peace, that there is no\r\ngetting them to act up to a great occasion.\"[124] Miss Nightingale's\r\ninitiative alone saved the situation.\r\n\r\n  [124] _Memoir of Sidney Herbert_, vol. i. pp. 357, 360. It will be\r\n        noticed that he adopts some of Miss Nightingale's expressions.\r\n\r\nI have in this chapter separated various illustrations of that\r\ninitiative from others which, in the preceding chapter, were attributed\r\nto \"the woman's insight.\" But perhaps the separation, though convenient,\r\nis imaginary, and all the cases of Miss Nightingale's administrative\r\nenergy are ascribable to the same cause. Such was Mr. Kinglake's\r\nopinion; yet I have always suspected that the exceeding prominence given\r\nby him to the woman's touch in Miss Nightingale's work may in part have\r\nbeen caused by a desire to heighten the contrasts, and to barb with\r\ndeadlier point his brilliant satire upon incompetence in official\r\nplaces. Let those who believe that it is possible to make a sharp\r\ndelimitation between the \"masculine\" and the \"feminine mind\" settle this\r\nmatter as they may. It seems to me that as there are old women of both\r\nsexes, so in both sexes there are men of business. My object in this\r\nchapter has been to show that Miss Nightingale brought to bear upon the\r\ntask which confronted her at Scutari those high powers of the\r\nadministrative mind, be they masculine or feminine, which, in moments of\r\nemergency, are capable of resource, initiative, decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                               THE REFORMER\r\n\r\n\r\n     We have made Miss Nightingale's acquaintance, and are delighted and\r\n     very much struck by her great gentleness and simplicity, and\r\n     wonderful, clear, and comprehensive head. I wish we had her at the\r\n     War Office.--QUEEN VICTORIA (Letter to the Duke of Cambridge,\r\n     1856).\r\n\r\n\"When one reads such twaddling nonsense,\" wrote Dr. Hall in November\r\n1855 from the Crimea to Dr. Andrew Smith in London, \"as that uttered by\r\nMr. Bracebridge, and which was so much lauded in the _Times_ because the\r\ngarrulous old gentleman talked about Miss Nightingale putting hospitals,\r\ncontaining three or four thousand patients, in order in a couple of days\r\nby means of the _Times_ funds, one cannot suppress a feeling of contempt\r\nfor the man who indulges in such exaggerations, and pity for the\r\nignorant multitude who are deluded by these fairy tales.\"[125] The\r\ncontempt and pity of the Inspector-General of the hospitals in the East\r\nwere not unmixed, I think we may surmise, with a good deal of anger,\r\nwhich, we may also surmise, was shared by his friend, the\r\nDirector-General of the Medical Department in London. Such feelings were\r\nin the course of human nature, and the exaggeration in the statements\r\ncited by Dr. Hall is palpable. Miss Nightingale was not a magician. It\r\nwould be an idle fairy tale to represent that by her exertions, either\r\nin a couple of days, or a couple of months, she effected a complete\r\ntransformation scene. And it would be unfair to attribute solely to Miss\r\nNightingale the gradual improvements which, though largely due to her\r\ninitiative and resource (as described in preceding chapters), were in\r\nfact the result of the exertions of many persons both at home and in the\r\nEast. \"I have an unbounded admiration of Miss Nightingale's\r\nqualifications,\" said a deputy medical inspector, \"and of the manner she\r\napplies them, but I see dozens of things placed to her credit which I\r\nhappen to know she had nothing to do with.\"[126] Such was doubtless the\r\ncase. Yet though in one sense Dr. Hall was perfectly right, in another\r\nhe was profoundly wrong. Neither he, however, nor any of the other\r\nmedical men who shared his views, need be blamed for their\r\nmisapprehension. The facts of the case can only be fully understood now\r\nthat access is obtainable to the private correspondence of Miss\r\nNightingale and other actors in the drama.\r\n\r\n  [125] _Life and Letters of Sir John Hall_, p. 403, where \"Bracebridge\"\r\n        is misprinted \"Bainbridge.\"\r\n\r\n  [126] _Roebuck Committee_, Second Report, p. 723.\r\n\r\nShe did many things herself, but she was also the inspirer and\r\ninstigator of more things which were done by others. She was able of her\r\nown initiative to institute considerable reforms; but she was a reformer\r\non a larger scale through the influence which she exercised. Though she\r\nwas in truth no magician, there were men on the spot who, not being able\r\nto understand the secret and sources of her power, seemed to find\r\nsomething uncanny in it. Our good friend, Colonel Sterling, who hated\r\nthe intrusion of petticoats into a campaign, was very much puzzled. The\r\nthing seemed to him \"ludicrous,\" as we have heard, but he had to admit\r\nthat \"Miss Nightingale queens it with absolute power\"; and elsewhere he\r\nspeaks of \"the Nightingale power\" as something mysterious and\r\n\"fabulous.\" The secret, however, is simple. \"The Nightingale power\" was\r\ndue to causes of which some were inherent in herself and others were\r\nadventitious. The inherent strength of her influence lay in the\r\nmasterful will and practical good sense which gave her dominion over the\r\nminds of men. The adventitious sources of her power were that she had\r\nboth the ear and the confidence of Ministers, and the interest and\r\nsympathy of the Court. I have called this accession of influence\r\n\"adventitious,\" but it also accrued to her, in a secondary degree, from\r\nthe inherent force of her character.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Court in strengthening, in speeding up, and\r\nsometimes in chiding Ministers, especially in military matters, was,\r\nduring the reign of Victoria, very great, as all readers of memoirs of\r\nthe time are aware.[127] And from an early period of Miss Nightingale's\r\nmission the Court had expressed a lively interest in it, and had\r\nintimated a wish that full consideration should be paid to her\r\nexperiences and impressions. \"Would you tell Mrs. Herbert,\" wrote the\r\nQueen to Mr. Sidney Herbert (Dec. 6, 1854), \"that I beg she would let me\r\nsee frequently the accounts she receives from Miss Nightingale or Mrs.\r\nBracebridge, as _I hear no details of the wounded_, though I see so many\r\nfrom officers, etc., about the battlefield, and naturally the former\r\nmust interest _me_ more than any one. Let Mrs. Herbert also know that I\r\nwish Miss Nightingale and the ladies would tell these poor, noble\r\nwounded and sick men that _no one_ takes a warmer interest or feels\r\n_more_ for their sufferings or admires their courage and heroism _more_\r\nthan their Queen. Day and night she thinks of her beloved troops. So\r\ndoes the Prince. Beg Mrs. Herbert to communicate these my words to those\r\nladies, as I know that _our_ sympathy is much valued by these noble\r\nfellows.\" Upon the receipt of the Queen's message, the chaplain went\r\nthrough the wards reading it to the men, and copies of it were also\r\nposted on the walls of the several hospitals. \"The men were touched,\"\r\nMiss Nightingale reported to Mr. Herbert (Dec. 25). \"'It is a very\r\nfeeling letter,' they said. 'She thinks of us' (said with tears). 'Each\r\nman of us ought to have a copy which we will keep till our dying day.'\r\n'To think of her thinking of us,' said another; 'I only wish I could go\r\nand fight for her again.'\" The Queen's message was followed by more\r\nsubstantial proof of Her Majesty's interest, and here again Miss\r\nNightingale was made the intermediary between the throne and the\r\nsoldiers. Through Mr. Sidney Herbert, the Queen had ascertained from\r\nMiss Nightingale the kind of comforts which would be useful to the\r\nwounded, and the following letter was sent to her by the Keeper of the\r\nQueen's Purse:--\r\n\r\n     WINDSOR CASTLE, _December_ 14 [1854]. MADAM--I have received the\r\n     commands of Her Majesty the Queen to forward by the ship _Eagle_\r\n     some packages containing some comforts and useful articles which\r\n     Her Majesty wishes to be placed in your hands for distribution, as\r\n     you may think fit, amongst the wounded and sick at Scutari.\r\n\r\n     Her Majesty has wished to mark by some private contribution from\r\n     herself her deep personal sympathy for the sufferings of these\r\n     noble soldiers, and her admiration of the patience and fortitude\r\n     with which they have suffered both wounds and hardships.\r\n\r\n     The Queen has directed me to ask you to undertake the distribution\r\n     and application of these articles, partly because Her Majesty\r\n     wished you to be made aware that your goodness and self-devotion in\r\n     giving yourself up to the soothing attendance upon these wounded\r\n     and sick soldiers had been observed by the Queen with sentiments of\r\n     the highest approval and admiration; and partly because, as the\r\n     articles sent did not come within the description of Medical or\r\n     Government stores, usually furnished, they could not be better\r\n     entrusted than to one who, by constant personal observation, would\r\n     form a correct judgment where they would be most usefully employed.\r\n\r\n  [127] The classical passage in this sense is in the _Life and\r\n        Correspondence of the Rt. Hon. Hugh C. E. Childers_, 1901,\r\n        vol. ii. p. 104, where it is said, in relation to the Egyptian\r\n        Expedition of 1882: \"The Queen with her well-known solicitude for\r\n        the welfare of her Army, wrote many letters at this time to\r\n        Mr. Childers to satisfy herself that all precautions were being\r\n        taken for the health and comfort of the troops: one day alone\r\n        brought seventeen letters from Her Majesty, or her private\r\n        secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen sent presents of warm scarves and the like to Miss\r\nNightingale's nurses. The position of Almoner of the Free Gifts and the\r\nconfidence thus shown by the Sovereign greatly extended the prestige of\r\nMiss Nightingale, who was already known to command influence with the\r\nGovernment, to have the favour of the Press, and to be the darling of\r\npopular opinion. Officials might feel sore, and old fogeys might\r\ngrumble, but the fact became palpable that \"the Nightingale power\" had\r\nto be reckoned with.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nIt was, however, behind the scenes that Miss Nightingale's activity as a\r\nreformer was most powerfully exercised. In accordance with Her Majesty's\r\ncommand, reports from Miss Nightingale were forwarded to the Queen, and\r\nby her were sent on to the Duke of Newcastle. The Duke, writing to the\r\nQueen on December 22, 1854, assured Her Majesty that the condition of\r\nthe Hospitals at Scutari, and the entire want of all method and\r\narrangement in everything which concerns the comfort of the army, were\r\nsubjects of constant and most painful anxiety to him. \"Nothing can be\r\nmore just,\" he added, \"than all your Majesty's comments upon the state\r\nof facts exhibited by these letters, and the Duke of Newcastle has\r\nrepeatedly, during the last two months, written in the strongest terms\r\nrespecting them--but hitherto without avail, and with little other\r\nresult than a denial of charges, the truth of which must now be\r\nconsidered to be substantiated.\"[128] It remained for Ministers to do\r\nwhat was possible to remedy the evils.\r\n\r\n  [128] _The Letters of Queen Victoria_, vol. iii. p. 79.\r\n\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert, who (as already stated) had relieved the Duke of\r\nNewcastle of hospital matters, needed no compulsion to zeal, and Miss\r\nNightingale's letters to him showed in what directions his zeal could\r\nmost usefully be employed. The Government of Lord Aberdeen, defeated on\r\nthe motion appointing the Roebuck Committee, resigned in January 1855,\r\nand Lord Palmerston became Prime Minister. The offices of Secretary\r\n_for_ War and Secretary _at_ War were amalgamated, and Lord Panmure\r\nbecame Secretary of State in place of the Duke of Newcastle. Mr. Herbert\r\nbecame for a short time Secretary of State for the Colonies, and then\r\nresigned. But Mr. Herbert begged Miss Nightingale to continue writing to\r\nhim, promising to forward her representations to the proper quarters.\r\nLord Palmerston knew her personally, and Lord Panmure paid deference to\r\nher wishes and opinions, so that the change of Government did not weaken\r\nher position. I have before me copies of a long series of letters\r\naddressed by Miss Nightingale to Mr. Herbert between November 1854 and\r\nMay 1855. He had given her private instructions that she was to act as\r\neye and ear for him in the East. Of her letters a few were printed by\r\nLord Stanmore in his _Memoir of Sidney Herbert_, where also a series of\r\nMr. Herbert's letters, both to her and to various officials concerned,\r\nis given. A comparison of the one set with the other shows very clearly\r\nhow much of the improvements which the Government of Lord Aberdeen and\r\nits successor were able to effect was due to the suggestions, the\r\nremonstrances, the entreaties of Miss Nightingale. Her letters are\r\nwritten with complete freedom and often in great haste. It would be\r\npossible to make isolated extracts from them which would suggest that\r\nthe writer was a censorious and uncharitable scold. But such a selection\r\nwould convey a misleading impression. Miss Nightingale wrote\r\nunreservedly about individuals, because she saw, as Mr. Herbert himself\r\nsaw also, that the _personnel_ was at fault, and that the most admirable\r\ninstructions from home would be useless unless there were men of some\r\ninitiative and vigour to carry them out on the spot. She wrote in anger,\r\nbecause she saw, what Mr. Herbert soon came to know, that such men were\r\nnot forthcoming. \"I write all this savagery,\" she said (March 5, 1855),\r\n\"because of the non-success of your unwearied efforts for the good of\r\nthese poor Hospitals.\" And then something must be allowed to the caustic\r\nhumour which, when Miss Nightingale had a pen in her hand, could not be\r\ndenied. \"I shall make no further remark about him,\" she writes of a\r\ncertain individual, \"than that he is a fossil of the pure Old Red\r\nSandstone.\" \"Some newspaper has said of me,\" she writes on another\r\noccasion, \"that I am the fourth woman (query, Old Woman) that has had to\r\ndo with the war. Who are the other three?\" And she goes on for Mr.\r\nHerbert's amusement to nominate three of his principal subordinates for\r\nthe distinction. It would argue a lack of humour to take such epistolary\r\ndiversions with no grain of salt. But I do not propose to follow the\r\nexample of a previous writer, who has had access to these letters, in\r\nrecording Miss Nightingale's remarks on individuals. I desire rather to\r\nillustrate from the letters, and from other sources, first, the\r\npractical contributions to reform which Miss Nightingale made in some\r\nmatters of detail, and then her firm grasp of the large principles of\r\nsound administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale performed the duties, as we have seen, of a Purveyor to\r\nthe sick and wounded portion of the British army. The duty was assumed\r\nby her only because the home authorities had been deficient in\r\nforesight, or the authorities on the spot were inefficient and hampered\r\nby official restrictions. Hence her earlier letters to Mr. Herbert were\r\nlargely filled with urgent suggestions for the sending of Government\r\nstores. She begs for \"hair mattresses, or even flock, as cheaper.\" The\r\nFrench hospitals were furnished throughout with hair mattresses; the\r\nBritish soldier was suffering terribly from bed-sores. She pleads for\r\nknives and forks: \"the men have to tear their meat like wild beasts.\"\r\nShe suggests mops, plates, dishes, towelling, disinfectants, and so\r\nforth,--obvious requirements, no doubt, but, as Mr. Herbert said, the\r\nresponsible authorities seem to have shrunk sometimes from making\r\nrequisitions lest they should thereby confess the inadequacy of their\r\npreparations. It was Miss Nightingale, again, who suggested the need of\r\ncarpenters to do odd jobs in the vast and imperfectly equipped Turkish\r\nbuildings which served for the British hospitals. She expressed herself\r\nmost gratefully for an \"invaluable reinforcement\" of them which Mr.\r\nHerbert had sent out; but their arrival necessitated a depletion in one\r\ndepartment of her private stores. \"These men,\" she wrote (Feb. 19,\r\n1855), \"I had to find with knives, forks, and spoons, in default of the\r\nPurveyor, who besides would not provide them with rations unless the\r\nOfficer of Engineers wrote 'urgent' and asked it 'as a favour.'\"\r\n\r\nSome building operations, Miss Nightingale, as we have seen, took it\r\nupon herself to carry out; and some sanitary reforms she was able, by\r\nher personal influence with the orderlies, to effect.[129] \"The\r\ninstruction of the Orderlies in their business was,\" she said,[130] \"one\r\nof the main uses of us in the War Hospitals.\" Other sanitary engineering\r\nworks, on a larger scale, were ultimately carried out, thanks in part to\r\nher urgent and detailed representations to the authorities at home. She\r\nhad pointed out repeatedly to them that the mere issuing of orders was\r\ninsufficient; it was essential that executive powers should be placed in\r\nthe hands of officials directly responsible for immediate action. When\r\nthe Government was reconstituted after the fall of Lord Aberdeen, with\r\nLord Panmure as Secretary for War, this lesson was taken faithfully to\r\nheart, and a Commission of Three--Dr. John Sutherland, Dr. Hector\r\nGavin, and Mr. Robert Rawlinson, C.E.--was sent out to the East with\r\nfull executive powers. They received their instructions on February 19,\r\n1855, and within three days they sailed. \"The tone of the instructions,\"\r\nsays Kinglake, \"is peculiar, and such as to make one believe that they\r\nowed much to feminine impulsion. The diction of the orders is such that,\r\nin housekeeper's language, it may be said to have 'bustled the\r\nservants.'\" The credit for the bustling at home belongs, however, to\r\nLord Shaftesbury, who had pressed the appointment of the\r\nCommissioners upon Lord Panmure, and who was employed to draft their\r\ninstructions.[131] The duties of these Sanitary Commissioners were laid\r\ndown with a minuteness of detail which Miss Nightingale herself could\r\nnot have excelled; and they were then told that \"the utmost expedition\r\nmust be used in the execution of all that is necessary at the place of\r\nyour destination. It is important that you be deeply impressed with the\r\nnecessity of not resting content with an order, but that you see\r\ninstantly, by yourselves or your agents, to the commencement of the work\r\nand to its superintendence day by day until it is finished.\"[132] It is\r\nfrom the Report of the Sanitary Commissioners that I drew many of the\r\nstatements about the condition of the hospitals given in an earlier\r\nchapter. They set about the work of sanitary engineering with great\r\ndispatch, and the death-rate in the hospitals fell, as the result of\r\ntheir reforms, with remarkable rapidity.[133] \"The sanitary conditions\r\nof the hospitals of Scutari,\" Miss Nightingale told the Royal Commission\r\nof 1857, \"were inferior in point of crowding, ventilation, drainage, and\r\ncleanliness, up to the middle of March 1855, to any civil hospital, or\r\nto the poorest homes of the worst parts of the civil population of any\r\nlarge town that I have ever seen. After the sanitary works undertaken at\r\nthat date were executed (June), I know no buildings in the world which I\r\ncould compare with them in these points, the original defects of\r\nconstruction of course excepted.\" It was this Commission, as Miss\r\nNightingale said afterwards to Lord Shaftesbury, that \"saved the\r\nBritish Army.\" In Dr. Sutherland, the head of the Sanitary Commission,\r\nMiss Nightingale found a warm admirer and a stout supporter. During his\r\nstay at Scutari he acted as her physician. On her return to England she\r\nwas on terms of intimate friendship with him and his wife; and Dr.\r\nSutherland was, as we shall hear, one of her close allies in the battle\r\nfor reform in army hygiene. With Mr. (afterwards Sir Robert) Rawlinson\r\nshe also formed a friendship which lasted to the end of his life. Dr.\r\nGavin died in the Crimea during the work of the Commission.\r\n\r\n  [129] See, on these two points, above, p. 206, and below, p. 242.\r\n\r\n  [130] In a letter to Colonel Lefroy, Aug. 25, 1856.\r\n\r\n  [131] Hodder's _Life of Lord Shaftesbury_, pp. 503 _seq_.\r\n\r\n  [132] _Report of the Sanitary Commission_, March 1857.\r\n\r\n  [133] For the figures, see below, pp. 254, 314.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of stores, whatever suggestions or requisitions Miss\r\nNightingale sent home were complied with by Government. But it was one\r\nthing to send stores out, and quite another to secure that they should\r\narrive when and where they were wanted. \"Sidney,\" wrote Mrs. Herbert to\r\nMrs. Bracebridge (Nov. 17, '54), \"has sent heaps of armchairs, etnas,\r\nand other comforts, but is in terrible fear that they may have been\r\ncarried on with the troops to Balaclava from some blunder.\" Miss\r\nNightingale's unerring eye for detail and perception of the point saw\r\nwhere the evil lay. First, there was no co-ordination among the\r\ndepartments at home in packing the things. The _Prince_ (the wreck of\r\nwhich in the famous hurricane of November 14 was disastrous to the\r\nwelfare of the soldiers) \"had on board,\" she wrote, \"a quantity of\r\nmedical comforts for us, which were so packed under shot and shell as\r\nthat it was found impossible to disembark them here, and they went to\r\nBalaclava and were lost.\" But there was a second obstacle. The army had\r\nencamped at Scutari as early as May 1854, but it had occurred to nobody\r\nto establish either there or at Constantinople an office for the\r\nreception and delivery of goods. Packages, intended for the army or the\r\nhospitals, if they arrived in merchant vessels, were detained in the\r\nTurkish Custom House, from which they were never extracted without much\r\ndelay, difficulty, and confusion; many were partially or entirely\r\ndestroyed; and many abstracted and totally lost. \"The Custom House,\"\r\nsaid Miss Nightingale, \"was a bottomless pit, whence nothing ever issued\r\nof all that was thrown in.\" In the case of ships chartered by the\r\nGovernment, great masses of goods were necessarily landed together and\r\nstowed away promiscuously for want of time and space for sorting, and\r\nwere often delayed by an unnecessary trip to Balaclava and back again.\r\nThere were occasions in which vessels containing hospital stores, as\r\nwell as munitions of war, made three voyages to and fro before the\r\nformer were landed at Scutari. Sometimes when Miss Nightingale happened\r\nto hear of an incoming vessel betimes, she was able, by special petition\r\nto the military authorities, to intercept hospital stores; but she saw\r\n(what no one else seems to have done) that the whole system was at\r\nfault. \"It is absolutely necessary,\" she wrote, \"that there should be a\r\nGovernment Store House, in the shape of a hulk, where stores for the\r\nBritish, from whatever ships, could be received at once from them, and\r\nbe delivered on the ship-store-keeper's receipt. There are no\r\nstore-houses to be had by the water's-edge, and porterage is very\r\nexpensive and slow.\" In March 1855 Miss Nightingale's solution was\r\nadopted.[134]\r\n\r\n  [134] _Statement to Subscribers_, pp. 9-10, and letter to Sidney\r\n        Herbert, January 22, 1855.\r\n\r\nAs Purveyor, Miss Nightingale was directly concerned only with the sick\r\nand wounded; but the condition in which the men arrived at Scutari\r\nenabled her to learn the state of things at the front, and she urged\r\nupon Mr. Herbert the necessity of sending out warm clothing to the army\r\nin the Crimea. \"The state of the troops who return here, particularly\r\nthose 500 who were admitted on the 19th, is frost-bitten, demi-nude,\r\nstarved, ragged. If the troops who work in the trenches are not supplied\r\nwith warm clothing, Napoleon's Russian campaign will be repeated here.\"\r\nThe terrible experiences of the British army before Sebastopol during\r\nthe winter of 1854-55 were some fulfilment of her prediction. When\r\nopportunity offered she similarly sent suggestions to Lord Panmure;\r\nthen, in reply to a letter of kind inquiries from him about her health\r\n(Aug. 1855), she called attention to the disproportionate number of\r\npatients which came from the Artillery, and threw out hints for\r\neconomizing the men's labour.[135] On a matter of the soldiers' pay, she\r\nwas the means of remedying a hardship which had struck her at Scutari.\r\nShe pressed earnestly upon Mr. Herbert that hospital stoppages against\r\nthe daily pay of the _sick_ soldier (9d.) should be made equal to the\r\nhospital stoppage against the _wounded_ soldier (4-1/2.), provided that the\r\nsickness be incurred while on duty before the enemy. She made this\r\nrepresentation in December 1854, not only to Mr. Herbert, but to the\r\nQueen. On February 1, 1855, she heard with great satisfaction that her\r\nsuggestion had been adopted, and that the soldiers' accounts were to be\r\nrectified in that sense as from the Battle of the Alma.\r\n\r\n  [135] See _Panmure_, vol. i. p. 356.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThe Queen had asked Miss Nightingale to make suggestions as to what Her\r\nMajesty could do \"to testify her sense of the courage and endurance so\r\nabundantly shown by her sick soldiers.\" One of the suggestions submitted\r\nwas the rectification just mentioned. Another suggestion was that a\r\nFirman should be immediately asked of the Sultan granting the military\r\ncemetery at Scutari to the British, and that Her Majesty should have it\r\nenclosed by a stone wall. \"There are already, alas!\" wrote Miss\r\nNightingale, \"about a thousand lying in this cemetery. Nine hundred were\r\nreported last week. We have buried one hundred in the last two days\r\nonly. The spot is beautiful, overlooking the Sea of Marmora, and\r\noccupies the space between the General Hospital wall and the edge of the\r\nsea-cliff.\" The suggestion must have gone straight to the Queen's heart,\r\nfor Miss Nightingale was informed that Her Majesty had written on the\r\nsubject both to Lord Clarendon, the Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and to the British Ambassador to the Porte. The Firman was\r\nobtained in due course, and the well-kept British enclosure attracts the\r\nattention of travellers to this day by contrast with the Oriental\r\nburial-places. It was again at Miss Nightingale's suggestion that a\r\nmemorial obelisk, far seen in lonely splendour, was erected \"by Queen\r\nVictoria and her people.\"[136]\r\n\r\n  [136] In 1865 Miss Nightingale, after an energetic correspondence with\r\n        the War Office, secured payment, long before promised, to an\r\n        English custode.\r\n\r\nBut I must not linger further over points of detail. Miss Nightingale's\r\neye for detail did not prevent her from taking comprehensive views,\r\nand from time to time she sent to Mr. Herbert schemes of reorganization.\r\nIn the following letter, of January 8, 1855, she exposed the extent and\r\nnature of the evil in the hospitals, and the kind of reform which was\r\nneeded to remedy them:--\r\n\r\n     As the larger proportion of the army (in which we are told that\r\n     there are not two thousand sound men) is coming into hospital--as\r\n     there are therefore thousands of lives at stake--as, in a service\r\n     where the future of the official servants is dependent upon the\r\n     personal interest of one man, these cannot be expected to peril\r\n     that future by getting themselves shelved as innovators.\r\n\r\n     I feel that this is no time for compliments or false shame; and\r\n     that you will never hear the whole truth, troublesome as it is,\r\n     except from one independent of promotion....\r\n\r\n     I subjoin a rough estimate of what has been given out by me during\r\n     one month--_the whole at the \"requisition\" of the Medical Men_--all\r\n     of which I have by me (merely in order to substantiate the facts of\r\n     the destitution of these hospitals).\r\n\r\n     Since the 17th December, we have received 3400 sick, and I have\r\n     made no sum total as yet of what has been done for these new-comers\r\n     by us--excepting for one corridor, which I enclose.\r\n\r\n     (1) Thus the Purveying is _nil_--that is the whole truth, beyond\r\n     bedding, bread, meat, cold water, fuel.\r\n\r\n     Beyond the boiling _en masse_ in the great coppers of the general\r\n     kitchen the meat is not cooked, the water is not boiled except what\r\n     is done in my subsidiary kitchens. My schedule will show what I\r\n     have purveyed.\r\n\r\n     I have refused to go on purveying for the third Hospital, the\r\n     Sultan's Serail[137]--the demands upon me there having been begun\r\n     with twelve hundred articles, including shirts, the first night of\r\n     our occupying it. I refer you to a List of what was _not_ in store,\r\n     and to a copy of one requisition upon me sent last letter.\r\n\r\n       [137] This is the \"Palace Hospital.\" See above, p. 174.\r\n\r\n     (2) The extraordinary circumstance of a whole army having been\r\n     ordered to abandon its kits, as was done when we landed our men\r\n     before Alma, has been overlooked entirely in all our system. The\r\n     fact is, that I am now clothing the British Army. The sick were\r\n     re-embarked at Balaclava for these Hospitals, without resuming\r\n     their kits, also half-naked besides. And when discharged from here,\r\n     they carry off, small blame to them, even my knives and\r\n     forks--shirts, of course, and Hospital clothing also. The men who\r\n     were sent to Abydos as convalescents were sent _in their Hospital\r\n     dresses_, or they must have gone naked. The consequence is that not\r\n     one single Hospital dress is now left in store, and I have\r\n     substituted Turkish dressing-gowns from Stamboul (three bales in the\r\n     passage are marked Hospital Gowns, but have not yet been \"_sat\r\n     upon_\"). To purvey this Hospital is like pouring water into a sieve;\r\n     and will be, till regimental stores have been sent out from England\r\n     enough to clothe the naked and refill the kit.\r\n\r\n     I have requisitions for _Uniform trousers_, for each and all of the\r\n     articles of a kit, sent in to me.\r\n\r\n     We have not yet heard of boots being sent out; the men come into\r\n     Hospital half-shod.\r\n\r\n     In a time of such calamity, unparalleled in the history, I believe,\r\n     of calamity, I have a little compassion left even for the wretched\r\n     Purveyor, swamped amid demands he never expected. But I have no\r\n     compassion for the men who would rather see hundreds of lives lost\r\n     than waive one scruple of the official conscience.\r\n\r\n     (3) The Hospital and Army Stores come out in the same vessels--and\r\n     up go our stores to Balaclava, and down they never come again, or\r\n     have not yet.\r\n\r\n     (4) The total inefficiency of the Hospital Orderly System as now\r\n     is. The French have a permanent system of Orderlies, trained for\r\n     the purpose, who do not re-enter the ranks. It is too late for us\r\n     to organize this. But if the convalescents, being good Orderlies,\r\n     were not sent away to the Crimea as soon as they have learnt their\r\n     work--if the Commander-in-Chief would call upon the Commanding\r\n     Officer of each Regiment to select ten men from each as Hospital\r\n     Orderlies to form a depot here (not young soldiers, but men of good\r\n     character), this would give some hope of organizing an efficient\r\n     corps. Above all, that the class of Ward-Master I shall mention\r\n     should be sent out from England.\r\n\r\n     We require:--\r\n\r\n     (1) An effective staff of Purveyors out from England--but beyond\r\n     this,\r\n\r\n     (2) _A head_, some one with _authority_ to mash up the departments\r\n     into uniform and rapid action. He may as well stay at home unless\r\n     he have power to modify the arrangements of departments made\r\n     expressly by Sir C. Trevelyan with Mr. Wreford before he came away\r\n     in May.\r\n\r\n     (3) We want Medical Officers.\r\n\r\n     (4) Three Deputy Inspectors-General (whereas we have only one)....\r\n     It is obvious from what has been said in former letters _who_, if\r\n     there are two Deputy Inspector-Generals made to these Hospitals,\r\n     should be made Deputy Inspector-General of this Barrack Hospital,\r\n     past and present efficiency being considered.\r\n\r\n     (5) We want discharged Non-Commissioned Officers, not past the\r\n     meridian of life--not the Ambulance Corps, who all died of delirium\r\n     tremens or cholera--but the class of men employed as Ward-Masters\r\n     of Military Prisons, or as Barrack Sergeants, or Hospital Sergeants\r\n     of the Guards who can be highly recommended.\r\n\r\n     We want these men as Ward-Masters and Assistant Ward-Masters as\r\n     Stewards. They must be under the orders of the Senior Medical\r\n     Officer, removable by him; they must be well paid so as to make it\r\n     worth their while,--say 5s. per day, 1st class, 2s. 6d. per day 2nd\r\n     class--for they must be superior men, not the rabble we have now.\r\n     (_N.B._--There are three Ward-Masters to each division of this\r\n     Hospital--of which there are three--containing 800 and odd sick in\r\n     each.)\r\n\r\n     The book of Hospital regulations, admirable in time of peace,\r\n     contains nothing for a time of war, much less a time of war like\r\n     this, unexampled for calamity.\r\n\r\n     The Hospital Sergeants are, of course, up in the Crimea with their\r\n     regiments,--and we have nothing but such raw Corporals and\r\n     Sergeants as can be spared, new to their work, to place in charge\r\n     of the divisions and wards. And these Lord Raglan complains of our\r\n     keeping. We must have Hospital Sergeants if there is to be the\r\n     remotest hope of efficiency among the Orderlies here.\r\n\r\n     (6) The Orderlies ought to be well paid, well fed, well housed.\r\n     They are now overworked, ill fed, and underpaid. The sickness and\r\n     mortality among them is extraordinary--ten took sick in one\r\n     Division to-night....\r\n\r\n     I had written a plan for the systematic organization of these\r\n     Hospitals upon a principle of centralization, under which the\r\n     component parts might be worked in unison. But, on reconsideration,\r\n     deeming so great a change impracticable during the present heavy\r\n     pressure of calamities here, I refrain from forwarding it, and\r\n     substitute a sketch of a plan, by which great improvement might be\r\n     made from within, without abandoning the forms under which the\r\n     service is carried on....\r\n\r\nThis further scheme may, however, be given more shortly from a later\r\nletter (Jan. 28):--\r\n\r\n     As the Purveying seems likely to come to an end of itself, perhaps\r\n     I shall not be guilty of the murder of the Innocents if I venture\r\n     to suggest what may take the place of the venerable Wreford.\r\n     Cornelius Agrippa had a broom-stick which used to fetch water for\r\n     his use. When the broom-stick was cut in two by the axe of an\r\n     unwary student, each end of the severed broom, catching up a\r\n     pitcher, began fetching water with all its might. Were the Purveyor\r\n     here cut in three, we might conceive some hope of having not only\r\n     water, but food also, and clothing fetched us. Let there be three\r\n     distinct offices instead of one indistinct one:--\r\n\r\n     (1) To provide us with food.\r\n\r\n     (2) With Hospital furniture and clothing.\r\n\r\n     (3) To keep the daily routine going.\r\n\r\n     These are now the three offices of the unfortunate Purveyor; and\r\n     none of them are performed.\r\n\r\n     But the Purveyor is _supposed_ to be only the channel through which\r\n     the Commissariat stores _pass_. Theoretically, but not practically,\r\n     it is so. (For practically Wreford gets nothing through the\r\n     Commissary, but employs a contractor.)\r\n\r\n     Now, why should not the _Commissariat purvey_ the Hospital with\r\n     food? perform the whole of Purveyor's office, No. 1? The practice\r\n     of drawing _raw_ rations, as here seen, seems invented on purpose\r\n     to waste the time of as many Orderlies as possible, who stand at\r\n     the Purveyor's office from 4 to 9 A.M. drawing the patients'\r\n     breakfast, from 10 to 12, drawing their dinner--and to make the\r\n     patients' meals as late as possible--because it is impossible to\r\n     get the diets, thus drawn, cooked before 3 or 4 o'clock. The scene\r\n     of confusion, delay, and disappointment where all these raw diets\r\n     are being weighed out by twos, and threes, and fours, is impossible\r\n     to conceive, unless one has seen it, as I have, day after day. And\r\n     one must have been, as I have, at all hours of the day and night in\r\n     this Hospital to conceive the abuses of this want of system--raw\r\n     meat, drawn too late to be cooked, standing all night in the wards,\r\n     etc., etc., etc. Why should not the Commissariat send _at once_ the\r\n     amount of beef and mutton, etc., etc., required into the kitchens,\r\n     without passing through this intermediate stage of drawing by\r\n     Orderlies?\r\n\r\n     Let a Commissariat Officer reside here--let the Ward-Masters make a\r\n     total from the Diet Rolls of the Medical Men--so many hundred full\r\n     diets--so many hundred half-diets--so many hundred spoon diets, and\r\n     give it over to the Commissariat Officer the day before. The next\r\n     day the _whole_ quantity, the _total_ of all the Ward-Masters'\r\n     totals, is given into the kitchens direct.\r\n\r\n     It should be all carved in the kitchens on hot plates, and at\r\n     meal-times the Orderlies come to fetch it for the patients--carry\r\n     it through the wards, where an Officer tells it off to every bed,\r\n     according to the Bed-ticket, on which he reads the Diet, hung up at\r\n     every bed. The time and confusion thus saved would be incalculable.\r\n     Punctuality is now impossible; the food is half-raw, and often many\r\n     hours after time. Some of the portions are all bone, whereas the\r\n     meat should be boned in the kitchen, according to the plan now\r\n     proposed, and the portions there carved contain meat only. Pray\r\n     consider this.\r\n\r\n     There might be, _besides_, an Extra Diet Kitchen to each division;\r\n     a teapot, issue of tea, sugar, etc., to every mess, for which\r\n     stores make the Ward-Master responsible; arrow-root, beef-tea, etc.,\r\n     to be issued from the Extra Diet Kitchens.\r\n\r\n     But into these details it is needless to enter to you.\r\n\r\n     (2) The second office of the Purveyor now is to furnish, _upon\r\n     requisition_, the Hospital with utensils and clothing. But let the\r\n     Hospital be furnished at once, as has been already described in\r\n     former letters. If 2000 beds exist, let these 2000 beds have their\r\n     appropriate complement of furniture and clothing, stationary and\r\n     fixed. Whether these be originally provided by a Commissary or a\r\n     storekeeper, let those who are competent decide. The French appear\r\n     to give as much too much power to their Commissariat, who are the\r\n     real chiefs of their Hospitals, while the Medical Men are only\r\n     their slaves, as we give too little. But the Hospital being once\r\n     furnished, and a store-keeper appointed to each division to supply\r\n     wear and tear, let the Ward-Masters be responsible. Let an inventory\r\n     hang on the door of each ward of what _ought_ to be found there. Let\r\n     the Ward-Masters give up the dirty linen every night and receive the\r\n     same quantity in clean linen every morning. Let the Patient shed his\r\n     Hospital clothing like a snake when he goes out of Hospital, be\r\n     inspected by the Quarter-Master, and receive, if necessary, from\r\n     Quarter-Master's store what is requisite for his becoming a soldier\r\n     again. While the next patient succeeds to his bed and its furniture.\r\n\r\n     (3) The daily routine of the Hospital. This is now performed, or\r\n     rather _not_ performed by the Purveyor. I am really cook,\r\n     housekeeper, scavenger (I go about making the Orderlies empty huge\r\n     tubs), washer-woman, general dealer, store-keeper. The Purveyor is\r\n     supposed to do all this, but it is physically impossible. And the\r\n     filth, and the disorder, and the neglect, let those describe who saw\r\n     it when we first came....\r\n\r\n     Let us have a Hotel-keeper, a House-steward, who shall take the\r\n     daily routine in charge--the cooking, washing and cleaning us--the\r\n     superintending the housekeeping, in short, be responsible for the\r\n     cleanliness of the wards, now done by one Medical Officer, Dr.\r\n     M'Grigor, by me, or by no one--inspect the kitchens, the\r\n     wash-houses, be what a housekeeper ought to be in a private Asylum.\r\n\r\n     With the French the _chef d'administration_, the Commissary, as we\r\n     should call him, is the master of the Orderlies. And the Medical\r\n     Men just come in and prescribe, as London physicians do, and go\r\n     away again. With us the Medical Officers are everything, and have\r\n     to do everything, however heterogeneous. The French system is bad,\r\n     because, though there may be twenty things down on the Carte for\r\n     the Medical Man to choose his patient's diet from, _nominally_,\r\n     the Chef d'Administration may have provided only two, and the\r\n     Patient has no redress.\r\n\r\n     Whether, in any new plan, the House Stewards have the command of\r\n     the Orderlies, or the Medical Man, which I am incompetent to\r\n     determine, whichever it be let us have a Governor of the Hospital.\r\n     As it is a Military Hospital, a Military Head is probably necessary\r\n     as Governor.\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 1855, a Royal Warrant was issued, reorganizing the\r\nMedical Staff Corps, \"for the better care of the sick and wounded,\"\r\nrevising the duties of the several officers, and improving their pay.\r\nAny one who cares to refer to this Warrant, and to compare it with Miss\r\nNightingale's letters just given, will see that in large measure her\r\nsuggestions were adopted by the War Department.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was careful, as we have seen, not to interfere with the\r\ndoctors, and, though she thought that as administrators some of them\r\nwere ineffective, she bore willing testimony to their skill and devotion\r\n(with some few exceptions) in their proper work. But she could not\r\nabstain from deploring one great omission, and she offered to subscribe\r\nlargely towards repairing it:--\r\n\r\n     \"One thing which we much require,\" she wrote to Mr. Herbert (Feb.\r\n     22, 1855), \"might easily be done. This is the formation of a\r\n     Medical School at Scutari. We have lost the finest opportunity for\r\n     advancing the cause of Medicine and erecting it into a Science\r\n     which will probably ever be afforded. There is here no operating\r\n     room, no dissecting room; post-mortem examinations are seldom made,\r\n     and then in the dead-house (the ablest Staff Surgeon here told me\r\n     that he considered that he had killed hundreds of men owing to the\r\n     absence of these) no statistics are kept as to between what ages\r\n     most deaths occur, as to modes of treatment, appearances of the\r\n     body after death, etc., etc., etc., and all the innumerable and\r\n     most important points which contribute to making Therapeutics a\r\n     means of saving life, and not, as it is here, a formal duty. Our\r\n     registration generally is so lamentably defective that often the\r\n     only record kept is--_a man died_ on such a day. There is a kiosk\r\n     on the Esplanade before the Barrack Hospital, rejected by the\r\n     Quarter-Master for his stores, which I have asked for and obtained\r\n     as a School of Medicine. It is not used now for any purpose--£300\r\n     or £400 (which I would willingly give) would put it in a state of\r\n     repair. It is not overlooked and is in every way calculated for the\r\n     purpose I have named. The Medical teaching duties could not be\r\n     carried on efficiently with a less staff than two lecturers on\r\n     Physiology and Pathology, and one lecturer on Anatomy, who will be\r\n     employed in preparing the subject for demonstration, and performing\r\n     operations for the information of the Juniors.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion also was in part adopted. An excellent dissecting-room\r\nwas built, provided with numerous instruments, microscopes and other\r\napparatus.[138]\r\n\r\n  [138] See _Pincoffs_, p. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nAnd so this woman of ideas went on, week by week, month by month,\r\npouring in requisitions, hints, plans, to the Government at home;\r\nsometimes getting things done as she wanted, at others making\r\nsuggestions which, had they been adopted, would still more have conduced\r\nto efficiency. Something of that calm and clear sagacity, which\r\nimpressed Queen Victoria and Prince Albert when they made her personal\r\nacquaintance,[139] was reflected in her appearance and demeanour as\r\nobserved by eye-witnesses at Scutari. \"In appearance,\" wrote Mr.\r\nOsborne, \"Miss Nightingale is just what you would expect in any other\r\nwell-bred woman, who may have seen perhaps rather more than thirty years\r\nof life; her manner and countenance are prepossessing, and this without\r\nthe possession of positive beauty; it is a face not easily forgotten,\r\npleasing in its smile, with an eye betokening great self-possession, and\r\ngiving, when she wishes, a quiet look of firm determination to every\r\nfeature. Her general demeanour is quiet and rather reserved; still, I am\r\nmuch mistaken if she is not gifted with a very lively sense of the\r\nridiculous. In conversation, she speaks on matters of business with a\r\ngrave earnestness one would not expect from her appearance. She has\r\nevidently a mind disciplined to restrain under the principles of the\r\naction of the moment every feeling which would interfere with it. She\r\nhas trained herself to command, and learned the value of conciliation\r\ntowards others and constraint over herself. I can conceive her to be a\r\nstrict disciplinarian; she throws herself into a work as its head. As\r\nsuch she knows well how much success must depend upon literal obedience\r\nto her every order.\"[140]\r\n\r\n  [139] See the words cited at the head of this chapter, and below,\r\n        pp. 324, 325.\r\n\r\n  [140] _Scutari and its Hospitals_, p. 25.\r\n\r\nIt was soon perceived at Scutari that Miss Nightingale was a power. She\r\nmentioned incidentally at a later period a curious fact, which shows the\r\nway in which officers appealed to her as a kind of emergency-man. In\r\n1862 she was pressing the War Office to separate the function of Banker\r\nfrom that of Purveyor, and she illustrated the confusion caused by the\r\namalgamation from her own experience. Among the instances was this: \"I\r\nhad at Scutari thousands of sovereigns at a time in my bedroom,\r\nentrusted to me by officers who preferred making me their banker because\r\nof the perpetual discord. 'Offend the Commissary or Purveyor, and you\r\nwon't be able to get your money.'\"[141] It was soon perceived also that\r\nMiss Nightingale was the person who, if any one, could get things done,\r\nand any official who had an idea took it to her. In the letters to\r\nSidney Herbert she sometimes bids him know that what she says does not\r\nmerely come from \"poor me,\" but represents the views \"of all the best\r\nmen here.\" But she, I think, was the best man of them all.[142] Such was\r\nthe opinion, at any rate, of a man among men, the redoubtable Sydney\r\nGodolphin Osborne. \"Every day,\" he wrote in describing his experience at\r\nScutari, \"brought some new complication of misery to be somehow\r\nunravelled. Every day had its peculiar trial to one who had taken such a\r\nload of responsibility, in an untried field, and with a staff of her own\r\nsex, all new to it. Hers was a post requiring the courage of a Cardigan,\r\nthe tact and diplomacy of a Palmerston, the endurance of a Howard, the\r\ncheerful philanthropy of a Mrs. Fry. Miss Nightingale fills that post;\r\nand, in my opinion, is the one individual who in this whole unhappy war\r\nhas shown more than any other what real energy guided by good sense can\r\ndo to meet the calls of sudden emergency.\"[143] And hence it was, too,\r\nthat any official who felt the urgency of some particular need in his\r\nown department carried his case to the Lady-in-Chief. Did a surgeon want\r\nsome point represented with special urgency to the authorities at home?\r\nHe went to Miss Nightingale. Did a purveyor want some special authority\r\nfrom the military to facilitate his task? He went to Miss Nightingale.\r\nThe centre of initiative at Scutari was in the Sisters' Tower; and going\r\nto Miss Nightingale had something of the magic that in earlier days was\r\nfound in \"going to Mr. Pitt.\"[144]\r\n\r\n  [141] Letter to Captain Galton, June 28, 1862. On the general question,\r\n        see vol. ii. p. 64.\r\n\r\n  [142] It was a _mot_ of Mr. Stafford's that he had only met two men in\r\n        the East, Omar Pacha (the Turkish Commander) and Florence\r\n        Nightingale.\r\n\r\n  [143] _Scutari and its Hospitals_, p. 27.\r\n\r\n  [144] See _Kinglake_, vol. vi. pp. 43, 436.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                           THE MINISTERING ANGEL\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Then in such hour of need ...\r\n                     Ye, like angels, appear,\r\n                     Radiant with ardour divine!...\r\n                     Order, courage, return ...\r\n                     Ye move through the ranks, recall\r\n                     The stragglers, refresh the outworn,\r\n                     Praise, reinspire the brave!\r\n                     Eyes rekindling, and prayers,\r\n                     Follow your steps as ye go.\r\n                                                MATTHEW ARNOLD.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have seen at work the impelling power of a\r\nbrain and a will; but, with these, Florence Nightingale brought to her\r\nmission the tenderness of a woman's heart. She was the matron of a\r\nhospital no less than the mistress of a barrack. She was a resolute\r\nadministrator; but also, as was said at the time in a hundred speeches,\r\nletters, articles:\r\n\r\n                   When pain and anguish wring the brow,\r\n                   A ministering angel thou.\r\n\r\nUpon those behind the scenes, upon ministers and officials, it was the\r\nformer side of her activity that made the profounder impression. Some of\r\nthem applauded what she did, recognizing that only the advent of a new\r\nforce could have driven a way through the quagmire; others complained\r\nthat in her methods there was something too imperious and masterful; all\r\nalike perceived her power and strength of will. But to the sick and\r\nwounded among whom she lived and moved, and to the great public at home\r\nwhich heard of her work, it was the softer side of her character that\r\nmade the more instant appeal. By them she was known and honoured not as\r\nthe rigid disciplinarian or creative organizer, but as the compassionate\r\nand tender nurse. Those who had no means of knowing what other work she\r\nhad to do supposed that ministration to the sick, in the narrower sense,\r\ncomprised it all. But, in fact, as she wrote to Mr. Herbert (Jan. 14,\r\n1855), nursing was \"the least important of the functions into which she\r\nhad been forced\"; and those on the spot, who watched the arduousness of\r\nthese other duties, wished that she could be persuaded to spare herself\r\nmore of one kind of work or of the other. The marvel is that in\r\nunstinted measure she combined them both.\r\n\r\nHer devotion and her power of work were prodigious. \"I work in the wards\r\nall day,\" she said, \"and write all night\"; and this was hardly\r\nexaggeration. A letter from Miss Stanley (Dec. 21, 1854) gives an\r\ninteresting glimpse of Florence Nightingale at work in the Barrack\r\nHospital:--\r\n\r\n     We turned up the stone stairs; on the second floor we came to the\r\n     corridors of sick, on low wooden stands, raised about a foot from\r\n     the floor, placed about 2 feet apart, and leaving 2 or 3 feet down\r\n     the middle, along which we walked. The atmosphere worsened as we\r\n     advanced. We passed down two or three of these immense corridors,\r\n     asking our way as we went. At last we came to the guard-room,\r\n     another corridor, then through a door into a large busy kitchen,\r\n     where stood Mrs. Margaret Williams, who seemed much pleased to see\r\n     me: then a heavy curtain was raised[145]; I went through a door,\r\n     and there sat dear Flo writing on a small unpainted deal table. I\r\n     never saw her looking better. She had on her black merino, trimmed\r\n     with black velvet, clean linen collar and cuffs, apron, white cap\r\n     with a black handkerchief tied over it; and there was Mrs.\r\n     Bracebridge, looking so nice too. I was quite satisfied with my\r\n     welcome.... A stream of people every minute. \"Please, ma'am, have\r\n     you any black-edged paper?\" \"Please, what can I give which would\r\n     keep on his stomach; is there any arrowroot to-day for him?\" \"No;\r\n     the tubs of arrowroot must be for the worst cases; we cannot spare\r\n     him any, nor is there any jelly to-day; try him with some eggs.\"\r\n     \"Please, Mr. Gordon [the Chief Engineer] wishes to see Miss\r\n     Nightingale about the orders she gave him.\" Mr. Sabin comes in for\r\n     something else. Mr. Bracebridge in and out about General\r\n     Adams,[146] and orders of various kinds.[147]\r\n\r\n  [145] Miss Nightingale's camp bedstead was at this time behind a screen\r\n        in the kitchen, for she had given up her room to the widow of an\r\n        officer.\r\n\r\n  [146] He had died in hospital from his wounds, and his body was to be\r\n        sent to England.\r\n\r\n  [147] _Stanmore_, vol. i. p. 373.\r\n\r\nThe occasion described by Miss Stanley was post-day. Still busier were\r\nthe awful days on which fresh consignments of sick and wounded arrived\r\nfrom the Crimea. Miss Nightingale has been known, said General Bentinck,\r\nto pass eight hours on her knees dressing wounds and administering\r\ncomfort. There were times when she stood for twenty hours at a stretch,\r\napportioning quarters, distributing stores, directing the labours of her\r\nstaff, or assisting at the painful operations where her presence might\r\nsoothe or support. She had, said Mr. Osborne, \"an utter disregard of\r\ncontagion. I have known her spend hours over men dying of cholera or\r\nfever. The more awful to every sense, any particular case, especially if\r\nit was that of a dying man, the more certainly might her slight form be\r\nseen bending over him, administering to his ease by every means in her\r\npower, and seldom quitting his side till death released him.\"[148] \"We\r\ncannot,\" wrote Mr. Bracebridge to her uncle, Mr. Smith (Dec. 18, 1854),\r\n\"prevent her self-sacrifice for the dying. She cannot delegate as we\r\ncould wish; but the cases are so interesting and painful; who could\r\nleave them when once taken up?--boys and brave men dying who can be\r\nsaved by nursing and proper diet.\" It is recorded that on one occasion\r\nshe saw five soldiers set aside as hopeless cases. The first duty of the\r\noverworked surgeons was with those whom there seemed to be more hope of\r\nsaving. She asked to be given the care of the five men, and the surgeons\r\nconsented. Assisted by one of her nurses, she tended the cases\r\nthroughout the night, administering nourishment from her stores, and in\r\nthe morning they were found to be in a fit condition for surgical\r\ntreatment.[149] \"Miss Nightingale,\" said a Chelsea pensioner, in\r\nrecalling his experiences at Scutari, \"was always coming in and out. She\r\nused to attend to all the worst cases herself. Some of the new men were\r\na bit shy at first, but many a time I've heard her say, 'Never be\r\nashamed of your wounds, my friend.'\"[150] \"I believe,\" wrote a Civilian\r\ndoctor who saw her at work, \"that there was never a severe case of any\r\nkind that escaped her notice, and sometimes it was wonderful to see her\r\nat the bedside of a patient who had been admitted perhaps but an hour\r\nbefore, and of whose arrival one would hardly have supposed it possible\r\nshe could be already cognisant.\"[151]\r\n\r\n  [148] _Scutari and its Hospitals_, p. 26.\r\n\r\n  [149] _Daily News_, June 2, 1855.\r\n\r\n  [150] _Wintle_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n  [151] _Pincoffs_, p. 78, where a particular case in point is recorded.\r\n\r\nSometimes when exhausted nature could not be denied repose, she would\r\ndepute the last sad office to another lady. \"Selina [Mrs. Bracebridge]\r\nis sitting up with a dying man. Florence at last asleep, 1 A.M.\" Her\r\ndays were always long; for she deemed it well not to allow any of her\r\nnurses to be in the wards after eight at night. And often, when all else\r\nwas quiet, and she had been sitting up to finish her heavy\r\ncorrespondence, she would make a final tour of the wards. A lady\r\nvolunteer, who two days after her arrival was sent for to accompany Miss\r\nNightingale on such a tour, recalled the scene. \"We went round the whole\r\nof the second story, into many of the wards and into one of the upper\r\ncorridors. It seemed an endless walk, and it was one not easily\r\nforgotten. As we slowly passed along, the silence was profound; very\r\nseldom did a moan or cry from those deeply suffering ones fall on our\r\nears. A dim light burned here and there. Miss Nightingale carried her\r\nlantern, which she would set down before she bent over any of the\r\npatients. I much admired her manner to the men--it was so tender and\r\nkind.\"[152] The description of these midnight vigils, given by Mr.\r\nMacdonald, the commissioner of the _Times_ Fund, became famous, by\r\nadaptation, throughout the world:--\r\n\r\n     Wherever there is disease in its most dangerous form and the hand\r\n     of the despoiler distressingly nigh, there is that incomparable\r\n     woman sure to be seen. Her benignant presence is an influence for\r\n     good comfort, even amid the struggles of expiring nature. She is a\r\n     \"ministering angel\" without any exaggeration in these hospitals,\r\n     and as her slender form glides quietly along each corridor, every\r\n     poor fellow's face softens with gratitude at the sight of her. When\r\n     all the medical officers have retired for the night and silence\r\n     and darkness have settled down upon those miles of prostrate sick,\r\n     she may be observed alone, with a little lamp in her hand,[153]\r\n     making her solitary rounds.\r\n\r\n  [152] _Eastern Hospitals_, vol. i. pp. 69-70.\r\n\r\n  [153] The lamp of famous memory was a camp lamp, and was taken\r\n        possession of by Mrs. Bracebridge.\r\n\r\nFamous, too, became the words which one poor fellow sent home. \"What a\r\ncomfort it was to see her pass even. She would speak to one and nod and\r\nsmile to as many more; but she could not do it to all, you know. We lay\r\nthere by hundreds; but we could kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our\r\nheads on the pillow again, content.\" \"Before she came,\" said another\r\nsoldier's letter, \"there was cussin' and swearin', but after that it was\r\nholy as a church.\" Mr. Sidney Herbert read out these letters at a public\r\nmeeting in November 1855.[154] Lord Ellesmere used Mr. Macdonald's\r\ndescription in the House of Lords in May 1856.[155] And Longfellow, in\r\nthe following year, made a poem of it all, one of the most widely known\r\npoems, I suppose, that have ever been written:--\r\n\r\n  [154] Below, p. 270.\r\n\r\n  [155] Below, p. 303.\r\n\r\n                  Lo! in that hour of misery\r\n                  A lady with a lamp I see\r\n                      Pass through the glimmering gloom,\r\n                      And flit from room to room.\r\n                  And slow, as in a dream of bliss,\r\n                  The speechless sufferer turns to kiss\r\n                      Her shadow, as it falls\r\n                      Upon the darkening walls.\r\n\r\nThe men idolized her. They kissed her shadow, and they saluted her as\r\nshe passed down their wounded ranks. \"If the Queen came for to die,\"\r\nsaid a soldier who lost a leg at the Alma, \"they ought to make _her_\r\nqueen, and I think they would.\" Her lively sense of humour, which Mr.\r\nOsborne had discerned in talks with her in the hospital, was appreciated\r\nalso by the patients. \"She was wonderful,\" said one, \"at cheering up any\r\none who was a bit low,\" \"She was all full of life and fun,\" said\r\nanother, \"when she talked to us, especially if a man was a bit\r\ndown-hearted.\"[156] Who can tell what comfort was brought by the sound\r\nof a woman's gentle voice, the touch of a woman's gentle hand, to many\r\na poor fellow racked by fever, or smarting from sores? And who can say\r\nhow often her presence may have been as \"a cup of strength in some great\r\nagony\"? \"The magic of her power over men was felt,\" as Kinglake has\r\ndescribed, \"in the room--the dreaded, the blood-stained room--where\r\noperations took place. There perhaps the maimed soldier, if not yet\r\nresigned to his fate, might at first be craving death rather than meet\r\nthe knife of the surgeon; but, when such a one looked and saw that the\r\nhonoured Lady-in-Chief was patiently standing beside him, and--with lips\r\nclosely set and hands folded--decreeing herself to go through the pain\r\nof witnessing pain, he used to fall into the mood for obeying her silent\r\ncommand, and--finding strange support in her presence--bring himself to\r\nsubmit and endure.\"[157] And when the hour of death came, how often must\r\nthe passing have been soothed by a presence which, with words of womanly\r\ncomfort, may have carried the soldier's last thoughts back to home and\r\nwife, or child? A member of Parliament, well known in London Society,\r\nMr. Augustus Stafford, went out during the recess of 1854 to Scutari,\r\nand made himself very useful to Miss Nightingale. \"He says,\" wrote\r\nMonckton Milnes (Jan. 1855), \"that Florence in the Hospital makes\r\nintelligible to him the Saints of the Middle Ages. If the soldiers were\r\ntold that the roof had opened, and she had gone up palpably to Heaven,\r\nthey would not be the least surprised. They quite believe she is in\r\nseveral places at once.\"[158] They were impressed by her power, no less\r\nthan they were touched by her tenderness, and ascribed to the\r\nLady-in-Chief the gifts of leadership in the field. \"If she were at\r\ntheir head, they would be in Sebastopol in a week;\" was a saying often\r\nheard in the hospital wards.\r\n\r\n  [156] _Wintle_, pp. 106, 108.\r\n\r\n  [157] _Invasion of the Crimea_, vol. vi. p. 425.\r\n\r\n  [158] _Life of Lord Houghton_, vol. i. p. 505.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nOf all the documents that have passed under my eyes in writing this\r\nmemoir, none have touched me more than a bundle of letters to and from\r\nfriends and relatives of Crimean soldiers. Miss Nightingale was careful\r\nto take note of any dying man's last wishes or messages, and the\r\nletters in which she forwarded these, to wife or mother, must, by their\r\ntouch of womanly sympathy, have brought balm to many a stricken heart.\r\n\"My dear Miss,\" writes one mother, \"I feel the loss of my poor son's\r\ndeath very keenly, but if anything could help my grief it is the thought\r\nthat he was looked to and cared for by kind friends when so many miles\r\naway from his native land.\" \"I beg,\" writes a sister, \"to return you my\r\ngrateful thanks for all your kindness to my poor dear brother and for\r\nwriting to tell me of his death. It is great consolation to know that\r\nboth his soul and body were so kindly cared for.\" \"I can assure you,\"\r\nwrites another, \"that you are beloved by every poor soldier I have\r\nseen.\" Correspondence of this kind continued in the same manner when\r\nMiss Nightingale passed on from Scutari to the Crimea. One letter to a\r\nbereaved mother may be given as a representative of many:--\r\n\r\n     ... The first time I saw your son was in going round the wards in\r\n     the General Hospital at Balaklava. He had been brought in, in the\r\n     morning.... He was always conscious, and remained so till the very\r\n     last. He prayed aloud so beautifully that, as the Nurse in charge\r\n     said, \"It was like a sermon to hear him.\" He asked \"to see Miss\r\n     Nightingale.\" He knew me, and expressed himself to me as entirely\r\n     resigned to die. He pressed my hand when he could not speak. He\r\n     died in the night.... He was decently interred in a burial-ground\r\n     we have about a mile from Balaklava. One of my own Sisters lies in\r\n     the same ground, to whom I have erected a monument. Should you wish\r\n     anything similar to be done over the grave of your lost son, I will\r\n     endeavour to gratify you, if you will inform me of your wishes.\r\n     With true sympathy for your loss, I remain, dear Madam, yours\r\n     sincerely,\r\n                                                FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nThere is another bundle, hardly less touching, which contains letters of\r\nanxious inquiry addressed to Miss Nightingale from all parts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, begging her to send, if she can, particulars of the\r\nwhereabouts or of the illness or of the last hours of husband, brother,\r\nfather, or son. \"In order that you may know him,\" writes one fond\r\nmother, \"he is a straight, nice, clean-looking, light-complexioned\r\nyouth.\" \"Died in hospital, in good frame of mind,\" was Miss\r\nNightingale's docket for the reply. Every letter was carefully\r\nanswered, and every message was, I doubt not, given whenever it was in\r\nher power to do so. Many are the blessings invoked on Miss Nightingale's\r\nhead. Often the writer begins by explaining that the newspapers have\r\ntold of her great kindness and so she will forgive the intrusion. Others\r\nshow that they take all that for granted by beginning, \"Dear Friend,\" or\r\nending, \"Yours affectionately.\" Many wives beg her to let the soldier\r\nknow that the children are well and happy. And one letter sends a\r\nmessage to a wounded Lancer from the girl he left behind him, \"If alive,\r\nplease mention my name to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe strain upon Miss Nightingale's physical and mental powers was\r\nincessant. Her health, as it proved in the end, was seriously impaired;\r\nbut during all her work at Scutari, she was never absent from her post.\r\n\"You had the best opportunities,\" she was asked by the Royal Commission\r\nof 1857, \"for observing the condition of the soldier when he entered the\r\nhospitals, while he resided in them, when he died and was sent to the\r\ncemeteries, when he was sent home as an invalid, and when he rejoined\r\nthe army?\" \"Yes,\" she answered; \"I was never out of the hospitals.\"\r\nDuring the worst time of cholera and typhus, three of her nurses died,\r\nand seven of the army doctors. Miss Nightingale tended two of the\r\ndoctors in their last moments, and the thinning, for a while, of the\r\nmedical ranks increased her labours. The amount of clerical work which\r\ndevolved on her was, it may be well imagined, enormous. Lady Alicia\r\nBlackwood records that when she was starting a school in the women's and\r\nchildren's quarters at Scutari, Miss Nightingale said laughingly, \"Oh,\r\nare you really going to do that unkind thing--to teach children to\r\nwrite? I am so tired of writing, I sometimes wish I could not write!\"\r\nThe laugh must have had a certain grimness in it, I fear. The extent of\r\nthe correspondence which Miss Nightingale kept up with Ministers at\r\nhome, with military and medical officers at the seat of war and at\r\nScutari, may be gathered from the foregoing chapters. Her\r\nsuperintendence of the nurses entailed in account-keeping and in\r\nletters to complainants among them, and to their relatives, another mass\r\nof correspondence. Then I find next, amongst her papers, piles of\r\nstore-keeping accounts (mostly in her own handwriting), and other\r\nbundles of correspondence referring to offers of help in money or in\r\nkind. That Miss Nightingale ultimately broke down under the strain was\r\nnatural; the marvel is that she bore up against it so long. She could\r\nnot have coped with the mass of detail involved in her multifarious\r\nlabours without a good deal of help. To Mr. Macdonald's assistance I\r\nhave already referred; and like assistance was rendered for a time by\r\nthe Rev. and Hon. Sydney Godolphin Osborne, the famous S.G.O. of letters\r\nto the _Times_. Mr. Kinglake devotes a charming page to \"the\r\nenthusiastic young fellow who, abandoning his life of ease, pleasure,\r\nand luxury, went out, as he probably phrased it, to 'fag' for the\r\nLady-in-Chief.\" The reference is probably to Mr. Percy, mentioned in a\r\nprevious chapter, or possibly to Mr. William Shore, a distant relative\r\nof Miss Nightingale's father; he was put in charge of a soldiers'\r\nlibrary. But it was Miss Nightingale's old friends, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBracebridge, who rendered the longest and the most helpful aid. Mrs.\r\nBracebridge shared alike her room and her labours, and with Mr.\r\nBracebridge cared, as we have heard, for the soldiers' wives. But Mr.\r\nBracebridge did much else. His knowledge of the East, and his\r\npersevering good humour, determined to help everybody about everything,\r\nwere invaluable. Faithful, cheery, and indefatigable, no less now among\r\nthe arduous labours of Scutari than in former days of sight-seeing at\r\nRome and in Egypt, he fetched and carried for Miss Nightingale, wrote\r\nletters or orders for her, and kept minutes of her interviews; and, at\r\ntimes of less strain, relieved her of visitors or callers by taking them\r\nfor excursions in the Straits or to Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's thoughtfulness devised many practical ways of helping\r\nthe men who were not too ill to think of their worldly affairs. In order\r\nto encourage them as much as possible to occupy themselves and to keep\r\nup a communication with home, she supplied stationery and postage stamps\r\nto those in hospital. If a soldier was illiterate or too ill to write,\r\nshe or one of her nurses, or some other volunteer, would write at the\r\nsick man's dictation. Mr. Augustus Stafford, as mentioned above, spent\r\nsome portion of the autumn recess (Nov.-Dec. 1854) at Scutari, and he\r\ngave his experiences to the Roebuck Committee. He described the pitiable\r\ncondition of the wounded on their arrival, \"their thigh and shoulder\r\nbones perfectly red from rubbing against the deck\" of the vessel which\r\nhad brought them from the Crimea; but then Miss Nightingale's nurses\r\ncame round, \"and with a precision and rapidity which you would scarcely\r\nbelieve, would bring the soldiers arrowroot mixed with port wine, which\r\nwas the greatest comfort; the men expressed themselves very thankfully,\r\nand said that they felt themselves in heaven.\" But it was in writing\r\nletters for the soldiers that this \"cherished, yet unspoilt, favourite\r\nof English society\"[159] spent most of his time at Scutari. Of Miss\r\nNightingale's reading-rooms some account will be found in another\r\nchapter (XI.).\r\n\r\n  [159] _Kinglake_, p. 436.\r\n\r\nShe was much touched by the men's appreciation of these attentions, and\r\nshe was no less impressed by the conduct of the orderlies in the\r\nhospitals. In describing to the Secretary of State certain sanitary\r\nreforms which she carried out in the hospitals of Scutari, she wrote: \"I\r\nmust pay my tribute to the instinctive delicacy, the ready attention of\r\norderlies and patients during all that dreadful period; for my sake they\r\nperformed offices of this kind (which they neither would for the sake of\r\ndiscipline, nor for that of the importance to their own health, which\r\nthey did not know), and never was there one word nor one look which a\r\ngentleman would not have used; and while paying this humble tribute to\r\nhumble courtesy, the tears come into my eyes as I think how, amidst\r\nscenes of loathsome disease and death, there rose above it all the\r\ninnate dignity, gentleness, and chivalry of the men (for never, surely,\r\nwas chivalry so strikingly exemplified), shining in the midst of what\r\nmust be considered as the lowest sinks of human misery, and preventing\r\ninstinctively the use of one expression which could distress a\r\ngentlewoman.\"[160]\r\n\r\n  [160] _Notes_, p. 94.\r\n\r\nEven in the lowest sinks of human misery there are chords which will\r\nrespond to a sympathetic touch. It was the innate dignity of her bearing\r\nthat struck every one who saw Florence Nightingale; and, amidst those\r\nscenes of loathsome disease and death, she was herself \"the sweet\r\npresence of a good diffused.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                         THE RELIGIOUS DIFFICULTY\r\n\r\n\r\n     Your sectarians of every species, small and great, Catholic or\r\n     Protestant, of high church or low, ... these are the true fog\r\n     children.--RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n     Whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse\r\n     disputings.--ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nEvery generation has its own \"religious difficulty,\" by which phrase is\r\nmeant, not the difficulty which the individual soul or the collective\r\nsoul of a nation may find in its religious beliefs themselves, but a\r\ndifficulty which intrudes itself into allied or alien matters from the\r\nsphere of religious disputation. In the present day, the religious\r\ndifficulty with which we are most familiar concerns questions of\r\neducation. In the days of Miss Nightingale's mission to the East there\r\nwas a religious difficulty in questions of nursing.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not enough that such a mission as hers was conceived in the very\r\nspirit of the Founder of Christianity: \"I was sick, and ye visited me.\"\r\nThe question was eagerly and angrily canvassed under which of the rival\r\nChristian banners the visitation of the sick soldiers should be, and was\r\nbeing, carried on. The country had at the time hardly recovered its\r\nmental equilibrium after the shock administered to it by the Tractarian\r\nmovement, and echoes of the \"No Popery\" cry of 1850 were still resonant\r\nin many quarters. The religious difficulty appeared at the very start of\r\nMiss Nightingale's Crimean work, and dogged her footsteps to the end of\r\nit. I have dealt already with the difficulties which her experiment\r\nencountered from social ideas, military prejudices, official routine;\r\nbut I am not sure that of all her difficulties the religious one was not\r\nthe most wearing and worrying, as it was also assuredly the most\r\nunnecessary and the least excusable. It enveloped a noble undertaking in\r\na fog of envy, strife, and futile railing.\r\n\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert, who was supposed to be of the High Church\r\npersuasion, had scented the difficulty from the first, as we have heard,\r\nand Miss Nightingale was keenly alive to it. They had desired to make\r\nthe first party of nurses representative of all the leading sects; but\r\nowing to the abstention of a Protestant institution, the Roman Catholics\r\nand the High Church party were in a considerable majority among the\r\nthirty-eight nurses. This fact gave the alarm, and a sectarian\r\nhue-and-cry was immediately raised. It began, as I am sorry to have to\r\nsay, in the _Daily News_; it was taken up, as goes without saying, in\r\nthe so-called \"religious press.\" On October 28, 1854, when Miss\r\nNightingale was on her way to Scutari, an attack upon her was given\r\ngreat prominence in the first-named paper. It was signed\r\n\"Anti-Puseyite,\" and it included the text of Mr. Herbert's letter which\r\nhad somehow or other been obtained.[161] \"Miss Nightingale recruited her\r\nstaff of nurses from Miss Sellon's house [a High Church one] and from a\r\nRomanist establishment.\" This awful fact explained \"the party spirit\r\nwhich actuated the choice of Miss Nightingale for this important and\r\nresponsible office, and which set aside Lady Maria Forester\"--a lady, it\r\nseems, of Evangelical principles. It was not yet too late to remedy the\r\noffence \"if the feeling of the nation be at once aroused and expressed.\"\r\n\"A Reader of the Bible\" and other correspondents followed, and the\r\ncontroversy raged furiously. Mrs. Sidney Herbert's intervention, with an\r\nassurance that Miss Nightingale was somewhat Low Church, did not stop\r\nit. S. G. O. referred to it in his book. \"I have heard and read,\" he\r\nwrote, \"with indignation the remarks hazarded upon her religious\r\ncharacter. Her works ought to answer for her faith. If there is blame in\r\nlooking for a Roman Catholic priest to attend a dying Romanist, let me\r\nshare it with her--I did it again and again.\"[162] An admirable avowal,\r\nbut not calculated, I fear, to allay the anger of \"No Popery\" fanatics.\r\nThe publication of Queen Victoria's letter of December 6 (p. 215),\r\nshowing the confidence which Her Majesty placed in Miss Nightingale, did\r\nsomething to stem the tide, but for many months the feud flowed on in\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\n  [161] See above, p. 154 _n._\r\n\r\n  [162] _Scutari and its Hospitals_, p. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's comment, when echoes of the storm reached her on the\r\nBosphorus, was characteristic. \"They tell me,\" she wrote to Mr. Herbert\r\n(Jan. 28, 1855), \"that there is a religious war about poor me in the\r\n_Times_, and that Mrs. Herbert has generously defended me. I do not know\r\nwhat I have done to be so dragged before the Public. But I am so glad\r\nthat my God is not the God of the High Church or of the Low, that He is\r\nnot a Romanist or an Anglican--or a Unitarian. I don't believe He is\r\neven a Russian, though His events go strangely against us. (_N.B._--A\r\nGreek once said to me at Salamis, 'I do believe God Almighty is an\r\nEnglishman.')\" Excellent, too, was the answer given by an Irish\r\nclergyman when asked to what sect Miss Nightingale belonged. \"She\r\nbelongs to a sect which, unfortunately, is a very rare one--the sect of\r\nthe Good Samaritan.\" Miss Nightingale was by descent a Unitarian, by\r\npractice a communicant of the Church of England; but she was addicted\r\nneither to High Church nor to Low. Her God was the God of Moral Law, a\r\nGod of infinite pity and benevolence, but also One who worked out His\r\npurpose by the free will of human instruments. Her service of God was\r\nthe service of Man, and her service of Man mingled efficiency with\r\ntenderness. She applied only one kind of test to a nurse: Was she a good\r\nwoman, and did she know her business? To be a good woman, a religious\r\nwoman, a noble woman was not in itself sufficient. \"Excellent, gentle,\r\nself-devoted women,\" Miss Nightingale said in a note upon some of her\r\nstaff, \"fit more for Heaven than for a Hospital, they flit about like\r\nangels without hands among the patients, and soothe their souls, while\r\nthey leave their bodies dirty and neglected. They never complain, they\r\nare eager for self-mortification. But I came not to mortify the nurses,\r\nbut to nurse the wounded.\" Therefore if a nurse was a good woman and\r\nknew her business, it was nothing that she was Romanist, Anglican, High\r\nChurch, Low Church, or Unitarian. If she was not a good nurse, the fact\r\nthat she belonged, or did not belong, to this or that persuasion was no\r\nrecommendation. Miss Nightingale was, it is true, desirous from the\r\nfirst to include Roman Catholics in her staff, and she did so, in spite\r\nof many difficulties, to the end. But her reasons therein were\r\npractical, not sectarian. In the first place, many of the soldiers were\r\nRoman Catholics; and, secondly, her apprenticeship in nursing had shown\r\nher the excellent qualities, as nurses, of many Catholic Sisters. But\r\nhere efficiency was the test, and a Protestant Deaconess from\r\nKaiserswerth was all one to her with a Sister from \"a Romanist\r\nestablishment.\" And one practical advantage of vowed Sisters was that\r\nshe did not lose them from marriage. One morning six nurses came in to\r\nMiss Nightingale, declaring that they one and all wished to be married.\r\nThey were followed by six soldiers--sergeants and corporals--declaring\r\ntheir desire to claim the nurses as brides. This matrimonial deluge\r\ncarried off six of her best nurses.[163]\r\n\r\n  [163] _Blackwood_, p. 232.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was Miss Nightingale's position; and one can understand the\r\namused contempt with which she heard of the picture drawn of her in\r\ncertain quarters as a conspirator in a Tractarian or Romanist plot. But\r\nshe was a practical person, and, though herself broad-minded, took stock\r\nof a narrower world as she found it. She was intensely desirous of\r\nmaking her experiment of woman nurses a success, and she felt acutely\r\nthe danger of wrecking it by even the suspicion of sectarian prejudice.\r\nThis fact supplies a further explanation of the alarm with which she\r\nreceived the coming of the second party of nurses under Miss\r\nStanley.[164] It included a batch of fifteen nuns. \"The proportion of R.\r\nCatholics,\" she wrote to Mr. Herbert, \"which is already making an\r\noutcry, you have increased to 25 in 84. Mr. Menzies [the Principal\r\nMedical Officer] has declared that he will have two only at the General\r\nHospital, and I cannot place them here [in the Barrack Hospital] in a\r\ngreater proportion than I have done, without exciting the suspicion of\r\nthe Medical Men and others.\" The difficulty was ultimately adjusted, but\r\nonly at the cost of infinite trouble and worry to Miss Nightingale. Her\r\nletters to Mr. Herbert are full of references to the subject, some of\r\nthem very amusing, and perhaps it was her lively sense of humour that\r\nhelped to carry her through this religious difficulty. \"Such a tempest,\"\r\nshe wrote (Dec. 25, 1854), \"has been brewed in this little pint pot as\r\nyou could have no idea of. But I, like the Ass, have put on the Lion's\r\nskin, and when once I have done that (poor me, who never affronted any\r\none before), I can bray so loud that I shall be heard, I am afraid, as\r\nfar as England. However, this is no place for lions; and as for asses,\r\nwe have enough.\" One proposition made to her was that, as the doctors\r\ndid not want many more woman nurses, \"ten of the Protestants should be\r\nappropriated as clerical females by the chaplains, and ten of the nuns\r\nby the priests, _not as nurses_, but as female ecclesiastics. With this\r\nof course I have nothing to do. It being directly at variance with my\r\ninstructions, I cannot of course appropriate the Government money to\r\nsuch a purpose.\" Miss Nightingale's own proposition was to allocate the\r\nparty in various proportions to various hospitals; but the Superior of\r\nthe new set of nuns objected that \"it would be uncanonical\" for any of\r\nher party to be separated from her. Then Miss Nightingale proposed\r\nsending some of the nuns, either of the first or of the second batch,\r\nback to England; but Father Cuffe said that to send them away would be\r\n\"like the driving of the Blessed Virgin through the desert by Herod.\" \"I\r\nbelieve it may be proved as a logical proposition,\" wrote Miss\r\nNightingale in the midst of her religious difficulty, \"that it is\r\nimpossible for me to ride through all this; my caique is upset, but I am\r\nsticking on the bottom still.\" Three days later she still despaired.\r\n\"The fifteen New Nuns are leading me the devil of a life, trying to get\r\nin _vi et armis_, and will upset the coach; there is little doubt of\r\nthat.\" However, she held her ground. She had started with a Protestant\r\nhowl at her; she was now prepared to face \"a Roman Catholic storm.\"\r\nHappily the Reverend Mother of the first party of nuns was on her side,\r\nand strove to compose the canonical difficulty. To another Reverend\r\nMother, who was less peaceably minded, Miss Nightingale often referred\r\nin her letters as \"the Reverend Brickbat.\" In any case, Miss Nightingale\r\nwas resolved, as she wrote, \"not to let our little Society become a\r\nhot-bed of Roman Catholic Intriguettes.\" Ultimately it was arranged that\r\nfive of the second party of nuns should go to the General Hospital, and\r\nten to the newly opened hospital at Koulali. Miss Nightingale suspected\r\nsome of the second party of a desire to proselytize; and presently she\r\nhad to inform Mr. Herbert (Feb. 15, 1855) of \"a charge of converting and\r\nrebaptizing before death, reported to me by the Senior Chaplain, by him\r\nto the Commandant, by him to the Commander-in-Chief.\" She promptly\r\nexchanged the suspected nun.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of theological rancour was infinite. Having caught wind of\r\nthe fact that there was some difference of view among the Roman Catholic\r\nSisters, an Evangelical writer sought to fan the flame by denouncing the\r\nabsurdity of \"Catholic Nuns transferring their allegiance from the Pope\r\nof Rome to a Protestant Lady.\" One of the Sisters, on hearing of this\r\ndiatribe, playfully addressed Miss Nightingale as \"Your Holiness,\" who\r\nin turn dubbed the Sister \"her Cardinal.\"[165] I hereby give notice, in\r\ncase Crimean letters from Miss Nightingale should chance to be printed\r\n(such as I have seen) in which she says, \"I do so want my Cardinal,\"\r\nthat the expression signifies no dark and secret adhesion to any Prince\r\nof the Roman Church, but only a desire for the services of a\r\nparticularly efficient nursing Sister. If a nurse was efficient, Miss\r\nNightingale was on the friendliest terms with her, equally whether the\r\nnurse were Catholic or Protestant. Miss Nightingale herself was accused\r\nsuccessively, and with equal absurdity in each case, of being prejudiced\r\nfor, or against, Catholics and Protestants, and of being inimical to\r\nreligious ministrations altogether.[166] The Protestant charges of\r\nproselytizing by Catholic nurses were of course met by counter-charges\r\nof attempts by Protestant nurses to convert Roman Catholic patients;\r\nand finally a chaplain solemnly appealed to the War Department in London\r\nto remove one of Miss Nightingale's staff on the ground that the nurse\r\nhad been heard to avow herself a Socinian. Miss Nightingale protested\r\nsuccessfully against any such disciplinary measure, urging that the\r\nlady, whether Socinian or not, was an excellent nurse. Much of all this\r\nperverse disputing was born of sheer ignorance and intolerance. One of\r\nMiss Stanley's ladies was accused by a certain chaplain of \"circulating\r\nimproper books in the wards.\" Particulars were asked, and it was found\r\nthat the offending book was Keble's _Christian Year_.[167]\r\n\r\n  [164] See above, p. 192.\r\n\r\n  [165] _Grant_, p. 165.\r\n\r\n  [166] See the _Autobiography of a Balaclava Nurse_ (a Welshwoman), vol.\r\n        ii. p. 146.\r\n\r\n  [167] _Life and Letters of Dean Stanley_, vol. i. p. 492. There is a\r\n        curious echo of \"the Religious Difficulty\" in Purcell's _Life of\r\n        Manning_ (vol. ii. p. 53, 1st ed.), where a letter of Feb. 13,\r\n        1856, will be found from Manning to Cardinal Wiseman, discussing\r\n        whether Roman Catholic chaplains should or should not encourage\r\n        collections for the Nightingale Fund. The solution suggested was\r\n        \"to let the collection be _passively_ made without any\r\n        ecclesiastical recognition of it.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner was any one phase of the religious difficulty adjusted than\r\nanother appeared. There were Anglicans and Roman Catholics among the\r\nNightingale nurses, and there were others selected from English\r\nhospitals, who, so far as their religious views were concerned, might be\r\nanything or nothing. But why, it was asked, were there no Presbyterians?\r\nRepresentations were made to the War Office. \"I object,\" wrote Miss\r\nNightingale (Feb. 19, 1855), \"to the principle of sending out any one,\r\n_qua_ sectarian, not _qua_ nurse. But this having already been done in\r\nthe case of the R.C.'s, etc., I do not see how the Presbyterians can be\r\nrefused. And therefore let six trained nurses be sent out, if you think\r\nfit, of whom let two-thirds be Presbyterians. But I must bar these fat\r\ndrunken old dames. Above 14 stone we will not have; the provision of\r\nbedsteads is not strong enough. Three were nearly swamped in a caique,\r\nwhom Mr. Bracebridge was conducting to the ship, and, had he not walked\r\nwith the fear of the police before his eyes, he might easily have\r\nswamped them whole.\" The stout old dames were not Presbyterians; but,\r\nsad to relate, two of the Presbyterian party did turn out to be\r\nover-fond of drink, and Miss Nightingale had to return them to England.\r\nI regret to say that there were similar cases, not amongst the\r\nPresbyterians.\r\n\r\nThe charges and counter-charges of proselytism were referred by the\r\nchaplains to the Secretary of State. Lord Panmure, in reply (April 27,\r\n1855), had \"to say in the first place, that he has perused the\r\ncorrespondence with great regret, and that he deeply laments to find\r\nthat religious differences have arisen to such an extent as to mar the\r\nunited energies and labours of those who are devoting themselves with\r\nsuch disinterestedness and heroic courage and success to the relief of\r\nthe sick and wounded.\" The Minister then proceeded to promulgate\r\ninstructions designed to prevent any proselytism by the nurses and\r\nSisters. Unfortunately, his dispatch was so worded as to make things,\r\nfrom Miss Nightingale's point of view, no better, but rather worse. \"The\r\ninstructions,\" she wrote to Lady Canning (Sept. 9, 1855), \"have been so\r\ncompletely misunderstood that they have been my principal difficulty.\r\nThe R.C.'s who before were quite amenable have chosen to construe the\r\nrule that they 'are not to enter upon the discussion of religious\r\nsubjects with any patients other than those of their own faith,' to mean\r\ntherefore with _all_ of their own faith, and the second party of nuns\r\nwho came out now wander over the whole Hospital out of nursing hours,\r\nnot confining themselves to their own wards, nor even to patients, but\r\n'instructing' (it is their own word) groups of Orderlies and\r\nConvalescents in the corridors, doing the work each of ten chaplains,\r\nand bringing ridicule upon the whole thing, while they quote the words\r\nof the War Office.\" Lady Canning, who was at this time acting as Miss\r\nNightingale's agent for the enlistment of nurses, had proposed to embody\r\nLord Panmure's instructions in the printed Rules and Regulations. Miss\r\nNightingale begged her to do no such thing. I doubt not that Miss\r\nNightingale's own verbal instructions were less ambiguous. She was one\r\nwho never failed to say exactly what she meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nA great obstacle with which Miss Nightingale's work in the East had to\r\ncontend throughout was the scarcity at the time of properly trained\r\nnurses. She had long ago formed a resolve to remedy this defect; the\r\nseriousness of it was still further enforced upon her mind by painful\r\nexperience in the Crimean War; and her resolve was the more\r\nstrengthened. The religious difficulty--demanding that nurses\r\nshould be selected, to some extent, not _qua_ nurses, but _qua_\r\nsectarians--accentuated the obstacle of inadequate training, which,\r\nhowever, would in any case have existed. The case is excellently put, in\r\nterms which doubtless reflect Miss Nightingale's own views, in a letter\r\nfrom Lady Verney to Mrs. Gaskell (May 17, 1855):--\r\n\r\n     Until women have gone through a _real_ training, it is vain to hope\r\n     that four or five weeks in a Hospital can fit them for one of the\r\n     most difficult works that any one can be called on to undertake. I\r\n     cannot tell you the details, you can guess many of them; but when I\r\n     hear estimable people talking as if you could turn 40 women of all\r\n     ranks, degrees of virtue, and intelligence, into a Military\r\n     Hospital, with drunken orderlies, unmarried Chaplains, young\r\n     Surgeons, &c., &c., and expect that they are not more likely to be\r\n     unwise or tempted astray than the R.C. Sisters of Charity, who are\r\n     bound by well-considered vows, love of their kind and the fear of\r\n     Hell fire, then we feel that the \"estimable people\" have very\r\n     little knowledge of human nature. F.'s form of Sisterhood is\r\n     infinitely higher, I believe, than the R.C. and _will be carried\r\n     out_, I doubt no more than in her own existence, but as it must\r\n     exist without the checks and safeguards of the other and inferior\r\n     form, so it requires higher elements in the actors and a more\r\n     severe training and examination. Instead of which the loosest\r\n     possible choice takes place by people most excellent but not in the\r\n     least qualified to choose; goodwill and a \"love of nursing\" is\r\n     enough for the Lady class.\r\n\r\nIt is the fact, though it is not popularly known, that Miss Nightingale\r\nwas at this time strongly opposed to \"lady\" nurses. She objected to\r\nthem, not because they were ladies, but because they were unlikely to be\r\nwell trained. Pious and benevolent ladies were more given, she said, to\r\n\"spiritual flirtations with the patients,\" than apt at the proper\r\nbusiness of surgical nursing. It was the trained hospital nurses that\r\nshe preferred. There were among the 125 women who passed through her\r\nhands in the East more efficient and less, and in so large a flock there\r\nwere some black sheep. But amongst the band, in all classes and of all\r\ndenominations, there were devoted and competent women, whose services\r\ndeserve to be held in grateful remembrance beside those of their\r\nLady-in-Chief. And as I have had to record Miss Nightingale's criticism\r\nupon some of the Roman Catholics among her flock, it should be added\r\nthat of others she wrote to Mr. Herbert: \"They are the truest Christians\r\nI ever met with--invaluable in their work--devoted, heart and head, to\r\nserve God and mankind--not to intrigue for their Church.\" To the\r\nReverend Superior, who came out from Bermondsey with the first party of\r\nnuns, Miss Nightingale was particularly attached. \"She writes,\" said\r\nCardinal Wiseman, \"that great part of her success is due to Rev. Mother\r\nof Bermondsey, without whom it would have been a failure.\"[168]\r\n\r\n  [168] Wilfred Ward's _Life of Wiseman_, vol. ii. p. 191. And see\r\n        Miss Nightingale's own words given below, p. 299.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of Miss Nightingale's work, touched upon in this chapter,\r\nadds another to the accumulation of difficulties with which she had to\r\ndeal. It was the one which troubled her most. \"In this sink of misery,\r\nin this tussle of life or death,\" she felt the bitter futility of\r\npersonal grievances and religious differences. It is worry, more than\r\nwork, that kills; and the religious difficulty was perhaps the last\r\nstraw which caused the Lady-in-Chief to break down, as we shall hear in\r\nthe next chapter, under her heavy load of responsibility and care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                          TO THE CRIMEA--ILLNESS\r\n\r\n                             (May-August 1855)\r\n\r\n\r\n     For myself, I have done my duty. I have identified my fate with\r\n     that of the heroic dead.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (private notes,\r\n     1855).\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1855 Miss Nightingale decided to leave Scutari for a\r\nwhile in order to visit the hospitals in the Crimea. The conditions at\r\nScutari were now greatly improved. Sanitary works had been executed. The\r\nhospitals were better supplied. The pressure in the wards, caused by the\r\nterrible winter before Sebastopol, was relieved. There were only 1100\r\ncases in the Barrack Hospital, and of those only 100 were in bed. The\r\nrate of mortality had fallen from 42 per _cent_ to 22 per _thousand_ of\r\nthe cases treated. The siege was likely soon to be accompanied by\r\nassaults, and the pressure might rather be in the hospitals at\r\nBalaclava, where the sick and wounded were if possible to remain, in\r\norder to avoid the sufferings of the sea passage to Scutari.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Crimea, besides the regimental hospitals, there were four general\r\nhospitals. There was the _General Hospital_ at Balaclava, established\r\nafter the British occupation in September 1854. There was the _Castle\r\nHospital_, consisting of huts on the \"Genoese heights\" above Balaclava,\r\nopened in April 1855. There was the _Hospital of St. George's\r\nMonastery_, also consisting of huts, intended for convalescent and\r\nophthalmic cases; and, lastly, there were the _Hospitals of the Land\r\nTransport Corps_, again consisting of huts, near Karani. All these\r\nhospitals had a complement of female nurses, though the Monastery\r\nHospital not until December 1855, and the Land Transport Hospitals not\r\nuntil 1856. In the spring of 1855, then, there were already female\r\nnurses at the General Hospital and the Castle Hospital, under their own\r\nsuperintendents, but all ultimately responsible to Miss Nightingale--as\r\nshe apprehended, and as the War Office intended. She was now anxious to\r\ninspect these hospitals; to increase the efficiency of the female\r\nnursing establishments; and, in particular, to introduce those washing\r\nand cooking arrangements which had been productive of so much benefit at\r\nScutari. Her visit of inspection was approved by the War Office; and, by\r\ninstructions dated April 27, she was invested with full authority as\r\nAlmoner of the Free Gifts in all the British Hospitals in the Crimea.\r\nBut in other respects her position was somewhat ambiguous. The original\r\ninstructions, issued by Mr. Herbert, had named her as Superintendent of\r\nthe female nurses in all the British military hospitals _in Turkey_; and\r\nthese words gave a standing-ground to her opponents in the Crimea. The\r\nintention of the War Office was to give her general superintendence, but\r\nto relieve her of direct responsibility for the nurses in the Crimea so\r\nlong as she was at Scutari. The matter was not, however, cleared up till\r\na later date,[169] and the indefiniteness of her position in the Crimea\r\nexposed her to infinite worry and intrigues.\r\n\r\n  [169] See below, p. 292.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, Miss Nightingale set forth from Scutari, where Mrs.\r\nBracebridge was left in charge:--\r\n\r\n     \"Poor old Flo,\" Miss Nightingale wrote from the Black Sea, May 5,\r\n     1855, \"steaming up the Bosphorus and across the Black Sea with four\r\n     nurses, two cooks, and a boy to Crim Tartary (to overhaul the\r\n     Regimental Hospitals) in the _Robert Lowe_ or _Robert Slow_ (for an\r\n     exceedingly slow boat she is), taking back 420 of her patients, a\r\n     draught of convalescents returning to their regiments to be shot at\r\n     again. 'A Mother in Israel,' Pastor Fliedner called me; a Mother in\r\n     the Coldstreams, is the more appropriate appellation. What\r\n     suggestions do the above ideas make to you in Embley drawing-room?\r\n     Stranger ones perhaps than to me, who, on the 5th May, year of\r\n     disgrace 1855, having been at Scutari six months to-day, am in\r\n     sympathy with God, fulfilling the purpose I came into the world\r\n     for. What the disappointments of the conclusion of these six\r\n     months are no one can tell. But I am not dead, but alive.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was accompanied to the Crimea by the faithful Mr.\r\nBracebridge, willing as ever to serve her. Among the nurses was Mrs.\r\nRoberts, whose exceptional efficiency and personal devotion to the\r\nLady-in-Chief were soon to be called in need. Of the cooks, the chief\r\nwas Soyer the Great, from whose cheerfully gossiping and pleasantly\r\negotistical pages[170] some details are drawn in this chapter. The \"boy\"\r\nmentioned in Miss Nightingale's letter was Thomas, a drummer, who,\r\nthough only twelve years of age, used to call himself \"Miss\r\nNightingale's Man.\" He was a regular _enfant de troupe_, says M. Soyer,\r\nfull of activity, wit, intelligence, and glee. He would draw himself up\r\nto his full height, and explain that he had \"forsaken his instruments in\r\norder to devote his civil and military career to Miss Nightingale.\" She\r\nwas attended also by a soldier invalided from the 68th Light Infantry,\r\nwhom Mr. Bracebridge had picked out to serve as messenger. In 1860 he\r\nwrote a manuscript account of his experiences in the Crimea,[171] and\r\nthis is another first-hand source from which particulars are drawn in\r\nthe present chapter. The party arrived at Balaclava on May 5, and the\r\ndecks of vessels in the harbour were crowded with spectators anxious to\r\ncatch a glimpse of the famous Lady-in-Chief. There was no accommodation\r\nfor her ashore; so her headquarters were on board the _Robert Lowe_, and\r\nwhen that vessel left, on the sailing transport _London_.\r\n\r\n  [170] See Bibliography B, No. 15.\r\n\r\n  [171] Robert Robinson, on his return to England, was sent to school and\r\n        an agricultural college by Miss Nightingale, and obtained\r\n        employment on Lord Berners's estate in Scotland. Miss Nightingale\r\n        was constantly befriending him, _e.g._ in paying his expenses for\r\n        a visit to London to see the Exhibition of 1862, and in sending him\r\n        illustrated newspapers, and even the _Times_. There was another\r\n        Crimean lad, besides Tommy, one William Jones, with a wooden leg.\r\n        See below, p. 304, where account is also given of another protégé,\r\n        Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale set to work immediately, and with characteristic\r\nenergy. One of her first duties was a visit of ceremony to Lord Raglan.\r\nShe was a good horsewoman, and as a girl had been fond of riding. She\r\nwas now mounted \"upon a very pretty mare, which, by its gambols and\r\ncaracoling, seemed proud to carry its noble charge, and our cavalcade\r\nproduced an extraordinary effect upon the motley crowd of all nations\r\nassembled at Balaclava, who were astonished at seeing a lady so well\r\nescorted.\" Was not the great Soyer himself among the escort? The\r\nCommander of the Forces was away, but Miss Nightingale was taken to the\r\nThree Mortar Battery, and the soldiers, as she passed, gave her three\r\ntimes three. This visit to the front made a profound and indelible\r\nimpression upon her.[172] It is first recorded in a letter of May 10,\r\nwhich was forwarded to Windsor Castle.[173] \"Fancy,\" she wrote, \"working\r\nfive nights out of seven in the trenches! Fancy being 36 hours in them\r\nat a stretch, as they were all December, lying down, or half lying down,\r\noften 48 hours with no food but _raw_ salt pork, sprinkled with sugar,\r\nrum, and biscuit; nothing hot, because the exhausted soldier could not\r\ncollect his own fuel, as he was expected to do, to cook his own ration;\r\nand fancy through all this the army preserving their courage and\r\npatience as they have done, and being now eager (the old ones more than\r\nthe young ones) to be led even into the trenches. There was something\r\nsublime in the spectacle.\" \"When I see the camp,\" she wrote to Lady\r\nCanning (May 10), \"I wonder not that the army suffered so much, but that\r\nthere is any army left at all; but now all is looking up. Sir John\r\nM'Neill has done wonders.\" With Sir John M'Neill, a doctor who\r\nafterwards entered the Political Service in the East, Miss Nightingale\r\nformed a great friendship. He, with Colonel Tulloch, had been sent out\r\nto the Crimea by Lord Palmerston's Government to report upon the\r\nCommissariat system.\r\n\r\n  [172] See, _e.g._, below, pp. 317, 488, and Vol. II. p. 411.\r\n\r\n  [173] Found among the Prince Consort's papers, and printed in\r\n        Sir Theodore Martin's _Life_ of him, vol. iii. p. 214.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, on this and her later visits to the Crimea, saw and\r\nheard of many deeds of heroism which she loved to tell. \"I remember,\"\r\nshe wrote, \"a sergeant, who was on picket, the rest of the picket\r\nkilled, and himself battered about the head, stumbled back to camp, and\r\non his way picked up a wounded man, and brought him in on his shoulders\r\nto the lines, where he fell down insensible. When, after many hours, he\r\nrecovered his senses, I believe after trepanning, his first words were\r\nto ask after his comrade, 'Is he alive?' 'Comrade, indeed! yes, he's\r\nalive, it is the General.' At that moment the General, though badly\r\nwounded, appeared at the bedside. 'Oh, General, it's you, is it, I\r\nbrought in, I'm so glad. I didn't know your honour, but if I'd known it\r\nwas you, I'd have saved you all the same.' This is the true soldier's\r\nspirit.\"[174]\r\n\r\n  [174] Letter on the Volunteers, 1861. See Bibliography A, No. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nDuring the few days immediately after her arrival at Balaclava, Miss\r\nNightingale carried on an active investigation of the hospitals,\r\nregimental and general; arranged various affairs in connection with the\r\nsisters and nurses; discussed the building of new huts; and, in\r\nconjunction with M. Soyer, planned the erection of several kitchens for\r\nextra diet. Here, as at Scutari, she was fearless of contagion, and\r\ntended patients stricken with fever. On return to her ship one evening\r\nshe complained of great fatigue; and on the following morning, feeling\r\nno better, she sent for Dr. Anderson, Chief Medical Officer at the\r\nGeneral Hospital. He called others of the medical staff into\r\nconsultation, and a joint bulletin was issued to the effect that Miss\r\nNightingale was suffering from Crimean fever. They advised that she\r\nshould be removed from the ship, and she was carried on a stretcher by\r\nrelays of soldiers to the Castle Hospital on the Genoese Heights. The\r\nhut in which she lay was immediately behind those of the wounded\r\nsoldiers. The attack of fever was sharp, and she was, as she afterwards\r\nadmitted to her friends, \"very near to death.\" There are scraps of\r\nmanuscript among her papers (for even in illness she could not be kept\r\nfrom the use of her pen) which show a wandering mind.\r\n\r\nThe news of Miss Nightingale's illness was received with consternation\r\nin England, and the anxiety of her friends was intense, though Lord\r\nRaglan had thoughtfully arranged that a telegraphic dispatch from him\r\nshould not reach them till, after two or three days of the fever, the\r\ndoctors were able to hold out hopes of recovery. \"Sitting to-day,\" wrote\r\nher sister to a friend, from Embley (May 27), \"in the little Vicarage\r\nwoodhouse, waiting for the people to come out from church (for we were\r\nnot up to the whole service), in order to go in to the Communion which\r\nshe loves so well, and which we always take with her and God, and which\r\nshe is taking in spirit or reality to-day if she is alive, and if not is\r\ntaking in a higher and happier sense--Mama said, 'I thank God she is\r\nready for life or for death'; and in that, dear, we truly strive to\r\nrest, though the spirit would quail, I am afraid, if there were not hope\r\nat the bottom.\" The anxiety in the War Hospitals was scarcely less. \"The\r\nsoldiers turned their faces to the wall,\" said one, \"and cried.\" The\r\ncrisis passed, and on May 24 Lord Raglan was able to telegraph home that\r\nthe patient was out of danger, and three days later that she was going\r\non favourably. The bulletins were forwarded to the Queen, and on May 28\r\nHer Majesty, in writing to Lord Panmure, was \"truly thankful to learn\r\nthat excellent and valuable person, Miss Nightingale, is safe.\"[175] At\r\nthis time a horseman rode up to her hut, and the nurse, Mrs. Roberts,\r\nwho had been enjoined to keep the patient quiet, refused to let him in.\r\nHe said that he most particularly desired to see Miss Nightingale. \"And\r\npray,\" said Mrs. Roberts, \"who are you?\" \"Ah, only a soldier,\" replied\r\nthe visitor, \"but I have ridden a long way, and your patient knows me\r\nvery well.\" He was admitted, and a month later was himself laid low and\r\ndied. It was Lord Raglan.\r\n\r\n  [175] _Panmure Papers_, vol. i. p. 215.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, on becoming convalescent, was strongly advised by the\r\ndoctors to take a voyage to England. She would not listen to such\r\nadvice. Her work at the front had but just begun, and she was resolved\r\nto return to it after the shortest possible delay. The voyage to the\r\nBosphorus was the longest that she could be induced to take. Her good\r\nMrs. Bracebridge had arrived from Scutari just in time to accompany her\r\nfriend on the return voyage. Lord Ward, whose steam-yacht was in harbour\r\nat the time, pressed the use of it upon her, and in it she was taken to\r\nScutari. When the yacht reached Scutari, all the high officials were\r\npresent to meet it. One of the large barges, used to remove the sick and\r\nwounded, was brought alongside, and Miss Nightingale, in a state of\r\nextreme weakness and exhaustion, was lowered into it. At the pier\r\nsoldiers were in readiness, who carried her on a stretcher to the\r\nchaplain's house, followed by a large and sympathetic crowd. \"I do not\r\nremember anything during the campaign,\" wrote the good-hearted Soyer,\r\n\"so gratifying to the feelings as that simple though grand procession.\"\r\n\"Ah,\" said a soldier, \"there was no sadder sight than to see that dear\r\nlady carried up from the pier on a stretcher just like we men, and\r\nperhaps by some of the fellows she nursed herself.\"[176] It was the same\r\nwhen she was presently moved from Scutari to the shore in order to go to\r\nTherapia, where the Ambassador had placed his summer residence at her\r\ndisposal. She was carried in a litter by four guardsmen, but, though it\r\nwas only five minutes' walk to the shore, there were two relays, and her\r\nbaggage was divided among twelve soldiers, though two could easily have\r\ncarried the whole,[177] so great was the desire of the men to share in\r\nthe honour of helping the Lady-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  [176] _Blackwood_, p. 115.\r\n\r\n  [177] _Memoirs of Lady Eastlake_, vol. ii. p. 44.\r\n\r\nHer recovery was gradual, and her weakness great. Mrs. Bracebridge\r\ndescribed her as unable to feed herself or speak above a whisper. The\r\nextreme exhaustion was more from the previous overstrain on mind and\r\nbody than from the fever, the doctors said, and they recommended\r\ncomplete change and rest. Mr. Sidney Herbert wrote, imploring her to\r\ncome home for two months: \"We are delighted,\" wrote her mother (July 9),\r\n\"to think of you at Therapia. Oh, my love, how I trust that you will,\r\namong the numerous lessons which your life has been spent in learning,\r\nbe able to perfect that most difficult one of standing and waiting.\" She\r\nwas to be lessoned in that form of service, but not till after many\r\nmore years of arduous labour, and for the present she would not hear of\r\nany return to England. The feeling of the soldiers for her touched her\r\nso deeply that she could not bear, she said, to leave them. Gradually\r\nshe recovered strength. \"We have a charming account,\" wrote her sister\r\n(Aug. 21), \"from Lothian Nicholson just ordered out to Crimea, who is\r\nquite enthusiastic, dear old boy, about her good looks, which, as all\r\nher hair has been cut off, is good testimony--'her own smile,' he talks\r\nof, and says he can hardly believe she has gone through such a winter.\r\nThe dear Bracebridges say that her improvement in the last week was\r\ndelightful and wonderful.\" Already, in July, her business letters were\r\nresumed. In August she was in the full rush of work again. The doctors\r\nand her friends still besought her to take rest. But her indomitable\r\nspirit would listen to no counsels of retreat. The end of the war was\r\nnot yet in sight. Even Sebastopol had not yet fallen. So long as there\r\nremained sick and wounded in the Levant to be cared for, she was\r\nresolved to remain also. A soldier was told that the Lady-in-Chief would\r\nprobably be sent home. \"But how will they _pairt_ with her,\" he said,\r\n\"what'll they do without her? they set all their hopes on she.\" There\r\nwere nurses, too, naturally anxious to rejoin their families or friends\r\nat home, who said that, if she went, they would go. The presence of Miss\r\nNightingale, with her lofty ideals and inspiring self-devotion, was the\r\nattraction which kept many of these women at their posts. Some had\r\nalready died. Mrs. Elizabeth Drake, one of the nurses whom Miss\r\nNightingale had taken with her to the Crimea, died on August 9 of low\r\nfever at Balaclava. \"I cannot tell you,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to the\r\nMaster of St. John's House (Aug. 16, 1855), \"what I felt when I heard of\r\nher death, unexpected alike by all. Her two physicians thought her going\r\non well, and I expected her in every convoy that came down from\r\nBalaclava, as she was coming to me to recruit. I have lost in her the\r\nbest of all the women here. Once I proposed to her to go home, but she\r\nscouted the idea entirely and said her health was better here than in\r\nEngland. I feel like a criminal in having robbed you of one so truly to\r\nbe loved and honoured. It seemed as if it pleased God to remove from\r\nthe work those who have been most useful to it. His will be done!\" Nurse\r\nDrake's body was brought to Scutari, and Miss Nightingale erected a\r\nsmall marble cross over it in the cemetery. It was no time, when members\r\nof the rank-and-file were falling at the post of duty, for the chief to\r\nlisten to counsels of medical prudence. Nor, indeed, at any time did\r\nMiss Nightingale harbour even a passing thought of what would have\r\nseemed to her an act of military desertion. She remained till the end of\r\nthe war came, and till the last transport had sailed; working\r\nindefatigably as ever, and in some respects in new spheres of\r\nusefulness, both in the Crimea and at Scutari; to what good effect we\r\nshall hear in later chapters, but at great cost to her own comfort and\r\nbodily strength. She had been appointed, as she used to say, to a\r\nsubsidiary post in the Queen's Army[178]; the humblest post, it might\r\nbe, but still a post of duty. The men had dared and suffered; and\r\nFlorence Nightingale was resolved to show that a woman too had strength\r\nto suffer and endure.\r\n\r\n  [178] She was especially pleased when in March 1856 her name appeared\r\n        for the first time in General Orders; see below, p. 293.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks of convalescence at Scutari, Miss Nightingale used\r\nsometimes to walk at evening on the shore, in full sight of that view\r\nwhich, when she had first come there, they told her was the finest in\r\nthe world, but which, in the crush of work, she had no time to\r\nenjoy.[179] She sent a letter to her people at home describing one such\r\nevening walk, and it was read out in the family circle. Lady Byron, who\r\nwas staying with them at the time, heard it read, and said that it was\r\n\"like a hymn--simple and deep-toned.\" She described how, on the opposite\r\nside, the city of Constantinople was defined against the burning sky of\r\nthe setting sun, but the outline was changed by the fall of some mounds\r\nin an earthquake. Near her were the graves of the heroic dead, the\r\nthousands with whom, she said, she felt identified. \"It went into my\r\nheart,\" wrote Lady Byron, \"as the poetry of fact--for she has made\r\npoetry fact.\" The letter went on to speak of the British burying-ground\r\nat Scutari, and Miss Nightingale added these lines:--\r\n\r\n              \"They are not here!\" No, not beneath that sod,\r\n                  And yet not far away,\r\n              For they can mingle their new life from God\r\n                  With living souls, not clay.\r\n\r\n              And they, \"the heroic dead,\" will softly pour\r\n                  Into thy spirit's ear\r\n              A music human still, but sad no more,\r\n                  To tell thee they are near--\r\n\r\n              Near thee with higher ministering aid\r\n                  Thy heart-work to return,\r\n              So that each sacrifice that love has made\r\n                  A victory shall earn![180]\r\n\r\n  [179] Above, p. 173.\r\n\r\n  [180] The words in inverted commas were quotations from Miss\r\n        Nightingale's letters. These had been shown to a friend, who\r\n        thereupon wrote the lines, above quoted, and sent them to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                            THE POPULAR HEROINE\r\n\r\n\r\n     Miss Nightingale looks to her reward from this country in having a\r\n     fresh field for her labours, and means of extending the good that\r\n     she has already begun. A compliment cannot be paid dearer to her\r\n     heart than in giving her work to do.--SIDNEY HERBERT.\r\n\r\nThe news of Miss Nightingale's illness spread sympathetic anxiety\r\nthroughout Great Britain. Even more than when her mission of mercy was\r\nfirst announced, she became the popular heroine; and more than ever men\r\nand women of all classes sought means of showing their sympathy.\r\n\r\nLady Verney, whose depth of feeling is not concealed by the play of\r\nhumour which sparkles pleasantly upon the surface, described,\r\nsuccessively, the penalties and the pleasures of being the sister of a\r\nheroine:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss F. P. Nightingale to Miss Ellen Tollet._) EMBLEY, _Friday_\r\n     [_Summer of 1855_]. I am quite _done_ with writing, a second blast\r\n     of linen and knitted socks was nearly the death of me, and 'hints,'\r\n     my dear!--oh, my horror of being asked for hints,--such as \"can\r\n     newspapers be put into the post free?\" and such like _niaiseries_.\r\n     How grateful I am to you for never once having inquired whether\r\n     socks or muffetees are most required, and whether you are safe in\r\n     sending 6 towels and an old tablecloth to London, or whether they\r\n     had better come to us. It sounds very ungrateful, I am afraid, but\r\n     when one's wrist aches over the two hundredth repetition of the\r\n     matter, I do wish the public would apply to the nearest post\r\n     office, or read that scarce and erudite work the _Times_, and use\r\n     their sense not their pens.\r\n\r\n     However, these words are only when I am cross at having been\r\n     prevented from writing to the folk I love, such as thee, of the\r\n     progress of Scutari. Else generally the feeling in every soul, so\r\n     wide and so deep, touches us more than I can tell, and helps us\r\n     over the inevitable weight of the anxiety more than I thought\r\n     possible--heavy, redfaced, old fox-hunting Squires, who never had a\r\n     \"sentiment\" in their lives, come with their eyes full of tears;\r\n     narrow-minded Farmers with _both_ eyes on the main chance are\r\n     melted; young ladies who never got beyond balls and concerts are\r\n     warmed. Dearest, I do feel of the feeling she has raised, it\r\n     blesseth \"him here who gives and those out there who take,\" and\r\n     will do good wider than one hoped. I can't so much as write for a\r\n     dispatch box for her (thinking an official of her scale must want\r\n     one for her papers) without its coming back full of pretty little\r\n     match boxes as an offering, and wrapped in a large contribution of\r\n     old sheets.... I must give you the cream of this last three or four\r\n     days' letters. Firstly, Mr. Hookham, the bookseller, sending down a\r\n     parcel, says he \"trusts to hear of the return of Miss N., as he\r\n     does not think, though convalescent, she can get well on the shores\r\n     of Bosphorus or Black Sea; that a General or Admiral can be\r\n     replaced, but there can be no successor to Miss N., her skill, her\r\n     fortitude, her courage cannot be replaced. I speak of courage in\r\n     the most exalted sense that it is possible to characterise the\r\n     bravery and devotion of woman.\" Then comes a letter from a\r\n     shipowner in the north of Scotland going to launch a vessel, and\r\n     wanting to call it after her, sends to have her name quite\r\n     \"correct.\" Next, Lady Dunsany saying that \"Joan of Arc was not more\r\n     a creation of the moment and _for_ the moment than F. Joan's was\r\n     the same unearthly influence carrying all before its spirit\r\n     might--Joan's was the same strange and sexless identity, which,\r\n     belonging as it were neither to man nor woman, seemed to disembody\r\n     and combine the _choicest results_ of both, and then to sweep down\r\n     conventionalities, prejudices, and pruderies, with the clear, cold,\r\n     crystal sceptre of its _majestic purity_. Joan's mission, too, was\r\n     the condensation of her country's moral and intellectual power in\r\n     the person of a young and single woman when the men of that country\r\n     were so many of them imbecile and effete! I think my parallel runs\r\n     pretty close.\" Lord Dunsany adds that he has no time to write, so\r\n     he says, \"ditto to Mrs. Burke,\" and that I know he is \"fanatico\r\n     for Joan of Arc rediviva, God bless her.\" Then a bit from Lady\r\n     Byron, saying, \"even her illness will advance her work as all\r\n     things must for those who do all with His aid,\" and more that is\r\n     most beautiful. Then 2 copies of the _History of Women_, with\r\n     portrait of Miss N. to be sent to her \"from the author,\" and a\r\n     flaming extract from a County paper in a pamphlet, _Stroll to Lea\r\n     Hurst_, 20 copies ditto, ditto, and a majestic effusion from the\r\n     family grocer about \"heroic conduct,\" \"brave and noble Miss N.,\"\r\n     \"identified with Crimean success and sad disasters,\" \"posterity,\"\r\n     \"arm of civilisation,\" \"rampant barbarism,\" &c. &c., and so on.\r\n\r\n     (_To Florence Nightingale._) _Dec._ 8 [1855]. It has been curious\r\n     (as your representative) how our Burlington Street room has seen\r\n     Manning and Maurice, Mr. Best and the Chancellor, Lady Amelia Jebb\r\n     and Mrs. Herbert, Lady Byron and Lady Canning, the extremes of all\r\n     kinds crowding in to help you in every way that they could devise.\r\n     Then come in tradespeople, all so intent on you; and working folk,\r\n     your stoutest supporters, and those you will care most for. And we\r\n     are tenderly treated and affectionately welcomed by one and all of\r\n     all classes and opinions for your sake, my dear, and very sweet to\r\n     me is kindliness for your dear sake; it seems as if it were part of\r\n     you coming to meet me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nBut Miss Nightingale's popularity was not limited to such circles as\r\nthose in which her family moved. Letters from soldiers in the Crimea had\r\nmade her known in thousands of humble homes, and she became the heroine\r\nof the cottage, the workshop, and the alleys. Old soldiers dropped into\r\npoetry about her, and rhymed broadsheets, with rough woodcuts of the\r\nLady with the Lamp, issued from printers in Seven Dials and Soho. One of\r\nthese songs, entitled \"The Nightingale in the East,\" and intended to go\r\nto the tune of \"The Cottage and Water Mill,\" was especially popular with\r\nits refrain:--\r\n\r\n       So forward, my lads, may your hearts never fail,\r\n       You are cheer'd by the presence of a sweet Nightingale.[181]\r\n\r\n  [181] For the text see Bibliography B, No. 7. An article in the\r\n        _Quarterly Review_ of April 1867, entitled \"The Nightingale in the\r\n        East,\" is \"a study of the Poetry of Seven Dials.\" The popular ditty\r\n        about Miss Nightingale has been sung under many skies and to many\r\n        audiences; never to greater effect than on Christmas Day 1870 in\r\n        St. Thomas's Hospital (then in the Surrey Gardens). The nurses had\r\n        arranged a Christmas treat; the children had sung hymns, and older\r\n        patients had given popular songs of the day. A patient in the\r\n        Accident Ward, a coal-heaver with a broken leg, then volunteered;\r\n        when the words of the refrain caught the ears of the Nightingale\r\n        nurses, \"we dropped all work\" (says one of them), \"and listened\r\n        intently till the song was over, all enthusiasm for our Chief.\"\r\n        The singer told them that he was an old soldier, and had been\r\n        nursed by Miss Nightingale in the General Hospital at Balaclava.\r\n\r\nThen from the same class of printing-offices there issued \"Price One\r\nPenny, The Only and Unabridged Edition of the Life of Miss Nightingale,\r\nDetailing her Christian Heroic Deeds in the Land of Tumult and Death,\r\nwhich has made her name most deservedly Immortal, not only in England,\r\nbut in all Civilized Parts of the World, winning the Prayers of the\r\nSoldier, the Widow, and the Orphan.\" The poets and biographers were not\r\nonly in Seven Dials. The Poet's Corner of every newspaper, from _Punch_\r\nand the _Spectator_ to the smallest country journal, was devoted to the\r\npraise of the heroine. Ingenious triflers were at work, and it was found\r\nthat her anagram was indeed, as an old definition has it, poesie\r\ntransferred, and Florence Nightingale became \"Flit on, cheering angel.\"\r\nPrize poems at the universities pictured her, in the manner of such\r\ncompositions, walking fearlessly\r\n\r\n           Where strong men tremble and where brave hearts fail.\r\n\r\nThen the musicians took up the Popular Heroine, and both now, and after\r\nher return from the Crimea, sentimental songs, set to music, were\r\ninscribed to her: \"Angels with Sweet Approving Smiles,\" \"The Shadow on\r\nthe Pillow,\" \"The Soldier's Widow,\" \"The Woman's Smile,\" \"The Soldier's\r\nCheer\"--this latter \"played by the band of the 97th Regiment,\"--\"Die\r\nSoldaten Lebewohl,\" \"The Star of the East,\" and so forth. The stationers\r\nfollowed in the wake of the printers, and brought out note-paper with a\r\npicture of Florence Nightingale as the water-mark, or with lithographed\r\nviews of \"Lea Hurst, her home.\" Portraits of her were eagerly sought;\r\nand as the family were unwilling to supply them, likenesses had to be\r\ninvented to adorn sentimental prints. Life-boats and emigrant-ships were\r\nchristened _The Florence Nightingale_. Children, streets, valses, and\r\nrace-horses were named after her. \"The Forest Plate Handicap was won by\r\nMiss Nightingale, beating Barbarity and nine others.\" Tradesmen printed\r\nportraits and short lives of her on their paper bags. At Fairs there\r\nwere \"Grand Exhibitions of Miss Florence Nightingale administering to\r\nthe Sick and Wounded.\" China figures, with no recognizable likeness to\r\nher, but inscribed \"Florence Nightingale,\" were put on sale. The public\r\nwould not be denied. \"Yes, indeed,\" wrote Lady Verney to her sister,\r\n\"the people love you with a sort of passionate tenderness that goes to\r\nmy heart.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale did not relish all this. They had sent her various\r\nsupplies for the sick, and also a packet of \"Lives,\" \"Portraits,\" and\r\nthe like to Scutari. \"My effigies and praises,\" she wrote in reply,\r\n\"were less welcome. I do not affect indifference to real sympathy, but I\r\nhave felt painfully, the more painfully since I have had time to hear of\r\nit, the éclat which has been given to this adventure. The small still\r\nbeginning, the simple hardship, the silent and _gradual_ struggle\r\nupwards, these are the climate in which an enterprise really thrives and\r\ngrows. Time has not altered our Saviour's lesson on that point, which\r\nhas been learnt successively by all reformers from their own experience.\r\nThe vanity and frivolity which the éclat thrown upon this affair has\r\ncalled forth has done us unmitigated harm, and has brought mischief on\r\n(perhaps) one of the most promising enterprises that ever set sail from\r\nEngland. Our own old party which began its work in hardship, toil,\r\nstruggle, and obscurity has done better than any other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nWhen it became known in England that Miss Nightingale had recovered from\r\nher illness, and had resolved to remain at her post until the end of the\r\nwar, a movement at once sprang up for marking in some public manner the\r\nnation's appreciation of her services and her devotion. There was at\r\nfirst some idea, as Lady Verney wrote, of a personal testimonial in the\r\n\"teapot and bracelet\" kind. Mrs. Herbert, who was consulted in the\r\nmatter, knew her friend well enough to be certain that Miss Nightingale\r\nwould decline to accept any such proposal. The only form of testimonial\r\nto which she would ever listen was something to enable her the better to\r\ncarry on her work for others. Miss Nightingale was written to, and\r\nreplied, in accordance with Mrs. Herbert's expectation, that she must\r\nabsolutely decline any testimonial of a personal character. Her friends\r\nknew well that what she would best like was the establishment in one\r\nform or another of \"an English Kaiserswerth.\" This suggestion was\r\naccordingly put before her, and she was asked to submit a plan. Her\r\nreply was, again, very characteristic. Immersed in the crowded work of\r\nthe moment, she was in no mood to make future plans; but she took the\r\nearliest opportunity of intimating that, whatever the plan might be, she\r\nmust be the autocrat of it. \"Dr. Bence-Jones has written to me,\" she\r\nsaid (Sept. 27), \"for a plan. People seem to think that I have nothing\r\nto do but to sit here and form plans. If the public choose to recognize\r\nmy services and my judgment in this manner, they must leave those\r\nservices and that judgment unfettered.\" She was experiencing enough of\r\nfetters in the East to last her for a lifetime. An influential Committee\r\nwas formed, on which Mr. Sidney Herbert and Mr. S. C. Hall served as\r\nhonorary secretaries, and it was decided to raise a fund for the\r\nestablishment of some School for Nurses, under a Council, to be\r\nnominated by Miss Nightingale. A public meeting was called for November\r\n29, 1855, at Willis's Rooms, \"to give expression to a general feeling\r\nthat the services of Miss Nightingale in the hospitals of the East\r\ndemand the grateful recognition of the British people.\" The room proved\r\nfar too small. It was crowded to suffocation; and never, said the\r\n_Times_, in reporting the meeting, had a more brilliant, enthusiastic,\r\nand unanimous gathering been held in London.\r\n\r\n\"Burlington St., this 29th of November,\" wrote Mrs. Nightingale to\r\nFlorence, \"the most interesting day of thy mother's life. It is very\r\nlate, my child, but I cannot go to bed without telling you that your\r\nmeeting has been a glorious one. I believe that you will be more\r\nindifferent than any of us to your fame, but be glad that we feel this\r\nis a proud day for us; for the like has never happened before, but will,\r\nI trust, from your example, gladden the hearts of many future mothers.\r\nOne thing will rejoice you. We were all as anxious as you were there\r\nthat the good Bracebridges' devoted love should be publicly recognized,\r\nand Sidney Herbert has taken this occasion to do it most gracefully. The\r\nDuke of Cambridge was in the chair and made a simple, manly speech.\r\nSidney Herbert's delighted every one. Lord Stanley, the Duke of Argyll,\r\nand Sir J. Pakington spoke capitally. Monckton Milnes was very touching.\r\nLord Lansdowne as good as in his best days. All seemed inspired by their\r\nsubject. Parthe and I, though we could not take courage to go\r\nourselves, staid it over; our informants came flocking in, and we were\r\nrewarded.\" \"Fancy if you can,\" wrote Mr. Nightingale to his sister, \"our\r\njoy at the universal oneness of the meeting which has honoured Flo with\r\nits absolute fiat of 'Well done' and well to do. I am not apt to be\r\neasily satisfied with the things which I see and feel or hear or think,\r\nbut all people seem to agree that there was _there_ nothing wanting.\"\r\n\r\nThe speeches deserve, I think, all that the proud mother said of them.\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert's was, perhaps, the best, if one can judge from the\r\nreports; and certainly it is the best remembered, for in the course of\r\nit he read out the soldier's letter, which, as mentioned already (p.\r\n237), became famous throughout the world. But \"the truest thing,\" as\r\nLady Verney wrote to her sister, \"was said by Monckton Milnes. He said\r\nthat too much had been made of the sacrifice of position and luxury in\r\nyour case.\" How true that was is known to all who have read the first\r\npart of this volume. \"God knows,\" said Mr. Milnes, \"that the luxury of\r\none good action must to a mind such as hers be more than equivalent for\r\nthe loss of all the pomps and vanities of life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Milnes, with the touch of a poet and the feeling of a friend,\r\nsaid another very true thing. He drew a contrast between the crowded and\r\nbrilliant scene before him, and \"the scene which met the gaze of that\r\nnoble woman, who was now devoting herself to the service of her\r\nsuffering fellow-creatures on the black shores of Crim Tartary,\r\noverlooking the waters of the inhospitable sea.\" She was grateful for\r\nsympathy; but the glitter of praise and reputation was as nothing, or\r\nless than nothing, to her. She was wrestling by those bleak shores with\r\ndisease and death, wrestling, too, with jealousies and intrigues and\r\nother difficulties. She cared for no recognition, except in so far as it\r\ncould help her in her work. A contribution of £1000 to her private fund,\r\nsent by the people of New Zealand in November, greatly pleased her. \"If\r\nmy name,\" she wrote to her parents, \"and my having done what I could for\r\nGod and mankind has given you pleasure, that is real pleasure to me. My\r\nreputation has not been a boon to me in my work; but if you have been\r\npleased, that is enough. I shall love my name now, and shall feel that\r\nit is the greatest return that you can find satisfaction in hearing your\r\nchild named, and in feeling that her work draws sympathies\r\ntogether--some return for what you have done for me. Life is sweet after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nThe form taken by the memorial, inaugurated at the public meeting in\r\nWillis's Rooms, was the establishment of a \"Nightingale Fund,\" to enable\r\nher to establish and control an institute for the training, sustenance,\r\nand protection of nurses, paid and unpaid. A copy of the resolution was\r\nsent to Miss Nightingale, who acknowledged it in a letter from Scutari\r\n(Jan. 6, 1856): \"Dear Mr. Herbert--In answer to your letter (which\r\nfollowed me to the Crimea and back to Scutari) proposing to me the\r\nundertaking of a Training School for Nurses, I will first beg to say\r\nthat it is impossible for me to express what I have felt in regard to\r\nthe sympathy and the confidence shown to me by the originators and\r\nsupporters of this scheme. Exposed as I am to be misinterpreted and\r\nmisunderstood, in a field of action in which the work is new,\r\ncomplicated, and distant from many who sit in judgment upon it,--it is\r\nindeed an abiding support to have such sympathy and such appreciation\r\nbrought home to me in the midst of labour and difficulties all but\r\noverpowering. I must add, however, that my present work is such as I\r\nwould never desert for any other, so long as I see room to believe that\r\nwhat I may do here is unfinished. May I, then, beg you to express to the\r\nCommittee that I accept their proposal, provided I may do so on their\r\nunderstanding of this great uncertainty as to when it will be possible\r\nfor me to carry it out?\"[182]\r\n\r\n  [182] _Report of the Nightingale Fund_, \"Addenda,\" pp. 1-2.\r\n\r\nPublic meetings in support of the Fund were held throughout England and\r\nin the British Dominions.[183] Among the speeches made at these\r\nmeetings, one of the most notable was Lord Stanley's at Manchester.\r\n\"There is no part of England,\" he said, \"no city or county, scarcely a\r\nconsiderable village, where some cottage household has not been\r\ncomforted amidst its mourning for the loss of one who had fallen in the\r\nwar, by the assurance that his last moments were watched, and his worst\r\nsufferings soothed, by that care, at once tender and skilful, which no\r\nman, and few women, could have shown. True heroism is not so plentiful\r\nthat we can afford to let it pass unrecognized--if not for the honour of\r\nthose who show it, yet very much for our own. The best test of a\r\nnation's moral state is the kind of claim which it selects for honour.\r\nAnd with the exception of Howard, the prison reformer, I know no person\r\nbesides Miss Nightingale, who, within the last hundred years, within\r\nthis island, or perhaps in Europe, has voluntarily encountered dangers\r\nso imminent, and undertaken offices so repulsive, working for a large\r\nand worthy object, in a pure spirit of duty towards God and compassion\r\nfor man.\" Lord Stanley showed a true appreciation, too, of the facts in\r\npointing out the strength of character which Miss Nightingale had shown\r\nas a pioneer. \"It is not easy everywhere, especially in England, to set\r\nabout doing what no one has done before. Many persons will undergo\r\nconsiderable risks, even that of death itself, when they know that they\r\nare engaged in a cause which, besides approving itself to their\r\nconsciences, commands sympathy and approval, when they know that their\r\nmotives are appreciated and their conduct applauded. But in this case\r\ncustom was to be violated, precedent broken through, the surprise,\r\nsometimes the censure of the world to be braved. And do not underrate\r\nthat obstacle. We hardly know the strength of those social ties that\r\nbind us until the moment when we attempt to break them.\"[184] The\r\nNightingale Fund was taken up heartily, but there was some carping\r\ncriticism, and the jealousies which attended Miss Nightingale's work\r\nfound expression against the Fund in her honour. There were great ladies\r\nwho, strange as it may now seem, regarded the attempt to raise the\r\n_status_ of the nursing profession as a silly fad. \"Lady Pam,\" wrote\r\nLord Granville, \"thinks the Nightingale Fund great humbug. 'The nurses\r\nare very good now; perhaps they do drink a little, but so do the\r\nladies' monthly nurses, and nothing can be better than them; poor\r\npeople, it must be so tiresome sitting up all night.'\"[185] The\r\nexistence of the Fund was notified in General Orders to the army in the\r\nEast. \"I hear,\" wrote Dr. Robertson at Scutari to Dr. Hall in the\r\nCrimea, \"that you have not (any more than myself) subscribed your day's\r\npay to the Nightingale Fund. I certainly said, the moment it appeared in\r\nOrders, I would not do so, and thereby countenance what I disapproved.\r\nOthers may do as they please, but though Linton, Cruikshanks, and Lawson\r\nhave all subscribed, I believe the subscriptions _in the hospital_ are\r\nnot many or large.\"[186] But this disgruntlement of the doctors was not\r\nshared by the troops, who subscribed nearly £9000 to the Fund. The\r\nCommander of the Forces, in sending to the Secretary of the Fund a first\r\nremittance of £4000 from \"Headquarters, Crimea,\" wrote (February 5,\r\n1856) that this amount, \"the result of voluntary individual offerings,\r\nplainly indicates the universal feeling of gratitude which exists among\r\nthe troops engaged in the Crimea for the care bestowed upon, and the\r\nrelief administered to, themselves and their comrades, at the period of\r\ntheir greatest sufferings, by the skilful arrangements, and the\r\nunwearying, constant personal attention, of Miss Nightingale and the\r\nother ladies associated with her.\" The Navy and the Coastguard Service\r\nsubscribed also. Nor was \"society\" all on the side of Lady Palmerston. A\r\nconcert given by Madame Goldschmidt (Jenny Lind) brought in nearly\r\n£2000. The ultimate application of the Fund did not follow precisely the\r\nlines originally proposed, but it was the means of enabling Miss\r\nNightingale to do one of the most useful pieces of her life's work.[187]\r\n\r\n  [183] Reports of some of the meetings are collected in the _Report of\r\n        the Nightingale Fund_. At Manchester (Jan. 17, 1856), in addition\r\n        to Lord Stanley, Mr. Herbert and Mr. Milnes spoke; at Oxford\r\n        (Jan. 23), Mr. Herbert again spoke; at Brighton (Jan. 14),\r\n        Mr. Milnes.\r\n\r\n  [184] _Speeches of the 15th Earl of Derby_, 1894, vol. i. pp. 16, 18.\r\n\r\n  [185] Fitzmaurice, _Life of the Second Earl Granville_, vol. i. p. 136.\r\n\r\n  [186] _Hall_, p. 449.\r\n\r\n  [187] See below, p. 456.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy and interest of the Royal Family in Miss Nightingale's work\r\nhad been shown by the presence of the Duke of Cambridge in the chair at\r\nWillis's Rooms; but the Queen desired to associate herself in some more\r\ndirect and signal measure with \"the grateful recognition\" by her\r\npeople. A few weeks after the Public Meeting the following letter was\r\nsent:--\r\n\r\n     WINDSOR CASTLE [_November_ 1855].[188] DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE--You\r\n     are, I know, well aware of the high sense I entertain of the\r\n     Christian devotion which you have displayed during this great and\r\n     bloody war, and I need hardly repeat to you how warm my admiration\r\n     is for your services, which are fully equal to those of my dear and\r\n     brave soldiers, whose sufferings you have had the _privilege_ of\r\n     alleviating in so merciful a manner. I am, however, anxious of\r\n     marking my feelings in a manner which I trust will be agreeable to\r\n     you, and therefore send you with this letter a brooch, the form and\r\n     emblems of which commemorate your great and blessed work, and\r\n     which, I hope, you will wear as a mark of the high approbation of\r\n     your Sovereign!\r\n\r\n     It will be a very great satisfaction to me, when you return at last\r\n     to these shores, to make the acquaintance of one who has set so\r\n     bright an example to our sex. And with every prayer for the\r\n     preservation of your valuable health, believe me, always, yours\r\n     sincerely,\r\n                                                           VICTORIA R.\r\n\r\n  [188] Wrongly dated \"January 1856\" in _Letters of Queen Victoria_,\r\n        vol. iii. p. 215. The gift was announced in the _Morning Post_\r\n        of December 20, 1855; the brooch reached Miss Nightingale in\r\n        November, and her reply had been received by Dec. 21 (see below,\r\n        p. 278). An illustrated account of the gift appeared in the\r\n        _Illustrated London News_, Feb. 2, 1856. It may now be seen in the\r\n        Museum of the United Service Institution.\r\n\r\nThe jewel, which was designed by the Prince Consort, resembles a badge\r\nrather than a brooch, bearing a St. George's Cross in red enamel, and\r\nthe Royal cypher surmounted by a crown in diamonds. The inscription,\r\n\"Blessed are the Merciful,\" encircles the badge, which also bears the\r\nword \"Crimea.\" On the reverse is the inscription: \"To Miss Florence\r\nNightingale, as a mark of esteem and gratitude for her devotion towards\r\nthe Queen's brave soldiers.--From Victoria R., 1855.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" wrote Lady Verney (Dec. 27, 1855), \"you will wear your Star to\r\nplease the soldiers on Sundays and holidays; because, judging from those\r\nat home, it will be such a pleasure to them to know that the Queen has\r\ndone her best to do you honour.\" At home, Miss Nightingale never wore\r\nthe decoration. She wore it in the East, on one occasion certainly (p.\r\n296); and possibly on other occasions. If so, it would have been for the\r\nreason suggested by her sister. She loved the soldiers. Honours and\r\nreputation, so far as they were valued by her at all (and that was\r\nlittle), were valued only as a means to the end of further service. With\r\nwhat zeal, and to what good purpose, she was now devoting herself to\r\nserve the best interests of the common soldier, we shall learn in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                           THE SOLDIERS' FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\n     Human nature is a noble and beautiful thing; not a foul nor a base\r\n     thing. All the sin of men I esteem as their disease, not their\r\n     nature; as a folly which can be prevented, not a necessity which\r\n     must be accepted. And my wonder, even when things are at their\r\n     worst, is always at the height which this human nature can\r\n     attain.--RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n\"What the horrors of war are,\" wrote Miss Nightingale on her way to the\r\nCrimea in May 1855,[189] \"no one can imagine. They are not wounds, and\r\nblood, and fever, spotted and low, and dysentery, chronic and acute, and\r\ncold and heat and famine. They are intoxication, drunken brutality,\r\ndemoralization and disorder on the part of the inferior; jealousies,\r\nmeanness, indifference, selfish brutality on the part of the superior.\"\r\nThen she goes on to deplore the drunkenness she had witnessed at the\r\nDepot, and the seeming indifference of the staff to it. And yet, as her\r\nexperience had shown, the men were quickly susceptible to better\r\ninfluences. \"We have established a reading-room for convalescents, which\r\nis well attended; and the conduct of the soldiers is uniformly good. I\r\nbelieve that we have been the most efficient means of restoring\r\ndiscipline instead of destroying it, as I have been accused of. They are\r\nmuch more respectful to me than they are to their own officers. But it\r\nmakes me cry to think that all these 6 months we might have had a\r\ntrained schoolmaster, and that I was told it was quite impossible; that\r\nin the Indian army effectual and successful measures are taken to\r\nprevent intoxication and disorganization, and that here the\r\nConvalescents are brought in emphatically _dead_ drunk (for they die of\r\nit), and officers look on with composure and say to me, 'You are\r\nspoiling the brutes.' The men are so glad to read, so glad to give their\r\nmoney.\" This passage serves to introduce us to a side of Miss\r\nNightingale's work which occupied much of her thoughts and activities\r\nduring the latter portion of her sojourn in the East. Her work in\r\ntending the sick bodies of the soldiers is that which is best known, but\r\nher work in appealing to their moral and mental nature was not less\r\nadmirable, and hardly less novel. A high authority, who had been through\r\nthe war, said of her at the time, \"She has taught officers and officials\r\nto treat the soldiers as Christian men.\" Not every officer needed thus\r\nto be lessoned, but Miss Nightingale's example, and the practical\r\nexperiments which directly or indirectly she set on foot during the\r\nCrimean War, did much to humanize the British Army. She deserves to be\r\nremembered as the Soldiers' Friend no less than as the Ministering\r\nAngel.\r\n\r\n  [189] In continuation of the letter quoted above, p. 255.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, like all moral and social reformers, believed in the\r\nnobility of human nature. She had seen in the hospital wards at Scutari,\r\nand in the trenches before Sebastopol, the heroism of which the common\r\nsoldier was capable. She refused to believe that the vices to which he\r\nwas prone were inherent in his nature. \"I have never been able to join,\"\r\nshe wrote to Lady Verney from Scutari (March 1856), \"in the popular cry\r\nabout the recklessness, sensuality, and helplessness of the soldiers. On\r\nthe contrary I should say (and perhaps few women have ever seen more of\r\nthe manufacturing and agricultural classes of England than I have before\r\nI came out here) that I have never seen so teachable and helpful a class\r\nas the Army generally. Give them opportunity promptly and securely to\r\nsend money home and they will use it. Give them schools and lectures and\r\nthey will come to them. Give them books and games and amusements and\r\nthey will leave off drinking. Give them suffering and they will bear it.\r\nGive them work and they will do it. I had rather have to do with the\r\nArmy generally than with any other class I have ever attempted to\r\nserve.\" It was a common belief of the time that it was in the nature of\r\nthe British soldier to be drunken. The same idea was entertained of the\r\nBritish nurse.[190] She utterly refused to believe it, and she set\r\nherself, in her determined and resourceful way, to put measures of\r\nreform into practice.\r\n\r\n  [190] See above, p. 273.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, as I have already explained (p. 215), had the ear of\r\nthe Court, and she took an opportunity of laying her views before the\r\nQueen. The immediate sequel is told in a letter from Lord Granville to\r\nLord Canning:--\r\n\r\n     _Dec._ 21 [1855]. In the Cabinet an interesting letter was read\r\n     from Miss Nightingale thanking the Queen for a handsome present,\r\n     and discussing the causes and remedies for the drunkenness in the\r\n     army. Pam thought it excellent. Clarendon said it was full of real\r\n     stuff, but Mars said it only showed that she knew nothing of the\r\n     British soldier.[191]\r\n\r\n  [191] Lord Fitzmaurice's _Life of the Second Earl Granville_, vol. i.\r\n        p. 133.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Panmure, though a believer in the original sin of the soldier,\r\nwas moved none the less by the forces thus set in motion to sanction\r\nsome useful measures of reform. Miss Nightingale, however, had not\r\nwaited for official action. That was never her way. When she wanted a\r\nthing done, she showed on such scale as was possible to her how to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHer first endeavour was to help and encourage the soldiers in sending\r\nhome a portion at least of their pay. She formed an extempore Money\r\nOrder Office, in which, on four afternoons in each month, she received\r\nthe money of any soldier who desired to send it home to his family.\r\nAbout £1000 was thus received monthly in small sums, which, by\r\npost-office orders obtained in England, were transmitted to their\r\nseveral recipients. Her uncle, Mr. Samuel Smith, undertook the English\r\nagency for her. After the Cabinet Council, just described, Lord Panmure\r\nwrote to the Commander of the Forces in the Crimea, adverting to Miss\r\nNightingale's \"cry,\" and remarking that if a soldier wanted to send\r\nmoney home he could do so through the Paymaster, but adding that it had\r\nbeen decided to increase the facilities. In the following month (January\r\n1856) the Government accepted the hint of Miss Nightingale's private\r\ninitiative and established offices for money orders at Constantinople,\r\nScutari, Balaclava, and \"Headquarters, Crimea.\" \"It will do no good,\"\r\nwrote \"Mars,\" convinced against his will; \"the soldier is not a\r\nremitting animal.\"[192] But in fact, during the following six months, a\r\nsum of £71,000 was sent home.[193] Miss Nightingale felt much\r\nsatisfaction in having been the means of \"rescuing this money from the\r\ncanteen.\" She was instrumental also in establishing a rival house,\r\nnamed, after a soldiers' battle, the \"Inkerman Café.\" This was\r\npleasantly situated close to the shore of the Bosphorus, midway between\r\nthe main hospitals at Scutari. Miss Nightingale devoted much attention\r\nto the details of this coffee-house, and framed the list of prices. In\r\nall such work for the good of the soldiers, she found a cordial\r\nsupporter in Sir Henry Storks, who had succeeded Lord William Paulet in\r\nthe command at Scutari in the latter part of 1855. Sir Henry agreed with\r\nher, as he wrote, \"that drunkenness can be made the exception, not the\r\nrule, in the Army\"; and in later years he referred in grateful\r\nrecollection to the time when \"we served together at Scutari.\"\r\n\r\n  [192] _Panmure_, vol. ii. p. 28.\r\n\r\n  [193] _Statement_, p. v.\r\n\r\nHer personal influence with the men was great. \"I promised _Her_ I would\r\nnot drink,\" or \"I promised _Her_ to send my money home,\" they would say,\r\n\"in such a tone,\" as Mr. Stafford recorded, \"as if it were ingrained in\r\nthe very stuff of them.\" A curious and, as I think the reader will agree\r\nwith me, a pretty illustration of this side of Miss Nightingale's work,\r\nwas brought under my notice during the preparation of this Memoir. On\r\nJanuary 23, 1856, Miss Nightingale wrote the following letter from\r\nScutari to the Rev. R. Glover, then Chaplain to the Forces at\r\nMaidstone:--\r\n\r\n     In reply to yours of Jan. 10--I have the pleasure to inform you\r\n     that I have just seen Thomas Whybron, 12th Lancers, and that he has\r\n     promised me that he will not only write to his wife, but transmit\r\n     money to her through me after 1st of next month, when he will\r\n     receive his pay. I trust he will keep his word. She had better also\r\n     write to him herself, and send her letter through me. He tells me\r\n     that he has had _one_ letter from her. However he is well, but he\r\n     has been in debt. However he sends his wife a kind message of love,\r\n     which he begs me to give her through you, and to beg that she will\r\n     not come out here. I am myself of this opinion. Independently of\r\n     the fact that, at this moment, I could not possibly receive any\r\n     more nurses, there are many reasons against bringing out more\r\n     soldiers' wives here, which you will readily apprehend. With regard\r\n     to the Regiment, I consider the 12th Lancers the most \"respectable\"\r\n     Regiment we have. They send home more money and put it to better\r\n     uses than all the other Regiments here put together. And I hope\r\n     that Whybron will improve in it.\r\n\r\nIn January 1912 Lieutenant-Colonel Clifton Brown, commanding the 12th\r\nRoyal Lancers, then quartered at Potchefstroom in the Transvaal, bought\r\nthe original of this letter, \"beautifully written, not a blot or a\r\nscratch in it,\" framed it with glass on both sides, and presented it to\r\nhis regiment. Thus may an echo of Miss Nightingale's care for the\r\nBritish soldier and pride in his good name roll from soul to soul, and\r\ngrow for ever and for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThen Miss Nightingale set herself to establish and equip reading-rooms\r\nand class-rooms. She took measures to let her schemes be made known in\r\nEngland, and the popularity of the heroine led to a speedy and generous\r\nresponse from all classes--from the Royal Family to the humblest\r\nprinter's boy. Miss Nightingale's relations at home received, and\r\ntransmitted to her, the gifts. Her cousin, Mr. Henry Bonham Carter, was\r\nespecially useful. \"Harry Carter,\" she wrote (Jan. 6, 1856), \"must be a\r\nman of business; for I can assure you that the boxes he sent me are the\r\nonly ones which have not lost me hours of unnecessary labour, because he\r\nhas given me invoices of the contents of each box and bills of lading.\"\r\nHer sister was receiver-general, and from Lady Verney's letters we\r\nobtain a lively account of the work:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Ellen Tollet._) [_Nov._ 1855.] I don't know whether Mrs.\r\n     Milnes told you how hard we worked to send off boxes for F.'s\r\n     education of the army! let me tell you, Ma'am, to instruct 50,000\r\n     men is no joke. Seriously tho', my love, it is small things any one\r\n     can do amid such a mass, which made one the more anxious to enable\r\n     her to do what she could, and we have sent a dose of 1000\r\n     copybooks, writing materials in proportion, Diagrams, Maps, books\r\n     illustrated and other. _Macbeth_ (6) to read 6 at a time, and the\r\n     music in the interludes, which Mr. Best (a pattern man whom I love\r\n     more even than the Dean of H.) recommended as having been\r\n     successful in his village. Chess, Footballs, other games, a magic\r\n     Lanthern for Dissolving views, a Stereoscope (very fine!), plays\r\n     for acting, music, &c. &c. Finally I thought a little art would be\r\n     advisable, and had a number of prints stretched and varnished which\r\n     are to be my subscription towards the improvement of the British\r\n     army!\r\n\r\n     But, my dear, you can't conceive how pretty the sort of help is\r\n     that everybody poured in; the P. & O. says, nothing is to be paid,\r\n     Miss N.'s things all go free.\r\n\r\n     (_To Florence Nightingale._) [_Nov._ 16, 1855.] Please, my dear,\r\n     acknowledge a print which the Queen sends you for the soldiers. She\r\n     heard thro' Lady Augusta Bruce that you had asked for one of her\r\n     for the \"Inkerman Café \"; and she accordingly sends you the one of\r\n     the Duke of Wellington presenting May flowers to the little Prince\r\n     Arthur his godson; which is very pretty of her, for it combines so\r\n     many things. It is sent to you to do what you like with, so I have\r\n     said you most likely will wish to have it at Balaclava for your\r\n     Reading Room plans. We have been racking our brains to get together\r\n     amusing things for your men.... To mitigate the science I have\r\n     slipped in the Madonna of the Sedia; which, my love, is domestic,\r\n     if you please, not Popish. The Duchess of Kent sends a capital lot\r\n     of books; she has been so pleased to be of use.\r\n\r\nBoth in the Crimea and at Scutari Miss Nightingale carried on, as\r\nopportunity offered, what her sister laughingly called \"the education of\r\nthe British Army.\" But it was at Scutari, where she principally stayed,\r\nthat the effort took the largest scope. Outside the Barrack Hospital a\r\nbuilding was bought by Sir Henry Storks, on behalf of the Government, to\r\nprovide a reading-room and a school-room. The reading-room, opened in\r\nJanuary 1856, was supplied by Miss Nightingale with books, prints, maps,\r\ngames, and newspapers. The other room was used as a garrison school; two\r\nschoolmasters were sent out; and evening lectures and classes were\r\ngiven. A second school was conducted in a hut between the two large\r\nhospitals at Scutari.[194] For the convalescents, Miss Nightingale had\r\nat an earlier date established reading-huts in the Barrack Hospital,\r\nfurnishing them with books, newspapers, writing materials, prints, and\r\ngames. In all the reading-huts the men attended numerously and\r\nconstantly, their behaviour when there being, Miss Nightingale added,\r\nuniformly quiet and well-bred. The good manners, no less than the\r\nuncomplaining heroism of the common soldier, made an indelible\r\nimpression upon the Lady-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  [194] I take these particulars from a Memorandum, found among Miss\r\n        Nightingale's papers, by the Rev. J. E. Sabin, Senior Chaplain at\r\n        Scutari.\r\n\r\nIt was out of her experiences in the Crimean War that grew her love for\r\nthe British soldier, to whose health, care, and comfort, at home and in\r\nIndia, she was to devote many years of her long life. In extreme old\r\nage, when failing powers were not equally alert to every call, she would\r\nsometimes, I have been told, show listlessness if her companion talked\r\nof nurses or nursing, but the old light would ever come into her eye,\r\nand the faltering mind would instantly stand at attention, upon the\r\nslightest reference to the British soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                            TO THE CRIMEA AGAIN\r\n\r\n                        (September 1855-July 1856)\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am ready to stand out the War with any man.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\r\n     (Nov. 4, 1855).\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1855, Sebastopol fell, after assaults, as every one\r\nremembers, which had filled the British cemeteries and hospitals. Miss\r\nNightingale's time from this date to the end of the war was divided\r\nbetween the Crimea and Scutari. On October 9, 1855, she left Scutari for\r\nBalaclava, and she remained in the Crimea till the end of November, when\r\nshe hurried back to Scutari on hearing of a serious outbreak of cholera\r\nin the Barrack Hospital at that place. On Good Friday, 1856 (March 21),\r\nshe again left Scutari for Balaclava, in consequence of an urgent appeal\r\nfrom the hospitals of the Land Transport Corps, and she remained there\r\ntill the beginning of July. She left Scutari for England on July 28.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's work during her second and third visits to the Crimea\r\n(of two months in 1855, and of three in 1856) was the most arduous, and\r\nin some respects the most worrying, of all her labours in the East. The\r\ndistances between the several Crimean hospitals, enumerated in an\r\nearlier chapter (p. 254), were great; how bad were the roads is known to\r\nevery one who has read anything about the Crimean War; and Miss\r\nNightingale experienced much of the rigour of a Crimean winter. \"The\r\nextraordinary exertions she imposed upon herself would have been\r\nperfectly incredible,\" wrote M. Soyer, \"if they had not been witnessed\r\nby many. I can vouch for the fact, having frequently accompanied her to\r\nthe [Castle] Hospital as well as to the Monastery. The return from these\r\nplaces at night was a very dangerous experience, as the road led across\r\na very uneven country. It was still more perilous when snow was upon the\r\nground. I have seen her stand for hours at the top of a bleak rocky\r\nmountain near the Hospital, giving her instructions while the snow was\r\nfalling heavily.\" She had for some years been somewhat subject to\r\nrheumatism, and in the Crimea she was at times tortured by sciatica. But\r\nshe was \"acclimatised,\" she said, and was strong to endure. Sometimes\r\nshe spent long days in the saddle. At other times she drove in a rough\r\ncart. Her first conveyance was a cart--drawn by a mule and driven, adds\r\nthe lively Soyer, by a donkey; and she suffered a nasty upset in it.\r\nColonel McMurdo, Commandant of the Land Transport Corps,[195] then\r\nkindly gave her the best vehicle procurable. It has been dignified by\r\nthe name of \"Miss Nightingale's Carriage,\" but was, in fact, a hooded\r\nbaggage-car without springs.[196] Some time later M. Soyer identified\r\nthe vehicle among other \"Crimean effects\" which were on sale at\r\nSouthampton. It was shown at the Victorian Era Exhibition forty years\r\nlater,[197] and is still preserved at Lea Hurst.\r\n\r\n  [195] Sir William Montagu Scott McMurdo (1819-94); K.C.B. 1881. Miss\r\n        Nightingale had a very high opinion of his services in the Crimea,\r\n        and Sidney Herbert appointed him Inspector-General of the\r\n        Volunteers (see Miss Nightingale's Letter on the Volunteers, 1861).\r\n\r\n  [196] A woodcut of it appeared in the _Illustrated London News_, August\r\n        30, 1856.\r\n\r\n  [197] See Vol. II. p. 409.\r\n\r\nIn this hooded vehicle, or on horseback, or if the roads were very bad\r\non foot, Miss Nightingale made her rounds in all weathers, her\r\nheadquarters being sometimes at the General and sometimes at the Castle\r\nHospital. She never presumed on her sex to save herself trouble or\r\nfatigue at the expense of others. She was now without Mr. Bracebridge's\r\nassistance, but she found that the absence of a civilian go-between was\r\nno disadvantage. \"A woman,\" she said, \"obtains from military courtesy\r\n(if she does not shock either their habits of business or their caste\r\nprejudices) what a man who pitted the civilian against the military\r\neffectually hindered.\" She superintended the nursing in all the\r\nhospitals under her orders. Of the hospital huts on the Genoese Heights,\r\nthere is a vivid picture in Lady Hornby's _Travels_. \"The first day of\r\nour arrival,\" she wrote, May 1856, \"we took a long ramble on the heights\r\nof Balaclava, by the old Genoese castle. On one side is a solitary and\r\nmagnificent view of sea and cliffs; but pass a sharp and lofty turning,\r\nand the crowded port beneath, and all the active military movements, are\r\ninstantly before your eyes. Higher up we came to Miss Nightingale's\r\nhospital huts, built of long planks, and adorned with neatly bordering\r\nflowers. The sea was glistening before us, and as we lingered to admire\r\nthe fine view, one of the nurses, a kind, motherly-looking woman, came\r\ninto the little porch, and invited us to enter and rest. A wooden stool\r\nwas kindly offered to us by another and younger Sister. On the large\r\ndeal table was a simple pot of wild flowers, so beautifully arranged,\r\nthey instantly struck my eye. How charming the little deal house\r\nappeared to me, with its perfect cleanliness, its glorious view, and the\r\nhealth, contentment, and usefulness of its inmates! How respectable\r\ntheir few wants seemed; how suited their simple dress to the stern\r\nrealities, as well as to the charities of life, and how fearlessly they\r\nreposed on the care and love of God in that lonely place, far away from\r\nall their friends; how earnestly they admired and tended the few spring\r\nflowers of a strange land,[198] these brave, quiet women, who had\r\nwitnessed and helped to relieve so much suffering! This was the\r\npleasantest visit I ever made. Miss Nightingale had been there but a few\r\ndays before, and this deal room and stool were hers.\"[199] Miss\r\nNightingale established reading-rooms, bored for water to improve the\r\nsupply near the hospitals, had the huts covered with felt for protection\r\nagainst the winter, and brought her extra-diet kitchens, with M. Soyer's\r\ngood help, into full efficiency. In her absence the work had met with\r\nmany difficulties from the supineness or hostility of officials towards\r\nwhat some regarded as her fads, and others as her interference. \"In\r\nApril,\" she wrote to Mrs. Herbert from the Castle Hospital (Nov. 17,\r\n1855), \"I undertook this Hospital, and from that time to this we cooked\r\nall the Extra Diet for 500 to 600 patients, and the _whole_ diet for all\r\nthe wounded officers by ourselves in a shed; and though I sent up a\r\nFrench cook in July to whom I gave £100 a year, I could not get an Extra\r\nDiet Kitchen built, promised me in May, till I came up this time to do\r\nit myself in October. During the whole of this time, every egg, every\r\nbit of butter, jelly, ale, and Eau de Cologne which the sick officers\r\nhave had has been provided out of Mrs. Samuel Smith's or my private\r\npocket. On Nov. 4 I opened my Extra Diet Kitchen.\"\r\n\r\n  [198] For another reference to the Crimean flowers, see below, p. 450.\r\n\r\n  [199] _Hornby_, pp. 306-7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's work in the Crimea was attended by ceaseless worry.\r\nShe had to fight her way into full authority. She knew that she would\r\nwin, but her enemies were active, and were for the moment in possession\r\nof the field. \"There is not an official,\" she said, \"who would not burn\r\nme like Joan of Arc if he could, but they know that the War Office\r\ncannot turn me out because the country is with me.\" She was beset with\r\njealousies in the Crimea, both in military and in medical quarters; and\r\nto make matters worse, religious, and even racial animosities mixed\r\nthemselves up in the disputes. Lord Raglan, who believed in her and\r\nalways supported her, was now dead; and by some strange omission, the\r\ninstructions which had been sent to him from London at the time of her\r\noriginal appointment were unknown to his successors in the command. The\r\nwords in the _published_ instructions--\"in Turkey\"--gave a sort of\r\ntechnical excuse (as already mentioned) to jealous officials for\r\nregarding Miss Nightingale as an interloper in the Crimea. The point,\r\nhowever, had no substance; for there was a female nursing establishment\r\nalready in the Crimea, which had received no separate or independent\r\ninstructions, and which was yet supported by Government. By what\r\nauthority could it be there, except as delegated from the Lady\r\nSuperintendent in Chief? But the intrusion of Miss Nightingale was, I\r\nsuppose, resented by some military officers the more at Balaclava than\r\nat Scutari, in proportion as the scene was nearer to the front; how\r\nkeen the resentment was, we have heard from Colonel Sterling. And as\r\nHeadquarters were unsympathetic also, Miss Nightingale had an uphill\r\ntask. \"We get things done all the same,\" she wrote to Mrs. Herbert,\r\n\"only a little more slowly. When we have support at Headquarters matters\r\nadvance faster, that is all. The real grievance against us is that,\r\nthough subordinate to the Medical Chiefs in Office, we are superior to\r\nthem in influence and in the chance of being heard at home. It is an\r\nanomaly, but so is war in England.\" There had been in England no due\r\nprovision for all the needs of the war. Miss Nightingale, seeing things\r\nthat needed to be done, preferred to get them done by anomalous means\r\nrather than that by rule they should not be done at all.\r\n\r\nThat her analysis of the situation correctly explains the jealousy and\r\nopposition of the Medical Chiefs in Office may be gathered from their\r\ncorrespondence. The personal situation in the Crimea had not been eased\r\nby the statements of Mr. Bracebridge, already mentioned (p. 213). On his\r\nreturn home, he had not only extolled Miss Nightingale, but had made\r\nsevere strictures upon the whole medical service in the East. His\r\nspeech, delivered at a public meeting, was reported very fully in the\r\n_Times_ (Oct. 16, 1855). Miss Nightingale was doubtless suspected of\r\ncomplicity in this attack; but in fact she was innocent, and she was\r\nquite as angry as were the doctors when she saw the report. Mr.\r\nBracebridge was her friend, but truth and expediency were greater\r\nfriends; and she proceeded to give Mr. Bracebridge a trenchant piece of\r\nher mind (Nov. 4). She objected to his speech: \"_First_, because it is\r\nnot our business, and I have expressly denied being a medical officer,\r\nand rejected all applications both of medical men and quacks to have\r\ntheir systems examined[200]; _secondly_, because it justifies all the\r\nattacks made against us for unwarrantable interference and criticism;\r\nand, _thirdly_, because I believe it to be utterly unfair.\" And she\r\nproceeded in much detail to defend the doctors against Mr. Bracebridge's\r\naspersions. His indiscretion doubtless raised prejudice in medical\r\nquarters against Miss Nightingale; but there were other and deeper\r\ncauses at work. Dr. Hall, the Principal Medical Officer in the Crimea,\r\nwas, in some sort, the person most responsible, individually, for the\r\nstate of things which had stirred so much outcry in England; and Mr.\r\nSidney Herbert at a very early stage had put his finger on Dr. Hall's\r\ntouchy spot. \"I cannot help feeling,\" he had written to Lord Raglan in\r\nDecember 1854, \"that Dr. Hall resents offers of assistance as being\r\nslurs on his preparations.\"[201] Dr. Hall wrote fiercely about \"a system\r\nof detraction against our establishments kept up by interested parties\r\nunder the garb of philanthropy.\" Some became detractors, he went on, \"to\r\nmake their mission of importance, and they wish the world to believe\r\nthat all the ameliorations in our institutions are entirely owing to\r\ntheir own exertions or those of a few nurses; and I am sorry to say some\r\nof our own department have pandered to this, and have been rewarded for\r\nit.\" Miss Nightingale's remark upon this tirade was characteristic: \"One\r\nis tempted to ask, have no others been rewarded who have nothing to show\r\nfor the result of this same boasted hospital system, but the wreck of an\r\nArmy, which they did not advise even the most ordinary precautions (as\r\nto diet and clothing) to prevent, and the graves at Scutari.\"[202] To\r\nme, after much reading of the documents, it seems that Dr. Hall was the\r\nvictim of a false position. He had been appointed Medical\r\nInspector-General in the Crimea when he was still in India, and he did\r\nnot arrive on the scene in time to think out the preparations properly.\r\nMiss Nightingale never allowed personal feeling to affect the\r\nimpartiality of her judgments. Dr. Hall disputed her authority and\r\nresented her interference. She fought him, and in the end she beat him;\r\nbut there are passages in her letters which bear testimony to his good\r\nservices and high capacity in many respects. Nor were their personal\r\nrelations unfriendly; but she saw in him throughout an antagonist\r\ninfluence. The Deputy Purveyor-in-Chief, Mr. David Fitz-Gerald, regarded\r\nher coming to the Crimea with equal, or greater, suspicion and dislike,\r\nand he sent home to the War Office a Confidential Report, criticizing\r\nthe female nursing establishment, and making out an argumentative case\r\nagainst the desirability of sanctioning Miss Nightingale's claim to be\r\nthe Lady Superior of the Crimean nurses. Miss Nightingale had been shown\r\nthese reports by a friend, and she was angry at what she considered a\r\ncampaign of secret hostility against her.\r\n\r\n  [200] There are applications of the kind among Miss Nightingale's\r\n        papers.\r\n\r\n  [201] _Stanmore_, vol. i. p. 369.\r\n\r\n  [202] _Notes_, vol. i. sec. i. pp. xxiv.-v. In a private letter\r\n        Miss Nightingale's irony was more bitter. \"K.C.B.\" meant, she\r\n        supposed, Knight of the Crimean Burial-grounds.\"\r\n\r\nTo add to the mischief, the professional difficulty (as I may call it)\r\nbecame entangled with the religious difficulty. Some of the nuns who had\r\npreviously been assigned to the hospitals at Koulali, proceeded in\r\nOctober 1855, at Dr. Hall's instance, to the General Hospital at\r\nBalaclava. This was naturally regarded by Miss Nightingale as an act of\r\nusurpation upon her authority; it gave an undue proportion of Roman\r\nCatholics to a particular hospital; and, moreover, she did not consider\r\nthese particular ladies, or their Reverend Mother, Mrs. Bridgeman,\r\nwholly efficient. They were most devoted and self-sacrificing, and their\r\nspiritual ministrations were admirable, but as nurses and administrators\r\nshe thought less highly of them. Mr. Fitz-Gerald, on the other hand, was\r\nstrongly prepossessed, as independent observers thought, in their\r\nfavour. As ill-luck would have it, these ladies were for the most part\r\nIrish, and the matter was made to assume the aspect of a\r\nracial-religious feud. People who could not understand Miss\r\nNightingale's single-minded devotion to efficient and business-like\r\nadministration supposed that she was actuated by prejudice. Dr. Hall was\r\nnot moved by any such suspicion; but the ladies, whom Miss Nightingale\r\nregarded as not among the more efficient of her staff of nurses, were\r\nhis nominees, and he strongly backed them. There was a somewhat similar\r\ndispute about another transference of nurses in the Crimea made without\r\nMiss Nightingale's sanction; and some of the women, taking their cue\r\nfrom their superiors, were inclined to question and flout her authority.\r\n\"I don't know what she wants here,\" said one, when the Lady\r\nSuperintendent appeared on the scene.[203]\r\n\r\n  [203] _The Autobiography of a Balaclava Nurse_, vol. ii. p. 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nAll this controversy raised Miss Nightingale's vexation to white heat.\r\nOn January 7, 1856, she wrote an official letter to the War Office,\r\ncomplaining of the encroachment on her department by the Medical\r\nOfficer. In semi-private letters to Mr. Sidney Herbert (Feb. 20, 21,\r\n1856) she formulated her grievances. Dr. Hall was \"attempting to root\r\nher out of the Crimea.\" Other officials were traducing her behind her\r\nback. The War Office was not adequately supporting her. \"It is profuse,\"\r\nshe said, \"in tinsel and empty praise which I do not want, and does not\r\ngive me the real business-like efficient standing which I do want.\" She\r\nbegged Mr. Herbert to move in the House of Commons for the production of\r\ncorrespondence, so that the public might be able to judge between her\r\nand those who were traducing her, and striving to thwart her work. Mr.\r\nHerbert, in a reply[204] marked alike by good sense and good feeling,\r\nventured \"to criticize and to scold\" his friend. \"You have been\r\noverdone,\" he said, \"with your long, anxious, harassing work. You see\r\njealousies and meannesses all round you. You hear of one-sided, unfair,\r\nand unjust reports made of your proceedings and of those under you. But\r\nyou over-rate their importance, you attribute too much motive to them,\r\nand you write upon them with an irritation and vehemence which detracts\r\nvery much from the weight which would attach to what you say.\" There are\r\nletters to show that this was the opinion also of the more sagacious\r\namong Miss Nightingale's nearest friends. To move for papers would, Mr.\r\nHerbert added, be very injudicious. There was no public attack, and the\r\npublication of papers would call needless attention to disputes. The\r\nanswers to her critics, which she had sent home, appeared to Mr. Herbert\r\nto be complete, and he understood that the War Office so considered\r\nthem. Moreover the Secretary of State was about to issue orders which\r\nwould clear up Miss Nightingale's position once and for all. And her own\r\nletters, though conclusive as to the facts, had in their tone done\r\nherself \"less than justice.\"\r\n\r\n  [204] Printed _in extenso_ in _Stanmore_, vol. i. pp. 416-420.\r\n\r\nAll this was excellent advice, and Miss Nightingale took it in good\r\npart, but not, in a phrase now sanctioned in high politics, \"lying\r\ndown.\" She replied at great length and with full vigour. The gist of her\r\nletter was that it was easy to be calm and \"statesmanlike\" at a\r\ndistance, but difficult not to be angry and downright when you were on\r\nthe spot finding your work for the sick and wounded hampered at every\r\nturn. She had been criticized, among other things, for interference in\r\nthe Purveyor's sphere. Her reply to Mr. Herbert on this point is\r\ndecidedly effective, and incidentally throws light on the hardness of\r\nher life in the Crimea. Happily, she said, she had brought with her\r\nadequate supplies for herself and her staff. If she had not, they would\r\nhave been in danger of starvation:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Sidney Herbert._) CRIMEA, _April_ 4 [1856]. I\r\n     arrived here March 24 with Nurses for the two Land Transport\r\n     Hospitals required by Dr. Hall in writing on March 10.[205] We have\r\n     now been ten days without rations. Lord Cardigan was surprised to\r\n     find his horses die at the end of a fortnight because they were\r\n     without rations, and said that they \"chose\" to do it, obstinate\r\n     brutes! The Inspector-General and Purveyors wish to see whether\r\n     women can live as long as horses without rations. I thank God my\r\n     charge has felt neither cold nor hunger (and is in efficient\r\n     working order, having cooked and administered in both Hospitals the\r\n     whole of the extras for 260 bad cases ever since the first day of\r\n     their arrival). I have, however, felt both. I do not wish to make a\r\n     martyr of myself; within sight of the graves of the Crimean Army of\r\n     last winter (too soon forgotten in England), it would be difficult\r\n     to do so. I am glad to have had the experience. For cold and hunger\r\n     wonderfully sharpen the wits.... During these ten days I have fed\r\n     and warmed these women at my own private expense by my own private\r\n     exertions. I have never been off my horse till 9 or 10 at night,\r\n     except when it was too dark to walk home over these crags even with\r\n     a lantern, when I have gone on foot. During the greater part of the\r\n     day I have been without food necessarily, except a little brandy\r\n     and water (you see I am taking to drinking like my comrades of the\r\n     Army). But the object of my coming has been attained, and my women\r\n     have neither starved nor suffered.\r\n\r\n  [205] The letter is printed in _Hall_, p. 451.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the petty persecution to which she was subjected by\r\nhostile and jealous officials in the Crimea never faded from Miss\r\nNightingale's mind. A reference to it will be found in a much later\r\nchapter,[206] and she often mentioned it in her notes and letters. But,\r\nthough she fought the officials hard, she never showed temper in public,\r\nand she did not allow either the obstruction itself or her vexation at\r\nit to impede her work. She had come to the Crimea prepared, and her\r\nprivate stores sufficed to feed her staff till official obstruction was\r\nremoved; whilst as for her vexation, she was careful not to show it lest\r\nher work should suffer.\r\n\r\n  [206] Vol. II. p. 195.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a dispatch was already on its way from the War Department,\r\nwhich gave to Miss Nightingale the full support for which she had asked.\r\nThe dispatch was not settled, however, without a stiff fight against it\r\nby subordinates at the War Office, who sided with Sir John Hall and Mr.\r\nFitz-Gerald. The curious in such matters may consult the minutes and\r\ncounter-minutes upon Miss Nightingale's letter of protest preserved in\r\nthe archives of the War Office. Lord Panmure, however, took her view.\r\nEven when the lines of the dispatch were settled in accordance with his\r\ninstructions, protests were still made against a policy which, in\r\nsupporting Miss Nightingale, would censure Dr. Hall, but the Minister\r\nwas not moved. He had already, on November 5, 1855, written to Miss\r\nNightingale herself, stating that Mrs. Bridgeman was not justified in\r\nacting as she had done.[207] He now, on February 25, 1856, wrote to the\r\nCommander of the Forces directing that Dr. Hall's attention should be\r\ncalled to the irregularity of his proceeding in introducing nurses into\r\na Hospital without previous communication with Miss Nightingale, and\r\nthat the following statement should be issued:--\r\n\r\n     The Secretary of State for War has addressed the following dispatch\r\n     to the Commander of the Forces, with a desire that it should be\r\n     promulgated in General Orders: \"It appears to me that the Medical\r\n     Authorities of the Army do not correctly comprehend Miss\r\n     Nightingale's position as it has been officially recognized by me.\r\n     I therefore think it right to state to you briefly for their\r\n     guidance, as well as for the information of the Army, what the\r\n     position of that excellent lady is. Miss Nightingale is recognized\r\n     by Her Majesty's Government as the General Superintendent of the\r\n     Female Nursing Establishment of the military hospitals of the Army.\r\n     No lady, or sister, or nurse is to be transferred from one hospital\r\n     to another, or introduced into any hospital, without consultation\r\n     with her. Her instructions, however, require to have the approval\r\n     of the Principal Medical Officer in the exercise of the\r\n     responsibility thus vested in her. The Principal Medical Officer\r\n     will communicate with Miss Nightingale upon all subjects connected\r\n     with the Female Nursing Establishment, and will give his directions\r\n     through that lady.\"[208]\r\n\r\n  [207] See _Hall_, p. 438.\r\n\r\n  [208] _Hall_, p. 450. The text of the General Order as issued on\r\n        March 16 was printed in the _Times_ of April 1, 1856.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's strong feeling in this matter was not caused, as a\r\nhasty, prejudiced, or uncharitable judgment might suggest, by wounded\r\n_amour propre_. It was based on the conviction which experience had\r\ngiven her, that only by the strictest discipline exercised through\r\nproperly constituted authority, could the experiment of female nursing\r\nin military hospitals be made successful. In the Confidential Reports\r\nwhich were sent to the War Office criticizing the experiment, advantage\r\nwas taken of mistakes and misdeeds which Miss Nightingale felt that she\r\nmight have prevented had she been armed earlier with explicit and\r\nplenary authority.[209]\r\n\r\n  [209] See on this subject her Report to the Secretary of State,\r\n        _Subsidiary Notes_, pp. 1, 2.\r\n\r\nArmed with this full authority, Miss Nightingale proceeded to make such\r\ntransferences among the nurses as she deemed necessary in the cause of\r\nefficiency. She had no desire to remove Mrs. Bridgeman and the nuns; she\r\nwas anxious only to make some reforms in their administration, as she\r\nwould now have express authority to do; and she begged Mrs. Bridgeman to\r\nremain. Sir John Hall and the Deputy Purveyor-in-Chief, smarting under\r\nthe War Office's edict, seem to have laid their heads together, and\r\nadvised Mrs. Bridgeman to resign.[210] \"It must rest with you to\r\ndecide,\" wrote Sir John, \"whether you wish to remain subservient to the\r\ncontrol of Miss Nightingale or not.\" She and her Sisterhood, resigning\r\nforthwith (March 28), returned to England, and Miss Nightingale filled\r\ntheir places by others of the staff. In her retrospect of the whole\r\ncampaign, she regarded the spring of 1856 in the Crimea as one of the\r\nthree periods when her nurses gave the greatest proof of their\r\nutility.[211] There was then great sickness among the Land Transport\r\nCorps. The other two periods were on the arrival of the wounded from\r\nInkerman at Scutari (p. 181), and \"during the heavy summer work of\r\nnursing the wounded at Balaclava in 1855.\" There is, I think, no\r\nmemorial of Miss Nightingale in the Crimea. But on the heights above\r\nBalaclava, visible from a great distance at sea, is a tall marble cross,\r\nerected to the memory of the heroic dead, \"and to those Sisters of\r\nCharity who had fallen in their service.\" The words engraved upon it\r\nare, \"Lord, have mercy upon us.\"[212]\r\n\r\n  [210] See the letters printed in _Hall_, p. 457.\r\n\r\n  [211] _Notes_, p. 158.\r\n\r\n  [212] It has often been stated that the cross was erected by\r\n        Miss Nightingale, but this is not the case. The inscription was\r\n        suggested by Mrs. Shaw Stewart. In 1863 a Maternity Charity was\r\n        established at Constantinople \"in honour of Florence Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was much exhausted by her labours in the Crimea, and, a\r\nfew weeks before she left it for the last time, she wrote some\r\ntestamentary dispositions which, in the event of her death, were to be\r\nhanded to General Storks, in command at Scutari: \"As you,\" she wrote to\r\nhim (Balaclava, May 3, 1856), \"are of all those in office, whether at\r\nhome or abroad, the officer who has given the most steady and consistent\r\nsupport to the work entrusted to me by Her Majesty's Government, I\r\nventure to appeal to you to continue that support after my death, and to\r\ncarry out as far as possible my last requests.\" She expressed an\r\n\"earnest desire\" that Mrs. Shaw Stewart should be appointed to succeed\r\nher. She left messages of commendation and pecuniary gifts to the\r\nReverend Mother of the Bermondsey Nuns, Sister Bertha Turnbull, and Mrs.\r\nRoberts: \"To the Queen I beg humbly to restore the 'Order' with which\r\nHer Majesty was pleased to decorate me. If she sees fit to return it to\r\nmy family, it will be prized the more by them. I cannot express the\r\nsupport which the approbation of my Sovereign has been to me in all my\r\ntrials. But I would assure Her that neither by word or thought or deed\r\nhave I ever for one moment been unworthy of Her service or of the\r\ncharge entrusted to me by Her. I would wish the Commander of the Forces\r\nin the East, in restoring to Her this jewel, to assure Her of this.\"\r\nThere were other requests, but her last thought was of the Army: \"I\r\nwould wish that I could have done something more to prove to the noble\r\nArmy, whom I have so cared for, my respect and esteem. If the Commander\r\nof the Forces would put into General Orders a message of farewell from\r\nme, of remembrance of the time when we lived and suffered and worked\r\ntogether, I should be grateful to him.\" She was to be spared to render\r\nservices to the British Army greater than any she had been able to\r\nrender in the Crimea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nAt Scutari, during the last months of Miss Nightingale's sojourn (Nov.\r\n1855--March 1856, and July 1856), her work was as continuous as in the\r\nCrimea. Her companions, Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, had returned to\r\nEngland in August 1855, and their place was taken by Mrs. Samuel Smith.\r\nFrom her letters we get a glimpse of Florence's daily toil at Scutari.\r\n\"Mine,\" wrote the aunt (Dec. 31, 1855), \"is mere copying; hers is\r\nperplexing brain-work. I go to bed at 11; she habitually writes till 1\r\nor 2, sometimes till 3 or 4; has in the last pressure given up 3 whole\r\nnights to it. We seldom get through even our little dinner (after it has\r\nbeen put off one, two, or three hours on account of her visitors),\r\nwithout her being called away from it. I never saw a greater picture of\r\nexhaustion than Flo last night at ten (Jan. 7). 'Oh, do go to bed,' I\r\nsaid. 'How can I; I have all those letters to write,' pointing to the\r\ndivan covered with papers. 'Write them to-morrow.' 'To-morrow will bring\r\nits own work.' And she sat up the greater part of the night.\" But with\r\nall this pressure, there was no flurry. \"Such questions as food, rest,\r\ntemperature,\" wrote her aunt in another letter (Jan. 25, 1856), \"never\r\ninterfere with her during her work; I suppose she has gained some\r\nadvantage over other people in her entire absence of thought about these\r\nthings; that is, her mind overtasked with great things has not these\r\nlittle questions to entertain. She is extremely quick and clear too, as\r\nyou know, in her work. This I suppose has increased upon her, and she\r\ncan turn from one thing or one person to another, when in the midst of\r\nbusiness, in a most extraordinary manner. She has attained a most\r\nwonderful calm and presence of mind. She is, I think, often deeply\r\nimpressed, and depressed, though she does not show it outwardly, but no\r\nirritation of temper, no hurry or confusion of manner, ever appears for\r\na moment.\" Mrs. Smith's work was not only copying. Mrs. Bracebridge had\r\ncalled herself \"Boots,\" because she did all Florence's odd jobs, and to\r\nthis part Mrs. Smith had succeeded. \"Aunt Mai,\" who had helped so\r\ngreatly in Florence's struggle for independence, must have felt rewarded\r\nfor her self-sacrifice in leaving husband, home, and children, by being\r\nable to stand at her niece's side through some part of the life of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas Day (1855) Miss Nightingale accepted an invitation to the\r\nBritish Embassy, and another guest has drawn a picture of her on this\r\noccasion:--\r\n\r\n     By the side of the Ambassadress was a tall, fashionable, haughty\r\n     beauty. But the next instant my eye wandered to a lady modestly\r\n     standing on the other side of Lady Stratford. At first I thought\r\n     she was a nun, from her black dress and close cap. She was not\r\n     introduced, and yet Edmund and I looked at each other at the same\r\n     moment to whisper _Miss Nightingale_. Yes, it was Florence\r\n     Nightingale, greatest of all now in name and honour among women. I\r\n     assure you that I was glad not to be obliged to speak just then,\r\n     for I felt quite dumb as I looked at her wasted figure and the\r\n     short brown hair combed over her forehead like a child's, cut so\r\n     when her life was despaired of from a fever but a short time ago.\r\n     Her dress, as I have said, was black, made high to the throat, its\r\n     only ornament being a large enamelled brooch, which looked to me\r\n     like the colours of a regiment surmounted with a wreath of laurel,\r\n     no doubt some graceful offering from our men. To hide the close\r\n     white cap a little, she had tied a white crape handkerchief over\r\n     the back of it, only allowing the border of lace to be seen; and\r\n     this gave the nun-like appearance which first struck me on her\r\n     entering the room; otherwise Miss Nightingale is by no means\r\n     striking in appearance. Only her plain black dress, quiet manner\r\n     and great renown told so powerfully altogether in that assembly of\r\n     brilliant dress and uniforms. She is very slight, rather above the\r\n     middle height; her face is long and thin, but this may be from\r\n     recent illness and great fatigue. She has a very prominent nose,\r\n     slightly Roman; and small dark eyes, kind, yet penetrating; but her\r\n     face does not give you at all the idea of great talent. She looks a\r\n     quiet, persevering, orderly, lady-like woman.... She was still very\r\n     weak, and could not join in the games, but she sat on a sofa, and\r\n     looked on, laughing until the tears came into her eyes.[213]\r\n\r\n  [213] Letter from Lady Hornby to her sister Mrs. Vaillant, Jan. 5, 1856;\r\n        _Hornby_, pp. 150, 152. The enamelled brooch was the Queen's jewel.\r\n\r\nIt was during this latter portion of Miss Nightingale's sojourn at\r\nScutari that she made a new friendship, which was of some importance to\r\nher work. In October 1855 Colonel Lefroy,[214] confidential adviser on\r\nscientific matters to the Secretary for War, was sent out by Lord\r\nPanmure to report privately on the state of the hospitals. He formed a\r\nhigh opinion of Miss Nightingale's work and abilities, and a friendship\r\nwith her then began which continued to the end of his life. Lord\r\nPanmure's confidence in her, and the full authority with which, as\r\nalready related (p. 292), he invested her, were partly due to Colonel\r\nLefroy's reports.[215] At the time when the matter was under discussion,\r\nhe had returned to his post at the War Office, and the papers were sent\r\nto him. His view of the case was the same as Miss Nightingale's, and he\r\nexpressed it with a force inspired by his personal observation, alike of\r\nher services and of her difficulties. The medical men, he wrote in one\r\nminute, are jealous of her mission. \"Dr. Hall would gladly upset it\r\nto-morrow.\" \"A General Order,\" he wrote in another minute, \"recognizing\r\nand defining her position would save her much annoyance and harassing\r\ncorrespondence. It is due, I think, to all she has done and has\r\nsacrificed. Among other reasons for it, it will put a stop to any spirit\r\nof growing independence among these ladies and nurses who are still\r\nunder her, a spirit encouraged with no friendly intention in more than\r\none quarter.\" For many years Colonel Lefroy was one of Miss\r\nNightingale's most constant correspondents on subjects connected with\r\nmilitary hospitals and nurses, and they often co-operated in schemes for\r\nthe welfare of the soldiers. Colonel Lefroy's services to the army,\r\nboth in scientific matters and in philanthropic directions, were long\r\nand distinguished. Miss Nightingale had detractors and opponents in the\r\nservice; but the more progressive an officer was, the more probably may\r\nhe be included among her admirers and supporters.\r\n\r\n  [214] John Henry Lefroy (1817-90), Lieut. R.A., 1837; engaged in a\r\n        magnetical survey, 1839-42; F.R.S., 1848; at the War Office,\r\n        1854-57; inspector-general of army schools, 1857; afterwards\r\n        governor successively of the Bermudas and Tasmania; K.C.M.G., 1877.\r\n\r\n  [215] See a letter of Sidney Herbert printed in _Stanmore_, vol. i.\r\n        p. 417.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                        END OF THE WAR--RETURN HOME\r\n\r\n                            (July-August 1856)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I love the people,\r\n                But do not like to stage me to their eyes.\r\n                Though it do well, I do not relish well\r\n                Their loud applause and _aves_ vehement.\r\n                                                    SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nPeace was signed at Paris on March 30, 1856; but there was still work to\r\nbe done in the Crimean hospitals, and Miss Nightingale remained at\r\nBalaclava, as we have seen, till the beginning of July. On her return to\r\nScutari she was occupied in winding up the affairs of her mission.\r\nMeanwhile the nurses were already beginning to go home. The Reverend\r\nMother (Moore), who had come out from Bermondsey with the first party,\r\nleft the East at the end of April. She had been throughout one of the\r\nmainstays of Miss Nightingale, who wrote to her thus from Balaclava\r\n(April 29): \"God's blessing and my love and gratitude with you, as you\r\nwell know. You know well too that I shall do everything I can for the\r\nSisters whom you have left me. But it will not be like you. Your wishes\r\nwill be our law. And I shall try and remain in the Crimea for their\r\nsakes as long as we are any of us there. I do not presume to express\r\npraise or gratitude to you, Revd. Mother, because it would look as if I\r\nthought you had done the work not unto God but unto me. You were far\r\nabove me in fitness for the General Superintendency, both in worldly\r\ntalent of administration, and far more in the spiritual qualifications\r\nwhich God values in a Superior. My being placed over you in an\r\nunenviable reign in the East was my misfortune and not my fault.\"\r\nAnother of those whom Miss Nightingale described as her mainstays was\r\nMrs. Shaw Stewart, who served in the Crimea as Superintendent of the\r\nnurses, successively in the \"General\" and in the \"Castle\" Hospital, and\r\nof her Miss Nightingale wrote in terms of similarly grateful fervour. I\r\nquote a few of these appreciations (and many more might be added),\r\nbecause it has been supposed, on the strength of isolated expressions\r\npenned in moments of vexation or despondency, that Miss Nightingale was\r\nungenerous in recognition of the work of others.[216] Nothing could be\r\nfurther from the fact. She was, it is true, unsparing in blame wherever\r\nshe saw, or thought she saw, incompetence, or unfaithfulness, or a lack\r\nof single-mindedness; she was also impatient of opposition; and hers was\r\nnot one of those soft natures which readily forget and forgive. But\r\nwherever efficiency and faithful zeal were to be found, she was quick to\r\nrecognize them, and she was as unstinted in praise as in blame. Of Mrs.\r\nShaw Stewart, she wrote to Lady Cranworth (who had succeeded Lady\r\nCanning in good offices towards the nurses): \"Without her our Crimean\r\nwork would have come to grief--without her judgment, her devotion, her\r\nunselfish, consistent looking to the one great end, viz. the carrying\r\nout the work as a whole--without her untiring zeal, her watchful care of\r\nthe nurses, her accuracy in all trusts and accounts, her truth, her\r\nfaithfulness. Her praise and her reward are in higher hands than mine.\"\r\nOf the same \"noble, brave\" lady, Miss Nightingale had written to Mrs.\r\nBracebridge (Nov. 4, 1855): \"Faithfulness is so eminently _her_, that I\r\nhear her Master saying, Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I\r\nwill make thee ruler over many things.\" I could multiply Miss\r\nNightingale's praises of her fellow-workers, for of every one of them\r\nshe sent home to Lady Cranworth a terse character-sketch. This was done\r\nmainly for the sake of the professional nurses, in order that they might\r\nbe helped to find suitable situations on their return. The sketches show\r\nhow close a touch the Lady-in-Chief kept upon her staff, and they reveal\r\nno reluctance either to criticize or to praise. It would be invidious to\r\nparticularize further than to cite Miss Nightingale's appreciation of\r\nher third mainstay, Mrs. Roberts, who came out as a paid nurse with her\r\nin October 1854, and served throughout the war: \"Having been 23 years\r\nSister in St. Thomas's Hospital, her qualifications as a _nurse_ were,\r\nof course, infinitely superior to any other of those with me. She is\r\nindeed a surgical nurse of the first order. Her valuable services have\r\nbeen recognized even and most of all by the surgeons (of Scutari, where\r\nshe has principally been and where, after Inkerman, her exertions were\r\nunremitting). Her total superiority to all the vices of a Hospital\r\nNurse, her faithfulness to the work, her disinterested love of duty and\r\nvigilant care of her patients, her power of work equal to that of _ten_,\r\nhave made her one of the most important persons of the expedition.\"\r\n\r\n  [216] _Stanmore_, vol. i. pp. 404-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nOn June 3 the Secretary of State wrote to Miss Nightingale, \"as the\r\nperiod is now fast approaching when your generous and disinterested\r\nlabours will cease, with the occasion which called them forth,\" to\r\ninquire what arrangements should be made for her return. \"In thus\r\ncontemplating,\" he continued, \"the close of those anxious and trying\r\nduties, which you imposed upon yourself solely with a view to alleviate\r\nthe sufferings of Her Majesty's Army in the East, and which you have\r\naccomplished with a singleness of purpose beyond all praise, it is not\r\nnecessary for me to inform you how highly Her Majesty appreciates the\r\nservices you have rendered to Her Army; as Her Majesty has already\r\nconveyed to you a signal proof of Her gracious approbation. But I desire\r\nnow, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, to offer you our most\r\ncordial thanks for your humane and generous exertions. In doing so, I\r\nfeel confident that I simply express the unanimous feelings of the\r\npeople of this country.\"\r\n\r\nThere were things which Miss Nightingale valued more highly than the\r\napprobation of the people. One of them was correctly surmised by Sir\r\nHenry Storks. Writing to her from Headquarters at Scutari, on July 25,\r\nhe said:--\r\n\r\n     I have received your kind note with mingled feelings of extreme\r\n     pleasure and regret--the former, because I appreciate your good\r\n     opinion very highly; the latter, because your note is a Farewell.\r\n     It will ever be to me a source of pride and gratification to have\r\n     been associated with you in the work which you have performed with\r\n     so much devotion and with so much courage. Amidst the\r\n     acknowledgments you have received from all classes, and from many\r\n     quarters, I feel persuaded there are none more pleasing to yourself\r\n     than the grateful recognition of the poor men you came to succour\r\n     and to save. You will ever live in their remembrance, be assured of\r\n     that; for amongst the faults and vices, which ignorance has\r\n     produced, and a bad system has fostered and matured, ingratitude is\r\n     not one of the defects of the British soldier. I indulge the hope\r\n     that you will permit me hereafter to continue an acquaintance (may\r\n     I say friendship?) which I highly value and appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude of the British soldier was very dear to Miss Nightingale,\r\nand the disposition which she ultimately made of her Crimean decorations\r\nwas characteristic. Before she left the East, the Sultan had presented\r\nher with a diamond bracelet and a sum of money for the nurses and\r\nhospitals, both of which presents the Queen permitted her to\r\naccept.[217] The bracelet, with the badge given by the Queen, may be\r\nseen to-day in the Museum of the United Service Institution, placed\r\nthere in accordance with her desire that they should be deposited \"where\r\nthe soldiers could see them.\"\r\n\r\n  [217] _Panmure_, vol. i. p. 278.\r\n\r\nAt length it was time for Miss Nightingale, having seen off the last of\r\nher nurses, and filed the last of her inventories and accounts, to leave\r\nalso. The Government had offered her a British man-of-war for the voyage\r\nhome. The view she was likely to take of such a proposal had been\r\ncorrectly surmised in the House of Lords some weeks before. On May 5\r\nLord Ellesmere moved the Address on the conclusion of peace. He was\r\nsomething of a poet, as well as a statesman, and this was his last\r\nappearance in the House. In a speech, which was much admired at the\r\ntime, and which may still be read with pleasure as a specimen of the\r\nmore ornate kind of parliamentary eloquence, he paid a tribute to the\r\nmemory of Lord Raglan, and then passed by a happy transition to the\r\nheroine of the war: \"My Lords, the agony of that time has become matter\r\nof history. The vegetation of two successive springs has obscured the\r\nvestiges of Balaclava and Inkerman. Strong voices now answer to the\r\nroll-call, and sturdy forms now cluster round the colours. The ranks are\r\nfull, the hospitals are empty. The angel of mercy still lingers to the\r\nlast on the scene of her labours; but her mission is all but\r\naccomplished. Those long arcades of Scutari in which dying men sat up to\r\ncatch the sound of her footstep or the flutter of her dress, and fell\r\nback content to have seen her shadow as it passed, are now comparatively\r\ndeserted. She may probably be thinking how to escape, as best she may on\r\nher return, the demonstrations of a nation's appreciation of the deeds\r\nand motives of Florence Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe offer of the man-of-war was declined; and Miss Nightingale, with her\r\naunt, sailed in the _Danube_ for Athens, Messina, and Marseilles. A\r\nQueen's messenger was in attendance to help the travellers with\r\npassports. They stayed a night in a humble hotel in Paris (August 4),\r\nand travelling thence, as Miss Smith, she reached London next day. The\r\n\"return of Florence Nightingale is on every one's lips,\" said a letter\r\nof the time, and all the newspaper-world was alert to discover her\r\nmovements. \"Weary and worn as she is,\" wrote her aunt, \"I cannot tell\r\nyou the dread she has of the receptions with which she is threatened.\"\r\nIt became known that on her arrival in England she would proceed at once\r\nto her country-home. Triumphal arches, addresses from mayors and\r\ncorporations, and a carriage drawn by her neighbours were at once\r\nsuggested; but Miss Nightingale had prudently withheld information of\r\nher time-table even from her family, and the public reception was\r\navoided. It had been proposed, too, that the reception should be\r\nmilitary. \"The whole regiments\" of the Coldstreams, the Grenadiers, and\r\nthe Fusiliers \"would like to come, but as that was impossible, they\r\ndesired to send down their three Bands to meet her at the station and\r\nplay her home, whenever she might arrive, whether by day or by night, if\r\nonly they could find out when.\" But the attention even of her soldiers\r\nwas eluded. She lay lost for a night in London, and at eight o'clock\r\nnext morning she presented herself, according to a promise given to the\r\nBermondsey Nuns, at their Convent door. It was the first day of their\r\nannual Retreat, and she rested with them for a few hours. Then, taking\r\nthe train, she reached her home on August 7, 1856, after nearly two\r\nyears' absence in the East, arriving at an unexpected hour, having\r\nwalked up from the little country station. \"A little tinkle of the small\r\nchurch bell on the hills, and a thanksgiving prayer at the little chapel\r\nnext day, were,\" wrote her sister, \"all the innocent greeting.\"\r\n\r\nFlorence's spoils of war, as Lady Verney wrote to Mrs. Gaskell, arrived\r\nin advance, and were characteristic. There was, first, William, a\r\none-legged sailor boy, who was ten months in her hospitals. Occupation\r\nwas found for him. Next there was Peter,[218] a little Russian prisoner\r\nwho came into hospital, and of whom, as he was an orphan, she took\r\ncharge. \"One of the Lady Nurses was his theological instructor, and\r\nasked him where he would go when he died if he were a good boy? He\r\nanswered, 'To Miss Nightingale.' Thirdly, there was a big Crimean puppy,\r\ngiven her by the soldiers. He was found in a hole in the rocks near\r\nBalaclava, and was called 'Rousch,' which is supposed to be 'soldier' in\r\nRussian. A little Russian cat, a similar gift, died on the road; but the\r\nthree remaining are the happiest things I have seen for some time,\r\ncareering about in the intervals of school, where they are made much of,\r\nand 'glory' is more agreeable to them than to their mistress!\" But\r\nFlorence had another Crimean spoil, unknown, perhaps, to her sister,\r\nwhich she accounted one of the most sacred of her possessions. It was a\r\nbunch of grass which she had \"picked out of the ground watered by our\r\nmen's blood at Inkerman.\"\r\n\r\n  [218] Peter Grillage afterwards became man-servant at Embley. See\r\n        Vol. II. p. 302.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\n\"If ever I live to see England again,\" she had written in November 1855,\r\n\"the western breezes of my hill-top home will be my first longing,\r\nthough Olympus with its snowy cap looks fair over our blue Eastern\r\nsea.\" It was to Lea Hurst, then, that she went on her return. It was\r\nthere, ten years before, that she had found a fortnight's happiness in\r\nthe humble work of parish nursing and visiting, and had thought to\r\nherself that with a continuation of such life she would be content.[219]\r\nThe aspirations of her youth were to receive, as this second Part of the\r\nvolume has shown, a larger, a fuller, and a more conspicuous attainment.\r\nYet it would be a mistake to regard Miss Nightingale's mission in the\r\nCrimean War either as the summit of her attainment or the fulfilment of\r\nher life. Rather was it a starting-point.\r\n\r\n  [219] Above, pp. 53, 64.\r\n\r\nHer work in the East did, it is true, attain some great ends, and\r\nsatisfy in some measure the aspiration of her mind and heart. \"She has\r\ndone a great deed,\" wrote a friend in December 1854, \"not less than that\r\nof those who stood at Inkerman or advanced at the Alma; and she has made\r\nthe first move towards wiping away a reproach from this country--that\r\nour women could not do what others do, irreproachably, and with\r\nadvantage to their fellow-creatures.\" She had proved that there was room\r\nfor nurses in British military hospitals. She had shown the way to a new\r\nand high calling for women. \"What Florence has done,\" wrote Lady Verney\r\nto a friend (April 1856), \"towards raising the standard of women's\r\ncapabilities and work is most important. It is quite curious every day\r\nhow questions arise regarding them which are answered quite differently,\r\neven when she is not alluded to, from what they would have been 18\r\nmonths ago.\" Lord Stanley, in the speech at Manchester already\r\nmentioned, had made the same point. \"Mark,\" he said, \"what, by breaking\r\nthrough customs and prejudices, Miss Nightingale has effected for her\r\nsex. She has opened to them a new profession, a new sphere of\r\nusefulness. I do not suppose that, in undertaking her mission, she\r\nthought much of the effect which it might have on the social position of\r\nwomen. Yet probably no one of those who made that question a special\r\nstudy has done half as much as she towards its settlement. A claim for\r\nmore extended freedom of action, based on proved public usefulness in\r\nthe highest sense of the word, with the whole nation to look on and\r\nbear witness, is one which must be listened to, and cannot be easily\r\nrefused.\" Lord Stanley was mistaken in supposing that Miss Nightingale\r\nthought little of the effect of her mission upon the position of women;\r\nfor, though she had misgivings about \"woman's missionaries,\" yet to make\r\n\"a better life for woman\"[220] was an object very near her heart. When\r\nshe was in the Crimea, working as hard as any of the men, confronting\r\ndisease and death with the bravest of them, administering, reforming,\r\ncounselling as energetically as the best of them, this resolute woman\r\nfelt that she and her companions had raised their sex to the height of a\r\ngreat occasion. \"War,\" she wrote to her friend, Mr. Bracebridge (Nov. 4,\r\n1855), \"makes Deborahs and Absaloms and Achitophels; and when, if ever\r\nthe Magnificat has been true, has it been more true than now, every word\r\nof it? My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God\r\nmy Saviour. For He hath regarded the lowliness of His handmaiden.\" The\r\nwords, which had often been in her mouth in moments of despondency and\r\nthwarted yearning,[221] came to her with the sense of happy fulfilment\r\nwhen she had been able to act as the handmaiden of God in the service of\r\nthe sick and wounded soldiers. Her sister, understanding her better in\r\nthe years of attainment than in those of aspiration, wrote to her (Nov.\r\n15, 1855): \"What anxious work you have upon you, my Greatheart, and yet\r\nin spite of it all have you not found your true home--the home of your\r\nspirit?\"\r\n\r\n  [220] See below, p. 385, and above, p. 102.\r\n\r\n  [221] Above, p. 94.\r\n\r\nAll this was true. Yet Miss Nightingale's Crimean mission was, in the\r\nscheme of her life as she had planned it, and in the facts of her life\r\nso far as failing health permitted, not so much a climax, as an episode.\r\nIt was an episode remarkable in itself, and it had given her a\r\nworld-wide reputation; but in reputation she saw nothing except an\r\nopportunity for further work. \"The abilities which she has displayed,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Sidney Herbert in Willis's Rooms, \"cannot be allowed to\r\nslumber. So long as she lives, her labours are marked out for her. The\r\ndiamond has shown itself, and it must not be allowed to return to the\r\nmine.\" Her friend well knew that he was only expressing the feelings of\r\nher own mind. What she sought on her return to England was to utilize\r\nher reputation and her experience for the furtherance of her ideals. Her\r\nexperiences during the Crimean War had enlarged the scope of her work.\r\nShe had gained an insight into military administration, and had shown a\r\ngrasp of the subject, which had caused the Queen and Prince to \"wish we\r\nhad her at the War Office.\" Her first duty, then, was to use her\r\nexperience, so far as opportunity offered, to improve the medical\r\nadministration of the Army. But the main desire of her life had been to\r\nraise nursing to the rank of a trained calling. Her mission to the East\r\nhad not accomplished this object. It had only advertised it, and for the\r\nrest had shown how urgently the thing needed to be done. The world\r\npraised her achievement. She was rather conscious of its shortcoming,\r\nand of the obstacles and difficulties with which it had been attended.\r\nShe came back from the East more resolved than ever to be a pioneer in\r\nthe reform of nursing.\r\n\r\nBut first she needed rest and seclusion. Rest, in which to recuperate\r\nfrom the long strain of labours, hardships, and anxieties. Seclusion, in\r\nwhich to hide herself from publicity and applause. The world praised her\r\nself-sacrifice. She felt that she had made none. Rather had she been\r\nprivileged to attain that harmony between the soul of a human being and\r\nits appointed work, in which, according to her philosophy, lay the union\r\nof man with the Divine Spirit. She shrank from glory in dread of\r\nvain-glory. \"'Paid by the world, what dost thou owe Me?' God might\r\nquestion.\" \"I believe,\" she had written to her father in 1854, shortly\r\nbefore her Call to the Crimea came, \"that there is, within and without\r\nhuman nature, a revelation of eternal existence, eternal progress for\r\nhuman nature. At the same time I believe that to do that part of this\r\nworld's work which harmonizes, accords with the idiosyncrasy of each of\r\nus, is the means by which we may at once render this world the\r\nhabitation of the Divine Spirit in Man, and prepare for other such work\r\nin other of the worlds which surround us. The Kingdom of Heaven is\r\nwithin us. Those words seem to me the most of a revelation, of a New\r\nTestament, of a Gospel--of any that are recorded to have been spoken by\r\nour Saviour.\" Her period of rest was to be very short, as we shall\r\nlearn; but let us leave her communing silently in her chamber with such\r\nthoughts, till another Part opens a new chapter of activity in her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART III\r\n\r\n                      FOR THE HEALTH OF THE SOLDIERS\r\n\r\n                                (1856-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n     We can do no more for those who have suffered and died in their\r\n     country's service; they need our help no longer; their spirits are\r\n     with God who gave them. It remains for us to strive that their\r\n     sufferings may not have been endured in vain--to endeavour so to\r\n     learn from experience as to lessen such sufferings in future by\r\n     forethought and wise management.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (Reply to\r\n     Address from the Parishioners of East Wellow, Dec. 1856).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n               THE QUEEN, MISS NIGHTINGALE, AND LORD PANMURE\r\n\r\n                          (August-November 1856)\r\n\r\n\r\n               To shape the whisper of a throne.--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nWhenever the British people have muddled through a war, there is a time\r\nof repentance and heart-searching. England the Unready turns round\r\nuneasily and thinks that she must now mend her ways. The lessons of the\r\nwar must be learnt. The word \"efficiency\" is blessed in every mouth.\r\nRadical reforms, with a view to ensuring a better state of preparedness\r\nnext time, are canvassed, and a few of them are sometimes carried out.\r\nAnd then to the hot fit, a cold fit succeeds. War and its lessons fade\r\ninto the past. Economy displaces efficiency as the favourite word. Peace\r\nseems to be more likely than another war, and, if war should unhappily\r\ncome, it is cheerily hoped that England will again \"muddle through\r\nsomehow.\" The spasm of reform is over, leaving the permanent _vis\r\ninertiae_ of ministers and departments once more in undisturbed\r\npossession. Reformers, familiar with this succession of flow and ebb,\r\nknow that they must seize the favourable moment, and more or less is\r\ndone, according as they are more or less prompt and energetic. In the\r\nfield of the Army Medical Service, where the Crimean War had exposed\r\ndeficiencies both glaring and terrible, large and far-reaching reforms\r\nwere set in motion during the years immediately following the Crimean\r\npeace. Indeed it may be said that from this period dates the first\r\nserious and sustained movement for the application of sanitary science\r\nto the British Army.\r\n\r\nThat effective use was thus made of the spasm of repentance which\r\nfollowed the Crimean War was due primarily and mainly to the zealous\r\nco-operation of two individuals, the same two whose alliance formed a\r\nprincipal subject of the preceding Part of this Memoir--Sidney Herbert\r\nand Florence Nightingale. When her friend died in 1861, worn out\r\nprematurely by unceasing labours for the British Army, Miss Nightingale\r\ndevoted to his memory an account of his work during the years 1856-1861.\r\nIn that pamphlet[222]--a model of lucidity and concision--while yet\r\ninformed with comprehensive insight, and not untouched by emotion--she\r\nmade no reference of any kind to her own share in the work. She\r\ndescribed the reforms, and said that in all that was done \"Sidney\r\nHerbert was head and centre.\" And so in many respects he was. He was the\r\nChairman of the Royal Commission and the Sub-Commissions. He was\r\nafterwards Minister for War. He was from first to last the official head\r\nof the reform movement. And he was much more than the official head. He\r\nworked with unfailing zeal, and threw his heart and soul into the work.\r\nYet if Sidney Herbert had written the account, he might have said that\r\nFlorence Nightingale was the head and centre of it all. If she could\r\nhave done little without him, so also might he have done little without\r\nher. He was in the foreground, she in the background. His was the public\r\nvoice; the words which he spoke or wrote were often the words of\r\nFlorence Nightingale. He was the practical politician who carried out\r\ntheir common schemes. The initiating, the inspiring, the impelling force\r\nwas hers. And she did much more than give general impetus. Her mastery\r\nof detail was ever at Mr. Herbert's elbow. \"I never intend to tell you,\"\r\nhe wrote to her when the first of the Royal Commissions in which they\r\nco-operated was nearing its end (August 7, 1857), \"how much I owe you\r\nfor all your help during the last three months, for I should never be\r\nable to make you understand how helpless my ignorance would have been\r\namong the Medical Philistines. God bless you!\" But between two such\r\nloyal allies and understanding friends, it were needless to apportion\r\nthe relative shares. They spoke and wrote of their working together as\r\n\"our Cabinet,\" \"our Cabal,\" or \"our Mess.\" It is the story of this\r\ncomradeship, rich in human interest, and fraught with lasting benefit to\r\nthe British Army, that is to form the main subject of this and the\r\nfollowing four chapters.\r\n\r\n  [222] An expansion, issued in 1862, of a memorandum, privately printed\r\n        in 1861. See below, p. 408.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nWhat Miss Nightingale needed on her return from the East, and what, had\r\nshe thought only of herself, she would have taken, was a long spell of\r\nrest. She had been through a campaign of labour and anxiety, under\r\nconditions of strain and distress, such as might have undermined the\r\nstrongest constitution. Mr. Herbert, who was in Ireland when she\r\nreturned to England, surmised from her letters that she was overwrought,\r\nand sent her the prescription of his Carlsbad doctor--_ni lire_, _ni\r\nécrire_, _ni réfléchir_. After such severe tension of mind and body, a\r\nreaction was inevitable. He sent the prescription, but he did not expect\r\nher entirely to adopt it. \"I should doubt,\" he wrote to her uncle, \"with\r\na mind constituted as hers is, whether _entire_ rest, with a total\r\ncessation from all active business, would not be a greater trial and\r\nless effective for her restoration to health than a life of some, though\r\nvery limited and moderate, occupation.\" He seems to have hoped that she\r\nmight be persuaded to take up comparatively quiet nursing work in a\r\nLondon hospital. Presently they met (Sept.) in the country-house of\r\ntheir mutual friends, the Bracebridges, and Mr. Bracebridge thought that\r\nMr. Herbert was \"lukewarm\" on the subject of Army Reform. Perhaps it was\r\nthat he wished to consider Miss Nightingale's health and keep her free\r\nfrom exciting activity. But nothing was further from her thoughts than\r\nneutrality or passive spectatorship. She was burning for the fray, and\r\nflung all consideration of health aside in order to devote herself to\r\nrousing the lukewarm and organizing the resolute.\r\n\r\nTo understand the passionate devotion, the self-sacrificing ardour, with\r\nwhich Miss Nightingale set to work immediately upon her return, we must\r\nremember what she had seen in the East. She had \"identified herself,\" as\r\nwe have heard, \"with the heroic dead,\" and she knew that many of her\r\n\"children,\" as she called them, had died, not of necessity, but from\r\nneglect. \"No one,\" she wrote,[223] \"can feel for the Army as I do. These\r\npeople who talk to us have all fed their children on the fat of the land\r\nand dressed them in velvet and silk, while we have been away. I have had\r\nto see my children dressed in a dirty blanket and an old pair of\r\nregimental trousers, and to see them fed on raw salt meat, and nine\r\nthousand of my children are lying, from causes which might have been\r\nprevented, in their forgotten graves. But I can never forget. People\r\nmust have seen that long, long dreadful winter to know what it was.\"\r\nOthers might know the facts, but she _felt_ them. The strength of her\r\ncharacter and powers lay, however, in the combination of intense feeling\r\nwith intellectual grasp. She not only felt the neglect which had\r\nsacrificed her children's lives, but she tabulated the causes. The facts\r\nwhich had come under her eye, the figures in which she summarized and\r\nanalysed them, filled her with a passion of resentment. During her\r\nresidence in the Eastern hospitals she had seen 4600 soldiers die. And\r\nas she studied the figures, the conclusion was irresistibly borne in\r\nupon her that the greater number need not have died at all. Many of the\r\ndiseases to which they had succumbed were induced, and others were\r\naggravated, in the hospitals themselves. Her personal observation told\r\nher that it was so; statistical inquiry proved it. \"We had,\" she pointed\r\nout, \"during the first seven months of the Crimean campaign, a mortality\r\namong the troops at the rate of 60 per cent per annum from _disease_\r\nalone, a rate of mortality which exceeds that of the Great Plague in\r\nLondon, and a higher ratio than the mortality in cholera to the\r\nattacks.\" By a series of reforms, largely the result of Miss\r\nNightingale's own untiring efforts and vehement expostulations, this\r\nterrible rate of mortality was reduced. \"We had, during the last six\r\nmonths of the war, a mortality among our _sick_ not much more than among\r\nour _healthy_ guards at home, and a mortality among our troops, in the\r\nlast five months, two-thirds only of what it is among our troops at\r\nhome.\" It was obvious from this comparison that the mortality during the\r\nfirst period was largely preventable. Here was \"a complete\r\nexample--history does not afford its equal--of an army, after a great\r\ndisaster arising from neglects, having been brought into the highest\r\nstate of health and efficiency.\" It was the most complete experiment\r\never made in army hygiene. And Miss Nightingale was filled with a\r\npassionate desire that the lessons of the experiment should be taken to\r\nheart by the nation; that such radical reforms should be made as would\r\nrender a repetition of the disaster and the neglects impossible in the\r\nfuture. She knew that nothing short of radical reform would suffice.\r\n\"There is nothing,\" she wrote in summarizing the neglect of sanitary\r\nprecautions at Scutari, \"in the education of the Medical\r\nOfficer--nothing in the organization or powers of the Army Medical\r\nDepartment--nothing in the whole Hospital procedure--nothing in the Army\r\nRegulations which would have met the case of these Hospitals. And were a\r\nsimilar necessity to arise again, especially after the lapse of a few\r\nyears of peace, the whole thing would occur over again. This is the\r\nfrightful consideration which ought to make us recall over and over\r\nagain this experience--otherwise, let bygones be bygones.\"[224]\r\n\r\n  [223] In a letter, dated Feb. 9, 1857, of which she kept a copy. To whom\r\n        addressed does not appear.\r\n\r\n  [224] _Notes_, sec. iii. p. viii.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the whole case. Miss Nightingale carried further the\r\nprinciple, which in these days is perhaps at last coming to be\r\nunderstood, that success in war depends upon preparation in peace. \"You\r\ncannot improvise an Army,\" says Lord Roberts. \"You cannot improvise the\r\nsanitary care of an Army in the field,\" said Miss Nightingale. If the\r\nmedical service in the field were deficient, if the lessons of sanitary\r\nscience were neglected in war hospitals, it was probable, she perceived,\r\nthat there were like defects at home. She put her thesis to the test of\r\nfigures, and was appalled at the verification which they supplied. The\r\nidea had first occurred to her on meeting Dr. Farr, the statistician in\r\nthe Registrar-General's office, at dinner with her friends Colonel and\r\nMrs. Tulloch. Dr. Farr had talked of mortality tables in civil life, and\r\nMiss Nightingale resolved to compare them with the death-rate in\r\nBritish barracks. She found that in the Army, from the age of twenty to\r\nthirty-five, the mortality was nearly double that which it was in civil\r\nlife. This was the case even in the Guards, who yet were select lives,\r\nthe pick of the recruits. \"With our present amount of sanitary\r\nknowledge,\" she wrote to Sir John McNeill (March 1, 1857), \"it is as\r\ncriminal to have a mortality of 17, 19, and 20 per 1000 in the Line,\r\nArtillery, and Guards in England, when that of Civil life is only 11 per\r\n1000, as it would be to take 1100 men per annum out upon Salisbury Plain\r\nand shoot them--no body of men being so much under control, none so\r\ndependent upon their employers for health, life, and morality as the\r\nArmy.\" And again (March 28): \"This disgraceful state of our Chatham\r\nHospitals, which I have been visiting lately,[225] is only one more\r\nsymptom of a system which, in the Crimea, put to death 16,000 men--the\r\nfinest experiment modern history has seen upon a large scale, viz. as to\r\nwhat given number may be put to death at will by the sole agency of bad\r\nfood and bad air.\" She saw the facts and figures with piercing\r\nclearness, and personal recollections gave intensity to her convictions.\r\nShe had deep pity for the victims of preventable disease, and still\r\ndeeper admiration for the uncomplaining heroism with which such\r\nsufferings were borne. Nothing ever effaced from her mind what she had\r\nwitnessed in this sort at Scutari and in the Crimea. \"We hear with\r\nhorror,\" she wrote, \"of the loss of 400 men on board the _Birkenhead_ by\r\ncarelessness at sea; but what should we feel if we were told that 1100\r\nmen are annually doomed to death in our Army at home by causes which\r\nmight be prevented? The men in the _Birkenhead_ went down with a cheer.\r\nSo will our men fight for us to the last with a cheer. The more reason\r\nwhy all the means of health which Sanitary Science has put at our\r\ncommand, all the means of morality which Educational Science has given\r\nus, should be given them.\" Then she turned to the Crimea, described in\r\nthe words of Sir John McNeill and Colonel Tulloch[226] the sufferings\r\nand the endurance of the troops, and drew her moral: \"Upon those who\r\nwatched, week after week and month after month, this enduring courage,\r\nthis unalterable patience, simplicity, and good strength, this voiceless\r\nstrength to suffer and be still, it has made an impression never to be\r\nforgotten. The Anglo-Saxon on the Crimean heights has won for himself a\r\ngreater name than the Spartan at Thermopylae, as the six months'\r\nstruggle to endure was a greater proof of what man can do than the six\r\nhours' struggle to fight. The traces of the name and sacrifice of\r\nIphigeneia may still be seen in Taurus; but a greater sacrifice has been\r\nthere accomplished by a 'handful' of brave men who defended that fatal\r\nposition, even to the death. And if Inkerman now bears a name like that\r\nof Thermopylae, so is the story of those terrible trenches, through\r\nwhich these men patiently and deliberately, and week after week, went,\r\ntill they returned no more, greater than that of Inkerman. Truly were\r\nthe Sebastopol trenches, to our men, like the gate of the Infernal\r\nRegions--_Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch' entrate_. And yet these men\r\nwould refuse to report themselves sick, lest they should throw more\r\nlabour on their comrades. They would draw their blankets over their\r\nheads and die without a word. Well may it be said that there is hardly\r\nan example in history to compare with this long and silent fortitude.\r\nBut surely the blood of such men is calling to us from the ground, not\r\nto avenge them, but to have mercy on their survivors![227] To that cry,\r\nFlorence Nightingale, at least, responded through every fibre of her\r\nbeing. She was resolved to be \"a saviour,\" and to press home every\r\nlesson of the Crimean campaign.\r\n\r\n  [225] See below, p. 349.\r\n\r\n  [226] _Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Supplies of the\r\n        British Army_, pp. 2, 3.\r\n\r\n  [227] _Notes on the Army_, pp. 249-50, 507-8. The latter passage\r\n        continues with some words which Miss Nightingale had previously\r\n        written, and which I have quoted as a motto for the present\r\n        Part (p. 309).\r\n\r\nThe strength of her resolve was heightened by a sense of the\r\nresponsibility which her opportunities laid upon her. She had enjoyed\r\npeculiar facilities for observing the whole medical history of the\r\ncampaign. She had been able to take the measure of many of the military\r\nand medical officials; she knew which were the men from whom help might\r\nbe expected in the work of reform, and of most of such men she had the\r\near and the respect. Her popular fame added to the authority with which\r\nher experience and her services invested her. There were others who\r\nknew, or might have known, the facts as well as she. There were few who\r\ncould exercise the same influence, and perhaps there was not one who\r\ncould judge the facts with the same disinterestedness. She was not a\r\npolitician. She had no party to defend, no officials to shield, no\r\nsusceptibilities to consider. She had nothing to gain, nothing to lose,\r\nnothing to fear. She stood only for a cause; and, come what might, she\r\nwas resolved to fling every power of mind and body into it. Among her\r\nprivate notes of 1856 I find this: \"I stand at the altar of the murdered\r\nmen, and, while I live, I fight their cause.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe opportunity was not long in coming. For a week or two at Lea Hurst\r\nshe was engaged in such laborious, but unexciting, tasks as settling\r\naccounts and claims with the nurses; distributing the Sultan's gift\r\namong them; answering congratulatory addresses and the like; escaping\r\nfrom public appearances;[228] and dealing with hailstorms, as her sister\r\ncalled them, of miscellaneous letters. She was besieged by Vegetarians,\r\nSpiritualists, Sectaries, and other birds of the feather that swoop down\r\nupon conspicuous personages. With distressed gentlewomen she was a\r\nfavourite prey. \"Can you find soldiers' orphans for me to educate,\"\r\nwrote one, \"because I don't like leaving my sisters?\" \"Please find a\r\nplace for me,\" wrote another, \"where there will be something to do not\r\nderogatory. I am an Irish lady of family.\" The begging-letters were\r\ninnumerable, and the answering of these was taken over by her sister. \"I\r\nthink I can now repeat the formula to perfection,\" she said, \"and I\r\ncould write a begging-letter at the shortest notice in the character of\r\nevery individual, from a staff-officer to a costermonger, and a widow\r\nwith six children.\" But here Lady Verney's lively pen suggests some\r\nlittle injustice. Officers did occasionally write to Miss Nightingale, I\r\nfind, to beg her \"vote and interest,\" as it were; but of begging-letters\r\nproper, she told Mr. Kinglake that there had never come one to her from\r\na soldier.[229] Mr. Kinglake, I may here say, made her acquaintance in\r\nthe spring of 1857, when her mind was full of the McNeill-Tulloch\r\n_affaire_. She failed to make him take her view of that\r\ncontroversy,[230] and her first impression of the historian-to-be of the\r\nCrimean War was that he would write a book more brilliant than judicial.\r\n\"Though I have no doubt he is a good counsel,\" she wrote,[231] \"he\r\nstrikes me as a very bad historian.\" Three years later, she wrote in a\r\nsimilar strain:--\r\n\r\n     I had two hours' good conversation with Mr. Kinglake. I found him\r\n     exceedingly courteous and agreeable; looking upon the whole idea as\r\n     a work of art and emotion, and upon me as one of the colours in the\r\n     picture; upon the Chelsea Board as a safe (or rather an infallible)\r\n     authority; upon McNeill and Tulloch as interlopers; upon figures\r\n     (arithmetical) as worthless; upon assertion as proof. He was\r\n     utterly and _self-sufficiently_ in the dark as to all the real\r\n     causes of the Crimean Mortality. And you might as well try to\r\n     enlighten Sir G. Brown himself. For Lord Raglan he has an\r\n     enthusiasm which _I fully share_ but which entirely blinds Mr.\r\n     Kinglake, who besides came home long before the real distress, to\r\n     the causes of that distress. I put him in possession of some of the\r\n     materials. But I do not hope that he will, I am quite sure that he\r\n     will not, make use of them.[232]\r\n\r\n  [228] Her sister used to describe the disappointment of herself and her\r\n        mother when Florence refused to accompany them to a garden-party at\r\n        Chatsworth. The Duke of Devonshire was a great admirer of Miss\r\n        Nightingale's work, and formed a collection of newspaper cuttings\r\n        about it, which he presented to the Derby Free Library. He\r\n        presented Miss Nightingale with a silver owl, in recognition of her\r\n        wisdom, and in memory of her pet (see above, p. 160).\r\n\r\n  [229] _Invasion of the Crimea_, vol. vi. p. 426 _n._\r\n\r\n  [230] See below, p. 336.\r\n\r\n  [231] In a letter to Sir John McNeill, May 3, 1857.\r\n\r\n  [232] Letter to Edwin Chadwick, Oct. 17, 1860. He had urged her to see\r\n        Mr. Kinglake with a view to indoctrinating him with the true moral\r\n        of the Crimean muddles.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale here was wrong. Mr. Kinglake made considerable use of\r\nher materials, and drew from them and from his personal impressions an\r\nexcellent picture of the Lady-in-Chief; though on the point about which\r\nshe was concerned, the McNeill-Tulloch _affaire_, he remained of the\r\nsame opinion still.\r\n\r\nOf Miss Nightingale's demeanour during her short holiday at home in\r\nAugust 1856, there is a pleasant account in a letter from her\r\nsister[233]:--\r\n\r\n     She is better, I think, but I quite hate the sight of the post with\r\n     its long official envelopes. She will go on as long as she has\r\n     strength doing everything which cannot be left without detriment to\r\n     the work to which she has devoted her life. I cannot conceive\r\n     anything more beautiful than her frame of mind. It is so calm, so\r\n     cheerful, so simple. The physical hardships one does not wonder at\r\n     her forgetting to speak of; but the marvel to me is how the mental\r\n     ones,--the indifference, the ignorance, the cruelty, the falsehood\r\n     she has had to encounter--never seem to ruffle her for an instant\r\n     (and never have done, Aunt Mai says). It is as if she dwelt in\r\n     another atmosphere of peace and trust in Him which nothing wicked\r\n     can dim. She speaks of these things sadly and quietly as some one\r\n     from another world might do, seeing so plainly the excuses for the\r\n     wrong-doers, while the personal part never seems to come in, and\r\n     there is such a charm about her perfect simplicity. There is not\r\n     the smallest particle of the martyr about her; she is as merry\r\n     about little things as ever, in the intervals of her great thought,\r\n     and with as much interest about the little things of home as if she\r\n     had not been wielding the management and organization of the\r\n     material and spiritual comfort of the 50,000 men passing through\r\n     hospital and out. If you heard all the evidence we have had lately\r\n     from doctors, chaplains and officers, you would not think I am\r\n     exaggerating in saying that these depended mainly upon her during\r\n     the whole of these 21 months. As to her indifference to praise, it\r\n     is most extraordinary; she just passes on and does not heed it, as\r\n     it comes in every morning in its flood--papers, music, poetry,\r\n     friends, letters, addresses.\r\n\r\n  [233] To Miss Ellen Tollet from Lea Hurst.\r\n\r\nThe addresses and presentations which she most valued came from\r\nworking-men. A case of Sheffield cutlery, presented by artisans in that\r\ncity, was always treasured, and was the subject of a specific bequest in\r\nher will. She was much touched by an address from 1800 working-men at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. \"My dear friends,\" she wrote in the course of her\r\nreply (August 1856), \"the things that are deepest in our hearts are\r\nperhaps what it is most difficult to express. 'She hath done what she\r\ncould.' These words I inscribed on the tomb of one of my best helpers\r\nwhen I left Scutari. It has been my endeavour, in the sight of God, to\r\ndo as she has done.\"\r\n\r\nPresently there came to Lea Hurst a letter of much importance in Miss\r\nNightingale's life. Her friend, Sir James Clark, the Queen's physician,\r\nwrote from Osborne (August 23, 1856) begging her to stay during the\r\nfollowing month at his home, Birk Hall, near Ballater. The air of\r\nScotland would be beneficial, he said, to her health; and there were\r\nother reasons. The Court would shortly be moved to Balmoral. The Queen\r\nwould doubtless invite Miss Nightingale there. Meanwhile Her Majesty\r\nknew of the present invitation; and there would be opportunity at Birk\r\nHall for quiet and informal talk in addition to any \"command\" visit at\r\nBalmoral. Miss Nightingale heard in this letter a call hardly less\r\nimportant than that to the Crimea, two years before. She had served with\r\nthe Queen's army in the East. Her services had received sympathetic\r\nsupport and approbation from the Queen and the Prince. She was now to\r\nhave full opportunities for bringing to their knowledge, in personal\r\nintercourse, what she had seen of the soldiers' sufferings, and for\r\nenlisting their support, if she could, in what she knew to be necessary\r\nfor the prevention of such sufferings in the future. She succeeded, as\r\nwill presently appear; and she deserved her success by the thoroughness\r\nwith which she prepared herself to make the best use of her opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe two men who had thrown light most searchingly on the defects of the\r\ncampaign, in the matter of supply and transport, were Sir John McNeill\r\nand Colonel Tulloch. Miss Nightingale arranged to see and confer with\r\nthe former at Edinburgh on her way to Ballater. Colonel Tulloch, though\r\nhe was far distant at the time, agreed to join the conclave, and,\r\nmeanwhile, he wrote (from Killin, Sept. 6): \"If H.M. should afford you\r\nan opportunity of telling the whole truth, as I think it likely she\r\nwishes to do from her desire to see you under another roof, without her\r\nenquiries being noticed, perhaps you might bring to her knowledge,\"\r\netc., etc. [various points which he deemed of special importance]. Mr.\r\nHerbert's advice was more general. \"I hope,\" he wrote (Sept. 9), \"that\r\nyour Highland foray will do you good. I am sure it will, if you find\r\nhelp and encouragement for your plans. I hope you will talk fully, and\r\nillustrate by facts and details. They explain best. Men and women\r\nrequire picture-books, just as much as children, when they are to learn\r\nsomething of which they know nothing previously.\" She armed herself, by\r\nstudy of statistics, by collection of her notes and memoranda, by\r\ninquiries on all sides, for every occasion which the sympathetic\r\ninterest of the Queen or the Prince might give her. She felt, and others\r\nfelt, that great things might turn on her use of such occasions. The\r\nfullest and most suggestive letter which she received was from Colonel\r\nLefroy. He was employed at the War Office. He knew the weaknesses of his\r\nChief. He knew also the strength of the Department to resist. He had\r\nbeen employed, as we have heard already,[234] on a confidential mission\r\nto the Crimea, and had formed the highest opinion of \"the glorious\r\nfidelity, the self-sacrifice, the heroic courage, and single-minded\r\ndevotion\" with which Miss Nightingale had performed her duties in the\r\nEast. He looked for great results from her visit to Scotland:--\r\n\r\n     (_Colonel Lefroy to Miss Nightingale._) _August_ 28.... I never had\r\n     the good fortune to have an interview with the Queen, but I have\r\n     had several with Prince Albert. The Prince exhibited such a\r\n     remarkable knowledge of the subjects he was enquiring about, so\r\n     strong and clear and business-like a capacity that you will, I\r\n     think, find it both expedient and necessary, or rather unavoidable,\r\n     to enter into a full and unreserved communication of your\r\n     observations, and be tempted irresistibly to let fall such\r\n     suggestions as are most likely to germinate in that high latitude.\r\n     If I am correct in this impression, a similar frankness with Lord\r\n     Panmure follows. I was once amused by the Prince remarking on a\r\n     point of military education, \"I have urged it over and over again;\r\n     they do not mind what I say,\" showing that even he cannot always\r\n     overcome the _vis inertiae_ of Departmental indifference or prevail\r\n     on people to move. It may be so in any question of medical reform.\r\n     Lord Panmure hates detail, and does not appreciate system. He can\r\n     reform but not organise. It is organisation we want, but which\r\n     arouses every instinct of resistance in the British bosom, and it\r\n     is this which can be least influenced by H.M.'s personal interest\r\n     in it. Like a rickety clumsy machine, with a pin loose here and a\r\n     tooth broken there, and a makeshift somewhere else, in which the\r\n     force of Hercules may be exhausted in a needless friction and\r\n     obscure hitches before the hands are got to move, so is our\r\n     Executive, with the Treasury, the Horse Guards, the War Department,\r\n     the Medical Department all out of gear, but all required to move\r\n     together before a result can be attained. He will be stronger than\r\n     Hercules, who gets out of it the movement we require. I think I\r\n     would recommend ... [a long statement of suggested reforms,\r\n     including \"a Commission to enquire into the existing Regulations\r\n     for Hospital Administration\"]. In some form or other we have almost\r\n     a right to ask at your hands an account of the trials you have gone\r\n     through, the difficulties you have encountered, and the evils you\r\n     have observed--not only because no other person ever was or can be\r\n     in such a position to give it, but because, permit me to say, no\r\n     one else is so gifted. It will be no ordinary task; and no ordinary\r\n     powers of reasoning, illustrating, grouping facts will be\r\n     requisite. Another might repeat what you told him, but the burning\r\n     conviction, the _vis viva_ of the soul cannot be imparted.... It\r\n     appears to me that either a confidential report addressed to Lord\r\n     Panmure _upon a formal request_, or evidence before such a\r\n     Commission as I have proposed above would be suitable means--the\r\n     latter the most so, as I fear that more publicity than attends\r\n     confidential reports will be necessary. I earnestly hope that your\r\n     interviews with the Queen and Lord Panmure may be the means of\r\n     leading both to interest themselves effectually in the vital\r\n     reforms required. The axe has to be laid to the root of the tree\r\n     yet.\r\n\r\n  [234] See above, p. 297.\r\n\r\nVarious friends tendered advice as to what Miss Nightingale should say\r\nif she were to be asked what the Queen could \"do for her.\" She might\r\npetition to be placed in charge of the new hospital about to be built at\r\nNetley, or to be appointed Lady Superintendent of Nurses in all military\r\nhospitals, and so forth. Her own ideas were on the lines of Colonel\r\nLefroy's letter. She would, first, tell the whole truth of the campaign,\r\nso far as it had come under her personal observation. If given any\r\nencouragement to proceed, she would explain in general terms the kind of\r\nremedies which she deemed essential. She would offer, if the\r\nconversation took a suitable turn, to embody her observations and\r\nsuggestions in a written report. If further honoured by any suggestion\r\nof Royal favour, she would ask--for herself, nothing but for the sake of\r\nthe soldiers, a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole condition of\r\nbarracks, hospitals, and the Army Medical Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThus armed, and thus resolved, Miss Nightingale set out for Scotland,\r\nunder her father's escort. Between father and daughter there was genuine\r\naffection; but Mr. Nightingale was in indifferent health, and was\r\nconstitutionally of a retiring disposition. After a few days he beat a\r\nretreat. It had been supposed that the \"foray\" would be short. In fact\r\nit lasted for a month. Miss Nightingale reached Edinburgh on September\r\n15, and, staying there a few days, took occasion to inspect the barracks\r\nand hospitals. She left for Birk Hall on September 19, and two days\r\nlater she was introduced to the Queen and the Prince at Balmoral by Sir\r\nJames Clark. \"She put before us,\" wrote the Prince in his diary, \"all\r\nthe defects of our present military hospital system, and the reforms\r\nthat are needed. We are much pleased with her; she is extremely\r\nmodest.\"[235] A few days later (Sept. 26) the Queen drove over from\r\nBalmoral to Birk Hall, and Miss Nightingale had \"tea and a great talk\"\r\nwith Her Majesty. The impression made on the Queen has been already\r\nrecorded in her letter to the Duke of Cambridge: \"I wish we had her at\r\nthe War Office.\" The Duke, who was not exactly a red-hot reformer, must\r\nhave been thankful that the wish of his August Relative for a new broom\r\ndid not extend to the Horse Guards. \"My hopes were somewhat raised,\"\r\nwrote Miss Nightingale to Sir John McNeill (Sept. 27), \"by the great\r\nwillingness of the Queen, Prince Albert, and Sir George Grey, all of\r\nwhom I have seen together and separately, to listen and to ask\r\nquestions.\" \"I have had most satisfactory interviews,\" she wrote to her\r\nUncle Sam (Sept. 25), \"with the Queen, the Prince, and Sir George Grey.\r\nSatisfactory, that is, as far as their _will_, not as their _power_ is\r\nconcerned.\" Miss Nightingale is not the only impatient reformer who has\r\nbeen tempted to wish that knots of red tape could be cut by a direct\r\nexercise of the Royal Prerogative. The Prince knew \"in what limits\" he\r\nand the Queen moved. Nothing could be done except through Ministers, and\r\nthe Minister for War would shortly be in attendance at Balmoral. \"The\r\nQueen,\" continued Miss Nightingale, \"wished me to remain to see Lord\r\nPanmure here rather than in London, because she thinks it more likely\r\nthat something might be done with him here with her to back me. I don't.\r\nBut I am obliged to succumb.\" So she stayed on at Birk Hall, her\r\n\"command\" visit to Balmoral being postponed till Lord Panmure should\r\narrive. The Queen sent a good character of Miss Nightingale to the\r\nMinister in advance. \"Lord Panmure,\" she wrote, \"will be much gratified\r\nand struck with Miss Nightingale--her powerful, clear head, and simple,\r\nmodest manner.\"[236] The Queen had \"accepted with great grace\" the\r\nsuggestion that any letter of recommendations sent by Miss Nightingale\r\nto Lord Panmure should be sent also to Her Majesty direct.\r\n\r\n  [235] _Life of the Prince Consort_, vol. iii. p. 503.\r\n\r\n  [236] _Panmure_, vol. ii. p. 306.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThe point of interest among Miss Nightingale's Reform \"Cabinet\" now\r\nshifted from the Queen to her Ministers. The Court had been won. \"Lord\r\nAuckland says,\" wrote Lady Verney to her sister, \"that he hears from\r\nLord Clarendon that the Queen was enchanted with you.\" But what\r\nimpression would she make upon the less susceptible \"Bison\" (for so the\r\nburly Scot, Lord Panmure, was called by Miss Nightingale and her\r\nfriends)? She had reported herself to him immediately on her return from\r\nthe East, and he had replied politely, but postponed the pleasure of an\r\ninterview. Mr. Herbert was not sure that much would come of it even in\r\nthe sympathetic air of Balmoral. \"I gather,\" he wrote (Oct. 3), \"that\r\nupon the whole you are pleased with the result of your conversations\r\nwith the Queen and Prince Albert. I hope you will do equally well with\r\nPanmure, tho' I am not sanguine; for, tho' he has plenty of shrewd\r\nsense, there is a _vis inertiae_ in his resistance which is very\r\ndifficult to overcome.\" Sir John McNeill was more hopeful. He attached\r\ngreat importance to the personal factor in Miss Nightingale's favour:--\r\n\r\n     \"I anticipate considerable advantage,\" he wrote (Sept. 29), \"from\r\n     your interview with Lord Panmure. He has seen your name in every\r\n     newspaper, and probably has no very accurate, or perhaps a very\r\n     inaccurate notion, of what sort of person Miss Florence Nightingale\r\n     is. He may perhaps think that a lady whose name is so frequently\r\n     mentioned can hardly be indifferent to popular applause and that\r\n     with so strong a hold upon the feelings of the nation, she is not\r\n     unlikely to use it for the gratification of personal ambition. If\r\n     he has such notions, he will be undeceived. He will find that\r\n     influenced by higher motives you have no desire to employ your\r\n     influence for any other purpose than to do all the good you can in\r\n     the work which you have chosen, and that the absence of personal\r\n     motive it is which gives you the courage and the right to speak\r\n     fearlessly the whole truth, and to persevere in the direct line of\r\n     duty whatever may be the difficulties or the obstacles. He will see\r\n     that you have no desire to become in any sense a rival, and that it\r\n     rests with him to make you a co-adjutor or an opponent, as he may\r\n     be willing or unwilling to promote the good which you consider it\r\n     your plain duty as far as in you lies to carry out.\"\r\n\r\nSir John's attitude to Miss Nightingale was always a little paternal,\r\nand I think that we may perhaps read between the lines of his\r\nwell-turned sentences a hint and a caution, under the guise of an\r\nencomium. The hint was not needed. She was entirely free from any\r\ntemptation to use her popularity for purposes of personal ambition; but\r\nshe was to show considerable skill in the use of it, as a weapon in\r\nreserve, for furthering her public objects. Mr. Herbert and Sir John\r\nMcNeill were both right. The personal factor prevailed, as Sir John\r\nhoped; and Miss Nightingale won the Minister, even as she had won the\r\nCourt--or seemed to win him. He promised all she asked; but it was also\r\nas Mr. Herbert feared, and the force of passive resistance was long\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Panmure reached Balmoral, Miss Nightingale was commanded\r\nthither. The Court Circular (Oct. 6) chronicled her attendance at church\r\nwith the Queen, and at the ball given to the gillies it was noticed that\r\nshe was seated with the Royal Family. She had an opportunity to \"tell\r\nthe Prince the whole story\" of her experiences in the East. Another side\r\nof her interests also came into play on this occasion. She had talks\r\nwith Prince Albert \"on metaphysics and religion.\" Then Lord Panmure,\r\nfollowing in the steps of his Sovereign, went to see Miss Nightingale\r\nat Birk Hall, and they had long conversations. \"You may like to know,\"\r\nwrote Mr. John Clark[237] (Oct. 13), \"that you fairly overcame Pan. We\r\nfound him with his mane absolutely silky, and a loving sadness pervading\r\nhis whole being.\" \"I forget whether I told you,\" wrote Sidney Herbert\r\n(Nov. 2), \"that the Bison wrote to me very much pleased with his\r\ninterview with you. He says that he was very much surprised at your\r\nphysical appearance, as I think you must have been with his. God bless\r\nyou!\" Lord Panmure, I suspect, was one of those men who presume that any\r\nstrong-minded woman will be physically ill-favoured. At any rate Miss\r\nNightingale greatly impressed the Minister, even as the Queen had\r\npredicted. In general terms, Lord Panmure seemed very favourable to Miss\r\nNightingale's suggestions. It was agreed that she should presently write\r\nout her experiences with notes on necessary reforms for the information\r\nof the Government, and in this request the Prime Minister, Lord\r\nPalmerston, associated himself with Lord Panmure. The Minister for War\r\nseemed well disposed towards a scheme to which she attached great\r\nimportance--the establishment of an Army Medical School. He agreed in\r\nprinciple to the appointment of a Royal Commission. So she had gained,\r\nit seemed, all she wanted, and the Minister threw in an additional point\r\nof his own.[238] The plans for the hospital at Netley--the first General\r\nMilitary Hospital--were at this time far advanced. Lord Panmure would\r\nsend the plans to Miss Nightingale, and would be much obliged for her\r\nremarks upon them. Conversation on this and all the other subjects just\r\nmentioned was to be resumed when they would both be in London in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n  [237] Son of Sir James, whom he succeeded in the baronetcy; married to\r\n        Charlotte Coltman. There was afterwards a family connection with\r\n        the Nightingales, as Lady Clark's nephew, Mr. William Coltman,\r\n        married Miss Nightingale's cousin, Bertha Smith.\r\n\r\n  [238] Which, however, may not improbably have been suggested to him by\r\n        the Queen. For Her Majesty's initiative and keen interest in the\r\n        matter of the Netley Hospital, see _Life of the Prince Consort_,\r\n        vol. iii. pp. 227, 491.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nWhen news of the spoils, which Miss Nightingale had brought back from\r\nher Highland \"foray,\" reached her little \"Cabinet\" of reformers, their\r\nhopes ran high, and arrangements were promptly made for meetings and\r\nconsultations. The Lady-in-Chief broke her journey southwards at\r\nEdinburgh, in order to confer again with Sir John McNeill. On October 15\r\nshe was back at Lea Hurst, and entered into correspondence with other of\r\nthe confederates. On November 2, she came to London, making her\r\nheadquarters at the Burlington in Old Burlington Street, the favourite\r\nhostelry at this time of her family: a house which came to be known\r\namong those behind the scenes as \"The Little War Office.\" She drew up\r\nlists of an ideal Royal Commission, and circulated it among her allies\r\nfor their suggestions, and, in the case of those whom she proposed to\r\nnominate, for their consent. One of these latter was her friend and\r\nphysician at Scutari, Dr. Sutherland. \"I have just received your\r\nletter,\" he wrote (Nov. 12), \"and am led to believe that there must be a\r\nfoundation of truth under the old myth about the Amazon women somewhere\r\nto the East of Scutari. All I can say is that if you had been queen of\r\nthat respectable body in old days, Alexander the Great would have had\r\nrather a bad chance. Your project has developed itself far better than I\r\nexpected, and I think I see a way of doing good and therefore I shall\r\nserve on the Commission. _Get Alexander_. Nobody else if you cannot. He\r\nis our man. I am to meet you to-night at Sir James Clark's to dinner,\r\nand shall be very glad to talk over the subject further.\" Dr. Sutherland\r\nassumed, it will be seen, that the Amazon would carry him in; and she\r\ndid. Over Dr. Alexander there was a stiff fight. Miss Nightingale had\r\nbeen greatly impressed in the Crimea by his skill, fearlessness, and\r\nactivity. He had now received an appointment in Canada, and Lord Panmure\r\nobjected to recalling him; but Mr. Herbert made his own acceptance of\r\nthe Chairmanship conditional on the appointment of Dr. Alexander, \"the\r\nablest and most effective man with our Army.\"[239] Sir James Clark's\r\nconsent to serve was doubtless secured at the dinner just mentioned. Sir\r\nJames Ranald Martin was also willing, and he had a candidate of his own.\r\n\"Farr,\" he wrote to Colonel Tulloch (Nov. 11), \"ought to be a member. I\r\nwish you would take an early opportunity of bringing the question\r\nbefore Miss Nightingale with all the force of which you are capable.\"\r\nShe was already in correspondence with Dr. William Farr; they had a link\r\nin their common passion for statistics. She did not succeed in carrying\r\nhim on to the Commission, but they collaborated in the preparation of\r\nstatistical evidence for it. Then she approached Sir Henry Storks, who\r\nwas willing to serve. She hoped to be able to include her friend Colonel\r\nLefroy also, but there she failed. That Sidney Herbert was the Chairman\r\nof her choice goes without saying. The other appointment to which she\r\nnaturally attached vital importance was that of a secretary, and her\r\nchoice fell upon Dr. Graham Balfour.[240] Having settled the\r\nCommissioners, Miss Nightingale proceeded to draft their Instructions,\r\nand this draft also she circulated for criticism and advice.\r\n\r\n  [239] _Stanmore_, vol. ii. p. 121.\r\n\r\n  [240] Thomas Graham Balfour (1813-1891), M.D. of Edinburgh; compiler of\r\n        the first four volumes of _Statistics of the British Army_;\r\n        assistant-surgeon to the Grenadier Guards.\r\n\r\nShe was now ready for the promised interview with Lord Panmure. On the\r\nmorning of the fateful day, Sir James Clark wrote to her: \"I think it\r\nwould be well when you see Lord Panmure to make him understand that the\r\nenquiry is intended as, and must comprehend, an investigation into the\r\nwhole Medical Department of the Army, and everything regarding the\r\nhealth of the Army.\" A needless reminder to her who had everything cut\r\nand dried in that sense long before! \"I long to hear,\" wrote Mr.\r\nHerbert, \"what results you obtain from the Bison.\" Miss Nightingale\r\npreserved her note of the results written at the time, and it is so\r\ncharacteristic of her humour that I print it very nearly _in extenso_:--\r\n\r\n     [_Nov._ 16.] My \"Pan\" here for three hours. Wrote down--\r\n\r\n   _President_--Mr. Herbert    }\r\n                General Storks } Jury.\r\n                Colonel Lefroy }\r\n\r\n                Dr. A.

Not fair: two soldiers reckon as against\r\n     Civil element. Whenever I represented it (I did not know old \"Pan\"\r\n     was so sharp), he offered to take off Col. Lefroy! So I had to\r\n     knock under.\r\n\r\n     Won't bring back Alexander from Canada. Will have three Army\r\n     Doctors. So, like a sensible General in retreat, I named [Dr.\r\n     Joseph] Brown, Surgeon Major, Grenadier Guards, therefore not\r\n     wedded to Dr. Smith, an old Peninsular and Reformer. Left Lord P.\r\n     his McLachlan, who will do less harm than a better man. He has\r\n     generously struck out Milton.[241] Seeing him in such a \"coming on\r\n     disposition,\" I was so good as to leave him Dr. Smith, the more so\r\n     as I could not help it.\r\n\r\n     Have a tough fight of it: Dr. Balfour as Secretary. Pan amazed at\r\n     my condescension in naming a Military Doctor; so I concealed the\r\n     fact of the man being a dangerous animal and obstinate innovator.\r\n\r\n     Failed in one point. Unfairly. Pan told Sir J. Clark he was to be\r\n     on. Won't have him now. Sir J. Clark has become interested.\r\n     Agreeable to the Queen to have him--just as well to have Her on our\r\n     side....\r\n\r\n     Besides things Ld. P. finds convenient to forget, has really an\r\n     inconveniently bad memory as to names, facts, dates, and numbers.\r\n     Hope I know what discipline is too well, having had the honour of\r\n     holding H.M.'s Commission, to have a better memory than my Chief.\r\n\r\n     Pan has four Army Doctors really, therefore according to his principle\r\n     I have _a right to_ four Civilians.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Instructions_: general and comprehensive, comprising the whole\r\n     Army Medical Department, and the health of the Army, at home and\r\n     abroad.

Smith, equal parts lachrymose and\r\n     threatening, will say, \"I did not understand that we were to\r\n     inquire into this.\"\r\n\r\n     My master jealous. Does not wish it to be supposed he takes\r\n     suggestions from me, which crime indeed very unjust to impute to\r\n     him.\r\n\r\n     You must drag it through. If not you, no one else.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     (1) Col.

T. accept an agreement, which I shan't).[242]\r\n\r\n     (7) About Statistics, Lord P. said (i.) the strength of these\r\n     regiments averaged only 200, (ii.) denied the mortality, (iii.)\r\n     said that statistics prove anything.--And I, a soldier, must not\r\n     know better than my Chief.\r\n\r\n     (8) Lord P. contradicted everything--so that I retain the most\r\n     sanguine expectations of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [241] Mr. Milton had been sent out to Scutari by the War Office to\r\n        assist the Purveyor-in-Chief, and Miss Nightingale considered that\r\n        he had dealt only in official \"whitewash.\"\r\n\r\n  [242] On this subject, see below, p. 338.\r\n\r\nA good three hours' work! But many months were to elapse before Lord\r\nPanmure's promise to appoint a Commission was fulfilled. It will be\r\nconvenient, however, to anticipate the course of events in one respect,\r\nand to finish here the story of the _personnel_ of the Commission. Lord\r\nPanmure at once wrote to Mr. Herbert, asking him to accept the\r\nChairmanship: \"I wrote to Panmure,\" he sent word to Miss Nightingale\r\nfrom Wilton (Nov. 25), \"as agreed between us, as _suaviter_ as I could\r\nas to the _modo_, but _in re_ trying to name the Commission and define\r\nthe Instructions. I hope I shall hear to-morrow from him, and I will let\r\nyou know how the land lies the moment I get any sign from him. Supposing\r\nthat he yields, it will be a task of great labour and difficulty, but\r\none well worth undertaking with a fair prospect of attaining an immense\r\ngood, even if we do not get all we want. If he stands out, we must hold\r\nanother Council for which I will run up.\" The text of Mr. Herbert's\r\nletter to Lord Panmure has been printed elsewhere.[243] On the matter of\r\n_personnel_, he suggested General Storks and Colonel Lefroy; two army\r\ndoctors, one of whom he insisted should be Dr. Alexander; two civil\r\ndoctors, one of whom should be Sir James Clark; a sanitary authority,\r\nDr. Sutherland; and, lastly, a good examining lawyer. The Commission,\r\nas ultimately appointed, consisted of Mr. Herbert (_Chairman_), Mr.\r\nAugustus Stafford, M.P., General Storks, Dr. A. Smith, Dr. T. Alexander,\r\nSir T. Phillips, Sir J. Ranald Martin, Sir James Clark, and Dr. J.\r\nSutherland, with Dr. Graham Balfour as Secretary. If the reader will\r\ncompare the ten names resulting from Miss Nightingale's bargaining with\r\nLord Panmure, it will be seen that there were four changes. She lost one\r\nfriend, Colonel Lefroy, but gained another, Mr. Stafford. She gained Dr.\r\nAlexander in place of Dr. McLachlan, and Sir James Clark in place of Dr.\r\nBrown. Dr. Farr was struck off in favour of Mr. Herbert's \"good\r\nexamining lawyer,\" Sir T. Phillips. He was the one dark horse; and,\r\nbefore the Commission sat, Miss Nightingale was asked to meet him. \"We\r\npropose an irregular _mess_,\" wrote Mrs. Herbert to her (May 12, '57),\r\n\"as Sidney thinks Sir T. Phillips wants cramming.\" There was on the\r\nCommission only one upholder of the old régime, Dr. Andrew Smith.\r\n\r\n  [243] _Stanmore_, vol. ii. pp. 119-122.\r\n\r\nHad the facts recited in this chapter been known at the time, Miss\r\nNightingale's opponents might have found some warrant for a suggestion\r\nthat she had packed the Commission. But she and Mr. Herbert packed it\r\nonly in the public interest. In discussions about women's rights it is\r\nsometimes said that women need no other opportunities for influence than\r\nsuch as have always been within their reach. Miss Nightingale, who was\r\nin favour of Female Suffrage, would hardly have gained more influence by\r\nthe possession of a vote. But then very few women, and not many men,\r\nhave the opportunities, the industry, the mental grasp, and the strength\r\nof will which in combination were the secret of \"the Nightingale power.\"\r\n\r\nLord Panmure delayed his formal reply to Mr. Herbert's letter of\r\nconditions, but sent a short note meanwhile of a friendly character. Mr.\r\nHerbert at once forwarded it to Miss Nightingale (Nov. 30, '56), and\r\nsaid: \"I hope the note augurs well.... All I can promise is to do my\r\nbest, and to postpone all other business to this one object till it is\r\nachieved. I shall require great assistance from and thro' you. I shall\r\nlike to see all that you are writing as it goes on, if you see no\r\nobjection. It would probably tell me much, and lead me to question, and\r\nso learn more.\" Thus, then, three months after her return from the\r\nCrimean War, broken in bodily health, was this indomitable woman thrown\r\ninto the maelstrom of work which will be described in the next chapter.\r\nBut it was work for the salvation of the British Army. She \"stood at the\r\naltar of the murdered men\"; and she shrank from no self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                              SOWING THE SEED\r\n\r\n                           (Nov. 1856-Aug. 1857)\r\n\r\n\r\n     You have sown the seed, and the harvest will come. God will give\r\n     the increase.--SIR JOHN MCNEILL (_Letter to Florence Nightingale_,\r\n     on her \"Notes affecting the Health of the British Army\").\r\n\r\nThe power of passive resistance wielded by a Department, and the\r\nreluctance or the inability of an easy-going Minister to withstand it,\r\nare unintelligible to those who are not themselves part of an\r\nadministrative machine, and they are exasperating to those who are\r\npossessed of an impetuous temper and a resolute will. The Royal\r\nCommission on the health of the Army had been settled \"in principle\"\r\nbetween Lord Panmure and Miss Nightingale at their interview on Nov. 16,\r\n1856, and a week later the Minister had received Mr. Herbert's\r\nconditional acceptance of the chairmanship. It was not till May 5, 1857,\r\nthat the Royal Warrant actually setting up the Commission was issued.\r\nThroughout the six months of delay, Mr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale\r\nwere busily employed in endeavours to persuade or coerce the Secretary\r\nof State into granting the Commission effective powers; the War Office\r\nand the Army Medical Department were as busily counter-working in the\r\nhope of so restricting its scope that any recommendations it might make\r\nwould be of a \"harmless\" character.[244] There is no reason, I think, to\r\nsuspect Lord Panmure of insincerity, but he was not the man to force the\r\npace.\r\n\r\n  [244] See _Stanmore_, vol. ii. p. 124.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were moments during the months of delay when Miss Nightingale's\r\npatience was exhausted, and there was one moment when her spirit for\r\nthe fight quailed and she thought of taking service in a civil hospital.\r\nLord Panmure from time to time was afflicted by the gout--\"in the\r\nhands,\" Mr. Herbert said to Miss Nightingale, \"and this explains his not\r\nwriting.\" \"His gout is always _handy_,\" she retorted. Then there was the\r\ncall of the birds to be shot and the stags to be stalked. \"But the Bison\r\nhimself is bullyable, remember that.\" This was the word which she\r\nconstantly passed round among her allies. At one time she pressed Mr.\r\nHerbert to issue an ultimatum. Let him renounce the chairmanship\r\nforthwith, unless Lord Panmure put an end peremptorily to the delays and\r\ngave a pledge that the recommendations of the Commission should be acted\r\nupon. Mr. Herbert and her other friends were for a more cautious policy,\r\nand she was overborne. \"If you can get us out of the old, miry rut,\"\r\nwrote Sir John McNeill (Dec. 19, 1856), \"and put us fairly on the rail,\r\nthough the plant may be defective and the speed small, we shall go on\r\nimproving. Do not allow yourself to be discouraged by delays.\" She was\r\nnot in the end discouraged, but she was not the woman to sit still under\r\nthe delays. She remembered her own _mot d'ordre_; and if she did not\r\n\"bully the Bison,\" I imagine that she sometimes administered a feline\r\nstroke or two. In December Lord Panmure asked leave to come to her quiet\r\nroom in Burlington Street for a talk. And the talk was quiet, too, I\r\ndoubt not, for Miss Nightingale, sometimes biting in private letters,\r\nwas never vehement in conversation. But she could be quietly emphatic.\r\nShe was fully conscious of the strength of a weapon which she held in\r\nreserve. That weapon was her popularity, and the command, which she\r\ncould use, if she chose, of the ear of the press and the public. Lord\r\nPanmure must have been conscious of this factor in the case also. It had\r\nbeen settled at Balmoral, again \"in principle,\" that Miss Nightingale\r\nwas to prepare a Report embodying the results of her experience and\r\nthought. If she and the Minister remained on good terms, if she felt\r\nassured that the Army in medical and sanitary matters would be reformed\r\nfrom within, her Report would remain confidential. But if she were not\r\nso persuaded, there was nothing to prevent her from heading a popular\r\nagitation for reform from without. This was her weapon for \"bullying\r\nthe Bison.\" In a note of self-communing, written during some moment of\r\ndisappointment, she reproaches herself with having been \"a bad mother\"\r\nto the heroic dead, but pledges herself to continue the fight to the\r\nend. She had \"begun at the highest, my Sovereign,\" and had proceeded to\r\nwork through the politicians. If all else failed, she would make a last\r\nappeal, \"like Cobden with the Corn Law,\" to the country. \"Three months\r\nfrom this day,\" she wrote in one of her letters of incitement to Mr.\r\nHerbert, \"I publish my experience of the Crimean Campaign, and my\r\nsuggestions for improvement, unless there has been a fair and tangible\r\npledge by that time for reform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's exasperation was increased by the attitude of the\r\nGovernment towards the report of the \"Chelsea Board.\" The\r\nMcNeill-Tulloch _affaire_, which filled a large space in public\r\nattention at the time, requires only a brief notice here; the dramatic\r\naspect of the now forgotten scene at Chelsea is admirably presented by\r\nKinglake who, however, is not to be accepted as an unbiased authority on\r\nthe merits of the dispute.[245] Sir John McNeill and Colonel Tulloch, it\r\nwill be remembered,[246] had been sent out to the East in 1855 to\r\ninquire into the transport and commissariat arrangements of the\r\ncampaign. Their Report, issued in January 1856, was the one official\r\ndocument among the pile produced by the Crimean War which brought\r\nresponsibility directly home to specified individuals. Every one\r\nremembers the story of Lord Melbourne's protest when he had accidentally\r\nheard a rousing evangelical sermon with a direct \"application\": \"Things\r\nhave come to a pretty pass,\" he said, \"when religion is allowed to\r\ninvade the sphere of private life.\" Something of the same indignant\r\nremonstrance was rife when a Report on the Crimean muddle presumed to\r\ninvade the sphere of personal responsibility. The impugned officers\r\nraised an outcry, and the Government appointed an examining Board of\r\nother officers to report on the Report which had reported them. This\r\nBoard--called after the \"Chelsea\" Hospital where it sat--removed all\r\nblame from individuals, and found in July 1856 that the true cause of\r\nthe Crimean muddle was the failure of the Treasury to send out, at the\r\nproper moment, a particular consignment of pressed hay. Miss Nightingale\r\nhad many a gibe at this ridiculous mouse; and, many years later, Sir\r\nJohn McNeill rebuked \"the levity\" which referred \"the fatal privations\r\nso heroically endured by the troops to so ludicrously inadequate a\r\ncause.\"[247] Some months were next occupied in the drafting, by the\r\nTreasury officials, of an explanation of the regrettable incident of the\r\nhay. The Government acquiesced, and the affair seemed to be over. And so\r\nit would have been, but for two factors--the press and public opinion.\r\nThe _Times_ led a spirited attack upon the Chelsea Board, and public\r\nopinion espoused the cause of Sir John McNeill and Colonel Tulloch.\r\nTheir Report had been set aside, and Lord Panmure had omitted even to\r\nthank them for their labours. Sir John remained contemptuously silent,\r\nbut Colonel Tulloch, who was of a warmer temper, was vigorous in\r\nself-defence and rejoinder. In several large towns sympathy was\r\nexpressed with the slighted Commissioners--a movement which Miss\r\nNightingale and her family, through friends in various places, did\r\nsomething to advance. Complimentary addresses were sent to the\r\nCommissioners from the Mayor and Citizens of Bath, of Birmingham, of\r\nLiverpool, of Manchester and of Preston, as also from the Company of\r\nMerchants of the City of Edinburgh.[248] Noting this movement of public\r\nopinion, which was beginning to be reflected in the House of Commons,\r\nLord Panmure bethought himself of doing something. His expedient was\r\nsignally ill-judged. He had \"the honour to acquaint\" the Commissioners\r\n\"that Her Majesty's Government have decided to mark the services\r\nrendered by you in the discharge of your duties in the Crimea, by\r\ntendering to each of you the sum of £1000.\" This pecuniary estimate of\r\ntheir services was promptly refused by each of them. \"To accept it,\"\r\nwrote Mrs. Tulloch, \"is almost the only thing I could not pardon in my\r\nhusband, but, thank God, he feels as I do on the subject.\" Miss\r\nNightingale was equally indignant, but her political instinct was not at\r\nfault. \"I am _glad_,\" she wrote in reply to Mrs. Tulloch (Feb. 20),\r\n\"that they have been such _fools_! I am sure the British Lion will\r\nsympathise in this insult, and if it does not, then it is a degraded\r\nbeast.\" She proceeded to rouse the beast. She told Mr. Herbert about the\r\nGovernment's offer, and he concurred in her view. It was decided to\r\nraise the whole subject in the House of Commons. On March 12, 1857, Mr.\r\nHerbert moved a Humble Address to the Crown praying that Her Majesty\r\nmight be pleased to confer some signal mark of favour upon Sir John\r\nMcNeill and Colonel Tulloch. The Prime Minister, noting the course of\r\nthe debate, accepted the motion, which was agreed to without a division.\r\n\"Victory!\" wrote Miss Nightingale in her diary; \"Milnes came in to tell\r\nus.\" She thought she had lost in her round with Lord Panmure about\r\nColonel Tulloch (above, p. 331); but she won after all. He was created\r\nK.C.B., and Sir John, who was already G.C.B., was sworn of the Privy\r\nCouncil. This episode, which in its initial stages exasperated Miss\r\nNightingale so much that she was half inclined to throw up the fight,\r\nended by giving her fresh spirit and encouragement. Her _mot d'ordre_\r\nhad come true: the \"Bison\" had proved bullyable--by parliamentary\r\npressure. \"I direct my letter,\" she wrote to the now Right Honourable\r\nSir John McNeill (May 12), \"with a great deal of pleasure. I consider\r\nthat you and Sir Alexander Tulloch have been borne on the arms of the\r\npeople--a much higher triumph than a mere gift of honours by the Crown.\r\nThe poor Crown has been worsted. I am sorry for it. But it was not our\r\nfault.\"[249]\r\n\r\n  [245] In chap. ix. of vol. vi. Kinglake accepts the finding of the\r\n        Chelsea, Board as the last word on the dispute. For the other\r\n        side, see Sir Alexander Tulloch's _Crimean Commission and the\r\n        Chelsea Board_, 2nd ed., with preface by Sir John McNeill (1880).\r\n\r\n  [246] See above, p. 257.\r\n\r\n  [247] Preface to Tulloch's _Crimean Commission_, etc., 1880, p. xiii.\r\n\r\n  [248] For these addresses, see a pamphlet printed at Edinburgh in 1857,\r\n        entitled _Addresses Presented to Sir John McNeill, G.C.B., and\r\n        Colonel Tulloch, with their Answers_.\r\n\r\n  [249] Twenty years later another reparation was made. Sir Theodore\r\n        Martin, in his _Life of the Prince Consort_, had taken an\r\n        unfavourable view of the McNeill-Tulloch report. In the fifth\r\n        edition he revised the passage. \"It is almost more than we could\r\n        have hoped,\" wrote Lady Tulloch, in telling Miss Nightingale of the\r\n        revision; \"I say _we_, knowing how much interest you took in the\r\n        matter.\" \"I give you joy,\" replied Miss Nightingale (Feb. 23,\r\n        1878); \"I give you both joy, for this crowning recognition of one\r\n        of the noblest labours ever, done on earth. You yourself cannot\r\n        cling to it more than I do: hardly so much in one sense, for I saw\r\n        how Sir John McNeill and Sir A. Tulloch's reporting was the\r\n        salvation of the Army in the Crimea. Without them everything that\r\n        happened would have been considered 'all right.' ... I look back\r\n        upon those twenty years as if they were yesterday, but also as if\r\n        they were a thousand years. Success be with us and the noble dead.\"\r\n        A copy of this letter was sent to Sir John McNeill, who replied\r\n        (March 25): \"It was kind of you to copy it for me. There is no one,\r\n        dead or alive, whose testimony I could value so highly with regard\r\n        to the matters in question as I do Miss Florence Nightingale's. Her\r\n        favourable opinion is very precious to me, not only because she\r\n        knew more, and was intellectually more capable of forming a correct\r\n        judgment than any one else who visited that strange scene, but\r\n        because my regard and affection for her is such as would make it\r\n        very painful to me to find that she had reason to think in any\r\n        degree less favourably of our services than she did formerly. Her\r\n        letter is very characteristic, and therefore to me very precious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nIt was her friend Mr. Milnes who had suggested that Miss Nightingale\r\nshould go a little outside her \"Cabinet\" and increase her influence by\r\nextending the range of her parliamentary acquaintances. \"Before the\r\nEstimates come on,\" he had written (Feb. 1857), \"you should surely have\r\nsome people in the House who know what you want.\" And again: \"You should\r\nknow Lord Stanley; he is the best man you could get in the House in\r\nwhatever you wish to be done. Come and dine with him here on Sunday.\"\r\nMr. Milnes was right about Lord Stanley.[250] His public appreciation of\r\nMiss Nightingale has been mentioned already. He was not enthusiastic\r\nabout many persons or things, but Miss Nightingale and her work were\r\namong the number. On now making her personal acquaintance, he sat, as it\r\nwere, at her feet; he told her that he lived in hopes of being allowed\r\nto receive \"future instructions\" from her; he sent her early copies of\r\npapers and bills likely to interest her, and asked questions in the\r\nHouse of Commons which she suggested. When presently he became a\r\nSecretary for State they were to be associated in important work.\r\n\r\n  [250] Better known to the world as the 15th Earl of Derby; Secretary of\r\n        State for India (1858-9); Foreign Secretary (1867-8); Foreign\r\n        Secretary under Disraeli (1874-8); Colonial Secretary under\r\n        Gladstone (1882-5).\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, for all her impetuosity of spirit, had plenty of tact,\r\nand knew how to adjust the means to her several ends. In the spring of\r\n1857, an expeditionary force was being dispatched to China, and she was\r\nvery anxious that the health of her \"children,\" the British troops,\r\nshould be better cared for than it was, at sea or on land, in the\r\nCrimean Campaign. Her ally, Sir James Clark, was on friendly terms with\r\nher opponent, Dr. Andrew Smith. So she used her ally to coax her enemy.\r\n\"I had a very satisfactory conversation with Dr. Smith,\" reported Sir\r\nJames. \"I find he has attended to almost everything I suggested--the\r\nventilation of the ships, the diet of the troops; and they are to have\r\nfresh meat and vegetables during the whole voyage and while on the\r\nstation when it is possible. Nothing seems to be forgotten or neglected\r\non Smith's part, and the Duke of Cambridge backed our recommendations.\r\nSo that the disasters of the Crimea are already telling for the benefit\r\nof the soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fight over the Netley Hospital, Miss Nightingale was defeated by\r\nLord Panmure on the main issue; but she had some success in minor\r\nmatters; and, though on the main issue she lost in the particular case,\r\nshe won the day for the future. She was a pioneer in this country in\r\nadvocating the \"pavilion\" system of hospital construction, which she had\r\nstudied in France. Well-known examples of it are the Herbert Hospital at\r\nWoolwich, and St. Thomas's at Westminster. The plans for the Netley\r\nHospital, which Lord Panmure sent her, were laid on the old \"corridor\"\r\nlines, and she instantly condemned the plans on that and other grounds.\r\nInto this cause, as into everything that she took up, she flung herself\r\nwith full energy. She consulted all the best authorities, she collected\r\ninformation at home and abroad, she drew up memoranda, she prepared\r\nalternative plans. Lord Panmure did not dispute that her alternative\r\nmight, in the abstract, be better, but pleaded that in this case the\r\ncost of alteration, now that the foundations were already laid, would be\r\ntoo great. Besides, there were susceptibilities--his own and other\r\npeople's--to be considered. Miss Nightingale thereupon appealed to the\r\nPrime Minister. \"If Miss Nightingale's suggestions are good,\" he wrote\r\nto Lord Panmure (Nov. 30, 1856), \"it will be worth while to alter our\r\nintended arrangement of the building rather than have an imperfect\r\nHospital.\"[251] Determining to press her advantage, Miss Nightingale\r\nwent down to Embley in the Christmas vacation, and dined and slept at\r\nBroadlands. How great was the impression she made upon Lord Palmerston\r\nis shown by the peremptory letter which he next addressed to Lord\r\nPanmure (Jan. 17). It has been printed _in extenso_ elsewhere[252]; and\r\na sentence or two will here suffice. \"I am bound to say she has left on\r\nmy mind at present a conviction that the plan is fundamentally wrong,\r\nand that it would be better to pull down and rebuild all that has been\r\nbuilt. She brought hither the ground-plan and elevation of the proposed\r\nNetley Hospital, and the ground-plan of the last new Military Hospital\r\nat Paris, which she says has been adopted as the model for the Hospital\r\nat Aldershot.\" (The reader will note, I doubt not, Miss Nightingale's\r\ndiplomatic touch; she only asked Lord Panmure to do at Netley what he\r\nhimself was doing at Aldershot.) \"It seems to me,\" continued Lord\r\nPalmerston most characteristically, \"that at Netley all consideration of\r\nwhat would best tend to the comfort and recovery of the patients has\r\nbeen sacrificed to the vanity of the architect, whose sole object has\r\nbeen to make a building which should cut a dash when looked at from the\r\nSouthampton River.... Pray, therefore, for the present, stop all further\r\nprogress in the work till the matter can be duly considered.\" But even\r\nthe most peremptory of Prime Ministers are not all-powerful. Lord\r\nPanmure immediately replied that the step ordered by his Chief \"would\r\ninvolve us in great difficulties, as it would entail a rupture of all\r\nour extensive contracts, not to mention the reflections which it must\r\ncast on all concerned in the planning of those designs on which we have\r\nworked.... Many of Miss Nightingale's suggestions in the Report signed\r\nby herself and Dr. Sutherland can be carried out by alterations, but the\r\ntotal abandonment of the plan will be a most serious affair.\"[253] It\r\nappears from Miss Nightingale's papers that the War Office's estimate of\r\nthe cost was £70,000; and these 70,000 reasons, combined with the\r\nargument from _amour propre_, caused Lord Panmure to win. Though ever\r\nreluctant to acknowledge defeat till she had fired her last shot, Miss\r\nNightingale knew when she was finally beaten on one ground and she then\r\nmade a stand on another. Foiled in her attempt to improve the Hospital\r\nroot and branch, she used in good part the opportunities which Lord\r\nPanmure gave her of patching up \"the patient,\" as she called it, so far\r\nas was still possible. The corridor was thrown more open; more\r\nwindow-space was given to the wards; borrowed lights and odd corners\r\nwere abolished; the appurtenances were separated; and the ventilation\r\nwas improved.[254] With regard to the future, Miss Nightingale in her\r\nprivate Report, and in almost identical words the Royal Commission in\r\nits public Report, recommended \"that all plans for the original\r\nconstruction of Hospitals be submitted to competent sanitary authorities\r\nbefore such plans are finally approved,\" and \"that all new Hospitals be\r\nconstructed in separate pavilions, in order to prevent a large number of\r\nsick from being agglomerated under one roof.\" This recommendation was\r\nstoutly opposed by medical officers of the old school. \"Poor Andrew\r\nSmith,\" wrote Mr. Herbert during a sitting of the Royal Commission,\r\n\"swallowed some bitter pills to-day, including Pavilions.\" The bitter\r\npill, administered by Miss Nightingale, is now the recognized\r\nprescription in the building of Hospitals.\r\n\r\n  [251] _Panmure Papers_, vol. ii. p. 321.\r\n\r\n  [252] _Ibid_. vol. ii. pp. 332-4.\r\n\r\n  [253] _Ibid_. vol. ii. p. 338.\r\n\r\n  [254] _Panmure Papers_, vol. ii. pp. 401, 405.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nThis fight for the pavilion was only an incident in Miss Nightingale's\r\nwork during the latter part of 1856 and earlier part of 1857. Her main\r\nwork was preparation for the Royal Commission. This involved heavy\r\ncorrespondence, many travels, and close application. Until August 1857,\r\nshe resided principally in London, at the Burlington Hotel; but in the\r\nspring she had spent some weeks, within easy distance of London, at\r\nCombe Hurst, the home of her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Smith;\r\nand in April, a fortnight in Edinburgh, in order to confer with Sir John\r\nMcNeill. She prepared for the Royal Commission by writing her own\r\nReport. The suggestion had been made at Balmoral in October 1856; but\r\nLord Panmure, who seldom did to-day what could be put off till\r\nto-morrow, did not write his official instructions until February 1857.\r\nIn asking her \"further assistance and advice,\" he said: \"Your personal\r\nexperience and observation, during the late War, must have furnished you\r\nwith much important information relating not only to the medical care\r\nand treatment of the sick and wounded, but also to the sanatory\r\nrequirements of the Army generally.\" She had, it will be observed,\r\ncarried her point, that the Report was to be of general scope. \"I now\r\nhave the honour to ask you,\" continued the letter, \"to favour me with\r\nthe results of that experience, on matters of so much importance to Her\r\nMajesty's Army. I need hardly add that, should you do so, they will meet\r\nwith the most attentive consideration, and that I shall endeavour to\r\nfurther, so far as it lies in my power, the large and generous views\r\nwhich you entertain on this important subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report which Miss Nightingale wrote in response to this\r\nrequest--entitled _Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency, and Hospital\r\nAdministration of the British Army_--is, I suppose, the least known, but\r\nit is the most remarkable, of her works. It is little known because it\r\nwas never published. As in the end she extracted a Royal Commission from\r\nLord Panmure, and as the Commission was followed by practical measures,\r\nshe did not feel the necessity of appealing to the public. The War\r\nOffice itself did not print her Report, and thus it never became\r\ngenerally known how much of the Report of the subsequent Royal\r\nCommission, and how many of the administrative reforms consequent upon\r\nit, were in fact the work of Miss Nightingale. But at her own expense\r\nshe printed the _Notes_ for private circulation among influential\r\npeople, and upon all who read it the work created, as well it might, a\r\nprofound impression. Kinglake describes it as \"a treasury of authentic\r\nstatement and wise disquisition, affording a complete elucidation of the\r\ncauses which had brought about failure, whilst also showing the means by\r\nwhich, in the wars of the future, our country might best hope to compass\r\nthe truly sacred task of providing for the health of its troops.\"[255]\r\nSir John McNeill, who read the proofs of the _Notes_ as they passed\r\nthrough the press, was impressed equally with the vigour of the style\r\nand the cogency of the reasoning. \"Be assured,\" he wrote, \"that the\r\nReport will detract nothing from your reputation but, on the contrary,\r\nthat it will greatly add to it, and make it very plain why you have been\r\nplaced where you stand in the estimation of the country. No other person\r\ncould have written it.\" Of another batch of the proofs, he said: \"It\r\nflows on so naturally, it gives so clearly the impression of being the\r\ngenuine expression of earnest conviction, it has so much the character\r\nof good, sincere enlightened conversation on a subject which is\r\nthoroughly understood and appreciated, and so little the appearance of\r\nhaving been 'got up' or of pretension of any kind, literary or artistic,\r\nthat you ought to be very cautious how you alter it in any respect that\r\nwould at all detract from the unambitious and perfectly natural, but, at\r\nthe same time, clear and vigorous, enunciation of important truths and\r\nwise propositions.\" And again: \"It does not signify much what Lord\r\nPanmure thinks or proposes or objects to. You have set up a Landmark\r\nwhich neither he nor any other man or body of men can remove. Permanent\r\nprogress has been made, though but small, and your ideas and plans will\r\nbe pirated and claimed as their own by men who now disparage them.\" When\r\nthe book was finally printed, and a copy of the volume sent to him, Sir\r\nJohn McNeill thought the same. \"A few days ago,\" he wrote (Nov. 18,\r\n1858), \"I read a passage to one of the most admired essayists of our\r\ntime[256] without telling him what I was reading from. When I had done\r\nhe said, 'That is perfect, whose is that?' I bade him guess. He said,\r\n'There are not many men in England who could have done it. I think I\r\nknow them all, but I cannot quite bring it home with confidence to any\r\nof them. It may be some new writer.' I said it was, and then I told him\r\nwho it was. So much for the manner of the thing, which you care little\r\nabout. But for the matter: after a very careful study of the whole, I am\r\nfully satisfied that it is a mine of facts and inferences which will\r\nfurnish materials for every scheme that is likely to be built up on\r\nthat ground for several generations. No man or woman can henceforth\r\npretend to deal with the subject without mastering these volumes and, if\r\nhonest, without referring to them.... Regarded as a whole, I think it\r\ncontains a body of information and instruction, such as no one else so\r\nfar as I know has ever brought to bear upon any similar subject. I\r\nregard it as a gift to the Army, and to the country altogether\r\npriceless.\"\r\n\r\n  [255] Vol. vi. p. 367.\r\n\r\n  [256] Perhaps Abraham Hayward; see his opinion of Miss Nightingale's\r\n        writing, quoted below, p. 408. The passage read out by Sir\r\n        J. McNeill may have been that cited above, p. 242; or perhaps\r\n        that cited on p. 317.\r\n\r\nThese estimates, given respectively by the literary historian of the\r\nCrimean War and by the man of affairs who had probed most deeply into\r\nthe Crimean muddle, will be confirmed, I am confident, by any competent\r\nreader of Miss Nightingale's _Notes_.[257] The wide range of the book,\r\nand its mastery of detail on a great variety of subjects, are as\r\nremarkable as its firm and consistent grasp of general principles. The\r\nkey-note is struck in the Preface. The question of Army Hospitals is\r\nshown to be part of wider questions involving the health and efficiency\r\nof the Army at large. Defects, similar to those which occasioned so high\r\na rate of mortality among the sick in Hospital during the war, were the\r\ncause why so many healthy men came into Hospital at all. Those who fell\r\nbefore Sebastopol by disease were above seven times the number of those\r\nwho fell by the enemy. A large number fell from preventable causes; but\r\nthe causes could only be prevented in the future by the adoption of new\r\nsystems. The bad health of the British Army in peace was shown to be\r\nhardly less appalling than was the mortality during the Crimean War. The\r\nonly way to prevent a recurrence of such disasters was to improve the\r\nsanitary conditions of the soldier's life during peace, and during peace\r\nto organize and maintain General Hospitals in practical efficiency. The\r\nnecessity of reorganization, and the application of sanitary science to\r\nthe Army generally, are the two principles of which Miss Nightingale\r\nnever loses sight in any of the branches of her subject. There is an\r\nIntroductory Chapter giving the history of the health of the British\r\narmies in previous campaigns, and the book then contains twenty\r\nsections. The first six of these deal under different heads with the\r\nmedical history of the Crimean War. Then come three sections dealing\r\nwith the organization of Regimental and General Hospitals. The remainder\r\nof the book takes wider scope, discussing, in succession, the Need of\r\nSanitary Officials in connection with the Army; the Necessity of a\r\nStatistical Department; the Education, Employment and Promotion of\r\nMedical Officers; Soldiers' Pay and Stoppages; the Dieting and Cooking\r\nof the Army; the Commissariat; Washing and Canteens; Soldiers' Wives;\r\nthe Construction of Army Hospitals; and the Mortality of Armies in Peace\r\nand War. A twentieth section gives, after the manner of Royal\r\nCommissions, a summary of Defects and Suggestions. There are also\r\nvarious Appendices, Supplementary Notes, Diagrams and Illustrations. The\r\nfirst volume of the book consists of 830 octavo pages, some numbered in\r\nRoman numerals. The pages thus numbered were an after-thought. The main\r\nbody of the book was ready for press in August 1857, but it was not\r\ndesirable that the Nightingale Report should forestall, even in private\r\ncirculation, the publication of the Royal Commission's Report. A final\r\nappendix to the latter Report contained a mass of official\r\ncorrespondence on the care of the sick and wounded during the Crimean\r\nWar. Miss Nightingale pounced upon this, and prefixed to several of her\r\nsections a classified abstract of the principal documents. \"A masterly\r\nanalysis,\" wrote Sir John McNeill, when she sent him the proofs; \"it is\r\nconclusive, because it is quite fair, and nothing could be more fatal to\r\nfalse pretension.\" Sometimes Miss Nightingale could not deny herself an\r\nironical comment[258]; but the mere collocation of facts and utterances,\r\nas she arranged them, in deadly parallel, is more effective even than\r\nher sarcasm.\r\n\r\n  [257] This opinion is supported by an estimate of the _Notes_ in a paper\r\n        which came into my hands as this book was going to press. \"This\r\n        work (the _Notes_) constitutes in my opinion one of the most\r\n        valuable contributions ever made to hospital organization and\r\n        administration in time of war. Had the conclusions which she\r\n        reached been heeded in the Civil War in America or in the Boer War\r\n        in South Africa, or in the Spanish-American War, hundreds of\r\n        thousands of lives might have been saved\" (_Hurd_, as cited in\r\n        Bibliography B, No. 47, p. 76).\r\n\r\n  [258] See the passage quoted above, p. 288.\r\n\r\nLord Panmure's instructions to Miss Nightingale of February 1857 were\r\nafterwards supplemented by a request that she would submit a\r\nConfidential Report on \"The Introduction of Female Nursing into Military\r\nHospitals in Peace and in War.\" The request had an amusing sequel. \"You\r\ndirected me last week,\" she wrote to Lord Panmure (May 3), \"to make\r\nsuggestions to yourself as to the organization of Female Nursing in Army\r\nHospitals. The Director-General, Army Medical Department, directed, last\r\nweek, the expulsion of all female nurses but two from the Woolwich\r\nArtillery Hospitals.... I have a little pencil composition, to be\r\n'dedicated, with permission, to your Lordship,' exhibiting the order\r\nemanating from the Secretary of State to introduce nurses, and a\r\nsimultaneous order from the Army Medical Board to turn them out. I\r\nenclose a memorandum (merely tentative and experimental) as to the\r\nduties of nurses. I cannot expect the Secretary of State to enter into\r\nthe details. Perhaps I may ask to hear his decision as to the ultimate\r\nsteps to be taken.\"[259] The tentative memorandum was afterwards\r\nexpanded into a treatise, forming the second volume (pp. 184) of the\r\n_Notes_. Its title--_Subsidiary Notes as to the Introduction of Female\r\nNursing into Military Hospitals in Peace and War_--hardly describes the\r\nscope of the volume, which is, in fact almost a treatise on Nursing at\r\nlarge. \"I read the _Subsidiary Notes_ first,\" wrote Mrs. Gaskell (Dec.\r\n31, 1858). \"It was so interesting I could not leave it. I finished it at\r\none long morning sitting--hardly stirring between breakfast and dinner.\r\nI cannot tell you how much I like it, and for such numbers of reasons.\r\nFirst, because you know of a varnish which is as good or better than\r\nblack-lead for grates[260] (only I wonder what it is). Next because of\r\nthe little sentences of real deep wisdom which from their depth and true\r\nfoundation may be real helps in every direction and to every person; and\r\nfor the quiet continual devout references to God which make the book a\r\nholy one.\"\r\n\r\n  [259] _Panmure_, vol. ii. p. 381, where, in following pages, the\r\n        Memorandum is also printed.\r\n\r\n  [260] \"Even black-lead is unnecessary, as a varnish now obtainable looks\r\n        better,\" _Subsidiary Notes_, p. 22.\r\n\r\nAs the work of a single hand, and that the hand of a woman in delicate\r\nhealth, the writing of Miss Nightingale's _Notes on the British Army_,\r\nin the space of six months, is an astonishing _tour de force_. Only the\r\nmost intense application, assisted by great power of brain and will,\r\ncould have accomplished it. She had no staff of secretaries. Mr. Arthur\r\nHugh Clough, then employed in the Education Office, gave her some help,\r\nout of office hours, with the proofs; and her faithful Aunt Mai did some\r\ncopying and correspondence. But for the most part everything was written\r\nin her own hand, and not for one moment did she allow herself any\r\nrelaxation. Nor were the _Notes_ the only work of the same months. She\r\nprepared also (with some assistance from Mr. Bracebridge), and issued,\r\nin 1857, the masterly _Statement to Subscribers_ which has been quoted\r\nfrequently in the foregoing Part of this Memoir. \"Why do you do all\r\nthis,\" wrote Mr. Herbert (Jan. 16), \"with your own hands? I wish you\r\ncould be turned into a cross-country squire like me for a few weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nOne peculiar advantage Miss Nightingale enjoyed in the preparation of\r\nher _Notes_, which, however, added as greatly to her labour as to their\r\neffectiveness and authority. Experts of many kinds were willing and\r\neager to help her. There were in all branches of the public service\r\nbroad-minded men who knew alike the needs and the difficulties of\r\nreform, and who recognized in her an invaluable ally. Just as in the\r\nEast, reformers in difficulty \"went to Miss Nightingale,\" so now\r\nofficials and officers--some openly, others with careful\r\nsecrecy--approached her with hints and offers of assistance, or\r\nsometimes with petition that she would come and help them. Thus Sir John\r\nLiddell, Director-General of the Navy Medical Department, hearing what\r\nwas on foot, begged her \"to take up the sailors,\" and to \"introduce\r\nfemale nurses into naval hospitals.\" She inspected Haslar Hospital at\r\nhis request (Jan. 1857), and he consulted her on the plans for a Naval\r\nHospital at Woolwich. \"I return with many thanks,\" he wrote (Feb. 17),\r\n\"your very clever Report on the Construction of Hospitals [a section of\r\nher _Notes_], from which I mean to profit largely in both our new and\r\nold buildings; but as you have only allowed me the privilege of reading\r\nyour Report privately, I trust that when you see your notions carried\r\nout in our Hospitals you will not reproach me with being a plagiarist\r\nwithout conscience.\" Sir John in return supplied her with facts which\r\nshe needed about naval stores, dietaries, and statistics. He also\r\nescorted her on a visit of inspection to Chatham, a military, as well as\r\na naval, station. She was received on all sides with the utmost\r\nconsideration, and a Military Medical Officer gave her free access to\r\neverything. Dr. Andrew Smith was exceeding wrath when he learnt that she\r\nhad been prying into his domain there. The Medical Officer wrote to her\r\nexplaining that he had misunderstood the case, imagining that her visit\r\nhad official sanction on the military, as well as on the naval side, and\r\nbegging her, in fear and trembling, to treat everything he had said and\r\nshown as strictly secret. The main object of her inspection of Barracks\r\nand Hospitals was to collect data for her Report, but sometimes she was\r\nable to effect a stroke of reform by the way and at once. She was\r\ninvited to inspect Chelsea Military Hospital by Dr. McLachlan, the\r\nPrincipal Medical Officer. She went, marked many defects, and wrote to\r\nhim on the subject. He concurred in what she said, explained that\r\n\"reform moves slowly in old establishments, obstruction coming from\r\nsources least expected,\" and hoped that she might be able to exercise \"a\r\nlittle pressure from without.\" The chairman of the Board was Mr. Robert\r\nLowe, at that time Vice-President of the Board of Trade and\r\nPaymaster-General. She sought an introduction to Mr. Lowe, who \"had much\r\npleasure in calling upon her.\" The sequel is told in a letter from Dr.\r\nMcLachlan: \"If you have not already been made acquainted with it, I am\r\nsure you will be glad to learn that all the really important points\r\nmentioned in your letter to me some time ago have been conceded. Mr.\r\nLowe's perseverance carried the Treasury. The men are to have flannel\r\nvests and drawers, knives, forks, spoons, plates, &c., &c.\" And Mr. Lowe\r\nhimself, who could be soft sometimes, wrote to her with regard to \"the\r\nimprovements which you were good enough to suggest,\" that he was \"happy\r\nto believe that the flannel is a very great comfort to the poor old\r\nmen.\" Many Crimean veterans were afterwards Chelsea pensioners, and I\r\nhave given some of their recollections of Miss Nightingale in an earlier\r\nchapter. They probably did not know that they owed their hospital\r\ncomforts at home to the same woman's touch that had tended them at\r\nScutari or in the Crimea. Miss Nightingale, during these months,\r\ninspected also the leading Civil Hospitals in London. Many of them had\r\nappointed her an Honorary Life Governor in recognition of her services\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\nMilitary officers also tendered their assistance. \"Ask questions,\" says\r\na letter from Wellington Barracks addressed to a friend of Miss\r\nNightingale, \"until you arrive at what you want. It is a pleasure to\r\nassist that excellent lady in her noble work\": \"I was quite charmed,\"\r\nwrote an officer from Aldershot, \"with the opportunity of again\r\ncommunicating with Miss Nightingale. She is the most single-minded and\r\nbenevolent person I ever met, and is truly the wonder of her sex. Do,\r\npray, convey to her my desire to place my humble services and experience\r\nat her disposal whenever and however she may desire.\" Within the War\r\nOffice itself, she had influential friends. Sir Henry Storks was in\r\nfrequent correspondence with her, and sent for her criticism drafts of\r\nnew Regulations. Colonel Lefroy had, in accordance with her\r\nsuggestion,[261] been instructed by Lord Panmure to draft a Scheme for a\r\nSchool of Military Medicine and Surgery. Miss Nightingale's notes on\r\nthis Draft (Nov. 1856) include suggestions which might have come from\r\nsome Royal Commission of our own day. She urges that the Board of\r\nExaminers should consist of the teachers. She suggests that the teachers\r\nin hospitals should not be doctors of eminence; \"a man with an eminent\r\npractice rarely becomes an eminent teacher; many good men may be found\r\nto take the position of teachers at a moderate salary.\" She forestalled\r\nthe idea of Imperial inter-change, of which the War Office of to-day\r\nsays much. \"A most important part of this School,\" she writes, would be\r\nto afford opportunities for study and comparison to Medical Officers\r\nfrom the Colonies. Like Dr. McLachlan at Chelsea, Colonel Lefroy at the\r\nWar Office sometimes \"came to Miss Nightingale.\" He told her of a\r\ncertain military hospital which was very much overcrowded. The Principal\r\nMedical Officer had represented the case to Headquarters and demanded\r\nextra accommodation, but in vain: \"a letter from Miss Nightingale might\r\nlead to better things.\" Colonel Lefroy was helpful in another matter.\r\nMiss Nightingale was a pioneer, as we have heard during the account of\r\nher work in the East, in devising means for encouraging the better\r\nemployment of the private soldier's leisure, and for promoting his\r\nintelligent recreation. And this effort, commenced by her among the\r\nsoldiers on service during the Crimean War, was continued upon her\r\nreturn to England. To the initiative and generosity of Florence\r\nNightingale, the establishment of soldiers' reading-rooms is due. Her\r\nfriend, Mr. Sabin, who had been the principal chaplain at Scutari, was\r\nnow stationed at Aldershot, and Miss Nightingale concerted measures with\r\nhim for continuing there the experiment which they had made in the\r\nEast.[262] After much negotiation, permission was obtained from the\r\nmilitary authorities to use one of the canteens as a reading-room, and\r\non June 17, 1857, \"Divisional Reading-Room, H Canteen, Aldershot Camp\"\r\nwas opened. The funds were provided by Miss Nightingale. The experiment\r\nwas so much appreciated by the soldiers that she determined to enlarge\r\nit. She invoked the good offices of Colonel Lefroy, who wrote to her on\r\nAugust 19 as follows: \"A propitious moment offered itself yesterday, and\r\nI asked the Chief whether I was at liberty to accept the offer of 'a\r\nprivate person' to contribute to the amusement of the Soldiers, and the\r\nimprovement of their Reading-rooms. He laughed, having probably a shrewd\r\nsuspicion of the identity of the unknown, and gave leave. I am now\r\ntherefore quite at your service.... There will be no difficulty in\r\nfinding means of applying any funds you will supply, and I have but one\r\nregret in the matter, viz. that a duty so essential to the moral\r\nimprovement of the soldier should be left to private benevolence. I\r\nshould like to print Milton's IXth Sonnet[263] on everything you give\r\nus.\" Miss Nightingale herself had no taste for publicity or praise. She\r\nloved to do good by stealth, and most of her influence was exerted\r\nbehind the scenes.\r\n\r\n  [261] See above, p. 330.\r\n\r\n  [262] See above, p. 281.\r\n\r\n  [263] _To a Virtuous Young Lady_:--\r\n\r\n            Lady, that in the prime of earliest youth\r\n              Wisely hast shunned the broad way and the green,\r\n              And with those few art eminently seen\r\n              That labour up the hill of heavenly Truth,\r\n            The better part with Mary and with Ruth\r\n              Chosen thou hast, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nStatisticians, sanitary engineers, architects, and other experts were\r\nall in correspondence or personal communication with Miss Nightingale\r\nduring the preparation of her Report. Dr. William Farr, the first\r\nauthority on the former subject, was at work with her in January and\r\nFebruary 1857 upon comparisons of the mortality in the army and in civil\r\nlife. \"It will always give me the greatest pleasure,\" he wrote, \"to\r\nrender you any assistance I can in promoting the health of the Army. We\r\nshall ask your assistance in return in the attempts that are now being\r\nmade to improve the health of the civil population. It is in the House\r\nand the Home that sound principles will work most salutarily.\" Later\r\nchapters will show how readily Miss Nightingale lent assistance in that\r\nfield. When she had finished the statistical section of her Report, she\r\nsent the proofs with her illustrative diagrams for Dr. Farr's revision.\r\nHe found nothing to alter. \"This _speech_,\" he wrote, \"is the best that\r\never was written on Diagrams or on the Army. I can only express my\r\nOpinion briefly in 'Demosthenes himself with the facts before him could\r\nnot have written or thundered better.' The details appear to me to be\r\nquite correct.\" He specially commended her diagrams for the clearness\r\nwith which they explained themselves. She was something of a pioneer in\r\nthe graphic method of statistical presentation. In every branch of her\r\ninquiry she was equally thorough; consulting the best authorities,\r\ncollecting the essential facts. She was in communication with Sir Robert\r\nRawlinson and Sir Edwin Chadwick, and with Sir John Jebb, the architect\r\nof model prisons. She collected plans of all the best hospitals and\r\ninfirmaries in Great Britain and on the Continent. She consulted\r\nProfessor Christison on dietetics, and procured dietaries from foreign\r\nhospitals. She corresponded with Army Surgeons whom she had met in the\r\nEast, and with Army chaplains and missionaries. The feeling which\r\nfellow-workers had for Miss Nightingale appears characteristically in a\r\nnote from Sir Robert Rawlinson to her aunt (1858). \"To have earned the\r\ngood word of Miss N. is most gratifying. I trust I may deserve a\r\ncontinuance of it. I learn with sorrow that her health is so doubtful,\r\nbut I have a full and abiding faith in the providence of God. She has\r\nsown seed that will give a full harvest, and mankind will be better for\r\nher practical labours to the end of time. Hospitals will be constructed\r\naccording to her wise arrangements, and they will be managed in\r\nconformity with her humane rules. One man in the army will be more\r\nuseful than two formerly, and reason will preside over comfort and\r\nhealth. So far as my weak means extend I will strive to work in the same\r\nfield, and do that which in me lies to embody the lessons I have\r\nreceived.\" \"It is very pretty,\" wrote her sister to Madame Mohl (May 2,\r\n'57), \"to see these wise old men so profoundly convinced of her\r\nknowledge as well as of her disinterestedness, and looking up at her\r\nwith such a mixture of reverence and tenderness, of desire that she\r\nshould not overwork herself, and of desire that she should do the work\r\nwhich she alone can do so well.\" \"You cannot think what it is,\" wrote\r\nher sister to another friend, \"to watch a great mind like hers fully at\r\nwork and fully equal to that great work. To see each emergency as it\r\narises met and conquered, to see in her great plans for reform and\r\nimprovement, how even each hindrance only seems to give a fresh impetus\r\nof power to overcome (if my heart was not in each move of the game it\r\nwould be like watching a gigantic game of chess, whereof the pawns were\r\nmen and the result the lives of thousands); how she collects the honey\r\nout of each man's information and binds it up into the whole that is to\r\ncarry on the work.\" Miss Nightingale's _Notes_ were her own work in a\r\npeculiar degree and, as Sir John McNeill said, no one else could have\r\ndone it. But it is also true that the book collects from many quarters\r\nthe best that was known and thought at the time on the subjects with\r\nwhich it deals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's own Report was more than half finished when the\r\nlong-promised and long-delayed Royal Commission on the same subject was\r\nappointed. The importunity of Mr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale had at\r\nlast \"brought the Bison to bay.\" On April 26 she received the welcome\r\nintimation that Lord Panmure would call at the Burlington Hotel on the\r\nfollowing day with the Official Draft of the Instructions for the\r\nCommission. She suggested a few alterations, and these were accepted,\r\nand the documents were sent for the Royal approval. Miss Nightingale\r\nkept a copy of the manuscript, and sent it to her friend, Dr. Graham\r\nBalfour, the secretary of the Commission. \"Every one of the members of\r\nthe Commission,\" she explained to him (April 27), \"was carried by force\r\nof will against Dr. Andrew Smith, and poor Pan has been the\r\nshuttlecock\"; and with regard to the Instructions, \"You will see curious\r\ntraces of the struggle to exclude and to include all reform in the\r\nprogress of the MS. I think I am not without merit for labouring at\r\nbullying Pan--a petty kind of warfare, very unpleasant.\"\r\n\r\nIt throws an interesting side-light on the relation of Ministers to\r\ntheir subordinates to know, as appears from Miss Nightingale's papers,\r\nthat Lord Panmure was careful to have the documents initialled by the\r\nQueen before submitting them to Dr. Smith. To those who have delved into\r\nthe history of the Crimean muddle, few things are more curious at first\r\nsight than the long ascendancy of Dr. Smith. Perhaps no one was to\r\nblame, but only the system; but if any individuals were to blame for the\r\nmedical defects, then surely the Medical Director-General must have been\r\none. Lord Grey sent to Miss Nightingale a very long and elaborate\r\nMemorandum on her _Notes_. He admired the skill with which she\r\nmarshalled the facts; but maintained that the true conclusion to be\r\ndrawn from them was not that radical reform was needed, but that several\r\npersons (including Dr. Smith) should have been court-martialled. I doubt\r\nif Miss Nightingale differed from the latter proposition. But in fact\r\nDr. Smith was decorated, and when the war was over he was allowed for\r\nmany months to obstruct the course of reform. The explanation, however,\r\nis simple. The permanent head of a Department is a master of its detail,\r\nand if he be a man of any ability, this fact often gives him an\r\nascendancy over his political chief. If the Minister be indolent, or\r\nincapable of detail, or for any other reason disposed to the line of\r\nleast resistance, he becomes as clay in the hands of his permanent\r\nsubordinate, whenever a matter comes down from generals to particulars.\r\nSo Lord Panmure, at the final stage of this affair, took the precaution\r\nof barring out details. Dr. Smith, who was a pertinacious man, had, I\r\ndare say, many criticisms to offer when the Instructions for the\r\nCommission were shown to him. But, if so, Lord Panmure had a general and\r\na conclusive answer. What the Queen had signed must not be altered.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Warrant, instructing the Commission, was in very wide and\r\ncomprehensive terms, and Mr. Herbert and his colleagues set to work\r\nwithout a day's delay. Six months had elapsed between his acceptance of\r\nthe Chairmanship and the issue of the Royal Warrant. The Report of the\r\nCommission was prepared in precisely three months. To appreciate fully\r\nthe industry which such a result involved, one must have looked into the\r\nmountainous mass of detail which the Commission accumulated and sifted.\r\nNo praise can be too high for the unremitting attention, the incessant\r\nhard work which Mr. Herbert, as Chairman, threw into the task. But even\r\nso, such speed in the preparation of the Commission's Report would have\r\nbeen impossible, but that much of the ground had been already explored,\r\nand most of it exhaustively covered, by Miss Nightingale. In all Royal\r\nCommissions, as also in more august bodies, there is an Inner Cabinet,\r\nand sometimes an Innermost Cabinet as well. In the present case there\r\nwas an Innermost Cabinet of three, and one of the three was not a member\r\nof the Commission--Mr. Herbert, Dr. Sutherland, and Miss Nightingale.\r\nThere was no man so closely associated with Miss Nightingale's work for\r\nso many years, and in so many different directions, as Dr. John\r\nSutherland. He was recognized as one of the leading sanitarians of the\r\nday. He had been an Inspector under the first Board of Health (1848),\r\nand had been employed by the Government in many special inquiries. As\r\nhead of the Sanitary Commission sent to the Crimea in 1855, he had, as\r\nalready stated, made Miss Nightingale's acquaintance, and from that time\r\nforth they were close colleagues. He served on almost every Commission,\r\nSub-Commission, and Committee with which she had anything to do. If he\r\nwas not nominated in the first list, she always insisted on his\r\ninclusion. He sometimes exasperated her, as we shall hear in later\r\nchapters, but they worked together in constant comradeship. He was, as\r\nit were, her Chief-of-the-Staff; and also in large measure her Private\r\nSecretary for official matters. Upon Dr. Sutherland and Miss Nightingale\r\nthe Chairman of the Royal Commission mainly relied. I have already\r\nquoted Mr. Herbert's general tribute to her assistance (p. 312). It is\r\nfully borne out by the evidence contained in her papers.\r\n\r\nThroughout the proceedings of the Commission, Miss Nightingale was in\r\ndaily communication--personal, or by letter--with Mr. Herbert or Dr.\r\nSutherland, or with both. I have before me, of this date, fifty letters\r\nfrom each of them to her. She was an unremitting task-master. \"My dear\r\nLady,\" wrote Dr. Sutherland one Friday (May 22), \"do not be\r\nunreasonable. I fear your sex is much given to being so. I would have\r\nbeen with you yesterday, had I been able, but alas! my will was stronger\r\nthan my legs. I have been at the Commission to-day, and as yet there is\r\nnothing to fear. I was too much fatigued and too stupid to see you\r\nafterwards, but I intend coming to-morrow about 12 o'clock, and we can\r\nthen prepare for the campaign of the coming week. There won't be much to\r\ndo, as the Commission is going to the Derby, except your humble servant\r\nand Alexander, who, for the sake of example, are going to see Portsmouth\r\nand Haslar to give evidence on both. We shall meet on Monday and Friday\r\nonly. The Sanitary arguing goes on on both these days, and I hope\r\nto-morrow to be able to perform the coaching operation you desiderate,\r\nand as you don't go to church you can coach Mr. Herbert on Sunday. I\r\nhave now sent you a Roland for your Oliver, and am ever yours\r\nfaithfully.\" Of the letters from Mr. Herbert, written after the\r\nCommission was appointed, the first defines the position: \"We must meet\r\nand agree our course.\" A few other brief extracts will fill in the\r\nsketch. \"I am getting up the examinations; does anything occur to you?\"\r\n\"I send you Hall's correspondence. You know the matters treated with all\r\nthe dates which I do not, and will see in them what I should not.\" He\r\nconsults her about the order in which to call the witnesses, \"or we\r\nshall seem to be always examining one another.\" He asks her to look\r\ninto a comparison of the mortality among marines and sailors\r\nrespectively. She secured on another subject some damning documents. \"I\r\nreturn your stolen goods,\" he writes. \"Pray keep them carefully. If ever\r\nwe have to besiege the Army Medical Department, no Lancaster gun could\r\nbe more formidable than this document; it is really almost\r\nunbelievable.\" \"I should very much like to have a Cabinet Council with\r\nyou to-day. Shall I come to you at 5 o'c., or would you come here?\" And\r\nso forth, and so forth, almost daily. But I can perhaps best convey an\r\nidea of the co-operation in terms of legal procedure. Miss Nightingale\r\nwas the solicitor who gave instructions in the case to Mr. Herbert. As\r\neach branch of the inquiry came up, she sent him a memorandum upon it;\r\noften, no doubt, a copy of her own Report on the same subject. She\r\nsuggested the witnesses, and often saw them before they gave their\r\nevidence, in order, as it were, to take their proof. In the case of some\r\nimportant witnesses, she prepared the briefs for cross-examination, as\r\nwell as examination. In June, Sir John Hall, whom the reader will\r\nremember as Principal Medical Officer in the Crimea, was to be in the\r\nbox. \"I have been asked,\" she wrote to Sir John McNeill (June 12), \"to\r\nrequest you to give us some hints as to his examination, founded upon\r\nwhat you saw of him when in your hands. My own belief is that Hall is a\r\nmuch cleverer fellow than they take him for, almost as clever as\r\nAirey,[264] and that he will consult his reputation in like manner, and\r\nperhaps give us very useful evidence, no thanks to him.... I would only\r\nrecall to your memory the long series of proofs of his incredible\r\napathy, beginning with the fatal letter approving of Scutari, Oct.\r\n'54,[265] continuing with all the negative errors of non-obtaining of\r\nLime Juice, Fresh Bread, Quinine, etc., up to his _not_ denouncing the\r\neffects of salt meat before you.... We do not want to badger the old man\r\nin his examination, which would do us no good and him harm. But we want\r\nto make the best out of him for our case. Please help us. I understand\r\nthat Dr. Smith says he was much afraid of 'the Commission' at first, and\r\n'thought it would do harm.' But now 'thinks it is taking a good turn.'\r\nIs this for us or against us?\" Sir John McNeill thought \"for us,\" and\r\nadvised that Dr. Hall should \"not be put too much on the defensive,\" but\r\nshould be led in examination \"to slip quietly into the current of reform\r\nas Dr. A. Smith seems from what you say to have done.\" Still, if he\r\nproved obdurate he must of course \"be put in a corner\"; and so Sir John\r\nMcNeill assisted the lady-solicitor to prepare posers for a possibly\r\nrefractory witness. It was difficult, however, to be refractory with Mr.\r\nHerbert. \"He was a man of the quickest and most accurate perception,\"\r\nshe wrote of him in later years, \"that I have ever known. Also he was\r\nthe most sympathetic. His very manner engaged the most sulky and the\r\nmost recalcitrant of witnesses. He never made an enemy or a quarrel in\r\nthe Commission. He used to say, 'There takes two to be a quarrel, and I\r\nwon't be one.'\" Then, again, Miss Nightingale was always at Mr.\r\nHerbert's call to supply details, missing dates, and references. Every\r\none familiar with the courts knows how even the ablest counsel will\r\nsometimes stumble over a date or fumble among his papers for a\r\nparticular document, till a junior behind him or the solicitor in front\r\nof him comes to his rescue. That was another rôle played by Miss\r\nNightingale, though behind the scenes. \"Sidney is again in despair for\r\nyou,\" wrote Mrs. Herbert; \"can you come? You will say, _Bless_ that man,\r\nwhy can't he leave me in peace? But I am only obeying orders in begging\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n  [264] Richard, Lord Airey, Quartermaster-General to Crimean Army,\r\n        1854-5, one of the officers vindicated by the Chelsea Board;\r\n        Quarter-master-General, 1855-65.\r\n\r\n  [265] Dr. Hall had reported to Dr. Smith from Scutari (Oct. 20, 1854),\r\n        with \"much satisfaction,\" that \"the whole Hospital establishment\r\n        has now been put on a very creditable footing,\" etc. See _Notes_,\r\n        p. 52.\r\n\r\nA difficulty arose upon the question whether Miss Nightingale should or\r\nshould not give evidence herself. She was averse from doing so, and Sir\r\nJohn McNeill strongly supported her. In his paternal way he did not like\r\nthe idea of her exposing herself to such a strain, and indeed her\r\nphysical weakness at the time was great. In the present day she would of\r\ncourse, in like circumstances, have been made a member of the Royal\r\nCommission. In those days the idea of calling a woman as a witness\r\ncaused some qualms. Her own objection was founded rather on regard for\r\nMr. Herbert's susceptibilities. She could not tell the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth without going into the past, and such\r\nevidence might seem to cast reflections on the conduct of her friend as\r\nMinister during the earlier part of the war. Mr. Herbert, however,\r\nbrushed this point aside, and urged her to come and tell the whole\r\ntruth. Her friend Mr. Stafford was yet more emphatic. \"Let me entreat\r\nyou,\" he wrote (June 11), \"to reconsider your determination. You have\r\ndone so much, you ought to do all. This is our last effort for the\r\nsoldier. No one can aid us so well as you, and you can aid us so well in\r\nno other manner; even if your opinions should offend some few\r\nindividuals, the fault is theirs, not yours. The absence of your name\r\nfrom our list of witnesses will diminish the weight of our Report, and\r\nwill give rise to unfounded rumours; it will be said either that we were\r\nafraid of your evidence, and did not invite you to tender it, or that\r\nyou made suggestions, the responsibility of which you were reluctant to\r\nincur in public.\" There was obvious force in Mr. Stafford's arguments,\r\nand it was decided that Miss Nightingale should give evidence in the\r\nform of written answers to written questions. Her evidence, which\r\noccupies thirty-three pages of the Blue-book, is in effect a condensed\r\nsummary of her confidential Report. None of the evidence given to the\r\nCommission was more direct and cogent. \"It may surprise many persons,\"\r\nwrote an army doctor at the time, \"to find, from Miss Nightingale's\r\nevidence that, added to feminine graces, she possesses, not only the\r\ngift of acute perception, but that, on all the points submitted to her,\r\nshe reasons with a strong, acute, most logical, and, if we may say so,\r\nmasculine intellect, that may well shame some of the other witnesses.\r\nThey maunder through their subjects as if they had by no means made up\r\ntheir minds on any one point--they would and they would not; and they\r\nseem almost to think that two parallel roads may sometimes be made to\r\nmeet, by dint of courtesy and good feeling, amiable motives that should\r\nnever be trusted to in matters of duty. When you have to encounter\r\nuncouth, hydra-headed monsters of officialism and ineptitude, straight\r\nhitting is the best mode of attack. Miss Nightingale shows that she not\r\nonly knows her subject, but feels it thoroughly. There is, in all that\r\nshe says, a clearness, a logical coherence, a pungency and abruptness, a\r\nring as of true metal, that is altogether admirable.\"[266] \"I have\r\nperused with the greatest interest,\" wrote a member of the Commission\r\n(Sir J. R. Martin) to her, \"your most conclusive evidence now in\r\ncirculation for the perusal of the Commissioners. It contains an\r\nassemblage of facts and circumstances which, taken throughout their\r\nentire extent, must prove of the most vital importance to the British\r\nsoldier for ages to come.\"\r\n\r\n  [266] _The Army in its Medico-Sanitary Relations_, p. 26. Edinburgh,\r\n        1859. Reprinted from the _Edinburgh Medical Journal_. The writer\r\n        was Dr. Combe, R.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VII\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Commission was written by Mr. Herbert in August 1857,\r\nwith much assistance from Miss Nightingale. \"A thousand thanks,\" he\r\nwrote to her (Aug. 5). \"The list of recommendations and defects is very\r\nclear and good. I have noted one or two additions.\" A comparison of the\r\nRecommendations at the end of Miss Nightingale's Report with those at\r\nthe end of the Royal Commission's Report shows how closely the latter\r\ndocument followed the earlier. The Report was not issued to the public\r\nuntil January 1858. The reason for the delay is intimately connected\r\nwith the story of Miss Nightingale's life during the latter half of\r\n1857. The salient feature of the Report was its adoption and\r\nconfirmation of the appalling figures which she had first tabulated many\r\nmonths before. \"It is of infinite importance to the success of all you\r\nhave still to accomplish,\" wrote Sir John McNeill (Nov. 9) when she sent\r\nhim a proof of Mr. Herbert's Report, \"that the accuracy of your\r\nstatements as to the condition of the Barracks has been established\r\nbeyond question. It deprives interested cavillers of all right to be\r\nlistened to when they desire to question your other propositions.\" It\r\nwas shown conclusively by the Royal Commission that, as Miss Nightingale\r\nhad said, the rate of mortality in the Army at home in time of peace\r\nwas double that of the civil population. A comparison of the civil and\r\nmilitary mortality in certain London parishes was yet more startling. In\r\nSt. Pancras the civil rate was 2·2; the rate in the barracks of the 2nd\r\nLife Guards was 10·4. In Kensington the civil rate was 3·3; the rate in\r\nthe Knightsbridge barracks was 17·5. Every one who knew the contents of\r\nthe Report perceived that this was the point which would cause a\r\nsensation. The Crimean War and its muddles were beginning to fade into\r\nthe past, especially in view of the Indian Mutiny; and reorganization of\r\na department of the Army would never be likely to arrest popular\r\nattention. But the case was different with facts and figures showing\r\nthat the health of the Army, even when at home and in peace, was\r\nshamefully sacrificed by official neglect. There was to be a sitting of\r\nParliament in December, and nasty questions would assuredly be asked\r\nunless something were done. There was a masterful and importunate woman\r\nbehind the scenes who was firmly resolved that something should be done.\r\nWithout a moment's rest, without thought of recess or relaxation, Miss\r\nNightingale flung herself into a new campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                            ENFORCING A REPORT\r\n\r\n                          (August-December 1857)\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Nation is grateful to you for what you did at Scutari, but all\r\n     that it was possible for you to do there was a trifle compared with\r\n     the good you are doing now.--SIR JOHN MCNEILL (_Letter to Florence\r\n     Nightingale_, Dec. 1857).\r\n\r\nReformers, who are familiar with the ways of the political world, more\r\noften sigh than rejoice when they hear that a subject in which they are\r\ninterested has been \"referred to a Royal Commission.\" They know that the\r\nchances are many to one that the subject, like the Report, will be\r\nplaced on a shelf and stay there. Sometimes the reference is a\r\nwell-understood euphemism for such an intention; and even when it is\r\nnot, there are many things which may bring about the same result. The\r\nCommission will perhaps produce a litter of Reports from whose\r\ndiscordant voices no definite conclusion can be drawn. In any case the\r\nReport, or Reports, will have to \"engage the earnest attention\" of His\r\nor Her Majesty's Government, and the attention, earnest or otherwise, is\r\nsure to be prolonged. Before the process has come to an end, many things\r\nmay have happened to overlay the subject in question. Every generation\r\nof reformers sees a certain number of subjects on which its heart has\r\nbeen set deeply interred under a pile of Blue-books.\r\n\r\nThis was the danger with which Mr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale were\r\nconfronted in August 1857 in the case of their Royal Commission on the\r\nsanitary condition of the British Army. Against the risk of an equivocal\r\nReport they had, indeed, guarded themselves in advance; but the danger\r\nof a definite Report leading to no immediate action had still to be met.\r\nMr. Herbert was no less anxious than Miss Nightingale to meet it. He\r\nhad devoted unsparing toil to the Commission; his toil would be reduced\r\nto futility if the Report were merely to be pigeon-holed. They laid\r\ntheir plans on the consideration mentioned at the end of the last\r\nchapter--namely, the effect which the disclosures of the Royal\r\nCommission was likely to have on public opinion. Mr. Herbert\r\ncommunicated the gist of the Report privately to Lord Panmure. It could\r\nbe officially presented and published sooner or later as the\r\nnegotiations with Ministers might go. Mr. Herbert pointed out to Lord\r\nPanmure that the Report was \"likely to arrest a good deal of general\r\nattention\"; that there was time to take measures towards reform before\r\nthe Report became known to the public; that the simultaneous publication\r\nboth of its recommendations and of orders and regulations founded upon\r\nthem would \"give the prestige which promptitude always carries with it.\"\r\nMr. Herbert would gladly give every assistance in his power towards that\r\nend. He put the case with his usual suavity. But there was iron within\r\nthe velvet. The publication of the Report could properly be postponed\r\nfor a while, but not indefinitely. Lord Panmure had to choose between\r\ncommitting himself to instant reform, so as to whitewash the Government\r\nbeforehand, and postponing reform, in which case he would have to reckon\r\nwith a public opinion inflamed by the disclosures of the Report. And\r\nmeanwhile Miss Nightingale still held _her_ Report in reserve, for use\r\nin an appeal to public opinion, should the negotiations fail to secure\r\nany guarantee for prompt reform.\r\n\r\nThe plan of active reform agreed upon between her and Mr. Herbert was\r\nthat four Sub-Commissions should be appointed, with Mr. Herbert himself\r\nas Chairman of each, to settle the details of reform, and in some\r\nmeasure to execute it, in accordance with the general recommendations of\r\nthe Report. These Sub-Commissions were severally (1) To put the Barracks\r\nin sanitary order, (2) To organize a Statistical Department, (3) To\r\ninstitute a Medical School, and (4) To reconstruct the Army Medical\r\nDepartment, to revise the Hospital Regulations, and draw up a Warrant\r\nfor the Promotion of Medical Officers. This last, from its comprehensive\r\nand cleansing scope, was called by Miss Nightingale \"The Wiping\r\nCommission.\" Mr. Herbert sent these proposals to Lord Panmure on August\r\n7,[267] and two days later he wrote to Miss Nightingale: \"Panmure writes\r\nfairly enough, but he has gone to shoot grouse. I have asked Alexander\r\nto meet me at the Burlington on Wednesday at 3, to discuss and settle\r\nthings. So I have disposed of your time and rooms.\" The grouse, however,\r\nwere not quite ready, and on the 14th Mr. Herbert caught Lord Panmure on\r\nthe wing. Mr. Herbert seemed to carry his point, the four\r\nSub-Commissions were agreed to in general terms, and, as he sent word to\r\nMiss Nightingale on the same day, he was \"able to leave for Ireland with\r\na lighter heart after seeing Pan. But I am not easy about you. Here am I\r\ngoing to lead an animal life for a month, get up early, pursue your\r\nanimal, catch him, eat him, and go to sleep. Why can't you, who do men's\r\nwork, take man's exercise in some shape?... This is my parting sermon. I\r\nuse, for the purpose of scolding you, a liberty which nothing gives me\r\nbut my hearty regard and affection for you.\"\r\n\r\n  [267] The letter is printed in _Stanmore_, vol. ii. p. 133.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert had well earned his month's fishing. But as Dr. Sutherland\r\npresently wrote to her, \"one thing is quite clear, that women can do\r\nwhat men would not do, and that women will dare suffering knowingly\r\nwhere men would shrink.\" Miss Nightingale would not, and could not, take\r\nman's rest because she felt her cause too intensely; she could not be of\r\nso light a heart as her friend, because she knew \"her Pan\" a little\r\nbetter than he did. Dr. Andrew Smith, she heard, was putting up a stiff\r\nfight against reform. Lord Panmure stayed on in the Highlands late into\r\nthe autumn, paying only a flying visit or two to London. His\r\nsubordinates were as laborious as ever in piling up objections. He\r\nbecame frightened at his own acts, and at one time revoked (but\r\nafterwards, under pressure, reinstated) the authority he had given for\r\nthe Wiping Sub-Commission. Mr. Herbert returned to England in September,\r\nand came up to London to see Miss Nightingale before the first meeting\r\nof the first Sub-Commission. Many weeks elapsed before all of them were\r\nset on foot. She meanwhile was incessantly at work, and Dr. Sutherland,\r\nwho lived at Highgate, was constantly with her. She wrote reminders to\r\nLord Panmure, \"although I hear you saying, There is that bothering woman\r\nagain,\" and she begged Mr. Herbert to do the like. She drafted\r\ninstructions and schemes for each of the Sub-Commissions. As each of\r\nthem set to work, there were meetings in her rooms to settle the\r\nprocedure. There were periods, as Miss Nightingale afterwards recalled,\r\n\"when Sidney Herbert would meet the Cabal, as he used to call it, which\r\nconsists of 'you and me and Alexander and Sutherland, and sometimes\r\nMartin and Farr,' every day either at Burlington Street, or at Belgrave\r\nSquare, and sometimes as often as twice or even three times a day.\" A\r\nfew extracts from her correspondence will show the extent of her work\r\nand the eagerness of her temper:--\r\n\r\n     _August_ 7 (_Miss Nightingale to Sir J. McNeill_). The\r\n     reconstitution of the Army Medical Department as to its government\r\n     has been carried by the commission almost in the form which you\r\n     recommended. I have been requested by Mr. Herbert, who went out of\r\n     town last night for a few days, to draw up a scheme as to what\r\n     these new men are to do. And I now venture to enclose it to you,\r\n     earnestly begging you to consider it and send it me back with your\r\n     remarks in as short a time as you possibly can. We have carried the\r\n     Barracks Sub-Commission with Panmure, Dr. Sutherland to be the\r\n     Sanitary Head.\r\n\r\n     _Sept._ 29 (_Mr. Herbert to Miss Nightingale_). Pan is still\r\n     shooting. It is to me unconscionable. In future you must defend the\r\n     Bison, for I won't.\r\n\r\n     _Oct._ 10 (_Miss Nightingale to Sir J. McNeill_). I will not say a\r\n     word about India. You know so much more about it than anybody here.\r\n     We have seen terrible things in the last 3 years, but nothing to my\r\n     mind so terrible as Panmure's unmanly and stupid indifference on\r\n     this occasion! I have been three years \"serving in\" the War\r\n     Department. When I began, there was incapacity, but not\r\n     indifference. Now there is incapacity and indifference....\r\n     Panmure's coming up to town last Thursday week was the consequence\r\n     of reiterated remonstrance.... And he is going away again after the\r\n     next Indian mail. That India will have to be occupied by British\r\n     troops for several years, I suppose there is no question. And so\r\n     far from the all-absorbing interest of this Indian subject\r\n     diminishing the necessity of immediately carrying out the reforms\r\n     suggested by our Commission, I am sure you will agree that they are\r\n     now the more vitally important to the very existence of an army. I\r\n     came up to town [from Malvern] on Thursday week and met Mr.\r\n     Herbert for this purpose. Panmure had not done a thing. It was\r\n     extracted from him then and there that the four Sub-Commissions ...\r\n     should be issued _immediately_. The Instructions had been approved\r\n     by P. seven weeks ago. A week, however, has elapsed, and we have\r\n     heard nothing. I shall not, however, leave P. alone till this is\r\n     done. Mr. Herbert's honour is at stake, which gives us a hold upon\r\n     him. Without him, of course, I could do nothing.\r\n\r\n     _Nov._ 9 (_Sir J. McNeill to Miss Nightingale_). We may now reckon\r\n     on something being done to rescue the country from the sin and\r\n     shame of having so culpably neglected our soldiers. I rejoice that\r\n     you are to see the fruits of your labours in their behalf.\r\n\r\n     _Nov._ 15 (_Miss Nightingale to Sir J. McNeill_). Here I come\r\n     again. Panmure has granted the _wiping_ \"Commission\" with such\r\n     ample instructions for \"preparing draft Instructions and\r\n     Regulations,\" defining the duties of etc., etc., and revising the\r\n     \"Queen's Q.M.G's., Barracks', Purveyor's and Hospital Regulations,\"\r\n     as you may guess them to be, when I tell you they were written by\r\n     me.... Mr. Herbert is, besides, to send Panmure a \"Constitution\"\r\n     for the Army Medical Board, and a Warrant for \"Promotion\" himself.\r\n     All that is necessary now is to keep Mr. Herbert up to the point.\r\n     The strength of his character is its simplicity and candour, with\r\n     extreme quickness of perception; its fault is its excessive\r\n     eclecticism. Ten years have I been endeavouring to obtain an\r\n     expression of opinion from him and have never succeeded yet....\r\n     This new Sub-Commission entails upon me a labour I most gladly\r\n     undertake of putting together Draft Regulations to be submitted to\r\n     Mr. Herbert, as suggestions for the Draft he will propose to the\r\n     Sub-Commission. These Regulations must, of course, _rhyme_ with the\r\n     Report. I think you would recommend, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     _Dec._ 1 (_Miss Nightingale to Sir J. McNeill_). This is the first\r\n     rough proof of the Regulations chiefly written by myself, which Mr.\r\n     Herbert will submit to the Regulations Committee on Monday. I send\r\n     them to you with his sanction, begging you to cut them up severely,\r\n     and to send them back as soon as possible. I, in my own name,\r\n     direct your particular attention to criticize the Regulations for\r\n     Nurses. You will of course understand that my name does not appear.\r\n     We are so sorry to give you this trouble, but feel the necessity of\r\n     having your advice.\r\n\r\n     _Dec._ 14 (_Mrs. Herbert to Miss Nightingale_). DEAREST--Sidney\r\n     wishes me to send you these, if you will be so kind as to look over\r\n     them. I know it's wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nA later letter from Sir John McNeill is quoted at the head of this\r\nchapter. He considered that compared with the work which she was doing\r\nnow, what she had done at Scutari was \"a trifle\"--\"mere child's play\"\r\nwas the phrase which she herself used in making the comparison.\r\nPreceding pages will, I think, have inclined the reader to the same\r\nconclusion, or, at any rate, have enabled him to understand what Miss\r\nNightingale and Sir John meant. And this large and difficult work was\r\nbeing done by a woman who had already taxed her physical strength\r\ndangerously in the East, and who was now threatened, in the opinion of\r\ncompetent observers, by a complete breakdown. Of the members of what was\r\ncalled her \"Cabinet,\" Sir John McNeill was the one for whose\r\nintellectual power and judgment she had the highest respect, to Mr.\r\nHerbert she was personally the most attached, but to Dr. Sutherland also\r\nshe sometimes opened her inner thoughts and feelings. He was of a\r\nsomewhat wayward disposition, which alternately pleased and vexed the\r\nbusiness-like Lady-in-Chief, but he was an indispensable helper, whilst\r\nin his wife Miss Nightingale inspired deep affection, and the two women\r\ninterchanged intimate religious experiences. All Miss Nightingale's\r\nfriends, and Dr. Sutherland as a medical man more especially, saw that\r\nshe was over-working. Change of air and seclusion she herself felt\r\ncompelled to seek; and she found them at Malvern, in the establishment\r\nof Dr. Johnson, who had moved thither from Umberslade[268]; but rest\r\nfrom work she would not, and could not, take. She was at Malvern in\r\nAugust and September, and again in December. Her faithful Aunt Mai--her\r\n\"true mother,\" as the niece at this time called her--kept watch over her\r\nalike at Malvern and in London. The society of her own mother and\r\nsister, with their many and lively interests, she found distracting.\r\nWhether at the Burlington or at Malvern, she desired to use every hour\r\nof strength for her work and for nothing else. And when Dr. Sutherland\r\njoined the others in begging her to desist, her heart was heavy within\r\nher. She was sore that her friend should understand her so little. She\r\nsurmised that he had been prompted by her sister. She was morbidly\r\nanxious at this time that no member of the family except Aunt Mai should\r\nknow how ill she was. She had attained her freedom for the life of\r\nindependent work, at a great price, as the first Part of this Memoir has\r\nshown. Perhaps in her present over-wrought condition she was haunted by a\r\ndread lest the galling solicitude of her family might lure her back into\r\nthe cage. Dr. Sutherland had written two letters at the end of August\r\nbegging her to put all work aside. She was thinking of everybody's\r\n\"sanitary improvement,\" he said, except her own. \"Pray leave us all to\r\nourselves, soldiers and all, for a while. We shall all be the better for\r\na rest. Even your 'divine Pan' will be more musical for not being beaten\r\nquite so much. As for Mr. Sidney Herbert, he must be in the seventh\r\nheaven. Please don't gull Dr. Gully, but do eat and drink and don't\r\nthink. We'll make such a precious row when you come back. The day you\r\nleft town it appeared as if all your blood wanted renewing, and that\r\ncannot be done in a week. You must have new blood, or you can't work,\r\nand new blood can't be made out of tea, at least so far as I know. There\r\nis a paper of Dr. Christison's about 28 ounces of solid food per diem.\r\nYou know where _that_ is, and depend on it the Dr. is right.... And now\r\nI have done my duty as confessor, and hope I shall find you an obedient\r\npenitent.\" To this letter she replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Dr. Sutherland._) And what shall I say in\r\n     answer to your letter? Some one said once, He that would save his\r\n     life shall lose it; and what shall it profit a man if he gain the\r\n     whole world and lose his own soul? He meant, I suppose, that \"life\"\r\n     is a means and not an end, and that \"soul,\" or the object of life,\r\n     is the end. Perhaps he was right. Now in what one respect could I\r\n     have done other than I have done? or what exertion have I made that\r\n     I could have left unmade?... Had I \"lost\" the Report, what would\r\n     the health I should have saved have \"profited\" me? or what would\r\n     ten years of life have advantaged me, exchanged for the ten weeks\r\n     this summer? Yes, but, you say, you might have walked or driven or\r\n     eaten meat. Well, since we must come to _sentir della spezieria_,\r\n     let me tell you, O Doctor, that after any walk or drive I sat up\r\n     all night with palpitation. And the sight of animal food increased\r\n     the sickness. The man here put me, as soon as I arrived, on a sofa\r\n     and told me not to move and to take no solid food at all till my\r\n     pulse came down. I remind myself of a little dog, a friend of mine,\r\n     who barked himself out of an apoplectic fit, when the Dog-Doctor\r\n     did something he had always manifested an objection to. Now I have\r\n     written myself into a palpitation. Do you think me one of Byron's\r\n     young ladies? He, it was, I think, who made a small appetite the\r\n     fashion. Or do you think me an Ascetic? Asceticism is the trifling\r\n     of an enthusiast with his power, a puerile coquetting with his\r\n     selfishness or his vanity, in the absence of any sufficiently great\r\n     object to employ the first or overcome the last. Or, since I am\r\n     speaking to an artist and must illustrate and not define, the\r\n     \"Cristo della Moneta\" of Titian at Dresden is an ascetic. The \"Er\r\n     ist vollbracht\" of Albert Dürer at Nuremberg is a Christ--he whom\r\n     we call an example, though little we make of it. For our Church has\r\n     daubed that tender, beautiful image with coarse bloody colours till\r\n     it looks like the sign of a road-side inn. And another has\r\n     mysticized him out of all human reach till he is the God and God is\r\n     the Devil. But are we not really to do as Christ did? And when he\r\n     said the \"Son of Man,\" did he not mean the sons of men? He was no\r\n     ascetic.\r\n\r\n     But shall I tell you what made you write to me? I have no second\r\n     sight, I do not see visions nor dream dreams. It was my sister. Or\r\n     rather I will tell you that I have second sight. I have been\r\n     greatly harassed by seeing my poor owl[269] lately, without her\r\n     head, without her life, without her talons, lying in the cage of\r\n     your canary (like the statue of Rameses II. in the pool at\r\n     Memphis[270]), and the little villain pecking at her. Now, that's\r\n     me. I am lying without my head, without my claws, and you all peck\r\n     at me. It is _de rigueur, d'obligation_, like the saying something\r\n     to one's hat, when one goes into church, to say to me all that has\r\n     been said to me 110 times a day during the last three months. It is\r\n     the _obbligato_ on the violin, and the twelve violins all practise\r\n     it together, like the clocks striking 12 o'clock at night all over\r\n     London, till I say like Xavier de Maistre, _Assez, je le sais, je\r\n     ne le sais que trop_. I am not a penitent; but you are like the\r\n     R.C. Confessor, who says what is _de rigueur_, what is in his\r\n     Formulary to say, and never comes to the life of the thing,--the\r\n     root of the matter.\r\n\r\n     (_Dr. Sutherland to Miss Nightingale._) HIGHGATE, _Sept._ 7.\r\n     What can I say, my dear friend, to your long scold of a\r\n     letter?...You are decidedly wrong in passing yourself off for a\r\n     dead owl, and in thinking that I have joined with other equally\r\n     charitable people in pecking at you. It is _I_ that have got all\r\n     the pecking, altho' I hope that I am neither an owl, nor dead; and\r\n     your little beak is one of the sharpest. But like a good, live\r\n     hero, I bear it all joyfully because it is got in doing my duty to\r\n     you. I want you to live, I want you to work. You want to work and\r\n     die, and that is not at all fair. I admire your heroism and\r\n     self-devotion with all my heart, but alas! I cannot forget that it\r\n     is all within the compass of a weak, perishing body; and am I to\r\n     encourage you to wear yourself in the vain attempt to beat not only\r\n     men, but _time_? You little know what daily anxiety it has cost me\r\n     to see you dying by inches in doing work fit only for the strongest\r\n     constitution....\r\n\r\n  [268] See above, p. 118.\r\n\r\n  [269] For this pet owl, see above, pp. 89, 160.\r\n\r\n  [270] \"In a grassy hollow, by the side of a bright pool of water, lies a\r\n        statue of the great Rameses, the most beautiful sculpture we have\r\n        yet seen. There he lies upon his face, as if he had just laid down\r\n        weary,\" etc. Florence Nightingale's _Letters from Egypt_, 1854,\r\n        p. 258.\r\n\r\nDr. Sutherland urged her to take at any rate a week's complete rest. But\r\nshe would not. Her cause was her life, and she could not for the sake of\r\nlife lose what alone made life worth living. While they were delaying,\r\nthe soldiers were dying. Her work would not wait. She begged him to come\r\ndown to Malvern and work with her in order that they might have\r\neverything ready to put before Mr. Herbert in London by the time he\r\nreturned from his fishing. Dr. Sutherland wrote pretty excuses. Mrs.\r\nSutherland made counter-suggestions. Why should not Miss Nightingale\r\nstay on at Malvern altogether? \"Would not Mr. Herbert,\" she wrote (Sept.\r\n11), \"go to you for a few days, settle all the points, and then\r\ncommunicate daily by letter? You have so much tact that you would be\r\nable to maintain your influence. Do think if this be possible. It is\r\nquite against my own interest to desire it, for if you come to London, I\r\nmay get a glimpse of your dear face.\" But Miss Nightingale persisted,\r\nand Dr. Sutherland surrendered. He went down to Malvern, was himself ill\r\nthere, and Miss Nightingale reported progress of \"the sick baby\" to his\r\nwife. But the two invalids, we may be sure, talked of other things than\r\ntheir ailments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nSo little was Miss Nightingale in a mood to succumb to her physical\r\nweakness, that she had offered to go out to India, where her friend\r\nLady Canning was at the Viceroy's side during the Mutiny. \"Miss\r\nNightingale has written to me,\" wrote Lady Canning to her mother (Nov.\r\n14); \"she is out of health and at Malvern, but says she would come at\r\ntwenty-four hours' notice if I think there is anything for her to do in\r\nher 'line of business.' I think there is not anything here, for there\r\nare few wounded men in want of actual nursing, and there are plenty of\r\nnative servants and assistants who can do the dressings. Only one man,\r\nwho was very ill of dysentery, has died since we went to the hospital a\r\nfortnight ago. The up-country hospitals are too scattered for a nursing\r\nestablishment, and one could hardly yet send women up.\"[271] Miss\r\nNightingale was very serious in the offer, for she had made it twice;\r\nfirst through Mr. Herbert, and then in a personal letter, carried by her\r\ncousin, Major Nicholson, who had been ordered to India at this time. She\r\nthought of herself as a soldier in the ranks; and absorbed intently\r\nthough she was in her work for the Army at home, she would have\r\nconsidered active service in the field a superior call. Had the Viceroy\r\nfelt the need of accepting Miss Nightingale's offer, it is possible that\r\nher power of will and the excitement of activity might have carried her\r\nthrough the ordeal; but she had barely strength for the work on which\r\nshe was already engaged.\r\n\r\n  [271] Augustus Hare's _Story of Two Noble Lives_, vol. ii. p. 350.\r\n\r\nOf her daily life during this period, at Malvern and in London\r\nsuccessively, her sister's letters give a vivid description:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lady Verney to Madame Mohl._) [_September_ 1857.] The accounts of\r\n     F. have been very anxious. Aunt Mai says she does not sleep above\r\n     two hours in the night, and continues most feverish and feeble, and\r\n     cannot eat. She never left that room where you saw her, was\r\n     scarcely off her sofa for a month. Now she goes down for half an\r\n     hour into a parlour, to do business with a Commissioner who has\r\n     been there to see her. Aunt Mai says it throws her back more to put\r\n     off work for \"the cause\" she lives for than to do a little every\r\n     day--so we reconcile ourselves. Tuesday, she says, was a very\r\n     uneasy day, and F. said she felt as she had done when recovering\r\n     from the fever at Balaclava. Still both doctors say there is no\r\n     disease, that it is only entire exhaustion of every organ from\r\n     overwork, and that rest will alone restore her--rest for much\r\n     longer than she will give herself, I fear. She has two \"packs\" a\r\n     day; this is all the water-curing; it seems to bring down the\r\n     pulse, and she lies at that open window the chief part of the day,\r\n     not reading or writing, only just still. She cannot be better\r\n     anywhere, no one can get at her; Aunt Mai is a dragon, and the\r\n     Commissioner is the only person who has seen her. Aunt M. says, \"I\r\n     cannot disguise to myself that she is in a very precarious state.\"\r\n\r\n     (_Lady Verney to M. Mohl._) [_Dec._ 5, 1857.] Aunt Mai's bulletin\r\n     is generally the same: \"Mr. Herbert for 3 hours in the morning, Dr.\r\n     Sutherland for 4 hours in the afternoon, Dr. Balfour, Dr. Farr, Dr.\r\n     Alexander interspersed.\" They are drawing up the new Regulations\r\n     (but this you must not tell. F. is as nervous of being known to\r\n     have anything to do with it as other people are of getting\r\n     honour).... Dr. Sutherland burst out to Aunt Mai the other day that\r\n     F.'s \"clearness and strength of mind, her extraordinary powers, her\r\n     grasp of intellect and benevolence of heart struck him more and\r\n     more as he worked with her--that no one who did not see her proved\r\n     and tried as he did could conceive the extent of both.\" \"The most\r\n     gifted of God's creatures,\" he called her. And the determined way\r\n     in which she will not let any one know what she is about is so\r\n     curious. She will not even tell us; we only hear it from these men.\r\n     She is killing herself with work (which they all say no one else\r\n     can do, no one else has the threads of it, or the perseverance for\r\n     it), and yet no one will ever know it. Others will have all the\r\n     credit of the very things she suggested and introduced, at the cost\r\n     one may say of life and comfort of all kinds, for it is an\r\n     intolerable life she is leading--lying down between whiles to\r\n     enable her just to go on, not seeing her nearest and dearest,\r\n     because, with her breath so hurried, all talking must be spared\r\n     except what is necessary, and all excitement, that she may devote\r\n     every energy to the work.... Aunt Mai says again to-day how Mr.\r\n     Herbert is in sometimes twice a day and Dr. Sutherland the whole\r\n     day (but please don't tell any one), because she alone can give\r\n     facts which no one else hardly possesses, because she knows the\r\n     bearings of the whole which no one else has followed, has both the\r\n     smallest details at her fingers' ends and the great general views\r\n     of the whole--what is to be gained and what avoided.\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Nightingale was lying ill at Malvern, she was being courted\r\nin counterfeit at Manchester. Her parents and sister were visiting\r\nManchester to see the \"Art Treasures Exhibition,\" and the newspapers had\r\nincluded Florence in the party. The sightseers, wrote Lady Verney, took\r\nLady Newport, \"a very sweetlooking woman in black,\" for Florence and\r\n\"treated her like a saint of the Middle Ages. 'Let me touch your shawl\r\nonly,' they said as they crowded round, or 'Let me stroke your arm.'\r\nMrs. Gaskell told me we could have no idea how deep the feeling is for\r\nyou in the hearts of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling would perhaps have been yet deeper if the people had known\r\nthe work which Miss Nightingale was still doing, and the delicate health\r\nfrom which she was suffering. At the end of 1857 she thought that death\r\nmight overtake her in the middle of her work with Sidney Herbert, and\r\nshe wrote this letter to him \"to be sent when I am dead\":--\r\n\r\n     30 OLD BURLINGTON STREET, _November_ 26, 1857. DEAR MR. Herbert--\r\n     (1) I hope you will not regret the manner of my death. I\r\n     know that you will be kind enough to regret the fact of it. You\r\n     have sometimes said that you were sorry you had employed me. I\r\n     assure you that it has kept me alive. I am sorry not to stay alive\r\n     to do the \"Nurses.\" But I can't help it. \"Lord, here I am, send me\"\r\n     has always been religion to me. I must be willing to go now as I\r\n     was to go to the East. You know I always thought it the greatest of\r\n     your kindnesses sending me there. Perhaps He wants a \"Sanitary\r\n     Officer\" now for my Crimeans in some other world where they are\r\n     gone.--(2) I have no fears for the Army now. You have always been\r\n     our \"Cid\"--the true chivalrous sort--which is to be the defender of\r\n     what is weak and ugly and dirty and undefended, rather than of what\r\n     is beautiful and artistic. You are so now more than ever for us.\r\n     \"Us\" means in my language the troops and me.--(3) I hope you will\r\n     have no chivalrous ideas about what is \"due\" to my \"memory.\" The\r\n     only thing that can be \"due\" to me is what is good for the troops.\r\n     I always thought thus while I was alive. And I am not likely to\r\n     think otherwise now that I am dead. Whatever your own judgment has\r\n     accepted from me will come with far greater force from yourself.\r\n     Whatever your own judgment has rejected would come with no force at\r\n     all.--(4) What remains to be done has, however, already been\r\n     sanctioned by your judgment:--(i.) as to Army Medical Council, Army\r\n     Medical School, General Hospital scheme, Gymnastics; (ii.) as to\r\n     what Dr. Sutherland must needs do for the Sanitary branch; (iii.)\r\n     as to Colonial Barracks,--Canadian, Mediterranean, W. and E.\r\n     Indian.--(5) I am very sorry about the Nursing scheme. It seems\r\n     like leaving it in the lurch. Mrs. Shaw Stewart is the only woman I\r\n     know who will do for Superintendent of Army Nurses.--Believe me\r\n     ever, while I can say God bless you, yours gratefully, F. NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nThen she asked her uncle to assist her in making a will. She was anxious\r\nabout the Nightingale Fund, to the management of which she had not as\r\nyet been able to devote attention. She proposed to leave it to St.\r\nThomas's Hospital. The property to which she would ultimately be\r\nentitled upon the death of her father and mother she proposed to apply\r\nto the building of a model Barrack according to her ideas; \"that is,\r\nwith day-rooms for the men, separate places to sleep in (like Jebb's\r\nAsylum at Fulham), lavatories, gymnastic-places, reading-rooms, etc.,\r\nnot forgetting the wives, but having a kind of Model Lodging-House for\r\nthe married men.\" In a letter of instructions to her uncle, she named\r\nSir John McNeill, Mr. Herbert, and Dr. Sutherland as the men who would\r\nbest carry out such a plan. She included a few family bequests; but what\r\nwas nearest to her heart at this time was to leave personal keepsakes to\r\nMrs. Herbert and other friends who had \"worked for her long and\r\nfaithfully.\" For this purpose, in order that there might be no question\r\nabout possession, she begged her sister to send up to London from Embley\r\nvarious goods and chattels which had personal association with herself.\r\nAnd she had one other wish; it related to her \"children.\" \"The\r\nassociations with our men,\" she wrote to her sister (Dec. 11), \"amount\r\nto me to what I never should have expected to feel--a superstition,\r\nwhich makes me wish to be buried in the Crimea, absurd as I know it to\r\nbe. _For they are not there._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                             REAPING THE FRUIT\r\n\r\n                                (1858-1860)\r\n\r\n\r\n                  With aching hands, and bleeding feet\r\n                  We dig and heap, lay stone on stone;\r\n                  We bear the burden and the heat\r\n                  Of the long day, and wish 'twere done.\r\n                  Not till the hours of light return,\r\n                  All we have built do we discern.\r\n                                                MATTHEW ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\"You must now feel,\" wrote Sir John McNeill to Miss Nightingale (May 13,\r\n1858), when her work for the health of the British soldier at home was\r\nbeginning to bear fruit, \"that you have not laboured in vain, that you\r\nhave made your talent ten talents, and that to you more than to any\r\nother man or woman alive, will henceforth be due the welfare and\r\nefficiency of the British Army. Napoleon said that in military affairs\r\nthe moral are to the physical forces as four to one, but you have shown\r\nthat he greatly underrated their value. The rapidity with which you have\r\nobtained unanimous consent to your principles much exceeds my\r\nexpectations. I never dared to doubt that truth and justice and mercy\r\nwould prevail, but I did not hope to live long enough to see their\r\ntriumph when we first communed here of such things.[272] I thank God\r\nthat I have lived to see your success.\" Sir John's thanksgiving was\r\ncaused by the tone and the result of a debate which had taken place in\r\nthe House of Commons upon May 11, 1858. Lord Ebrington, prompted by Mr.\r\nHerbert and Miss Nightingale, had moved a series of Resolutions with\r\nregard to the Health of the Army, founded upon the Report of the Royal\r\nCommission. He had laid special stress upon the figures, due to Miss\r\nNightingale's insight and industry, comparing the mortality in the Army\r\nand in civil life respectively; he called attention to the horrible\r\nstate of the Barracks, and his Resolutions concluded thus: \"That in the\r\nopinion of this House, improvements are imperatively called for not less\r\nby good policy and true economy, than by justice and humanity.\" The\r\nGovernment accepted the Resolutions, and Miss Nightingale's campaign had\r\nthus obtained the unanimous approval of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n  [272] At Edinburgh in the autumn of 1856; see above, pp. 321, 328.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe had worked indefatigably, and through many channels, and she\r\ncontinued so to work, in order to focus and stimulate public opinion in\r\nthe sense of Lord Ebrington's Resolutions. By the end of 1857 the\r\nSub-Commissions on Army Medical Reform were making good progress, and\r\nthe Report of the Royal Commission was about to be published. She\r\ndevised an effective means of forcing its salient feature upon the\r\nattention of every person most concerned in the evils or most\r\ninfluential towards securing the necessary remedies. I have referred\r\nalready (p. 352) to her diagrams illustrative of the mortality in the\r\nBritish Army. As finally prepared with Dr. Farr's assistance, they\r\nshowed most effectively at a glance, by means of shaded or coloured\r\nsquares, circles and wedges, (1) the deaths due to preventable causes in\r\nthe Hospitals during the Crimean War, and (2) the rate of mortality in\r\nthe British Army at home: \"our soldiers enlist,\" as she put it, \"to\r\nDeath in the Barracks.\" She now wrote a memorandum, explaining the\r\ndiagrams and pointing their moral, and had 2000 copies printed. This\r\nanonymous publication--entitled _Mortality of the British Army_--is\r\ncalled in her correspondence _Coxcombs_, primarily from the shape and\r\ncolours of her diagrams. She had proposed, and Mr. Herbert agreed, that\r\nthe memorandum and diagrams should be included as an appendix in his\r\nReport, in order that her pamphlet might appear as \"Reprinted from the\r\nReport of the Royal Commission,\" and thus be given the greater\r\nauthority. So soon as the Report was issued, she distributed her\r\n_Coxcombs_ to the Queen and other members of the Royal Family, to\r\nMinisters, to leading members of both Houses of Parliament, and to\r\nMedical and Commanding Officers throughout the country, in India and in\r\nthe colonies. She had a few copies of the diagrams glazed and framed,\r\nand three of these she sent to the War Office, the Horse Guards, and the\r\nArmy Medical Department. I do not know whether these Departments hung up\r\nthe present. \"It is our flank march upon the enemy,\" she wrote in\r\nsending an early copy to Sir John McNeill, \"and we might give it the old\r\nname of _God's Revenge upon Murder_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Royal Commission appeared at the beginning of February\r\n(1858), and the Secretary sent one of the earliest copies to Miss\r\nNightingale. \"I like him very much,\" she replied (Feb. 5); \"I think he\r\nlooks very handsome. Lady Tulloch says I make my pillow of Blue-books.\r\nIt certainly has been the case with this.\" She did not sleep over it,\r\nhowever. She was immediately up and doing. Among her papers there is a\r\ncurious collection of letters and memoranda, partly in her handwriting,\r\npartly in that of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert, showing how industriously they\r\nset to work to pull wires in the press. The monthly and quarterly\r\nReviews were in those days deemed of great importance in influencing\r\npublic opinion, and Miss Nightingale drew up and sent for Mr. Herbert's\r\ncriticism a list of the principal among them, entering against each\r\nmagazine or review the name of the writer whom she designated as the\r\nideal contributor of an article upon the Report. They had as much\r\ntrouble in adjusting the parts as a theatrical manager finds in settling\r\nhis cast. Lord Stanley, for example, promised to write, but he was\r\nparticular about his place of appearance. It must be the _Westminster\r\nReview_ or nowhere, and Miss Nightingale had already allotted that place\r\nto the principal star, Mr. Herbert himself.[273] And, moreover, the\r\nmanagers in this instance were drawing up a cast for other people's\r\nhouses, and the editors did not in all cases prove amenable. Mr. Elwin,\r\nthe editor of the _Quarterly_, rejected the article submitted to him.\r\nBut Mr. Reeve, of the _Edinburgh_, was an old friend of Miss\r\nNightingale, and he accepted her nominee, though he displeased her by\r\nmangling the article in the Ministerial interest. However, in the\r\ndailies, the monthlies and the quarterlies, the Report had, on the\r\nwhole, \"a good press,\" and, what is no less important for influencing\r\npublic opinion, a prompt press.\r\n\r\n  [273] His article appeared in the _Westminster_ for January 1859, and\r\n        long extracts are given in _Stanmore_, vol. ii. pp. 141-8. Miss\r\n        Nightingale read it in manuscript and contributed much material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThese things had hardly been arranged when there was a political crisis,\r\nand this involved Miss Nightingale and her allies in additional work.\r\nLord Palmerston's Government was defeated on the Conspiracy Bill, and\r\nresigned. Lord Derby came in (Feb. 25), with General Peel as Secretary\r\nfor War. Here, then, we say good-bye, for the present, to \"the Bison.\"\r\nHe had been dilatory to the last. Mr. Herbert had hoped to see the Army\r\nMedical School established in January, and had written to Miss\r\nNightingale to nominate suitable men for the various chairs--\"not,\" he\r\nadded despairingly, \"that Panmure would appoint any one even if the\r\nAngel Gabriel had offered himself, St. Michael and all angels to fill\r\nthe different chairs. He is very slow to move.\" Miss Nightingale took\r\nformal leave of Lord Panmure later in the year, in sending him a copy of\r\none of her books. \"You shock me,\" he replied from the Highlands (Nov.),\r\n\"by telling me I once called you 'a turbulent fellow.' Had any one else\r\nsaid so, I should have denied it, but I must have been vilely rude.\r\nAccept my apology now; and to bribe you to do so, I send you a box of\r\ngrouse.\" Mr. Herbert at first cherished high hopes of Lord Panmure's\r\nsuccessor. Miss Nightingale and Mr. Herbert were particularly anxious\r\nupon a personal point. The Army Medical Department had not yet been\r\nreformed, and it was known that Sir Andrew Smith would shortly retire.\r\nBy seniority Sir John Hall would have claims to the post, and his\r\nappointment would, the allies considered, be disastrous to the cause of\r\nreform; it would be useless, they felt, to frame new regulations without\r\nan infusion of new blood. This, therefore, was the first point on which\r\nrepresentations were made to Lord Panmure's successor. \"I have seen\r\nGeneral Peel,\" wrote Mr. Herbert to Miss Nightingale (Feb. 27), \"and he\r\npromised to make no appointment nor to take any step in regard to the\r\nMedical Department or sanitary measures till he has conferred with me. I\r\nthink Peel may do well if we can put him well in possession of the\r\ncase.\" General Peel duly did what they wanted on this personal issue. \"I\r\nhope we may assume,\" wrote Mr. Herbert to Miss Nightingale (May 25),\r\n\"that Smith is really gone. It is no use trying to realize the enormous\r\nimportance of such a fact.\" They must now, he continued, \"fix the\r\nappointment of Alexander.\" Three days later he wrote to Dr. Sutherland:\r\n\"Please tell Miss N. that I warned Peel against the expected\r\nrecommendation of Sir J. Hall, and he will, I think, be prepared to turn\r\na deaf ear to it. I wrote yesterday to him on another subject and threw\r\nin some praise of Alexander.\" Such is the gentle art of influencing\r\nMinisters. On June 11 Dr. T. Alexander was appointed to succeed Sir\r\nAndrew Smith. Dr. Alexander unhappily died suddenly at the beginning of\r\n1860, but it was a great thing for the Reformers, at a time when the\r\nArmy Medical Department was being recast, to have one of themselves at\r\nthe head of it, instead of a supporter of the _ancien régime_. \"I cannot\r\nsay,\" wrote Mr. Herbert to Miss Nightingale (Sept. 16, 1858), \"how glad\r\nI am to have your account of Alexander. Everything _in futuro_ must\r\ndepend on him. You cannot maintain a commission sitting permanently _in\r\nterrorem_ over the Director-General, and Alexander seems able and\r\nwilling to be his own commission.\" So the allies had done at least one\r\ngood stroke of business with General Peel. Another of the new\r\nministers--Lord Stanley, the Colonial Secretary--was also helpful. \"He\r\nwill send the _Coxcombs_ out to the Colonial Governors,\" wrote Mr.\r\nHerbert (March 16); \"he offered any service his position can enable him\r\nto give to assist our cause, and suggests that a Commission should\r\ninspect Colonial barracks, and he proposes to discuss the matter with\r\nyou.\" Presently, however, Lord Stanley was moved from the Colonial to\r\nthe India Office; where Miss Nightingale enlisted his interest in\r\nanother sanitary campaign, which was thenceforward to fill a large space\r\nin her working life, as will appear in a later Part. So, then, the new\r\nGovernment seemed promising; but it soon began to appear that at the\r\nWar Office the cobwebs were beyond the power of the new broom to sweep\r\naway. Some reforms were carried out, but the permanent officials were as\r\nobstructive under General Peel as under Lord Panmure. \"These War Office\r\nSubs.,\" wrote Mr. Herbert to Miss Nightingale (June 29), \"are\r\nintolerable--half a dozen fellows sitting down to compose Minutes just\r\nfor the fun of the thing on a subject which they cannot possibly know\r\nanything about! Peel ought not to let these Subs. interfere, spoil and\r\ndelay as they do. That office wants a thorough recasting, but I doubt\r\nwhether Peel is the man to do it. He has a clear head and good sense,\r\nbut I think he is over-powered by the amount of work which Panmure by\r\nthe simple process of never attempting to do it found so easy.\"\r\n\r\nBut alike amid hope and care, amid fear and anger, Mr. Herbert and Miss\r\nNightingale worked away at their reforms unceasingly. Throughout the\r\nyear 1858 she was in a very weak state of health. She divided her time,\r\nas before, between Malvern and Old Burlington Street, travelling\r\nbackwards and forwards in an invalid carriage, and escorted by Mr.\r\nClough, now sworn to her service. Her aunt, Mrs. Smith, was still in\r\nfrequent attendance upon her. Her father was with her for a while at\r\nMalvern, and, like every one else, enjoined the desirability of rest.\r\n\"Well, my dear child,\" he wrote afterwards from Lea Hurst (Sept. 25),\r\n\"it's no small matter to see your handwriting again, and to make believe\r\nthat you are a good deal more than half alive. But the worst of it is,\r\nthat there's no depending upon you for any persistence in curing\r\nyourself, while you have so many others to cure. I often wonder how it\r\nis that you who care so little for your own life should have such\r\nwonderful love for the lives of others.\" She seldom saw her mother and\r\nsister. In June 1858 her sister married. \"Thank you very much,\" wrote\r\nMiss Nightingale to Lady McNeill (July 17), \"for your congratulations on\r\nmy sister's marriage, which took place last month. _She_ likes it, which\r\nis the main thing. And my father is very fond of Sir Harry Verney, which\r\nis the next best thing. He is old and rich, which is a disadvantage. He\r\nis active, has a will of his own and four children ready-made, which is\r\nan advantage. Unmarried life, at least in our class, takes everything\r\nand gives nothing back to this poor earth. It runs no risk, it gives no\r\npledge to life. So, on the whole, I think these reflections tend to\r\napprobation.\" For herself she \"thinks,\" wrote her aunt, \"that each day\r\nmay be the last on which she will have power to work.\"\r\n\r\nAnd her ally, Mr. Herbert, was also feeling the strain. He had all the\r\nfour Sub-Commissions at work, and from time to time during this year\r\n(1858) he broke down--on one occasion under a sharp attack of pleurisy.\r\nIt was now Miss Nightingale's turn to lecture him. She wrote to Mrs.\r\nHerbert, begging her not to let Sidney call. \"I really am not ill,\" he\r\nwrote (March 18), \"only washy and weak, while I always recover\r\nwonderfully, and paying you a visit to-morrow will do me no harm but the\r\ncontrary.\" She wrote to Mr. Herbert himself, suggesting a cure at\r\nMalvern. \"I should like to come,\" he said (Sept. 16), \"and look at the\r\nPlace which I have a notion I shall some day go to, and see you\r\nepisodically, unless you had rather not be seen.\" But I do not think\r\nthat either of the allies expected, or desired, the other to take the\r\nadvice which they interchanged. Well or ill, each of them worked\r\nunrestingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nUpon the matter of Barracks, Mr. Herbert did the harder work.[274] He\r\ninspected barracks and hospitals throughout the Kingdom; he wrote or\r\nrevised each report upon them. But he or Dr. Sutherland, or Captain\r\nGalton, or all of them, reported the results of each inspection to their\r\n\"Chief,\" as they sometimes called her, and she was unfailing in\r\nsuggestions and criticisms. When the London barracks were being\r\noverhauled (for General Peel had obtained a substantial grant from the\r\nTreasury for immediate improvements), the \"woman's touch\" came into\r\nplay. She called into counsel her Crimean colleague, Mr. Soyer, and took\r\nthe improvement of the kitchens in hand. The work was only just begun\r\nwhen Mr. Soyer died suddenly. \"His death,\" she wrote to Captain Galton\r\n(Aug. 28), \"is a great disaster. Others have studied cookery for the\r\npurposes of gormandizing, some for show, but none but he for the purpose\r\nof cooking large quantities of food in the most nutritious manner for\r\ngreat numbers of men. He has no successor. My only comfort is that you\r\nwere imbued before his death with his doctrines, and that the Barracks\r\nCommission will now take up the matter for itself.\" In the work of the\r\nother three Sub-Commissions Miss Nightingale had a large share. Mr.\r\nHerbert, Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Farr (Statistics) were in constant\r\nconsultation with her, personally or by correspondence. There are\r\nhundreds of letters to her at this period, full of technical detail. \"I\r\ngive in,\" writes Mr. Herbert; \"your arguments are not to be answered.\"\r\n\"I want your help very much.\" \"I send a disagreeable letter I have\r\nreceived from Sir J. Hall. I will call on you to-morrow and talk it\r\nover.\" \"I send you a copy of the Instructions.\" \"I want help and\r\nadvice.\" At every stage of each transaction the allies were in close\r\nco-operation. The correspondence with Dr. Sutherland is sometimes in a\r\nlighter vein, and Mrs. Sutherland's letters to Miss Nightingale are\r\ndeeply affectionate. But the doctor, who was not always very\r\nbusiness-like, sometimes tried the patience of the exacting\r\nLady-in-Chief. Her aunt records a day when a tiff with Dr. Sutherland\r\ncaused her niece a serious attack of palpitation of the heart. Mr.\r\nHerbert was ill at the time and was waiting for a draft, which Dr.\r\nSutherland was to prepare, for submission to the Secretary of State.\r\nMiss Nightingale was requested to put pressure upon the doctor. At last\r\nthe draft came, and Mr. Herbert did not like it. He begged Miss\r\nNightingale to use her influence in obtaining some revisions. Dr.\r\nSutherland did not take this move kindly, and declined to call upon her.\r\nThe quarrel, however, was speedily composed. At a later date, Miss\r\nNightingale spent some weeks in the house of William and Mary Howitt at\r\nHighgate. \"It is not a mere phrase,\" wrote Mary Howitt, \"when I say that\r\nwe shall feel as if she had left a blessing behind.\" I suspect that this\r\nvisit was in order to enable Miss Nightingale to keep a firmer touch\r\nupon the \"Big Baby,\" as she and Mrs. Sutherland sometimes called the\r\ndoctor. \"This is the first day of grouse shooting, Caratina,\" wrote he,\r\nwhen the Barracks Commissioners were in the north; \"but as you will\r\nallow none of your 'wives' to go to the moors, the festival has passed\r\noff without observance.\"\r\n\r\n  [274] The original members of the Barracks and Hospitals Commission were\r\n         Mr. Herbert, Dr. Sutherland (Miss Nightingale's constant\r\n         colleague), and Captain Galton (married to her cousin). It was\r\n         appointed October 1857. Its General Report (presented to\r\n         Parliament, 1861) was dated April 1861 (see below, p. 388). It had\r\n         previously issued many interim reports. Reconstituted, it\r\n         ultimately became a permanent body (vol. ii. p. 64).\r\n\r\nThus, then, the Reformers worked during 1858. Their main labours were\r\ninterrupted in the middle of the year by a last fight over the Netley\r\nHospital. Lord Panmure had gone ahead with the building in spite of Miss\r\nNightingale's objections and of her conversion of Lord Palmerston to her\r\nviews (p. 341). But since then, the Report of the Royal Commission had\r\nappeared, the Hospitals and Barracks Sub-Commission had presented an\r\n_interim_ report against Netley, and there was a new Secretary of State.\r\nMr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale made a hard fight, and she wrote a\r\nseries of newspaper articles[275] in the hope of stirring up public\r\nopinion. But General Peel was actuated by the same motives that governed\r\nLord Panmure. He appointed another Committee to report on the adverse\r\nReport, and proceeded with the building. \"Unhappily, the country which\r\nhas led the van in sanitary science,\" says an impartial authority, \"has\r\nas its chief military hospital a building far from satisfactory.\"[276]\r\n\r\n  [275] See Bibliography A, No. 10.\r\n\r\n  [276] Professor F. de Chaumont in the 9th ed. of the _Encyclopædia\r\n        Britannica_. Netley is, however, no longer the chief military\r\n        hospital.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's final defeat on this particular issue suggested to\r\nher the importance of instructing public opinion upon the whole question\r\nof Hospital Construction. She accordingly contributed two Papers on the\r\nsubject to the Social Science Congress at Liverpool in October 1858. Her\r\nfriend, Dr. Farr, who was present, reported the marked attention which\r\nthe reading of the Papers attracted, and at the request of Lord\r\nShaftesbury, the President of the Congress, Miss Nightingale presented\r\nher manuscript to the city of Liverpool as a memento of the occasion.\r\nThese Papers were the germ of her famous _Notes on Hospitals_, to which\r\nwe shall come in the next Part of this Memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nOn the main issue of Army Medical Reform, Miss Nightingale sought to\r\ninfluence public opinion by the distribution among carefully selected\r\npersons of her _Notes on Matters affecting the Health, Efficiency and\r\nHospital Administration of the British Army_. The _Notes_ were written,\r\nand for the most part printed, in the preceding year, and I have already\r\ndescribed them. The distribution of them at this time brought her\r\nletters of encouragement from many of the most illustrious and\r\ninfluential personages in the land. The Prince Consort, in an autograph\r\nletter of thanks, took occasion to assure her once more of \"the Queen's\r\nhigh appreciation of her services.\" The Princess Royal, then Crown\r\nPrincess of Prussia, begged for a copy; and Miss Nightingale, in reply\r\n(Nov. 9), asked Sir James Clark to express for her how \"very gratifying\r\nthe Princess Royal's kind message was. I cannot tell you the deep\r\ninterest I feel in that young heart so full of all that is true and\r\ngood, or with what pleasure I anticipate the benefit to her country and\r\nours from her being what she is.\" These two women, between whom there\r\nwere many points of sympathy, were often to correspond and to meet in\r\nlater years. The Duke of Cambridge, in a particularly cordial letter,\r\nassured Miss Nightingale \"that the whole Army is most sensible of the\r\ndevotion with which you may be said to have sacrificed yourself to its\r\nwork on a recent memorable occasion, and I cannot but add my personal\r\nadmiration of your noble conduct on that as on all other occasions.\" The\r\nDuke added the hope that from time to time he might have it in his power\r\nto carry out her \"valuable suggestions for the comfort and welfare of\r\nthe troops.\" Miss Nightingale often trounced the Commander-in-Chief in\r\nher correspondence. He had so little sympathy with any radical reform\r\nthat she could not consider his popular title of \"The Soldier's Friend\"\r\nto be really well deserved. Yet she had a certain fondness for him, and\r\nwas alive to his better qualities. She had seen him first during the\r\nCrimean War, and she recalled a characteristic incident. \"What makes\r\n'George' popular,\" she wrote, \"is this kind of thing. In going round\r\nthe Scutari Hospitals at their worst time with me, he recognized a\r\nsergeant of the Guards (he has a royal memory, always a great passport\r\nto popularity) who had had at least one-third of his body shot away, and\r\nsaid to him with a great oath, calling him by his Christian and surname,\r\n'Aren't you dead yet?' The man said to me afterwards, 'Sa feelin' o' Is\r\nRoyal Ighness, wasn't it, m'm?' with tears in his eyes. George's manner\r\nis very popular, his oaths are popular, with the army. And he is\r\ncertainly the best man, both of business and of nature, at the Horse\r\nGuards: that, even I admit. And there is no man I should like to see in\r\nhis place.\"[277]\r\n\r\n  [277] Letter to Harriet Martineau, October 8, 1861. Large as were Miss\r\n        Nightingale's schemes for army reorganization, she never dared to\r\n        suggest the abolition of the Horse Guards and the retirement of\r\n        its chief.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was careful to send copies of her _Notes_ to those who,\r\nby their pens, could influence public opinion. Among these was Harriet\r\nMartineau, to whom Miss Nightingale wrote (Nov. 30): \"The Report is in\r\nno sense public property. And I have a great horror of its being made\r\nuse of after my death by _Women's Missionaries_ and those kinds of\r\npeople. I am brutally indifferent to the wrongs or the rights of my sex.\r\nAnd I should have been equally so to any controversy as to whether women\r\nought or ought not to do what I have done for the Army; though a woman,\r\nhaving the opportunity and _not_ doing it, ought, I think, to be burnt\r\nalive.\" Miss Martineau, promising to be discreet, asked if she might\r\nmake use of Miss Nightingale's facts and suggestions. The offer was\r\npromptly accepted, and Miss Martineau was supplied with copious powder\r\nand shot. Miss Nightingale was probably the more attracted by Miss\r\nMartineau's offer to popularise her _Notes_ owing to a very earnest\r\nletter from Dean Milman. He had read the _Notes_ \"with serious attention\r\nand profound interest,\" and asked (Dec. 18): \"Is all this important\r\nknowledge, this strong practical good sense, this result of much toil,\r\nthought, experience to be confined to half-averted official ears, to be\r\nforced only on the reluctant attention of a few, and most of these too\r\nbusy and perhaps too opinionated to profit by it? Is it to be buried in\r\nthat most undisturbed grave of wise thought and useful information, a\r\nblue book? that most repulsive, unapproached, unapproachable place of\r\nsepulture? Surely you have not lived and laboured your life of devotion,\r\nyour labour of love, to leave public opinion untouched and unenlightened\r\nbut by what may creep out, as the general result of your views, or what\r\nmay be adopted by Government, perhaps imperfectly and parsimoniously?\r\nAre the many, who alone by the expression of their judgment and feelings\r\ncan keep the few up to their work, and encourage them by their approval\r\nand co-operation, to remain ignorant of what is of such vital import to\r\nthe army, to the country, to mankind?\" A series of articles by Miss\r\nMartineau in _The Daily News_, and afterwards a popular volume,[278]\r\ncarried Miss Nightingale's suggestions, at second-hand, into a large\r\ncircle. Between these two women there was a marked attraction. The\r\ncorrespondence about the illness and death of Miss Martineau's niece,\r\nand her reliance upon Miss Nightingale's sympathy, are particularly\r\ntouching. Each of them had sorrows, each was seriously ill, and each\r\nalike at once turned to her public work.\r\n\r\n  [278] _England and her Soldiers_, by Harriet Martineau, 1859. Miss\r\n        Nightingale's \"coxcomb\" diagrams were reproduced in this volume.\r\n        She revised Miss Martineau's MS., supplemented the publisher's\r\n        fee to the author, and bought £20 worth of the book for\r\n        presentation to reading-rooms.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1858 Miss Nightingale put out one of the most effective of\r\nher controversial pieces. Her facts and figures about the mortality of\r\nthe Army in the East, as printed in her _Notes_ and in the Royal\r\nCommission's Report, had not passed unchallenged, and a pamphlet had\r\nappeared calling them in question. Mr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale\r\nsuspected in it the hand of Sir John Hall, and she immediately prepared\r\na reply. This is entitled _A Contribution to the Sanitary History of the\r\nBritish Army during the late War with Russia_. It was published, early\r\nin 1859, anonymously, but all her friends detected her \"Roman hand.\" The\r\npamphlet which provoked it is dismissed in a contemptuous footnote: \"An\r\nobscure pamphlet, circulated without a printer's name, reproduces nearly\r\nevery possible statistical blunder on this and other points. It purports\r\nto be a defence of the defunct Army Medical Department, 'By a\r\nNon-Commissioner,' but it is more like a _jeu d'esprit_.\" The answer\r\ncontained in the body of Miss Nightingale's brochure is conclusive, and\r\nthe \"coxcombs\" were repeated in a yet more telling and attractive form\r\nthan before. It is the most concise, the most scathing, and the most\r\neloquent of all her accounts of the preventable mortality which she had\r\nwitnessed in the East. \"In a few truthful words,\" wrote Sir John\r\nMcNeill, in acknowledging an early copy (Dec. 26), \"you have told the\r\nwhole dreadful story, and I do not think that we shall hear any more of\r\ncontroversial medical statistics. 'Facts are chiels that winna ding and\r\ndowna be disputed.' So sang Burns, and he was seldom mistaken in his\r\nopinions. I have read every word of the _Contribution_, and pondered\r\nevery column and diagram, and I come to the conclusion that it is\r\ncomplete and unanswerable, but that it would be disparaging to such a\r\nwork to regard it as controversial. I wish with all my heart that every\r\nyoung officer in the British Army had a copy of it. The old I have\r\nlittle hope of.\" Miss Nightingale's mastery of the art of marshalling\r\nfacts to logical conclusions was recognized by her election in 1858 as a\r\nmember of the Statistical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThe new year (1859) brought an event of great importance to the cause of\r\nArmy Reform. In March, Lord Derby's stop-gap government was defeated on\r\nMr. Disraeli's Reform Bill, and after a general election Lord Palmerston\r\nreturned to power. Mr. Sidney Herbert, who for some years had been\r\nworking at army reform as an outsider, now became Secretary for War. \"I\r\nmust send you a line,\" he wrote to Miss Nightingale (June 13), \"to tell\r\nyou that I have undertaken the Ministry of War. I have undertaken it\r\nbecause in certain branches of administration I believe that I can be of\r\nuse, but I do not disguise from myself the severity of the task nor the\r\nprobability of my proving unequal to it. But I know that you will be\r\npleased to hear of my being there.... I will try to ride down to you\r\nto-morrow afternoon. God bless you!\" Mr. Herbert's task was not rendered\r\nless severe by the appointment of Mr. Gladstone as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. They were close and affectionate friends, but public economy\r\nwas with Mr. Gladstone the greater friend. Much of Mr. Herbert's\r\nstrength was exhausted in disputes with the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nover the question of the national defences. Mrs. Herbert sent to Miss\r\nNightingale the current riddle: \"Why is Gladstone like a lobster?\"\r\n\"Because he is so good, but he disagrees with everybody.\" Mr. Herbert\r\ncould by no means always count upon the Treasury for consent in all his\r\nschemes for improving the sanitary and moral condition of the Army.\r\nStill he was able, as Secretary of State, to accomplish a great deal;\r\nand it will be convenient here,--with some slight anticipation, in\r\ncertain cases, of chronological order--to summarize shortly the fruits\r\nof the long collaboration between Mr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale for\r\nthe health of the British soldier. She herself wrote such a summary in\r\n1861, in a Paper to which reference has been made already (p. 312), and\r\nI often use her own words.\r\n\r\nThe Barracks and Hospitals Improvement Commission had already done a\r\ngood deal when he came into office, and he continued the work. Buildings\r\nwere ventilated and warmed. Drainage was introduced or improved. The\r\nwater-supply was extended. The kitchens were remodelled. Gas was\r\nintroduced in place of the couple of \"dips,\" by the light of which it\r\nwas impossible for the men to read or pursue any occupation except\r\nsmoking. Structural improvements were made in many cases, and Mr.\r\nHerbert, so far as he could extract money from the Treasury,\r\nreconstructed buildings which had been condemned by his Commission. This\r\npolicy was abandoned for many years after his death, and later\r\ngenerations heard in consequence of sanitary scandals in barracks at\r\nWindsor and Dublin and elsewhere. The General Report of the Barracks and\r\nHospitals Commission, dated April 1861, was presented to Parliament in\r\nthat year, and many of Miss Nightingale's friends, on reading it,\r\nreferred to it as \"her book.\" They were not far wrong, for much of the\r\nReport, and especially the long section dealing with the proper\r\nprinciples of Hospital and Barrack Construction, was in large measure\r\nher work.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, in order to ensure that such principles should be\r\nbetter understood and carried out in the future, induced Mr. Herbert to\r\nappoint a special Barracks Works Committee, \"to report as to measures\r\nto simplify and improve the system under which all works and buildings,\r\nother than fortifications, are constructed, repaired, and maintained, in\r\norder to give a more direct responsibility to the persons employed in\r\nthose duties.\" Of this committee Captain Galton was a member, and the\r\nDraft Report was submitted to Miss Nightingale for criticism and\r\nsuggestion.[279] There are many causes to which the improved health of\r\nthe Army in our own time may be attributed, but the chief of them has\r\nprobably been the improvement of barrack accommodation, and for this the\r\nname of Florence Nightingale deserves to be held in grateful remembrance\r\nby the Army and by the nation.\r\n\r\n  [279] For its appointment, see below, p. 405; and for the successive\r\n        Committees, etc., in connection with barracks, see the Index,\r\n        Vol. II. (_under_ Barrack).\r\n\r\nAs a supplement to the improvements in barrack kitchens, Mr. Herbert\r\nintroduced a reform in a direction which Miss Nightingale had pressed\r\nupon Lord Panmure's attention[280]; he established a School of Practical\r\nCookery at Aldershot, for the training of regimental and hospital cooks\r\nin the art of giving men a wholesome meal. Miss Nightingale had been\r\npainfully impressed in the Crimea by the importance of this reform.\r\n\r\n  [280] See above, p. 331. The School of Cookery at Aldershot is mentioned\r\n        in the _General Report_ of the Barracks Commission, 1861,\r\n        p. 114 _n._\r\n\r\nThe second Sub-Commission was charged with the duty of reorganizing the\r\nArmy medical statistics. This was one of the requirements of rational\r\nreform which had most forcibly struck Miss Nightingale in the East. The\r\nemphasis which she laid upon this side of her experience, the\r\npersistence with which she pressed the matter, the statistical skill\r\nwith which she showed the way to a better system, are amongst the most\r\nvaluable of her services to the cause of Army Reform. When the\r\nsuggestions of the Sub-Commission were carried out, the British Army\r\nStatistics became the best and most useful then obtainable in\r\nEurope.[281]\r\n\r\n  [281] The Committee on Army Medical Statistics (Mr. Herbert, Sir A.\r\n        Tulloch, and Dr. Farr) reported in June 1858, and its Report was\r\n        printed in 1861. In the same year the _First Annual Statistical\r\n        Report on the Health of the Army_ (issued in March) was printed;\r\n        it was compiled by Dr. T. Graham Balfour, who was appointed head\r\n        of the statistical branch of the Army Medical Department.\r\n\r\nThe third Sub-Commission was to carry out another of Miss Nightingale's\r\nfavourite ideas: the establishment of an Army Medical School. There were\r\nhere the most wearisome delays and obstructions,[282] and it was not\r\nuntil Mr. Herbert himself became Secretary of State that he was able to\r\ngive effect to his Sub-Commission's Report. And even then, as soon as\r\nthe Minister's personal oversight was averted, the War Office \"Subs.\"\r\nset to work to defeat their chief. Mr. Herbert had appointed the staff\r\nin 1859, but it was not till September 1860 that the first students\r\narrived at Fort Pitt, Chatham. They promptly came to the conclusion\r\n\"that the School was a hoax.\" As well they might, for the School was\r\nwithout fittings or instruments of any kind! The explanation, which may\r\nbe read elsewhere,[283] is remarkable even in the annals of departmental\r\nmuddles. There was, apparently, no method known to the red-tape of the\r\nroutine-men whereby the School could be fitted, and it might have\r\nremained empty indefinitely, but that a trenchant letter from Miss\r\nNightingale secured the personal intervention of the Secretary of State.\r\n\"There! At last!\" wrote Mr. Herbert to her, in forwarding the official\r\norder at the end of its long travels through departments and\r\nsub-departments. The Army Medical School was peculiarly Miss\r\nNightingale's child, and she watched over its early stages with constant\r\nsolicitude. Mr. Herbert had commissioned her, in consultation with Sir\r\nJames Clark, to make the Regulations. She had the nomination of the\r\nprofessors. For the chair of Hygiene she nominated Dr. E. A. Parkes,\r\nwhose acquaintance she had made during the Crimean War. It would be\r\ndifficult to exaggerate the services which the stimulating teaching of\r\nthis great sanitarian rendered to the cause of military hygiene. He had\r\nmuch correspondence with Miss Nightingale in connection with the\r\nsyllabus of his first course of lectures. In every administrative\r\ndifficulty the professors went to her for help. The correspondence\r\nbetween her and Dr. Aitken[284] is especially voluminous. She had made\r\na successful fight, against much opposition, to have pathology included\r\nin the professoriate, and Dr. Aitken was ultimately appointed to the\r\nchair. He it was who set Miss Nightingale in motion about the fittings\r\nof the School. He often asked her to \"give us another push.\" \"Kind\r\nthanks,\" he wrote (March 1861) when a further hitch had arisen, \"for\r\nplacing our train on the proper line.\" Her intervention at headquarters\r\nwas necessary even to extract pay for the professors. \"I have just\r\nreceived an intimation from the War Office,\" Dr. Aitken wrote to her\r\n(Aug. 7, 1860), \"that Sir John Kirkland has been authorised to issue my\r\npay; so I presume the numerous officials concerned have been able to\r\nsatisfy each other that I am in existence. The 'at once' in this\r\ninstance is equal to six days--an activity I am inclined to believe is\r\ndue to your exertions on Sunday.\" Sunday was the day of the week on\r\nwhich, if on no other, she always saw Mr. Herbert. Dr. Aitken was\r\nsarcastic, and not without cause, about the Circumlocution Office; but\r\nit is possible that the fault was not always only on one side.\r\nProfessors are said to be sometimes \"children\" in matters of business;\r\nand on one tale of woe addressed to Miss Nightingale, the docket (in Dr.\r\nSutherland's handwriting, but doubtless at her dictation) is this: \"I\r\nhope the present difficulty has been got over, but it will be well to\r\nbear in mind that the School is so nearly connected with the\r\nadministrative part of the War Office, that all your future proceedings,\r\nwhether by minute or otherwise, should be concise and practical.\" The\r\nSchool survived the perils of its infancy, and introduced a most\r\nbeneficent reform by affording means of instruction in military hygiene\r\nand practice to candidates for the Army Medical Service. \"Formerly,\" as\r\nMiss Nightingale wrote, \"young men were sent to attend sick and wounded\r\nsoldiers, who _perhaps_ had never dressed a serious wound, or never\r\nattended a bedside, except in the midst of a crowd of students,\r\nfollowing in the wake of some eminent lecturer, who _certainly_ had\r\nnever been instructed in the most ordinary sanitary knowledge, although\r\none of their most important functions was hereafter to be the prevention\r\nof disease in climates and under circumstances where _prevention_ is\r\neverything, and medical treatment often little or nothing.\" Miss\r\nNightingale's services as the true founder of the School were publicly\r\nacknowledged at the time. Dr. Longmore, the Professor of Military\r\nSurgery, told the students that it was she \"whose opinion, derived from\r\nlarge experience and remarkable sagacity in observation, exerted an\r\nespecial influence in originating and establishing this School.\"[285]\r\n\"In the Army Medical School just instituted,\" wrote Sir James Clark,\r\n\"hygiene will form the most important branch of the young medical\r\nofficer's instruction. For originating this School we have to thank Miss\r\nNightingale, who, had her long and persevering efforts effected no other\r\nimprovement in the Army, would have conferred by this alone an\r\ninestimable boon upon the British soldier.\"[286]\r\n\r\n  [282] The story of them may be read in _Stanmore_, vol. ii. pp. 364-8.\r\n\r\n  [283] _Stanmore_, vol. ii. p. 367.\r\n\r\n  [284] Sir William Aitken (1825-1892), M.D. of Edinburgh;\r\n        assistant-pathologist to a medical commission during the Crimean\r\n        War; F.R.S. 1873; knighted, 1887. He held the professorship from\r\n        1860 till the year of his death.\r\n\r\n  [285] _Introductory Address at Fort Pitt_, _Chatham_, October 2, 1860,\r\n        by Deputy-Inspector-General T. Longmore, p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [286] Introduction, p. 20, to a new edition (1860) of Andrew Combe's\r\n        _Management of Infancy_.\r\n\r\nThe School was afterwards moved to Netley. It is now in London, is one\r\nof the Medical Schools in the University, and is placed in convenient\r\nproximity to a military hospital. The Tate Gallery, on the Embankment at\r\nMillbank, stands between two buildings which are of peculiar interest to\r\nany one concerned in the life and work of Florence Nightingale. To the\r\neast of the Gallery is the Royal Alexandra Hospital, a general military\r\nhospital for the London district. It is built, of course, on the\r\n\"pavilion\" plan, and in every other respect conforms to Miss\r\nNightingale's ideas of what a hospital should be--with many additions to\r\nits resources, which the progress of science has suggested since her\r\nday. A complete apparatus for X-ray treatment, capable of being packed\r\ninto five cases for service in the field, is likely to attract the\r\nspecial attention of a visitor. But in connection with Miss Nightingale\r\nthere was something else which struck me more. As I went through the\r\nsurgical wards with the Commandant, the smart \"orderlies\" (old style,\r\nnow the trained men of the Army Medical Corps) stood at attention. The\r\nColonel entered into conversation with the Sergeant of a ward. He was\r\nawaiting promotion until he had qualified in the hospital, under the\r\nMatron, Sisters, and Staff Nurses. Promotion in the Corps is now\r\ndependent on an examination _plus_ a certificate from the nursing\r\nauthorities. Into how great a thing has the introduction of female\r\nnursing for the Army, due to Miss Nightingale, grown, and how ironical\r\nare some of time's revenges which the development has brought with it!\r\nOriginally the female nurses occupied the lowest place; sometimes they\r\nwere little more than superior domestics, often they were amateurs, and\r\ntheir position was always a little nondescript. Now they represent the\r\nmost highly-trained and professional element, and without a certificate\r\nfrom them no male hospital attendant can win full promotion! And there\r\nwas another thing that struck me. After a tour of the surgical wards, I\r\ninquired about the medical wards; but time was pressing, \"and you would\r\nfind little to see there,\" said the Colonel, \"for the Army is so healthy\r\nin these days that there are few medical cases.\"[287]\r\n\r\n  [287] It should perhaps be explained that venereal cases are treated in\r\n        a separate hospital.\r\n\r\nOn the west of the Tate Gallery stands another, and a larger, pile of\r\nbuildings. These are occupied by the Royal Army Medical College, through\r\nwhich every Army Medical Officer has now to pass both a preliminary and\r\na post-graduate course. Shortly before I visited the College, I had been\r\nreading the large mass of Miss Nightingale's papers which contain her\r\nfirst suggestions for the foundation of the school, with her drafts for\r\nits rules and regulations; and which describe the struggles and\r\ndifficulties of its humble infancy. And then I was taken through the\r\nnoble institution into which it has developed; equipped with large\r\nlaboratories which are, I believe, among the best in the country, with\r\nsmaller laboratories for private research; with a department for those\r\n\"cultures\" which are said to have done so much to preserve the health of\r\nthe Army in India[288]; with a spacious lecture-theatre, a fine library,\r\na large museum; and with handsome mess-rooms for the comfort and\r\nconvenience of studious youth. The transition was like a\r\ntransformation-scene in a pantomime. The Fairy Godmother of the College\r\nwould have rejoiced to see it. Only one thing seemed to me to be\r\nwanting. There are portraits or other memorials of many of the men whose\r\nacquaintance we have made in these pages. In the entrance lobby there is\r\na bust of Dr. Thomas Alexander, whose appointment as Director-General\r\nMiss Nightingale procured. In the smoking-room there are portraits of\r\nthe first professors whom she nominated. I noticed no memorial of the\r\ntwo founders to whom the original institution of the College was\r\ndue--Sidney Herbert and Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\n  [288] This is a department of the College which would not have appealed\r\n        to Miss Nightingale. She loathed and mocked at inoculation. \"Oh,\r\n        yes, I know,\" she once said; \"they will give you smallpox or\r\n        diphtheria or plague or anything you like. You pays your money, and\r\n        you takes your choice.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the four Sub-Commissions--the \"wiping\" Sub-Commission--had\r\nvery varied duties assigned to it, and there was no branch of the reform\r\nbill which encountered more stubborn opposition from the permanent\r\nofficials. One of Mr. Herbert's many letters to Miss Nightingale on the\r\nsubject speaks of the \"gross ignorance, and darkness beyond all hope\" of\r\nthe principal obstructive, who maintained that the idea of a sanitary\r\nofficial was all fudge. Some of the work of this Sub-Commission need not\r\nbe detailed here. It framed a new Army Medical Officers' Warrant (issued\r\nby General Peel in 1858), and reorganized the Army Medical Department\r\n(1859). These were useful steps at the time, but there have been so many\r\nnew warrants and so many War Office reorganizations since then that this\r\npart of the reforms of Mr. Herbert and Miss Nightingale belongs in any\r\ndetail only to ancient history. The case is different with the general\r\nwork of the Wiping Sub-Commission. Here also there have been new\r\ndevelopments, and some of the forms have been changed; but in substance,\r\nthese have all been built upon the foundations laid in the years\r\n1859-60. To Miss Nightingale primarily, and to her more than to any\r\nother individual, is due the recognition of a principle which may seem\r\nself-evident at the present time, but which was entirely novel in her\r\nday--the principle that the Army Medical Department should care for the\r\nsoldier's _health_ as well as for his _sickness_. The Sub-Commission--or\r\nto go behind the form to the reality, Miss Nightingale and Mr.\r\nHerbert--drew up a Code for introducing the sanitary element in the\r\nArmy, defining the positions of Commanding and Medical Officers and\r\ntheir relative duties regarding the soldier's health, and constituting\r\nthe regimental surgeon the sanitary adviser of his commanding officer.\r\nThe same code contained regulations for organizing General Hospitals,\r\nand for improving the administration of Regimental Hospitals, both in\r\npeace and during war. Formerly, general hospitals in the field had to be\r\nimprovised, on no defined principles and on no defined personal\r\nresponsibility. The wonder is, not that they broke down, as they did in\r\nall our wars, but that they could be made to stand at all. In all our\r\nwars, again, the general hospitals had been signal failures--examples,\r\nas during the earlier months at Scutari, of how to kill, not to cure.\r\nThe general hospital system, devised in the Code--including its\r\ngovernor, principal medical officer, captain of orderlies, female\r\nnurses, and their Superintendent (Mrs. Shaw Stewart)--was realized in\r\n1861 in the hospital at Woolwich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:     _Florence Nightingale\r\n                        about 1858\r\n               from a photograph by Goodman_]\r\n\r\nThere were some other reforms introduced by Mr. Herbert, as Secretary of\r\nState, which owed their origin to Miss Nightingale's experiences,\r\nobservation, and suggestions. In January 1861 Mr. Herbert issued a new\r\nPurveyor's Warrant and Regulations. Hitherto \"the Purveying Department,\r\nlike many others, had no well-defined position, duties, or\r\nresponsibilities. It was efficient or inefficient almost by chance. Like\r\nother departments, it broke down when tried by war; and all its defects\r\nwere visited on the sick and wounded men, for whose special benefit it\r\nprofessed to exist.\" The new Code \"defined with precision the duties of\r\neach class of purveying officers, together with their relation to the\r\nArmy Medical Department. They provided all necessaries and comforts for\r\nmen in hospital (both in the field and at home) on fixed scales, instead\r\nof requiring sick and wounded men (even in the field) to bring with them\r\ninto hospital articles for their own use, which they had lost before\r\nreaching it.\" The reader will remember how largely purveying defects\r\nentered into Miss Nightingale's difficulties in the East, and a\r\nreference to her letters from Scutari will show that Mr. Herbert's Code\r\nwas based on the broad lines of her suggestions. As is hardly\r\nsurprising, since she drafted the Code in consultation with Sir John\r\nMcNeill.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert also appointed a Committee to reorganize the Army Hospital\r\nCorps (1860). \"In former times there were no proper attendants on the\r\nsick. For regimental hospitals a steady man was appointed hospital\r\nsergeant, and two or three soldiers, fit for nothing else, were sent\r\ninto the hospital to be under the orders of the medical officer, who, if\r\nhe were fortunate enough to find one man fit to nurse a patient, was\r\nsure to lose him by his being recalled 'to duty'; sometimes, indeed, men\r\nwere nominated in rotation over the sick in hospital as they would mount\r\nguard over a store. No special training was considered necessary; no\r\none, except the medical officer, who was helpless, had the least idea\r\nthat attendance on the sick is as much a special business as medical\r\ntreatment. Unsuccessful attempts had been made to organize a corps of\r\norderlies, unconnected with regiments; the result was most\r\nunsatisfactory. Mr. Herbert's Committee proposed to constitute a\r\ncorps--the members of which, for regimental purposes, were to be\r\ncarefully selected by the commanding and medical officers--specially\r\ntrained for their duties, and then attached permanently to the\r\nregimental hospital.\" This reform, which owed much to Miss Nightingale's\r\nsuggestions, was carried into effect shortly after Mr. Herbert's death.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert also took up those questions of the soldier's moral health\r\nin which Miss Nightingale had been a pioneer.[289] In 1861 he appointed\r\na Committee[290] to consider how best to provide soldiers' day-rooms and\r\ninstitutes, in order to counteract the moral evils supposed to be\r\ninseparable from garrisons and camps. The Committee, of which Miss\r\nNightingale's friends, Colonel Lefroy, Captain Galton, and Dr.\r\nSutherland were members, showed that \"the men's barracks can be made\r\nmore of a home, can be better provided with libraries and reading-rooms;\r\nthat separate rooms can be attached to barracks, where men can meet\r\ntheir comrades, sit with them, talk with them, have their newspaper and\r\ntheir coffee, if they want it, play innocent games, and write letters;\r\nthat every barrack, in short, may easily be provided with a kind of\r\nsoldiers' club, to which the men can resort when off duty, instead of to\r\nthe everlasting barrack-room or the demoralizing dram-shop; and that in\r\nlarge camps or garrisons, such as Aldershot and Portsmouth, the men may\r\neasily have a club of their own out of barracks. The Committee also\r\nrecommended increased means of occupation, in the way of soldiers'\r\nworkshops, out-door games and amusements, and rational recreation by\r\nlectures and other means. The plan was tried with great success at\r\nGibraltar, Chatham, and Montreal. Mr. Herbert's latest act was to direct\r\nan inquiry at Aldershot as to the best means of introducing the system\r\nthere.\" Miss Nightingale, in thus summarizing the case, did not state,\r\nwhat her correspondence shows to have been the fact, that she had been\r\nthe prime mover in the appointment of the Committee; that, as already\r\nrelated (p. 351), she had worked hard to obtain a reading-room, etc., at\r\nAldershot; and that, in the case of Gibraltar, the equipment of the room\r\nowed much to gifts from her own private purse and to the contributions\r\nof personal friends (Mrs. Gaskell among them) whom she had interested in\r\nthe scheme. Here, as in so many other directions, Miss Nightingale's\r\nwork as a pioneer has been greatly developed; and no modern barrack is\r\ndeemed complete without its regimental institute, with recreation room,\r\nreading-room, coffee-room, and lecture-room, while means of out-door\r\nrecreation and shops for various trades are also provided.\r\n\r\n  [289] See above, p. 281.\r\n\r\n  [290] This Committee received its instructions on Feb. 17, and reported\r\n        on Aug. 24, 1861. The Report (1861) is No. 2867 in the\r\n        Parliamentary Papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nIn recounting Mr. Herbert's reforms, Miss Nightingale brought the\r\nresults of them, after her usual manner, to the statistical test. She\r\nprefixed to her Memoir some coloured diagrams showing how Mr. Herbert\r\nfound the Army and how he left it. In the three years 1859-60-61, just\r\none-half of the Englishmen who entered the Army died (at home stations)\r\nper annum as formerly died. The total mortality at home stations from\r\n_all diseases_ had become less than was formerly the mortality from\r\nconsumption and chest diseases _alone_. The results of comparisons of\r\nBritish armies in the field were equally striking. The China expedition\r\nput the reforms to the test. \"An expeditionary force was sent to the\r\nopposite side of the world, into a hostile country, notorious for its\r\nepidemic diseases. Every required arrangement for the preservation of\r\nhealth was made, with the result that the mortality of this force,\r\nincluding wounded, was little more than 3 per cent per annum, while the\r\n'constantly sick' in hospital were about the same as at home. During the\r\nfirst months of the Crimean War the mortality was at the rate of 60 per\r\ncent, and the 'constantly sick' in the hospitals were sevenfold those in\r\nthe war hospitals in China.\" The improvement in the health of the Army\r\nhas, in peace at any rate, been progressive. In 1857 the annual rate of\r\nmortality in the Army at home was 17·5 per 1000. Forty years later it\r\nhad fallen to 3·42. In 1911 it was 2·47.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, Mr. Herbert undertook in 1859 the chairmanship of the\r\nRoyal Commission on the Sanitary State of the Indian Army. Other work of\r\nhis in connection with the Army is well known; and some of it--such as\r\nhis Fortification Scheme--did not endure, but these matters do not\r\nconcern us here. His measures for the health and well-being of the\r\nsoldiers were what Miss Nightingale was interested in; and this joint\r\nwork of theirs has been of lasting benefit. After Sidney Herbert's death\r\nthere was an arrest in reform; but the main lines laid down by him have\r\nbeen followed to our own day. In 1896 a friend in the War Office went\r\nthrough Miss Nightingale's Memoir of Sidney Herbert for her, and noted\r\nthe present state of things in relation to it. The Army Sanitary\r\nCommittee was still in existence. The School of Cookery at Aldershot was\r\nin the Queen's Regulations. The General Military Hospitals were\r\nmaintained. The Army Medical School had been moved to Netley. The Army\r\nMedical Statistics were still published annually. The position of Army\r\nMedical Officers had been further improved. There was a regularly\r\norganized Medical Staff Corps. The recommendations of the Barracks Works\r\nCommittee of 1861 had been carried out, with the result that the\r\nengineer officers had more individual responsibility, and were better\r\nacquainted than formerly with the details of healthy barrack and\r\nhospital construction. Soldiers' Institutes had been put up on War\r\nOffice land at several stations. Recreation and reading-rooms were to be\r\nfound in most barracks, and no new barrack was erected without them.\r\nSuch changes as have taken place since 1896 have been for the better, as\r\nI have indicated in preceding pages; for the better, and more in line\r\nwith Miss Nightingale's ideas. Her great work, _Notes on the Army_,\r\ncontained, as events were to prove, not only the scheme of all Sidney\r\nHerbert's reforms (except those relating to defence), but the germ, and\r\noften the details, of further reforms (within the same sphere) which\r\nhave continued to our own day. During the years of her co-operation with\r\nMr. Herbert, Miss Nightingale chafed at obstruction and delay, and after\r\nhis death she cried out bitterly at the cessation of further progress.\r\nBut in the end it was as her wise mentor, Sir John McNeill, wrote (March\r\n26, 1859):--\"It vexes me greatly to find that you are thwarted and\r\nannoyed by such things as you tell me of, but I am not in the least\r\nsurprised. I did not expect you to accomplish so much in so short a\r\ntime. Be assured that the progress from a worse to a better system is in\r\nalmost every department of human affairs a progress slow and\r\ninterrupted. Do not then be discouraged. If you have not done all that\r\nyou desired--and who ever did?--you have done more than any one else\r\never did or could have done, and the good you have done will live after\r\nyou, growing from generation to generation. I do not remember any\r\ninstance in which new ideas have made more rapid progress.\"\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the new ideas in relation to the Army was pointed out in\r\nMiss Nightingale's summary of Mr. Herbert's services. \"He will be\r\nremembered chiefly,\" she wrote, \"as the first War Minister who ever\r\nseriously set himself to the task of saving life, who ever took the\r\ntrouble to master a difficult subject so wisely and so well as to be\r\nable to husband the resources of this country, in which human life is\r\nmore expensive than in any other, more expensive than anything else, and\r\nto preserve the efficiency of its defenders.\" In this work, during Mr.\r\nHerbert's term of office, as in the preceding years, Miss Nightingale\r\nwas his constant assistant, and often the originator. They conferred\r\npersonally or by letter almost every day. No move in the sphere of\r\nsanitary reform was made by the Minister for War until he had taken her\r\nopinion. Every draft was submitted to her criticism and suggestion. When\r\nMr. Herbert took office, his wife wrote (June 16, 1859) to thank Miss\r\nNightingale for her \"dear note of congratulations,\" adding, \"He entirely\r\nagrees with your suggestions of this morning, and I am copying your\r\nCircular Note for the four pundits.\" In the following month (July 26),\r\nhe sends her the proposed Sanitary Regulations: \"I shall be very much\r\nobliged if you will go over the papers with Sutherland.\" \"Sidney is\r\ncoming to see you to-day (Aug. 13) to talk about the Regulations.\" Four\r\ndays later: \"Can Miss Nightingale give me the names of some Governors\r\nfor our new General Hospitals?\" In later months, the scheme for the\r\nMedical School and the new Regulations for Purveyors were discussed\r\nbetween them. On one occasion a dispatch from Miss Nightingale, enclosed\r\nunder cover to Mrs. Herbert, followed the Minister to Windsor: \"I gave\r\nyour letter to your 'Sovereign'; it's lucky the real one did not see\r\nyour cover.\" The correspondence of 1860 is to like effect. \"Here is a\r\ndispute which is Hebrew to me; would you look it over with Sutherland?\"\r\n\"I have written in our joint sense,\" and so forth. Miss Nightingale\r\nsupplied, however, more than detail--for one thing, persistent stimulus.\r\nAt the end it was stimulus to a dying man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                        THE DEATH OF SIDNEY HERBERT\r\n\r\n                                  (1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Cavour's last words: _La cosa va_. That is the life I should like\r\n     to have lived. That is the death I should like to die.--SIDNEY HERBERT\r\n     (_as recorded by Florence Nightingale_).\r\n\r\nThe progress of the reforms, sketched in the foregoing chapter, was\r\nsomewhat impeded, and an extension of them to a further point was\r\naltogether arrested, by a cause against which neither Mr. Herbert's\r\ncourageous spirit nor Miss Nightingale's resolute will could avail. The\r\nMinister's health broke down under the long strain; he was stricken by\r\ndisease; and, with failing health, his grasp of affairs was necessarily\r\nrelaxed.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end came early in December 1860. \"A sad change,\"\r\nwrote Miss Nightingale from Hampstead (Dec. 6) to her uncle, \"has come\r\nover the spirit of my (not dreams, but) too strong realities. Mr.\r\nHerbert is said to have a fatal disease. You know I don't believe in\r\nfatal diseases, but fatal to his work I believe this _will be_. He came\r\nover himself to tell me and to discuss what part of the work had better\r\nbe given up. I shall always respect the man for having seen him so. He\r\nwas not low, but awe-struck. It was settled that he should give up the\r\nHouse of Commons, but keep on office at least till some of the things\r\nare done which want doing. It is another reason for my wishing to go to\r\ntown soon, as he is particularly forbidden damp, and to see him here\r\nalways entails a night-ride.\" To their meeting on this occasion, early\r\nin December, Miss Nightingale often referred in letters of a later date.\r\nMr. Herbert had put before her the three alternatives between which he\r\nhad to choose. He might retire from public life altogether. He might\r\nretire from office, retaining his seat in the House of Commons. Or he\r\nmight retain his office, and leave the House of Commons for the House of\r\nLords. The first alternative, though it might seem to promise the best\r\nhope of recovery, was soon put away: it offered small temptation to a\r\nman of Herbert's buoyancy of spirit and high sense of public duty. The\r\nsecond alternative was that to which he at first inclined. He was\r\nessentially a politician, and a \"House of Commons man.\" He had sat for\r\ntwenty-eight years in that House, where his fine appearance, his\r\npersonal charm, and his considerable gift of eloquence made him a\r\ncommanding and popular figure. To go to the House of Lords was, as he\r\nthought and said, to be \"shelved.\"[291] Miss Nightingale urged him with\r\nall her formidable powers of persuasion, to make the sacrifice for the\r\nsake of their unfinished work. And so it was agreed; at the cost of many\r\na pang on his part, as he confessed, but to the relief of his wife. \"A\r\nthousand thanks,\" she wrote to Miss Nightingale, \"for all you have said\r\nand done,\" and \"God bless you for all your love and sympathy.\" Mr.\r\nHerbert retained office, resigned his seat in the Commons, and was\r\ncreated Lord Herbert of Lea.\r\n\r\n  [291] It was Lord Herbert, who, on sitting down after his first speech\r\n        in the House of Lords, and on being asked by a friend beside him\r\n        whether he had found it difficult, replied, \"Difficult! It was like\r\n        addressing sheeted tombstones by torchlight.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale did not fully realize how ill Lord Herbert was. She did\r\nnot remember that a life entirely laid out, as hers was, for work, and\r\nfreed from all distraction, involves less strain than one in which\r\nsocial ties, general conversation, family responsibilities and\r\njourneyings to and fro fill up the time between hours of work. And she\r\nwas passionately set upon the accomplishment of the work in which they\r\nwere engaged; she longed to see it crowned and made secure. Every step\r\nalready taken by Mr. Herbert in the War Office had been an\r\nadministrative improvement. \"The great principle involved in his\r\nreforms\" was, she wrote, \"to simplify procedure, to abolish divided\r\nresponsibility, to define clearly the duties of each head of a\r\ndepartment, and of each class of office; to hold heads responsible for\r\ntheir respective departments, with direct communication with the\r\nSecretary of State.\"[292] The cause of Army Reform would not be\r\ncompleted, the permanence of the improvements already made would not be\r\nsecured, unless every department of the War Office was similarly\r\nreorganized under a general and coherent scheme. So Miss Nightingale\r\nurged her friend forward to \"one fight more, the best and the last.\" The\r\nWar Office, she had written to him (Nov. 18, 1859), \"is a very slow\r\noffice, an enormously expensive office, and one in which the Minister's\r\nintentions can be entirely negatived by all his sub-departments and\r\nthose of each of the sub-departments by every other.\" Mr. Herbert had\r\nagreed. A departmental committee had been appointed to report upon\r\nreorganization, and Lord de Grey[293] (who was Under-Secretary until Mr.\r\nHerbert went to the Lords) had drafted a scheme. This was the scheme\r\nwhich in substance Miss Nightingale now urged Lord Herbert to carry\r\nthrough. But the Horse Guards was on the alert to mark the least\r\ninfringement of its privileges, and Sir Benjamin Hawes, the Permanent\r\nUnder-Secretary at the War Office, was copious with objections. There\r\nare amongst Miss Nightingale's papers many drafts in which she and Dr.\r\nSutherland reorganized the War Office from top to bottom. Sir Benjamin\r\nmight have smiled rather grimly, and then set himself with the greater\r\ndetermination to keep things as they were, had he seen how near the\r\nbottom was the place into which Miss Nightingale proposed to reorganize\r\n_him_. She was quite frank about it. \"The scheme will probably result in\r\nHawes's resignation,\" she wrote; \"that is another of its advantages.\" To\r\nreorganize the War Office on paper is an occupation which, during fifty\r\nfollowing years, was to beguile the leisure of amateurs, and to fill\r\nwith disappointed hopes the laborious days of many a Minister. To carry\r\nout any such scheme into practice is a task which only a Minister, in\r\nfull fighting force, could hope to accomplish. It was beyond the power\r\nof a dying man.\r\n\r\n  [292] _Army Reform under Lord Herbert_, pp. 4-5.\r\n\r\n  [293] Better known as the Marquis of Ripon, to which rank he was\r\n        promoted in 1871.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had her fears from the first. \"Our scheme of\r\nreorganization,\" she wrote to Sir John McNeill (Jan. 17, 1861), \"is at\r\nlast launched at the War Office; but I feel that Hawes may make it fail:\r\nthere is no strong hand over him.\" Lord Herbert struggled on manfully\r\nwith his many tasks (including, it should be remembered, constant\r\ndispute with Mr. Gladstone over the Army Estimates), but his strength\r\ngrew constantly less. At last he had to confess that, on the matter\r\nwhich Miss Nightingale had urged him to carry through, he was beaten:--\r\n\r\n     (_Lord Herbert to Miss Nightingale._) _June_ 7 [1861].... As to the\r\n     organization I am at my wits' end. The real truth is that I do not\r\n     understand it. I have not the bump of system in me. I believe more\r\n     in good men than in good systems. De Grey understands it much\r\n     better.... [He then describes certain minor reforms in personnel,\r\n     including a definite sphere of responsibility for Captain Galton.]\r\n     This I should like to do before I go. And now comes the question,\r\n     when is that to be and what had I best do and what leave to be done\r\n     by others. I feel that I am not now doing justice to the War Office\r\n     or myself. On days when the morning is spent on a sofa drinking\r\n     gulps of brandy till I am fit to crawl down to the Office, I am not\r\n     very energetic when I get there. I have still two or three matters\r\n     which I should like to settle and finish, but I am by no means\r\n     clear that the organization of the Office is one of them....\r\n     [Further official details.] I cannot end even this long letter\r\n     without a word on a subject of which my mind is full and yours will\r\n     be too--Cavour. What a life! what a life! and what a death! I know\r\n     of no fifty lives which could be put in competition with his. It\r\n     casts a shade over all Europe. While he lived, one felt so\r\n     confident for Italy, that he could hold his own against Austria,\r\n     against the _wild_ Italians, against the Pope, and above all\r\n     against L. Napoleon. But what a glorious career! and what a work\r\n     done in one life! I don't know where to look for anything to\r\n     compare with it.\r\n\r\nCavour had died the day before, and his last recorded words were of his\r\nCause: _la cosa va_. The pathos with which the events of the next few\r\nweeks were to invest this letter from Sidney Herbert made a deep\r\nimpression upon Miss Nightingale. Among some pencilled jottings of hers,\r\nwritten thirty or forty years after, she recalled phrases in the letter\r\nand in conversations of the same date. But, at the immediate moment,\r\nLord Herbert's confession of failure filled her with despairing\r\nvexation. Sir John McNeill, to whom she poured out her soul, took the\r\ntruer view of the case. It was sad, he admitted (June 18), that Lord\r\nHerbert should have been \"beaten on his own chosen ground by Ben Hawes.\r\nBut,\" he added, \"the truth, I suspect, is that he has been beaten by\r\ndisease, and not by Ben.\" \"What strikes me in this great defeat,\" she\r\nreplied (June 21), \"more painfully even than the loss to the Army is the\r\ntriumph of the bureaucracy over the leaders--the political aristocracy\r\nwho at least advocate higher principles. A Sidney Herbert beaten by a\r\nBen Hawes is a greater humiliation really (as a matter of principle)\r\nthan the disaster of Scutari.\"\r\n\r\nDisease held Lord Herbert in its grasp, but with indomitable spirit he\r\nworked on at matters, other than reorganization, in which he and Miss\r\nNightingale were specially interested. One of these matters was the\r\nestablishment of a General Military Hospital at Woolwich. \"Among the few\r\npractical things,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to Sir John McNeill (June 21),\r\n\"which I hope to succeed in saving from the general wreck of the War\r\nOffice is the organization of one General Hospital on your plan. Colonel\r\nWilbraham has consented to be Governor. Last week we made a list of the\r\nstaff, and the names were approved by Lord Herbert. There has been an\r\nimmense uproar, perhaps no more than you anticipated, from the Army\r\nMedical Department and the Horse Guards.\" Lord Herbert was to send her\r\nthe draft of the Governor's Commission, and she asked Sir John McNeill's\r\nassistance in revising it. Then she was requested to name a\r\nSuperintendent of nurses. Her choice fell upon one of her Crimean\r\ncolleagues, Mrs. Shaw Stewart, an admirable, though a somewhat\r\n\"difficult\" lady, who had now quarrelled with Miss Nightingale, but\r\nwhose efficiency marked her out for the post. Two other of Lord\r\nHerbert's last official acts referred also to the health of the British\r\nsoldier, and each was suggested by Miss Nightingale. One was the\r\nappointment of the Barracks Works Committee (June 6) already mentioned\r\n(p. 389); the other, the appointment of Captain Galton and Dr.\r\nSutherland as Commissioners, with Mr. J. J. Frederick as Secretary, to\r\nimprove the Barracks and Hospitals on the Mediterranean Station.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June, Lord Herbert's health had become worse, and he was\r\nordered abroad to Spa. On July 9 he called at the Burlington Hotel to\r\nsay good-bye to Miss Nightingale. They never met again. A week later, he\r\nwrote to her from Spa:--\r\n\r\n     I enclose a letter from Mrs. Shaw Stewart. To cut matters short and\r\n     start the thing, I have begged her to select the nurses on their\r\n     own terms. I mean as to qualifications, as the Regulations define\r\n     salary, etc. So I hope we shall at any rate start the thing now. I\r\n     have written an undated letter of resignation to Palmerston to be\r\n     used whenever convenient to him. I have not written it without a\r\n     pang, but I believe it to be the right and best course. I believe\r\n     Lewis, with de Grey for under-secretary, is to be my successor. I\r\n     can fancy no fish more out of water than Lewis amidst Armstrong\r\n     guns and General Officers, but he is a gentleman, an honest man,\r\n     and de Grey will be invaluable for the office and for many of the\r\n     especial interests to which I specially looked. I have a letter\r\n     from Codrington proposing another site for the new branch\r\n     Institute. I have sent it to Galton. I wish I had any confidence\r\n     that you are as much better as I am.\r\n\r\nLord Herbert's buoyancy of spirit remained to him when physical strength\r\nwas quickly ebbing. He became worse, and, on July 25, left Spa for home.\r\nHe died at Wilton on August 2. \"To the last,\" wrote his sister to Miss\r\nNightingale, \"he had the same charm, that dear winning smile, that\r\nalmost playful, pretty way of saying everything.\" But among his last\r\narticulate words were these: \"Poor Florence! Poor Florence! Our joint\r\nwork unfinished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe death of Sidney Herbert was a heavy blow to Miss Nightingale--the\r\nheaviest, perhaps, which she ever had to suffer. It meant not only the\r\nloss of an old friend and companion, in whose society she had constantly\r\nlived and moved for five years. It meant also the interruption of their\r\njoint work, which was more to her than life itself. She felt in the\r\nseverance of their alliance the true bitterness of death:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to her Father._) HAMPSTEAD, _Aug._ 21 [1861].\r\n     DEAR PAPA--Indeed your sympathy is very dear to me. So few people\r\n     know in the least what I have lost in my dear master. Indeed I know\r\n     no one but myself who had it to lose. For no two people pursue\r\n     together the same object, as I did with him. And when they lose\r\n     their companion by death, they have in fact lost no companionship.\r\n     Now he takes my life with him. My work, the object of my life, the\r\n     means to do it, all in one, depart with him. \"Grief fills the room\r\n     up of my absent\" master. I cannot say it \"walks up and down\" with\r\n     me. For I don't walk up and down. But it \"eats\" and sleeps and\r\n     wakes with me. Yet I can truly say that I see it is better that God\r\n     should not work a miracle to save Sidney Herbert, altho' his death\r\n     involves the misfortune, moral and physical, of five hundred\r\n     thousand men, and altho' it would have been but to set aside a few\r\n     trifling physical laws to save him.... \"The righteous perisheth and\r\n     no man layeth it to heart.\" The Scripture goes on to say \"none\r\n     considering that he is taken away from the evil to come.\" _I_ say\r\n     \"none considering that he is taken away from the good he might have\r\n     done.\" Now not one man remains (that I can call a man) of all those\r\n     whom I began work with, five years ago. And I alone, of all men\r\n     \"most deject and wretched,\" survive them all. I am sure I meant to\r\n     have died.... Ever, dear Papa, your loving child, F.\r\n\r\nHer grief was accompanied and intensified by some remorse:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Harriet Martineau._) HAMPSTEAD, _Sept._ 24\r\n     [1861].... And I, too, was hard upon him. I told him that Cavour's\r\n     death was a blow to European liberty, but that a greater blow was\r\n     that Sidney Herbert should be beaten on his own ground by a\r\n     bureaucracy. I told him that no man in my day had thrown away so\r\n     noble a game with all the winning cards in his hands. And his\r\n     angelic temper with me, at the same time that he felt what I said\r\n     was true, I shall never forget. I wish people to know that what was\r\n     done was done by a man struggling with death--to know that he\r\n     thought so much more of what he had not done than of what he had\r\n     done--to know that all his latter suffering years were filled not\r\n     by a selfish desire for his own salvation--far less for his own\r\n     ambition (he hated office, his was the purest ambition I have ever\r\n     known), but by the struggle of exertion for our benefit.\r\n\r\nHappily for her peace of mind there came to her an almost immediate call\r\nto be up and doing in the service of her \"dear master,\" as in her\r\nletters of this time she constantly named Sidney Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers had at first been somewhat grudging in their obituary\r\nnotices of him. He had been thought of in connection more with the\r\ndefects of the War Office during the early months of the Crimean War,\r\nthan with his services as a reformer. His family and his friends were\r\npained, and on their behalf Mr. Gladstone applied to Miss Nightingale.\r\nShe did not feel well enough to see him, and, on August 6, he wrote\r\nexplaining the case, \"taking the liberty of intruding upon her for aid\r\nand counsel,\" and asking \"the assistance of her superior knowledge and\r\njudgment in a matter which so much interests our feelings.\" Miss\r\nNightingale instantly set to work and wrote a Memorandum on Sidney\r\nHerbert's work as an Army Reformer. She wrote quickly, but with her\r\nusual care in giving chapter and verse for every statement. The\r\nMemorandum was anonymous, and was marked \"Private and Confidential\"; but\r\nshe had it printed, and circulated it among Lord Herbert's friends and\r\nvarious publicists. Among those who saw it was Abraham Hayward who, when\r\na memorial to Lord Herbert was being mooted a few weeks later, strongly\r\nurged that she should be asked to publish the Paper. \"No one,\" he wrote,\r\n\"could or would misconstrue her motives. Nothing has been more\r\nremarkable in her beneficent and self-sacrificing career than its\r\nunobtrusiveness. It has only become famous because its results were too\r\ngreat and good to be shrouded in silence and retirement. Admirably as\r\nshe writes, she is obviously never thinking about her style; which, for\r\nthat very reason, is most impressive; and I feel quite sure that the\r\nPaper in question would suggest no thought or feeling beyond conviction\r\nand sympathy.\"[294]\r\n\r\n  [294] Letter (Nov. 20) to Count Strzelechi, for whom see below, p. 410.\r\n\r\nThe Memorandum, in so far as it relates to what Sidney Herbert did, has\r\nbeen described and quoted above; but at the end of it, Miss Nightingale\r\nwas careful to touch upon what he had meant to do and what remained for\r\nothers to do. \"He died before his work was done.\" The work on which his\r\nheart was set was the preservation of the health, physical and moral, of\r\nthe British soldiers. \"This is the work of his which ought to bear fruit\r\nin all future time, and which his death has committed to the\r\nguardianship of his country.\"\r\n\r\nHaving finished her Memorandum, Miss Nightingale sent it to Mr.\r\nGladstone. She knew how warm had been the friendship between him and\r\nSidney Herbert. She thought that in the friend who remained the saying\r\nmight perchance come true: _uno avulso non deficit alter_. At any rate\r\nit was her duty to throw out the hint. So she underlined, as it were,\r\nthe closing words of her Paper by offering to talk with Mr. Gladstone\r\nabout the unfinished work which, as she knew, was nearest to Sidney\r\nHerbert's heart. To this overture, Mr. Gladstone replied in a letter,\r\ngiving account of his friend's funeral:\r\n\r\n     (_W. E. Gladstone to Florence Nightingale._) 11 CARLTON HOUSE\r\n     TERRACE, _Aug._ 10 [1861]. The funeral was very sad but very\r\n     soothing. Simplicity itself in point of form, it was most\r\n     remarkable from the number of people gathered together, and\r\n     especially from their demeanour. Many _men_ were weeping: not one\r\n     unconcerned face among several thousands could be seen. But it all\r\n     brings home more and more the immense void that he has left for all\r\n     who loved, that is for all who knew, him.... I read last night with\r\n     profound interest your important paper. I see at once that the\r\n     matter is too high for me to handle. Like you I know that too much\r\n     would distress him, too little would not. I am in truth ignorant of\r\n     military administration: and my impressions are distant and vague.\r\n     It is your knowledge and authority more than that of any living\r\n     creature that can do him justice, at the proper time, whenever that\r\n     may be--do him justice, as he would like it, without exaggeration,\r\n     without defrauding others. I shall return the paper to you: but of\r\n     it I venture to keep a copy....\r\n\r\n     With respect to your making known to me the \"three subjects\" I will\r\n     beg you to exercise your own discretion after simply saying this\r\n     much; my duty is to watch and control on the part of the Treasury\r\n     rather than to promote officially departmental reforms. To him I\r\n     could personally suggest: I am not sure that I should be justified\r\n     in taking the same liberty with Sir G. Lewis, especially new to his\r\n     work. On the other hand, my desire to promote Herbert's wishes, as\r\n     his wishes, was not stronger than my confidence in his judgment as\r\n     an administrator. (If I now seem reluctant to touch that subject it\r\n     is for fear I should spoil it.) In the conduct of a department he\r\n     seemed to me very nearly if not quite the first of his\r\n     generation.--I remain, dear Miss Nightingale, Very sincerely yours,\r\n     W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of November 28, in Willis's Rooms--in the same place\r\nwhere, in the same month six years before, Mr. Herbert had spoken in\r\nsupport of a memorial to Miss Nightingale's honour, a public meeting was\r\nheld to promote a memorial to him. \"I think you would have been\r\nsatisfied,\" wrote Mr. Gladstone to her on the same evening, \"even if a\r\nfastidious judge, with the tone and feeling of the meeting to-day. I\r\nmean as regards Herbert. As respects yourself, you might have cared\r\nlittle, but could not have been otherwise than pleased. I made no\r\nallusion to you in connection with the paper you kindly sent me,\r\nalthough I made some use of the materials. I acted thus after conference\r\nwith Count Strzelechi,[295] and with his approval. I thought that if I\r\nmentioned you along with that paper, I should seem guilty of the\r\nassumption to constitute myself your organ.\" Miss Nightingale's Paper,\r\nsummarizing Lord Herbert's services to the health and comfort of the\r\nBritish Army, formed, indeed, the staple of more than one of the\r\nspeeches,[296] and the long alliance between them in that cause, which\r\nhas been the subject of preceding chapters in this Memoir, was\r\nfrequently referred to at the meeting. General Sir John Burgoyne said\r\nbreezily that Lord Herbert's \"hobby was to promote the health and\r\ncomfort of the soldier, and his pet was Miss Nightingale, who had for\r\nmany years devoted herself to the same pursuit.\" Mr. Gladstone mentioned\r\nas Lord Herbert's \"fellow-labourer\" the \"name of Miss Nightingale, a\r\nname that had become a talisman to all her fellow-countrymen.\" And Lord\r\nPalmerston, the Prime Minister, in associating the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwith the late Minister for War, added that \"they did not labour alone.\r\nThey were not the only two; there was a third engaged in those\r\nhonourable exertions, and Miss Nightingale, though a volunteer in the\r\nservice, acted with all the zeal of a volunteer, and was greatly\r\nassistant, as I am sure your Royal Highness will bear witness, to the\r\nlabours of your Royal Highness and Lord Herbert.\"\r\n\r\n  [295] Sir Paul Edmund de Strzelechi, K.C.M.G., C.B., known as Count\r\n        Strzelechi, Australian explorer, of Polish descent, though a\r\n        naturalized Englishman, was a great friend of Lord and Lady\r\n        Herbert, whom he had accompanied on their last journey abroad.\r\n        He took a prominent part in organizing the Herbert Memorial.\r\n\r\n  [296] They are collected in a pamphlet (August 1867) entitled _Memorial\r\n        to the Late Lord Herbert_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe alliance which was dissolved by Lord Herbert's death is probably\r\nunique in the history of politics and of friendship. \"As for his\r\nfriendship and mine,\" said Miss Nightingale, \"I doubt whether the same\r\ncould ever occur again.\"[297] For five years the politician in the\r\npublic eye, and this woman behind the scenes, were in active\r\nco-operation; often seeing each other daily, at all times in\r\nuninterrupted communication. There have been other instances in which\r\nthe same thing has happened, but happened with many differences. There\r\nhave been statesmen who have made confidantes of their wives, and who\r\nhave found in them wise counsellors and helpful supporters. Sidney\r\nHerbert himself received much help in his public work from his wife, to\r\nwhom he was devotedly attached. In some pencilled jottings about her\r\nfriends, Miss Nightingale records a beautiful trait; Sidney Herbert made\r\nit a rule, she says, to mark each anniversary of his wedding-day by\r\nbeginning some new work of kindness towards others. Yet there was room\r\nin the ordering of his life, during the five years following the Crimean\r\nWar, for taking constant counsel from another woman--so constant as,\r\nperhaps, in the days of his illness and over-work to cause his wife some\r\nanxiety. Yet Miss Nightingale was as dear to the wife as she was helpful\r\nto the husband, and affectionate friendship between her and Mrs. Herbert\r\nwas not impaired. There have been many statesmen, again, and many other\r\neminent men, who have found inspiration or support, no less than solace\r\nor pleasure, in the friendship of women. But Sidney Herbert's attraction\r\nto Miss Nightingale, and hers to him, were on a plane by themselves.\r\nShe, indeed, was susceptible, as was every man and every woman who knew\r\nhim, to Sidney Herbert's singular charm and courtesy; she admired the\r\nbrilliance of his conversation; she felt pleasure in his presence. And\r\nhe, with his quick perception, must have enjoyed the ready humour which\r\nplayed around Miss Nightingale's wisdom. But they were also comrades or\r\ncolleagues even as men are. \"A woman once told me,\" Miss Nightingale\r\nsaid to an old friend, \"that my character would be more sympathized with\r\nby men than by women. In one sense I don't choose to have that said.\r\nSidney Herbert and I were together exactly like two men--exactly like\r\nhim and Gladstone.\"[298]\r\n\r\n  [297] Letter to Harriet Martineau, September 24, 1861.\r\n\r\n  [298] Letter to Madame Mohl, Dec. 13, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe secret of this rare friendship between Sidney Herbert and Miss\r\nNightingale is to be found, first, in the fact that the character and\r\ngifts of the one were precisely complementary to those of the other.\r\nThough of a sanguine temperament, Sidney Herbert had the politician's\r\ncaution. Miss Nightingale, though of an eminently practical genius, was\r\neager and full of impelling force. She supplied inspiration which he had\r\nthe means of translating into political action. Sidney Herbert had the\r\npolitical mind; Miss Nightingale, the administrative. Not indeed that he\r\nwas deficient in some of the administrative gifts, or she in political\r\ninstinct. But what was peculiarly characteristic of her was the\r\ncombination of a firm grasp of general principles with a complete\r\ncommand of detail; and in the particular work in which they were\r\nengaged, her experience supplied what he lacked. \"I supplied the\r\ndetail,\" she said herself; \"the knowledge of the actual working of an\r\narmy, in which official men are so deficient; he supplied the political\r\nweight.\"[299] Each was thus indispensable to the other. And they were\r\nunited by perfect sympathy in the service of high ideals. \"He,\" wrote\r\nMiss Nightingale of Sidney Herbert, \"with every possession which God\r\ncould bestow to make him idly enjoy life, yet ran like a race-horse his\r\nnoble course, till he fell--and up to the very day fortnight of his\r\ndeath struggled on doing good, not for the love of power or place (he\r\ndid not care for it), but for the love of mankind and of God.\"[300] He\r\nwas, \"in the best sense,\" she wrote elsewhere, \"a saver of men.\"[301] In\r\nthat honourable record Miss Nightingale deserves an equal place with her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n  [299] Letter to Harriet Martineau, Sept. 24, 1861.\r\n\r\n  [300] _Dublin_ (Bibliography A., No. 28), p. 8.\r\n\r\n  [301] _Herbert_ (Bibliography A., No. 29), p. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PART IV\r\n\r\n                           HOSPITALS AND NURSING\r\n\r\n                                (1858-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n     The everyday management of a large ward, let alone of a hospital,\r\n     the knowing what are the laws of life and death for men, and what\r\n     the laws of health for wards (and wards are healthy or unhealthy\r\n     mainly according to the knowledge or ignorance of the nurse), are\r\n     not these matters of sufficient importance and difficulty to\r\n     require learning by experience and careful inquiry, just as much as\r\n     any other art?--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE: _Notes on Nursing_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                           THE HOSPITAL REFORMER\r\n\r\n                                (1858-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n     It may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first\r\n     requirement in a Hospital that it should do the sick no harm. It is\r\n     quite necessary, nevertheless, to lay down such a principle,\r\n     because the actual mortality _in_ hospitals, especially in those of\r\n     large crowded cities, is very much higher than any calculation\r\n     founded on the mortality of the same class of diseases among\r\n     patients treated _out of_ hospitals would lead us to\r\n     expect.--FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE (1863).\r\n\r\nThe work for the health of the soldiers, which has been described in the\r\npreceding Part, filled the larger part of Miss Nightingale's life during\r\nthe five years after her return from the Crimean War; and in 1856, 1857,\r\n1858 it occupied nearly the whole of her time. The work lasted for\r\nalmost exactly five years, from the day of her return from Scutari\r\n(August 1856) to the day of Lord Herbert's death (August 1861). But into\r\nthose strenuous years Miss Nightingale had crowded much other work\r\nbesides. It has been necessary, for the sake of clearness and coherence,\r\nto treat the subject of Army sanitary reform consecutively in a single\r\nPart. In the present Part the other main occupations of Miss\r\nNightingale's life during the same period, and more especially during\r\nthe years 1859, 1860, and 1861, will be described.\r\n\r\nThe story of her life and work may be divided for convenience into\r\nseparate Parts; but in her own mind each of the branches of effort into\r\nwhich successively she threw herself were connected parts of a larger\r\nwhole. Her experiences in the Crimean War, and the emotions which grew\r\nout of them, had caused her to throw her first efforts into the cause of\r\nreform in the interest of her \"children,\" the British soldiers. But all\r\nthe time she saw with entire clearness that the health of the Army was\r\nonly part of a larger question; namely, the health of the whole\r\npopulation from which the soldiers are drawn. She had made her\r\nreputation by work in military hospitals, and her first effort was to\r\nimprove them, but she saw that the condition of civil hospitals was the\r\nlarger and the more important matter. And she saw further still that\r\nhospitals are at best only a necessary evil; a necessity, as some one\r\nhas said, in an intermediate stage of civilization. The secret of\r\nnational health is to be found in the homes of the people. If in a\r\nparticular town or quarter, for instance, there was excessive infant\r\nmortality, the remedy, as she said, was not to be found in building more\r\nchildren's hospitals there. She was famous throughout the world as a\r\nwar-nurse; but she knew that the difficulties which she had encountered\r\nin that sphere were due to the fact that the art of nursing was so ill\r\nunderstood at home. Her vision took wider scope, and her efforts to\r\nimprove the well-being of the people embraced, as we shall hear, both\r\nIndia and the Colonies. Mr. Disraeli, in a famous speech[302] delivered\r\nthe saying _Sanitas sanitatum, omnia Sanitas_, but that was in 1864; it\r\nwas Miss Nightingale's motto many years before. When the extent of her\r\nrange and the depth of her influence are considered, the claim made for\r\nher by an American writer will not seem exaggerated: she was \"the\r\nforemost sanitarian of her age.\"[303] Our immediate concern is with her\r\nlife and work, first, as a Hospital Reformer (Chaps. I., II.), and then\r\nas the founder of Modern Nursing (Chaps. III., IV.).\r\n\r\n  [302] At Aylesbury, Sept. 21, 1864.\r\n\r\n  [303] _Nutting_, vol. ii. pp. 207-8.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's authority on the subject of Hospitals ruled paramount\r\nin the years following the Crimean War--as the reference of the Netley\r\nplans to her has already indicated. Popularity and prestige were\r\nconfirmed by a practical experience which at the time was probably\r\nunique. \"Have you,\" she was asked by the Royal Commission of 1857,\r\n\"devoted attention to the organization of civil and military hospitals?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"for thirteen years. I have visited all the\r\nhospitals in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh, many county hospitals, some\r\nof the naval and military hospitals in England; all the hospitals in\r\nParis, and studied with the 's[oe]urs de charité'; the Institution of\r\nProtestant Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth, on the Rhine, where I was twice\r\nin training as a nurse; the hospitals at Berlin, and many others in\r\nGermany, at Lyons, Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople, Brussels; also the\r\nwar hospitals of the French and Sardinians.\" Her authority on the\r\nsubject was strengthened yet more when her Papers, already\r\nmentioned,[304] which were read at Liverpool in October 1858, were,\r\nearly in the following year, published, with additional matter, as a\r\nbook. \"It appears to me,\" wrote Sir James Paget, in acknowledging a copy\r\nof the book, _Notes on Hospitals_, \"to be the most valuable contribution\r\nto sanitary science in application to medical institutions that I have\r\never read.\" The book has not been reprinted since 1863, and is now,\r\nperhaps, forgotten; but, if so, that is the necessary fate of many a\r\nnotable book. The pioneers of one generation are forgotten when their\r\nwork has passed into the accepted doctrine and practice of another. In\r\nits day Miss Nightingale's _Notes on Hospitals_ revolutionized many\r\nideas, and gave a new direction to hospital construction.\r\n\r\n  [304] Above, p. 383.\r\n\r\nSir James Paget's words accurately suggest the nature of Miss\r\nNightingale's work in this field. Before she wrote, there was sad need\r\nof the application of sanitary science to many of our hospitals. The\r\nrate of mortality in them was terribly high. Hospitals created almost as\r\nmany diseases as they cured; there was hospital gangrene, hospital\r\npyæmia, hospital erysipelas, hospital fever, and so forth. It was even\r\nquestioned whether great hospitals were not, and must not necessarily\r\nbe, producers of disease. Miss Nightingale showed that there was no such\r\nnecessity. By the light of sanitary science, she traced back the\r\nexcessive mortality in hospitals to its true causes, in original defects\r\nin the site, in the agglomeration of a large number of sick under the\r\nsame roof, in deficiency of space, deficiency of ventilation, deficiency\r\nof light. In a second section of her book, going more into detail, she\r\nenumerated \"Sixteen Sanitary Defects in the Construction of Hospital\r\nWards,\" adding to the statement of each defect precise suggestions of a\r\nremedy. She added a series of equally detailed hints on hospital\r\nconstruction, illustrating them by careful plans, exterior and interior,\r\nof some of the best modern hospitals and of the worst old ones. Some of\r\nmy readers may be acquainted only with modern hospitals, and it will be\r\nwell perhaps to describe the defects in the old style of hospital. Many\r\nof the hospitals and infirmaries, as they existed when Miss Nightingale\r\nstarted her crusade, had been built with no consideration for the\r\nsub-soil, and the drainage of them was very imperfect. The wards were\r\nsadly overcrowded, often as much as three or four times over, tried by\r\nthe present standard of the number of cubic feet desirable per bed.\r\nVentilation was defective. The wards were often low. There were\r\nfrequently more than two beds between the windows. Little attention had\r\nbeen given to the supreme importance of having floors, walls, and\r\nceilings which were non-absorbent. The furniture of the wards, and the\r\nutensils, were such as would be condemned to-day as hopelessly\r\ninsanitary. Miss Nightingale found it necessary to enter in some detail\r\nupon the desirability of _iron_ bedsteads, _hair_ mattresses, and\r\n_glass_ or _earthenware_ cups, etc. (instead of tin); as also upon that\r\nof sanitary forethought in the construction of sinks and other places.\r\nHospital kitchens and laundries at home were not quite so bad as at\r\nScutari; but many of the kitchens were still very primitive, and many of\r\nthe laundries inspected by Miss Nightingale were \"small, dark, wet,\r\nunventilated, overcrowded, so full of steam loaded with organic matter\r\nthat it is hardly possible to see across the room.\" All this is now, for\r\nthe most part, a thing of the past; and the passing of it is due, in\r\nlarge measure, to Miss Nightingale. Coinciding, as her book did, with a\r\nmovement for increased hospital accommodation, and coming with the\r\nprestige of a popular heroine, her _Notes on Hospitals_ opened a new era\r\nin hospital reform. There had, it is true, been improvement before her\r\ntime; and she was not the one and only discoverer of the simple\r\nprinciples which she enunciated, and which are now the A B C of the\r\nsubject. But the general level of thought or practice does not always\r\nrise to the height of the better opinion; it depends too often upon the\r\naverage opinion of the day. Moreover, in some matters, there was, at the\r\ntime when she wrote, a conflict of principles, in which the victory was\r\ngenerally given to the wrong side. The beneficial effect of fresh air\r\nwas not always denied; but the advantage of securing warmth by shutting\r\nthe windows, and relying upon artificial methods of ventilation, was in\r\npractice considered paramount. Miss Nightingale was a pioneer in the\r\nconsistent emphasis which she gave to the supreme necessity of fresh\r\nair, and to the importance of \"direct sunlight, not only daylight,\r\nexcept perhaps in certain ophthalmic and a small number of other cases.\"\r\nShe based her contention in these matters on scientific principles; she\r\nsupported it from her experience and observation in the Crimean War and\r\nin foreign hospitals. In many quarters her ideas were new and\r\nrevolutionary. We have heard already what \"a bitter pill\" it was to one\r\neminent medical official of her day to swallow the idea of \"pavilions\"\r\nin hospital construction.[305] Lord Palmerston explained in the House of\r\nCommons in 1858 that, \"strange as it might appear, considering the\r\nprogress of science in every department, it was only within a few years\r\nthat mankind has found out that oxygen and pure air were conducive to\r\nthe well-being of the body.\"[306] And in the matter of the curative\r\neffect of light, Miss Nightingale cited from an official publication the\r\ncase of a well-known London physician, who \"whenever he enters a\r\nsick-room, takes care that the bed shall be turned away from the light.\"\r\n\"An acquaintance of ours,\" she added, \"passing a barrack one day, saw\r\nthe windows on the sunny side boarded up in a fashion peculiar to\r\nprisons and penitentiaries. He said to a friend who accompanied him, 'I\r\nwas not aware that you had a penitentiary in this neighbourhood.' 'Oh,'\r\nsaid he, 'it is not a penitentiary, it is a military hospital.'\"[307]\r\nMiss Nightingale's general principles commanded the hearty support of\r\nthe better medical opinion, and to many medical men her details, drawn\r\nfrom observation in the best foreign hospitals, afforded new and useful\r\nhints; while at the same time she commanded in a singular degree the ear\r\nof the general public, including town councillors, guardians, and\r\nbenevolent persons. It was in this way that her book did so much to\r\nimprove the level of hospital construction and hospital arrangement in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n  [305] Above, p. 342.\r\n\r\n  [306] Speech on Lord Ebrington's Resolutions, May 11, 1858.\r\n\r\n  [307] _Notes on Hospitals_, 1859, pp. 100, 108.\r\n\r\nUpon the construction of military hospitals--whether general or attached\r\nto particular barracks--Miss Nightingale was consulted constantly and as\r\na matter of course. In 1859, it will be remembered, Mr. Herbert became\r\nSecretary for War; and in 1860 Captain Galton was appointed temporary\r\nassistant inspector-general of \"Fortifications\"--a department which\r\nincluded works for barracks and hospitals. She respected Captain\r\nGalton's abilities, and liked him personally very much. He and Mr.\r\nHerbert took her advice upon all works within her province, and the\r\nplans of the new General Hospital at Woolwich in particular owed much to\r\nher suggestive ingenuity. She even drew up the heads of the\r\nspecifications for it. Even where she was not directly consulted or\r\nconcerned, her influence and the standard she had set up in her book had\r\nan effect. Medical officers and military governors sought leave to be\r\nable to quote her approval of hospitals under their charge. It would, as\r\none naïvely wrote to her, improve their chances of promotion.\r\n\r\nA more direct result of the publication of _Notes on Hospitals_ was to\r\nbring in upon Miss Nightingale copious requests for advice from the\r\ncommittees or officials of civic hospitals and infirmaries throughout\r\nthe country. To all such requests she readily responded. Writing was\r\nwith her a means to action; and when she was given any chance of\r\ntranslating \"Notes\" into deeds, no trouble was too great for her. She\r\nhad decided views of her own, but in particular cases she often\r\nconsulted other experts. Dr. Sutherland, one of the leading authorities\r\nin such matters, was, as we have seen, constantly with her. To her\r\nkinsman by marriage, Captain Galton, she frequently referred; and she\r\nsometimes engaged Sir Robert Rawlinson professionally to prepare plans\r\nand specifications for her to submit to those who asked her advice. He\r\non his part often consulted her in regard to hospitals and infirmaries\r\non which he had been called in to advise. Her advice was sought both by\r\nthose who were actually projecting new hospital buildings and by those\r\nwho were leading crusades for the reconstruction of their local\r\ninstitutions. Among her papers there is a mass of correspondence,\r\nspecifications, plans, memoranda of all sorts, referring to such\r\nmatters. Technical details are often relieved by touches of Miss\r\nNightingale's humour. Here are two examples from her letters to Captain\r\nGalton--(March 24, 1861): \"I understand that Baring[308] won't ventilate\r\nthe Barracks in summer because the grates are not hot enough in winter.\r\nWhy are the men to die of foul air in August because they are too cold\r\nat Christmas? I think Baring must be an army doctor.\" (June 20, 1861):\r\n\"Is the Architect's ideal the profile of a revolver pistol? If you look\r\nat the block plan in this point of view, it is very good. But as he asks\r\nmy opinion, it is that I would much rather be shot outside than in. As\r\nHospital principles are beginning to be well known, it would be quite\r\nenough to engrave this plan on the card of solicitation to stop all\r\nsubscriptions. No patient will ever get well there. And as I don't\r\napprove of the principle of Lock Hospitals, I had much better let it go\r\non.\" The correspondence about hospital plans ranges in place and scale\r\nfrom Glasgow, from which city she was asked to advise upon cement for\r\nthe walls of the Infirmary wards, to Lisbon, where a new institution was\r\nto be built according to her ideas. In 1859 the King of Portugal asked\r\nMiss Nightingale through the Prince Consort to advise and report upon\r\nthe plans for a hospital which he desired to build in memory of his\r\nwife, the Princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern. This affair occupied some\r\nof her attention during two years, and caused her not a little\r\nimpatience. With Dr. Sutherland's help, she went laboriously through the\r\nplans submitted by the King's architect on the assumption that the\r\nhospital was intended for adults. It then appeared that what the King\r\nwanted was a Children's Hospital. The Prince Consort, through Colonel\r\nPhipps, was deeply grieved at \"the waste of Miss Nightingale's time and\r\nof her strength, so precious.\" Dom Pedro V., taking an easier view, did\r\nnot see that it mattered. A hospital, constructed for adults, but\r\nintended for children, would, His Majesty pleasantly suggested, \"only\r\ngive the children more room and more air.\" The King had to be given a\r\nlesson in the niceties of hospital construction. The architect and Miss\r\nNightingale set to work again on amended plans. Her suggestions were\r\nwarmly approved, on the Prince Consort's behalf, by Sir James Clark, and\r\nDom Pedro sent her a cordial letter of thanks.\r\n\r\n  [308] Under-Secretary for War, when Mr. Herbert was made a Peer.\r\n\r\nAt home she took similar pains with plans for the Bucks County Infirmary\r\nat Aylesbury; but here it was easier sailing, for the chairman of the\r\nCommittee was her brother-in-law, Sir Harry Verney, and it was promptly\r\ndecided (1860) to rebuild the Infirmary \"in accordance with the\r\nrequirements specified in Miss Nightingale's _Notes on Hospitals_.\" In\r\nanother county hospital, that at Winchester, she took the more interest,\r\nbecause one of her father's properties (Embley) was in the county. There\r\nis a specially voluminous correspondence on the subject, largely with\r\nSir William Heathcote (chairman of the Governors),[309] extending over\r\nseveral years. The old hospital was admittedly bad, but the first idea\r\nwas to patch it up. Miss Nightingale took infinite pains in working up\r\nthe case against this course. She studied the report which Sir Robert\r\nRawlinson, the sanitary engineer, had sent in; and she tabulated the\r\nstatistics of mortality, comparing them with those of well-appointed\r\nhospitals on healthy sites. Thus armed, she told the Committee roundly\r\nthat they were proposing to sink money in patching up a \"pest-house,\r\nwhere a number of people are exposed to the risk of fatal illness from a\r\nspecial hospital disease.\" Was Hampshire eager, she asked, to emulate\r\nthe evil fame of Scutari? Then she tackled the financial problem. She\r\ncompared the estimated cost of \"adaptation\" with that of building a new\r\nhospital on a better site. She submitted plans and details of her\r\nestimate. She promised the advice of Dr. Sutherland in the choice of a\r\nnew site. \"I understand,\" she wrote, \"that Lord Ashburton will give\r\n£1000 towards a new hospital, if built upon a new site; if not,\r\nnothing.\" As Lady Ashburton was one of her dearest friends, this\r\ncondition was probably not unprompted. On the same condition, she\r\npromised contributions from herself and her father. She collected and\r\nsent in the opinions of eminent experts--civil engineers and medical\r\nofficers--on the question. She prodded friends possessing local\r\ninfluence: \"Would you please,\" she wrote to Captain Galton (Feb. 10,\r\n1861), \"devote the first day of every week until further notice in\r\ndriving nails into Jack Bonham Carter,[310] M.P., about the Winchester\r\nInfirmary?\" In the end she carried her point, and a new hospital was\r\nbuilt by Mr. Butterfield on a higher and healthier site. \"It is the\r\ngreatest pleasure,\" the architect wrote to her (Dec. 1863), \"to try and\r\nwork out the views of one who is ably and earnestly endeavouring to make\r\na reformation.\" Among other institutions upon which she advised, in this\r\n(1860) or immediately ensuing years, were the Birkenhead Hospital, the\r\nChorlton Union Infirmary, the Coventry Hospital, the Guildford (Surrey\r\nCounty) Hospital, the Leeds Infirmary, the Malta (Incurables) Hospital,\r\nthe Putney Royal Hospital for Incurables, the North Staffordshire\r\nInfirmary, and the Swansea Infirmary. Correspondence from foreign\r\ncountries, and a collection of tracts upon Hospital Construction (1863)\r\nsent to her from France and Belgium, show that the \"reformation\" was\r\nwidespread. In India also her book was found useful. \"It arrived in the\r\nnick of time,\" wrote Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Governor of Madras (Aug.\r\n10, 1859), \"as you will see by the accompanying note from Major Horsley,\r\nthe engineer entrusted with the preparation of the plan of the addition\r\nto our General Hospital.\"\r\n\r\n  [309] Mr. Nightingale bought Embley from the Heathcote family.\r\n\r\n  [310] Eldest son of the John Bonham Carter mentioned above (p. 29); M.P.\r\n        for Winchester; first cousin of Miss Nightingale and of Mrs.\r\n        Galton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nLike other reformers, Miss Nightingale encountered an occasional defeat.\r\nOne was at Manchester in a cause wherein she was enlisted by a friend of\r\nCobden, Mr. Joseph Adshead. He saw something of Miss Nightingale during\r\nthese years, and corresponded voluminously with her. He is the subject\r\nof one of her clever and vivid character-sketches--a sketch which throws\r\ninteresting side-lights on her own character too:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Samuel Smith._) BURLINGTON, _Feb._ 25,\r\n     [1861]. DEAR UNCLE SAM--Adshead of Manchester is dead--my best\r\n     pupil.... How often I have called him my \"dear old Addle-head,\" and\r\n     now he is dead. He was a man who could hardly write or speak the\r\n     Queen's English; I believe he raised himself, and was now a kind of\r\n     manufacturer's agent in Manchester. He was a man of very ordinary\r\n     abilities and commonplace appearance--vulgar, but never\r\n     unbusiness-like, which is, I think, the worst kind of vulgarity.\r\n     Having made \"a competency,\" he did not give up business, but\r\n     devoted himself to good works for Manchester. And there is scarcely\r\n     a good thing in Manchester, of which he has not been the\r\n     main-stay or the source--schools, infirmary, paving and draining,\r\n     water-supply, etc., etc. At 60, he takes up an entirely new subject,\r\n     Hospital Construction, fired by my book, and determines to master it.\r\n     This is what I think is peculiarly Anglo-Saxon. He writes to me\r\n     whether I will teach him (this is about 18 months ago), and composes\r\n     some plans for a Convalescent Hospital _out of_ Manchester, to become\r\n     their main Hospital if the wind is favourable. He comes up to London\r\n     to see me about these. The working plans passed eight times thro' my\r\n     hands and gave me more trouble than anything I ever did. Because\r\n     Adshead would not employ a proper builder, but would do them himself--\r\n     which is part of the same character, I believe. The plans are now\r\n     quite ready, but nothing more. He meant to _beg in person_ all over\r\n     Lancashire, and had already some promises of large sums. He had been\r\n     asking for about a year, but never intermitted anything. I don't know\r\n     whether you remember that I had a three-months' correspondence with\r\n     him (and oh! the immense trouble he took) about the transplantation of\r\n     the Spitalfields and Coventry weavers to Manchester, Preston,\r\n     Burnley, etc.[311] ... It never came to anything.... He was 61 when\r\n     he died. This is the character which I believe is quite peculiar to\r\n     our race--a man, a common tradesman, who--instead of \"retiring from\r\n     the world\" to \"make his salvation,\" or giving himself up to science\r\n     or to his family in his old age, or founding an Order, or building\r\n     a housewill patiently (at 60) learn new dodges and new-fangled\r\n     ideas in order to benefit his native city.... How I do feel that it\r\n     is the strength of our country and worth all the R. Catholic\r\n     \"Orders\" put together. I hate an \"Order,\" and am so glad I was\r\n     never \"let in\" to form one....\r\n\r\n  [311] Miss Sellon had called her attention to the sad plight through\r\n        unemployment of the Spitalfields weavers, as had Mr. and Mrs.\r\n        Bracebridge to that of those at Coventry. Miss Nightingale, with\r\n        help from Mr. Bracebridge, enlisted Mr. Adshead in a scheme for\r\n        migrating them to Lancashire. He and she took infinite pains in\r\n        the matter, but the scheme came to little. When it reached the\r\n        point, Miss Sellon's friends were not ready to go.\r\n\r\nMr. Adshead had taken a prominent part in a movement to get the\r\nManchester Royal Infirmary condemned as insanitary, and to rebuild it in\r\nbetter air outside the city boundaries. Miss Nightingale, though she did\r\nnot join publicly in the controversy, plied Mr. Adshead with powder and\r\nshot. But they were defeated. Manchester decided to patch and not to\r\nrebuild.\r\n\r\nIn the case of St. Thomas's Hospital in London, which was confronted\r\nfrom a different cause with the same choice, she was successful.\r\nHospital officials, when in difficulty, not infrequently \"went to Miss\r\nNightingale.\" This was the case with Mr. Whitfield, the Resident Medical\r\nOfficer of St. Thomas's (then on its ancient site in the Borough), when\r\nthe future of the Hospital was threatened by the projected extension of\r\nthe South-Eastern Railway from London Bridge to Charing Cross. The\r\nRailway Company sought powers to take some of the Hospital's land, and\r\nthe opinion of the Governors was likely to be divided on the policy to\r\nbe pursued. Mr. Whitfield was from the first in favour of the course\r\nwhich ultimately prevailed; the Railway Company should be compelled to\r\nbuy all the Hospital's land or none, and in the former event the\r\nHospital should be rebuilt on a healthier site and on an improved plan.\r\nBut there were others who were disposed to take the line of least\r\nresistance, and to be content with rebuilding on the old or an adjacent\r\nsite so much as the railway works made necessary. Mr. Whitfield opened\r\nthe case to Miss Nightingale in February 1859, and besought her aid; she\r\nentirely agreed with him, and threw herself whole-heartedly into the\r\nmatter. Among the Governors of the Hospital was the Prince Consort, to\r\nwhom she sent a careful memorandum. The Prince went into the case with\r\nhis usual thoroughness, and ultimately concurred in Miss Nightingale's\r\nviews. He was scrupulous, as the correspondence shows, to avoid any\r\ninterference with the parliamentary side of the case, but he let it be\r\nknown, among his colleagues on the Board of Governors, what his opinion\r\nwas upon the best policy for the Hospital to pursue, in the event of\r\nParliament leaving it any option. \"Your intervention with Prince\r\nAlbert,\" wrote Mr. Whitfield presently to Miss Nightingale, \"has wrought\r\nwonders.\" But there were still two opinions. There was a strong party\r\nwhich attached more importance to retaining the Hospital on its old\r\nsite, \"in the midst of the people whom it served,\" than to removing it\r\nto one which might be more salubrious, but must be more distant. This is\r\na controversy which continually recurs. Miss Nightingale took immense\r\npains in working up the case for removal. She resorted, as usual, to a\r\nstatistical method. She analysed the place of origin of all the cases\r\nreceived; tabulated the percentages in various radii; and showed that\r\nthe removal of the hospital to such and such distances would affect a\r\nfar smaller percentage of patients than was commonly supposed. Then she\r\nmade out sums in proportion, setting, on the one side, so much\r\ninconvenience and conceivable danger in making a smaller number of\r\npatients take a little longer time in reaching the Hospital; and, on the\r\nother, the greater convenience and larger chance of recovery which all\r\nthe patients alike would have in better surroundings. At the end of 1860\r\nthe critical moment arrived. The Railway Company had served the Hospital\r\nwith notice to decide within twenty-one days. Mr. Whitfield wrote to\r\nMiss Nightingale in a state of considerable flurry. He was by no means\r\ncertain how the voting would go; every vote and every influence were\r\nimportant; could she not whisper once more in the Prince Consort's ear?\r\nShe wrote to the Palace forthwith; and the Prince communicated his views\r\nto the Court of Governors on her side. And not only on her side. \"You\r\nwill find in the Prince's letter,\" she was told by one of those behind\r\nthe scenes, \"your own arguments and sometimes even your own words\r\nembodied.\" Ultimately the Governors decided as Miss Nightingale wished.\r\nThe Railway Company was required to take all or none of the Hospital's\r\nland. It took all and, as usually happens in railway cases, the price\r\nwas not suffered to err on the side of moderation. St. Thomas's Hospital\r\nwas removed to temporary buildings on the old Surrey Gardens, and there\r\nremained till the present Hospital was completed in 1871.\r\n\r\nA fair American visitor, taking tea upon the terrace of the Houses of\r\nParliament, and looking across the river to the sevenfold splendours\r\nopposite, is said to have inquired, \"Are those the mansions of your\r\naristocracy?\" They are only instances of the reform which Miss\r\nNightingale introduced in Hospital construction, being the \"pavilions\"\r\nof St. Thomas's. But Miss Nightingale was never consulted, I feel sure,\r\nupon the architectural ornament of the parapets. Her sense of humour\r\nwould have made short work of the urns which, as some one has suggested,\r\nseem waiting for the ashes of the patients inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                        THE PASSIONATE STATISTICIAN\r\n\r\n                                (1859-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Full and minute statistical details are to the lawgiver, as the\r\n     chart, the compass, and the lead to the navigator.--LORD BROUGHAM.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing the first Lord Goschen make a speech in Whitechapel\r\nmany years ago, in which he avowed that for his part he was \"a\r\npassionate statistician.\" \"Go with me,\" he said, \"into the study of\r\nstatistics, and I will make you all enthusiasts in statistics.\" Mr.\r\n_Punch_ parodied Marlowe thereupon, and invited his readers to \"all the\r\npleasures prove That facts and figures can supply Unto the Statist's\r\nravished eye.\" I do not know whether any large response to the\r\ninvitation was forthcoming from Lord Goschen's hearers or Mr. _Punch's_\r\nreaders; though, since the day when Lord Goschen spoke, social reformers\r\nhave more and more guided their schemes by the chart and compass of\r\nstatistics. If Miss Nightingale saw the speech, it fell upon eyes long\r\nago opened. A fondness for statistical method, a belief in its almost\r\nillimitable efficacy, was one of her marked characteristics.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew books made a greater impression on Miss Nightingale than those of\r\nAdolphe Quetelet, the Belgian astronomer, meteorologist, and\r\nstatistician; and she had few friends whom she valued more highly than\r\nDr. William Farr, the leading statistician of her day in this country.\r\nFrom his meteorological studies, Quetelet deduced a law of the flowering\r\nof plants. One of his cases was the lilac. The common lilac flowers,\r\naccording to Quetelet's law, when the sum of the squares of the mean\r\ndaily temperatures, counted from the end of the frosts, equals 4264°\r\n_centigrade_. Miss Nightingale was greatly interested in such\r\ncalculations, and the lilac had a special place in her year. Lady\r\nVerney's birthday was April 19, and a branch of flowering lilac was\r\nFlorence's regular birthday present to her sister. Miss Nightingale used\r\nto talk of Quetelet's law with great delight, and commended it to\r\ngardening friends for verification in their Naturalist's Diaries. But\r\nthis is a lighter example of Quetelet's researches. What fascinated Miss\r\nNightingale most was his _Essai de physique sociale_ (first published in\r\n1835), in which he showed the possibility of applying the statistical\r\nmethod to social dynamics, and deduced from such method various\r\nconclusions with regard to the physical and intellectual qualities of\r\nman. In regard to sanitation, we have heard already of the reforms which\r\nMiss Nightingale was instrumental in carrying out in Army Medical\r\nStatistics. She turned next to the question of Hospital Statistics,\r\nwhere improvement seemed desirable both for the surer advance of medical\r\nknowledge and in the interests of good administration.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had been painfully impressed during the Crimean War\r\nwith the statistical carelessness which prevailed in the military\r\nhospitals. Even the number of deaths was not accurately recorded. \"At\r\nScutari,\" she said, \"three separate registers were kept. First, the\r\nAdjutant's daily Head-roll of soldiers' burials, on which it may be\r\npresumed no one was entered who was not buried, although it is possible\r\nthat some may have been buried who were not entered. Second, the Medical\r\nOfficers' Return, in regard to which it is quite certain that hundreds\r\nof men were buried who never appeared upon it. Third, the return made in\r\nthe Orderly Room, which is only remarkable as giving a totally different\r\naccount of the deaths from either of the others.\"[312] When Miss\r\nNightingale came home, and began examining Hospital Statistics in\r\nLondon, she found, not indeed such glaring carelessness as this, but a\r\ncomplete lack of scientific co-ordination. The statistics of hospitals\r\nwere kept on no uniform plan. Each hospital followed its own\r\nnomenclature and classification of diseases. There had been no reduction\r\non any uniform model of the vast amount of observations which had been\r\nmade. \"So far as relates,\" she said, \"either to medical or to sanitary\r\nscience, these observations in their present state bear exactly the same\r\nrelation as an indefinite number of astronomical observations made\r\nwithout concert, and reduced to no common standard, would bear to the\r\nprogress of astronomy.\"[313]\r\n\r\n  [312] _A Contribution_, p. 3 (Bibliography A, No. 14).\r\n\r\n  [313] _Hospital Statistics_ (Bibliography A, No. 28).\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale set herself to remedy this defect. With assistance from\r\nfriendly doctors on the medical side, and of Dr. Farr, of the\r\nRegistrar-General's Office, on the statistical, she prepared (1) a\r\nstandard list, under various Classes and Orders, of diseases, and (2)\r\nmodel Hospital Statistical Forms. The general adoption of her Forms\r\nwould, as she wrote, \"enable us to ascertain the relative mortality in\r\ndifferent hospitals, as well as of different diseases and injuries at\r\nthe same and at different ages, the relative frequency of different\r\ndiseases and injuries among the classes which enter hospitals in\r\ndifferent countries, and in different districts of the same countries.\"\r\nThen, again, the relation of the duration of cases to the general\r\nutility of a hospital had never been shown. Miss Nightingale's proposed\r\nforms \"would enable the mortality in hospitals, and also the mortality\r\nfrom particular diseases, injuries, and operations, to be ascertained\r\nwith accuracy; and these facts, together with the duration of cases,\r\nwould enable the value of particular methods of treatment and of special\r\noperations to be brought to statistical proof. The sanitary state of the\r\nhospital itself could likewise be ascertained.\"[314] Having formed her\r\nplan, Miss Nightingale proceeded with her usual resourcefulness to\r\naction. She had her Model Forms printed (1859), and she persuaded some\r\nof the London hospitals to adopt them experimentally. Sir James Paget at\r\nSt. Bartholomew's was particularly helpful; St. Mary's, St. Thomas's,\r\nand University College also agreed to use the Forms. She and Dr. Farr\r\nstudied the results, which were sufficient to show how large a field for\r\nstatistical analysis and inquiry would be opened by the general adoption\r\nof her Forms.\r\n\r\n  [314] _Hospital Statistics_. Of course the statistics would have to be\r\n        interpreted.\r\n\r\nThe case was now ready for a further move. Dr. Farr was one of the\r\nGeneral Secretaries of the International Statistical Congress which was\r\nto meet in London in the summer of 1860. He and Miss Nightingale drew up\r\nthe programme for the Second Section of the Congress (Sanitary\r\nStatistics), and her scheme for Uniform Hospital Statistics was the\r\nprincipal subject of discussion. Her Model Forms were printed, with an\r\nexplanatory memorandum; the Section discussed and approved them, and a\r\nresolution was passed that her proposals should be communicated to all\r\nthe Governments represented at the Congress. She took a keen interest in\r\nall the proceedings, and gave a series of breakfast-parties, presided\r\nover by her cousin Hilary, to the delegates, some of whom were\r\nafterwards admitted to the presence of their hostess upstairs. The\r\nforeign delegates much appreciated this courtesy, as their spokesman\r\nsaid at the closing meeting of the Congress; \"all the world knows the\r\nname of Miss Nightingale,\" and it was an honour to be received by \"the\r\nillustrious invalid, the Providence of the English Army.\" The written\r\ninstructions sent by \"the Providence\" to her cousin for the\r\nentertainment of the guests show her care for little things and her\r\nknowledge of the weaknesses of great men: \"Take care that the cream for\r\nbreakfast is not turned.\" \"Put back Dr. X.'s big book where he can see\r\nit when drinking his tea.\" Miss Nightingale also induced her friend Mrs.\r\nHerbert to invite the statisticians to an evening party. The feast of\r\nstatistics acted upon her as a tonic. \"She has been more than usually\r\nill for the last four or five weeks,\" wrote her cousin Hilary (July 12);\r\n\"now I cannot help thinking that her strength is rallying a little; she\r\nis much interested in the Statistical Congress.\" Congresses, like wars,\r\nare sometimes \"muddled through\" by our country, and Miss Nightingale was\r\nable here and there to smooth ruffled plumes. A distinguished friend of\r\nhers, though his name had been printed as one of the secretaries of a\r\nSection, had not received so much as an intimation of the place of\r\nmeeting; he was disgusted at so unbusiness-like an omission, and was\r\nhalf inclined to sulk in his tents. Miss Nightingale's letter on the\r\nsubject is characteristic:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Dr. T. Graham Balfour._) 30 OLD BURLINGTON ST.,\r\n     _July_ 12 [1860]. You are quite right in what you say. We are\r\n     all of us in the same boat. And, if it were not that England _would\r\n     not be_ the mercantile nation she _is_, if she had not business\r\n     habits somewhere, I should wonder from my experience where they\r\n     are. Certain of us, who were asked to do business for the\r\n     Statistical Congress, had it all ready since December last--and\r\n     were not able to get it out of the Registrar-General's Office till\r\n     this week. Certain of us were asked to do business this morning,\r\n     and to have it ready by to-night, which, if _not_ done, would\r\n     arrest the proceedings of the Congress, and, _if_ done, must be the\r\n     fruit of only five hours' consideration, when five months might\r\n     just as well have been granted for it. I don't say that this is so\r\n     bad as the treatment of you who are Secretary. But still it is\r\n     provoking to see a great International business worked in this way.\r\n\r\n     What I want now is to put a good face upon it before the\r\n     foreigners. Let _them_ not see our short-comings and disunions. Many\r\n     countries, far behind us in political business, are far before us in\r\n     organization-power. If any one has ever been behind the scenes, living\r\n     in the interior, of the Maison Mère of the \"Sisters of Charity\" at\r\n     Paris, as I have--and seen their Counting House and Office, all worked\r\n     by women,--an Office which has twelve thousand Officials (all women)\r\n     scattered all over the known world--an office to compare with which,\r\n     in business habits, I have never seen any, either Government or\r\n     private, in England--they will think, like me, that it is this mere\r\n     business-power which keeps these enormous religious \"orders\" going.\r\n\r\n     I hope that you will try to impress these foreign Delegates, then,\r\n     with a sense of _our_ \"enormous business-power\" (in which I don't\r\n     believe one bit), and to keep the Congress going. Many thanks for\r\n     all your papers. I trust you will settle some sectional business\r\n     with the Delegates here to-morrow morning. And I trust I shall be\r\n     able to see you, if not to-morrow morning, soon.\r\n\r\n     Mind, I don't mean anything against _your_ Office by this tirade.\r\n     On the contrary, I believe it is one of the few efficient ones now\r\n     in existence.\r\n\r\nHaving received the _imprimatur_ of an International Congress, Miss\r\nNightingale circulated her paper on Hospital Statistics widely among\r\nmedical men and hospital officials. Thereby she produced immediate\r\neffect. She printed large quantities of her Model Forms, and supplied\r\nthem, on request, to hospitals in various parts of the country. Through\r\nthe good offices of M. Mohl, she also worked upon public opinion in\r\nFrance. \"Some months ago,\" she wrote to Dr. Farr (Oct. 20, 1860), \"I got\r\ninserted into the leading medical journals of Paris an article on the\r\nproposed Hospital Registers; and you see they are at work.\" The London\r\nHospitals took the matter up. Guy's printed a statistical analysis of\r\nits cases from 1854 to 1861; St. Thomas's, of its from 1857 to 1860; St.\r\nBartholomew's, a table of its cases for 1860. With regard to the future,\r\na meeting was held at Guy's Hospital on June 21, 1861, and it was\r\nunanimously agreed--by delegates from Guy's, St. Bartholomew's, St.\r\nThomas's, the London, St. George's, King's College, the Middlesex, and\r\nSt. Mary's--that the Metropolitan Hospitals should adopt one uniform\r\nsystem of Registration of Patients; that each hospital should publish\r\nits Statistics annually, and that Miss Nightingale's Model Forms should\r\nas far as possible be adopted. She called further attention to her\r\nscheme in a paper sent to the Social Science Congress at Dublin in\r\nAugust 1861,[315] and incorporated it in a later edition of her _Notes\r\non Hospitals_. The statistics of the various hospitals which had\r\naccepted her Forms were published in the _Journal of the Statistical\r\nSociety_ for September 1862, but I do not find that the experiment has\r\nbeen continued. So far from there being any uniform hospital statistics,\r\nof the kind contemplated by Miss Nightingale, even in London some of the\r\nhospitals do not keep, or at any rate do not publish, any at all. The\r\nlaboriousness, and therefore the costliness, of the work of compilation,\r\nthe difficulty of securing actual, as well as apparent, uniformity, and\r\na consequent doubt as to the value of conclusions deduced from the\r\nfigures are presumably among the causes which have defeated Miss\r\nNightingale's scheme. Some limited portion of her object is perhaps\r\nattained by the statistical data which the administration of King's\r\nHospital Fund demands, but even here there are possibilities of\r\nmisleading comparison. There is probably no department of human inquiry\r\nin which the art of cooking statistics is unknown, and there are\r\nsceptics who have substituted \"statistics\" for \"expert witnesses\" in\r\nthe well-known saying about classes of false statements. Miss\r\nNightingale's scheme for Uniform Hospital Statistics seems to require\r\nfor its realization a more diffused passion for statistics and a greater\r\ndelicacy of statistical conscience than a voluntary and competitive\r\nsystem of hospitals is likely to create.\r\n\r\n  [315] See Bibliography A, No. 28.\r\n\r\nAt the time she was full of hope, and, having obtained a start with\r\nmedical statistics, she next pursued the subject in relation to surgical\r\noperations. Sir James Paget had been in communication with her on this\r\npoint. \"We want,\" he had written (Feb. 18, 1861), \"a much more exact\r\naccount and a more particular record of each case. Thus in some returns\r\nwe have about 40 per cent of the deaths ascribed to 'exhaustion,' in\r\nothers, referring to the same [kind of] operations, about 3 per cent or\r\nless; the truth being that in nearly all cases of 'exhaustion' there was\r\nsome cause of death which more accurate inquiry would have ascertained.\"\r\nMiss Nightingale (May 1, 1861) congratulated him on \"St. Bartholomew's\r\nhaving the credit of the first Statistical Report worth having,\" but the\r\ntable of operations was still, she thought, most unsatisfactory. \"It\r\nwould be most desirable that an uniform Table should be adopted in all\r\nHospitals, including all the elements of age, sex, accident, habit of\r\nbody, nature of operation, after-accidents, etc., etc. Could you come in\r\nto-morrow between 2 and 4, and bring your list of the causes of death\r\nafter operations? It would be invaluable, coming from such an authority,\r\nfor constructing a Form.\" She consulted other surgeons, civil and\r\nmilitary, and wrote a paper, with Model Forms, for the International\r\nStatistical Congress held at Berlin in September 1863. These also were\r\nincluded in a revised edition of _Notes on Hospitals_. The Royal College\r\nof Surgeons referred the subject to a Committee, which, however,\r\nreported adversely upon Miss Nightingale's Forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nBefore the International Congress at London in 1860 separated, Miss\r\nNightingale addressed a letter to Lord Shaftesbury (President of the\r\nSecond Section), which was read to the whole Congress, and adopted by it\r\nas a resolution. The point of it was to impress upon Governments the\r\nimportance of publishing more numerous abstracts of the large amount of\r\nstatistical information in their possession. She gave various instances\r\nin which useful lessons might thus be enforced upon the public mind, and\r\ncited Guizot's words: \"Valuable reports, replete with facts and\r\nsuggestions drawn up by committees, inspectors, directors, and prefects,\r\nremain unknown to the public. Government ought to take care to make\r\nitself acquainted with, and promote the diffusion of all good methods,\r\nto watch all endeavours, to encourage every improvement. With our habits\r\nand institutions, there is but one instrument endowed with energy and\r\npower sufficient to secure this salutary influence--that instrument is\r\nthe press.\" With Miss Nightingale statistics were a passion and not\r\nmerely a hobby. They did, indeed, please her, as congenial to the nature\r\nof her mind. Her correspondence with Dr. Balfour and Dr. Farr shows how\r\nshe revelled in them. \"I have a New Year's Gift for you,\" wrote Dr. Farr\r\n(Jan. 1860); \"it is in the shape of Tables, as you will conjecture.\" \"I\r\nam exceedingly anxious,\" she replied, \"as you may suppose, to see your\r\ncharming Gift, especially those Returns showing the deaths, admissions,\r\ndiseases,\" etc., etc. But she loved statistics, not for their own sake,\r\nbut for their practical uses. It was by the statistical method that she\r\nhad driven home the lessons of the Crimean hospitals. It was the study\r\nof statistics that had opened her eyes to the preventable mortality\r\namong the Army at home, and that had thus enabled her to work for the\r\nhealth of the British soldier. She was already engaged on similar\r\nstudies in relation to India. She was in very serious, and even in\r\nbitter, earnest a \"passionate statistician.\" And the passion, as will\r\nappear in a later chapter,[316] was even a religious passion.\r\n\r\n  [316] See below, p. 480.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale made a valiant attempt to extend the scope of the\r\nCensus of 1861 in the interest of collecting statistical data for\r\nsanitary improvements. There were two directions in which she desired to\r\nextend the questions. One was to enumerate the numbers of sick and\r\ninfirm on the Census day. For sanitary purposes it would be extremely\r\nuseful to determine the proportion of sick in the different parts of the\r\ncountry. To those who said that it could not be done, because the people\r\nwould not give the information, the answer was that it had been done in\r\nIreland. The other point was to obtain full information about house\r\naccommodation; facts which, as would now be considered obvious, have a\r\nvital bearing on the sanitary and social conditions of the people. This\r\npoint also had been covered in the Irish Census. Dr. Farr entirely\r\nagreed with Miss Nightingale, but he could not persuade Sir George\r\nLewis, the Home Secretary, to include these provisions in the Census\r\nBill (1860). Miss Nightingale thereupon drew up a memorandum on the\r\nsubject, and, through Mr. Lowe (Vice-President of the Council),\r\nsubmitted it to the Home Secretary. Mr. Lowe may have agreed with her,\r\nbut he failed to persuade his colleague. \"Whenever I have power,\" wrote\r\nMr. Lowe (May 9), \"you can always command me, but official omnipotence\r\nis circumscribed in the narrow limits of its own department.\" Sir George\r\nLewis replied that \"both of Miss Nightingale's points had been duly\r\nconsidered before the Census Bill was introduced. It was thought that\r\nthe question of health or sickness was too indeterminate.\" \"With regard\r\nto an enumeration of houses, it was thought that this is not a proper\r\nsubject to be included in a Census of population.\" A very official\r\nanswer! But Sir George added that he did not see how the result of such\r\nenumeration could be \"peculiarly instructive\"--an avowal which he also\r\nmade in the House of Commons. The cleverest of men are sometimes dense;\r\nand this remark of Sir George Lewis, added to his subsequent conduct of\r\nthe War Office, earned for him, in Miss Nightingale's familiar\r\ncorrespondence, the sobriquet of \"The Muff.\" In communicating the result\r\nof her first attempt to Dr. Farr, she said, \"If you think that anything\r\nmore can be done, pray say so. I'm your man.\" But she had not waited to\r\nbe spurred on. She had already bethought herself of a second string in\r\nthe House of Lords. Lord Shaftesbury, to whom she had appealed, promised\r\nto do all he could. Lord Grey did the same, and asked her to send Dr.\r\nFarr to coach him. She began to \"thank God we have a House of Lords\":--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Robert Lowe._) OLD BURLINGTON ST., _May_ 10\r\n     [1860]. I cannot forbear thanking you for your letter and for your\r\n     exertions in our favour. Sir George Lewis's letter, _being\r\n     interpreted_, means: \"Mr. Waddington does not choose to take the\r\n     trouble.\" It is a letter such as I have scores of in my possession,\r\n     from Airey, Filder, and alas! from Lord Raglan, from Sir John Hall\r\n     (the doctor) and from Andrew Smith. It is a true \"Horse Guards\"\r\n     letter.\r\n\r\n     They are the very same arguments that Lord John used against the\r\n     feasibility of registering the \"cause of death\" in '37--which has now\r\n     been the law of the land for 23 years. He was beaten in the Lords. And\r\n     we are now going to fight Sir George Lewis in the Lords. And we hope\r\n     to beat him too. It is mere child's play to tell us that what every\r\n     man of the millions who belong to Friendly Societies does every day of\r\n     his life, as to registering himself sick or well, cannot be done in\r\n     the Census. It is mere childishness to tell us that it is not\r\n     important to know what houses the people live in. The French Census\r\n     does it. The Irish Census tells us of the great diminution of mud\r\n     cabins between '41 and '51. The connection between the _health_ and\r\n     the _dwellings_ of the population is one of the most important that\r\n     exists. The \"diseases\" can be obtained approximately also. In all the\r\n     more important--such as smallpox, fevers, measles, heart-disease,\r\n     etc.--all those which affect the _national_ health, there will be\r\n     very little error. (About ladies' nervous diseases there will be a\r\n     great deal.) Where there is error in these things, the error is\r\n     uniform, as is proved by the Friendly Societies; and corrects\r\n     itself....\r\n\r\nThe passionate statisticians were, however, hopelessly out-voted in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Mr. Caird moved in her sense on the subject of fuller\r\ndetail about house-accommodation, and in sending her the printed notice\r\nof his amendment, said that \"his position would be greatly strengthened\r\nwith the House if he could obtain Miss Nightingale's permission to quote\r\nher name in favour of the usefulness of such an inquiry.\" I do not know\r\nwhether she gave permission; the debate is reported very briefly in\r\nHansard. But in any case Mr. Caird's amendment was promptly negatived.\r\nAs for the House of Lords, Miss Nightingale's reliance upon a better\r\nlove of statistics in that assembly was cruelly falsified. The Census\r\nBill came up late in the session, and I do not find that either Lord\r\nGrey or Lord Shaftesbury said a word upon the subject. The only critical\r\ncontribution made to the debate proceeded from Lord Ellenborough, who,\r\nso far from wanting the Census Bill to include provision for more\r\nstatistical data, proposed to exclude most of those that were already\r\nin. He could not for the life of him see what was the use of asking\r\npeople so many questions.[317] Here, then, Miss Nightingale was in\r\nadvance of the time; in one case, by a generation, in the other, by two\r\ngenerations. Recent Censuses have included more particulars of the\r\nhousing of the people, though still not so many as she wanted. Official\r\nstatistics of the local distribution of sickness will presently be\r\nobtained, I suppose, in a different way, through the machinery of the\r\nNational Health Insurance Act.\r\n\r\n  [317] Lords' debate, July 24; principal Commons' debate, July 12, 1860.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeprived by the recalcitrance of the Home Secretary and Parliament of a\r\nfuller feast of statistics at home, Miss Nightingale turned to the\r\nColonies and Dependencies. The Secretary for the Colonies gave her\r\nfacilities for collecting much curious and instructive information; and\r\nthe Secretary for India accepted her aid in collecting and tabulating\r\nfacts and figures which were the foundation of some of the most notable\r\nand beneficent of her labours. But, though she was already (1860-1)\r\nengaged in these inquiries, they belong in the main to a later period;\r\nand we must now turn to another side of Miss Nightingale's work for the\r\nimprovement of the National Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       THE FOUNDER OF MODERN NURSING\r\n\r\n                                  (1860)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Where is the woman who shall be the Clara or the Teresa of Protestant\r\n     England, labouring for the certain benefit of her sex with their\r\n     ardour, but without their delusion?--SOUTHEY'S _Colloquies_ (1829).\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century produced three famous persons in this country who\r\ncontributed more than any of their contemporaries to the relief of human\r\nsuffering in disease: Simpson, the introducer of chloroform; Lister, the\r\ninventor of antiseptic surgery; and Florence Nightingale, the founder of\r\nmodern nursing. The second of the great discoveries completed the\r\nbeneficent work of the first. The third development--the creation of\r\nnursing as a trained profession--has co-operated powerfully with the\r\nother two, and would have been beneficent even if the use of anæsthetics\r\nand antiseptics had not been discovered. The contribution of Florence\r\nNightingale to the healing art was less original than that of either\r\nSimpson or Lister; but perhaps, from its wider range, it has saved as\r\nmany lives, and relieved as much, if not so acute, suffering as either\r\nof the other two.\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe profession of nursing is at once very old and very new; and the\r\nplace of Miss Nightingale in the history of it has not always been\r\nrightly understood. Nursing--and even nursing by educated women--is very\r\nold. \"She herself nursed the unhappy, emaciated victims of hunger and\r\ndisease. How often have I seen her wash wounds whose fetid odour\r\nprevented every one else from even looking at them! She fed the sick\r\nwith her own hands, and revived the dying with small and frequent\r\nportions of nourishment. I know that many wealthy persons cannot\r\novercome the repugnance caused by such works of charity. I do not judge\r\nthem; but, if I had a hundred tongues and a clarion voice, I could not\r\nenumerate the number of patients for whom she provided solace and care.\"\r\nThis passage, which is not unlike some of the panegyrics showered upon\r\nFlorence Nightingale's work during the Crimean War, was written, nearly\r\nfifteen centuries earlier, by St. Jerome in describing the work of\r\nFabiola, a lady of patrician rank, who in 390 A.D. built a hospital at\r\nRome, where she devoted herself to the care of the sick. Female nursing\r\nis as old as Christianity, and for centuries the religious Orders had\r\nsent cultivated women into the hospitals. The very name of \"Sister,\" now\r\napplied to a rank in the nursing profession in general, recalls its\r\nhistorical origin in religious enthusiasm. Nor was there anything novel\r\nin the mere fact, though there was much that was novel in the method, of\r\nMiss Nightingale's service as a war-nurse. It was novel in the case of\r\nthe British Army, but in that of other countries Sisters had already\r\naccompanied armies to the field. And, again, it was not an original\r\nconception on Miss Nightingale's part that nurses should be trained for\r\ntheir work. Her master, Theodor Fliedner, had shown the way in Germany;\r\nand in our own country Mrs. Fry's Institute of Nursing was established\r\nin 1840, and the St. John's House in 1848, Miss Nightingale's, at St.\r\nThomas's, not till 1860.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though not the founder of nursing, Florence Nightingale\r\nwas the founder of modern nursing. It is not always realized how modern\r\nis the institution of nursing, on any large scale as a distinct and\r\ntrained calling. I have indicated above the three lines of\r\ninfluence--religion, war, and science--along which the development of\r\nsick-nursing has proceeded. Miss Nightingale came at the psychological\r\nmoment to give it a vast impetus upon each of those lines. Religion was\r\ntending to become less abstract, and more closely allied to the service\r\nof man. Miss Nightingale was the St. Clara or the St. Teresa of the new\r\norder, for whom Southey had called. She was prepared, by her experience,\r\nby the character of her mind, by the drift of her philosophical\r\nspeculations, not to imitate old forms, but to create a new order, an\r\norder of nurses who should, indeed, be devoted to their calling, but\r\nshould be organized on a secular basis. The deeply religious bent of\r\nMiss Nightingale's character, the single-mindedness of her purpose, and\r\nher constant appeal to high ideals, enabled her to give to (or at any\r\nrate to require from) the Seculars of the new order something of the\r\ndevotion possessed by the religious Regulars. The Crimean War, in which\r\nMiss Nightingale was one of the central figures, gave further force to a\r\nmovement for increasing the number and improving the qualification of\r\nnurses. It enlisted sentiment in the cause. The American Civil War (in\r\nwhich, as we shall hear presently, Miss Nightingale's example played a\r\ngreat part) extended the movement to the United States, and the Red\r\nCross organization may also be considered as an outcome of her work in\r\nthe Crimea. The progress of science was tending in a like direction.\r\nMedicine and surgery were on the eve of receiving great developments.\r\nSanitary science was already making advance. At the time when Florence\r\nNightingale was in training at Kaiserswerth, Joseph Lister was a medical\r\nstudent at University College. Cohn, the founder of bacteriology, was\r\nonly eight years her junior. Parkes, one of the founders of modern\r\nhygiene, was almost exactly her contemporary. It was inevitable that\r\nnursing also should be developed in a scientific spirit, and no one was\r\nbetter qualified than Miss Nightingale to take the lead in such a\r\nmovement. Her experience in the East had filled her with a passionate\r\nconviction of the importance of sanitary science. She was the centre of\r\na circle of earnest and devoted men who were devoting themselves to it.\r\nShe was personally acquainted with many of the leading physicians and\r\nsurgeons of the day. And there was yet a fourth line upon which Miss\r\nNightingale might seem to be predestined for this special work. What is\r\ncalled the \"woman's movement\" was beginning. \"There is an old legend,\"\r\nwrote Miss Nightingale, at the beginning of her pamphlet on\r\nKaiserswerth, \"that the nineteenth century is to be the 'century of\r\nwomen.'\" At the time when she wrote (1851), the century, she added, had\r\nnot yet been theirs. But there was a spirit stirring the waters. Other\r\nnotable women were at work, claiming for their sex a place in the sun\r\nof the world's work. Miss Nightingale was not wholly sympathetic to what\r\nshe called \"woman's missionariness.\" But the circumstances of her own\r\nlife, as the First Part of this Memoir has shown, made her intensely\r\ninterested in claiming that a woman should not be debarred from entering\r\na walk of life to which she is fitted simply because she is a woman; and\r\nof such walks of life, nursing is obviously one. Controversy is\r\nperennial between those who ascribe the course of political or social\r\nhistory mainly to great men, and those who ascribe it rather to streams\r\nof tendency. It is less open to controversy to say that the great men\r\nwho leave the more permanent mark upon history are those whose genius\r\nconforms to the spirit of their time, but who are yet a little in\r\nadvance of their age. Among such \"great men\" the founder of modern\r\nnursing is to be reckoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nIn what precise respect, it may be asked, did Florence Nightingale\r\n\"found\" modern nursing? The answer to this question may, I think, be\r\ndisentangled without much difficulty from a good deal of conflicting\r\nstatement. I have referred already, in connection with the fettering\r\nscruples of Miss Nightingale's parents,[318] to a conflict of evidence\r\nupon the morals of hospitals and hospital nurses in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. Her own opinion at that time (and she did not\r\nexpress it without much inquiry and observation) is given in the\r\npamphlet, above mentioned, where she says that hospitals were \"a school,\r\nit may almost be said, for immorality and impropriety--inevitable where\r\nwomen of bad character are admitted as nurses, to become worse by their\r\ncontact with male patients and young surgeons.... We see the nurses\r\ndrinking, we see the neglect at night owing to their falling\r\nasleep.\"[319] Such statements were indignantly denied by other\r\nauthorities, equally well qualified to form a correct judgment.\r\nControversy broke out upon the subject a few years later in connection\r\nwith the Nightingale Memorial Fund. A correspondent of the _Times_, who\r\nsigned himself \"One who has walked a good many Hospitals,\" gave in\r\n1857[320] the same kind of account that Miss Nightingale had given in\r\n1851. He was answered, and his statements were hotly denied.[321]\r\nObviously there were hospitals and hospitals, and still more there were\r\nnurses and nurses, and no _general_ indictment was just on the point of\r\nmorals. Upon the question of drinking among nurses, both in hospitals\r\nand in private service, there is less room for doubt. Dickens was a\r\ncaricaturist, but he was an effective caricaturist; and no caricature is\r\neffective in its day unless it bears considerable resemblance to the\r\ntruth. In his preface he spoke of Mrs. Gamp as a fair representation, at\r\nthe time _Martin Chuzzlewit_ was published, of the hired attendant on\r\nthe poor; and he might have added, says his biographer, that the rich\r\nwere no better off, for the original of Mrs. Gamp \"was in reality a\r\nperson hired by a most distinguished friend of his own a lady, to take\r\ncharge of an invalid very dear to her.\"[322] This one can the more\r\nreadily understand in the light of a remark by Lady Palmerston quoted\r\nabove.[323] \"'Mrs. Gamp,' said Mrs. Harris, 'if ever there was a sober\r\ncreetur to be got at eighteen pence a day for working people, and three\r\nand six for gentlefolks, you are that inwallable person.'\" Great ladies\r\nclearly thought that such persons existed only, and could only be\r\nexpected to exist, in the world of imagination and of Mrs. Harris. In\r\n1854, Miss Mary Stanley, or a friend of hers, sent out a circular, very\r\npossibly with the knowledge of Miss Nightingale, to various persons\r\nconnected with hospitals and infirmaries, of which the object was to\r\nsuggest that nurses should be instructed, on the Kaiserswerth plan, in\r\nthe art of administering religious comfort to patients. The replies\r\nwhich were subsequently printed[324] throw much light upon the position\r\nof nurses at the time. \"If I can but obtain a sober set,\" wrote a doctor\r\nin the North, \"it is as much as I can hope for.\" \"I enquired for Dr.\r\nX.,\" said another reply, \"about the character of the nurses, and he\r\nsays they always engage them without any character, as no respectable\r\nperson would undertake so disagreeable an office. He says the duties\r\nthey have to perform are most unpleasant, and that it is little wonder\r\nthat many of them drink, as they require something to keep up the\r\nstimulus.\" The ordinary wages were £14 to £16 a year. It should be\r\nremembered, further, that hospital nurses had, as a rule, in the middle\r\nof the last century no uniform dress, and cooked their own food (which\r\nthey bought for themselves), eating their meals in the ward kitchens or\r\nscullery: \"If the sister happened to be partial to red herrings for\r\nbreakfast, or onion-stew for dinner, or toasted cheese for supper, the\r\nconsequent state of the ward may be imagined. The assistant nurses had\r\nto do all the scrubbing and cleaning of the wards, and to cook for the\r\nother nurses and themselves.\"[325] A side-light is thrown on the\r\nslovenliness of the arrangements by the account of what happened at\r\nKing's College Hospital when the nursing was taken over in 1856 by\r\ntrained nurses from St. John's House under Miss Mary Jones. \"By the end\r\nof the day the new-comers, who had arrived in clean and dainty uniforms,\r\nwere like a set of sweeps or char-women, in such an appalling state of\r\ndisorder had they found their wards.\"[326] There were some excellent\r\nnurses under the old régime (apart from those trained at St. John's\r\nHouse), as Sir James Paget testified[327]; though it may be noted that\r\neven amongst his model Sisters, one was \"not seldom rather tipsy.\" But\r\n\"the greater part of them,\" he says, \"were rough, dull, unobservant,\r\nuntaught.\" The stoutest defender of the old system, the most stubborn\r\nopponent of Miss Nightingale's reforms, gives unconsciously equal\r\nsupport to Sir James Paget's statement that \"in the department of\r\nnursing there is the greatest and happiest contrast of all.\" Mr. South\r\nwas of opinion that all was for the best, before Miss Nightingale began\r\nto interfere, in the best of all possible nursing worlds. But his\r\nconception of the ideal nurse is this: \"As regards the nurses or\r\nward-maids, these are in much the same position as housemaids, and\r\nrequire little teaching beyond that of poultice-making.\"[328]\r\n\r\n  [318] Above, p. 60.\r\n\r\n  [319] _Kaiserswerth_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n  [320] _Times_, April 15, 1857.\r\n\r\n  [321] In a pamphlet by Mr. J.

Also Observations on\r\n        Training Establishments for Hospitals_, 1857, pp. 11, 16.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, facts emerge which will clearly explain wherein Miss\r\nNightingale's work as the founder of modern nursing consisted. She was\r\nnot entirely alone, nor was she in point of time the first, in the\r\nfield; and there were exceptional cases to which the following\r\nstatements do not apply. But she was able to do on a larger scale, and\r\non a scale and in a form which attracted general imitation, what others\r\nhad attempted. And speaking generally, we may say that before Miss\r\nNightingale appeared on the scene, nursing was, and was regarded as, a\r\nmenial occupation which did not attract women of character; that it was\r\nill-paid and little respected; that no high standard of efficiency was\r\nexpected; and that no training was organized: the women picked up their\r\nknowledge in the wards. They were, as the correspondent of the _Times_\r\nsaid, \"meek, pious, saucy, careless, drunken, or unchaste, according to\r\ncircumstances or temperament, mostly attentive, and rarely unkind\"; but,\r\nwith very few exceptions, they were untrained. \"A poor woman is left a\r\nwidow with two or three children. What is she to do? She would starve on\r\nneedlework; she is unfit for domestic service; she knows nobody to give\r\nher charring, and has no money to buy a mangle. So she gets a\r\nrecommendation from a clergyman, and is engaged as a Hospital Nurse.\"\r\nThe change which has come about since Miss Nightingale's work took\r\neffect is strikingly illustrated in the Census. In 1861 there were\r\n27,618 nurses \"in hospitals, or nurses not apparently domestic\r\nservants,\" and they were enumerated, in the tables of Occupations of the\r\nPeople, under the head of \"Domestic.\" In 1901 there were 64,214 nurses,\r\nand they were enumerated under the head of \"Medicine.\" Miss Nightingale\r\nwas the founder of modern nursing because she made public opinion\r\nperceive, and act upon the perception, that nursing was an art, and must\r\nbe raised to the status of a trained profession. That was the essence\r\nof the matter. Other things, such as the opening of nursing to higher\r\nsocial strata, the better payment of nurses, etc., though important and\r\ninteresting, were only results.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe means by which Miss Nightingale achieved this great work were three.\r\nShe brought to bear upon it the force, successively, of her Example, her\r\nPrecept, and her Practice. The first two of these aspects of her work\r\nwill be considered in the remainder of the present chapter; the third is\r\nthe subject of the next chapter.\r\n\r\nNo woman, I suppose, who was not canonized or who had not worn (or been\r\ndeprived of) a crown, has ever excited among her sex so much passionate\r\nand affectionate admiration, and set to so many an example, as Florence\r\nNightingale. I have tried in an earlier chapter, entitled \"The Popular\r\nHeroine,\" to describe the effect which her work in the Crimean War\r\nproduced upon the minds of her contemporaries. To get first-hand\r\nimpressions, the younger readers of to-day must go to their grandmothers\r\nor great-aunts. It is they who can help us best to some imagination of\r\nthe thrill which the stories of her nursing in the Crimea excited\r\nthroughout the land, of the intensity of sympathetic admiration which\r\nwent out towards her, of the impulse towards a fuller and worthier life\r\nwhich proceeded from her example. But old letters are of some assistance\r\ntoo. From a packet of family letters here is one, from an aunt to a\r\nniece: \"_April_ 15, 1857. I fear from a line in one of the newspapers\r\nthat Florence Nightingale's life is approaching an end. I have been\r\ndeeply impressed by her life these last few days, which in respect of\r\nmine forms but a fragment in regard of time, and what she has\r\naccomplished! A high mission has been given her which has cost her her\r\nlife to fulfil.\"[329] In how many other minds, young and old alike, must\r\nFlorence Nightingale's example have stirred similar thoughts! A lady who\r\nhad attained high distinction as a Nightingale nurse was asked after\r\nMiss Nightingale's death to record her recollections: \"My first thoughts\r\nof Miss Nightingale date back to that winter of frozen rivers, when\r\nchildren, catching up the rumours of the street, ran about shouting\r\n_Sebastopol's taken_; or danced, listening around the old weaver's wife\r\nwho had come to the door of her cottage to catch the last light, and\r\nread aloud to her husband what 'Lord Raiglan' was doing and saying; or\r\nlater, in the hour before bed-time, sat at their father's feet while he\r\ntold of the frozen trenches, of the 'dreary corridors of pain,' and of\r\nthat 'ministering angel,' whose devotion was lightening a nation's\r\ndistress; or perhaps later still in sleep, dreamed children's dreams of\r\ncreeping amid sleeping Russians, stealing the golden crown from the\r\nCzar's head, and escaping with it to Florence Nightingale! Such\r\nexperiences left indelibly impressed on the minds of the children of my\r\ngeneration the gentle and heroic figure of Miss Nightingale.\" Often, no\r\ndoubt, the impulse was fleeting, and the broken purpose wasted in air.\r\nAnd often, too, the impulse was vague, and resulted in no definite\r\naction; yet not on that account, perhaps, to be cast aside as valueless.\r\n\"I have a belief of my own,\" says one of George Eliot's characters, \"and\r\nit comforts me--That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we\r\ndon't quite know what it is, and cannot do what we would, we are part of\r\nthe divine power against evil.\" But often the force of Florence\r\nNightingale's example was direct and practical. Among those whom it\r\ninfluenced in this way was Luise, the Grand Duchess of Baden, who in\r\n1859 founded a Ladies' Society in Baden for the training of nurses. She\r\nhad never seen Miss Nightingale, but a letter filled the Grand Duchess\r\nwith enthusiastic gratitude. \"I felt,\" she wrote (Sept. 1861), \"that\r\nboth joy and strength had come to me from your dear letter. I may try\r\nindeed to thank you for it, but I shall never succeed in expressing how\r\ndeeply and how highly I felt your kindness. If there is any progress in\r\nthe work I have so much at heart, it is greatly to your encouraging\r\nsupport I owe it.\" Those who saw Miss Nightingale, and who were\r\nsympathetic, felt thrilled in her presence. \"She is so far more\r\ndelightful in herself,\" wrote Clara Novello, \"than in one's\r\nimagination.\" To nurses already engaged in work, Miss Nightingale's\r\npersonal influence was an inspiration. Miss Mary Jones, of King's\r\nCollege Hospital, addressed her as \"My beloved Friend and Mistress.\" \"I\r\nvalue your nosegay too much to part with any one flower even.\" \"I look\r\non a visit to you as my one indulgence and greatest pleasure.\" But those\r\nwho never saw Miss Nightingale, nor even heard from her, felt the force\r\nof her example. In what was publicly known of her career, there was, as\r\nit were, a call and a challenge to women. Here was a woman, of high\r\nability and of social standing, who had forsaken all to be a nurse. She\r\nsought to raise nursing to the rank of a High Art. She had already in\r\nsome measure done it by her example.\r\n\r\n  [329] _A Century of Family Letters_, vol. ii. p. 174.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nIn every walk of life, however, there are those who seek the palm\r\nwithout the dust. Miss Nightingale had seen already in the Crimea many\r\nwomen who had followed her example, indeed, in desiring to nurse the\r\nsick, but into whose heads it had never entered that nursing required\r\nspecial gifts and careful training. Example had to be supplemented by\r\nprecept. Miss Nightingale's precepts upon the Art of Nursing were first\r\ngiven to the world in 1859-60. Her _Notes on Nursing_--the best known,\r\nand in some ways the best, of her books--was published in December 1859.\r\nIt was instantly recognized by the leaders in medical and sanitary\r\nscience as a work of first-rate importance; as one of those rare books\r\nto which, within their range, the term epoch-making may rightly be\r\napplied. \"I am ashamed to find,\" wrote Sir James Paget, \"how much I have\r\nlearnt from the _Notes_, more, I think, than from any other book of the\r\nsame size that I have ever read.\" \"I am delighted with them,\" wrote Sir\r\nJames Clark. \"They will do more to call attention to Household Hygiene\r\nthan anything that has ever been written.\" \"This,\" wrote Harriet\r\nMartineau, \"is a work of genius if ever I saw one; and it will operate\r\naccordingly. It is so real and so intense, that it will, I doubt not,\r\ncreate an Order of Nurses before it has finished its work.\" This was a\r\ntrue prediction. Miss Nightingale was the founder of a New Model, and\r\nthe _Notes on Nursing_ was its gospel.\r\n\r\nThe anticipations of her friends that the _Notes_ would be popular were\r\nabundantly fulfilled. Here was a book by Florence Nightingale on the\r\nvery subject to which her fame was attached. The effect produced upon\r\nmany minds by _Notes upon Nursing_ was the greater because it came, as\r\nit were, as a kind of resurrection of the popular heroine. The years\r\nwhich had passed since Miss Nightingale's return from the Crimea were,\r\nas we now know, years of ceaseless activity; years during which she had\r\ndone some of her greatest work. But it must be remembered that all this\r\nwas entirely unknown to most people at the time. The common belief was\r\nthat Miss Nightingale had retired into private life upon her return from\r\nthe Crimea; but now after a long interval she came before the public\r\nagain. And, though, as in all that she wrote for the public eye, there\r\nwas a conspicuous absence of self-advertisement, there was enough in the\r\nbook to connect many of its pages with scenes and episodes of the\r\nCrimean War. An enthusiastic review in a paper not generally given to\r\nenthusiasm pointed out the connection: \"Hundreds of brave men attested\r\nwith their dying breath how nobly Miss Nightingale's self-imposed task\r\nwas fulfilled, and this little book would be almost enough to explain\r\nher success. Its tone seems to tell of the solemn scenes from which\r\nexperience in such matters has to be gained. Its language is grave,\r\nearnest, and impetuous, like that of a person who has lived among sad\r\nrealities, and has been face to face with almost every form of human\r\nsuffering.\"[330] Nor was it only the general tone of the book that was\r\nsuggestive of the heroine of the Crimean War. Here and there little\r\ntouches of personal experience were introduced, in which every one could\r\nread the occasion between the lines. When the author talked of her\r\n\"sadly large experience of death-beds,\" the reader thought of the Lady\r\nwith the Lamp at Scutari; and when in her chapter on \"Variety\" she\r\nrecalled \"the acute suffering produced from the patient (in a hut) not\r\nbeing able to see out of window,\" the reader's mind went back to the\r\npictures of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava. \"I shall never forget,\" she\r\nwrote, \"the rapture of fever patients over a bunch of bright-coloured\r\nflowers.\" She was thinking again of the Crimea. The wild flowers there\r\nare many and brilliant; and the nurses used to gather them in the early\r\nmorning walk which each took in turn.[331]\r\n\r\n  [330] _Saturday Review_, Jan. 21, 1860.\r\n\r\n  [331] _Hornby_, p. 306.\r\n\r\nThe book was not cheap at first; the price was 5s. But 15,000 copies\r\nwere sold in a month, and a cheaper edition at 2s. quickly followed. It\r\nwas read, sooner or later, by all sorts and conditions of people; in\r\npalaces, in cottages, in factories. Queen Victoria \"thanked Miss\r\nNightingale _very much_ for the book,\" and sent in return a print of\r\nherself and the Prince Consort. From the Grand Duchess of Baden the book\r\ncalled forth an overflowing tribute. \"I will not attempt to describe to\r\nyou,\" she wrote (Oct. 9, 1860), \"with how much interest and admiration I\r\nread these pages, so beautiful in their simplicity, so admirable in\r\ntheir true Christian spirit. Rarely has a book made so deep an\r\nimpression on me. I cannot refrain from expressing the real admiration I\r\nfeel for the noble English lady who has devoted so much of her life to\r\nsuffering mankind, and who has given to all her sisters an example never\r\nto be forgotten.\" With further expressions of personal admiration, the\r\nGrand Duchess added a very just characterization of the book: \"The\r\ngentle feelings of the woman are joined to experience, reflexion, and\r\nscience.\" Miss Nightingale was urged to prepare a popular sevenpenny\r\nedition, and this appeared early in 1861 with the title _Notes on\r\nNursing for the Labouring Classes_, and with a new chapter called\r\n\"Minding Baby.\" \"And now, girls,\" this chapter begins, \"I have a word\r\nfor you. You and I have all had a great deal to do with 'minding baby,'\r\nthough 'baby' was not our own baby.[332] And we would all of us do a\r\ngreat deal for baby, which we would not do for ourselves.\" \"Did I tell\r\nyou,\" wrote Miss Nightingale to Madame Mohl (May 7, 1861), \"what\r\nprompted my little chapter on _Minding Baby_? A Peckham schoolmaster\r\nasked me, saying he could always make the school-girls mind my book by\r\ntelling them it was 'for baby's sake.' And several opened their parents'\r\nwindows at night (greatly to the indignation of the parents, I am\r\nthinking), and removed dung-hills before the doors in consequence.\" In\r\nits cheap form, the book had a very large circulation. Mr. Chadwick\r\ninterested himself in getting it recommended for school-reading.\r\nBenevolent persons distributed it gratuitously in villages and cities.\r\nEdition after edition was rapidly called for. Among Miss Nightingale's\r\npapers I find letters from correspondents reporting cases in which\r\noffice clerks and factory hands, after reading the book, voted the\r\nwindows open.\r\n\r\n  [332] \"The chapter on Minding the Baby,\" wrote Mr. Jowett (Aug. 24,\r\n        1868), \"is excellent. I particularly like the parenthesis ('though\r\n        he's not our baby') in which a world of morality is contained.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was read, not only by all sorts and conditions of people at\r\nhome, but also in many countries and in many tongues abroad. It had\r\ninstantly been reprinted in America. It was translated into German, into\r\nFrench (with a preface by Miss Nightingale's old acquaintance, M.\r\nGuizot),[333] and into most of the other European languages. If the book\r\nbe out of print, it ought to be included in one of the cheaper series of\r\nthe day. It can never be out of date, and no one who has read it has\r\never found it dull.\r\n\r\n  [333] Bibliography A, No. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale was essentially a \"man of action,\" not a writer. Yet\r\nher writings are very characteristic of her work, and none is more\r\npleasantly so than _Notes on Nursing_. Not the whole of her nature\r\n\"breaks through language and escapes\" into it, but this little book\r\nalone would be enough to explain to an understanding reader several\r\ncharacteristics of her mind and work. It is an incomparable treatise on\r\nthe art of nursing; but, as Sir James Paget indicated, it is more than\r\nthat: it is an alphabet of Household Hygiene. Miss Nightingale's\r\ntreatment of the subject reveals at the outset her philosophical grasp.\r\n\"Shall we begin,\" she says, \"by taking it as a general principle that\r\nall disease, at some period or other of its course, is more or less a\r\nreparative process, not necessarily accompanied with suffering: an\r\neffort of nature to remedy a process of poisoning or decay, which has\r\ntaken place weeks, months, sometimes years beforehand, unnoticed, the\r\ntermination of the disease being then, while the antecedent process was\r\ngoing on, determined? If we are asked, Is such or such a disease a\r\nreparative process? Can such an illness be unaccompanied by suffering?\r\nWill any care prevent such a patient from suffering this or that?--I\r\nhumbly say, I do not know. But when you have done away with all that\r\npain and suffering, which in patients are the symptoms, not of their\r\ndisease, but of the absence of one or all of the essentials to the\r\nsuccess of Nature's reparative processes, we shall then know what are\r\nthe symptoms of, and the sufferings inseparable from, the disease.\" This\r\nis, surely, sound philosophy; not overthrown by any later discoveries\r\nabout germs and microbes. It is the philosophy of eliminating the known\r\nas a preliminary to investigating the unknown. It leads Miss Nightingale\r\nto insist on the importance, as she calls it, of \"nursing the well\"\r\nbefore they become the sick; or in other words, to the principles of\r\ndomestic hygiene--ventilation, warming, drains, light, cleanliness. In\r\nall this her book had more originality than the younger readers of\r\nto-day will realize without some effort of retrospective imagination.\r\nThe homes of the poor were in her day those that were not very much\r\ncaricatured by Dickens and Cruickshank. The schools of the poor, which\r\nhave taught some of the principles of hygiene directly, and have had a\r\nyet wider influence indirectly by setting an example of airy rooms and\r\ncleanliness, were still in the future. Working people in those days\r\ncould, moreover, hardly be reached by writings. It was the popular fame\r\nof Florence Nightingale that won for her _Notes on Nursing_ an audience\r\nfrom \"the Labouring Classes.\" Nor is it only among those classes that\r\ngreat changes in current ideas and practice about domestic hygiene have\r\nbeen effected. At the time when Miss Nightingale wrote, stuffiness\r\ncharacterized the most genteel interiors. She was a pioneer in\r\nestablishing the principles of modern hygiene; and perhaps even to-day\r\nthere is still room for a wider acceptance of her doctrine that \"nursing\r\nthe well\" is even more important than nursing the sick--preventive\r\nhygiene, than curative medicine.\r\n\r\nA characteristic of Miss Nightingale's mind, and of her methods in\r\naction is, as has been noticed already, her combination of general\r\ngrasp with minute attention to detail, and this is particularly\r\nremarkable in her _Notes on Nursing_. In the chapter dealing with\r\nnursing, in the more common acceptance of the term, one is struck on\r\nalmost every page with this rare combination of gifts. Nothing is too\r\nminute for her touch, but everything is referred to a general principle.\r\nHer philosophy of \"Noises,\" with the detailed injunctions which she\r\nbases upon it, is alone enough to entitle her to the eternal gratitude\r\nof invalids.\r\n\r\nThe book is no less remarkable for delicacy of observation and fineness\r\nof sympathy. \"Apprehension, uncertainty, waiting, expectation, fear of\r\nsurprise, do a patient more harm than any exertion. Remember, he is face\r\nto face with his enemy all the time, internally wrestling with him,\r\nhaving long imaginary conversations with him. You are thinking of\r\nsomething else. Rid him of his adversary quickly is a first rule with\r\nthe sick.\" \"People who think outside their heads, who tell everything\r\nthat led them towards this conclusion and away from that, ought never to\r\nbe with the sick.\" \"A sick person intensely enjoys hearing of any\r\n_material_ good, any positive or practical success of the right. Do,\r\ninstead of advising him with advice he has heard at least fifty times\r\nbefore, tell him of one benevolent act which has really succeeded\r\npractically--it is like a day's health to him. You have no idea what the\r\ncraving of the sick, with undiminished power of thinking but little\r\npower of doing, is to hear of good practical action, when they can no\r\nlonger partake in it.\" The whole chapter, entitled \"Chattering Hopes and\r\nAdvices,\" from which this last extract is taken, is full of wit and\r\nwisdom. It could only have been written as the expression of an\r\nunderstanding mind and a sympathetic heart; just as the following\r\nchapter, \"Observation of the Sick,\" with its directions in the finer\r\ntechnique of nursing, could only have come from one of long and varied\r\nexperience in the practice of it.\r\n\r\nAnother of Miss Nightingale's characteristics--her taste for\r\nepigrammatic and often pungent expression--is conspicuous in _Notes on\r\nNursing_. \"Feverishness is generally supposed to be a symptom of fever;\r\nin nine cases out of ten, it is a symptom of bedding.\" \"No _man_, not\r\neven a doctor, ever gives any other definition of what a nurse should\r\nbe than this--'devoted and obedient.' This definition would do just as\r\nwell for a porter. It might even do for a horse. It would not do for a\r\npoliceman.\" \"Some 'obedient' nurses know no medium between 'Now no\r\nfire,' 'Now fire,' as if they were volunteer riflemen.\" \"It seems a\r\ncommonly received idea among men, and even among women themselves, that\r\nit requires nothing but a disappointment in love, or incapacity in other\r\nthings, to turn a woman into a good nurse. This reminds one of the\r\nparish where a stupid old man was set to be schoolmaster because he was\r\n'past keeping the pigs.'\" There is lively humour, too, in many of the\r\npersonal descriptions. Miss Nightingale quotes Lord Melbourne's saying:\r\n\"I would rather have men about me when I am ill; I think it requires\r\nvery strong health to put up with women.\"[334] \"I am quite of his\r\nopinion,\" she adds, and she gives some little word-pictures of the\r\nfemale nurse (old style). \"Compelled by her dress, every woman now\r\neither shuffles or waddles--only a man can cross the floor of a sick\r\nroom without shaking it.\" She was writing in the days of crinolines, and\r\ndraws a picture of \"respectable elderly women stooping forward,\" when\r\ninvested therein. Another picture is of the nurse who is supposed, \"like\r\nport-wine,\" to improve with age. We are not told the circumstances, but\r\nwe are assured that it was a \"fact\" that a nurse, when ordered to\r\nadminister brandy-and-water to a fainting patient, supplied the last\r\nweek's _Punch_. Then there is a description of the mincing nurse, with\r\n\"an affectedly sympathizing voice, like an undertaker's at a funeral.\"\r\nAll Miss Nightingale's pictures were drawn from life. \"I wonder,\" wrote\r\none of her friends, \"if the originals will recognise themselves.\"\r\n\r\n  [334] The saying is recorded in C. R. Leslie's _Autobiographical\r\n        Recollections_, vol. i. p. 169, as made to Lady Holland. \"Oh!\" said\r\n        the lady, tapping him with her fan, \"you have lived among such a\r\n        rantipole set.\" \"I happen to know,\" wrote Monckton Milnes to Miss\r\n        Nightingale, \"who Lord Melbourne's nurse was.\"\r\n\r\nNo one, then, could read the _Notes on Nursing_ without perceiving that\r\nthe author was a woman of marked ability, of wisdom, and of true\r\ngoodness. The book does not of itself prove Miss Nightingale's power of\r\nadministration or resolute will; for a woman, or a man, may be decisive\r\nof speech without being masterful in action; but with this exception the\r\nreviewer was right who said that the book was \"enough to explain the\r\nsuccess\" which Miss Nightingale had attained. The book points even more\r\nclearly to one of the main lines on which she was to work in the future.\r\nNo one could read it without perceiving that nursing, as explained and\r\ntaught by Miss Nightingale, must be a very delicate, and a very\r\ndifficult, art. It required a sound mastery of the laws of household\r\nhygiene, some knowledge of medicine or surgery, and, above all, an acute\r\nand sympathetic faculty of observation. \"Merely looking at the sick is\r\nnot observing.\" It was obvious that if Miss Nightingale's ideal of\r\nnursing was to be realized, the nurse required both training and\r\ninspiration. Nursing was an art, and like any other art, \"from a\r\nshoemaker's to a sculptor's, needed in its votaries the sense of a\r\n'calling,' and then a diligent apprenticeship.\" The way in which Miss\r\nNightingale translated her precepts into practice is the subject of the\r\nnext chapter. In _Notes on Nursing_, as in nearly everything that came\r\nfrom her pen, what she wrote had direct reference to action.\r\n\r\nIn a characteristic appendix to her _Notes on Nursing_, Miss Nightingale\r\ndiscusses \"Some Errors in Novels,\" pointing out, among other things, the\r\nuntruth of death-bed scenes in works of fiction. \"Shakespeare,\" she\r\nsays, \"is the only author who has ever touched the subject with truth,\r\nand his truth is only on the side of art.\" \"The best definition of a\r\nNurse,\" she wrote elsewhere,[335] \"can be found, as always, in\r\nShakespeare.\" It is in _Cymbeline_ that the ideal of a Nightingale nurse\r\nwas prefigured:--\r\n\r\n                        So kind, so duteous, diligent,\r\n                    So tender over his occasions, true,\r\n                    So feat, so nurse-like.\r\n\r\n  [335] Reprint from Quain's _Dictionary_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                          THE NIGHTINGALE NURSES\r\n\r\n                                (1860-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\n     Life is short and the art of healing is long.--HIPPOCRATES.\r\n\r\n\"The value of Hospitals as schools of surgery and medicine is hardly\r\ngreater than is their usefulness as a training for nurses, and the field\r\nis no less large. It is an employment suited to women. There has been an\r\nastonishing change in this matter since Miss Nightingale volunteered.\r\nThis change is perhaps the best fruit the past half century has to\r\nshow.\"[336] So writes one who has devoted laborious years to the\r\n\"Condition of England question.\" If it be as Mr. Charles Booth says,\r\nthen June 24, 1860, is a memorable day in the history of the nineteenth\r\ncentury[337]; for it is the day on which the Nightingale Training School\r\nfor Nurses was opened at St. Thomas's Hospital.\r\n\r\n  [336] _Life and Labour of the People in London._ Final volume, 1903,\r\n        p. 154.\r\n\r\n  [337] The 50th anniversary of the event, not noticed, I think, in\r\n        England, was celebrated in America: see Vol. II. p. 421.\r\n\r\nThis School was a direct outcome of Miss Nightingale's services in the\r\nCrimean War. The Nightingale Fund, amounting to £44,000, was a tribute\r\nfrom the British Empire to the Popular Heroine. The capital sum, after\r\ndefrayment of some expenses, was invested in the name of trustees, and a\r\nCouncil[338] was nominated by Miss Nightingale for the administration of\r\nthe Trusts to enable her to establish \"an Institution for the training,\r\nsustenance, and protection of Nurses and Hospital attendants.\" She\r\nintended, as we have heard,[339] to found or conduct such an\r\nInstitution on her own lines, and her first idea had been to become the\r\nSuperintendent of it herself.\r\n\r\n  [338] The Council consisted of Mr. Herbert, Mr. Bracebridge, Lord\r\n        Ellesmere, Sir Joshua Jebb, Sir James Clark, Dr. Bowman, the Dean\r\n        of Hereford, Sir John McNeill, and Dr. Bence Jones.\r\n\r\n  [339] Above, p. 269.\r\n\r\nOn returning from the East, however, Miss Nightingale was in weak\r\nhealth, and she became absorbed in the large and manifold labours for\r\nthe British Army which have already been described. She saw no early\r\nprospect of strength or time available for the superintendence of a new\r\nInstitution; she was unwilling that money subscribed for a public\r\npurpose should longer lie idle. In March 1858 she wrote in this sense to\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert,[340] the Chairman of the Council, begging to be\r\nrelieved from further responsibility in the matter, and asking that the\r\nCouncil should proceed to apply the Fund to such objects as it might\r\ndeem best. The Council, however, pointed out that the Fund was well\r\ninvested; that further delay would be partly compensated for by\r\naccumulation of resources, and that the contributors were anxious that\r\nMiss Nightingale's \"mind and intention should animate the work.\" They,\r\ntherefore, begged her to postpone a final decision, and to this\r\nsuggestion she acceded. But Miss Nightingale's labours for the Army\r\ncontinued, and her health did not improve. Her life indeed seemed to her\r\nmedical advisers to hang upon a slender thread; they thought that she\r\ncould only live for a few months. She became apprehensive lest death\r\nshould overtake her before she had impressed her mind and intention upon\r\nany application of the Nightingale Fund. In 1859 she set on foot\r\npreparations for doing something. A Sub-Committee of the Council was\r\nappointed, consisting of Mr. Herbert, Sir John McNeill, Sir James Clark,\r\nDr. Bowman, and Sir Joshua Jebb, with Mr. A. H. Clough as Secretary.\r\n\r\n  [340] \"Your letter strikes me,\" wrote Mr. Herbert (March 22), \"as a\r\n        little too curt for the occasion.\" He suggested another form of\r\n        words to her which she adopted.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to Miss Nightingale that it would be impossible for her,\r\nin view of the state of her health, to found an entirely new Institution\r\nunder her own superintendence. She saw that she must work through\r\nexisting hospitals and the agency of other persons. It was this latter\r\nconsideration that settled her choice of the place at which to found\r\nher Training School. She had naturally been besieged by suggestions from\r\nofficials of this hospital and of that, of this charity and the other,\r\neach urging that his or hers was the one pre-eminently suited to\r\nbenefactions from the Nightingale Fund. Her choice fell, for the main\r\napplication of the Fund, upon St. Thomas's Hospital. The Resident\r\nMedical Officer, Mr. R. G. Whitfield, was sympathetic. The Hospital was\r\nlarge, rich, and well managed. But, above all, the Matron was a woman\r\nafter Miss Nightingale's own heart, strong, devoted to her work, devoid\r\nof all self-seeking, full of decision and administrative ability. Of\r\nthis remarkable woman, Mrs. Wardroper, who for twenty-seven years was\r\nsuperintendent of the Nightingale School, Miss Nightingale has left a\r\ncharacter-sketch:--\r\n\r\n     I saw her first in October 1854, when the expedition of nurses was\r\n     sent to the Crimean War. She had been then nine months matron of\r\n     the great hospital in London, of which for 33 years she remained\r\n     head and reformer of the nursing. Training was then unknown; the\r\n     only nurse worthy of the name that could be given to that\r\n     expedition, though several were supplied, was a \"Sister\" who had\r\n     been pensioned some time before, and who proved invaluable.[341] I\r\n     saw her next after the conclusion of the Crimean War. She had\r\n     already made her mark; she had weeded out the inefficient, morally\r\n     and technically; she had obtained better women as nurses; she had\r\n     put her finger on some of the most flagrant blots, such as the\r\n     night nursing, and where she laid her finger the blot was\r\n     diminished as far as possible, but no training had yet been thought\r\n     of....\r\n\r\n     Her power of organization or administration, her courage, and\r\n     discrimination in character, were alike remarkable. She was\r\n     straight-forward, true, upright. She was decided. Her judgment of\r\n     character came by intuition, at a flash, not the result of much\r\n     weighing and consideration; yet she rarely made a mistake, and she\r\n     would take the greatest pains in her written delineations of\r\n     character required for record, writing them again and again in\r\n     order to be perfectly just, not smart or clever, but they were in\r\n     excellent language. She was free from self-consciousness; nothing\r\n     artificial about her. She did nothing, and abstained from nothing,\r\n     because she was being looked at. Her whole heart and mind, her\r\n     whole life and strength were in the work she had undertaken. She\r\n     never went a-pleasuring, seldom into society. Yet she was one of\r\n     the wittiest people one could hear on a summer's day, and had gone\r\n     a great deal into society in her young unmarried life. She was left\r\n     a widow at 42 with a young family. She had never had any training\r\n     in hospital life, there was none to be had. Her force of character\r\n     was extraordinary. Her word was law. For her thoughts, words and\r\n     acts were all the same. She moved in one piece. She talked a great\r\n     deal, but she never wasted herself in talking; she did what she\r\n     said. Some people substitute words for acts: _she_ never. She knew\r\n     what she wanted, and she did it. She was a strict disciplinarian;\r\n     very kind, often affectionate, rather than loving. She took such an\r\n     intense interest in everything, even in things matrons do not\r\n     generally consider their business, that she never tired. She had\r\n     great taste and spent her own money for the hospital. She was a\r\n     thorough gentlewoman, nothing mean or low about her; magnanimous\r\n     and generous, rather than courteous. And all this was done\r\n     quietly.... She had a hard life, but never proclaimed it. What she\r\n     did was done silently.[342]\r\n\r\n  [341] This was Mrs. Roberts: see above, pp. 185, 301.\r\n\r\n  [342] _British Medical Journal_, Dec. 31, 1892. Mrs. Wardroper retired\r\n        in 1887, and died in 1892.\r\n\r\nEvery artist, it has been said, in painting the portrait of a sitter,\r\npaints also something of his own portrait. Miss Nightingale's vigorous\r\ncharacter-sketch of her \"dear Matron\" is, I think, a case in point.\r\n\r\nAfter much consultation with Mrs. Wardroper and Mr. Whitfield of St.\r\nThomas's Hospital, and with Sir John McNeill and others outside, Miss\r\nNightingale formulated a scheme. The Committee of her Council met the\r\nGovernors of the Hospital, and an agreement was arrived at for the\r\nfoundation of the Nightingale School. The basis of the agreement was\r\nthat the Hospital was to provide facilities for the training, and the\r\nNightingale Fund to pay the cost, including the payment of the nurses\r\nthemselves. In May 1860, advertisements were inserted in the public\r\npress inviting candidates for admission, and on June 24 fifteen\r\nprobationers were admitted for a year's training. Thus on a modest\r\nscale, but with a vast amount of forethought, was launched the scheme\r\nwhich was destined to found the modern art and practice of nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThe essential principles of the scheme were stated by Miss Nightingale\r\nto be two: \"(1) That nurses should have their technical training in\r\nhospitals specially organized for the purpose; (2) That they should live\r\nin a home fit to form their moral life and discipline.\"[343] The scheme\r\nwas carefully adjusted to these two ends. The pupils served as assistant\r\nnurses in the wards of the Hospital. They received instruction from the\r\nSisters and the Resident Medical officer. Other members of the Medical\r\nStaff--namely, Dr. Bernays, Dr. Brinton, and Mr. Le Gros Clark--gave\r\nlectures. How seriously the pupils were expected to undertake their\r\nstudies, how strictly their superiors would watch their progress, is\r\nshown by the formidable \"Monthly Sheet of Personal Character and\r\nAcquirements of each Nurse\" which Miss Nightingale drew up for the\r\nMatron to fill in. The Moral Record was under five heads: punctuality,\r\nquietness, trustworthiness, personal neatness and cleanliness, and ward\r\nmanagement (or order). The Technical record was under fourteen main\r\nheads, some of them with as many as ten or twelve sub-heads:\r\n\"observation of the sick\" was especially detailed in this manner.\r\nAgainst each item of personal character or technical acquirement, the\r\nnurse's record was to be marked as Excellent, Good, Moderate, Imperfect,\r\nor 0. Those who \"passed the examiners,\" as it were, at the end of their\r\nyear's course, were placed on the Hospital Register as Certificated\r\nNurses. As rewards for good conduct and efficiency, the Council offered\r\ngratuities of £5 and £3, according to two classes of efficiency, to all\r\ntheir certificated nurses, on receiving evidence of their having served\r\nsatisfactorily in a Hospital during one entire year succeeding that of\r\ntheir training. Decidedly Miss Nightingale emphasized the educational\r\nside of her new experiment. No public school, university, or other\r\ninstitution ever had so elaborate and exhaustive a system of marks.\r\nEqually thorough and scientific are the \"General Directions\" which the\r\nResident Medical Officer presently drew up at Miss Nightingale's\r\nearnest request, \"For the Training of the Probationer Nurses in taking\r\nNotes of the Medical and Surgical Cases in Hospitals.\"\r\n\r\n  [343] _British Medical Journal_, Dec. 31, 1892.\r\n\r\nEqual care was taken to ensure Miss Nightingale's second principle. The\r\nHospital was to be a home as well as a school. The upper floor of a new\r\nwing of St. Thomas's Hospital was fitted up for the accommodation of the\r\npupils, so as to provide a separate bedroom for each, a common\r\nsitting-room, and two rooms for the Sister in charge of them. No pupil\r\nwas admitted without a testimonial of good character. Their board,\r\nlodging, washing, and uniform were provided by the Fund. They were given\r\n£10 for their personal expenses. The chaplain addressed them twice a\r\nweek. They were placed under the direct authority of the Matron, whose\r\ndiscipline (as will have been gathered from Miss Nightingale's\r\ncharacter-sketch) was strict. The least flightiness was reprimanded, and\r\nany pronounced flirtation was visited with the last penalty. \"Although,\"\r\nwrote the Matron to Miss Nightingale, with regard to one probationer, \"I\r\nhave not the smallest reason to doubt the correctness of her moral\r\ncharacter, her manner, nevertheless, is objectionable, and she uses her\r\neyes unpleasantly; as her years increase, this failing--an unfortunate\r\none--may possibly decrease.\" A girl who was detected in daily\r\ncorrespondence, and in \"walking out,\" with a medical student was\r\ndismissed. The nurses were only allowed to go out two together. \"Of\r\ncourse we part as soon as we get to the corner,\" said one of them at a\r\nlater time.\r\n\r\nWhen the probationers had finished their training, they were expected to\r\nenter into service as hospital nurses, or in such other situations in\r\npublic institutions as through the Council or otherwise might be offered\r\nto them. It was not intended that they should enter upon private\r\nnursing. This was an important point in Miss Nightingale's scheme. She\r\nhad it in her mind from the first that her Training School should in its\r\nturn be the means of training elsewhere. She wanted to sow an acorn\r\nwhich might in course of time produce a forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the scheme which was started on June 24, 1860. Miss\r\nNightingale, confined to her room, was unable to visit the Hospital; but\r\nevery detail was thought out by her. She took constant counsel from her\r\nfriend Miss Mary Jones, at King's College Hospital, who gave her\r\nvaluable suggestions, and she had eyes and ears to serve her everywhere.\r\nHer friend Mrs. Bracebridge visited the dormitory, and pronounced it\r\nexcellent. On the day after the opening, Mrs. Wardroper reported that\r\nDr. Whitfield was as hearty in the cause as herself. They both felt it\r\nto be an honour that St. Thomas's had been selected for the experiment,\r\nthough it was an honour which \"would subject them to rather harsh\r\ncriticism.\" Outside opinion, however, was favourable. \"I must send a few\r\nlines,\" wrote Sir William Bowman (Aug. 25, 1860), \"to say how much\r\nsatisfied I was yesterday with all I saw of your nurses at St. Thomas's.\r\nAs far as a cursory inspection could go, everything seemed perfect as to\r\norder, cleanliness, and propriety of demeanour. Your costume I\r\nparticularly liked,--I suppose I must not say, admired. Two or three of\r\nyour probationers whom I spoke to impressed me favourably. They seemed\r\nearnest and simple-minded, intelligent and nice-mannered. Altogether the\r\nexperiment seemed to be working well, considering the difficulties it is\r\nbeing tried under. The 'sisters' I could judge nothing about. Mrs.\r\nWardroper I was much pleased with, and wish she had sole charge without\r\n'mediums.' The dormitory I liked much.\" A writer in a popular magazine\r\ngave a glowing account of the Nightingale School. \"The nurses wore a\r\nbrown dress, and their snowy caps and aprons looked like bits of extra\r\nlight as they moved cheerfully and noiselessly from bed to bed.\"[344]\r\nMiss Nightingale sent books, prints, maps, and flowers for the nurses'\r\nquarters. \"I do not for one moment think,\" wrote Mrs. Wardroper, \"that\r\nyou wish to spoil them by over indulgence, but I very much fear they\r\nwill sadly miss your considerate kindness when they go from us.\"\r\nAlready (Jan. 1861), the Matron was receiving applications from country\r\nhospitals for nurses to be sent after the year's training. Miss\r\nNightingale's demand for detailed information was almost insatiable.\r\nEven the Monthly Report, with all its amplitude of heads and sub-heads,\r\nwas not enough. Mrs. Wardroper supplemented it by private reports. Miss\r\nNightingale suggested to her that she should encourage the nurses to\r\nkeep diaries which might afterwards be inspected. \"I am very pleased,\"\r\nwrote Mrs. Wardroper, after two or three years' trial (Jan. 11, 1863),\r\n\"that you approve of the diaries, and I am sure your approbation will\r\nstimulate them to increased perseverance.\" When Miss Nightingale\r\ndetected bad spelling, a probationer was given dictation lessons. Miss\r\nTerrot, a friend of Miss Nightingale, obtained admission to the Hospital\r\nas a supernumerary, and supplemented the Matron's reports. \"I am sorry,\"\r\nshe wrote in one of many letters, \"that the Probationers have lately\r\nbeen disposed to quarrel among themselves; I suppose where women live\r\ntogether, there will be jealousies and dislikes.\" Are sets and cliques\r\nand dislikes unknown where men live together? The first year's working\r\nof the experiment augured well, however, for the success of the scheme.\r\nAll the probationers who completed their course (13 out of the 15)\r\nexpressed their gratitude for the benefits they had received. Six were\r\nadmitted as full nurses in St. Thomas's Hospital. Two were appointed\r\nnurses in Poor Law Infirmaries, and applications were under\r\nconsideration for the placing of others.[345] The seed had been sown on\r\ngood ground.\r\n\r\n  [344] _St. James's Magazine_, April 1861. The writer was Mrs. S. C.\r\n        Hall.\r\n\r\n  [345] _Report of the Committee of the Council of the Nightingale Fund\r\n        for the year ending June 24, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nA little later, Miss Nightingale applied a portion of the Fund to\r\nanother purpose, which she had much at heart. This was the training of\r\nmidwives for service among the poor. Here, again, she worked through an\r\nexisting institution, and by the agency of a woman already known to her.\r\nThe Hospital selected for this experiment was that of King's College,\r\nwhere Miss Nightingale herself, before her call to the Crimea, had been\r\ninclined to serve. The nursing at King's College Hospital was undertaken\r\nby nurses trained at the St. John's House--an institution which had\r\nfurnished a contingent to Miss Nightingale's Crimean expedition. The\r\nnature of the experiment was explained by Miss Nightingale in a letter\r\nto Miss Harriet Martineau (Sept. 24, 1861):--\r\n\r\n     They are to be persons selected by country parishes between 26 and\r\n     35 years of age, of good health and good character, to follow a\r\n     course of _not less_ than 6 months' practical training, and to\r\n     conform to all the rules of St. John's House which nurses at King's\r\n     College Hospital. No further obligation is imposed upon them by us.\r\n     They are supposed to return to their parishes and continue their\r\n     avocation there. I am sorry that we shall be obliged to require a\r\n     weekly sum for the board which will be merely the cost price--not\r\n     less than 8s. or more than 9s. a week. Our funds do not permit us,\r\n     at least at first, to do this cost free. For (the Hospital being\r\n     very poor) we have had to furnish the Maternity Ward and are to\r\n     maintain the Lying-in beds. In fact, we establish this branch of\r\n     the Hospital which did not exist before. The women will be taught\r\n     their business by the Physician-Accoucheurs themselves, who have\r\n     most generously entered, heart and soul, into the plan, at the\r\n     bed-side of the Lying-in patients in this ward, the entrance to which\r\n     is forbidden to the men-students. And they will also deliver poor\r\n     women at their own homes, out-patients of the Hospital. The Head Nurse\r\n     of the Ward, who is paid by us, will be an experienced midwife, so\r\n     that the pupil-Nurses will never be left to their own devices. They\r\n     will be entirely under the Lady Superintendent--certainly the best\r\n     moral trainer of women I know. They will be lodged in the Hospital,\r\n     close to her. If I had a young sister, I should gladly send her to\r\n     this school--so sure am I of its moral goodness; which I mention,\r\n     because I know poor mothers are quite as particular as rich ones, not\r\n     merely as to the morality but as to the prosperity of their daughters.\r\n     In nearly every country but our own there is a Government School for\r\n     Midwives. I trust that our School may lead the way towards supplying a\r\n     want long felt in England. Here we experiment; and if we succeed, we\r\n     aresure of getting candidates. I am not sure this is not the best way.\r\n\r\nThe quiet beginning and the principle that nothing second-best is good\r\nenough for the people are very characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nThe experiment at King's College Hospital, which began in October 1861,\r\nhad to be abandoned after six years' successful working owing to an\r\nepidemic of puerperal fever in the wards; but that at St. Thomas's\r\nflourishes to this day on an enlarged scale, and throughout Miss\r\nNightingale's active years occupied a constant share of her thoughts and\r\npersonal attention. From 1872 onwards she wrote, as we shall hear later,\r\na New Year's Address, whenever health and time permitted, to the\r\nNightingale Nurses, constantly inculcating high ideals, and giving\r\npersonal inspiration to the order which bore her name. Every year as it\r\npassed carried into wider circles her scheme of affording to women\r\ndesirous of working as hospital nurses the means of obtaining a\r\npractical and scientific training, and of raising by degrees the\r\nstandard of education and character among nurses as a class. From year\r\nto year the other hospitals were assisted from the mother school with\r\ntrained superintendents and staff, and new centres were formed with the\r\nsame objects,[346] and it may well be said that the seed thus sown by\r\nMiss Nightingale through the means of the Fund has been mainly\r\ninstrumental in raising the calling of nurses to the position it now\r\nholds. So said the Council of the Fund in their Report for the year in\r\nwhich Miss Nightingale died; and the facts collected in histories of\r\nmodern nursing fully bear out their statement. In many cases Nightingale\r\nnurses were sent out in groups, as we shall hear in a later chapter, to\r\ninitiate reform in other institutions. In the British Colonies and the\r\nUnited States the \"Nightingale power\" worked in a similar way. Colonial\r\nhospitals went to the Nightingale School for their superintendents.\r\n\"Miss Alice Fisher, who regenerated Blockley Hospital (Philadelphia),\r\nwas a Nightingale nurse, and Miss Linda Richards, the pioneer nurse of\r\nthe United States, enjoyed the advantage of post-graduate work in St.\r\nThomas's, and of Miss Nightingale's personal kindly interest and\r\nencouragement.\"[347] Nor was the influence of her scheme confined to\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon world. In Germany, in France, in Austria, and in other\r\ncountries, the training of nurses similarly followed Miss Nightingale's\r\nlead. Thus did the seed which Florence Nightingale transplanted from\r\nKaiserswerth grow up in other soil and with different development into a\r\nmighty tree with many branches.\r\n\r\n  [346] On April 11, 1861, Sir James Paget wrote to Miss Nightingale\r\n        begging her to send him a scheme as \"Bartholomew's is beginning to\r\n        consider the training of nurses.\"\r\n\r\n  [347] _History of Nursing_, vol. ii. p. 184.\r\n\r\nIn these days, when all our great hospitals have their training schools\r\nfor nurses, when the tendency is towards increasing the requirements\r\nbeyond the standard described in this chapter, and when nursing has\r\nbecome a highly organized profession, it requires some effort to realize\r\nhow novel, and even how daring, was the work of the founder of modern\r\nnursing. Just as a Colonel of the old school helped us to understand the\r\ndifficulties of Miss Nightingale's experiment in the Crimean War, so a\r\nSurgeon of the old school wrote a little book which is invaluable in\r\nhelping us to realize the novelty of her experiment in St. Thomas's\r\nHospital. This is the book by Mr. South, to which I have already\r\nreferred. He was of the highest distinction in his profession; Hunterian\r\norator and twice President of the College of Surgeons. He was also\r\nSenior Surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, a fact which perhaps explains\r\nMrs. Wardroper's anticipation of \"rather harsh criticism\"; for Mr. South\r\nwas strongly, and even bitterly, opposed to the whole idea of the\r\nNightingale Fund, and of any new provision for the training of nurses.\r\nHe was \"not at all disposed to allow that the nursing establishments of\r\nour hospitals are inefficient, or that they are likely to be improved by\r\nany special institution for training.\" He believed that the nursing at\r\nSt. Thomas's was good (as indeed in many respects it was), and he did\r\nnot perceive that what the Nightingale Fund had in view was to raise the\r\ngeneral level, and to send out from St. Thomas's trained nurses, who in\r\ntheir turn would train other nurses elsewhere. Perhaps, if he had\r\nperceived this, he would have regarded it as superfluous. His point of\r\nview was that of the man who finds the world very well as it is. I have\r\ncited the pleasure with which certain army doctors in the East found in\r\nthe fact that few of their colleagues had subscribed to the Nightingale\r\nFund. Mr. South found similar satisfaction in scanning the subscription\r\nlist at home. \"That this proposed hospital nurse-training scheme has not\r\nmet with the approbation or support of the medical profession is,\" he\r\nwrote, \"beyond doubt. The very small number of medical men whose names\r\nappear in the enormous list of subscribers to the fund cannot have\r\npassed unnoticed. Only three physicians and one surgeon from one\r\n(London) hospital, and one physician from a second, are found among the\r\nsupporters.\" Miss Nightingale's nursing work had the support of some\r\nleading doctors, but I suppose we must take Mr. South's word for it that\r\nthe medical profession as a whole was unsympathetic or hostile towards\r\nreforms which in a later generation received general approbation. The\r\ndoctors do not stand alone among the professions in a tendency to oppose\r\nreforms. The hostility of lawyers to legal reform is almost proverbial;\r\nand as for the politicians, one-half of them is professionally engaged\r\nin predicting dire results from reforms introduced by the other half.\r\nAnd so it continues until the paradoxes of one generation become the\r\ncommonplaces of the next.\r\n\r\nBut if the course of political and social progress is strewn with the\r\nwrecks of predictions of ruin, neither is it free from the\r\ndisillusionments of reformers. Fears may be liars, but hopes are\r\nsometimes dupes. Miss Nightingale, as the founder of modern nursing,\r\nachieved great and beneficent results, but she lived to experience some\r\ndisappointments. Her standard was so high that she was more conscious of\r\nshortcoming than of achievement. We shall perhaps better understand her\r\nmind when we pass, in the next chapter, to consider the religious\r\nsanction and the ideal of human perfectibility which she had worked out\r\nfor herself in the world of thought, and which inspired her efforts in\r\nthe world of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n             THE RELIGIOUS SANCTION: \"SUGGESTIONS FOR THOUGHT\"\r\n\r\n                                  (1860)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   It fortifies my soul to know\r\n                   That, though I perish, Truth is so:\r\n                   That, howsoe'er I stray and range,\r\n                   Whate'er I do, Thou dost not change.\r\n                   I steadier step when I recall\r\n                   That, if I slip, Thou dost not fall.\r\n                                                  A. H. CLOUGH.\r\n\r\nThe life and work of Miss Nightingale, as described in the foregoing\r\nchapters of this Memoir, were such as were unlikely to have proceeded\r\nfrom any one who was not possessed by some strong spiritual impulse. It\r\nwas a life devoted to work, and in that work she sought and found\r\nherself. Yet from what is ordinarily called \"self-seeking\" her work was\r\nconspicuously free. The body was so weak that the wonder is how a woman\r\nin delicate health was able to perform so much of what Sidney Herbert\r\ncalled \"a man's work\" in the world. She was supported, sustained,\r\ninspired by great spiritual force and energy, which drove her to seek\r\nself-satisfaction in a dedicated life of work, and which in its turn\r\nfound expression in a form of religion, independently attained and\r\nintensely held.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter I have traced the development of Miss\r\nNightingale's religious views during her earlier years, and have shown\r\nhow they broadened out into a tolerance which took more account of deeds\r\nthan of creeds. But, as was there said, she was interested in creeds\r\nalso.[348] Her nature was profoundly religious, and she had a mind as\r\napt for speculative as for practical thought. Her critical spirit had\r\ndetected weak places, as she deemed them, in the creed alike of\r\nProtestants and of Catholics. The precise and practical bent of her mind\r\ncould not be satisfied until she had found for the feelings of her heart\r\nsome more logical basis. She was thus driven forward to that\r\nreconstruction of her religious creed, to which passing reference has\r\nalready been made. At the beginning of her diary for 1853, on a page\r\nplaced opposite January for \"Memoranda from 1852,\" there is this entry:\r\n\"The last day of the old year. I am so glad this year is over.\r\nNevertheless it has not been wasted, I trust. I have remodelled my whole\r\nreligious belief from beginning to end. I have learnt to know God. I\r\nhave recast my social belief; have them both written for use, when my\r\nhour is come.\" This entry refers to the manuscripts called respectively\r\n\"Religion\" and \"Novel\" in a letter of 1852, already cited.[349] The\r\nmanuscripts, after being read by one or two friends, remained for some\r\nyears in Miss Nightingale's desk, though during that period of strenuous\r\nactivity in the world of deeds the subject-matter, we may be sure, often\r\noccupied her thoughts. In 1858 and 1859 she took up the manuscripts\r\nagain. The companionship of Arthur Hugh Clough, who at this time was\r\nmuch with her, was doubtless one of the causes which led to an active\r\nresumption of her theological speculations. She was rereading Mill's\r\n_Logic_ and reading Edgar Quinet's _Histoire de mes idées_. Mr. Clough's\r\nnotes of conversation with her show how much she was indebted in her\r\nspeculations to Mill. \"Quinet and J. S. Mill,\" wrote Mr. Clough (March\r\n2, 1859), \"seemed, she said, the two men who had the true belief about\r\nGod's laws. She referred in particular to two chapters in Mill's _Logic_\r\nabout Free Will and Necessity, which seemed to her to be the beginning\r\nof the true religious belief. The excellence of God, she said, is that\r\nHe is inexorable. If He were to be changed by people's praying, we\r\nshould be at the mercy of who prayed to Him. It reminded her, she said,\r\nof what old James Martin said some years ago when she saw him--that he\r\ndidn't like having dissenters praying--he liked to have the prayers all\r\nset down and arranged: he didn't know what people mightn't be praying,\r\nperhaps that the money might be taken out of _his_ pocket and put into\r\n_theirs_.\" She rewrote some of what had been written six or seven years\r\nbefore; and she added a great deal more. Towards the end of 1859 she\r\nbegan printing it. In the following year the whole was in type, and a\r\nvery few copies were struck off. This book, entitled _Suggestions for\r\nThought_, is in three volumes, comprising in all 829 large octavo pages.\r\nIt was never published by her. It has with conspicuous merits equally\r\nconspicuous defects. The merits are of the substance; the defects are of\r\nform and arrangement; but Miss Nightingale never found time or strength\r\nor inclination--I know not which or how many of the three were\r\nwanting--to remove the defects by recasting the book. Unpublished,\r\ntherefore, it is likely, I suppose, to remain. But as it stands it is a\r\nremarkable work. No one, indeed, could read it without being impressed\r\nby the powerful mind, the spiritual force, and (with some\r\nqualifications) the literary ability of the writer. If she had not\r\nduring her more active years been absorbed in practical affairs, or if\r\nat a later time her energy or inclination had not been impaired by\r\nill-health, Miss Nightingale might have attained a place among the\r\nphilosophical writers of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n  [348] Above, p. 57.\r\n\r\n  [349] Above, p. 119.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nIn 1860, at the time when Miss Nightingale put her _Suggestions for\r\nThought_ into type, she was half-inclined to publish the work. She\r\nconsulted some of her intimate friends on the point. She also submitted\r\nthe manuscript to two famous men, than whom none were better qualified\r\nto give a just opinion--John Stuart Mill and Benjamin Jowett. With Mr.\r\nMill she was not personally acquainted, and she sought an introduction\r\nthrough her friend Mr. Chadwick. By way of breaking the ground, he sent\r\nto Mill a copy of _Notes on Nursing_. Mill promised to read the book\r\nimmediately, though (he added) \"I do not need it to enable me to share\r\nthe admiration which is felt towards Miss Nightingale more universally I\r\nshould imagine than towards any other living person.\" This expression\r\nmust have pleased her, for she was a diligent reader and (with some\r\ndifferences of opinion) a warm admirer of Mill's books. Being thus\r\nassured of his good will, and being further informed through Mr.\r\nChadwick that no formal introduction was necessary if Miss Nightingale\r\nconceived that Mr. Mill could be of any service to her, she sent him a\r\ncopy of the _Suggestions_, or rather, of a portion of them. He read it,\r\nand was greatly interested; so much so that, in addition to sending her\r\na letter of general criticism, he was at the pains to annotate it in the\r\nmargin. He hoped that he might be allowed to see the remainder. A\r\nperusal of this increased his high opinion. \"I have seldom felt less\r\ninclined to criticize,\" he said, \"than in reading this book.\" But one or\r\ntwo criticisms he did offer--\"for your consideration,\" he said, \"and not\r\nas pretending to lay down the law on the subject to any one, much less\r\nto you\";[350] and he invited further correspondence. Miss Nightingale's\r\nessays remained in his mind, for in a famous book, published nine years\r\nlater, he introduced an allusion to them.[351]\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Jowett, Miss Nightingale was introduced by Mr. Clough, who had\r\nasked him to read some of the _Suggestions_. \"It seemed to me,\" he said\r\nto Mr. Clough, after reading it, \"as if I had received the impress of a\r\nnew mind.\"[352] His interest in such philanthropic efforts as those\r\nconnected with the name of Florence Nightingale is reflected in a\r\npassage in the famous \"Essay on Interpretation,\"[353] and he must have\r\nbeen the more interested in the _Suggestions_ when Mr. Clough told him\r\nthat she was the author, and asked him to write to her about them. Her\r\nname for the book in familiar letters was the \"Stuff,\" by which name\r\nalso it is spoken of in her Will. \"I write to thank you,\" said Mr.\r\nJowett in one of the earlier letters of a long series (April 6, 1861),\r\n\"for the 'Stuff,' to which I shall venture to add the epithet\r\n'precious.'\" He thought as highly of the book as did Mr. Mill, though in\r\na different way. And he, too, in addition to long letters of general\r\ndiscussion suggested by the book, annotated it in detail. His\r\nannotations are most voluminous and careful. They are admirable in\r\ncriticism, and from them alone a reader, not otherwise acquainted with\r\nMr. Jowett's work, might form a tolerably accurate idea of his character\r\nand modes of thought. The proof copy of \"The Stuff,\" with Mr. Jowett's\r\nannotations, was one of Miss Nightingale's most cherished possessions. I\r\nshall refer to some of the detailed criticisms later. \"I have ventured,\"\r\nhe said, \"to put down the criticisms which occur to me quite baldly;\r\nthey must not be supposed to be inconsistent with the greatest respect\r\nfor the mind and genius of the writer.\" The criticisms were many, and\r\noften far-reaching; but no less frequent are expressions such as \"Very\r\ngood,\" \"Very fine and noble.\"\r\n\r\n  [350] Mill's two letters on _Suggestions for Thought_ are those printed,\r\n        as \"To a Correspondent,\" at vol. i. pp. 238-242 of the _Letters of\r\n        John Stuart Mill_ (1910).\r\n\r\n  [351] _The Subjection of Women_, chap. iii. p. 144: \"A celebrated woman,\r\n        in a work which I hope will some day be published, remarks truly\r\n        that everything a woman does is done at odd times.\" A good deal of\r\n        Mill's treatment of this branch of his subject recalls Miss\r\n        Nightingale's _Suggestions_.\r\n\r\n  [352] _Life and Letters of Benjamin Jowett_, by Abbott and Campbell,\r\n        vol. i. p. 270.\r\n\r\n  [353] \"And there may be some tender and delicate woman among us, who\r\n        feels that she has a Divine vocation to fulfil the most repulsive\r\n        offices towards the dying inmates of a hospital, or the soldier\r\n        perishing in a foreign land\" (_Essays and Reviews_, 1860).\r\n\r\nOn the immediate question, To publish or not to publish? Mr. Mill and\r\nMr. Jowett gave what might at first sight appear to be very different\r\nadvice. Mr. Mill, after reading the first instalment of the book, said:\r\n\"If any part of your object in sending it was to know my opinion as to\r\nthe desirableness of its being published, I have no difficulty in giving\r\nit strongly in the affirmative\"; and in his next letter he said: \"If\r\nwhen I had only read the first volume I was very desirous that it should\r\nbe published, I am much more so after reading the second.\" Mr. Jowett,\r\non the other hand, was against publication. It is presumptuous, I fear,\r\nto pose as a Court of Appeal between two such judges, but I will hazard\r\nthe opinion that Mr. Jowett's was the better advice. And this is not\r\nquite so presumptuous as it may seem, for the fact is that, though Mr.\r\nMill wanted to see the book published, he would also have been glad to\r\nsee it recast. And, similarly, Mr. Jowett, though he urged that the book\r\nmust be recast, was very anxious that it should ultimately be published.\r\n\"I should be very sorry,\" he wrote at the end, \"if the greater part of\r\nthis book did not in some form see the light. I have been greatly struck\r\nby reading it, and I am sure it would similarly affect others. Many\r\nsparks will blaze up in people's minds from it.\" \"In point of\r\narrangement, indeed,\" wrote Mr. Mill, \"of condensation, and of giving,\r\nas it were, a keen edge to the argument, it would have much benefited by\r\nthe recasting which you have been prevented from giving it by a cause on\r\nall other accounts so much to be lamented. This, however, applies more\r\nto the general mode of laying out the argument than to the details.\" Mr.\r\nMill put admirably in these two sentences points which Mr. Jowett over\r\nand over again explained and illustrated, with the utmost care, in his\r\ndetailed annotations, and they are points which must strike every reader\r\nof Miss Nightingale's book. The repetitions are tiresome, nay almost\r\nintolerable, to any one who reads a considerable portion of it\r\nconsecutively, and Miss Nightingale, in a later letter to Madame Mohl,\r\nsays that she could not read the book herself. The argument in isolated\r\npassages, and sometimes in particular chapters, is closely knit, but in\r\nthe book taken as a whole it often loses itself in digressions, and\r\nthere is a lack of any consistent _ordo concatenatioque rerum_. The book\r\nis as remarkable for literary felicities in detail as it is deficient in\r\nthe art of literary arrangement.\r\n\r\nSome consideration of this point will serve to illustrate an aspect of\r\nMiss Nightingale's character. The defect which Mr. Mill and Mr. Jowett\r\nsaw in her _Suggestions for Thought_ might seem to be among the last to\r\nbe expected in her. Her mind was singularly methodical and orderly; this\r\nwas one of the essential characteristics of her work as an administrator\r\nand a reformer. In this very book the characteristic appears, though in\r\na somewhat superficial form. Each volume is prefaced by an elaborate\r\n\"Digest,\" with many divisions and subdivisions. Yet the fact remains\r\nthat the appearance of close method does not correspond with any\r\nsimilarly close arrangement of the material. It may be said that the\r\nsubject-matter is less tractable by methodic heads and sub-heads than\r\nthe organization of a department or the arrangement of a hospital. And\r\nthat is true; but it is worth noting that something of the same\r\ncriticism that was made by Mr. Mill and Mr. Jowett upon Miss\r\nNightingale's _Suggestions for Thought_ was made by another able man\r\nupon her _Notes on the Army_. \"I consider them deficient,\" wrote Sir\r\nJohn McNeill (Nov. 18, 1858), \"in a certain form of artistical skill or\r\nart, and chargeable with frequent repetitions, but I confess that these\r\ndeficiencies constitute to my mind some of their greatest charms. They\r\ngive to the whole the most unmistakable stamp of earnestness and\r\ntruth--such as no reader of ordinary perception can doubt. They must, I\r\nthink, in every class of mind produce the conviction that you were\r\nexclusively occupied with the good you might do, and not at all with\r\nyour reputation as an artist.\" This apology is perfectly valid in\r\nrelation to the particular work in question, and Sir John might have\r\nadded another. The _Notes on the Army_ were a series of reports, of\r\nwhich indeed the whole should have been read consecutively by the\r\nSecretary of State, but each of which referred to a different branch of\r\nthe War Department. But the case is different when we pass to a\r\nphilosophic treatise which is addressed to thinkers. Some of the lack of\r\nsustained coherence in Miss Nightingale's _Suggestions for Thought_, and\r\nmany of its repetitions, may be referred to the method of composition.\r\nDifferent chapters were written at different times. But when she thought\r\nof publishing it, she did not care to correct those defects. Why was\r\nthis? The explanation is to be found, I think, partly in a view which\r\nshe had come to hold of the literary art, and partly in a certain\r\nimpetuosity of temper. She had put literary pursuits away from her as a\r\nvain temptation. She cared for writing only as a means to action, and\r\nshe could not see that literary form is of the essence of the matter if\r\nwriting is to influence current thought on difficult subjects.\r\nInfinitely laborious, again, when action was in sight, and capable of\r\ninfinite patience when she saw the need, she was content to throw out\r\nher thoughts careless of the form. There is a complete and consistent\r\nscheme underlying her _Suggestions_; it was ever present in her own\r\nmind; and she could not be troubled to pare and prune, to revise and\r\nrecast, in the interests of what she despised as mere artistry. _Non\r\nomnia possumus_. Those who are capable of completion in one field are\r\noften impatient of it in another. Ruskin, so careful of finish in his\r\nliterary craftsmanship, was asked why he so seldom finished his\r\ndrawings \"to the edges.\" \"Oh,\" he replied, \"I can't be bothered to do\r\nthe tailoring.\" Mr. Jowett urged Miss Nightingale in one of his letters\r\n(Nov. 17, 1861) to devote time and trouble to improving the form of her\r\n_Suggestions_: \"No one can get the form in which it is necessary to put\r\nforth new ideas without great labour and thought and tact. It takes\r\nyears after ideas are clear in your own mind to mould them into a shape\r\nintelligible to others.\" Miss Nightingale's answer to Mr. Jowett is not\r\nin existence; but I imagine that it was to the effect that she had no\r\ntime for the tailoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe difference in the advice given by Mr. Mill and Mr. Jowett\r\nrespectively went deeper, however, than to the question of form. And\r\nhere again a consideration of the point will throw light on Miss\r\nNightingale's character. The book was ostensibly one of Reconstruction;\r\nit was in fact very largely one of Revolt. The First and the Third\r\nVolumes are a philosophical exposition of her creed--\"Law, as the basis\r\nof a New Theology.\" The Second, devoted to \"Practical Deductions,\" is a\r\ncriticism of the religion and social life of her day. The criticism,\r\nunder both heads, is scathing and full of touches of her\r\ncharacteristically caustic humour. This second volume includes a full\r\ndiscussion of the position of women, and a plea for their emancipation\r\nfrom many of the restrictions of the time. It is easy to see how much of\r\nthis appealed strongly to Mr. Mill, and why he deemed its publication\r\ndesirable. And it is equally easy to understand that much of it offended\r\nMr. Jowett, and why he deemed revision essential. I shall not presume on\r\nthis point to decide between her counsellors. As her biographer, I\r\ncontent myself with recording that the plea for moderation, for\r\nconciliation, for suavity which Mr. Jowett urged in scores of marginalia\r\nand in dozens of letters seems to have prevailed. The essence of the\r\nplea was that the new should as far as possible be grafted upon the old;\r\nit was a plea for accommodation. Miss Nightingale had ideas which were\r\nof real value, but they would not avail to modify and purify religious\r\nthought if they were presented in too combative and revolutionary a\r\nform. One passage, though not among those to which Mr. Jowett more\r\nparticularly objected, will serve to illustrate his point of view. I\r\nselect it because it is characteristic of the writer's humour. It is\r\nfrom a section entitled \"John Bull and his Church\":--\"John Bull will\r\nhave plenty for his money. He will have his services long, till he is\r\nquite tired, that he may have his money's worth; like his concerts,\r\nplenty in them; no cheating; till he goes home yawning. So he has his\r\nconfession, lumping all his sins together, and then his absolution, and\r\nthen his praise, and then his Litany, asking for every imaginable thing,\r\nand ending with asking God for 'mercy on _all_ men,' lest he should have\r\nleft out anything, till there does not remain to God the smallest choice\r\nor judgment; and then his sermon--a long one--three services in\r\none,--that he may not have put on his best clothes nor paid all his\r\ntithes for nothing.\" No person blessed with any sense of humour is\r\nlikely to find this passage offensive; but Mr. Jowett objected to it\r\nbecause it is not historically true. \"J. B. had a Church and Liturgy\r\nmade for him by Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, and human nature in\r\nChurches is conservative.\" And generally Mr. Jowett asked Miss\r\nNightingale \"not to find fault with the times or with anybody, but to\r\nendeavour out of the elements that exist to reconstruct religion.\"\r\nTheology is a progressive science. Each age adds something to the idea\r\nof God. Let Miss Nightingale seek to win converts by leading them gently\r\nby the hand, not, as it were, by knocking them upon the head. She had\r\npeculiar advantages for doing this. Let her be very careful not to throw\r\nthem away. So did Mr. Jowett reason with her. The point is put in\r\ninnumerable forms; but this paragraph from a letter already mentioned\r\n(Nov. 17, 1861) will serve as a type: \"I should not much care if only a\r\ncomparatively small part of your work is finished. Its greatest value\r\nwill be that it comes from you who worked in the Crimea. Shall I say one\r\nodd and perhaps rather impertinent thing? You have a great advantage in\r\nwriting on these subjects as a Woman. Do not throw it away, but use the\r\nadvantage to the utmost. In writing against the World ('Athanasia\r\ncontra mundum'), every feeling, every sympathy should be made an ally,\r\nso that with the clearest statement of the meaning there is the least\r\nfriction and drawback possible.\" Whether it was Mr. Jowett's criticism\r\nthat alone or mainly caused Miss Nightingale to abandon the idea of\r\npublishing her _Suggestions for Thought_, I do not know.[354] But two\r\nthings may be said. Only once, so far as I have traced, did she take the\r\nworld at all into her confidence on the subject of her religious\r\nbeliefs. It was twelve years later, in some articles in _Fraser's\r\nMagazine_, to which we shall come in due course. In those articles the\r\nfundamental doctrines of the _Suggestions for Thought_ are contained,\r\nbut they are stated in a manner and a temper which show that she had\r\ngiven heed to the \"mild wisdom\" of Mr. Jowett. The other thing that may\r\nbe said is that for Mr. Jowett personally Miss Nightingale felt from the\r\nfirst a high regard. At the time with which we are now concerned, they\r\nknew each other by correspondence only, though, of course, Mr. Clough\r\nwould have had much to tell her of his friend. \"I do so like Mr.\r\nJowett,\" she wrote at this time to a friend. And at the same time Mr.\r\nJowett wrote to her: \"I reckon you (if I may do so) among unseen\r\nfriends.\" Presently they met; the friendship ripened, and remained firm\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, then, in addition to her other activities, is to be\r\nreckoned among the strenuous Seekers after Truth in religion and\r\nphilosophy. The _Suggestions_ had their immediate origin, as I have\r\nexplained already,[355] in a desire to meet by some positive\r\nreconstruction the negative \"free-thinking\" among the working-classes,\r\nand the first volume was addressed, on the title-page and by a\r\ndedication, to \"The Artizans of England.\" Mr. Jowett criticized this\r\nrestricted appeal. \"A book cannot be written,\" he said, \"for the\r\nArtizans separated from the Educated classes; it must embrace them both.\r\nThere is one intellectual world with common ideas, and the more\r\npermanent part of that is the world of the higher classes. Therefore I\r\nwould urge you not to write for the Artizans, but to write for\r\neverybody.\" And Mr. Mill had written: \"There is much in the work which\r\nis calculated to do great good to many persons besides the artizans to\r\nwhom it is more especially addressed.\" There was some force too\r\n(especially in regard to the more abstract argument of the first and\r\nthird volumes) in what M. Mohl said, \"that she had set out to give the\r\nworking classes a religion, and that she gave them a philosophy\r\ninstead.\" The address of the book to Artizans became palpably untenable\r\nwhen Miss Nightingale passed in the second, and longest, volume to\r\n\"Practical Deductions,\" and to a criticism of life as lived among \"the\r\nupper ten.\" Her sense of humour perceived the incongruity, and the\r\nsecond and third volumes were addressed generally \"To Searchers after\r\nReligious Truth.\" The address \"to Artizans\" is only significant as\r\nillustrating a phase of Miss Nightingale's interests. The essential\r\nsignificance of the book in the story of her life is the revelation\r\nwhich it gives of her own mind in its search after truth, and of the\r\nconclusions in which she ultimately found support.\r\n\r\n[354] In some testamentary instructions, made early in 1862, she\r\nexpressed a desire that the \"stuff\" should be \"revised and arranged\r\naccording to the hints of Mr. Jowett and Mr. Mill, but without altering\r\nthe spirit according to their principles with which I entirely disagree.\r\nBut he who would have done this is gone\"--doubtless a reference to Mr.\r\nClough. In 1865 she asked Mr. Jowett himself if he would edit the\r\n\"stuff\" for her. But he remained of his former opinion that it required\r\nto be recast entirely: it was, he said (April 24), \"rather the\r\npreparation or materials of a book than a book itself.\"\r\n\r\n  [355] Above, p. 119.\r\n\r\nI have been much struck in reading the book by the number of\r\nillustrations which Miss Nightingale draws from nursing, medicine, and\r\nadministration. It may be said, I think, that the line of speculation\r\nfollowed in her _Suggestions for Thought_ was the result of reflection\r\nupon those data by a mind which was at once intensely spiritual and\r\nseverely logical. We come very near to the root of the thing in her mind\r\nin this passage of tender and yet humorous autobiography:--\r\n\r\n     When I was young, I could not understand what people meant by\r\n     \"their thoughts wandering in prayer.\" I asked for what I really\r\n     wished, and really wished for what I asked. And my thoughts\r\n     wandered no more than those of a mother would wander, who was\r\n     supplicating her Sovereign for her son's reprieve from\r\n     execution.... I liked the morning service much better than the\r\n     afternoon, because we asked for more things.... I was always\r\n     miserable if I was not at church when the Litany was said. How\r\n     ill-natured it is, if you believe in prayer, not to ask for\r\n     everybody what they want.... I well remember when an uncle died,\r\n     the care I took, on behalf of my aunt and cousins, to be always\r\n     present in spirit at the petition for \"the fatherless children and\r\n     widows\"; and when Gonfalonieri was in the Austrian prison of\r\n     Spielberg, at that for \"prisoners and captives.\" My conscience\r\n     pricked me a little whether this should extend to those who were in\r\n     prison for murder and debt, but I supposed that I might pray for\r\n     them spiritually. I could not pray for George IV. I thought the\r\n     people very good who prayed for him, and wondered whether he could\r\n     have been much worse if he had not been prayed for. William IV. I\r\n     prayed for a little. But when Victoria came to the throne, I prayed\r\n     for her in a rapture of feeling and my thoughts never wandered.\r\n\r\nTo this simple faith of youth, experience succeeded. A patient might\r\npray for sleep, but laudanum was more efficacious. What was the use of\r\npraying to be delivered from \"plague and pestilence\" so long as the\r\ncommon sewers were still allowed to run into the Thames? If God sent a\r\nvisitation of cholera, which was the more probable reading of His\r\nmind--that He sent it in order that men might pray to Him for relief\r\nfrom it, or in order that they should themselves set about removing the\r\npredisposing causes? Miss Nightingale's conclusion was that if there be\r\na Plan in the universe, the Plan must be other than what the popular\r\nreligion of the day, logically interpreted, implies. \"God's scheme for\r\nus,\" she inferred, \"was not that He should give us what we asked for,\r\nbut that mankind should obtain it for mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the germ from which Miss Nightingale's philosophy of religion\r\nwas developed. She had read much in metaphysics and in theology; she had\r\nreasoned long with herself\r\n\r\n              Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,\r\n              Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute.\r\n\r\nShe reasoned long, but did not feel herself \"in wandering mazes lost.\"\r\nShe began with considering the nature of Belief, and showed that any\r\ntrue explanation of the term throws us back on the nature of the object\r\nof belief. The supreme object of belief we call God. But in different\r\nages men have meant very different things by God. There is the Savage\r\nidea of God, the Hindoo, the Greek, the Israelite, and so forth; and\r\nthere is the Christian idea, which again is widely different according\r\nto the patristic or theological notions, and according to the popular\r\none. This last required to be exalted and purified. The true idea of\r\nGod, which is alone reconcilable with the deepest morality and with the\r\nwidest contemplation of nature and history and the world is the idea,\r\nnot of an individual swayed by likings and personalities, but of an\r\nUniversal Being who is Law.\r\n\r\nThe laws of God were, she held, discoverable by experience, research,\r\nand analysis; or, as she sometimes put it, the _character_ of God was\r\nascertainable, though His _essence_ might remain a mystery. The laws of\r\nGod were the laws of life, and these were ascertainable by careful, and\r\nespecially by statistical, inquiry. This is what I meant by saying in an\r\nearlier chapter that Miss Nightingale regarded the study of statistics\r\nwith something of religious reverence. Statistics compiled by\r\nmeteorologists have shown, she says in the _Suggestions_, that storms\r\ncan be foreseen. When a ship goes down in an \"unforeseen\" gale, \"Do we\r\nsay, 'How could God permit such a dreadful calamity as the loss of all\r\nhands on board? The devil must have done it.' No. We say, 'Study the\r\nsigns of approaching gales, and you will _not_ be lost.' Is it not the\r\nsame with moral evil, the laws of which are just as _calculable_?\" A\r\ncopy of Quetelet's book, already mentioned, had been presented to her\r\n\"with the author's homage, respect, and affection.\" She often spoke of\r\nthe Belgian statistician in similar terms. His book was in her eyes a\r\nreligious work--a revelation of the Will of God. In her annotated copy\r\nshe enlarged the title. The book was not merely an _Essai de physique\r\nsociale_. It exhibited \"The sense of Infinite power, The assurances of\r\nsolid Certainty, and The endless vista of Improvement from the\r\nPrinciples of _Physique sociale_, if only found possible to apply on\r\noccasions when it is so much wanted.\" A very large \"if,\" many will say;\r\nas in effect her father constantly said in written discussions with her\r\non these subjects. But her reply was always the same. The greater the\r\ndifficulty, the more the need for serious study. With the concentrated\r\nstudy of mankind upon the problem, the answer would be found. \"Truth is\r\n_so_,\" said her friend. \"Truth is not what one troweth,\" said she, and\r\nthere was no phrase oftener on her lips in serious conversation.\r\n\r\nShe went on to develop this idea of God as Law in relation to human\r\nfate, and to those problems of \"free will and necessity,\" which Milton\r\nthought to be inscrutable mysteries, and around which metaphysicians and\r\nlogicians have for ages disputed. She found her ultimate solution in a\r\nhypothesis which Mr. Mill told her that he had at one time tried but\r\nabandoned--the hypothesis of \"a Being who, willing only good, leaves\r\nevil in the world solely in order to stimulate human faculties by an\r\nunremitting struggle against every form of it\"; a Perfect Being who\r\ncreated a Perfectible one, and so ordered the world that its course\r\nshould be a constant struggle towards perfection. Miss Nightingale did\r\nnot blink the fact that her hypothesis left mysteries unexplained. The\r\nfinite cannot apprehend the Infinite. \"We cannot,\" she wrote,\r\n\"understand the existence of God willing laws. We cannot understand the\r\nPerfect Being. All this appears to me exactly what we ought to allow to\r\nbe a mystery.\"[356] But she held with Bossuet that _il ne faut pas\r\nconfondre la question de la nature de Dieu avec celle des rapports de\r\nDieu et du monde_. \"We ought,\" she continued, \"with all our mights to\r\nlearn the perfections, not to understand the Perfect--to study His\r\ncharacter and His laws, not His essence, or how He lives willing His\r\nlaws. It is evident that creation is a mystery, but God's end and object\r\n(in creating) need not be a mystery. Everybody tells us that the\r\nexistence of evil is incomprehensible, whereas I believe it is much more\r\ndifficult--it is impossible--to conceive the existence of God (or even\r\nof a good man) _without_ evil.\" Good and evil are relative terms, and\r\nneither is intelligible without the other.\r\n\r\n  [356] From a letter to her father.\r\n\r\nWithout supposing, then, that she had solved the ultimate riddle of the\r\nuniverse, Miss Nightingale had hold of an hypothesis which solved for\r\nher many of the mediate riddles. It seemed to her to contain a lofty\r\nconception of God; to justify His ways to men; to explain the supposed\r\nwar between Free Will and Necessity. Her views on some of these high\r\nmatters will perhaps be made clearer by the letter of explanation which\r\nshe wrote to her father in sending him a copy of some of her \"Stuff\":--\r\n\r\n     OLD BURLINGTON STREET, _July_ 6 [1859]. DEAR PAPA--I shall be so\r\n     pleased to send you some of my \"works,\" as you are so good as to\r\n     wish to read them. I have asked Aunt Mai to send you the shortest\r\n     [a portion of vol. i.]. I think the subject is this: Granted that\r\n     we see signs of _universal_ law all over this world, _i.e._ law or\r\n     plan or constant sequences in the moral and intellectual as well as\r\n     physical phenomena of the world--granted this, we must, in this\r\n     universal law, find the traces of _a_ Being who made it, and what\r\n     is more of the _character_ of the Being who made it. If we stop at\r\n     the superficial signs, the Being is something so bad as no human\r\n     character can be found to equal in badness, and certainly all the\r\n     beings He has made are better than Himself. But go deeper and see\r\n     wider, and it appears as if this plan of _universal_ law were the\r\n     only one by which a good Being could teach His creatures to teach\r\n     themselves and one another what the road is to universal\r\n     perfection. And this we shall acknowledge is the only way for any\r\n     educator, whether human or divine, to act--viz. to teach men to\r\n     teach themselves and each other. If we could not _depend_ upon God,\r\n     _i.e._ if this sequence were not _always_ to be calculated upon in\r\n     moral as well as in physical things--if He were to have caprices\r\n     (by some called _grace_, by others _answers to prayer_, etc.),\r\n     there would be no order in creation to depend upon. There would be\r\n     chaos. And the only way by which man can have Free Will, _i.e._ can\r\n     learn to govern his own will, to have what will he thinks _right_\r\n     (which is having his will free), is to have universal Order or Law\r\n     (by some miscalled Necessity). I put this thus brusquely because\r\n     philosophers have generally said that Necessity and Free Will are\r\n     incompatible. It seems to have appeared to God that Law is the only\r\n     way, on the contrary, to _give_ man his free will. And this I have\r\n     attempted to prove. And further that this is the only plan a\r\n     perfectly good omnipotent Being could pursue.... Ever, dear Papa,\r\n     your loving child, F. N.\r\n\r\nI need not enter into the fundamental difficulty which Mr. Mill found in\r\nthis last assumption, nor into the difficulties which Mr. Jowett pointed\r\nout, in a series of letters, in Miss Nightingale's reconciliation of\r\nFree Will and Necessity. Our concern here is with what she thought, and\r\nthe hypothesis satisfied her judgment.\r\n\r\nIt had the further result of giving her a rational basis for belief in a\r\nFuture Life. The chapter in which she discussed this subject seemed to\r\nMr. Jowett \"the most responsible and serious in the whole book.\" He made\r\nsome critical objections to details in the argument, but her general\r\nline was in accordance with what we know to have been his own conviction\r\non the subject, namely, that the evidence for a future life must be\r\nfound in moral ideas.[357] And in a letter to Miss Nightingale he says:\r\n\"I shall never give up the faith in immortality, though I cannot\r\ndetermine or conceive the manner of another state of being. That Christ\r\nbecame a mass of clay again seems to me of all incredible things the\r\nmost incredible.\" To Miss Nightingale the belief followed logically from\r\nher general hypothesis. The theory of Perfectibility required a future\r\nstate of infinite progress for each and all; the theory of a good God\r\nrequired it. The purpose of God, as she conceived it, is that in the end\r\n\"each and all shall in accordance with law desire and obtain to will\r\nright, all sin and sorrow being but one of the processes through which\r\nmankind is learning and teaching. Hence it is that belief in a future in\r\nconnexion with human existence is essential to the belief that we are\r\nunder righteous government.\" \"How plain,\" wrote Mr. Nightingale to his\r\ndaughter, after reading the chapter, \"are the steps of your argument!\r\nThe senses, the reason, the feelings appreciate the laws of goodness,\r\nbenevolence, and righteousness in the Thought of God; but Circumstances\r\nindicate a want of benevolence unless there is reason to believe in a\r\nfuture development. Therefore a continued existence is according to\r\nlaw.\" Mr. Jowett in his marginalia suggested that she might have made\r\nmore of the opposite alternative: \"If there is no future state, then\r\nwhat of God, what of human nature? Not only would there be an awful\r\ndeception, but a deception of all the best feelings and of those in\r\nwhich we most trust. Work out the supposition, and look it full in the\r\nface, and (whether right or wrong) it is hardly possible to suppress the\r\ntemper of a demon towards the Supreme being.\" So Miss Nightingale\r\nintensely thought; and, therefore, the idea of God as Universal Law,\r\nwilling human perfection, gave her even greater security than is put\r\nforward in the lines from Clough which I have placed at the head of this\r\nchapter. She quoted them herself, but added, \"Yes; but Truth is so that\r\n'I' shall _not_ perish.\"\r\n\r\n  [357] _Letters of Benjamin Jowett_, 1899, p. 245.\r\n\r\nHer speculations gave her a basis, further, for understanding what is\r\nmeant by a philosophy of history:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to her Father._) HAMPSTEAD, _Oct._ 24 [1861].\r\n     (Seven years this very day since I began \"the fight\" for the Army.)\r\n     I think Dicey's Cavour and Monckton Milnes's Tocqueville in the\r\n     _Quarterly_, the two most masterly sketches of a true Statesman I\r\n     have read for some time.[358] Cavour's death was heroic--in the\r\n     prime of his glory and success--working to the last. But I am not\r\n     sure that there is not something more heroic and more pathetic in\r\n     Tocqueville's, broken-hearted, but not in despair, faithful to the\r\n     end of the \"good fight\"--_lost_, although fought so well. People\r\n     call him narrow--_i.e._ people who are so wide that they can do\r\n     nothing themselves. The unheroic tone of the teachers of the\r\n     present day is bad; as when excellent Jowett says that in these\r\n     days, only \"exceptional\" cases can fight the good fight. Is not\r\n     this the reason why these cases _are_ exceptional? And was there\r\n     ever an age in so much need of heroism?\r\n\r\n     Most just is the praise to Tocqueville of imitating God in his\r\n     statesmanship--in reconciling Man's Free Will and God's Law--the\r\n     only mode in which God or statesman can govern. But he is unfair to\r\n     himself when he says he will not \"play the part of Providence.\" He\r\n     _did_, as far as he could. He is untrue to himself in saying how\r\n     little we can ever find out of the Laws of History. Undoubtedly we\r\n     have as yet found out hardly anything. (I suppose Buckle has some\r\n     of the crudest generalizations extant.) But, did we study history\r\n     as much as physical science, would this be so? Is it not like the\r\n     children who say, I'm too little (when told to do a difficult sum),\r\n     to attribute this to the \"inability of our reason.\" Surely God says\r\n     just the contrary. Tocqueville tells us not to call events\r\n     \"mysterious.\" He calls upon governments to comprehend the\r\n     mysterious influences--\"mysterious\" only to our ignorance. And I\r\n     would drop the word altogether. Perhaps Tocqueville was the first\r\n     statesman who united an acknowledgment of the fact that, according\r\n     to the laws of God, all human history could not have been other\r\n     than it has been, with the conviction that this, instead of\r\n     stimulating us to do nothing, stimulates us to do everything.\r\n\r\n  [358] The article on Cavour was in July; that on Tocqueville, in October.\r\n\r\nAbove all, her religious belief satisfied her as giving high motive to\r\nhuman conduct. It linked, in logical connection, the service of man to\r\nthe service of God. It inspired with religious enthusiasm her conviction\r\nthat each individual--woman as well as man--should be given the freedom\r\nto make the best of himself. The doing of God's will--that is, according\r\nto her philosophy, the discovery of causes and effects, the\r\nrectification of errors, the education of men to profit by their\r\nmistakes--was the way to communion with God. The reader may remember\r\nfrom previous chapters that Florence Nightingale was conscious of \"a\r\ncall from God to be a saviour,\" and that the tribute which she paid to\r\nher \"dear Master,\" Sidney Herbert, was to call him \"a saver.\" There are\r\npassages in the _Suggestions for Thought_ which show with what\r\nsignificance she used those terms. \"God's plan is that we should make\r\nmistakes, that the consequences should be definite and invariable; then\r\ncomes some Saviour, Christ or another, not one Saviour, but many an one,\r\nwho learns for all the world _by_ the consequences of those errors, and\r\n'saves' us from them.... There must be saviours from social, from moral,\r\nerror. Most people have not learnt any lesson from life at all--suffer\r\nas they may, they learn nothing, they would alter nothing.... We\r\nsometimes hear of men 'having given a colour to their age.' Now, if the\r\ncolour is a right colour, those men are saviours.\" Miss Nightingale's\r\nown work in the world--at Scutari, for the health of the British soldier\r\nat home, for Hospitals, for Nursing, and presently for India--received\r\nfrom her philosophy a religious sanction.[359]\r\n\r\n  [359] For an application of her religious views to the care of India,\r\n        see the passage quoted in vol. ii. p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nHow, if at all, it may be asked, did she adjust her innermost beliefs to\r\nthe current creeds of the day? I shall not attempt to define what she\r\ndid not define; but a few remarks may be made. Was she Unitarian or\r\nTrinitarian? I think that we may answer as we will. She was \"very sure\r\nof God,\" but very chary, as we have seen, of attempting to define His\r\nessence. Sometimes she seemed to think of God in a Unitarian sense; but\r\nthere is a passage in the _Suggestions_ in which she philosophizes the\r\nTrinity. \"The Perfect exists in three relations to other existence: (1)\r\nAs the Creator of all other existence, of its purpose, and of the means\r\nof fulfilling its purpose. This is the Father. (2) As partaken in these\r\nother modes of existence. This is the Son. (3) As manifested to these\r\nother modes of existence. This is the Holy Ghost.\" Then, again, was she\r\n\"Protestant\" or \"Catholic\"? She used language at different times which\r\nmight be interpreted in either direction; but she used it at all times\r\nwith some inner meaning of her own. Here is a letter which philosophizes\r\nan \"evangelical\" doctrine:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to her Father._) HAMPSTEAD, _Sept._ 26 [1863].\r\n     DEAR PAPA--I am sure that if any one finds nourishment in Renan or\r\n     in any book I should be very sorry to \"depreciate\" it. There is not\r\n     so much solid food in books nowadays, especially in religious\r\n     books, that we can afford to do so. I always think of Mad. Mohl's,\r\n     \"I don't want any book-writer to chew my food for me.\" Now nearly\r\n     all books are chewed food--especially religious books.... What I\r\n     dislike in Renan is not that it is fine writing, but that it is\r\n     _all_ fine writing. His Christ is the hero of a novel; he himself,\r\n     a successful novel-writer. I am revolted by such expressions as\r\n     _charmant_, _délicieux_, _religion du pur sentiment_, in such a\r\n     subject.... As for the \"religion of sentiment,\" I really don't know\r\n     what he means. It is an expression of Balzac's. If he means the\r\n     \"religion of love,\" I agree and do not agree. We _must love_\r\n     something _loveable_. And a religion of love must certainly include\r\n     the explaining of God's character to be something loveable--of\r\n     God's \"providence,\" which is the self-same thing as God's Laws, as\r\n     something loving and loveable. On the other hand I go along with\r\n     Christ, not with Renan's Christ, far more than most Christians do.\r\n     I do think that \"Christ on the Cross\" is the highest expression\r\n     hitherto of God--not in the vulgar meaning of the Atonement--but\r\n     _God_ does hang on the Cross _every day_ in _every one_ of us; the\r\n     whole meaning of God's \"providence,\" _i.e._ His laws, is the Cross.\r\n     When Christ preaches the Cross, when all mystical theology preaches\r\n     the Cross, I go along with them entirely. It is the self-same thing\r\n     as what I mean when I say that God educates the world by His laws,\r\n     _i.e._ _by sin_--that man must create mankind--that all this\r\n     _evil_, _i.e._ the Cross, is the proof of God's goodness, is the\r\n     _only_ way by which God could work out man's salvation without a\r\n     contradiction. You say, but there is too much evil. I say, there is\r\n     just enough (not a millionth part of a grain more than is\r\n     _necessary_) to teach man by his own mistakes,--by his _sins_, if\r\n     you will--to show man the way to _perfection in eternity_--to\r\n     perfection which is the only happiness....\r\n\r\nThere were many points, on the other hand, at which Roman Catholicism\r\nstrongly appealed to her. So marked is this attitude in the\r\n_Suggestions_--in passages sometimes ironical, sometimes serious--that\r\nat one of the latter places Mr. Jowett's note in the margin is: \"The\r\nenemy will say, This book is written by an Infidel who has been a\r\nPapist. But _I_ wish that there were more of these sort of reflections\r\nshowing the true relation of superstitious ideas to moral and spiritual\r\nreligion.\" I can well believe that her friend Cardinal Manning, for whom\r\nshe entertained a high respect (though she waged a battle-royal against\r\nhim on occasion[360]), may sometimes have regarded her as a likely\r\nconvert; but towards acceptance of Roman doctrines, I find no ground for\r\nthinking that she was at any time inclined. Yet the spirit of Catholic\r\nsaintliness--and especially that of the saints whose contemplative piety\r\nwas joined to active benevolence--appealed strongly to her. She read\r\nbooks of Catholic devotion constantly, and made innumerable annotations\r\nin them and from them. She was greatly attracted by the writings of the\r\nPort Royalists, on which subject there is a long correspondence with her\r\nfather. She admired intensely the aid which Catholic piety had given,\r\nand was to many of her own friends giving--to the Bermondsey Nuns,\r\nespecially, and to the Mother and Sisters of the Trinità de'\r\nMonti--towards purity of heart and the doing of everything from a right\r\nmotive. Then, again, to be \"business-like\" was with Miss Nightingale\r\nalmost the highest commendation; and in this character also the Roman\r\nChurch appealed to her. Its acceptance of doctrines in all their logical\r\nconclusions seemed to her business-like; its organization was\r\nbusiness-like; its recognition of women-workers was business-like.\r\n\r\n  [360] In 1867 he proposed to close the hospital which her friends the\r\n        Nuns of Bermondsey had opened in Great Ormond Street. They of\r\n        course \"went to Miss Nightingale.\" She persuaded Lady Herbert to\r\n        intercede for the nuns, but Manning would not yield further than\r\n        to refer the case to Rome. Miss Nightingale then organized a party\r\n        at Rome on the side of the nuns. There is an extensive\r\n        correspondence amongst her papers on this subject. She defeated\r\n        Manning in this matter.\r\n\r\nSo, then, Miss Nightingale was broad-minded in her attitude towards\r\ncreeds and churches. For her own part she believed that religious truth\r\nwas positive, and could be discovered; but in her outlook upon the\r\nbeliefs of others, she judged them by their fruits. She asked not so\r\nmuch what was a man's or a woman's religious formula, but whether it\r\nrenewed a right spirit within them. With religiosity, if it was centred\r\non self, she had no sympathy. \"Is there anything higher,\" she asked, \"in\r\nthinking of one's own salvation than in thinking of one's own dinner? I\r\nhave always felt that the soldier who gives his life for something which\r\nis certainly not himself or his shilling a day--whether he call it his\r\nQueen or his Country or his Colours--is higher in the scale than the\r\nSaints or the Faquirs or the Evangelicals who (some of them don't)\r\nbelieve that the end of religion is to secure one's own salvation.\"\r\nWithin the limits indicated by these remarks, she would have agreed a\r\ngood deal with what Mrs. Carlyle said to John Sterling: \"I confess that\r\nI care almost nothing about _what_ a man believes in comparison with\r\n_how_ he believes. If his belief be correct, it is much the better for\r\nhimself; but its intensity, its efficacy, is the ground on which I love\r\nand trust him.\"[361]\r\n\r\n  [361] _Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle_, 1883, vol. i.\r\n        p. 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nThere is a school of philosophy, much current in our day, which carries\r\nthis point of view further. The meaning of a conception, it tells us,\r\nexpresses itself in practical consequences, if the conception be true;\r\nreligious truth is relative to the individual; the way to test a\r\nreligion is to live it. If the philosophy of the pragmatists be right,\r\nthen few forms of religious creed can claim better witness to their\r\ntruth than that wherein Florence Nightingale lived and moved and had her\r\nbeing. She had \"remodelled her whole religious belief from beginning to\r\nend,\" and had \"learnt to know God\" in the years immediately preceding\r\nher active work in the world. Her belief helped to sustain her natural\r\ncourage amidst the horrors of Scutari, and the fever and the cold of\r\nBalaclava. It inspired the life of arduous labour to which she devoted\r\nherself on returning from the East. It informed her unceasing efforts\r\nfor the health of the Army and the people, for the reformation of\r\nhospitals, for the creation of an art of nursing. Does some one, echoing\r\nthe words of M. Mohl which I have quoted above, doubt whether any vital\r\nforce can have proceeded from a belief in Law as the Thought of God, and\r\nsuggest that to herself as to others she was offering a stone instead of\r\nbread? It was not so. To her the religion which she found was as the\r\nbody and blood of the Most High. It is impossible to doubt the spiritual\r\nintensity, the religious fervour, of passages such as these from the\r\npages in _Suggestions for Thought_ in which she describes \"Communion\r\nwith God\":--\r\n\r\n     If it is said \"we cannot love a _law_,\"--the mode in which God\r\n     reveals Himself--the answer is, we _can_ love the spirit which\r\n     originates, which is manifested in, the law. It is not the material\r\n     presence only that we love in our fellow-creatures. It is the\r\n     spirit, which bespeaks the material presence, that we love. Shall\r\n     we then not love the spirit of all that is loveable, which _all_\r\n     material presence bespeaks to us?... How penetrated must those have\r\n     been who first, genuinely, had the conception, who felt, who\r\n     thought, whose imaginations helped them to conceive, that the\r\n     Divine Verity manifests itself in the human, partakes itself,\r\n     becomes one with the human, descends into the hell of sin and\r\n     suffering with the human, by being \"verily and indeed taken and\r\n     received\" by the human!... We will seek continually (and stimulate\r\n     mankind to seek with us) to prepare the eye and the ear of the\r\n     great human existence that seeing it _shall_ perceive, and hearing\r\n     it _shall_ understand.... \"Whether we eat or drink, or whatsoever\r\n     ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" To do it \"to the glory of God\"\r\n     must be to fulfil the Lord's purpose. That purpose is man's\r\n     increase in truth, increase in right being. The history of mankind\r\n     should be, _will_ be one day, the history of man's endeavour after\r\n     increase of truth, and after a right nature.... What does ignorant\r\n     finite man want? How great, how suffering, yet how sublime are his\r\n     wants! Think of his wounded aching heart, as compared with the bird\r\n     and beast! his longing eye, his speaking countenance, compared with\r\n     these! _they_ show something of such difference, but nothing,\r\n     nothing compared with what is within, where no eye can read. What\r\n     then, poor sufferer, dost thou want? I want a wise and loving\r\n     counsellor, whose love and wisdom should come home to the whole of\r\n     my nature. I would work, oh! how gladly, but I want direction how\r\n     to work. I would suffer, oh! how willingly, but for a purpose....\r\n     God always speaks plain in His laws--His everlasting voice.... My\r\n     poor child, He says, dost thou complain that I do not prematurely\r\n     give thee food which thou couldst not digest? My son, I am always\r\n     one with thee, though thou art not always one with me. That spirit\r\n     racked or blighted by sin, my child, it is thy Father's spirit.\r\n     Whence comes it, why does it suffer, or why is it blighted, but\r\n     that it is incipient love, and truth, and wisdom, tortured or\r\n     suppressed? But Law (that is, the will of the Perfect) is now, was\r\n     without beginning, and ever shall be, as the inducement and the\r\n     means by which that blight or suffering which is God within man,\r\n     shall become man one with God.\r\n\r\nFirst find the Infinite, said a wise man, then name Him as thou wilt.\r\n\"It is not hard to know God,\" said Joubert, \"provided one will not force\r\noneself to define Him.\" And another, of old time, said:--\r\n\r\n            Lead Thou me, God, Law, Reason, Duty, Life!\r\n            All names for Thee alike are vain and hollow.[362]\r\n\r\n  [362] Cleanthes, freely rendered by J. A. Symonds.\r\n\r\nThere is a section of Miss Nightingale's _Suggestions for Thought_\r\ncalled \"Cassandra.\" It is the story of a girl's imprisoned life; it is\r\nin part autobiographical, and I have quoted from it several times in the\r\ncourse of this work. It ends with the death of the heroine. \"Let neither\r\nname nor date be placed on her grave, still less the expression of\r\nregret or of admiration; but simply the words, _I believe in God_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         MISS NIGHTINGALE AT HOME\r\n\r\n                                (1858-1861)\r\n\r\n\r\nFew women, and not many men, have lived a fuller and busier life than\r\nwas Miss Nightingale's during the five years which followed her return\r\nfrom the Crimean War. They were years of public work, but of work done\r\nin quiet. And what is more remarkable, they were years to her of\r\nconstant physical weakness.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the year 1857-8 she was thought like to die. There were\r\nmany times during the year 1859 when she and her friends expected her\r\ndeath at any moment. \"Thank you,\" wrote George Eliot to Miss Hennell in\r\nFebruary, \"for sending me that authentic word about Miss Nightingale. I\r\nwonder if she would rather rest from her blessed labours, or live to go\r\non working. Sometimes when I read of the death of some great sensitive\r\nhuman being, I have a triumph in the sense that they are at rest; and\r\nyet, along with that, deep sadness at the thought that the rare nature\r\nis gone for ever into the darkness.\"[363] In the same year Miss\r\nNightingale gave Mr. Clough full instructions for her funeral. To her\r\nfriend, Colonel Lefroy, she had written as if the end were very near.\r\n\"What a crown yours will be,\" he answered (March 20), \"when you rest\r\nfrom your labours and your works follow you!\" A year later she wrote to\r\nMr. Manning (Feb. 25): \"Dear Sir, or dear Friend (whichever I may call\r\nyou), I am in the land of the living still, as you see, contrary to\r\neverybody's expectation, but so much weaker than when you were so kind\r\nas to come here, that I do not sit up at all now.\" \"_Nunc dimittis_,\"\r\nshe added, \"is the only prayer I can make now as far as regards myself.\"\r\nYet during all the time she was full of energy and fire, and lived\r\nlaborious days in writing and in talking. If the reader will turn to the\r\nBibliography (1858-1861), he will see at a glance how numerous were her\r\nprinted works, and preceding chapters have enabled him to estimate the\r\namount of toil and thought that lay behind them. Her unprinted Memoranda\r\nare on a like scale, and her correspondence was enormous. Then, too,\r\nhardly a day passed upon which she did not transact business personally\r\nwith one or other, or with several, of her \"Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n  [363] _George Eliot's Life as related in her Letters_, vol. ii. p. 84.\r\n\r\nAmong persons whom Miss Nightingale declined, on the ground of failing\r\nhealth, to receive (and the number included old friends and colleagues\r\nas well as strangers), there were some who would not believe that she\r\nwas as ill as she said; they thought that she was cloaking hardness of\r\nheart or perversity of temper. But they were wrong. Among occasional\r\nvisitors, again, whom she did receive, there were those to whom the\r\nevidence of their senses, derived from her animated and vigorous\r\nconversation, seemed to negative the idea that she was a serious\r\ninvalid. But they did not understand. Sir John Lawrence, for instance,\r\nwas received in March 1861, to discuss Indian questions. \"He found her\r\nmuch better than he expected,\" so her cousin Hilary reported, \"and said\r\nso to Dr. Sutherland as he went downstairs. Dr. Sutherland replied, 'You\r\ncannot know; but when I go back I shall find her quite _abattue_, and\r\nshall not speak another word to her.'\" And so it was. Dr. Sutherland\r\nfound her \"trembling all over,\" and had to administer medical aid. For\r\nany interview with a stranger, and for many interviews with her familiar\r\ncolleagues, she had to save up strength very carefully in advance, and\r\nthe transaction of any critical business, or the strain of any\r\nexcitement in conversation, left her prostrate and palpitating\r\nafterwards. The doctors now told her that her heart was seriously\r\naffected. Mr. Chadwick doubted this. Her father, writing to his wife\r\nfrom London, and describing an evening spent with Florence, said\r\n(1861): \"Chadwick and Sutherland at dinner; the former persisting that\r\nFlo's voice alone is sufficient to show that her (so called) heart\r\ncomplaint is doubtful. In truth she still seems to work like a Hercules\r\nin spite of all weakness.\" She worked without pause, but there were\r\ntimes when for weeks she did not leave her sofa or her bed, and for\r\nmonths did not go out of doors. It may be, as Mr. Chadwick thought, that\r\nthe diagnosis of the physicians was wrong, or at any rate that it\r\nexaggerated the seriousness of the case. As she lived to be ninety, the\r\ntruth must be, I suppose, that none of her vital organs or functions\r\nwere at this time diseased. The history of her case points, I am told,\r\nto dilatation of the heart and neurasthenia. The former of these states,\r\nthough often distressing in its symptoms, yields, I understand, to drugs\r\nand rest; and for the atonic condition of the nervous system, which is\r\ncalled neurasthenia, and which is often the product of excessive stress\r\nupon the functions of the mind, complete rest is also often a remedy. If\r\nupon her return to England Miss Nightingale had taken a long period of\r\nrest, it is probable that she would have regained normal health of body;\r\nbut, as we have seen, she allowed herself no rest at all. She taxed\r\nexhausted powers of body to the uttermost. Even now complete rest would\r\nprobably have cured her; but as she could not or would not put work\r\naside, she was only able to carry it on by careful husbandry of her\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    II\r\n\r\nThis state of the case led to a way of life which during the years now\r\nunder consideration seemed a matter of necessity, and which in later and\r\nless strenuous years had become, perhaps, in some degree a matter of\r\nhabit. Miss Nightingale, during the busy years 1856-61, lived the life\r\nof a laborious hermit--a life which may in some respects be likened to\r\nthat of Queen Victoria in the years following the death of the Prince\r\nConsort. In her own secluded court she worked indefatigably, but she\r\nscreened herself closely from the world. After the year 1858, Miss\r\nNightingale abandoned Malvern, and for change of air went instead to one\r\nor other of the Northern Heights of London. For the rest of the time\r\nshe lived in London itself; and sometimes, when she was living at\r\nHampstead, she would drive daily to her London quarters for the\r\ntransaction of business. Whether in London or at Hampstead or Highgate,\r\nshe did most of her work reclining on a sofa. She must have been touched\r\nwhen an upholsterer, hearing of her illness, volunteered (March 1860) to\r\nmake a reclining couch to her order; he offered it \"as some slight token\r\nof the esteem she is held in by the working-classes for her kindness to\r\nour soldiers, many of whom are related to my workmen who would gladly\r\nwork in her behalf without pay.\"\r\n\r\nThe screen from the outside world was provided by the devotion of\r\nrelations and a few intimate friends. In official business, connected\r\nwith the War Office and Hospitals, her most constant helper was Dr.\r\nSutherland. When not engaged on official business elsewhere, he was with\r\nher nearly every day, and a large number of her drafts, copies, and\r\nmemoranda of this date are in his handwriting. Captain Galton also\r\nrendered some assistance of a like sort. Among her kinsfolk, the most\r\nhelpful to her was Mr. Clough, who, besides being the Secretary of the\r\nNightingale Fund, was devoted in many ways to her service. A little note\r\nfrom him (Feb. 16, 1859), one of many, will show the kind of\r\nthing:--\"Willy-nilly, you must stay till Saturday. The railway carriage\r\nis ordered. At Euston Station they do not admit that Saturday is a later\r\nday for the Express than any other; let us hope they are right. The\r\narrangements are therefore made for Saturday. I think you must allow me\r\nto see them carried out myself. I enclose a yellow and maladive-looking\r\nletter, apparently from\r\n\r\n                            Whom shall we hang\r\n                              At Pulo-penang.\r\n\r\nThere was also a brown paper parcel with, I think, two blue books inside\r\nit, from Mr. Alexander, which I left lying at the Burlington. The rooms\r\nwill all be ready, as before. I send a _Daily News_ with H[arriet]\r\nM[artineau]'s latest on the Eternal Laws.--Farewell, A. H. Clough.\" Her\r\nuncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Smith, also played helpful parts at\r\nthis time in Miss Nightingale's life. Of her Aunt Mai and herself, Miss\r\nNightingale wrote that they were \"as two lovers,\" and the aunt played a\r\nlover's part both in affectionate solicitude and in keeping the rest of\r\nthe world away. Mr. Smith, who was an Examiner of Private Bills, had\r\nrooms conveniently situated in Whitehall, and placed his business-like\r\nhabits entirely at his niece's service. Much of her correspondence, in\r\nthe case of outsiders, was undertaken by him, and he also acted as her\r\nbanker and accountant. He found some reward, perhaps, for the drudgery\r\nin the pungency of the dockets in which Miss Nightingale conveyed her\r\ninstructions. On the letter from a lady working at Clewer, who \"loved\r\nand honoured\" Miss Nightingale, and looked forward to seeing her some\r\nday, the docket is: \"Dear Uncle Sam, Please choke off this woman and\r\ntell her that I shall _never_ be well enough to see her, either here or\r\n_hereafter_.\" To the Secretary of a certain Sanitary Association: \"I\r\nwill give 21s. for Mrs. S.'s sake, _provided_ they don't send me any\r\nmore of their stupid books, and don't let this unbusiness-like woman\r\nwrite any more of these unbusiness-like letters.\" To be unbusiness-like\r\nwas, in Miss Nightingale's eyes, an unpardonable sin, whether in woman\r\nor in man; in a woman, it was almost as bad as another which is touched\r\nupon in one of the dockets: \"Choke her off; my private belief is that\r\nshe merely wants a chance of getting married.\" On a letter of a very\r\nrambling kind from a would-be nurse, Uncle Sam's attention is called to\r\n\"the curious thing that she does not seem to know whether it is a parent\r\nor a child that she has lost.\" To a reverend gentleman who had \"a secret\r\ncure\": \"These miserable ecclesiastical quacks! Could you give them a\r\nlesson? What would they think of me did I possess such a discovery and\r\nkeep it secret?\" To the inventor of a patent bed-quilt: \"This man's\r\nletter reminds me of the Pills which, when taken by a gentleman with a\r\nwooden leg, made it grow again.\" To the British Army Scripture Readers\r\nshe will send a subscription, though with some misgiving: \"I am like\r\nPaul Ferroll, who never would engage in anything, knowing that he was a\r\nmurderer, and might be found out any day. So _I_ think.\" Her uncle had\r\nread her religious speculations, and would have caught the allusion to\r\nher heterodox opinions. To a pious lady who sent a tract: \"Please\r\nanswer this fool, but don't give her my address.\" Miss Nightingale\r\ndisliked tracts. She received great bundles of them for distribution at\r\nScutari. \"I said I distributed them,\" she once confessed, \"whether to\r\nthe fire or not, I did not say.\" Like all female celebrities, Miss\r\nNightingale received many offers of marriage. A letter, which she wrote\r\nin the papers in support of the Volunteer movement, produced several.\r\nOne was from \"a poor engineer\" who was profoundly touched by her \"noble\r\nsentiments,\" and feared that only in Heaven would her holy work be truly\r\nappreciated, but meanwhile offered his \"hand and heart, which are free,\r\nonly you are so much above me.\" \"It is gratifying to observe,\" Uncle Sam\r\nis told, \"that this is not the first fruits, but the one-and-fortieth of\r\nmy Volunteer letter; and that I could have as many husbands as Mahomet's\r\nmother. Alas! it is I who am the grey donkey.\" To a petitioner who sent\r\ncopies of verses to accompany accounts of his evangelical principles and\r\npecuniary embarrassments: \"This is the _third_ time the man has written.\r\nI think it is time you put a stop to him and his 'poetry.'\" Miss\r\nNightingale detested gush almost as much as unbusiness-like habits (if\r\nindeed the two things need be distinguished). She kept everything she\r\nreceived; but in looking through the presentation copies of poems in her\r\nlibrary, I was struck, and I fear that the donors would have been\r\npained, by the fact that she seldom had the curiosity even to cut the\r\nleaves where her praises are sung. To a very long-winded appeal from a\r\nlady who claimed \"the thrilling honour of Miss Nightingale's sympathy\":\r\n\"I believe all this, though I don't know the woman from Adam. Send her\r\n£2 for me, at the same time giving her a hint to look at _Bleak House_.\"\r\nBut Mr. Smith, though not a member of Parliament, was an old\r\nparliamentary hand, and I have seen copies of some of the admirable\r\nletters in which he carried out, more or less, his niece's instructions.\r\nI feel confident that he did not wound this petitioner's feelings by\r\nallusion to Mrs. Jellyby or Borrioboola-Gha. Nor was it supposed that he\r\nwould. Miss Nightingale seldom denied herself a joke; but though she had\r\na keen scent for palpable humbug, and was instantly offended by it, her\r\nheart was easily touched, and I am not sure that all her pecuniary\r\nbenefactions, which were constant, numerous, and manifold, would have\r\npassed the test of a strict Charity Organization Committee. Often,\r\nhowever, she took great pains in following up \"cases,\" and in relieving\r\nthem in the best way. She was particularly open to appeals from the\r\nwidows or other relations of soldiers and sailors. Her intimate\r\nknowledge of hospitals and other charitable institutions, and the favour\r\nof Queen Victoria in placing many beds at her disposal, increased her\r\nmeans of helpfulness. Many of her petitioners, especially if they were\r\nautograph-hunters in disguise, were disappointed, no doubt, at not\r\nreceiving an answer from Miss Nightingale herself, but pecuniarily they\r\nwere sometimes the gainers. On many of their letters I find this\r\nsupplementary docket from kind-hearted Uncle Sam: \"Sent also something\r\non my own account.\" And sometimes he sent something when she had said\r\nsend nothing, and she got the credit for it: \"Dear Uncle Sam, I am so\r\nglad to think that I am laying up such a store in heaven upon _your_ £2\r\nsent without my permission to this woman.\" The uncle's tongue was almost\r\nas sharp and witty, I have been told, as the niece's pen, and he must\r\nhave found her comments very congenial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    III\r\n\r\nThe places at which Miss Nightingale lay _perdue_ during these years\r\nwere West Hill Lodge, Highgate--the house of the Howitts (May-June\r\n1859); Montague Grove, Hampstead; Oak Hill House, Frognal (Sept. 1859 to\r\nJan. 1860); and Upper Terrace Lodge (No. 3), Hampstead (end of 1860). At\r\none time, when Mr. Clough was abroad in search of health, his young\r\nchildren stayed with their aunt at Hampstead, and her letters show that\r\nshe took pleasure in their pleasures on the Heath. A letter to Mrs.\r\nClough (Hampstead, Sept. 1, 1860) contains as pretty a description of a\r\nyoung child as may anywhere be found: \"'It' came in its flannel coat to\r\nsee me. No one had ever prepared me for its Royalty. It sat quite\r\nupright, but would not say a word, good or bad. The cats jumped up upon\r\nit. It put out its hand with a kind of gracious dignity and caressed\r\nthem, as if they were presenting Addresses, and they responded in a\r\nhumble, grateful way, quite cowed by infant majesty. Then it put out its\r\nlittle bare cold feet for me to warm, which when I did, it smiled. In\r\nabout twenty minutes, it waved its hand to go away, still without\r\nspeaking a word. I think it is the most beautifully organized little\r\npiece of humanity I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene of Miss Nightingale's London \"court\" was the Burlington Hotel.\r\nIn April 1861 Colonel Phipps wrote to Sir Harry Verney: \"It has been\r\narranged that an 'apartment' at Kensington Palace shall be put into\r\nproper repair with a view to its being offered by the Queen to Miss\r\nNightingale as a residence. I need not tell you how grateful it will be\r\nto the Queen's feelings, even in this slight degree, to be able to mark\r\nher respect for this most excellent lady of whom everybody in this\r\ncountry must be proud.\" But the Queen's offer was respectfully declined.\r\nThose were days when there were no motor-cars or underground railways;\r\nand Miss Nightingale, immersed in daily business with men of affairs,\r\nfelt that a residence so remote from official London as Kensington\r\nPalace would deprive her of many opportunities for useful work. She\r\nremained, accordingly, at the Burlington, where she had a small suite of\r\napartments in a house attached to the hotel. It comprised on an upper\r\nfloor a bedroom, a dressing-room, a room for her maid, and a spare\r\nbedroom, and on a lower floor a sitting-room. The spare bedroom enabled\r\nher to send \"dine-and-sleep\" invitations to busy men who were working\r\nwith her. On such occasions she would invite other members of her\r\n\"Cabinet\" to dinner or to breakfast, but she seldom was able to sit down\r\nto table with them.\r\n\r\nHired rooms, in hotels or lodgings, gave Miss Nightingale for many years\r\nof her life all that she wanted in such sort. The smaller the home, the\r\ngreater the quiet. She was entirely free from dependence upon, or\r\naffection for, \"things.\" She simplified life by reducing her impedimenta\r\nto the smallest compass. Her father in an incautious moment, once wrote\r\nof sending some things for her \"drawing-room\" at the Burlington. She\r\nreplied indignantly that she had no drawing-room; a thing which was\r\n\"the destruction of so many women's lives.\" \"There are always flowers in\r\nher rooms,\" wrote her cousin Beatrice to Mr. Nightingale \"but so many\r\nBlue-books that I should think she could not complain of their looking\r\nlike drawing-rooms.\" \"I saw her,\" wrote her sister to Madame Mohl (Feb.\r\n1861), \"just before we came here [Embley], and found the table covered,\r\namong her beautiful flowers sent her by all sorts of people, with Indian\r\nReports and plans of new Hospitals.\" She was always fond of flowers. She\r\nbelieved, too, in their curative, or at any rate consolatory, effect\r\nupon the sick, and had made some study of their several colours in this\r\nrespect.[364] With flowers and fruit and game she was abundantly\r\nsupplied, by her friend Lady Ashburton, among others, and by her\r\nadmirer, Lady Burdett-Coutts. She forwarded many of such gifts to\r\nfriends, nurses, and hospitals. She asked her mother to send greenery\r\nand flowers from the country for the London hospitals: \"It gives such\r\npleasure to people who never see anything but four walls.\" She was\r\nparticularly thoughtful of the Bermondsey Nuns who had served with her\r\nin the Crimean War. She was constantly solicitous about the Reverend\r\nMother's health, as were the Sisters about _hers_. \"I am always praying\r\nfor you,\" wrote one of them (her \"Cardinal,\" Sister Gonzaga), \"and your\r\nhealth is no credit to my piety.\" Her little household always included\r\nsome cats, of which she was very fond. Madame Mohl had given her a\r\nfamily of fine Persians, some of them yellow and striped, almost like\r\ntigers, and very wild. In a letter to Sir James Paget, she seems to have\r\ncomplained that St. Bartholomew's Hospital did not quite reciprocate her\r\nadmiration; yet she had a cat named Barts as well as one named Tom. Sir\r\nJames would communicate this evidence of affection to his colleagues;\r\nbut the fact was, he added, that \"Thomas is a very boastful fellow, and\r\nsays sometimes that the lady thinks meanly of every one but him.\" Miss\r\nNightingale's fondness for cats was shared by her father, and many of\r\nher letters to him, and of his to her, pass from problems of metaphysics\r\nto the less riddling antics of kittens.\r\n\r\n  [364] _Notes on Nursing_, ed. 1860, p. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    IV\r\n\r\nA diet of Blue-books has been likened by Lord Rosebery to one of\r\ncracknel biscuits. But Miss Nightingale hungered and thirsted after\r\nfacts, and only complained of Blue-books when they did not give so many\r\nfacts and figures as were reasonably containable in the given cubic\r\nspace. \"It may seem a strange recreation,\" wrote Mr. Jowett to her (May\r\n11, 1861), \"to offer to a lady who is ill a discussion on metaphysics or\r\ntheology. But I hear that you still feel interested in such subjects,\r\nand therefore may I venture to try and entertain you?\" There follows a\r\nlong disquisition upon Freedom and Necessity and other high matters. Mr.\r\nJowett was correctly informed. There was nothing which Miss Nightingale\r\nmore enjoyed than metaphysical discussion. It was not so much that she\r\nfound in it an intellectual contrast to the problems of practical\r\nadministration in which she was at other times engaged, but rather, as I\r\nhave suggested in the preceding chapter, that she believed it possible\r\nto attain in the region of philosophy and religion the same positive\r\nresults that are deducible in sanitary science. For recreation, she\r\nturned occasionally to fiction. She corresponded with Mrs. Archer Clive\r\non the plot of _Paul Ferroll_. In a different sort, the novels of\r\nanother friend pleased her. \"She said of your _Ruth_ this morning,\"\r\nwrote her cousin Hilary to Mrs. Gaskell (Sept. 6, 1859), \"'It is a\r\nbeautiful novel, and I think I like it better still than when I first\r\nread it six years ago.' We had sent for _Ruth_ to lie on her table and\r\ntempt her, and she bids me ask now for _North and South_, which also she\r\nread of old.\" Miss Nightingale, who as a girl was music-mad, found\r\noccasional solace in hearing it. She says in _Notes on Nursing_ that\r\n\"wind instruments, including the human voice, and stringed instruments,\r\ncapable of continuous sound,\" have generally a soothing effect upon\r\ninvalids, \"while the pianoforte, with such instruments as have _no_\r\ncontinuity of sound, has just the reverse.\" There was an evening in\r\nOctober 1860 when Miss Nightingale had a great treat. Clara Novello\r\n(Contessa Gigliucci) was one of many women in whom the heroine of the\r\nCrimea inspired a passionate admiration, and she begged to be allowed to\r\ncome and sing to the invalid. \"I shall never in my life forget the\r\nevening,\" she wrote to Miss Nightingale's cousin (Oct. 26); \"the\r\nagitation I experienced made me unable to leave my bed all next day. I\r\nnever remember to have felt such emotions. As I had the delight of\r\nkissing those lovely and blessed hands, blessed in their deeds and\r\nblessed by so many, and looked into that dear tender face, I could not\r\nrestrain my tears, just such tears as rise when one hears a lovely\r\nmelody or is told of an heroic deed!\" Miss Nightingale presently wrote a\r\nletter of thanks, saying that the singing had \"restored\" her, and the\r\nContessa replied: \"I can say with entire truth that God's gift to me of\r\nvoice has never given me so much delight as when I was able to sing to\r\nyou, tho' probably I never sang so ill.\" The Contessa was a Garibaldian,\r\nand this was a further link between her and Miss Nightingale, whose\r\nenthusiasm in the cause of Italian unity and liberation was of long\r\nstanding. She sent several subscriptions in 1860 to funds which were\r\ncollected in this country for the Garibaldian cause. Her cheques were\r\nmade payable to \"Garibaldi,\" and she expressed a hope that they would be\r\nused in the purchase of arms. \"I quite agree,\" she wrote (June), \"with\r\nthe Patriots who say, Better give money for arms than to heal the holes\r\nthe arms have made.\" She was often more of a soldier than of a nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's fame was great in Italy, owing to the Sardinian\r\ncontingent in the Crimea, and indirectly it was the cause of one of the\r\nfew occasions upon which her barriers were broken through. An excellent\r\nlady, full of breathless activity and of enthusiasm for Italy, had been\r\nasked during her visit to that country by persons anxious for its\r\nregeneration, to \"send them a Florence Nightingale.\" The lady was more\r\nparticularly interested in \"educating the South,\" and Garibaldi himself\r\nhad given his name to an appeal to Englishwomen for co-operation in that\r\nlarge undertaking. She was staying at the Burlington Hotel and, chancing\r\nto learn that Miss Nightingale was there also, she burst in upon her.\r\n\"She wanted me,\" wrote Miss Nightingale in describing the incursion, \"to\r\nwrite to half the people in London, and to set up a whole system of\r\neducation at Naples. 'You are to write all the statutes,' she said, 'for\r\nRagged Schools, Infant Schools, Industrial Schools, Provident Societies,\r\nas you do for the Army.'\" Miss Nightingale suggested that there might be\r\npractical difficulties; \"but though I really talked as loud and as fast\r\nas I possibly could, I doubt if she took in a word.\" The interview left\r\nMiss Nightingale much exhausted, and Uncle Sam was called in to prevent\r\nany repetition of it. She had, however, a real respect for the\r\nearnestness of her visitor, and wrote letters to some Italian friends\r\nabout the scheme.\r\n\r\nIncursions by casual callers and visits from friendly entertainers were,\r\nhowever, alike very rare; the greater part of her days during the years\r\n1858-61 was spent in transacting the business which has been described\r\nin preceding chapters. Her voluminous correspondence, her literary work,\r\nthe daily interviews with Mr. Herbert or Dr. Sutherland or others on\r\nmatters of business, left her with little time or strength for seeing\r\nother friends and relations, and not very much for correspondence with\r\nthem. She occasionally saw Lady Ashburton, to whom she was greatly\r\nattached; more frequently another of her dearest friends, Mrs.\r\nBracebridge, but she was so helpful that her visits may be reckoned\r\namongst business calls. Sometimes she saw Dr. Manning, but the same may\r\nalmost be said of his visits, since religious speculation and\r\nphilanthropic enterprises were amongst the business of her life. She saw\r\nMiss Mary Jones, the Superintendent of St. John's House, from time to\r\ntime; but for the rest she lived in seclusion from her friends and\r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nShe was secluded hardly less from her relations. Her cousin, Miss Hilary\r\nBonham Carter, or her Aunt Mai, or her cousin Beatrice often stayed in\r\nthe house; but this did not mean that they saw very much of her. \"I\r\ncommunicate with her every day,\" wrote Mrs. Smith (Jan. 1861); \"but I\r\nhave not seen her to speak to for nearly four years.\" \"Indeed we know,\"\r\nwrote Miss Beatrice to Mr. Nightingale, \"how hard it is for you to hear\r\nnothing of her, but no one can know anything now that the isolation of\r\nwork has set in.\" When Miss Nightingale decided upon making the\r\nBurlington her headquarters, Aunt Mai had undertaken the difficult\r\ncommission from her niece of intimating to her parents that it might be\r\nbetter if they henceforth, when staying in London, were to go somewhere\r\nelse. It was essential, said Aunt Mai, to Florence's health, on which\r\ndepended her work, that she should live a life of seclusion; it would be\r\ndifficult to ward off stray callers, if it were known that her parents\r\nwere with her. Visitors would come to see them, and break in upon her.\r\nThey went elsewhere accordingly, and had to take their chance, with\r\nothers, of being admitted or refused. \"Dear Papa,\" wrote Miss\r\nNightingale (June 13), \"I shall always be well enough to see _you_ as\r\nlong as this mortal coil is on me at all. Mr. Herbert goes to Spa the\r\nfirst week in July. After that, there will be less pressure on me--the\r\npressure of disappointment in his (more than excusable) administrative\r\nindifference. But July will be later than your ordinary transit. Please\r\ntell Mama that the jug and nosegay were beautiful.\" And again, a few\r\ndays later: \"Dear Papa, I will keep all Sunday vacant for you. I should\r\nlike to have you twice, please, say at 11-1/2and 3-1/2.\"\r\n\r\nHours thus spent with his daughter were among the keenest pleasures of\r\nMr. Nightingale's life. In a letter of 1861 he writes to her: \"'Quidquid\r\nex Agricola amavimus, quidquid mirati sumus manet mansurumque est in\r\nanimis.'[365] I say it not in vain praise, but whatever I have heard at\r\nyour bedside and from your sofa _manet mansurumque est in animis_. And\r\nso would I fain hear whatever words I might catch from your lips when\r\nyour active work ceases and your prophecy begins.\" When the father\r\nreturned to his pleasant country-houses, he would renew the intercourse\r\nwith his daughter by turning to her _Suggestions for Thought_:--\r\n\r\n     (_To Miss Nightingale from her Father._) _July_ 21 [1861].... I\r\n     could realize you, while I turned the pages on the Progress of Man\r\n     towards that Perfection so sure tho' so slow to come, creating for\r\n     himself that better world which he had so foolishly thought was to\r\n     be given him for the asking. Was ever faith in the \"perfect law of\r\n     Love and Goodness\", like yours?--the more of disappointment, the\r\n     more suffering, the stronger faith. I also can rely on the\r\n     invisible Power; but can I give a more reasonable account of my\r\n     Faith than he who believes in Atonements, Incarnations,\r\n     Revelations, and so forth? Was ever sentence truer than\r\n     yours?--\"God's plan is that we make mistakes; in them I will try to\r\n     learn God's purpose.\"[366] I also feel myself mistaken all day long\r\n     in thought, feeling, or doing--but what help do I find? do I\r\n     _learn_ therefrom? do my three score years and more give me the\r\n     repose of a life spent in helping others or even in helping\r\n     myself?... [Then he turns from such reflections as if too hard for\r\n     him, describes to her the doings of her favourite cats, and talks\r\n     of the hills and streams of her old home--hoping against hope, it\r\n     may be, to lure her back, and jotting down his wandering thoughts\r\n     the while.] But you will say, \"Tell me no more of my idle cats; I\r\n     have cares enough, and thoughts enough elsewhere. My other\r\n     belongings, where are they? I relied on a Secretary of State, where\r\n     is he? where, my Hospitals? where all my many friends on whom I\r\n     placed my work? where is my strength? My mind still strains over\r\n     the immeasurable wants of the Army I have served, and I am left\r\n     alone, with my physical powers confining me to my chamber.\" How\r\n     vain then is my thought that here, if you had wings, you might be\r\n     at rest--at this calm peaceful window where the hills keep creeping\r\n     down into the far-receding valley and multiply my thoughts as it\r\n     were into Eternity. You will (in your mind's eye at least) rejoice\r\n     with me, while I recount a day too soon gone, too full perhaps of\r\n     erring reflection, too short of inspiration.\r\n\r\n  [365] Tacitus, _Agricola_.\r\n\r\n  [366] _Suggestions for Thought_, vol. ii. p. 90.\r\n\r\nThe relations between father and daughter had been made more intimate by\r\nher book of religious and philosophical speculation. Mr. Nightingale, it\r\nmay be added, had enlarged Florence's allowance at the time of the\r\nmarriage of his other daughter. Henceforth he undertook to pay, without\r\nquestion, all her bills for board and lodging, and to allow her £500 a\r\nyear besides. She had made, too, a considerable sum by her _Notes on\r\nNursing_, and was able to enlarge the scale of her benefactions. Among\r\nthe first uses which she made of her enlarged means was to give £500 for\r\nthe improvement of the school near Lea Hurst, in which her cousin\r\nBeatrice (who during these years often lived there with Mr. and Mrs.\r\nNightingale) was greatly interested, especially for the sanitary\r\nimprovement, for which purpose she asked her friend Mr. Chadwick to go\r\non a visit to her parents and inspect the school buildings. She was\r\ncareless of her own sanitary improvement, Dr. Sutherland had said; but\r\nshe was very particular about that of her relations. When Mr. William\r\nShore Smith--\"her boy\" of earlier days--was about to be married, and was\r\nhouse-hunting, she obtained from him a written promise, signed, sealed,\r\nand attested, that he would enter into no covenant until Dr. Sutherland\r\nhad reported to her on the drains. When another of her cousins was to be\r\nmarried, Miss Nightingale's last good wishes, before the event, took the\r\nform of strict orders that the bride should put on \"thick-soled fur\r\nslippers over her shoes in walking to the church. Tell her nothing\r\ndepresses the spirits so much as a damp chill to the feet. She will\r\nwonder why she is so low.\" I suspect some _double entendre_. Miss\r\nNightingale, as we know, was not an enthusiast on marriage in the\r\nabstract. When at a later time one of her younger cousins wrote to\r\nannounce her engagement, Aunt Florence's answer (by telegram) was\r\nstrictly non-committal: \"A thousand, thousand thanks for your letter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    VI\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's correspondence during these years was mostly upon\r\nbusiness, but she sometimes found time for the kind of letters which\r\nconnoisseurs in that pleasant art account the best--letters about\r\nnothing in particular. In this kind, her old friend, Madame Mohl\r\ncontinued to be favoured, and these letters seldom lacked the caustic\r\ntouch which their recipient relished, as in this:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Madame Mohl._) _June_ 6 [1859].... Balzac\r\n     somewhere says how all the world, friends and enemies, _se fait\r\n     complice de nos défauts_. And I have heard you observe that English\r\n     mothers act Greek chorus to their children. Do, you philosophers (I\r\n     am _passée_ and off the philosophizing stage), come over and\r\n     explain to us English society now--where everybody has some little\r\n     moral reason for doing everything that he likes, where health is\r\n     made the excuse for neglecting every duty and at the same time the\r\n     not being able to perform said duty is deplored as the \"only\r\n     cross\"--how much more dangerous are our moralities than our\r\n     immoralities. Everybody has everything _both ways_ here. When I\r\n     lived in society (English) it seemed to me that, in conversation,\r\n     people, but more especially women, were always doing one or more of\r\n     three things:--(1) Addressing themselves: as when they adduce those\r\n     little moral reasons for doing whatever they like. (2) Saying\r\n     something to mean something else. Since I began what M. Mohl calls\r\n     my War against Red Tape, the commonest argument brought against me\r\n     both by men and women, the best and cleverest, and within the last\r\n     week too, is that I am led by \"dishonest flatterers\" and that they\r\n     trust I may \"awaken to a sense of my duty as a woman.\" Now they\r\n     don't really believe that I am led by \"dishonest flattery.\" But\r\n     they think I shall not like it to be _supposed_ that I am. This is\r\n     only an anecdote (I hate anecdotes, don't you?). But it is a very\r\n     fair illustration of my No. 2. (3) Acting an amiable or humble\r\n     idea: as when people tell an ill-natured story and then its\r\n     palliation, and then say \"_We_ might have been worse.\" And all the\r\n     while all they mean to be in your mind is, how amiable _they_ are\r\n     and how humble _they_ are, and they mean you to believe the story\r\n     and not the palliation.... I have done with being amiable. It is\r\n     the mother of mischief.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale may have \"done with being amiable\"; but she had\r\ncertainly not done with a lively sense of humour. At the Burlington one\r\nday, or rather one night, there was a domestic catastrophe. Miss\r\nNightingale's dressing-room was flooded. She sent a characteristic\r\naccount of the subsequent proceedings to her cousin:--\r\n\r\n     (_Miss Nightingale to Miss H. Bonham Carter._) [1861.] ... I have\r\n     just re-enacted the Crimea on a small scale. Everybody \"did their\r\n     duty,\" and I was drowned. But so distrustful was I of the results\r\n     of their duty that I extorted from Mr. X. a weekly inspection of\r\n     the cistern. I acted myself and no one has yet been drowned again.\r\n     Mr. X. convinced four men--Sir Harry Verney, Papa, Uncle Sam, Uncle\r\n     Octavius--whom I brought under weigh, that it was the frost and\r\n     that he had done all that was possible. Then _I_ had up Mr. X., and\r\n     he admitted at once that it was nothing to do with the frost, and\r\n     that what the workmen had done, viz. not altering the waste-pipe,\r\n     was \"rascally.\" I said he came off with an excuse. And I came off\r\n     with a \"severe internal congestion,\" _vide_ Medical Certificate. I\r\n     have had a larger responsibility of human lives than ever man or\r\n     woman had before. And I attribute my success to this:--_I never\r\n     gave or took an excuse_. Yes, I do see the difference now between\r\n     me and other men. When a disaster happens, _I_ act and _they_ make\r\n     excuses.\r\n\r\nLandlords might be brow-beaten; servants had to be bribed. The\r\nprophetess had no honour in her own hotel. The maids at the Burlington\r\nhad not mastered the elements of household hygiene as set out in _Notes\r\non Nursing_. Amongst Miss Nightingale's papers there is this document:\r\n\"_August_ 16, 1860. If for one fortnight from this time I find all the\r\ndoors shut and all the windows open, and if ... I will give the servants\r\na Doctor's Fee, viz. One Guinea.--Signed, F. Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\nThe Burlington Hotel continued to be Miss Nightingale's principal home\r\ntill August 1861. The house, No. 30 in Old Burlington Street, still\r\nstands, and a memorial tablet might well be affixed by the London County\r\nCouncil or the Society of Arts. No other spot, in this country, has\r\nassociations with so much of Miss Nightingale's public work. It was\r\nthere that she wrote the famous Report on her experiences in the Crimea,\r\nand there that she had the historic interview with Lord Panmure--the\r\nstarting-point for the great and manifold reforms which she and Mr.\r\nHerbert carried out for the health of the British Army. It was there,\r\ntoo, that she wrote her _Notes on Hospitals_ and _Notes on Nursing_--the\r\nbooks which helped to make a new epoch in hospital reform and to found\r\nthe art of modern nursing; and there that she thought out the scheme for\r\nprofessional training which has made \"Nightingale Nurses\" known\r\nthroughout the world. Soon after Lord Herbert's death in August 1861,\r\nMiss Nightingale left Old Burlington Street. She was fond of the house.\r\nShe had found no other place in London so convenient for her work. She\r\nhad preferred to stay there rather than to accept the royal invitation\r\nto Kensington Palace. But the associations of the Burlington, as she\r\nsaid to many friends at the time, had now become too painful. After the\r\nloss of her \"dear Master,\" she never visited it again. The death of\r\nSidney Herbert closed a chapter in the life of Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               END OF VOL. 1\r\n\r\n                     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WORKS BY SIR EDWARD COOK\r\n\r\nA POPULAR HANDBOOK TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY.\r\n\r\nTwo vols.
