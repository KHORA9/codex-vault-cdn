It may serve\r\nas a reader supplementary to American history and literature, or it\r\nmay be made the ground-work for serious study of Southern life and\r\nletters; and between these extremes there are varying degrees of\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nTo state its origin will best explain its existence. This may\r\nfurthermore be of some help to teachers in using the book, though each\r\nteacher will use it as best suits his classes and methods.\r\n\r\nThe study of History is rising every day in importance. Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh in his \"Historie of the World\" well said, \"It hath triumphed\r\nover time, which besides it nothing but eternity hath triumphed over.\"\r\nIt is the still living word of the vanished ages.\r\n\r\nThe best way of teaching history has of late years received much\r\nattention. One excellent method is to read, in connection with the\r\ntext-book, good works of fiction, dramas, poetry, and historical\r\nnovels, bearing upon the different epochs, and also to read the works\r\nof the authors themselves of these different periods. We thus make\r\nhistory and literature illustrate and beautify each other. The dry\r\ndates become covered with living facts, the past is peopled with real\r\nbeings instead of hard names, fiction receives a solid basis for its\r\nairy architecture, and the mind of the pupil is interested and\r\nbroadened. Even the difficult subjects of politics and institutions\r\ngradually assume a more pleasing aspect by being associated with\r\nindividual human interests, and condescend to simplify themselves\r\nthrough personal relations.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this method, which I have used with great success in\r\nteaching English History:\r\n\r\nIn connection with the times of the early Britons, read Tennyson's\r\n\"Idyls of the King.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Norman Conquest, Bulwer's \"Harold.\"\r\n\r\nAt the reign of Richard I. (Coeur de Lion), Scott's \"Ivanhoe\" and\r\n\"Talisman,\" Shakspere's \"King John.\"\r\n\r\nAt the reign of Elizabeth, Scott's \"Kenilworth,\" the non-historical\r\nplays of Shakspere, as he lived at that epoch, Bacon's Essays, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI mention merely a few. The amount of reading can be increased almost\r\nindefinitely and will depend on the time of the pupil, the plan of the\r\nteacher, and the accessibility of the books. Most of the books\r\nnecessary for English History are now published in cheap form and are\r\nwithin reach of every pupil.\r\n\r\nA great deal of reading is very desirable; it is the only way to give\r\nour pupils any broad view of literature and history, and to cultivate\r\na taste for reading in those destitute of it. It is often the only\r\nopportunity for reading which some pupils will ever have, and it lasts\r\nthem a life-time as a pleasure and a benefit.[1]\r\n\r\nThe reading may be done in the class or out of school hours. It is\r\nwell to read as much as practicable in class, and to have some sketch\r\nof the outside reading given in class.\r\n\r\nGeography must also go hand in hand with history, a point now well\r\nunderstood. But its importance can hardly be exaggerated and its\r\npractice is of the utmost value. One _must_ use maps to study and read\r\nintelligently.\r\n\r\nIn American History pursue a similar course, as for example:\r\n\r\nAt the period of discovery and early settlement, read Irving's\r\n\"Columbus,\" Simms' \"Vasconselos\" (De Soto's Expedition), and\r\n\"Yemassee,\" John Smith's Life and Writings, Longfellow's \"Hiawatha\"\r\nand \"Miles Standish,\" Kennedy's \"Rob of the Bowl,\" Strachey's Works,\r\nMrs. Preston's \"Colonial Ballads,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn Revolutionary times, the Revolutionary novels of Simms and Cooper,\r\nKennedy's \"Horse-Shoe Robinson;\" the great statesmen of the day, as\r\nJefferson, Adams, Patrick Henry, Hamilton, Washington; Cooke's\r\n\"Fairfax\" in which Washington appears as a youthful surveyor, and\r\n\"Virginia Comedians\" in which Patrick Henry appears, Thackeray's\r\n\"Virginians;\" and others.\r\n\r\nEach teacher will make his own list as his time and command of books\r\nallow. And each State or section of our great country will devote more\r\ntime to its own special history and literature; this is right, for\r\nknowledge like charity begins at home, and gradually widens until it\r\nembraces the circle of the universe.\r\n\r\nIn collecting material for classes in American History to read in\r\naccordance with this plan, it was found easy to get cheap editions of\r\nIrving, Longfellow, Cooper, and other writers of the northern States,\r\nbut almost impossible to get those of the southern, in cheap or even\r\nexpensive editions. And the present volume has been prepared to supply\r\nin part this deficiency. To fit it to the plan suggested, the dates of\r\nthe writers and the period and character of their works have been\r\nindicated, and some selections from them given for reading,--too\r\nlittle, it is feared, to be of much service, and yet enough to\r\nstimulate to further interest and study.\r\n\r\nThe materials have been found so abundant, even so much more abundant\r\nthan I suspected when undertaking the work, that it has been a hard\r\ntask to make a selection from the rich masses of interesting writing.\r\nI fear that the work is too fragmentary and contains too many writers\r\nto make a lasting impression in a historical point of view.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it leads to a sympathetic study of Southern life and\r\nliterature, and especially if it makes young people acquainted with\r\nour writers of the past and with something of the old-time life and\r\nthe spirit that controlled our ancestors, it will serve an excellent\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOur writers should be compared with those of other sections and other\r\ncountries; and due honor should be given them, equally removed from\r\nover-praise and from depreciation. If we, their countrymen, do not\r\nknow and honor them, who can be expected to do so? No people is great\r\nwhose memory is lost, whose interest centres in the present alone, who\r\nlooks not reverently back to true beginnings and hopefully forward to\r\na grand future.\r\n\r\nSo I would urge my fellow-teachers to a fresh diligence in studying\r\nand worthily understanding the life and literature of our past, and in\r\nimpressing them upon the minds of the rising generation, so as to\r\ninfuse into the new forms now arising the best and purest and highest\r\nof the old forms fast passing away.\r\n\r\nMy sincere thanks are hereby tendered to the scholars who have aided\r\nme by their advice and encouragement, to living authors and the\r\nrelatives of those not living who have generously given me permission\r\nto copy extracts from their writings, to the publishers who have\r\nkindly allowed me to use copyrighted matter, to Miss Anna M. Trice,\r\nMr. Josiah Ryland, Jr., and the officials of the Virginia State\r\nLibrary where I found most of the books needed in my work, and to Mr.\r\nDavid Hutcheson, of the Library of Congress. My greatest indebtedness\r\nis to Professor William Taylor Thom and Professor John P. McGuire, for\r\nscholarly criticism and practical suggestions in the course of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n    1895.

He was captured by them and held prisoner for\r\na year, but escaped and travelled all over Europe. He finally joined\r\nthe expedition to colonize Virginia, and came over with the first\r\nsettlers of Jamestown in 1607. His life here is well known; he\r\nremained with the colony two years. He afterwards returned to America\r\nas Admiral of New England, but did not stay long. He spent the\r\nremainder of his life in writing accounts of himself and his travels,\r\nand of the colonies in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    True Relation (1608).\r\n    Map of Virginia (1612).\r\n    Description of New England (1616).\r\n    New England's Trials (1620).\r\n    Accidence for Young Seamen (1626).\r\n    Generall Historie of Virginia, New England, and the Summer\r\n        Isles (1624).\r\n    True Travels (1630).\r\n    Advertisements for Inexperienced Planters of New England (1631).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Captain John Smith.~]\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith's style is honest and hearty in tone, picturesque, often\r\namusing, never tiresome. It is involved and ungrammatical at times,\r\nbut not obscure. The critics have professed to find many inaccuracies\r\nof historical statement; but the following, from Professor Edward\r\nArber, the editor of the English Reprint of Smith's Works, will acquit\r\nhim of this charge:\r\n\r\n    \"Inasmuch as the accuracy of some of Captain Smith's\r\n    statements has, in this generation, been called in\r\n    question, it was but our duty to subject every one of\r\n    the nearly forty thousand lines of this book to a most\r\n    searching criticism; scanning every assertion of fact\r\n    most keenly, and making the Text, by the insertion of a\r\n    multitude of cross-references, prove or disprove itself.\r\n\r\n    \"The result is perfectly satisfactory. Allowing for a\r\n    popular style of expression, the Text is homogeneous;\r\n    and the nine books comprising it, though written under\r\n    very diverse circumstances, and at intervals over the\r\n    period of twenty-two years (1608-1630), contain no\r\n    material contradictions. Inasmuch, therefore, as\r\n    wherever we _can_ check Smith, we find him both modest\r\n    and accurate, we are led to think him so, where no such\r\n    check is possible, as at Nalbrits in the autumn of 1603,\r\n    and on the Chickahominy in the winter of 1607-'8.\" See\r\n    Life, by _Simms_, by _Warner_, and by _Eggleston_ in\r\n    \"Pocahontas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRESCUE OF CAPTAIN SMITH BY POCAHONTAS, OR MATOAKA.\r\n\r\n(_From Generall Historie._)\r\n\r\n    [This extract from his \"Generall Historie\" is in the\r\n    words of a report by \"eight gentlemen of the Jamestown\r\n    Colony.\" It is corroborated by Captain Smith's letter to\r\n    the Queen on the occasion of Pocahontas' visit to\r\n    England after her marriage to Mr. John Rolfe. Matoaka,\r\n    or Matoax, was her real name in her tribe, but it was\r\n    considered unlucky to tell it to the English strangers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Rescue of Captain Smith by Pocahontas.~]\r\n\r\nAt last they brought him [Smith] to _Meronocomoco_, where was\r\n_Powhatan_ their Emperor. Here more than two hundred of those grim\r\nCourtiers stood wondering at him, as he had beene a monster; till\r\n_Powhatan_ and his trayne had put themselues in their greatest\r\nbraveries. Before a fire vpon a seat like a bedstead, he sat covered\r\nwith a great robe, made of _Rarowcun_ skinnes, and all the tayles\r\nhanging by. On either hand did sit a young wench of 16 or 18 yeares;\r\nand along on each side the house, two rowes of men, and behind them\r\nas many women, with all their heads and shoulders painted red; many of\r\ntheir heads bedecked with the white downe of Birds; but every one with\r\nsomething; and a great chayne of white beads about their necks.\r\n\r\nAt his entrance before the King, all the people gaue a great shout.\r\nThe Queene of _Appamatuck_ was appointed to bring him water to wash\r\nhis hands, and another brought him a bunch of feathers, in stead of a\r\nTowell to dry them; having feasted him after their best barbarous\r\nmanner they could, a long consultation was held, but the conclusion\r\nwas, two great stones were brought before _Powhatan_; then as many as\r\ncould layd hands on him, dragged him to them, and thereon laid his\r\nhead, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines,\r\n_Pocahontas_, the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could\r\nprevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne vpon his to\r\nsaue him from death: whereat the Emperour was contented he should liue\r\nto make him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper; for they\r\nthought him as well of all occupations as themselues. For the King\r\nhimselfe will make his owne robes, shooes, bowes, arrowes, pots;\r\nplant, hunt, or doe anything so well as the rest.\r\n\r\n    _They say he bore a pleasant shew,\r\n    But sure his heart was sad.\r\n    For who can pleasant be, and rest,\r\n    That liues in feare and dread:\r\n    And having life suspected, doth\r\n    It still suspected lead._\r\n\r\nTwo dayes after, _Powhatan_ having disguised himselfe in the most\r\nfearefullest manner he could, caused Captain _Smith_ to be brought\r\nforth to a great house in the woods, and there vpon a mat by the fire\r\nto be left alone. Not long after from behinde a mat that divided the\r\nhouse, was made the most dolefullest noyse he ever heard; then\r\n_Powhatan_, more like a devill than a man, with some two hundred more\r\nas blacke as himselfe, came vnto him and told him now they were\r\nfriends, and presently he should goe to _James_ towne, to send him two\r\ngreat gunnes, and a gryndstone, for which he would giue him the\r\nCountry of _Capahowosick_, and for ever esteeme him as his sonne\r\n_Nantaquoud_.\r\n\r\nSo to _James_ towne with 12 guides _Powhatan_ sent him. That night,\r\nthey quartered in the woods, he still expecting (as he had done all\r\nthis long time of his imprisonment) every houre to be put to one death\r\nor other; for all their feasting. But almightie God (by his divine\r\nprovidence) had mollified the hearts of those sterne _Barbarians_ with\r\ncompassion. The next morning betimes they came to the Fort, where\r\n_Smith_ having vsed the Salvages with what kindnesse he could, he\r\nshewed _Rawhunt_, _Powhatan's_ trusty servant, two demi-Culverings and\r\na millstone to carry _Powhatan_; they found them somewhat too heavie:\r\nbut when they did see him discharge them, being loaded with stones,\r\namong the boughs of a great tree loaded with Isickles, the yce and\r\nbranches came so tumbling downe, that the poore Salvages ran away\r\nhalfe dead with feare. But at last we regained some conference with\r\nthem, and gaue them such toyes: and sent to _Powhatan_, his women, and\r\nchildren such presents, as gaue them in generall full content.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR RIGHT TO THOSE COUNTRIES, TRUE REASONS FOR PLANTATIONS, RARE\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n(_From Advertisements for the Inexperienced._)\r\n\r\nMany good religious devout men have made it a great question, as a\r\nmatter in conscience, by what warrant they might goe to possesse those\r\nCountries, which are none of theirs, but the poore Salvages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Jamestown, Va.~\r\n    The first permanent English settlement in America.]\r\n\r\nWhich poore curiosity will answer it selfe; for God did make the\r\nworld to be inhabited with mankind, and to have his name knowne to all\r\nNations, and from generation to generation: as the people increased,\r\nthey dispersed themselves into such Countries as they found most\r\nconvenient. And here in _Florida_, _Virginia_, _New-England_, and\r\n_Cannada_, is more land than all the people in Christendome can manure\r\n[_cultivate_], and yet more to spare than all the natives of those\r\nCountries can use and culturate. And shall we here keepe such a coyle\r\nfor land, and at such great rents and rates, when there is so much of\r\nthe world uninhabited, and as much more in other places, and as good\r\nor rather better than any wee possesse, were it manured and used\r\naccordingly?\r\n\r\nIf this be not a reason sufficient to such tender consciences; for a\r\ncopper knife and a few toyes, as beads and hatchets, they will sell\r\nyou a whole Countrey [_district_]; and for a small matter, their\r\nhouses and the ground they dwell upon; but those of the _Massachusets_\r\nhave resigned theirs freely.\r\n\r\nNow the reasons for plantations are many. _Adam_ and _Eve_ did first\r\nbegin this innocent worke to plant the earth to remaine to posterity;\r\nbut not without labour, trouble, and industry. Noah and his family\r\nbegan againe the second plantation, and their seed as it still\r\nincreased, hath still planted new Countries, and one Country another,\r\nand so the world to that estate it is; but not without much hazard,\r\ntravell, mortalities, discontents, and many disasters; had those\r\nworthy Fathers and their memorable offspring not beene more diligent\r\nfor us now in those ages, than wee are to plant that yet unplanted for\r\nafter-livers: Had the seed of _Abraham_, our Saviour Christ Jesus and\r\nhis Apostles, exposed themselves to no more dangers to plant the\r\nGospell wee so much professe, than we; even we our selves had at this\r\nmoment beene as Salvages, and as miserable as the most barbarous\r\nSalvage, yet uncivilized.\r\n\r\nThe _Hebrewes_, the _Lacedemonians_, the _Goths_, _Grecians_,\r\n_Romans_, and the rest; what was it they would not undertake to\r\nenlarge their Territories, inrich their subjects, and resist their\r\nenemies? Those that were the founders of those great Monarchies and\r\ntheir vertues, were no silvered idle golden Pharisees, but industrious\r\nhonest hearted Publicans; they regarded more provisions and\r\nnecessaries for their people, than jewels, ease, and delight for\r\nthemselves; riches was their servants, not their masters; they ruled\r\nas fathers, not as tyrants; their people as children, not as slaves;\r\nthere was no disaster could discourage them; and let none thinke they\r\nincountered not with all manner of incumbrances; and what hath ever\r\nbeene the worke of the best great Princes of the world, but planting\r\nof Countries, and civilizing barbarous and inhumane Nations to\r\ncivility and humanity; whose eternall actions fils our histories with\r\nmore honour than those that have wasted and consumed them by warres.\r\n\r\nLastly, the _Portugals_ and _Spaniards_ that first began plantations\r\nin this unknowne world of _America_ till within this 140. yeares\r\n[1476-1616], whose everlasting actions before our eyes, will testifie\r\nour idlenesse and ingratitude to all posterity, and neglect of our\r\nduty and religion we owe our God, our King, and Countrey, and want of\r\ncharity to those poore Salvages, whose Countries we challenge, use and\r\npossesse: except wee be but made to marre what our forefathers made;\r\nor but only tell what they did; or esteeme our selves too good to take\r\nthe like paines where there is so much reason, liberty, and action\r\noffers it selfe. Having as much power and meanes as others, why should\r\nEnglish men despaire, and not doe as much as any? Was it vertue in\r\nthose Hero[e]s to provide that [which] doth maintaine us, and\r\nbasenesse in us to do the like for others to come? Surely no: then\r\nseeing wee are not borne for ourselves but each to helpe other; and\r\nour abilities are much alike at the howre of our birth and the minute\r\nof our death: seeing our good deeds or bad, by faith in Christs\r\nmerits, is all wee have to carry our soules to heaven or hell: Seeing\r\nhonour is our lives ambition, and our ambition after death to have an\r\nhonourable memory of our life; and seeing by no meanes we would be\r\nabated of the dignitie and glory of our predecessors, let us imitate\r\ntheir vertues to be worthily their successors; or at least not hinder,\r\nif not further, them that would and doe their utmost and best\r\nendeavour.\r\n\r\n\r\nASCENT OF THE JAMES RIVER, 1607.\r\n\r\n(_From Newes from Virginia._)\r\n\r\nThe two and twenty day of Aprill [_or rather May, 1607_], Captain\r\n_Newport_ and myself with diuers others, to the number of twenty two\r\npersons, set forward to discouer the Riuer, some fiftie or sixtie\r\nmiles, finding it in some places broader, and in some narrower, the\r\nCountrie (for the moste part) on each side plaine high ground, with\r\nmany freshe Springes, the people in all places kindely intreating vs,\r\ndaunsing, and feasting vs with strawberries, Mulberies, Bread, Fish,\r\nand other their Countrie prouisions whereof we had plenty; for which\r\nCaptaine _Newport_ kindely requited their least fauors with Bels,\r\nPinnes, Needles, beades, or Glasses, which so contented them that his\r\nliberallitie made them follow vs from place to place, and euer kindely\r\nto respect vs. In the midway staying to refresh our selues in a little\r\nIle foure or five sauages came vnto vs which described vnto vs the\r\ncourse of the Riuer, and after in our iourney, they often met vs,\r\ntrading with vs for such prouision as wee had, and arriuing at\r\n_Arsatecke_, hee whom we supposed to bee the chiefe King of all the\r\nrest, moste kindely entertained vs, giuing vs in a guide to go with vs\r\nvp the Riuer to _Powhatan_, of which place their great Emperor taketh\r\nhis name, where he that they honored for King vsed vs kindely.\r\n\r\nBut to finish this discouerie, we passed on further, where within an\r\nile [_a mile_] we were intercepted with great craggy stones in the\r\nmidst of the riuer, where the water falleth so rudely, and with such a\r\nviolence, as not any boat can possibly passe, and so broad disperseth\r\nthe streame, as there is not past fiue or sixe Foote at a low water,\r\nand to the shore scarce passage with a barge, the water floweth foure\r\nfoote, and the freshes by reason of the Rockes haue left markes of the\r\ninundations 8. or 9. foote: The south side is plaine low ground, and\r\nthe north side high mountaines, the rockes being of a grauelly nature,\r\ninterlaced with many vains of glistring spangles.\r\n\r\nThat night we returned to _Powhatan_: the next day (being Whitsunday\r\nafter dinner) we returned to the fals, leauing a mariner in pawn with\r\nthe Indians for a guide of theirs, hee that they honoured for King\r\nfollowed vs by the riuer. That afternoone we trifled in looking vpon\r\nthe Rockes and riuer (further he would not goe) so there we erected a\r\ncrosse, and that night taking our man at _Powhatans_, Captaine\r\n_Newport_ congratulated his kindenes with a Gown and a Hatchet:\r\nreturning to _Arsetecke_, and stayed there the next day to obserue the\r\nheight [_latitude_] thereof, and so with many signes of loue we\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Storm at Sea.~]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STRACHEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STRACHEY[3] was an English gentleman who came over to Virginia\r\nwith Sir Thomas Gates in 1609, and was secretary of the Colony for\r\nthree years. Their ship, the _Sea Venture_, was wrecked on the\r\nBermudas in a terrible tempest, of which he gives the account that\r\nfollows.

Compare the\r\nfollowing selection with Shakspere's \"Tempest,\" Act I., scene 1 and 2,\r\nto \"_Ariel, thy charge_.\" Notice the reference to _Bermoothes_\r\n(Bermudas).\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORM OFF THE BERMUDAS.\r\n\r\n(_From A True Repertory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas\r\nGates._)\r\n\r\nOn St. James his day, July 24, being Monday (preparing for no less all\r\nthe black night before) the clouds gathering thick upon us, and the\r\nwinds singing and whistling most unusually, which made us to cast off\r\nour Pinnace, towing the same until then asterne, a dreadful storm and\r\nhideous began to blow from out the Northeast, which, swelling and\r\nroaring as it were by fits, some hours with more violence than others,\r\nat length did beat all light from heaven, which, like an hell of\r\ndarkness, turned black upon us, so much the more fuller of horror, as\r\nin such cases horror and fear use to overrun the troubled and\r\novermastered senses of all, while (taken up with amazement) the ears\r\nlay so sensible to the terrible cries, and murmurs of the winds and\r\ndistraction of our Company, as who was most armed and best prepared,\r\nwas not a little shaken. . .\r\n\r\nFor four and twenty hours the storm, in a restless tumult, had blown\r\nso exceedingly, as we could not apprehend in our imaginations any\r\npossibility of greater violence, yet did we still find it, not only\r\nmore terrible, but more constant, fury added to fury, and one storm\r\nurging a second, more outrageous than the former, whether it so\r\nwrought upon our fears, or indeed met with new forces. Sometimes\r\nstrikes in our Ship amongst women, and passengers not used to such\r\nhurly and discomforts, made us look one upon the other with troubled\r\nhearts, and panting bosoms, our clamors drowned in the winds, and the\r\nwinds in thunder. Prayers might well be in the heart and lips, but\r\ndrowned in the outcries of the Officers,--nothing heard that could\r\ngive comfort, nothing seen that might encourage hope. . . . .\r\n\r\nOur sails, wound up, lay without their use, and if at any time we bore\r\nbut a Hollocke, or half forecourse, to guide her before the Sea, six\r\nand sometimes eight men, were not enough to hold the whip-staffe in\r\nthe steerage, and the tiller below in the Gunner room; by which may be\r\nimagined the strength of the storm, in which the Sea swelled above the\r\nClouds and gave battle unto heaven. It could not be said to rain, the\r\nwaters like whole Rivers did flood in the ayre. And this I did still\r\nobserve, that whereas upon the Land, when a storm hath poured itself\r\nforth once in drifts of rain, the wind as beaten down, and vanquished\r\ntherewith, not long after endureth,--here the glut of water (as if\r\nthroatling the wind ere while) was no sooner a little emptied and\r\nqualified, but instantly the winds (as having gotten their mouths now\r\nfree and at liberty) spake more loud, and grew more tumultuous and\r\nmalignant. What shall I say? Winds and Seas were as mad as fury and\r\nrage could make them. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nHowbeit this was not all; it pleased God to bring a greater affliction\r\nyet upon us, for in the beginning of the storm we had received\r\nlikewise a mighty leak, and the ship in every joint almost having\r\nspewed out her Okam, before we were aware (a casualty more desperate\r\nthan any other that a Voyage by Sea draweth with it) was grown five\r\nfeet suddenly deep with water above her ballast, and we almost drowned\r\nwithin, whilest we sat looking when to perish from above. This,\r\nimparting no less terror than danger, ran through the whole Ship with\r\nmuch fright and amazement, startled and turned the blood, and took\r\ndown the braves of the most hardy Mariner of them all, insomuch as he\r\nthat before happily felt not the sorrow of others, now began to sorrow\r\nfor himself, when he saw such a pond of water so suddenly broken in,\r\nand which he knew could not (with present avoiding) but instantly sink\r\nhim. . . .\r\n\r\nOnce so huge a Sea brake upon the poop and quarter, upon us, as it\r\ncovered our ship from stern to stem, like a garment or a vast cloud.\r\nIt filled her brimful for a while within, from the hatches up to the\r\nspar deck. . .\r\n\r\nTuesday noon till Friday noon, we bailed and pumped two thousand tun,\r\nand yet, do what we could, when our ship held least in her (after\r\nTuesday night second watch) she bore ten feet deep, at which stay our\r\nextreme working kept her one eight glasses, forbearance whereof had\r\ninstantly sunk us; and it being now Friday, the fourth morning, it\r\nwanted little but that there had been a general determination, to have\r\nshut up hatches and commending our sinful souls to God, committed the\r\nship to the mercy of the sea. Surely that night we must have done it,\r\nand that night had we then perished; but see the goodness and sweet\r\nintroduction of better hope by our merciful God given unto us. Sir\r\nGeorge Summers, when no man dreamed of such happiness, had discovered\r\nand cried, \"Land!\" Indeed, the morning, now three-quarters spent, had\r\nwon a little clearness from the days before, and it being better\r\nsurveyed, the very trees were seen to move with the wind upon the\r\nshore-side.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] Pronounced Str[va]k´ey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN LAWSON.\r\n\r\n~Died 1712.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN LAWSON was a Scotch gentleman who came to America in 1700. In his\r\nown words: \"In the year 1700, when people flocked from all parts of\r\nthe Christian world, to see the solemnity of the grand jubilee at\r\nRome, my intention being at that time to travel, I accidentally met\r\nwith a gentlemen, who had been abroad, and was very well acquainted\r\nwith the ways of living in both Indies; of whom having made inquiry\r\nconcerning them, he assured me that Carolina was the best country I\r\ncould go to; and, that there then lay a ship in the Thames in which I\r\nmight have my passage.\" He resided in Carolina eight years. As \"Gent.\r\nSurveyor-General of North Carolina,\" he wrote his History of North\r\nCarolina, which is an original, sprightly, and faithful account of the\r\neastern section of the State, and contains valuable matter for the\r\nsubsequent historian. It is dedicated to the Lords Proprietors of\r\nCarolina, and was published in 1714.\r\n\r\nHe was taken captive by the Tuscarora Indians, while on a surveying\r\ntrip, and was by them put to death in 1712 on the Neuse River in\r\nNorth Carolina, because, said they, \"he had taken their land,\" by\r\nmarking it off into sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK.\r\n\r\n    History of North Carolina [rare].\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA IN 1700-1708.\r\n\r\n(_From History of North Carolina, 1714._)\r\n\r\nThe first discovery and settlement of this country was by the\r\nprocurement of Sir Walter Raleigh, in conjunction with some public\r\nspirited gentlemen of that age, under the protection of queen\r\nElizabeth; for which reason it was then named Virginia, being begun on\r\nthat part called Ronoak Island, where the ruins of a fort are to be\r\nseen at this day, as well as some old English coins which have been\r\nlately found; and a brass gun, a powder horn, and one small\r\nquarter-deck gun, made of iron staves, and hooped with the same metal;\r\nwhich method of making guns might very probably be made use of in\r\nthose days for the convenience of infant colonies. . . . . .\r\n\r\nI cannot forbear inserting here a pleasant story that passes for an\r\nuncontested truth amongst the inhabitants of this place; which is,\r\nthat the ship which brought the first colonies does often appear\r\namongst them, under sail, in a gallant posture, which they call Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh's ship. And the truth of this has been affirmed to me\r\nby men of the best credit in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Sir Walter Raleigh.~]\r\n\r\nA second settlement of this country was made about fifty years ago, in\r\nthat part we now call Albemarl county, and chiefly in Chuwon precinct,\r\nby several substantial planters from Virginia and other plantations;\r\nwho finding mild winters, and a fertile soil beyond expectation,\r\nproducing everything that was planted to a prodigious increase;\r\n. . . . so that everything seemed to come by nature, the husbandman\r\nliving almost void of care, and free from those fatigues which are\r\nabsolutely requisite in winter countries, for providing fodder and\r\nother necessaries; these encouragements induced them to stand their\r\nground, although but a handful of people, seated at great distances\r\none from another, and amidst a vast number of Indians of different\r\nnations, who were then in Carolina.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I say, the fame of this new discovered summer country\r\nspread through the neighboring colonies, and in a few years drew a\r\nconsiderable number of families thereto, who all found land enough to\r\nsettle themselves in (had they been many thousands more), and that\r\nwhich was very good and commodiously seated both for profit and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, most of the plantations in Carolina naturally enjoy a\r\nnoble prospect of large and spacious rivers, pleasant savannas and\r\nfine meadows, with their green liveries interwoven with beautiful\r\nflowers of most glorious colors, which the several seasons afford;\r\nhedged in with pleasant groves of the ever famous tulip tree, the\r\nstately laurels and bays, equalizing the oak in bigness and growth,\r\nmyrtles, jessamines, woodbines, honeysuckles, and several other\r\nfragrant vines and evergreens, whose aspiring branches shadow and\r\ninterweave themselves with the loftiest timbers, yielding a pleasant\r\nprospect, shade and smell, proper habitations for the sweet singing\r\nbirds, that melodiously entertain such as travel through the woods of\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nThe Planters possessing all these blessings, and the produce of great\r\nquantities of wheat and indian corn, in which this country is very\r\nfruitful, as likewise in beef, pork, tallow, hides, deer skins, and\r\nfurs; for these commodities the new England men and Bermudians visited\r\nCarolina in their barks and sloops, and carried out what they made,\r\nbringing them in exchange, rum, sugar, salt, molasses, and some\r\nwearing apparel, though the last at very extravagant prices.\r\n\r\nAs the land is very fruitful, so are the planters kind and hospitable\r\nto all that come to visit them; there being very few housekeepers but\r\nwhat live very nobly, and give away more provisions to coasters and\r\nguests who come to see them than they expend amongst their own\r\nfamilies. . .\r\n\r\nThe easy way of living in that plentiful country makes a great many\r\nplanters very negligent, which, were they otherwise, that colony might\r\nnow have been in a far better condition than it is, as to trade and\r\nother advantages, which an universal industry would have led them\r\ninto. The women are the most industrious sex in that place, and, by\r\ntheir good housewifery, make a great deal of cloth of their own\r\ncotton, wool and flax; some of them keeping their families, though\r\nlarge, very decently appareled, both with linens and woolens, so that\r\nthey have no occasion to run into the merchants' debt, or lay their\r\nmoney out on stores for clothing.\r\n\r\n. . . As for those women that do not expose themselves to the weather,\r\nthey are often very fair, and generally as well featured as you shall\r\nsee anywhere, and have very brisk, charming eyes which sets them off\r\nto advantage. . . . .\r\n\r\nBoth sexes are generally spare of body and not choleric, nor easily\r\ncast down at disappointments and losses, seldom immoderately grieving\r\nat misfortunes, unless for the loss of their nearest relations and\r\nfriends, which seems to make a more than ordinary impression upon\r\nthem. Many of the women are very handy in canoes and will manage them\r\nwith great dexterity and skill, which they become accustomed to in\r\nthis watery country. They are ready to help their husbands in any\r\nservile work, as planting, when the season of the weather requires\r\nexpedition; pride seldom banishing good housewifery. The girls are\r\nnot bred up to the wheel and sewing only, but the dairy and the\r\naffairs of the house they are very well acquainted withal; so that you\r\nshall see them, whilst very young, manage their business with a great\r\ndeal of conduct and alacrity. The children of both sexes are very\r\ndocile and learn any thing with a great deal of care and method, and\r\nthose that have the advantages of education write very good hands, and\r\nprove good accountants, which is most coveted, and, indeed, most\r\nnecessary in these parts. The young men are commonly of a bashful,\r\nsober behaviour; few proving prodigals to consume what the industry of\r\ntheir parents has left them, but commonly improve it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEST HOME OF THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\n(_From History of North Carolina._)\r\n\r\nThey have a third sort of feasts and dances, which are always when the\r\nharvest of corn is ended, and in the spring. The one to return thanks\r\nto the good spirit for the fruits of the earth; the other, to beg the\r\nsame blessings for the succeeding year. And to encourage the young men\r\nto labour stoutly in planting their maiz and pulse, they set up a sort\r\nof idol in the field, which is dressed up exactly like an Indian,\r\nhaving all the Indians habit, besides abundance of Wampum and their\r\nmoney, made of shells, that hangs about his neck. The image none of\r\nthe young men dare approach; for the old ones will not suffer them to\r\ncome near him, but tell them that he is some famous Indian warrior\r\nthat died a great while ago, and now is come amongst them to see if\r\nthey work well, which if they do, he will go to the good spirit and\r\nspeak to him to send them plenty of corn, and to make the young men\r\nall expert hunters and mighty warriors. All this while, the king and\r\nold men sit around the image and seemingly pay a profound respect to\r\nthe same. One great help to these Indians in carrying on these\r\ncheats, and inducing youth to do as they please, is, the uninterrupted\r\nsilence which is ever kept and observed with all the respect and\r\nveneration imaginable.\r\n\r\nAt these feasts which are set out with all the magnificence their fare\r\nallows of, the masquerades begin at night and not before. There is\r\ncommonly a fire made in the middle of the house, which is the largest\r\nin the town, and is very often the dwelling of their king or war\r\ncaptain; where sit two men on the ground upon a mat; one with a\r\nrattle, made of a gourd, with some beans in it; the other with a drum\r\nmade of an earthen pot, covered with a dressed deer skin, and one\r\nstick in his hand to beat thereon; and so they both begin the song\r\nappointed. At the same time one drums and the other rattles, which is\r\nall the artificial music of their own making I ever saw amongst them.\r\nTo these two instruments they sing, which carries no air with it, but\r\nis a sort of unsavory jargon; yet their cadences and raising of their\r\nvoices are formed with that equality and exactness that, to us\r\nEuropeans, it seems admirable how they should continue these songs\r\nwithout once missing to agree, each with the others note and tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BYRD.\r\n\r\n~1674=1744.~\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BYRD, second of the name, and the first native Virginian\r\nwriter, was born at Westover, his father's estate on the James below\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Westover, Home of William Byrd.~]\r\n\r\nThe following inscription on his tomb at Westover gives a sketch of\r\nhis life and services well worth preserving:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies the Honourable William Byrd, Esq., being born to one of the\r\namplest fortunes in this country, he was sent early to England for\r\nhis education, where under the care and direction of Sir Robert\r\nSouthwell, and ever favoured with his particular instructions, he made\r\na happy proficiency in polite and various learning. By the means of\r\nthe same noble friend, he was introduced to the acquaintance of many\r\nof the first persons of that age for knowledge, wit, virtue, birth, or\r\nhigh station, and particularly contracted a most intimate and bosom\r\nfriendship with the learned and illustrious Charles Boyle, Earl of\r\nOrrery.\r\n\r\n\"He was called to the bar in the Middle Temple, studied for some time\r\nin the Low Countries, visited the Court of France, and was chosen\r\nFellow of the Royal Society.

Spotswood's enchanted Castle on one Side of the\r\nStreet, and a Baker's Dozen of ruinous Tenements on the other, where\r\nso many German Familys had dwelt some Years ago; but are now remov'd\r\nten Miles higher, in the Fork of Rappahannock, to Land of their Own.\r\nThere had also been a Chappel about a Bow-Shot from the Colonel's\r\nhouse, at the End of an Avenue of Cherry Trees, but some pious people\r\nhad lately burnt it down, with intent to get another built nearer to\r\ntheir own homes.\r\n\r\nHere I arriv'd about three o clock, and found only Mrs. Spotswood at\r\nHome, who receiv'd her Old acquaintance with many a gracious Smile. I\r\nwas carry'd into a Room elegantly set off with Pier Glasses, the\r\nlargest of which came soon after to an odd Misfortune. Amongst other\r\nfavourite Animals that cheer'd this Lady's Solitude, a Brace of Tame\r\nDeer ran familiarly about the House, and one of them came to stare at\r\nme as a Stranger. But unluckily Spying his own Figure in the Glass, he\r\nmade a spring over the Tea Table that stood under it, and shatter'd\r\nthe Glass to pieces, and falling-back upon the Tea Table, made a\r\nterrible Fracas among the China. This Exploit was so sudden, and\r\naccompany'd with such a Noise, that it surpriz'd me, and perfectly\r\nfrighten'd Mrs. Spotswood. But twas worth all the Damage to shew the\r\nModeration and good humour with which she bore this disaster.\r\n\r\nIn the Evening, the noble Colo. came home from his Mines, who saluted\r\nme very civilly, and Mrs. Spotswood's Sister, Miss Theky, who had been\r\nto meet him _en Cavalier_, was so kind too as to bid me welcome. We\r\ntalkt over a Legend of old Storys, supp'd about 9, and then prattl'd\r\nwith the Ladys, til twas time for a Travellour to retire. In the mean\r\ntime I observ'd my old Friend to be very Uxorious, and exceedingly\r\nfond of his Children. This was so opposite to the Maxims he us'd to\r\npreach up before he was marryed, that I cou'd not forbear rubbing up\r\nthe Memory of them. But he gave a very good-natur'd turn to his Change\r\nof Sentiments, by alleging that whoever brings a poor Gentlewoman into\r\nso solitary a place, from all her Friends and acquaintance, wou'd be\r\nungrateful not to use her and all that belongs to her with all\r\npossible Tenderness.\r\n\r\nWe all kept Snug in our several apartments till Nine, except Miss\r\nTheky, who was the Housewife of the Family. At that hour we met over a\r\nPot of Coffee, which was not quite strong enough to give us the Palsy.\r\nAfter Breakfast the Colo. and I left the Ladys to their Domestick\r\nAffairs, and took a turn in the Garden, which has nothing beautiful\r\nbut 3 Terrace Walks that fall in Slopes one below another. I let him\r\nunderstand, that besides the pleasure of paying him a Visit, I came to\r\nbe instructed by so great a Master in the Mystery of Making of Iron,\r\nwherein he had led the way, and was the Tubal Cain of Virginia. He\r\ncorrected me a little there, by assuring me he was not only the first\r\nin this Country, but the first in North America, who had erected a\r\nregular Furnace. . . That the 4 Furnaces now at work in Virginia\r\ncirculated a great Sum of Money for Provisions and all other\r\nnecessarys in the adjacent Countys. That they took off a great Number\r\nof Hands from Planting Tobacco, and employ'd them in Works that\r\nproduced a large Sum of Money in England to the persons concern'd,\r\nwhereby the Country is so much the Richer. That they are besides a\r\nconsiderable advantage to Great Britain, because it lessens the\r\nQuantity of Bar Iron imported from Spain, Holland, Sweden, Denmark,\r\nand Muscovy, which us'd to be no less than 20,000 Tuns yearly. . .\r\n\r\nThen I inquired after his own Mines, and hoped, as he was the first\r\nthat engaged in this great undertaking, that he had brought them to\r\nthe most perfection. . . He said it was true His works were of the\r\noldest Standing; but that his long absence in England, and the\r\nwretched Management of Mr. Greame, whom he had entrusted with his\r\nAffairs, had put him back very much. That what with Neglect and\r\nSeverity, above 80 of his Slaves were lost while he was in England,\r\nand most of his Cattle starved. That his Furnace stood still great\r\npart of the time, and all his Plantations ran to ruin. That indeed he\r\nwas rightly serv'd for committing his Affairs to the care of a\r\nMathematician, whose thoughts were always among the Stars. That\r\nnevertheless, since his return, he had apply'd himself to rectify his\r\nSteward's Mistakes, and bring his Business again into Order. That now\r\nhe contriv'd to do every thing with his own People, except raising the\r\nMine and running the Iron, by which he had contracted his Expence very\r\nmuch. Nay, he believ'd that by his directions he cou'd bring sensible\r\nNegroes to perform those parts of the work tolerably well. . . Our\r\nConversation on this Subject continued till Dinner, which was both\r\nelegant and plentifull.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was devoted to the ladys, who shew'd me one of their\r\nmost beautiful Walks. They conducted me thro' a Shady Lane to the\r\nLanding, and by the way made me drink some very fine Water that issued\r\nfrom a Marble Fountain, and ran incessantly. Just behind it was a\r\ncover'd Bench, where Miss Theky often sat and bewail'd her Virginity.\r\nThen we proceeded to the River, which is the South Branch of\r\nRappahannock, about 50 Yards wide, and so rapid that the Ferry Boat is\r\ndrawn over by a Chain, and therefore called the Rapidan. At night we\r\ndrank prosperity to all the Colonel's Projects in a Bowl of Rack\r\nPunch, and then retired to our Devotions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Chapel, University of Georgia, at Athens. Erected\r\n1832.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISMAL SWAMP.\r\n\r\n(_From The Dividing Line._)\r\n\r\n_1728, March._--Tis hardly credible how little the Bordering\r\ninhabitants were acquainted with this mighty Swamp, notwithstanding\r\nthey had liv'd their whole lives within Smell of it. Yet, as great\r\nStrangers as they were to it, they pretended to be very exact in their\r\nAccount of its Demensions, and were positive it could not be above 7\r\nor 8 Miles wide, but knew no more of the Matter than Star-gazers know\r\nof the Distance of the Fixt Stars. At the Same time, they were Simple\r\nenough to amuse our Men with Idle Stories of the Lyons, Panthers,\r\nand Alligators, they were like to encounter in that dreadful Place.\r\n\r\nIn short, we saw plainly there was no Intelligence of this Terra\r\nIncognita to be got, but from our own Experience. For that Reason it\r\nwas resolv'd to make the requisite Disposition to enter it next\r\nMorning. We alloted every one of the Surveyors for this painful\r\nEnterprise, with 12 Men to attend them. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nBesides this Luggage at their Backs, they were oblig'd to measure the\r\ndistance, mark the Trees, and clear the way for the Surveyors every\r\nstep they went. It was really a Pleasure to see with how much\r\nCheerfulness they undertook, and with how much Spirit they went thro'\r\nall this Drudgery. . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nAltho' there was no need of Example to inflame Persons already so\r\ncheerful, yet to enter the People with the better grace, the Author\r\nand two more of the Commissioners accompanied them half a Mile into\r\nthe Dismal. The Skirts of it were thinly Planted with Dwarf Reeds and\r\nGall-Bushes, but when we got into the Dismal itself, we found the\r\nReeds grew there much taller and closer, and, to mend the matter, was\r\nso interlac'd with bamboe-briars, that there was no scuffling thro'\r\nthem without the help of Pioneers. At the same time, we found the\r\nGround moist and trembling under our feet like a Quagmire, insomuch\r\nthat it was an easy Matter to run a Ten-Foot-Pole up to the Head in\r\nit, without exerting any uncommon Strength to do it.\r\n\r\nTwo of the Men, whose Burthens were the least cumbersome, had orders\r\nto march before, with their Tomahawks, and clear the way, in order to\r\nmake an Opening for the Surveyors. By their Assistance we made a Shift\r\nto push the Line half a Mile in 3 Hours, and then reacht a small piece\r\nof firm Land, about 100 Yards wide, Standing up above the rest like\r\nan Island. Here the people were glad to lay down their Loads and take\r\na little refreshment, while the happy man, whose lot it was to carry\r\nthe Jugg of Rum, began already, like Æsop's Bread-Carriers, to find it\r\ngrow a good deal lighter. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nSince the Surveyors had enter'd the Dismal, they had laid Eyes on no\r\nliving Creature: neither Bird nor Beast, Insect nor Reptile came in\r\nView. Doubtless, the Eternal Shade that broods over this mighty Bog,\r\nand hinders the sun-beams from blessing the Ground, makes it an\r\nuncomfortable Habitation for any thing that has life. Not so much as a\r\nZealand Frog cou'd endure so Aguish a Situation.\r\n\r\nIt had one Beauty, however, that delighted the Eye, tho' at the\r\nExpense of all the other Senses; the Moisture of the Soil preserves a\r\ncontinual Verdure, and makes every Plant an Evergreen, but at the same\r\ntime the foul Damps ascend without ceasing, corrupt the Air, and\r\nrender it unfit for Respiration. Not even a Turkey-Buzzard will\r\nventure to fly over it, no more than the Italian Vultures will over\r\nthe filthy Lake Avernus, or the Birds of the Holy Land over the Salt\r\nSea, where Sodom and Gomorrah formerly stood.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n_How they Slept in the Dismal Swamp._--They first cover'd the Ground\r\nwith Square Pieces of Cypress bark, which now, in the Spring, they\r\ncou'd easily Slip off the Tree for that purpose. On this they Spread\r\ntheir Bedding; but unhappily the Weight and Warmth of their Bodies\r\nmade the Water rise up betwixt the Joints of the Bark, to their great\r\nInconvenience. Thus they lay not only moist, but also exceedingly\r\ncold, because their Fires were continually going out. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nWe could get no Tidings yet of our Brave Adventurers, notwithstanding\r\nwe despacht men to the likeliest Stations to enquire after them. They\r\nwere still Scuffleing in the Mire, and could not Possibly forward the\r\nLine this whole day more than one Mile and 64 Chains. Every Step of\r\nthis Day's Work was thro' a cedar Bog, where the Trees were somewhat\r\nSmaller and grew more into a Thicket. It was now a great Misfortune to\r\nthe Men to find their Provisions grow less as their Labour grew\r\ngreater. . . . Tho' this was very severe upon English Stomachs, yet\r\nthe People were so far from being discomfited at it, that they still\r\nkept up their good Humour, and merrily told a young Fellow in the\r\nCompany, who lookt very Plump and Wholesome, that he must expect to go\r\nfirst to Pot, if matters shou'd come to Extremity.\r\n\r\nThis was only said by way of Jest, yet it made Him thoughtful in\r\nearnest. However, for the present he return'd them a very civil\r\nanswer, letting them know that, dead or alive, he shou'd be glad to be\r\nuseful to such worthy good friends. But, after all, this Humourous\r\nSaying had one very good effect; for that younker, who before was a\r\nlittle enclin'd by his Constitution to be lazy, grew on a Sudden\r\nExtreamly Industrious, that so there might be less Occasion to\r\ncarbonade him for the good of his Fellow-Travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUSCARORA INDIANS AND THEIR LEGEND OF A CHRIST.\r\n\r\n(_From History of the Dividing Line._)\r\n\r\n_1729, November._--By the Strength of our Beef, we made a shift to\r\nwalk about 12 Miles, crossing Blowing and Tewaw-homini Creeks. And\r\nbecause this last Stream receiv'd its Appellation from the Disaster of\r\na Tuscarora Indian, it will not be Straggling much out of the way to\r\nsay something of that Particular Nation.\r\n\r\nThese Indians were heretofore very numerous and powerful, making,\r\nwithin time of Memory, at least a Thousand Fighting Men. Their\r\nHabitation, before the War with Carolina, was on the North Branch of\r\nNeuse River, commonly call'd Connecta Creek, in a pleasant and\r\nfruitful Country. But now the few that are left of that Nation live on\r\nthe North Side of MORATUCK, which is all that Part of Roanok below the\r\ngreat Falls, towards ALBEMARLE Sound.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were Seven Towns of these Savages, lying not far from\r\neach other, but now their Number is greatly reduc'd. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThese Indians have a very odd Tradition amongst them, that many years\r\nago, their Nation was grown so dishonest, that no man cou'd keep any\r\nGoods, or so much as his loving Wife to himself. That, however, their\r\nGod, being unwilling to root them out for their crimes, did them the\r\nhonour to send a Messenger from Heaven to instruct them, and set Them\r\na perfect Example of Integrity and kind Behaviour towards one another.\r\n\r\nBut this holy Person, with all his Eloquence and Sanctity of Life, was\r\nable to make very little Reformation amongst them. Some few Old men\r\ndid listen a little to his Wholesome Advice, but all the Young fellows\r\nwere quite incorrigible. They not only Neglected his Precepts, but\r\nderided and Evil Entreated his Person. At last, taking upon Him to\r\nreprove some Young Rakes of the Conechta Clan very sharply for their\r\nimpiety, they were so provok'd at the Freedom of his Rebukes, that\r\nthey tied him to a Tree, and shot him with Arrows through the Heart.\r\nBut their God took instant Vengeance on all who had a hand in that\r\nMonstrous Act, by Lightning from Heaven, & has ever since visited\r\ntheir Nation with a continued Train of Calamities, nor will he ever\r\nleave off punishing, and wasting their People, till he shall have\r\nblotted every living Soul of them out of the World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD ... 1750-1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LAURENS.\r\n\r\n~1724=1792.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LAURENS, one of the patriot-fathers of our country, was born in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina. He was educated in his native city, and,\r\nbecoming a merchant, amassed a fortune in business. In 1771 he\r\ntravelled with his children in Europe in order to educate them.\r\nReturning home he became in 1775 a member of the Provincial Congress,\r\nand on Hancock's resignation, president of the Continental Congress.\r\nHe was appointed in 1779 minister to Holland, and on his way was\r\ncaptured by the British and confined in the Tower fifteen months. He\r\nbecame acquainted with Edmund Burke while in London. He was twice\r\noffered pardon if he would serve the British Ministry, but of course\r\nhe declined. During this imprisonment, his son John, called the\r\n\"Bayard of the Revolution\" for his daring bravery, was killed in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nAfter his release, being exchanged for Lord Cornwallis, he was\r\nappointed one of the ministers to negotiate peace in 1782. His health\r\nwas so impaired by the cruel treatment of his jailers, that he could\r\ntake no further active part in affairs, and he passed the rest of his\r\nlife in the retirement of his plantation. On his death, his body was\r\nburned, according to his express will, the first instance, in this\r\ncountry, of cremation.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Martha married Dr. David Ramsay, the historian.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Political Papers [some of which have been published by the South\r\n        Carolina Historical Society].\r\n\r\nThese are of great value in a study of the Revolutionary times.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PATRIOT IN THE TOWER.\r\n\r\n(_From Narrative of his Confinement in the Tower._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Tower of London.~]\r\n\r\nAbout 11 o'clock at night I was sent under a strong guard, up three\r\npair of stairs in Scotland Yard, into a very small chamber. Two king's\r\nmessengers were placed for the whole night at one door, and a\r\nsubaltern's guard of soldiers at the other. As I was, and had been for\r\nsome days, so ill as to be incapable of getting into or out of a\r\ncarriage, or up or down stairs, without help, I looked upon all this\r\nparade to be calculated for intimidation. My spirits were good and I\r\nsmiled inwardly. The next morning, 6th October, from Scotland Yard, I\r\nwas conducted again under guard to the secretary's office, White\r\nHall. . . I was first asked, by Lord Stormont, \"If my name was Henry\r\nLaurens.\" \"Certainly, my Lord, that is my name.\" . . . . His Lordship\r\nthen said, \"Mr. Laurens, we have a paper here\" (holding the paper up),\r\n\"purporting to be a commission from Congress to you, to borrow money\r\nin Europe for the use of Congress.\" . . . I replied, \"My Lords, your\r\nLordships are in possession of the paper, and will make such use of it\r\nas your Lordships shall judge proper.\" I had not destroyed this paper,\r\nas it would serve to establish the rank and character in which I was\r\nemployed by the United States. . . . . From White Hall, I was\r\nconducted in a close hackney coach, under the charge of Colonel\r\nWilliamson, a polite, genteel officer, and two of the illest-looking\r\nfellows I had ever seen. The coach was ordered to proceed by the\r\nmost private ways to the Tower. It had been rumored that a rescue\r\nwould be attempted. At the Tower the Colonel delivered me to Major\r\nGore, the residing Governor, who, as I was afterwards well informed,\r\nhad previously concerted a plan for mortifying me. He ordered rooms\r\nfor me in the most conspicuous part of the Tower (the parade). The\r\npeople of the house, particularly the mistress, entreated the Governor\r\nnot to burthen them with a prisoner. He replied, \"It is necessary. I\r\nam determined to expose him.\" This was, however, a lucky determination\r\nfor me. The people were respectful and kindly attentive to me, from\r\nthe beginning of my confinement to the end; and I contrived, after\r\nbeing told of the Governor's humane declaration, so to garnish my\r\nwindows by honeysuckles, and a grape-vine running under them, as to\r\nconceal myself entirely from the sight of starers, and at the same\r\ntime to have myself a full view of them. Governor Gore conducted me to\r\nmy apartments at a warder's house. As I was entering the house, I\r\nheard some of the people say, \"Poor old gentleman, bowed down with\r\ninfirmities. He is come to lay his bones here.\" My reflection was, \"I\r\nshall not leave a bone with you.\"\r\n\r\nI was very sick, but my spirits were good, and my mind foreboding good\r\nfrom the event of being a prisoner in London. Their Lordships' orders\r\nwere: \"To confine me a close prisoner; to be locked up every night; to\r\nbe in the custody of two wardens, who were not to suffer me to be out\r\nof their sight _one moment_, day or night; to allow me no liberty of\r\nspeaking to any person, nor to permit any person to speak to me; to\r\ndeprive me of the use of pen and ink; to suffer no letter to be\r\nbrought to me, nor any to go from me,\" etc. As an apology, I presume\r\nfor their first rigor, the wardens gave me their orders to peruse. . .\r\n\r\nAnd now I found myself a close prisoner, indeed; shut up in two small\r\nrooms, which together made about twenty feet square; a warder my\r\nconstant companion; and a fixed bayonet under my window; not a friend\r\nto converse with, and no prospect of a correspondence. . . .\r\n\r\n_September 23d._--For some time past I have been frequently and\r\nstrongly tempted to make my escape from the Tower, assured, \"It was\r\nthe advice and desire of all my friends, the thing might be easily\r\neffected, the face of American affairs was extremely gloomy. That I\r\nmight have eighteen hours' start before I was missed; time enough to\r\nreach Margate and Ostend; that it was believed there would be no\r\npursuit,\" etc., etc. I had always said, \"I hate the name of a\r\nrunaway.\" At length I put a stop to farther applications by saying, \"I\r\nwill not attempt an escape. The gates were opened for me to enter;\r\nthey shall be opened for me to go out of the Tower. God Almighty sent\r\nme here for some purpose. I am determined to see the end of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n~1732=1799.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON'S life is so well known, it is so simple, so grand,\r\nthat a few words can tell it, and yet volumes would not exhaust it.\r\nHis mother's remark, \"George was always a good son,\" sums up his\r\ncharacter; and his title, \"Father of his Country,\" sums up his\r\nlife-work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~George Washington.~]\r\n\r\nHe was born at Pope's Creek, Westmoreland County, Virginia, and became\r\na surveyor, being employed in that capacity at the early age of\r\nsixteen by Lord Fairfax, governor of Virginia. He joined the English\r\ntroops sent under General Braddock against the French in 1756, and his\r\nbravery and good sense in this expedition gained him great renown. In\r\n1775 he was made commander-in-chief of the American forces against\r\nthe English and he conducted the war of the Revolution to a successful\r\nissue in 1783. He was the first president of the United States, being\r\nelected in 1789, and again in 1793, declining a third term in 1797. He\r\nretired to private life at Mt. Vernon, his home in Virginia. Here he\r\ndied, and here he lies buried, his tomb being a shrine of pilgrimage\r\nfor all his countrymen and admirers.\r\n\r\nInnumerable monuments rise all over our land commemorating his virtues\r\nand pointing him out as a model for the youth of America. One of the\r\nfinest is that at Richmond, designed by Crawford, an equestrian statue\r\nin bronze, surrounded by colossal figures of Jefferson, Mason, Patrick\r\nHenry, Lewis, Marshall, and Nelson. The marble statue by Houdon in the\r\nCapitol at Richmond is considered the best figure of Washington; it\r\nwas done from life in 1788. Other noble memorials are the Column at\r\nBaltimore, and the great obelisk at Washington City, called the\r\nWashington Monument, the latter designed by Robert Mills, of South\r\nCarolina, and intended originally to have a colonnade around the base\r\ncontaining the statues of the illustrious men of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    State Papers, Addresses, Letters--12 volumes.\r\n\r\nWashington's writings are like his character, simple, clear, sensible,\r\nwithout any pretensions to special culture or literary grace.

However, as the Congress desire it, I\r\nwill enter upon the momentous duty, and exert every power I possess in\r\ntheir service, and for the support of the glorious cause. I beg they\r\nwill accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of\r\ntheir approbation.\r\n\r\nBut, lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavorable to my\r\nreputation, I beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in the room,\r\nthat I, this day, declare with the utmost sincerity, I do not think\r\nmyself equal to the command I am honored with.\r\n\r\nAs to pay, Sir, I beg leave to assure the Congress, that, as no\r\npecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous\r\nemployment, at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not\r\nwish to make any profit from it. I will keep an exact account of my\r\nexpenses. Those, I doubt not, they will discharge, and that is all I\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Washington Taking the Oath of Office.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nA MILITARY DINNER-PARTY.\r\n\r\n[_Letter to Dr. John Cochran, West Point, 16 August, 1779._]\r\n\r\nDear Doctor: I have asked Mrs. Cochran and Mrs. Livingston to dine\r\nwith me to-morrow; but am I not in honor bound to apprise them of\r\ntheir fare? As I hate deception, even where the imagination only is\r\nconcerned, I will. It is needless to premise, that my table is large\r\nenough to hold the ladies. Of this they had ocular proof yesterday. To\r\nsay how it is usually covered, is rather more essential; and this\r\nshall be the purport of my letter.\r\n\r\nSince our arrival at this happy spot, we have had a ham, sometimes a\r\nshoulder of bacon, to grace the head of the table; a piece of roast\r\nbeef adorns the foot; and a dish of beans, or greens, almost\r\nimperceptible, decorates the centre. When the cook has a mind to cut a\r\nfigure, which I presume will be the case to-morrow, we have two\r\nbeef-steak pies, or dishes of crabs, in addition, one on each side of\r\nthe centre dish, dividing the space and reducing the distance between\r\ndish and dish to about six feet, which without them would be near\r\ntwelve feet apart. Of late he has had the surprising sagacity to\r\ndiscover, that apples will make pies; and it is a question, if, in the\r\nviolence of his efforts, we do not get one of apples, instead of\r\nhaving both of beef-steaks. If the ladies can put up with such\r\nentertainment, and will submit to partake of it on plates, once tin\r\nbut now iron (not become so by the labor of scouring), I shall be\r\nhappy to see them; and am, dear Doctor, yours, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVICE TO A FAVORITE NEPHEW.\r\n\r\n[_From a Letter to Bushrod Washington.--Newburgh, 15 Jan., 1783._]\r\n\r\nRemember, that it is not the mere study of the law, but to become\r\neminent in the profession of it, that is to yield honor and profit.\r\nThe first was your choice; let the second be your ambition.\r\nDissipation is incompatible with both; the company, in which you will\r\nimprove most, will be least expensive to you; and yet I am not such a\r\nstoic as to suppose that you will, or to think it right that you\r\nshould, always be in company with senators and philosophers; but of\r\nthe juvenile kind let me advise you to be choice. It is easy to make\r\nacquaintances, but very difficult to shake them off, however irksome\r\nand unprofitable they are found, after we have once committed\r\nourselves to them. The indiscretions, which very often they\r\ninvoluntarily lead one into, prove equally distressing and\r\ndisgraceful.\r\n\r\nBe courteous to all, but intimate with few; and let those few be well\r\ntried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant\r\nof slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity\r\nbefore it is entitled to the appellation.\r\n\r\nLet your heart feel for the distresses and afflictions of every one,\r\nand let your hand give in proportion to your purse; remembering always\r\nthe estimation of the widow's mite, but, that it is not every one who\r\nasketh, that deserveth charity; all, however, are worthy of the\r\ninquiry, or the deserving may suffer.\r\n\r\nDo not conceive that fine clothes make fine men, any more than fine\r\nfeathers make fine birds. A plain, genteel dress is more admired, and\r\nobtains more credit, than lace and embroidery, in the eyes of the\r\njudicious and sensible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGES FROM THE FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n1796.\r\n\r\n_Union and Liberty._--Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every\r\nligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to\r\nfortify or confirm the attachment.\r\n\r\nThe unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also now\r\ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice\r\nof your real independence; the support of your tranquillity at home;\r\nyour peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very\r\nliberty which you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee, that\r\nfrom different causes, and from different quarters, much pains will be\r\ntaken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction\r\nof this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against\r\nwhich the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most\r\nconstantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously)\r\ndirected; it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate\r\nthe immense value of your national union to your collective and\r\nindividual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and\r\nimmovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak\r\nof it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity;\r\nwatching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing\r\nwhatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be\r\nabandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every\r\nattempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to\r\nenfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.\r\n\r\nFor this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens\r\nby birth, or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to\r\nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to\r\nyou in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of\r\npatriotism, more than any appellation derived from local\r\ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same\r\nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a\r\ncommon cause, fought and triumphed together; the independence and\r\nliberty you possess, are the work of joint counsels, and joint\r\nefforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\r\n\r\nBut these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves\r\nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more\r\nimmediately to your interest. Here, every portion of our country finds\r\nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the\r\nunion of the whole. . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and\r\nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to\r\nfind in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength,\r\ngreater resource, proportionably greater security from external\r\ndanger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign\r\nnations; and, what is of inestimable value, they must derive from\r\nunion an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves,\r\nwhich so frequently afflict neighbouring countries not tied together\r\nby the same government; which their own rivalships alone would be\r\nsufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances,\r\nattachments, and intrigues, would stimulate and imbitter. Hence,\r\nlikewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military\r\nestablishments, which under any form of government are inauspicious to\r\nliberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to\r\nrepublican liberty. In this sense it is, that your union ought to be\r\nconsidered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the\r\none ought to endear to you the preservation of the other. . . . .\r\n\r\n_Party Spirit._--I have already intimated to you the danger of parties\r\nin the State, with particular references to the founding them on\r\ngeographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive\r\nview, and warn you in the most solemn manner, against the baleful\r\neffects of the spirit of party generally.\r\n\r\nThis spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its\r\nroot in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under\r\ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled,\r\nor repressed; but in those of the popular form, it is seen in its\r\ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\r\n\r\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the\r\nspirit of revenge natural to party dissensions, which in different\r\nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is\r\nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more\r\nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which\r\nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose\r\nin the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the\r\nchief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his\r\ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own\r\nelevation on the ruins of public liberty.\r\n\r\nWithout looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which\r\nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and\r\ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party, are sufficient to make it\r\nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain\r\nit. . . . .\r\n\r\nThere is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks\r\nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the\r\nspirit of liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and,\r\nin governments of a monarchical cast, patriotism may look with\r\nindulgence, if not with favour, upon the spirit of party. But in those\r\nof the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a\r\nspirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is\r\ncertain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary\r\npurpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought\r\nto be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire\r\nnot to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it\r\nbursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.\r\n\r\n_Religion and Morality._--Of all the dispositions and habits which\r\nlead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable\r\nsupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who\r\nshould labour to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these\r\nfirmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician,\r\nequally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A\r\nvolume could not trace all their connections with private and public\r\nfelicity. Let it simply be asked, where is the security for property,\r\nfor reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation\r\n_desert_ the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in\r\ncourts of justice?\r\n\r\nAnd let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be\r\nmaintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence\r\nof refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and\r\nexperience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can\r\nprevail in exclusion of religious principle.\r\n\r\nIt is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary\r\nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or\r\nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere\r\nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the\r\nfoundation of the fabrick? . . . .\r\n\r\nObserve good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace\r\nand harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct; and\r\ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be\r\nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great\r\nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a\r\npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can\r\ndoubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan\r\nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a\r\nsteady adherence to it; can it be that Providence has not connected\r\nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at\r\nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRICK HENRY.\r\n\r\n~1736=1799.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThis great orator was born at Studley, Hanover County, Virginia; and,\r\nwhile his early education in books was not extensive, he studied man\r\nand nature from life very deeply and thoroughly. He attempted farming\r\nand merchandising for some years, then read law and at the age of\r\ntwenty-four was admitted to the bar where his splendid powers had full\r\nscope. In 1765 he was elected to the State Legislature, or House of\r\nBurgesses, as it was then called.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Thomas Jefferson, \"Mr. Henry certainly gave the first\r\nimpulse to the ball of the Revolution.\" During the war, he served at\r\nfirst in the field, and later in the Legislature, and as governor,\r\nbeing elected three times. He retired from public life in 1791 and\r\ndevoted himself to his law practice, by which he gained wealth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Old St. John's Church, Richmond, Va.~]\r\n\r\nHis most famous speech was delivered before the Convention sitting in\r\ncouncil in the old St. John's Church, Richmond, 1775, after the House\r\nof Burgesses had been dissolved by the royal governor. An extract from\r\nthis speech, as given in Wirt's \"Life of Henry,\" follows. No\r\nfaithfully exact copy of his speeches is preserved, for he never\r\nwrote them out, and his eloquence was so overmastering that no one\r\ncould listen and report at the same time. He takes his place among the\r\ngreat orators of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Speeches, legal and political, (as they have been gathered from\r\n        traditionary reports).\r\n\r\nSee his Life by _Wirt_, _Tyler_, and _W.

We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful\r\ntruth--and listen to the song of that siren, till she transforms us\r\ninto beasts. Is this,\" he asked, \"the part of wise men, engaged in a\r\ngreat and arduous struggle for liberty? Were we disposed to be of the\r\nnumber of those, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not,\r\nthe things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For his\r\npart, whatever anguish of spirit it might cost, _he_ was willing to\r\nknow the whole truth; to know the worst, and provide for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had,\" he said, \"but one lamp by which his feet were guided; and\r\nthat was the lamp of experience. He knew of no way of judging of the\r\nfuture but by the past. And judging by the past, he wished to know\r\nwhat there had been in the conduct of the British ministry for the\r\nlast ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen had been\r\npleased to solace themselves and the house? Is it that insidious smile\r\nwith which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir;\r\nit will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be\r\nbetrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of\r\nour petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our\r\nwaters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work\r\nof love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be\r\nreconciled, that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us\r\nnot deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and\r\nsubjugation,--the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask\r\ngentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not\r\nto force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible\r\nmotive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the\r\nworld, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No,\r\nsir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can be meant for no\r\nother. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which\r\nthe British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we [to]\r\noppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that\r\nfor the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the\r\nsubject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which\r\nit is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to\r\nentreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find, which have\r\nnot been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive\r\nourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to\r\navert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned--we have\r\nremonstrated--we have supplicated--we have prostrated ourselves before\r\nthe throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the\r\ntyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have\r\nbeen slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and\r\ninsult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been\r\nspurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after\r\nthese things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\r\nreconciliation. _There is no longer any room for hope._ If we wish to\r\nbe free--if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges\r\nfor which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to\r\nabandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and\r\nwhich we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious\r\nobject of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight!--I repeat it,\r\nsir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts, is all\r\nthat is left us!\"\r\n\r\n\"They tell us, sir,\" continued Mr. Henry, \"that we are weak--unable to\r\ncope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger?\r\nWill it be the next week or the next year? Will it be when we are\r\ntotally disarmed and when a British guard shall be stationed in every\r\nhouse? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we\r\nacquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our\r\nbacks, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies\r\nshall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a\r\nproper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our\r\npower. Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty\r\nand in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any\r\nforce which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not\r\nfight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the\r\ndestinies of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our\r\nbattles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to\r\nthe vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no\r\nelection. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to\r\nretire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and\r\nslavery! Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the\r\nplains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come!! I repeat\r\nit, sir, let it come!!!\r\n\r\n\"It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry,\r\npeace, peace,--but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The\r\nnext gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash\r\nof resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand\r\nwe here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is\r\nlife so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of\r\nchains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God--I know not what course\r\nothers may take; but as for me,\" cried he, with both his arms extended\r\naloft, his brows knit, every feature marked with the resolute purpose\r\nof his soul, and his voice swelled to its boldest note of\r\nexclamation,--\"give me liberty, or give me death!\" See also under\r\n_Wirt_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON.\r\n\r\n~1742=1779.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Fort Moultrie, S. C. Fort Sumter in the Distance.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON was born at \"Drayton Hall,\" on the Ashley River,\r\nSouth Carolina, and was sent in 1753 to England to be educated. He\r\nwent in the care of Chief-Justice Charles Pinckney, who was taking\r\nhis two sons, Charles Cotesworth and Thomas, for the same purpose. He\r\nreturned home in 1764, studied law, and in 1771 was appointed by the\r\nking privy-councillor for South Carolina. He espoused, however, the\r\ncause of the Revolution, with ardor, and was chosen president of the\r\nCouncil of Safety and of the Provincial Congress. As Chief-Justice of\r\nthe State, he declared that the king \"had abdicated the government and\r\nhad no more authority over the people of South Carolina.\" He also\r\ndealt with the Indians and exercised a wholesome influence over them\r\nin behalf of the State.\r\n\r\nHe left in manuscript valuable state papers and a narrative of the\r\nearly part of the Revolution, which his son, Governor John Drayton,\r\nedited and published, and from which the extract is taken. His style\r\nis clear, simple, and flowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE III.'s ABDICATION OF POWER IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n[_From the Charge to the Grand Jury of Charleston District, 1776._]\r\n\r\nThus, as I have on the foot of the best authorities made it evident,\r\nthat George III. King of Britain, has endeavoured to subvert the\r\nconstitution of this country, by breaking the original contract\r\nbetween king and people; by the advice of wicked persons has violated\r\nthe fundamental laws; and has withdrawn himself by withdrawing the\r\nconstitutional benefits of the kingly office, and his protection out\r\nof this country; from such a result of injuries, from such a\r\nconjuncture of circumstances--the law of the land authorizes me to\r\ndeclare, and it is my duty boldly to declare the law, that George III.\r\nKing of Britain, has abdicated the government, and that the throne is\r\nthereby vacant; that is, _he has no authority over us, and we owe no\r\nobedience to him_. . . The new constitution is wisely adapted to\r\nenable us to trade with foreign nations, and thereby, to supply our\r\nwants in the _cheapest_ markets in the universe; to extend our trade\r\ninfinitely beyond what it has ever been known; to encourage\r\nmanufactures among us; and it is peculiarly formed, to promote the\r\nhappiness of the people, from among whom, by virtue and merit, _the\r\npoorest_ man may arrive at _the highest dignity_.--Oh, Carolinians!\r\nhappy would you be under this new constitution, if you knew your happy\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nPossessed of a constitution of government, founded upon so generous,\r\nequal, and natural a principle,--a government expressly calculated to\r\nmake the people rich, powerful, virtuous, and happy, who can wish to\r\nchange it, to return under a Royal government; the vital principles of\r\nwhich, are the reverse in every particular! It was my duty to lay this\r\nhappy constitution before you, in its genuine light--it is your duty\r\nto understand--to instruct others--and to defend it. . . . .\r\n\r\nI think it my duty to declare in the awful seat of justice and before\r\nAlmighty God, that in my opinion, the Americans can have no safety but\r\nby the Divine Favour, their own virtue, and their being so prudent, as\r\n_not to leave it in the power of the British rulers to injure them_.\r\nIndeed the ruinous and deadly injuries received on our side; and the\r\njealousies entertained, and which, in the nature of things, must daily\r\nincrease against us on the other; demonstrate to a mind, in the least\r\ngiven to reflection upon the rise and fall of empires, that true\r\nreconcilement never can exist between Great Britain and America, the\r\nlatter being in subjection to the former.\r\n\r\nThe Almighty created America to be independent of Britain; let us\r\nbeware of the impiety of being backward to act as instruments in the\r\nAlmighty Hand, now extended to accomplish his purpose; and by the\r\ncompletion of which alone, America, in the nature of human affairs,\r\ncan be secure against the craft and insidious designs of _her enemies\r\nwho think her prosperity and power already by far too great_. In a\r\nword, our piety and political safety are so blended, that to refuse\r\nour labours in this divine work, is to refuse to be a great, a free, a\r\npious, and a happy people!\r\n\r\nAnd now having left the important alternative, political happiness or\r\nwretchedness, under God, in a great degree in your own hands; I pray\r\nthe supreme Arbiter of the affairs of men, so to direct your judgment,\r\nas that you may act agreeable to what seems to be his will, revealed\r\nin his miraculous works in behalf of America, bleeding at the altar of\r\nliberty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n~1743=1826.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON, the \"Sage of Monticello,\" and founder of the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, was born at Shadwell, Albemarle County,\r\nVirginia. He was educated at William and Mary College, and early\r\ndeveloped a rare taste for study, music, and general culture. His is\r\none of the greatest and most interesting figures in our history. He\r\nreceived and adorned all the positions in the gift of his\r\nfellow-citizens, from that of member of the State Legislature to that\r\nof President of the United States, which office he twice filled. He is\r\nconsidered the founder of the present Democratic party in politics;\r\nand he gained imperishable fame as the author of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. He spent five years in France, succeeding Benjamin\r\nFranklin as minister to that country, and he introduced into the\r\nUnited States the decimal system of currency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Monticello, the Home of Thomas Jefferson, Albemarle\r\nCounty, Va.~]\r\n\r\nHis love for country life induced him to retire to Monticello, his\r\nplace in Albemarle County, where he spent his declining years in\r\nplanning and establishing the University of Virginia. His love of\r\nfreedom in every possible form is shown in his plan for the\r\nUniversity, which was, unlike most colleges of the times, to be under\r\nthe patronage of no church, and the students were to be controlled\r\nlike any community of citizens. He was also opposed to slavery. (_See\r\nhis Notes on Virginia._)\r\n\r\nHe died at Monticello, July 4, 1826, on the same day with John Adams,\r\njust fifty years after the great event of their lives, the declaration\r\nof independence of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following inscription was at his own request put upon his\r\ntombstone:\r\n\r\n    THOMAS JEFFERSON,\r\n\r\n    Author of the Declaration of Independence, of the Statute of\r\n    Virginia for Religious Freedom and Father\r\n    of the University of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Autobiography, Essays, Treatises, Letters, Reports, Messages, and\r\n        Addresses, (9 volumes).\r\n\r\nJefferson's style as a political writer is considered a model: and\r\nevery citizen of the United States should be well acquainted with the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, which has been called by competent\r\ncritics the most remarkable paper of its kind in existence.\r\n\r\nHis writings show a well trained mind, accustomed to observe closely\r\nand to delight in thought and truth and freedom. _See under George\r\nTucker._ Consult also his Life, by Tucker, by Morse, by Sarah N.\r\nRandolph, his great-grand-daughter, Memoirs by Thos. J. Randolph\r\n(1830).\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MAXIMS.\r\n\r\nGovernment has nothing to do with opinion.\r\n\r\nResistance to tyrants is obedience to God. (_Motto on his seal._)\r\n\r\nEqual and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion,\r\nreligious or political; peace, commerce, and honest friendship with\r\nall nations, entangling alliances with none.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS OPINIONS AT THE AGE OF TWENTY.\r\n\r\n(_From a letter to John Page._)\r\n\r\nPerfect happiness, I believe, was never intended by the Deity to be\r\nthe lot of one of his creatures in this world; but that he has very\r\nmuch put in our power the nearness of our approaches to it, is what I\r\nhave steadfastly believed. The most fortunate of us, in our journey\r\nthrough life, frequently meet with calamities and misfortunes, which\r\nmay greatly afflict us; and, to fortify our minds against the attacks\r\nof these calamities and misfortunes, should be one of the principal\r\nstudies and endeavors of our lives. The only method of doing this is\r\nto assume a perfect resignation to the Divine will, to consider\r\nwhatever does happen must happen; and that by our uneasiness, we\r\ncannot prevent the blow before it does fall, but we may add to its\r\nforce after it has fallen. These considerations, and others such as\r\nthese, may enable us in some measure to surmount the difficulties\r\nthrown in our way; to bear up with a tolerable degree of patience\r\nunder this burthen of life; and to proceed with a pious and unshaken\r\nresignation, till we arrive at our journey's end, when we may deliver\r\nup our trust into the hands of him who gave it, and receive such\r\nreward as to him shall seem proportioned to our merit. Such, dear\r\nPage, will be the language of the man who considers his situation in\r\nthis life, and such should be the language of every man who would\r\nwish to render that situation as easy as the nature of it will admit.\r\nFew things will disturb him at all; nothing will disturb him much.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENERY AT HARPER'S FERRY AND AT THE NATURAL BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n(_From Notes on Virginia, written in 1781, published in 1801._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Harper's Ferry.~]\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Patowmac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of\r\nthe most stupendous scenes in nature. You stand on a very high point\r\nof land. On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along\r\nthe foot of the mountain an hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left\r\napproaches the Patowmac, in quest of a passage also. In the moment of\r\ntheir junction they rush together against the mountain, rend it\r\nasunder, and pass off to the sea. The first glance of this scene\r\nhurries our senses into the opinion, that this earth has been created\r\nin time, that the mountains were formed first, that the rivers began\r\nto flow afterwards, that in this place particularly they have been\r\ndamned up by the Blue ridge of mountains, and have formed an ocean\r\nwhich filled the whole valley; that continuing to rise they have at\r\nlength broken over at this spot, and have torn the mountain down from\r\nits summit to its base. The piles of rock on each hand, but\r\nparticularly on the Shenandoah, the evident marks of their disrupture\r\nand avulsion from their beds by the most powerful agents of nature,\r\ncorroborate the impression. But the distant finishing which nature has\r\ngiven to the picture, is of a very different character. It is a true\r\ncontrast to the foreground. It is as placid and delightful, as that is\r\nwild and tremendous. For the mountain being cloven asunder, she\r\npresents to your eye, through the cleft, a small catch of smoothe\r\nblue horizon, at an infinite distance in the plain country, inviting\r\nyou, as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around, to pass\r\nthrough the breach and participate of the calm below. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe Natural Bridge, the most sublime of nature's works, . . . is on\r\nthe ascent of a hill, which seems to have been cloven through its\r\nlength by some great convulsion. The fissure, just at the bridge, is,\r\nby some admeasurements, 270 feet deep, by others only 205. It is about\r\n45 feet wide at the bottom, and 90 feet at the top; this of course\r\ndetermines the length of the bridge, and its height from the water.\r\nIts breadth in the middle, is about 60 feet, but more at the ends, and\r\nthe thickness of the mass, at the summit of the arch, about 40 feet. A\r\npart of this thickness is constituted by a coat of earth, which gives\r\ngrowth to many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides,\r\nis one solid rock of lime-stone.\r\n\r\nThe arch approaches the semi-elliptical form; but the larger axis of\r\nthe ellipsis, which would be the cord of the arch, is many times\r\nlonger than the transverse. Though the sides of this bridge are\r\nprovided in some parts with a parapet of fixed rocks, yet few men have\r\nthe resolution to walk to them, and look over into the abyss. You\r\ninvoluntarily fall on your hands and feet, creep to the parapet, and\r\npeep over it. Looking down from this height about a minute, gave me a\r\nviolent head-ach.\r\n\r\nIf the view from the top be painful and intolerable, that from below\r\nis delightful in an equal extreme. It is impossible for the emotions\r\narising from the sublime, to be felt beyond what they are here: so\r\nbeautiful an arch, so elevated, so light, and springing as it were up\r\nto heaven! the rapture of the spectator is really indescribable! The\r\nfissure continuing narrow, deep, and straight, for a considerable\r\ndistance above and below the bridge, opens a short but very pleasing\r\nview of the North mountain on one side, and Blue ridge on the other,\r\nat the distance each of them of about five miles. This bridge is in\r\nthe county of Rockbridge, to which it has given name, and affords a\r\npublic and commodious passage over a valley, which cannot be crossed\r\nelsewhere for a considerable distance. The stream passing under it is\r\ncalled Cedar-creek.\r\n\r\n\r\nON FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS OPINION.\r\n\r\nCompulsion makes hypocrites, not converts.\r\n\r\nIt is error alone that needs the support of government: truth can\r\nstand by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DISCOURSES OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\nSuch are the fragments remaining to us to show a master-workman, and\r\nthat his system of morality was the most benevolent and sublime that\r\nhas ever been taught, and consequently more perfect than those of any\r\nof the ancient philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n(_From an Act Passed in the Assembly of Virginia, 1786._)\r\n\r\nWell aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all\r\nattempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by\r\ncivil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and\r\nmeanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our\r\nreligion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to\r\npropagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to\r\ndo; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as\r\nwell as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and\r\nuninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others,\r\nsetting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true\r\nand infallible, and as such endeavouring to impose them on others,\r\nhath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part\r\nof the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish\r\ncontributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he\r\ndisbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; . . . that to suffer the civil\r\nmagistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to\r\nrestrain the profession or propagation of principles, on the\r\nsupposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at\r\nonce destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge\r\nof that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and\r\napprove or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square\r\nwith or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful\r\npurposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when\r\nprinciples break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and\r\nfinally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself, that\r\nshe is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing\r\nto fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of\r\nher natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be\r\ndangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them:\r\n\r\n_Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly_, That no man shall\r\nbe compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or\r\nministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or\r\nburthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account\r\nof his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to\r\nprofess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of\r\nreligion and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or\r\naffect their civil capacities.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO HIS DAUGHTER, MARTHA JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n(_Written in France, May 21, 1787._)\r\n\r\nI write you, my dear Patsy, from the canal of Languedoc, on which I am\r\nat present sailing, as I have been for a week past,--cloudless skies\r\nabove, limpid waters below, and on each hand, a row of nightingales in\r\nfull chorus. This delightful bird had given me a rich treat before, at\r\nthe fountain of Vaucluse. After visiting the tomb of Laura, at\r\nAvignon, I went to see this fountain--a noble one of itself, and\r\nrendered forever famous by the songs of Petrarch, who lived near it. I\r\narrived there somewhat fatigued, and sat down by the fountain to\r\nrepose myself. It gushes, of the size of a river, from a secluded\r\nvalley of the mountain, the ruins of Petrarch's château being perched\r\non a rock two hundred feet perpendicular above. To add to the\r\nenchantment of the scene, every tree and bush was filled with\r\nnightingales in full song. I think you told me that you had not yet\r\nnoticed this bird. As you have trees in the garden of the Convent [_in\r\nParis, where Martha was at school_], there might be nightingales in\r\nthem, and this is the season of their song. Endeavor, my dear, to make\r\nyourself acquainted with the music of this bird, that when you return\r\nto your own country you may be able to estimate its merit in\r\ncomparison with that of the mocking-bird. The latter has the advantage\r\nof singing through a great part of the year, whereas the nightingale\r\nsings but about five or six weeks in the spring, and a still shorter\r\nterm, and with a more feeble voice, in the fall.\r\n\r\nI expect to be in Paris about the middle of next month. By that time\r\nwe may begin to expect our dear Polly [_the younger daughter, Maria_]\r\nIt will be a circumstance of inexpressible comfort to me to have you\r\nboth with me once more. The object most interesting to me for the\r\nresidue of my life, will be to see you both developing daily those\r\nprinciples of virtue and goodness which will make you valuable to\r\nothers and happy in yourselves, and acquiring those talents and that\r\ndegree of science which will guard you at all times against _ennui_,\r\nthe most dangerous poison of life. A mind always employed is always\r\nhappy. This is the true secret, the grand recipe, for felicity. The\r\nidle are the only wretched. In a world which furnishes so many\r\nemployments which are useful, and so many which are amusing, it is our\r\nown fault if we ever know what _ennui_ is, or if we are ever driven to\r\nthe miserable resource of gaming, which corrupts our dispositions, and\r\nteaches us a habit of hostility against all mankind.\r\n\r\nWe are now entering the port of Toulouse, where I quit my bark, and of\r\ncourse must conclude my letter. Be good and be industrious, and you\r\nwill be what I shall most love in the world. Adieu, my dear child.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n                    TH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON'S LAST LETTER, IN ANSWER TO AN INVITATION TO BE PRESENT AT\r\nTHE CELEBRATION OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE,\r\nIN WASHINGTON.--TO MR. WEIGHTMAN, MAYOR OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n    MONTICELLO, _June 24, 1826_.\r\n\r\n_Respected Sir:_ The kind invitation received from you, on the part of\r\nthe citizens of the city of Washington, to be present with them at\r\ntheir celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of American\r\nIndependence, as one of the surviving signers of an instrument\r\npregnant with our own, and the fate of the world, is most flattering\r\nto myself, and heightened by the honorable accompaniment proposed for\r\nthe comfort of such a journey. It adds sensibly to the sufferings of\r\nsickness, to be deprived by it of a personal participation in the\r\nrejoicing of that day. But acquiescence is a duty, under circumstances\r\nnot placed among those we are permitted to control. I should, indeed,\r\nwith peculiar delight, have met and exchanged there congratulations\r\npersonally with the small band, the remnant of that host of worthies,\r\nwho joined with us on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we\r\nwere to make for our country, between submission or the sword; and to\r\nhave enjoyed with them the consolatory fact, that our fellow-citizens,\r\nafter half a century of experience and prosperity, continue to approve\r\nthe choice we made. May it be to the world, what I believe it will be\r\n(to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all), the\r\nsignal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish\r\nignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and\r\nto assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form\r\nwhich we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded\r\nexercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or\r\nopening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of\r\nscience has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that\r\nthe mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor\r\na favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by\r\nthe grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves,\r\nlet the annual return of this day, forever refresh our recollections\r\nof these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.\r\n\r\nI will ask permission here to express the pleasure with which I should\r\nhave met my ancient neighbors of the city of Washington and its\r\nvicinities, with whom I passed so many years of a pleasing social\r\nintercourse; an intercourse which so much relieved the anxieties of\r\nthe public cares, and left impressions so deeply engraved in my\r\naffections as never to be forgotten. With my regret that ill health\r\nforbids me the gratification of an acceptance, be pleased to receive\r\nfor yourself, and those for whom you write, the assurance of my\r\nhighest respect and friendly attachments.\r\n\r\n                    TH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID RAMSAY.\r\n\r\n~1749=1815.~\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID RAMSAY was a native of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, was\r\neducated at Princeton, studied medicine at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, and removed to Charleston, S. C., for the practice of\r\nhis profession. He soon acquired celebrity both as a physician and as\r\na patriot in the Revolutionary struggles. He was a member of the\r\nCouncil of Safety and a surgeon in the army. He was one of the forty\r\nprominent citizens who were sent as hostages to St. Augustine at the\r\ncapture of Charleston in 1780 and kept for eleven months in close\r\nconfinement. His death was caused by wounds received from a maniac,\r\nwho shot him in the street for testifying as to his mental\r\nunsoundness.\r\n\r\nHis second wife was Martha Laurens, daughter of Henry Laurens, who had\r\nspent ten years in Europe and who was always active in intellectual\r\nand benevolent pursuits. She assisted her husband in his writing and\r\nprepared her sons for college. Two of their daughters long had an\r\nexcellent and celebrated school for girls in Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Orations; Medical Essays.\r\n    History of South Carolina.\r\n    Life of Washington.\r\n    Memoir of Martha L.

The extinction of Indian claims by a\r\ncession of territory to the king, was necessary to the safety of the\r\nadvancing settlers. This was obtained in 1755. In that year, Governor\r\nGlen met the Cherokee warriors in their own country, and held a treaty\r\nwith them. After the usual ceremonies were ended, the governor made a\r\nspeech to the assembled warriors in the name of his king; representing\r\nhis great power, wealth, and goodness, and his particular regard for\r\nhis children, the Cherokees. He reminded them of the happiness they\r\nhad long enjoyed by living under his protection, and added, that he\r\nhad many presents to make them and expected they would surrender a\r\nshare of their territories in return. He informed them of the wicked\r\ndesigns of the French, and hoped they would permit none of them to\r\nenter their towns. He demanded lands to build two forts in their\r\ncountry, to protect them against their enemies, and to be a retreat to\r\ntheir friends and allies, who furnished them with arms, ammunition,\r\nhatchets, clothes, and everything that they wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen the governor had finished his speech, Chulochcullak arose, and in\r\nanswer spoke to the following effect:\r\n\r\n\"What I now speak, our father the great king should hear. We are\r\nbrothers to the people of Carolina, one house covers us all.\" Then\r\ntaking a boy by the hand, he presented him to the governor, saying,\r\n\"We, our wives, and our children, are all children of the great king\r\nGeorge; I have brought this child, that when he grows up he may\r\nremember our agreement on this day, and tell it to the next\r\ngeneration, that it may be known forever.\" Then opening his bag of\r\nearth, and laying the same at the governor's feet, he said: \"We freely\r\nsurrender a part of our lands to the great king. The French want our\r\npossessions, but we will defend them while one of our nation shall\r\nremain alive.\" Then delivering the governor a string of wampum, in\r\nconfirmation of what he said, he added: \"My speech is at an end--it is\r\nthe voice of the Cherokee nation. I hope the governor will send it to\r\nthe king, that it may be kept forever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSERGEANT JASPER AT FORT MOULTRIE, _28th June, 1776_.\r\n\r\n(_From the History of South Carolina._)\r\n\r\nThe loss of the garrison was ten men killed and twenty-two wounded.\r\nLieutenants Hall and Gray were among the latter. Though there were\r\nmany thousand shots fired from the shipping, yet the works were little\r\ndamaged: those which struck the fort were ineffectually buried in its\r\nsoft wood. Hardly a hut or tree on the island escaped.\r\n\r\nWhen the British appeared off the coast, there was so scanty a stock\r\nof lead, that to supply the musketry with bullets, it became necessary\r\nto strip the windows of the dwelling-houses in Charleston of their\r\nweights. Powder was also very scarce. The proportion allotted for the\r\ndefence of the fort was but barely sufficient for slow firing. This\r\nwas expended with great deliberation. The officers in their turn\r\npointed the guns with such exactness that most of their shot took\r\neffect. In the beginning of the action, the flag-staff was shot away.\r\nSergeant Jasper of the Grenadiers immediately jumped on the beach,\r\ntook up the flag and fastened it on a sponge-staff. With it in his\r\nhand he mounted the merlon; and, though the ships were directing their\r\nincessant broadsides at the spot, he deliberately fixed it. The day\r\nafter the action, President Rutledge presented him with a sword, as a\r\nmark of respect for his distinguished valor. . . . .\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the action, the lady of Colonel Bernard Elliott\r\npresented an elegant pair of colors to the second regiment, which had\r\nso bravely defended Fort Moultrie. Her address on the occasion\r\nconcluded thus: \"I make not the least doubt, under heaven's\r\nprotection, you will stand by these colors as long as they wave in the\r\nair of liberty.\" In reply a promise was made that \"they should be\r\nhonorably supported, and never should be tarnished, by the second\r\nregiment.\" This engagement was literally fulfilled. Three years after\r\nthey were planted on the British lines at Savannah: one by Lieutenant\r\nBush who was immediately shot down; Lieutenant Hume in the act of\r\nplanting his was also shot down; and Lieutenant Gray in supporting\r\nthem received a mortal wound. The brave Sergeant Jasper on seeing\r\nLieutenant Hume fall, took up the color and planted it. In doing so,\r\nhe received a wound which terminated in death; but on the retreat\r\nbeing ordered he brought the colors off with him. These were taken at\r\nthe fall of Charleston and are said to be now in the tower of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMPTER AND MARION.\r\n\r\n(_From the Same._)\r\n\r\nAs the British advanced to the upper country of South Carolina, a\r\nconsiderable number of the determined friends of independence\r\nretreated before them and took refuge in North Carolina. In this\r\nclass was Colonel Sumpter; a gentleman who had formerly commanded one\r\nof the continental regiments, and who was known to possess a great\r\nshare of bravery and other military talents. In a very little time\r\nafter he had forsaken his home, a detachment of the British turned his\r\nwife and family out of doors, burned the house and everything that was\r\nin it. A party of these exiles from South Carolina who had convened in\r\nNorth Carolina made choice of Colonel Sumpter to be their leader. At\r\nthe head of this little band of freemen he soon returned to his own\r\nState, and took the field against the victorious British. He made this\r\ngallant effort at a time when the inhabitants had generally abandoned\r\nthe idea of supporting their own independence, and when he had every\r\ndifficulty to encounter. The State was no longer in a condition to\r\npay, clothe, or feed the troops who had enrolled themselves under his\r\ncommand. His followers were, in a great measure, unfurnished with arms\r\nand ammunition; and they had no magazines from which they might draw a\r\nsupply. The iron tools, on the neighboring farms, were worked up for\r\ntheir use by common blacksmiths into rude weapons of war. They\r\nsupplied themselves, in part, with bullets by melting the pewter which\r\nthey were furnished by private housekeepers. They sometimes came to\r\nbattle when they had not three rounds a man; and some were obliged to\r\nkeep at a distance, till, by the fall of others, they were supplied\r\nwith arms. When they proved victorious they were obliged to rifle the\r\ndead and wounded of their arms and ammunition to equip them for their\r\nnext engagement. . . . . .\r\n\r\nGeneral Francis Marion was born at Winyaw in 1733. His grandfather was\r\na native of Languedoc, and one of the many Protestants who fled from\r\nFrance to Carolina to avoid persecution on the account of religion. He\r\nleft thirteen children, the eldest of whom was the father of the\r\ngeneral. Francis Marion, when only sixteen years of age, made choice\r\nof a sea-faring life. On his first voyage to the West Indies he was\r\nshipwrecked. The crew, consisting of six persons, took to the open\r\nboat without water or provisions; . . . . they were six days in the\r\nboat before they made land. Two of the crew perished. Francis Marion\r\nwith three others reached land. This disaster, and the entreaties of\r\nhis mother, induced him to quit the sea. . . . . .\r\n\r\nOn the approach of General Gates he advanced with a small party\r\nthrough the country towards the Santee. On his arrival there he found\r\na number of his countrymen ready and willing to put themselves under\r\nhis command, to which he had been appointed by General Gates. This\r\ncorps afterwards acquired the name of Marion's brigade. . . In all\r\nthese marches Marion and his men lay in the open air with little\r\ncovering, and with little other food than sweet potatoes and meat\r\nmostly without salt. Though it was the unhealthy season of autumn, yet\r\nsickness seldom occurred. The general fared worse than his men; for\r\nhis baggage having caught fire by accident, he had literally but half\r\na blanket to cover him from the dews of the night, and but half a hat\r\nto shelter him from the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n~1751=1836.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON, fourth president of the United States, was born at Port\r\nConway, Virginia, and was a graduate of Princeton, where he was a\r\nprofound and excellent student. He and Jefferson were always friends;\r\nyet they differed in some political opinions, for Madison was a\r\nFederalist, and he contributed many papers to the periodical of that\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 he married Mrs. Dorothy Payne Todd, a lady of extraordinary\r\nbeauty and rare accomplishments; and the reign of Mrs. Dolly Madison\r\nat the White House is esteemed its most brilliant period. \"Memoirs and\r\nLetters of Dolly Madison,\" by her grand-niece, published in 1887 at\r\nBoston, is a most interesting book.\r\n\r\nPresident Madison died at his home \"Montpelier,\" Orange County,\r\nVirginia.

He was pre-eminently the scholar, the profound\r\nconstructive thinker, and his limitations were such as belong to that\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION OF LAFAYETTE, (IN LETTERS TO JEFFERSON).\r\n\r\n(_From Rives' Life of Madison._[4])\r\n\r\n(_17 Oct., 1784._)--The time I have lately passed with the Marquis has\r\ngiven me a pretty thorough insight into his character. With great\r\nnatural frankness of temper, he unites much address and very\r\nconsiderable talents. In his politics, he says his three hobby-horses\r\nare the alliance between France and the United States, the union of\r\nthe latter, and the manumission of the slaves. The two former are the\r\ndearer to him, as they are connected with his personal glory. . . . .\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n(_20 August, 1785._)--Subsequent to the date of mine in which I gave\r\nmy idea of Lafayette, I had other opportunities of penetrating his\r\ncharacter. Though his foibles did not disappear, all the favorable\r\ntraits presented themselves in a stronger light, on closer inspection.\r\nHe certainly possesses talents which might figure in any line. If he\r\nis ambitious, it is rather of the praise which virtue dedicates to\r\nmerit than of the homage which fear renders to power. His disposition\r\nis naturally warm and affectionate, and his attachment to the United\r\nStates unquestionable. Unless I am grossly deceived, you will find his\r\nzeal sincere and useful, whenever it can be employed on behalf of the\r\nUnited States without opposition to the essential interests of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEA FOR A REPUBLIC, ALTHOUGH A NEW FORM OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n(_From the \"Federalist,\" 14th No._)\r\n\r\nBut why is the experiment of an extended Republic to be rejected,\r\nmerely because it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the\r\npeople of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the\r\nopinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a\r\nblind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule\r\nthe suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own\r\nsituation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly\r\nspirit posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world\r\nfor the example, of the numerous improvements displayed on the\r\nAmerican theatre in favor of private rights and public happiness. Had\r\nno important step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for\r\nwhich a precedent could not be discovered; no government established\r\nof which an exact model did not present itself,--the people of the\r\nUnited States might, at this moment, have been numbered among the\r\nmelancholy victims of misguided counsels; must, at best, have been\r\nlaboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed\r\nthe liberties of the rest of mankind. Happily for America,--happily,\r\nwe trust, for the whole human race, they pursued a new and more noble\r\ncourse. They accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the\r\nannals of human society. They reared the fabrics of government, which\r\nhave no model on the face of the globe. They formed the design of a\r\ngreat Confederacy, which it is incumbent on their successors to\r\nimprove and perpetuate. If their works betray imperfections, we wonder\r\nat the fewness of them. If they erred most in the structure of the\r\nUnion, this was the work most difficult to be executed; this is the\r\nwork which has been new-modelled by the act of your convention; and it\r\nis that act on which you are now to deliberate and decide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n(\"_drawn by Mr. Madison, amid the tranquil scenes of his own final\r\nretirement; and intended . . . . for his family and friends._\")\r\n\r\nThe strength of his character lay in his integrity, his love of\r\njustice, his fortitude, the soundness of his judgment, and his\r\nremarkable prudence; to which he joined an elevated sense of patriotic\r\nduty, and a reliance on the enlightened and impartial world as the\r\ntribunal by which a lasting sentence on his career would be\r\npronounced. Nor was he without the advantage of a stature and figure\r\nwhich, however insignificant when separated from greatness of\r\ncharacter, do not fail, when combined with it, to aid the attraction.\r\nWhat particularly distinguished him was a modest dignity, which at\r\nonce commanded the highest respect and inspired the purest attachment.\r\n\r\nAlthough not idolizing public opinion, no man could be more attentive\r\nto the means of ascertaining it. In comparing the candidates for\r\noffice, he was particularly inquisitive as to their standing with the\r\npublic, and the opinion entertained of them by men of public weight.\r\nOn the important questions to be decided by him, he spared no pains to\r\ngain information from all quarters; freely asking from all whom he\r\nheld in esteem, and who were intimate with him, a free communication\r\nof their sentiments; receiving with great attention the arguments and\r\nopinions offered to him; and making up his own judgment with all the\r\nleisure that was permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] By permission of Little, Brown, & Company, Boston, as also the two\r\nfollowing extracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

He served as a soldier in the Revolution\r\nand then practised law in Richmond. With Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\r\nand Elbridge Gerry, he was sent to Paris in 1797 to treat of public\r\naffairs; and it was on this occasion that Pinckney made the famous\r\nreply to the propositions of Talleyrand, \"Millions for defence, not a\r\ncent for tribute.\"\r\n\r\nHe was chief-justice of the United States for thirty-five years, being\r\nappointed in 1800 and holding the position until his death. One of the\r\nmost celebrated cases over which he presided was the trial of Aaron\r\nBurr, 1807, in which William Wirt led the prosecution, and Luther\r\nMartin and Burr himself, the defence. His services on the Supreme\r\nBench were not only judicial but patriotic also, as his decisions on\r\npoints of constitutional law, being broad, clear, strong, and\r\nstatesman-like, have done much to settle the foundations of our\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHe died in Philadelphia whither he had gone for medical treatment. A\r\nhandsome statue of him by Story adorns the west grounds of the Capitol\r\nat Washington, and his is one of the six colossal bronze figures\r\naround the Washington Monument in Richmond.

From this general\r\ngrant of jurisdiction no exception is made of those cases in which a\r\nState may be a party. When we consider the situation of the government\r\nof the Union and of a State in relation to each other, the nature of\r\nour Constitution, the subordination of the State governments to that\r\nConstitution, the great purpose for which jurisdiction over all cases\r\narising under the Constitution and laws of the United States is\r\nconfided to the judicial department, are we at liberty to insert in\r\nthis general grant an exception of those cases in which a State may be\r\na party? Will the spirit of the Constitution justify this attempt to\r\ncontrol its words? We think it will not. We think a case arising under\r\nthe Constitution or laws, of the United States is cognizable in the\r\ncourts of the Union, whoever may be the parties to that case. The laws\r\nmust be executed by individuals acting within the several States. If\r\nthese individuals may be exposed to penalties, and if the courts of\r\nthe Union cannot correct the judgments by which these penalties may\r\nbe enforced, the course of government may be at any time arrested by\r\nthe will of one of its members. Each member will possess a _veto_ on\r\nthe will of the whole.\r\n\r\nThat the United States form, for many and most important purposes, a\r\nsingle nation has not yet been denied. These States are constituent\r\nparts of the United States. They are members of one great empire, for\r\nsome purposes sovereign, for some purposes subordinate. In a\r\ngovernment so constituted is it unreasonable that the judicial power\r\nshould be competent to give efficacy to the constitutional laws of the\r\nlegislature? That department can decide on the validity of the\r\nConstitution or law of a State, if it be repugnant to the Constitution\r\nor to a law of the United States. Is it unreasonable that it should\r\nalso be empowered to decide on the judgment of a State tribunal\r\nenforcing such unconstitutional law? Is it so very unreasonable as to\r\nfurnish a justification for controlling the words of the Constitution?\r\nWe think not. . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTIES OF A JUDGE.\r\n\r\nAdvert, sir, to the duties of a judge. He has to pass between the\r\ngovernment and the man whom that government is prosecuting; between\r\nthe most powerful individual in the community and the poorest and most\r\nunpopular. It is of the last importance that, in the exercise of these\r\nduties he should observe the utmost fairness. Need I press the\r\nnecessity of this? Does not every man feel that his own personal\r\nsecurity and the security of his property depends on that fairness?\r\nThe judicial department comes home, in its effects, to every man's\r\nfireside; it passes on his property, his reputation, his life, his\r\nall. Is it not to the last degree important that he should be rendered\r\nperfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or\r\ncontrol him, but God and his conscience? . . . I have always thought,\r\nfrom my earliest youth until now, that the greatest scourge an angry\r\nHeaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and sinning people was an\r\nignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent judiciary. Our ancestors thought\r\nso; we thought so until very lately; and I trust that the vote of this\r\nday will show that we think so still.

E. Lee, was born at Leesylvania, Westmoreland County,\r\nVirginia. His father was also named Henry Lee, and his mother was Lucy\r\nGrymes, the famous \"lowland beauty,\" who first captured Washington's\r\nheart. Her son was a favorite of his, and it is an interesting fact\r\nthat it was this same Henry Lee who delivered by request of Congress\r\nthe funeral oration on Washington. In it he used those now well-known\r\nwords, \"First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen.\"\r\n\r\nHe was educated at Princeton, and joined the American army in 1777,\r\nwith his company, as Captain Lee. He rose successively to be major,\r\ncolonel, general; and after the war he served in the Continental\r\nCongress and in the Virginia Legislature. He was injured in a riot at\r\nBaltimore, while trying to defend a friend, and went to Cuba for his\r\nhealth; but he died on his way home, at Cumberland Island on the coast\r\nof Georgia, at the home of General Greene's daughter, Mrs. Shaw.\r\n\r\nWith his first wife, his cousin Matilda Lee, he obtained Stratford\r\nHouse, where R. E. Lee was born; whose mother however, was the second\r\nwife, Anne Hill Carter of Shirley.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK.\r\n\r\n    Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department of the United States,\r\n        edited by his sons, Henry and R. E. Lee.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee's \"Memoirs of the War\" is a life-like and spirited\r\nnarrative of events in which he was an actor. The style is plain and\r\nclear. His style as an orator is seen in his celebrated Funeral\r\nOration, of which we give the closing sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTURE OF FORT MOTTE BY LEE AND MARION, MAY, 1780.\r\n\r\n(_From General Henry Lee's Memoirs of the War._)\r\n\r\nThis post was the principal depot of the convoys from Charleston to\r\nCamden, and sometimes for those destined for Fort Granby and\r\nNinety-Six. A large new mansion house, belonging to Mrs. Motte,\r\nsituated on a high and commanding hill, had been selected for this\r\nestablishment. It was surrounded with a deep trench, along the\r\ninterior margin of which was raised a strong and lofty parapet. To\r\nthis post had been regularly assigned an adequate garrison of about\r\none hundred and fifty men, which was now accidentally increased by a\r\nsmall detachment of dragoons, which had arrived from Charleston a few\r\nhours before the appearance of the American troops, on its way to\r\nCamden with despatches for Lord Rawdon. Captain M'Pherson commanded,\r\nan officer highly and deservedly respected.\r\n\r\nOpposite to Fort Motte, to the north, stood another hill, where Mrs.\r\nMotte, having been dismissed from her mansion, resided, in the old\r\nfarmhouse. On this height Lieutenant-Colonel Lee with his corps took\r\npost, while Brigadier Marion occupied the eastern declivity of the\r\nridge on which the fort stood.\r\n\r\nThe vale which runs between the two hills admitted our safe approach\r\nwithin four hundred yards of the fort. This place was selected by Lee\r\nto break ground. Relays of working parties being provided for every\r\nfour hours, and some of the negroes from the neighbouring plantations\r\nbeing brought, by the influence of Marion, to our assistance, the\r\nworks advanced with rapidity. Such was their forwardness on the 10th,\r\nthat it was determined to summon the commandant.\r\n\r\nA flag was accordingly despatched to Captain M'Pherson, stating to him\r\nwith truth our relative situation, and admonishing him to avoid the\r\ndisagreeable consequences of an arrogant temerity. To this the captain\r\nreplied, that, disregarding consequences, he should continue to resist\r\nto the last moment. The retreat of Rawdon was known in the evening to\r\nthe besiegers; and in the course of the night a courier arrived from\r\nGeneral Greene confirming that event, urging redoubled activity, and\r\ncommunicating his determination to hasten to their support. Urged by\r\nthese strong considerations, Marion and Lee persevered throughout the\r\nnight in pressing the completion of their works. On the next day,\r\nRawdon reached the country opposite to Fort Motte; and in the\r\nsucceeding night encamping on the highest ground in his route, the\r\nillumination of his fires gave the joyful annunciation of his approach\r\nto the despairing garrison. But the hour was close at hand, when this\r\njoy was to be converted into sadness.\r\n\r\nThe large mansion in the centre of the encircling trench, left but a\r\nfew yards of the ground within the enemy's works uncovered; burning\r\nthe house must force their surrender.\r\n\r\nPersuaded that our ditch would be within arrow shot before noon of the\r\nnext day, Marion and Lee determined to adopt this speedy mode of\r\neffecting their object. Orders were instantly issued to prepare bows\r\nand arrows, with missive combustible matter. This measure was\r\nreluctantly adopted; for the destruction of private property was\r\nrepugnant to the principles which swayed the two commandants, and upon\r\nthis occasion was peculiarly distressing. The devoted house was a\r\nlarge, pleasant edifice, intended for the summer residence of the\r\nrespectable owner, whose deceased husband had been a firm patriot, and\r\nwhose only marriageable daughter was the wife of Major Pinckney, an\r\nofficer in the South Carolina line, who had fought and bled in his\r\ncountry's cause, and was now a prisoner with the enemy. These\r\nconsiderations powerfully forbade the execution of the proposed\r\nmeasure; but there were others of much cogency, which applied\r\npersonally to Lieutenant Colonel Lee, and gave a new edge to the\r\nbitterness of the scene.\r\n\r\nEncamping contiguous to Mrs. Motte's dwelling, this officer had, upon\r\nhis arrival, been requested in the most pressing terms to make her\r\nhouse his quarters. The invitation was accordingly accepted; and not\r\nonly the lieutenant colonel, but every officer of his corps, off duty,\r\ndaily experienced her liberal hospitality, politely proffered and as\r\npolitely administered. Nor was the attention of this amiable lady\r\nconfined to that class of war which never fail to attract attention.\r\nWhile her richly spread table presented with taste and fashion all the\r\nluxuries of her opulent country, and her sideboard offered without\r\nreserve the best wines of Europe--antiquated relics of happier\r\ndays--her active benevolence found its way to the sick and to the\r\nwounded; cherishing with softest kindness infirmity and misfortune,\r\nconverting despair into hope, and nursing debility into strength.\r\nNevertheless the obligations of duty were imperative; the house must\r\nburn; and a respectful communication to the lady of her destined loss\r\nmust be made. Taking the first opportunity which offered, the next\r\nmorning, Lieutenant Colonel Lee imparted to Mrs. Motte the intended\r\nmeasure; lamenting the sad necessity, and assuring her of the deep\r\nregret which the unavoidable act excited in his and every breast.\r\n\r\nWith a smile of complacency this exemplary lady listened to the\r\nembarrassed officer, and gave instant relief to his agitated feelings,\r\nby declaring, that she was gratified with the opportunity of\r\ncontributing to the good of her country, and that she should view the\r\napproaching scene with delight. Shortly after, seeing accidentally the\r\nbows and arrows which had been prepared, she sent for the lieutenant\r\ncolonel, and presenting him with a bow and its apparatus imported from\r\nIndia, she requested his substitution of these, as probably better\r\nadapted for the object than those we had provided.\r\n\r\nReceiving with silent delight this opportune present, the lieutenant\r\ncolonel rejoined his troops, now making ready for the concluding\r\nscene. The lines were manned, and an additional force stationed at the\r\nbattery, lest the enemy, perceiving his fate, might determine to risk\r\na desperate assault, as offering the only chance of relief. As soon as\r\nthe troops reached their several points, a flag was again sent to\r\nM'Pherson, for the purpose of inducing him to prevent the\r\nconflagration and the slaughter which might ensue, by a second\r\nrepresentation of his actual condition.\r\n\r\nDoctor Irvine, of the legion cavalry, was charged with the flag, and\r\ninstructed to communicate faithfully the inevitable destruction\r\nimpending, and the impracticability of relief, as Lord Rawdon had not\r\nyet passed the Santee; with an assurance that longer perseverance in\r\nvain resistance, would place the garrison at the mercy of the\r\nconqueror; who was not regardless of the policy of preventing waste\r\nof time by inflicting exemplary punishment, where resistance was\r\nmaintained only to produce such waste. The British captain received\r\nthe flag with his usual politeness, and heard patiently Irvine's\r\nexplanations; but he remained immovable; repeating his determination\r\nof holding out to the last.\r\n\r\nIt was now about noon, and the rays of the scorching sun had prepared\r\nthe shingle roof for the projected conflagration. The return of Irvine\r\nwas immediately followed by the application of the bow and arrows. The\r\nfirst arrow struck and communicated its fire; a second was shot at\r\nanother quarter of the roof, and a third at a third quarter; this last\r\nalso took effect, and, like the first, soon kindled a blaze. M'Pherson\r\nordered a party to repair to the loft of the house, and by knocking\r\noff the shingles to stop the flames. This was soon perceived, and\r\nCaptain Finley was directed to open his battery, raking the loft from\r\nend to end.\r\n\r\nThe fire of our six pounder, posted close to one of the gable ends of\r\nthe house, soon drove the soldiers down; and no other effort to stop\r\nthe flames being practicable, M'Pherson hung out the white\r\nflag. . . . . Powerfully as the present occasion called for\r\npunishment, and rightfully as it might have been inflicted, not a drop\r\nof blood was shed, nor any part of the enemy's baggage taken.\r\nM'Pherson and his officers accompanied their captors to Mrs. Motte's,\r\nand partook with them of a sumptuous dinner; soothing in the sweets of\r\nsocial intercourse the ire which the preceding conflict had\r\nengendered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n(_From the funeral oration, 1800._)\r\n\r\nFirst in war--first in peace--and first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen, he was second to none in the humble and endearing scenes\r\nof private life; pious, just, humane, temperate, and sincere; uniform,\r\ndignified, and commanding, his example was as edifying to all around\r\nhim, as were the effects of that example lasting.\r\n\r\nTo his equals he was condescending, to his inferiors kind, and to the\r\ndear objects of his affections exemplarily tender; correct throughout,\r\nvice shuddered in his presence, and virtue always felt his fostering\r\nhand; the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his\r\npublic virtues.\r\n\r\nHis last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life--although in\r\nextreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan escaped him; and with\r\nundisturbed serenity, he closed his well-spent life. Such was the man\r\nAmerica has lost--such was the man for whom our nation mourns.\r\n\r\nMethinks I see his august image, and I hear falling from his venerable\r\nlips these deep-sinking words:\r\n\r\n\"Cease, sons of America, lamenting our separation: go on, and confirm\r\nby your wisdom the fruits of our joint councils, joint efforts, and\r\ncommon dangers; reverence religion, diffuse knowledge throughout your\r\nland, patronize the arts and sciences; let Liberty and Order be\r\ninseparable companions. Control party spirit, the bane of free\r\ngovernments; observe good faith to, and cultivate peace with all\r\nnations, shut up every avenue to foreign influence, contract rather\r\nthan extend national connection, rely on yourselves only; be Americans\r\nin thought, word and deed;--thus will you give immortality to that\r\nunion which was the constant object of my terrestrial labors; thus\r\nwill you preserve undisturbed to the latest posterity the felicity of\r\na people to me most dear, and thus will you supply (if my happiness is\r\nnow aught to you) the only vacancy in the round of pure bliss high\r\nHeaven bestows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASON LOCKE WEEMS.\r\n\r\n~1760=1825.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMASON LOCKE WEEMS was born at Dumfries, Virginia, and educated in\r\nLondon as a clergyman. He was for some years rector of Pohick Church,\r\nMt. Vernon parish, of which Washington was an attendant. His health\r\ndemanding a change of occupation, he became agent for the publishing\r\nhouse of Matthew Carey of Philadelphia, and was very successful, being\r\n\"equally ready for a stump, a fair, or a pulpit.\" He played the\r\nviolin, read, recited, and was humorous and interesting in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nHis writings are attractive and often very eloquent and forcible; but\r\nwe know not how much of his narratives to believe.

One day, in the garden, where he often amused\r\nhimself hacking his mother's pea-sticks, he unluckily tried the edge\r\nof his hatchet on the body of a beautiful young English cherry-tree,\r\nwhich he barked so terribly that I don't believe the tree ever got the\r\nbetter of it. The next morning the old gentleman finding out what had\r\nbefallen his tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite, came into\r\nthe house, and with much warmth asked for the mischievous author,\r\ndeclaring at the same time that he would not have taken five guineas\r\nfor his tree. Nobody could tell him anything about it. Presently\r\nGeorge and his hatchet made their appearance. 'George,' said his\r\nfather, 'do you know who killed that beautiful little cherry-tree\r\nyonder in the garden?' This was a _tough question_, and George\r\nstaggered under it for a moment; but quickly recovered himself; and\r\nlooking at his father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with\r\nthe inexpressible charm of all-conquering truth, he bravely cried out,\r\n'I can't tell a lie, Pa; you know I can't tell a lie; I did cut it\r\nwith my hatchet.'--'Run to my arms, you dearest boy,' cried his father\r\nin transports, 'run to my arms. Glad am I, George, that you ever\r\nkilled my tree, for you have paid me for it a thousand-fold. Such an\r\nact of heroism in my son, is more worth than a thousand trees, though\r\nblossomed with silver, and their fruits of purest gold.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DRAYTON.\r\n\r\n~1766=1822.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DRAYTON, son of William Henry Drayton, was born in South\r\nCarolina, educated at Princeton and in England, and became a lawyer.\r\nHe was governor of South Carolina, 1800-2, and again 1808-10; and he\r\nwas District Judge of the United States at the time of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Letters written during a tour through the Northern and Eastern\r\n        States.\r\n    A View of South Carolina.\r\n    Memoirs of the Revolution in South Carolina, [prepared mainly\r\n        from his father's manuscripts].\r\n\r\nGovernor Drayton's writings are characterized by a desire to express\r\nthe simple and exact truth.

And nothing was deemed more likely to effect the same\r\nthan some public exhibition which might speak to the sight and senses\r\nof the multitude.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose effigies were brought forward, supposed to be by the\r\nauthority or connivance of the Secret Committee. . . . They\r\nrepresented the Pope, Lord Grenville, Lord North, and the Devil. They\r\nwere placed on the top of a frame capable of containing one or two\r\npersons within it; and the frame was covered over with thick canvas,\r\nso that those within could not be distinguished. In the front of the\r\nframe on the top, the Pope was seated in a chair of state, in his\r\npontifical dress; and at a distance immediately behind him the Devil\r\nwas placed in a standing position, holding a barbed dart in his right\r\nhand; between the Pope and the Devil, on each side, Lords Grenville\r\nand North were stationed. Thus finished the frame and effigies were\r\nfixed on four wheels; and early in the morning, this uncommon\r\nspectacle was stationed between the Market and St. Michael's Church in\r\nBroad-street to the gaze of the citizens.\r\n\r\nMany were the surmises respecting it; but at length by its evolutions,\r\nit soon began to explain the purposes for which it was constructed.\r\nFor no sooner did any of the Crown officers, Placemen, Counsellors, or\r\npersons known to be disaffected to the common cause, pass by than the\r\nPope immediately bowed with proportioned respect to them, and the\r\nDevil at the same moment striking his dart at the head of the Pope\r\nconvulsed the populace with bursts of laughter. While on the other\r\nhand, the immovable effigies of Lords Grenville and North, appearing\r\nlike attendants on the Pope or criminals, moved the people with\r\nsentiments of disgust and contempt against them and the whole British\r\nAdministration, for the many oppressive acts which they had been\r\ninstrumental in procuring to be passed through both Houses of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the machine was exposed; after which it was paraded\r\nthrough the town the whole day by the mob; and in the evening, they\r\ncarried it beyond the town where surrounding it with tar barrels the\r\nwhole was committed to the flames. Nor did the idea or influence of\r\nthe thing end here--for boys forsook their customary sports to make\r\nmodels like it, with which having amused themselves, and having roused\r\ntheir youthful spirits into a detestation of oppression, they also\r\ncommitted them to the flames. And many of those very boys supported\r\nwith their services and blood the rights and liberties of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF NOEWEE, BETWEEN THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS AND THE CHEROKEES,\r\n1776.\r\n\r\n(_From Memoirs of the Revolution in South Carolina._)\r\n\r\nThe army now crossed Cannucca Creek, and was proceeding towards Noewee\r\nCreek when tracks of the enemy's spies were discovered about half\r\npast ten o'clock, A. M., and the army was halted and thrown into close\r\norder. It then proceeded on its left towards a narrow valley,\r\nbordering on Noewee Creek, and enclosed on each side by lofty\r\nmountains, terminated at the extremity by others equally difficult;\r\nand commenced entering the same, for the purpose of crossing the\r\nAppalachean Ridge, which separated the Middle Settlements from those\r\nin the Vallies.\r\n\r\nThese heights were occupied by twelve hundred Indian Warriors; nor\r\nwere they discovered, until the advance guard of one hundred men began\r\nto mount the height, which terminated the valley. The army having thus\r\ncompletely fallen into the ambuscade of the enemy, they poured in a\r\nheavy fire upon its front and flanks; compelling it to recoil, and\r\nfall into confusion. Great was the perturbation which then prevailed,\r\nthe cry being, \"_We shall be cut off_;\" and while Col. Williamson's\r\nattention was imperiously called to rally his men, and charge the\r\nenemy, he was at the same time obliged to reinforce the baggage guard,\r\non which the subsistence of the army depended for provisions, in this\r\nmountainous wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn this extremity, Lieutenant-Colonel Hammond caused detachments to\r\nfile off, for the purpose of gaining the eminences above the Indians,\r\nand turning their flanks; while Lieutenant Hampton with twenty men,\r\nadvanced upon the enemy, passing the main advance guard of one hundred\r\nmen: who, being panic-struck, were rapidly retreating. Hampton,\r\nhowever, clambered up the ascent, with a manly presence of mind; which\r\nmuch encouraged all his followers: calling out, \"_Loaded guns\r\nadvance--empty guns, fall down and load:_\" and being joined by thirty\r\nmen, he charged desperately on the foe. The Indians now gave way; and\r\na panic passing among them from right to left, the troops rallied and\r\npressed them with such energy, as induced a general flight: and the\r\narmy was thereby rescued from a total defeat and massacre.\r\n\r\nBesides this good fortune, they became possessed of so many packs of\r\ndeer skins and baggage; that they sold among the individuals of the\r\narmy, for £1,200 currency; and which sum was equally distributed among\r\nthe troops. In this engagement, the killed of Williamson's army, were\r\nthirteen men, and one Catawba Indian; and the wounded were, thirty-two\r\nmen, and two Catawbas. Of the enemy, only four were found dead, and\r\ntheir loss would have been more considerable, if many of them had not\r\nbeen mistaken for the friendly Catawbas, who were in front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WIRT.\r\n\r\n~1772=1834.~\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WIRT was born at Bladensburg, Maryland, and received an early\r\nand excellent education. He removed to Virginia in 1791 and began the\r\npractice of law, in which profession he rose to great and singular\r\neminence.\r\n\r\nHe was elected Chancellor of Virginia in 1801, led the prosecution in\r\nthe Aaron Burr trial, 1807, and was concerned in several other famous\r\ncases. In 1817 he was appointed Attorney-General of the United States\r\nand lived in Washington twelve years. In 1826 he delivered before\r\nCongress the address on the death of John Adams and of Thomas\r\nJefferson; which occurred on the Fourth of July, of that year, just\r\nfifty years after the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nHis health giving way under his severe labors and distress for the\r\ndeath of his son Robert, he resigned his office. He said, \"All, all\r\nis vanity and vexation of spirit, except religion, friendship, and\r\nliterature.\" He removed to Baltimore and resumed the practice of law.\r\nHe was a man of fine appearance and charming social graces. It is\r\nrelated that on one occasion he kept a party of friends up all night\r\nlong, to their utter astonishment, merely by the powers of his\r\ndelightful conversation.

On entering, I\r\nwas struck with his preternatural appearance. He was a tall and very\r\nspare old man; his head which was covered with a white linen cap, his\r\nshrivelled hands, and his voice, were all shaking under the influence\r\nof a palsy; and a few moments ascertained to me that he was perfectly\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nThe first emotions that touched my breast were those of mingled pity\r\nand veneration. But how soon were all my feelings changed! The lips of\r\nPlato were never more worthy of a prognostic swarm of bees, than were\r\nthe lips of this holy man! It was a day of the administration of the\r\nsacrament; and his subject was, of course, the passion of our Saviour.\r\nI have heard the subject handled a thousand times; I had thought it\r\nexhausted long ago. Little did I suppose that in the wild woods of\r\nAmerica, I was to meet with a man whose eloquence would give to this\r\ntopic a new and more sublime pathos than I had ever before witnessed.\r\n\r\nAs he descended from the pulpit to distribute the mystic symbols,\r\nthere was a peculiar, a more than human solemnity in his air and\r\nmanner, which made my blood run cold, and my whole frame shiver.\r\n\r\nHe then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Saviour; his trial\r\nbefore Pilate; his ascent up Calvary; his crucifixion; and his death.\r\nI knew the whole history; but never until then had I heard the\r\ncircumstances so selected, so arranged, so colored! It was all new;\r\nand I seemed to have heard it for the first time in my life. His\r\nenunciation was so deliberate that his voice trembled on every\r\nsyllable; and every heart in the assembly trembled in unison. His\r\npeculiar phrases had the force of description, that the original\r\nscene appeared to be at that moment acting before our eyes. We saw the\r\nvery faces of the Jews; the staring, frightful distortions of malice\r\nand rage. We saw the buffet; my soul kindled with a flame of\r\nindignation; and my hands were involuntarily and convulsively\r\nclinched.\r\n\r\nBut when he came to touch on the patience, the forgiving meekness of\r\nour Saviour; when he drew, to the life, his blessed eyes streaming in\r\ntears to heaven; his voice breathing to God a soft and gentle prayer\r\nof pardon on his enemies, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not\r\nwhat they do,\"--the voice of the preacher, which had all along\r\nfaltered, grew fainter and fainter, until, his utterance being\r\nentirely obstructed by the force of his feelings, he raised his\r\nhandkerchief to his eyes, and burst into a loud and irrepressible\r\nflood of grief. The effect is inconceivable. The whole house resounded\r\nwith the mingled groans, and sobs, and shrieks of the congregation.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the tumult had subsided, so far as to permit\r\nhim to proceed. Indeed, judging by the usual, but fallacious standard\r\nof my own weakness, I began to be very uneasy for the situation of the\r\npreacher. For I could not conceive how he would be able to let his\r\naudience down from the height to which he had wound them, without\r\nimpairing the solemnity and dignity of his subject, or perhaps\r\nshocking them by the abruptness of the fall. But--no: the descent was\r\nas beautiful and sublime as the elevation had been rapid and\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence, with which he broke the awful silence, was a\r\nquotation from Rousseau: \"Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus\r\nChrist, like a God!\"\r\n\r\nI despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced by this short\r\nsentence, unless you could perfectly conceive the whole manner of the\r\nman, as well as the peculiar crisis in the discourse. Never before\r\ndid I completely understand what Demosthenes meant by laying such\r\nstress on delivery. You are to bring before you the venerable figure\r\nof the preacher; his blindness, constantly recalling to your\r\nrecollection old Homer, Ossian, and Milton, and associating with his\r\nperformance the melancholy grandeur of their geniuses; you are to\r\nimagine that you hear his slow, solemn, well-accented enunciation, and\r\nhis voice of affecting trembling melody; you are to remember the pitch\r\nof passion and enthusiasm to which the congregation were raised; and\r\nthen the few moments of portentous, deathlike silence which reigned\r\nthroughout the house; the preacher removing his white handkerchief\r\nfrom his aged face, (even yet wet from the recent torrent of his\r\ntears), and slowly stretching forth the palsied hand which holds it,\r\nbegins the sentence, \"Socrates died like a philosopher,\"--then,\r\npausing, raising his other hand, pressing them both, clasped together,\r\nwith warmth and energy, to his breast, lifting his \"sightless balls\"\r\nto heaven, and pouring his whole soul into his tremulous voice--\"but\r\nJesus Christ--like a God!\" If it had indeed and in truth been an angel\r\nof light, the effect could scarcely have been more divine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY AGAINST JOHN HOOK.\r\n\r\n(_From Life of Patrick Henry._)\r\n\r\nHook was a Scotchman, a man of wealth, and suspected of being\r\nunfriendly to the American cause. During the distresses of the\r\nAmerican army, consequent upon the joint invasion of Cornwallis and\r\nPhillips in 1781, a Mr. Venable, an army commissary, had taken two of\r\nHook's steers for the use of the troops. The act had not been strictly\r\nlegal; and on the establishment of peace, Hook, under the advice of\r\nMr. Cowan, a gentleman of some distinction in the law, thought proper\r\nto bring an action of trespass against Mr. Venable, in the district\r\ncourt of New London. Mr. Henry appeared for the defendant, and is said\r\nto have disported himself in this cause to the infinite enjoyment of\r\nhis hearers, the unfortunate Hook always excepted. After Mr. Henry\r\nbecame animated in the cause, says a correspondent [Judge Stuart], he\r\nappeared to have complete control over the passions of his audience:\r\nat one time he excited their indignation against Hook: vengeance was\r\nvisible in every countenance; again, when he chose to relax and\r\nridicule him, the whole audience was in a roar of laughter. He painted\r\nthe distresses of the American army, exposed almost naked to the\r\nrigour of a winter's sky, and marking the frozen ground over which\r\nthey marched, with the blood of their unshod feet--\"where was the\r\nman,\" he said, \"who had an American heart in his bosom, who would not\r\nhave thrown open his fields, his barns, his cellar, the doors of his\r\nhouse, the portals of his breast, to have received with open arms, the\r\nmeanest soldier in that little band of patriots? Where is the man?\r\n_There_ he stands--but whether the heart of an American beats in his\r\nbosom, you, gentlemen, are to judge.\" He then carried the jury, by the\r\npowers of his imagination, to the plains around York, the surrender of\r\nwhich had followed shortly after the act complained of: he depicted\r\nthe surrender in the most glowing and noble colors of his\r\neloquence--the audience saw before their eyes the humiliation and\r\ndejection of the British, as they marched out of their trenches--they\r\nsaw the triumph which lighted up every patriot face, and heard the\r\nshouts of victory, and the cry of \"Washington and Liberty!\", as it\r\nrung and echoed through the American ranks, and was reverberated from\r\nthe hills and shores of the neighboring river--\"but, hark!, what notes\r\nof discord are these which disturb the general joy, and silence the\r\nacclamations of victory? They are the notes of _John Hook_, hoarsely\r\nbawling through the American camp, _beef!_ _beef!_ _beef!_\"\r\n\r\nThe whole audience was convulsed: a particular incident will give a\r\nbetter idea of the effect, than any general description. The clerk of\r\nthe court, unable to command himself, and unwilling to commit any\r\nbreach of decorum in his place, rushed out of the court-house, and\r\nthrew himself on the grass, in the most violent paroxysm of laughter,\r\nwhere he was rolling, when Hook, with very different feelings, came\r\nout for relief into the yard also. \"Jemmy Steptoe,\" said he to the\r\nclerk, \"what the devil ails ye, mon?\" Mr. Steptoe was only able to\r\nsay, that _he could not help it_. \"Never mind ye,\" said Hook, \"wait\r\ntill Billy Cowan gets up: _he'll show_ him the la'.\" Mr. Cowan,\r\nhowever, was so completely overwhelmed by the torrent which bore upon\r\nhis client, that when he rose to reply to Mr. Henry, he was scarcely\r\nable to make an intelligible or audible remark. The cause was decided\r\nalmost by acclamation. The jury retired for form's sake, and instantly\r\nreturned with a verdict for the defendant. Nor did the effect of Mr.\r\nHenry's speech stop here. The people were so highly excited by the\r\ntory audacity of such a suit, that Hook began to hear around him a cry\r\nmore terrible than that of _beef_; it was the cry of _tar and\r\nfeathers_: from the application of which, it is said, that nothing\r\nsaved him but a precipitate flight and the speed of his horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[6] James Waddell, it is said, was a relative of the celebrated\r\nteacher, Dr. Moses Waddell, of Georgia, president of the State\r\nUniversity, 1819-29.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n~1773=1833.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RANDOLPH of Roanoke, was born at Cawson's, Virginia, being a\r\ndescendant of Pocahontas in the seventh generation. He lost his\r\nfather early in life. His beautiful mother, to whom he was devotedly\r\nattached, afterwards married St. George Tucker, who happily was a true\r\nfather to her children and educated John himself. Her death in 1788\r\nwas a life-long distress to her gifted son.\r\n\r\nHe was a prominent actor in all the stirring political life of the\r\ntimes, being in Congress from 1800 until his death, except from 1812\r\nto 1814, and again in 1830 when he was minister to Russia, a position\r\nwhich he resigned, however, in order to return to the excitement of\r\npolitics at home. He freed his slaves by will on his death, which\r\noccurred in Philadelphia as he was preparing to go abroad for his\r\nhealth. Many anecdotes are told of him, and he is one of the most\r\ninteresting and striking figures in our history.

And gentlemen, as if they were afraid that this\r\nbesetting sin of republican governments, this _rerum novarum lubido_\r\n(to use a very homely phrase, but that comes pat to the purpose), this\r\nmaggot of innovation, would cease to bite, are here gravely making\r\nprovision that this Constitution, which we should consider as a remedy\r\nfor all the ills of the body politic, may itself be amended or\r\nmodified at any future time. Sir, I am against any such provision. I\r\nshould as soon think of introducing into a marriage contract a\r\nprovision for divorce, and thus poisoning the greatest blessing of\r\nmankind at its very source,--at its fountain-head. He has seen little,\r\nand has reflected less, who does not know that \"necessity\" is the\r\ngreat, powerful, governing principle of affairs here. Sir, I am not\r\ngoing into that question which puzzled Pandemonium,--the question of\r\nliberty and necessity,--\r\n\r\n    \"Free will, fixed fate, foreknowledge absolute;\"\r\n\r\nbut I do contend that necessity is one principal instrument of all the\r\ngood that man enjoys. The happiness of the connubial union itself\r\ndepends greatly on necessity, and when you touch this you touch the\r\narch, the keystone of the arch, on which the happiness and well-being\r\nof society is founded. Look at the relation of master and slave (that\r\nopprobrium, in the opinion of some gentlemen, to all civilized society\r\nand all free government). Sir, there are few situations in life where\r\nfriendships so strong and so lasting are formed as in that very\r\nrelation. The slave knows that he is bound indissolubly to his master,\r\nand must, from necessity, remain always under his control. The master\r\nknows he is bound to maintain and provide always for his slave so long\r\nas he retains him in his possession. And each party accommodates\r\nhimself to the situation. I have seen the dissolution of many\r\nfriendships,--such, at least, as they were called; but I have seen\r\nthat of master and slave endure so long as there remained a drop of\r\nblood of the master to which the slave could cleave.\r\n\r\nWhere is the necessity of this provision in the Constitution? Where\r\nis the use of it? Sir, what are we about? Have we not been undoing\r\nwhat the wiser heads--I must be permitted to say so--yes, Sir, what\r\nthe wiser heads of our ancestors did more than half a century ago?\r\nCan any one believe that we, by any amendment of ours, by any of\r\nour scribbling on that parchment, by any amulet, by any\r\nlegerdemain--charm--Abracadabra--of ours can prevent our sons from\r\ndoing the same thing,--that is, from doing what they please, just\r\nas we are doing as we please? It is impossible. Who can bind\r\nposterity? When I hear gentlemen talk of making a Constitution for\r\n\"all time,\" and introducing provisions into it for \"all time,\" and\r\nyet see men here who are older than the Constitution we are about\r\nto destroy (I am older myself than the present Constitution: it was\r\nestablished when I was a boy), it reminds me of the truces and the\r\npeaces of Europe. They always begin, \"In the name of the most holy\r\nand undivided Trinity,\" and go on to declare \"there shall be\r\nperfect and perpetual peace and unity between the subjects of such\r\nand such potentates for all time to come;\" and in less than seven\r\nyears they are at war again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE TUCKER.\r\n\r\n~1775=1861.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE TUCKER, a relative of St. George Tucker, was, like him, born in\r\nthe Bermudas, and came to Virginia in 1787. He was reared and educated\r\nby St. George Tucker, and practiced law in Lynchburg. He served in the\r\nState Legislature and in Congress, and in 1825 he was elected\r\nprofessor of Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in the University\r\nof Virginia, a position which he filled for twenty years.

But the sentiment here expressed by Mr. Jefferson is\r\ntruly felt by many an American, and we have no reason to doubt it was\r\nfelt also by him. There is a charm in the life which one has been\r\naccustomed to in his youth, no matter what the modes of that life may\r\nhave been, which always retains its hold on the heart. The Indian who\r\nhas passed his first years with his tribe, is never reconciled to the\r\nhabits and restraints of civilized life. And although in more\r\nartificial and advanced stages of society, individuals, whether they\r\nhave been brought up in the town or the country, are not equally\r\nirreconcilable to a change from one to the other, it commonly takes\r\nsome time to overcome their preference for the life they have been\r\naccustomed to; and in many instances it is never overcome, but\r\ncontinues to haunt the imagination with pleasing pictures of the past\r\nor imaginations of the future, when hope gives assurance that those\r\nscenes of former enjoyment may be renewed. That most of our country\r\ngentlemen, past the heyday of youth, would soon tire of Paris, and\r\npant after the simple pleasures and exemption from restraint which\r\ntheir own country affords, is little to be wondered at; but it is the\r\nmore remarkable in Mr. Jefferson, and more clearly illustrates the\r\nforce of early habit, when it is recollected that he found in the\r\nFrench metropolis that society of men of letters and science which he\r\nmust often have in vain coveted in his own country, and that here he\r\nmet with those specimens of music, painting, and architecture, for\r\nwhich he had so lively a relish. But in these comparisons between the\r\nlife we are leading and that which we have left, or are looking\r\nforward to, we must always allow much to the force of the imagination,\r\nand there are few men who felt its influence more than Mr. Jefferson.\r\nIn one of his letters to Mr. Carmichael, he says, \"I sometimes think\r\nof building a little hermitage at the Natural Bridge, (for it is my\r\nproperty), and of passing there a part of the year at least.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n(_From the Same._)\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the subject of education had long been a favourite\r\nobject with Mr. Jefferson, partly from his own lively relish for\r\nliterature and science, and partly because he deemed the diffusion of\r\nknowledge among the people essential to the wise administration of a\r\npopular government, and even to its stability. He had not long retired\r\nfrom public life, before the subject again engaged his serious\r\nattention, and, besides endeavouring to enlist men of influence in\r\nbehalf of his favourite scheme of dividing the counties of the State\r\ninto wards, and giving the charge of its elementary schools to these\r\nlittle commonwealths, he also aimed to establish a college, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Charlottesville, for teaching the higher branches of\r\nknowledge, and which, from its central and healthy situation, might be\r\nimproved into a university.\r\n\r\nHe lived to see this object accomplished, and it owed its success\r\nprincipally to his efforts. It engrossed his attention for more than\r\neleven years, in which time he exhibited his wonted judgment and\r\naddress, in overcoming the numerous obstacles he encountered, and a\r\ndiligence and perseverance which would have been creditable to the\r\nmost vigorous period of life. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nIn getting the university into operation, he seemed to have regained\r\nthe activity and assiduity of his youth. Everything was looked into,\r\neverything was ordered by him. He suggested the remedy for every\r\ndifficulty, and made the selection in every choice of expedients. Two\r\nor three times a week he rode down to the establishment to give orders\r\nto the proctor, and to watch the progress of the work still\r\nunfinished. Nor were his old habits of hospitality forgotten. His\r\ninvitations to the professors and their families were frequent, and\r\nevery Sunday some four or five of the students dined with him. At\r\nthese times he generally ate by himself in a small recess connected\r\nwith the dining-room; but, saving at meals, sat and conversed with\r\nthe company as usual. The number of visiters also to the University\r\nwas very great, and they seldom failed to call at Monticello, where\r\nthey often passed the day, and sometimes several days. He was so fully\r\noccupied with his duties, as rector of the university, and he found so\r\nmuch pleasure in the occupation, that for a time every cause of care\r\nand anxiety, of which he now began to have an increased share, was\r\nentirely forgotten; and the sun of his life seemed to be setting with\r\na soft but unclouded radiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Henry Clay.~]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD ... 1800-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY.\r\n\r\n~1777=1852.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY was born at \"The Slashes,\" Hanover County, Virginia, whence\r\nhe got his title, \"Mill-Boy of the Slashes.\" His mother, early left a\r\nwidow, was poor, and on her second marriage, to Mr. Henry Watkins,\r\nremoved to Kentucky. Henry Clay became a clerk and then a law-student\r\nin Richmond, Va., and in 1797 followed his mother to Kentucky, making\r\nhis home in Lexington. He rose speedily to eminence as a jury lawyer,\r\nand in 1803 entered public life as a member of the State Legislature.\r\nIn 1806 he entered the United States Senate, and after the war of 1812\r\nhe was sent to Belgium as one of the Commissioners to treat of peace\r\nwith Great Britain.\r\n\r\nHis share in public life was most important.

He was a master of the feelings and\r\ncould sway the multitude before him as one man. \"His style of argument\r\nwas by vivid picture, apt comparison, and forcible illustration,\r\nrather than by close reasoning like Webster's, or impregnable logic\r\nlike that of Calhoun.\"--John P. McGuire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BE RIGHT ABOVE ALL.\r\n\r\nSir, I would rather be right than be president. (_In 1850, on being\r\ntold that his views would endanger his nomination for the\r\npresidency._)\r\n\r\n\r\nNO GEOGRAPHICAL LINES IN PATRIOTISM.\r\n\r\nI know no North, no South, no East, no West.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY INSUBORDINATION.\r\n\r\n(_From the speech on the Seminole War, delivered 1819._)\r\n\r\nI will not trespass much longer upon the time of the committee; but I\r\ntrust I shall be indulged with some few reflections upon the danger\r\nof permitting conduct, [Gen. Jackson's arbitrary court-martial], on\r\nwhich it has been my painful duty to animadvert, to pass without a\r\nsolemn expression of the disapprobation of this House. Recall to your\r\nmind the free nations which have gone before us. Where are they now?\r\n\r\n    \"Gone glimmering through the dream of things that were,\r\n    A school-boy's tale, the wonder of an hour.\"\r\n\r\nAnd how have they lost their liberties? If we could transport\r\nourselves back to the ages when Greece and Rome flourished in their\r\ngreatest prosperity, and, mingling in the throng, should ask a Grecian\r\nwhether he did not fear that some daring military chieftain, covered\r\nwith glory, some Philip or Alexander, would one day overthrow the\r\nliberties of his country, the confident and indignant Grecian would\r\nexclaim, No! no! we have nothing to fear from our heroes; our\r\nliberties shall be eternal. If a Roman citizen had been asked whether\r\nhe did not fear that the conqueror of Gaul might establish a throne\r\nupon the ruins of public liberty, he would have instantly repelled the\r\nunjust insinuation. Yet Greece fell; Cæsar passed the Rubicon, and the\r\npatriotic arm even of Brutus could not preserve the liberties of his\r\ndevoted country. The celebrated Madame de Staël, in her last and\r\nperhaps her best work, has said that in the very year, almost the very\r\nmonth, when the president of the Directory declared that monarchy\r\nwould never show its frightful head in France, Bonaparte with his\r\ngrenadiers entered the palace of St. Cloud, and, dispersing with the\r\nbayonet the deputies of the people, deliberating on the affairs of the\r\nstate, laid the foundation of that vast fabric of despotism which\r\novershadowed all Europe.\r\n\r\nI hope not to be misunderstood; I am far from intimating that General\r\nJackson cherishes any designs inimical to the liberties of the\r\ncountry. I believe his intentions to be pure and patriotic. I thank\r\nGod that he would not, but I thank Him still more that he could not if\r\nhe would, overturn the liberties of the Republic. But precedents, if\r\nbad, are fraught with the most dangerous consequences. Man has been\r\ndescribed, by some of those who have treated of his nature, as a\r\nbundle of habits. The definition is much truer when applied to\r\ngovernments. Precedents are their habits. There is one important\r\ndifference between the formation of habits by an individual and by\r\ngovernment. He contracts it only after frequent repetition. A single\r\ninstance fixes the habit and determines the direction of governments.\r\n\r\nAgainst the alarming doctrine of unlimited discretion in our military\r\ncommanders, when applied to prisoners of war, I must enter my protest.\r\nIt begins upon them; it will end on us. I hope our happy form of\r\ngovernment is to be perpetual. But if it is to be preserved, it must\r\nbe by the practice of virtue, by justice, by moderation, by\r\nmagnanimity, by greatness of soul, by keeping a watchful and steady\r\neye on the executive; and, above all, by holding to a strict\r\naccountability the military branch of the public force. . . . . . .\r\nBeware how you give a fatal sanction, in this infant period of our\r\nrepublic, scarcely yet two score years old, to military\r\ninsubordination. Remember that Greece had her Alexander, Rome her\r\nCæsar, England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte, and that, if we\r\nwould escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS SCOTT KEY.\r\n\r\n~1780=1843.~\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS SCOTT KEY was born in Frederick county, Maryland, and was\r\neducated at St. John's College, Annapolis. He became a lawyer, was\r\nappointed District Attorney of the District of Columbia, and spent his\r\nlife in Washington City.\r\n\r\nA very handsome monument has been erected to his memory in San\r\nFrancisco by Mr. James Lick: his song, the \"Star-Spangled Banner,\"\r\nwill be his enduring monument throughout our country. It was composed\r\nduring the attack on Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, 1814. Key had\r\ngone to the British vessel to get a friend released from imprisonment,\r\nin which he succeeded, but he was kept on board the enemy's vessel\r\nuntil after the attack on the fort; and the song commemorates his\r\nevening and morning watch for the star-spangled banner on Fort\r\nMcHenry, and the appearance of the flag in \"the morning's first beam\"\r\nshowed that the attack had been successfully resisted. The words were\r\nwritten on an old envelope.

While still a young man, his\r\nfather put him in charge of a country estate in Pennsylvania.\r\nAfterwards he engaged in mercantile persuits in Philadelphia,\r\nLouisville, New Orleans, and Henderson, Kentucky, but unsuccessfully;\r\nfor he knew and cared much more about the birds, flowers, and beasts\r\naround him than about the kinds and prices of goods that his\r\nneighbors needed.\r\n\r\nHis great literary and artistic work is \"The Birds of America,\"\r\nconsisting of five volumes of Ornithological Biographies and four\r\nvolumes of exquisite portraits of birds, life-size, in natural colors,\r\nand surrounded by the plants which each one most likes. \"Quadrupeds of\r\nAmerica\" was prepared mainly by his sons and Rev. John Bachman of\r\nSouth Carolina. These works gave him a European reputation. He died at\r\nMinniesland, now Audubon Park, New York City.\r\n\r\nHis style in writing is pure, vivid, and so clear as to place before\r\nus the very thing or event described. The accounts of his travels and\r\nof the adventures he met with in his search for his birds and animals\r\nare very natural and picturesque; and they show also his own fine\r\nnature and attractive character.\r\n\r\nA biography arranged from his diary by Mrs. Audubon was published in\r\nNew York, 1868. See also Samuel Smiles' \"Brief Biographies.\" The State\r\nLibrary of North Carolina possesses a set of Audubon's invaluable\r\nworks, of which there are only eight sets in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOCKING-BIRD.\r\n\r\nIt is where the great magnolia shoots up its majestic trunk, crowned\r\nwith evergreen leaves, and decorated with a thousand beautiful\r\nflowers, that perfume the air around; where the forests and the fields\r\nare adorned with blossoms of every hue; where the golden orange\r\nornaments the gardens and groves; where bignonias of various kinds\r\ninterlace their climbing stems around the white-flowered Stuartia,\r\nand, mounting still higher, cover the summits of the lofty trees\r\naround, accompanied with innumerable vines, that here and there\r\nfestoon the dense foliage of the magnificent woods, lending to the\r\nvernal breeze a slight portion of the perfume of their clustered\r\nflowers; where a genial warmth seldom forsakes the atmosphere; where\r\nberries and fruits of all descriptions are met with at every step; in\r\na word, kind reader, it is where Nature seems to have paused, as she\r\npassed over the earth, and, opening her stores, to have strewed with\r\nunsparing hand the diversified seeds from which have sprung all the\r\nbeautiful and splendid forms which I should in vain attempt to\r\ndescribe, that the mocking-bird should have fixed his abode, there\r\nonly that its wondrous song should be heard.\r\n\r\nBut where is that favored land? It is in that great continent to whose\r\ndistant shores Europe has sent forth her adventurous sons, to wrest\r\nfor themselves a habitation from the wild inhabitants of the forest,\r\nand to convert the neglected soil into fields of exuberant fertility.\r\nIt is, reader, in Louisiana that these bounties of nature are in the\r\ngreatest perfection. It is there that you should listen to the\r\nlove-song of the mocking-bird, as I at this moment do. See how he\r\nflies round his mate, with motions as light as those of the butterfly!\r\nHis tail is widely expanded, he mounts in the air to a small distance,\r\ndescribes a circle, and, again alighting, approaches his beloved one,\r\nhis eyes gleaming with delight, for she has already promised to be his\r\nand his only. His beautiful wings are gently raised, he bows to his\r\nlove, and, again bouncing upwards, opens his bill and pours forth his\r\nmelody, full of exultation at the conquest which he has made.\r\n\r\nThey are not the soft sounds of the flute or of the hautboy that I\r\nhear, but the sweeter notes of Nature's own music. The mellowness of\r\nthe song, the varied modulations and gradations, the extent of its\r\ncompass, the great brilliancy of execution, are unrivalled. There is\r\nprobably no bird in the world that possesses all the musical\r\nqualifications of this king of song, who has derived all from Nature's\r\nself. Yes, reader, all!\r\n\r\nNo sooner has he again alighted, and the conjugal contract has been\r\nsealed, than, as if his breast was about to be rent with delight, he\r\nagain pours forth his notes with more softness and richness than\r\nbefore. He now soars higher, glancing around with a vigilant eye to\r\nassure himself that none has witnessed his bliss. When these\r\nlove-scenes, visible only to the ardent lover of nature, are over, he\r\ndances through the air, full of animation and delight, and as if to\r\nconvince his lovely mate that to enrich her hopes he has much more\r\nlove in store, he that moment begins anew and imitates all the notes\r\nwhich Nature has imparted to the other songsters of the grove.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMMING-BIRD.\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the returning sun again introduced the vernal season,\r\nand caused millions of plants to expand their leaves and blossoms to\r\nhis genial beams, than the little Humming-Bird is seen advancing on\r\nfairy wings, carefully visiting every opening flower-cup, and, like a\r\ncurious florist, removing from each the injurious insects that\r\notherwise would ere long cause their beauteous petals to droop and\r\ndecay. Poised in the air, it is observed peeping cautiously, and with\r\nsparkling eyes, into their innermost recesses, while the ethereal\r\nmotions of its pinions, so rapid and so light, appear to fan and cool\r\nthe flower, without injuring its fragile texture, and produce a\r\ndelightful murmuring sound, well adapted for lulling the insects to\r\nrepose. Then is the moment for the Humming-Bird to secure them. Its\r\nlong delicate bill enters the cup of the flower, and the protruded\r\ndouble-tubed tongue, delicately sensible, and imbued with a glutinous\r\nsaliva, touches each insect in succession, and draws it from its\r\nlurking place, to be instantly swallowed. All this is done in a\r\nmoment, and the bird, as it leaves the flower, sips so small a portion\r\nof its liquid honey, that the theft, we may suppose, is looked upon\r\nwith a grateful feeling by the flower, which is thus kindly relieved\r\nfrom the attacks of her destroyers. . . . . . . . Its gorgeous throat\r\nin beauty and brilliancy baffles all competition. Now it glows with a\r\nfiery hue, and again it is changed to the deepest velvety black. The\r\nupper parts of its delicate body are of resplendent changing green;\r\nand it throws itself through the air with a swiftness and vivacity\r\nhardly conceivable. It moves from one flower to another like a gleam\r\nof light, upwards, downwards, to the right, and to the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HART BENTON.\r\n\r\n~1782=1858.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HART BENTON was born in Hillsboro, North Carolina, and was\r\npartly educated at the State University. He left before graduation,\r\nhowever, and removed with his widowed mother to Tennessee, where\r\ntwenty-five miles south of Nashville they made a home, around which a\r\nsettlement called Bentontown gradually grew up.\r\n\r\nHe studied law with St. George Tucker, began to practice in Nashville,\r\nand was elected to the State Legislature in 1811. In 1815 he removed\r\nto St. Louis, and was elected United States Senator in 1820 on the\r\nadmission of Missouri to the Union. He worked heartily and\r\nsuccessfully in the interests of settlers in the West. His title \"Old\r\nBullion\" was derived from his famous speeches on the currency, during\r\nJackson's administration, and they gained him a European reputation.\r\n\r\nHe and Calhoun were opposed to each other on almost every question,\r\nand they carried on a ferocious warfare in the Senate. He was a\r\nSenator for thirty years, 1820-50, and his great work gives an account\r\nof men and measures during that very exciting and intensely\r\ninteresting period, in which he was himself one of the most prominent\r\nactors.\r\n\r\nA fine statue was erected to him in the park at St. Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Thirty Years' View of the Workings of Our Government.\r\n    Abridgment of the Debates of Congress.\r\n    Examination of the Dred Scott Case.\r\n\r\nBenton's style as an orator was easy, full, and strong, showing him\r\nwell acquainted with his subject and confident of his powers.\r\n\r\nThe \"Thirty Years' View\" is noted for its excellent arrangement and\r\nfor a style easy and fluent yet not diffuse. \"It is a succession of\r\nhistorical tableaux,\" of which the following extract presents one of\r\nthe most famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUEL BETWEEN RANDOLPH AND CLAY.\r\n\r\n(_From Thirty Years' View._[7])\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 8th of April (1826)--the day for the duel--had come, and\r\nalmost the hour. It was noon, and the meeting was to take place at 4½\r\no'clock. I had gone to see Mr. Randolph before the hour, and for a\r\npurpose; and, besides, it was so far on the way, as he lived half-way to\r\nGeorgetown, and we had to pass through that place to cross the Potomac\r\ninto Virginia at the Little Falls Bridge. I had heard nothing from him\r\non the point of not returning the fire since the first communication to\r\nthat effect, eight days before. I had no reason to doubt the steadiness\r\nof his determination, but felt a desire to have fresh assurance of it\r\nafter so many days' delay, and so near approach of the trying moment. I\r\nknew it would not do to ask him the question--any question which would\r\nimply a doubt of his word. His sensitive feelings would be hurt and\r\nannoyed at it. So I fell upon a scheme to get at the inquiry without\r\nseeming to make it. I told him of my visit to Mr. Clay the night\r\nbefore--of the late sitting--the child asleep--the unconscious\r\ntranquillity of Mrs. Clay; and added, I could not help reflecting how\r\ndifferent all that might be the next night. He understood me perfectly,\r\nand immediately said, with a quietude of look and expression which\r\nseemed to rebuke an unworthy doubt, _I shall do nothing to disturb the\r\nsleep of the child or the repose of the mother_, and went on with his\r\nemployment . . . . which was, making codicils to his will, all in the\r\nway of remembrance to friends. . . . . . . . . . . . I withdrew a little\r\nway into the woods, and kept my eyes fixed on Mr. Randolph, who I then\r\nknew to be the only one in danger. I saw him receive the fire of Mr.\r\nClay, saw the gravel knocked up in the same place, saw Mr. Randolph\r\nraise his pistol--discharge it in the air; heard him say, _I do not fire\r\nat you, Mr. Clay_; and immediately advancing and offering his hand. He\r\nwas met in the same spirit. They met halfway, shook hands, Mr. Randolph\r\nsaying, jocosely, _You owe me a coat, Mr. Clay_--(the bullet had passed\r\nthrough the skirt of the coat, very near the hip)--to which Mr. Clay\r\npromptly and happily replied, _I am glad the debt is no greater_. I had\r\ncome up and was prompt to proclaim what I had been obliged to keep\r\nsecret for eight days. The joy of all was extreme at this happy\r\ntermination of a most critical affair: and we immediately left, with\r\nlighter hearts than we brought. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nOn Monday the parties exchanged cards, and social relations were\r\nformally and courteously restored. It was about the last high-toned\r\nduel that I have witnessed, and among the highest-toned that I have\r\never witnessed; and so happily conducted to a fortunate issue--a\r\nresult due to the noble character of the seconds as well as to the\r\ngenerous and heroic spirit of the principals. Certainly, duelling is\r\nbad, and has been put down, but not quite so bad as its\r\nsubstitute--revolvers, bowie-knives, blackguarding, and\r\nstreet-assassinations under the pretext of self-defence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] By permission of D. Appleton and Company, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN.\r\n\r\n~1782=1850.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN is one of the greatest statesmen that America\r\nhas produced. He was of Scotch and Irish descent, and was born in\r\nAbbeville County, South Carolina. He received his early education from\r\nhis brother-in-law, the distinguished Dr. Moses Waddell, then attended\r\nYale College, and studied law. Early in life, 1811, he entered the\r\npolitical arena, and remained in it to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of War under President Monroe, he re-organized the\r\ndepartment on the basis which is still maintained. He was elected\r\nVice-president with Adams in 1824, re-elected with Jackson, 1828, and\r\nbecame United States Senator, 1832, succeeding Robert Y. Hayne who had\r\nbeen chosen governor of South Carolina in the Nullification crisis.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth until his death, he was in the midst of incessant\r\npolitical toil, strife, and activity, having Webster, Clay, Benton,\r\nHayne, Randolph, Grundy, Hunter, and Cass, for his great companions.\r\nEdward Everett said: \"Calhoun, Clay, Webster! I name them in\r\nalphabetical order. What other precedence can be assigned them? Clay\r\nthe great leader, Webster the great orator, Calhoun the great\r\nthinker.\"\r\n\r\nAs a boy he must often have heard his father say, \"That government is\r\nthe best which allows the largest amount of individual liberty\r\ncompatible with social order.\"\r\n\r\nHis most famous political act is his advocacy of Nullification, an\r\nexplanation and defence of which are found in the extract below. He\r\nwas a devoted adherent of the Union. (See under _Jefferson Davis_.)\r\n\r\nHis life seems to have been entirely political; but he was very fond\r\nof his home where there was always a cheerful happy household. This\r\nhome, \"Fort Hill,\" was in the lovely upland region of South Carolina\r\nin Oconee County. It became the property of his daughter, Mrs. Thomas\r\nG. Clemson, and Mr. Clemson left it at his death to the State, which\r\nhas now established there an Agricultural and Mechanical College.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun died in Washington City, and was buried in St. Philip's\r\nChurchyard, Charleston, his grave being marked by a monument. His\r\npreeminence in South Carolina during his life has not ceased with his\r\ndeath. His picture is found everywhere and his memory is still living\r\nthroughout the entire country.

To correct the\r\nimpression which those misrepresentations are calculated to make, I\r\nwill dwell on the point under consideration a few moments longer.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government has, by an express provision of the\r\nConstitution, the right to lay duties on imports. The state never\r\ndenied or resisted this right, nor even thought of so doing. The\r\ngovernment has, however, not been contented with exercising this power\r\nas she had a right to do, but has gone a step beyond it, by laying\r\nimposts, not for revenue, but for protection. This the state considers\r\nas an unconstitutional exercise of power, highly injurious and\r\noppressive to her and the other staple states, and has accordingly,\r\nmet it with the most determined resistance. I do not intend to enter,\r\nat this time, into the argument as to the unconstitutionality of the\r\nprotective system. It is not necessary. It is sufficient that the\r\npower is nowhere granted; and that, from the journals of the\r\nConvention which formed the Constitution, it would seem that it was\r\nrefused. In support of the journals, I might cite the statement of\r\nLuther Martin, which has already been referred to, to show that the\r\nConvention, so far from conferring the power on the Federal\r\nGovernment, left to the state the right to impose duties on imports,\r\nwith the express view of enabling the several states to protect their\r\nown manufactures. Notwithstanding this, Congress has assumed, without\r\nany warrant from the Constitution, the right of exercising this most\r\nimportant power, and has so exercised it as to impose a ruinous burden\r\non the labor and capital of the state of South Carolina, by which her\r\nresources are exhausted, the enjoyments of her citizens curtailed, the\r\nmeans of education contracted, and all her interests essentially and\r\ninjuriously affected.\r\n\r\nWe have been sneeringly told that she is a small state; that her\r\npopulation does not exceed half a million of souls; and that more than\r\none half are not of the European race. The facts are so. I know she\r\nnever can be a great state, and that the only distinction to which she\r\ncan aspire must be based on the moral and intellectual acquirements of\r\nher sons. To the development of these much of her attention has been\r\ndirected; but this restrictive system, which has so unjustly exacted\r\nthe proceeds of her labor, to be bestowed on other sections, has so\r\nimpaired the resources of the state, that, if not speedily arrested,\r\nit will dry up the means of education, and with it deprive her of the\r\nonly source through which she can aspire to distinction. . . . .\r\n\r\nThe people of the state believe that the Union is a union of states,\r\nand not of individuals; that it was formed by the states, and that the\r\ncitizens of the several states were bound to it through the acts of\r\ntheir several states; that each state ratified the Constitution for\r\nitself; and that it was only by such ratification of a state that any\r\nobligation was imposed upon the citizens; thus believing, it is the\r\nopinion of the people of Carolina, that it belongs to the state which\r\nhas imposed the obligation to declare, in the last resort, the extent\r\nof this obligation, so far as her citizens are concerned; and this\r\nupon the plain principles which exist in all analogous cases of\r\ncompact between sovereign bodies. On this principle, the people of the\r\nstate, acting in their sovereign capacity in convention, precisely as\r\nthey adopted their own and the federal Constitution, have declared by\r\nthe ordinance, that the acts of Congress which imposed duties under\r\nthe authority to lay imposts, are acts, not for revenue, as intended\r\nby the Constitution, but for protection, and therefore null and void.\r\n\r\n    [Mr. Calhoun's biographer, Mr. Jenkins, adds,\r\n    \"Nullification, it has been said, was 'a little\r\n    hurricane while it lasted;' but it cooled the air, and\r\n    'left a beneficial effect on the atmosphere.' Its\r\n    influence was decidedly healthful.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISE CHOICE.\r\n\r\n(_From a speech in 1816._)\r\n\r\nThis country is now in a situation similar to that which one of the\r\nmost beautiful writers of antiquity ascribes to Hercules in his youth.\r\nHe represents the hero as retiring into the wilderness to deliberate\r\non the course of life which he ought to choose. Two goddesses approach\r\nhim; one recommending a life of ease and pleasure; the other, of labor\r\nand virtue. The hero adopts the counsel of the latter, and his fame\r\nand glory are known to the world. May this country, the youthful\r\nHercules, possessing his form and muscles, be animated by similar\r\nsentiments, and follow his example!\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL PATRONAGE.\r\n\r\n(_Speech in the Senate, 1835._)\r\n\r\nTheir object is to get and hold office; and their leading political\r\nmaxim . . . is that, \"to the victors belong the spoils of victory!\"[8]\r\n. . . Can any one, who will duly reflect on these things, venture to\r\nsay that all is sound, and that our Government is not undergoing a\r\ngreat and fatal change? Let us not deceive ourselves, the very essence\r\nof a free government consists in considering _offices as public\r\ntrusts_, bestowed for the good of the country, and not for the benefit\r\nof an individual or a party; and that system of political morals which\r\nregards offices in a different light, as _public prizes_ to be won by\r\ncombatants most skilled in all the arts and corruption of political\r\ntactics, and to be used and enjoyed as their proper spoils--strikes a\r\nfatal blow at the very vitals of free institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] William L.

By a long series of encroachments by the\r\n    federal government on the rights and powers of the\r\n    states, our federative system is supposed to be\r\n    destroyed, and a consolidated government, with the forms\r\n    of a republic and the powers of a monarchy, to be\r\n    established on its ruins. . . . . . As a mere political\r\n    speculation, it is but too probably correct. We trust\r\n    that a benign Providence will so order events as that it\r\n    may not prove also a POLITICAL PROPHECY.--Sou. Lit.\r\n    Messenger, Jan., 1837.]\r\n\r\nToward the latter end of the month of October, 1849, about the hour of\r\nnoon, a horseman was seen ascending a narrow valley at the Eastern\r\nfoot of the Blue Ridge. His road nearly followed the course of a small\r\nstream, which, issuing from a deep gorge of the mountain, winds its\r\nway between lofty hills, and terminates its brief and brawling course\r\nin one of the larger tributaries of the Dan. A glance of the eye took\r\nin the whole of the little settlement that lined its banks, and\r\nmeasured the resources of its inhabitants. The different tenements\r\nwere so near to each other as to allow but a small patch of arable\r\nland to each. Of manufactures there was no appearance, save only a\r\nrude shed at the entrance of the valley, on the door of which the\r\noft-repeated brand of the horseshoe gave token of a smithy. There,\r\ntoo, the rivulet, increased by the innumerable springs which afforded\r\nto every habitation the unappreciated, but inappreciable luxury of\r\nwater, cold, clear, and sparkling, had gathered strength enough to\r\nturn a tiny mill. Of trade there could be none. The bleak and rugged\r\nbarrier, which closed the scene on the west, and the narrow road,\r\nfading to a foot-path, gave assurance to the traveller that he had\r\nhere reached the _ne plus ultra_ of social life in that\r\ndirection. . . . . At length he heard a sound of voices, and then a\r\nshrill whistle, and all was still. Immediately, some half a dozen men,\r\nleaping a fence, ranged themselves across the road and faced him. He\r\nobserved that each, as he touched the ground, laid hold of a rifle\r\nthat leaned against the enclosure, and this circumstance drew his\r\nattention to twenty or more of these formidable weapons, ranged along\r\nin the same position. . . . As the traveller drew up his horse, one of\r\nthe men, speaking in a low and quiet tone, said, \"We want a word with\r\nyou, stranger, before you go any farther.\"\r\n\r\n\"As many as you please,\" replied the other, \"for I am tired and\r\nhungry, and so is my horse; and I am glad to find some one at last,\r\nof whom I may hope to purchase something for both of us to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"_That_ you can have quite handy,\" said the countryman, \"for we have\r\nbeen gathering corn, and were just going to our dinner. If you will\r\nonly just 'light, sir, one of the boys can feed your horse, and you\r\ncan take such as we have got to give you.\"\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted; the horse was taken in charge by a\r\nlong-legged lad of fifteen, without hat or shoes; and the whole party\r\ncrossed the fence together.\r\n\r\nAt the moment a man was seen advancing toward them, who, observing\r\ntheir approach, fell back a few steps, and threw himself on the ground\r\nat the foot of a large old apple-tree. Around this were clustered a\r\nmotley group of men, women, and boys, who opened and made way for the\r\nstranger. He advanced, and bowing gracefully took off his forage cap,\r\nfrom beneath which a quantity of soft curling flaxen hair fell over\r\nhis brow and cheeks. Every eye was now fixed on him, with an\r\nexpression rather of interest than of mere curiosity. Every\r\ncountenance was serious and composed, and all wore an air of business,\r\nexcept that a slight titter was heard among the girls, who, hovering\r\nbehind the backs of their mothers, peeped through the crowd, to get a\r\nlook at the handsome stranger. . . . .\r\n\r\nAs the youth approached, the man at the foot of the tree arose, and\r\nreturned the salutation, which seemed unheeded by the rest. He\r\nadvanced a step or two and invited the stranger to be seated. This\r\naction, and the looks turned towards him by the others, showed that he\r\nwas in authority of some sort among them. With him, therefore, our\r\ntraveller concluded that the proposed conference was to be\r\nheld. . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nHe was at length asked whence he came, and answered, from the\r\nneighborhood of Richmond.--From which side of the river?--From the\r\nnorth side.--Did he know anything of Van Courtlandt?--His camp was at\r\nBacon's branch, just above the town.--What force had he?\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say, certainly,\" he replied, \"but common fame made his\r\nnumbers about four thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all, on both sides of the river?\" said his interrogator.\r\n\r\n\"O, no! Col. Loyal's regiment is at Petersburg, and Col. Cole's at\r\nManchester; each about five hundred strong; and there is a piquet on\r\nthe Bridge Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you cross there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then?\" he was asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly tell you,\" he replied, \"it was at a private ford,\r\nseveral miles above Cartersville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was not that mightily out of the way? What made you come so far\r\naround?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was safer travelling on that side of the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the people on that side of the river are your friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. They are not. But, as they are all of a color there, they would\r\nlet me pass, and ask no questions, as long as I travelled due west. On\r\nthis side, if you are one man's friend, you are the next man's enemy;\r\nand I had no mind to answer questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to answer them now mighty freely.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true. I am like a letter that tells all it knows as soon as\r\nit gets to the right hand; but it does not want to be opened before\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you know that you have got to the right hand now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I know where I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just at the foot of the Devil's-Backbone,\" replied the youth.\r\n\r\n\"Were you ever here before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know then where you are?\" asked the mountaineer.\r\n\r\n\"Because the right way to avoid questions is to ask none. So I took\r\ncare to know all about the road, and the country, and the place,\r\nbefore I left home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who told you all about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I should tell you,\" answered the young man, \"that Van\r\nCourtlandt had a map of the country made, and gave it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say you were a traitor to him, or a spy upon us,\" was the\r\nstern reply.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, a startled hum was heard from the crowd, and the\r\npress moved and swayed for an instant, as if a sort of spasm had\r\npervaded the whole mass.\r\n\r\n\"You are a good hand at questioning,\" said the youth, with a smile,\r\n\"but without asking a single question, I have found out all I wanted\r\nto know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was that?\" asked the other.\r\n\r\n\"Whether you were friends to the Yorkers and Yankees, or to poor old\r\nVirginia.\"\r\n\r\n\"And which _are_ we for?\" added the laconic mountaineer.\r\n\r\n\"For _old Virginia forever_,\" replied the youth. . . . . It was echoed\r\nin a shout, . . . . their proud war-cry of \"_old Virginia forever_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID CROCKETT.\r\n\r\n~1786=1836.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThis renowned hunter and pioneer, commonly called Davy Crockett, was\r\nborn in Limestone, Green County, Tennessee. His free and wild youth\r\nwas spent in hunting. He became a soldier in the war of 1812: he was\r\nelected to the Tennessee Legislature in 1821 and 1823, and to Congress\r\nin 1829 and 1833. His eccentricity of manners, his lack of education,\r\nand his strong common sense and shrewdness made him a marked figure,\r\nespecially in Washington. In 1835 he went to Texas to aid in the\r\nstruggle for independence; and in 1836, was massacred by General Santa\r\nAnna, with five other prisoners, after the surrender of the Alamo,\r\nthese six being the only survivors of a band of one hundred and forty\r\nTexans.

Written by Himself. 1834._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Alamo, San Antonio, Texas.~]\r\n\r\nI don't know of anything in my book to be criticised on by honourable\r\nmen. Is it on my spelling?--that's not my trade. Is it on my\r\ngrammar?--I hadn't time to learn it, and make no pretensions to it.\r\nIs it on the order and arrangement of my book?--I never wrote one\r\nbefore, and never read very many; and, of course, know mighty little\r\nabout that. Will it be on the authorship of the book?--this I claim,\r\nand I'll hang on to it, like a wax plaster. The whole book is my own,\r\nand every sentiment and sentence in it. I would not be such a fool, or\r\nknave either, as to deny that I have had it hastily run over by a\r\nfriend or so, and that some little alterations have been made in the\r\nspelling and grammar; and I am not so sure that it is not the worse of\r\neven that, for I despise this way of spelling contrary to nature. And\r\nas for grammar, it's pretty much a thing of nothing at last, after all\r\nthe fuss that's made about it. In some places, I wouldn't suffer\r\neither the spelling, or grammar, or anything else to be touch'd; and\r\ntherefore it will be found in my own way.\r\n\r\nBut if anybody complains that I have had it looked over, I can only\r\nsay to him, her, or them--as the case may be--that while critics were\r\nlearning grammar, and learning to spell, I, and \"Doctor Jackson,\r\nL. L. D.\" were fighting in the wars; and if our books, and messages,\r\nand proclamations, and cabinet writings, and so forth, and so on,\r\nshould need a little looking over, and a little correcting of the\r\nspelling and grammar to make them fit for use, it's just nobody's\r\nbusiness. Big men have more important matters to attend to than\r\ncrossing their _t's_ and dotting their _i's_--, and such like small\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\nON A BEAR HUNT.\r\n\r\n(_From the Life of David Crockett. Written by Himself. 1834._)\r\n\r\nIt was mighty dark, and was difficult to see my way or anything else.\r\nWhen I got up the hill, I found I had passed the dogs, and so I turned\r\nand went to them. I found, when I got there, they had treed the bear\r\nin a large forked poplar, and it was setting in the fork. I could see\r\nthe lump, but not plain enough to shoot with any certainty, as there\r\nwas no moonlight; and so I set in to hunting for some dry brush to\r\nmake me a light; but I could find none.\r\n\r\nAt last I thought I could shoot by guess, and kill him; so I pointed\r\nas near the lump as I could, and fired away. But the bear didn't come;\r\nhe only clomb up higher, and got out on a limb, which helped me to see\r\nhim better. I now loaded up again and fired, but this time he didn't\r\nmove at all. I commenced loading for a third fire, but the first thing\r\nI knowed the bear was down among my dogs, and they were fighting all\r\naround me. I had my big butcher in my belt, and I had a pair of\r\ndressed buckskin breeches on. So I took out my knife, and stood,\r\ndetermined, if he should get hold of me, to defend myself in the best\r\nway I could. I stood there for some time, and could now and then see a\r\nwhite dog I had, but the rest of them, and the bear, which were dark\r\ncoloured, I couldn't see at all, it was so miserable dark. They still\r\nfought around me, and sometimes within three feet of me; but, at last,\r\nthe bear got down into one of the cracks that the earthquake had made\r\nin the ground, about four feet deep, and I could tell the biting end\r\nof him by the hollering of my dogs. So I took my gun and pushed the\r\nmuzzle of it about, till I thought I had it against the main part of\r\nhis body, and fired; but it happened to be only the fleshy part of his\r\nforeleg. With this, I jumped out of the crack, and he and the dogs had\r\nanother hard fight around me, as before. At last, however, they forced\r\nhim back into the crack again, as he was when I had shot. . .\r\n\r\nI made a lounge with my long knife, and fortunately stuck him right\r\nthrough the heart; at which he just sank down, and I crawled out in a\r\nhurry. In a little while my dogs all come out too, and seemed\r\nsatisfied, which was the way they always had of telling me that they\r\nhad finished him. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nWe prepared for resting that night, and I can a-sure the reader I was\r\nin need of it. We had laid down by our fire, and about ten o'clock\r\nthere came a most terrible earthquake, which shook the earth so, that\r\nwe were rocked about like we had been in a cradle. We were very much\r\nalarmed; for though we were accustomed to feel earthquakes, we were\r\nnow right in the region which had been torn to pieces by them in 1812,\r\nand we thought it might take a notion and swallow us up, like the big\r\nfish did Jonah.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we packed up and moved to the harricane, where we made\r\nanother camp, and turned out that evening and killed a very large\r\nbear, which made _eight_ we had now killed in this hunt.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we entered the harricane again, and in little or no\r\ntime my dogs were in full cry. We pursued them, and soon came to a\r\nthick cane-brake in which they had stopp'd their bear. We got up close\r\nto him, as the cane was so thick that we couldn't see more than a few\r\nfeet. Here I made my friend hold the cane a little open with his gun\r\ntill I shot the bear, which was a mighty large one. I killed him dead\r\nin his tracks. We got him out and butchered him, and in a little time\r\nstarted another and killed him, which now made ten we had killed and\r\nwe know'd we couldn't pack any more home, as we had only five horses\r\nalong; therefore we returned to the camp and salted up all our meat,\r\nto be ready for a start homeward next morning.\r\n\r\nThe morning came and we packed our horses with the meat, and had as\r\nmuch as they could possibly carry, and sure enough cut out for home.\r\nIt was about thirty miles, and we reached home the second day. I\r\n. . . had killed in all, up to that time, fifty-eight bears, during\r\nthe fall and winter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the time came for them to quit their houses and come out\r\nagain in the spring, I took a notion to hunt a little more, and in\r\nabout one month I had killed forty-seven more, which made one hundred\r\nand five bears I had killed in less than one year from that\r\ntime. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nMotto.--Be sure you are right--then go ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD HENRY WILDE.\r\n\r\n~1789=1847.~\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD HENRY WILDE was a native of Ireland but was brought to this\r\ncountry when a child of nine. His father died in 1802 and the widowed\r\nmother took up her residence in Augusta, Georgia. He studied law and\r\nbecame a successful practitioner. He was Attorney-General of the\r\nState, and served also in the Legislature and in Congress. He spent\r\nthe years 1834-40 in Europe studying chiefly Italian literature; in\r\nhis researches he discovered some old documents relating to Dante and\r\na portrait of him painted by Giotto on a wall which had become covered\r\nover with whitewash. On his return to America he settled in New\r\nOrleans and became professor of Law in the University of Louisiana. He\r\ndied there of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nHe began an epic poem, suggested by the life and adventures of his\r\nbrother, James Wilde, in the Seminole war. But it was never finished:\r\nall that remains of it now is the fine lyric, \"My Life is Like the\r\nSummer Rose.\" This song was translated by Anthony Barclay into Greek\r\nand announced to be a newly discovered ode of Alcaeus. This claim was\r\nsoon disproved by the scholars, and to Mr. Wilde was given his due\r\nmeed of poetic authorship. It appears in Stedman's \"Library of\r\nAmerican Literature,\" as dedicated to Mrs. White-Beatty, daughter of\r\nGen.

He was of very social,\r\n    hospitable nature, a practical joker, and, as Dr. Maxcy\r\n    called him, \"a perfect Garrick\" in his conversation. He\r\n    was a lawyer of great ability, and when very young and a\r\n    student at Augusta he was appointed to deliver an\r\n    address of welcome to Washington on his Southern tour.\r\n    If the following anecdotes are not true, they might well\r\n    have been, as Judge Longstreet says.]\r\n\r\nThis being the Sabbath, at the usual hour Ned went to Church, and\r\nselected for his morning service one of those Churches in which the\r\npews are free, and in which the hymn is given out and sung by the\r\ncongregation, a half recitative.\r\n\r\nNed entered the Church, in as fast a walk as he could possibly assume;\r\nproceeded about half down the aisle, and popped himself down in his\r\nseat as quick as if he had been shot. The more thoughtless of the\r\ncongregation began to titter, and the graver peeped up slily, but\r\nsolemnly at him.\r\n\r\nThe pastor rose, and, before giving out the hymn, observed that\r\n_singing_ was a part of the service, in which he thought the whole\r\ncongregation ought to join. Thus saying, he gave out the first lines\r\nof the hymn. As soon as the tune was raised, Ned struck in, with one\r\nof the loudest, hoarsest, and most discordant voices that ever annoyed\r\na solemn assembly.\r\n\r\n\"I would observe,\" said the preacher, before giving out the next two\r\nlines, \"that there are some people who have not the gift of singing;\r\nsuch, of course, are not expected to sing.\"\r\n\r\nNed took the hint and sang no more; but his entrance into church, and\r\nhis entrance into the hymn, had already dispersed the solemnity of\r\nthree fifths of the congregation.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the pastor commenced his sermon, Ned opened his eyes, threw\r\nback his head, dropt his under jaw, and surrendered himself to the\r\nmost intense interest. The preacher was an indifferent one; and by as\r\nmuch as he became dull and insipid, by so much did Ned become absorbed\r\nin his discourse. And yet it was impossible for the nicest observer to\r\ndetect anything in his looks or manner, short of the most solemn\r\ndevotion. The effect which his conduct had upon the congregation, and\r\ntheir subsequent remarks, must be left to the imagination of the\r\nreader. I give but one remark: \"Bless that good man who came in the\r\nchurch so quick,\" said a venerable matron as she left the church\r\ndoor, \"how he was affected by the _sarment_.\"\r\n\r\nNed went to church no more on that day. About four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, while he was standing at the tavern door, a funeral\r\nprocession passed by, at the foot of which, and singly, walked one of\r\nthe smallest men I ever saw. As soon as he came opposite the door, Ned\r\nstepped out and joined him with great solemnity. The contrast between\r\nthe two was ludicrously striking, and the little man's looks and\r\nuneasiness plainly showed that he felt it. However, he soon became\r\nreconciled to it. They proceeded but a little way before Ned inquired\r\nof his companion who was dead.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Noah Bills,\" said the little man.\r\n\r\n\"Nan?\" said Ned, raising his hand to his ear in token of deafness, and\r\nbending his head to the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Noah Bills,\" repeated the little man, loud enough to disturb the\r\ntwo couples immediately before him.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Noel's Bill!\" said Ned with mortification and astonishment. \"Do\r\nthe white persons pay such respect to niggers in Savannah? _I_ sha'n't\r\ndo it.\" So saying, he left the procession.\r\n\r\nThe little man was at first considerably nettled; but upon being left\r\nto his own reflections, he got into an uncontrollable fit of laughter,\r\nas did the couple immediately in advance of him, who overheard Ned's\r\nremark. The procession now exhibited a most mortifying spectacle--the\r\nhead of it in mourning and in tears, and the foot of it convulsed with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SAGE CONVERSATION.\r\n\r\n(_From Georgia Scenes, first edition, 1835._)\r\n\r\n[Three old women over their pipes.]\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Shad._--The old man likes a joke yet right well, the old man\r\ndoes; but he's a mighty good man, and I think he prays with greater\r\nlibity, than most any one of his age I most ever seed,--don't you\r\nthink he does, Mis' Reed?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Reed._--Powerful.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Barney._.--Who did he marry?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Shad._--Why, he married--stop, I'll tell you directly--Why, what\r\ndoes make my old head forget so?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Barney._--Well, it seems to me I don't remember like I used to.\r\nDidn't he marry a Ramsbottom?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Reed._--No. Stay, I'll tell you who he married presently.

He became a lawyer; he\r\nserved in the war of 1812, and was in the State Legislature from 1814\r\nto 1818. He was Attorney-General of the United States under President\r\nMonroe, and in 1823 was elected to the Senate. His most famous speech\r\nis that in the debate with Daniel Webster on the Right of\r\nNullification.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina passed the ordinance of Nullification in November,\r\n1832, elected Mr. Hayne governor, and when President Jackson issued a\r\nmartial proclamation against her action, she prepared for war. Mr.\r\nClay's Tariff Compromise prevented any outbreak.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayne died in Asheville, North Carolina, yet in the prime of life.\r\nSee his Life by Paul Hamilton Hayne.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Speeches.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayne was one of the leaders in the stirring times in which he\r\nlived; the extract following gives an example of his bold, fearless\r\neloquence, and his power in debate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE SOVEREIGNTY AND LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n(_From the Debate with Webster in the Senate, 1830._)\r\n\r\nSir, there have existed, in every age and in every country, two\r\ndistinct orders of men--the _lovers of freedom_ and the devoted\r\n_advocates of power_.\r\n\r\nThe same great leading principles, modified only by the peculiarities\r\nof manners, habits, and institutions, divided parties in the ancient\r\nrepublics, animated the Whigs and Tories of Great Britain,\r\ndistinguished in our own times the Liberals and Ultras of France, and\r\nmay be traced even in the bloody struggles of unhappy Spain. Sir, when\r\nthe gallant Riego, who devoted himself and all that he possessed to\r\nthe liberties of his country, was dragged to the scaffold, followed by\r\nthe tears and lamentations of every lover of freedom throughout the\r\nworld, he perished amid the deafening cries of \"Long live the absolute\r\nKing!\" The people whom I represent, Mr. President, are the descendants\r\nof those who brought with them to this country, as the most precious\r\nof their possessions, \"an ardent love of liberty\"; and while that\r\nshall be preserved, they will always be found manfully struggling\r\nagainst the consolidation of the Government as the worst of\r\nevils. . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Massachusetts, in denouncing what he is pleased to\r\ncall the Carolina doctrine, has attempted to throw ridicule upon the\r\nidea that a State has any constitutional remedy, by the exercise of\r\nits sovereign authority, against \"a gross, palpable, and deliberate\r\nviolation of the Constitution.\" He calls it \"an idle\" or \"a ridiculous\r\nnotion,\" or something to that effect, and added, that it would make\r\nthe Union a \"mere rope of sand.\" Now, sir, as the gentleman has not\r\ncondescended to enter into any examination of the question, and has\r\nbeen satisfied with throwing the weight of his authority into the\r\nscale, I do not deem it necessary to do more than to throw into the\r\nopposite scale the authority on which South Carolina relies; and\r\nthere, for the present, I am perfectly willing to leave the\r\ncontroversy. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . The doctrine that it is the right of a State to judge of the\r\nviolations of the Constitution on the part of the Federal Government,\r\nand to protect her citizens from the operations of unconstitutional\r\nlaws, was held by the enlightened citizens of Boston, who assembled\r\nin Faneuil Hall, on the 25th of January, 1809. They state, in that\r\ncelebrated memorial, that \"they looked only to the State Legislature,\r\nwhich was competent to devise relief against the unconstitutional acts\r\nof the General Government. That your power (say they) is adequate to\r\nthat object, is evident from the organization of the confederacy.\"\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~University of North Carolina.~]\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, Mr. President, that the South Carolina doctrine\r\nis the Republican doctrine of '98,--that it was promulgated by the\r\nfathers of the faith,--that it was maintained by Virginia and Kentucky\r\nin the worst of times,--that it constituted the very pivot on which\r\nthe political revolution of that day turned,--that it embraces the\r\nvery principles, the triumph of which, at that time, saved the\r\nConstitution \"at its last gasp,\" and which New England statesmen were\r\nnot unwilling to adopt when they believed themselves to be the victims\r\nof unconstitutional legislation. Sir, as to the doctrine that the\r\nFederal Government is the exclusive judge of the extent as well as the\r\nlimitations of its power, it seems to me to be utterly perversive of\r\nthe sovereignty and independence of the States. It makes but little\r\ndifference, in my estimation, whether Congress or the Supreme Court\r\nare invested with this power. If the Federal Government, in all, or\r\nany, of its departments, is to prescribe the limits of its own\r\nauthority, and the States are bound to submit to the decision, and are\r\nnot to be allowed to examine and decide when the barriers of the\r\nConstitution shall be overleaped, this is practically, \"a government\r\nwithout limitation of powers.\" The States are at once reduced to mere\r\npetty corporations, and the people are entirely at your mercy. I have\r\nbut one word more to add. In all the efforts that have been made by\r\nSouth Carolina to resist the unconstitutional laws which Congress has\r\nextended over her, she has kept steadily in view the preservation of\r\nthe Union, by the only means by which she believes it can be long\r\npreserved--a firm, manly, and steady resistance against\r\nusurpation. . . . Sir, if, acting on these high motives,--if, animated\r\nby that ardent love of liberty, which has always been the most\r\nprominent trait in the Southern character, we should be hurried beyond\r\nthe bounds of a cold and calculating prudence; who is there, with one\r\nnoble and generous sentiment in his bosom, who would not be disposed,\r\nin the language of Burke, to exclaim, \"You must pardon something to\r\nthe spirit of liberty\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAM HOUSTON.\r\n\r\n~1793=1863.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAM HOUSTON, first President of Texas, was born in Rockbridge\r\nCounty, Virginia, but his widowed mother removed in his childhood to\r\nTennessee and settled near the Cherokee Country. Here he was much with\r\nthe Indians and was adopted by a chief named Oolooteka, who called him\r\nColoneh (the Rover).\r\n\r\nIn 1813 he became a soldier in the Creek war and was almost fatally\r\nwounded at the battle of Tohopeka, or Horse-shoe Bend, Alabama. In\r\n1818 he decided to study law and went to Nashville, where he became\r\nquite successful as a lawyer and soon received political honors, being\r\nelected member of Congress in 1823 and governor of Tennessee in 1827.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 he left Tennessee for the West, spent three years in Arkansas\r\namong the Cherokees who had emigrated thither, his old friend\r\nOolooteka being one of them; and in 1832 went to Texas, with which\r\nState his after life is connected. He was made Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Texan forces in the struggle for independence against Mexico, and\r\nby the battle of San Jacinto, 1836, he put an end to the war, and in\r\nthe same year he was elected first President of the Republic of Texas.\r\nHe was elected again in 1841 after Lamar's administration; and when in\r\n1845 Texas became a State in the Union, he entered the United States\r\nSenate where he served until 1859. He was governor of Texas from 1859\r\nto 1861 and then retired to private life. He is buried at Huntsville.\r\n\r\nHe was ever a warm friend to the Indians; he was opposed to secession,\r\nand took little interest and no part in the Confederate war, except by\r\nallowing his oldest son to enter its service.\r\n\r\nHis life by Rev. Wm. Carey Crane, President of Baylor University,\r\ngives a graphic account of a most interesting and independent\r\ncharacter; and it contains also his literary remains, consisting of\r\n_State Papers_, _Indian Talks_, _Letters_, and _Speeches_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF THE TEXAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n(_From a Letter to Santa Anna, 1842._)\r\n\r\nThe people of Texas were invited to migrate to this country for the\r\npurpose of enjoying equal rights and constitutional liberty. They were\r\npromised the shield of the Constitution of 1824, adopted by Mexico.\r\nConfiding in this pledge, they removed to the country to encounter all\r\nthe privations of a wilderness, under the alluring promises of free\r\ninstitutions. Other reasons operated also. Citizens of the United\r\nStates had engaged in the revolution of Mexico, in 1812. They fought\r\ngallantly in the achievement of Mexican independence, and many of them\r\nsurvive, and to this day occupy the soil which their privations and\r\nvalor assisted in achieving. On their removal here, they brought with\r\nthem no aspirations or projects but such as were loyal to the\r\nConstitution of Mexico. They repelled the Indian savages; they\r\nencountered every discomfort; they subdued the wilderness, and\r\nconverted into cultivated fields the idle waste of this now prolific\r\nterritory. Their courage and enterprise achieved that which the\r\nimbecility of your countrymen had either neglected, or left for\r\ncenturies unaccomplished. Their situation, however, was not\r\ndisregarded by Mexico, though she did not, as might have been\r\nexpected, extend to them a protecting and fostering care, but viewed\r\nthem as objects of cupidity, rapacity, and at last jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe Texans, enduring the annoyances and oppressions inflicted upon\r\nthem, remained faithful to the Constitution of Mexico. In 1832, when\r\nan attempt was made to destroy that Constitution, and when you, sir,\r\nthrew yourself forward as its avowed champion, you were sustained with\r\nall the fidelity and valor that freemen could contribute. On the\r\navowal of your principles, and in accordance with them, the people put\r\ndown the serviles of despotism at Anahuac, Velasco, and Nacogdoches.\r\nThey treated the captives of that struggle with humanity, and sent\r\nthem to Mexico subject to your orders. They regarded you as the friend\r\nof liberty and free institutions; they hailed you as a benefactor of\r\nmankind; your name and your actions were lauded, and the\r\nmanifestations you had given in behalf of the nation were themes of\r\nsatisfaction and delight to the Texan patriots.\r\n\r\nYou can well imagine the transition of feeling which ensued on your\r\naccession to power. Your subversion of the Constitution of 1824, your\r\nestablishment of centralism, your conquest of Zacatecas, characterized\r\nby every act of violence, cruelty, and rapine, inflicted upon us the\r\nprofoundest astonishment. We realized all the uncertainty of men\r\nawakening to reality from the unconsciousness of delirium. In\r\nsuccession came your orders for the Texans to surrender their private\r\narms. The mask was thrown aside and the monster of despotism displayed\r\nin all the habiliments of loathsome detestation.\r\n\r\nThere was presented to Texans the alternative of tamely crouching to\r\nthe tyrant's lash, or exalting themselves to the attributes of\r\nfreemen. They chose the latter. To chastise them for their presumption\r\ninduced your advance upon Texas, with your boasted veteran army,\r\nmustering a force nearly equal to the whole population of this country\r\nat that time. You besieged and took the Alamo: but under what\r\ncircumstances? Not those, surely, which should characterize a general\r\nof the nineteenth century. You assailed one hundred and fifty men,\r\ndestitute of every supply requisite for the defence of that place. Its\r\nbrave defenders, worn by vigilance and duty beyond the power of human\r\nnature to sustain, were at length overwhelmed by a force of nine\r\nthousand men, and the place taken. I ask you, sir, what scenes\r\nfollowed? Were they such as should characterize an able general, a\r\nmagnanimous warrior, and the President of a great nation numbering\r\neight millions of souls? No. Manliness and generosity would sicken at\r\nthe recital of the scenes incident to your success, and humanity\r\nitself would blush to class you among the chivalric spirits of the age\r\nof vandalism.[10] This you have been pleased to class as in the\r\n\"succession of your victories;\" and I presume you would next include\r\nthe massacre at Goliad.\r\n\r\nYour triumph there, if such you are pleased to term it, was not the\r\ntriumph of arms--it was the success of perfidy. Fannin and his brave\r\ncompanions had beaten back and defied your veteran soldiers. Although\r\noutnumbered more than seven to one, their valiant, hearty, and\r\nindomitable courage, with holy devotion to the cause of freedom,\r\nfoiled every effort directed by your general to insure his success by\r\narms. He had recourse to a flag of truce; and when the surrender of\r\nthe little patriot band was secured by the most solemn treaty\r\nstipulations, what were the tragic scenes that ensued to Mexican\r\nperfidy? The conditions of surrender were submitted to you; and,\r\nthough you have denied the facts, instead of restoring them to\r\nliberty, according to the capitulation, you ordered them to be\r\nexecuted contrary to every pledge given them, contrary to the rules of\r\nwar, and contrary to every principle of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF SAN JACINTO.\r\n\r\n(_From General Houston's Report to Hon. D. G. Burnet, Provisional\r\nPresident of the Republic of Texas, April 25, 1836._)\r\n\r\nI have the honor to inform you that on the evening of the eighteenth\r\ninstant, after a forced march of fifty-five miles, which was effected\r\nin two days and a half, the army arrived opposite Harrisburg. That\r\nevening a courier of the enemy was taken, from whom I learned that\r\nGeneral Santa Anna, with one division of his choice troops, had\r\nmarched in the direction of Lynch's Ferry, on the San Jacinto, burning\r\nHarrisburg as he passed down. The army was ordered to be in readiness\r\nto march early on the next morning. The main body effected a crossing\r\nover Buffalo Bayou, below Harrisburg, on the morning of the 19th,\r\nhaving left the baggage, the sick, and a sufficient camp guard in the\r\nrear. We continued the march throughout the night, making but one halt\r\nin the prairie for a short time, and without refreshment.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we resumed the line of march, and in a short distance our\r\nscouts encountered those of the enemy, and we received information\r\nthat General Santa Anna was at New Washington, and would that day take\r\nup the line of march for Anahuac, crossing at Lynch's Ferry. The Texan\r\narmy halted within half a mile of the ferry in some timber, and were\r\nengaged in slaughtering beeves, when the army of Santa Anna was\r\ndiscovered to be approaching in battle array, having been encamped at\r\nClopper's Point, eight miles below. Disposition was immediately made\r\nof our forces, and preparation for his reception. He took a position\r\nwith his infantry and artillery in the centre, occupying an island of\r\ntimber, his cavalry covering the left flank.\r\n\r\nThe artillery, consisting of one double fortified medium brass\r\ntwelve-pounder, then opened on our encampment. The infantry in column\r\nadvanced with the design of charging our lines, but were repulsed by a\r\ndischarge of grape and canister from our artillery, consisting of two\r\nsix-pounders, [called \"The Twin Sisters.\"] The enemy had occupied a\r\npiece of timber within rifle-shot of the left wing of our army, from\r\nwhich an occasional interchange of small arms took place between the\r\ntroops, until the enemy withdrew to a position on the bank of the San\r\nJacinto, about three-quarters of a mile from our encampment, and\r\ncommenced fortification. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock on the morning of the 21st, the enemy were\r\nreinforced by 500 choice troops, under the command of General Cos,\r\nincreasing their effective force to upwards of 1,500 men, whilst our\r\naggregate force for the field numbered 783. At half-past three o'clock\r\nin the evening, I ordered the officers of the Texan army to parade\r\ntheir respective commands, having in the meantime ordered the bridge\r\non the only road communicating with the Brazos, distant eight miles\r\nfrom our encampment, to be destroyed, thus cutting off all possibility\r\nof escape. Our troops paraded with alacrity and spirit, and were\r\nanxious for the conflict. Their conscious disparity in numbers seemed\r\nonly to increase their enthusiasm and confidence, and heightened their\r\nanxiety for the conflict. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nCol. Sherman, with his regiment, having commenced the action upon our\r\nleft wing, the whole line, at the centre and on the right, advancing\r\nin double-quick time, rung the war-cry, \"_Remember the Alamo!_\"\r\nreceived the enemy's fire, and advanced within point-blank shot before\r\na piece was fired from our lines. Our line advanced without a halt,\r\nuntil they were in possession of the woodland and the enemy's\r\nbreastwork, the right wing of Burleson's and the left wing of\r\nMillard's taking possession of the breastwork; our Artillery having\r\ngallantly charged up within seventy yards of the enemy's cannon, when\r\nit was taken by our troops.\r\n\r\nThe conflict lasted about eighteen minutes from the time of close\r\naction until we were in possession of the enemy's encampment, taking\r\none piece of cannon (loaded), four stands of colors, all their camp\r\nequipage, stores, and baggage. Our cavalry had charged and routed that\r\nof the enemy upon the right, and given pursuit to the fugitives, which\r\ndid not cease until they arrived at the bridge which I have mentioned\r\nbefore--Captain Karnes, always among the foremost in danger,\r\ncommanding the pursuers. The conflict in the breastwork lasted but a\r\nfew moments; many of the troops encountered hand to hand, and not\r\nhaving the advantage of bayonets on our side, our riflemen used their\r\npieces as war-clubs, breaking many of them off at the breech. The rout\r\ncommenced at half-past four, and the pursuit by the main army\r\ncontinued until twilight. . . .\r\n\r\n    [In this battle General Houston himself was severely\r\n    wounded, one ball shattering his ankle. After this, \"the\r\n    battalion of Texan infantry was gallantly charged by a\r\n    Mexican division of infantry, composed of more than five\r\n    hundred men. . . . The Commander-in-Chief, observing the\r\n    peril, dashed between the Texan and Mexican infantry,\r\n    and exclaimed, 'Come on, my brave fellows, your General\r\n    leads you.' . . . The order to fire was given by Gen.\r\n    Houston, . . . a single discharge, a rush through the\r\n    smoke, cleaving blows of rifles uplifted struck down\r\n    those whom the bullets had not slain. Only thirty-two of\r\n    the five hundred Mexicans survived to surrender as\r\n    prisoners of war. Gen. Houston's wound in the ankle,\r\n    meanwhile was bleeding profusely. His horse was dying,\r\n    and with difficulty could stagger over the slain. Still\r\n    the Commander-in-Chief witnessed every movement of his\r\n    army, and as it rolled victoriously over the field, saw\r\n    the tide of battle crowning his brave soldiers with\r\n    unparalleled success.\"--See Crane's Life of Sam\r\n    Houston.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DEAL WITH THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\n(_From a speech on the Indian Policy of the Government, in the Senate,\r\nJanuary, 1855._)\r\n\r\nSir, if the agent appointed by Mr. Polk, who has been restored by the\r\npresent Executive--it is a bright spot in his Administration, and I\r\ncommend him for it--had never been removed, there would have been\r\npeace to this day on the borders of Texas; but as soon as the Indian\r\nagent who was appointed to succeed him went there, he must forsooth\r\nestablish a ranche; he must have a farm. The Indians who had been\r\nsettled there from 1843 up to 1849, had been furnished by the\r\nGovernment of Texas with implements of husbandry, with seeds of every\r\ndescription, and they were cultivating their little farms. They were\r\ncomfortable and independent. They were living in perfect peace. If you\r\ncan get Indians located, and place their wives and children within\r\nyour cognizance, you need never expect aggression from them. It is the\r\nIndian who has his wife in security beyond your reach, who, like the\r\nfelon wolf, goes to a distance to prey on some flock, far removed from\r\nhis den; or like the eagle, who seeks his prey from the distance, and\r\nnever from the flocks about his eyrie.\r\n\r\nThe agent to whom I have referred lost two oxen from his ranche where\r\nhe kept his cattle. He went to the officer in command of Fort Belknap,\r\ngot a force from him, and then marched to those Indians, sixty miles\r\nfrom there, and told them they must pay for the oxen. They said, \"We\r\nknow nothing about your oxen; our people are here; here are our women\r\nand children; we have not killed them; we have not stolen them; we\r\nhave enough to eat; we are happy; we have raised corn; we have sold\r\ncorn; we have corn to sell; we have sold it to your people, and they\r\nhave paid us for it, and we are happy.\" The agent and the military\r\ngentlemen scared off the Indians from the limits of Texas, and drove\r\nthem across the Red River to the Wichita Mountains, taking every horse\r\nand animal they had to pay for the two oxen. This was done by an\r\naccredited agent of the Government, and by an officer who deserved but\r\nlittle credit. Are such things tolerable, and to be tolerated in the\r\npresent age and condition of our Government?\r\n\r\nWhat was the consequence? Those Indians felt themselves aggrieved.\r\nThey saw that a new _régime_ had come; they had had the era of peace\r\nand plenty, and now they were expelled by a different influence. They\r\nfelt grateful for the benign effects of the first policy toward them,\r\nand that only exasperated them to a greater extent against the second;\r\nand they began to make incursions, ready to take vengeance on any\r\nwhite man they might meet in their neighborhood, and slay whoever they\r\nmight find. They made their forays from the opposite side of the Red\r\nRiver, from the Wichita Mountains, and came like an avalanche upon our\r\nunprotected citizens. There is one fact showing how your interference\r\nwith the Indians within her limits has injured Texas. . . . . .\r\n\r\nWell, sir, there is a remedy for all this, and it is very easy to\r\napply it; but how are we circumstanced there? Is it supposed by some\r\nthat we are deriving great aid from the army, and that the greatest\r\nportion of the disposable forces of the United States is in Texas, and\r\nprotecting it? How can they protect us against the Indians when the\r\ncavalry have not horses which can trot faster than active oxen, and\r\nthe infantry dare not go out in any hostile manner for fear of being\r\nshot and scalped! Can they pursue a party who pounce down on a\r\nsettlement and take property, and reclaim that property? Have they\r\never done it? Did the old rangers of Texas ever fail to do it, when\r\nthey were seated on their Texas ponies? They were men of intelligence\r\nand adroitness in regard to the Indian character and Indian warfare.\r\n\r\nDo you think a man fit for such service who has been educated at West\r\nPoint Academy, furnished with rich stores of learning; more educated\r\nin the science of war than any general who fought through the\r\nRevolution, and assisted in achieving our independence? Are you going\r\nto take such gentlemen, and suppose that by intuition they will\r\nunderstand the Indian character? Or do you suppose they can track a\r\nturkey, or a deer, in the grass of Texas, or could they track an\r\nIndian, or would they know whether they were tracking a wagon or a\r\ncarriage? Not at all, sir.\r\n\r\nWe wish, in the first place, to have men suited to the circumstances.\r\nGive us agents who are capable of following out their instructions,\r\nand who understand the Indian character. Give us an army, gentlemen,\r\nwho understand not only the science of command, but have some notions\r\nof extending justice and protection to the Indian, against the\r\naggression of the whites, while they protect the whites against the\r\naggressions from the Indians. Then, and not till then, will you have\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nHow is this to be done? Withdraw your army. Have five hundred\r\ncavalry, if you will; but I would rather have two hundred and fifty\r\nTexas rangers (such as I could raise), than five hundred of the best\r\ncavalry now in the service. . . . . . Cultivate intercourse with the\r\nIndians. Show them that you have comforts to exchange for their\r\npeltries; bring them around you; domesticate them; familiarize them\r\nwith civilization. Let them see that you are rational beings, and they\r\nwill become rational in imitation of you; but take no whiskey there at\r\nall, not even for the officers, for fear their generosity would let it\r\nout. . . . . . I would have fields around the trading houses. I would\r\nencourage the Indians to cultivate them. Let them see how much it adds\r\nto their comfort, how it insures to their wives and children abundant\r\nsubsistence; and then you win the Indian over to civilization; you\r\ncharm him, and he becomes a civilized man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[10] Every one in the Alamo was massacred.

M'Cord.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY SOCIETY IN COLUMBIA, 1825.\r\n\r\n(_Written on the Death of Colonel David J. M'Cord, 1855._)\r\n\r\nMany will bring tributes of sorrow, of kindness and affection, and\r\nrelieve a heaving bosom by uttering words of praise and commendation;\r\nfor in truth, during many years he has been the charm and delight of\r\nthe society of Columbia, and of that society, too, when, in the\r\nestimation of all who knew it, it was the rarest aggregation of\r\nelegant, intellectual, and accomplished people that have ever been\r\nfound assembled in our village. Thirty years since, amidst the sincere\r\nand unostentatious cordiality which characterized it, at a dinner\r\nparty, for example, at Judge De Saussure's, eight or ten of his\r\nfavorite associates wanted to do honor to some distinguished\r\nstranger--for such were never permitted to pass through the town\r\nwithout a tender of the hospitality of that venerable and elegant\r\ngentleman--whose prolonged life exhibited to another generation a\r\npattern of old gentility, combined with a conscientious and effective\r\nperformance of not only the smaller and more graceful duties of life,\r\nwhich he sweetened and adorned, but also of those graver and higher\r\ntasks which the confidence of his state imposed upon his talents and\r\nlearning. To his elegant board naturally came the best and worthiest\r\nof the land. There was found, of equal age with the judge, that very\r\nremarkable man, Dr. Thomas Cooper, replete with all sorts of\r\nknowledge, a living encyclopædia,--\"_Multum ille et terris jactatus et\r\nalto_\"--good-tempered, joyous, and of a kindly disposition. There was\r\nJudge Nott, who brought into the social circle the keen, shrewd, and\r\nflashing intellect which distinguished him on the bench. There was\r\nAbram Blanding, a man of affairs, very eminent in his profession of\r\nthe law, and of most interesting conversation. There was Professor\r\nRobert Henry, with his elegant, accurate, and classical scholarship.\r\nThere were Judges Johnston and Harper, whom we all remember, and\r\nlament, and admire.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen and others were called, in the course of a morning\r\nwalk of the Chancellor, to meet at dinner, it might be, Mr. Calhoun,\r\nor Captain Basil Hall, or Washington Irving; and amongst these was\r\nsure to be found David J. M'Cord, with his genial vivacity, his\r\nmultifarious knowledge, and his inexhaustible store of amusing and\r\napposite anecdotes. He was the life and the pervading spirit of the\r\ncircle,--in short, a general favorite. He was then in large practice\r\nat the bar, and publishing his Reports as State Reporter. His frank\r\nand fine manners were rendered the more attractive by an uncommonly\r\nbeautiful physiognomy, which gave him the appearance of great youth.\r\n\r\nM'Cord entered upon his profession in co-partnership with Henry\r\nJunius Nott; and when a year or two subsequently, this gentleman,\r\nfollowing the bent of his inclination for literature, quitted the\r\nprofession, Mr. M'Cord formed a connection with W. C. Preston,--thus\r\nintroducing this gentleman, who had then but just come to Columbia,\r\ninto practice. The business of the office was extensive, and the\r\nconnexion continued until their diverging paths of life led them away\r\nfrom the profession. The association was cordial and uninterrupted\r\nthroughout, whether professional or social; and the latter did not\r\ncease until the grave closed upon M'Cord. While in the law, however,\r\nalthough assiduously addicted to the study of it, his heart\r\nacknowledged a divided allegiance with literature; which he seemed to\r\ncompromise at length by addicting himself to cognate studies--of\r\npolitical economy, the jural sciences, and political ethics.\r\n\r\nWhen he left the bar, and retired from the more strenuous pursuits of\r\nlife, he found occupation and delight in these favorite\r\nstudies--stimulated and enhanced by the vigorous co-operation and warm\r\nsympathy of his highly accomplished wife, who not only participated in\r\nthe taste for, but shared in the labors of, these studies--and amidst\r\nthese congenial and participated pursuits the latter years of his life\r\nwere passed. . . . . As his early life was amidst struggle and\r\nbustle--the _fumum strepitumque_ of the public arena--so his latter\r\nyears were amidst the repose of an elegant and lettered retirement, in\r\nhis well-cultivated fields and amongst his books. His last moments\r\nwere solaced by the tender assiduities of his congenial helpmate, of\r\nhis children, and of his old and long-familiar friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN PENDLETON KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n~1795=1870.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN PENDLETON KENNEDY was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and received\r\nan excellent early education. He studied law, and was much in public\r\nlife; he filled a large place in his native city as a man of culture\r\nand a public-spirited citizen. He served in the State Assembly and in\r\nCongress, and was Secretary of the Navy under President Fillmore when\r\nseveral important expeditions took place, that of Perry to Japan, of\r\nLynch to Africa, of Kane to the North Pole. Kennedy Channel was named\r\nin his honor by Dr. Kane.\r\n\r\nHe made several trips to Europe and while in Paris became well\r\nacquainted with Thackeray. \"The Virginians\" was appearing as a serial,\r\nand the printers needed a new chapter. Thackeray said to Kennedy, \"I\r\nwish you would write one for me.\"--\"Well,\" said Kennedy, \"so I will if\r\nyou will give me the run of the story.\" And he really wrote the fourth\r\nchapter of Vol. II., describing Warrington's escape and return home\r\nthrough the region about the Cumberland, which he knew well.\r\n\r\nHe drew up the plan of the Peabody Institute, and was one of the\r\nTrustees; to it he bequeathed his library and manuscripts, the latter\r\nnot to be published till 1900. He aided Poe in his early literary life\r\nand was always his friend. He died at Newport, whither he had gone for\r\nhis health, and was buried in Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore.

He is now in the\r\nmeridian of life--somewhere about forty-five. Good cheer and an easy\r\ntemper tell well upon him. The first has given him a comfortable,\r\nportly figure, and the latter a contemplative turn of mind, which\r\ninclines him to be lazy and philosophical.\r\n\r\nHe has some right to pride himself on his personal appearance, for he\r\nhas a handsome face, with a dark blue eye and a fine intellectual\r\nbrow. His head is growing scant of hair on the crown, which induces\r\nhim to be somewhat particular in the management of his locks in that\r\nlocality, and these are assuming a decided silvery hue.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to see him when he is going to ride to the Court House\r\non business occasions. He is then apt to make his appearance in a coat\r\nof blue broad-cloth, astonishingly glossy, and with an unusual amount\r\nof plaited ruffle strutting through the folds of a Marseilles\r\nwaistcoat. A worshipful finish is given to this costume by a large\r\nstraw hat, lined with green silk. There is a magisterial fulness in\r\nhis garments which betokens condition in the world, and a heavy bunch\r\nof seals, suspended by a chain of gold, jingles as he moves,\r\npronouncing him a man of superfluities.\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nI am told he keeps the peace as if he commanded a garrison, and\r\nadministers justice like a Cadi.\r\n\r\nHe has some claim to supremacy in this last department; for during\r\nthree years he smoked segars in a lawyer's office in Richmond, which\r\nenabled him to obtain a bird's-eye view of Blackstone and the Revised\r\nCode. Besides this, he was a member of a Law Debating Society, which\r\nate oysters once a week in a cellar; and he wore, in accordance with\r\nthe usage of the most prominent law-students of that day, six cravats,\r\none over the other, and yellow-topped boots, by which he was\r\nrecognized as a blood of the metropolis. Having in this way qualified\r\nhimself to assert and maintain his rights, he came to his estate, upon\r\nhis arrival at age, a very model of landed gentlemen. Since that time\r\nhis avocations have had a certain literary tincture; for having\r\nsettled himself down as a married man, and got rid of his superfluous\r\nfoppery, he rambled with wonderful assiduity through a wilderness of\r\nromances, poems, and dissertations, which are now collected in his\r\nlibrary, and, with their battered blue covers, present a lively type\r\nof an army of continentals at the close of the war, or a hospital of\r\ninvalids. These have all at last given way to the newspapers--a\r\nmiscellaneous study very attractive and engrossing to country\r\ngentlemen. This line of study has rendered Meriwether a most perilous\r\nantagonist in the matter of legislative proceedings.\r\n\r\nA landed proprietor, with a good house and a host of servants, is\r\nnaturally a hospitable man. A guest is one of his daily wants. A\r\nfriendly face is a necessary of life, without which the heart is apt\r\nto starve, or a luxury without which it grows parsimonious. Men who\r\nare isolated from society by distance, feel these wants by an\r\ninstinct, and are grateful for an opportunity to relieve them. In\r\nMeriwether the sentiment goes beyond this. It has, besides, something\r\ndialectic in it. His house is open to everybody, as freely almost as\r\nan inn. But to see him when he has had the good fortune to pick up an\r\nintelligent, educated gentleman, and particularly one who listens\r\nwell!--a respectable, assentatious stranger!--All the better if he has\r\nbeen in the Legislature, and better still, if in Congress. Such a\r\nperson caught within the purlieus of Swallow Barn, may set down one\r\nweek's entertainment as certain--inevitable, and as many more as he\r\nlikes, the more the merrier. He will know something of the quality of\r\nMeriwether's rhetoric before he is gone.\r\n\r\nThen again, it is very pleasant to see Frank's kind and considerate\r\nbearing towards his servants and dependents. His slaves appreciate\r\nthis, and hold him in most affectionate reverence, and, therefore, are\r\nnot only contented, but happy under his dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nWhilst Frank Meriwether amuses himself with his quiddities, and floats\r\nthrough life upon the current of his humor, his dame, my excellent\r\ncousin Lucretia, takes charge of the household affairs, as one who has\r\na reputation to stake upon her administration. She has made it a\r\nperfect science, and great is her fame in the dispensation thereof!\r\n\r\nThose who visited Swallow Barn will long remember the morning stir, of\r\nwhich the murmurs arose even unto the chambers, and fell upon the ears\r\nof the sleepers; the dry-rubbing of floors, and even the waxing of the\r\nsame until they were like ice;--and the grinding of coffee-mills;--and\r\nthe gibber of ducks and chickens and turkeys; and all the multitudinous\r\nconcert of homely sounds. And then, her breakfasts! I do not wish to be\r\ncounted extravagant, but a small regiment might march in upon her\r\nwithout disappointment, and I would put them for excellence and variety\r\nagainst anything that ever was served upon platter. Moreover, all things\r\ngo like clock-work. She rises with the lark, and infuses an early vigor\r\ninto the whole household. And yet, she is a thin woman to look upon, and\r\na feeble; with a sallow complexion, and a pair of animated black eyes\r\nwhich impart a portion of fire to a countenance otherwise demure from\r\nthe paths worn across it, in the frequent travel of a low-country ague.\r\nBut, although her life has been somewhat saddened by such visitations,\r\nmy cousin is too spirited a woman to give up to them; for she is\r\ntherapeutical, and considers herself a full match for any reasonable\r\ntertian in the world. Indeed, I have sometimes thought that she took\r\nmore pride in her leechcraft than becomes a Christian woman; she is even\r\na little vain-glorious. For, to say nothing of her skill in compounding\r\nsimples, she has occasionally brought down upon her head the sober\r\nremonstrances of her husband, by her pertinacious faith in the efficacy\r\nof certain spells in cases of intermittent. But there is no reasoning\r\nagainst her experience. She can enumerate the cases--\"and men may say\r\nwhat they choose about its being contrary to reason, and all that;--it\r\nis their way! But seeing is believing--nine scoops of water in the\r\nhollow of the hand, from the sycamore spring, for three mornings, before\r\nsunrise, and a cup of strong coffee with lemon-juice, will break an\r\nague, try it when you will.\" In short, as Frank says, \"Lucretia will die\r\nin that creed.\"\r\n\r\nI am occasionally up early enough to be witness to her morning\r\nregimen, which, to my mind, is rather tyrannically enforced against\r\nthe youngsters of her numerous family, both white and black. She is in\r\nthe habit of preparing some death-routing decoction for them, in a\r\nsmall pitcher, and administering it to the whole squadron in\r\nsuccession, who severally swallow the dose with a most ineffectual\r\neffort at repudiation, and gallop off, with faces all rue and\r\nwormwood.\r\n\r\nEverything at Swallow Barn, that falls within the superintendence of\r\nmy cousin Lucretia is a pattern of industry. In fact, I consider her\r\nthe very priestess of the American system, for, with her, the\r\nprotection of manufactures is even more a passion than a principle.\r\nEvery here and there, over the estate, may be seen, rising in humble\r\nguise above the shrubbery, the rude chimney of a log cabin, where all\r\nthe livelong day, the plaintive moaning of the spinning-wheel rises\r\nfitfully upon the breeze, like the fancied notes of a hobgoblin, as\r\nthey are sometimes imitated in the stories with which we frighten\r\nchildren. In these laboratories the negro women are employed in\r\npreparing yarn for the loom, from which is produced not only a\r\ncomfortable supply of winter clothing for the working people, but some\r\nexcellent carpets for the house.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to behold how affectionately vain our good hostess is\r\nof Frank, and what deference she shows to him in all matters, except\r\nthose that belong to the home department; for there she is confessedly\r\nand without appeal, the paramount power. It seems to be a dogma with\r\nher, that he is the very \"first man in Virginia,\" an expression which\r\nin this region has grown into an emphatic provincialism. Frank, in\r\nreturn, is a devout admirer of her accomplishments, and although he\r\ndoes not pretend to have an ear for music, he is in raptures at her\r\nskill on the harpsichord, when she plays at night for the children to\r\ndance; and he sometimes sets her to singing \"The Twins of Latona,\"\r\nand \"Old Towler,\" and \"The Rose-Tree in Full Bearing\" (she does not\r\nstudy the modern music), for the entertainment of his company. On\r\nthese occasions, he stands by the instrument, and nods his head, as if\r\nhe comprehended the airs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HORSE-SHOE AND ANDREW CAPTURED FIVE MEN.\r\n\r\n(_From Horse-Shoe Robinson, a Tale of the Tory Ascendancy in\r\nS. C._[11])\r\n\r\n[Mistress Ramsay speaking to Horse-Shoe Robinson:]\r\n\r\n\"Who should come in this morning, just after my husband had cleverly\r\ngot away on his horse, but a young cock-a-whoop ensign, that belongs\r\nto Ninety-Six, and four great Scotchmen with him, all in red coats;\r\nthey had been out thieving, I warrant, and were now going home again.\r\nAnd who but they! Here they were, swaggering all about my house--and\r\ncalling for this--and calling for that--as if they owned the\r\nfee-simple of every thing on the plantation. And it made my blood\r\nrise, Mr. Horse-Shoe, to see them run out in the yard, and catch up my\r\nchickens and ducks, and kill as many as they could string about\r\nthem--and I not daring to say a word: though I did give them a piece\r\nof my mind, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is at home with you?\" inquired the sergeant eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody but my youngest boy, Andrew,\" answered the dame. \"And then,\r\nthe filthy, toping rioters--\" she continued, exalting her voice.\r\n\r\n\"What arms have you in the house?\" asked Robinson, without heeding the\r\ndame's rising anger.\r\n\r\n\"We have a rifle, and a horseman's pistol that belongs to John.--They\r\nmust call for drink, too, and turn my house, of a Sunday morning, into\r\na tavern.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State House, Columbia, S. C.~]\r\n\r\n\"They took the route towards Ninety-Six, you said, Mistress Ramsay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,--they went straight forward upon the road. But, look you, Mr.\r\nHorse-Shoe, you're not thinking of going after them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there an old field, about a mile from this, on that road?\"\r\ninquired the sergeant, still intent upon his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" replied the dame; \"with the old school-house upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lop-sided, rickety log-cabin in the middle of the field. Am I\r\nright, good woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nobody lives in it? It has no door to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There ha'n't been anybody in it these seven years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the place very well,\" said the sergeant, very thoughtfully;\r\n\"there is woods just on this side of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" replied the dame; \"but what is it you are thinking\r\nabout, Mr. Robinson?\"\r\n\r\n\"How long before this rain began was it that they quitted this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not above fifteen minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mistress Ramsay, bring me the rifle and pistol both--and the\r\npowder-horn and bullets.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you say, Mr. Horse-Shoe,\" answered the dame, as she turned round\r\nto leave the room; \"but I am sure I can't suspicion what you mean to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the woman returned with the weapons, and gave them to\r\nthe sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Andy?\" asked Horse-Shoe.\r\n\r\nThe hostess went to the door and called her son, and, almost\r\nimmediately afterwards, a sturdy boy of about twelve or fourteen years\r\nof age entered the apartment, his clothes dripping with rain. He\r\nmodestly and shyly seated himself on a chair near the door, with his\r\nsoaked hat flapping down over a face full of freckles and not less\r\nrife with the expression of an open, dauntless hardihood of character.\r\n\r\n\"How would you like a scrummage, Andy, with them Scotchmen that stole\r\nyour mother's chickens this morning?\" asked Horse-Shoe.\r\n\r\n\"I'm agreed,\" replied the boy, \"if you will tell me what to\r\ndo.\" . . . . . .\r\n\r\nHorse-Shoe now loaded the fire-arms, and having slung the pouch across\r\nhis body, he put the pistol into the hands of the boy; then\r\nshouldering his rifle, he and his young ally left the room. Even on\r\nthis occasion, serious as it might be deemed, the sergeant did not\r\ndepart without giving some manifestation of that lightheartedness\r\nwhich no difficulties ever seemed to have the power to conquer. He\r\nthrust his head back into the room, after he had crossed the\r\nthreshold, and said with an encouraging laugh, \"Andy and me will teach\r\nthem, Mistress Ramsay, Pat's point of war--we will _surround_ the\r\nragamuffins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Andy, my lad,\" said Horse-Shoe, after he had mounted Captain\r\nPeter, \"you must get up behind me. . . . .\" . . . . By the time that\r\nhis instructions were fully impressed upon the boy, our adventurous\r\nforlorn hope, as it may fitly be called, had arrived at the place\r\nwhich Horse-Shoe Robinson had designated for the commencement of\r\nactive operations. They had a clear view of the old field, and it\r\nafforded them a strong assurance that the enemy was exactly where they\r\nwished him to be, when they discovered smoke arising from the chimney\r\nof the hovel. Andrew was soon posted behind a tree, and Robinson only\r\ntarried a moment to make the boy repeat the signals agreed on, in\r\norder to ascertain that he had them correctly in his memory. Being\r\nsatisfied from this experiment that the intelligence of his young\r\ncompanion might be depended upon, he galloped across the intervening\r\nspace, and, in a few seconds, abruptly reined up his steed, in the\r\nvery doorway of the hut. The party within was gathered around a fire\r\nat the further end, and, in the corner near the door, were four\r\nmuskets thrown together against the wall. To spring from his saddle\r\nand thrust himself one pace inside of the door, was a movement which\r\nthe sergeant executed in an instant, shouting at the same time--\r\n\r\n\"Halt! File off right and left to both sides of the house, and wait\r\norders. I demand the surrender of all here,\" he said, as he planted\r\nhimself between the party and their weapons. \"I will shoot down the\r\nfirst man who budges a foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leap to your arms,\" cried the young officer who commanded the little\r\nparty inside of the house. \"Why do you stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to do you or your men any harm, young man,\" said\r\nRobinson, as he brought his rifle to a level, \"but, by my father's\r\nson, I will not leave one of you to be put upon a muster-roll if you\r\nraise a hand at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nBoth parties now stood, for a brief space, eyeing each other in\r\nfearful suspense, during which there was an expression of doubt and\r\nirresolution visible on the countenances of the soldiers, as they\r\nsurveyed the broad proportions, and met the stern glance of the\r\nsergeant, whilst the delay, also, began to raise an apprehension in\r\nthe mind of Robinson that his stratagem would be discovered.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I let loose upon them, Captain?\" said Andrew Ramsay, now\r\nappearing, most unexpectedly to Robinson, at the door of the hut.\r\n\"Come on, boys!\" he shouted, as he turned his face towards the field.\r\n\r\n\"Keep them outside of the door--stand fast,\" cried the doughty\r\nsergeant, with admirable promptitude, in the new and sudden posture of\r\nhis affairs caused by this opportune appearance of the boy. \"Sir, you\r\nsee that it's not worth while fighting five to one; and I should be\r\nsorry to be the death of any of your brave fellows; so, take my\r\nadvice, and surrender to the Continental Congress and this scrap of\r\nits army which I command.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this appeal the sergeant was ably seconded by the lad outside,\r\nwho was calling out first on one name, and then on another, as if in\r\nthe presence of a troop. The device succeeded, and the officer within,\r\nbelieving the forbearance of Robinson to be real, at length said:--\r\n\r\n\"Lower your rifle, sir. In the presence of a superior force, taken by\r\nsurprise, and without arms, it is my duty to save bloodshed. With the\r\npromise of fair usage, and the rights of prisoners of war, I surrender\r\nthis little foraging party under my command.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make the terms agreeable,\" replied the sergeant. \"Never doubt\r\nme, sir. Right hand file, advance, and receive the arms of the\r\nprisoners!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm here, captain,\" said Andrew, in a conceited tone, as if it were a\r\nmere occasion of merriment; and the lad quickly entered the house and\r\nsecured the weapons, retreating with them some paces from the door.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said Horse-Shoe to the Ensign, \"your sword, and whatever\r\nelse you mought have about you of the ammunitions of war!\"\r\n\r\nThe officer delivered his sword and a pair of pocket pistols.\r\n\r\nAs Horse-Shoe received these tokens of victory, he asked, with a\r\nlambent smile, and what he intended to be an elegant and condescending\r\ncomposure, \"Your name, sir, if I mought take the freedom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ensign St. Jermyn, of his Majesty's seventy-first regiment of light\r\ninfantry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ensign, your sarvant,\" added Horse-Shoe, still preserving this\r\nunusual exhibition of politeness. \"You have defended your post like an\r\nold sodger, although you ha'n't much beard on your chin; but, seeing\r\nyou have given up, you shall be treated like a man who has done his\r\nduty. You will walk out now, and form yourselves in line at the door.\r\nI'll engage my men shall do you no harm; they are of a marciful\r\nbreed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the little squad of prisoners submitted to this command, and came\r\nto the door, they were stricken with equal astonishment and\r\nmortification to find, in place of the detachment of cavalry which\r\nthey expected to see, nothing but a man, a boy, and a horse. Their\r\nfirst emotions were expressed in curses, which were even succeeded by\r\nlaughter from one or two of the number. There seemed to be a\r\ndisposition on the part of some to resist the authority that now\r\ncontrolled them; and sundry glances were exchanged, which indicated a\r\npurpose to turn upon their captors. The sergeant no sooner perceived\r\nthis, than he halted, raised his rifle to his breast, and at the same\r\ninstant, gave Andrew Ramsay an order to retire a few paces, and to\r\nfire one of the captured pieces at the first man who opened his lips.\r\n\r\n\"By my hand,\" he said, \"if I find any trouble in taking you, all five,\r\nsafe away from this here house, I will thin your numbers with your own\r\nmuskets! And that's as good as if I had sworn to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have my word, sir,\" said the Ensign. \"Lead on.\"\r\n\r\n\"By your leave, my pretty gentlemen, you will lead and I'll follow,\"\r\nreplied Horse-Shoe. \"It may be a new piece of drill to you; but the\r\ncustom is to give the prisoners the post of honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please, sir,\" answered the Ensign. \"Where do you take us to?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will march back by the road you came,\" said the sergeant.\r\n\r\nFinding the conqueror determined to execute summary martial law upon\r\nthe first who should mutiny, the prisoners submitted, and marched in\r\ndouble file from the hut back towards Ramsay's--Horse-Shoe, with\r\nCaptain Peter's bridle dangling over his arm, and his gallant young\r\nauxiliary Andrew, laden with double the burden of Robinson Crusoe\r\n(having all the fire-arms packed upon his shoulders), bringing up the\r\nrear. In this order victors and vanquished returned to David Ramsay's.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have brought you your ducks and chickens back, mistress,\"\r\nsaid the sergeant, as he halted the prisoners at the door; \"and,\r\nwhat's more, I have brought home a young sodger that's worth his\r\nweight in gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven bless my child! my brave boy!\" cried the mother, seizing the\r\nlad in her arms, and unheeding anything else in the present\r\nperturbation of her feelings. \"I feared ill would come of it; but\r\nHeaven has preserved him. Did he behave handsomely, Mr. Robinson? But\r\nI am sure he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little more venturesome, ma'am, than I wanted him to be,\" replied\r\nHorse-Shoe; \"but he did excellent service. These are his prisoners,\r\nMistress Ramsay; I should never have got them if it hadn't been for\r\nAndy. In these drumming and fifing times the babies suck in quarrel\r\nwith their mother's milk. Show me another boy in America that's made\r\nmore prisoners than there was men to fight them with, that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[11] By permission of G. P. Putnam's Sons, N.

He was educated at\r\nSouth Carolina College which he entered at the age of fourteen, and\r\nbecame an excellent scholar, especially in the languages both ancient\r\nand modern. He studied law, and then completed his education in the\r\ngood old way by a course of travel and study in Europe. His learning\r\nis said to have been almost phenomenal: he was one of the founders of\r\nthe \"Southern Review.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return from Europe, 1820, he was elected to the State\r\nLegislature: 1830, he was made Attorney-General of the State; from\r\n1832 to 1836 he was _chargé d'affaires_ at Brussels; in 1836 he was\r\nelected to Congress, and in 1841 appointed Attorney-General of the\r\nUnited States.

WAR.\r\n\r\n(_From a speech in the House, 1837._)\r\n\r\nA people well clad and well housed will be sure to provide themselves\r\nwith all the other comforts of life; and it is the diffusion of these\r\ncomforts, and the growing taste for them, among all classes of society\r\nin Europe, it is the desire of riches, as it is commonly called, that\r\nis gradually putting an end to the destructive and bloody game of war,\r\nand reserving all the resources hitherto wasted by it, for enterprises\r\nof industry and commerce, prosecuted with the fiery spirit which once\r\nvented itself in scenes of peril and carnage.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, the result of all this is that very inequality of wealth,\r\nthat accumulation of vast masses of it in a few hands, against which\r\nwe have heard so much said lately, as if it were something\r\ninconsistent with the liberties, the happiness, and the moral and\r\nintellectual improvement of mankind. Gigantic fortunes are acquired by\r\na few years of prosperous commerce--mechanics and manufacturers rival\r\nand surpass the princes of the earth in opulence and splendor. The\r\nface of Europe is changed by this active industry, working with such\r\nmighty instruments, on so great a scale.\r\n\r\nI have travelled in parts of the continent which the spirit of gain,\r\nwith its usual concomitants, industry and improvement, has invaded\r\nsince the peace, at an interval of fifteen years, and been struck with\r\nthe revolution that is going on. There is a singularly beautiful,\r\nthough rather barren tract of country between Liege and Spa, where, in\r\n1819, my attention had been principally attracted by the striking\r\nfeatures of a mountainous region, with here and there a ruin of the\r\nfeudal past, and here and there a hovel of some poor hind,--the very\r\nhaunt of the \"Wild Boar of Ardennes\" in the good old times of the\r\nHouse of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nI returned to it in 1835, and saw it covered with mills and factories,\r\nbegrimed with the smoke and soot of steam-engines; its romantic beauty\r\ndeformed, its sylvan solitudes disturbed and desecrated by the sounds\r\nof active industry, and the busy hum of men. I asked what had brought\r\nabout so great a change, and found that the author of it,--a man\r\nhaving a more numerous band of retainers and dependents than any\r\nbaron bold of the fourteenth century, and in every respect more\r\nimportant than many of the sovereign princes on the other side of the\r\nRhine--was an English manufacturer, who had established himself there\r\nsome twenty years ago, without much capital, and had effected all this\r\nby his industry and enterprise.\r\n\r\nSuch, sir, is the spirit of the age; of course, in this young and\r\nwonderfully progressive country, it is more eager and ardent--and\r\ntherefore occasionally extravagant--than anywhere else. But it is in\r\nvain to resist it. Nay, I believe it is worse than vain. It is\r\nevidently in the order of nature, and we must take it with all its\r\ngood and all its evils together.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES' COURAGE.\r\n\r\n[_From the Essay on Demosthenes._]\r\n\r\nThe charge of effeminacy and want of courage in battle seems to be\r\nconsidered as better founded. Plutarch admits it fully. His foppery is\r\nmatter of ridicule to Æschines, who, at the same time, in rather a\r\nremarkable passage in his speech on the Crown, gives us some clue to\r\nthe popular report as to his deficiency in the military virtues of\r\nantiquity. \"Who,\" says he \"will be there to sympathize with him? Not\r\nthey who have been trained with him in the same gymnasium? No, by\r\nOlympian Jove! for, in his youth, instead of hunting the wild boar and\r\naddicting himself to exercises which give strength and activity to the\r\nbody, he was studying the arts that were one day to make him the\r\nscourge of the rich.\" Those exercises were, in the system of the\r\nGreeks, . . . considered as absolutely indispensable to a liberal\r\neducation. That of Demosthenes was certainly neglected by his\r\nguardians, and the probability is that the effeminacy with which he\r\nwas reproached meant nothing more than that he had not frequented in\r\nyouth the palestra and the gymnasium, and that his bodily training had\r\nbeen sacrificed to his intellectual.\r\n\r\nThat he possessed moral courage of the most sublime order is passed\r\nall question; but his nerves were weak. If the tradition that is come\r\ndown to us in regard to his natural defects as an orator is not a\r\ngross exaggeration, he had enough to occupy him for years in the\r\ncorrection of them. But what an idea does it suggest to us of the\r\nmighty will, the indomitable spirit, the decided and unchangeable\r\nvocation, that, in spite of so many impediments, his genius fulfilled\r\nits destiny, and attained at last to the supremacy at which it aimed\r\nfrom the first! His was that deep love of ideal beauty, that\r\npassionate pursuit of eloquence in the abstract, that insatiable\r\nthirst after perfection in art for its own sake, without which no man\r\never produced a masterpiece of genius. Plutarch, in his usual graphic\r\nstyle, places him before us as if he were an acquaintance,--aloof from\r\nthe world; immersed in the study of his high calling, with his brow\r\nnever unbent from care and thought; severely abstemious in the midst\r\nof dissoluteness and debauchery; a water-drinker among Greeks; like\r\nthat other Agonistes, elected and ordained to struggle, to suffer, and\r\nto perish for a people unworthy of him:--\r\n\r\n    \"His mighty champion, strong above compare,\r\n    Whose drink was only from the liquid brook.\"\r\n\r\nLet any one who has considered the state of manners at Athens just at\r\nthe moment of his appearance upon the stage of public life, imagine\r\nwhat an impression such a phenomenon must have made upon a people so\r\nlost in profligacy and sensuality of all sorts. What wonder that the\r\nunprincipled though gifted Demades, the very personification of the\r\nwitty and reckless libertinism of the age, should deride and scoff at\r\nthis strange man, living as nobody else lived, thinking as nobody else\r\nthought; a prophet, crying from his solitude of great troubles at\r\nhand; the apostle of the past; the preacher of an impossible\r\nrestoration; the witness to his contemporaries that their degeneracy\r\nwas incorrigible and their doom hopeless; and that another seal in the\r\nbook was broken, and a new era of calamity and downfall opened in the\r\nhistory of nations.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the character of Demosthenes might be divined from\r\nhis eloquence; and so the character of his eloquence was a mere\r\nemanation of his own. It was the life and soul of the man, the\r\npatriot, the statesman. \"Its highest attribute of all,\" says\r\nDionysius, \"is the spirit of life--+to pneuma+--that pervades it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA DUKE'S OPINIONS OF VIRGINIA, NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA, AND GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n[_From a Review of \"Travels of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar\" in 1825-6._]\r\n\r\nIn his journey through Virginia, our traveller visited Mr. Jefferson,\r\nwith whom, however, he does not appear to have been as much struck as\r\nhe had been with the late Mr. Adams. The Natural Bridge he pronounces\r\n\"one of the greatest wonders of nature he ever beheld,\" albeit he had\r\nseen \"Vesuvius and the Phlegrean Fields, the Giant's Causeway in\r\nIreland, the Island of Staffa, and the Falls of Niagara.\" \"Finally\"\r\n(to use a favorite mode of expression of his own), he is amazed at the\r\nprofusion of militia titles in Virginia, which almost persuaded him\r\nthat he was at the headquarters of a grand army, and at the\r\naristocratic notions of some of the gentlemen in the same state, who\r\nmake no secret of their taste for primogeniture laws and hereditary\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nHe passed through North Carolina too rapidly to do anything like\r\njustice to the many remarkable things which that respectable state\r\nhas to boast of. Accordingly, his observations are principally\r\nconfined to the inns where he stopped, the roads over which he\r\ntravelled, and the mere exterior of the towns and villages which the\r\nstage-coach traverses in its route. He is of opinion, from what he saw\r\nin that region, that \"it would be a good speculation to establish a\r\nglass manufactory in a country, where there is such a want of glass,\r\nand a superabundance of pine-trees and sand.\" It had almost escaped\r\nus, that he here for the first time made the acquaintance of a \"great\r\nmany large vultures, called buzzards, the shooting of which is\r\nprohibited, as they feed upon carrion, and contribute in this manner\r\nto the salubrity of the country.\" This \"parlous wild-fowl\" has the\r\nhonor to attract the attention of his Highness again in Charleston,\r\nwhere he informs us that its life is, in like manner, protected by\r\nlaw, and where it is called from its resemblance to another bird, the\r\nturkey-buzzard. . . . In Columbia, he became acquainted with most of\r\nthe distinguished inhabitants, of whose very kind attentions to him he\r\nspeaks in high terms. The following good-natured hint too may not be\r\naltogether useless: \"At Professor Henry's a very agreeable society\r\nassembled at dinner. At that party I observed a singular manner which\r\nis practiced; the ladies sit down by themselves at one of the corners\r\nof the table. But I broke the old custom, and glided between them; and\r\nno one's appetite was injured thereby.\" . . . .\r\n\r\nNothing . . . can be a stronger exemplification of the difficulties\r\nunder which a stranger labors, in his efforts to acquire a knowledge\r\nof a country new to him, than the perpetual mistakes which our\r\ndistinguished traveller commits in his brief notices of Georgia. . . .\r\nEven the complexion of the people of Georgia displeased him, and,\r\ncoming from a Court where French was not only the fashionable but the\r\ncommon language of social intercourse, he considers the education of\r\nwomen neglected, because they are not taught that language in\r\nsituations where they might never have occasion to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRABEAU BUONAPARTE LAMAR.\r\n\r\n~1798=1859.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRABEAU BUONAPARTE LAMAR, second president of the Republic of Texas,\r\nwas born in Louisville, Georgia. In 1835 he emigrated to Texas and\r\ntook part in the struggle for independence against Mexico, being\r\nmajor-general in the army. He was successively Attorney-General in the\r\ncabinet of President Houston, Secretary of War, Vice-president, and in\r\n1838 President of the Republic, the second of the four presidents that\r\nTexas had before it became a State in the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1857-8 he was United States minister to Central America.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Verse Memorials.\r\n\r\nLamar was rather a man of action than of letters; but the following\r\nverses speak for him as having true poetic appreciation of beauty and\r\npower to express it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAUGHTER OF MENDOZA.\r\n\r\n    O lend to me, sweet nightingale,\r\n      Your music by the fountain,\r\n    And lend to me your cadences,\r\n      O rivers of the mountain!\r\n    That I may sing my gay brunette,\r\n    A diamond spark in coral set,\r\n      Gem for a prince's coronet--\r\n        The daughter of Mendoza.\r\n\r\n    How brilliant is the evening star,\r\n    The evening light how tender,--\r\n    The light of both is in her eyes,\r\n      Their softness and their splendor.\r\n    But for the lash that shades their light\r\n    They were too dazzling for the sight,\r\n      And when she shuts them, all is night,--\r\n        The daughter of Mendoza.\r\n\r\n    O ever bright and beauteous one,\r\n      Bewildering and beguiling,\r\n    The lute is in thy silvery tones,\r\n      The rainbow in thy smiling;\r\n    And thine is, too, o'er hill and dell,\r\n    The bounding of the young gazelle,\r\n      The arrow's flight and ocean's swell--\r\n        Sweet daughter of Mendoza!\r\n\r\n    What though, perchance, we no more meet,--\r\n    What though too soon we sever?\r\n    Thy form will float like emerald light\r\n    Before my vision ever.\r\n    For who can see and then forget\r\n    The glories of my gay brunette--\r\n      Thou art too bright a star to set,\r\n        Sweet daughter of Mendoza!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS LISTER HAWKS.\r\n\r\n~1798=1866.~\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS LISTER HAWKS was born at New Berne, North Carolina, and\r\neducated at the State University.

In truth, the greater\r\nportion of the Indians around, manifested implacable ill-will, and\r\nhad already murdered one of the assistants, who had incautiously\r\nstrayed alone from the settlement on Roanoke island.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, by direction of Raleigh, given before leaving\r\nEngland, Manteo was baptized, (being probably the first native of this\r\ncontinent who ever received this sacrament at the hands of the\r\nEnglish) and was also called Lord of Roanoke and of Dasamonguepeuk, as\r\nthe reward of his fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA DARE, THE FIRST ENGLISH CHILD BORN IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA few days after, another event, not without interest in the little\r\ncolony, occupied the attention of all; and doubtless in no small\r\ndegree enlisted the sympathies of the female portion of the\r\nadventurers. On the 18th of August, Eleanor, the daughter of Governor\r\nWhite, and wife of Mr. Dare, one of the assistants, gave birth to a\r\ndaughter, the first child born of English parents upon the soil of the\r\nUnited States. On the Sunday following, in commemoration of her\r\nbirth-place, she was baptized by the name of VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST COLONY OF ROANOKE.\r\n\r\n(_From the Same._)\r\n\r\nGovernor White remained but thirty-six days in North Carolina. . . .\r\nBefore he left, however, it seems to have been understood that the\r\ncolony should remove from Roanoke Island and settle on the main land:\r\nand as, at his return, he might be at some loss to find them, it was\r\nfurther agreed that in the event of their departure during his\r\nabsence, they should carve on some post or tree the name of the place\r\nwhither they had gone; and if in distress they were to carve above it\r\na cross, . . . [This was in 1587.]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the 20th of March, 1590, that Governor White embarked\r\n[at London] in three ships to seek his colony and his children. . .\r\nWhite found the island of Roanoke a desert. As he approached he\r\nsounded a signal trumpet, but no answer was heard to disturb the\r\nmelancholy stillness that brooded over the deserted spot. What had\r\nbecome of the wretched colonists? No man may with certainty say: for\r\nall that White found to indicate their fate was a high post bearing on\r\nit the letters CRO, and at the former site of their village he found a\r\ntree which had been deprived of its bark and bore in well cut\r\ncharacters the word CROATAN. There was some comfort in finding no\r\ncross carved above the word, but this was all the comfort the unhappy\r\nfather and grandfather could find. He of course hastened back to the\r\nfleet, determined instantly to go to Croatan, but a combination of\r\nunpropitious events defeated his anxious wishes; storms and a\r\ndeficiency of food forced the vessels to run for the West Indies for\r\nthe purpose of refitting, wintering and returning; but even in this\r\nplan White was disappointed and found himself reluctantly compelled to\r\nrun for the western islands and thence for England. Thus ended the\r\neffort to find the lost colony; they were never heard of. That they\r\nwent to Croatan, where the natives were friendly, is almost certain;\r\nthat they became gradually incorporated with them is probable from the\r\ntestimony of a historian [John Lawson] who lived in North Carolina and\r\nwrote [published] in 1714: \"The Hatteras Indians who lived on Roanoke\r\nIsland or much frequented it, tell us,\" (says he) \"that several of\r\ntheir ancestors were white people and could talk in a book, as we do;\r\nthe truth of which is confirmed by gray eyes being found frequently\r\namongst these Indians and no others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE DENISON PRENTICE.\r\n\r\n~1802=1870.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE DENISON PRENTICE was born in Preston, Connecticut, and was a\r\nteacher and lawyer in early life.

Hark! on the winds,\r\n    The bell's deep-notes are swelling. 'Tis the knell\r\n    Of the departed year.\r\n\r\n                        No funeral train\r\n    Is sweeping past; yet on the stream and wood,\r\n    With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest,\r\n    Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred,\r\n    As by a mourner's sigh; and on yon cloud,\r\n    That floats so still and placidly through heaven,\r\n    The spirits of the seasons seem to stand--\r\n    Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,\r\n    And Winter, with his aged locks--and breathe\r\n    In mournful cadences, that come abroad\r\n    Like the far wind harp's wild and touching wail,\r\n    A melancholy dirge o'er the dead Year,\r\n    Gone from the earth forever.\r\n\r\n                        'Tis a time\r\n    For memory and for tears. Within the deep,\r\n    Still chambers of the heart a spectre dim,\r\n    Whose tones are like the wizard voice of Time,\r\n    Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold\r\n    And solemn finger to the beautiful\r\n    And holy visions that have passed away\r\n    And left no shadow of their loveliness\r\n    On the dead waste of life. That spectre lifts\r\n    The coffin-lid of hope, and joy, and love,\r\n    And, bending mournfully above the pale,\r\n    Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers\r\n    O'er what has passed to nothingness.\r\n\r\n                        The year\r\n    Has gone, and, with it, many a glorious throng\r\n    Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,\r\n    Its shadow on each heart. In its swift course\r\n    It waved its scepter o'er the beautiful,\r\n    And they are not. It laid its pallid hand\r\n    Upon the strong man, and the haughty form\r\n    Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.\r\n    It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged\r\n    The bright and joyous, and the tearful wail\r\n    Of stricken ones is heard, where erst the song\r\n    And reckless shout resounded. It passed o'er\r\n    The battle plain, where sword, and spear, and shield\r\n    Flashed in the light of midday--and the strength\r\n    Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,\r\n    Green from the soil of carnage, waves above\r\n    The crushed and mouldering skeleton. It came\r\n    And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;\r\n    Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,\r\n    It heralded its millions to their home\r\n    In the dim land of dreams.\r\n\r\n                        Remorseless Time!--\r\n    Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! what power\r\n    Can stay him in his silent course, or melt\r\n    His iron heart to pity? On, still on\r\n    He presses and forever. The proud bird,\r\n    The condor of the Andes, that can soar\r\n    Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave\r\n    The fury of the Northern hurricane\r\n    And bathe his plumage in the thunder's home,\r\n    Furls his broad wings at nightfall and sinks down\r\n    To rest upon his mountain crag--but Time\r\n    Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness,\r\n    And night's deep darkness has no chain to bind\r\n    His rushing pinion. Revolutions sweep\r\n    O'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast\r\n    Of dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink,\r\n    Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles\r\n    Spring, blazing, from the ocean, and go back\r\n    To their mysterious caverns; mountains rear\r\n    To heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow\r\n    Their tall heads to the plain; new empires rise,\r\n    Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,\r\n    And rush down like the Alpine avalanche,\r\n    Startling the nations; and the very stars,\r\n    Yon bright and burning blazonry of God,\r\n    Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,\r\n    And, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,\r\n    Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away,\r\n    To darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,\r\n    Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,\r\n    Dark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not\r\n    Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,\r\n    To sit and muse, like other conquerors,\r\n    Upon the fearful ruin he has wrought.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n(_From Prenticeana._)\r\n\r\nA pin has as much head as a good many authors, and a good deal more\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish men hold that women have no souls, and prove by their\r\ntreatment of them that they have none themselves.\r\n\r\nA writer in the \"American Agriculturist\" insists that farmers ought to\r\nlearn to make better fences.

The Jesuits of\r\nthat island obtained permission to put on board of those ships, and to\r\nsend to the Jesuits of Louisiana, some sugar canes, and some negroes\r\nwho were used to the cultivation of this plant. The canes were put\r\nunder ground, according to the directions given, on the plantation of\r\nthe reverend fathers, which was immediately above Canal street, on a\r\nportion of the space now occupied by the Second Municipality of the\r\ncity of New Orleans. But it seems that the experiment proved abortive,\r\nand it was only in 1796 that the cultivation of the cane, and the\r\nmanufacturing of sugar, was successfully introduced in Louisiana, and\r\ndemonstrated to be practicable. It was then that this precious reed\r\nwas really naturalized in the colony, and began to be a source of\r\never-growing wealth, [owing to the enterprise of Jean Étienne de\r\nBoré].\r\n\r\nOn board of the same ships, there came sixty girls, who were\r\ntransported to Louisiana at the expense of the King. It was the last\r\nemigration of the kind. These girls were married to such soldiers as\r\nhad distinguished themselves for their good conduct, and who, in\r\nconsideration of their marriage, were discharged from service.\r\nConcessions of land were made to each happy pair, with one cow and its\r\ncalf, one cock and five hens, one gun, one axe, and one spade. During\r\nthe first three years of their settlement, they were to receive\r\nrations of provisions, and a small quantity of powder, shot, grains\r\nand seeds of all sorts.\r\n\r\nSuch is the humble origin of many of our most respectable and wealthy\r\nfamilies, and well may they be proud of a social position, which is\r\ndue to the honest industry and hereditary virtues of several\r\ngenerations. Whilst some of patrician extraction, crushed under the\r\nweight of vices, or made inert by sloth, or labor-contemning pride,\r\nand degenerating from pure gold into vile dross, have been swept away,\r\nand have sunk into the dregs and sewers of the commonwealth. Thus in\r\nLouisiana, the high and the low, although the country has never\r\nsuffered from any political or civil convulsions, seem to have, in the\r\ncourse of one century, frequently exchanged with one another their\r\nrespective positions, much to the philosopher's edification. . .\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of September, the intendant Commissary, Michel de la\r\nRouvillière, made a favorable report on the state of agriculture in\r\nLouisiana. \"The cultivation of the wax tree,\" says he, \"has succeeded\r\nadmirably. Mr. Dubreuil, alone, has made six thousand pounds of wax.\r\nOthers have obtained as handsome results, in proportion to their\r\nforces; some went to the seashore, where the wax tree grows wild, in\r\norder to use it in its natural state. It is the only luminary used\r\nhere by the inhabitants, and it is exported to other parts of America\r\nand to France. We stand in need of tillers of the ground, and of\r\nnegroes. The colony prospers rapidly from its own impulse, and\r\nrequires only gentle stimulation. In the last three years, forty-five\r\nbrick houses were erected in New Orleans, and several fine new\r\nplantations were established.\" . . . .\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Marquis of Vaudreuil was long and fondly\r\nremembered in Louisiana, as an epoch of unusual brilliancy, but which\r\nwas followed up by corresponding gloom. His administration, if small\r\nthings may be compared with great ones, was for Louisiana, with regard\r\nto splendor, luxury, military display, and expenses of every kind,\r\nwhat the reign of Louis XIV. had been for France. He was a man of\r\npatrician birth and high breeding, who liked to live in a manner\r\nworthy of his rank. Remarkable for his personal graces and comeliness,\r\nfor the dignity of his bearing and the fascination of his address, he\r\nwas fond of pomp, show, and pleasure; surrounded by a host of\r\nbrilliant officers, of whom he was the idol, he loved to keep up a\r\nminiature court, in distant imitation of that of Versailles; and long\r\nafter he had departed, old people were fond of talking of the\r\nexquisitely refined manners, of the magnificent balls, of the\r\nsplendidly uniformed troops, of the high-born young officers, and of\r\nthe many other unparalleled things they had seen in the days of the\r\n_Great Marquis_.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe inventories made of the property of the twelve gentlemen, whom the\r\ndecree of the Spanish tribunal had convicted of rebellion, afford\r\ninteresting proofs of the Spartan simplicity which existed in the\r\ncolony. Thus the furniture of the bed-room of Madam Villeré, who was\r\nthe wife of one of the most distinguished citizens of Louisiana, and\r\nthe grand-daughter of De Lachaise, who came to the colony in 1723 as\r\nordaining commissary, was described as consisting of a cypress\r\nbedstead, three feet wide by six in length, with a mattress of corn\r\nshucks and one of feathers on the top, a bolster of corn shucks, and a\r\ncoarse cotton counterpane or quilt, manufactured probably by the lady\r\nherself, or by her servants; six chairs of cypress wood, with straw\r\nbottoms; some candlesticks with common wax, the candles made in the\r\ncountry, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the house was not more splendidly furnished, and the\r\nhouse itself, as described in the inventory, must have looked very\r\nmuch like one of those modest and unpainted little wood structures\r\nwhich are, to this day, to be seen in many parts of the banks of the\r\nriver Mississippi, and in the Attakapas and Opelousas parishes. They\r\nare the tenements of our small planters who own only a few slaves, and\r\nthey retain the appellation of _Maisons d'Acadiens, or Acadian\r\nhouses_.\r\n\r\nVilleré's plantation, situated at the German coast, was not large, and\r\nthe whole of his slaves, of both sexes and of all ages, did not exceed\r\nthirty-two. His friends and brother conspirators, who were among the\r\nfirst gentlemen in the land, did not live with more ostentation. All\r\nthe sequestrated property being sold, it was found that, after having\r\ndistributed among the widows and other creditors what they were\r\nentitled to, and after paying the costs of the trial and inventories,\r\nthe royal treasury had little or nothing to receive. . . . . .\r\n\r\nThere were but humble dwellings in Louisiana in 1769, and he who would\r\nhave judged of their tenants from their outward appearance would have\r\nthought that they were occupied by mere peasants, but had he passed\r\ntheir thresholds he would have been amazed at being welcomed with such\r\nmanners as were habitual in the most polished court of Europe, and\r\nentertained by men and women wearing with the utmost ease and grace\r\nthe elegant and rich costume of the reign of Louis XV. There, the\r\npowdered head, the silk and gold flowered coat, the lace and frills,\r\nthe red-heeled shoe, the steel handled sword, the silver knee buckles,\r\nthe high and courteous bearing of the gentleman, the hoop petticoat,\r\nthe brocaded gown, the rich head dress, the stately bow, the slightly\r\nrouged cheeks, the artificially graceful deportment, and the\r\naristocratic features of the lady, formed a strange contrast with the\r\nroughness of surrounding objects. It struck one with as much\r\nastonishment as if diamonds had been found capriciously set by some\r\nunknown hand in one of the wild trees of the forest, or it reminded\r\nthe imagination of those fairy tales in which a princess is found\r\nasleep in a solitude, where none but beasts of prey were expected to\r\nroam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREE OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n(_From History of Louisiana._)\r\n\r\nIn a lot situated at the corner of Orleans and Dauphine streets, in\r\nthe city of New Orleans, there is a tree which nobody looks at without\r\ncuriosity and without wondering how it came there. For a long time it\r\nwas the only one of its kind known in the state, and from its isolated\r\nposition it has always been cursed with sterility. It reminds one of\r\nthe warm climes of Africa or Asia, and wears the aspect of a stranger\r\nof distinction driven from his native country. Indeed with its sharp\r\nand thin foliage, sighing mournfully under the blast of one of our\r\nNovember northern winds, it looks as sorrowful as an exile. Its\r\nenormous trunk is nothing but an agglomeration of knots and bumps,\r\nwhich each passing year seems to have deposited there as a mark of\r\nage, and as a protection against the blows of time and of the world.\r\n\r\nInquire for its origin, and every one will tell you that it has stood\r\nthere from time immemorial. A sort of vague but impressive mystery is\r\nattached to it, and it is as superstitiously respected as one of the\r\nold oaks of Dodona. Bold would be the axe that would strike the first\r\nblow at that foreign patriarch; and if it were prostrated to the\r\nground by a profane hand, what native of the city would not mourn\r\nover its fall, and brand the act as an unnatural and criminal deed?\r\nSo, long live the date-tree of Orleans street--that time-honored\r\ndescendant of Asiatic ancestors!\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1727, a French vessel of war landed at New Orleans\r\na man of haughty mien, who wore the Turkish dress, and whose whole\r\nattendance was a single servant. He was received by the governor with\r\nthe highest distinction, and was conducted by him to a small but\r\ncomfortable house with a pretty garden, then existing at the corner of\r\nOrleans and Dauphine streets, and which, from the circumstance of its\r\nbeing so distant from other dwellings, might have been called a rural\r\nretreat, although situated in the limits of the city. There the\r\nstranger, who was understood to be a prisoner of state, lived in the\r\ngreatest seclusion; and although neither he nor his attendant could be\r\nguilty of indiscretion, because none understood their language, and\r\nalthough Governor Périer severely rebuked the slightest inquiry, yet\r\nit seemed to be the settled conviction in Louisiana, that the\r\nmysterious stranger was a brother of the Sultan, or some great\r\npersonage of the Ottoman empire, who had fled from the anger of the\r\nvicegerent of Mohammed, and who had taken refuge in France.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan had peremptorily demanded the fugitive, and the French\r\ngovernment, thinking it derogatory to its dignity to comply with that\r\nrequest, but at the same time not wishing to expose its friendly\r\nrelations with the Moslem monarch, and perhaps desiring for political\r\npurposes, to keep in hostage the important guest it had in its hands,\r\nhad recourse to the expedient of answering that he had fled to\r\nLouisiana, which was so distant a country, that it might be looked\r\nupon as the grave, where, as it was suggested, the fugitive might be\r\nsuffered to wait in peace for actual death, without danger or offence\r\nto the Sultan. Whether this story be true or not is now a manner of\r\nso little consequence that it would not repay the trouble of a strict\r\nhistorical investigation.\r\n\r\nThe year 1727 was drawing to its close, when on a dark stormy night\r\nthe howling and barking of the numerous dogs in the streets of New\r\nOrleans were observed to be fiercer than usual, and some of that class\r\nof individuals who pretend to know everything, declared that by the\r\nvivid flashes of the lightning, they had seen swiftly and stealthily\r\ngliding toward the residence of the _unknown_ a body of men who wore\r\nthe scowling appearance of malefactors and ministers of blood. There\r\nafterwards came also a report that a piratical-looking Turkish vessel\r\nhad been hovering a few days previous in the bay of Barataria. Be it\r\nas it may, on the next morning the house of the stranger was deserted.\r\nThere were no traces of mortal struggle to be seen; but in the garden\r\nthe earth had been dug, and _there_ was the unmistakable indication of\r\na recent grave.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, all doubts were removed by the finding of an\r\ninscription in Arabic characters, engraved on a marble tablet, which\r\nwas subsequently sent to France. It ran thus: \"The justice of heaven\r\nis satisfied, and the date-tree shall grow on the traitor's tomb. The\r\nsublime Emperor of the faithful, the supporter of the faith, the\r\nomnipotent master and Sultan of the world, has redeemed his vow. God\r\nis great, and Mohammed is his prophet. Allah!\" Some time after this\r\nevent, a foreign-looking tree was seen to peep out of the spot where a\r\ncorpse must have been deposited in that stormy night, when the rage of\r\nthe elements yielded to the pitiless fury of man, and it thus\r\nexplained in some degree this part of the inscription, \"the date-tree\r\nshall grow on the traitor's grave.\"\r\n\r\nWho was he, or what had he done, who had provoked such relentless and\r\nfar-seeking revenge? Ask Nemesis,--or, at that hour when evil spirits\r\nare allowed to roam over the earth and magical invocations are made,\r\ngo and interrogate the tree of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY.\r\n\r\n~1806=1873.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY, the \"Pathfinder of the Sea,\" was born in\r\nSpottsylvania County, Virginia, reared in Tennessee, and entered the\r\nNavy in 1825, rising to be lieutenant in 1837. In 1839 he met with an\r\naccident which lamed him for life, and he thenceforward spent his time\r\nin study and investigation of naval subjects. Under the pen-name of\r\n\"Harry Bluff,\" he wrote some essays for the \"Southern Literary\r\nMessenger,\" which produced great reforms in the Navy and led to the\r\nestablishment of the Naval Academy at Annapolis.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 he was appointed superintendent of the Hydrographical Office,\r\nand in 1844, of the National Observatory, at Washington, the latter\r\nposition including the former. The observations of winds, currents,\r\nand storms, which he caused to be made during nine years, are embodied\r\nin his \"Wind and Current Charts;\" and the system thus begun was\r\nadopted by all European countries and has proven of immense benefit\r\nboth to commerce and science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Florida State Agricultural College (Main Building),\r\nLake City, Fla.~]\r\n\r\nTo him and to Lieutenant John M. Brooke, afterwards Com. Brooke,\r\nC. S. N., belongs the credit of deep-sea soundings; and to him we owe\r\nthe suggestion of the submarine telegraphic cable across the Atlantic.\r\n(_See below, letter to Secretary of the Navy._) Cyrus W. Field said,\r\nat a dinner given in 1858 to celebrate the first cable message across\r\nthe Atlantic,--\"Maury furnished the brains, England gave the money,\r\nand I did the work.\"\r\n\r\nHis \"Physical Geography of the Sea\" has been translated into all the\r\nlanguages of Europe, and caused Humboldt to say that Maury had founded\r\na new science. His researches and scientific labors gained him honors\r\nand medals from all scientific societies. His \"Navigation\" and\r\n\"Geographies\" are in popular use in our schools. His style is\r\nirresistibly attractive, being clear, strong, elegant, and indicative\r\nof truth in the man behind it.\r\n\r\nHe entered the Confederate service in 1861, and was employed at first\r\nat Richmond and later as naval agent in Europe. When Lee surrendered,\r\nhe was in the West Indies on his way to put in use against Federal\r\nvessels in Southern ports a method of arranging torpedo mines which he\r\nhad invented.\r\n\r\nHe then went to Mexico (1865) and took a position in the Cabinet of\r\nthe Emperor Maximilian; but the revolution there (1866) terminated his\r\nrelations with that government. After two years in England, he\r\nreturned to Virginia and in 1868 became professor of Physics in the\r\nVirginia Military Institute. At this time the University of Cambridge\r\nconferred upon him the degree of LL. D., and the Emperor of the French\r\ninvited him to Paris as superintendent of the Imperial Observatory.\r\n\r\nHis life has been written in a most engaging style by his daughter,\r\nMrs. Diana Fontaine Maury Corbin.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Navigation.\r\n    Scraps from the Lucky Bay, by Harry Bluff.\r\n    Rebuilding Southern Commerce.\r\n    Wind and Current Charts.\r\n    Sailing Directions.\r\n    Physical Geography of the Sea.\r\n    Series of Geographies.\r\n    Physical Survey of Virginia.\r\n    Resources of West Virginia (with Wm.

So far from this being the case, some currents of the sea\r\nactually run up-hill, while others run on a level. The Gulf Stream is\r\nof the first class. In a paper read before the National Institute in\r\n1844, I showed why the bottom of the Gulf Stream ought, theoretically,\r\nto be an inclined plane, running _upwards_. If the Gulf Stream be 200\r\nfathoms deep in the Florida Pass, and but 100 fathoms off Hatteras, it\r\nis evident that the bottom would be lifted 100 fathoms within that\r\ndistance; and therefore, while the bottom of the Gulf Stream runs\r\nup-hill, the top preserves the water-level, or nearly so; for its\r\nbanks are of sea-water, and being in the ocean, are themselves on a\r\nwater-level. . .\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nI have also, on a former occasion, pointed out the fact, that,\r\ninasmuch as the Gulf Stream is a bed of warm water, lying between\r\nbanks of cold water--that as warm water is lighter than\r\ncold--therefore, the surface of the Gulf Stream ought, theoretically,\r\nto be in the shape of a double inclined plane, like the roof a house,\r\ndown which we may expect to find a shallow surface or roof current,\r\nrunning from the middle towards either edge of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this roof-current does exist has been fully\r\nestablished . . . . . . by officers of the navy. Thus, in lowering a\r\nboat to try a current, they found that the boat would invariably be\r\ndrifted towards one side or other of the stream, while the vessel\r\nherself was drifted along in the direction of it. . .\r\n\r\nThis feature of the Gulf Stream throws a gleam of light upon the\r\n_locus_ of the Gulf weed, by proving that its place of growth cannot\r\nbe on this side (west) of that stream. No Gulf weed is ever found west\r\nof the axis of the Gulf Stream; and, if we admit the top of the stream\r\nto be higher in the middle than at the edges, it would be difficult to\r\nimagine how the Gulf weed should cross it, or get from one side of it\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nThe inference, therefore, would be, that as all the Gulf weed which is\r\nseen about this stream is on its eastern declivity, the _locus_ of the\r\nweed must be somewhere within or near the borders of the stream, and\r\nto the east of the middle. And this idea is strengthened by the report\r\nof Captain Scott, a most intelligent ship-master, who informs me that\r\nhe has seen the Gulf weed growing on the Bahama Banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS.\r\n\r\n(_From a Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, 1854, given in Mrs.\r\nCorbin's Life of Maury._[14])\r\n\r\nThe U. S. brig \"Dolphin,\" lieutenant commanding O. H. Berryman, was\r\nemployed last summer upon special services connected with this\r\noffice. . . . He was directed also to carry along a line of deep-sea\r\nsoundings from the shores of Newfoundland to those of Ireland. The\r\nresult is highly interesting upon the question of a submarine\r\ntelegraph across the Atlantic, and I therefore beg leave to make it\r\nthe subject of a special report.\r\n\r\nThis line of deep-sea sounding seems to be DECISIVE of the question as\r\nto the practicability of a submarine telegraph between the two\r\ncontinents _in so far as the bottom of the deep sea is concerned_.\r\nFrom Newfoundland to Ireland the distance between the nearest points\r\nis about 1600 miles, and the bottom of the sea between the two places\r\nis a plateau which seems to have been placed there especially for the\r\npurpose of holding the wires of the submarine telegraph, and of\r\nkeeping them out of harm's way. It is neither too deep nor too\r\nshallow; yet it is so deep that the wires but once landed will remain\r\nforever beyond the reach of the anchors of vessels, icebergs, and\r\ndrifts of any kind, and so shallow, that they may be readily lodged\r\nupon the bottom. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nA wire laid across from either of the above-named places on this side\r\nto the north of the Grand Banks, will rest on that beautiful plateau\r\nto which I have alluded, and where the waters of the sea appear to be\r\nas quiet and as completely at rest as it is at the bottom of a\r\nmill-pond. It is proper that the reasons should be stated for the\r\ninference that there are no perceptible currents and no abrading\r\nagents at work at the bottom of the sea upon this telegraphic plateau.\r\nI derive this inference from the study of a physical fact, which I\r\nlittle deemed, when I sought it, had any such bearings.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Berryman brought up, with \"Brooke's deep-sea sounding\r\napparatus,\" specimens of the bottom from this plateau. I sent them to\r\nProfessor Bailey, at West Point, for examination under his microscope.\r\nThis he kindly undertook, and that eminent microscopist was quite as\r\nmuch surprised to find, as I was to learn, that all these specimens of\r\ndeep-sea soundings are filled with microscopic shells. To use his own\r\nwords, \"not a particle of sand or gravel exists in them.\" These little\r\nshells therefore suggest the fact that there are no currents at the\r\nbottom of the sea whence they come; that Brooke's lead found them\r\nwhere they were deposited in their burial-place. . . .\r\n\r\nHad there been currents at the bottom, they would have swept and\r\nabraded and mingled up with these microscopic remains the _débris_ of\r\nthe bottom of the sea, such as ooze, sand, gravel, and other matter;\r\nbut not a particle of sand or gravel was found among them. Hence the\r\ninference that these depths of the sea are not disturbed by either\r\nwaves or currents. Consequently, a telegraphic wire once laid there\r\nwould remain as completely beyond the reach of accident as it would be\r\nif buried in air-tight cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEROIC DEATH OF LIEUTENANT HERNDON.\r\n\r\n(_From Maury's Report, in Mrs. Corbin's Life of Maury._[15])\r\n\r\n    U. S. NATIONAL OBSERVATORY,\r\n        WASHINGTON, D. C., _October 19th, 1857_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On the 12th day of September last, at sea, the U. S. mail\r\nsteamship \"Central America,\" with the California mails, many of the\r\npassengers and crew, and a large amount of treasure on board,\r\nfoundered in a gale [off Cape Hatteras]. The law requires the vessels\r\nof this line to be commanded by officers of the Navy, and Commander\r\nWilliam Lewis Herndon had this one. He went down with his ship,\r\nleaving a glowing example of devotion to duty, Christian conduct, and\r\ntrue heroism. . . . .\r\n\r\nThe \"Central America,\" at the time of her loss, was bound from\r\nAspinwall, viâ Havana, to New York. She had on board, as nearly as has\r\nbeen ascertained, about two millions in gold, and 474 passengers,\r\nbesides a crew, all told, of 101 souls--total, 575.\r\n\r\nShe touched at Havana on the 7th September last, and put to sea again\r\nat nine o'clock on the morning of the 8th. The ship was apparently in\r\ngood order, the time seemed propitious, and all hands were in fine\r\nhealth and spirits, for the prospects of a safe and speedy passage\r\nhome were very cheering. The breeze was from the trade winds quarter\r\nat N. E.; but at midnight on the 9th it freshened to a gale, which\r\ncontinued to increase till the forenoon of Friday, September 11th,\r\nwhen it blew with great violence. . .\r\n\r\nUp to this time the ship behaved admirably; nothing had occurred\r\nworthy of note, or in any way calculated to excite suspicions of her\r\nprowess, until the forenoon of that day, when it was discovered that\r\nshe had sprung a leak. The sea was running high: . . . the leak was so\r\nlarge that by 1 P. M. the water had risen high enough to extinguish\r\nthe fires on one side and stop the engine. . . . Crew and passengers\r\nworked manfully, pumping and baling all Friday afternoon and night,\r\nand when day dawned upon them the violence of the storm was still\r\nincreasing. . . . The flag was hoisted union down, that every vessel\r\nas she hove in sight might know they were in distress and wanted\r\nhelp. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nFinally, about noon of Saturday the 12th, the gale began to abate and\r\nthe sky to brighten. . . . At about 2 P. M. the brig \"Marine,\" Captain\r\nBurt, of Boston, bound from the West Indies to New York, heard\r\nminute-guns, and saw the steamer's signals of distress. She ran down\r\nto the sinking ship, and though very much crippled herself by the\r\ngale, promised to lay by. . . . The steamer's boats were ordered to be\r\nlowered--the \"Marine\" had none that could live in such a sea. . . .\r\nAll the women and children were first sent to the brig, and every one\r\narrived there in safety. Each boat made two loads to the brig,\r\ncarrying in all 100 persons.\r\n\r\nBy this time night was setting in. The brig had drifted to leeward\r\nseveral miles away from the steamer; and was so crippled that she\r\ncould not beat up to her again.\r\n\r\nBlack's (the boatswain) boat alone returned the second time. Her\r\ngallant crew had been buffeting with the storm for two days and\r\nnights without rest, and with little or no food. The boat itself had\r\nbeen badly stove while alongside with the last load of passengers. She\r\nwas so much knocked to pieces as to be really unserviceable, nor could\r\nshe have held another person. Still those brave seamen, inspired by\r\nthe conduct and true to the trust imposed in them by their Captain,\r\ndid not hesitate to leave the brig again, and pull back through the\r\ndark for miles, across an angry sea, that they might join him in his\r\nsinking ship, and take their chances with the rest. . . . . .\r\n\r\nAs one of the last boats was about to leave the ship, her commander\r\ngave his watch to a passenger with the request that it might be\r\ndelivered to his wife. He wished to charge him with a message for her\r\nalso, but his utterance was choked. \"Tell her----.\" Unable to proceed,\r\nhe bent down his head and buried his face in his hands for a moment as\r\nif in prayer, for he was a devout man and a Christian.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, brief as it was, he endured the great agony; but it\r\nwas over now. . . . He had resolved to go down with his ship. Calm and\r\ncollected, he rose up from that mighty struggle with renewed vigour,\r\nand went with encouraging looks about the duties of the ship as\r\nbefore. . . .\r\n\r\nAfter the boat which bore Mr. Payne--to whom Herndon had entrusted his\r\nwatch--had shoved off, the Captain went to his state-room and put on\r\nhis uniform; . . . . . then walking out, he took his stand on the\r\nwheel-house, holding on to the iron railing with his left hand. A\r\nrocket was sent off, the ship fetched her last lurch, and as she went\r\ndown he uncovered. . . .\r\n\r\nJust before the steamer went down, a row-boat was heard approaching.\r\nHerndon hailed her; it was the boatswain's boat, rowed by \"hard hands\r\nand gentle hearts,\" returning from on board the brig to report her\r\ndisabled condition. If she came alongside she would be engulfed with\r\nthe sinking ship. Herndon ordered her to keep off. She did so, and was\r\nsaved. This, as far as I have been able to learn, was his last order.\r\nForgetful of self, mindful of others, his life was beautiful to the\r\nlast, and in his death he has added a new glory to the annals of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[A handsome monument to his memory stands in the Parade-ground of the\r\nNaval School at Annapolis.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] By permission of Mrs. Corbin.\r\n\r\n[15] By permission of Mrs. Corbin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS.\r\n\r\n~1806=1870.~\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS was born and reared in Charleston, South\r\nCarolina. His early education was limited; he was for a while clerk in\r\na drug-store and then he studied law. But his decided taste for\r\nletters soon induced him to devote his entire time and attention to\r\ntheir cultivation. He wrote rapidly and voluminously, and produced\r\npoems, novels, dramas, histories, biographies, book-reviews,\r\neditorials,--in short, all kinds of writing. He was editor of various\r\njournals at different times, and did all he could to inspire and\r\nfoster a literary taste in his generation. His style shows the effect\r\nof haste and overwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Woodlands, S. C., Home of W. Gilmore Simms.~]\r\n\r\nHis novels dealing with Colonial and Revolutionary subjects are his\r\nbest work. They give us graphic pictures of the struggles that our\r\nforefathers in the South had with the wild beasts, swamps, forests,\r\nand Indians in Colonial times, and with these and the British in the\r\nRevolutionary period. They should be read in connection with our early\r\nhistory, especially the following: _Yemassee_, (_1714, Colonial\r\ntimes_); _Partisan_, _Mellichampe_, and _Katharine Walton_, (_forming\r\nthe Revolutionary Trilogy_); _Eutaw_; _Scout_; _Forayers_;\r\n_Woodcraft_, (_1775-1783_); _Wigwam and Cabin_ (_a collection of short\r\nstories_).\r\n\r\nSome of his poems are well worth reading, especially the legends of\r\nIndian and Colonial life; and the Spirits' songs in \"Atalantis\" are\r\nvery dainty and musical.\r\n\r\nHe was the friend and helper of his younger fellow-workers in\r\nliterature, among whom were notably Paul Hamilton Hayne and Henry\r\nTimrod. At his country home \"Woodlands\" and in Charleston, he\r\ndispensed a generous and delightful hospitality and made welcome his\r\nmany friends from North, South, and West. The last few years of his\r\nlife were darkened by distress and poverty, in common with his\r\nbrethren all over the South; and his heroic struggle against them\r\nreminds us of that of Sir Walter Scott, though far more dire and\r\npathetic.\r\n\r\nA fine bust of him by Ward adorns the Battery in his native and\r\nmuch-loved city.

The _totem_ of his tribe, an\r\n    arrow branded upon the shoulder, is to be cut and burnt\r\n    out by the executioner, Malatchie, and he is to be\r\n    declared accursed from his tribe and from their paradise\r\n    forever, \"a slave of Opitchi-Manneyto,\" the evil\r\n    spirit.]\r\n\r\nOcconestoga's head sank in despair, as he beheld the unchanging look\r\nof stern resolve with which the unbending sire regarded him. For a\r\nmoment he was unmanned; until a loud shout of derision from the crowd\r\nas they beheld the show of his weakness, came to the support of his\r\npride. The Indian shrinks from humiliation, where he would not shrink\r\nfrom death; and, as the shout reached his ears, he shouted back his\r\ndefiance, raised his head loftily in air, and with the most perfect\r\ncomposure, commenced singing his song of death, the song of many\r\nvictories.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore sings he his death-song?\" was the cry from many\r\nvoices,--\"he is not to die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou art the slave of Opitchi-Manneyto,\" cried Malatchie to the\r\ncaptive, \"thou shalt sing no lie of thy victories in the ear of\r\nYemassee. The slave of Opitchi-Manneyto has no triumph\"--and the words\r\nof the song were effectually drowned, if not silenced, in the\r\ntremendous clamor which they raised about him. It was then that\r\nMalatchie claimed his victim--the doom had been already given, but the\r\nceremony of expatriation and outlawry was yet to follow, and under the\r\ndirection of the prophet, the various castes and classes of the nation\r\nprepared to take a final leave of one who could no longer be known\r\namong them. First of all came a band of young marriageable women, who,\r\nwheeling in a circle three times about him, sang together a wild\r\napostrophe containing a bitter farewell, which nothing in our language\r\ncould perfectly embody.\r\n\r\n\"Go,--thou hast no wife in Yemassee,--thou hast given no lodge to the\r\ndaughter of Yemassee,--thou hast slain no meat for thy children. Thou\r\nhast no name--the women of Yemassee know thee no more. They know thee\r\nno more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the final sentence was reverberated from the entire assembly,\r\n\"They know thee no more, they know thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nThen came a number of the ancient men,--the patriarchs of the nation,\r\nwho surrounded him in circular mazes three several times, singing as\r\nthey did so a hymn of like import.\r\n\r\n\"Go--thou sittest not in the council of Yemassee--thou shalt not\r\nspeak wisdom to the boy that comes. Thou hast no name in Yemassee--the\r\nfathers of Yemassee, they know thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the whole assembly cried out, as with one voice, \"They know\r\nthee no more, they know thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nThese were followed by the young warriors, his old associates, who\r\nnow, in a solemn band, approached him to go through a like\r\nperformance. His eyes were shut as they came, his blood was chilled in\r\nhis heart, and the articulated farewell of their wild chant failed\r\nseemingly to reach his ear. Nothing but the last sentence he heard--\r\n\r\n    \"Thou that wast a brother,\r\n    Thou art nothing now,\r\n    The young warriors of Yemassee,\r\n    They know thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the crowd cried with them, \"They know thee no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is no hatchet sharp for Occonestoga?\" moaned forth the suffering\r\nsavage. But his trials were only then begun. Enoree-Mattee now\r\napproached him with the words, with which, as the representative of\r\nthe good Manneyto, he renounced him,--with which he denied him access\r\nto the Indian heaven, and left him a slave and an outcast, a miserable\r\nwanderer amid the shadows and the swamps, and liable to all the doom\r\nand terrors which come with the service of Opitchi-Manneyto.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou wast the child of Manneyto,\"\r\n\r\nsung the high priest in a solemn chant, and with a deep-toned voice\r\nthat thrilled strangely amid the silence of the scene,\r\n\r\n    \"Thou wast the child of Manneyto\r\n    He gave thee arrows and an eye,--\r\n    Thou wast the strong son of Manneyto,\r\n    He gave thee feathers and a wing,--\r\n    Thou wast a young brave of Manneyto,\r\n    He gave thee scalps and a war-song,--\r\n    But he knows thee no more--he knows thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the clustering multitude again gave back the last line in wild\r\nchorus. The prophet continued his chant:\r\n\r\n    \"That Opitchi-Manneyto!--\r\n    He commands thee for his slave--\r\n    And the Yemassee must hear him,\r\n    Hear, and give thee for his slave--\r\n    They will take from thee the arrow,\r\n    The broad arrow of thy people,--\r\n    Thou shalt see no blessed valley,\r\n    Where the plum-groves always bloom--\r\n    Thou shalt hear no songs of valour,\r\n    From the ancient Yemassee--\r\n    Father, mother, name, and people,\r\n    Thou shalt lose with that broad arrow,\r\n    Thou art lost to the Manneyto,--\r\n    He knows thee no more--he knows thee no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe despair of hell was in the face of the victim, and he howled\r\nforth, in a cry of agony that for a moment silenced the wild chorus of\r\nthe crowd around, the terrible consciousness in his mind of that\r\nprivation which the doom entailed upon him. Every feature was\r\nconvulsed with emotion; and the terrors of Opitchi-Manneyto's dominion\r\nseemed already in strong exercise upon the muscles of his heart, when\r\nSanutee, the father, silently approached him, and with a pause of a\r\nfew moments, stood gazing upon the son from whom he was to be\r\nseparated eternally-- . . .\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nIn a loud and bitter voice he exclaimed, \"Thy father knows thee no\r\nmore,\"--and once more came to the ears of the victim the melancholy\r\nchorus of the multitude--\"He knows thee no more, he knows thee no\r\nmore.\" Sanutee turned quickly away as he had spoken; and as if he\r\nsuffered more than he was willing to show, the old man rapidly\r\nhastened to the little mound where he had been previously sitting, his\r\neyes averted from the further spectacle. Occonestoga, goaded to\r\nmadness by these several incidents, shrieked forth the bitterest\r\nexecrations, until Enoree-Mattee, preceding Malatchie, again\r\napproached. Having given some directions in an under-tone to the\r\nlatter, he retired, leaving the executioner alone with his victim.\r\nMalatchie, then, while all was silence in the crowd,--a thick silence,\r\nin which even respiration seemed to be suspended,--proceeded to his\r\nduty; and, lifting the feet of Occonestoga carefully from the ground,\r\nhe placed a log under them--then addressing him, as he again bared his\r\nknife which he stuck in the tree above his head, he sung--\r\n\r\n    \"I take from thee the earth of Yemassee--\r\n    I take from thee the water of Yemassee--\r\n    I take from thee the arrow of Yemassee--\r\n    Thou art no longer a Yemassee--\r\n    The Yemassee knows thee no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Yemassee knows thee no more,\" cried the multitude, and their\r\nuniversal shout was deafening upon the ear. Occonestoga said no word\r\nnow--he could offer no resistance to the unnerving hands of Malatchie,\r\nwho now bared the arm more completely of its covering. But his limbs\r\nwere convulsed with the spasms of that dreadful terror of the future\r\nwhich was racking and raging in every pulse of his heart. He had full\r\nfaith in the superstitions of his people. His terrors acknowledged\r\nthe full horrors of their doom. A despairing agony which no language\r\ncould describe had possession of his soul.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the silence of all indicated the general anxiety; and\r\nMalatchie prepared to seize the knife and perform the operation, when\r\na confused murmur arose from the crowd around; the mass gave way and\r\nparted, and, rushing wildly into the area, came Matiwan, his mother,\r\nthe long black hair streaming, the features, an astonishing likeness\r\nto his own, convulsed like his; and her action that of one reckless of\r\nall things in the way of the forward progress she was making to the\r\nperson of her child. She cried aloud as she came, with a voice that\r\nrang like a sudden death-bell through the ring.\r\n\r\n\"Would you keep a mother from her boy, and he to be lost to her for\r\never? Shall she have no parting with the young brave she bore in her\r\nbosom? Away, keep me not back--I will look upon him, I will love him.\r\nHe shall have the blessing of Matiwan, though the Yemassee and the\r\nManneyto curse.\"\r\n\r\nThe victim heard, and a momentary renovation of mental life, perhaps a\r\nrenovation of hope, spoke out in the simple exclamation which fell\r\nfrom his lips:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Matiwan--oh, mother!\"\r\n\r\nShe rushed towards the spot where she heard his appeal, and thrusting\r\nthe executioner aside, threw her arms desperately about his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Touch him not, Matiwan,\" was the general cry from the crowd; \"touch\r\nhim not, Matiwan,--Manneyto knows him no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Matiwan knows him--the mother knows her child, though Manneyto\r\ndenies him. Oh, boy--oh, boy, boy, boy.\" And she sobbed like an infant\r\non his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Thou art come, Matiwan--thou art come, but wherefore? To curse, like\r\nthe father--to curse, like the Manneyto?\" mournfully said the captive.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no! Not to curse, not to curse. When did mother curse the\r\nchild she bore? Not to curse, but to bless thee. To bless thee and\r\nforgive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tear her away,\" cried the prophet; \"let Opitchi-Manneyto have his\r\nslave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tear her away, Malatchie,\" cried the crowd, now impatient for the\r\nexecution. Malatchie approached.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, not yet,\" appealed the woman. \"Shall not the mother say\r\nfarewell to the child she shall see no more?\" and she waved Malatchie\r\nback, and in the next instant drew hastily from the drapery of her\r\ndress a small hatchet, which she had there carefully concealed.\r\n\r\n\"What wouldst thou do, Matiwan?\" asked Occonestoga, as his eye caught\r\nthe glare of the weapon.\r\n\r\n\"Save thee, my boy--save thee for thy mother, Occonestoga--save thee\r\nfor the happy valley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldst thou slay me, mother, wouldst strike the heart of thy son?\"\r\nhe asked, with a something of reluctance to receive death from the\r\nhands of a parent.\r\n\r\n\"I strike thee but to save thee, my son; since they cannot take the\r\ntotem from thee after the life is gone. Turn away from me thy\r\nhead--let me not look upon thine eyes as I strike, lest my hands grow\r\nweak and tremble. Turn thine eyes away; I will not lose thee.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes closed, and the fatal instrument, lifted above her head, was\r\nnow visible in the sight of all. The executioner rushed forward to\r\ninterpose, but he came too late. The tomahawk was driven deep into the\r\nskull, and but a single sentence from his lips preceded the final\r\ninsensibility of the victim.\r\n\r\n\"It is good, Matiwan, it is good; thou hast saved me; the death is in\r\nmy heart.\" And back he sank as he spoke, while a shriek of mingled joy\r\nand horror from the lips of the mother announced the success of her\r\neffort to defeat the doom, the most dreadful in the imagination of the\r\nYemassee.\r\n\r\n\"He is not lost, he is not lost. They may not take the child from his\r\nmother. They may not keep him from the valley of Manneyto. He is\r\nfree--he is free.\" And she fell back in a deep swoon into the arms of\r\nSanutee, who by this time had approached. She had defrauded\r\nOpitchi-Manneyto of his victim, for they may not remove the badge of\r\nthe nation from any but the living victim.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION.\r\n\r\n\"_The Swamp Fox._\"\r\n\r\n(_From the Partisan._)\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    We follow where the Swamp Fox guides,\r\n      His friends and merry men are we;\r\n    And when the troop of Tarleton rides,\r\n      We burrow in the cypress tree.\r\n    The turfy hammock is our bed,\r\n      Our home is in the red deer's den,\r\n    Our roof, the tree-top overhead,\r\n      For we are wild and hunted men.\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    We fly by day, and shun its light,\r\n      But, prompt to strike the sudden blow,\r\n    We mount and start with early night,\r\n      And through the forest track our foe.\r\n    And soon he hears our chargers leap,\r\n      The flashing sabre blinds his eyes,\r\n    And ere he drives away his sleep,\r\n      And rushes from his camp, he dies.\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    Free bridle-bit, good gallant steed,\r\n      That will not ask a kind caress,\r\n    To swim the Santee at our need,\r\n      When on his heels the foemen press,--\r\n    The true heart and the ready hand,\r\n      The spirit stubborn to be free,\r\n    The twisted bore, the smiting brand,--\r\n      And we are Marion's men, you see.\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n    Now light the fire, and cook the meal,\r\n      The last perhaps that we shall taste;\r\n    I hear the Swamp Fox round us steal,\r\n      And that's a sign we move in haste.\r\n    He whistles to the scouts, and hark!\r\n      You hear his order calm and low--\r\n    Come, wave your torch across the dark,\r\n      And let us see the boys that go.\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n    We may not see their forms again,\r\n      God help 'em, should they find the strife!\r\n    For they are strong and fearless men,\r\n      And make no coward terms for life;\r\n    They'll fight as long as Marion bids,\r\n      And when he speaks the word to shy,\r\n    Then--not till then--they turn their steeds,\r\n      Through thickening shade and swamp to fly.\r\n\r\n    VI.\r\n\r\n    Now stir the fire, and lie at ease,\r\n      The scouts are gone, and on the brush\r\n    I see the colonel bend his knees,\r\n      To take his slumbers too--but hush!\r\n    He's praying, comrades; 'tis not strange;\r\n      The man that's fighting day by day,\r\n    May well, when night comes, take a change,\r\n      And down upon his knees to pray.\r\n\r\n    VII.\r\n\r\n    Break up that hoe-cake, boys, and hand\r\n      The sly and silent jug that's there;\r\n    I love not it should idly stand,\r\n      When Marion's men have need of cheer.\r\n    'Tis seldom that our luck affords\r\n      A stuff like this we just have quaffed,\r\n    And dry potatoes on our boards\r\n      May always call for such a draught.\r\n\r\n    VIII.\r\n\r\n    Now pile the brush and roll the log;\r\n      Hard pillow, but a soldier's head\r\n    That's half the time in brake and bog\r\n      Must never think of softer bed.\r\n    The owl is hooting to the night,\r\n      The cooter crawling o'er the bank,\r\n    And in that pond the flashing light\r\n      Tells where the alligator sank.\r\n\r\n    IX.\r\n\r\n    What!

He was\r\neducated as a soldier at West Point, served with great distinction\r\nunder General Scott in the Mexican War, and commanded the troops which\r\nsuppressed the John Brown Raid in 1859. When his State seceded in\r\n1861, he resigned his commission of Colonel in the United States Army,\r\nand returned to Virginia. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the\r\nVirginia forces, and later of the Confederate Army. His course during\r\nthe war has elicited the praise and admiration of all military\r\ncritics. After the war he quietly turned to the duties of a citizen.\r\nHe became president of Washington College, which is now called in his\r\nhonor Washington and Lee University. He stands with Washington a model\r\nfor young men, and many monuments in marble and bronze attest the love\r\nand devotion of the South to her great Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    _Edited_ his father's Memoirs of the Revolution.\r\n    Letters and Addresses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee was a soldier and a man who acted rather than spoke or\r\nwrote.

Its\r\nsimplicity reminds us of Washington.\r\n\r\nHis life has been written by John Esten Cooke, John William Jones,\r\nJ. D.

I need not tell the survivors\r\nof so many hard-fought battles, who have remained steadfast to the\r\nlast, that I have consented to this result from no distrust of them;\r\nbut, feeling that valor and devotion could accomplish nothing that\r\nwould compensate for the loss that would have attended the\r\ncontinuation of the contest, I have determined to avoid the useless\r\nsacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their\r\ncountrymen. By the terms of the agreement, officers and men can return\r\nto their homes, and remain there until exchanged.\r\n\r\nYou will take with you _the satisfaction that proceeds from the\r\nconsciousness of duty faithfully performed_; and I earnestly pray that\r\na merciful God will extend to you his blessing and protection. With an\r\nunceasing admiration of your constancy and devotion to your country,\r\nand a grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration of\r\nmyself, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Va.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER ACCEPTING THE PRESIDENCY OF WASHINGTON COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n    POWHATAN COUNTY, _August 24, 1865_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--I have delayed for some days replying to your letter of\r\nthe 5th instant informing me of my election, by the board of Trustees,\r\nto the Presidency of Washington College, from a desire to give the\r\nsubject due consideration. Fully impressed with the responsibilities\r\nof the office, I have feared that I should be unable to discharge its\r\nduties to the satisfaction of the Trustees, or to the benefit of the\r\ncountry. The proper education of youth requires not only great\r\nability, but, I fear, more strength than I now possess; for I do not\r\nfeel able to undergo the labor of conducting classes in regular\r\ncourses of instruction. I could not, therefore, undertake more than\r\nthe general administration and supervision of the institution.\r\n\r\nThere is another subject which has caused me serious reflection, and\r\nis, I think, worthy of the consideration of the Board. Being excluded\r\nfrom the terms of amnesty in the proclamation of the United States of\r\nthe 29th of May last, and an object of censure to a portion of the\r\ncountry, I have thought it probable that my occupation of the position\r\nof president might draw upon the college a feeling of hostility, and I\r\nshould therefore cause injury to an institution which it would be my\r\nhighest object to advance.\r\n\r\nI think it the duty of every citizen, in the present condition of the\r\ncountry, to do all in his power to aid in the restoration of peace and\r\nharmony, and in no way to oppose the policy of the State or general\r\nGovernment directed to that object. It is particularly incumbent on\r\nthose charged with the instruction of the young to set them an example\r\nof submission to authority, and I could not consent to be the cause\r\nof animadversion upon the college. Should you, however, take a\r\ndifferent view, and think that my services, in the position tendered\r\nme by the Board, will be advantageous to the college and the country,\r\nI will yield to your judgment and accept it; otherwise I must most\r\nrespectfully decline the offer.\r\n\r\nBegging you to express to the Trustees of the college my heartfelt\r\ngratitude for the honor conferred upon me, and requesting you to\r\naccept my cordial thanks for the kind manner in which you have\r\ncommunicated its decision, I am, gentlemen, your most obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n                    R. E. LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS.\r\n\r\n~1808=1889.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON DAVIS, President of the Confederate States, was born in Todd\r\nCounty, Kentucky, but his father removed to Mississippi soon\r\nafterwards, and he was reared and partly educated in that state. Later\r\nhe attended Transylvania University in Kentucky, and in 1824 entered\r\nWest Point. He was graduated in 1828 and served seven years in the\r\narmy, being stationed in Missouri and Minnesota. On account of\r\nill-health he resigned in 1835 and travelled, and then settled on his\r\nMississippi plantation, \"Brierfield.\"\r\n\r\nHe was elected to Congress in 1845; served in the Mexican War with\r\ngreat distinction and was injured in eye and limb at the battle of\r\nBuena Vista. He was Secretary of War in President Pierce's cabinet,\r\nand was a Senator when Mississippi seceded from the Union.\r\n\r\nHe made his farewell to the Senate in January, 1861, and returned home\r\nwhere he was at once appointed commander of the State troops. But he\r\nhad been elected president of the new Confederacy by the Convention at\r\nMontgomery, and he was inaugurated, February 18, 1861. On the change\r\nof the capital from Montgomery to Richmond, he removed to the latter\r\ncity and remained there until the war was ended.\r\n\r\nHe was imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe, to be tried as a\r\ntraitor to the United States. Being finally released on bail, he went\r\nfor his health to England and Canada; and then he resided in Memphis\r\nand at \"Beauvoir,\" Mississippi, which latter place was his home when\r\nhe died. This home, \"Beauvoir,\" he had arranged to purchase from Mrs.\r\nDorsey, who was a kind and devoted friend to his family and had\r\nassisted him in his writing; but on her death in 1879, it was found\r\nthat she had left a will bequeathing it to him and to his daughter\r\nVarina Anne. He, like Lee, had always declined the many offers of\r\nhomes and incomes made by their devoted and admiring friends.\r\n\r\nOn him, as President of the Confederacy, seems to have fallen in some\r\nsense the whole odium of the failure of that cause; and this passage\r\nfrom Winnie Davis' \"An Irish Knight\" has a touching application to his\r\ncase: \"Thus died Ireland's true knight, sinking into the grave clothed\r\nin all the bright promise of his youth; never to put on the sad livery\r\nof age; never to feel the hopelessness of those who live to see the\r\nprinciples for which they suffered trampled and forgotten by the\r\nonward march of new interests and new men. Perhaps Freedom like some\r\ndeity of ancient Greece, loved him too well to let the slurs and\r\ncontumely of outrageous fortune dim the bright lustre of his virgin\r\nfame.\" He is enshrined in the hearts of thousands.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, Varina Anne, or Winnie, \"the Child of the Confederacy,\"\r\nas she is lovingly called, is a writer of some ability. She was\r\neducated in Europe, and has written \"An Irish Knight\" [story of Robert\r\nEmmet], and articles for magazines. Mrs. Jefferson Davis' Life of Mr.\r\nDavis is a work of rare excellence and interest. See also _Davis\r\nMemorial Volume_, by J. Wm.

When we reached Nashville we went to the Hermitage. Major Hinds\r\nwished to visit his friend and companion-in-arms, General Jackson. The\r\nwhole party was so kindly received that we remained there for several\r\nweeks. During that period I had the opportunity a boy has to observe a\r\ngreat man--a stand-point of no small advantage--and I have always\r\nremembered with warm affection the kind and tender wife who then\r\npresided over his house.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson's house at that time was a roomy log-house. In front\r\nof it was a grove of fine forest trees, and behind it were his cotton\r\nand grain fields. I have never forgotten the unaffected and well-bred\r\ncourtesy which caused him to be remarked by court-trained diplomats,\r\nwhen President of the United States, by reason of his very impressive\r\nbearing and manner.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many reports that have been made of his profanity,\r\nI remember that he always said grace at his table, and I never heard\r\nhim utter an oath. In the same connection, although he encouraged his\r\nadopted son, A. Jackson, Jr., Howell Hinds, and myself in all contests\r\nof activity, pony-riding included, he would not allow us to wrestle;\r\nfor, he said, to allow hands to be put on one another might lead to a\r\nfight. He was always very gentle and considerate. . . .\r\n\r\nOur stay with General Jackson was enlivened by the visits of his\r\nneighbors, and we left the Hermitage with great regret and pursued our\r\njourney. In me he inspired reverence and affection that has remained\r\nwith me through my whole life.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThose who have intimately known the official and personal life of our\r\nPresidents cannot fail to remember how few have left the office as\r\nhappy men as when they entered it, how darkly the shadows gathered\r\naround the setting sun, and how eagerly the multitude would turn to\r\ngaze upon another orb just rising to take its place in the political\r\nfirmament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Beauvoir.~]\r\n\r\nWorn by incessant fatigue, broken in fortune, debarred by public\r\nopinion, prejudice, or tradition, from future employment, the wisest\r\nand best who have filled that office have retired to private life, to\r\nremember rather the failure of their hopes than the success of their\r\nefforts. He must, indeed, be a self-confident man who could hope to\r\nfill the chair of Washington with satisfaction to himself, with\r\nassurance of receiving on his retirement the meed awarded by the\r\npeople to that great man, that he had \"done enough for life and for\r\nglory,\" or even feeling that the sacrifice of self had been\r\ncompensated by the service rendered to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL TO THE SENATE, 1861, ON THE OCCASION OF THE SECESSION OF\r\nMISSISSIPPI FROM THE UNION.\r\n\r\nI rise, Mr. President, for the purpose of announcing to the Senate\r\nthat I have satisfactory evidence that the state of Mississippi, by a\r\nsolemn ordinance of her people, in convention assembled, has declared\r\nher separation from the United States. Under these circumstances, of\r\ncourse, my functions are terminated here. It has seemed to me proper,\r\nhowever, that I should appear in the Senate to announce that fact to\r\nmy associates, and I will say but very little more. The occasion does\r\nnot invite me to go into argument, and my physical condition would not\r\npermit me to do so, if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become\r\nme to say something on the part of the State I here represent on an\r\noccasion so solemn as this.\r\n\r\nIt is known to Senators who have served with me here that I have for\r\nmany years advocated, as an essential attribute of State sovereignty,\r\nthe right of a State to secede from the Union. Therefore, if I had not\r\nbelieved there was justifiable cause, if I had thought that\r\nMississippi was acting without sufficient provocation, or without an\r\nexisting necessity, I should still, under my theory of the\r\ngovernment, because of my allegiance to the State of which I am a\r\ncitizen, have been bound by her action. I, however, may be permitted\r\nto say that I do think she has justifiable cause, and I approve of her\r\nact. I conferred with her people before that act was taken, counselled\r\nthem then that, if the state of things which they apprehended should\r\nexist when their convention met, they should take the action which\r\nthey have now adopted.\r\n\r\nI hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine with the\r\nadvocacy of the right of a State to remain in the Union, and to\r\ndisregard its constitutional obligations by the nullification of the\r\nlaw. Such is not my theory. Nullification and Secession, so often\r\nconfounded, are, indeed, antagonistic principles. Nullification is a\r\nremedy which it is sought to apply within the Union, and against the\r\nagent of the States. It is only to be justified when the agent has\r\nviolated his constitutional obligations, and a State, assuming to\r\njudge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and\r\nappeals to the other States of the Union for a decision; but when the\r\nStates themselves, and the people of the States have so acted as to\r\nconvince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then,\r\nand then for the first time, arises the doctrine of secession in its\r\npractical application.\r\n\r\nA great man, who now reposes with his fathers, and who has often been\r\narraigned for a want of fealty to the Union, advocated the doctrine of\r\nnullification because it preserved the Union. It was because of his\r\ndeep-seated attachment to the Union--his determination to find some\r\nremedy for existing ills short of a severance of the ties which bound\r\nSouth Carolina to the other States--that Mr. Calhoun advocated the\r\ndoctrine of nullification, which he proclaimed to be peaceful, to be\r\nwithin the limits of State power, not to disturb the Union, but only\r\nto be the means of bringing the agent before the tribunal of the\r\nStates for their judgment.\r\n\r\nSecession belongs to a different class of remedies. It is to be\r\njustified upon the basis that the States are sovereign. There was a\r\ntime when none denied it. I hope the time may come again when a better\r\ncomprehension of the theory of our Government, and the inalienable\r\nrights of the people of the States, will prevent any one from denying\r\nthat each State is a sovereign, and thus may reclaim the grants which\r\nit has made to any agent whomsoever. . .\r\n\r\nIn the course of my service here, associated at different times with a\r\ngreat variety of Senators, I see now around me some with whom I have\r\nserved long; there have been points of collision, but, whatever of\r\noffence there has been to me, I leave here. I carry with me no hostile\r\nremembrance. Whatever offence I have given which has not been\r\nredressed, or for which satisfaction has not been demanded, I have,\r\nSenators, in this hour of our parting, to offer you my apology for any\r\npain which, in the heat of the discussion, I have inflicted. I go\r\nhence unencumbered by the remembrance of any injury received, and\r\nhaving discharged the duty of making the only reparation in my power\r\nfor any injury offered.\r\n\r\nMr. President and Senators, having made the announcement which the\r\noccasion seemed to me to require, it only remains for me to bid you a\r\nfinal adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[16] By Permission of Mrs. Davis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGAR ALLAN POE.\r\n\r\n~1809=1849.~\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGAR ALLAN POE was born in Boston while his parents were filling a\r\ntheatrical engagement there. His father's family was of Baltimore, his\r\ngrandfather being Gen. David Poe of the Revolutionary War, and his\r\nfather, also named David Poe, having been born and reared in that\r\ncity. His mother, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Arnold, was an\r\nEnglish actress of fascinating beauty and manners.\r\n\r\nLeft an orphan in 1811, Edgar was adopted by Mr. John Allan, a wealthy\r\nmerchant of Richmond, and was educated at private schools and the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, and in 1830 he entered West Point. But he got\r\nhimself dismissed the next year and devoted himself thereafter to a\r\nliterary life. Mr. Allan declining to aid him further, he had a\r\nwretched struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have gone to Baltimore and made acquaintance with some of\r\nhis relatives; and there he won a prize of $100 by a story, \"MS. Found\r\nin a Bottle,\" and was kindly helped by John Pendleton Kennedy. He\r\nbecame editor of the \"Southern Literary Messenger,\" in Richmond, and\r\nwas afterward engaged on various other magazines, writing stories,\r\npoems, book-reviews, and paragraphs, in untiring abundance.\r\n\r\nHe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in 1836, and their life\r\ntogether was in itself ideally happy, like the life in the Valley of\r\nthe Many-Coloured Grass; and Mrs. Clemm, his aunt and mother-in-law,\r\nwas the good genius who watched over \"her two strange children\" with\r\nan unwearying devotion, deserving the tribute of the love and\r\ngratitude embalmed in his sonnet called \"Mother.\"\r\n\r\nHis engagement with any one magazine rarely lasted long, and there is\r\nmuch diversity of opinion as to the cause; some ascribing it to Poe's\r\ndissipated, irregular habits and irritable temper, others to the\r\nmeagre support of the magazines, still others to Poe's restless\r\ndisposition and desire to establish a periodical of his own. His\r\nuncontrolled and high-strung nature, so sensitive that a single glass\r\nof wine or swallow of opium caused temporary insanity, the\r\nuncertainty of his means of subsistence, his wife's frail health and\r\nher death in 1847, were causes sufficient to render unsteady even a\r\nmore solid character than Poe seems to have possessed.\r\n\r\nHis writings produced a great sensation. When \"The Raven\" was\r\npublished in 1845, a friend said of its effect in New York, \"Everybody\r\nhas been raven-mad about his last poem.\" Mrs. Browning wrote that an\r\nacquaintance of hers who had a bust of Pallas could not bear to look\r\nat it. His fame is as great, or perhaps greater in Europe than in\r\nAmerica, especially in France; and his works have been translated into\r\nFrench, German, Italian, Spanish, and Russian.\r\n\r\nHe died in Baltimore from causes never certainly known, his last\r\nalmost unconscious days being spent in a hospital; his dying words\r\nwere, \"Lord, help my poor soul.\" He is buried in Westminster\r\nchurchyard, and in 1875 a monument was erected over his grave by the\r\nteachers of Baltimore, generously aided by Mr. G. W. Childs of\r\nPhiladelphia. A memorial to him has been placed in the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum, New York, by the actors of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo poet has been the subject of more conflicting opinions as to his\r\nlife, habits, character, and genius, than Poe.

curious volume of forgotten lore,\r\n    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\n    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\r\n    \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\r\n                      Only this, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\r\n    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\n    Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\r\n    From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\r\n    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n                      Nameless here for evermore.\r\n\r\n    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n    Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\n    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\r\n    \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\r\n    Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,--\r\n                      This it is, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n    \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\n    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\n    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\r\n    That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door;\r\n                      Darkness there, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,\r\n        fearing,\r\n    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\r\n    But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\r\n    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore.\"\r\n    This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\r\n                      Merely this, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\n    Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\r\n    \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\r\n    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\r\n    Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--\r\n                      'Tis the wind and nothing more!\"\r\n\r\n    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\n    In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\r\n    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\r\n    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\r\n    Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\r\n                      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\n    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n    \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\r\n        craven,\r\n    Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore,\r\n    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\r\n                      Quoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\n    Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\r\n    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\r\n    Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n                      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\r\n    That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\n    Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\r\n    Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before.\r\n    On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\r\n                      Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n    \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store\r\n    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\r\n    Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n                      Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\r\n\r\n    But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\n    Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;\r\n    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\n    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\r\n    What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\r\n                      Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\n    To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\r\n    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\n    On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,\r\n    But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,\r\n                      _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\n    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n    Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n    \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\r\n        sent thee\r\n    Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\r\n    Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\r\n                      Quoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\r\n    Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\n    Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\r\n    On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\r\n    Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\r\n                      Quoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\n    By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,\r\n    Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\n    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n    Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\r\n                      Quoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,\r\n        upstarting--\r\n    \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\r\n    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\n    Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\r\n    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\n                      Quoth the raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n    And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\n    On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\n    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\r\n    And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor,\r\n    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n                      Shall be lifted--nevermore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT TOOMBS.\r\n\r\n~1810=1885.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Robert Toombs.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT TOOMBS was born at Washington, Georgia, and studied at the\r\nUniversity of Georgia, then under the presidency of the famous Dr.\r\nMoses Waddell; he afterwards attended Union College, Schenectady,\r\nN. Y., and studied law at the University of Virginia. He settled in\r\nhis native town for legal practice and was so successful as to amass a\r\nfortune within a few years. He served in the State Legislature and in\r\n1845 was elected to Congress. In 1861, being a member of the United\r\nStates Senate, he took leave of it in order to join his State in\r\nsecession. He was appointed to the Confederate Cabinet, but soon\r\nresigned and became a general in the field. After the war he was\r\nordered to be captured and held for trial as a traitor with Jefferson\r\nDavis and Alexander H. Stephens; but he was never taken. He escaped\r\nafter much difficulty and many adventures, and went to Cuba and to\r\nFrance: but he returned in 1867 to Georgia and resumed the practice\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nHe was notoriously the Big Rebel, even after the war, and refused to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance: when asked by a Northern friend why he\r\nhad never sued for pardon, he said, \"Pardon for what? I have not\r\npardoned you all yet.\" Later in life he said that he regretted not\r\nhaving re-instated himself in citizenship and taken part in public\r\naffairs. See his Life, by P. A. Stovall, and by C. C. Jones, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Speeches.\r\n\r\nMr. Toombs' speeches in Congress are said to have been fiery,\r\npowerful, and dogmatic. As a lawyer, Chief-Justice Jackson thus\r\ncharacterizes his style: \"Concentrated fire was always his policy. A\r\nsingle sentence would win his case. A big thought, compressed into\r\nsmall compass, was fatal to his foe. It is the clear insight of a\r\ngreat mind only that shapes out truth in words few and simple. Brevity\r\nis power, wherever thought is strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a regular mythology about Toombs at his State University.\r\nThe things he said would fill a volume of Sydney Smith, while the\r\npranks he played would rival the record of Robin Hood.\"--Stovall's\r\nLife of Toombs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL TO THE SENATE, 1861.\r\n\r\n(_From Stovall's Life of Toombs._[17])\r\n\r\nSenators, my countrymen have demanded no new government. They have\r\ndemanded no new constitution. The discontented States have demanded\r\nnothing but clear, distinct, constitutional rights, rights older than\r\nthe Constitution. What do these rebels demand? First, that the people\r\nof the United States shall have an equal right to emigrate and settle\r\nin the Territories with whatever property (including slaves) they\r\npossess. Second, that property in slaves shall be entitled to the same\r\nprotection from the government as any other property (leaving the\r\nState the right to prohibit, protect, or abolish slavery within its\r\nlimits). Third, that persons committing crimes against slave property\r\nin one State and flying to another shall be given up. Fourth, that\r\nfugitive slaves shall be surrendered. Fifth, that Congress shall pass\r\nlaws for the punishment of all persons who shall aid and abet invasion\r\nand insurrection in any other State. . . . . .\r\n\r\nYou will not regard confederate obligations; you will not regard\r\nconstitutional obligations; you will not regard your oaths. What,\r\nthen, am I to do? Am I a freeman? Is my State a free State? We are\r\nfreemen; we have rights; I have stated them. We have wrongs; I have\r\nrecounted them. I have demonstrated that the party now coming into\r\npower has declared us outlaws, and is determined to exclude thousands\r\nof millions of our property from the common territory; that it has\r\ndeclared us under the ban of the Union, and out of the protection of\r\nthe laws of the United States everywhere. They have refused to protect\r\nus from invasion and insurrection by the Federal power, and the\r\nConstitution denies to us, in the Union, the right to raise fleets and\r\narmies for our own defence. All these charges I have proven by the\r\nrecord; and I put them before the civilized world and demand the\r\njudgment of to-day, of to-morrow, of distant ages, and of Heaven\r\nitself, upon the justice of these causes. I am content, whatever it\r\nbe, to peril all in so holy a cause. We have appealed, time and again,\r\nfor these constitutional rights. You have refused them. We appeal\r\nagain. Restore us those rights as we had them; as your Court adjudges\r\nthem to be; just as our people have said they are. Redress these\r\nflagrant wrongs--seen of all men--and it will restore fraternity, and\r\nunity, and peace to us all. Refuse them, and what then? We shall then\r\nask you, \"Let us depart in peace.\"[18] Refuse that, and you present us\r\nwar. We accept it, and, inscribing upon our banners the glorious\r\nwords, \"Liberty and Equality,\" we will trust to the blood of the brave\r\nand the God of battles for security and tranquility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] By permission of the Cassell Publishing Company, N.

She was a\r\ngranddaughter of George Walton, signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and daughter of George Walton, governor of Florida. She\r\nlearned languages easily and conversed well in French, Spanish, and\r\nItalian. LaFayette said of her: \"A truly wonderful child! She has been\r\nconversing with intelligence and tact in the purest French. I predict\r\nfor her a brilliant career.\" She gave the name to the capital of\r\nFlorida, Tallahassee, a Seminole word meaning \"beautiful land.\" She\r\nspent several seasons in Washington; and she wrote such excellent\r\naccounts of the speeches in Congress, that Calhoun, Webster, and Clay\r\nfrequently asked her to read to them their own speeches from her\r\nportfolio.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 she was married to Dr. Henry S. Le Vert of Mobile and removed\r\nto that city. She travelled in Europe in 1853 and 1855, and her\r\ndelightful journal and letters home were afterwards arranged and\r\npublished as \"Souvenirs of Travel.\" Their spirit and style make them\r\ncharming yet, and they are valuable as pictures of the times.\r\n\r\nHer memory is still fragrant as a most gracious and lovely woman, a\r\nbrilliant conversationalist, and a queen of society.

At first the sky was \"deeply, darkly blue,\" and the stars were\r\ngleaming with a brightness never seen in more northern regions. Slowly\r\na gauzy veil seemed wafting over them, and along the east sprang up,\r\nas it were, banners of purple and rose-color, and the intense azure of\r\nthe heavens melted into a soft gray hue. Soon streaks of golden light\r\nflashed through it, and the glorious sun came forth, converting the\r\nmirror-like ocean into a sea of radiance, burnished and glittering\r\nlike myriads of gems. And this was morning upon the Atlantic!\r\n\r\nAt mid-day there was a cry of _tierra! tierra!_ (land! land!) which\r\nsent a thrill of joy to many hearts. We had seen none, except the\r\nisland of Santa Maria (one of the Azores, near which we passed), since\r\nwe left the Antilles. We ran on deck, and in a few moments\r\n\r\n    \"Fair Cadiz, rising from the dark blue sea,\"\r\n\r\nwas revealed to our longing eyes. Like a great white dove, with\r\nout-spread wings, resting upon the calm waters, appeared the distant\r\ncity. Ah! long shall I remember the delight of that first look upon\r\nlovely Cadiz! The day was exquisite; the air fresh and balmy, and the\r\nsea like a smooth inland lake. Gentle spirits seemed hovering around\r\nto welcome us, while a warm glowing pleasure filled our hearts.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer we approached, domes, spires, and turrets gradually\r\nrising to view, until the entire outline of the city, with its\r\nsnow-white houses and green alamedas, was before us. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nCadiz is a very ancient city. It was founded by the Phoenicians,\r\nhundreds of years before the building of Rome. Upon the coat-of-arms\r\nof the city is the figure of Hercules, by whom the inhabitants say it\r\nwas built. Then came the dominion of the Moors, and afterwards the\r\nSpaniards. When America was discovered, a golden prosperity beamed\r\nupon Cadiz, which was lost as soon as the Spanish Possessions in the\r\nNew World proclaimed themselves free. It is strictly a commercial\r\nplace, and has now only a population of sixty thousand. The city is\r\nupon a rocky point of land, joined to the peninsula by a narrow\r\nisthmus. The sea surrounds it on three sides, beating against the\r\nwalls, and often throwing the spray over the ramparts. On the fourth\r\nside it is protected by a strong wall and bridges over the wide ditch.\r\nAt night, they are drawn up, thus isolating the town completely. . .\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nLeaving the bay, we plunged into the long rolling billows of the\r\nAtlantic, and bade\r\n\r\n    \"Adieu! fair Cadiz, a long adieu!\"\r\n\r\nthen turning the cape, upon which was once the Phoenician\r\nlight-house called \"the Rock of the Sun,\" we came to St. Lucar. There\r\nMagellan fitted out the fleet which first circumnavigated the\r\nglobe. . . . We passed the mouth of the Rio Tinto, upon which stands\r\nthe convent [La Rabida], where Columbus, an outcast and wanderer,\r\nreceived charity from the kind prior, who interceded with Isabella and\r\nthus forwarded the plans of the great discoverer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISA SUSANNAH M'CORD.\r\n\r\n~1810=1880.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. M'CORD, daughter of the distinguished statesman, Langdon Cheves\r\n[pron'd Cheeves, in one syllable], was born at Columbia, South\r\nCarolina. She was educated in Philadelphia; and in 1840 she was\r\nmarried to David James M'Cord, a prominent lawyer of Columbia, at one\r\ntime law-partner of Wm. C. Preston. They spent much of their time at\r\ntheir plantation, \"Langsyne,\" near Fort Motte on the Congaree.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of strong character and of commanding intellect as her\r\nwritings show. Speaking of her home life, a contemporary says, \"Mrs.\r\nM'Cord herself illustrates her views of female life by her own daily\r\nexample. She conducts the hospital on her own large plantation,\r\nattends to the personal wants of the negroes, and on one occasion\r\nperfectly set a fracture of a broken arm. Thoroughly accomplished in\r\nthe modern languages of Europe, she employs her leisure in the\r\neducation of her children.\" See under _Wm. C.

Error is but truth turned\r\nawry, or looked at through a wrong medium. As the straightest rod\r\nwill, in appearance, curve when one half of it is placed under water,\r\nso God's truths, leaning down to earth, are often distorted to our\r\nview. Woman's condition certainly admits of improvement, (but when\r\nhave the strong forgotten to oppress the weak?) . . . Here, as in all\r\nother improvements, the good must be brought about by working with,\r\nnot against--by seconding, not opposing--Nature's laws. Woman, seeking\r\nas a woman, may raise her position,--seeking as a man, we repeat, she\r\nbut degrades it. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nEach can labour, each can strive, lovingly and earnestly, in her own\r\nsphere. \"Life is real! Life is earnest!\" Not less for her than for\r\nman. She has no right to bury her talent beneath silks or ribands,\r\nfrippery or flowers; nor yet has she the right, because she fancies\r\nnot her task, to grasp at another's, which is, or which she imagines\r\nis, easier. This is baby play. \"Life is real! Life is earnest!\" Let\r\nwoman so read it--let woman so learn it--and she has no need to make\r\nher influence felt by a stump speech, or a vote at the polls; she has\r\nno need for the exercise of her intellect (and woman, we grant, may\r\nhave a great, a longing, a hungering intellect, equal to man's) to be\r\ngratified with a seat in Congress, or a scuffle for the ambiguous\r\nhonour of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nEven at her own fire-side, may she find duties enough, cares enough,\r\ntroubles enough, thought enough, wisdom enough, to fit a martyr for\r\nthe stake, a philosopher for life, or a saint for heaven.\r\n\r\nThere are, there have been, and there will be, in every age, great\r\nhero-souls in woman's form, as well as man's. It imports little\r\nwhether history notes them. The hero-soul aims at its certain duty,\r\nheroically meeting it, whether glory or shame, worship or contumely,\r\nfollow its accomplishment. Laud and merit is due to such performance.\r\n_Fulfill_ thy destiny; _oppose_ it not. Herein lies thy track. Keep\r\nit. Nature's sign-posts are within thee, and it were well for thee to\r\nlearn to read them. . . . .\r\n\r\nMany women--even, we grant, the majority of women--throw themselves\r\naway upon follies. So, however, do men; and this, perhaps, as a\r\nnecessary consequence, for woman is the mother of the man. Woman has\r\nallowed herself to be, alternately, made the toy and the slave of man;\r\nbut this rather through her folly than her nature. Not wholly _her_\r\nfolly, either. _Her_ folly and _man's_ folly have made the vices and\r\nthe punishment of both.\r\n\r\nWoman has certainly not her true place, and this place she as\r\ncertainly should seek to gain. We have said that every error has its\r\nshadow of truth, and, so far, the [Woman's Rights] conventionists are\r\nright. But, alas! how wide astray are they groping from their goal!\r\nWoman has not her true place, because she--because man--has not yet\r\nlearned the full extent and importance of her mission. These\r\ninnovators would seek to restore, by driving her entirely from that\r\nmission; as though some unlucky pedestrian, shoved from the security\r\nof the side-walk, should in his consternation seek to remedy matters,\r\nby rushing into the thickest thoroughfare of hoofs and wheels. Woman\r\nwill reach the greatest height of which she is capable--the greatest,\r\nperhaps, of which humanity is capable--not by becoming man, but by\r\nbecoming, more than ever, woman. By perfecting herself, she perfects\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH G. BALDWIN.\r\n\r\n~ca. 1811=1864.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH G. BALDWIN was born in Virginia but early removed to Sumter\r\nCounty, Alabama, and was a jurist and writer of much influence and\r\npopularity in that State. He removed later to California, where in\r\n1857 he became judge of the Supreme Court and in 1863 Chief-Justice of\r\nthe State. His writings are mainly clever and humorous sketches of the\r\nbar and of the communities in which he practised. He said the \"flush\r\ntimes\" of Alabama did not compare in any degree with those of\r\nCalifornia which he described in an article to the \"Southern Literary\r\nMessenger.\" His \"Party Leaders\" are able papers on Jefferson,\r\nHamilton, Jackson, Clay, and John Randolph.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Flush Times in Alabama and Mississippi.\r\n    Party Leaders.\r\n    Humorous Legal Sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIANS IN A NEW COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n(_From Flush Times in Alabama and Mississippi, published in \"Southern\r\nLiterary Messenger.\"_)\r\n\r\nThe disposition to be proud and vain of one's country, and to boast of\r\nit, is a natural feeling; but, with a Virginian, it is a passion. It\r\ninheres in him even as the flavor of a York river oyster in that\r\nbivalve, and no distance of deportation, and no trimmings of a\r\ngracious prosperity, and no pickling in the sharp acids of adversity,\r\ncan destroy it. It is a part of the Virginia character--just as the\r\nflavor is a distinctive part of the oyster--\"which cannot, save by\r\nannihilating, die.\" It is no use talking about it--the thing may be\r\nright, or wrong;--like Falstaff's victims at Gadshill, it is past\r\npraying for: it is a sort of cocoa grass that has got into the soil,\r\nand has so matted over it, and so _fibred_ through it, as to have\r\nbecome a part of it; at least there is no telling which is the grass\r\nand which the soil; and certainly it is useless labor to try to root\r\nit out. You may destroy the soil, but you can't root out the grass.\r\n\r\nPatriotism with the Virginian is a noun personal. It is the Virginian\r\nhimself and something over. He loves Virginia _per se_ and _propter\r\nse_: he loves her for herself and for himself--because _she is_\r\nVirginia, and--everything else beside. He loves to talk about her: out\r\nof the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. It makes no odds\r\nwhere he goes, he carries Virginia with him; not in the entirety\r\nalways--but the little spot he comes from is Virginia--as Swedenborg\r\nsays the smallest part of the brain is an abridgment of all of it.\r\n\"_Coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt_,\" was made for a\r\nVirginian. He never gets acclimated elsewhere; he never loses\r\ncitizenship to the old Home. The right of expatriation is a pure\r\nabstraction to him. He may breathe in Alabama, but he lives in\r\nVirginia. His treasure is there and his heart also. If he looks at the\r\nDelta of the Mississippi, it reminds him of James River \"low grounds;\"\r\nif he sees the vast prairies of Texas, it is a memorial of the meadows\r\nof the Valley. Richmond is the centre of attraction, the _dépôt_ of\r\nall that is grand, great, good, and glorious. \"It is the Kentucky of a\r\nplace,\" which the preacher described Heaven to be to the Kentucky\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nThose who came many years ago from the borough towns, especially from\r\nthe vicinity of Williamsburg, exceed, in attachment to their\r\nbirthplace, if possible, the _émigrés_ from the metropolis. It is\r\nrefreshing in these coster monger times, to hear them speak of\r\nit;--they remember it when the old burg was the seat of fashion,\r\ntaste, refinement, hospitality, wealth, wit, and all social graces:\r\nwhen genius threw its spell over the public assemblages and illumined\r\nthe halls of justice, and when beauty brightened the social hour with\r\nher unmatched and matchless brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS.\r\n\r\n~1812=1883.~\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS was born near Crawfordville, Georgia, and\r\nreceived an early and excellent education in his father's private\r\nschool and at the University of Georgia. The cost of his tuition here\r\nwas advanced by some friends, and he repaid it as soon as he began to\r\nearn money. He taught for a year in the family of Dr. Le Conte, father\r\nof the distinguished scientists, John and Joseph Le Conte, now of the\r\nUniversity of California.\r\n\r\nHe pursued his law studies alone and passed an unusually brilliant\r\nexamination. He was elected to the State Legislature in 1836, and to\r\nCongress in 1843, where he served until 1858. He then retired to\r\ncountry life at his home, \"Liberty Hall.\" But in 1861 he was elected\r\nVice-President of the Confederate States. After the war he was made\r\nprisoner and confined for some months at Fort Warren near Boston. He\r\nspent several years in literary work and established a newspaper at\r\nAtlanta, called the \"Sun.\"\r\n\r\nHe was of small stature and delicate health, and met with one or two\r\nsevere accidents. His career is a wonderful illustration of the power\r\nof the mind over the body. An amusing incident is told of him in\r\nregard to his size. He was attending a political convention in\r\nCharleston as one of the chief delegates; and one evening, with\r\nseveral other prominent men, he was on the porch of the hotel lying on\r\na bench, talking with his companions who were standing about him. The\r\nhotel-keeper coming out saw the gentlemen standing, and bustling up,\r\nsaid, \"Get up, my son, and let these gentlemen be seated.\" Mr.\r\nStephens at once arose and his friends burst out laughing; they\r\nexplained the situation to the hotel-keeper who was profuse in his\r\napologies.\r\n\r\nAn instance of his remarkable bravery is the affair with Judge Cone.\r\nThis gentleman considered himself insulted by a remark of Mr. Stephens\r\nand demanded a retraction. After accepting an explanation, he still\r\ninsisted on a retraction, and Mr. Stephens refused to make it. Judge\r\nCone, a tall and powerful man, then drew a knife on him and holding\r\nhim down on the floor, cried out, \"Retract, or I'll cut you to\r\npieces.\" \"_Never!_\" answered Stephens, \"_cut!_\" and caught the\r\ndescending knife in his right hand. Friends interposed; Judge Cone\r\napologized, and they afterwards became reconciled.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens was elected to the United States Senate, 1874 and 1876:\r\nhe was governor of Georgia when he died.

This\r\nseems to be a manifest error. No person has any natural right whatever\r\nto hurt or injure another. The object of society and government is to\r\nprevent and redress injuries of this sort; for, in a state of nature,\r\nwithout a restraining power of government, the strong would viciously\r\nimpose upon the weak.\r\n\r\nAnother erroneous dogma pretty generally taught is, that the object of\r\ngovernments should be to confer the greatest benefit upon the greatest\r\nnumber of its constituent members. The true doctrine is, the object\r\nshould be to confer the greatest possible good upon every member,\r\nwithout any detriment or injury to a single one.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH IN THE SENATE, FEB. 5, 1850.\r\n\r\n(_From Johnston and Browne's Life of Stephens._[20])\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~University of Alabama.~]\r\n\r\nMillard Fillmore, occupying the conspicuous seat erected for the\r\nsecond officer of the Government. . . . His countenance is open and\r\nbland, his chest full. His eye is bright, blue, and intelligent; his\r\nhair thick and slightly gray. His personal appearance is striking; and\r\nno one can look at him without feeling conscious that he is a man far\r\nabove the average. On his right, near the aisle leading to the front\r\ndoor, sits Cass with hands folded in his lap . . . .; his\r\nsleepy-looking eyes occasionally glancing at the galleries, and then\r\nat the crowd pressing in below. Benton sits in his well-known place,\r\nleaning back in his chair, and giving all who desire it a full view of\r\nhis person. One vacant seat is seen not far off on the same side of\r\nthe House. A vacant seat in such a crowd excites the attention of all.\r\n\"Whose seat is that?\" goes in whispers around. \"It's Calhoun's--not\r\nwell enough to be out yet.\"--\"Who is that sitting by Cass?\" says\r\none.--\"That is Buchanan,--come all the way from home to hear\r\nClay.\"--\"What thin-visaged man is that standing over yonder and\r\nconstantly moving?\"-- . . . \"That is Ritchie of the _Union_.\"--\"Who is\r\nthat walking down the aisle with that uncouth coat and all that hair\r\nabout his chin?

Instantaneously there is general\r\napplause, which Mr. Clay seems not to notice. The noise within is\r\nheard without, and the great crowd raised such a shout that Mr. Clay\r\nhad to pause until the officers went out and cleared all the\r\nentrances, and then he began. He spoke on that day two hours and\r\nfifteen minutes. The speech was reported in the _Globe_ word for word\r\nas he uttered it. I never saw such a report before. His voice was\r\ngood, his enunciation clear and distinct, his action firm, his\r\nstrength far surpassing my expectation. He had the riveted gaze of the\r\nmultitude the whole time. When he concluded, an immense throng of\r\nfriends, both men and women came up to congratulate and to _kiss_ him.\r\n\r\n_March 31st._--The Angel of Death has just passed by, and his shadow\r\nis seen lingering upon the startled countenances of all.

Judge Meek's writings\r\nteem with the romantic and marvellous incidents of the early history\r\nof Alabama, such as De Soto's march to the Mississippi, the Battle of\r\nMauville and defeat of the great Indian King, Tuscaloosa, or Black\r\nWarrior, the Canoe-Fight of Dale, or Sam Thlucco, as the Indians\r\ncalled him (\"Big Sam\"), and the attack on Fort Mims.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED EAGLE, OR WEATHERFORD.\r\n\r\n(_From Romantic Passages in South-Western History._)\r\n\r\nThe battle of Tohopeka put an end to the hopes of Weatherford. This\r\nvillage was situated on a peninsula, within the \"horse-shoe bend\" of\r\nthe Tallapoosa. Here twelve hundred warriors . . . had fortified\r\nthemselves for a desperate struggle, assured by their prophets that\r\nthe Master of Breath would now interpose in their favor. Across the\r\nneck of land, three hundred and fifty yards wide, that leads into the\r\npeninsula, they had constructed powerful breastworks of hewn logs,\r\neight or ten feet high, and pierced with double rows of port-holes,\r\nfrom which they could fire with perfect security. The selection of\r\nthis spot and the character of its defence did great credit to the\r\nmilitary genius of Weatherford,--and his eloquence, more than usually\r\npersuasive and inspiriting, filled his devoted followers with a\r\ncourage strangely compounded of fanaticism and despair.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour in the morning, General Coffee's command having\r\ncrossed the river and encircled the bend so as to cut off all escape,\r\nGeneral Jackson opened his artillery upon the breastworks, and having\r\nbut in part demolished them, ordered forward the thirty-ninth regiment\r\nto carry the place by storm. The van was gallantly led by Col.\r\nWilliams, Col. Bunch, Lieut.-Col. Benton, and Maj. Montgomery. Amidst\r\na most destructive fire, they pressed to the breastworks, and\r\ndesperately struggled for the command of the port-holes. But Maj.\r\nMontgomery, impatient at the delay, cried out to his men to follow\r\nhim, and leaped upon the wall in face of the deadliest fire. For an\r\ninstant he waved his sword over his head in triumph, but the next fell\r\nlifeless to the ground, shot through the head by a rifle ball. A more\r\ngallant spirit never achieved a nobler death, and the name of the\r\nyoung Tennesseean is preserved as a proud designation by one of the\r\nrichest counties, as well as by one of the most flourishing cities, in\r\nthe State whose soil was baptized by his blood!\r\n\r\nThe breastworks having been carried by storm, the Indians fell back\r\namong the trees, brush, and timber of the peninsula, and kept up a\r\nspirited contest. But, in the meantime, a portion of Coffee's command,\r\nand some of the friendly warriors under their distinguished chief,\r\nMcIntosh, had swum across the river, fired the village of Tohopeka,\r\nand carried off the canoes of the enemy. The followers of Weatherford\r\nnow became desperate, and from the banks, hollows, and other\r\nfastnesses of the place, fought with fury, refusing all offers of\r\nquarter. The fight continued in severity for five hours; and the going\r\ndown of the sun was hailed by the survivors as furnishing them some\r\nchance of escape. But the hope was, in the main, deceptive. . . .\r\n\r\n. . . Not more than twenty warriors are believed to have escaped,\r\nunder cover of the night. Among these, strange enough, was the\r\nchieftain [Weatherford], whose appellation, \"the Murderer of Fort\r\nMims,\" had formed the watch-word and war-cry of his enemies in this\r\nvery engagement. Favored by the thick darkness, he floated down the\r\nriver with his horse, until below the American lines, and then\r\nreaching the shore, made his way in safety to the highlands south of\r\nthe Tallapoosa. . .\r\n\r\nWeatherford could not consent to fly from the nation; he felt that he\r\nowed it, as a duty to his people, not to abandon them until peace was\r\nrestored. In this state of mind he was apprised that the American\r\ncommander had set a price upon his head, and refused peace to the\r\nother chiefs, unless they should bring him either dead, or in\r\nconfinement, to the American camp, now at Fort Jackson, near the\r\njunction of the rivers. His determination was at once taken in the\r\nsame spirit of heroism that always marked his conduct. Accordingly,\r\nmounting his horse, he made his way across the country, and soon\r\nappeared at the lines of the encampment. At his request, a sentinel\r\nconducted him to the presence of the commander-in-chief, who was\r\nseated in his marquee, in consultation with several of his principal\r\nofficers. The stately and noble appearance of the warrior at once\r\nexcited the attention and surprise of the General, and he demanded of\r\nthe Chief his name and the purpose of his visit.\r\n\r\nIn calm and deliberate tones, the chieftain said: \"I am Weatherford. I\r\nhave come to ask peace for myself and for my people.\"\r\n\r\nThe mild dignity with which these words were uttered, no less than\r\ntheir import, struck the American commander with surprise. [He hardly\r\nknew what to do; but he allowed some parley and Weatherford made a\r\nspeech, ending thus:] \"General Jackson, you are a brave man: I am\r\nanother. I do not fear to die. But I rely on your generosity. You will\r\nexact no terms of a conquered and helpless people, but those to which\r\nthey should accede. . . . You have told us what we may do and be safe.\r\nYours is a good talk and my nation ought to listen to it. They _shall_\r\nlisten to it!\" . . .\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson acceded to the demands of Weatherford, and assured him\r\nof peace and safety for himself and people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP PENDLETON COOKE.\r\n\r\n~1816=1850.~\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP PENDLETON COOKE, the elder brother of the better known John\r\nEsten Cooke, was born in Martinsburg, Virginia, and spent his short\r\nlife happily in his native county, engaged in field sports and in\r\nwriting stories and poems for the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" and\r\nother magazines.

On his\r\ndeath the Kentucky Legislature passed a resolution to remove his\r\nremains to Frankfort and lay them beside the soldiers whom he had so\r\nwell praised in his \"Bivouac of the Dead;\" and there he rests, the\r\nsoldier bard, among the voiceless braves of the Battle of Buena Vista.\r\nThis poem was written for the occasion of their interment; and it has\r\nfurnished the lines of inscription over the gateways of several\r\nmilitary cemeteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Bivouac of the Dead.\r\n    The Old Pioneer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIVOUAC OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n(_In Memory of the Kentuckians who fell at the Battle of Buena Vista,\r\nJan. 28, 1847._)\r\n\r\n    The muffled drum's sad roll has beat\r\n      The soldier's last tattoo;\r\n    No more on Life's parade shall meet\r\n      That brave and fallen few.\r\n    On Fame's eternal camping-ground\r\n      Their silent tents are spread,\r\n    And Glory guards, with solemn round,\r\n      The bivouac of the dead.\r\n\r\n    No rumor of the foe's advance\r\n      Now swells upon the wind;\r\n    No troubled thought at midnight haunts\r\n      Of loved ones left behind;\r\n    No vision of the morrow's strife\r\n      The warrior's dream alarms;\r\n    No braying horn nor screaming fife\r\n      At dawn shall call to arms.\r\n\r\n    Their shivered swords are red with rust,\r\n      Their plumèd heads are bowed;\r\n    Their haughty banner, trailed in dust,\r\n      Is now their martial shroud.\r\n    And plenteous funeral tears have washed\r\n      The red stains from each brow,\r\n    And the proud forms, by battle gashed,\r\n      Are free from anguish now.\r\n\r\n    The neighing troop, the flashing blade,\r\n      The bugle's stirring blast,\r\n    The charge, the dreadful cannonade,\r\n      The din and shout, are past;\r\n    Nor war's wild note nor glory's peal\r\n      Shall thrill with fierce delight\r\n    Those breasts that never more may feel\r\n      The rapture of the fight.\r\n\r\n    . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n    Full many a norther's breath has swept\r\n      O'er Angostura's plain,--\r\n    And long the pitying sky has wept\r\n      Above its mouldered slain.\r\n    The raven's scream, or eagle's flight,\r\n      Or shepherd's pensive lay,\r\n    Alone awakes each sullen height\r\n      That frowned o'er that dread fray.\r\n\r\n    Sons of the Dark and Bloody Ground,\r\n      Ye must not slumber there,\r\n    Where stranger steps and tongues resound\r\n      Along the heedless air.\r\n    Your own proud land's heroic soil\r\n      Shall be your fitter grave:\r\n    She claims from war his richest spoil--\r\n      The ashes of her brave.\r\n\r\n    Thus 'neath their parent turf they rest,\r\n      Far from the gory field,\r\n    Borne to a Spartan mother's breast\r\n      On many a bloody shield;\r\n    The sunshine of their native sky\r\n      Smiles sadly on them, here,\r\n    And kindred eyes and hearts watch by\r\n      The heroes' sepulchre.\r\n\r\n    Rest on, embalmed and sainted dead!\r\n      Dear as the blood ye gave;\r\n    No impious footstep here shall tread\r\n      The herbage of your grave;\r\n    Nor shall your glory be forgot\r\n      While Fame her record keeps,\r\n    Or Honor points the hallowed spot\r\n      Where Valor proudly sleeps.\r\n\r\n    Yon marble minstrel's voiceless stone\r\n      In deathless song shall tell,\r\n    When many a vanished age hath flown,\r\n      The story how ye fell;\r\n    Nor wreck, nor change, nor winter's blight,\r\n      Nor Time's remorseless doom,\r\n    Shall dim one ray of glory's light\r\n      That gilds your deathless tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH PERIOD ... 1850-1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE RAINSFORD FAIRBANKS.\r\n\r\n~1820=----.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE RAINSFORD FAIRBANKS was born in Watertown, New York, but\r\nsettled in Florida at St. Augustine in 1842 and identified himself\r\nwith his adopted state. From 1860 to 1880 his home was at Sewanee,\r\nTennessee, and he has been on the Board of Trustees of the \"University\r\nof the South\" since 1857. During the war he served as major in the\r\nConfederate army, 1862-65. In 1880 he returned to Florida and has\r\nsince made his home in Fernandina. His \"History of Florida\" is\r\nconsidered the best history of that state, and is written in a clear\r\nand interesting style.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    History of Florida.\r\n    History and Antiquities of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCEOLA, LEADER OF THE SEMINOLES.\r\n\r\n(_From History of Florida._[21])\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Osceola.~]\r\n\r\nHis true Indian name was As-se-se-ha-ho-lar, or Black Drink, but he\r\nwas commonly called Osceola, or Powell. He belonged to a Creek tribe\r\ncalled Red Sticks, and was a half-breed. He removed to Florida with\r\nhis mother when a child, and lived near Fort King [three miles east of\r\nOcala]. At the beginning of the Florida war he was about thirty-one\r\nyears of age, of medium size, being about five feet eight inches in\r\nheight, resolute and manly in his bearing, with a clear, frank, and\r\nengaging countenance. He was undoubtedly the master-spirit of the war,\r\nand by his firmness and audacity forced the nation into the war which\r\na large majority were averse to engaging in, and either broke up every\r\nattempt at negotiations or prevented their fulfillment. He was to have\r\nbeen one of the leaders at Dade's massacre, but was detained at Fort\r\nKing by his determination to gratify his revenge upon General\r\nThompson. He participated in the battles at the ford of the\r\nWithlacoochee and Camp Izard, and led the attack upon Micanopy, where,\r\nwith his force of less than two hundred and fifty men, within sight of\r\nthe fort, he attacked upwards of one hundred regular troops in an open\r\nfield, supported by a field-piece.\r\n\r\nHis capture, [October, 1837], by General Hernandez was due to his\r\naudacity and self-confidence. Bad faith, and a disregard of the usages\r\nof civilization, have been imputed to General Jesup on this occasion,\r\nOsceola having come in under a white flag to negotiate; but that\r\nofficer contended that Osceola had broken his faith in reference to\r\nthe Fort Dade capitulation [when he had promised to emigrate] and was\r\nto be treated as a prisoner.\r\n\r\nFrom all that can be gathered of his character, Osceola was possessed\r\nof nobler traits than usually belong to his race. His manners were\r\ndignified and courteous, and upon the field he showed himself a brave\r\nand cautious leader. It is said that he instructed his people in their\r\npredatory excursions to spare the women and children. \"It is not,\"\r\nsaid he, \"upon them that we make war and draw the scalping-knife. It\r\nis upon men. Let us act like men.\"\r\n\r\nOsceola has furnished to the poet, to the novelist, and to the lover\r\nof romance, a most attractive subject, and scarce any limit has been\r\nplaced to the virtues attributed or the exploits imagined in\r\nconnection with this renowned chief of the Seminoles. A poet has sung\r\nof him,--\r\n\r\n    \"His features are clothed with a warrior's pride,\r\n      And he moves with a monarch's tread;\r\n    He smiles with joy, as the flash of steel\r\n      Through the Everglades' grass is seen.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his removal to Charleston, he became dejected and low-spirited,\r\nand gradually pined away. All efforts to interest him in a Western\r\nhome failed to arouse him, and in a few weeks he died of a broken\r\nheart, and was buried just outside of the principal gateway of Fort\r\nMoultrie, where his resting-place is inclosed and a monument erected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[21] By permission of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n~1822=----.~\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON was born in Hancock County, Georgia.

Stephens' first client.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HEZEKIAH ELLINGTON'S RECOVERY.\r\n\r\n(_From Life of Alexander H. Stephens._[22])\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was brought very low with malarious fever, and his\r\nphysician and family had made up their minds, that, notwithstanding\r\nhis extreme reluctance to depart from this life,--a reluctance\r\nheightened no doubt by his want of preparation for a better,--he would\r\nbe compelled to go. The system of therapeutics in vogue at that time\r\nand in that section included immense quantities of calomel, and\r\nrigorously excluded cold water. Mr. Ellington lingered and lingered,\r\nand went without water so long and to such an extent that it seemed to\r\nhim he might as well die of the disease as of the intolerable thirst\r\nthat tormented him. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nAt last, one night, when his physicians, deeming his case hopeless,\r\nhad taken their departure, informing his family that he could hardly\r\nlive till morning, and the latter, worn down by watching, were\r\ncompelled to take a little rest, he was left to the care of his\r\nconstant and faithful servant, Shadrach, with strict and solemn charge\r\nto notify them if any change took place in his master's condition,\r\nand, above all, under no circumstances to give him cold water.\r\n\r\nWhen the rest were all asleep, Mr. Ellington, always astute and\r\nadroit in gaining his ends, and whose faculties at present were highly\r\nstimulated by his extreme necessity, called out to his attendant in a\r\nfeeble voice, which he strove to make as natural and unsuggestive as\r\npossible,--\r\n\r\n\"Shadrach, go to the spring and fetch me a pitcher of water from the\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\nShadrach expostulated, pleading the orders of the doctor and his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n\"You Shadrach, you had better do what I tell you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nShadrach still held by his orders.\r\n\r\n\"Shadrach, if you don't bring me the water, when I get well I'll give\r\nyou the worst whipping you ever had in your life!\"\r\n\r\nShadrach either thought that if his master got well he would cherish\r\nno rancor towards the faithful servant whose constancy had saved him,\r\nor, more likely, that the prospect of recovery was far too remote to\r\njustify any serious apprehension for his present disobedience; at all\r\nevents, he held firm. The sick man, finding this mode of attack\r\nineffectual, paused awhile, and then said, in the most persuasive\r\naccents he could employ,\r\n\r\n\"Shadrach, my boy, you are a good nigger, Shadrach. If you'll go now\r\nand fetch old master a pitcher of nice cool water, I'll set you free\r\nand give you _Five Hundred Dollars_!\" And he dragged the syllables\r\nslowly and heavily from his dry jaws, as if to make the sum appear\r\nimmeasurably vast.\r\n\r\nBut Shadrach was proof against even this temptation. He only admitted\r\nits force by arguing the case, urging that how could he stand it, and\r\nwhat good would his freedom and five hundred dollars do him, if he\r\nshould do a thing that would kill his old master?\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman groaned and moaned. At last he bethought him of one\r\nfinal stratagem. He raised his head as well as he could, turned his\r\nhaggard face full upon Shadrach, and glaring at him from his hollow\r\nblood-shot eyes, said,\r\n\r\n\"Shadrach, I am going to die, and it's because I can't get any water.\r\nIf you don't go and bring me a pitcher of water, after I'm dead I'll\r\ncome back and HAUNT you! I'll HAUNT you as long as you live!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh Lordy! Master! You shall hab de water!\" cried Shadrach; and he\r\nrushed out to the spring and brought it. The old man drank and\r\ndrank,--the pitcherful and more. The next morning he was decidedly\r\nbetter, and to the astonishment of all, soon got well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[22] By permission of authors, and publishers, J. B.

He studied law, but practised little, and in\r\n1847 became editor of the \"Southern Literary Messenger.\" This position\r\nhe filled with great success for twelve years and he exerted a fine\r\ninfluence on the literary taste and effort of his times. In this\r\nmagazine first appeared the writings of Donald G. Mitchell (\"Dream\r\nLife\" and \"Reveries of a Bachelor\"), the early pieces of John Esten\r\nCooke, Philip Pendleton Cooke, Paul Hamilton Hayne, Henry Timrod, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nHis delicate health induced him to resign his place in 1859 and to go\r\nfarther south to Augusta, Georgia, as editor of the \"Southern Field\r\nand Fireside.\" In 1863 he travelled in Europe and his descriptive\r\nletters are very bright and interesting. He later became literary\r\neditor of the \"Evening Post,\" N. Y.; in 1872 he went to Colorado in\r\none last but vain effort to restore his health. He died in 1873 and is\r\nburied in Hollywood Cemetery at Richmond.\r\n\r\nHis writings, consisting of poems, letters, sketches, and editorials,\r\nare found mainly in the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" and \"The Land We\r\nLove.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nASHBY.\r\n\r\n    To the brave all homage render,\r\n      Weep, ye skies of June!\r\n    With a radiance pure and tender,\r\n       Shine, oh saddened moon!\r\n    \"Dead upon the field of glory,\"\r\n    Hero fit for song and story,\r\n      Lies our bold dragoon.\r\n\r\n    Well they learned, whose hands have slain him,\r\n      Braver, knightlier foe\r\n    Never fought with Moor nor Paynim,\r\n      Rode at Templestowe;\r\n    With a mien how high and joyous,\r\n    'Gainst the hordes that would destroy us\r\n      Went he forth we know.\r\n\r\n    Never more, alas! shall sabre\r\n      Gleam around his crest;\r\n    Fought his fight; fulfilled his labour;\r\n      Stilled his manly breast.\r\n    All unheard sweet Nature's cadence,\r\n    Trump of fame and voice of maidens,\r\n      Now he takes his rest.\r\n\r\n    Earth that all too soon hath bound him,\r\n      Gently wrap his clay;\r\n    Linger lovingly around him,\r\n      Light of dying day;\r\n    Softly fall the summer showers,\r\n    Birds and bees among the flowers\r\n      Make the gloom seem gay.\r\n\r\n    There, throughout the coming ages,\r\n      When his sword is rust,\r\n    And his deeds in classic pages,\r\n      Mindful of her trust,\r\n    Shall Virginia, bending lowly,\r\n    Still a ceaseless vigil holy\r\n      Keep above his dust!\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC IN CAMP.\r\n\r\n    Two armies covered hill and plain,\r\n      Where Rappahannock's waters\r\n    Ran deeply crimsoned with the stain\r\n      Of battle's recent slaughters.\r\n\r\n    The summer clouds lay pitched like tents\r\n      In meads of heavenly azure;\r\n    And each dread gun of the elements\r\n      Slept in its hid embrasure.\r\n\r\n    The breeze so softly blew, it made\r\n      No forest leaf to quiver,\r\n    And the smoke of the random cannonade\r\n      Rolled slowly from the river.\r\n\r\n    And now, where circling hills looked down\r\n      With cannon grimly planted,\r\n    O'er listless camp and silent town\r\n      The golden sunset slanted.\r\n\r\n    When on the fervid air there came\r\n      A strain--now rich, now tender;\r\n    The music seemed itself aflame\r\n      With day's departing splendor.\r\n\r\n    A Federal band, which, eve and morn,\r\n      Played measures brave and nimble,\r\n    Had just struck up, with flute and horn\r\n      And lively clash of cymbal.\r\n\r\n    Down flocked the soldiers to the banks,\r\n      Till, margined by its pebbles,\r\n    One wooded shore was blue with \"Yanks,\"\r\n      And one was gray with \"Rebels.\"\r\n\r\n    Then all was still, and then the band,\r\n      With movement light and tricksy,\r\n    Made stream and forest, hill and strand\r\n      Reverberate with \"Dixie.\"\r\n\r\n    The conscious stream with burnished glow\r\n      Went proudly o'er its pebbles,\r\n    But thrilled throughout its deepest flow\r\n      With yelling of the Rebels.\r\n\r\n    Again a pause, and then again\r\n      The trumpets pealed sonorous,\r\n    And \"Yankee Doodle\" was the strain\r\n    To which the shore gave chorus.\r\n\r\n    The laughing ripple shoreward flew,\r\n      To kiss the shining pebbles;\r\n    Loud shrieked the swarming Boys in Blue\r\n      Defiance to the Rebels.\r\n\r\n    And yet once more the bugles sang\r\n      Above the stormy riot;\r\n    No shout upon the evening rang--\r\n      There reigned a holy quiet.\r\n\r\n    The sad, slow stream its noiseless flood\r\n      Poured o'er the glistening pebbles;\r\n    All silent now the Yankees stood,\r\n      And silent stood the Rebels.\r\n\r\n    No unresponsive soul had heard\r\n      That plaintive note's appealing,\r\n    So deeply \"Home Sweet Home\" had stirred\r\n      The hidden founts of feeling.\r\n\r\n    Or Blue, or Gray, the soldier sees\r\n      As by the wand of fairy,\r\n    The cottage 'neath the live-oak trees,\r\n      The cabin by the prairie.\r\n\r\n    Or cold, or warm, his native skies\r\n      Bend in their beauty o'er him;\r\n    Seen through the tear-mist in his eyes,\r\n      His loved ones stand before him.\r\n\r\n    As fades the iris after rain\r\n      In April's tearful weather,\r\n    The vision vanished, as the strain\r\n      And daylight died together.\r\n\r\n    But memory, waked by music's art,\r\n      Expressed in simplest numbers,\r\n    Subdued the sternest Yankee's heart,\r\n      Made light the Rebel's slumbers.\r\n\r\n    And fair the form of music shines,\r\n      That bright celestial creature,\r\n    Who still, 'mid war's embattled lines,\r\n      Gave this one touch of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJABEZ LAMAR MONROE CURRY.\r\n\r\n~1825=----.~\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. CURRY was born in Georgia, but his father removed to Alabama in\r\n1838, and he was reared in that State. After graduation at the\r\nUniversity of Georgia and at the Harvard Law School, he began the\r\npractice of law in Talladega County, Alabama. He served in the State\r\nLegislature and in Congress, and in 1861 entered the Confederate Army.\r\n\r\nAfter the war he was ordained to the Baptist ministry and became\r\npresident of Howard College, Alabama, and later, professor of English,\r\nPhilosophy, and Law, in Richmond College, Virginia, which latter\r\nposition he filled for thirteen years. From 1881 to 1885 he was agent\r\nof the Peabody Educational Fund; in 1885 he was appointed minister to\r\nSpain, and on his return to America resumed the agency of the Fund.\r\nHis wise administration and his well-directed efforts have done much\r\nto further the cause of education; and his ability and effectiveness\r\nas a speaker and writer have given him national fame.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Constitutional History of Spain.\r\n    Gladstone.\r\n    Southern States of the American Union [just issued, 1895].\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND AMERICA.\r\n\r\n(_From Gladstone._[23])\r\n\r\nBy his frank utterances, expressive of his admiration of the people\r\nand the institutions of the United States, he has provoked adverse\r\ncriticism from a portion of the English press. He thinks the Senate of\r\nthe United States \"the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern\r\npolitics,\" and the American constitution \"the most wonderful work ever\r\nstruck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man,\" and that\r\n\"its exemption from formal change, has certainly proved the sagacity\r\nof its constructors and the stubborn strength of the fabric.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same essay--_Kin Beyond Sea_--speaking of our future, he says,\r\n\"She will probably become what we are now, the head servant in the\r\ngreat household of the world, the employer of all employed; because\r\nher service will be the most and the ablest.\" In 1856, when the\r\nrelations between Great Britain and the United States became\r\nconsiderably strained, in an able speech may be found this sentence:\r\n\"It appears to me that the two cardinal aims that we ought to keep in\r\nview in the discussion of this question are peace and a thoroughly\r\ncordial understanding with America for one, the honor and fame of\r\nEngland for the other.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1884, he wrote: \"The convulsion of that country between 1861 and\r\n1865 was perhaps the most frightful which ever assailed a national\r\nexistence. The efforts which were made on both sides were marked. The\r\nexertions by which alone the movement was put down were not only\r\nextraordinary, they were what antecedently would have been called\r\nimpossible; and they were only rendered possible by the fact that they\r\nproceeded from a nation where every capable citizen was enfranchised\r\nand had a direct and an energetic interest in the well-being and unity\r\nof the State.\" \"No hardier republicanism was generated in New England\r\nthan in the slave States of the South, which produced so many of the\r\ngreat statesmen of America.\"\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with Mr. Gladstone in 1887, he referred to the\r\nenormous power and responsibilities of the United States, and\r\nsuggested that a desideratum was a new unity between our two\r\ncountries. We had that of race and language, but we needed a moral\r\nunity of English-speaking people for the success of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe English or Anglo-Saxon race is essentially the same in its more\r\ndistinguishing characteristics. Unity of language creates unity of\r\nthought, of literature, and largely unity of civilization and of\r\ninstitutions. It facilitates social and commercial intercourse, and\r\nmust produce still more marked political phenomena. We profit\r\nnaturally by inventions, by discoveries, by constitutional struggles,\r\nby civil and religious achievements, by lessons of traditions, by\r\nlandmarks of usage and prescription. Magna Charta, Petition of Right,\r\nHabeas Corpus, what O'Connell even called the \"glorious Revolution of\r\n1688,\" are as much American as English.\r\n\r\nEngland claims to have originated the representative system six\r\nhundred years ago. Our ancestors brought to this soil, \"singularly\r\nsuited for their growth, all that was democratic in the policy of\r\nEngland and all that was Protestant in her religion.\" Our revolution,\r\nlike that of 1688, was in the main a vindication of liberties\r\ninherited. In freedom of religion, in local self-government, and\r\nsomewhat in state autonomy, our forefathers constructed for\r\nthemselves; but nearly all the personal guarantees, of which we so\r\nmuch boast on our national anniversaries, were borrowed from the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[23] By permission of B.

It was said that he was no belligerent then, but\r\nwanted to see the maiden that he loved a safe transit, and so he\r\nescorted the old chief and his clan as far as Tuscumbia, and then\r\nbroke down and returned to Ross Landing on the Tennessee River. He was\r\ntoo heavy to march, and when he arrived at the Landing, a prisoner was\r\nput in his charge for safe keeping. Ross Landing is Chattanooga now,\r\nand John Ross lived there, and was one of the chiefs of the Cherokees.\r\nThe prisoner was his guest, and his name was John Howard Payne. He was\r\nsuspected of trying to instigate the Cherokees to revolt and fight,\r\nand not leave their beautiful forest homes on the Tennessee and Coosa\r\nand Oostanaula and the Etowah and Connasauga rivers. He brought Payne\r\nback as far as New Echota, or New Town, as it was called, an Indian\r\nsettlement on the Coosawattee, a few miles east of Calhoun, as now\r\nknown. There he kept the author of \"Home, Sweet Home\" under guard, or\r\non his parole of honor, for three weeks, and night after night slept\r\nwith him in his tent, and listened to his music upon the violin, and\r\nheard him sing his own sad songs until orders came for his discharge,\r\nand Payne was sent under escort to Washington.\r\n\r\nMany a time I have heard Big John recite his sad adventures. \"It was a\r\nmost distressive business,\" said he. \"Them Injuns was heart-broken; I\r\nalways knowd an Injun loved his hunting-ground and his rivers, but I\r\nnever knowd how much they loved 'em before. You know they killed Ridge\r\nfor consentin' to the treaty. They killed him on the first day's march\r\nand they wouldent bury him. We soldiers had to stop and dig a grave\r\nand put him away. John Ross and John Ridge were the sons of two\r\nScotchmen, who came over here when they were young men and mixed up\r\nwith these tribes and got their good will. These two boys were\r\nsplendid looking men, tall and handsome, with long auburn hair, and\r\nthey were active and strong, and could shoot a bow equal to the best\r\nbowman of the tribe, and they beat 'em all to pieces on the cross-bow.\r\nThey married the daughters of the old chiefs, and when the old chiefs\r\ndied they just fell into line and succeeded to the old chiefs' places,\r\nand the tribes liked 'em mighty well, for they were good men and made\r\ngood chiefs. Well, you see Ross dident like the treaty. He said it\r\nwasent fair and that the price of the territory was too low, and the\r\nfact is he dident want to go at all. There are the ruins of his old\r\nhome now over there in De Soto, close to Rome, and I tell you he was a\r\nking. His word was the law of the Injun nations, and he had their love\r\nand their respect. His half-breed children were the purtiest things I\r\never saw in my life. Well, Ridge lived up the Oostanaula River about a\r\nmile, and he was a good man, too. Ross and Ridge always consulted\r\nabout everything for the good of the tribes, but Ridge was a more\r\nmilder man than Ross, and was more easily persuaded to sign the treaty\r\nthat gave the lands to the State and to take other lands away out to\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it took us a month to get 'em all together and begin the March\r\nto the Mississippi, and they wouldn't march then. The women would go\r\nout of line and set down in the woods and go to grieving; and you may\r\nbelieve it or not, but I'll tell you what is a fact, we started with\r\n14,000, and 4,000 of 'em died before we got to Tuscumbia. They died on\r\nthe side of the road; they died of broken hearts; they died of\r\nstarvation, for they wouldent eat a thing; they just died all along\r\nthe way. We didn't make more than five miles a day on the march, and\r\nmy company didn't do much but dig graves and bury Injuns all the way\r\nto Tuscumbia. They died of grief and broken hearts, and no mistake. An\r\nInjun's heart is tender, and his love is strong; it's his nature. I'd\r\nrather risk an Injun for a true friend than a white man. He is the\r\nbest friend in the world and the worst enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[25] By permission of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE H. TUCKER.\r\n\r\n~1828=1863.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE H. TUCKER, grandson of Judge St. George Tucker, was born\r\nat Winchester, Virginia. He was clerk of the Virginia Legislature:\r\nand in 1861 he entered the Confederate service and rose to be\r\nLieutenant-Colonel. He died from exposure in the Seven Days' Battles\r\naround Richmond, 1862.\r\n\r\nHis \"Hansford\" is considered one of the best of historical romances\r\nand gives a vivid picture of Virginia in the seventeenth century under\r\nGovernor Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Hansford, A Tale of Bacon's Rebellion.\r\n    The Southern Crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNING OF JAMESTOWN IN 1676.\r\n\r\n(_From Hansford._)\r\n\r\nScarcely had Berkeley and his adherents departed on their flight from\r\nJamestown, when some of the disaffected citizens of the town, seeing\r\nthe lights in the palace so suddenly extinguished, shrewdly suspected\r\ntheir design. Without staying to ascertain the truth of their\r\nsuspicions, they hastened with the intelligence to General Bacon, and\r\nthrew open the gates to the insurgents. Highly elated with the easy\r\nvictory they had gained over the loyalists, the triumphant patriots\r\nforgetting their fatigue and hunger, marched into the city, amid the\r\nloud acclamations of the fickle populace. But to the surprise of all\r\nthere was still a gloom resting upon Bacon and his officers. That\r\ncautious and far-seeing man saw at a glance, that although he had\r\ngained an immense advantage over the royalists, in the capture of the\r\nmetropolis, it was impossible to retain it in possession long. As soon\r\nas his army was dispersed, or engaged in another quarter of the\r\ncolony, it would be easy for Berkeley, with the navy under his\r\ncommand, to return to the place, and erect once more the fallen\r\nstandard of loyalty.\r\n\r\nWhile then, the soldiery were exulting rapturously over their triumph,\r\nBacon, surrounded by his officers, was gravely considering the best\r\npolicy to pursue.\r\n\r\n\"My little army is too small,\" he said, \"to leave a garrison here, and\r\nso long as they remain thus organized peace will be banished from the\r\ncolony; and yet I cannot leave the town to become again the harbour of\r\nthese treacherous loyalists.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can suggest no policy that is fit to pursue, in such an emergency,\"\r\nsaid Hansford, \"except to retain possession of the town, at least\r\nuntil the Governor is fairly in Accomac again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, at best,\" said Bacon, \"will only be a dilatory proceeding, for\r\nsooner or later, whenever the army is disbanded, the stubborn old\r\ngovernor will return and force us to continue the war. And besides I\r\ndoubt whether we could maintain the place with Brent besieging us in\r\nfront, and the whole naval force of Virginia, under the command of\r\nsuch expert seamen as Gardiner and Larimore, attacking us from the\r\nriver. No, no, the only way to untie the Gordian knot is to cut it,\r\nand the only way to extricate ourselves from this difficulty is to\r\nburn the town.\"\r\n\r\nThis policy, extreme as it was, in the necessities of their condition\r\nwas received with a murmur of assent. Lawrence and Drummond, devoted\r\npatriots, and two of the wealthiest and most enterprising citizens of\r\nthe town, evinced their willingness to sacrifice their private means\r\nto secure the public good, by firing their own houses. Emulating an\r\nexample so noble and disinterested, other citizens followed in their\r\nwake. The soldiers, ever ready for excitement, joined in the fatal\r\nwork. A stiff breeze springing up favored their designs, and soon the\r\ndevoted town was enveloped in the greedy flames.\r\n\r\nFrom the deck of the _Adam and Eve_, the loyalists witnessed the\r\nstern, uncompromising resolution of the rebels. The sun was just\r\nrising, and his broad, red disc was met in his morning glory with\r\nflames as bright and as intense as his own. The Palace, the State\r\nHouse, the large Garter Tavern, the long line of stores, and the\r\nWarehouse, all in succession were consumed. The old Church, the proud\r\nold Church, where their fathers had worshipped, was the last to meet\r\nits fate. The fire seemed unwilling to attack its sacred walls, but it\r\nwas to fall with the rest; and as the broad sails of the gay vessel\r\nwere spread to the morning breeze, which swelled them, that devoted\r\nold Church was seen in its raiment of fire, like some old martyr,\r\nhugging the flames which consumed it, and pointing with its tapering\r\nsteeple to an avenging Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WILLIAM BAGBY.\r\n\r\n~1828=1883.~\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. BAGBY was born in Buckingham County, Virginia, and educated at\r\nEdge Hill, New Jersey, and the University of Pennsylvania. He took his\r\ndegree in the study of medicine, and made his residence in Richmond.\r\nHe was correspondent for several papers, wrote some very witty letters\r\nunder the pen-name of \"Mozis Addums,\" and made a reputation as a\r\nhumorous lecturer. From 1859 to 1862 he was editor of the \"Southern\r\nLiterary Messenger,\" ably succeeding John R. Thompson in that\r\nposition: and from 1870 to 1878 he was State Librarian of Virginia.\r\n\r\nHis writings are not only witty but wise as well, and give many\r\ninteresting aspects of Southern life and manners. A selection from\r\nthem has been published by Mrs. Bagby, under the title \"Writings of\r\nDr. Bagby\" (1884-6). Among them are: My Uncle Flatback's Plantation,\r\nMeekins's Twinses, Jud. Brownin's Account of Rubinstein's Playing,\r\nBacon and Greens, or the True Virginian, What I Did with my Fifty\r\nMillions, [a sort of Utopian Prophecy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUD. BROWNIN'S ACCOUNT OF RUBINSTEIN'S PLAYING.\r\n\r\n\"When he first sot down he 'peared to keer mighty little 'bout\r\nplayin', and wished he hadn't come. He tweedle-leedled a little on the\r\ntrible, and twoodle-oodle-oodled some on the bass--just foolin' and\r\nboxin' the thing's jaws for bein' in his way. And I says to a man\r\nsettin' next to me, s'I, 'What sort of fool playin' is that?' And he\r\nsays, 'Heish!' But presently his hands commenced chasin' one 'nother\r\nup and down the keys, like a passel of rats scamperin' through a\r\ngarret very swift. Parts of it was sweet, though, and reminded me of a\r\nsugar squirrel turnin' the wheel of a candy cage. 'Now,' I says to my\r\nneighbor, 'he's showing' off. He thinks he's a-doin' of it; but he\r\nain't got no idee, no plan of nuthin'. If he'd play me up a tune of\r\nsome kind or other, I'd'--\r\n\r\n\"But my neighbor says, 'Heish!' very impatient.\r\n\r\n\"I was just about to git up and go home, bein' tired of that\r\nfoolishness, when I heard a little bird wakin' up away off in the\r\nwoods, and callin' sleepy-like to his mate, and I looked up and I see\r\nthat Ruben was beginnin' to take interest in his business, and I set\r\ndown agin. It was the peep of day. The light come faint from the east,\r\nthe breeze blowed gentle and fresh, some more birds waked up in the\r\norchard, then some more in the trees near the house, and all begun\r\nsingin' together. People begun to stir, and the gal opened the\r\nshutters. Just then the first beam of the sun fell upon the blossoms;\r\na leetle more and it techt the roses on the bushes, and the next thing\r\nit was broad day; the sun fairly blazed; the birds sang like they'd\r\nsplit their little throats; all the leaves was movin', and flashin'\r\ndiamonds of dew, and the whole wide world was bright and happy as a\r\nking. Seemed to me like there was a good breakfast in every house in\r\nthe land, and not a sick child or woman anywhere. It was a fine\r\nmornin'.\r\n\r\n\"And I says to my neighbor, 'that's music, that is.'\r\n\r\n\"But he glared at me like he'd like to cut my throat.\r\n\r\n\"Presently the wind turned; it begun to thicken up, and a kind of gray\r\nmist come over things; I got low-spirited d'rectly. Then a silver rain\r\nbegan to fall; I could see the drops touch the ground; some flashed\r\nup like long pearl ear-rings; and the rest rolled away like round\r\nrubies. It was pretty, but melancholy. Then the pearls gathered\r\nthemselves into long strands and necklaces, and then they melted into\r\nthin silver streams running between golden gravels, and then the\r\nstreams joined each other at the bottom of the hill, and made a brook\r\nthat flowed silent except that you could kinder see the music\r\nspecially when the bushes on the banks moved as the music went along\r\ndown the valley. I could smell the flowers in the meadows. But the sun\r\ndidn't shine, nor the birds sing; it was a foggy day, but not cold.\r\nThen the sun went down, it got dark, the wind moaned and wept like a\r\nlost child for its dead mother, and I could a-got up then and there\r\nand preached a better sermon than any I ever listened to. There wasn't\r\na thing in the world left to live for, not a blame thing, and yet I\r\ndidn't want the music to stop one bit. It was happier to be miserable\r\nthan to be happy without being miserable. I couldn't understand\r\nit. . . . . . . Then, all of a sudden, old Ruben changed his tune. He\r\nripped and he rar'd, he tipped and he tar'd, he pranced and he charged\r\nlike the grand entry at a circus. 'Peared to me like all the gas in\r\nthe house was turned on at once, things got so bright, and I hilt up\r\nmy head, ready to look any man in the face, and not afeared of\r\nnothin'. It was a circus, and a brass band, and a big ball, all goin'\r\non at the same time. He lit into them keys like a thousand of brick,\r\nhe gave 'em no rest, day nor night; he set every living joint in me\r\nagoin', and not bein' able to stand it no longer, I jumpt spang onto\r\nmy seat, and jest hollered:\r\n\r\n\"'_Go it, my Rube!_'\r\n\r\n\"Every blamed man, woman, and child in the house riz on me, and\r\nshouted 'Put him out! Put him out!'\r\n\r\n\"With that some several p'licemen run up, and I had to simmer down.\r\nBut I would a fit any fool that laid hands on me, for I was bound to\r\nhear Ruby out or die.\r\n\r\n\"He had changed his tune agin. He hopt-light ladies and tip-toed fine\r\nfrom eend to eend of the key-board. He played soft, and low, and\r\nsolemn. I heard the church bells over the hills. The candles in heaven\r\nwas lit, one by one. I saw the stars rise. The great organ of eternity\r\nbegan to play from the world's end to the world's end, and all the\r\nangels went to prayers. Then the music changed to water, full of\r\nfeeling that couldn't be thought, and began to drop--drip, drop, drip,\r\ndrop--clear and sweet, like tears of joy fallin' into a lake of glory.\r\n\r\n\"He stopt a minute or two, to fetch breath. Then he got mad. He run\r\nhis fingers through his hair, he shoved up his sleeves, he opened\r\nhis coat-tails a leetle further, he drug up his stool, he leaned\r\nover, and, sir, he just went for that old pianner. He slapt her\r\nface, he boxed her jaws, he pulled her nose, he pinched her ears,\r\nand he scratched her cheeks, till she farly yelled. He knockt her\r\ndown and he stompt on her shameful. She bellowed like a bull, she\r\nbleated like a calf, she howled like a hound, she squealed like a\r\npig, she shrieked like a rat, and then he wouldn't let her up. He\r\nrun a quarter-stretch down the low grounds of the bass, till he got\r\nclean into the bowels of the earth, and you heard thunder galloping\r\nafter thunder, through the hollows and caves of perdition; and then\r\nhe fox-chased his right hand with his left till he got away out of\r\nthe trible into the clouds, whar the notes was finer than the pints\r\nof cambric needles, and you couldn't hear nothin' but the shadders\r\nof 'em. And then he wouldn't let the old pianner go. He fetchet up\r\nhis right wing, he fetcht up his left wing, he fetcht up his center,\r\nhe fetcht up his reserves. He fired by file, he fired by platoons,\r\nby company, by regiments, and by brigades. He opened his cannon,\r\nsiege-guns down thar, Napoleons here, twelve-pounders yonder, big\r\nguns, little guns, middle-sized guns, round shot, shell, shrapnel,\r\ngrape, canister, mortars, mines, and magazines, every livin' battery\r\nand bomb a goin' at the same time. The house trembled, the lights\r\ndanced, the walls shuk, the floor come up, the ceilin' come down,\r\nthe sky split, the ground rockt--BANG! With that _bang!_ he lifted\r\nhisself bodily into the ar', and he come down with his knees, his\r\nten fingers, his ten toes, his elbows, and his nose, strikin' every\r\nsingle solitary key on that pianner at the same time. The thing\r\nbusted and went off into seventeen hundred and fifty-seven thousand\r\nfive hundred and forty-two hemi-demi-semi-quivers, and I know'd no\r\nmo'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSARAH ANNE DORSEY.\r\n\r\n~1829=1879.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. DORSEY, daughter of Thomas G. P. Ellis, was born at Natchez,\r\nMississippi, and was a niece of Mrs. Catherine Warfield who left to\r\nher many of her unpublished manuscripts. She was finely educated and\r\ntravelled extensively. In 1853 she was married to Mr. Samuel W. Dorsey\r\nof Tensas Parish, Louisiana. Here she found scope for her energies in\r\nthe duties of plantation life. She established a chapel and school for\r\nthe slaves, and her account of the success of her plans gained her the\r\ntitle of \"Filia Ecclesiae\" from the \"Churchman.\" She afterwards used\r\n\"Filia\" as a pen-name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~University of Mississippi, University P. O., Miss.~]\r\n\r\nTheir home being destroyed during the war in a skirmish which took\r\nplace in their garden, and in which several men were killed, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Dorsey removed to Texas. They afterwards returned to Louisiana;\r\nand in 1875, upon the death of Mr. Dorsey, Mrs. Dorsey made her home\r\nat \"Beauvoir,\" her place in Mississippi. Here she spent her time in\r\nwriting, and also acted as amanuensis to Jefferson Davis in his great\r\nwork, \"Rise and Fall of the Confederacy.\" At her death, which occurred\r\nat New Orleans, whither she had gone for treatment, she left\r\n\"Beauvoir\" by will to Mr. Davis and his daughter Winnie.\r\n\r\nHer \"Life of Allen\" is of great historical and biographical merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Recollections of Henry Watkins Allen, of Louisiana.\r\n    Lucia Dare, [novel].\r\n    Atalie, or a Southern Villeggiatura.\r\n    Agnes Graham, [novel].\r\n    Panola, a Tale of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONFEDERATE EXILE ON HIS WAY TO MEXICO, 1866.\r\n\r\n(_From Recollections of Henry W. Allen, Ex-Gov. of Louisiana._[26])\r\n\r\nThe people wept over Allen's departure. They followed him with tears\r\nand blessings, and would have forced on him more substantial tokens of\r\nregard than words of regret. They knew he had no money--his noble\r\nestates had long been in possession of the enemy; hundreds of\r\nhogsheads of sugar had been carried off from his plundered\r\nsugar-houses; his house was burned, his plantation, a wide waste of\r\nfallow-fields, grown up in weeds. He had nothing but Confederate and\r\nState money. One gentleman begged him to accept $5,000, in gold, _as a\r\nloan_, since he refused it as a gift. Allen accepted five hundred.\r\nWith this small amount, his ambulance and riding-horses, he started to\r\nMexico. His journey through Texas was a complete ovation, instead of a\r\nhegira. Everybody, rich and poor, vied with each other in offering\r\nhim attention and the most eager hospitality. The roof was deemed\r\nhonored that sheltered his head for the night. He stopped at Crockett,\r\nto say \"goodbye.\"\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis conversation occurred whilst we were returning from a visit to\r\nGov. Moore's family. I had driven over to their cottage in a buggy, to\r\ninvite them to join us at dinner. Allen had accompanied me. . . .\r\nThese exiles were personal friends of mine. I suffered in parting with\r\nthem: for some I suffer still--for those who are still absent and\r\nstill living! Everything was very quiet and still, nothing audible but\r\nthe low murmur of our voices, when suddenly arose from the prairie\r\nbeyond us, one of the beautiful, plaintive, cattle or \"salt\" songs of\r\nTexas. These wild simple melodies had a great attraction for me. I\r\nwould often check my horse on the prairies, and keep him motionless\r\nfor a half-hour, listening to these sweet, melancholy strains. Like\r\nall cattle-calls, they are chiefly minor. I thought them quite as\r\nsingular and beautiful as the Swiss _Ranz des Vaches_, or the Swedish\r\ncattle-calls. They consisted of a few chanted words, with a cadence\r\nand a long _yodl_. Sometimes the yodling was aided by what the Texan\r\nboys called \"quills\"--two or more pipes made of reed--_cane_\r\n(arundinaria macrosperma). This made a sort of limited syrinx, which\r\ngave wonderful softness and flute-like clearness to the prolonged\r\ntones of the voice, as it was breathed into them. The boy sang one of\r\nhis saddest \"calls.\" I looked quickly to see if Gov. Allen had noticed\r\nthe melancholy words and mournful air. I saw he had. He ceased\r\ntalking, and his face was very grave.\r\n\r\nThe boy sang:\r\n\r\n    \"Going away to leave you,\r\n        Ah-a-a-a--\r\n    Going away to leave you,\r\n        Ah-a-a-a--\r\n    Going away to-morrow,\r\n        Ah-a-a-a--\r\n    Going away to-morrow,\r\n        Ah-a-a-a--\r\n    Never more to see you,\r\n        Ah-a-a-a--\r\n    Never more to see you,\r\n        Ah a-a-a.\"\r\n\r\n[Music: Go-ing a-way, Go-ing a-way,\r\n        Going a-way to leave you, Ah-a-a-a.\r\n        Going a-way to leave you, Ah-a-a.]\r\n\r\nThis had always been an affecting strain to me; it was doubly so under\r\nthe existing circumstances. The song died mournfully away. We drove on\r\nin silence for a few moments. Gov. Allen roused himself, with a sigh:\r\n\"That boy's song is very sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he sings it very frequently. He knows nothing about you. It\r\nis neither a prophecy nor intended to be sympathetic,--you need not\r\nmake special application of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but it may prove a strange coincidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shan't say that. I won't listen to such a thought. You'll only\r\nspend a pleasant summer travelling in Mexico. We'll see you at the\r\nopera in New Orleans, next winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so.\"\r\n\r\nOur conversation reverted now to past years. Allen spoke of his early\r\nfriends among my relatives; of his whole career in Louisiana; of his\r\nwife, with tenderness,--[she had died in 1850], of her beauty and her\r\nlove for him. His future was so uncertain--that he scarcely alluded to\r\nthat--never with any hopefulness. It was only in the past that he\r\nseemed to find repose of spirit. The present was too sad, the future\r\ntoo shadowy for any discussion of either . . .\r\n\r\nDuring this last visit, I never renewed my arguments against his\r\nquitting the country. I had already said and written all that I had to\r\nsay on that subject . . . . .\r\n\r\nBesides, our minds were in such a confused state, we scarcely knew\r\nwhat any of us had to expect from the victorious party, or what would\r\nbecome of our whole people. So that in urging him not to leave\r\nLouisiana, I argued more from instinct, which revolted at anything\r\nlike an abandonment of a post of duty, and from a temperament which\r\nalways sought rather to advance to meet and defy danger, than to turn\r\nand avoid it, than from any well-grounded assurance or hope of\r\nsecurity for him, or any one else. I felt more anxiety for his\r\nreputation, for his fame, than for his life and freedom. His natural\r\ninstincts would have induced similar views; but his judgment and\r\nfeelings were overpowered by the reasonings and entreaties of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[26] By permission of J.

His\r\nson Henry, the \"blue-eyed Harry\" of the father's poem studied law\r\nwith the distinguished James Louis Petigru, but never practiced and\r\nsoon gave it up to prepare himself for a teacher. He spent ten years\r\nas private tutor in families, writing at the same time. Some of his\r\npoems are found in the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" with the\r\nsignature \"Aglaüs.\"\r\n\r\nHis vacations were spent in Charleston, where he was one of the\r\ncoterie of young writers whom William Gilmore Simms, like a literary\r\nNestor, gathered about him in his hospitable home. His schoolmate,\r\nPaul Hamilton Hayne, was one of these, and their early friendship grew\r\nstronger with the passing years.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Timrod removed to Columbia, published a volume of poems which\r\nwere well received North and South, and undertook editorial work. Life\r\nseemed fair before him. But ill-health and the war which destroyed his\r\nproperty and blighted his career, soon darkened all his prospects, and\r\nafter a brave struggle with poverty and sickness, he died of\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\nHis poems are singularly free from sadness and bitterness. They have\r\nbeen collected and published with a sketch of his life by his friend,\r\nPaul Hamilton Hayne.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Poems.[27]\r\n    Prose Articles in the \"South Carolinian.\"\r\n\r\nOf all our poets none stands higher than Henry Timrod. His singing is\r\ntrue and musical, and his thoughts are pure and noble. A tardy\r\nrecognition seems at last coming to bless his memory, and his poems\r\nare in demand.

His fortune was ample, but\r\nhe studied law although he never practised. He became editor of\r\n\"Russell's Magazine\" and a contributor to the \"Southern Literary\r\nMessenger.\" His genius and lovely nature made him a favorite with all\r\nof his companions, among whom were notably William Gilmore Simms and\r\nHenry Timrod.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, he served in the Confederate Army; his entire\r\nproperty, the inheritance of several generations, was destroyed in the\r\nbombardment of Charleston. From 1865 till his death he resided at\r\n\"Copse Hill,\" a small cottage home in the pine hills near Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, \"keeping the wolf from the door only by the point of his\r\npen,\" dearly honored and loved by all who knew him or his poems.\r\n\r\nHis son, William H. Hayne, is also a poet of much ability, and has\r\npublished a volume of \"Sylvan Lyrics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Poems containing Sonnets Avolio Lyrics Mountain of the Lovers.\r\n        Preceded by a Sketch of the Poet by Mrs. M.

The splendid\r\nchariots of the gentry roll up to the stand, and group themselves\r\naround it, in a position to overlook the race-course, and through the\r\nwide windows are seen the sparkling eyes and powdered locks, and\r\ndiamonds and gay silk and velvet dresses of those fair dames who lent\r\nsuch richness and picturesque beauty to the old days dead now so long\r\nago in the far past. The fine-looking old planters too are decked in\r\ntheir holiday suits, their powdered hair is tied into queues behind\r\nwith neat black ribbon, and they descend and mingle with their\r\nneighbors, and discuss the coming festival.\r\n\r\nGay youths, in rich brilliant dresses, caracole up to the carriages on\r\nfiery steeds, to display their horsemanship, and exchange compliments\r\nwith their friends, and make pretty speeches, which are received by\r\nthe bright-eyed damsels with little ogles, and flirts of their\r\nvariegated fans, and rapturous delight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the crowd grows each moment, as the flood pours in from the\r\nnorth, the south, the east, the west--from every point of the compass,\r\nand in every species of vehicle. There are gay parties of the yeomen\r\nand their wives and daughters, in carryalls and wagons filled with\r\nstraw, upon which chairs are placed: there are rollicking fast men--if\r\nwe may use a word becoming customary in our own day--who whirl in, in\r\ntheir curricles: there are barouches and chairs, spring wagons and\r\ncarts, all full, approaching in every way from a sober walk to a\r\nfurious headlong dash, all \"going to the races.\" There are horsemen\r\nwho lean forward, horsemen who lean back; furious, excited horsemen\r\nurging their steeds with whip and spur; cool, quiet horsemen, who ride\r\nerect and slowly; there are, besides, pedestrians of every class and\r\nappearance, old and young, male and female, black and white--all going\r\nto the races.\r\n\r\nThe hour at last arrives, and a horn sounding from the judges' stand,\r\nthe horses are led out in their blankets and head-coverings, and\r\nwalked up and down before the crowd by their trainers, who are for the\r\nmost part old gray-headed negroes, born and raised, to the best of\r\ntheir recollection, on the turf. The riders are noble scions of the\r\nsame ancient stock, and average three feet and a half in height, and\r\ntwenty pounds in weight. They are clad in ornamental garments; wear\r\nlittle close-fitting caps; and while they are waiting, sit huddled up\r\nin the grass, sucking their thumbs, and talking confidentially about\r\n\"them there hosses.\"\r\n\r\nLet us look at the objects of their attention; they are well worth it.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard enters the bay horse _Sir Archy_, out of Flying Dick, by\r\nRoderick.\r\n\r\nMr. James enters _Fair Anna_, a white mare, dam Virginia, sire\r\nBelgrave.\r\n\r\nCaptain Waters enters the Arabian horse _Selim_, descended in a direct\r\nline, he is informed, from Al-borak, who carried the prophet Mahomet\r\nup to heaven--though this pedigree is not vouched for. The said\r\npedigree is open to the inspection of all comers. _Note_--That it is\r\nwritten in Arabic.\r\n\r\nThere are other entries, but not much attention is paid to them. The\r\nrace will be between Sir Archy and Fair Anna, and perhaps the\r\noutlandish horse will not be \"distanced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prepare the horses!\" comes from the judges' stand opposite.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ralph Waters leaves the ladies with a gallant bow, and pushes\r\nhis way through the swaying and excited crowd, toward the spot where\r\nthe animals are being saddled.\r\n\r\nA tremendous hurly-burly reigns there; men of all classes, boys,\r\nnegroes, gentlemen, indented servants,--all are betting with intense\r\ninterest. The dignified grooms endeavor to keep back the crowd:--the\r\nowners of the horses give their orders to the microscopic monkeys who\r\nare to ride. . . . . . The riders are raised by one leg into the\r\nsaddles; they gather up the reins; the drum taps; they are off like\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThe course is a mile in circumference, and they go round it before the\r\nexcited crowd can look at them a dozen times. They whirl past the\r\nstand, and push on again.\r\n\r\nSir Archy leads; Fair Anna trails on a hard rein; the Arabian is two\r\nlengths behind; but he is not running.\r\n\r\nThey thunder up the quarter stretch: Sir Archy is bounding, like some\r\ndiabolical monster, far before his companions, spite of his owner's\r\ncries; the Arabian has come up and locks the mare; they run neck and\r\nneck. Sir Archy whirls past the stand, and wins by a hundred yards.\r\nThe immense crowd utters a shout that shakes the surrounding\r\nforest. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe horses are again enveloped in their hoods and blankets. Captain\r\nRalph returns to the Riverhead carriage, [that of the Lees, in which\r\nwere Miss Henrietta Lee and her sister Clare.]\r\n\r\n\"Any more betting, sir?\" says Miss Henrietta, satirically.\r\n\r\n\"Who, I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly!\" says the Captain; \"do not think, _chere ma'm'selle_, that\r\nI am very much cast down. I am so far from that, I assure you, that I\r\nam ready to take the field again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will bet again, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Bien!_ I now stake all that is left me in the world--though not\r\nquite. I stake my horse, Selim, against the curl and the pair of\r\ngloves you wear, with the knot of ribbons at your girdle thrown\r\nin--all upon the final issue.\"\r\n\r\nHenrietta blushes; for, however common such gallant proposals were at\r\nthat day, she cannot misunderstand the meaning of the soldier's\r\nglance, and reddens beneath it.\r\n\r\n\"That would be unfair, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, my dear madam, for are you not sure to lose?\"\r\n\r\n\"To lose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I am sure to win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! you ladies have such a delicious little confidence in the things\r\nyou patronize, that it is really astonishing. You think Sir Archy will\r\nbeat Selim? Pshaw! you know nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\nThis piques madam Henrietta, and she smiles satirically again as she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I do not want your pretty horse--but if you insist, why, I\r\ncannot retreat. I shall, at least, have the pleasure of returning him\r\nto his master.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain shakes his head.\r\n\r\n\"A bet upon such terms is no bet at all, my dearest madam,\" he says,\r\n\"for, I assure you, if I win, you will return home curl-less,\r\nglove-less, and ribbon-less. All is fair in war--and love.\"\r\n\r\nWith which words, Captain Ralph darts a martial ogle at his companion.\r\nThis piques her more than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" she replies, \"if you are determined, have your desire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cries the Captain, \"we are just in time. There is the\r\nhorse.\" . . . . . . And, with another gallant bow, the Captain rides\r\naway towards the horses. . . .\r\n\r\nThe boys are again instructed much after the same fashion: the signal\r\nis given in the midst of breathless suspense, and the horses dart from\r\ntheir places.\r\n\r\nThey dart around, Sir Archy again leading: but this position he does\r\nnot hold throughout the first mile: he gradually falls behind, and\r\nwhen they pass the winning-post he is fifty yards in the rear. His\r\nowner tears his hair, but the crowd do not see him--they flush and\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nThe second mile is between Fair Anna and the Arabian, and they lock in\r\nthe middle of it; but the Arabian gradually takes the lead, and when\r\nthey flash up to the stand he is ten yards ahead. Sir Archy is\r\ndistanced and withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to describe the excitement of the crowd:--the\r\ntremendous effect produced upon them by this reversal of all their\r\nhopes and expectations. They roll about like waves, they shout, they\r\ncurse, they rumble and groan like a stormy sea.\r\n\r\nThe horses are the objects of every one's attention. Their condition\r\nwill go far to indicate the final result--and Sir Archy being led away\r\nand withdrawn, the race now will be between Fair Anna and the Arabian.\r\n\r\nMr. James looks more solemn than ever, and all eyes are turned upon\r\nhim. Captain Waters is not visible--he is yonder, conversing with the\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nBut the horses! Fair Anna pants and breathes heavily: her coat is\r\ndrenched more completely than before with perspiration; her mouth\r\nfoams; she tosses her head; when the rake is applied to her back a\r\nshower falls.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian is wet all over too; but he breathes regularly; his eye is\r\nbright and his head calm. He has commenced running. The first\r\nintention of Mr. James is to give up the race, but his pride will not\r\nlet him. He utters an oath, and gives renewed instructions to his\r\nrider. These instructions are to whip and spur--to take the lead and\r\nkeep it, from the start.\r\n\r\nThe moment for the final struggle arrives, and Captain Ralph merely\r\nsays, \"Rein free!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys mount--the crowd opens; the drum taps and the animals are off\r\nlike lightning.\r\n\r\nFair Anna feels that all her previous reputation is at stake, and\r\nflies like a deer. She passes around the first mile like a flash of\r\nwhite light; but the Arabian is beside her. For a quarter of a mile\r\nthereafter they run neck and neck--the rider of fair Anna lashes and\r\nspurs desperately.\r\n\r\nThey come up to the quarter-stretch in the last mile at supernatural\r\nspeed:--the spectators rise on their toes and shout:--two shadows pass\r\nthem like the shadows of darting hawks:--the mare barely saves her\r\ndistance and the Arabian has triumphed.\r\n\r\nIf we could not describe the excitement after the second heat, what\r\npossibility is there that we could convey an idea of the raging and\r\nsurging pandemonium which the crowd now came to resemble? Furious\r\ncries--shouts--curses--applause--laughter--and the rattle of coin\r\nleaving unwilling hands are some of the sounds. But here we must give\r\nup:--as no mere pen can describe the raging of a great mass of water\r\nlashed by an angry wind into foam and whistling spray and muttering\r\nwaves, which rise and fall and crash incessantly, so we cannot trace\r\nthe outline of the wildly excited crowd.\r\n\r\n[Afterwards come contests with the quarter-staff, a wrestling match,\r\nrunning matches, a contest of singing among \"a dozen blushing\r\nmaidens,\" and of fiddling among twenty bold musicians: and the day is\r\nwound up with a great banquet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[29] By permission of D.

He studied law and began its practice in Asheville.\r\nHe was soon elected to the State Legislature and to Congress; and from\r\n1854 to his death was continuously in public life except just after\r\nthe war. His wit and eloquence made him a great favorite both on the\r\nstump and in Congress, and the influence he wielded in his state was\r\nunbounded. He was opposed to secession, but joined his state in her\r\ndecision and became colonel of the 26th North Carolina Regiment, one\r\nof the best of the army.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 he was elected governor of the State and was so active and\r\nenterprising in getting aid by sea for the cause that he was called\r\nthe \"War Governor of the South.\" He was in favor of considering the\r\nnegotiations for peace in 1863, but he neglected no measures to insure\r\nthe success of the Confederacy. In 1865 he was held a prisoner of war\r\nfor a few weeks in Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~State Capitol of North Carolina.~]\r\n\r\nHis political disabilities were not removed till 1872; in 1876 he was\r\nelected governor of North Carolina, and in 1879, United States\r\nSenator, having been elected and his seat refused him in 1870.

C.; published in \"Land We Love\" January, 1867._)\r\n\r\nVirginia to the north of us was settled by English Cavaliers; South\r\nCarolina, mainly by French Huguenots, both among the noblest stocks of\r\nWestern Europe. North Carolina, with but a slight infusion of each,\r\nwas settled by a sturdier--and in some respects--a better race than\r\neither. She was emphatically the offspring of religious and political\r\npersecution, and the vital stream of her infant life was of\r\nScotch-Irish origin. A cross of those two noble races has produced a\r\nbreed of men as renowned for great deeds and modest worth as perhaps\r\nany other in this world. Two instances will suffice for this. Perhaps\r\nthe most manly and glorious feat of arms in modern times was the\r\ndefence of Londonderry, as the boldest and most remarkable state paper\r\nwas the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Both were the work\r\nmainly of men such as settled North Carolina.\r\n\r\n_The Country Gentlemen._--Perhaps one of the most remarkable changes\r\nwhich we may expect, is one that will soon be apparent on the face of\r\nour country society. The abolition of slavery will do wonders here. It\r\nputs an end to the reign of those lordly-landed proprietors, planters,\r\nand farmers, who constituted so striking and so pleasant a feature in\r\nour rural population. No longer the masters of hundreds of slaves\r\nwherewith to cultivate their thousands of acres, the general cheapness\r\nof lands in the South will prevent their forming around them a system\r\nof dependent tenantry, since every industrious man will be able to\r\nplough his own farm. They will therefore gradually sell off their\r\npaternal acres, no longer within the scope of prudent management, and\r\nseek homes in the towns and villages, or contract their establishments\r\nto their means and altered condition. Agriculture will then pass\r\ngradually into the hands of small farmers, and the great farms will\r\nforever disappear.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely imagine it possible for any one to view the steady\r\ndisappearance of the race of Southern country gentlemen without\r\ngenuine sorrow . . . the high-toned, educated, chivalrous,\r\nintelligent, and hospitable Southern gentlemen, of whom each one who\r\nhears me has at least a dozen in his mind's eye in Virginia and the\r\nCarolinas: whose broad fields were cultivated by their own faithful\r\nand devoted slaves, whose rudely splendid mansions stand where their\r\nfathers reared them, among the oaks and the pines which greeted the\r\ncanoe of John Smith, welcomed the ships of Raleigh, and sheltered the\r\nwild cavaliers of De Soto; whose hall doors stood wide open, and were\r\nnever shut except against a retreating guest;[30] whose cellar and\r\ntable abounded with the richest products of the richest lands in the\r\nworld, and whose hospitality was yet unstained by unrefined excess;\r\nwhose parlors and fire-sides were adorned by a courtly female grace\r\nwhich might vie with any that ever lighted and blessed the home of\r\nman; whose hands were taught from infancy to fly open to every\r\ngenerous and charitable appeal, and whose minds were inured to all\r\nself-respect and toleration, and whose strong brains were sudden death\r\nto humbuggery, all the _isms_, and the whole family of mean and\r\npestilential fanaticism.\r\n\r\n_The Negroes._--There is also a great change at hand for the\r\nnegro. . . Who that knew him as a contented, well-treated slave, did\r\nnot learn to love and admire the negro character? I, for one, confess\r\nto almost an enthusiasm on the subject. The cheerful ring of their\r\nsongs at their daily tasks, their love for their masters and their\r\nfamilies, their politeness and good manners, their easily bought but\r\nsincere gratitude, their deep-seated aristocracy--for your genuine\r\nnegro was a terrible aristocrat,--their pride in their own and their\r\nmaster's dignity, together with their overflowing and never-failing\r\nanimal spirits, both during hours of labor and leisure, altogether,\r\nmade up an aggregation of joyous simplicity and fidelity--when not\r\nperverted by harsh treatment--that to me was irresistible!\r\n\r\nA remembrance of the seasons spent among them will perish only with\r\nlife. From the time of the ingathering of the crops, until after the\r\nushering in of the new year, was wont to be with them a season of\r\ngreater joy and festivity than with any other people on earth, of whom\r\nit has been my lot to hear. In the glorious November nights of our\r\nbeneficent clime, after the first frosts had given a bracing sharpness\r\nand a ringing clearness to the air, and lent that transparent blue to\r\nthe heavens through which the stars gleam like globes of sapphire,\r\nwhen I have seen a hundred or more of them around the swelling piles\r\nof corn, and heard their tuneful voices ringing with the chorus of\r\nsome wild refrain, I have thought I would rather far listen to them\r\nthan to any music ever sung to mortal ears; for it was the outpouring\r\nof the hearts of happy and contented men, rejoicing over the abundance\r\nwhich rewarded the labor of the closing year! And the listening, too,\r\nhas many a time and oft filled my bosom with emotions, and opened my\r\nheart with charity and love toward this subject and dependent race,\r\nsuch as no oratory, no rhetoric or minstrelsy in all this wide earth\r\ncould impart!\r\n\r\nNature ceased almost to feel fatigue in the joyous scenes which\r\nfollowed. The fiddle and the banjo, animated as it would seem like\r\nliving things, literally knew no rest, night or day; while Terpichore\r\ncovered her face in absolute despair in the presence of that famous\r\n_double-shuffle_ with which the long nights and \"master's shoes\" were\r\nworn away together! . . . .\r\n\r\nWho can forget the cook by whom his youthful appetite was fed? The\r\nfussy, consequential old lady to whom I now refer, has often, during\r\nmy vagrant inroads into her rightful domains, boxed my infant jaws,\r\nwith an imperious, \"Bress de Lord, git out of de way: dat chile never\r\nkin git enuff\": and as often relenting at sight of my hungry tears,\r\nhas fairly bribed me into her love again with the very choicest bits\r\nof the savory messes of her art. She was haughty as Juno, and\r\naristocratic as though her naked ancestors had come over with the\r\nConqueror, or \"drawn a good bow at Hastings,\" . . . and yet her pride\r\ninvariably melted at the sight of certain surreptitious quantities of\r\ntobacco, with which I made my court to this high priestess of the\r\nregion sacred to the stomach.\r\n\r\nAnd there, too, plainest of all, I can see the fat and chubby form of\r\nmy dear old nurse, whose encircling arms of love fondled and supported\r\nme from the time whereof the memory of this man runneth not to the\r\ncontrary. All the strong love of her simple and faithful nature seemed\r\nbestowed on her mistress' children, which she was not permitted to\r\ngive to her own, long, long ago left behind and dead in \"ole\r\nVarginney.\" Oh! the wonderful and touching stories of them, and a\r\nhundred other things, which she has poured into my infant ears! How\r\nwell do I remember the marvellous story of the manner in which she\r\nobtained religion, of her many and sore conflicts with the powers of\r\ndarkness, and of her first dawning hopes in that blessed gospel whose\r\nrichest glory is, that it is preached to the poor, such as she was!\r\nFrom her lips, too, I heard my first ghost-story! Think of that! None\r\nof your feeble make-believes of a ghost-story either, carrying\r\ninfidelity on its face; but a real bona-fide narrative, witnessed by\r\nherself, and told with the earnestness of truth itself. How my knees\r\nsmote together, and my hair stood on end, \"so called\"--as I stared and\r\nstartled, and declared again and again with quite a sickly manhood\r\nindeed, that _I wasn't scared a bit_!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the proudest day of my boyhood was when I was able to present\r\nher with a large and flaming red cotton handkerchief, wherewith in\r\nturban style she adorned her head. And my satisfaction was complete\r\nwhen my profound erudition enabled me to read for her on Sabbath\r\nafternoons that most wonderful of all stories, the Pilgrim's Progress.\r\nNor was it uninstructive, or a slight tribute to the genius of the\r\nimmortal tinker--could I but have appreciated it--to observe the\r\nvaried emotions excited within her breast by the recital of those\r\nfearful conflicts by the way, and of the unspeakable glories of the\r\ncelestial City, within whose portals of pearl I trust her faithful\r\nsoul has long since entered!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[30] As in the case of the gentleman for whom Senator Vance's native\r\ncounty was named.

It has a classic ring\r\nand reminds one of Keats' Odes on the Nightingale and on a Grecian\r\nUrn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MOCKING-BIRD.\r\n\r\n    Thou glorious mocker of the world! I hear\r\n      Thy many voices ringing through the glooms\r\n    Of these green solitudes; and all the clear,\r\n    Bright joyance of their song enthralls the ear,\r\n      And floods the heart. Over the spherèd tombs\r\n    Of vanished nations rolls thy music-tide;\r\n      No light from History's starlit page illumes\r\n    The memory of these nations; they have died:\r\n      None care for them but thou; and thou mayst sing\r\n      O'er me, perhaps, as now thy clear notes ring\r\n    Over their bones by whom thou once wast deified.\r\n\r\n    Glad scorner of all cities! Thou dost leave\r\n      The world's mad turmoil and incessant din,\r\n    Where none in other's honesty believe,\r\n    Where the old sigh, the young turn gray and grieve,\r\n      Where misery gnaws the maiden's heart within:\r\n    Thou fleest far into the dark green woods,\r\n      Where, with thy flood of music, thou canst win\r\n    Their heart to harmony, and where intrudes\r\n      No discord on thy melodies. Oh, where,\r\n      Among the sweet musicians of the air,\r\n    Is one so dear as thou to these old solitudes?\r\n\r\n    Ha! what a burst was that! The Æolian strain\r\n      Goes floating through the tangled passages\r\n    Of the still woods, and now it comes again,\r\n    A multitudinous melody,--like a rain\r\n      Of glassy music under echoing trees,\r\n    Close by a ringing lake. It wraps the soul\r\n      With a bright harmony of happiness,\r\n    Even as a gem is wrapped when round it roll\r\n      Thin waves of crimson flame; till we become\r\n      With the excess of perfect pleasure, dumb,\r\n    And pant like a swift runner clinging to the goal.\r\n\r\n    I cannot love the man who doth not love,\r\n      As men love light, the song of happy birds;\r\n    For the first visions that my boy-heart wove\r\n    To fill its sleep with, were that I did rove\r\n      Through the fresh woods, what time the snowy herds\r\n    Of morning clouds shrunk from the advancing sun\r\n      Into the depths of Heaven's blue heart, as words\r\n    From the Poet's lips float gently, one by one,\r\n      And vanish in the human heart; and then\r\n      I revelled in such songs, and sorrowed when,\r\n    With noon-heat overwrought, the music-gush was done.\r\n\r\n    I would, sweet bird, that I might live with thee,\r\n      Amid the eloquent grandeur of these shades,\r\n    Alone with nature,--but it may not be;\r\n    I have to struggle with the stormy sea\r\n      Of human life until existence fades\r\n    Into death's darkness. Thou wilt sing and soar\r\n      Through the thick woods and shadow-checkered glades,\r\n    While pain and sorrow cast no dimness o'er\r\n      The brilliance of thy heart; but I must wear,\r\n      As now, my garments of regret and care,--\r\n    As penitents of old their galling sackcloth wore.\r\n\r\n    Yet why complain? What though fond hopes deferred\r\n      Have overshadowed Life's green paths with gloom?\r\n    Content's soft music is not all unheard;\r\n    There is a voice sweeter than thine, sweet bird,\r\n      To welcome me within my humble home;\r\n    There is an eye, with love's devotion bright,\r\n      The darkness of existence to illume.\r\n    Then why complain? When Death shall cast his blight\r\n      Over the spirit, my cold bones shall rest\r\n      Beneath these trees; and, from thy swelling breast,\r\n    Over them pour thy song, like a rich flood of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TAPPAN THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n~1812=1882.~\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM TAPPAN THOMPSON was a native of Ravenna, Ohio, the first white\r\nchild born in the Western Reserve.

It was monstrous\r\nunhandy to git to it, but I was termined not to back out. So I sot\r\nsome chairs on top of a bench, and got hold of the rope, and let\r\nmyself down into the bag; but jist as I was gittin in, it swung agin\r\nthe chairs, and down they went with a terrible racket; but nobody\r\ndin't wake up but Miss Stallinses old cur dog, and here he come rippin\r\nand tearin through the yard like rath, and round and round he went,\r\ntryin to find out what was the matter. I scrooch'd down in the bag,\r\nand didn't breathe louder nor a kitten, for fear he'd find me out;\r\nand after a while he quit barkin.\r\n\r\nThe wind begun to blow bominable cold, and the old bag kept turnin\r\nround and swingin so it made me sea-sick as the mischief. I was afraid\r\nto move for fear the rope would break and let me fall, and thar I sot\r\nwith my teeth rattlin like I had a ager. It seemed like it would never\r\ncome daylight, and I do believe if I didn't love Miss Mary so powerful\r\nI would froze to death; for my heart was the only spot that felt warm,\r\nand it didn't beat more'n two licks a minit, only when I thought how\r\nshe would be supprised in the mornin, and then it went in a canter.\r\nBimeby the cussed old dog came up on the porch and begun to smell\r\nabout the bag, and then he barked like he thought he'd treed\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"Bow! wow! wow!\" ses he. Then he'd smell agin, and try to git up to\r\nthe bag. \"Git out!\" ses I, very low, for fear the galls mought hear\r\nme. \"Bow! wow!\" ses he. \"Begone! you bominable fool!\" ses I, and I\r\nfelt all over in spots, for I spected every minit he'd nip me, and\r\nwhat made it worse, I didn't know wharabouts he'd take hold. \"Bow!\r\nwow! wow!\" Then I tried coaxin--\"Come here, good feller,\" ses I, and\r\nwhistled a little to him, but it wasn't no use. Thar he stood, and kep\r\nup his everlastin barkin and whinin, all night. I couldn't tell when\r\ndaylight was breakin, only by the chickens crowin, and I was monstrous\r\nglad to hear 'em, for if I'd had to stay thar one hour more, I don't\r\nbelieve I'd ever got out of that bag alive.\r\n\r\nOld Miss Stallins come out fust, and as soon as she seed the bag, ses\r\nshe: \"What upon yeath has Joseph went and put in that bag for Mary?\r\nI'll lay it's a yearlin or some live animal, or Bruin wouldn't bark at\r\nit so.\"\r\n\r\nShe went in to call the galls, and I sot thar, shiverin all over so I\r\ncouldn't hardly speak if I tried to,--but I didn't say nothin. Bimeby\r\nthey all come runnin out on the porch.\r\n\r\n\"My goodness! what is it?\" ses Miss Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's alive!\" ses Miss Kesiah. \"I seed it move.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call Cato, and make him cut the rope,\" ses Miss Carline, \"and let's\r\nsee what it is. Come here, Cato, and get this bag down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurt it for the world,\" ses Miss Mary.\r\n\r\nCato untied the rope that was round the jice, and let the bag down\r\neasy on the floor, and I tumbled out, all covered with corn-meal from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness gracious!\" ses Miss Mary, \"if it ain't the Majer himself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" ses I, \"and you know you promised to keep my Crismus present as\r\nlong as you lived.\"\r\n\r\nThe galls laughed themselves almost to death, and went to brushin off\r\nthe meal as fast as they could, sayin they was gwine to hang that bag\r\nup every Crismus till they got husbands too. Miss Mary--bless her\r\nbright eyes!--she blushed as beautiful as a mornin-glory, and sed\r\nshe'd stick to her word. . . . I do believe if I was froze stiff, one\r\nlook at her sweet face, as she stood thar lookin down to the floor\r\nwith her roguish eyes, and her bright curls fallin all over her snowy\r\nneck, would have fotched me to. I tell you what, it was worth hangin\r\nin a meal bag from one Crismus to another to feel as happy as I have\r\never sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[31] By permission of T. B.

In brief, then, Nature is\r\nan effect--a product--of a Power lying behind or above it; and it\r\nstands, accordingly, to that Power in the relation of an effect to a\r\ncause. That cause we shall describe as Spiritual; the effect, as\r\nNatural. The Natural, or Nature, is the material Universe embracing\r\nthe three kingdoms, known as mineral, vegetable, and animal. . . . .\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, everything in nature is a correspondent of some\r\nthing--is expressive of and consequently representative and\r\nexponential of something--above it or behind it; and that something is\r\nan idea--a thing not material. It follows, then, that every object in\r\nnature has real character in itself as a representative of an idea;\r\njust as, say, an anchor is representative of hope, a heart, of love,\r\nan olive branch, of peace, and a ring, of marriage. . .\r\n\r\nWe next come to consider the percipient mind. Men's minds have limited\r\nand imperfect faculties and capabilities. That which is good, or true,\r\nor beautiful, to one mind can hardly be the same in the same way and\r\ndegree to any other mind. It is true--as some writers have stated, but\r\nnone seems willing to push the propositions to their legitimate\r\nconclusions--that the Good and the Beautiful are true, the Beautiful\r\nand the True are good, and the True and the Good are beautiful. We\r\nwish to accept the propositions in their most comprehensive scope and\r\nwith all their legitimate consequences.\r\n\r\nLet us note, at this point, the fact, obvious enough but generally\r\noverlooked, that in perception the result depends far more upon the\r\npercipient mind than upon the object perceived. To a ploughboy, a\r\npebble is an insignificant thing, suggestive possibly of some\r\ndiscomfort in walking, and fit only to shy at a bird, may be; but to\r\nthe geologist it appears worthy a volume, and speaks to him of strata\r\nmay be a million of years old, of glacial attrition, of volcanic\r\naction, of chemical constituents, of mineralogical principles, and\r\ncrystallogenic attraction, of mathematical laws and geometric angles,\r\nand of future geognostic changes. That is to say, the pebble contracts\r\nand expands, as it were, with the faculties and the prejudices of the\r\nperson--of the mind--that sees it.\r\n\r\nOr, again: The crescent moon is visible in the clear sky. _A_ sees a\r\nbright convenience which enables him to walk better--not so good a\r\nlight as the full moon would be, but valuable as far as it goes. _B_\r\nsees a lovely luminary to light him to his lady-love, a hallowed eye\r\nhalf shut that watches with protecting radiance over her slumbers. _C_\r\nreckons the intervening 238,000 miles, its diameter of 2,162.3 miles,\r\nand his mind busies itself with orbits, radii, ellipses, eclipses,\r\nazimuth, parallax, sidereal periods, satellitic inclinations, and\r\nsynodic revolutions. _D_, with a turn for symbols and history, sees in\r\nit something of the \"ornaments like the moon\" that Gideon captured\r\nfrom the Sheikhs Zebah and Zalmunna, something of Byzantine siege,\r\nOttoman ensign, the Crusades, the Knighthood of Selim, the battle of\r\nTours, and the city of New Orleans. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe Beautiful . . . . is a relation between the man that sees and the\r\nobject seen. A perfectly harmonious relation brings perfect beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Poetical . . . . is the beautiful; and this may be expressed\r\neither in prose or in poetry. . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nPoetry, more closely defined, is the poetical expressed in rhythmical\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[33] By permission of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES COLCOCK JONES, JR.\r\n\r\n~1831=1893.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES COLCOCK JONES, JR., was born at Savannah, Georgia, and made\r\nhis literary fame by special study of the history of Georgia and the\r\nlife of the Southern Indians.

In the public indignation engendered by their\r\nunjustifiable and inhuman treatment, and in the general desire to\r\nalleviate their sufferings, Oglethorpe and the trustees fully shared.\r\nAn asylum in Georgia was offered.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nForty-two men with their families, numbering in all seventy-eight\r\nsouls, set out on foot for Rotterdam. They came from the town of\r\nBerchtolsgaden and its vicinity. . . . On the 2d of December they\r\nembarked for England. On the 8th of January, 1734 (O. S.), having a\r\nfavorable wind, they departed in the ship _Purisburg_ for Savannah.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . Upon the return of Mr. Oglethorpe and the commissary, Baron Von\r\nReck, [sent to examine the site of the new colony] to Savannah, nine\r\nable-bodied Salzburgers were dispatched, by the way of Abercorn, to\r\nEbenezer, to cut down trees and erect shelters for the new colonists.\r\nOn the 7th of April the rest of the emigrants arrived, and, with the\r\nblessing of the good Mr. Bolzius, entered at once upon the task of\r\nclearing land, constructing bridges, building shanties, and preparing\r\na road-way to Abercorn. Wild honey found in a hollow tree greatly\r\nrefreshed them, and parrots and partridges made them \"a very good\r\ndish.\" Upon the sandy soil they fixed their hopes for a generous yield\r\nof peas and potatoes. To the \"black, fat, and heavy\" land they looked\r\nfor all sorts of corn. From the clayey soil they purposed\r\nmanufacturing bricks and earthenware.\r\n\r\nOn the first of May lots were drawn upon which houses were to be\r\nerected in the town of Ebenezer. The day following, the hearts of the\r\npeople were rejoiced by the coming of ten cows and calves,--sent as a\r\npresent from the magistrates of Savannah in obedience to Mr.\r\nOglethorpe's orders. Ten casks \"full of all Sorts of Seeds\" arriving\r\nfrom Savannah set these pious people to praising God for all his\r\nloving kindnesses. Commiserating their poverty, the Indians gave them\r\ndeer, and their English neighbors taught them how to brew a sort of\r\nbeer made of molasses, sassafras, and pine tops. Poor Lackner dying,\r\nby common consent the little money he left was made the \"Beginning of\r\na Box for the Poor.\" . . . . . . . . By appointment, Monday, the 13th\r\nof May, was observed by the congregation as a season of\r\nthanksgiving. . . . .\r\n\r\nOf the town of Savannah, the Baron Von Reck favors us with the\r\nfollowing impressions: \"I went to view this rising Town, _Savannah_,\r\nseated upon the Banks of a River of the same Name. The Town is\r\nregularly laid out, divided into four Wards, in each of which is left\r\na spacious Square for holding of Markets and other publick Uses. The\r\nStreets are all straight, and the Houses are all of the same Model and\r\nDimensions, and well contrived for Conveniency. For the Time it has\r\nbeen built it is very populous, and its Inhabitants are all White\r\nPeople. And indeed the Blessing of God seems to have gone along with\r\nthis Undertaking, for here we see Industry honored and Justice\r\nstrictly executed, and Luxury and Idleness banished from this happy\r\nPlace where Plenty and Brotherly Love seem to make their Abode, and\r\nwhere the good Order of a Nightly Watch restrains the Disorderly and\r\nmakes the Inhabitants sleep secure in the midst of a Wilderness.\r\n\r\n\"There is laid out near the Town, by order of the Trustees, a Garden\r\nfor making Experiments for the Improving Botany and Agriculture; it\r\ncontains 10 Acres and lies upon the River; and it is cleared and\r\nbrought into such Order that there is already a fine Nursery of\r\nOranges, Olives, white Mulberries, Figs, Peaches, and many curious\r\nHerbs: besides which there are Cabbages, Peas, and other European\r\nPulse and Plants which all thrive. Within the Garden there is an\r\nartificial Hill, said by the Indians to be raised over the Body of one\r\nof their ancient Emperors.\r\n\r\n\"I had like to have forgot one of the best Regulations made by the\r\nTrustees for the Government of the Town of _Savannah_. I mean the\r\nutter Prohibition of the Use of Rum, that flattering but deceitful\r\nLiquor which has been found equally pernicious to the Natives and new\r\nComers, which seldoms fails by Sickness or Death to draw after it its\r\nown Punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[34] By permission of Mr. Charles Edgeworth Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY VIRGINIA TERHUNE.\r\n\r\n~ca. 1831=----.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Mary Washington Monument, Fredericksburg, Va.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS.

There was even a happy\r\nflutter in the playful rejoinder that \"her dancing days were pretty\r\nwell over, but that if her coming would contribute to the general\r\npleasure she would attend.\"\r\n\r\n. . . A path was opened from the foot to the top of the hall as they\r\nappeared in the doorway, and \"every head was bowed in reverence.\" It\r\nmust have been the proudest moment of her life, but she bore herself\r\nwith perfect composure then, and after her son, seating her in an\r\narmchair upon the daïs reserved for distinguished guests, faced the\r\ncrowd in prideful expectancy that all his friends would seek to know\r\nhis mother. She had entered the hall at eight o'clock, and for two\r\nhours held court, the most distinguished people there pressing eagerly\r\nforward to be presented to her. . . . From her slightly elevated\r\nposition, she could, without rising, overlook the floor, and watched\r\nwith quiet pleasure the dancers, among them the kingly figure of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, who led a Fredericksburg matron through a minuet.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, she signed to him to approach, and rose to take his\r\narm, saying in her clear soft voice, \"Come, George, it is time for old\r\nfolks to be at home.\" Smiling a good-night to all, she walked down the\r\nroom, as erect in form and as steady in gait as any dancer there.\r\n\r\nOne of the French officers exclaimed aloud, as she disappeared:\r\n\r\n\"If such are the matrons of America, she may well boast of illustrious\r\nsons!\" . . . . .\r\n\r\nLafayette's report of his interview to his friends at Mt.

Her style has been severely criticised as pedantic,\r\nbut certainly this charge may with equal justice be brought against\r\nGeorge Meredith, Bulwer, and George Eliot, and it is well established\r\nthat Mrs. Wilson's books have in many instances stimulated her young\r\nreaders to study history, mythology, and the sciences, from which she\r\nso frequently draws her illustrations.\"--Miss Rutherford.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEARNED AND INTERESTING CONVERSATION.\r\n\r\n(_From St. Elmo._[36])\r\n\r\nEdna had risen to leave the room when the master of the house entered,\r\nbut at his request resumed her seat and continued reading.\r\n\r\nAfter searching the shelves unavailingly, he glanced over his shoulder\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen my copy of De Guérin's Centaur anywhere about the\r\nhouse? I had it a week ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, for causing such a fruitless search; here is\r\nthe book. I picked it up on the front steps where you were reading a\r\nfew evenings since, and it opened at a passage that attracted my\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed the volume and held it toward him, but he waved it back.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it if it interests you. I have read it once, and merely wished\r\nto refer to a particular passage. Can you guess what sentence most\r\nfrequently recurs to me? If so, read it to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a chair close to the hearth and lighted his cigar.\r\n\r\nHesitatingly Edna turned the leaves.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, sir, that my selection will displease you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will risk it, as, notwithstanding your flattering opinion to the\r\ncontrary, I am not altogether so unreasonable as to take offense at a\r\ncompliance with my own request.\"\r\n\r\nStill she shrank from the task he imposed, and her fingers toyed with\r\nthe scarlet fuchsias; but after eyeing her for a while, he leaned\r\nforward and pushed the glass bowl beyond her reach.\r\n\r\n\"Edna, I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Mr. Murray, I should think that these two passages would\r\nimpress you with peculiar force.\"\r\n\r\nRaising the book, she read with much emphasis:\r\n\r\n\"'Thou pursuest after wisdom, O Melampus! which is the science of the\r\nwill of the gods; _and thou roamest from people to people, like a\r\nmortal driven by the destinies_. In the times when I kept my\r\nnight-watches before the caverns, I have sometimes believed that I was\r\nabout to surprise the thoughts of the sleeping Cybele, and that the\r\nmother of the gods, betrayed by her dreams, would let fall some of her\r\nsecrets. But I have never yet made out more than sounds which faded\r\naway in the murmur of night, or words inarticulate as the bubbling of\r\nthe rivers.' . . . 'Seekest thou to know the gods, O Macareus! and\r\nfrom what source, men, animals, and elements of the universal fire\r\nhave their origin? The aged ocean, the father of all things, keeps\r\nlocked within his own breast these secrets; and the nymphs who stand\r\naround sing as they weave their eternal dance before him, to cover any\r\nsound which might escape from his lips, half opened by slumber.\r\nMortals dear to the gods for their virtue have received from their\r\nhands lyres to give delight to man, or the seeds of new plants to make\r\nhim rich, but from their inexorable lips--nothing!'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Murray, am I correct in my conjecture?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite correct,\" he answered, smiling grimly.\r\n\r\nTaking the book from her hand he threw it on the table, and tossed his\r\ncigar into the grate, adding in a defiant, challenging tone:\r\n\r\n\"The mantle of Solomon did not fall at Le Cayla on the shoulders of\r\nMaurice de Guérin. After all he was a wretched hypochondriac, and a\r\ntinge of _le cahier vert_ doubtless crept into his eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you forget, sir, that he said, 'When one is a wanderer, one feels\r\nthat one fulfils the true condition of humanity?' and that among his\r\nlast words are these, 'The stream of travel is full of delight. Oh!\r\nwho will set me adrift on this Nile?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me if I remind you, _par parenthèse_, of the preliminary and\r\ncourteous _En garde!_ which should be pronounced before a thrust. De\r\nGuérin felt starved in Languedoc, and no wonder! But had he penetrated\r\nevery nook and cranny of the habitable globe, and traversed the vast\r\nzaarahs which science accords the universe, he would have died at last\r\nas hungry as Ugolino. I speak advisedly; for the true Io gad-fly,\r\n_ennui_, has stung me from hemisphere to hemisphere, across\r\ntempestuous oceans, scorching deserts, and icy mountain ranges. I have\r\nfaced alike the bourrans of the steppes, and the Samieli of Shamo, and\r\nthe result of my vandal life is best epitomized in those grand but\r\ngrim words of Bossuet: '_On trouve au fond du tout le vide et le\r\nnéant!_' Nineteen years ago, to satisfy my hunger, I set out to hunt\r\nthe daintiest food this world could furnish, and, like other fools,\r\nhave learned finally, that life is but a huge mellow golden Ösher,\r\nthat mockingly sifts its bitter dust upon our eager lips. Ah! truly,\r\n_on trouve au fond du tout le vide et le néant_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Murray, if you insist upon your bitter Ösher simile, why shut\r\nyour eyes to the palpable analogy suggested? Naturalists assert that\r\nthe Solanum, or apple of Sodom, contains in its normal state neither\r\ndust nor ashes; unless it is punctured by an insect, (the Tenthredo),\r\nwhich converts the whole of the inside into dust, leaving nothing but\r\nthe rind entire, without any loss of color.

He\r\nwas educated at Oglethorpe College, being graduated in 1860. He and\r\nhis brother Clifford entered the Confederate Army together in 1861 and\r\nserved through the war; but the exposure and hardships and\r\nimprisonment developed consumption which finally caused his death.\r\n\r\nAfter the war he lived for two years in Alabama as a clerk and a\r\nteacher; but his health failed and he was forced to return home where\r\nhe practised law with his father till 1873. Then deciding to devote\r\nhimself to music and poetry, he went to Baltimore where he was engaged\r\nas first flute in the Peabody Symphony Concerts and in 1879 as\r\nlecturer on English Literature in Johns Hopkins University. His dread\r\ndisease never relaxed and he was often obliged to quit work and go to\r\nFlorida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania in search of\r\nstrength. His death occurred at Lynn, Polk County, North Carolina, on\r\nhis last quest for strength and life with which to continue the work\r\nhe so much loved.\r\n\r\nHis \"Science of English Verse\" is said to be a new and valuable\r\naddition to the study of poetry. His poems belong to the new order of\r\nthought and life. His \"Tiger-Lilies\" is a prose-poem, written in three\r\nweeks just after the war and laid in the mountains of Tennessee and on\r\nthe eastern shore of Virginia where he was stationed. \"Beauty is\r\nholiness, and holiness is beauty,\" was his favorite remark on the\r\nsubject of Art. His work and influence are growing in importance in\r\nthe regard of students.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 he was invited to write the poem for the Centennial\r\nExposition; and the \"Meditation of Columbia,\" composed with the\r\nmusical expression always in mind,--and so too it should be read,--was\r\nthe grand Ode that graced the opening day at Philadelphia.

There were\r\nthe native little Kentuckians, born in the wilderness--the first wild,\r\nhardy generation of new people; and there were the little folk from\r\nVirginia, from Tennessee, from North Carolina, and from Pennsylvania\r\nand other sources, huddled together, some rude, some gentle, and\r\nstarting out now to be formed into the men and women of the Kentucky\r\nthat was to be.\r\n\r\nThey had their strange, sad, heroic games and pastimes, those\r\nprimitive children under his guidance. Two little girls would be\r\ndriving the cows home about dusk; three little boys would play Indian\r\nand capture them and carry them off; the husbands of the little girls\r\nwould form a party to the rescue; the prisoners would drop pieces of\r\ntheir dresses along the way; and then at a certain point of the\r\nwoods--it being the dead of night now, and the little girls being\r\nbound to a tree, and the Indians having fallen asleep beside their\r\nsmouldering camp-fires--the rescuers would rush in, and there would be\r\nwhoops and shrieks, and the taking of scalps, and a happy return.\r\n\r\nOr, some settlement would be shut up in a fort besieged. Days would\r\npass. The only water was a spring outside the walls, and around this\r\nthe enemy skulked in the corn and grass. But the warriors must not\r\nperish of thirst. So, with a prayer, a tear, a final embrace, the\r\nlittle women marched out through the gates to the spring, in the very\r\nteeth of death, and brought back water in their wooden dinner-buckets.\r\n\r\nOr, when the boys would become men with contests of running, and\r\npitching quoits, and wrestling, the girls would play wives and have a\r\nquilting in a house of green alder-bushes, or be capped and wrinkled\r\ngrandmothers sitting beside imaginary spinning-wheels and smoking\r\nimaginary pipes.\r\n\r\nSometimes it was not Indian warfare, but civil strife. For one morning\r\nas many as three Daniel Boones appeared on the playground at the same\r\nmoment; and at once there was a fierce battle to ascertain which was\r\nthe genuine Daniel. This being decided, the spurious Daniels submitted\r\nto be the one Simon Kenton, the other General George Rogers Clarke.\r\n\r\nThis was to be a great day for what he called his class in history.\r\nThirteen years before, and forty miles away, had occurred the most\r\ndreadful of all the battles--the disaster of the Blue Licks; and in\r\ntown were many mothers who yet wept for sons, widows who yet dreamed\r\nof young husbands, fallen that beautiful August day beneath the oaks\r\nand cedars, or floating down the red-dyed river.\r\n\r\nIt was this that he had promised to tell them at noon; and a little\r\nafter twelve o'clock he was standing with them on the bank of the Town\r\nFork, in order to give vividness to his description. This stream flows\r\nunseen beneath the streets of the city [Lexington] now, and with\r\nscarce current enough to wash out its grimy channels; but then it\r\nflashed broad and clear through the long valley which formed the town\r\ncommon--a valley of scattered houses with orchards and corn-fields and\r\npatches of cane.\r\n\r\nA fine poetic picture he formed as he stood there amid their eager\r\nupturned faces, bare-headed under the cool brilliant sky of May, and\r\nreciting to them, as a prose-minstrel of the wilderness, the deeds of\r\ntheir fathers.\r\n\r\nThis Town Fork of the Elkhorn, he said, must represent the Licking\r\nRiver. On that side were the Indians; on this, the pioneers, a crowd\r\nof foot and horse. There stretched the ridge of rocks, made bare by\r\nthe stamping of the buffalo; here was the clay they licked for salt.\r\nIn that direction headed the two ravines in which Boone had feared an\r\nambuscade. And thus variously having made ready for battle, and\r\nlooking down for a moment into the eyes of a freckly impetuous little\r\nsoul who was the Hotspur of the playground, he repeated the cry of\r\nMcGary, which had been the signal for attack:\r\n\r\n\"Let all who are not cowards follow me!\"\r\n\r\n[Hereupon the soldiers plunged through the river, not seeing the\r\nIndians nor even knowing where they were; and in a few minutes they\r\nwere attacked and completely routed by the Indians who were concealed\r\nin the woods and ravines of the other bank, as Boone had feared.\r\nBoone's son was killed, and he himself narrowly escaped by dashing\r\nthrough one of the ravines and swimming the river lower down. The\r\nslaughter in the river was great, and the pursuit was continued for\r\ntwenty miles. Never had Kentucky experienced so fatal a blow as that\r\nat the Blue Licks.--L.

Mitchell, N. C. Above the Clouds.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nASCENT OF MOUNT MITCHELL, BLACK MOUNTAIN, NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n(_From The Land of the Sky._[44])\r\n\r\nThe sun is shining brightly, and his golden lances light up the depths\r\nof the forest into which we enter--an enchanted world of far-reaching\r\ngreenness, the stillness of which is only broken by the voice of the\r\nstreams which come down the gorges of the mountain in leaping\r\ncascades. Few things are more picturesque than the appearance of a\r\ncavalcade like ours following in single file the winding path (not\r\nroad) that leads into the marvelous, mysterious wilderness. When the\r\nascent fairly begins, the path is often like the letter S, and one\r\ncommands a view of the entire line--of horsemen in slouched hats and\r\ngray coats, of ladies in a variety of attire, with water-proof cloaks\r\nserving as riding-skirts, and hats garlanded with forest wreaths and\r\ngrasses. The guide tramps steadily ahead, leading the pack-horse, and\r\nwe catch a glimpse of his face now and then as he turns to answer some\r\nquestion addressed to him. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"We wind up the side of the mountain like this for several miles,\"\r\nsays Eric, \"then we travel along a ridge for some distance, and\r\nfinally we ascend the peak formerly called the Black Dome, now Mount\r\nMitchell. The whole distance is about twelve miles, and the most of it\r\nis steady climbing.\" . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"And it was in this wilderness that Professor Mitchell lost his life\r\nsixteen or seventeen years ago, was it not?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Burnett [the guide] was one of the men engaged in the search for\r\nhim. He will tell you all about it. . .\"\r\n\r\nThe forest around us becomes wilder, greener, more luxuriant at every\r\nstep. . . . Presently, however, the aspect of our surroundings\r\nchanges. We leave this varied forest behind, and enter the region of\r\nthe balsam, from the dark color of which the mountain takes its name.\r\nAbove a certain line of elevation no trees are found save these\r\nbeautiful yet sombre firs. They grow to an immense height and stand so\r\nthickly together that one marvels how any animal larger than a cat can\r\nthread its way among their stems. Overhead the boughs interlock in a\r\ncanopy, making perpetual shade beneath. No shrubs of any kind are to\r\nbe found here--only beds of thick elastic moss, richer than the\r\nrichest velvet, and ferns in plumy profusion. . . . Dan Burnett leads\r\non, and presently we emerge on the largest and most beautiful of the\r\nlittle prairies through which we have passed. This stretch of open\r\nground lies at the foot of the highest peak, the abrupt sides of which\r\nrise in conical shape before us. It is here, Mr. Burnett tells us,\r\nthat the mountaineers who were searching for Professor Mitchell found\r\nthe first trace of the way he had taken.\r\n\r\n\"We had been searchin' from Friday to Tuesday,\" he says, \"and on\r\nTuesday we was pretty nigh disheartened, when Wilson--an old hunter\r\nfrom over in Yancey--said he hadn't no doubt the professor had tried\r\nto go down to Caney Valley by a trail they two had followed thirteen\r\nyears afore, and which leads that way\"--he points down into the dark\r\nwilds below us. \"Well, we looked along the edge of this here prairie\r\ntill we found a track. Wilson was right--he _had_ tried to go down to\r\nCaney Valley. We follered his trail fur about four mile, and I was one\r\nof them what found him at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had lost his way,\" says Eric. \"I have seen the spot--they call it\r\nMitchell's Falls now--where he died. A stream of considerable size\r\nplunges over a precipice of about forty feet into a basin fourteen\r\nfeet deep by as many wide. Into this he fell, probably at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how was it possible to bring a dead body up these steeps?\" Sylvia\r\nsays, addressing Mr. Burnett.\r\n\r\n\"We brought it in a sheet slung to the top of stout poles,\" he\r\nanswers. \"Then it were carried down to Asheville, and then brought up\r\nagain, and buried there\"--he nods to the peak above us.\r\n\r\n\"In the warmth of their great friendship and admiration, people\r\nthought that he ought to rest in the midst of the scenes he had\r\nexplored so fearlessly and loved so well,\" says Eric. . . . Before\r\nlong we gain the top, and the first object on which our eyes rest\r\nis--the grave. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nBesides the grave, the summit is entirely bare.\r\n\r\nThe view is so immense that one is forced to regard it in sections.\r\nFar to the north east lies Virginia, from which the long waving line\r\nof the Blue Ridge comes, and passes directly under the Black, making a\r\npoint of junction, near which it towers into the steep Pinnacle and\r\nstately Graybeard--so called from the white beard which it wears when\r\na frozen cloud has iced its rhododendrons. From our greater eminence\r\nwe overlook the Blue Ridge entirely, and see the country below\r\nspreading into azure distance, with white spots which resolve\r\nthemselves through the glasses into villages, and mountains clearly\r\ndefined. The Linville range--through which the Linville River forces\r\nits way in a gorge of wonderful grandeur--is in full view, with a\r\nmisty cloud lying on the surface of Table Rock, while the peculiar\r\nform of the Hawk's Bill stands forth in marked relief. Beyond, blue\r\nand limitless as the ocean, the undulating plain of the more level\r\ncountry extends until it melts into the sky.\r\n\r\nAs the glance leaves this view, and, sweeping back over the Blue\r\nRidge, follows the main ledge of the Black, one begins to appreciate\r\nthe magnitude of this great mountain. For miles along its dark crest\r\nappear a succession of cone-like peaks, and, as it sweeps around\r\nwestwardly, it divides into two great branches--one of which\r\nterminates in the height on which we stand, while numerous spurs lead\r\noff from its base; the other stretches southward, forming the splendid\r\nchain of Craggy. At our feet lie the elevated counties of Yancey and\r\nMitchell, with their surfaces so unevenly mountainous that one wonders\r\nhow men could have been daring enough to think of making their homes\r\namid such wild scenes. . . . Beyond these counties stretches the chain\r\nof the Unaka, running along the line of Tennessee, with the Roan\r\nMountain--famous for its extensive view over seven states--immediately\r\nin our front. Through the passes and rugged chasms of this range, we\r\nlook across the entire valley of East Tennessee to where the blue\r\noutlines of the Cumberland Mountains trend toward Kentucky, and we see\r\ndistinctly a marked depression which Eric says is Cumberland Gap.\r\nTurning our gaze due westward, the view is, if possible, still more\r\ngrand. There the colossal masses of the Great Smoky stand, draped in a\r\nmantle of clouds, while through Haywood and Transylvania, to the\r\nborders of South Carolina, rise the peaks of the Balsam Mountains,\r\nbehind which are the Cullowhee and the Nantahala, with the Blue Ridge\r\nmaking a majestic curve toward the point where Georgia touches the\r\nCarolinas. . . . .\r\n\r\nIt is enough to sit and watch the inexpressible beauty of the vast\r\nprospect us afternoon slowly wanes into evening. There is a sense of\r\nisolation, of solemnity and majesty, in the scene which none of us are\r\nlikely to forget. So high are we elevated above the world that the\r\npure vault of ether over our heads seems nearer to us than the blue\r\nrolling earth, with its wooded hills and smiling valleys below. No\r\nsound comes up to us, no voice of water or note of bird breaks the\r\nstillness. We are in the region of that eternal silence which wraps\r\nthe summits of the \"everlasting hills.\" A repose that is full of awe\r\nbroods over this lofty peak, which still retains the last rays of the\r\nsinking sun, while over the lower world twilight has fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[44] By permission of the author, and publishers, D.

Slavery as an institution cannot be defended; but its\r\nadministration was so nearly perfect among our forefathers as to\r\nchallenge and hold our loving respect. It is doubtful if the world has\r\nseen a peasantry so happy and so well-to-do as the negro slaves in\r\nAmerica. The world was amazed at the fidelity with which these slaves\r\nguarded, from 1861 to 1865, the homes and families of the masters who\r\nwere fighting with the army that barred their way to freedom. If\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" had portrayed the rule of slavery rather than the\r\nrarest exception, not all the armies that went to the field could have\r\nstayed the flood of rapine and arson and pillage that would have\r\nstarted with the first gun of the civil war. Instead of that, witness\r\nthe miracle of the slave in loyalty to his master, closing the fetters\r\nupon his own limbs--maintaining and defending the families of those\r\nwho fought against his freedom--and at night on the far-off\r\nbattle-field searching among the carnage for his young master, that he\r\nmight lift the dying head to his breast and bend to catch the last\r\nwords to the old folks at home, so wrestling the meantime in agony and\r\nlove that he would lay down his life in his master's stead.\r\n\r\nHistory has no parallel to the faith kept by the negro in the South\r\nduring the war. Often five hundred negroes to a single white man, and\r\nyet through these dusky throngs the women and children walked in\r\nsafety, and the unprotected homes rested in peace. Unmarshalled, the\r\nblack battalions moved patiently to the fields in the morning to feed\r\nthe armies their idleness would have starved, and at night gathered\r\nanxiously at the \"big house to hear the news from marster,\" though\r\nconscious that his victory made their chains enduring. Everywhere\r\nhumble and kindly. The body-guard of the helpless. The rough companion\r\nof the little ones. The observant friend. The silent sentry in his\r\nlowly cabin. The shrewd counsellor. And when the dead came home, a\r\nmourner at the open grave. A thousand torches would have disbanded\r\nevery Southern army, but not one was lighted. When the master, going\r\nto a war in which slavery was involved, said to his slave, \"I leave my\r\nhome and loved ones in your charge,\" the tenderness between man and\r\nmaster stood disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe Northern man, dealing with casual servants, querulous, sensitive,\r\nand lodged for a day in a sphere they resent, can hardly comprehend\r\nthe friendliness and sympathy that existed between the master and the\r\nslave. He cannot understand how the negro stood in slavery days,\r\nopen-hearted and sympathetic, full of gossip and comradeship, the\r\ncompanion of the hunt, frolic, furrow, and home, contented in the\r\nkindly dependence that had been a habit of his blood, and never\r\nlifting his eyes beyond the narrow horizon that shut him in with his\r\nneighbors and friends. But this relation did exist in the days of\r\nslavery. It was the rule of that _régime_. It has survived war, and\r\nstrife, and political campaigns in which the drum-beat inspired and\r\nFederal bayonets fortified. It will never die until the last\r\nslaveholder and slave has been gathered to rest. It is the glory of\r\nour past in the South. It is the answer to abuse and slander. It is\r\nthe hope of our future.\r\n\r\n_Ante-bellum Civilization._--The relations of the races in slavery\r\nmust be clearly understood to understand what has followed, and to\r\njudge of what is yet to come. Not less important is it to have some\r\nclear idea of the civilization of that period.\r\n\r\nThat was a peculiar society. Almost feudal in its splendor, it was\r\nalmost patriarchal in its simplicity. Leisure and wealth gave it\r\nexquisite culture. Its wives and mothers, exempt from drudgery, and\r\nalmost from care, gave to their sons, through patient and constant\r\ntraining, something of their own grace and gentleness and to their\r\nhomes beauty and light. Its people, homogeneous by necessity, held\r\nstraight and simple faith, and were religious to a marked degree along\r\nthe old lines of Christian belief. This same homogeneity bred a\r\nhospitality that was as kinsmen to kinsmen, and that wasted at the\r\nthreshold of every home what the more frugal people of the North\r\nconserved and invested in public charities.\r\n\r\nThe code duello furnished the highest appeal in dispute. An affront to\r\na lad was answered at the pistol's mouth. The sense of quick\r\nresponsibility tempered the tongues of even the most violent, and the\r\nnewspapers of South Carolina for eight years, it is said, did not\r\ncontain one abusive word. The ownership of slaves, even more than of\r\nrealty, held families steadfast on their estates, and everywhere\r\nprevailed the sociability of established neighborhoods. Money counted\r\nleast in making the social status, and constantly ambitious and\r\nbrilliant youngsters from no estate married into the families of the\r\nplanter princes. Meanwhile the one character utterly condemned and\r\nostracized was the man who was mean to his slaves. Even the coward was\r\npitied and might have been liked. For the cruel master there was no\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\nThe _ante-bellum_ society had immense force. Working under the slavery\r\nwhich brought the suspicion or hostility of the world, and which\r\npractically beleaguered it within walls, it yet accomplished good\r\nthings. For the first sixty-four years of the republic it furnished\r\nthe president for fifty-two years. Its statesmen demanded the war of\r\n1812, opened it with but five Northern senators supporting it, and its\r\ngeneral, Jackson, won the decisive battle of New Orleans. It was a\r\nSouthern statesman who added the Louisiana territory of more than\r\n1,000,000 square miles to our domain. Under a Southern statesman\r\nFlorida was acquired from Spain. Against the opposition of the free\r\nStates, the Southern influence forced the war with Mexico, and annexed\r\nthe superb empire of Texas, brought in New Mexico, and opened the\r\ngates of the republic to the Pacific. Scott and Taylor, the heroes of\r\nthe Mexican war, were Southern men. In material, as in political\r\naffairs, the old South was masterful. The first important railroad\r\noperated in America traversed Carolina. The first steamer that crossed\r\nthe ocean cleared from Savannah.\r\n\r\nThe first college established for girls was opened in Georgia. No\r\nnaturalist has surpassed Audubon; no geographer equalled Maury; and\r\nSims and McDonald led the world of surgery in their respective lines.\r\nIt was Crawford Long, of Georgia, who gave to the world the priceless\r\nblessing of anæsthesia.\r\n\r\nThe wealth accumulated by the people was marvellous. And, though it is\r\nheld that slavery enriched the few at the general expense, Georgia and\r\nCarolina were the richest States, per capita, in the Union in 1800,\r\nsaving Rhode Island. Some idea of the desolation of the war may be had\r\nfrom the fact that, in spite of their late remarkable recuperation,\r\nthey are now, excepting Idaho, the poorest States, per capita, in the\r\nUnion. So rich was the South in 1860, that Mr. Lincoln spoke but\r\ncommon sentiment when he said: \"If we let the South go, where shall we\r\nget our revenues?\"\r\n\r\nIn its engaging grace--in the chivalry that tempered even Quixotism\r\nwith dignity--in the piety that saved master and slave alike--in the\r\ncharity that boasted not--in the honor held above estate--in the\r\nhospitality that neither condescended nor cringed--in frankness and\r\nheartiness and wholesome comradeship--in the reverence paid to\r\nwomanhood and the inviolable respect in which woman's name was\r\nheld--the civilization of the old slave _régime_ in the South has not\r\nbeen surpassed, and perhaps will not be equalled, among men.\r\n\r\nAnd as the fidelity of the slave during the war bespoke the kindness\r\nof the master before the war, so the unquestioning reverence with\r\nwhich the young men of the South accepted, in 1865, their heritage of\r\npoverty and defeat, proved the strength and excellence of the\r\ncivilization from which that heritage had come. In cheerfulness they\r\nbestirred themselves amid the ashes and the wrecks, and, holding the\r\ninspiration of their past to be better than their rich acres and\r\ngarnered wealth, went out to rebuild their fallen fortunes, with never\r\na word of complaint, nor the thought of criticism!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[45] By permission of \"New York Ledger,\" Robert Bonner's Sons, N.

Even on the summit of\r\nChilhowee Mountain the apples in Peter Giles' orchard were beginning\r\nto redden, and his Indian corn, planted on so steep a declivity that\r\nthe stalks seemed to have much ado to keep their footing, was crested\r\nwith tassels and plumed with silk. Among the dense forests, seen by no\r\nman's eye, the elder was flying its creamy banners in honor of June's\r\ncoming, and, heard by no man's ear, the pink and white bells of the\r\nazalea rang out melodies of welcome. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThen the two men tilted their chairs against the little porch in front\r\nof Peter Giles' log cabin, and puffed their pipes in silence. The\r\npanorama spread out before them showed misty and dreamy among the\r\ndelicate spiral wreaths of smoke. But was that gossamer-like illusion,\r\nlying upon the far horizon, the magic of nicotian, or the vague\r\npresence of distant heights? As ridge after ridge came down from the\r\nsky in ever-graduating shades of intenser blue, Peter Giles might have\r\ntold you that this parallel system of enchantment was only \"the\r\nmountings\"; that here was Foxy, and there was Big Injun, and still\r\nbeyond was another, which he had \"hearn tell ran spang up into\r\nVirginny.\" The sky that bent to clasp this kindred blue was of varying\r\nmoods. Floods of sunshine submerged Chilhowee in liquid gold, and\r\nrevealed that dainty outline limned upon the northern horizon; but\r\nover the Great Smoky mountains, clouds had gathered and a gigantic\r\nrainbow bridged the valley. . . . . . . . . Simon Burney did not speak\r\nfor a moment. . . . \"That's a likely gal o' yourn,\" he drawled, with\r\nan odd constraint in his voice,--\"a likely gal, that Clarsie.\" . . .\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Peter Giles at length replied, \"Clarsie air a likely enough\r\ngal. But she air mightily sot ter havin' her own way. An' ef 't ain't\r\ngive to her peaceable-like, she jes' takes it, whether or no.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement, made by one presumably informed on the subject, might\r\nhave damped the ardor of many a suitor,--for the monstrous truth was\r\ndawning on Peter Giles's mind that suitor was the position to which\r\nthis slow elderly widower aspired. But Simon Burney, with that odd,\r\nall-pervading constraint still prominently apparent, mildly observed,\r\n\"Waal, ez much ez I hev seen of her goin's-on, it 'pears ter me az her\r\nway air a mighty good way. An' it ain't comical that she likes\r\nit.\" . . . . . . . The song grew momentarily more distinct: among the\r\nleaves there were fugitive glimpses of blue and white, and at last\r\nClarsie appeared, walking lightly along the log, clad in her checked\r\nhomespun dress, and with a pail upon her head.\r\n\r\nShe was a tall lithe girl, with that delicately transparent complexion\r\noften seen among the women of these mountains. Her lustreless black\r\nhair lay along her forehead without a ripple or a wave; there was\r\nsomething in the expression of her large eyes that suggested those of\r\na deer,--something free, untamable, and yet gentle. \"'Tain't no wonder\r\nter me ez Clarsie is all tuk up with the wild things, an' critters\r\nginerally,\" her mother was wont to say; \"she sorter looks like 'em,\r\nI'm a-thinkin'.\"\r\n\r\nAs she came in sight there was a renewal of that odd constraint in\r\nSimon Burney's face and manner, and he rose abruptly. \"Waal,\" he said,\r\nhastily, going to his horse, a raw-boned sorrel, hitched to the fence,\r\n\"it's about time I war a-startin' home, I reckons.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded to his host, who silently nodded in return, and the old\r\nhorse jogged off with him down the road, as Clarsie entered the house\r\nand placed the pail upon a shelf.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe breeze freshened, after the sun went down, . . . there were stars\r\nin the night besides those known to astronomers; the stellular\r\nfire-flies gemmed the black shadows with a fluctuating brilliancy;\r\nthey circled in and out of the porch, and touched the leaves above\r\nClarsie's head with quivering points of light. A steadier and an\r\nintenser gleam was advancing along the road, and the sound of languid\r\nfootsteps came with it; the aroma of tobacco graced the atmosphere,\r\nand a tall figure walked up to the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, come in,\" said Peter Giles, rising, and tendering the guest\r\na chair. \"Ye air Tom Pratt, ez well ez I kin make out by this light.\r\nWaal, Tom, we hain't furgot ye sence ye done been hyar.\"\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe young man took leave presently, in great depression of\r\nspirits. . . . Clarsie ascended the ladder to a nook in the roof which\r\nshe called her room.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life her slumber was fitful and restless,\r\nlong intervals of wakefulness alternating with snatches of fantastic\r\ndreams. . . . And then her mind reverted to Tom Pratt, to old Simon\r\nBurney, and to her mother's emphatic and oracular declaration that\r\nwidowers are in league with Satan, and that the girls upon whom they\r\ncast the eye of supernatural fascination have no choice in the matter.\r\n\"I wish I knowed ef that thar sayin' war true,\" she murmured, her face\r\nstill turned to the western spurs, and the moon sinking slowly toward\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden resolution she rose to her feet. She knew a way of\r\ntelling fortunes which was, according to tradition, infallible, and\r\nshe determined to try it, and ease her mind as to her future. Now was\r\nthe propitious moment. \"I hev always hearn that it won't come true\r\n'thout ye try it jes' before daybreak, an' kneelin' down at the forks\r\nof the road.\" She hesitated a moment and listened intently. \"They'd\r\nnever git done a-laffin' at me, ef they fund it out,\" she\r\nthought. . . . [She went out into the road.] She fixed her eyes upon\r\nthe mystic sphere dropping down the sky, knelt among the azaleas at\r\nthe forks of the road, and repeated the time-honored invocation: \"Ef\r\nI'm a-goin' ter marry a young man, whistle, Bird, whistle. Ef I'm\r\na-goin' ter marry an old man, low, Cow, low. Ef I ain't a-goin' ter\r\nmarry nobody, knock, Death, knock.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a prolonged silence in the matutinal freshness and perfume\r\nof the woods. She raised her head, and listened attentively. No chirp\r\nof half-awakened bird, no tapping of wood-pecker or the mysterious\r\ndeath-watch; but from far along the dewy aisles of the forest, the\r\nungrateful Spot that Clarsie had fed more faithfully than herself,\r\nlifted up her voice, and set the echoes vibrating. Clarsie, however,\r\nhad hardly time for a pang of disappointment.\r\n\r\nWhile she still knelt among the azaleas, her large deer-like eyes were\r\nsuddenly dilated with terror. From around the curve of the road came\r\nthe quick beat of hastening footsteps, the sobbing sound of panting\r\nbreath, and between her and the sinking moon there passed an\r\nattenuated one-armed figure, with a pallid sharpened face, outlined\r\nfor a moment on its brilliant disk, and dreadful starting eyes, and\r\nquivering open mouth. It disappeared in an instant among the shadows\r\nof the laurel, and Clarsie, with a horrible fear clutching at her\r\nheart, sprang to her feet. . . . the ghost stood before her. She could\r\nnot nerve herself to run past him, and he was directly in her way\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\"Ye do ez ye air bid, or it'll be the worse for ye,\" said the \"harnt\"\r\nin a quivering shrill tone. \"Thar's hunger in the nex' worl' ez well\r\nez in this, an' ye bring me some vittles hyar this time ter-morrer,\r\nan' don't ye tell nobody ye hev seen me, nuther, or it'll be the worse\r\nfor ye.\" . . .\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before the moon sank, Clarsie, with a tin pail in\r\nher hand, went to meet the ghost at the appointed place. . . . . .\r\nMorning was close at hand. . . . . . the leaves fell into abrupt\r\ncommotion, and he was standing in the road, beside her. He did not\r\nspeak, but watched her with an eager, questioning intentness, as she\r\nplaced the contents of the pail upon the moss at the roadside. \"I'm\r\na-comin' agin ter-morrer,\" she said, gently. . . . Then she slowly\r\nwalked along her misty way in the dim light of the coming dawn. There\r\nwas a footstep in the road behind her; she thought it was the ghost\r\nonce more. She turned, and met Simon Burney, face to face. His rod was\r\non his shoulder, and a string of fish was in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ye air a-doin' wrongful, Clarsie,\" he said sternly. \"It air agin the\r\nlaw fur folks ter feed an' shelter them ez is a-runnin' from jestice.\r\nAn' ye'll git yerself inter trouble. Other folks will find ye out,\r\nbesides me, an' then the sheriff 'll be up hyar arter ye.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears rose to Clarsie's eyes. This prospect was infinitely more\r\nterrifying than the awful doom which follows the horror of a ghost's\r\nspeech. \"I can't help it,\" she said, however, doggedly swinging the\r\npail back and forth. \"I can't gin my consent ter starvin' of folks,\r\neven if they air a-hidin' an' a-runnin' from jestice.\" . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[47] By permission of Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANSKE DANDRIDGE.\r\n\r\n~1859=----.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS.

He recognized the austere and solemn\r\nbeauty that hemmed him in from the far-off outer world; but at the\r\nsame time he was contrasting it with the sea-coast of his native\r\nState, Massachusetts, and a certain creeping homesickness began to\r\nrise about his heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Model School, Peabody Normal College.~]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, he had left his delicate wife suffering with an\r\nacute neuralgic headache, and also saddened by a yearning for the\r\npicturesque old farm-house in which he had been born, and where they\r\nhad lived during the first year of marriage. The trap which Gilman\r\ndrove was filled with surveying instruments, and, as he turned into\r\nthe rough mountain road, which led towards the site of the new railway\r\nfor which he was now prospecting, the smaller ones began to rattle\r\ntogether and slide from the seat beside him. Finally, as the cart\r\nslipped against a stone, the level bounced into a puddle. He was about\r\nto jump out when a bold, ringing voice called to him:\r\n\r\n\"Set still--A'll pick hit up.\"\r\n\r\nThen a figure slid down the rocky bank at his right, her one garment\r\nwrinkling from her bare, sturdy legs during the performance.\r\n\r\nGilman had never seen anything like her in his thirty years of varied\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nShe was very tall. A curtain of rough, glittering curls hung to her\r\nknees. Her face, clear with that clearness which only a mountain wind\r\ncan bring, was white as a seagull's breast, except where a dark, yet\r\nvivid pink melted into the blue veins on her temples and throat. Her\r\nround, fresh lips, smooth as a peony-leaf, were parted in a wide\r\nlaugh, over teeth large and yellow-white, like the grains on an ear of\r\ncorn. She wore a loose tunic of blue-gray stuff, which reached to the\r\nmiddle of her legs, covered with grass stains and patches of mould.\r\nHer bare feet, somewhat broadened by walking, were well-shaped, the\r\ngreat toe standing apart from the others, the strong, round ankles,\r\nalthough scratched and bruised, perfectly symmetrical. Her arms, bare\r\nalmost to the shoulder, were like those with which in imagination we\r\ncomplete the Milo. Eyes, round and colored like the edges of broken\r\nglass, looked out boldly from under her long black eyebrows. Her nose\r\nwas straight and well cut, but set impertinently.\r\n\r\nAs she picked up the muddy level she laughed boisterously and wiped it\r\non her frock.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Gilman, and then, after a second's hesitation,\r\nadded: \"Where are you going? Perhaps I can give you a lift on your\r\nway? Will you get in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a done keer ef a do,\" she said, still staring at him.\r\n\r\nShe got in and took the level on her knee, then burst out laughing\r\nagain--\r\n\r\n\"A reckon yuh wonders what a'm a haw-hawin' at?\" she asked, suddenly.\r\n\"Well, a'll tell yuh! 'Tiz case a feels jess like this hyuh\r\ncontrapshun o' yourn. A haint hed a bite sence five this mawnin', and\r\na've got a bubble in th' middle o' me, a ken tell yuh!\"\r\n\r\nShe opened her flexible mouth almost to her ears, showing both rows of\r\nspeckless teeth, and roaring mirthfully again.\r\n\r\n\"I've got some sandwiches, here--won't you have one?\" said Gilman.\r\n\r\n\"Dunno--what be they?\" she asked, rather suspiciously, eyeing him\r\nsidewise.\r\n\r\nHe explained to her, and she accepted one, tearing from it a huge\r\nsemi-circle, which she held in her cheek while exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Murder! hain't that good, though? D'yuh eat them things ev'y day? Yuh\r\nlooks hit! You're a real fine-lookin' feller--mos' ez good-lookin' ez\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Bill?\" asked Gilman, much interested in this, his first\r\nconversation with a genuine savage.\r\n\r\n\"Bill? he's muh pard, an' muh brother, too. I come down hyuh tuh git\r\nhim a drink o' water, but a hain't foun' a spring yit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there isn't one in several miles,\" said Gilman.\r\n\r\n\"Hyuh!\" she cried. \"Lemme git out.\" . . . And she was out, with the\r\nbound of a deer. \"You g'long,\" she said; \"a'm sorry a rode this far\r\nwi' you. You'll larf 'bout muh bar foots, an' this hyuh rag o' mine,\r\nwi' them po' white trash an' niggers. Whar you fum, anyhow? You hain't\r\na Fuginia feller. A kin tell by yo' talk. You called roots 'ruts'\r\njess now, an' yuh said we'd 'sun' be whar them other fellers be.

Mawnin'.\" And she began to swing\r\nherself upon a great lichen-crested boulder by the roadside. . . . . .\r\n\r\nGilman was naturally curious as to the type of the young barbarian\r\nwhom he had met on his drive to Black Creek, and, during a pause in\r\nhis work, he told a young fellow named Watkins of his adventure, and\r\nasked him to what class the girl belonged.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon, sir, she was a sang-digger,\" said Watkins, laughing.\r\n\"They're a awful wild lot, mostly bad as they make 'em, with no more\r\nidea of right an' wrong than a lot o' ground-horgs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is a 'sang-digger'?\" asked Gilman, more and more curious.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, sang, or ginseng, ez the real name is, is a sorter root\r\nthat grows thick in the mountains about here. They make some sorter\r\nmedicine outer it. I've chawed it myself for heartburn. It's right\r\npaying, too--sang-digging is, sir; you ken git at least a dollar a\r\npound for it, an' sometimes you ken dig ten pounds in a day, but\r\nthat's right seldom. Two or three pounds a day is doin' well. They're\r\na awful low set, sir, sang-diggers is. We call 'em 'snakes'\r\nhereabouts, 'cause they don't have no place to live cep'in' in winter,\r\nand then they go off somewhere or ruther, to their huts. But in the\r\nsummer and early autumn they stop where night ketches 'em, an' light a\r\nfire an' sleep 'round it. They cert'n'y are a bad lot, sir. They'll\r\nsteal a sheep or a horse ez quick ez winkin'. Why, t'want a year ago\r\nthat they stole a mighty pretty mare o' mine, that I set a heap by,\r\nan' rid off her tail an' mane a-tearin' through the brush with her.\r\nShe got loose somehow an' come back to me. But they stole two horses\r\nfor ole Mr. Hawkins, down near Fallin' Springs, an' he a'in't been\r\nable to git 'em back. There's awful murders an' villainies done by\r\n'em. But some o' them sang-digger gals is awful pretty. . . . Yes,\r\nsir, I reckon she was a sang-digger, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n[This wild creature of the woods was treated kindly by Gilman and his\r\nwife, and she finally sacrificed herself to save Mrs. Gilman.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[49] By permission of the author, and publishers, the Town Topics\r\nPublishing Co., N.

Her \"Balcony Stories\" are like pictures in their vivid\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n    Monsieur Motte.\r\n    Earthlings.\r\n    Balcony Stories.\r\n    Bonne Maman.\r\n    Bayou L'Ombre.\r\n    History of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA GRANDE DEMOISELLE.\r\n\r\nA BALCONY STORY.\r\n\r\n(_From the Century Magazine_,[50] Jan., 1893.)\r\n\r\nThat was what she was called by everybody as soon as she was seen or\r\ndescribed. Her name, besides baptismal titles, was Idalie Sainte Foy\r\nMortemart des Islets. When she came into society, in the brilliant\r\nlittle world of New Orleans, it was the event of the season, and\r\nafter she came in, whatever she did became also events. Whether she\r\nwent, or did not go; what she said, or did not say; what she wore, and\r\ndid not wear--all these became important matters of discussion, quoted\r\nas much or more than what the President said, or the governor thought.\r\nAnd in those days, the days of '59, New Orleans was not, as it is now,\r\na one-heiress place, but it may be said that one could find heiresses\r\nthen as one finds type-writing girls now.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Idalie received her birth and what education she had on\r\nher parent's plantation, the famed old Reine Sainte Foy place, and it\r\nis no secret that, like the ancient kings of France, her birth\r\nexceeded her education.\r\n\r\nIt was a plantation, the Reine Sainte Foy, the richness and luxury of\r\nwhich are really well described in those perfervid pictures of\r\ntropical life, at one time the passion of philanthropic imaginations,\r\nexcited and exciting over the horrors of slavery. Although these\r\npictures were then often accused of being purposely exaggerated, they\r\nseem now to fall short of, instead of surpassing, the truth. Stately\r\nwalls, acres of roses, miles of oranges, unmeasured fields of cane,\r\ncolossal sugar-house--they were all there, and all the rest of it,\r\nwith the slaves, slaves, slaves everywhere, whole villages of negro\r\ncabins. And there were also, most noticeable to the natural, as well\r\nas visionary eye--there were the ease, idleness, extravagance,\r\nself-indulgence, pomp, pride, arrogance, in short the whole\r\nenumeration, the moral _sine qua non_, as some people considered it,\r\nof the wealthy slaveholder of aristocratic descent and tastes.\r\n\r\nWhat Mademoiselle Idalie cared to learn she studied, what she did not\r\nshe ignored; and she followed the same simple rule untrammeled in her\r\neating, drinking, dressing, and comportment generally; and whatever\r\ndiscipline may have been exercised on the place, either in fact or\r\nfiction, most assuredly none of it, even so much as in a threat, ever\r\nattainted her sacred person. When she was just turned sixteen,\r\nMademoiselle Idalie made up her mind to go into society. Whether she\r\nwas beautiful or not, it is hard to say. It is almost impossible to\r\nappreciate properly the beauty of the rich, the very rich. The\r\nunfettered development, the limitless choice of accessories, the\r\nconfidence, the self-esteem, the sureness of expression, the\r\nsimplicity of purpose, the ease of execution,--all these produce a\r\ncertain effect of beauty behind which one really cannot get to measure\r\nlength of nose, or brilliancy of the eye. This much can be said; there\r\nwas nothing in her that positively contradicted any assumption of\r\nbeauty on her part, or credit of it on the part of others. She was\r\nvery tall and very thin with small head, long neck, black eyes, and\r\nabundant straight black hair,--for which her hair-dresser deserved\r\nmore praise than she,--good teeth of course, and a mouth that, even in\r\nprayer, talked nothing but commands; that is about all she had _en\r\nfait d'ornements_, as the modistes say. It may be added that she\r\nwalked as if the Reine Sainte Foy plantation extended over the whole\r\nearth, and the soil of it were too vile for her tread.\r\n\r\nOf course she did not buy her toilets in New Orleans. Everything was\r\nordered from Paris, and came as regularly through the custom-house as\r\nthe modes and robes to the milliners. She was furnished by a certain\r\nhouse there, just as one of a royal family would be at the present\r\nday. As this had lasted from her layette up to her sixteenth year, it\r\nmay be imagined what took place when she determined to make her début.\r\nThen it was literally, not metaphorically, _carte blanche_, at least\r\nso it got to the ears of society. She took a sheet of note-paper,\r\nwrote the date at the top, added \"I make my début in November,\" signed\r\nher name at the extreme end of the sheet, addressed it to her\r\ndressmaker in Paris, and sent it. . . . . .\r\n\r\nThat she was admired, raved about, loved even, goes without saying.\r\nAfter the first month she held the refusal of half the beaux of New\r\nOrleans. Men did absurd, undignified, preposterous things for her: and\r\nshe? Love? Marry? The idea never occurred to her. She treated the most\r\nexquisite of her pretenders no better than she treated her Paris\r\ngowns, for the matter of that. She could not even bring herself to\r\nlisten to a proposal patiently; whistling to her dogs, in the middle\r\nof the most ardent protestations, or jumping up and walking away with\r\na shrug of the shoulders, and a \"Bah!\"\r\n\r\nWell! every one knows what happened after '59. There is no need to\r\nrepeat. The history of one is the history of all. . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nIt might have been ten years according to some calculations, or ten\r\neternities,--the heart and the almanac never agree about time,--but\r\none morning old Champigny (they used to call him Champignon) was\r\nwalking along his levee front . . . when he saw a figure approaching.\r\nHe had to stop to look at it, for it was worth while. The head was\r\nhidden by a green barege veil, which the showers had plentifully\r\nbesprinkled with dew; a tall thin figure. . . . She was the teacher of\r\nthe colored school some three or four miles away. \"Ah,\" thought\r\nChampigny, \"some Northern lady on a mission.\" . . . Old Champigny\r\ncould not get over it that he had never seen her before. But he must\r\nhave seen her, and, with his abstraction and old age, not have\r\nnoticed her, for he found out from the negroes that she had been\r\nteaching four or five years there. And he found out also--how, it is\r\nnot important--that she was Idalie Sainte Foy Mortemart des Islets.\r\n_La grande demoiselle!_ He had never known her in the old days, owing\r\nto his uncomplimentary attitude toward women, but he knew of her, of\r\ncourse, and of her family. . . . .\r\n\r\nOnly the good God himself knows what passed in Champigny's mind on the\r\nsubject. We know only the results. He went and married _la grande\r\ndemoiselle_. How? Only the good God knows that too.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[50] By permission of the author, and publishers, The Century Co.,\r\nN.
